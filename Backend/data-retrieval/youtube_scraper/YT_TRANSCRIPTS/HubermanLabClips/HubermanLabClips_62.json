    "transcript": "Could you give us just a brief top contour\nof what the slow carb diet is?\nSure, yeah.\nThe slow carb diet is\nintended to be a simple,\neasy to adhere to diet for people\nwho have perhaps failed other diets\nthat allows you to recompose your body.\nSo improve muscle mass,\ndecrease body fat percentage.\nAnd the rules are really simple\nand that's part of what makes it work.\nIt's not ideal for every\nsport in every circumstance,\nbut broadly speaking, it works for a lot\nof people who've had trouble\nwith dieting in the past.\nSo, rule number one, don't drink calories.\nThat's it, very simple.\nSo black coffee, unsweetened tea, great.\nJuice out, anything with calories out,\nyou could add a little bit of heavy cream\nto your coffee, let's say.\nBut that's also bending\nthe rules in a way that I don't like.\nSo in the beginning it's\nlike, follow the rules\nso you can break them later.\nSo in the beginning, let's just say\nyou can't drink calories.\nNumber two, don't eat anything white.\nSounds pretty basic, right?\nJust don't eat anything\nthat is the color of white,\nor that could be white, basically,\nthat means you're going\nto be avoiding starches.\nAnd things that are similar to starches.\nThat includes things like oatmeal.\nThat includes things like oatmeal.\nSo roughly speaking, just avoiding things\nthat are white or that could be white\nwill get you pretty far.\nAnd yes, there are exceptions,\nlike cauliflower are fine,\nyou can have cauliflower, but\nagain, don't get fancy, right?\nIt's very easy\nto outsmart yourself when it\ncomes to behavioral change.\nKeep it simple.\nSo for at least two weeks,\nforget about the exceptions, right?\nDon't drink calories,\ndon't eat anything white,\nand then eat 30 grams\nof protein within 30 minutes of waking up.\nOkay, we got that.\nAnd then there are a few buckets\nyou can choose from, right?\nSo you have vegetables,\nbeans, and lentils,\nand then some type of protein.\nSo you're going to come up\nwith meals that you can follow\nwithout deviating for a\nperiod of one or two weeks,\njust come up with the same meals.\nAnd that's going to sound boring.\nYes, but guess what?\nYou do it already.\nYou just might not realize it.\nAnd the lentils and the beans,\nspecifically as a pre-req,\nwe can get into some of the\nreasons, but add a lot of fiber\nand also inhibit appetite, right?\nSo that's actually a very\nimportant component of these meals.\nAnd there may be a handful of other rules,\nbut those are the basics.\nAnd then the redemption\nis take one day off per week\nand just go fucking crazy.\nThat's cheat day.\nThere are some epic cheat days out there,\nsome I've captured for myself.\nAnd anything goes, when I say\nanything, I do mean anything.\nSo if you want to consume multiple\npizzas, pints of ice cream,\nwhatever, indulge, I left one\nout, no fruit during the week.\nSo avoid fruit, avoid\nfructose, so, agave, nectar,\nanything that is sort of hidden sugar.\nAvoid all that.\nIt's a no added sweeteners obviously,\nbut avoid fruit and fructose.\nAnd again, it's not going to kill you.\nGuess what?\nIf you're from European ancestry,\nyour ancestry did not\nhave like blueberries\nin the middle of winter,\ngenerally speaking, right?\nSo you'll be fine for a few weeks\nand then there's that cheat day\nand cheat day, anything goes.\nThe amount of damage\nyou can do on cheat day\nis pretty limited\nand there are ways you can mitigate that.\nThere's a whole chapter\ncalled damage control\nin before our body.\nBut focusing just on that diet\nand having one day off\nwhere you know you can do anything means\nwhen you're controlling yourself\nfor those six days of the week,\nyou're not giving up your\nfavorite foods forever.\nYou can even keep a list\nof all things you want\nto eat on cheat day,\nand then you have free\nlicense to eat on cheat day.\nAnd that provides you with a release valve\nso that you can build in\nthe cheating as opposed\nto having it occur as a failure point.\nAnd there are a handful\nof other things there.\nIf you have domino foods\nin the house, for instance,\nif you eat a lot of almonds or mixed nuts\nand you're just going to sit\nthere compulsively eating them\nwhile you're sitting at\nyour laptop, don't have\nwhat I call domino foods in\nthe house, which are going\nto really create some\nportion control issues.\nBut broadly speaking,\ndon't drink calories, donate\nthings that are white.\nTake from three categories\nand build your meals out.\nAnd those are the meals that you follow.\nDo not eat fruit or fructose\nand then cheat one day a week.\nAnd Saturday's a nice day\nfor cheat day for most folks.\nAnd just to answer some questions\nthat people are going to have.\nNo, that doesn't mean 24 hours\nthat you can spread out over two days,\nthat will actually set you back.\nBut the amount of fat that you can store\nin a handful of sittings over 24 hours,\nwhich legitimately\nis more like 12 to 18\nhours, pretty limited.\nSo that's a slow carb diet.\nGreat, thank you for that.\nI also want to ask, is it okay\nto take the day after cheat day and fast,\nor do one meal that day?\nWhen I followed the slow carb diet,\nI benefited from it tremendously.\nLost fat, gained muscle, tons\nof energy, sleeping great,\nrequired less caffeine, all sorts\nof wonderful things, stable blood sugar.\nI felt so, so good.\nReally enjoyed the cheat days.\nI really, really enjoyed the cheat days.\nThat's so fun.\nSo much fun.\nAt some point there's\nsome gastric distress\nthat comes from not regulating intake,\nwhich led me to not want\nto eat the next day.\nSo I tended to do the cheat\ndays on Sunday in my case,\nand then I would fast\nmost of Monday just water,\nblack coffee, tea, and then I might have\na small meal in the evening.\nAnd then by Tuesday I was\nback on the slow carb diet.\nDoes that seem like a sort\nof a detrimental deviation from the plan?\nI think that if that\nis what works for you,\nthen that is what works for you.\nSo this is the slow carb diet template\nfor me is a starting point.\nAnd generally I'll say, I think\nthis is from Picasso, right?\nIt's like learn the rules as an amateur\nso you can break them as a professional.\nBut it's like, I recommend\nmost people kind of stick\nwith the format for a handful of weeks\nand measure the results, right?\nSo there are guidelines for how to measure\nthe scale is a bit of a blunt instrument.\nSo there are other ways, but\nif you're extremely overweight,\nyou can just use the scale\nand fasting I think is fine.\nOr just ratcheting back your caloric\nconsumption significantly.\nAnd what happens over\ntime for most people also\nis for the first say\nfour weeks on cheat day,\nyou're going to go completely insane.\nAnd I remember I was doing\nsomething much stricter called\nthe cyclical ketogenic diet,\nwhich is a whole separate thing.\nIt's much more limiting in\nterms of what you can eat.\nBut I was training for\nultimately the nationals\nin Chinese kickboxing.\nThis was happening in '99,\nso I was training super hard.\nI was following a cyclical ketogenic diet,\nwhich meant I could eat very few things,\nbut I did have this one cheat day\nand I would do a glycogen\ndepletion workout beforehand,\nwhich is one of the things you can do\nto limit the damage on cheat day,\ndo a glycogen depletion\nworkout beforehand.\nAnd then I would just go crazy.\nI mean, I would drive to like\nKrispy Kreme, buy 12 donuts\nand they would be gone\nby the time I got home\nand it wasn't an hour away,\nit was like a 10 minute drive.\nDonuts would be gone, right?\nI would go to Safeway\nand I would buy a bag of\nthose fun sized Snickers\nand that would be just a\ntiny portion of my calories.\nOf sweet stuff for you, huh?\nA lot of sweet stuff, I\nalso did the savory stuff.\nI mean, I had my favorites.\nNothing was safe.\nPizza, nothing was safe, nothing was safe.\nMy paws got into everything.\nAnd then over time, because the\nnext day you're going to feel\nlike you got hit by a diabetic dump truck,\nyou start ratcheting back\nand you're like, okay, maybe\nI don't need to do that.\nMaybe cheat day will just be two meals,\nor maybe cheat day will\njust be like the pastries\nin the morning with the coffee\nand you start to regulate\na bit, generally.\nYou don't have to, but over\ntime you generally will.\nAnd I think after you've\nfollowed it to the T,\njust follow the commandments\nfor say four to eight weeks,\nthen you can certainly deviate.\nAnd I'm not saying if you're\nnot hungry, don't eat.\nHowever, in many cases people have,\nthey have acclimated to\nnot eating in the morning\nand then they end up\novereating later in the day.\nIf you have that habit, right?\nIf you're consuming 50% of\nyour calories or more at dinner\nand you want to lose body fat, I would say\nget some cottage cheese or something\nthat will give you 30 grams\neasily in the morning.\nWorst case scenario, use\na protein of some type.\nJust don't make it hyper caloric.\nYou mean powdered protein like?\nCould be powdered whey protein,\nwhole food is going to do a lot more.\nAnd no calorie counting, correct?\nNo calorie counting.\nIt tends to be self-limiting.\nWhen you're eating this much fiber\nand this much protein, it\ntends to be very self-limiting\nwhat you'll want to consume\nand what you can consume.\nYeah, once again,\nI had great experiences\nwith slow carb diet\nand I'm going to go back on.\nYeah and nobody needs\nto buy anything to figure it out.\nIf you just search on\ntim.blog \"Slow Carb Diet,\"\nthere, you'll get everything\nthat you need to get started.\nNo purchase necessary.\n[Music Playing]"
