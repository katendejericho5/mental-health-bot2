    "transcript": "If you talk about true accidental deaths,\nautomotive and falls and\noverdoses are the three.\nThat's basically what it comes down to.\nSo you know, in our death bar analysis,\nwe kind of list all this stuff out.\nIn fact, I think that's\nactually one of the figures\nin the book is I have the\naccidental death figure\nthat we've put together where\nwe've adjusted by population,\nand you'll see a couple of things.\nIf you look at it in absolute terms,\nit's basically a pretty constant.\nSo regardless of what\ndecade of life you're in,\nonce you're above, you know, 20,\naccidental deaths are a pretty\nsizable number of deaths.\nNow, car accidents seem\nto be pretty constant\nthroughout life, a little\nmore common if you're under 60\nthan over 60, but they never go away.\nI was told that in teenage boys\nand boys in their early 20s,\nalcohol induced automotive\nfatalities place them\nat an astronomic risk.\nIs that just not true?\nIt's not true anymore,\ncompared to overdoses.\nIs that because young\npeople now aren't getting\ntheir driver's licenses?\nI've also heard that.\nYeah, well, I think it's\nalso because we're seeing\nsuch an uptick in the deaths\nthat come from fentanyl.\nGot it.\nSo fentanyl related deaths\nhave basically squashed\nall other deaths below 65\non the accidental front.\nReally?\nOh, it's not even close.\nBecause of the number\nof different substances\nthat fentanyl is being woven into?\nIt's winding its way into everything,\nso all counterfeit\ndrugs, all illicit drugs,\nand look, most of the time\nyou're not getting a lethal dose,\nso it's, you know, but\nyou're getting lethal doses\nso often now that, well, you know,\nI did a little analysis\nactually the other day\nwhen I had looked at how are deaths\nof despair increasing\nover the last five years.\nSo what did I define\nas a death of despair?\nSuicide, alcohol related\ndeath, or overdose,\naccidental overdose, so we differentiate\nthat from suicide where\nsuicide is obviously deliberate\nand accidental is not.\nSo if you just look at those three things,\nso accidental overdoses,\nsuicides, and alcohol use,\nor alcohol related death,\nnot including driving, by the way,\nthis is like cirrhosis of\nthe liver that comes from,\nthat number is going up at\nalmost 20% per year since 2019.\nSo I couldn't get 2022 numbers yet,\nso at the time I did this\nanalysis, which was last week,\nthe 2021 numbers was\nabout 210,000 Americans.\nGoodness.\nUp from 180,000 in 2020, up\nfrom like 150,000 in 2019.\nSo is this-\nAnd that is driven almost\nentirely by fentanyl use.\nWhat other sorts of\ndrugs are people buying?\nWhere the majority of people are dying\nfrom fentanyl poisoning, and I had a guy\non my podcast recently\nnamed Anthony Hipolito,\nand if anybody's interested in this topic,\nthey really need to go listen to that.\nI watched the YouTube version of this,\nand your podcasts are excellent.\nSo people, if you're interested in this,\nand I think everyone should\nbe interested in this,\nplease do.\nIf you have a child,\nor know somebody who has a child,\nyou just got to get this\npodcast into their hands,\nbecause it's the most important\npublic service announcement\nI'll probably ever do\nin terms of saving more\nlives, potentially.\nWhere the majority of\nthis is making its way\ninto the accidental poisonings is\nthrough illicit counterfeit pills.\nSo it's when kids are out there buying,\nyou know, oxy, they want oxy.\nWell, they can't, they\ncan't get real oxy, right?\n'Cause they're not going to go\nto a doctor and get real oxy,\nso they're going to buy it\nthrough, you know, Snapchat, right?\nThey're going to buy it\nthrough some drug dealer\nthat they're finding on social media.\nThey're buying sleeping\npills, they're buying\nall sorts of counterfeit\nstuff like Adderall.\nAny of these things are\nbeing laced with fentanyl.\nAdderall?\nAbsolutely.\nWell, I assume the fentanyl-\nAnd again, the reasons\nare it's insanely cheap\nto use synthetic fentanyl,\nand secondly, and again-\nBut the effects of fentanyl are nothing\nlike the effects of Adderall.\nSo cocaine doesn't make\nsense for that reason either.\nCocaine doesn't make sense either, yep,\nand yet it's still showing up in cocaine.\nAgain, I don't think\nthat's the dominant place it's showing up.\nI would guess that the dominant place\nit's showing up is in counterfeit opioids.\nSo any opioid barbiturate,\nany sedative depressant.\nYeah, but let me tell you\nwhat I'm telling my daughter, right?\n'Cause this is, to me\nit's a frontline problem.\nI have a 14-year-old daughter, I'm like,\n\"Listen, I don't care which\nfriend of yours it is.\nI don't care how much she's amazing.\nIf she tells you to try this sleeping pill\nbecause she took it the night before\nand it was really helpful, or\nthis'll help you study better,\nor this'll help you do anything,\"\nI'm like, \"just come to us.\"\nWe've got a better pill for you, right?\nLike in other words, you\ncan't trust anything,\n'cause you don't know where she got it.\nShe has the best of intentions,\nI'm sure, when she's given\nit to you, and by the way,\nshe probably took it the night\nbefore and was just fine,\nbut the people who are making\nthese pills are not exactly up\nto GMP standards, so you know,\nyou just have no idea\nwhich pill is getting\nwhat dose of fentanyl.\nOne thing that Anthony Hipolito told me\nthat I simply couldn't believe,\nI had to ask him six times,\nwas that some of these pills have\nlike one milligram of fentanyl in them.\nNow, I made the point on the\npodcast that 100 milligrams\nof fentanyl for most people is a hit.\nLike I've had fentanyl before,\nI've been in the hospital\nand they, you know,\nI've had fentanyl.\n100 milligrams is like,\nwow, that is such a trip.\nThen why are people dying\nfrom one milligram intake?\nRespiratory inhibition, you can't breathe.\nThat shuts the brainstem off.\nWell, I don't think we\ncan highlight this enough.\nYou know, adults are\ndying, kids are dying.\nI met someone just earlier this week\nwho told me her 35-year-old son died\nof a accidental fentanyl overdose,\nand he wasn't, at least\nby her description,\na drug addict or anything of that sort.\nYeah, this is, we're talking\nabout a different game now, right?\nSo it's like, these are\nkids that have anxiety,\nthese are kids that are, you know,\nare sort of addressing another\nissue with these pills,\nand that's why I think\nthis, this whole concept\nof deaths of despair is\na really important one.\nBut back to your question,\nwhat do accidental deaths\nprimarily amount to\nfor the aging population?\nAgain, it is so clear\nthat it is fall related.\nThis is where once you hit\n60, 65, the risk of a fall\nthat results either immediately in death,\nyou know, you hit your head and die,\ngoing back to like cerebral hemorrhage,\nor it is the straw that\nbasically leads you down the path\nto death within the next 12\nmonths is astonishingly high.\nIt's so high that it's sort of hard\nto wrap your head around,\nbut if you're over 65\nand you fall and break your femur or hip,\nso you either crack the femoral\nneck or the femur itself,\nyour 12 month mortality,\nthe probability you will\nbe dead in 12 months\nafter that break if you're 65 or older,\ndepending on the study,\nis about 15 to 30%.\nWow, wow.\nSo in terms of offsetting\nthe probability of falls,\nyou talked a little bit about this before,\nyou and I have talked a\nlittle bit about this before,\nbut maybe we could go a little bit deeper.\nPeople's ability to jump\nand land seems to be\nhighly correlated with\none's ability to not fall\nor at least fall and control the fall\nin a way that leads to\nno or less severe injury.\nYeah, so Andy Galpin\ntalked about this on your,\nhe talked about it on my podcast.\nWhat is the hallmark\nof aging on the muscle?\nIt is atrophy of the\ntype two muscle fiber.\nThat's the hallmark.\nFast twitch.\nFast twitch muscle fiber.\nSo if you want to understand\nwhat looks different\nin 50-year-old Peter\nversus 18-year-old Peter,\nit's not my type one fibers,\nit's my type two fibers.\nIt's my fast twitch fibers,\nit's my explosive fibers.\nI mean, when I was 18 years old,\nI could vertical jump over 30 inches.\nToday I'm lucky if I can\nvertical jump 24 inches,\nand you know, and when I'm\n60, boy, it's like my goal is\nto be able to vertical\njump 20 inches when I'm 60,\nand I don't know if I'm\ngoing to be able to do it.\nI've seen some videos of\nsome 80-year-old sprinters\nthat are pretty impressive,\nand certainly 80-year-old\ngymnasts that are impressive.\nI have not seen very many videos\nof 80 year olds dunking\nbasketballs, for instance.\nYeah, it's-\nOh, who are not taller\nthan six feet five inches.\nYeah, yeah.\nSo when we lose, you know, so again,\nif you just think about\nsize, strength, speed,\nwe lose speed first.\nWe lose speed, then strength,\nand the last thing you lose is size.\nSo again, size is\nagnostic to fiber, right?\nYou could have big type one fibers\nand still have lots of size.\nThey're not going to be that strong,\nand they're certainly\nnot going to be fast.\nSo what, I mean look, we could go through,\nwe could spend hours on\nthis particular topic,\nbut I think the most important thing\nthat people need to understand\nis you cannot age well\nif you are not doing the type of training\nthat is there to strengthen and delay\nor minimize the hypertrophy\nof your type two fibers.\nSo everything matters, right?\nYou have to be doing your zone\ntwo, you have to be doing,\nyou know, all of these other\nthings, but some component\nof your training needs to be\nstressing the type two fibers.\nYou have to be doing strength training\nthat taxes those fibers.\nYou have to be doing reactivity training.\nYou have to be doing explosive training\nAnd ideally, some training\nthat involves jumping and landing.\nWell, jumping is a very big part of it,\nand landing is a very big part\nof another one of what I kind\nof think of as my four\npillars of strength training.\nSo one of the pillars\nof strength training is\neccentric strength, which is brakes..\nSo you know, you're going to hurt yourself\n10 times more likely, I'm making\nthat number up by the way.\nI don't know if it's 10\ntimes, but experientially,\nit seems to be you are 10 times\nmore likely to hurt yourself\nstepping off something than\nstepping onto something, right?\nStepping down versus stepping up,\nbecause when you step up onto something,\nyou are concentrically\ncontrolling a muscle.\nWhen you step down, you\nhave to apply the brakes,\nand that's where most people falter.\nMuch harder to walk downhill than uphill.\nUphill is taxing your\ncardiovascular system,\nbut if you slow down enough, you're fine.\nBut a lot of people don't have the ability\nto slow themselves down when\nthey're walking downhill,\nand so when an older\nperson steps off a curb\nand can't fully stop themselves,\nand that results in a fall.\nSo you know, I like doing\nthings like a broad jump.\nBroad jump's a fun little test set\nI like to do every once in a while.\nI always want to make sure\nI can broad jump six feet.\nThat's kind of my arbitrary\nnumber that I've chosen,\nand the reason is on the takeoff,\nthat's a very explosive movement,\nbut the landing is just as important.\nIf I can't stick that landing,\nit means I don't have the brakes.\nSo those are kind of some of\nthe tests I want to be able\nto do to make sure that\nI'm utilizing that system,\nbecause I do think, you know,\nlook, I've watched my mom.\nMy mom fell, gosh, probably\nbeen about four months ago,\njust fell in a typical\nway that people fall.\nBy the way, it could\nhave happened to anybody.\nIt's not like, you know,\nmy mom walks around and\nmoves around just fine,\nbut on this particular\nday, she just tripped\non a uneven stone and fell\nand landed and broke her hand.\nAnd she's really lucky\nshe didn't break her hip,\nand I told her that, because my mom was,\nyou know, probably in her mid 70s.\nAnd I said, \"Look, you know,\nif that was your femur,\nI'd give you a 30% chance\nof dying in the next year.\"\nI mean, it's just an,\nthose are such difficult\nto recover from injuries,\nbecause first of all, you're\ndealing with the immobility\nof, you know, the hospitalization,\nand immobility that follows that.\nAnd the amount of muscle loss\nthat occurs could easily be,\nyou know, four or five\npounds of lean tissue lost,\nthat for most people that age becomes\nalmost impossible to get back.\nThat says nothing about sort\nof the acute causes of death,\nlike a fat embolism that\nresults from a broken femur,\na blood clot from laying in bed.\nThose things are also catastrophic.\nBut what happens is a lot of\nthese patients just never get\nback to the same level of mobility.\nAnd you know, now I think in many ways,\nwe're kind of pivoting from what kills you\nto what ruins your quality of life.\nAnd we've spent so much time\ntalking about what kills you,\nbut I think you might as\nwell be dead in some ways\nif you can't do the things you want to do.\nAnd if playing with your\ngrandkids or gardening\nor playing golf or going\nfor a walk with your spouse,\nor think of any of the\nthings that we all do today\nand take for granted, if\nyou can't do those things,\nI don't know, you sort of\nlose the reason to be around.\n[Music
