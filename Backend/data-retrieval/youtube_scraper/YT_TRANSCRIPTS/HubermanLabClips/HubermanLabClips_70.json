    "transcript": "How does one measure optimal\nversus accelerated aging?\nAnd why would it be that\nsome stress is better\nthan no stress when it\ncomes to aging ideally?\nMhm.\nSo having no stress means\nwe're not really living.\nLike we're not engaging\nin the gifts of life,\nwhich are, inevitably have\nsome challenge and risk.\nAnd let me give you an example.\nOne study took elderly\npeople who have retired\nand they, you know,\nsociety kind of labels them\nas you're kind of done with\nyour meaningful work in life\nand your, you know, you are pretty much\nnot able to contribute to society.\nI mean, there's so many\nnegative stereotypes\nthat people then kind\nof embody and then live.\nAnd this program brought\nthem to work in schools\nand tutor young at-risk students.\nAnd what happened to them\nis they went from feeling\nmaybe safe and under stressed\nto feeling challenged but generative.\nThey were feeling more purpose,\nthey were feeling like they were growing,\nand they were feeling like\ntheir day had more meaning.\nThey had more relationships.\nThey had these caring\nrelationships with the students.\nThe students had all sorts\nof issues and troubles,\ndrugs and maybe not having lunch, poverty.\nAnd so they felt the stress of that.\nBut they also saw how much they could help\nwith their support and their tutoring.\nAnd in this study, they took\nimages of the hippocampus\nand those who engaged in the\nprogram, particularly the men,\nactually had growth of their hippocampus\nduring this program.\nSo at any stage in life, we can be growing\nand challenging ourselves\neven in our much later years\nand growing our brain.\nAnd you know more than anyone,\nlike what does that\nhippocampal growth mean\nfor their wellbeing and\ntheir cognitive function?\nYeah, it's interesting that\nhippocampus, of course,\na brain area involved in\nformation and recall of memories,\nmostly formation of memories.\nIt's super interesting\nbecause it's so plastic.\nIt's so amenable to the\naddition of new memories.\nI think the most striking\nstudy to me is the one,\nand I should point out\nthat most of the data\nsay that the addition of new\nneurons is not the main reason\nfor improvements in memory,\nbut it is one of them.\nBut Rusty Gage down at the\nSalk Institute did a study\nin the, I think the early 2000s\nwhere they took terminally ill people.\nAnd these people agreed to\nhave their bodies injected\nwith a dye that would label new neurons.\nAnd then after they died,\ntheir brains were processed,\nand they didn't die from the dye injection\nby the way, folks.\nThey died from other causes.\nThey were terminally ill.\nAnd what they discovered was\nthat even in terminally ill\nor and some of these\npeople were quite old,\nthose people were still\ngenerating new neurons,\nespecially in the context\nof still trying to learn\nand acquire new information so.\nWow, amazing.\nOf course, they're dead\nso they can't apply\nthat information after that.\nBut of course none of us can, right?\nNone of the information that.\nYeah, but why not up\nto when you die, right?\nAbsolutely.\nGUEST: Yeah, yeah.\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\nSo one other example of this,\nmy colleague Dave Almeida,\nhe measures, you know,\ndaily stressful events\nin huge national populations.\nAnd a small percentage of\npeople report no stressors.\nAnd so you wonder, like what's happening?\nAre they not engaging in life?\nAre they really not having stressors?\nIt looks like they are,\nit's not just that they're not\ngetting stressed by things,\nthey're not really going\nout and doing much.\nAnd what he found is that\ntheir level of kind of memory\nand cognition, their cognitive health,\nwas significantly lower.\nSo you can imagine the\nhippocampal, you know,\nthe lack of those neural progenitor cells.\nThey're just not being stimulated.\nIt's super interesting.\nI wasn't aware of that result,\nso I appreciate you sharing it.\nI almost have to wonder\nif it's like exercise\nwhere you know, so many people,\nI think now everybody\nhopefully understands\nthat exercise is going\nto lower blood pressure\nor reduce resting heart rate\nand improve musculoskeletal function\nand bone density, all that stuff.\nBut that if you took a\nsnapshot of the bodily response\nduring exercise, blood\npressure is way, way up.\nHeart rate is way, way up.\nStress hormones are way up.\nCortisol is through the\nroof during a heart workout.\nYeah.\nAnd immediately afterwards.\nAnd yet that sets in motion\na series of adaptations\nthat brings you to a better\nplace most of the time.\nI almost wonder if stress is the same.\nIs there any evidence that\nshort bouts of stress,\nprovided that they're managed well,\nmeaning that we don't spend\nthe next 24 or 48 hours\nruminating on the stressor,\nbut that we're able to\nmove through the stressor\nand resolve it in some way,\nthat that's actually beneficial for us\nbecause of the mobilization\nof energy stores\nand maybe, maybe even\nchanging our threshold\nfor reacting to stressors in the future?\nIt's a great question,\nand it's one that I have\nbeen chewing on for a while.\n'Cause we know, as you said,\nthat physical stressors,\nwhen they're short and repeated,\nlike high intensity interval training,\nthey are promoting not\njust aerobic fitness,\nbut stress fitness.\nPeople feel less rumination,\nless depression, less anxiety.\nSo they're kind of tuning\nup the nervous system.\nWhat about psychological stressors?\nAnd we know two things.\nSo one is I do think that\nthere is a level of engagement\nwith moderate stressors\nthat when we are used to them, we get fit.\nAnd our stress resilience builds,\nmeaning we're less threatened by them.\nSo let me go deep into that.\nWe can, two people can approach\nthe exact same stressor\nand one person is having\na pretty overreactive\nstress response, where\nthey basically are feeling\ntheir survival is threatened.\nSo it's high cortisol,\nhigh vasoconstriction,\nand blood pressure goes\nup equally in both.\nBut the person who's\nfeeling super threatened,\neither their survival or their\nsocial survival of their ego,\ntheir blood pressure went up\nbecause of the vasoconstriction.\nThe other person who's\nviewing the same stressor\nas I can do this.\nThis is a great challenge and opportunity.\nI have what it takes.\nThose types of thoughts\ngenerate a different\nhemodynamic response, which is\nactually more cardiac output.\nSo blood pressure's going up,\nbut in this healthier way,\nmore oxygenation to the brain,\nbetter problem solving,\nthey're able to maintain\nthis positive outlook.\nSo we've measured this\nthreat challenge response\nin many lab studies, and\nwe know lots of things.\nSo if you're having more\nof the challenge response\nat the end of it, you're less inflamed.\nSo just in the lab within an hour or two,\nwe see that they're, they didn't trigger\nall that pro-inflammatory response\nand their telomeres tend to be longer,\nwhich is a measure we can talk more about.\nBut basically it looks like they\nhave a slower speed of aging.\nThat is super interesting.\nYou call this a stress challenge response?\nSo we could call this kind of\na, to be really simplistic,\ntwo types of psychological\nstress response,\nfeeling threatened, like\nyou're going to fail.\nYou're embarrassed.\nYou know, that social\npain response we know well\nthat feels terrible, but that\nalso that huge stress response\nwhen we, you know, we\nfeel it in our stomach,\nour heart is pounding.\nIt's just an over-exaggerated response.\nThat response biologically is different\nand the thoughts that\ngo with it are different\nand we recover a lot slower.\nAnd then there's the challenge response,\nwhich is this, it's more of that\nkind of activated excited response.\nAnd the beauty is that there\nare lots of studies out there\ndone by emotions and social psychologists\nthat tilt people toward\nthe challenge response.\nWe can actually promote\nthat challenge response.\nAnd so when you asked about like,\nis it good to have a\nrepeated stress response?\nYes, if it's manageable, right?\nThen we're kind of building the\nmuscle of stress resilience.\nWhat are the sorts of\nthings that people, I can do\nin order, including me, I should say,\ncan do in order to wage\nthat challenge response?\nIs this purely based on mindset?\nLike instead of saying,\nwhy me, why this, why now?\nI can't believe this is happening.\nIs it a mental pivot to, okay,\nthis is a great opportunity for growth.\nI don't know how I'm going to manage this,\nbut I'll manage this.\nYou know, you want to stop\nme, you got to kill me,\ntype of mindset.\nYeah.\nIs that the switch that\nthen the body follows?\nYeah.\nBecause this is an interesting instance\nwhere the most, all the\nstress mitigation work\nthat my lab does is focused on using\nthe body to control the mind.\nBut here we're talking about\nthe mind controlling the body\nfirst and then the body following suit,\nwhich I find equally fascinating.\nSo are there some specific\nmental scripts that people follow\nand are we all able to\nfollow those scripts?\nYes, to some extent,\nwe control the script.\nWe can use that script\nto prepare ourselves\ngoing into a stressful situation.\nAnd we can use it at any\npoint during the stressor,\nso some of us are just wired\nto have a big threat response period.\nMaybe it's, you know, it's\nepigenetics we've inherited,\nmaybe it's early trauma that has shaped us\nto be, have this exaggerated\nemotional response.\nAnd yes, we and others have found that\ntrauma sensitizes our\nemotional stress response\nso that we are feeling more threatened.\nBut that's okay because that's\nthe part we can't control.\nAnd we just have to have\na lot of self-compassion\nand awareness that,\nokay, this is what I do.\nMy body reacts like this,\nbut what happens next?\nThat's when we can start\nto use those statements,\nself comforting,\nself-compassion, distancing.\nThere's all sorts of\nstatements that allow us\nto then recover more quickly.\nSo when we want to shift\nfrom a threatened response\nto a kind of challenge response.\nMhm.\nOr I should say, are there\nany data that dictate\nwhether or not we should keep\nthose statements in our head?\nWrite them down, say them out loud.\nI guess what I'm trying to do here\nis trying to get to a little bit more\nof the meat of the actionable.\nYeah.\nSince a lot\nof our listeners I think\nSo.\nwill be, as I am, very\nexcited about the idea\nthat a mere shift in our\nmentality about stress\ncan give us the opposite outcome.\nI mean, before you were talking about\nvasoconstriction and inflammation\nand all these bad things,\nto put it lightly.\nAnd then in the challenge\nresponse to stress,\ngetting the exact opposite,\nmore vasodilation,\nmore resources used,\nand more positive effects\non the brain body.\nMhm, yeah.\nSo what are some, if you\ncan recall from the papers?\nIf not, that's fine.\nNo, no, I can give you.\nI'm just curious.\nSome statements yeah.\nWhat those specific\ntools might be.\nEvery statement you said\nAndrew is good.\nIt's a good one.\nThe whole trick here is that people need\nto find the strength\nstatements, the stress shields,\nI call them, that fit\nthem, that feels right,\nand that they believe.\nAnd so they're, you know,\nI list a bunch of options\nin chapter three, which is called\n\"Be the Lion Instead of the Gazelle.\"\nSo the lion and gazelle\nare both, you know,\nhigh blood pressure, high stress,\nand the lion's chasing the gazelle.\nBut the gazelle's having this total threat\nvasoconstriction response\n'cause she might die.\nThe lion might get dinner, right?\nSo it's needing to mount\nthe stress response\nbecause it's so excited\nto get the tasty dinner\nfor, you know, the next few days.\nAnd so the lion is having\nthat challenge response.\nAnd so we can remind\nourselves be the lion.\nWe, it's not that we're\nalways lion or gazelle.\nWe get to shape that.\nAnd so some of those statements are,\nwell, let's say right\nwhen we're going into it,\nlist your resources.\nWhy, have you ever dealt\nwith any situation like this?\nRemind yourself of past successes.\nRemind yourself of someone you can call\nor text or feel supported by.\nRemind yourself that this\noutcome is not going to affect\nyour life in 10 years or five years.\nThat's a distancing kind\nof perspective taking.\nSo there's all these strategies\nand you got to use what works for you.\nTelling yourself, I got this, I can do it,\nI can get through it,\nI have what it takes.\nThose are all good shields.\nAnd another set is, you know, we've,\nsome of us feel really\nstressed out by stress.\nLike once we feel our heart racing,\nthat leads to, oh no, you\nknow, this is bad for me.\nAnd so rather than getting\nstressed by stress,\nwe actually want to remind ourselves\nthat this stress response is empowering.\nThis is going to help me cope.\nMy body's excited.\nMy body is doing just\nwhat it should right now.\nSo that reframing in\nstudies by Wendy Mendez\nand others, my colleagues who\ndo these reappraisal research,\nthey have basically trained people\nto view stress as positive.\nDuring the stressful\nsituations in the lab,\npeople do better, they perform better,\nthey feel more positive emotion,\nthey problem solve better,\nthey recover more quickly,\nso pretty powerful stuff.\n[Music Playing]"
