    "transcript": "You know, we hear stress,\nstress is bad, stress can kill us,\nno one likes to feel stressed, et cetera.\nBut as you and I both know,\nthat's not the entire picture.\nSo, love for you to just educate\nus a bit on what stress is\nand what it isn't, where\nit can be problematic\nand where perhaps it\ncan even be beneficial.\nSo, as a stress scientist,\nit is a word I use a lot,\nbut it has to be broken down\nbecause it has so many different\nkind of dimensions and meanings.\nSo there's good and bad stress,\nthere's acute and chronic\nstress, and you know,\ntechnically it just means\nanytime we feel overwhelmed,\nthat we feel like the demands are too much\nfor our resources.\nSo that's kind of a very\ntechnical way to put it.\nBut really, so much of life\nis about meeting challenges\nand we're never going to get rid\nof different stressful situations in life.\nIf anything, they are increasing.\nAnd so it really comes\ndown to not the stressors\nof what's happens to us,\nbut really how we respond,\nthe stress response.\nSo that's a distinction\nthat we're still trying\nto get the feel, to talk about\nstress in a more specific way\nso that we can think about,\n\"Well, what situations are in your life?\"\nThey might be difficult, ongoing\nsituations like caregiving\nor work stress or worrying\nabout health, your own\nor someone's, and then there's\nhow are you coping with it?\nSo when something happens,\nwe mount a stress response\nand we recover and that's beautiful.\nNo harm done. We need that.\nAnd that's why we're here still alive is\nthat survival response.\nIt's a problem these days of just,\nwe keep it alive in our head.\nWe keep it alive with our thoughts.\nOur thoughts are the most\nwe common form of stress,\nEven though I expected that\nwe would get into tools\nto combat stress a little bit later,\nsince you have now told us that\nour thoughts are the biggest\nsort of propagator of internal stress,\nwhat, to your knowledge, is the best way\nor what are the best ways for us to manage\noverthinking and ruminating\non stressful topics?\nBecause I certainly experience stress\nand when I do, I have tools\nrelated to, you know, breath,\nwork, running, exercise,\nsleep, non-sleep, deep rest.\nI'm a huge fan of all\nthese sorts of things.\nBut when we succumb to stress\nand the thinking patterns take over\nwhere the gears are turning\nand they won't stop turning,\nwhat does the science tell us about ways\nto manage those thoughts?\nShould we work with them\nin the sense that we try\nand rationalize or understand\nthe basis of the stress?\nOr should we try and\ndivert our thinking away?\nOr is there some other\ntool that I'm unaware of?\nYes, yes. Both and.\nRight.\nSo I like to bin it in three categories.\nSo one is well, I'll just\nsay first of all, we have\nto have some awareness\nof how our mind works\nor we are just like, you know, a subject\nto thinking our thoughts\nare real, thinking\nthat it's helpful to keep\nruminating and problem solving\nbecause that's our\ntendency is to go toward\nwhatever we think there's threat or risk\nand to problem solve that.\nBut you could just be stuck\nthere all day in this kind\nof threat mode or red mind state.\nAnd that's just a shame.\nWe don't need to turn on that\nstress response all the time.\nBut that's where we are as a society.\nSo that's why I wrote\n\"The Stress Prescription\".\nTake any survey, even pre pandemic,\nand people feel, the\nmajority of people feel\nan overwhelming amount of stress.\nSo even this past year,\n46% of adults report feeling\noverwhelmed by stress.\nAnd then you break it\ndown, you're like, ooh,\nthis is really bad for young adults\nand women and people of color.\nAnd we, so we have these, you\nknow, groups that are targeted\nfor marginalization that are feeling\nan extremely high amount\nof stress in most of those subgroups.\nSo bottom-\nYeah. Wouldn't you argue\nthat most everyone is feeling\nmore stress now or is it\njust, or what do the data say?\nYeah, so I think that\nwe come with different levels\nof awareness of our stress.\nAnd so when I find someone\nwho really doesn't feel a lot\nof stress, sometimes I\ncan see right through that\nand they're just not aware.\nAnd sometimes it really is true,\nthey're often in a different stage of life\nand they control their environment a lot.\nAnd they've been through a lot.\nI mean, one of the big patterns in the\npopulation levels of stress is that\nthe older people are less stressed.\nPeriod. If you're over 65,\nyou have been through so much,\nsolved so much, you just\nhave a better perspective\non life and on stressors.\nAnd then our adults,\nour young adults have\nlike four times the level\nof stress as our older adults.\nSo, you know, we don't have\nto wait till we get older,\nbut there certainly is true\nwisdom and resilience that\ncomes with age for many people.\nOften we are so used\nto feeling daily stress\nfrom our urban and modern life\nthat we don't notice it.\nWe're just used to it.\nAnd so we're going through the day\nwith kind of like clenched hands\nand just, you know, for listeners,\njust even just taking a check in now\nand noticing how you might be\nholding stress in your body,\nthat's a huge clue.\nIt's a huge place where\nwe accumulate tension.\nSo we might not be aware\nthat we're stressed,\nbut we're clenching our hands.\nAnd in fact, my taxi\ndriver who drove me here\nlet me know that he's exactly that point\nthat he doesn't realize he's\nstressed until he realizes\nthat he's tensing his\nshoulders and his fists.\nAnd so great signal, you\nknow, doing a check-in\nto like notice where in our\nbody we're holding stress is\nstep one to releasing it.\n[Music Playing]"
