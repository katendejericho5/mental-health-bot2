    "transcript": "What were the thresholds\nthat you discovered\nwere important for getting\nthese positive changes\nin such as reduced blood sugar\nor clearance of blood sugar\nbeing more efficient, reduced insulin,\nimproved brown fat\ndistribution and density?\nHow much cold exposure do people need?\nHow much heat exposure do people need\nin order to extract these benefits?\nYeah, so when we then\ncalculated the numbers together,\nwe could see that this was\nended up being 11 minutes\nin total per week.\nSo not in one session, of course,\nbut they had two to\nthree visits to the water\nand the sauna per week.\nSo when we divide that out, it corresponds\nto being in cold water one\nto two minutes at a time,\nbut also in the sauna, 10\nto 15 minutes at a time.\nAnd I think this is very like also similar\nto what we see in other studies\nwhen we look, for example,\nto the observational studies\nfrom the Finnish cohort study\nfrom [indistinct], for example.\nThey published this very\namazing paper in 2015,\nsome results from this long\ncohort study where they show\nthat up to 30 minutes\nin the sauna was healthy\nand you lower your risk\nof cardiovascular disease\nand that's like the threshold.\nAnd if you go further than that,\nthen there is not more healthy\nbenefits to gain from that.\nAnd before that it's like 19 minutes,\nthen you will have this\ndose response relationship\nup to 19 minutes.\nThat's really in decreasing your risk\nof cardiovascular diseases.\nAnd I think we really-\nThat's per week, 90 minutes per week?\n90 minutes per session now.\nPer session, okay.\nYeah, per session.\nIf we then compare that with my study,\nwhich was 10 to 15 minutes per session,\nthen I think it fits very well\nwith what we call the hormetic stress\nor healthy stress that\nyou expose the cells\nto this kind of very stressful situation\nwhere they increase heat\nshock proteins in the cells\nand that will repair the cells.\nBut if you then overdo it\nand you go beyond the maybe\n30 minutes in the sauna,\nthis observational study from Finland\nwith up to 2,000 sauna bathers\nwhere they follow these for 20 years,\nthey see that 30 minutes\nposition is like enough.\nAnd if you go above that,\nyou don't get more health\nbenefits out of it.\nSo I think there's a window\nwhere we can say the healthy stress\ncorresponds to like 10\nminutes and I think it's like-\nPer session.\nPer session.\nAnd it's not much actually.\nSo you don't need to,\nit shows that you don't\nhave to expose yourself\nvery much to the heat or very\nmuch actually to the cold\nto get this healthy benefits\nfrom going into cold,\ngoing into heat and have healthy benefits\non your cardiovascular system.\nSo I think this is very important,\nalso message to get out that\nyou don't have to go extreme,\nyou don't have to swim for a\nhalf an hour in the cold water.\nYou can go in the water for\none to two minutes per session,\nbut go up to 11 minutes per week in total.\nAnd for the sauna, my study showed,\n57 minutes in total per week.\nAnd if we also then divide it\nout on these two to three days\nand two sessions each day\ncorrespond to 10 to 15 minutes.\nSo it's a low threshold,\nbut I think it's good to have that\nto maybe we can aim for that\nif people need to have\nsomething to aim for.\nAnd I think it's really good to have that,\nbecause then you don't overdo it,\nand if you overdo it,\nyou exhaust the cells\nand that will increase your risk\nof cardiovascular disease also.\nWell, I get a lot of questions about this\nand I did solicit for questions\nfor this podcast on Twitter,\nand one of the questions that I got was,\nas one becomes more cold adapted,\ndo the benefits start to wear off,\nor can people do too much cold exposure?\nOf course the answer to that is yes,\nyou can become hypothermic,\nbut I'm sensing a different answer now,\nwhich is, if I understand correctly,\nthe threshold is 11 minutes total per week\nof deliberate cold exposure\ndivided into two or three sessions\nof maybe one to three minutes,\ndepending on how long somebody stays in.\nAnd then 57 minutes,\nI want to be careful not\nto round up to an hour,\nbut divided into maybe three\n20 minute sessions or so,\nyou know, so one doesn't\nhave to be perfect\nas long as you get beyond that threshold.\nBut I wonder something which is,\nis it the case that if\nsomebody said, \"Oh, you know,\nI'm just going to do one\n11-minute session per week,\nthat might actually not be as\nbeneficial as dividing it up\nbecause what you told us earlier is that\nthe hormetic response depends\non having that cold shock.\nYou actually don't want to\nbecome too cold adapted.\nI mean, once the blood\npressure response drops down,\nso in minute four, five, and six,\nyou're getting very cold\nand you're shivering,\nbut you're one is not getting\nthe autonomic stimulus\nthat they want.\nI guess I could liken this to\nif exercise worked in a way\nwhere it was only the first\nfew minutes of exercise\nthat really triggered the adaptation,\nof course this is not how it works,\nbut in fact probably quite the opposite,\nbut if that were the case,\nthen it's not simply the\ntotal amount of exercise\nbut dividing up the\nsessions into little bouts\nwhere every single time\nit acts as a stimulus.\nYes.\nThat seems to be the key here.\nYes.\nThis is very important,\nbecause having watched the landscape\nof this on social media, but\nalso in books and generally,\nI think you're the first\nperson to really touch on this,\nthat the goal is not\nto get so cold adapted\nthat you can sit in for the\nfull 11 minutes in one session.\nWell, the goal isn't to\nbe able to do an hour\nof very hot sauna.\nIf you want to, I suppose\npeople could do it\nfor other reasons.\nYeah.\nBut if the goal is to\nimprove these health metrics,\nthen the idea is to keep\nthe stimulus, a stimulus-\nShort. Exactly, yeah.\nGreat.\nWell this also, I think\nthere's practical feasibility,\nas you pointed out, 'cause\ngetting into a cold shower\nor cold immersion or natural body water\nfor a couple of minutes\nis far less challenging\nto most people than finding\na full morning to go,\nyou know, spend there.\nBut I've never really heard it articulated\nthat the longer sessions\nmight not be beneficial\nand might actually be detrimental.\n[Music Playing]"
