    "transcript": "Let's talk about brown fat,\nand if you'd, if you're willing,\nI'd love to drill into\nbrown fat at a deep level.\nAgain, my understanding of this is,\nis far more elementary than yours.\nObviously, you're the expert.\nMy understanding about brown fat\nis that it's located in\nspecific areas of our body,\nmaybe more widespread than\nwhen I learned in school.\nI thought it was, I was taught\nit was just at the clavicles\nin the back of the neck and upper back.\nBut who knows? I learned\nthat there's more of it\nwhen we're children,\nmaybe more distributed\nthroughout our body and that\nit's rich in mitochondria.\nBut what is so special\nabout the brown fat?\nLike what if we could\njust go into the biology\nof brown fat a little bit,\nwhat does it look like?\nYou've measured it in human subjects.\nWhere is it distributed really?\nCan it expand its distribution?\nCan we activate\nand expand the amount\nof brown fat as adults?\nAnd for those of you that are\ncringing already thinking,\nwe're talking about getting\nfatter, it's quite the opposite.\nWe're talking about not subcutaneous fat,\nbut fat located around the organs.\nBut please educate me,\ntell me where I'm wrong,\nand expand my knowledge on brown fat.\nOkay, yeah, you are not wrong,\nbut it's definitely, it's true\nthat there are more locations\nof the brown fat than\nwe previously thought.\nThere's this very nice study\nfrom 2017 by Leitner et al.,\nwhere they had made these PET/CTs overlays\nof their subjects where you can see\nwhere in the body do we have brown fat\nand where can we grow\nmore brown fat, so to say.\nSo the brown fat is, can, is very plastic.\nSo it means that it can\ngrow and it can decrease.\nAnd this is proven in studies\nwhere we have seen people\nwith a pheochromocytoma,\nit's like a very specific cancer type,\nwhere people where from the 70s,\nwhere we can see that if\nthey have this specific kind\nof a cancer type, they have a tissue,\nthey have this tumor on the adrenal gland.\nSo they have like an, a huge\nincrease in noradrenaline.\nAnd because of that, they have\nthis continuous activation\nof the brown fat and they have grown a lot\nof brown fat in the\nwhole body or abdominal,\nwhere it's located in\nthese six different places,\nbut it is less like very much compared\nto like normal people.\nAnd what they then see, what\nwe learn from this study\nis that brown fat can apparently grow\nif you have an increase in\nnoradrenaline in the body.\nIt's not like you want that\nbecause when that happens, you\nhave a high blood pressure,\nyou don't want it chronically, right?\nYou just want it on like\na short amount of time\nand then it can grow for a bit.\nBut you don't want it\nchronically, of course not.\nBut because it activates\nalso your sympathetic nervous system.\nSo they have also showed\nthey had high blood pressure.\nThey had, they lost a\nlot of weight of course,\nbecause this is activating\nyour metabolism.\nSo they found luckily that\nwhen they removed this benign tumor\nthat the brown fat decreases\nagain to normal size,\nand they gain weight again,\nand they had normal blood pressure.\nSo the story ends well,\nbut it's kind of like proof of concept\nof that brown fat can actually grow.\nSo it's plastic in its way\nof like it can grow and\nit can decrease again.\nSo that's very good, good\nstudies to see what it,\nwhat the body's capable of.\nBut we don't of course\nwant all that brown fat.\nWe just want it to be, we\njust want to keep it actually,\nand keep it activated.\nBecause what we see in studies is also\nthat after the age of 40, people,\nstudies have shown that\nthere is an association\nwith having less brown\nfat, but increased obesity.\nSo of course, we don't know\nyet whether brown fat decreases\nwith age and therefore we get obese\nor we get obese and therefore\nwe have less brown fat.\nBut as brown fat is an\ninsulin sensitive organ\nin our body and we get obese,\njust like the muscles get less sensitive,\ninsulin sensitive, the\nbrown fat does as well.\nAnd therefore it maybe\ndecreases, it could be a theory\nthat I think could be one of the reasons\nwhy we don't see that much\nbrown fat in elderly people.\nSome have a lot, especially\npeople working outside\nthat there are studies showing this.\nWho, people who?\nWork outside.\nDo physical work outside?\nOutside, yeah.\nFarmers and?\nYeah, yeah.\nInteresting.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nThey expose themselves to it,\nso they'll just keep it in that way.\nIt's, and I suppose we should clarify\nfor people in case they don't\nknow that insulin sensitivity\nis a very good thing,\nyou want that.\nYeah, yeah.\nYou want your cells to\nbe sensitive to insulin.\nInsulin insensitivity is Type two diabetes\nand is associated with obesity.\nSo just a point of clarification there.\nYeah, it's interesting to me.\nI usually work out at home,\nbut I go to a gym once\nor twice a week if I can\nbecause it's good if I\nsee the outside world.\n[expert laughs]\nAnd there are a few\nindividuals at the gym,\nwho are, they're not\nparticularly large or muscular,\nbut they are incredibly lean\nand their posture is great,\npresumably from the musculoskeletal work,\nand they're in their 70s and 80s.\nI mean, it's remarkable,\nright?\nYeah.\nAnd I know all the telltale\nsigns of hormone augmentation.\nI'm very good at spotting that\nthere are a few telltale\nsigns, I've talked about this\non other podcasts, and\nthey're not, they're,\nthat's not why they're fit.\nThey're clearly of that look,\nand you see this outside\nthe gym too, of course,\nfor people that look\nlike they've done a lot\nof physical labor their whole life.\nYeah.\nThey're just moving a lot.\nThey have strong hands and features,\nand they're not necessarily\nexcessively lean,\nbut you can tell that they've been\nusing their musculoskeletal system.\nYeah.\nAnd I like to talk to these people\nand ask them like, not\nwhat are you doing now\nfor your workout, but what\ndid you grow up doing?\nYou know, and I would say,\nand obviously I haven't\nrun statistics on this,\nbut more than 75% of them respond\nthat they grew up on a farm\nor that they did some sort of\nmanual labor or were a postman\nor a postwoman or doing\nsomething where they moved a lot\nfor their early years and\nthroughout middle age.\nAnd most of them are now in retirement,\nbut some of them are still working\nand they all still moving a lot.\nSo the relationship between shiver\nand brown fat makes sense to me.\nBut is it the case that as\nwe're just moving around,\nI've heard of NEAT, non-exercise\ninduced thermogenesis.\nSo if we're just moving around\nthat we are activating brown fat\nor does there need to be this stressor?\nDoes there need to be\nshiver and a cold stimulus\nor a heat stimulus to\nactivate the brown fat?\nIn other words, is just\nstaying active enough\nor do we need to do some sort\nof temperature shock type thing,\nlike deliberate cold exposure?\nYeah, I think that is really good question\nbecause how,\nalso, why do we have\nthis tissue then if it's,\nif it has to be extreme\nthen you can question\nwhat do we need this tissue for?\nBut it seems that you can\nactivate the brown fat\nwith just a little bit\nof exposure to cold.\nSo cold is the most\npotent stressor activator\nof our brown fat\nbecause it's our temperature\nregulating organ in our body,\nso first responder to that,\nso the muscles will be\na little bit too late,\nand therefore we have maybe\nthese two kind of tissues.\nSo actually just exposing yourself\nor a hand actually just to cold water.\nSo studies have shown that\nif you just put your hand\nin cold water, not that you're going to,\ngoing to do that all day\nor every day or anything.\nIt's not something you have to do,\nbut it just shows that you\ncan activate your brown fat\njust by getting a temperature\nchange on your skin.\nSo you can go outside in T-shirt,\nthat's why also we were\njust talking about,\nwell, people who works\noutside or move a lot\nor get out in and out of it,\nlike changing the temperature\nof their body all the time,\nthey will have more brown fat,\nand activating that is going\nto keep your metabolism higher.\nAnd your insulin sensitivity\nstudy have also shown this.\nSo the brown fat can be activated\nas soon as you just change\nyour temperature in the skin.\nSo going outside in a T-shirt,\nwearing cooling vests,\nalso, studies have shown this for 10 days,\nit's going to also grow your brown fat,\nso you can get more brown fat\nif you expose yourself to the cold.\nYou don't have to start in a cold shower,\nyou don't have to start in a cold plunge\nif you're not really ready for that yet.\nBut just exposing yourself to\nthe cold wind has also shown\nto activate your brown fat.\nOr if you don't want to be\nlike in this awake state,\nthen you can also just sleep in the cold\nand you won't notice it that much maybe.\nBut studies have shown that if you sleep\nin 19 degrees Celsius,\nthen you will activate your brown fat,\nand you will grow your brown\nfat, so you have more of it.\nSo this in very nice studies\nfrom Hanson et al. from 2017\nshowed that a group of subjects,\nwho slept in a room at 24 degrees,\nand then they made this\nPET/CT scannings to see\nhow much brown fat do they\nhave from the beginning,\nso what we call baseline,\nthen they measured again\nafter a month of sleeping\nin 19 degrees, and they saw,\nI think it's remarkable,\njust one month at 19\ndegrees sleeping there,\nthey had a duvet on and they\nwere still had to clothes on\nwhen they're sleeping.\nSo they're under a cover,\nunder a duvet.\nYeah, under a duvet.\nYeah.\nYeah, okay.\nThe subjects were sleeping at 19 degrees\nfrom one month had increased\nits insulin sensitivity.\nThe next month, they slept at 24 degrees.\nThey measured this again,\nand then they had decreased\nactually a little bit,\nand then they slept at 27 degrees.\nSo quite warm room actually\nfor the fourth month.\nAnd they saw a even less\nactivation of the brown fat\nand also insulin sensitivity.\nSo it seems that you can expose yourself\nand pretty rapidly the brown\nfat will respond to this\nbecause it's so sensitive\nto noradrenaline, right?\nSo if you keep exposing yourself\nto a little bit of cold,\nyou'll also get a little\nbit adapted to it.\nBut that's because the brown fat\nhas grown these more\nmitochondria in the cells.\nSo these small energy fabrics\nthat's going to activate the cells,\nand that's going to take up glucose,\nand fat from the fatty\nacids from the bloodstream\nto keep the thermogenesis up,\nand that's going to clear up some sugar,\nand it's going to clear,\nso in the bloodstream,\nand some fat as well.\nSo the brown fat can in that\nway decrease our unhealthy fat,\nwhich is the white fat.\nAnd the white fat is what\nwe don't want too much of,\nbut we still need some of course.\nAnd it's our energy storage.\nSo it's very important that it's there.\nWe just don't need a lot of it.\nSo on our thighs and also\naround our inner organs,\nthat's where it's located.\nSo if we can have\nactivation of the brown fat\njust by going out in the cold\nand just by sleeping in a cold room,\nor if you are have courage for it,\nyou can go out and expose\nyourself in a cold plunge.\nCold showers is also\ngoing to do the trick.\nSo you can do different\nvariations of this,\njust exposing yourself\nto various temperatures is\ngoing to activate the brown fat\nbecause it was evolved\nto keep us in a perfect\nhomeostatic balance\nregarding temperature.\nSo to keep us alive.\n[Music Playing]"
