    "transcript": "So let's talk about psilocybin journeys\nfrom the subjective side\nand from the structural side\nand when I say the structural\nside, what I mean is\nwhat does a psychedelic\njourney actually include?\nAnd here are the words set and setting\nbecome extremely important.\nSome of you have may have\nheard that set and setting\nare the foundation of a well done or even\ntherapeutically beneficial\npsychedelic journey\nand all of that really hinges\non safety and outcomes.\nSo set refers to mindset,\nthe mindset of the person\ntaking the psychedelic\nand setting refers to,\nas the name suggests, the\nsetting in which they're\ntaking it in and the people\nthat are present there,\nso let's talk about setting first.\nThe setting for a psychedelic\njourney needs to be\none in which the person\nunder the influence\nof the psilocybin or\nother psychedelic is safe.\nThat means no windows\nthey can jump out of,\nthat means no streets of moving\ncars they can run out into,\nthat means no opportunity\nfor getting lost,\nthat means no opportunity for\ngetting into bodies of water.\nIn other words, it requires\nthat there be at least one\nand perhaps even two or\nmore other individuals\nwho are not also taking\npsychedelics, right,\nwho are not also taking\npsychedelics present in that setting\nto ensure that the person\ntaking the psilocybin\nis not going to harm themselves or others.\nI say this not to sound\nlike a school teacher,\neven though technically\nI'm a school teacher,\nbut because of course I don't\nwant anyone to get harmed\nand I'm also aware that there's\na lot of interest nowadays\nin psychedelics such as\npsilocybin becoming legal\nor decriminalized for their\ntherapeutic applications.\nAnd if we look back to the\nlate 1960s and early 1970s\nwhen the Controlled\nSubstances Act was invoked\nto make psychedelics\nlike psilocybin illegal,\none of the bases for that was not\njust the geopolitical unrest at the time\nand things like the\nVietnam War, but also some\nhighlighted instances in\nwhich people did not take set\nand setting into consideration.\nTook things like LSD stared\nat, the sun, went blind\nor took psilocybin, went out\nand harmed somebody else.\nAgain, these are very,\nvery isolated instances,\nbut these are the exact sort\nof instances that lead to\ncriminalization or the fact\nthat things like psilocybin\nand LSD and MDMA for that\nmatter, are considered illegal.\nAgain, I completely acknowledge\nthat there are a number\nof different factors making them illegal,\nwe could have a whole\ndiscussion about that.\nYou know, we talk about the\ndrug trade, the war on drugs,\nbut right now is such a\ncritical time in the history\nand the use of psychedelics\nfor therapeutic\nand other reasons and\ngetting setting correct,\nmeaning making it absolutely\nas safe as possible\nfor the person taking the\npsychedelic is absolutely key.\nAnd one of the best ways\nto ensure that it's safe\nis to have responsible\nindividuals who are not under\nthe influence of psychedelics\npresent in that environment,\nso that's one component of setting.\nThe other component of setting\nthat we talked about earlier,\nwhich turns out to be very\nimportant, is the opportunity\nand perhaps even the bias\ntoward the person on the\npsychedelic being seated\nor ideally lying down\nand being in the eye mask,\nor at least having their\neyes covered so that they\ncan combine any spontaneous\nvisual hallucinations that\noccur with the various\nthought processes that are\noccurring while under the\ninfluence of psychedelics.\nThis is far and away different\nthan quote unquote taking\nmushrooms and going into the\nwoods or taking mushrooms\nand going to the beach.\nWhat we're talking about today\nis the use of psychedelics\nfor particular brain\nrewiring outcomes that yes\ncan involve things like\nchanging one's relationship\nto nature or changing one's\nrelationship to somebody else\nby interacting with\nnature or somebody else.\nAnd while I'm not trying to\ndiminish the potential value\nof those sorts of psychedelic journeys,\nif we look at the scientific\ndata, the vast majority of it,\nnot just in the clinical\nsetting, but in terms of\nunderstanding the safety and\nefficacy and positive rewiring\nof brain circuitry that\nallows people to feel better,\nto understand themselves better\nand to interact with life\nin more adaptive ways going forward out of\nthe psychedelic journey\ninvolve these very,\nlet's say, you know, subdued\nsettings that are typically\nin one room, a closed\nenvironment with one or two other\nindividuals acting as\nsort of guides or helping\nthe individual by talking\nto them from time to time\nif they feel like they\nhave to sort through\na particular aspect of\nthe psychedelic journey\nthat's creating anxiety.\nAnd we'll talk about the contour\nof the psychedelic journey,\nthat almost everyone who\ntakes psilocybin at somewhere\nbetween 20 and 30 milligram\ndosages tends to experience.\nBut the setting that I'm\ndescribing is not just a list\nof things to, you know\nmake sure you're safe,\nbut they're really the list\nof things that also ensure\nthat one can get the\nmaximum benefit out of\nthe psilocybin journey.\nNow, other things included\nin setting that are known,\nagain from scientific literature\nto be very influential\nin terms of the experience\nthat one has and to bias things\ntowards a positive experience\nare again safety, eye mask,\nbut also the presence of music.\nNow, when I first heard\nabout this from one of the\npremier researchers on psilocybin\nand other psychedelics,\nwhich is Robin Carhart-Harris,\nhe's a professor\nat University of California San Francisco,\nwho's one of the major\npioneers in the studies\nof psychedelics.\nAnd when he first started telling\nme about the critical role\nthat music plays, I thought,\nokay, that makes sense.\nYou know, music can impact our emotion,\nimpact the way that we think\nand could therefore impact\nwhat one experiences during\nthe psychedelic journey.\nBut he really underscored for\nme the extent to which music\nis not just a sort of incidental\nfeature of the setting\nin psychedelic set and\nsetting, but that it is one of\nthe major drivers of the actual cognitive\nand emotional experience that somebody has\non something like\npsilocybin that allows the\npsilocybin journey to\nbe looked at or viewed\nnot just as beneficial and this is quoted\nin the scientific literature\nas one of the most profound\nand important positive experiences\nthat one ever experienced\nin their life.\nSo let's talk about the\nsorts of music that have been\nused in these clinical studies.\nWell, first of all, we need to think about\nhow long the psilocybin\njourney itself is going to be.\nAnd the typical duration\nof the psilocybin journey\nis anywhere from four to six hours.\nIt's going to depend\nsomewhat on dose, it's going\nto depend somewhat on\nvariability in people's\nliver metabolism and it's also\ngoing to depend somewhat on\nhow much food people have in their gut.\nIn all the clinical studies that I read,\nit was advised that people\nnot have any food in their gut\nat the time in which\nthey ingest or injected\nwith the psilocybin.\nIt's particularly true of\npeople are going to be taking\npsilocybin mushrooms in\norder to get their psilocybin\nand that has been done in a few studies.\nMost studies, however,\nuse synthetic psilocybin\ntaken orally.\nAgain, that's converted\npsilocin in the gut\nby the acidity of the gut,\nand the acidity of the gut\nis going to be impacted\nby the various foods\nthat people eat.\nAnd so that's one of the\nmajor reasons why people\nare advised to not eat\nfor at least four hours\nprior to the psilocybin journey.\nSo here we've got this six hour,\nwhat we're calling journey,\n'cause that's what\neveryone calls it or trip\nthat people start experiencing\nabout 30 to 45 minutes\nafter ingesting psilocybin\nor taking psilocybin.\nThere's a peak component\nin which there's a maximal\nintensity of emotion and\noften that's also associated\nwith anxiety and this is\nvery important to understand,\nthe anxiety component\nis part of what in the\ntherapeutic setting they're\nreferred to as ego dissolution\nand that anxiety around the peak.\nAnd I think most people would\nprobably hear peak experience\nand think, oh, we're talking about\na peak positive experience.\nBut no, we are referring\nto a peak experience\nand anxiety that people\nstay with and then come down\nfrom gradually as one goes from the second\nor third hour after taking\npsilocybin and that tapers off\nslowly toward the six hour mark.\nWhat sometimes people refer\nto as parachuting back in,\nof course they're not.\nHopefully, I would very much\nhope people aren't actually\nparachuting back in while on psilocybin,\nbut I think you get the idea.\nThe music that's typically\nplayed in the clinical studies\nusing psilocybin for the\ntreatment of depression\nor for compulsive disorders or addiction,\ntends to have a particular\ncontour that matches with\nand can also drive that contour\nof the psilocybin journey\nthat I just described.\nAgain, we're talking about\npeople wearing an eye mask\nwith guides presence,\nso people who are not\ntaking psilocybin there as\nwell to ensure that the person\nfeels supported and is safe.\nThe person is typically lying\ndown, sometimes sitting down,\nbut more often than not lying\ndown wearing an eye mask\nand the music that's\nplayed at the beginning\nof the psilocybin\nsession tends to be music\nthat doesn't have a lot of vocalizations,\nit tends to be things\nlike classical music,\nit tends to be fairly low\nvolume, but that then transitions\ninto music that has a lot of percussion.\nSo often drums that\ntends to be higher volume\nthat has a lot of intensity at\nabout the time that one would\nbe experiencing the peak in\nemotion and in perception.\nThe so-called Peak of the\nJourney, that intense music\ntends to be played for about\n45 minutes to 90 minutes,\ndepending on the study one looks at,\nand then tends to transition\ninto softer music again,\nsometimes choral type\nor more melodic music,\noften female voices in\nparticular, and then transition\ninto nature sounds and things\nthat more or less mimic\nthe outside natural world\nand less so synthetic things\nlike drums or instruments\nand vocalizations\nand things of that sort.\nSo why would it be so\nimportant that music match\nand even contribute to\nthe subjective experience\nthat people have on psychedelics?\nAnd here we should probably\ntake a couple of moments\nand just talk about what\nthose subjective experiences\nare like.\nSo for people that haven't done psilocybin\nor any psychedelics, it's\na little hard to describe,\nbut one way to describe it\nis that there's a lot of,\nso-called perceptual blending.\nSo for instance, people in the\neye mask will report seeing\nsome geometric shapes and\ncolors, but perhaps the music\nthey're listening to will then\nstart to change the intensity\nor the movement of whatever\nit is that they're seeing\nhallucinating inside\nof the eye mask in ways\nthat are linked.\nThis is referred to as\nsynesthesia or the merging\nof different senses that\nare not ordinarily merged.\nIn addition, people under\nthe influence of psilocybin\nor other psychedelics for that matter,\noften will report that\ntheir pattern of breathing\nbecomes linked to the\nperceptions of things\nthat they are hearing\nor seeing or feeling.\nSo for instance, if they\ntake a big deep breath in\nand then a long exhale\nout, they may find that\nduring the long exhale out\nthat the notes of music\nthat they're hearing in those\nmoments are also drawn out\nfor the duration of the\nbreath and they'll inhale\nand that they're getting\nat least what they perceive\nas control over the\nmusic, which of course,\nthey're not actually controlling\nby using their breath\nand that perhaps their\nvisual perceptions are\nalso being merged with that.\nSo those are just a\ncouple of examples of how\nperceptual blending AKA\nsynesthesia can occur\nwhile under the influence of psilocybin\nand this really is highly\nindividual from one person\nto the next.\nSome people, for instance,\nwill find that if they\ntake their fingertips and you\nknow rub them across the couch\nor the chair, that they\nhappen to be lying down\nor sitting on that they\nwill experience a change\nin the music.\nMaybe even if they, you know\nthey move their hand up,\nthey hear an increase\nin frequency of sound,\nthey move their hand down, they\nhear a decrease in frequency\nof sound, and that all of\nthis is linked to their\nemotional state at the\nsame time and vice versa.\nOkay, so we're talking\nabout a lot of perceptual\nand emotional blending\nand some sense of control\nover one's perceptions and\nemotions in a way that's very\nunordinary even extraordinary.\nNow we can step back from all of this\nvery subjective description\nof the psychedelic journey\nand ask what is going on that\nwould allow these sorts of\nthings to occur?\nAnd there you are already\nequipped with an understanding\nof the cell biology and the\nchemistry that makes all of this\npossible.\nAnd that is that when\npsilocybin is ingested\nand then converted to\npsilocin, and it's the psilocin\nthat crosses the blood brain barrier.\nAnd then even though psilocin\nlooks a lot like serotonin,\npsilocin has this incredible\nability to predominantly\nactivate the serotonin 2A receptor.\nWell, we can understand\nmuch of what's happening\nat a subjective level during\nthe psychedelic journey,\neven right down to the sorts of emotions\nand perceptual blending the synesthesia.\nWe can understand a lot\nof that by understanding\nwhere the serotonin 2A receptors\nare expressed on neurons\nand what those particular\nneurons are doing.\nAnd the simplest way to\ndescribe this is that\nthere's a category of neurons that we call\npyramidal neurons.\nPyramidal neurons are found\nlots of places in the brain,\nbut they're called pyramidal\nneurons, 'cause they're\nshaped like a pyramid.\nThey have a cell body, which\nis the part of the cell\nthat has the DNA in it, and a\nlot of other important things\nlike the organelles,\nmitochondria, et cetera\nand then they also have\nwhat are called dendrites.\nDendrites are the little\nbranches or processes\nthat reach out both from\nthe bottom of these cells\nand then these pyramidal\ncells are interesting,\nbecause they also grow a\nbranch up, up, up, up, up\ninto layers of neural tissue above them,\nand they have what's\ncalled an apical branch.\nThat's the part that grows\nup and then they fan out\nat the top and that fanning out at the top\nallows 'em to communicate\nwith other neurons\nin their environment.\nOkay, so if you're not\ngetting a good picture\nof this in your mind from\nmy description, I apologize,\nbut simply think about putting\nyour arms out to the side.\nAnd by doing that, you're\nable to interact with things\nthat are some distance\nfrom your body, sort of\nan obvious thing in that case.\nThese cells are effectively\ndoing the same thing\nby extending little processes\nout into layers above them\nand to the sides.\nAnd this is really important\nbecause much of the\nserotonin 2A receptors\nthat are present on neurons\nin the brain are present\nin those apical dendrites,\nthose branches of these foraminal neurons\nthat are above and that\nextend out to the side\nof those neurons.\nAnd so when somebody is under\nthe influence of psilocybin,\nthat means that psilocin\nhas bound to the receptors\non those apical dendrites,\nand it's increasing\nlateral communication across brain areas.\nIn fact, this is perhaps one of the most\nwell-documented effects of psilocybin\nand other psychedelics,\nwhich is that there's a shift\nfrom the brain being more\nmodular, meaning more segmented\nlike auditory neurons or\ncommunicating electrically\nand chemically largely with\nother auditory neurons.\nOf course, they'll\ncommunicate with other types\nof neurons too, right?\nWhen I hear something off to\nmy right, you know like a snap\nof fingers off the\nright, I'll turn my head.\nAnd the my ability to do that\ndepends on my auditory neurons\nbeing linked up with\nthings like my motor system\nand my visual system.\nBut the key thing to understand is that\nwhen there is psilocybin\npresent in one system,\nthat the communication of any\nof these pyramidal neurons,\nthe ones involved in hearing,\nthe ones involved in thinking,\nthe ones involved in\nmemory, the ones involved\nin visual perception or in the generation\nof visual hallucinations with eyes closed,\nthose are all talking to\nmany, many more other neurons\nmore extensively.\nSo what happens effectively\nis that there's a reduction\nin the modularity, the\nseparateness of function\nin the brain, and an increase\nin what's called integration\nof communication across\nwhat would otherwise be\ndisparate brain regions.\nWe can say that really simply\nby saying psilocybin increases\ncommunication across the brain.\nNow, in addition to\nthat, there's a reduction\nin what's called the hierarchical\norganization of the brain.\nTypically, sensory information comes in\nfrom the outside environment.\nSo we hear something, we see something,\nwe taste something, we smell something.\nAnd in what's called bottom up fashion,\nmeaning bottom from the\nperiphery up, meaning it\npropagates up through the\neyes, through the nose,\nthrough the ears, through\nthe skin, or the senses\nin those regions, I should\nsay, up into areas of the brain\nthat sit deep to the\ncortex, like the thalamus\nand then the thalamus is\nsort of a way station.\nIt's like a switchboard\nthat sends visual stuff\nto the visual centers\nand auditory stuff to the\nauditory centers and touch\nstuff to the touch centers\nand things that maybe trigger a memory off\nto the memory centers\nof the brain, et cetera.\nThat's the typical\norganization, it's hierarchical\nbecause it goes from the\nperiphery up to the more\ncomplex processing regions of\nthe brain that make decisions,\nthat link all of that\nstuff to prior experience,\nmaybe plans about the future.\nWhen psilocybin is present in the system,\nthere's a broadening of the\nflow of that information\nfrom the bottom up as well.\nAnd that has to do with\nwhat's called thalamic gating,\nthe thalamus is a very\ninteresting structure.\nWe probably don't want to go\ninto it in too much detail right\nnow, but it really is like a\nswitchboard in a way station\nsaying, \"Hey, pay attention\nto the visual stuff.\nPay attention to the auditory\nstuff, or just to the visual\nand auditory stuff and ignore,\nyou know touch sensation\nfor the time being.\" or vice versa.\nWhen psilocybin is present in the system\nand when serotonin 2A receptors\nare activated very strongly,\nthere's a tremendous broadening\nof the flow of information\nup and through the thalamus.\nSo not only is there more\ncommunication of so-called\nhigher order brain centers, we\nrefer to them as higher order\nbecause they're involved in\nthinking and decision making\nand emotion, et cetera.\nBut there's also a shift in\nthe flow of sensory information\ninto the brain that can\ngenerally be described\nas broader and including\nmore blending of the\ndifferent senses.\nAnd when I say blending of\nthe senses, I'm also referring\nto blending of the sense of interoception,\nof our sense of our body\nand what's happening inside\nof our body.\nAnd this without question at\nleast partially explains why\nwhen under the influence of psilocybin,\none's breathing can be linked to a sound,\nand then suddenly the sound\none thinks is being controlled\nby one's breathing, or that\nthe sound itself can be linked\nto something that we see in our mind's eye\nwhile in the eye mask.\nEssentially what I'm\ndescribing here is that\nserotonin 2A receptor activation\nallows for more broad,\nless precise and less\nhierarchical activation\nof brain circuitry.\nAnd when I say hierarchical,\nwhat I mean is that\nnormally things go from\nperiphery, from eyes to thalamus\nto visual cortex.\nHowever, when under the\ninfluence of psilocybin,\nas I mentioned before,\neven in the eye mask,\nthe visual cortex is\ngoing to be very activated\neven in the absence of any visual input.\nSo then if one hears a\nsound perhaps from music,\na particular motif or\nvoice, and that's linked to\na particular emotional state\nthat is now being blended\nwith visual phenomenon\noccurring within the brain\nthat have no external stimulus.\nAnd so while the patterns\nof activation in the brain,\nwhile under the influence\nof psilocybin aren't random,\nthey are far less\nchanneled, far less modular,\nand far less hierarchical than\nwould ever be the case when\nnot under the influence of psilocybin.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
