    "transcript": "I'd like to start off by\njust asking for all of us,\nare there some simple\nor perhaps not so simple\nquestions that we can reflect on\nthat give us a sense of\nhow good a parent we are\nor would be based on, I don't know,\nour previous parent-child relationships,\nour relationship to self?\nLike, what kind of things come to bear\nwhen we think about really\nhealthy relationships?\nI can start rattling off a list\nof what I imagine they could be,\nbut what are your thoughts?\nLike, what's the parameter\nspace, as we say?\nHow should we think about\nrelationships besides just,\noh, I either like this person or don't,\nor I feel good around them or I don't,\nor separating how I feel about them versus\nhow they make me feel?\nMaybe we can drill a little deeper below\nthe kind of more superficial stuff\nthat we often see out there.\nThe first thing that comes\nto mind when you say that\nis this word sturdiness.\nAnd to me, when someone says like,\nwhat is good inside is an approach,\nand that's always the first\nword that comes to mind,\nand I know that's like an odd word.\nIt's not a word we use a lot,\nalthough I do think most people,\nwhen you say that person's\nlike a really sturdy person,\nI think we all have some connotation\nor feeling at least of what that means.\nAnd I use it a lot, being a sturdy parent,\nbeing a sturdy leader.\nI talk a lot about the\nsimilarities to parenting\nand kind of being a pilot of a plane,\nand that word sturdy always comes up.\nAnd so I remember a little\nwhile ago someone pushed me,\nthey're like, \"What's your\ndefinition of what that means?\"\nAnd at that point I thought,\nwow, I should probably have a definition,\ngiven I use it a lot.\nBut what I think it\nreally means is an ability\nto be connected to yourself\nand to someone else at the same time.\nAnd I think that is really the definition\nof sturdy leadership,\nand that is the key thing that's present\nin a healthy relationship.\nThat at once I kind of know my values,\nwhat I want, what I need,\nI feel like I can be true to that.\nAnd at the same time,\nI can kind of connect to\nsomeone else who probably\nhas different wants and needs\nand maybe even slightly different\nvalues at the same time.\nAnd the thing that that\nleads me to next is\nwhat I think about is like\nfamily jobs and a parent's job.\nSo, in almost any other place,\nyou could assume if I'm getting\na new job at this company,\nlike there's just no way\nI could do my job well\nif I don't know what my job is, right?\nIf you go to your desk\nand your boss is like,\n\"Have a good day, do a good job,\"\nand there's no job description,\nyou'd be like, I think that's impossible.\nBut over and over with\nparents, if I say to them,\nwell, what is your job with your kid?\nOr when your kid is having\na tantrum, or they hit,\nor they're rude, or they lie to your face,\nor anything, what is\nyour job in that moment?\nMost people, very well-intentioned,\neducated people who would\nnever, ever take a job\nif they didn't have a job description,\nthey look at me, they're\nlike, \"I have no idea.\"\nSo how can we do it well?\nHow can we then perform it to a place\nto get to the outcomes we want\nif you don't have the\nfoundation of what your job is?\nAnd to me, I've thought a lot about it.\nI think parents actually have two jobs,\nand it relates to sturdiness.\nSo you'll connect it where\none of our jobs is boundaries.\nAnd to me, boundaries are\nthings we tell people we will do\nand they require the other\nperson to do nothing.\nAnd that's like really important,\n'cause a lot of times we\nthink we're setting a boundary\nwhen actually we're making a request.\nAnd boundaries keep us\nconnected to ourselves.\nThey represent our values\nand our wants and our needs.\nAnd in a parent-child relationship,\nthey also keep our kids safe.\nIf I just know in a simple way, like,\nmy kids watch enough TV today\nand they really have to get\nto bed, and I know that.\nLike, I don't want them to stay up late.\nI kind of know what my family needs.\nI have to set a boundary.\nBut the other part of my job\nis like empathy and validation,\nwhich is a way of\nconnecting to someone else,\nwhere you see someone else's feelings\nand experience as real.\nYou don't agree with it probably,\nyou don't necessarily condone the behavior\nthat's the representation of the feelings,\nbut the feelings themself\nyou need to connect to.\nAnd I feel like those are\nour two jobs as parents,\nand that's really the\nway to be a sturdy leader\nand to be in a sturdy, healthy\nrelationship with your kids.\nWow. So much there, and I love it.\nAnd here's one of the reasons I love it,\nthis notion of sturdiness,\nsomething that I don't\nthink we hear enough about.\nWe hear about resilience, grit,\nalso important terms, but sturdiness,\nas you've described it\nin the job of parenting,\nreally seems to include a lot of verbs,\nnot just nouns and adjectives.\nAnd I'm a huge fan of\nverbs because biology,\nand to some extent psychology,\nyes, also psychology is all about verbs.\nAnd so the labels often are\nmysterious, but sturdiness,\nit just sends a clear message of something\nthat doesn't budge easily.\nBut then as you describe the job\nof being a parent having boundaries,\nand I'd like to drill into\nthat a little bit more,\nhow you view boundaries, but also empathy.\nIt's not a walled off picture.\nIt's one that is semi-permeable.\nAlso, and I confess,\nI'm a bit obsessed with old\nschool psychoanalytic theory,\nnot as the be-all-end-all of psychology,\nbut it also suggests like\nthis other-other relationship,\nlike, I'm a person, I have a self.\nYou're a person, you have a self.\nThis is the opposite of codependency\nwhere obviously dependency\nand two people being,\nquote, unquote, codependent,\ncan be healthy in the context\nof relying on one another.\nBut as I understand it,\nwhen one person has a self\nand another person doesn't have a self,\nor this notion of merging,\nnot just in romantic relationships,\nbut child-parent relationships, you know,\nI'm best friends with my mom or dad.\nIs that a good thing? I don't know.\nBut this notion of\nother-other relationships.\nYes.\nIt's like I'm a self,\nyou're a self, and we each\nsee each other as another.\nAnyway, I think there's\nso much to explore here.\nSo valuable.\nThank you for tuning into the\nHuberman Lab Clips channel.\nIf you enjoyed the clip\nthat you just viewed,\nplease check out the full\nlength episode by clicking here."
