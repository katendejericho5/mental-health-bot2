    "transcript": "There's a wonderful systematic\nreview of a large number\nof studies that have looked\nat mental training and visualization.\nWhat's effective, what's\nless effective across a bunch\nof different disciplines that\ninclude education, medicine,\nmusic, psychology, and sports.\nWe will provide a link to this paper\nin the show note captions,\nbut the title of the paper\nis \"Best practice for motor imagery:\na systematic literature review\non motor imagery training elements\nin five different disciplines.\"\nAs the title suggests,\nit's mainly for motor imagery training,\nbut it extends into music,\nwhich of course involves\nmotor training and execution,\nbut as well as education.\nThis review establishes\na number of different important things.\nI'm going to read off\nsome of the key or highlight takeaways.\nFor instance, I described principle one\nof effective mental training\nand visualization, which is\nthat the visualization be brief\nand it be simple and it be repeated.\nMay ask how many times that\nvery brief, 5 to 15 second\nexercise of going through some\nroutine should be repeated.\nWell, different studies\nhave used different ranges\nof, let's call them repetitions\nin a given training session,\nbut the number that seems\nto be most effective\nis somewhere between 50\nand 75 repeats per session.\nThat brings about the question\nof how long one should rest\nbetween each repeat.\nThis gets a little tricky\ndepending on what you're trying to do.\nRemember that we have\nthis kind of threshold\nof about 15 seconds for completion\nof the entire motor sequence.\nLet's say what you're trying to do,\nlike a golf swing takes you 5 seconds\nto imagine in your mind's eye\nfrom the point where you,\nlet's just say have the ball on the tee.\nYou bring the the golf club up,\nyou might reposition your\nfeet just a little bit,\nyou know, that kind of a little\nwiggle that golf golfers do,\nand then the swing.\nIf that whole thing takes five\nseconds in your mind's eye\nand roughly five seconds\nin the real world,\nwell then you'd be able\nto repeat it, of course,\n3 times in 15 seconds.\nThat would be one repetition,\neven though you're doing it 3 times.\nSo it's one 15 second epoch\nas it's sometimes called, E-P-O-C-H epoch,\nand then you would rest\nfor an approximately\nequivalent amount of time,\n15 seconds or so, and then repeat.\nAnd rest 15 seconds or so,\nand then repeat, rest 15\nseconds and then repeat.\nAgain, 3 golf swings\nwithin that 15 seconds.\nRest, 15 seconds.\n3 golf swings within that\n15 seconds. Rest 15 seconds.\nTruth told, these epochs\nand these rest periods\ndo not need to be exact.\nYou could imagine, for instance,\nthat you get 3 repetitions\nof the swing within 14 seconds.\nWell then do you do another one\nor do you wait until the\nend of that 15 seconds?\nI encourage you not to obsess too much\nabout those sorts of points.\nRather you want to do as many repeats\nas you can in about a 15 second epoch\nand then rest for about 15 seconds,\nand then repeat for a total\nof 50 to 75 repetitions,\nwhich might not sound like a lot\nto some of you,\nmight sound like an awful\nlot to others of you.\nTo me, it sounds like a lot,\nyou know, 50 repetitions\nof something and where you're trying\nto concentrate in your mind's\neye on getting something\naccomplished over and over, over again\nin exactly the same way\nmight seem like a lot.\nWe know based on the learning\nliterature that your ability\nto successfully perform\nsomething in the real world\nwill lend itself to better performance\nof that thing in the imagined world,\nwithin your mind's eye.\nThat's also one of these sort of does.\nBut if you're trying to\nget better at something\nthat you've never performed before,\nyou really should know that.\nThe mental training\nand visualization is\nprobably not the best augment\nto that real world training\nuntil you're able to\nperform it successfully\nin the real world, at\nleast some of the time.\nMental training and\nvisualization can be effective,\nhowever, at increasing the accuracy\nor the frequency at which you can do\nthat real world behavior.\nSo if normally you're only\ngetting the correct swing\nor you're only hitting\nthe golf ball correctly,\nsay 10% of the time,\nmental training and visualization\ncan really help bring that number up.\nBut it is important that you are able\nto successfully complete that\nmotor task in the real world.\nSimilarly for performance\nof cognitive tasks.\nSo say for instance,\nspeaking a new language,\nyou might ask, well, gosh,\nwhat in the landscape of speaking\na new language can be\nrestricted to 5 to 15 seconds\nwhere I could repeat it\nanywhere from, you know,\n1 to 3 times in a given\nepoch and then rest\nand then keep repeating 50 to 75 times?\nWell, there, I would encourage\nyou to pick something\nthat you are able to\ndo perhaps very slowly.\nSo to speak a particular sentence,\nbut with some challenge\nin getting the accent\nand the enunciation right.\nBut you've completed\nit successfully before\nand you want to get more\nsmooth or more fluid with it.\nLikewise, for, you know, playing piano\nor guitar, again, you have to translate\nto the specific cognitive\nand/or motor activity that\nyou are seeking to improve at.\nBut those epochs lasting 5 to 15 seconds\nare really the cornerstone of\nan effective mental training\nand visualization practice.\nAnd the repeated nature of it,\n50 to 75 repetitions in a given session\nis also another cornerstone of\nan effective mental training\nand visualization practice.\nSo says this review\nand some of the other papers\nthat I'm going to get to in a few moments.\nNow, one of the other key components\nof a successful mental training\nand visualization practice\nis how often you perform\nthat mental training and\nvisualization practice.\nAnd again, a number of different\nstudies have looked at this\nthrough a number of different lenses,\nmeaning anywhere from\n2 to 8 times per week.\nIt does appear that\nperforming these sessions\nanywhere from 3 to 5 times per week\nis going to be effective.\nWe could perhaps even say most effective\nbecause most of the, let's just\ncall it the strongest data,\nreally point to repeating\nthese 50 to 75 trials\nof the same thing 3 to 5 times per week.\nSo you can come up with a\nnumber that's reasonable for you\nto do consistently, and you might ask,\ndo you have to continue to\nperform the mental training\nand visualization forever?\nAnd the good news is the\nanswer to that question is no.\nIt does seem that once you\nhave what's called consolidated\nthe motor performance\nor the cognitive performance of something,\nit can be further supported\nor reinforced, that is\nconsolidated in the neural circuits\nthat are responsible for performing\nthat mental or physical task.\nSo in other words, once you\nare performing that cognitive\nor motor task in a way that's satisfactory\nor perhaps just improved,\nperhaps you're not a hundred percent,\nbut it's improved in the real world,\nyou don't need to continue\nto do mental training\nand visualization to maintain\nthat real world performance.\nSo that's a good thing.\nIn fact, the ideal situation\nwould be then to pick a different sequence\nor thing that you're trying to learn\nand do mental training and\nvisualization for that.\nI perhaps might've misspoke there,\nalthough I don't want to edit this out.\nI misspoke in the sense that,\nagain, I said for the thing\nthat you're trying to learn,\nremember, mental training\nand visualization is\ngoing to be most effective\nfor building up the\nnumber of accurate trials,\nor your ability to do something\nwith a greater frequency of\nsomething that you're already\ncapable of doing\nor have done at least\nonce in the real world.\nThis is not to say that mental training\nand visualization can't be\nused to acquire new skills.\nIt can in principle,\nbut it has been shown to be most effective\nfor enhancing the speed\nand the accuracy of skills\nthat one has already\ndemonstrated some degree\nof proficiency at in the real world.\nI think that's important to point out\nbecause we often hear mental\ntraining and visualization\nand this equivalence of perceptual\nand motor experiences in our\nmind's eye to the real world,\nand we think, oh,\nall we have to do is\nimagine doing something\nand we will get better at it.\nAnd unfortunately, that's not the case.\nThe good news is, however,\nif you can do something once,\neven very slowly in the real world\nand then you bring it\nto the mental imagery\nand visualization domain,\nyou can get much faster at it in a way\nthat really does translate\nback to the real world.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
