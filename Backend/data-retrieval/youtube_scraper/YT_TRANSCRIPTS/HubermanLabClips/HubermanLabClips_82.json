    "transcript": "I'm curious whether or not\nwe can just touch on a few of the things\nthat a lot of people wonder\nabout in terms of egg quality.\nAnd if they touch on sperm quality,\nmaybe we can also just mention that.\nBut for instance, does cannabis,\neither by edible, or by smoking cannabis\nimpact egg quality in either direction?\nAlcohol would be the next.\nAnd then I'm going to assume,\nand I have to do this\nstrictly because of\nwhat I understand about,\nyou know, drugs of abuse like cocaine\nand amphetamine, methamphetamine,\nthat none of those can be good\nfor systems of the body\nbecause they provide,\nthey create so much stress for the body.\nBut let's just say alcohol and cannabis.\nI read a statistic when researching\nan episode on cannabis, that shocked me,\nwhich is that 15%, one\n5%, one five percent,\nnot 1.5, 15% of American women,\nat least in this one study, survey,\nreported having consumed\nor smoked cannabis\nduring known pregnancy.\nWhich is wild.\nWild.\nUnless of course I'm just naive,\nand THC is not harmful to the fetus.\nBut I have a hard time believing that.\nSo, what gives?\nI mean, and there, I actually\njust threw in fetal development.\nSo is cannabis, is alcohol\nbad for egg quality?\nSo they're different things\nand they're the same thing in one.\nSo let's answer them each individually.\nSo we'll go with the\none that everybody knows\nand has accepted now that they\nwouldn't have accepted\n40 years ago, right?\nSmoking cigarettes. So\nthat's obviously bad.\nDecreases the number of\neggs you have in the vault.\nSmoking cigarettes actually\ngets into your vault,\ndecreases the number that you have.\nYou have a higher chance of\ngoing into menopause earlier,\nand it increases the risk of\nhaving abnormal chromosomes,\nwhich is what we really think about\nwhen we think about egg quality, right?\nImpacting those miotic\nspindles inside the eggs,\nwhich hold the chromosomes\nin their perfect position.\nThey are associated,\nthey get wear and tear\nfrom things that cause\ninflammation, or are toxic.\nSo cigarette smoke, we\nknow decreases egg quality,\negg quantity, increases miscarriage,\nand then of course has fetal impacts.\nCould I just ask you a question?\nYes.\nWhen we talk about,\nthere's nicotine, which\nitself is not carcinogenic,\nand then there's the smoking process,\nwhich brings in a bunch of other things.\nThe question I know\nis burning in everybody's mind, is vaping.\nYeah, let's-\nRight? Because\nvaping is, I'm very bullish on this.\nI mean, it's very clear that the chemicals\nassociated with vaping are just\noh so bad for everybody's health,\nbut it's distinctly different from saying\nthat nicotine is bad for ones health.\nAnd it can be, but without\ndoing too much of a deep dive,\nare there any data that show\nthat vaping is bad for egg quality?\nOf course, there's not as much data,\nbecause it just hasn't\nbeen around as long.\nBut yes, vaping definitely has chemicals\nthat looks like it's associated with poor\nsuccess rates in IVF cycles.\nAnd that's really kind of one of the most\nfinite measures of egg quality we can see,\nbecause we're really testing the egg\nat a level in a lab,\nversus just, are you\ngetting pregnant naturally?\nAnd sorry to interject again,\nbut anytime a conversation\nlike this comes up,\nespecially between two people\nin the health science space,\nthere are these shouts,\nbecause I hear them, literally,\nwhere people say,\n\"Well, listen, I vaped every day,\nand I've had three healthy babies.\"\nAnd I think that my response is always,\nokay, there's going to be a\ndistribution of responses,\nand then of course, how much healthier\ncould your babies have been-\nHave been,\nhad you not vaped during pregnancy?\nOr vaped prior to pregnancy?\nWell sure. At least-\nI mean, I think these are\nthe key issues that, like,\nyou can't rewind the clock\nas far as I know, right?\nIn the absence of a time machine,\nYou can't rewind the clock.\nSo I mean, basically\neverything you're saying,\nis that smoking cigarettes,\nor vaping nicotine just can't\nbe good for egg quality.\nWe know that.\nOkay.\nWe know that it's not\ngood for getting pregnant,\nwe know that it's not good for sperm,\nand therefore we also know\nit's going to impact pregnancy rates.\nYou know, things like cannabis, right,\ndecreases sperm production,\ndecreases sperm motility,\nchanges sperm morphology, the shape of it,\nchanges the DNA,\nincreases the fragmentation of the DNA.\nIf your partner uses cannabis\nand you get pregnant,\nyou have a higher chance of miscarriage\nbecause of the sperm\nassociation with the cannabis.\nNow-\nEdible cannabis\nas well as smoke cannabis.\nI don't know, right.\nBecause you can't study\nsomething that's illegal.\nSo a lot of this data is just more new,\nand a lot of it's going\nto be observational.\nAnd in states like Colorado and California\nwhere, you know, cannabis\nis essentially legal,\nI'm assuming there are more data.\nBut okay, so smoking and/or vaping,\nnicotine, cannabis\neither edible or smoked,\nvery likely detrimental to egg quality\nand sperm quality.\nYes.\nWhich is not to say\nthat one can't conceive.\nNo.\nIt just means that\nthe quality of your baby,\nyour child, will not be as high\nas the quality of that baby\nif you didn't do that.\nAnd so-\nIs that right?\nYes. And so-\nAnd I'm not trying to demonize anyone\nthat did do this during pregnancy.\nA lot of people didn't know,\nbut this is really about people\ntrying to make choices in\nanticipation of future pregnancy.\nYeah. And when you are trying\nto set yourself up for success.\nBecause we know infertility\nis becoming more common.\nWe don't always know\nwho is going to have it.\nAnd when you find yourself in\nthat position specifically,\nyou now want to optimize\neverything you can.\nSo if there's something that is going\nto make the sperm quality worse,\nand the egg quality worse,\nand your success with treatment lower,\nand your miscarriage rate higher,\nwe're going to recommend\nthat you not do it.\nIf you're trying to\nget pregnant naturally,\nall these things correlate over.\nBut of course, there's always going to be\noutliers and exceptions.\nI'm going to sit here and tell you\nthat the odds of getting\npregnant at age 43\nare less than 3% per month.\nAnd every single person's\ngoing to be like,\n\"But my Aunt Barbara,\"\nor \"I know this person who did.\"\nBecause three percent's not zero.\nAnd you're talking about\nnatural pregnancy there.\nNatural. Mm-hmm.\nBy having intercourse.\nHaving, old fashioned way.\nYes.\nOkay.\nRight. But yes, so\npeople will get pregnant.\nPeople will have healthy children who do\nhave exposures to nicotine,\nto cannabis, even to alcohol,\neven though we know that alcohol\ncan cause fetal alcohol syndrome.\nZero percent of alcohol should be\nthe acceptable level in pregnancy.\nAnd then \"Does alcohol impact fertility?\"\nIt's such a complicated question.\nAnd this is probably due to\nthe amount you consume,\nand the frequency of which you consume it.\nAlcohol is a toxin that\nyour liver must filter out.\nAnd we know it causes inflammation.\nAnybody who's had a fun night with alcohol\nknows they can wake up the next day,\nand they feel different.\nTheir body is processing that alcohol.\nAnd that inflammation,\nespecially if it's\nchronic, chronic exposure,\nwe know chronic inflammation\nis one of the things that we see\nimpacting egg quality and sperm quality.\nSo certainly if you enjoy alcohol,\nit should be something\nthat is done in moderation,\none or two drinks a week at the most,\nand you should not do it at all\nonce you find out you're pregnant.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
