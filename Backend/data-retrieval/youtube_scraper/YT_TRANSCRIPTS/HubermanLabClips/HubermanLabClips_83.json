    "transcript": "I mean, are there things that people\nshould eat and not eat,\nthings that people should\nsupplement and not supplement\nin order to optimize their fertility?\nI mean, this is definitely\nan interest of mine, right?\nAll my fellowship research\ncycles around fecundability\nand natural fertility.\nAnd I think we really do a disservice\nby how medicine really is\ncategorized by organ systems\nbecause we act like things in one place\ndon't impact the other.\nAs if, right?\nBut you have a body and your body\nand especially your hormones\nchange and fluctuate\nand they're meant to.\nThey are meant to be a dynamic system.\nBut the world and the environment of which\nyou are subjecting your body to\nhas proven changes on\nboth hormonal function\nand also when it comes\nto egg and sperm quality.\nAnd so if you are somebody who just wants\nto live your healthiest life\nand have your most regular periods\nand have your hormones as\nwell balanced as they can be,\nfor a lack of a better word,\nwe'll just say that that means\nthat they are functioning normally.\nThen paying attention to the things\nthat you do are really important.\nAnd so, I know this is a big one for you.\nSleep is probably the number\none thing that people don't do\nthat does impact their\nreproductive hormone system\nand therefore can impact\nagain, sperm quality\nbecause sleep is when\nyou have cellular repair\nand when you can drop\nyour inflammation levels.\nWe know that inflammation is just toxic\nto eggs and sperm, it is.\nThe inflammatory environment\nis not ideal for conception.\nAnd then for a female, you\nhave to deal with the fact\nthat you have your egg quality,\nbut you also have how inflammation\nor what you're exposed to\nimpacts your uterine environment.\nSo you have a a twofold situation here.\nSo none of this should be shocking news\nwhen it comes to nutrition,\nbut it is not talked\nabout enough you're right.\nDecreasing inflammation by the\nfoods that we put in our body\nis consistently shown with an\nimprovement in fecundability,\nan improvement in ovulation,\nan improvement in success with IVF\nand a decrease in miscarriage, right?\nHuge studies have looked at these.\nNow, the big caveat is that\nnutrition studies are super hard\nbecause people who\nconsume flax, for example,\ntend to have other good health behaviors\nthat sometimes make it hard\nto identify what flax did\nversus their general\nhealth versus somebody\nwho eats fast food every day.\nSo nutrition studies\ntend to be observational.\nAnd fertility studies are really hard too,\nbecause what endpoint are you using?\nIs it getting pregnant?\nIs it live birth?\nAre you looking at IVF?\nAre you looking at natural fertility?\nAnd we have a lot of\ndifferent overlap that makes\nboth of these a little bit difficult.\nAnd so they are all cohort based\nor population-based\nstudies where you analyze\nhow people perform when it\ncomes to fertility treatments\nor getting pregnant naturally\nbased on their exposures\nto certain things.\nDiets high in fruits and\nvegetables are good for you, right?\nFiber, antioxidants, fruit is not bad.\nFruit got this really bad reputation.\nI love fruit.\nI love fruit too but people\nthink that it has sugar\nand that it's bad for you.\nWell, it has fructose.\nThat type of sugar is not bad for you.\nIf we can just agree\non the fact that fruit\nhas a lot of nutritional benefit,\nespecially when it comes to\nvitamins and antioxidants,\nthat can be extremely beneficial\nin decreasing inflammation.\nGrains, so whole grains\nespecially that your body\nprovide a lot of great fiber.\nSo of course if you have celiac\nor you are gluten intolerant,\nyou're a different category.\nBut there was so much focus on keto\nand people eliminating grains\nas a food group overall.\nAnd even though that might be\nutilized in a dietary strategy\nto lose weight, and losing\nweight can improve fertility,\nlikely because of inflammation\nbeing the primary driver.\nBecause we know that even in\nstudies where I take donor eggs\nand I transfer that embryo into\nsomebody who is overweight,\nthey have lower odds of success\nthan if they were a normal BMI.\nSo we can't act like that\ncausation is just on egg quality\nfrom obesity, right?\nThere's also some inflammation,\nsome inflammatory changes\nthat impact the body's ability or desire\nto allow an embryo to implant.\nSo fruits, veggies, whole\ngrains are all good.\nInterestingly, dairy tends\nto be okay in most studies\nbut what we do see is that if\nyou're going to have dairy,\nhave the real thing, the\nprocessed dairy, the skim milk,\nthat actually decreases your fertility.\nAnd likely because the\nprocessing to make it\nstill look like milk when\nyou take out the fat,\nis adding in things that are unnatural\npotentially impacting your fertility.\nI don't drink milk anymore\nbut when I was a teenager\nI drank half and half.\nI'm not recommending anyone do that.\nRemember I was a skiing teenager.\nYou were trying to bulk up.\nWell, no, I just could afford to.\nAt that age I wasn't trying to at all,\nbut it was just delicious.\nSo cheeses, full fat milk,\nhalf and half yogurt.\nYeah, but don't choose the skim one,\nchoose the actual one that\ncomes with some of the milk fat.\nFat is not bad for you.\nThere's also this, hopefully\nwe're getting away from it\nbut there's been such a low fat craze\nor this real attention that fat is so bad.\nBut fat comes in so many important forms,\navocados and oils and nuts, dairy, meat.\nFat and cholesterol are the\nbackbone for all hormones,\nso you need that in order for\nyour body to make the estrogen\nand progesterone that it needs\nto allow this whole process to happen.\nAnd so there's this idea\nthat those are bad for you,\nthat's just really not.\nSo healthy fats, whole\ngrains, fruits, veggies.\nAnd what about proteins and meats?\nBecause I think within those categories,\nI'm a big fan of sustainably\nlike raised meats if possible.\nSome people choose not to\neat meat, but fish, eggs.\nLove it all.\nOkay, so let's just go through the meats\nand the myth and the fact.\nSo we'll do tofu.\nSo there's this big issue\nthat like tofu has soy\nand that too much soy can be bad\nbecause soy can be a phytoestrogen.\nTofu does not negatively\nimpact fertility even in men.\nIn fact, it can improve it\nbecause it does have some\nantioxidant like properties, lots of iron.\nWhen it comes to fish,\nfish are fantastic sources of healthy fats\nand omega-3 fatty acids\nwhich are very crucial\nin the reproductive process.\nWe do worry about if you're\npregnant having too much fish\nand over exposure to mercury\nand how that can impact\nfetal brain development.\nSo the general recommendation\nis three servings per week.\nLet me guess, a serving\nis like four to six ounces\nas opposed to like a real human that eats\nsix to eight ounces of fish, right?\nYeah, and I think it's important to say,\neven though people will tell\nyou that when you're trying\nto get pregnant with the\nidea of we don't know\nwhen you're going to be pregnant,\nif you're going through things\nlike egg freezing or IVF\nand you know when you're\ngoing to be pregnant,\nI wouldn't feel like you\nhave to restrict yourself\non the consumption of seafood\nduring those time periods\nwhen you know you're not pregnant yet.\nBecause really the concern\nis about that mercury\nand what it could potentially\ndo to a fetal brain.\nAnd raw seafood, correct?\nNo sushi, no sashimi.\nWell, when you're pregnant correct,\nand that's mostly because of\nthe risk of infectious disease\nthat can cause severe brain\ndevelopment and other issues.\nWhat do they do in Japan?\nI don't know, I don't live there.\nThey probably laugh at us.\nThey probably do laugh at us,\nthey probably do laugh at us.\nSomeone who has been pregnant in Japan.\nYeah, reach out, tell us.\nYeah, or conceived in Japan, tell us.\nDon't tell us the story of the conception,\nbut tell us, did you have sashimi?\nOverall meat is a really broad category\nand studies study it differently.\nLike is it all meat?\nAre you distinguishing\nout red meat and chicken?\nAre you putting it all together?\nI mean, obviously I think we\ncan all come to the agreement\nthat processed meats are not good\nfor a variety of different reasons.\nIn addition to being carcinogenic,\nthose toxins do negatively\nimpact fertility.\nSo deli meat, no bueno.\nYeah, but I mean specifically\nthose things like the bacon\nand like the things that are\nreally highly prostate hotdogs,\nsorry, the 4th of July hotdog picnic.\nBut those things really\ndo not provide nutritional\nadvantages and only harm.\nEspecially then when we have red meat.\nFor the most part, red meat\nwhen isolated individually\nand most circumstances in\nmoderation tends to be fine,\nI usually tell my patients\nI want them to eat\na plant forward diet that\ndoesn't mean no meat.\nBut I say, look at your meat servings.\nI don't want it red meat every single day.\nBecause there was a study looking at IVF\nand looking at embryos,\nand the more servings,\na lot of nutritional studies\nbased things on quartile.\nSo who eats the lowest and the second most\nand the third most and the top most.\nAnd people who ate in that\ntop quartile of red meat\nhad lower progression of\nembryos through the culture.\nSo less embryos that developed\nless normal embryos and\nlower success rates.\nDo we know anything about\nhow that meat was arriving?\nNo, Unfortunately we don't.\nAre we talking about\nlike hoagie sandwiches\nor are we talking about\nlike grass fed steaks?\nThese studies are not wonderful\nbut that doesn't mean\nthat they don't hold merit\nin helping us guide counseling.\nBut no, that one was how\nmany servings of red meat\ndo you eat in a week?\nSo we don't really know.\nDoes the really ethically\nsourced the grass fed,\nthis environment which we\nfeel like is much less toxic\nthan potentially let's\nsay like a cattle factory\nwhere the cows are injected\nwith all sorts of things.\nIs there a difference in how\nthose impact your reproduction?\nProbably, right?\nIf this cow is getting injected\nwith a lot of hormones,\nwhy are we thinking that\nit's not impacting the meat\nthat you're then ingesting into your body?\nI think our audience will certainly\nsubscribe to that idea.\nI think most of them will.\nI mean, the notion that like\nthe pollutants you breathe in\nthe air somehow are not\nthe air that you breathe\ninto your lungs is just\nlike completely nutty.\nAnd the idea-\nBut people feel that way\nand they hold strongly\nto this idea that it can't\nbe this thing that I love\nthat is causing this problem, right?\nThe denial of the association between\nwhat we put in and on our body\nand how it impacts our body's function\nis really strong in some people.\nAnd I think it's really just\nlack of education and awareness\nbecause the medical community for so long\ndid not address these factors, right?\nYour doctor never talked\nto you about nutrition.\nAnd so it just became this\nidea that it must not matter\notherwise your doctor\nwould talk to you about it.\nI think sugar is the last\nthing I just didn't mention,\nbut added sugar and artificial\nsugars are bad for you.\nArtificial sugars.\nArtificial sugars too.\nIncluding stevias or plant-based\nlow calorie sweeteners.\nStevia itself hasn't been studied as much\nas the other ones things\nlike sweet and low\nand all of those.\nBut what we do know is that\nthey cause inflammation\ninside the body and\nthen they also can cause\na stress reaction and they\ncan cause higher rates\nof miscarriage when you intake more sugar\nand artificial sugar.\nSo that's a lot to wrap your head around.\nAnd I say the same thing to every patient,\none cake, one this, one hot dog.\nI mean, those things individually are not\ngoing to make a difference, right?\nIt's the choices that\nyou make every single day\nthat are going to set you up\nto be your healthy self or not.\nAnd so you should make choices in line\nwith how you want to treat yourself.\nYou want to be in your best health,\nyou want your hormones\nfunctioning the best.\nAnd if that added helps you\nget pregnant when you want to,\nhelps you have a better\nchance of success with IVF,\noh my gosh, what a fantastic benefit.\nBut that doesn't mean you can't enjoy\nsome of these bad things here and there\nas long as you've set\nyourself up on the day to day\nwhere you're giving your\nbody lots of nutritious food\nthat it needs to make hormones.\nSimilarly, being very underweight\nin calorie restricting\nwe all know is really terrible\nfor your reproductive system\nand can cause the brain to\ntotally shut down ovulation\nbecause it's senses that\nyou can't have a pregnancy.\nIf people miscarry, excuse me by virtue\nof being underweight, does the body,\nlike I learned some years ago,\nI think this is still true,\nthat one of the signals for\nthe onset of puberty in females\nis that leptin, a hormone\nis secreted from body fat\nthat then signals to the\nbrain, to the hypothalamus,\nlike okay, there's enough\nreserves to create environmental,\nit's a signal about environmental.\nThere's enough extra fat to have a baby.\nAnd there's presumably\nenough food around to sustain\nthat baby.\nAre miscarriages and lack\nof body fat correlated?\nOn both ends of the spectrum, yes.\nSo lack of body fat and being overweight,\nwe see decrease in\ngetting pregnant per month\nand we see increase in losing pregnancies.\nSo certainly there is a healthy medium\nwhere your body has what it needs.\nAnd that makes sense because if you have,\nI like to even say\nhypothalamic dysfunction.\nSo maybe your brain is\nnot totally shut off\nwhere it's sending out no\nhormones and you're not ovulating\nbecause you're not getting\npregnant in that circumstance.\nBut certainly ovulation\ndisorders are on a spectrum\nwhere you go from a\nperfectly synchronized cycle\nto one that prolongs it,\ngets shorter together,\nthen prolongs, and then you have nothing.\nThere's this spectrum of dysfunction\nwhich is representing\nyour hormones not being\nnecessarily perfect.\nAnd that can have impacts on the placenta\ntrying to grow into that uterus.\nI mean the placenta is fascinating, right?\nAn entire talk just on the placenta.\nBut it does this incredible\njob where your body\nhas to not reject it\nyet allow it to eat away\nat the side of your uterus and\ngrow into your blood vessels.\nBut that requires a very\nspecific hormonal environment\nfor it to be done and to be done right.\nI think in the same breath of all this\nwhat you're also asking is,\nokay, so that's eating healthy,\nnone of that's really\nnew news for most people.\nA lot of those things I just said.\nBut I do want to thank you\n'cause I think rarely if\never do we hear a physician\nbe really direct about like, hey listen,\nsome red meat, yes.\nNot excessive amounts\nof red meat ideally from\nsustainable sources, whole\nfat milk products, grains,\nfruits, vegetables, I\nmean, those kind of like\nto you seem like\nstraightforward directives\nare actually pretty\nrare in in the landscape\nof public health discussion.\nBecause more often than not,\npeople talk about nutrition\nand these kind of elimination\ndiet type things like\neliminate all the grains\nor eliminate all the meat,\nor eliminate all the milk fats.\nWhen in reality I think people forget that\nlike most people out there are omnivores.\nAnd they can make better\nchoices about not deli meat,\nless bacon if any bacon, right?\nHave some veggies with your lunch, right?\nLike you can make better\nchoices on the day-to-day.\nI think that is a great point.\nI think there's a place for supplements.\nI think the big disclaimer\nthat everybody is going to say\nwith supplements is that\nthey are not regulated\nlike the way medications are, right?\nAnd I will say supplements and\nherbs are different things.\nA supplement, but many\ncompanies are adding herbs\nto their supplements and that can get into\nreally murky territory\nespecially when it comes to how\nsome of these herbs do have estrogen\nand progestin like\nproperties and can impact\nreproduction and hormones\nAnd perhaps even\nandrogenic properties too.\nYes, so we can't act like\neverything is created equal.\nSo I always tell people,\nif I recommend you take a\nsupplement or your doctor does,\nyour due diligence is to\nlook at what is also included\nand make sure it doesn't\nhave these extra added things\nthat they're unaware of.\nBecause sometimes they\ncan have negative impact\nat one stage of your life or another\ndepending on where you are.\nCertainly, a prenatal\nvitamin which has folic acid,\nwe all know that folic\nacid is really important\nto prevent neural tube defects,\nbut it's also important in cell division\nand how the ovary is growing\nfollicles and growing eggs.\nSo should people, women, but also men\nbe taking a vitamin with folic acid\neven when they're not trying to conceive?\nYes, there's no harm in having it.\nBut very often pregnancies occur\nwhen you're not trying to conceive.\nAnd that is a store that\nneeds to be built up\nthree months ahead of time.\nSo we really need you to be taking that\nahead of getting pregnant.\nSo not just, let's get pregnant right now,\nI'm going to start this prenatal vitamin.\nSo I recommend anybody who is\nin their reproductive years,\ntake a prenatal vitamin.\nWe also know that many, many\npeople are vitamin D deficient\nand vitamin D does impact reproduction.\nAnd so I usually say a\nthousand international units\nof vitamin D is not going\nto be harmful in anybody.\nIt's going to be helpful for most people.\nSome people definitely need higher levels.\nSo we screen everybody with a vitamin D\nto see who needs to have extra.\nBut a blanket statement,\nthat extra vitamin D\nis going to be helpful.\nOmega-3 fatty acids\nalso extremely important\nin one being anti-inflammatory,\nbut two, brain development of a fetus.\nSo most prenatals now actually do have\nthose omega-3 fatty acids\nin them, but if they don't\nI recommend a patient take those.\nJust a brief question/insertion there.\nThere's a laboratory up at\nthe University of California Santa Barbara\nthat's published some really\ninteresting data showing that\nessentially brain weight which is just\none indirect measure of brain health,\nbut brain weight at birth\nseems to be correlated\nat least in some positive\nway with the amount\nof essential fatty acids that\nmom consumed during pregnancy.\nDoes that hold?\nYeah, I mean that does\nhold and there's my studies\nabout mice are smarter\nwhen they have diets\nwith omega-3 fatty acids\nwhen they're in utero, right?\nSo the exposure and the time\nperiod is really important.\nAnd omega-3s have a lot of health benefits\nwhen it comes to their\nantioxidant properties,\nespecially like in endometriosis,\ndiseases that are very\nhighly inflammatory,\nthey can be very beneficial.\nWe're definitely going to\ntalk about your work about\nafter baby has arrived and\nimpact of essential fatty acids,\nbut what would you say is the\ndosage cutoff on this podcast\nbefore I've sort of\nthrown out numbers like\none to two grams per day of the EPA form\nof essential fatty acid.\nAnd then we could have\na whole discussion about\nomega-3 omega-6 ratios.\nBut do you think there's a upper limit?\nIs it truly that let's say up\nto four grams per day of EPA,\nwould that be advantageous?\nIs it better than one gram?\nI tell people a gram.\nOkay, that's in alignment with pretty much\nwhat we've talked about before.\nSo that's what I recommend\nwhen I give my handout\nto my patients and they're\ntrying to get pregnant,\nit's going to have a prenatal,\na thousand IUs of vitamin D,\na gram of omega-3s and then CoQ10.\nSo CoQ10 which essentially in general\nis trying to help the mitochondria.\nThat's the whole idea here\nthat it is helping provide support\nacross the body in a lot\nof different ways, right?\nLike CoQ10 is used in a lot\nof different areas of the body\nbut when it comes to reproduction,\nwhen it comes to meiosis\nand cell division and\novulation and egg quality\nand even sperm quality,\nthere's a place for CoQ10\nshowing benefit without harm.\nAnd so as I said earlier,\nnothing's without any\nharm or any risk of harm\nbut very, very little.\nSo I usually recommend if\nyou're trying to get pregnant\nand you take CoQ10,\na dose of 200 milligrams\nthree times a day.\nSo there's kind of a\nhigher dose than sometimes\npeople are on.\nOften prenatals now have\njust like 200 total in it.\nThe expensive ingredients are usually\nthe lower concentrations and the blends.\nThey need just enough so\nthey can put it on the label.\nRight, which includes CoQ10.\nDoes the form of CoQ10 matter\n'cause you'll find them\nin gel capsules, you'll also\nfind them in powdered capsules?\nI always say, I mean there might be\nfor the individual\nperson, I mean, absorption\nof medication is really dependent a lot on\ngut health and other factors.\nBut the number one issue\nwith supplementation\nis that people don't stick to it.\nSo I always say whichever one you're going\nto consistently take is\ngoing to be the better form.\nGreat.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
