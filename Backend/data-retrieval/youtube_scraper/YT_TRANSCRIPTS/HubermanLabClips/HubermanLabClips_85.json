    "video_title": "Why Alcohol Is Bad Prior to Sleep | Dr. Gina Poe & Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "If I go to sleep religiously\nevery night at 10:00 p.m.,\nare there things that I perhaps\ndo in the preceding hours\nor the preceding day, like\ningest caffeine or alcohol,\nthat can make that first\nstage of sleep less effective,\neven if I'm going to\nsleep at the same time?\nAlcohol definitely will do that\nbecause alcohol is a REM sleep suppressant\nand it even suppresses some\nof that stage two transition\nto REM with those sleep spindles.\nAnd those sleep spindles,\nwe didn't talk about their function yet,\nbut they're really important\nfor moving memories to our cortex.\nIt's a unique time when our hippocampus,\nthe sort of like the RAM of our brains,\nwrites it to hard disk,\nand which is the cortex,\nand it's a unique time\nwhen they're connected.\nSo you don't want to miss that.\nYou don't want to miss REM sleep\nwhen is also a part of\nconsolidation process\nand schema-changing process.\nAnd alcohol in there, before\nwe go to sleep, will do that.\nUntil we've metabolized alcohol\nand put it out of our bodies,\nit will affect our sleep badly.\nSo probably fair to say\nno ingestion of alcohol\nwithin the four to six\nhours preceding sleep?\nYeah.\nANDREW: Given the half-life.\nGINA: Given the half-life.\nOr it all would be better-\n[Gina laughs]\nYeah.\nBut I know some people\nrefuse to go that way.\nMaybe a little bit is okay.\nI don't know what the dose response is.\nBut there are studies out\nthere you can look at.\nANDREW: Great.\nYeah.\nSo we're still in the\nfirst stage of sleep,\nand I apologize for slowing us down-\nIt's all right.\nBut it sounds\nlike it's an incredibly\nimportant first phase of sleep.\nGINA: Yeah.\nWhat about the second and third\n90-minute blocks of sleep?\nIs there anything that makes those unique?\nWhat is their signature,\nbesides the fact that they come second\nand third in the night?\nYeah.\nThere's more and more REM sleep\nthe later the night we get.\nThere's also a change in hormones.\nThe growth hormone and melatonin levels\nare starting to decline, but\nother hormones are picking up.\nSo it is a really different stage\nthat you also don't want\nto shortchange yourself on.\nAnd I think that's the stage,\nmany studies are showing\nthat those are the times in sleep\nwhen the most creativity can happen.\nHmm.\nThat's when our dreams\ncan incorporate and put together old\nand new things together into a new way,\nand our schema are built during that time.\nSo yeah, we can change our minds best\nduring those phases of sleep.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
