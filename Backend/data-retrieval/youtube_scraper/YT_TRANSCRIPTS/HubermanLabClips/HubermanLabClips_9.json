    "transcript": "okay so this video is designed to go\nwith the hubman Lab podcast solo episode\nwhere I talk about how to strengthen and\npain prooof your back I'm going to show\nyou the so-called McGill's big thre\nso-called because they were developed by\nDr Stuart McGill an expert in spine\nphysiology I'm also going to show you a\nsoaz stretch and I'm also going to show\nyou a what sort of looks like a cobra\npose in yoga it's a certain kind of um\nup dog push-up where it's not a real\npush-up but that too can be used to both\npain prooof strengthen the back\nespecially if you're experiencing some\nbulging that is some herniation of the\ndiscs one thing to keep in mind is that\nevery body everybody is different in the\nsense that some people can do these\nmovements with a little more arch in\ntheir neck or a little more holding of\nthe neck in neutral position than others\ncan without pain and with stability so\nyou'll see examples of these exercises\nmultiple places online and everyone does\nthem slightly differently what you're\nabout to see are the core elements of\nthe big three the soaz stretch and the\nup dogs or uh Cobra Cobra push-up uh for\nrelieving some stress on impinged nerves\nas a consequence of bulging or\nherniation of the discs again everyone\ndoes these slightly differently work\nwithin the range that is challenging for\nyou but that doesn't cause or exacerbate\nany pain for you all that said the\nexercises I'm about to show you require\nminimal time investment no equipment can\nbe done by most everyone painfree and\nhave been shown to be very beneficial\nfor strengthening and pain proofing your\nback okay so the first exercise in\nMill's big three is the curl-up the curl\nup is essentially where you lie\ndown like so with at first legs extended\nis where you're going to start you're\ngoing to take your hands and with Palms\ndown and you're going to put them in the\nsmall of your back so in the arch of\nyour back and you actually want to\nmaintain that arch in your back probably\nwant to make your spine nice and long\nput one knee up with the leg flat the\nother leg is\nextended and then you're going to again\nkeep the spine long meaning you're not\ngoing to move the chin towards the chest\ntoo much you're just going to keep it in\na neutral position as if you were\nlooking straight forward or in this case\nstraight up at the ceiling and then\nyou're essentially going to you could\nkeep your elbows down or you can float\nthe elbows which is a little bit more\ndifficult I'll float the elbows and then\nyou lift your upper torso just a bit and\nof course the head goes with it but\nyou're not going to lead with the head\nyou're going to lead with the chest okay\nlike so and as you do that I'm trying to\ntalk while I'm doing this you'll feel a\nnice hard contraction in the abdominals\nokay you're going to hold for about 10\nseconds and as you do that you're not\ngoing to want to talk like I am now\nyou're going to want to put the tongue\non the roof of your mouth breathe\nthrough your nose and exhale\nand then you're going to relax down to\nthe floor again set the head down you\nmight want to rest somewhere between 10\nand 30 seconds depending on your\nparticular needs and then you're going\nto raise up your torso leading with the\nchest letting the head\nfollow holding for about 10 seconds you\ncan really get a nice hard contraction\nof the abdominals there which is going\nto help to build stability the reason as\nI described in the episode for doing\nthese 10-second holds as opposed to a\n30- second set or a minute long set is\nthat repeated 10-second holds help you\nto build the neural Pathways that allow\nyou to contract those muscles very hard\nwhich is the goal here so after\nrepeating that say three to five times\nper set okay so one set would be say 3\nto 5 10c holds with 10 to 30 maybe 60\nseconds between each hold that would be\none set with um the knee up you could\nperform multiple sets with this knee up\nand then switch to the other side talk\nabout this in the episode I recommend\nstarting with just one set per side and\nthen progressing to about three sets per\nside you're going to switch to the other\nside in this case so here again it's\nnice long\nspine this leg extended this foot\nplanted with a bend in the knee use the\ntops of your hands so Palms down to find\nthe small of your back\nput your tongue on the roof of your\nmouth float the elbows if you can\notherwise you can keep the elbows down\nif you're not able to do that and then\njust lift the upper torso and hold for\n10\nseconds and down and then you would\nrepeat several times or more for this\nside and then you could go back to the\nother leg or simply do all the sets for\none leg extended then all the sets for\nthe other leg extended I talk about sets\nand Reps Etc in the episode on how to\nstrengthen and pain prooof your back is\na great exercise because it actually\ntakes advantage of the ability to\ncontract the abdominals much harder in\nthis position and more efficiently than\ncrunches done the conventional way and I\nalso talk about in the episode how\ncrunches done the conventional way can\noften exacerbate discernation and\nbulging whereas this should not although\nagain if you experience pain or\nexacerbation pain from doing this you\nshould cease to do it so that's the curl\nup okay so the next exercise in stum\nMill's big three is the side plank and\nthe side plank can be done through a\nnumber of different progressions which\nmany people find they have to start with\nthe easiest one and work their way up to\nthe more difficult forms of the side\nplank so the side plank as the name\nsuggests is where you get on your side\num the easiest way to start this meaning\nto begin this exercise if you haven't\ndone it before is to do a kind of right\nangle Bend in the arm that's in contact\nwith the ground you make a fist on that\nside the knees are bent okay and the\nfeet are stacked and then you're going\nto both lift the hips off the ground but\nalso push down hard with the arm and the\nfist that's in contact with the floor\nthat's important and it essentially\nlooks like this okay so the idea is to\nnot let the hip sag like so to try and\ngenerate as much of a of a hard\ncontraction in the abdominal muscles and\nthe muscles of the core they're on the\nside here okay so that's and the first\nprogression you would hold for 10\nseconds or so I'm not counting exactly\ntongue on the roof of your mouth and\nthen let down\nokay maybe rest 10 30 maybe 60 seconds\nif you need to and then\nrepeat focusing hard on pushing the\nground away the next progression after\ndoing this with the legs and feet\nstacked with the arm at 90Â° would be to\ndo it with the arm straight you can do\nthis with a fist if you're really strong\nI'm still working up to that or you can\ndo it with hand planted like so so I'd\nprobably suggest starting the foot here\ncan really feel a strong contraction\nthere then moving to it with feet\nstacked and this is really fatiguing me\nyou can see some quaking in that arm\nclearly have some progression to work\nthrough and relax\nokay so that's the side plank and of\ncourse you would do it on the other side\nas well like\nso really emphasizing pushing the floor\naway and there are a bunch of variations\non these as well there's some rotational\nstuff you can do so with some people\nlike to do arms ahead or the foot\nfloating those are harder progressions\nyou can find all of these online very\neasily as you can tell because I'm\nbreathing hard now I've worked up to the\npoint where I can do the feet stacked\none for the sets but I'm still working\nthrough the progressions of the side\nplank Okay the third exercise in\nMcGill's big three is the bird dog love\nthat name because I love birds and I\nlove dogs and basically what you do is\nyou're going to get down on all fours\nlike so you're going to at first plant\nyour hands plant your\nknees then what you're going to do is\nyou're going to actively push the ground\naway with one hand that's important\nyou're going to raise up the other one\nand into a fist that's important I\nexplain why in the episode on how to\nstrengthen and pain proof your back and\nthen you're going to extend the opposite\nleg to the one where the arm is extended\nokay so opposite side and I explain the\nlogic behind this in the episode okay\nsome common mistakes are that people\nArch the back too much and ra raise this\nleg too much you don't need to do that\nyou just want to raise it up some people\nwill point the\ntoe it's fine to point the toe or to\njust keep heel to the ceiling you're\ngoing to actively reach with this fist\nout in front okay and you're going to\nactively push down you'll really feel\nthat contraction in the core take some\nconcentration to make sure that you're\nactivating your core tongue on the roof\nof your mouth neck in a you know\nslightly arched position neutral is okay\ntoo looking forward and then if you want\nto make this a little bit tougher you\ncan do some circles or\nsquares with the extended leg and hand\nin both directions\nif you want to make it even harder you\ncan gently while\nmaintaining contraction of the core\ntouch your hand to your knee then back\nout definitely don't just you know swing\nthe hand in and touch your knee go back\nTR move it nice and slow so you can feel\nthe contraction in your\ncore forward and go for at least a 10c\nhold with the repeats as described in\nthe episode before you start doing some\nof these kind of Square movements and\ntouches\nEtc and then down okay and then You'\nrepeat for the other side so actively\npressing down that's a key feature here\nyou know fist out in front and reaching\ntongue on the roof of your mouth\nopposite leg\nextended don't go too high not trying to\nget a steep arch in the lower back just\nget that core contraction take some\nconcentration and then hold for at least\n10 seconds helps to Exhale\nand if you want you can do some of these\nmovements you can do the nice slow\ntouching at the fist to the knee keeping\nthat contraction in the\ncore and\nout keeping contraction in the core and\nout\nbuilding spine and core and upper back\nstability that's the bird dog\nokay so the next exercise is a soaz\nstretch the soaz as described in the\nepisode is a muscle that attaches the\nspine to the pelvis does some other\nthings too it's involved with the\ndiaphragm which of course is involved in\nyour breathing and guess what your\ndiaphragm is also involved in your heart\nrate regulating your heart rate by\nvirtue of how much space there is in the\nthoracic cavity so a lot of interesting\nstuff about the soaz you can read up you\ncan learn more about it in the episode\nbut stretching your soaz is wonderful it\nboth can provide some relief for\ntightness in the hips challenges in\nbreathing especially after sitting for\nrelieving pressure on certain nerve\nroots and there a bunch of other\nbenefits as well it's very easy to do it\nmore or less looks like a warrior two\npose in yoga and forgive me I'm not a\ntrained uh Yogi I've taken a few yoga\nclasses in my day however and what\nyou're essentially going to do is get\ninto a lunge where the front knee is a\nlittle bit bent this is going to depend\na little bit on your degree of\nflexibility again every body is\ndifferent but what you're essentially\ngoing to do here is you're you're going\nto go into a lunge which this for me I\ncan start to feel a stretch on my uh hip\nhere and then you're going to raise the\narm on the side for which the leg is\nbehind you and you're going to put the\npalm of your hand to the ceiling and\nthen you're going to turn your pinky\ntowards your head and really reach and\nthen move into the lunge a little bit\ndeeper so now I'm getting a deeper\nstretch in the hip flexor really feeling\nit all the way from the hip flexor up\nthrough the soaz through the arm and you\ncan really reach reach reach reach reach\nexhale again tongue on the roof of your\nmouth eyes can be forward or eyes can be\nup and relax you would repeat that three\nor five times per side and call that one\nset and then you would do it for the\nother side so like\nso so again and by the way the heel of\nmy back foot is off the ground Some\npeople prefer Andor can do it with their\nheel in contact if of course I tighten\nmy stance I can do it with the heel in\ncontact I prefer to do it this way with\nmy back heel up front foot completely\nplanted and then\nit's lunge forward until I start to feel\na stretch in the hip flexor here then\narm goes\nup my eyes are up in my case\nPalm parallel to the floor parallel to\nthe ceiling and then turning the pinky\ntoward my head\nhead exhaling through my nose tongue in\nthe roof of the\nmouth again I feel the stretch the whole\nway down and back to the toes we talk\nabout some of the\nfascial that is the fascia aspects of\nthis the neural aspects and the\nneuromuscular aspects in the episode on\nhow to strengthen and pain prooof your\nback you might do that for one to five\nsets depending on how much time you have\nhow much work you're trying to put into\nstrengthening and pain proofing your\nback as you can see you can do this in\nwork clothes these are not my workout\nclothes these are my work clothes and\ngenerally you can do it without working\nup a sweat I've got a little bit of\nperspiration here because I'm putting a\nlot of effort into it and I'm talking at\nthe same time but you can essentially do\nthese anywhere now this last exercise\nwas one that was taught to me by a guy\nnamed Grant Elliot who has a terrific\nInstagram Channel called Rehab fix it's\na back exercise designed to relieve pain\nwhen you're getting some bulging that is\nherniation of the disc that's impinging\non the nerves from me that was about an\nL3 L4 impingement it was so bad that I\ncould barely walk like I was like\ndoubled over like this I could barely\nwalk I didn't know what to do I thought\nmaybe I needed surgery or I need pain\nmeds some people yes do need surgery\nAndor pain meds for lower back injuries\nand pain but in my case what Grant\nElliot instructed me to do which helped\nimmediately and resolve the whole thing\nwithin just a couple of days was to do a\nsort of Cobra pose pushup so what I do\nis I'll get down on the on the floor\nlike so put my hands more or less at\nclavical level a little bit behind maybe\nin line with my chest my feet are\ntogether and pointed back my elbows are\nback and then I push up off the ground\nagain tongue on the roof of the\nmouth sometimes I'll go up higher like\nso but usually it's just to about here\nand then\nrelease and relax and then I'll\nrepeat doing about anywhere from three\nto five second\nholds I'll do that\nfor maybe five to 10\nrepetitions I'm going to do fewer now\nfor sake of time and then on the last\nrepetition I'll\nhold trying to go long with the\nspine for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds\nand then relax and I'll do that several\ntimes throughout the day it helped\ntremendous ously and immediately to\nrelieve my back pain which was again\nexcruciating was also causing pain in\nthe hip and down the leg if you listen\nto the episode on how to strengthen and\npain proof your back at least for the\nback pain that I had where there was a\ndisc impingement on a nerve rout and the\ndirection of the herniation of the disc\nwas that away towards the my back um it\nmade perfect sense it does make perfect\nsense why that would help relieve it\nbecause it's essentially taking that\ndisc and encouraging it to move back\nunder those vertebrae so to speak I\nrealize that's not the technical term\nfor other types of back pain you might\nneed to do a slightly different\nvariation or avoid that variation for\ninstance if the impingement is in the\nfront that exercise would actually\nexacerbate it however what I was doing\nprior to that exercise such as crunches\nwas actually making the dis herniation\nworse so that exercise I just showed you\nwas the way that I relieved my back pain\nand many others that I know have used it\nto relieve their back pain because it\nwas caused by the same discernation\npattern okay so that's the Cobra push-up\nsort of up dog type Cobra push-up I\ndon't have a better name for it maybe\nyou can come up with a better name for\nit put that in the comment section below\nI'll take a tally and we'll go with the\ntop one from here okay so that's Mill's\nbig three meaning that's the curup the\nside plank and the bird dog I also\nshowed you this in a Warrior 2 pose with\nthe Palm towards the ceiling which is\ndesigned to stretch the soas and\ninvolves some fascial stretching as well\nand some activation of the entire\npathway from hand to hip and provides a\nreally terrific stretch obviously you\nwant to do those both sides and this\nCobra push-up slup dog thing that can in\nmany cases provide relief for the nerve\nroots that are being impinged upon by a\nbulging or herniated disc at least\nthat's what it did for me hope you found\nthose useful again lots of variations on\nthese you can find them on the Internet\nyou can find them in Stu Mill's book and\nother resources we provided links to the\nvarious people as well as the book\nresources and a few other videos that\nare going to be useful for you as you\ntry to navigate back pain and strengthen\nyour back and pain prooof your back and\nof course please check out the full\nlength episode of The hubman Lab podcast\nthat I did all about how to strengthen\nand pain prooof your back gets into all\nthe logic the science the details and of\ncourse protocols and last but certainly\nnot least thank you for ignoring the\ncolor of the carpet and thank you for\nyour interest in science"
