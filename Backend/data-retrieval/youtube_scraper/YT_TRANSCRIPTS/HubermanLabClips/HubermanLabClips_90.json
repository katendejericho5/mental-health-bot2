    "transcript": "Let's just think about addiction,\nbecause in biology\nand in psychology, frankly,\nit really often pays\nto think about the extremes first\nand then work our way\ntowards more typical circumstances.\nNow with that said,\naddiction unfortunately,\nis very common nowadays.\nI just heard a statistic, in fact,\nthat there is an 80% increase\nin alcohol use disorder\namong women in the last 30 years.\nI talked a little bit about this\nin the episode that I did\nabout alcohol and health.\nAgain, I want to be very clear.\nI'm not somebody that is completely\nagainst alcohol for adults,\nprovided they're not alcoholics.\nTurns out two drinks a week,\nprobably fine health-wise.\nZero would be better if we're honest.\nZero is better than any alcohol.\nBut two drinks a week is probably fine.\nPast two drinks,\nyou start running into problems.\nYet many, many people out there,\nmale and female alike\nsuffer from alcohol use disorder,\nalso called alcoholism.\nThe same is also true\nfor things like methamphetamine\nor cocaine\nor other types of substance addictions.\nThe same is also true\nfor a lot of behavioral\nor what are sometimes\ncalled process addictions.\nThings like sex addiction\nor video game addiction,\nor any type of behavior that, frankly,\nis leveraging the dopamine system,\nbut that engages\nthis progressive narrowing\nof the things that bring someone pleasure\nsuch that nothing else is really salient.\nNothing else is really pulling them in\nin the way that their video games\nor sex or pornography or alcohol.\nPick your substance\nor behavior that you see out there,\nor hopefully not,\nthat you might suffer\nfrom an addiction to.\nWhat's happening in addiction?\nWell, addiction involves dopamine,\namong other things,\noften the opioid system, etc.\nBut if we were to think\nabout what's the stimulus in an addiction\nand what's the peak in dopamine,\nand then what happens after that peak,\nit all becomes very clear\nas to why addiction happens\nand why it's so pernicious.\nFor instance, let's take cocaine.\nCocaine causes dramatic increases\nin dopamine very, very fast.\nIf somebody craves cocaine,\nwhat are they craving?\nThey're craving that dopamine peak.\nThey're craving\nthe increased level of alertness.\nThey're craving a number of things\nassociated with the feeling of being\nunder the influence of the drug.\nBut the stimulus for it simply\nbecomes that line of cocaine.\nOr in the case of crack,\nthat crack rock\nthat they're going to smoke\nand God forbid they're mainlining it,\nthey're shooting into a vein.\nWhat happens is they snort,\nsmoke, or inject cocaine\nand dopamine levels almost immediately\ngo up to a very high peak.\nThe time gap between the stimulus\nand the dopamine is very, very short.\nSo short, in fact, that there's really\nno other contingencies in between\nthat the mesocortical system\nhas to learn.\nIn fact, what does the system \"learn\"?\nIt learns cocaine equals\nmassive amounts of dopamine\nequals feeling\neuphoric and energetic, etc.\nIn doing that,\nit reinforces the whole circuit\nso that that short,\nwe can even say hyper-short contingency\nis really what the system wants.\nSo much so\nthat longer contingencies of, say,\nputting in the hard work\nof generating a fitness program\nor a professional program for yourself\nor an education program\nwhich takes not just many days\nbut many weeks and years,\nwell, none of that is going\nto lead to peaks in dopamine\nthat are as high as the peak\nin dopamine associated with cocaine.\nThat tells us something critical.\nIt is both the duration\nbetween desire and effect.\nWhen I say effect,\nI mean the rewarding properties\nof dopamine that are experienced.\nThat's important.\nVery short gaps teach the system\nto expect and want short gaps.\nMakes it very hard\nto pursue things that take longer.\nWhen we say it's the short,\nor in this case, hyper-short distance\nor time\nbetween the stimulus and the dopamine,\nwhat we're really talking about,\nif we were to plot this out\non a board or on a piece of paper,\nis the steepness of the rise of that peak.\nIt's very, very steep.\nThe peak in dopamine\nis coming up very fast after the desire.\nIn addition to that,\nand this is very important,\nthe higher the peak in dopamine\nand the faster the rise to that peak,\nthe further below baseline the dopamine\ndrops after the drug wears off.\nIn the case of cocaine,\nit's a very fast\nand very large rise in dopamine,\nfollowed by a steep drop\nand very deep trough\nin dopamine below baseline.\nYou say, okay, so there's pleasure,\nthen there's lack of pleasure.\nBut it's worse than that\nbecause it's not just lack of pleasure.\nIf you recall\nwhat we talked about a little bit earlier,\nthat drop below baseline triggers\nthe desire and the pursuit for what?\nFor more.\nThis sets in motion a vicious loop\nwhere people start\npursuing peaks in dopamine\nthat can come\nvery fast without much effort.\nThat's one of the ways\nin which addiction start to take hold.\nThere's a simple way to think about this\nand to remember if you want\nto avoid this whole thing.\nI mean, the first one is obvious,\ndon't do cocaine.\nDon't try it. Don't use it.\nCertainly don't get addicted to it.\nThose are all one in the same, frankly.\nI don't know many people\nthat despite opinions to the contrary\nthat use cocaine recreationally,\nthat don't at some point run into either\na financial, psychological,\nphysical, or some other problem.\nThe other thing that's absolutely\ncritical to keep in mind,\nand this was discussed\nin my colleague Dr. Anna Lembke's book,\nDopamine Nation and on this podcast.\nExcellent book, by the way.\nI highly recommend it\nif you haven't read it already.\nIt's a fascinating exploration\ninto dopamine as it relates to addiction,\nnot just drug addiction,\nbut other types of addiction.\nAgain, the name of that book\nis Dopamine Nation.\nWe'll provide a link to it\nin the show notes captions.\nThe other thing that happens\nafter those big, fast increases\nin dopamine caused by things like cocaine\nis afterwards\nwhen it quickly drops below baseline,\nit takes a much longer time\nto get back to the original baseline\nthan it did prior to using the drug.\nWorse still, is that the peaks\nin dopamine that are created\nfrom more consumption of cocaine\nleads to progressively lower peaks\nand deeper troughs below baseline.\nThe whole system\nis shifting away from pleasure\nand more to pain\nand the desire for pursuit of the drug."
