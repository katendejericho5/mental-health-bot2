    "transcript": "So there's a famous experiment\nthat was published last\nyear by Joe Takahashi's lab,\nand it came out in Science,\nand that relates to caloric restriction.\nAnd we kind of started with this idea,\nwe started discussing that\nthe rat experiments were done\nwith caloric restriction,\nand researchers gave\nreduced calorie conjunction\nby 20% or 30%, and get that food,\nthe rats, and then subsequently mice.\nAnd they all lived longer.\nWhat is interesting is,\nin all those experiments,\nthe researchers came\nand gave this bolus of food at one time,\nwhereas the ad libitum fed mice, or rats,\nthey had access to food all the time.\nSo they're eating all the time.\nAnd then these rats were given 20% less.\nAnd what happens is these mice, or rats,\nthey're not going to take that less food,\nwhich is less than now,\nand just eat a little bit of lunch\nand then snack after three hours\nor snack after three hours,\nthey gobble up all that food\nwithin two to three hours,\nmaximum four hours.\nFood is gone.\nSo they're sort of on the OMAD diet.\nThe one meal a day.\nYeah.\nThey're almost like in one meal a day,\nthree to four hours, food is gone.\nOr you can sit there on\nfour-hours eating or feeding\nand 20 hours fasting.\nSo then the question became, well,\nthe benefit of caloric\nrestriction as we know,\nis it due to reduced calorie\nor time-restricted feeding, or timing?\nThere is a timing component to it,\nthat they're eating all of that\nwithin three to four hours,\nand then there is a long fasting.\nAnd this is a difficult question to answer\nbecause now you have to ask\nthese poor grad students\nor technicians to come and split that food\ninto 8 or 10 or 15\ndifferent small portions\nand then give them to\nmice in every two hours.\nSo Joe Takahashi,\nwho actually published\nthe first paper in 2017\nshowing that most caloric\nrestriction study,\nI mean he used the protocol\nthat was used by caloric\nrestriction field.\nIt actually creates a\ncondition of time-restriction.\nSo he showed that and then he went back\nand worked with engineers\nto come up with a smart case\nwhere he could actually tell,\nhe could program how much\nfood is given to mice\nat what time of the day or\nnight, completely programmed.\nSo then he took this, for example,\nsupposed say the ad libitum fed mice\neats five grams of chow in a day.\nAnd if you want to reduce calories by 20%,\nthen the CR mouse should\nget four grams of food,\nand he divided this into 9 or 10 meals,\nand then gave them in every 90 minutes.\nSo, in this case, they're\neating small meals\nthroughout day and night,\nso there is no fasting.\nSo he can say that, well,\nthis mouse actually is\nnot getting into fasting\nbecause in every few hours\nis getting some food.\nAnd then he measured how long\nthe mouse is going to live.\nAnd he counted mice,\nthis is a very standard protocol,\npeople count how many mice\nare dying on which day\nand then examine them\nto see whether they died\nbecause there was an accident\nor there was a natural cause.\nAnd then they calculate at the end\nwhat is the half-life.\nSo, 50% survival,\nbecause that's, on an average,\nthat's a good indicator\nbecause if there is an outlier\nthat will live for a long\ntime, then that can skew.\nSo what was interesting was\nthe ad libitum fed mice,\nof course they lived\ncertain number of days\nand then this caloric restricted mice\nthat never got into super fasting,\nbut kind of eating, snacking\nthroughout day and night,\nthey also lived 10% extra, 10% longer.\nSo that means caloric restriction\nextended lifespan by 10%.\nI've wondered about this\nbecause recently, you know,\nthere were a bunch of news headlines\nabout intermittent fasting,\nand frankly I was frustrated.\nIf you looked at one major news outlet,\nthey would say time-restricted feeding\naffords no additional benefit\nbeyond caloric restriction\nfor weight loss.\nSATCHIN: Yeah.\nThen another popular press\nvenue, let's call it that,\nsame study, described as\ntime-restricted feeding doesn't work.\nYeah. [chuckles]\nRight, and then another\none, it may be someplace\neven more extreme, you know,\ntime-restricted feeding only beneficial\nbecause of caloric restriction,\nor something like that.\nSo what you've essentially got\nare three different\ninterpretations of the same data,\nall of which are, well,\ntwo of which are true, one of\nwhich is false, in my opinion.\nBut, what I think people\ntake away from that is,\n\"Oh, time-restricted\nfeeding isn't valuable,\"\nwhich is not the case.\nI think for many people\nit's a convenient way to eat\nbecause, at least for people like me,\nit's simpler to designate\nbetween portions of my day\nwhen I'm eating and portions\nof my day when I'm not eating,\nas opposed to portion control.\nFor other people,\nportion control can work,\nbut all of that is related\nto either maintenance\nor loss of weight.\nNone of it deals with the\npotential health benefits\nindependent of weight loss.\nYeah.\nAnd so I think that if\nwe can segment those out,\nobviously in humans it's hard to know\nif a given treatment or\nexperiment is extending life\nbecause you don't really know how long\npeople would live anyway.\nRight, whereas with\nmice, you have some sense\nof when the mortality was likely to occur.\nSo, what can we say about\ntime-restricted feeding\nand longevity in terms of biomarkers\nor in terms of any other indication\nthat people who start and\nstop their feeding window\nat a consistent time somewhere\nbetween 8 and 12 hours\nper 24-hour cycle\nare tilting the scales\ntowards living longer\nas opposed to living shorter.\nThis example of this news article\nthat you mentioned is really interesting\nbecause that relates to\nJoe Takahashi's study,\nbecause I described that\nif you split calories\nand eat throughout the day,\nthroughout day and night,\nthen the mice lived 10% extra.\nBut if you now give mouse the\nsame caloric restricted diet\nand fit them during daytime,\nwhether within 12 hours or 2 hours,\nthen the mice live 10% extra\nBeyond that.\nYes.\nSo 20%.\n20%.\nSo, okay, so let me make sure I understand\nso that I make sure I understand.\nIf you take a certain number of calories\nand you distribute them\nthroughout the 24-hour cycle,\nit's caloric restriction, the\nmice will live 10% longer.\nIf you however restrict\nthat to the active cycle,\nso for humans, the daytime,\nthen they live 20% longer.\n20% longer.\nSo, it's not just total caloric intake.\nYeah.\nMeaning it's not just important\nto be sub-maintenance in\ncalories for sake of longevity.\nIt also is important as to\nwhen in the 24-hour cycle\nyou eat those calories.\nDo I have that right?\nSo now, still, the story is not over\nbecause these mice are fed during daytime\nwhen they're not supposed to eat.\nThat's right.\nSo for us it would be the equivalent\nof being on the night shift\nand only eating at night,\nbut a sub-maintenance\ncalorie diet, I guess,\nis the right way to say it.\nBut when he fed mice during nighttime,\nwhen they're supposed to eat,\nand they're getting the\nsame number of calories\nwithin 12 hours or 2 hours,\nthen the mice lived 35%\nlonger than they control.\n35% longer.\nSo ,scale to human lifespan,\nwhich we don't know,\nbut 35% longer would mean that,\nand again, no one knows,\nbut humans, now, what\nis the average mortality\nin the United States?\nSomewhere around 80?\nYeah, so it's around 80, it used to be 80.\nNow reduced a little bit because of COVID,\nbut let's take 80.\nOkay, so people are then now living\nsomewhere between 25 and 35 years longer.\nI'm putting some error bars on there.\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nANDREW: Amazing.\nSo that was really profound.\nBut now, you pointed out\nbiomarker and other stuff,\nso now if you look at any given\ntime within that experiment,\nand actually Joe went back\nand had a separate cohort\nof mice, very similar,\nand so that he could take tissue samples\nand of course in this case you\nhave to sacrifice the mouse.\nAnd he looked for,\nhe did a lot of molecular\nanalysis with known markers.\nFor example, hemoglobin A1C equivalent\nor glucose control,\ncholesterol, all this stuff.\nHe could not find anything\nthat predicted the benefit\nof caloric restriction.\nSo that means in this experiment,\nwhatever we know so far,\nthe predictor of longevity,\nnone of them could predict\nwhether this CR-only mouse,\nthroughout day and night,\nthat mouse is going to live\nless than the night-fed mouse\nthat was going to live 25% extra.\nDoes that mean that there are biomarkers\nrelated to longevity that we\njust haven't discovered yet?\nYeah, so that's exactly.\nSo that means whatever we\nknow so far about biomarkers,\nhe could not use to predict.\nMaybe there was a lot of noise.\nMaybe he had to use more\nnumber of mice to get that\nbecause you know, biomarkers\nare not going to predict\nin every instance, or there is some error.\nWhat is also very interesting is,\nif you look at the body\nweight and body composition\nof all these mice,\nthere is no difference in body\nweight and body composition.\nAcross all these different groups.\nAcross all these groups.\nSo it doesn't matter when they ate.\nProvided they were\nsub-maintenance calorie intake,\nso fewer calories than is\nrequired to maintain their weight.\nDidn't matter what pattern of eating,\nthey were the same weight.\nSo that, in many ways, seems\nto mimic the human studies\nwhere they say, \"Look,\nit doesn't really matter\nwhether or not you use\ncaloric restriction,\nor you start your feeding\nwindow in the morning\nor start your feeding\nwindow in the evening,\nor you portion control\nfor sake of weight loss.\"\nBecause we're taking a snapshot of that.\nAnd then another thing\nwith the human study\nthat we are referring to\nhere, in that human study,\npeople are actually already\neating within 10-hours window.\nHabitually.\nWhen they selected these people\nto have them enroll in the study.\nSo they were already eating for 10 hours\nand fasting for 14 hours.\nAll participants had to\nreduce their caloric intake,\nand they reduced by almost 25%.\nThe CR group continued\nwith 10-hours eating window\nand the CR plus time-restricted group\nhad to eat the same number of\ncalories within eight hours.\nSo it's just a two-hour difference.\nIt's just a two-hours difference.\nOkay, so I just want to make\nsure people can understand.\nSo, in this human study,\nwhich is the one that I felt\nthat the popular press venues,\nall except one venue, got\neither semi-wrong or badly wrong\nin terms of their conclusion,\nthat was my interpretation anyway,\nwas that either people\ncame into the study eating\nbasically in a 10-hour feeding window,\nwhich goes back to my first question,\nwhich is that most people are not eating\nin the middle of the night.\nYeah, yeah.\nOr if they're on shift work and they are,\nthen they're sleeping\nduring the day anyway.\nSo they're eating in a 10 to\n12-hour feeding window anyway.\nSo you're saying they either\ndid caloric restriction portion control\nwithin a 10-hour window,\nor another group within the study\nate sub-maintenance calories,\nso, caloric restriction,\nCR, as we're calling it, the acronym CR,\nbut restricted that to\nan 8-hour feeding window.\nAnd they didn't see any difference\nin terms of weight loss.\nYeah.\nBut it's not all that surprising, right?\nI mean if it's just a 2-hour difference.\nYeah, exactly.\nSo, we have done that experiment in mice\nand we don't see difference\nin not only weight loss,\nmany other markers.\nAnd I was telling you\nabout Joe Takahashi's paper\nwhere I told you that he allowed this mice\nto eat within 2 hours or\n12 hours, sub-caloric diet.\n2 or 12.\n2 or 12, yeah,\nThat's dramatic.\nBut still he did not see\nchange in longevity even\nwithin those 2.\nSo that means when you\ndo caloric restriction\nand then, at least with mouse,\nand you are within 12-hours window,\nthat is giving the mice the best benefit,\nthe optimum benefit.\nAnd 2, 3, or 5, or 12\nper mouse doesn't matter,\nat least for longevity.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
