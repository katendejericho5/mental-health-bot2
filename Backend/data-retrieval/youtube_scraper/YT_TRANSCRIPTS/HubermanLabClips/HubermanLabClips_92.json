    "video_title": "Using Topical Caffeine to Slow or Halt Hair Loss | Dr. Andrew Huberman",
    "transcript": "We all think of caffeine\nas a stimulant that we drink.\nI certainly drink coffee and yerba mate,\nthe occasional energy\ndrink, things of that sort.\nCaffeine does many things\nbesides stimulate our central\nnervous system and make\nus feel less sleepy.\nHowever, one of the things\nthat caffeine does is\nit is a fairly potent\nPDE inhibitor.\nBy being a potent PDE inhibitor,\nit indirectly stimulates IGF-1.\nWhy? Well, because PDE\ncan suppress IGF-1\nand by ingesting caffeine\nor by applying topical caffeine ointment\nor cream to the scalp,\nyou can suppress PDE sufficiently enough\nto increase IGF-1 and\nincrease some hair growth\nor at least maintain hair\ngrowth in that region.\nNow, this may come as a shock.\nIt might seem a little bit esoteric\nor even outside the margins\nof typical treatments,\nbut head-to-head topical\ncaffeine application can be\nas effective as minoxidil\napplication without actually\nlowering things like blood pressure\nand potentially increasing prolactin.\nAnd some of the other negative,\nlet's call them negative\nbecause they are side\neffects of minoxidil.\nSo caffeine ointments\nand caffeine present in\nvarious hair treatments\nand creams, et cetera, is starting\nto become a more\nprominent theme out there.\nI will include a reference to caffeine\nand its uses for offsetting hair loss.\nKeep in mind that topical\ncaffeine ointments shouldn't\nnecessarily be applied every single day.\nSo this is the sort of thing you\nmight do three times a week.\nThe concentration of caffeine\nin different ointments\nvaries tremendously.\nMost of the studies of caffeine\non the stem cell niches\nthat control hair growth\nand extension of the antigen phase\nof hair growth have been\nperformed in vitro in a dish.\nAlthough there are some\nclinical studies exploring this,\nthey are not nearly as extensive in number\nor duration as the studies of minoxidil\nbecause this approach just\nhasn't been around quite as long.\nHowever, when comparing side\neffects of minoxidil, cost\nof minoxidil comparing\nthe efficacy of caffeine\nand minoxidil, I think\ncaffeine as a topical treatment\nfor offsetting hair loss stands\nas a pretty good choice if you're going\nto start exploring this pathway.\nAnd there's no reason to\nthink that if you were\nto try the caffeine ointment\nand it didn't work for you,\nor you didn't like it for some reason,\nor you needed to stop it for some reason,\nthat you couldn't stop it safely\nbecause it doesn't carry all\nthe other kind of blood pressure\nrelated effects and prolactinemia\neffects that minoxidil does.\nSo if you look out there\ninto the hair maintenance\nand hair replacement literature,\nyou look at the treatments\nthat are being sold, don't be\nsurprised to see caffeine there.\nAnd also, don't be surprised\nwhen I tell you what I'm about\nto tell you now, which is no,\nyou can't simply just drink\nmore caffeine in order\nto accomplish the goal\nof offsetting hair loss.\nIt is true that when you ingest\ncaffeine, it goes systemically.\nHowever, you have so many\nadenosine receptors throughout\nyour body, those adenosine receptors,\nand the parking of caffeine in\nthose adenosine receptors is\nthe main way in which caffeine\nexerts its stimulatory\neffects making you feel less sleepy.\nSo it does that\nbecause then adenosine\ncan't have its effects,\nwhich are to make you sleepy.\nWell, those adenosine\nreceptors soak up so much\nof the caffeine that you\nwould ingest orally that very,\nvery little would make it to the scalp\nand to the hair follicles at\nthe concentrations that you would want.\nSo that's why you have to\nrely on the application\nof these caffeine ointments\nabout three times a week.\nKeep in mind that no one has\nreally explored the dosages\nof caffeine in these\nointments in a systematic way.\nWe are still in the\nearly stages of all this,\nbut I do think it's\nimportant to mention caffeine\nbecause of the lower\nincidences of side effects,\nat least reported side effects,\nand the general safety margins\nand the head-to-head,\nessentially comparable efficacy\nwith minoxidil because minoxidil\nhas a bunch of other issues.\nNow, keep in mind that both minoxidil\nand caffeine are generally\nused as a preventative\nfor reducing hair loss over time.\nThey are not expected\nand they do not, as far as we\nknow, create new hair growth\nto any sufficient degree.\nIf any of you have used\ncaffeine ointments or minoxidil\nand observed new hair\ngrowth that was robust,\nplease put that in the comment section.\nI'd be curious about those experiences.\nBut as far as I know, and\nfrom the clinical literature\nthat I read, there's no examples of that.\nOne other point about\ncaffeine, it does appear\nthat caffeine can not only\nindirectly stimulate IGF-1 in\nthe antigen phase of hair cell\ngrowth by way of reducing PDE\nand TGF-Î²,\nbut it also seems to reduce apoptosis,\nwhich is naturally occurring cell death\nof that stem cell niche.\nWe've been talking a lot about the antigen\nor growth phase of hair.\nWe also talked about the catagen\nor the recession of that\nhair from the inside out.\nBut remember that third\nphase, the telogen phase where\nthat whole bulb down at the\nbottom, the bulges it's called,\ngets pinched off and the whole thing dies\nand takes the stem cells\noff to the grave with it.\nIt appears that caffeine can\noffset the death of that niche\nand potentially maintain\nthe stem cell population\nlonger, making caffeine\na really good choice to\nthink about in conjunction\nwith the various chemical\ntreatments aimed at\ndirectly attacking the DHT pathway\nthat we'll talk about next.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
