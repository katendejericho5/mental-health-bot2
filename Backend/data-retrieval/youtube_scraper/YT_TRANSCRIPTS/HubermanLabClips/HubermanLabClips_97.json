    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nI'd like to discuss next,\nI find extremely exciting.\nWhy?\nWell, what I'm about to\ndescribe is a compound,\nor I should say,\na set of compounds\nthat are available over the\ncounter that have been shown\nto be very effective in\nreducing the frequency\nand intensity of headaches.\nAnd not just one kind of\nheadache, but multiple types\nof headaches.\nSo what I'll describe\nhas been shown\nto have significant effects\nin reducing the intensity\nor frequency of tension type\nheadaches, migraine type\nheadaches, as well as\nhormone type headaches that\nare related to the\nmenstrual cycles\nthat I described earlier.\nNow, there are a\nlot of data centered\naround this general topic.\nBut I'm going to focus\non three main papers,\nwhat I haven't told\nyou yet, of course,\nis what is the compound\nthat I'm referring to,\nwhat is this over-the-counter\ncounter compound?\nWell, it turns out this\nover-the-counter compound\nis not just available\nover-the-counter,\nit's also available in food.\nSo it turns out\nthat nutrition can\nhave a very strong\nimpact on the frequency\nand intensity of headache.\nAlthough supplementation\nwith this particular compound\ncan accomplish the\nsame thing as well.\nWhat I'm referring to here\nare a omega-3 fatty acids.\nMany of you are probably\nfamiliar with omega-3 fatty\nacids.\nThese are fatty acids that come\nin the form of so-called EPA\nand DHA, and omega-3\nfatty acids are\ncommonly distinguished from the\nso-called omega-6 fatty acids.\nOmega-6 fatty acids come in\na bunch of different foods\nand they, of course, can\nbe supplemented as well.\nOmega-3 fatty acids come in\na bunch of different foods\nand can be supplemented as well.\nCommon forms of omega-3\nfatty acids, or I\nshould say common sources\nof omega-3 fatty acids\nin foods include\nfatty ocean fish,\nincluding salmon, salmon\nskins, sardines, anchovies,\nthings of that sort.\nCommon sources in\nsupplement form\nare so-called fish oil\ncapsules or liquid fish oil.\nAgain, omega-3 fatty\nacids and almost\nalways when we're talking\nabout omega 3 fatty acids,\nwe're talking about a\ncombination of EPA and DHA.\nBut really it is the quantity\nof EPA omega-3 fatty acids\nthat seems to be the most\nimpactful for the sorts\nof health metrics\nthat we're going\nto talk about in a few minutes.\nNow with respect to\nomega-6 fatty acids,\nthe most typical food sources\nof omega-6 fatty acids\nare seed oils.\nI know nowadays, oils have\nbecome quite controversial.\nI've given my stance on\nthis in a prior podcast,\nbut I'll just\nrepeat it for those\nof you that haven't heard it.\nI am not of the belief\nthat all seed oils are bad,\nthat they're all\ninflammatory, that they\nare killing us or\nmaking us sick,\nthat they are the major cause\nof metabolic dysfunction,\net cetera.\nHowever, I think\nit is very clear,\nand I learned this from\nDr. Lee Norton when\nhe was a guest on this\npodcast and taught us\nall about nutrition\nin great depth,\nI highly recommend\nthat episode if you're\ninterested in nutrition,\nthat people are consuming\na lot more oil generally.\nAnd a lot of those oils\nthat people are consuming\nmore of nowadays include a lot\nof the so-called omega-6 fatty\nacids.\nAnd a lot of those\noils are seed oils.\nThe particular\nomega-6 fatty acid\nthat's going to be relevant\nfor today's discussion\nis linoleic acid, and that is\ncommon in a lot of seed oils.\nSo again, I'm not going to tell\nyou that seed oils are bad.\nHowever, it does seem to be\nthe case that many people are\nconsuming far too many\nseed oils, and in doing so\nare consuming far\ntoo many calories,\nand perhaps are consuming too\nmuch of the omega-6 fatty acids\nrelative to the\nomega-3 fatty acids.\nNow with that\nsaid, I think there\nis general agreement among\nnutritionists and health\nprofessionals that we could all\nstand to get more omega-3 fatty\nacids, perhaps for\ncardiovascular health,\nalthough that's a little\nbit debated, but certainly,\nfor immune system function,\nfor mood, and for functioning\nof the brain, and for the\npotent anti-inflammatory effects\nof omega-3.\nSo again, omega-3 can\nbe sourced from food\nboth animal-based\nand plant-based.\nYou can simply go\nonline and look up\nthe various food-based sources.\nBut in thinking about headache\nand different treatments\nfor headache, there\nare some recent studies\nexploring how supplementing\nwith omega-3 fatty acids,\nand in one case\nhow supplementing\nwith omega-3 fatty acids\nand deliberately reducing\nthe amount of linoleic acid,\nthe omega-6 fatty acids, how\nthat can impact headache.\nSo the first study I'd like\nto describe in reference\nto the role of omega-3\nfatty acids in headache\nwas published in 2018,\nand the title of the paper\nis \"Long Chain Omega-3 Fatty\nAcids and Headache in the US\nPopulation.\"\nThere are a number of\nthings that I really\nlike about this study.\nA few of those include\nthe fact that they\nlooked at an enormous\nnumber of people\nthat is they included\n12,317 men and women, I like\nthe fact that they included\nmen and women in the study, age\n20 or older, and\nthat they broke down\nthe population into\ncategories that included age.\nThey certainly looked\nat race and ethnicity.\nThey looked at\neducational background.\nThey looked at body mass,\ntotal energy intake,\nwhich is really important.\nIf you think about it, people\nare going to be eating.\nAnd Within the\nthings that they eat,\nthey're going to be consuming\nsome omega-3s hopefully, as\nwell as some omega-6s.\nAnd if they're eating\nfar more, then they're\ngoing to get far more of likely\ngoing to get far more of both\nof those things than they\nwould ordinarily if they\nwere eating smaller amounts.\nSo they controlled for total\ncaloric intake in a way\nthat I find particularly\nuseful for looking\nat these kind of data.\nSo the reason they explored\nomega-3s is worth mentioning.\nOmega-3 fatty acids\nare known to have\nan anti-inflammatory effect.\nThat anti-inflammatory effect\nis mediated through a couple\nof different pathways.\nWe won't go into these\nin too much detail now,\nbut the omega-3 fatty\nacids keep in mind\nactually make up various parts\nof cells in the brain and body.\nThat's right.\nThe membrane that--\nremember, I talked\nbefore about\nsteroid hormones can\ngo through the\ndifferent membranes\nof the cells, the outer\nmembrane and the inner membrane.\nA lot of those actual membranes,\nthe structural constituents\nof neurons and other cells\nare actually made up of\nor include certain fatty\nacid, long chain fatty acids,\nand the omega-3 fatty\nacids are important\nfor the actual construction\nof those tissues\nas well as having\nanti-inflammatory effects\nthrough things like limiting\nprostaglandins and other things\nthat can cause inflammation.\nSo there are a bunch\nof different ways\nthat omega-3 fatty\nacids can be useful.\nThey refer in this study\nto an earlier study that\nlooked at the so-called\nanalgesic effect, the pain\nrelieving effect.\nAnalgesic means pain relieving\neffect of omega-3 fatty acids\nin what had been a\nrandomized controlled trial.\nAnd in that previous\npaper, what they found\nwas that diets high in\nomega-3s and low in omega-6s,\nso high 3, low 6,\nand as compared\nto diets that were\njust reduced omega-6s,\nthey found a greater\nanalgesic effect\nof increasing omega-3s while\nalso reducing omega-6 fatty\nacids.\nSo in the context of\nthe seed oil discussion,\nalthough keeping in\nmind that omega-6\ncan come from other\nsources as well.\nIf omega-6s were just\nreduced on their own,\nthere wasn't as great\nan effect in terms\nof reducing pain\nand inflammation\nas there was when omega-3\nfatty acids were deliberately\nincreased and omega-6\nfatty acids were reduced.\nAgain, in all of these\nstudies because these\nare the ones in which they\ncontrolled things well\nas we say, they are holding\nconstant the caloric intake.\nSo it's not just that you're\nremoving, fat eating less fat,\nthere's actually a removal of\ncertain fats and fatty acids\nand a replacement of\nthose with omega-3 fatty\nacids in one case.\nIn the other case, it's\njust a reduction in omega-6\nand you're using other food\ntypes and macronutrients\nto offset that\nreduction in calories\ncaused by reducing omega-6s.\nThe basic takeaway\nthat they're relying\non marching into the study\nis that increasing omega-3s\nand reducing\nomega-6s seems to be\nbeneficial for reducing pain.\nAnd indeed in this study, they\nfind something quite similar,\nwhich is that when you hold\ncaloric intake constant\nand when you look at omega-6s,\nwhether or not you decrease\nomega-6 fatty acids\nor not, you find\nis that increasing omega-3\nfatty acids in the diet,\nso either consumed through food\nsources or by supplementation,\nwas associated with a lower\nprevalence of severe headache\nor migraine, so severe tension\ntype headache or migraine.\nSo this is promising\nand points to the fact\nthat long chain\nomega-3 fatty acids are\nlikely to have either\na pain reducing,\nand there's evidence for that,\nand/or an inflammation reducing\neffect that can significantly\nreduce the severity of headache\nin both tension type\nheadache and in migraine.\nSo that's the first study.\nThe second study is\na more recent study,\nwas published in 2021\nthat used, I would say,\na more or less similar type\nof overall design as the one\nI referred to earlier.\nThe title of this\npaper is, dietary\nalteration of what they call N3,\nbut those are omega-3, and N6,\nomega-6, sorry for this\nshift in nomenclature,\nI didn't write the paper,\n\"Dietary Alteration\nof Omega-3 and\nOmega-6 Fatty Acids\nfor Headache Reductions\nin Adults with Migraine.\"\nAnd this was a randomized\ncontrolled trial.\nRandomized controlled\ntrials involve\nhaving people be\nin one condition\nwhere they do one thing, and\nthen they get swapped randomly\ninto another condition.\nSo they serve as their\nown internal control.\nAnd that controls for\nall sorts of things\nlike differences in\nsex, differences in age,\ndifferences in\nhealth background,\nand any number of other\nvariables as best as one can.\nIn this study, they had\npeople either ingest\na diet that had increased\nomega-3s, so increased\nEPA and DHA, or increased\nEPA and DHA and reduced\namounts of linoleic\nacid, so that's\ngoing to reduce omega-6s, or\na control diet in which they\nhad people taking what's\nessentially the average intake\nof omega-3s and omega-6s.\nAnd you can probably\nalready guess\nwhat the general results of\nthis study are going to be.\nThe general results\nwere that there\nwere reductions in headaches.\nThe really cool thing is\nit was a massive reduction\nin headache.\nThey refer to it as a\nrobust reduction in headache\nin particular, for the subjects\nthat increase their omega-3s\nand reduce the amount of\nlinoleic acid that they took.\nThe other thing that I\nreally like about this study\nis that while they don't\nknow the exact underlying\nmechanism for the effect, they\ndid spend some time delineating\nwhat it is that the omega-3 and\nomega-6 fatty acids are likely\ndoing to either offset\nor exacerbate headache.\nNow I didn't say that omega-6\nfatty acids exacerbate\nheadache, but it\ndoes seem that people\nwho ingest more linoleic\nacid and omega-6\nare experiencing\nmore inflammation.\nAnd that is evident in a\nbunch of different conditions.\nOne for instance is increases\nin things like CGRP.\nCGRP is a molecule\nthat's associated\nwith a calcium\nsignaling pathway.\nIt's involved in vasodilation,\nthe expansion of the blood\nvessels and capillaries.\nAnd that's known, as\nI mentioned earlier,\nto exacerbate certain\nforms of headache.\nThere are also forms\nof headache that can\nbe caused by vasoconstriction.\nWe'll talk about one very\ndramatic example, perhaps\nas we get toward the end.\nIt's a very uncommon\nexample, but it's\ncalled thunderclap headache.\nAnd trust me, you do not\nwant thunderclap headache.\nIn any case, in this paper,\nthey didn't study mechanism\ndirectly, but they're resting on\nthis known analgesic anti-pain\nas well as known\nanti-inflammatory pathways\nrelated to increasing\nomega-3 intake\nand simultaneously\nresting on the idea\nor I think we now\ncan say conclusion,\nthat omega-6 fatty acids in\nparticular, linoleic acid\ncan increase inflammation by way\nof increasing things like CGRP,\nvasodilation, and some\nother pathways related\nto the so-called inflammatory\ncytokine pathways.\nAnd there's a whole\ndiscussion nowadays\nof what's called\nthe inflammatom.\nSo the basic takeaway\nis that if you\nare interested in reducing\nheadache, it may be beneficial,\nat least according to these\ntwo studies and another one\nI'll talk about in a\nmoment, to increase\namounts of omega-3 fatty acids.\nAnd that can be done, again,\nthrough the ingestion of foods.\nAlthough based on the\ndosages that we'll talk about\nin a moment, increasing\nomega-3 fatty acids\nby taking liquid form fish oil,\nwhich is perhaps the most cost\neffective way to supplement\nomega-3s or capsules,\nwhich is perhaps the\nmost efficient way\nto supplement omega-3s\nreally to a level of 1 gram\nor more of EPA per day.\nAgain, that's the EPA\nform in particular.\nSo if you're, for instance,\ntaking supplemental fish oil,\nor you're getting your\nomega-3s from food,\nand you're getting\nwhat you determine\nto be 2,000 milligrams or 2\ngrams per day of omega-3s,\nkeep in mind that's going\nto include EPA and DHA.\nAnd it does seem that\ngetting above 1 gram per day\nof EPA omega-3 fatty\nacids either through food\nor supplements or both is going\nto be the critical threshold\nfor reductions in the frequency\nand intensity of headaches\nthat include both tension\nheadaches and migraine\nheadaches.\nNow some people\nwill find actually\nthat ingesting far more\nomega-3 fatty acids generally\nthrough supplementation, but,\nagain, can be accomplished\nthrough foods as\nwell, can also be\nbeneficial for other\nthings such as mood.\nAnd indeed, there's\na whole literature\nrelated to effects of\ningesting 1 to 3 grams,\nagain, 3 grams per day of EPA.\nSo that's going to require\nquite a high intake of omega-3s\nin whatever form or\nsupplement you decide\nto take those into your body.\nBut that can improve\nmood and so forth.\nThe basic range that I was able\nto find in the meta- analysis--\nso meta-analysis are where\na researcher will look\nat the results of a bunch\nof different studies focused\non the same thing, look\nat the different strength\nof those studies.\nThey'll do all sorts of\ncool statistical gymnastics,\nlike remove the most\npotent study, the one that\nhad the greatest effect,\nand see whether or not\nthey're still in effect\nof some treatment,\nor for instance, they will swap\nin and out different studies\nand different combinations\nto see whether or not\nany one study is really\nleading to the conclusion\nthat the given treatment\ndoes something.\nIn any case, in the\nmeta-analysis of omega-3 fatty\nacids for the\ntreatment of headache,\nand that includes all the\ndifferent kinds of headache,\nthey found in\nexploring a huge range\nof omega-3 supplementation\nranging from 200 milligrams\nall the way up to 2,000\nmilligrams per day,\nit really was at the 1 gram\nor higher dosage per day\nwhere the significant impact\non reducing headache frequency\nand intensity was found.\nAnd just very briefly\nearlier I mentioned\nthat not only is omega-3 fatty\nacid supplementation have been\nshown to be effective in\nreducing the frequency\nand intensity of headache in\ntension type and migraine type\nheadache, but it's\nalso been shown\nto improve outcomes for\npremenstrual syndrome-related\nheadaches.\nThese are what we referred\nto earlier as hormone-based\nheadaches.\nAgain, the low estrogen,\nlow progesterone\nassociated with certain\nphases of the menstrual cycle,\nas well as other phases\nof the menstrual cycle\nare often associated\nwith headache.\nIn a study entitled, \"Effect\nof Omega-3 Fatty Acids\non Premenstrual Syndrome, A\nSystematic Review, and, again,\nmeta-analysis, what\nthey found, and here I'm\nparaphrasing the conclusion,\nwas that omega-3 fatty acids\ncould, yes, effectively reduce\nthe severity of PMS symptoms.\nAnd one of the\nsymptoms in particular\nthat they found that was reduced\nwas the pain related symptoms\nassociated with headache.\nAnd they actually had\nsome very nice hypotheses\nas to why that likely would be.\nAnd in fact point out\nthat in earlier studies\nomega-3 fatty\nacids have actually\nbeen considered\nas non-steroidal,\nanti-inflammatory\ndrugs in some cases.\nAnd indeed, there are\nprescription forms\nof omega-3 fatty acids.\nAnd I highlight\nthat not because I\nthink people need to run\nout and get the prescription\nform of omega-3 fatty\nacids, they're actually\nquite hard to obtain\nand quite expensive,\nbut because I think\noftentimes, when\nwe're talking about\nsomething like omega-3 fatty\nacids, the fact that they are\navailable over the counter\nin a supplement or by\nliquid or available in food\nfor that matter\nleads many people\nto conclude that this\nis supplementation,\nthis is something\nthat it's going\nto have relatively weak or minor\nimpact on things like headache\nor other health metrics.\nBut let's just say that\nthe fact that it exists\nas a prescription drug in\nits highest potency form,\nat least in my opinion, points\nto the potency of omega-3 fatty\nacids in dealing with analgesic\neffects that is reducing pain\nand anti-inflammation,\nas well as some\nof the known\ncardiovascular improvements\nthat are associated with\nincreasing omega-3 fatty acid\nintake.\nPut simply, omega-3s\nare not just something\nthat comes from\nfood or supplements,\nthey are also being marketed\nas prescription drugs.\nSo I do think they need to be\nconsidered as quite potent.\nAnd at least as far as these\npapers that again include\nmeta-analysis of many\nother papers and data sets,\nindicate that supplementing\nwith omega-3 fatty acids\nto a point where you are getting\nabove 1 gram per day of EPA\nis not just going to be\nbeneficial for treating\nand reducing the frequency\nand intensity of one\nparticular type of headache,\nbut many types of headaches.\nAnd when you combine hormonal\nheadaches, tension headaches,\nand migraine headaches, you\naccount for more than 70%\nof the total types of\nheadaches that are out there.\nThe effects of\nomega-3s on cluster\nheadaches and some of the\nother types of headaches,\nat least to my knowledge,\nhave not been evaluated.\nThere's no reason to think\nthat omega-3s would not\nbe beneficial for those\ntypes of headaches.\nBut at least as far\nas the data sets\nwe talked about here are\nconcerned, it is clear,\nomega-3 fatty acids are\ngoing to be a very potent way\nto reduce pain and to\nreduce inflammation\nin ways that can reduce the\nfrequency and the intensity\nof different kinds of headache.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
