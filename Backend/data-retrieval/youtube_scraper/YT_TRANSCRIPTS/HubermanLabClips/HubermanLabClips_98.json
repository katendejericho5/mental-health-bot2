    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: What can you\ntake or do to reduce headache?\nAnd in order to\naddress this, we're\ngoing to start first with\nthe headaches associated\nwith head hits and\ntraumatic brain injury.\nBecause it turns out there's\na surprising and very useful\napproach to doing that.\nBut this same approach also can\nhelp offset and treat headache\nin other conditions as well,\nmeaning not just for headaches\ncaused by traumatic\nbrain injury,\nbut also headaches caused by\nsudden onset tension headache\nor migraine headache\nor even perhaps,\nagain, perhaps cluster\ntype headaches.\nSo the first substance\nthat I'd like\nto highlight that has been\nshown to significantly reduce\nthe intensity and/or frequency\nof headaches is creatine.\nNow creatine as\nmany of you know,\nis something that people\nsupplement intake.\nMost often, creatine\nis discussed\nin the context of\nmuscle performance,\nnot just for people\nwho weightlift,\nbut for people who do\nendurance exercise.\nAnd it's often been said\nthat 5 to 10 grams per day\nof creatine\nmonohydrate, depending\non how much you weigh,\n5 to 10 grams per day\nof creatine monohydrate can\nincrease creatine phosphate\nstores in muscles, can bring\nmore water into muscles,\ncan make you stronger,\ncan increase power output.\nAnd that is all true.\nThat's all completely true.\nWe discussed this in\nthe Huberman Lab podcast\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin when he\nwas a guest on the Huberman Lab\npodcast with standard series.\nAnd we discussed\nthis extensively\nin an upcoming episode\nfrom Dr. Andy Galpin\nin his special\nsix-part guest series\nwhere he is a guest on\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nbut where really\nhe's the one doing\nthe majority of the teaching.\nAnd that series\ncovers everything\nfrom strength\nhypertrophy endurance.\nAnd there's an episode\non supplementation\nwhere we go deep into the\ndiscussion about creatine.\nNow in that\ndiscussion, and, again,\nnow we highlight the\nfact that creatine,\nwhile most often\ndiscussed online\nand in the media as a supplement\nfor sports performance\nfor the reasons\nI just mentioned,\nactually has far\nmore data behind it\nthat is laboratory\nstudies exploring\nthe role of creatinine\nin the clinical setting.\nSo I'd like to highlight a\npaper from that literature now\nthat will make very clear as\nto why creatine is interesting,\nand in fact, very effective\nfor treating headache,\nin particular headache caused\nby head hits or traumatic brain\ninjury.\nThe title of the\npaper is, \"Prevention\nof Traumatic Headache,\nDizziness, and Fatigue\nwith Creatine Administration.\"\nNow keep in mind,\nthis is a pilot study.\nIt was performed in humans.\nSo when you hear the\nwords preclinical,\nthat is if you hear there was\na preclinical study on blank,\nthat means almost always\nthat the study was performed\non animal models, mice,\nrats, primates, et cetera.\nA clinical trial is something\nthat's carried out on humans.\nAnd a pilot study\nmeans that the study\nwas carried out on humans,\nbut on a fairly small cohort,\na very fairly small group or\nlimited number of subjects.\nNonetheless, if the\ndata are robust as it\nis in this case of\nthis paper, I think\nit's worth paying attention to.\nSo in this study,\nwhat they looked at\nwas creatine administration.\nSo what they did is\nthey had people ingest\na certain amount of creatine,\nI'll tell you in a moment,\nin fluids.\nIt could be taken in water\nor milk with or without food.\nIt doesn't really\nmatter what time of day.\nThey had people take creatine.\nWhy would they have people take\ncreatine after traumatic brain\ninjury, and in\nparticular for people\nthat are suffering from\nheadache, dizziness, fatigue,\net cetera?\nThe reason is that\nneurons, nerve cells\nrely very heavily on the\nregulation of calcium\nin order to generate\nthose action\npotentials to communicate\nwith one another.\nSo it doesn't matter if it's a\nmotor neuron, a sensory neuron,\nor a modulatory neuron.\nThey all generate action\npotentials or something\nsimilar to it.\nAnd calcium is important\nfor that process.\nCalcium becomes dysregulated\nafter traumatic brain injury\nin a number of different ways,\nin particular in ways that\nimpact the energy\nproduction systems\nof cells that are related to\nATP, adenosine triphosphate.\nFor those aficionados out\nthere that want to look it up,\nyou can simply look up\ncalcium ATP and neurons,\nand you can learn\nabout that cycle.\nCreatine can be\nstored in muscles,\nas we talked about\nbefore, but creatine\nand in particular, the\nphosphorylated form\nof creatine, which is the\nreadily available fuel source\nform of creatine, can also\nbe stored in brain tissue\nand is actually quite\nprominently stored\nin the forebrain, the area or\nthe real estate of your brain\njust behind the\nforehead, which is\ninvolved in planning and action\nand understanding context.\nSo it's very important\nfor cognition.\nIt's important for\npersonality too.\nBut it's important for a number\nof different aspects of life\nthat have to do\nwith making plans,\nbeing able to focus very\nintensely on your work, et\ncetera, or on anything for\nthat matter, all functions that\nbecome heavily disrupted in\npeople who have traumatic brain\ninjury and concussion.\nCreatine's ability\nto communicate\nwith the calcium\nand the ATP system\nwas the motivation\nbehind the study.\nThat is the authors\nhypothesized on the basis\nof preclinical data\nin animals that\nby increasing creatine\nstores within the brain,\nnot just in the muscle, but in\nparticular within the brain,\nthat the availability\nof creatine\nwould allow for better\ncognitive function in general.\nNow they didn't look at\ncognition specifically\nin this paper, but they did\nlook at the other aspects\nthat is that the bad\nstuff associated with TBI.\nAnd they had people\nsupplementing with creatine\nat a level that is much\nhigher than the typical level\nthat people supplement with\ncreatine simply for sports\nperformance.\nSo as I mentioned\nbefore, most people\nif they supplement with\ncreatine for sports performance,\nthey take creatine monohydrate\ntypically 5 grams per day\nsometimes 10 grams per day,\nif they're about 100 kilograms\nor greater in body weight.\n100 kilograms is\napproximately 220 pounds.\nSo the dosage that was used\nfor supplementing creatinine\nin this study to address the\npotential impact of creatine\non headache,\ndizziness, and fatigue\nwas quite a bit higher\nthan the dosages\nused simply for\nmuscle performance.\nIn this study, they\nhad people take\na dose of 0.4 grams of creatine\nmonohydrate per kilogram\nof body weight.\nSo for somebody that weighs\n100 kilograms or 220 pounds,\nthat would be 40 grams\nof creatine per day.\nIf someone weighs\nhalf that much,\nthey would take 20 grams\nof creatine per day.\nAnd they did that over\na period of six months.\nAnd we know that when you\ntake creatine over and over,\nday-to-day that there's a\nbuildup of creatine stores\nboth in the muscles and\nwithin the brain tissue.\nNow what they found\nas a consequence\nof this creatine administration\nwas really striking,\nand I think quite exciting.\nThey found a very\nsignificant decrease\nin the frequency of\nheadache in people\nthat were supplementing\nwith creatine as opposed\nto the controls.\nNow keep in mind that\nthis is a pilot study,\nbut the effects\nare very dramatic.\nThey found a very statistically\nsignificant decrease\nin the frequency of\nheadache in people\nthat were taking creatinine.\nIn fact, if you\nlook at the controls\nand you see that they're\nbasically getting headache\nat a frequency of 90%\nor more after TBI,\nthe reduction in\nheadache frequency\nis down to about 10% or 12%\nin the people taking creatine.\nSo that's quite a\ndramatic effect.\nAnd if you look at\nthe other measures\nthey took, keep in\nmind, again, this\nis a pilot study, so a\nlimited number of subjects.\nBut again, the results\nare very impressive.\nWhat they found is that the\nnumber of people experiencing\ndizziness was significantly\nreduced in people supplementing\nwith creatine as was the number\nof people experiencing fatigue,\nkind of acute fatigue\nand chronic fatigue.\nAgain, not chronic\nfatigue syndrome per se,\nbut chronic fatigue, which\nwas in this study defined\nas a general sense of\nbodily weakness and even\nmental weakness.\nMental weakness is a little\nbit hard to quantify.\nBut they were very\ncareful to distinguish\nbetween cognitive and mental\nfatigue versus physical\nand somatic fatigue.\nThey acknowledged that both of\nthose occur in TBI or post-TBI.\nThe headache is quite frequent.\nBasically, the\ntakeaway of the study\nis that for people experiencing\nheadache, dizziness,\nand fatigue due to\nTBI and perhaps--\nand I want to underline perhaps\nbecause it hasn't really\nbeen explored yet, but\nperhaps headache, dizziness,\nand fatigue due to\nother conditions\nsymptoms or causes of\nheadache, creatine monohydrate\nsupplementation might be, again,\nmight be an excellent candidate\nfor people to try.\nWhy do we say that?\nWell, first of all,\ncreatine monohydrate\nis relatively inexpensive.\nIt's considered safe at the\ndosages used in this study,\nand certainly for sports\nperformance as well.\nAnd there are very\nfew other compounds\nthat have been shown to have\nas significant an impact\non headache over\nthe long-term as has\ncreatine monohydrate in these\nstudies of people with TBI.\nIt's also important\nto highlight the fact\nthat many, many people suffer\nfrom TBI, as I mentioned\nearlier.\nAnd as now, there are very\nfew treatments for TBI.\nYou tend to get the\nbasic advice coming back.\nAnd again, I think\nit's excellent advice.\nYou get proper amounts\nof sleep, get exercise,\nbut don't get another\ntraumatic brain injury.\nThat's obvious.\nBut you'd be surprised how\nmany people go right back\nto work because they have to.\nAnd we have to be\nsympathetic to the fact\nthat many people just can't stop\nworking or go on disability.\nSo many people have to go back\nto work that could be sport,\nor it could be\nother kind of work\nwhere they are then subject\nto perhaps getting more TBI,\nmaybe they're getting less rest\nas a consequence and stress.\nObviously, stress is\nconfounding issue for TBI.\nBut sleep, exercise,\nsun, nutrition,\nall of those things,\nproper social connection\nare what people are encouraged\nto do when they have TBI.\nBut there have been\nvery few compounds\nin particular, very few\nover-the-counter compounds\nthat are known to be safe\nthat have shown efficacy\nin dealing with TBI.\nSo I think that while\nthis is a pilot study,\nand we can consider\nit preliminary,\nI think it's important\nenough and the effects were\ndramatic enough that people\nwith headache and in particular,\npeople with TBI\nought to consider\nsupplementing with\ncreatinine in order\nto deal with their headaches.\nAnd of course, I eagerly\nawait other studies exploring\nthe role of this high\ndosage of creatine\nor I should say relatively high\ndosage of creatine monohydrate\nfor offsetting headache.\nMeanwhile, I think there\nare a number of people\nout there suffering from\nheadache who might consider\nusing creatine monohydrate\nin an exploratory fashion\nand seeing whether it helps\noffset their headaches.\nKeep in mind, of course,\nanytime you're going to add\nor remove anything\nsupplement or otherwise\nfrom your treatment, your\nnutrition, et cetera,\nI do suggest that you\nconsult with your physician\nin particular, if you\nhave chronic headaches.\nI don't say that to protect me.\nI say that, of course,\nto protect you.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
