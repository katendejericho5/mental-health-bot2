the best part about\nbeing me girl I don't know I I have so\nmuch fun I have a lot of fun I can tell\nI carry a lot but I'm built for it and I\nhave a lot of fun doing it sometimes I\ncomplain about it sometimes I whine but\nI'm built for it and I enjoy it when did\nyou realize you were built for it\nprobably when I was like 21\n22 cuz uh yeah 22 I say 22 because at 21\nI was like I don't want to be here on\nthis planet no more this sucks like\nfeels like everybody's taking their pain\nout on me like but what I realized is\nlike oh I'm I love to hear people\nlaughing maybe they're bringing me their\npain and taking that cuz I'm supposed to\ntransmute into laughter I'm supposed to\ntake that and flip it for them and once\nI learn how to do that and perfect it\nthen the easier it'll be for me and it\nis easier in relationships for me now\nbut um when it comes to other things\nit's a lot more difficult like cleaning\nmy\nroom I'm a I am a hoarder I think I'm\nemotional hoarder and it shows up it\nmanifest in my bedroom what kind of\nthings do you ho clothes okay\nknickknacks gadgets I love gadet gadgets\nI don't know why I bring the gadget to\nthe bed like it's going to do something\nmagical in the bed and it's not even for\nthe bed it's probably for the kitchen\nbut I'm like let me see how this gadget\nwork and I like exper I I'm big on\nexperimenting and I do a lot of it in my\nbedroom cuz that's my layer and I don't\nlet like people in my room so like I got\na microscope in there it's like half\nlaboratory half office half closet half\nwhat is all this over here W so if I\nwalk into the I'm not allowed but if I\nwas to walk into your bedroom would I\nfall over and trip over and hurt myself\nover a basket of clothes and then you'll\nbe like what is that in the corner you\nare you building something like is what\nkind of electronics is that and then\nlike why is there clothes all over here\nand then what's that on the bed and are\nare you making jewelry or you sorting a\njewelry like what is going on wow yeah\nit's a lot going on W you need to show\nme a picture later I'm not g to show you\nno picture it's embarrassing it's EMB\nwhen I look at it I'm like geez Tiffany\nyour brain is everywhere wow that's what\nit feels like yeah I cuz I imagine that\nlike your your bedroom is a reflection\nof your mind mhm cuz it's where I do\nspend most of my time in the house and\nlike all the rest of the house is pretty\nclean it might be some little boxes in\nthe corner here Bo like mail on the\ntable but I go through that sort that\nout real quick but the my room I don't\nknow it's like uh I'll get to that when\nI feel like it I'mma play with this\nright now let me see how these sea\nmonkeys are doing in the corner over\nhere let me see what this is doing like\nI you have pets in your room too I mean\nno it's some sea monkeys are those pets\nI don't know I don't know I don't think\nthose are pets experiment there's a\nthere a there's a\nshrimp but I mean my cat might come in\nthere occasionally and uh if I get\nreally like lonely or whatever I'll\nbring the dog in you know and then the\ndog is like burrowing herself in my\ndirty clothes and I get her out of there\ncuz she likes to chew the crotch in my\nunderwears my dirty underwears I don't\nlike it and you like that chaos like you\nyou you like waking up to that sleeping\nin that that that kind of it feels cozy\nokay I don't have a man I don't have\nnobody else's mind assort but my own so\nyes when men do spend the night I uh\nonly let them sleep in the guest room\ngot it so uh cuz they're guests in my\nhouse until you pay bills you can't come\nup in the in the main room and when they\nstart paying my bills then I guess\nthat's when I'll clean up my room and\nmake space for them I'm a classic Virgo\nso everything for me has to be organiz\norganized like tidy everything has to be\nin its place like I think I can I walk\ninto a room and I can spot the one thing\nthat's like half a centimeter off and I\nneed to\nwould be the kind of guy I would like to\ndate so that he can like clean up after\nme got it and then I'll make him laugh\nand stuff and bring him joy and have a\nventure for him I have some Adventures\nfor you not too much drama I'm not big\non a drama but I am big on adventure\nexperiences and then I'm but I'm messy\nyeah that's cool you're allowed to be\nmessy but I'm not dirty but it's like I\nget it I get yeah and I I mean I I saw\nthat you said you've been celibate for\nthe past six months is that who said\nthat is that true uh okay okay okay so\nis that true I mean does kissing count\nno as that's still sell I'm just not\nyeah okay I'm not being penetrated\nthat's for sure no penetration is that\nan intentional Choice was that something\nyou were trying to work up to and\npractice or is it been six months though\nI guess so I you're the only person who\ncan tell us October does make it six\nmonths yeah yeah um yeah because I don't\njust I just don't want to lay down with\nnobody just anybody you know I just feel\nlike dang I am the prize and these dudes\ngotta qualify like it and when I think\nabout like my track record of like who I\nlay down with it it takes like a year or\nso for for me to even warm up it's it's\na line it's a line of dudes that's you\nknow hey D hey I mean I love going to\nfree dinners I go on free dinner dates\nyou know I mean not free dinner dates\nbut like yeah it's free for me so yeah\nbut it do cost me money to get you know\ncute and stuff and the gas in the car or\nwhatever but yeah yeah know I also\nbecause when I lived as a monk I was\ncelebrate for three years so it was like\na it was a big big big commitment in my\nlife did it make you feel like a in the\nbeginning yes for sure for sure it was\nhard but then I bet it was hard yeah as\ntime went\non oh Tiffany Only You Only You it feels\neasy I don't know I've been working out\na lot so I feel like I get my sexual\nlike frustrations out in the workout and\nthen like I said gadgets did it take you\na while to raise your standards like\nwhere did this qualification this\nlanguage this vocabulary you have right\nnow around dating was that something\nthat has come with time is that\nsomething that was always there that no\nit was definitely not always there\ndefinitely if you read the book you know\nthat it was not always there um I just\nfeel like it's like it's certain things\nthat I want for myself and I want to um\nshare the success and what I've learned\nis when you're like uh laying down with\npeople that's not really as ambitious as\nyou are or comfortable in their skin or\nconfident with who they are or even just\nnot even necessarily confident just know\nwho they are um it becomes a problem and\nand I think when you lay down with\nsomebody you are sharing your soul you\nare sharing a piece of yourself you're\ngiving a little piece of yourself up and\nI don't I think like I only got so much\nSoul left and I don't want to\nnecessarily just give it over to anybody\nyou know I don't think I don't know if\nthe soul grows I don't know if you can\nrejuvenate New Soul like you do skin or\nhair but it just feels like I don't want\nto subject myself to it also now once I\nlet you inside my body I got to know you\ngot to get to know got to learn you and\nall this stuff like and um I had so\nscientifically okay now we gonna get\ninto the science of it some research on\nyeah yeah so I had did my scientific\nresearch I was reading about how you\nknow once you let somebody um\nejaculating sperm right once it the\nuterus is very absorbent so you absorb\nall of that into your bloodstream right\nso now you like attracted to them so\nlike when the Bible says uh you will\nonly desire your husband this is part\nwhy because now he's like in your blood\nlike in like bonding with your DNA and\nif you get pregnant by this person it\ntakes like six months or so for them to\nget out of your DNA and if you decide to\nhave a baby or get pregnant by this\nperson those stem cells from that baby\nis in you forever so they are forever a\npart of you do I forever want to be a\npart of somebody who's like mentally ill\ndo I forever want this person to be like\nin my eyeballs in my brain in my like in\nmy heart the stem cells from them and\nwhat we like you know could have\npotentially made do I forever want that\nand then I think about like like hoes\nand why they be so crazy and it's\nbecause it's too many personal too much\nin it that's how I see it anyway that's\nmy scient that's science when is the\nTiffany edish sex ed masterclass coming\nwell there's a there's a short sex ed\nportion in the book um you know I think\nI would have been a great sex education\nteacher that's what I'm thinking\nlistening to you right now yeah I think\nI would have been really good at that I\nthink we need to get a national program\nyeah cuz I noticed like females that I\nknow that like are really emotional like\ngoing like always the world is like a in\nan uproar and then if you find out like\nhow many body what's their body count\nand like and especially if it's a high\nbody count is a lot of them probably\ndidn't have no condom on and then you\nprobably you probably absorbed a lot of\nthat stuff and who's to say they didn't\nthey might have been pregnant didn't\nrealize they were pregnant and just\nthought oh this is a hard period but\nreally they might have been having a\nmiscarriage or it was just a pregnancy\nthat didn't stick whatever like it's a\nlot it's a\nlot a lot it sounds like this has\nobviously been something that I know\nwe're laughing but at the same time\nwe're learning like this has been\nsomething you've been learning about\nthinking about reflecting on especially\nwhen you dive into your book as we were\ntalking about earlier you make\neverything sound really funny and\nthere's this expression of the feeling\nbut then there's the Deep pain and the\nstress that comes from it were there\nparticular romantic experiences that\nwere hard for you to get over was a lot\nof our audience is struggling with\nbreakups is struggling with missing\ntheir exes struggling with trying to\nmove on and find the right person person\nwhat what have you been through that you\ncould share with those people that may\nhelp uh yeah okay so I'm going to be\nreal clear with you I the people that I\nwas missing I probably shouldn't have\nbeen missing right like the ones that\nlike inflicted a lot of physical pain on\nme the ones that inflicted emotional\npain on me I think I talked about one of\nthem in this book I I know I talked\nabout the the ex in the other book but\nthis book um like okay so I had this\nlike you know homie Ling friend for a\nlong time a long long long long time\nhe's very disrespectful to me very kind\nof messed up to me but in my mind we was\nwe could get married we had the most\nbeautiful babies he handsome I'm pretty\nlike it would be so cool he's smart and\nintellectual I'm kind of smart I think\nlike it would be fun we have the best\nconversations like we have fun but then\nhe would treat me like crap right so\nlike and I would I would subject myself\nto that man and I would be like happy to\nbe in this presence but at the same time\nwhen he's not I'll be hurting so bad\nhurting so bad like in feing form like a\nlike kind of like I don't know what it's\nlike to do like hard drugs but I'm\nimagining that's the hard drug right\nthere the D that D like when you really\nlike like that could be the hard drug\nand breaking myself from that that would\nbe like okay what else do you love what\nelse do you care about put your energy\ninto something else I've seen her like\nall online like oh Tiffany's feing for\nshe's still pining over this guy that\nshe was dating like that was fun that\nrelationship was fun only thing I miss\nabout that relationship is the fun\neverything else was like yeah cool but\nwe had a lot of fun um and people I have\nfun with I miss all of them when I don't\nget to see them often when I don't talk\nto them I miss all of them even if they\nwere a bad influence I I miss them all\nbut I'm not like oh God I got to have\nthem more talking mess about them like\nno I genuinely love that person wish\nthem the best I'm busy doing now they're\nbusy doing that now cool but was there a\nparticular like yeah that one that homie\nlover friend who was like on and off for\nlike almost 20 years oh wow 20 years yes\nI can be loyal I can be loyal with the\nhomie Ling friends you know it's like oh\nwe not we we on but we not in a\nrelationship but in my mind I painted\nthis yeah we was married we was I was\ncooking for him and doing all kind of\nstuff like you know make sure his\ntelephone stayed on so could talk to him\nstupid stuff stupid just dumb just dumb\nthen like oh I realized okay this isn't\ngoing to go nowhere so I'mma go with\nthis guy that likes me and then that\ndon't like pan out cuz really I'm still\nfeing over this dude then okay that\ndidn't work out then I'mma get married\nsomebody want to marry me I'm getting\nmarried you don't want to marry mebody\nelse gonna marry me and then that didn't\nreally P because I I didn't want to get\nsmall like yeah I didn't want to be\nsmall and\nthen sh then it was just like freefor\nall you know what you working with\nwhat's up baby you got as long as you\ngot a good credit score what's your\ncredit score because that means you're\ngonna be responsible with my heart at\nleast I think you are I hope you are and\nthen uh but now I got a whole criteria\nwhat did you find that people had a good\ngood credit score did that have any\ncorrelation with I feel like it it it\nhad a lot to do with how they treat me\ngood credit score they're like more\nresponsible they show up on to I know\nyeah I saw that like I I would ask like\nhey do you know your credit score first\nof all I think that's something you\nshould know cuz that's your grownup\nreport card I just want to see how\nresponsible they were and most of them\nwere very like I I have yet to meet\nsomebody with a pretty high credit score\nthat wasn't like reliable you didn't\nfind that you met people who were\narrogant or show no no they might have\nbeen arrogant they might have been like\nshowbo but they were responsible I want\nsomebody to be responsible with my heart\nlike it's a I got a big heart right got\na lot of love to give and I I'm very\nforgiving and all that but like don't\nabuse it it's been abused enough and I\ndon't want to have to like attack you I\ndon't want to have to like be vicious\nwith you that's what like I would say\nthe last like five relationships I've\nhad like I really respect those dudes\nbecause they were they were kind with my\nheart you know they they for the best\nfor what they could you know they were\ngood good with my heart they didn't like\nit up where I'm just like men I'm bring\non the I'm gay now I think I'm\nstill like two or three heartbreaks away\nfrom that right I don't even think\nthat's a thing though for me I really\nthink I'm a gay man but that's that's\nneither here nor there and what are your\ncriteria\nnow you said I that's a lot of\ninformation I me I think I was a man in\nmy past like you you believe in past\nlives yeah we were talking I think we\nwere messaging about this yeah I think I\nwas a man in my past life and I think I\nwas a man that was kind of messed up I\nthink I was like maybe I had a really\nbig pen and I was a womanizer maybe I\nwas bisexual maybe I hurt a lot of\nhearts and I feel like in this life God\nsaid okay I'mma you know you going to\nsuffer some but you going to win too\nyeah and I think that's why I got\nendometriosis so I can really understand\nthe pain of a woman and understand the\nvalue of the heart my wife jokes with me\nthat she thinks we were married in our\npast life but she was the guy and I was\nthe girl that's like the tradeoff cuz\nI'm the Romantic one I'm the one writing\nher notes and messages and I want to do\nthe grand gestures and stuff and I'm the\none interior designing our home and\ndoing all of that stuff and she does not\ncare now she's like let's get money and\ngo on a trip let's have some fun let's\ngo do an adventure yeah I like Adventure\nI like Adventure but you were saying you\nhave criteria now what are the CR what\nare the criteria to date defy Tiffany um\nokay so now that I'm older I can't have\nthat criteria of like oh he can't have\nno kids because we're older now so I\nexpect like if he has kids cool but they\nneed to be like grown 18 are over uh cuz\nI don't want to deal like with baby mama\ndrama and I feel like you know I want to\nI I like communicating like an adult\nalso he needs to have his own career or\nsome sort of business you know what I'm\nsaying he needs to have like a EIN\nnumber I think that's really important\nhe knows how to needs to know how to run\nsomething because you know men I think\nmen like to uh have control and power\nover women and run a run women and want\nto be the leader well can you how's your\nbusiness does your business run well are\ndo you have do you have long-term\nemployees do you like is that doing well\nlike cuz cuz now I'm if I'm going to\ngive you access to me I need to know\nthat you know how to do that good credit\nscore now I will forgive if maybe your\ncredit score fell off for a minute\nbecause you had to go to the doctor or\nsomething happen you know whatever okay\nI might could forgive that but then also\nI want you to be physically healthy and\nfit so you better be on top of your\nhealth like because I'm trying my best\nwith mine and I don't want to be\nchanging nobody's diapers that's grown\nif you have pubic hairs I don't think I\nshould be changing your diaper yeah I\nfind I find that to be the biggest one\nlike I find so many people don't grow up\ntill so much later in life and I find so\nmany of my friends are either with guys\nor girls or whoever it may be that feel\na young like they feel like they are the\nperson's parent and they're their\npartner's parent and they I don't want\nthat they're cooking for them cleaning\nfor them taking care of all of this\nstuff it's it's it's bizarre to me that\nwe're still living in that time yeah I\ndon't want to feel like I'm your parent\nI don't want to feel like I'm your\ndoctor but if you got like a cold or\nsomething or you feeling like you got a\nlittle back pain I love to rub your back\nand I and I come up with Elixir and\nstuff to make you feel better or\nwhatever yeah but you need to come\nalready showing up pretty healthy like\nthink of this like the military these\nElixir oh these Elixir you know we got\nGinger we got turmeric you know we got\nthe little vitamins nutrients you know\nuh aloe vera things for my garden um you\ngrow some of this

will you have on\nyou at one time I don't know I'll be\nsitting there counting like oh look I\ngot 100y bees like they don't they don't\nsit on me like they go they be around me\nI be singing telling them stories\ntelling jokes maybe complaining um I'm\npretty sure my neighbors hear me um so\nmaybe the neighbors feel like I'm like\ncrazy talking to myself or talking on\nthe phone or whatever I know I sing\nsongs to them all the time uh my\nfavorite song is that I know the bees\nare probably like why is she singing\nthis song to us but I like butterfly\ncome in here you stand up my hand I

bees\nsit Outdoors yeah sit Outdoors laying\nthe grass next to them sometimes just\nlisten to them and imagine they telling\nme stories and I'm just really listening\nto The Hive buzz and it's they say that\nthere's a the C tone or there's a tone\nin a beehive that helps get rid of PTSD\noh I didn't know that wow yeah yeah\nthat's that's what they say when I was\ndoing my research on bees that was\nsomething like that the noise of a hive\nhelps with\nPTSD uh so I like that noise wow that's\nfascinating and that that you learned\nwhile you were getting the bees or\nafterwards or before once I got the bees\nyeah once I got the bees I learned that\nyou know I was like oh I'm in a\nrelationship now with thousands let's\nlet's figure this out how's que um\nthere's a queen bee I'm the I'm I'm the\nmaster queen I'm the friend of the bees\nI feed them I give them like you know\nspirulina with some some sugar water or\nsome like chlorophyll with sugar water\nand stuff like that you like really in\ntouch with nature like nature seems to\nbe I love nature that's where I can like\nyou can go sit in the tree like in the\ntrees but I do be in the trees sometime\nyou can go sit near the trees in the\ntrees and you could cry in the trees are\nnot goingon to be like what's wrong with\nyou you know if anything that like blow\nthe leaves and like rub your shoulder or\nsomething you know yeah wow that's my in\nmy mind that's what I imagine yeah I\nhave a very vivid imagination so and has\nthat always been like that since you\nwere young always been like that always\ndid you have an imaginary friend growing\nup yes I did I had two what were their\nnames\ncarolita and uh\ncracker cracker was a bird and I used to\nbe like Cracker w a poly and I would\nbreak crackers up on my shoulders and\nstuff it was really the imaginary\nfriends was to make real friends I mean\nthey were A coping mechanism for kids as\nwell for sure coping mechanism I felt in\nmy mind they listen to everything I said\nI know exactly what they look like in my\nmind I used really rock them hard in\njunior high and uh used to be like crack\nwhat's answer number seven they be like\nTiffany is being racist I'm like no I'm\nnot I'm talking to my\nbird and carita the carita yeah she's\nlike a Puerto Rican Mommy okay yeah yeah\nand she was what was her role her role\nwas like to keep people away from me\nyeah so I'll be like oh you can't sit\nhere carita sitting there you can't sit\nright there just her seat yeah you know\ncarita said that you cute yeah she want\nto know if you want to uh share your\ncoffee cake with her yeah yeah so she\nwas that in between that go between and\nMak comes close who stay yeah and people\nwould laugh they' be like girl you silly\nas hell it's fascinating isn't it I feel\nlike that whole idea of imaginary\nfriends it's like if you thought about\nthat when you were young you'd laugh at\nit but now when you look back you're\nlike oh wait there was a role that that\nperson played that I didn't have someone\nelse play in my life so I created\nsomeone yeah I would be like my sister\nwould be trying to play with me I be\nlike you can't play carolita says she\ndoing this one you can't do that one\ncarita really I just didn't want my\nsister to be doing it but I didn't want\nto tell her I don't want you to do it so\nI say car didn't want her yeah wow but\nit was really me wow I really didn't\nwant her do so you told us the best\nthings about being Tiffany hadish\nTiffany what are the worst things about\nbeing Tiffany hadish the worst thing\nabout being Tiffany hadish is uh Tiffany\nhad is always under attack and got to\njust let that happen I guess I guess\nthat's just a part of being famous but\nalso I just feel like that's been my\nwhole life is always somebody's been\nhating somebody's talking mess somebody\nbut uh at least back in the 1900s people\ndid it to your face or if they talk\nbehind your back and somebody told you\nthey was talking behind your back then\nyou went up to approach them and say you\nsay this about me they would either say\nyes or no like there would be like you\nknow account you can hold someone\naccountable for what they were saying uh\neven if there was a reporter you know\nyou could call up to the the newspaper\nand say I want to talk to this reporter\nwhy you say this about me and then\nthey'll tell you why they said what they\nsaid right but um now it's like\neverybody say whatever they want and\nthey think they can't be touched but\nthat's why I'm investing in technology\nthat you are yeah allow me to be able to\ncall them okay why you feel like this\nyou what did I do to you did I sleep\nwith your man and I don't know it what\nwhat's the what's the issue with you why\nyou why you putting out such mean words\nI mean I think it's so crazy right now\nwith social media because I mean suicide\nwith teenagers right now is at a all\nwith children alltime High higher than\nit's ever been in the history of because\nthey can read and they're seeing what\npeople say like I work with a lot of\nfoster Youth and my kids they be telling\nme they want they don't want me to be\nfamous no more because they don't like\nwhat people saying about me and it makes\nthem cry it hurts them so while it and\nI'm like don't worry it doesn't bother\nme I'm used to it that's normal it's\nnormal if I was if I didn't have people\ntalking mess about me then I wouldn't be\ndoing good I mean do you believe in\nJesus if you believe in Jesus everybody\nwas talking mess about him too and then\nlook you know and look what happened you\nknow they're like I don't want you to be\nassassinated like Jesus I don't want you\nto die like I'm not going to die okay I\nwill die but I'm not going to die that\nway I'm pretty sure I hope I die during\nsex but I'm not g to die in that way I\ndon't think but you know and I don't\nknow but like we can't Fester on that\nand don't just block that person just\ntake those negative words off your thing\nlike block those words but I would love\nto be able to just call these people\nbecause what I what I found um is the\npeople that be hating usually they\nreally love me they really they study me\nsuper hard they spend hours and hours\nmaking videos and like just saying mean\nstuff and talking about but you spend\nhours of your life studying me there's\nsome love there there's some you got to\nreally care about me to a certain so I'm\nhonored but it sucks because you're not\nbrave enough to say it to my face that\nI'll run into them at party they be like\noh can I get a picture and I'm like why\nwhy do you want a picture with me you\nyou did a horribly mean video about me\noh you saw that you saw yeah I saw you\nput my name in the title

looked up my\nname and so the algorithm knows I care\nabout me so it's going to send me the\nstuff about me so you was seeing I see\nyou and I'mma tell you to your face cuz\nI'm not fake I'm an actual human and I\nwish it was the 1900s where you could\nslap somebody for talking but now\nyou can't even slap nobody no more they\nwant to sue you or whatever like\npunks so that's that's the that's the\nthat's the worst part that's the hard\npart yeah cuz I really want to fight but\nI can't I can't though it's not a battle\nworth fighting right yeah but on my\nperiod I will um use my my fake little\npage and I will chime in in a little bit\noh is it take it back to the 19 a Fina\nyeah Fina that's what they call it right\nfake a fake insta yeah fake in but it's\nnot an insta it's a it's a Twitter oh\nit's a Twitter okay so it's X yeah yeah\nyeah Sarah be going in okay yeah how\ndoes that help it feels good it feels\ngood it's like a little release and this\nis Sarah kind of like calita who's like\nprotecting Tiffany or no Sarah's my\nmiddle name it's me\n[Music]\nit's me but I would love to develop like\na AI boyfriend that like protects me and\nlike make him look really good and stuff\nand he has the you know Instagram\naccount and just like program him to\nprotect me and to like shut down people\nand like yeah but I found out I hired a\nforensic uh Tech guy and I found out\nlike 75% of the hate I get is Bots it's\nnot even real people and the other 25%\nis people responding to the Bots or\nmaking making videos because of what\nthey read from the\noh my go not even real a lot of these\narticles be AI articles not even real\narticles no way yeah it's my name but\nthat's how powerful my name is like\nthat's what at least that's what they\nmake me think like my name is so dope\nlike they want those clicks they want\nthat you know like I did this to like I\ngot all these clicks now all these\nfollowers because I talk about\nTiffany like it's kind of dope it's kind\nof dope it's kind of dope but key like\nhot words will bring in the Bots yeah\nyeah yeah wow I'm learning a lot from\nyou\ntoday sexed it's like yeah I'm I'm\nmultifaceted a little it's great it's\namazing I I love how curious your mind\nis like I've I've already learned about\nbees like it's fascinating it's\nfascinating I I want to go backwards\nTiffany because I feel like one of the\nthings you do in this book is you really\nled us into some of the the trauma the\nchallenges the the difficult experiences\nand as I said to you before what I find\namazing about the way you communicate is\nthat we feel what you've felt even if\nwe've not been there and I think the way\nyou're writing this book is really\npowerful like you said earlier you said\nI think I'm smart you're smart because\nthe way you express yourself lands and\nresonates even if you just read one or\ntwo lines that just grab hold of you and\nat the same time you're making everyone\nlaugh through the book too but I want to\nkind of go backwards because you did\nhave a really you've had you had many\ndifferent challenging traumatic\nrelationships in your life I want to\nstart with your mother because she went\nthrough something horrific herself which\nwhen I when I read about that I was I\ncan't even believe what she's had to go\nthrough and then how it impacted on you\nI was going to ask you has that\nrelationship ever had an opportunity to\nheal or improve like getting better\npossible better and better every day\nbetter and better every day cuz I have a\nbetter understanding you know um I used\nto be really mad at her and really like\nupset with her like just take your meds\njust just heal already just be back to\nmy mommy my like my everything you know\nI always think about this time when um\nlike I love that woman I like really\nreally really love that woman like like\nimmensely like that's my first love this\nwoman fed me clothed me taught me I love\nthis woman and it's like she came back\nfrom that accident somebody else not not\nthe woman that I love but that's her\nthat's her Meats suit that's her body\nbut that's not my mommy and I get\nglimpses of her and as time has gone by\nand you know I've I've used my money to\nlike get her the best of the best and\nget her healthy and get her on track and\num and get get my sister the education\nmy sister's helping me like we help each\nother we we are working as a team right\nand U to see like the progress is like\nit's such\na it's like okay what say money's a rot\nof all evil but if you know how to use\nit right it's a tool and if you know how\nto use it right you can help like heal\nand get like glimpses of what was and\num I remember when I was a little girl I\nwanted to like just make her happy\nthat's all I want to do make her happy\nand she would work these graveyard uh\nhours at the post office and I was like\nthree and and I wanted to make her eggs\ncuz she would come in and make me eggs\nright and I used to always try to cook\nfor her always I pull all the pots and\npans and everything out like I'm I'm\ngonna cook for my mommy and I'm G play\nmusic too like like waste all this food\nI put oh me a wishes your sauce large\nseason sauce all this stuff and like she\nbe like no no stop messing around my\nstuff and I get a spanking this one\nparticular day though I was determined\nto make her some eggs so I did\neverything I saw her do the day before\nso I got uh I got the eggs out the\nrefrigerator I did all the eggs all the\neggs I didn't take the shells off of\nthem put all the eggs in this tupperware\nbowl I stirred it all up I put pepper I\nput garlic salt I put Larry seasoning\nsalt stirred them all up stirred them\nall up stir them all up and then I\nturned on the fire on the stuff and I\njust put the Tupperware container on top\nof the fire and I was turning I was like\nwhy is it not doing what it's supposed\nto do and then it's like plastic it's\nlike smoking and it's burning and my mom\ncomes in there and she had just got off\nwork right so she's in the bathroom\nwhatever my mom comes what are you doing\noh my goodness she gives me a whooping\nshe turn you know turns off the fire\ncleanser gives me a spank and says you\nnot supposed to do this you don't touch\nthe stove you don't this and I was just\nlike I try to make you breakfast make\nyou breakfast and she stopped and this\nis what I loved about my mommy this\nshe's the best mommy she was the best\nwhat I loved about her she stopped right\nand she was like I'mma teach you if you\ngoing to keep doing this I got to teach\nyou how to do this so we cleaned the\nstove and everything together she got\nsome when got some more eggs cuz I had\ndid all the eggs I had did all the eggs\nshe got more eggs and stuff we went to\nthe grocery store she said this how you\nbuy the eggs this how you this this how\nyou that we get home she's like okay\nI'mma show you how to make this and she\ngot another Tupperware ball she said\nthis is just for mixing okay and you use\nthis and you do a dash like that and do\nthe dash and I do the dash and she did\nyou this then the dash I did the dash\nand did in a dash right and she's like\nstirring it up she showing me how to\nStir It Up I Stir It Up and she said\nokay now you see this Skillet there's a\ncast iron skillet you put the eggs in\nhere always in the cast iron and then\nyou have to have butter Tiffany so the\neggs can slide and then she should give\nme the butter and then she let me scoop\nthe butter and put the butter in there\nand she said now you turn the fire on\nbut you don't turn it on super high you\nturn it on medium because you don't want\nyour eggs to burn okay I'm like okay\nit's I turn it on medium and then she's\nlike very good very good and I pour the\neggs in there and I pour it and she said\npour it in slow you don't got to pour it\nfast oh oh slow slow and she said now\ntake your thing your spoon and spin Stir\nIt stir it this is scramble eggs you\nmaking scramble I like scramble scramble\nI was so happy I so happy now I had got\nmy I got my ass L I almost burned down\nthe house and now she's teaching me how\nto do it and we did it and we ate the\neggs together and I I just remember I\nwas like like in love with this woman\nfor teaching me this and then she's like\nnow you have to clean up when you cook\nyou got to clean so then it was then we\ncleaned the dishes together and then\nafter that I was her dishwasher I always\nwash the dishes whenever she cooked I\nwas in there trying to cook with her I\nmean I was cutting up vegetables and\nstuff at three and four years old like I\nwas the Su Chef I was always like I\nwanted to be her best friend help her\neverything like and she taught me a lot\nlike every like I have grocery shopping\nall that my sisters was born I'm\nchanging diapers I'm making bottles I'm\nher best helper I'm her everything like\nthat was I loved her I still love her\nbut I miss that Mommy I miss that Mommy\nand I'm her helper now um but she like\nto fight me so we gotta be careful\nbecause I can't be shown up to work with\na black\neye cuz she different now I miss that\nmommy though iord of my imag how hard it\nis to know\nsomeone that intimately that\nclosely and then they're not that person\nbecause of a horrific accident that she\nhad so it was totally out of her control\nand now not only do you have to get to\nknow this new person you miss this\nperson that you just so beautifully\ndescribed when did you start even\nletting yourself process that grief\nbecause I can imagine it's just shock\nprocessing that grief I mean I don't\nknow I think I think when my grandma\npassed who's my first best friend um who\nI still miss terribly I think that's\nwhen\nuh I think that's when I start really\nlike okay like the last since she's been\ngone it's been two years I think it's\nbeen the hardest two years in my whole\nexistence cuz that was my shield that\nwas my like protector I could tell her\nall my\ndreams like if she would be like when if\nyou want to do that you better figure\nthis out you better figure like she was\nlike a good sounding boy for me and it's\nmy first best friend and I don't even\nsome days I don't even know how I get\nout the bed cuz I miss her so much but\nthen also I don't want to let her down\nand she put she installs so much like um\nno don't give up don't be a quitter like\nwe know we not quitters over here so you\ncan't quit so figure it out even if you\ngot to half ass do it half ass do it get\nit done figure it out and so that's what\nI do but I also had to like learn to\nlike I I've been learning how to grieve\nI've been learning how to sit in and and\nlike some people tell me I shouldn't\nmake jokes out of everything but that's\nhow I process yeah and I think you use\nthe same the same muscles the muscles\nthat you use to cry same muscles you\nused to laugh it hurts so much when you\ncry I mean sometimes because I cry so\nhard I throw up and it is like even\nthough I could use the apps but it's\nlike I don't want I don't want that I\nrather have the ABS from laughing so\nhard I rather like so I'll get to a\npoint where I'm like oh miss my grandma\nand I'll try to remember something I'll\nclick on something that's like in my\nbrain like I'm clicking on like opening\nfiles up like in the library remember\nthose index where you have I'm like okay\nuh oh when we made a sweet potato pie\nwhen we went to the fair together and\nleft everybody behind oh when we did\nlike try to like click to the the good\nmemories to the to the fun stuff even\nthough there was a lot of hard stuff but\nlike I mean I still got her wigs I'll be\nputting on her wigs sometimes and like\nI'm getting afraid cuz they starting to\nlose her scent but you\nknow I still it's in the back of my\nmemory is in there sitting there but\nlike yeah and I've been grieving my mom\nI guess I've been grieving her my whole\nlife my oh like teens and 20s and 30s\nand all that but not not really focused\non it so much as grieving because the\nthe flesh is still here and I know she\nin there somewhere and I could get\nlittle sometimes little like a little\nfix she in there\nsomewhere that's when you wish I had I\nwish I had magical powers I could\njust mommy's back oh my God that would\nbe crazy though because she was super\nthirsty for knowledge too she calls me\nsometimes we got her a cell phone and\nshe been using it but she keep on trying\nto buy stuff so uh we had to be careful\nlike what don't put no credit card on it\ndon't assign it to know nothing because\nshe would want to buy stuff and she\ncalled me and said um I need to go to\ncollege I'm trying to go to college I\nneed to go get certified in culinary\narts I to go get certified in dog\ngrooming I need to get certified in My\nDemo Deluxe program I'm like demo Deluxe\nshe's like yes samples food samples in\nmarketing in grocery stores I was like\nwell I'm building a grocery store so\nthen you could just you know do Demos in\nthe grocery store you don't got to get\ncertified I got you she like no no but I\nneed to go to college I need to I need\nto go to school okay I have to go to\nschool and I'm like okay Mama well like\nand that makes me excited that she wants\nto learn that she wants to go to school\nbut then I'm like concern do I let her\ngo to school do I send her to this\nCommunity College where she potentially\nmight have an episode and fight somebody\nor she might disturb the class start\ntalking or she starts seeing things and\nstarts screaming at them or you know\nlike do ey loudest and like well if we\ngive her too much medication and she\nlike falls asleep in the class and she\nstarts snoring super loud and they put\nher out and then we can't find her and\ndo I hire a nurse to go to school with\nher do I like okay you trying to go to\nschool then you got to go to school with\nmy mama and y'all take the same classes\nlike do I pay for somebody else at\nschool to go to school with my mom and\nprotect my mom and make sure she don't\neat too much candy and make sure she\ndon't eat no junk food and stuff like\nbecause that that when she eats junk\nfood or processed foods that sends her\nover the edge and now she's like in\nanother dimension and am I blocking my\nmama from these Dimensions because maybe\nher being in those other dimensions is\nreally good material and I need to be\nsitting with her when she talking to\nthese people that I don't see and maybe\nthat's like something I could use for a\nmovie or something I don't know and\nmaybe God gave her this this like brain\ninjury to see over there and maybe she\nreally protected me and I don't even\nknow it I'm blocking my protection\nbecause I feel like my grandma was my\nshield and my protection but now that's\ngone and I don't have the protector no\nmore so I gotta figure out who's\nprotecting me it's right now it's just\nme my prayers and I think my sister my\nsister is definitely we we work well\ntogether so and your faith oh my faith\nis definitely protected yeah that's why\nsay my prayers yeah yeah like yeah I\nmean God is that that's my\ndad I lost my actual biological physical\nfather but I feel like God's been my dad\nall this time I've always believed in\nGod always had a relationship been very\nmad at him a lot but you know it is what\nit is yeah I still love him very much\nyeah I mean as I'm as I'm listening to\nyou it's it's so challenging to think\nthat you have someone in front of you\nwhere you know that the person you love\nis inside of them and like you said you\nget the glimpses but then at the same\ntime like you said it can get abusive it\ncan be violent it can because of the\nbrain injury and then when you look at\nyour relationship with your father and\nyou go to in-depth in the book and I\nwant people to read the book but I\nbelieve your father left when you like\nthree or four yeah and you always had\nthis fixation of wanting to reconnect\nwith him and you talk about in the book\nhow like any back of the head you see\nthat look like your father it's like\nyou're like you're like dad daddy dad is\nthat my dad are you my dad like you know\nthat book are you my mother like are you\nmy daddy are you my daddy like so\nwanting a dad I needed I needed that\nlike I think if I would have had him I\nprobably I might not be who I am today\nfor sure I wouldn't be who I am today\nand that would be a very just oh a\ntragedy but maybe I wouldn't have slept\nwith so many dudes maybe I wouldn't have\nbeen so like thirsty for attention or\nmaybe I would have learned how to live\nwith the man and been a better wife and\nbeen a be a better girlfriend and\nunderstand men better like but I think\nlike everything happens the way it's\nsupposed to even though like I wish\nthere was some male that was there that\nI felt safe with that could show me on a\nregular basis how to be around men and\nnot like how I learned how to be around\nmen which was like I was a tomboy and I\nwas like oh yeah I can do that too like\nstupid told you were figuring it out you\nwere figuring out I was figuring it out\nbut dang but how much time would I have\nsaved you know and my dad probably would\nhave felt so much less guilt had he been\naround you know but my mom was\nthreatening to put him in jail get him\ndeported or whatever so I get it I get\nit he want to go back to a war I get it\nyeah but you were able to reconnect with\nhim yeah from what when you read about\nthat you're like wow like because You'\nthink most people would have resentment\nand bitterness and have this like angst\nagainst this person but actually you\nwere just like this is amazing yeah well\nsee I wanted to have that I thought I\nthought that's what I would have I\nthought I would kick him in the balls\nand be like why' you even have sex with\nmy mama and make me and leave me behind\nlike I thought I would be like so mean\nto him and mad with him but that's not\nwhat my soul was feeling my soul was\nfeeling like okay this is our new\nadventure this is amazing like oh he's\nway handsomer than mama said he's\nactually way Kinder than what she said\nhe's actually this like like everything\nthat I was told was like the opposite\nand then like everything my grandma told\nme was kind of like right on point which\nI should have been listening to her she\nwas my best friend I should have\nlistened to her from the first but you\nknow the love of my life is telling me\nthese things so I'm believing what she\nsaid and like to be in his presence was\nlike the little girl the three-year-old\nand me was so happy and I was kind of\nupset that I was too big for him to pick\nup like I wanted him to pick me up and\nhold me and put put me on his hip and I\nstill kind of got this fixation with\nthat where I like I kind of would like\nto start a service where like retired\nbasketball players can hold you like a\nbaby that's amazing like you pay them\nlike $300 an hour and they just hold you\nlike a baby and tell you it's going to\nbe okay and Pat you on the back and burp\nyou why is nobody burps you anymore I\nwant somebody to burp me that's\nhilarious I'm just got this vision of\nlike Shaq like I asked Shaq Shaq said\ngirl you crazy you so damn you actually\nasked him yeah I asked him he was like\ngirl you Sil what did you ask him I said\nwould you hold me like a baby and like\nthen burp me and he was like girl you\ncrazy you so damn silly was like have\nyou asked any other BL I have mentioned\nit and they just laugh they I think they\nthink I'm joking but I'm dead serious I\ndon't even laugh when I say it I'm like\nwould you hold me like a baby and then\nlike put me over your should and burp me\nand then like maybe hold me on your hip\nlike this\nand just tell me it's going to be okay\nthat everything going to be all right\nwould you do that for me and they be\nlike you crazy girl so stupid girl you\nstupid as hell girl this you hear\nTiffany sh D comedian this a comedian\nright here girl it's a real request\nthough I can hear what you're saying\nlike there's we all want this feeling of\nbeing embraced and being like just\nfeeling like nothing else matters and\nthat everything's taken care of and\nthere's a safety that we're all craving\neven if that's like when I see my mom\nnow like uh like see her all the time\nbut but it's like right I could tell\nwhen my cycle coming right before it\ncome cuz I see her and I just want her\nto hold me so I just hug her super tight\nshe be like get off okay okay like all\nright that's enough and I'm like no momy\nhomie she like that's enough that's\nenough clearly My love language is touch\nright so then uh another time she was\nsitting on the couch in my house\nwatching TV and she's just like this TV\nis so big and I felt so proud of myself\nthat she said my TV so big so then I sat\ndown next to her and then I just tried\nto like crawl up in her lap I tried to\nlike get in her lap and she's like girl\nyou're too big get off of me get off of\nme and I'm just like I want her to hold\nme in her lap like she used to when I\nwas a baby when I was little I said sit\nin her lap and watch TV L lean on her\nlike this you know we watch TV together\nbut I'm too big now I'm too damn\nbig walk me through that phone call with\nyour dad when it comes out of nowhere\nbecause you're so much how old are you\nin that c 26 about to be so we talking\nabout 34 to 26 27 it's like walk me\nthrough okay so I talked to this man\nthat's at some facility said he knows my\ndad whatever he's going to give my dad\nthe number and all of stuff and I said\nokay cool then like days go by and then\nI get the car and he's like hello is\nthis Tiffany and I'm like I knew like my\nwhole soul knew instantly who he was\nlike it's like DNA like recognition or\nsomething like the little girl in me lit\nup like like I like if I was like laying\non the couch sleep was like Daddy was\nlike Daddy is that you and um I was like\nyes he was like this is th your father\nI'm like daddy where you\nbeen where you been are you sure you're\nmy dad how you know wait are you sure\nyou're my dad like and I was asking him\nquestions about family members he knew\nstuff that nobody else would know except\nlike him and my mama would know and I\nwas like where are you when can I see\nyou I need to see you I miss you um\nwhere you been why you ain't come and\nget me\nlike I just wanted him to keep\ntalking that that voice man I can't I'm\nnot very good at impersonating it but I\ngot like a lot of voicemails I always\nask him like if if I don't answer please\nleave me a voice message I got his voice\nmessages and I be listening to him make\nme feel better\nlike I miss\nhim I was missing him like I barely knew\nhim and I was missing him right so like\nI be loving people too much I think uh\nbut I knew it was him\nimmediately I wanted to see him\nimmediately or set up a time for me to\ngo and visit him uh so drive up to\nVirginia went up to\nVirginia and I went to see him as soon\nas I saw him it was like my whole soul\nrejoiced so happy he's very handsome I'm\nglad I met him like in that way instead\nof like in some night club or something\ncuz I probably would have tried to hit\non him or\nsomething I thought it was beautiful and\nwe just talked and talked and talked and\nI was just like trying to crawl in his\nlap but I'm bigger than him bigger than\nhim I was trying to get him to hold me\ntrying to spend as much time with him as\nI could and like he was feeling a lot of\nguilt he's like I should have been there\nfor this I should have been there for\nthat and I'm like yeah you should have\nbut you here now like we got this now\nlike and just getting to know him and I\nwas asking him all these questions like\nis it true that I'm Jewish my grandma\nalways said said this is this true he\ngoes yes this is true but this and this\nand this and this is what happened and I\nhad to leave and I had to this and and\nI'm just like wow like asking them so\nmany questions what was it like for you\nwhen you was a little boy did you use\ntoilet in a hole did you use toilet in a\ntoilet like did you have like what did\nyou have and he's like yeah we had money\nwe had a toilet I went I had Italian\nclothes I had this I got I learned\nGerman I learned this language I know\nthis I know that like eight languages\nlike I just was constantly like I feel\nlike I was interrogating them the time\nand then he came to California and then\nI would take him to go see my mom but\nthen I would like snap at him and stuff\ncuz it would be this part of me that's\nlike damn I'm doing all this for\nyou when you gonna do something for me\nbut like then I had to check myself like\nhey he gave us life like be nice like\nbut sometimes I would be man especially\nlike and he would get he would get the\nbusiness if I drank sometimes I would\nget like really like lit and\nremorseful then I would call him and I\njust cuss him out I just give him on I'm\nlike that was a ho cuz you wasn't there\nI was this because you didn't show you\ndidn't teach me how to do this did he\ndid hear that yeah he did hear it he\nheard it from the drunk side of me when\nyou were you funni at when you were\ndrunk like that or no that was like\nintense no I was intense I was sitting\non the porch I was like I married this\nman I shouldn't have married this man I\nlike yeah I was at home drinking the man\nit's on my nerves I'm like what did I do\nI ruined my life like I this isn't who\nI'm supposed to be with but clearly I\nwas supposed to be there cuz I needed to\nlearn some things and I learned a lot\nfrom that relationship and I'm grateful\nfor that relationship but I would never\ngo back I remember sitting on the porch\njust crying to my daddy about how like I\nmade all these bad decisions and bad\nchoices cuz I didn't have my daddy to\nguide me and I need I need my dad I need\nI need you like and he's like I will get\nthe place with you don't have to be with\nthem I will get the place and you can\nhave your own room and you can have your\nown this and he never did do that he\nnever got to that level cuz he wasn't\nmentally allward he needed to be like he\nwas and that man witnessed a\nwar and then came here and witnessed a\nwhole bunch of other horrible things\nthat like I could only imagine and then\nthe guilt that he was feeling for like\nabandoning his country you know\nabandoning his daughter doing not like\nhe's feeling super duper guilty and then\nhe's learning learning how to grieve too\nhis mother died his daddy died his\nbrothers are all dead all he got his\naunties and they you know if they're\nanything if they would if they were\ndoing to him anything like what they do\nto me um and they probably did it to him\nmore\num I just you know yeah I I pray for him\nI pray for his soul I feel like oh man\nthis God to feel horrible he probably\nfelt like on a daily\nbasis\nso I really and then the next day I\napologize so tough\nfor going off on him like that and I'm\nlike I should have never did that he's\nlike no it's okay you know my friends my\nfriends always like how is your daughter\nso nice to you and you didn't even raise\nher I raised my daughters and my\ndaughter's so mean to me and evil to me\nand your daughter's nice and kind to you\nand loves you like my daugh maybe I\nshouldn't have been there for my\ndaughter maybe she would be nice to me\ncuz my daughter's mean to me and then\nwhen I was mean to him he's like telling\nall his friends she's falling was mean\nto me she cussed me out she was me that\nmake like he could fit in with his group\nof friends or whatever but he's like\nit's okay you got to express yourself\nyou got to let that out express yourself\nand I'm like no but it's wrong because I\nreally do love you I really do\nappreciate you giving me life even\nthough I hate this life a lot of days\nlike lot a lot of days I hate even like\nman why couldn't I have just been a tree\nlike why could just stay in one place\nand watch the world change around me\nlike uh but then trees get abused too so\nyeah for sure for sure there's there's\nthere's a great yeah I mean trees live\nthrough a lot but and they' SE a lot and\nthey've been through they live through a\nlot of abuse yeah for sure but there's\nso much in what you're saying that I\nthink resonates so deeply with me this\ncuriosity and context around how our\nparents became who they were is so huge\nlike to actually have context of how\nyour dad became your dad how your mom\nbecame your mom this isn't a matter of\nwhose fault is it it's all your fault\nit's account it's not that it's let's\nunderstand people's story yeah so I\ndon't feel that like that it's your\nfault yeah that it's not my fault it's\nnot your fault you had these experiences\nand I think I like to imagine that\nthere's a contract that you signed with\nGod before you got here that says hey\nthis is the stuff you're going to go\nthrough so you can accomplish these\nthings and maybe their job was just to\nmake me maybe their their job was to you\nknow be in certain people's lives and\nfind this thing and then activate this\nperson for that and activate this person\nfor this um maybe that was their job\nmaybe that's the contract they signed\nand I hope my mom has like a whole bunch\nmore stuff to do uh and lives a lot\nlonger and and I hope I do get her into\ncollege and like she doesn't fight the\nteachers or anything like that like uh I\nhope that it turns out great and she\ndoes get her certification in culinary\narts and she's able to cook and do\nwhatever it is she wants to do like\nwhatever her dream is I want her to have\nher dream um and I want to I would love\nto facilitate it but also I want to\nprotect the safety of others at the same\ntime and the you know the mental sanity\nof others because you have to set up a\nprivate school yeah maybe it set up a\npriv maybe I have professors come to\nteach her but she wants to go yeah yeah\nshe wants to so maybe I set it up like\nyou know hire some actors and you know\nsome teachers you know like she's at\nschool you're at school and then maybe\nthey are psychologist like you know\nmaybe that maybe she's work study maybe\nshe's a study maybe it's a study program\nwhere there's all therapist in the room\nbut they studying culinary arts and they\nseeing how someone with this type of\ndamage in their brain operates in this\ntype of environment you know what I\nshould make some money off of\nthat that could that could contribute to\nthe generational wealth I'm trying to\ncreate for this\nfamily did you always you know honestly\nTiffany I think when people read this\nbook they they're going to laugh as I'm\nlaughing right now and they're also\ngoing to\nfeel I and I'm not just saying this as\nflattery and I'm not just saying it\nbecause you're here I I really do mean\nthis it's very rare to meet someone\nwho's been through as much as you have\nand hear it in a processed thoughtful\nway yes it's hilarious but it's also\nprocessed was what else apart from\nComedy was your therapy like what else\nhas been part of this healing journey to\nhelp process actual therapy order\ntherapy yeah I was like ordered by the\ncourse to go to therapy eventually and\nlike uh that helped a lot and some\ntherapists were really good and some\nwere like horrible and I felt like I was\nlike sitting in a therapist office just\ndoing stand up for them because they're\ngiggling and laughing and stuff and I'm\nlike wa Heal Me heal me like get get the\npain away like uh give me where I can\nlike function and and they would make\nsuggestions and those suggestions\nactually like did make a difference that\none therapist that said like get back to\ndoing standup as a hobby just do it as a\nhobby and that turned into a full-blown\nliving and I appreciate appreciate her\nfor saying that but like um actual\ntherapy actually reading books like\nactually like reading different books\nabout like\nself-care like self-care stuff and and\nmaybe there be like you read this 300\nPage book and it' be like one thing in\nit that I could take with me I man\nLouise Hayes I love me some Louise Hayes\nthat lady oh if if she was still alive I\nremember when she died I cried for it if\nshe was still alive I I kiss I kiss her\nright on her third eye and say thank you\nkiss her right on her third eye amazing\nyeah CA that like her her like mantras\nthe uh you could heal your body book\nlike even though I don't know if those\nthose mantras really help I do them\nanyways you know just distract my mind\nfrom whatever that's going on uh I don't\nthink the one for endometriosis works I\nthink we got to we got to rewrite that\none\nbut but but I mean just just those thing\nlike the self-care self-care being\nself-aware like um and it's a process\nyou know look I've been drinking I've\nbeen drinking

alkaline\nthat's what I would tell myself got it\nbut it takes the pain away it would take\nthe pain away from me and now and now it\nnow you don't use that to take the pain\naway so so you just sit in the pain\nwhich you ain't got processed\nit with your\nfather I felt\nlike ultimately his guilt and shame kind\nof made you feel like you lost him again\nbecause that was so heavy for him that\nhe kind of distanced himself he\ndistanced himself from me I think he\nknew he was sick and then he didn't want\nme to see him like that and he didn't\nwant to have to depend on me because he\nknew I would take care of him like he\nknew I he never wanted money he never\nlike you talk about he didn't want money\nfrom you he didn't want to be a part of\nyour Fame it wasn't it wasn't that no\nand I would still like quietly pay the\nlight bill send groceries to his house\nand so he'd be like don't do that I got\nlike he wanted to take care of but he\nwasn't capable of taking care of me he\nwas sick and I think he didn't want me\nto know that or have anything to do like\nI think he felt like this was his\npunishment or whatever for whatever wow\nbut he left like a whole like memor like\nwhat I need to do how I need to do it\nand I did it all like I'm obedient when\nit come to my parents at least I try to\nbe I definitely am obedient did you end\nup organizing the funeral and attending\nor he didn't want no funeral oh wow okay\nbut um he didn't want that he he didn't\nwant me spending any money on him cuz he\nfelt like he didn't spend nothing on me\nbut I did but he didn't want to be\nburied with his mother so I um and it's\nagainst the tradition of create he did\nnot like he's like they're going to be\nmad at you but you know I don't want you\nspending all that money to take me back\nlike go ahead and cremate me take me and\nput me with my mom and I told him if I\ncremate you I'll put half of you with\nyour mama and half of you in my garden\ncuz you never really f me anyway so you\nhave to grow me some\nfood and I did that and did I just I\njust read this thing like last year that\nif you have a cemetery in your backyard\nyour property taxfree if you got family\nmembers like buried in your backyard I\nwas like hm I wonder if Ash just count\ncuz I need get this property tax is\nkilling me wow how do you come across\nall this interesting I'm always digging\nfor information especially when it comes\nto my money and my health like so yeah I\nwas just looking for tax breaks also I\nsaw that you know Trump buried you know\nhis peoples in on the golf course and\nthen now they don't have to pay no tax\nover there I think I did see that yeah\nyeah so I was like oh what can I do here\nin South Central LA I'm like bab my\ndaddy's over here near the cagin he by\nthe chili peppers and the\nmints let us know if that goes through\nlet us know if you figure out they told\nme\nno I already went to the city and tried\nit I was like my father is in the\nbackyard they was like no you need to\nexume the body I was like well it's\nashes I can't really I'm sure the plant\ndone ate him up two years ago that was\nback in 2017 you know so I'm pretty sure\nhe's gone gone gone but yeah you talking\nabout taking care of your money and your\nhealth you were saying there was one\npoint in time where you had like a\nbillboard up for your show but then you\nstill had like a you know like\na Obama phone I think you called it like\nthis idea of like you've always tried to\nfigured that out even now like at one\npoint you lived homeless when you were\ngrowing up in your teens and like living\nin a car but now you still live in the\narea you grew up in yeah and and that's\nto inspire others to see what's possible\nand see that you can still move because\nusually people make it and then they\nleave right but you you really felt that\nthat was important I felt it important\nto stay um also I like it over there I\nfeel safe over there and I want to be\nwhere I'm\nyou know I don't want to be where I'm\ntolerated I want to be where I'm wanted\nso it's staying in the hood I just feel\nlike I'm a great example to these other\nkids like look Tiffany couldn't read\nthat good Tiffany couldn't read at all\nfor a minute Tiffany couldn't this\nTiffany couldn't that and look what she\nhad she on the billboard right on the\ncorner front of the house she on that\nhouse right there and like three other\nhouses on this street she also doing\nthis she doing that like she doing stuff\nin a community like I'm a firm believer\nof like oh if my community is like\nmessed up I don't have to leave my\ncommunity I can stay right here and I\ncan make it better now if if I was like\nif I was the gang member maybe it'd be\nmore difficult but maybe I could be\ninfluencing the other people in the gang\nto like okay we gonna do this now this\nis what the gang's going to do now this\nis what we doing now that now you're the\nmanager you the security you the this\nlike you got to buy a house now you have\nto buy a house now it's some it's funny\nwhen somebody buys a house how they like\nperspective changes on what type of\nactivities they participate in oh\ninteresting like that's what I've\nnoticed anyways from like my hood\nfriends like people in the community\nlike what they was all about fighting\nall about this all about but as soon as\nthey bought a house they like oh no I\ncan't be doing all that I got to cut my\ngrass I gotta this I got to do this I\nneed to make my mortgage I need to do\nthat like I got to go to work I got to\ndo this like it kind of changes the\nactivity that you participate in like\nyou might still be a thug and still be a\ngangster but I got to go get my money\nand I don't have time to be fighting you\nI don't have time to be like potentially\nkilling you and losing my house even\nthough house could help me post bail\nlike I just also never always be telling\nthem like I can't imagine

Journey\nas well when you're talking about your\nimagination and even your\nsolutions for wanting a basketball\nplayer to hold you and make you feel\nlike a baby or you know just the way\nyour imagination Works to solve things\nlike what is your imagination saying\nabout creative artistic expressive\nprojects like where do you not what's\nnext because I don't I don't find that\nquestion interesting but in the sense of\nlike where do you let your imagination\nrun free and how do how do you allow it\nto do that so that you can explore this\namazing world you have inside your head\nyes Tiffany land uh I wish I wish could\nbe an amusement park black unicorn\nIsland yeah black unicorn Island yes\nokay that's the next book okay so well\nit's been running so like with music I\nlove creating music like I said I like\nsinging to the bees I like singing I've\nbeen uh preparing like I got a band and\nso uh I've always been kind of in love\nwith like the 40s the 30s the 20s you\nknow that Jazzy era the 50s and singing\nin a like a Supper Club and doing that\nso I just performed at verb last month\nand it was like super dope it was so\nmuch fun no that was this month actually\nit was super fun and like I had this\nlike classic dress on and singing these\nsongs now I am not the best singer but\nyou know what if Bob Dylan could make a\ncareer out of it I could too that's how\nI feel about it like you don't it's not\nabout how well you sing is about how\nentertaining you are like how do you\nmake how do you make them feel it's all\nabout how you it that's what\nentertainment is it's like well you\ncontain these people and you make them\nfeel a certain type of way and is it a\nfeeling that they want to walk away and\nsay Hey I want other people feel that\ntoo that was kind of great that was\namazing or that was an experience right\nso like I'm very like about that so I'm\nsinging like old songs from the 30s and\n20s and 40s and 50s and then some of my\noriginal songs that I've made and I've\nbeen working with like Dian Warren\nwriting some really dope songs to like\nEmpower women Empower people anyways and\nthen like a really cool breakup song\nit's like my favorite I want you but I\nwant you gone I need you but I need you\nout of my\nlife I love it that's so good it\ndid then then like all the movies I want\nto make right so like uh somebody was\nask like you said you want to make 80\nmovies by the time you're 50 you got a\nlong way to go and I'm like I didn't say\nI want to be in all those movies I want\nto create opportunity for other people\nto tell their stories and I'm just\nproduc on it I'm being a part of the\ncreation process like we still haven't\nshot the flowjo movie got to get that\nscript right like and I could just\nimagine how dope that's going to be the\nnails the hair me running all fast my\nbody like you know and hey if I'm too\nold okay I'm too old give someone else\nthe opportunity or AI is coming in real\ngood but um tell that love story between\nher and her husband uh and and\nthen I want to do I want to see the Eda\nJames story I want to see that like cuz\nshe grew up in foster care like me she\nbeen through the ringer had to perform\nas a kid and all the different homes she\nwas in like I want to see that story\nalso I want to do some kind of like a\ndocumentary or something about like all\nthese successful women I have never met\none successful woman that has not been\nthrough like any woman that I have\never met or heard of that's successful\nhas has like been beat up in some kind\nof way physically emotionally mentally\nsomething been beat up some kind of way\nand bounce back and like stood strong T\ntoes down I'mma make this happen and it\nhappens right um and I want to do\nsomething about that cuz I I think right\nnow too like there's so many young girls\nthat like that I've talked to that seem\nto feel hopeless feel like you know\nwhat's the point like no like nobody\ncares about me and it's like there are\npeople that about you you just can't see\nthem right now you haven't met them yet\nor you have met them and you just don't\nknow how to identify what care is so\nsomething about that uh I want to do who\nframe Roger Rabbit\ntoo I feel like oh that would be so good\nand I want to be the detective and\nJessica\nRabbit maybe I'll be Rebecca Rabbit\nJessica's sister who marries Rogers\nbrother I don't know uh but like I want\nto see that cuz that was a really good\nmovie that was based off of some true\nstuff that happened in Los Angeles\nthat's why we have freeways now because\nof that that judge that was in that\nmovie that's a real judge so I would\nlove to like do something with that I\nhave so many ideas\nanation uh I want to open this grocery\nstore I could see it in my mind's eye\nit's like I'm shopping at it every day I\nknow that's going to happen and uh\ncreate some like really awesome human\nbeings I love how there's no limits Crea\nand I think we I think we're now living\nin a time in the world where people can\nbe multi highets and what you just said\nit's I think a lot of the time we've\nbeen like oh you have to be talented you\nhave to be this and what we realized\nit's who can make people feel something\nin any sort of way and we resonate with\nthat we all connect with it and I think\nif anyone who's listening and watching\nand wants to do something thinks I wish\nI started 10 years ago I wish I started\nwhen I was younger oh I didn't get that\nyou know I didn't have parents who were\nsupporting it it's almost like it\ndoesn't matter like it doesn't matter\nthe KFC dude started at 65 70 years old\nhe was\nold and that thing is all over the world\nKFC is all over the world Kentucky Fried\nChicken every single country like it's\nand they had enough competition too like\nMcDonald's and Wendy's competition is\nall over the world now he might not have\nlived long enough to see it be all over\nthe world but hey he started something\nhe's a Visionary and I feel like that's\nthat's what I am at the end of the day\nI'm a Visionary and I'm an administrator\nof Joy that's all I am and some people\nhate that and that's okay that's cuz you\ndon't know how to process joint you\ndon't you got a lot of hurt in your\nheart got a lot of hurt and you need to\nfigure out how to process that and if\nyou want to learn I'm down to show you a\nlittle bit I can't you know I'm still\nprocessing my Hur but if you get this\nbook Cur you with joy I curse you with\njoy might help you some it might help\nyou some and maybe your breath won't\nstin so bad I think people with a lot of\nhate in their heart got bad breath oh\nthat's an interesting hypothesis wow\nthat's that's interesting I'm going to\nstart testing that out yeah just just do\nmy research I mean I mean I don't it's\nfunny like people that talk really\npoorly and negative about other people\nthey breath usually stay that's\nfasinating if you think about it I mean\ndo you ever sit around people that just\ntalk negative all the time I don't\nusually so you don't but like you could\nbe at a party or something and they just\nlike did you not a did this you be\nlike breath is\nhorrible they are dying on the inside or\nyou ever been in a car with somebody and\nthey don't stop talking and the whole\ncar smell like their breath it's just\natrocious been and then every when you\nstart to realize everything they saying\nis negative it's not even anything\npositive it's a lot of hate in their\nheart or they they needed\ndentist cuz that tooth is dead there\nthat that tooth is hating hating the\nrest of their body and they could end up\nhaving a heart attack from that did you\nknow most heart attacks come from bad\nteeth I did not that's not is that true\nno that's not true I think so that's\nwhat I think so cuz y start believing\nall your resets if you start making\nclaims the the dentist Association loves\nme for this but just think about this\njust think about this think about this\nevery person that you know that's had a\nheart attack okay did was the teeth\nnice I have to look into it I have to\nlook into it think about\nit bad teeth bad\nheart Tiffany tell me what little\nTiffany little if l t look at you now\nwhat would you be proud of little T be\nproud that we own so many homes little\nwould be proud that we housing so

could be\nbecause we bheed yeah I went in February\nfor black history Mon and I went to find\nall the black people and I did what was\nthat experience like it was amazing it's\njust like California bro\nit felt like I was in America but they\nspeak Hebrew it's very interesting was\nthis your first time first time first\ntime was that quite a powerful\nexperience in terms of it was very\npowerful because you know every religion\nis there everybody's there everybody's\nthere I know I've been as well yeah I\nwent in 2017 you went in 2017 and when I\nwent to\nJerusalem um maybe because there a war\ngoing on there was barely anybody in\nJerusalem like that so I didn't have to\nwait in no long lines I could do all the\nactivities got the shop freely nobody's\nlike bumping into me nobody's yelling at\nme so it was kind of beautiful cuz I had\nbeen doing my researching seeing like oh\nyou might have to wait in line to go in\nhere you have to wait in line go wait\nfor this I didn't have to wait to go in\nanything I went into all the churches uh\nI I did not get to go into the mosque uh\nprobably because they knew who I was or\nwhatever and that I'm Jewish so I but I\nlooked I was like this I was over here\nlike this what made you want to go right\nnow well I was supposed to go like four\nyears ago okay I was supposed to go\nalready was planning on going already\nhad a ticket like trying to go you know\nit's funny cuz people saying they paid\nyou to go there and I'm like that check\nI would have took a picture of and\nposted okay nobody paid me to be\nanywhere this was me wanting to like I'm\nsuper thirsty for knowledge I read about\nthese places in the Bible in the Torah\nin the Quran I read about like I went to\nthe Church of Scientology they talked\nabout Jerusalem like everybody talks\nabout this place like I need to see this\nand this is like where Jesus was where\nthis person was Abraham all the all the\nmajor players was in that area so let me\ngo see this and I went and it was I got\nto go in that Tunnel right the\nunderground tunnel and that that where\nthe Mikvah is and like learn about the\nthat's where baptism came from from the\nMikvah and all that stuff and people\ngetting cleaned up coming from all the\nother nations to come visit the and\nthat's the that's the trail that Jesus\nwalked every year and then he walked at\nthat one particular year and got\nassassinated at the top of it right and\nbuilt a church around where they had you\nknow killed him and around where they\nsay he was buried and um it's something\nthere I don't know if it's aliens\nunderneath the rock or if the rock is\nfrom Mars and they got some kind of\nenergy it's some kind of energetic like\nreboost reset like on the soul I felt\nlike I was surrounded like feel like I\nwas surrounded by like my ancestors I\ncould feel like hear Whispers I was like\nlooking around to see did they put some\nspeakers in here or something like I was\nhearing like like hey this is what you\nneed to do now this is what you need\nlike like guidance like this is where\nyou go for guidance I prayed at the wall\nput a little few prayers in there prayed\nin the church I was like I'm pray\neverywhere G if God is here if God is\nall throughout this well then gez let me\nget some let me pray everywhere yeah you\nknow that's how I felt about it I feel\nlike I feel like we all praying to the\nsame person we just doing it in\ndifferent ways because we come from\ndifferent cultures because of Babylon a\nb line where where everybody got the\ndifferent languages and stuff sure where\nwhere in the Bible where it say uh where\nuh everybody was speaking one language\nat first and then then Babel Babel when\nthey was building a Tower of Babel in\nBabylon right and then everybody start\nbabbling it was everybody speaking\ndifferent languages and they start\nseparating into different tribes\ndifferent whatever because they didn't\nspeak the same languages anymore right\nis that an I'm not sure of the exact\nplace come on you a monk you supposed to\nknow all these different things\ndifferent tradition different tradition\nokay so what so what did the monks say\nhow did different languages come about\nwe never really talked about that that\nwasn't part of the education so you\ndidn't didn't care about why people\nspeak different languages no I did I\ncare about that but that wasn't part of\nour see but you don't know why people\nspeak different languages let's ask our\nresearcher over there researcher can you\ntell me cuz I'm pretty sure it's I'm\npretty sure it's Babylon bab where where\nwhat was the place where people started\nwhen God made people start speaking\ndifferent languages\nbecause he was like oh they keep talking\nto musim that they doing too much got it\nhe got caus some confusion that's like\nmy number one thing I hate is confusion\nbut my room looks like it's confused but\nI know where everything at but I hate\nconfusion oh the Tower of that the tower\nTower of Babel yeah yeah the Tower of\nBabel there we go okay I know my\nresearch be sure my research I didn't\nwant to say anything I didn't know so so\nI'm I say all that to say I don't know\nif it's aliens under that rock I don't\nknow if the rock is from Mars I don't\nknow if that's actually God is in the\nRock I don't know if God is hanging out\nin the mosque in the temple I don't know\nI don't know but what I do know about\nJerusalem is it is a very powerful place\nthere's definitely something spiritual\ngoing on it Taps into the spirit I don't\nknow if it's like heighten energy where\nall your chakras open up and you can get\nlike messages coming through or whatever\nsomething's going on there and there all\nthe different races and religions are\nthere and all throughout the country\nlike and they're and they're dealing\nwith a lot of the same crap that we're\ndealing with amongst themselves uh I was\ntalking to the black Jews uh that\nthere's a very large African-American\ndiaspora of uh Black Hebrew Jews up in\nDemona and they say Demona is where the\nthe nuclear weapons are but I think the\nnuclear weapons is them black\nAfrican-Americans but the D aspa there\nthey could they off the chain but but I\ncould be wrong I don't know but I was\nhanging out with a lot of them and I was\nlearning a lot and I went to a Masada\nand and that was like absolutely\ngorgeous I went to the uh Dead Sea do\nnot pee when you in the Dead Sea don't\nhave Cuts before you go in don't they\ngoing to heal oh they going to heal bur\nand they say and they say they gonna\nburn well it's gonna heal it's gonna be\ndisinfected they said they say that\nnothing grows in the Dead Sea but I I\nbeg to differ because I seen them
