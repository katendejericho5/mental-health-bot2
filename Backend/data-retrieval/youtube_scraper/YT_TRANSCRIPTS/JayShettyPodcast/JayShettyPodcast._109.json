since we're\nyoung wants to fall in love and we've\nall heard so much advice on love that\nhas somehow become our version of what\nlove is or we've all seen so many love\nstories whether it was a bad love story\nwith our parents whether it was a good\nlove story with our uncles and aunts\nwhether it was our older brother or\nolder sister whoever it was where did\nyour earliest ideas of love come from\nand which ones do you still agree with\nand which ones do you disagree with I\nsuppose on some level some of them must\nhave come from my upbringing you know my\nmom talking about you know the the kind\nof giddiness that she felt for my dad\nwhen they first met and you know the\nattraction um I'm sure so much of it was\nwas songs and\nmovies I\nsuppose the\nthing that I think about now\nis like what I value today is different\nI think than what I might have valued at\n21 I still you know I very much value\nattraction and chemistry because I think\nit's going to be a long road if you're\nin a relationship that doesn't have\nthose things\nbut the things that became kind of\nnon-negotiables for me\nchanged like finding someone who brings\nme peace and being in a relationship\nthat felt peace\npeaceful that was something that made\nits entrance later in my life and I paid\nthe price for it not making its entrance\nsooner you know I was in multiple\nrelationships that really robbed me of\nmy peace and so I think that probably\nearly on I was not I wasn't seeking\npeace I was seeking just the ride you\nknow the experience of feeling these\nincredible feelings for somebody and and\nalso perhaps\nbeing heroic to that person I think that\nwas probably an early idea that you know\nI was the i i there had to be something\nheroic about the way that I showed up or\npresented myself relate to that and I\nthink that for a long time\nthat that prevented me from ever really\nbeing seen you know I if you'd have\nasked me at 25 are you vulnerable I\nwould have been like yeah I wouldn't\nhave said no I wasn't self-aware about\nit but like there was a lot that I never\nreally brought forward about myself I\nthink that we are very good at like you\nknow we all tell the hero's journey of\nour life and we love that right cuz it's\na kind of here's where I was and here's\nwhere I am now you know whenever you\nhear like a rags to Rich's story it's\nback then I was in a bad spot now I'm in\nan amazing spot and I remember I used to\ntell tell stories like that in my life I\ncould be dating and telling stories like\nthat of where I'd come from and where I\nam now and there was nothing really\nvulnerable about those stories there was\nstill the story of like how I'm\nawesome cuz this a hero's journey you\nknow but it's a lot harder to be like\nhere's what I'm struggling with right\nnow or that thing that you just did just\nmade me really jealous and insecure or\nyou know I'm feeling\nemasculated right now like th those\nthings my God like that to bring that\nstuff forward for me was was I didn't\nrealize how hard it was and how\nterrified I must have been of doing that\nand how deeply unworthy I\nfelt to be able to really show someone\nwho I was and still feel like I'd be\nloved afterwards you know I'd get like a\nyou know vulnerability hangover at the\nend of and and by the way sometimes\nsometimes it did backfire I remember you\nknow when I was trying on the whole\nvulnerability thing I remember saying to\nsomeone about a moment in an evening\nthat had made me insecure I remember\ntalking about like I I didn't want to\nbut I could tell I was being passive\naggressive and cold and the walls had\ngone up and so I was like I'm not being\nthat's the hard place to be right when\nyou know you're not being your normal\nfun loving happy self but but you're\nalso not being honest about what you're\nfeeling so you're just in this weird no\nman's land of like being unpleasant to\nbe around and I realize like this I\ncan't hide how I'm feeling right\nnow and instead of like gaslighting this\nperson that I'm fine and I'm not let me\njust share something that made me\ninsecure and it really backfired like\nthis person said to me I find that this\nis the literal words that said to me was\nI find that really\nunattractive and it crushed me because I\nI thought I was like in my head I was\nlike I'm never doing that again I\nremember living with my friend at the\ntime and I walked to his room and I was\nlike I can't believe what just happened\nlike I'm such an and I didn't say I\ndidn't say wow that was really lacking\nin compassion from her side that was\nlike the depths of my own like lack of\ncompassion self-compassion was that\ninstead of saying wow that was a really\num that was kind of a a mean and\nresponse lacking compassion instead I\nwent I I'm such an idiot I'm I can't\nbelieve I said that out loud like why\ndid I reveal that\nweakness and it it took me a little\nwhile to recover from that because it\nkind of it reinforced that's the that\nwas the dangerous part is it reinforced\nthis idea that I needed to be heroic at\nall times m and not to have those\nweaknesses and and that it was those\nparts of me were contempt if people knew\nabout them that's so that was a that was\na big that was a big thing for me I\nthink thinking I had to be a hero all\nthe time and not realizing that a real\nrelationship is so much more interesting\nthan that wow man so powerful so many\nthings to unpack so many things to\nunpack one of the things I want to start\nwith is what is the difference between a\npeaceful relationship and a boring Rel\nrelationship because I think that great\nquestion that's a great question because\nI think a lot of people think of\npeaceful as boring when we're not\nemotionally mature so I can relate to\nwhat you're saying where you actually\nwant a relationship that's kind of like\nchaotic and up and down and passionate\nand then we love each other we hate each\nother you know there's that kind of\nenergy there's something and we kind of\ndo that in a lot of our lives and by the\nway we do that even in marriage and\nrelationships where we can often invent\ndrama because it's too peaceful and I've\nhad friends who've reached out to me and\nsaid Jay I keep creating drama in my\nlife because that's what I'm used to and\nI don't know what to do with this guy or\nthis girl because they're actually\npeaceful so people are scared that\npeaceful means boring but you've just\nsaid you like a peaceful relationship I\nknow you're not a boring guy so what's\nthe difference I you know so when you\nwas just saying that I thought to myself\nI there are days where I'm on time for\nsomething and I will kind of go and do\none more thing before the\nmeeting that makes me\nlate so that I have to like make a game\nof getting in the car and like finding\naway to like how can I still like the\nGPS says I'm going to be there in two\nminutes before but like shaving off a\nminute like I was on time yeah why did I\ndo the one more nothing was going to\nnothing was going to go wrong if I\ndidn't do that one more thing yeah why\ndid I do one more thing that made me\nlate and I had like I had to realize at\na certain point that that was like my\nnervous system I I you know I grew up\naround like my dad was always late for\neverything I learned that from him I\nused to hate it by the way but like I I\nalso then adopted it and I'm not that\nway anymore in my life but like it\nI realize like I have an addiction to\nthis feeling this like mini drama of am\nI going to get there on time which\ncreates this little mini drama in my day\nfor like 10 minutes it's like an\nadrenaline rush I'm like you know and\nit's a horrible feeling really it\ndoesn't feel good it feels like\nstressful and anxiety inducing and now\nI'm going to come across as rude and\ndisrespectful as someone's time and I'm\nlike stressed and but it's like a my\nbody is used to that I'm not used to\nlike getting somewhere on time and like\nhave 10 minutes to just chill and like\nit's that's a new feeling that can feel\nboring M so in terms of a relation I\nthink we do it everywhere in our lives\nin terms of a\nrelationship I knew when I met with my\nwife Audrey that I had found peace that\nwasn't by any means\nboring because I felt at\nhome I didn't you know I didn't just\nfeel safe we can feel safe and very\nbored right we can feel like I'm with\nsomeone who is very non-threatening I\nfeel like I you know this person's not\ngoing to leave me I feel like I'm very\nsafe in this situation but I don't\nreally like this doesn't feel like my\nperson I just feel safe and when you\nhaven't felt safe for a long time\nsometimes there's a very lovely feeling\non its own just to feel like I'm no\nlonger in a abusive relationship or I'm\nno longer in a relationship with someone\nthat makes me second guess myself all\nthe time or feels like they're going to\nleave me at any moment but\neventually we will get bored in a\nsituation where the only thing that's\npresenting as a positive thing is the\nsafety we feel but but in in this\nrelationship I felt at\nhome and I felt like I I felt more seen\nthan I'd ever felt before you know I I\nreally was astonished to the the extent\nto which this person got me\nand that we seem to get each other and\nyou know the first night we met we spoke\nfor 8 hours straight literally like\neveryone else was like partying and\ndoing that and we were just we talked\nfor8 hours the first night we met there\nwas an attraction there that made us\ntalk to each other it's not like we\nstarted talking to each other on the in\nthe first second because we knew we were\nsuch great conversationalists like we\nstarted talking because there was a\nthere was an attraction\nbut but then it felt easy It Felt Like\nHome somehow it took me a minute to\nrealize that by the way I'm not this\nwasn't a love at first sight story of\nlike and then everything was smooth\nsailing but it it did it took me a while\nto realize oh this is like this is this\nfeels like home I'm more of myself\naround this person and I think that's a\nbeautiful thing to find is someone who\nmakes you more of yourself and of course\nI think\nit you know you can't if someone says to\nme I've got zero sexual attraction to\nthis person there's a problem that's a\ngenuine\nproblem you have to have some form of\nattraction to the person you're with now\nby the way does it need to be the\ngreatest attraction you've ever felt for\nanyone in your life that trips a lot of\npeople up because I I always say don't\ncomparison shop for chemistry it's one\nof the things I talk about in the book\nbecause I think\nwe we're always comparing in whatever is\nin front of us with the peak of our\nchemistry that we've had with someone\nthat we can't seem to get over but you\nonly have to take a look at what are the\nsituations that we find hard to get\nover like where what was that peak of\nchemistry and attraction and it's often\nin situations that were entirely\nunsustainable it's you know you go you\nhave a holiday romance with someone and\nyou oh God like if I I'd love to feel\nthat animal attraction for someone who\nwas good for me and I had a long-term\nrelationship with and it's like well how\nlong did you know that person 2 weeks\nthey didn't have to do very much like\nit's easy to create the conditions for\nchemistry in that kind of a situation\nthe same is true of people who have a a\nthree Monon fling with someone where\nthere's like it it becomes more\ninteresting because it's flaming really\nhot and then it disappears you know I\nhad a woman who I coached who said you\nknow this person was the one we had this\namazing 3mon thing and I said what\nhappened and she was like well he went\ntraveling and he said he didn't want to\ncontinue the\nrelationship and for me that's like\nliteral fireworks you know they\nfireworks we look at them and they're\nreally exciting and we get we're like\nisn't this magical and you look at those\nfireworks but if those fireworks carried\non for 3 hours You' be like this is I\nwant to go home now You' be bored yes\nright for fireworks to to be exciting\nthey have to end they have to end so we\nhave to be very careful about comparing\nthe like Slow Burn energy of a real\nrelationship with like that fast twitch\nmuscle of a short-term encounter or an\naffair that is naturally exciting\nbecause it's an affair it's like you\nknow mysterious yeah so I I I don't\nthink you you should absolutely have\nchemistry but um we have to be really\ncareful with comparing chemistry with\nprevious chemistry because that\nchemistry may not have lasted either if\nYou' actually got what you wanted yeah\nand it's it makes so much sense the idea\nyou just the analogy you painted of the\nfireworks is a brilliant one\nbecause a real relationship is one that\nyou don't want to end and the chemistry\nbased relationship is one that has to\nend right it has to come to an end and\nfor it to feel meaningful and a real\nrelationship you never want to end and\nthat's why it feels meaningful and there\nthat's where we're kind of stuck in\nbetween and the thing I hear the most\nand I asked my audience and my team a\nlot of questions before this interview\nbecause I know a lot of my audiences\ndating trying to figure it out and one\nof the biggest things which we touched\non here but I want to ask you about is\nthat people find it overwhelming with\nthe number of options they have today\nand I've spoken to friends who are like\nwell this guy's great but maybe there's\nsomeone greater right and we're\nconstantly living in this they're good\nbut maybe they're 50% and maybe there's\na 51 and then maybe there's a 79 and\nmaybe there's a 99 cuz I can see someone\nelse over there has a 99 and so we keep\nsecond guessing even the person in front\nof us even if they are fulfilling our\nneeds because of the\noverwhelming number of options so how\nwhen you said you felt at home and you\nknow I think that's what people want to\nfeel they want to feel at home they want\nto feel more than safe but how do we\nknow or what have been the best signs\nand indicators that people can look out\nfor that they're actually making things\nharder for themselves by wishing hoping\nwanting someone else or is that a sign\nthat you're not with the right person\nthat you feel that there is someone who\nhas more it's such a tough question cuz\nI think\nit's sometimes we're wanting something\nelse because there's you know the person\nthat's in front of us isn't n compelling\nenough there really is something lacking\nin that\nrelationship but I do think we have to\nask ourselves what what are the things I\nreally must have for an amazing\nrelationship like I for me when I when I\nwas going to ask Audrey to marry me I\nliterally called up a friend and told\nhim and he was like you know why are you\ndoing that I'm just curious like what he\nwas it was almost like his way of\ntesting whether I was ready or not you\nknow whether I was just in some crazy\nlike infatuation or and I said you know\nI'm I'm ready to build something in my\nlife I feel\nlike for me my my dating life was just\nlike hitting reset all the time and and\nit was honestly at a certain point\nmaking me anxious like dating and being\nwith different people and it just didn't\nyou know there was a time in my life\nwhere that was really exciting and then\nit started to just go the other way and\nI and I had to listen to that and go\nthis\nisn't this isn't going to work like I\nthis isn't where it's at this isn't\nmaking me happy this isn't bringing me\npeace um the way that I was dating was\nit had almost like an addictive quality\nto it that was really unhealthy and I\nthought this isn't going to be a good\nlook 10 years from now it's not going to\nmake me feel good it's not going to\nbring me more peace which is a different\nby the way that doesn't mean that you\nknow how to give something up when you\nhave those realizations you might\nrealize eating healthier would be better\nfor you but it doesn't mean that you've\ntrained yourself to be able to do\nthat um but I got to a point where I\nsaid I want to build something\nnow and in with Audrey I thought I I in\nmy head I was like I'll never find a\nbetter Builder and I said that to him\nlike I'll never find a better Builder\nthis is this is the Builder for me like\nwe're going to be able to do such\namazing things together and the life\nwe'll have and the you know the her\nlevel of empathy and compassion and you\nknow the person that I am with this\nperson it you know the way she makes me\nfeel like that's that's truly special\nand I'm not a you know there's the one\nout there kind of a person I've never\nbeen that way if you look anyone looks\nback through my videos and you know this\ncuz we've spoken about it back when I\nwas single you know I've never been a\nperson who believes in the idea of the\none so I think that it's finding someone\nthat we've you know we look at what's\nreally important to us not what's\nimportant on an egoic level cuz I think\na lot of the things that make us\nquestion whether this person is right\nfor us are ego based I don't think\nthey're based on how we feel around this\nperson we worry is this the kind of\nperson my friends think that I should be\nwith do they look the part are they my T\nmy normal type do they make the right\namount of money yeah like is this does\nhas this person come in the package that\nI had always told myself they would come\nin and those things can be really really\nlimiting and they can have us like\nconstantly trying to optimize for some\nversion of something that we think we're\nsupposed to be with which is a very\ndangerous way to go about finding love\nyou you can't optimize for human beings\nyou you you can optimize for a lot in\nlife but you're dealing with people by\nthe way even if you let go of this\nperson you're going to find someone else\nwho's also imperfect and they might okay\nthis person is you know scores a seven\nin this area and they score a nine but\nguess what they score a three in this\nother area that you didn't even know was\ngreat in this relationship because you\ntook for granted how amazing that person\nwas in that way like it it it's it's\nvery dangerous to optimize in that way\nin our love life and I I've come to\nreally believe in life that if you find\na connection that has all the right raw\nmaterials and you both have the same\nlevel of commitment then you can build\nsomething extraordinary together and\nactually the extraordinary is the thing\nyou sculpt together it's no different\nfrom a career you know neither you nor I\nstarted by doing our Dream version of\nthis it's evolved and evolved and\nevolved and evolved and every year you\nsculpt it a little closer to your ideal\nway of doing it all and along the way\nyou do a lot of things that you don't\nnecessarily you're like oh my God I\ncouldn't do this for a lifetime and this\npart I thought I would enjoy and I\ndidn't enjoy it nearly as much as I\nthought I would I'm going to stop doing\nthat and you you you know you you sculpt\nit like dream careers are sculpted\nthey're not not found and I think that\nthat's true of relationships as well\nlike I'm more grateful for my\nrelationship with Audrey the more time\ngoes on yes because we keep sculpting it\ninto something that's better and better\nwhat that requires which is really hard\nfor a lot of us myself included for many\nyears and this was one of the things\nthat I think really hurt me was I got\nmyself into an incredibly indecisive\nstate where I was constantly second\nguessing\nmyself and I you know when we talk when\nwe when we think of what's our like what\nare we worried about in our love life\nfor so many of us is that we're going to\nsettle yes I'm going to settle for the\nwrong person well I think we can\nactually start to reclaim the language\nof settling MH and make it into a very\npositive thing that what if it wasn't\nsettling for what if you decided to\nsettle on M because when you settle on\nsomeone there's a power to that it's\nlike you resolve to say I'm going to\nsettle on this it's like people crossing\na country when a country is you know\nit's like people crossing America and\ndeciding when to\nstop where at what point did the early\nsettlers say this this is good enough I\ndon't need to keep going like I've found\nan amazing place and when you find that\nplace you go I could live here then you\nsettle on it and it's only by settling\non it that you can make it great it's\nonly by putting your attention on it\nlike a laser that you can see what it\nbecomes and I don't think that I ever\nreally settled on anything in my love\nlife in a way that gave it a chance to\nsee what it could really become and in\nthis situation I really gave myself that\nchance by saying I'm going to I'm going\nto go all in on this yeah but or she was\nsmart because she also saw that Audrey\nis ridiculously perceptive and in tune\nwith people and she saw in me early on\nlike oh this is a pattern for him and\nthat doubt and that what do I want you\nknow is this right and she saw that\nearly on and one of the\nthings that she did was\nshe she called me out firstly and she\nwas like look if if you're\nI'm willing to like really see what this\ncould be and you don't seem to be wow in\nthat place where you're like\nactually going all in and seeing what it\ncould be mhm she said so I don't want to\ncontinue if you're not going all in\nbecause I I'm not like I'm not here for\nsomeone half of someone's energy and she\nand the way she phrased it was amazing\nbecause she said to me look\nthat doesn't mean like six months from\nnow we could break up yeah you might\ndecide this is wrong for you I might\ndecide it's wrong for meh and no one's\nthe villain if that happens but if\nyou're not willing to go all in right\nnow to at least see what it could be MH\nand give it your real effort then then\nthis has to end here for me and what was\nfor me what was amazing about that is\nthat it lowered the stakes for me\nespecially when she said because I I\nfelt like you know in the past I had\nhurt well I didn't feel like I had hurt\npeople and I had been the villain and I\nwas like I can't do this anymore cuz I\nalso suffer from ridiculous guilt so I\nwas like I can't do this again I can't I\nwas like avoidant because I was like I\ndon't want to get close enough to anyone\nto hurt someone if I hurt someone I'm\ngoing to feel sick and that's going to\nhaunt me and then you know I'm just\nmaking myself miserable and them and so\nI had all this like stuff and when she\nwas like you're not if 6 months from now\nyou decide this isn't for you that's\nokay you're allowed to do that that\nlowered the stakes for me but by also\ndemanding as a standard and that's what\nso much of this book is about how to\nraise your standards and what that looks\nlike in practice because I think the\nreason so many people never reach the\npoint of real real relationship is\nbecause they don't have standards for\nwhat they expect and how to communicate\nand know how to communicate those\nstandards but because she had a standard\nthat she lowered the stakes but she also\nhad a high standard that said this is\nthe price of entry for\ncontinuing that like allowed me to fully\ninvest and when I fully\ninvested that thing started to actually\nrealize its potential and to we got to\nsee what it actually was when I was\nshowing up fully and she was showing up\nfully um so I I sympathize with anyone\nwho is struggling with those decisions\nin their love life I don't judge anyone\nfor it because I struggled in my love\nlife with there I wrote a whole chapter\nof the book called Never Satisfied cuz I\nrelated to that idea that you know you\nfind someone who you chase who feels\nexciting to you but they break your\nheart you know or you go for someone who\nfeels safe and you're bored you're\ndoubting yourself you're doubting\nwhether this is the right person and you\njust sort of you know cycle between\nthose two different extremes and it\nbecame the not just a goal for me to\nhelp other people it became a goal for\nmyself to go I need to figure out how to\nbe happy here because otherwise I'm\ngoing to constantly oscillate between\nfeeling suffering because I'm chasing\nsomeone who doesn't want me or being\nwith someone where I feel like I'm not\nI'm not fully there and that's not fair\nto them and it's not fair to myself like\nI need to figure out a way to be happy\nhere so so much of this book is about\nfinding that peace and that happiness\nthat um I feel really really lucky to\nhave been able to find in my own life\nbecause it's it you know I wrote this\nbook single\nheartbroken then dating then you know\nfalling in love and then I the last edit\nI did you know for 2 days on my\nhoneymoon like that was a crazy Arc for\nme so it wasn't something that was\ncreated by married person who was just\nlike here's all the answers I was like\nsome of these chapters I wrote in the\nworst possible pain of of my life you\nknow you talked about standards there\nand obviously that's such a big part of\nwhat you felt with Audrey in that moment\nI think what scares us about setting\nstandards is that we think it's going to\nscare someone away so Audrey saying that\nto you requires so much self worth in\nher saying I may lose this guy if I say\nthis\nbut I know that's where I'm at you being\nvulnerable with that person many years\nago saying I'm going to open up about my\nlife and them saying that's not very\nattractive I don't find that attractive\nthat was you again trying to demonstrate\nand be vulnerable but because you were\nwith someone who wasn't emotionally\ncompassionate enough to Reed that and\nbecause you didn't have enough selfworth\nyou made it a weakness in yourself it\nsounds like when Audrey said that to you\nif you would have said well I'm not in\nshe would have been like okay cool we're\nnot in then it's not happening it\ndoesn't sound like she would have been\nlike oh my God he doesn't like me I'm\nnot good enough because she had a\ncertain standard and that's what\nstandards whereas when you were trying\nto be vulnerable it was like trying to\nbe vulnerable but it wasn't a standard\nyet well I would no it wasn't a standard\ntactics are different from standards\nthat's what I not when I was being\nvulnerable that was a tactic but but\nlike we do constantly employ faux\nstandards that aren't really standards\nthey're just a tactic so it's like I'm\nnot going to text this person back so\nthat I generate interest and then if it\ndoesn't generate interest 3 days later\nwe text them anyway that's because it\nwasn't a standard it was a tactic well\nyeah when something a tactic we do to\ntry and get a result and if it doesn't\nwork we go for a different tactic a\nstandard is who we are so well said and\nwe don't change it like if my standard\nof being open and vulnerable was what I\ndid in that moment with that person I\nwouldn't have stopped doing that just\nbecause I didn't get the result that I\nwanted yes which was connection I would\nhave said well this is how I want to be\nand come to think of\nit one of I would have said if I was in\na better\nplace one of my greatest standards is to\nfind someone who really accepts me and\nif this person doesn't accept me then my\nstandard is going to be that well maybe\nthis relationship isn't for me you know\nI want to be this vulnerable in a\nrelationship I want to be able to share\nfrom the heart both the good and the and\nthe bad and my flaws and my insecurities\nand if I'm not accepted then okay maybe\nmaybe it's not right but instead what I\ndid was I went down a very masochistic\nRabbit Hole of going I'm not good enough\nit's just been proven I'm never going to\nreveal those weaknesses again\nand I stayed MH right so you're right\nabout Audrey because I guarantee you if\nI had not then said all right I'm going\nto show up differently she would have\nbeen out of there and the big difference\nis we have to make the the goal our\nhappiness not a person you know we think\nthat we're going to be happy by getting\na person but you'll never be happy by\ngetting a person that doesn't meet your\nneeds doesn't matter how impressive you\nthink they are it doesn't that's the\nthat's the danger right that's the Trap\npeople fall into I've fallen into it\nsomeone's particularly exciting\nimpressive charismatic gorgeous there's\nsomething there's they have all these\nthings that you go this makes them a\nvery valuable person and then you say\nwell my needs don't really matter\nanymore the only thing that matters is I\ncan get this person because we think if\nI can get this person then I'll be\nworthy and I'll be happy and it will all\nwork out but everyone out there I you\nknow most people out there have been in\na relationship where they thought it\nwould be heaven to get someone and then\nthey experienced what the relationship\nwas actually like when their needs\nweren't being met when they didn't feel\nsafe when they didn't feel acknowledged\nwhen they didn't receive someone's\nempathy when they felt like they\ncouldn't really be themselves around\nthat person when they felt like they\nwere constantly Clinging On to the\nrelationship because they never you know\nthey were in a relationship with the\nperson but they never really felt like\nthey had them you know there there's a\nspecial kind of Hell to be in a\nrelationship like that and at a certain\npoint we have to come to realize that\nthis is this is this relationship I keep\ntelling myself I'm going to die if I\nlose it is\nworthless if I don't get these couple of\nthings that are missing yeah and so for\nme one of the greatest ways to have a\nstandard next time round is not you\nthere's a whole you know I wrote two\nmassive chapters in this book on how to\nbe confident but you don't even need\nconfidence for standards in the\nbeginning yes you just need to know that\nI can never experience that again\nbecause it's too painful it's like you\ndon't need to if I put your hand in a\nflame you don't need a standard or\nconfidence to get out of it yeah you\njust you don't need selfworth to get\nyour hand out of the flame it's just too\npainful I can't do that again and a lot\nof people especially people who leave\nreally abusive or difficult\nrelationships a lot of them when they\nhave enough time away from it and they\nstart to their nervous system calms down\nand they start to experience a different\nreality yeah they look back and and\nthey're like I no matter how much I\nstill may dream about that person or\nfantasize about that person or you know\nget sentimental about that relationship\nwhen they really think about what it was\nlike to be in it and what that person\nwas like they're like I could never go\nback to being in that kind of a\nsituation yes so the necessity is is the\nbirthplace of Standards before you ever\nincrease your self-worth yeah and I love\nthat because I think we get so locked\ninto like self-worth self-confidence\nself-esteem and because that's a\nlifelong journey and a lifelong Pursuit\nyou feel you can't have standards but I\nwant to go back to something you said\nbecause I think this is we're really I'm\nreally enjoying this conversation\nbecause I feel like we're really getting\ninto to this kind of subtle Nuance space\nof what's really holding people back\nfrom having love in their life and it's\nsomething you said earlier which I'm\nkind of connecting to what you're saying\nnow this difference between an egoic\nstandard in your words and then an\nemotive standard or an emotional\nstandard and maybe there's a better word\nfor it that that you've developed or\ncome across but I'm trying to separate\nit because I think an egoic standard is\nwell yeah that if they ask me out they\nhave to pay on the first date so we\nstart getting lost or like an egoic\nstandard is they should message me first\nlike I don't think those are the types\nof standards that Audrey said to you or\nthe kind of standard that you're\nrecommending there's this great my\nfavorite Tik Tok page to follow in the\nworld is called guy with the list have\nyou seen this guy so what he does is\nhe'll take random videos of girls who\nshare their I and they are hilarious\nright they are the most ridiculous\nthings like it's like I don't like guys\nwho work out with their mates all the\nway through to I don't like guys with uh\na big bum right whatever it may be and\nthis guy what he'll do is he'll take the\nclip of a girl saying that and then\nhe'll go to his notes page in apple and\nadd it to his list of things are not to\nbe it's the best page in the world so\nit's just the longest he's on 794 the\nlast time I saw and it's like a guy with\nthe list it's brilliant\nand and the reason I bring it up is\nbecause I think that's what we think\nstandards are now and I think to your\npoint earlier I think you labeled it an\negoic standard so walk us through how we\ntransform our egoic standards into I'm\ncalling them emotional standards\nwhatever the right word is how do we\ntransfer them over because I think we\nthink we're setting standards but there\nstandards like he's got to pay on the\nfirst date she better text me first I\nwon't reply for a week the example you\ngave and I think that's what's tripping\nus up yeah I think that it's almost like\nthere's standards that arise from ego\nand there's standards arise from what's\ngoing to make us happy and that the two\nare often completely different right\nbecause actually the the things that\nmake us happy can be much more subtle\nand less prescriptive than the things\nthat feed our ego in some way there's\nthere's two points I want to about this\nthe first one is in relation\nto the kind of inherent judgment that is\nin so many of those icks and so many of\nthose things I would never want someone\nwho's like this I would never want\nsomeone who does that I\nwould the we write people off at\nlightning\nspeed and not just entirely superficial\nthings but ways that people are not like\nus right so you've got\npeople who are like oh if they're not\ninto especially like you know your\naudience is into self-development my\naudience tends to be into\nself-development it's very easy for\nsomeone who gets into self-development\nto suddenly be like I want somebody else\nwho's into self-development yeah right\nand I get that question all the time\nlike now that I'm doing all of this\nGrowth work I want someone who can keep\nup I want someone who's On My Level and\nI want to remind people like you weren't\ndoing this two years\nago like this is you know way this is\nlike a complete contempt you have for\nyou two years\nago wow before like a certain Mentor or\ninfluence or something came into your\nlife and turned you onto something\nthere's also a slight arrogance about\nthe standards you know these things we\nhave because it's you know someone could\nhave lived on a farm their whole life\nand they have no idea what\nself-development even is as a kind of\nidea a concept let alone that there's\nthis entire industry around it and they\nmay have a wisdom that you never picked\nup on in the world that you grew up in\nand that might be one of the greatest\nbits of synergy between the two of you\nis the wisdom you bring and the wisdom\nthey bring that's different and has come\nfrom a very different place a very\ndifferent way of living so you know I I\nthink there's a lack of humility\nsometimes in thinking that people have\nto be like us mhm and then judging them\nfor the ways that they're not like us\nand a lot of the way we judge other\npeople arises out of a lack of\nself-compassion because we haven't\nreally accepted ourselves we haven't\nreally you know I know every time I got\npunched in the face by life every time\nlike I took a big\nhit and I you know experienced a really\nbad heartbreak that was a big one for me\nlike a very humbling experience for me I\nexperienced years of chronic physical\npain and when that happened in my life I\nlike\ntruly just hit a kind of bottom because\nI just didn't know how I would ever I I\ntried everything in the world and I\ncouldn't make this pain go away and I it\nit started to basically not just ruin my\nlife because I felt like I couldn't\nexperience Joy anymore I was just\nthinking about my pain all day every day\nbut it also robbed me of my confidence\nbecause I started to feel like wow no\none's going to be attracted to this\nversion of me that is so frail and\nfragile and doesn't feel like I was I\nreally didn't identify as the heroic\nversion of me anymore I was like this is\ngoing to I'm going to be perceived as\npathetic MH by someone who wants like a\nstrong person because I feel so on the\nedge of breaking the whole time cuz\nanyone with chronic physical pain knows\nthat you it's so centralizing and even\ndoing basic things can feel like it's\ntoo much um but my point is that that\ngoing through those things in\nlife it allowed me to access a level of\ncompassion for other people because I\nwas like God how many people have I\nwritten off in my life because you know\nthey're they're this way or they're that\nway or they're you know and look at me\nright now I'm I'm like on the floor yeah\nand I I found that as I came to accept\nmore of myself and be honest about my\nown stuff and not just the things going\nwrong in my life but even just\ndifficulties like if you have a jealous\nmoment and it makes you a little\ncrazy then you're not so quick to call\nother people crazy when they you know\nreact to a insecurity they have and it\nmakes them do something extreme in that\nmoment you know like the well you she's\ncrazy you can't believe what she did\nlike she's so she's crazy it's like you\ndon't you don't throw that around when\nyou know you've done your share of like\ncrazy because you were in pain and you\ndidn't know how to how to cope with it\nyeah you know it so I've I've found that\nthe\nmore The more I've like been humbled in\nlife and The more I've become accepting\nof\nmyself and compassionate towards myself\nactually the more yeah absolutely it's\nmade space for everyone else because now\nI wouldn't if I was single again I\nwouldn't be writing off people on all of\nthose things that I might have written\npeople off four8 years ago or 10 years\nago I actually think I would have more\noptions not less like people say I'm\ngrowing so so much I've got so few\noptions now cuz so many few people are\non my level I'm like if you're really\ngrowing I actually think it makes space\nfor more people because you become more\ncompassionate and more accepting um and\nyou see the soul of that person\nunderneath those behaviors and the way\nthey are which kind of brings me on to\nmy my other point which was when you\nknow the person says they didn't pay on\nthe date they invited me and then you\nknow they didn't pay for the whole check\nor\nwhatever I I think\nwe're we're not always good at getting\nbehind why someone is the way they are\nlike what's really driving the way they\nare does this person have the same\nvalues as me they might do something\ndifferent on the\nsurface but underneath that might be the\nsame value MH we just have arrived at\ndifferent points like my wife's a a\nvegetarian I eat meat like we both love\nanimals\nsincerely I love animals she makes jokes\nabout me you know how much you know how\nI am with animals is one of her favorite\nthings in the world but I eat them and\nshe doesn't like we have we've arrived\nat different places but Underneath It\nAll is like the same beating heart and I\nthink that's the thing we're quick to\nwrite off when we make those really\nquick judgments about people and that's\nnot to say like there are certain you\nknow red flags that might come up with\nsomeone where you go you know what not\nworth finding out what's behind this\nbecause it's just too severe and I don't\nI really don't like this and it has been\na major warning sign for me in the past\nbut I think that's that's different yeah\nthan taking something like you know\nsomeone someone didn't pay half the bill\nor someone didn't pay the whole bill and\nlike I I know that I used to think to\nmyself I really enjoy paying the bill\nmhm but if someone didn't offer yeah I\nfor me I would be\nlike it and this is even my judgment\nright because that for them it might\njust be conditioning and it might be I\neven there were times where I even spoke\nup about it where I found myself paying\nconstantly and I got brave enough to say\nhey it makes me feel kind of taken for\ngranted that you don't ever offer to pay\nyou know I've been in situations like\nthat in the past and sometimes if you\nsaid that to someone they'd be like oh\nmy God I feel like they're so\nembarrassed and they're like they will\nthen feel shame about it and be like God\nI you know they look at themselves and\nthey're like oh I slipped into a pattern\nthere that I don't like especially if I\nexpress that it's not that I hate it's\nnot that I don't like paying it's that I\ndon't feel like we're a team yes you\nknow that might make someone go well I\nvalue being part of a team as well and I\nactually don't like that you don't feel\nlike I'm a great teammate that's the\nlast thing in the world I'd ever want to\nbe so now like you can actually come\ntogether because of a a moment where you\nsay something like that but I know if I\nwas on a date when I was single and\nsomeone didn't even offer and by the way\nI would still pay I still wouldn't let\nthem but if someone didn't offer it it\nwould be there would be a little piece\nof me that would be\nlike it doesn't that doesn't feel like\nteamwork yeah and maybe you know maybe\nfine if someone invites you on a date\nand and they let you pay half okay maybe\nyou say I don't I didn't love that but\nmaybe you see like maybe that needs to\nplay out once or twice more before you\ndecide everything that means about the\nperson yeah well I I think you just hit\nthe nail on the head it's like actually\nhaving and I know this isn't sexy and\nit's not popular but it is what you're\ntrying to say that having the clarifying\nconversation around why someone behaves\nthe way they do is far more useful as to\nwhether this relationship has a future\nthan what they do so the fact that\nyou're paying or someone's not paying\nactually doesn't show anything unless\nyou had a conversation about why that's\nthe case and actually how they deal with\nthat conversation and how they respond\nto it is going to give you all the notes\nyou need as to whether this relationship\nhas a future or not because what ends up\nhappening that's with a very tangible\nthing with paying there could be\nsomething that person does that annoys\nyou and you let it go for the first\nmonth you let it go for the first three\nmonths now you move in and it triggers\nyou and you're like God can you just\nstop doing that you've been doing it for\n9 months now and they're like well wait\na minute why didn't you just tell me\nthat and it's like well if we actually\ntalked about it on month one I know rad\nand I have had so many conversations\nlike that and it is true that as you\nspend more time together a you discover\nmore things you disagree on and B you\ndiscover more things you're grateful for\nthey're both happening at the same time\nand the disagreement doesn't turn into a\ndisconnect because you have the skills\nto say I know how this person deals with\nchallenging conversations\nbecause we've had them for so long we're\nnot waiting for 3 years to hit to have\nour first challenging conversation\nbecause we've already had them about\nless important things and now that we're\ngrowing up together like you know I\nthink a lot of people aren't having the\nearly conversation so when it comes to\nthat how do we want to raise kids where\ndo we want to live what do you want to\nall these are harder conversations if\nyou haven't talked about who should pay\nfor the bill because these are much more\nbigger\nemotional condition decisions where\npeople have far more stuff to pull from\nas to how they make it so so much to say\nabout all of that yeah I you you're\nabsolutely right and Christopher\nHitchins used to say it's more important\nhow someone thinks than what they think\nand I think that we never when we're\nbeing too judgmental or assumptive we\ndon't necessarily learn how someone\nthinks we learn what they think and then\nwe discard them based on what they think\nor what they do you're absolutely right\nthat by having the conversation you see\nhow they deal with the conversation\nitself which should by the way for\nanyone wanting a serious relationship it\nshould that should be like one of your\nBaseline needs is that I need someone\nwho is willing to have real\nconversations with me where we can\nacknowledge things cuz someone who can't\nacknowledge things can't grow right it's\nlike one of the key features of of\nnarcissism is the inability to admit\nwrongdoing and that breeds incompetence\nby the way because if you can't admit\nwrong doing and take ownership you can't\nget better MH at something so you know\nwhether you're dealing with narcissism\nor just someone who can't see themselves\nclearly or can't acknowledge the way you\nfeel or the way something they've done\nhas made you\nfeel if you're in that situation it's\ngoing to it's going to be a rough\nrelationship so how soon do you want to\nfind out the way the two of you engage\non that level but it's also engaging on\nthat level is a form this is I think\nwhat we've what we forget is that well\nlet me make two points about this the I\nwrote an entire chapter in this book on\nhard conversations not just because we\ntend to avoid them at all costs because\nwe don't like them like it's like you\nknow in Fight Club where you know he\nsays like most men will do anything to\navoid a fight like it's like most people\nwill do anything to avoid a hard\nconversation cuz we just hate it's\nawkward it's embarrassing you know we\nprobably many of us grew up not being\ngood at confrontation or not being\ntaught how to have healthy confrontation\nand so we we avoid it and we hold on to\nit we hold on to it and we're afraid\nwhat will happen if we speak up about\nour needs I know that one thing I I did\na disservice to to people that I had in\nmy love life uh in previous times of my\nlife because the times where I might\nhave really needed some time to\nmyself I didn't express it and then by\nnot expressing it because I was afraid I\nthen became\nlike resentful and avoidant and started\nto push that person away because I had\njust decided my needs couldn't be met in\nthis relationship without giving them a\nchance to even see that part of me and\nshow up for me in that way so we do that\nall the way to the beginning of dating\nyou know we do that when we see you know\nthat I I joke in the book about red\nflags because I'm like if we listen to\nevery single piece of advice on the\ninternet about what's a red flag Not\nonly would everyone be undatable so\nwould we right like I'd be excluded from\nthe dating pool because I for sure have\nsome of those red flags or have had at\nsome point in my life so you know we and\nthat's I don't want to be hypocritical\nI've been a contributor to the advice on\nred flags but like when you start adding\nthem all up you're like oh my God is\nthere any room for mistakes is there any\nroom for someone to do something that\nyou know uh uh uh isn't them on their\nbest day now\nRobert Green I heard him\nsay you know if someone does something\npay attention to that because nobody\never does anything once if they did it\nonce it's a\npattern I think that's an amazing like\nif I was creating a survival guide for\nlife that would go in it because it's\ngreat advice but I also know that\nthere's things I've done in my life or\nmy relationship that I did once\nespecially after a hard conversation I\nfelt bad about and and decided I I don't\nwant to be that person or I don't want\nto do that again so we do want to\nreserve some space in life for the fact\nthat we can learn we can adapt we can\nprogress what I know for sure is that\npeople don't progress without the hard\nconversations what we ignore we tacitly\napprove and what we point out bravely\nalbeit there are elegant ways to do it\nand I show People Elegant ways to do it\nin the book yeah that to me is then you\nyou're looking for Progress like guess\nwhen I've mentioned it is does it bring\nus closer together CU in the right\nsituation communicating should actually\nbring you closer together it shouldn't\nthen you shouldn't feel gaslit you\nshouldn't feel like you're called crazy\nor difficult or that should actually\nbring you together and then our standard\nhas to be that by having that\nconversation I need to see progress in\nthat area and if I don't see progress in\nthat area I'm not going to ignore the\nfact that there's been no progress in\nthat area but if there's no\nprogress now it has become a kind of a\ndelusional thing to expect that they are\ngoing to change but I can't stress this\nenough we in our love lives today\neveryone is really really good at and\nrightly so I'm not this is what they're\ntalking about is real but we're really\ngood at complaining about what dating is\nlike\ntoday and how hard it is and it is like\nit it is hard finding love is hard it is\nthe wild west it there is so much bad\nbehavior there's so many ways to just\nGod there's just so many ways for it to\nbe bad and unfortunately for us our love\nlife is an area we can influence but we\nwe can't control it to the level of\nprecision that we can other areas of Our\nLives if we want to lose weight we can\neat better and we can work out and our\nbody will change may not get to our\nperfect weight but it will change\nreliably in your love life you can go on\na date every day for the next year and\nstill not find love or you can find love\nand six months later that person cheats\non you and leaves you and you're back to\nsquare one it's a maddening area in many\nways because we deeply want to find love\nit is one of the most human of desires\nis to find love and it panics us mhm\nat first it frustrates us and it makes\nus angry and but at some point for many\npeople it panics them because they're\nworried I'm never going to meet anyone\nwe can't just decide I'm going to find\nlove in the next 3 months and make it\nhappen but what we have to start taking\nownership of and where we have to start\ntaking our power back is that you can go\ninto your dating life from a place of\nleadership and so many people I think go\nin with a state of following like what's\nthe level right now of people's effort\nwhat's the level of men's chivalry\nwhat's the level of whether people pick\nup the phone or not instead of\nrelentlessly texting what's the level of\ncommunication between dates or the um\nwhat I can expect from someone in terms\nof assurances that we're just seeing\neach other like there's all this\nrhetoric about things are and people\ndon't try anymore and no one wants to\ncommit and so on but if you're not\ncareful you can get into a really\npassive State about all of that Mitch\nalbum said if you don't like the culture\nyou have to be brave enough to create\nyour own I love that and by the way\nthat's what we do in business right\nthat's what you've done in your business\nis that you've created a culture that\nyou love that is right for you and\nthat's what you you know in the most\npositive way infect your team with is\nthat beautiful culture and that amazing\nway that you see the world and the way\nthat you do things and it makes your\norganization unlike any other in the\nworld it's got your thumb print on it\nthat's the beauty in a way of starting a\nbusiness is that you get to do it your\nway and our love life can be the same we\ncan decide What's the culture that I\nwant to have instead of commenting on\nculture What's the culture I want to\ncreate in my love life if someone you\nknow if I'm sick of this whole constant\ntexting thing well why don't I be the\none to leave someone a voice note today\nlike why if someone's just sent me the\n50th text why don't I send them back\nwhen they ask me how am I doing today\nwhy don't I like just say maybe it's too\nscary to call them but maybe I just\nleave a voice note and say hey how you\ndoing I thought I'd uh you know I\nthought I'd leave you a voice note I'm\nout with my sister right now we're in\nIkea we're trying to find furniture for\nthis thing I'll send you a picture\nbecause I am dread and getting home and\nhaving to actually make this tell me\nabout your day like how you doing blah\nblah blah like you know you can inject a\ndifferent level of energy and and\nenthusiasm or sexiness or\nflirtatiousness or whatever it may be a\nlittle laugh here that's endearing you\ncan do all of that in a voice note in a\nway that when someone listens to it now\nit's not just another text on their\nphone you're like attacking a different\nsense yeah and that will increase the\nlevel of intimacy even just by 1% %\n2% and that might just make you like\nthat's leadership cuz you're not just we\nwe spend so much time mirroring people\nlike I'm going to mirror how someone\nelse is what someone else is giving me\nin this this person I'm seeing but we\nhave to start modeling more like it it\ndon't get me wrong if you Model Behavior\nthat you want to see by being the one\nwho picks up the phone first or leaves\nthe voice note and then they they don't\nmeet you there then you can say okay I'm\ngoing to start to mirror their lack of\ninvestment I'm going to start to back\noff but you can't just be in a state of\nmirroring all the time like such a good\npoint it works on every level man I was\nI was at my coffee shop this morning and\nthere's a guy there that really like we\nalways have like a really nice like\nthree minute\nconversation and this morning like it\nnever goes further than that but this\nmorning as he was going to the coffee\nbar he said can I get you a\ncoffee now like I remember in that\nmoment I thought that was like a little\nmoment of like vulnerability and\nLeadership that was like had the\npotential to upgrade the relationship\nyou know what I mean like this is just\nanother guy in a coffee shop but it was\nlike oh we might hear you offered me a\ncoffee I say yes and now like our\nrelationship is one where you got me a\ncoffee and now we might sit for 10\nminutes on that's how things move but\nthey can't move if you're in this like\nfearful protectionist I don't want to\nget hurt I don't want to give more than\nthe other person I don't want to that's\nnot a good standard to have a great\nstandard to have is lead and model the\nkind of culture you want to see and if\nsomeone doesn't meet you there that's\nwhere the standard comes in yes that's\nwhere you of course the standard is\nmodeling but the the counter standard if\nthey don't meet you there is to say this\nisn't someone I'm going to continue\nmodeling that kind of investment for\nbecause they're not me there yeah that\nis oh man that is so well put and I'm so\nglad that you made that so clear because\nI couldn't agree with you more I feel\nlike we're limiting ourselves so much\nand we're actually creating what you\njust ended on there it's a really\npowerful point we're actually creating a\nculture that even if this relationship\nlasts it will be set at the wrong level\nso the culture of that relationship now\nis we sometimes text we rarely call and\nnow even if the relationship lasts and\nwe do like each other a little bit it's\nnever going to change from that so\nyou're way better off setting the\nstandard and the culture from day one\nand seeing if it develops and grows and\nI find Mo what most people do and I\nthink we've all experienced this is for\n3 to six months we try not disrupt the\nculture and then 6 months later we're\nlike no no no but I always wanted this\nand I thought we were going to get there\nand the person's like no no no but this\nis what we are and I remember that rad\nwho's the only person I've ever been\nwith since I left the monastery like it\nwas like like she was the person that I\nwas fully clear with about who I was\nwhat are my expectations were where we\nwere and thankfully she was that back\ntoo and we had some really hard\nconversations early on about some big\nthings that were important to her not\nimportant to me important to me not\nimportant to her and what I loved was\nhow we talked about those things and how\nhow we kind of navigated those things\nand it's not that we're perfect and we\ndon't have issues we have so many\nchallenges you know we've been together\nfor 11 years now there's so so many\nthings that have come up over the years\nthat have given us different challenges\nbut the difference is we set a culture\nof how to deal with difficult things\nearly on and I think what I hear time\nand time again and I know you hear this\nprobably 10x the amount I hear this it\nall comes down to the fact that we want\npeople to like us so bad that we're\nwilling to act unlike ourselves in order\nfor them to like us because if they can\nlike a version of us then that's good\nenough for us and so if the version is I\nnever bother you I never text I never\ncall you we will be that person for you\nbecause that makes you like me we all\nlove to be referred to as that person\nwho's like oh yeah they're low\nmaintenance and we love that label we're\nlike yeah yeah I'm low maintenance and\ninside we're like yeah I mean I've got\nway more needs than this but guess what\nI've set the culture of being low\nmaintenance now a year later\nthey're like wait a minute you were low\nmaintenance a year ago why are you high\nmaintenance yeah and there there's two\nproblems with that one is that it can\nactually make it so that someone can't\neven really read us or our intentions\nit's a bit like when someone is like\nwants to be cool and indifferent well if\nI there's a story I tell in the book of\na friend of mine who was dating someone\nand then went on a trip and he didn't\nreally reach out to her on that trip and\nby the time he got home after a few days\nshe said to him it on the phone it the\nfact that you were away and you didn't\nreally speak to me made me feel funny\nlike it made me feel like you might have\nbeen sharing your bed with someone else\nMH and they hadn't been on like this\nisn't two people who had been dating for\nsix months they'd been on a couple of\ndates but that was the moment when he\nsaid to me I think I like this\nperson because there was an\nintentionality to it she didn't go I'm\nbeing high maintenance by saying\nthis she just communicated what she was\nfeeling and by doing that instead of\nbeing cool indifferent girl like like\nchill I'm chill like I don't care that\nyou didn't text me while you're were\naway she went no no no no it made me\nfeel funny yeah because it would the\nsubtext is it would hurt me to know like\nmaybe we haven't known each other that\nlong but it would still make me feel\nsomething to know that You' shared your\nbed with someone else while you were\naway that's a that's a very powerful\nthing to do because if he's seeing\nmultiple people in that moment all of\nthem playing cool IND different whatever\nhe now sees someone who is actually\ntelegraphing the kind of person she is\nthat she's a three-dimensional\nperson with real\nfeelings and that she wants something\nmore she is not the kind of person yeah\nto date if you don't want something more\nmhm and by the way even the first time\nsomeone gets like just a little bit\njealous of something can be a moment of\nintentionality in a relationship cuz you\nthe moment you see someone's a little\nbit like they convey a little bit of\neven if it's playful jealousy oh I don't\nlike that made me feel funny you're not\nallowed to text that whatever you can go\nyou it almost can make you like that\nperson more because you can go oh that's\nlike it's almost like you've telegraphed\nthat we've gone to a a new level where\njealousy is even possible yeah because\nat the beginning jealousy wasn't even\npossible now it is you must like me I\nthink I like you too you know it's like\nthere's a we're so afraid of of saying\nthese things that actually Telegraph\nintentionality which is a really really\npowerful thing yeah but we're but it all\ncomes down back to the root of we're so\nscared because we're scared that that\nperson will leave and often they will\nbecause their friends saying to them oh\nyeah man they're psycho are they're\nobsessive leave right and so we don't\nwant these extreme labels and I think\noften so we're scared of looking\nunattractive we're scared of being\nunwanted we're scared of being rejected\nright that's the reason we don't say any\nof this because we're like if I say that\nthey're going to think I'm psycho crazy\nobsessed and I don't want to come across\nthat way and so I won't say anything\nuntil one year on which by the way\nthey're going to think the same exact\nthing when it's a full surprise so I\nwant to talk to you about that and then\nthe other idea that I see a lot of that\npeople get stuck on is when they say\nsomething they say it as a demand or a\ncommand where it's like well I expect\nyou to do this and that's where I think\nit's unhealthy because I like someone\nbeing honest with me but I also don't\nwant that to be my progress report\nbecause I may have a really good thing\nto say back and so if I'm going to say\nback if someone was like if someone said\nthat to me like you didn't contact me\nI'll be like yeah you know what when I\ntravel I actually really struggle to\nstay in touch with anyone because I'm\nreally trying to be present I'm really\ntrying to immerse but now that I know\nthat's a value for you next time I go\naway let's talk about how often we can\nboth keep it touch realistically because\nI'm also not going to promise I'm going\nto call you every single day even if I'm\nreally excited about you because I'm\nalso going to set my standard back and I\nthink often people don't want to hear\nthat either they want to hear someone\nsay oh of course I I understand\neverything you're saying and I'm going\nto call you every day when I go away\nagain and so one side is you're scared\nof getting fully rejected and the other\nside is you're scared of not getting\nexactly what you want and I don't think\nboth those expectations are useful\nbecause you might get rejected and\nyou're never going to get exactly what\nyou want in an authentic way no and I I\nI think that's why we if we're the one\nwho wants something we have to zoom out\nenough to look at whether this person\nand what they bring to our life and what\nthis relationship is like holistically\nmhm is enough for us because we may say\nI want this person to call me every day\nbut that may genuinely not be their\nstyle right it's they're not someone who\nenjoys sitting on the phone as much as\nyou do yeah um they might pick up the\nphone and call you every couple of days\nbut in the meantime they will text you\nor you have to it's like you have to\nzoom out and go how much of this\nrelationship not these moments whether\nthey call or not how much of this\nrelationship correct\nmeets my needs you know what what are\nthe fundamental things well I need to\nfeel safe with someone like I need to\nfeel like they actually want me and that\nI'm not kind of investing under a\nmisapprehension about what this is I\nneed to know at a certain point that\nregardless of our differences we're\ngiving this a go and we're exclusive\nright so that might be one thing another\nthing is I need to feel like whether\nit's on the exact platform I might have\nhoped I need to feel like I get enough\ncommunication you know holistically in\nthis relationship to feel\nlike I'm actually connected to this\nperson you know if someone ve very\nrarely travels and then they go away and\nyou don't hear from them a lot when they\ntravel that may not be a big deal if\nthey're on the road half the year and\nthen they're not really connecting with\nyou while they're traveling that's going\nto have a much bigger impact on your\nlife it doesn't make them wrong but it\nmight not be enough for you yeah and\nthat's where we have to start getting\nreally honest with ourselves we get so\ncaught up in who's right and wrong and\nwe don't spend enough time just asking\nis it right for me is it is this does\nthis person work well with me are we\ncompatible and and compatibility is is\neverything you know you can't I talk\nabout four levels of importance in any\nrelationship or any person any dynamic\nyou have with a person the first one is\nadmiration that's just you admiring\nsomeone it doesn't mean very much they\nmay not even know you exist the second\none is mutual attraction that's when you\nactually know you like each other the\nthird one is commitment that's when you\ndon't just like each other but you're\nactually saying yes to the relationship\nand the fourth one is compatibility\nbecause actually love isn't all you need\nMH you need two people who actually work\nwell together you know is it's not is\nthis person you know am I good at\nhandling them and are they good at\nhandling me mhm like that's a pretty I\nthink that's a pretty good barometer of\na relationship we I came to this that's\na great one yeah because you're going to\ncome with your stuff this nonsense of\nlike we have to come to a relationship\nfully healed who does no one who like\nit's an it's a it's this idea that gets\ntalked about that no one actually does\nno one comes to I'm going to make myself\nwhole and heal and everything before a\nrelationship good luck and by the way\nhalf the people who say that stuff who\nhave been married 10 years they weren't\nthat way when they met their partner\ntotally so we find imperfect people you\nknow the we are damaged vessels that\nsomehow still work and that's beautiful\nand we're trying to find another damaged\nvessel that we go oh I understand the I\nunderstand the fabric of their\nchallenges and what they struggle with\nor at least I it makes sense to me when\nI hear it and you know I have compassion\nfor it and I have empathy for it and I\nhave affection for it even um and vice\nversa and so now when we go through our\ninevitable things we're just good at\nhandling each other so it's when we when\nwe have a\nstandard we may not end up exactly where\nwe want to be but the ultimate standard\nof holistically are you getting what you\nneed from this\nrelationship that's a really important\nquestion that not enough people ask and\nas a result they suffer in unhappy\nrelationships yeah it's so interesting\nto get into that kind of you know to go\nbeyond that superficial conversation of\nmake a list of what you want and like\nyou know try and find it out and you\nknow that that kind of egocentric list\nthat we get let's let's talk a bit about\nbreakups\nbecause I think the challenge is that\neveryone in their life goes through at\nleast one or two maybe more really\npainful breakups whether it's infidelity\nwhether it's out it feels out of the\nblue someone just goes yep not working\nout for me anymore whether it's\ndifferent goals and different plans and\npriorities that emerge over time and I\nthink everyone who goes through a\nbreakup blames it on themsel often\nthinks that this is the end there'll\nnever be another person and it feels\nlike a really dark dark dark empty road\nand a lonely road and I think it's\nreally interesting because there's so\nmany you know pieces of advice and\neverything about like how to get over a\nbreakup and and I've talked about that\nas well myself but I just find that it\nseems to be a path that you have to walk\nand have to take and there's no real\nacceleration or there's not as you said\nthere's not like I'm going to get over\nthis break up in 3 months right there's\nno timeline line or deadline that you\ncan set on it but it's just\nuncomfortable and it's almost like\nsitting in discomfort what do we do when\nwe're sitting in that discomfort well\nwhen you're in the depths of it cuz\nthere's different phases right like\nthere's a certainly a phase of any\nheartbreak when it's genuine deep\nheartbreak where you are just\nquestioning Your Existence where you are\nlike I this you know I remember having\nmy own heartbroken and sitting on this\ndoor the the doorstep of my house with a\nfriend of\nmine and just with tears in my eyes\nsaying to him I just feel like I'm not\ngood enough like that was my deep sense\nwas that I am not good enough and if I\nwas good enough I would have been able\nto make this\nwork\nand and that's a that's a horrible place\nto\nbe and you you know we have to have\ncompassion for ourselves in those times\nbecause it's brutally\ndifficult it's a time where we just need\nlove and we need to celebrate the fact\nthat we got through another day and that\nwe got I managed to get out of bed\ntoday and you know it was a Act of it\nwas a heroic act for me to just get out\nof bed we then have to you know I always\nthink that\nall of these moments give us gears that\nwe wouldn't have had\notherwise and the worst pain of my life\nhas given me access to gears that I\ndidn't know I\nhad and as much as no one wants to hear\nit when they're in it those gears turn\nout to be really\nvaluable they they really do I mean we\nall choose suffering in our lives like\nwe we choose to go to the gym that's\nchoosing suffering\nwe choose like to write a book this\nchoosing a form of suffering we choose\nto make a podcast or we choose to climb\na literal mountain or like we choose\npain in our lives regularly because we\nknow that it gives us there are benefits\nto be had I have to argue that the\nbenefit I have gotten from the pain that\nI didn't choose MH has been no less\nvaluable than the benefit I've gotten\nfrom the pain I did choose in fact at I\nthink the most valuable pain I've ever\nhad is the pain I didn't\nchoose and when you realize that you can\nkind of almost I think look at some of\nthe worst moments of your\nlife as like a menu of pain and beside\nthe item on the menu is the very\nspecific unique benefits that can only\ncome from this kind of\npain and you can kind of imagine\nyourself\nchoosing like retroactively choosing\nthat pain which is a very valuable thing\nto do because there's I was told by a\npsychologist about an experiment on rats\nwhere uh one rat was on a wheel and was\njust given you know like the free reain\nto just run whenever it wanted to run\nthere was another rat this was rat a rat\nB was connected to that wheel he was on\nanother wheel that was connected to rat\nA's wheel and anytime rat a chose to run\nrat B had to run right so both doing the\nsame amount of\nexercising but at the end of the\nexperiment rat a shows all the positive\nmarkers of exercise and rat B shows all\nthe negative markers of stress oh\nwow same amount of exercise what's the\ndifference well rat a chose to run rat B\ndidn't and there there's something found\nabout that to me because if we can take\na situation that we didn't choose who\nwould choose to be heartbroken right\nit's the worst it's a terrible pain but\nbut what if in that pain you did realize\nlike there is\nsomething here that I'm going to gain\nfrom this\nexperience that I couldn't have any\nother way that if I look on that menu of\npain this one has some really good\nbenefits like this one has some really\namazing stuff who who I'm going to have\nto become to get through this what I'm\ngoing to have to learn the way I'm going\nto have to get Comfort even just to get\nthrough a\nweekend right now on my own is is going\nto be this unbelievable feat and to get\ncomfortable in my own company and to sit\nin this pain and it there are such\nprofound benefits from that what if I\ndid actually look at those benefits and\nsay they're so powerful\nthat I'm going to choose this pain so\nthat I can experience those benefits and\nso you you turn yourself from rat B to\nrat a and all of a sudden you're not a\nvictim of that pain anymore you're\nyou're the\nbeneficiary of these Exquisite gifts\nthat you could only get this way and\nthat that's only that's one tool I've\nused to get through some of the worst\nworst pain of my life and then on a\npract on a psychological level with\nheartbreak what I always remind people\nis that if anyone who doesn't choose you\ncannot be for you they if they don't see\nyou like what is a relationship it's\nsomeone sees you they accept you and\nthey want\nthat that's that's the most beautiful\npart of a relationship so if someone\ndoesn't see you and accept you and want\nwhat they see then this relationship is\nmissing the most beautiful part of any\nrelationship it it shouldn't even be you\nknow it shouldn't be desirable at that\nstage because it's not it has failed the\nfundamental test of what makes a\nrelationship worth having we're not\ntalking about a person who you know in\nin at least the case I feel we're\ntalking about the person who was taken\nfrom us by life we're talking about a\nperson who's just walking around\nsomewhere still existing on the planet\nbut choosing not to be with us\nthat should lose its romance to\nus you know and and to say well if\nthat's the other game we play is if it\nwas a different time in life if they\nwere a bit older they would have been\nready to commit if they had been in a\ndifferent phase where they weren't so\nbusy with their work they might have had\nthe space to really give to this\nrelationship but they said their work\nisn't allowing them to if it is like we\ngo through all these scenarios where it\nit forces us into this sad love song of\nright person wrong\ntime and that's a really like pernicious\nstory you that's a very dangerous story\nbecause it it takes what belongs in the\nrealm of Science\nFiction and brings it into our reality\nlike it when we're thinking about an ex\nfrom like five years ago and we're like\nI miss them I don't know what you know\nyou don't even know who they are\nanymore that was 5 years ago they're a\ndifferent person now in many ways you're\na different person now in any way if you\ngot together now you'd be getting\ntogether as different people you miss a\nghost person doesn't exist anymore in\nthe way that you think they do you know\nand when you're saying oh if only we met\n5 years from now it would have worked in\nwhat parallel universe it's a this is\nscience fiction like it's not it didn't\nhappen in this universe so it's it's\nlike it is wishing for a parallel\nuniverse where everything all the\ndominoes unfolded in a different way\nit's not this universe so we just we\nhave to get out of this mindset because\nit gets us bought\ninto a a science fiction story that\ndoesn't really exist I don't believe in\nthe right person at the wrong time it's\nthe right person is right in their\npersonality they're\nready and they life is compatible with\nyours if you're missing one of those\nthree things then it's not the right\nperson the right person has to be more\nthan someone who you have a great time\nwith and you like who they are and have\ngreat conversation and and and great\nintimacy that can't that's not the only\ncriteria for someone who's right so we\nhave to stop telling ourself the story\nthat someone who you know broke up with\nus or it was bad timing or whatever is\nthe right person for us that is a that\nis just a story it is not reality the\nright person is the person it happens\nwith Matthew AI book's called love life\nthat was that hit right there man that\nthat resonated so deeply if you
