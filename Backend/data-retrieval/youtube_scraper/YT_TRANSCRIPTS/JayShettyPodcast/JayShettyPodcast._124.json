brighter content for\nyou in the world subscribe right now the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nJ shett the one the only J\nshett what's your earliest childhood\nmemory of being creative like do you\nremember the first thing you put\ntogether you were just telling me you\neven had this shirt made that you're\nwearing today like what was one of the\nfirst things you remember saying oh wow\nI did something as a kid okay here\nhere's what I really remember yeah so I\nyou know know I didn't have the luxury\nof having like insane musical\ninstruments at my fingertips and\nrecording studios and I I was from a I\nwas from the middle of nowhere so\nI my brother had a boom box an old\nschool boom box and I had a smaller old\nschool boom box and I I was l i remember\nmy earliest memories at probably I'm\nprobably like five or six and I\nremember realizing\nthat music you know when I first heard\nmusic I always thought that that like\nthe the musician was at the radio\nstation singing the song and I was like\nhow do they keep coming back to the\nstation I didn't even understand how\nmusic was created but somewhere very\nearly I figured out that it was like a\nmulti-rack\nsituation and I would take I had a boom\nbox and I would record like me like\nhitting like this into the boom box okay\nthen I would press play on that one and\nthen I would do the next thing on the\nother boom box and record into that one\nand I would keep going back and forth\nuntil I created like a track I guess I\nwas creating like my own like eight\ntrack and multi-track of of layering\nthings and I didn't even know what it\nwas but I was just so excited that I was\ndoing it and my whole career has been a\nversion of that like I I have no\ntraining I'm not good at anything I'm\nI'm really like I like I like I know\npeople are like oh you're being humble I\nI'm really not great at anything I have\nlike a Ultimate Will to get things done\nlike I'm like this will happen um but no\nit's just I'm always trial and error and\nI always tell people people are always\njust like well how did you do this how\ndid you and I'm like honestly like just\ngoing in and I I I I call it making a\nmess I like to go in and throw a bunch\nof [ __ ] around the room throw pain at\neverything and then we worry about\ncleaning it up later but maybe a few of\nthose things just happen to land\ncorrectly and I just keep doing that\nuntil everything fully lands where I\nwanted to and I'm just playing clean up\naround the sze that's a beautiful way of\ndescribing the process but what gave you\nthat where does that will or that\nconfidence come from because I think a\nlot of people are scared of creating a\nmess or scared of things not sticking so\nthey never try whereas it sounds like\nyou're the opposite where you're like\nwell I don't care if it doesn't try I'm\nwilling to give it a go where does that\ninner confidence that inner ability to\nsay hey it's okay come from I don't care\nabout failure at all I don't care and I\nnever did I think when I was younger I\ndidn't understand what failure was like\nwhen you're you know when you're six\nwhen you're seven when you're 12 you\ndon't there's not many people to let\ndown you know what I mean you let down\nTimmy at school is your friend sorry\nTammy but but\nyou you're not thinking about that and I\nalways I just remember from the\nbeginning like my mom was like I wanted\nto drop out of school and you know my\nmom was Raising me alone and it was I\nwas probably 15 16 at the time and I was\nlike Mom I know what I want to do she\nwas like what do you want to do I'm like\nthe music stuff like I'm so into it and\nI know and I looked her and I go I know\nI'm going to be the biggest in the world\nand she was just like what are you you\nknow and I've asked her I've asked my\nmom like later in life like how did you\nlike Trust me in my journey and she\nalways\nsaid that she had dreams that she never\ngot to try in her life and a lot of\npeople are just way too scared to take\nthe jump you know a lot of people may\nhave I'm sure everyone in this room\nanyone listening has a little something\nwhere they're like oh I really like that\nbut they're scared they're scared\nthey're like you know I W you know I\nwant to post videos of me cooking online\nno no no no no one will like it my\nfriends will make fun of me I want to I\nsing in the shower like I want no no no\nno no because we're taught to just\nfollow suit and do whatever you're\nsupposed to do you report to your boss\nbut but it doesn't have to be like that\nlike if you want to try to be like a\nmusician an entrepreneur whatever it's\nscary and like I'm sure you've had\nmoments like that where you're like yo\nwhat am I doing but if you do try I\nbelieve that if you keep pushing\nyourself and you keep trying you're\ngoing to succeed and I always tell\npeople this it may not be in what you\nstart with you know like when I started\nI thought I was going to be the biggest\nrap artist in the world and am I a\nrapper now no and then I moved into\nproducing and then I moved into\nsongwriting and then it's come full\ncircle now where I'm like an artist of\nsome sorts again and I think you just\njump in and just try something just try\nand who cares if you're going to fail\nwho cares if you fail I don't understand\nthat's the thing I don't understand it's\njust you just get up and you do it again\nI like I have amnesia the second I feel\nthe second I feel I'm like the next day\nI wake up I'm like all right let's do it\nagain you know that's an amazing mindset\nso we we share something in common\nalready we both grew up wanting to be\nfamous rappers yeah I'm being you yeah\nno that was like my passion like poetry\nspoken word writing lyrics like all I\nlistened to was hip-hop and rap growing\nup if you ask me at 16 years old what I\nwanted to be that's what I wanted to be\nand it's so interesting because today I\nfeel I use the same skills that I wanted\nto use then but in a completely\ndifferent way I still write I write\nbooks instead of Records I teach\nmeditation which includes music it\nincludes Cadence it includes rhyme often\nbut not in the way that a rapper would\nand I'm using spoken word constantly to\nget messages out into the world but in a\ndifferent way and so I love what you\njust said about that idea of how you\nactually may succeed but in a way\ncompletely different to what you\noriginally dreamed of I hope it goes\nfull circle for you I want to hear I\nneed to hear the J Shady Rap\nwhat was your rap name oh God I don't\nknow if I need to go that far it was\nembarrassing but I I'll tell you later\nI'll tell you privately me later is J\nshett your real name yes it's such a\nthat's the perfect Rapp yeah J shett\nsounds like a fire rver yeah from like\nEast London okay I'm from North London\nso not far all right yeah not far okay\ncool I like it I like it but no I I I\nreally appreciate what you're saying\nthere and I think that Amnesia to\nfailure wow like that that's I love that\nidea of having Amnesia with failure can\nyou give me a time was that always the\ncase or was there a failure that like\ndid kind of Pierce that Veil it never\nhas I can see from your face no no I\nremember when I was going to quit music\none time before I M right before I made\nit my my mentor passed away he uh he he\ntook his own life and I was really young\nit was one of my best friends and I'm\nprobably like 18\nand I remember like sitting in my bed\nand I was just like I was like crying I\nlike didn't understand you know it was\none of the\nfirst times that somebody who wasn't\nsupposed to die died you know I've had\nlike you know i' lost my grandmother and\nlost my grandfather but it was like the\nfirst time in my life for like someone\nthat like I really knew and really\ntouched me and I talked to them the day\nbefore they died and it's like I I\nremember remember like that hitting me\nlike so hard in a way that I didn't know\nwas even possible like you know I'd been\nsad I but I I remember sitting there in\nbed and I was just like I'm just going\nto quit I was like I got to quit making\nmusic and\nthen in that very same moment like my\nhead flipped and I was just like no you\ncan't you got to like take on with this\ndude started cuz he didn't he was also a\nmusician and he didn't get totally he\nwas you know he was well known and he\nwas a hero to me but he didn't get where\nI think he deserved to and I remember\nbeing like I got to do this like I got\nto like he would want me to be doing\nthis he would and that was like the only\ntime where it wasn't even failure it was\nlike the only time where I like really\nquestion things and but don't get me\nwrong every time I do something good in\nlife I'm questioning it's not it but\nit's like a different feeling I don't\nknow if you have this but I'll have a\nnumber one song like a number one song\nit's the biggest song in the whole world\nand I I'll like look in the mirror and\nI'll be oh that's the last one like\ndefinitely not going to have another\nnumber one song again not saying I'm\nlike scared of the failure I'm just like\noh that's just like the last one that's\nwhat I did or I'll something really good\nwill happen in my life and I'm like oh I\nI'll never recreate that again and but\nin the same breath I'm like let's go\nlike I'm like let's keep rolling you\nknow and and I've I've tried to do this\nthing lately uh in the last like five or\n10 years where I really like take in my\nachievements cuz for a while I never\nthought of them I would just keep going\nlike when it was time they'd be like oh\nyour song's number one I'd be like okay\nthat's cool what are we doing next week\nand I figured out like it's okay to do\nthat it's okay to like take a breath and\nbe like yo we just did this [ __ ] like\nthis is tight like we did this this is\ngreat and and yeah I just I I'm trying\nto do that more and failure like no I've\nnever had one of those because whenever\nI do fail I'll sit and I obviously like\nI'll sit there and I'll be like this\ndidn't work how out how I wanted it to\nbut so many times have been the opposite\nwhere I was like this will never work\nand then it's big so it's like I feel\nlike it always evens out and you only\nhave one other choice it's like your\nonly choice is just to keep going what\nare you supposed to do just be like it\ndidn't\nwork no get up and you do it again yeah\nI've got so many questions I want to\ndive into so much that you said so\nrewind with your Mentor how did you\nfirst and and I'm so sorry to hear thank\nyou for sharing with us you know such a\nchallenging event and uh I lost my\nmentor four years ago he passed away\nfrom stage four brain cancer during the\npandemic so I couldn't go back to see\nhim because I couldn't take a flight and\nso I couldn't couldn't be his funeral so\nyou know that yeah was super rough for\nme it was more recent but how did you\nmeet your mentor and how did you form a\nbond I think a lot of successful people\nhave mentored they have guides they have\nteachers they have coaches but then\nsometimes when you're listening to a\nconversation you're like this you're\nlike I want someone to be my mentor but\nI don't know where to start I don't know\nhow to find them like what does that\nmean like how did you connect I had I've\nhad so many mentors I have mentors every\nday I'm a mentor to people but sometimes\nmy mentees are my mentor like I'm\nalways you always got to be open to just\nlistening and learning every day I\nlearned something I was in the studio\nyesterday with a guy who's one of my men\nhe's like the way I met I got to tell\nyou that story later that's that's\nthat's insane I I I'll go to that I'll\ntell that after first one is I met my\nmentor I was this is when he was like my\nsecond or third Mentor I I met a lot of\nmy re really important mentors in my\nlife when I was about 13 um I was a\nmusician I was traveling for music at\nthe time I had gotten like some buzz and\nMyspace was a thing yeah I remember\nMyspace and and I had somehow created a\nprofile where I had a bunch of followers\nokay so I don't even remember how I did\nit but I was a kid I used to do it in\nthe library at school and there was this\nguy he was a producer I was obsessed\nwith him I DM well messaged him the the\nthe equivalent of DM today I remember\nmessaging him and I was like I love your\nstuff blah blah blah and then no\nresponse and I was like oh I love you\nlike please blah blah blah no response\nthen I saw like a few weeks later he was\nadvertising he was like I have studio\ntime available it's like you know $500\nor something and I remember just being\nlike okay the only way I'm going to meet\nthis guy is if I get the studio time so\nI say I'm interested in the studio time\nhe says great come to New York and meet\nme here he had no idea where I was I\ndrove to New York and I drove we drove\nlike four hours to New York I get to New\nYork I get in with him the first thing I\nsay is I'm like I don't really need\nstudio time I just want to talk to you\nplease I'll do anything I just want to\nwork with you I'll do whatever you say\nbut then he was just like this was\ninsane he said I'm leaving this weekend\nI need my studio booked the whole\nweekend it's $850 for the for the two\ndays you need to book it if you can book\nit I'll let you work for me wow I called\nevery single person I know I spent every\nyou know I had like a few hundred bucks\nthen like I would like beg my friends\nfor money I had like a few knew a few\nrappers at the time that wanted studio\ntime and I like figured it out and he\nwas just like he got back I did it like\nI just did it in the nick of time and he\nwas just like all right you can work you\nstart next week and I would I would\ndrive up every weekend from Virginia to\nwork with him when I from when I was\nlike 16 17 and we created this Bond and\nit was like he was tough on me it was\nlike he was like not an easy guy like I\nremember like I I walked in and I had a\nhard drive filled with all of my music\nokay everything I had been making and he\nlike took it he listened to it he\nejected it and then he threw it out the\nwindow he threw my hard drive out the\nwindow broke into a million pieces no\nmore hard drive and he was like not good\nenough start again and it was like yeah\nhe was like super Sensei it was like\nKarate Kid and I like hated him in the\nmoments for it but so many he taught me\nso many things that like I learned and\ntaught me things not to do as a mentor\nand like and you know I it was it was a\nreally special time and now I just want\nto jump to this okay yeah please yeah go\nI love it let it so I'm you know this is\nI don't know almost 10 years ago now\nmaybe eight years ago and I'm playing\npoker at a

into some recording studios and he\nwas like he was like yeah yeah yeah yeah\nyeah I'm so excited so like you know\nfirst week first three sessions it's his\nfirst session is the weekend his second\nsession is Travis Scott and like his\nthird session was like Maroon 5 so it's\nlike he's getting thrown into it so I\nremember we're at the first session and\nI'm just like be cool blah blah it's uh\nit's the weekend and the weekend's in\nthere and we're like all in a room and\nwe're just like singing into microphones\nlike we're chilling and he's like I I\nknow his mind's blown weekend's favorite\nartist at the time and I remember he\nwhen no one's looking he like sneaks a\npicture and he accidentally has his\nflash on so it goes and it has the noise\ntoo and so it was like and when it did\nit he went and threw his phone and and\nsomehow the weekend didn't notice and\nlike I pulled him aside after and I'm\nlike dude you can't do that BL fast\nforward he's in high school and I say\nhey I'm in the middle of I was in the\nmiddle of making Ed Sheeran's divide\nalbum and I was producing the whole\nthing and I was like I need some help on\nthe road if I talk to your school and\nget you off will you come and he was\nlike yeah of course took him on the road\nfor like 2 weeks it mind was blown uh\nthen you know he starts going to NYU\nSchool of C Davis School of\nMusic and he uh I have another\nopportunity I talk to his teachers I\ntake him on the road for like a month\nwe're on tour with Hy then he's coming\nback to work for me now okay we've never\ntalked about him making music at all and\nwe're sitting there one day it's late at\nnight and he said my therapist said he's\ngoing to stop working with me if I don't\nplay my music I said what do you mean\nyou make music and he's like yeah yeah I\nmake music I was like why didn't you\never play it for me he's like I was so\nscared I was trying to get better blah\nblah blah\nhe plays me some songs they're terrible\nthey're like they're awful but like I\ncan hear something in him and I know\nhe's so you know in music so much of it\nis like getting an artist to feel\ncomfortable getting them to believe\ngetting them to you know so much of it\nis your personality and he had that he\nhad the it factor I saw when he was with\nlike artists he knew how to talk to them\nhe knew how to make them feel good just\nlike getting them food everything and\nyou know he spent years just seeing how\nI did it with artists and I decided to\nsign him I was like I'm gonna sign you\nand he went on this journey and now he's\none of the biggest music producers in\nthe world I mean last year he won you\nknow best record at the Grammys he's had\nlike five or 10 number one records like\nthis guy started he was so humble he was\n15 years old now he's like probably 26\n27 and he did he just went on the\njourney he knew when his time was and he\nwent in and he did it and it was just\nlike I always tell people you know you\njust got to stick through it you got to\nstick around you know and when I first\nsigned him it wasn't working for him it\ntook him like a few years for it really\nto like connect and he's just like s\nit's such a fun story for me that's a\nbrilliant story yeah to you know and\nI've been fortunate enough to have that\na few different times in my life with\npeople and it was so cool because I had\nthat experience and we're all to pay it\nforward is just yeah the intern\napplications to the Benny Blanca school\nof music just went through the roof like\nnow the re's going to get hit up this\nall we going dude I love that no it's\nit's uh it's it's beautiful to hear that\nand and also what I love about that\nmessage is when your Mentor throws your\nhard drive outside the window like it's\nso easy to be like I'm never going back\nlike he's crazy like I'm never going\nback it's like Whiplash oh yeah right\nlike that was my life that was my I was\ncleaning toilets with a toothbrush like\nthat was my real life yeah that's what I\nwas thinking of when you were describing\nit I was I felt exactly like that I'm\nthinking you know it's but how do you\nshow up again and recognize this value\nbecause I think now we're in a place as\nwell where it's like if something like\nthat happened we'd be like oh no get out\nof there it's you know I know I know it\ndid change a little bit like you\nwouldn't do that that's what I mean you\nwouldn't throw someone's H Drive no I\nwould never do those type of things I'm\nnot I'm just like not that type of I'm\nnot like a yelling person I'm not like a\nit's just like not that's not my way of\ncommunication like if I was like sad\nabout something I'd be like man I think\nit's like probably almost worse like I'm\nlike I'd be like ah why would you do\nthat you know what I mean I go quiet\nyeah or I'd be like you know you know if\nyou're ever like in a you know in an\nargument in a relationship like I'm not\na yeller I'm like a I'm like a oh man\nlike I wish it was different ah like and\nI like can't even find the words usually\nat the beginning um and I think that's\nhow I am and I think like I really\nlearned that you don't have to do that\nstuff you you it worked for me it got me\nto where I am but it's like you\ncan you can be really positive you can\nyou can be a good influence on someone\nyou don't have to like you can be hard\non someone like I'm I'm definitely like\nI was definitely hard on on the guy I\nwas talking about Blake I was I was I\nwas tough on him but I was never like I\nwould never be mean I would never like\nthere's no reason to do that uh and what\nmade me keep going back I don't know\nsheer just will and drive like that\nthat's like I I just was like I what\nthey're trying that's what they're\ntrying to do they want me they want me\nto quit they want me to you know and\nlike I don't know I\nalways I don't know why I do it and I I\nI wonder you know sometimes I sit in bed\nand I'm like why why am I still working\nlike so hard like I still work like I've\nnever done a thing in my life like I'm\nstill wake up every morning I'm like all\nright I'm gonna do this then I'm gonna\ndo this and then I swear I'm gonna get\nthis thing and I always that's why I try\nto do different things that I'm not\nnecessarily great at to not that I'm not\ngreat at but that I don't have you know\nin music I can go in I can work with\nanyone I can do this but like yeah like\nmaking a cookbook being in a TV show\nI've never done these things so it's\nlike very interesting to me to start at\nthe bottom again and just like try to\nwork my way up yeah it's fun I love the\nclimb like that's my favorite part about\nlife yeah even everything like in a\nrelationship when you meet that person\nat the very beginning and it's like oh I\ngot to like make my way into their heart\nand they have to make their way into M\nand it's just all about I don't know\ngetting there is always the best and\nthen when you're there I'm just like all\nright what else can I I want to get I\nwant to get some you know what I mean\nlike so when you're like you know you do\nthe music stuff and you get there and\nyou're like I think the only thing where\nyou get there and it it just keeps\ngetting better is in a relationship with\nsomeone I think that's like the only\ntime you get there and you're like okay\nthis is cool like but when every other\ntime I'm just like okay cool like let's\ngo let's what do what do you think makes\nrelationships different that makes you\nfeel that way as opposed to music cuz in\nor anything else any other achievement\nnot mus\nwell I've never been in a relationship\nthe way that I've been in one with music\nbecause it's been like a 30y year\nrelationship so I have no idea what\nhappens 30 years from now in a\nrelationship but uh I just feel like in\na a relationship is like all these other\nthings I'm doing there's so many like\ntentacles like it's like you go this way\nand then you guys explore that together\nand you're exploring so many it's\nbasically anything I would explore in my\nlife I'm exploring with a partner and so\nit's like figuring out\nlike you guys are like figuring out\nthings together and it's so cool when\nyou have like a partner that like I\ndon't know like I I just get the feeling\nlike it's it's awesome when you can have\na partner that you look at and you're\nand it's like the end of the day and\nyou're like oh what did you do today and\nthey tell you and you're like that's so\ntight and you're like I want to do more\nlike when you can feed off of each other\nand just keep growing together it's like\nevery day is a new experience and you\nguys are like facing different things\ntogether and it's I don't know it's cool\nand I always tell my friend I was just\ntalking to my friend yesterday about\nthis I was like you always have to keep\nyour work and life Balan and I was like\nbecause you can feel it in the music and\nand art if you don't have love or you\ndon't have something so I always tell\nthem I always feel that it's just like\nthis I have like rules like every day\nlike I only work till like a certain\ntime I make sure I you know like cooking\nis very important to me in therapeutic\nso I make sure I do that like it's like\nXanax to me like I and I have like all\nmy things that I have to do to make that\nbound because I do push myself I shove\nmy head through that wall just that\ndrywall if I had to but at the at the\nsame time I try to do all the things\nit's like okay like every you know it's\nlike every Sunday I see my mom no matter\nwhat every single Sunday at the exact\nsame time it doesn't matter if I like\nstay up all night I'll I'll just go\nright into seeing her and it's just it's\nlike we have like a ritual we do and\nthen I have like my ritual where I go\nand get my groceries at the farmers\nmarket every weekend and there's just\nall these things that help keep you on\ntrack and grounded so you can keep doing\nwhat you're doing you know I mean I'm\nsure you have things like that for\nyourself absolutely I mean mine's\nsimilar I call my mom at the same time\nevery week cuz she's back in London\nwhere I was born and raised and so I\nhave the same time I call her on the\nweekend and yeah there's certain things\nthat have to be done that way and same\nwith you and you know I have a certain\ntime as as well that I switch off from\nwork and I'm not looking at my phone I\nhave a time in the morning of like 3\nhours of being awake before I'm doing\nany work and I have to take that time\nfor myself but what's interesting about\nwhat you're saying is that there's a\nmyth obviously that the Brokenhearted\nartist can pour into the music but\nyou're actually saying that if you have\nlove in your life that can also be felt\nthrough music yeah I think I think that\nat times it's good to have a broken\nheart but it's also good you know\nthere's a time and place for everything\nwhat time you wake up I wake up now at\n5:30 a.m. what what time did you wake up\nbefore uh usually it was like I was this\nyear has been different this year I've\nbeen really prioritizing 5:30 but up\nuntil last year it's probably like 6:00\nto 6:30 and what time do you go to bed I\ngo to bed at like 9:00 p.m. now really\nyeah I love my 8 hours of sleep so like\nif I get into bed at 9:00 I'll be out by\n9:15 okay and then if I wake up at 5:30\nI at like 8 hours and 15es asleep like\nit's what are you doing what are you\ndoing in those first three hours\nmeditating for a lot of it so I'll wake\nup at 5 :30 I'll be ready to sit down\nfor meditation by like 5:45 I'll\nmeditate for an hour and a half and then\n7:15 I'll go for a hike or go to the gym\nor yeah usually a hike or the gym from\n7:15 till about 8:15 8:30 get ready and\nthen 9:00 a.m. I'll take my first emails\nmeetings all that kind of stuff so I\nthink you came at 10 today so yeah yeah\nhour and a half 11 hour and a half is\nthat's that's a good meditation hour and\na half how do you even stay focused well\nI think it's it's it's a good question\nand I always say to people that when I\nstarted it wasn't one and a half hours\nlike you start up with doing like 7\nminutes and 20 minutes and 40 minutes\nand and what I found was just in the\nsame way as if you go to a trainer at\nthe gym you'd hope that they work out\nmore than you so as someone who teaches\nmeditation and helps people with\nmindfulness I believe that as a trainer\nand as a coach I have to do it for more\ntime and deeper time because otherwise\nif I'm only doing it for seven minutes\nand I'm me in you and you're only doing\nit for 7 minutes then how will I ever\nhave an experience to guide you deeper\nand so I've been doing that since I was\n18 now so it's been a long time and when\nI was a monk for three years it was\nlonger and that's where I got that\ndeepest experience of practice for it so\nI feel like if I didn't have those three\nyears of going really deep into the\npractice I may not have the focus I have\ntoday you a monk for three years yeah\nlike a real monk a real monk that's\ninsane I've never met a to show you\npictures I've never even met a monk I\nleft I'm not anymore but yeah she still\nHaven met a mon where where when was\nthis so I this was 2010 to 2013 and I\nwas a monk across India UK and Europe I\ntraveled between the three and I had a\nshaved head I wore robes I slept on the\nfloor we meditated for like four to\neight hours sometimes a day and so it\nwas a deep practice Yeah stand standard\nstandard 8 Hour standard 8 Hour\nmeditation is crazy when do you do\nanything else well sometimes you didn't\nthat was the point an 8 Hour meditation\nisn't that sleeping yeah I mean you can\ncount it as the same we sleep for a\nhours so yeah I uh you know my heart the\nhardest part for me with meditating is\nthat I instantly fall asleep i' I can\nfall asleep very easily good so I'll\ntell you why though the reason why that\nhappens during meditation or any\npractice of that sort is your body and\nmind are finally coming into syn and so\nit's your body saying I need sleep right\nnow yeah and so if if you're falling\nasleep during meditation it's not a bad\nthing it's just you've literally because\nwhat's happening when you're not falling\nasleep is your mind saying we got to do\nmore we got to do more and then finally\nwhen you become present you fall asleep\nbecause your body saying I've done\nenough today wait where do you do these\nmedit I have a little meditation room\nI'll take you to afterwards at our home\nyeah I want to do a meditation with you\nall right we'll do it I want to I want\nto learn I I you know I've done there\nwas like a time in my life when when I\nwas going through rough patch and then\nlike you know I was going to therapy and\nI was meditating and stuff and it\nactually helped me so much wow it help\nwhat was that during what were you going\nthrough when everything first started\nhappening for me all at once it was like\nreally overwhelming I was you know for\nthe first like year or two I was like oh\nthis is awesome and then like it really\nhit me because you know so many\ndifferent responsibilities and people\nasking you for money and like I just\ndidn't grow up in a way like I had never\nI didn't even imagine you know I was I\nwas young when I made it so I was like I\ndidn't really I didn't even realize\nabout like money and then I'm like oh my\nGod all like I have this what do I do\nwith the like and then it's like I have\nall the success and people need things\nfrom me and people want and it was just\ntoo much and where I grew up like I\ndidn't like I don't know I didn't go to\nlike therapy as a kid I didn't I didn't\nknow about any of that I didn't know\nwhat anxiety was I thought like every I\nwas like oh everyone the room spins for\neveryone when you like sit down and\nyou're like doing something yeah I I\njust there were so many things I didn't\nunderstand and I thought it was just my\nbody and I never talked to anyone about\nit and I was like oh there were just\nthings like I learned to live with and I\nremember like I just remember exactly\nwhere I was I\nwas like walking in to get a new cell\nphone I lost my mind and I I was and I I\njust couldn't handle it anymore and I\nremember like a week later I I went home\nto Virginia where my mom was living at\nthe time and I remember I was like in\nthe bathroom and I was like I like I\ndon't I can't do I was like I can't do\nthis anymore like I don't I can't I had\nthis feeling like this this crazy\nfeeling of anxiety that was like\ncrippling and it was like I couldn't do\nanything and I was just like I I was\nlike in the bathtub and I remember like\ncalling from I was crying and I was like\nI don't know I can't do this I don't\nknow what to do I like I can't even\nexplain the feel I I didn't know how to\narticulate the words I was like I can't\neven explain what I'm feeling to you I\nfeel like I'm going crazy and you know\nin my family you know there's some\npeople have some issues and I was always\nscared of\nmyself falling into some similar things\nthat are in my family that run in my\nfamily\nand I just remember somebody was\nsomebody got me to go to therapy and\nthey and I met this guy and he's my\ntherapist today still to this day this\nwas he's been my therapist for almost 20\nyears\nand I remember like I first went there\nand I had like all these things I was\nlike I used to like go and I'd have to\nlike hold my head like this and I was\nlike oh I can't let go of my arm because\nif I let go of my arm my neck's going to\nfall off and I'm going to be paralyzed\nlike I like CRA like I was so in deep\nand I never thought I was going to get\nout and I remember I started I used to\ngo six days a week and then it was like\nthree days a week then it was two days\nthen it was one and I and it was CBT uh\nyou know cognitive behavioral therapy\nand it's like kind of like\na type of therapy where you use your\nwords and it's not I was very I didn't\nwant to do medicine and I didn't you\nknow because I also had in my family\nthere's some drug abuse and stuff and I\nI I I was like I don't want to do this\nwith medicine I want to figure out how\nto do it the right way and at that time\nI wasn't now I'm like a workout fanatic\nthat's like my new\nmeditation uh but before that I was like\nwell how do I do this and I started you\nknow my therapist recommended meditation\nto me and he had this really easy way of\ndoing it and it was so easy and it\nwasn't I it wasn't even like anything\nspecific he was like just you know he\nwould just like it was the most basic\nform of meditation I would do it with\neither with a spoken word thing or just\nlike he'd be like find the most calming\nmusic you like and and I would and he\nwould just be like no matter what just\nevery day he was like for 20 to 30\nminutes just sit down put a pillow on\nyour head try not to be too comfy where\nyou'll fall asleep set a timer and just\ndo it and I remember doing it and at\nfirst it was impossible when I was like\nin my [ __ ] it was impossible and then\neventually I\nstarted like looking forward to that\ntime every day and it really just helped\nme a lot and then like in\n2018 and then I got like it it was was\nprobably like a year or so of and this\nwas probably\n2009 maybe this was happening and then\nlike then I like got back on track and\neverything was great and then uh in 2018\nI really\nlike working out became like my\nnew meditation like and it was just like\nlike I have to do it and it was so funny\nbecause I went so many years without\ndoing it and I'm sure in your life you\nwent years without doing meditation\nnow like what happens if you randomly do\nyou ever miss one ever like just like\nyou're sick I'll catch up I won't yeah I\ndon't meditate at 5:30 every day like\nit's not I I can't keep that up because\non planes we're traveling like our\nlifestyles don't allow it and so I will\nbe meditating in the evening the quality\nwell I find that for me the quality dip\nso the last week was one of those weeks\nI was I had like three massively late\nnights in a row on the weekend because\nof events and parties and things and\nthings that I was going to and I could\nwake up early and then I still had a\nfull day of work then in the evening I\nwas catching up with it and I found that\nI didn't have the time and space that I\nneed in order to feel really aligned and\nwhat I mean by that is I can still\noperate no one else will really notice\nthe difference but I notic the\ndifference where I'm like I feel like I\nhave less energy today I feel like I\nhave less Clarity today and I feel like\nI'm not\nas aligned is the best word I can think\nof as I like to be and so it doesn't\nreally affect anyone else but it does\naffect me and I know what level I can\nraise to which is what you're probably\nsaying when you're working out like when\nyou miss a day of working out how do you\nfeel now yeah yeah I I you know I\nthought of something when you were\nsaying yeah please so you're scen as\nlike you\nknow this guy who's like mindfulness\nHealth this like a isn't it aren't you\nsometimes do you feel like I have to be\nso perfect all the time you know it's so\ninteresting you say that Benny I I used\nused to think that when I started out\nthat that's what I had to be and then\nI've let go of that pressure personally\nlike I let go of that and I'm just like\nI'm saying to you now I don't wake up\nevery day at 545 to meditate sometimes\nI'm meditating on planes in Ubers on\ntrains sometimes I'm doing it while I'm\nfalling asleep like I I'm okay with\nopening up about that because to me that\na I hope well a it's the truth B I hope\nthat that actually helps people realize\nthat they don't have to have the perfect\nregime every single day because I used\nto think that and all I did was put more\npressure on myself like I'd stress\nmyself out so I'm more comfortable today\nsaying I believe in meditation I value\nmindfulness I value all these things but\nit doesn't look perfect in my life and\nit won't in yours either and it doesn't\nin anyone's whoever's life we think it\nlooks perfect in is is a myth yeah\nsometimes you get upset like if you get\nlike you're like a guy who's like not\nallowed to get upset like something\nhappened it's like it's it you know I\nfind that some sometimes what do you\nknow Benny what are you trying to say\nyeah exactly no I find sometimes in in\nin work like you know when you get to\nthe top of like your field people are\nonly expecting like a perfect Rec like\nlike if you're like say you're like\nLeBron James like if you don't have if\nyou score like 20 instead of like 40 in\nthe game they're like oh what's\nhappening to LeBron you know and it's\nthis like it's this pressure that that I\nknow exists for people and I just wanted\nto know yeah no I I definitely have felt\nthat pressure and I think I've removed\nit from myself that's what I realized\nthat ultimately it was a pressure I was\nputting on myself it wasn't actually\nfrom anyone else it was me thinking\nwhereas if I was just honest and\ntransparent and authentic with people\nthen all of a sudden the pressure's off\nand and I can also be a human because I\nam one uh and and I think I think\nthere's so much more of a joy in\nembracing our imperfections and flaws\nand recognizing that it's even with\ncoaching people by the I'm sure you feel\nthis with music like when you you\nworking with a artist to produce their\nalbum is like what I do with coaching\nclients so coaching clients come to me\nand say hey can we solve this problem\nwhatever else it may be someone's coming\nto you saying hey Benny can you make\nthis album with me and before I used to\nthink God if I don't say something\nprofound in the first hour of meeting\nsomeone then they're not going to think\nI'm worthy or valuable and I started to\nrealize I was like that blocked me from\nsaying something worthy it didn't allow\nme to be a Channel or\nI Wasing manufactured verion and even if\nI did now I was just setting myself up\nfor more pressure every time we met\nrather than just having a flowing\nexchange with someone how do you feel\nlike when an artist comes and says hey\nBenny I want you to produce my whole\nalbum where was the time it switched\nfrom pressure to just flow I never had\npressure because I don't care because I\ntreat every\nexperience like I I'll be like this you\nknow some people when you get in the\nstudio there's something or you're on a\nTV set or you're on here they're just\nlike oh we got to get it all done we\nhave to get this done today we have to\nfor me I'm just as happy if we were to\ncome in like if I came into this podcast\ntoday and you were like hey I'm sorry\nlike the equipment's not working then\nI'd be like oh let's just like chill we\nwalk around your thing because that's\nwhat was meant to happen that day and\nI'm not stressing because you know what\neventually we'll get like an interview\nor eventually we'll get a song or you\nknow I I'm a big like procrastinator\nwork like when someone comes over I'm\nlike you like to eat what do you want to\neat you want to eat something all eat\nall that stuff is part of it it's part\nof what's going to happen later you know\nwhat I'm saying or you like let's say\nyou have a client someone like you're\ntrying to get to the bottom or the root\nof a problem you're going to have to\ndisarm them and get them to chill yeah\nyeah definitely yeah it's not going to\nhappen through anything else what's your\num do you have do you have a setup\nprocess for every person or do you\nreally go with the flow with each\nindividual this stuff got caffeine in it\nit has natural caffeine from tea I'll\ntake a sip of it yeah yeah it's green\ntea green tea is really caffeinated\nright yeah yeah it's natural you drink\ncaffeine I only in the tea form only in\nthe tea\nform the tea form as in like I drink\nherbal tea and I drink this tea but I\ndon't that's good thanks man I\nappreciate it my wife and I put it\ntogether it's all natural go buy his\ndrink how do you come up

thing I\nwas 33% body fat I was like am I fat and\nI just didn't even I didn't even know\nthat I was being un you know unhealthy\nand then like that's when I started\nworking out and I got obsessed with it\nand it was like I wasn't necessarily\ntrying to lose weight but then like once\nI did I was like whoa this is cool and\nI'm one of those people now like when I\nlost the first weight it wasn't trying\nto lose weight it was just like trying\nto be healthy and then I felt like the\nfeeling every time I went to the gym I\nwas like whoa I have no anxiety like\nafter and I'm not thinking about\nanything else except like what's\nhappening and that was very rare for me\nso I was like I got to chase this\nfeeling and then now I like you know me\nand my friends we do like little

would\nbe like oh I can't waste the money like\nso I I got to go but if I if it was just\nup to me I wouldn't do it I wouldn't do\nit I wouldn't be able to do it it's just\nthat someone's you know or

like whoa and\nthey're telling all their friends and\nlike for me it's just like you're you\nknow this is like uh looking to give\nsomeone an org face at all times like\nevery moment like cuz that's what it is\nit's when you when someone tastes your\nfood they just like open their mouth and\nthey put in you just want them to be\nlike like you you just want that feeling\nthat when someone plays a song you want\nthem to be like oh my God that thing is\ncrazy you know like after you like\nchange someone's life and they can do a\nmeditation where they can like put their\nleg behind their head they're just like\noh thank you you brought me to a higher\nsense of being like it's it's that's\nwhat we're looking for and and I'm\nalways looking to make my friends happy\nI'm always you know if someone comes to\nmy house and they have like you know a\nhamburger and they're like I love this\nthis is my favorite hamburger I know\nthat so then I'm thinking like the next\ntime they come like oh I'm GNA like make\nsure they have that for them and you\nknow my grandma when I was a kid one of\nmy grandmas she you know she she was not\nWealthy by any means she grew up in it\nlike you know she her place was in\nSection 8 Housing and we would go visit\nher uh and she had a lot of grandkids\nand if we went over there and one time\nwe like had a juny and we were like we\nlove this it would be there every time\nwe ever went and she had so many\ngrandkids so everyone had every single\nthing and she would she would you know\nshe wouldn't eat for the week to make\nsure that like everyone had their things\nand and because it made her so happy The\nJoy she would have when everyone was\ncoming in and and all the things were\nthere we'd be like oh she has this and\nshe and that's what I like to do and I\nlove to create like whether it's like\nthe perfect napkin the perfect like meal\nthe perfect music playing at the same\ntime like you know and that's what I did\nwith this book I was like trying to\nteach people how to have like the\nperfect dinner party cuz I was like okay\nyou know some people they might not know\nwhat to do like you're nervous in the\nkitchen this book is going to make it so\nlike sure fire away you want something\neasy that looks good great you want to\nhave a dinner party like do you know\nwhat type of wine to serve I don't know\ndo you want to smoke weed with your\npeople does weed make you anxious who\nknows is it midnight and you want\neveryone to leave cuz you got to wake up\nat 5:30 the next day but you still want\nthem to love you I'm going to teach you\nhow to kick them out you know and it's\njust like I love that yeah it's that\nwhole thing and it's just like that\nmoment of just like getting a bunch of\npeople together and I love getting to\npeople together that don't necessarily\ngo together and it's like someone is\nlike a musician and they're sitting next\nto a man who wrote a book and I mean one\ntime we were at my house and I\nremember I was uh my\nmother was sitting here and siza was\nsitting here and a man on the other side\nactually makes rocket ships that go to\nspace and to me it was just so cool to\nsee them all talking and not caring\nabout you know what was going on and\nthere was no Egos and there was\neveryone's just having a good time and\nfood is like the best social lubricant\nin the world because it's like you can\nimmediately talk about something you're\nlike oh you like food it's just like the\nautomatic conversation starter yeah yeah\nnext time you come over we're going to\nhave to do food for sure because yeah\nthat's it's a big love language for my\nwife she loves she always say that's her\nlove language I want to her she wants to\nyeah you guys would have a you guys\nwould have a blah she loves cooking\ncreating recipes and also same as the\nUkraine community and it's actually\nfunny to say that I'm trying to think of\na book that you just reminded me of that\nwas based on a restaurant that did that\nand they recently converted it it became\n11 Madison Park in New York and it was a\nrestaurant that tried to give that level\nof care that you feel in a home and and\nso open wide your book I love I love\nthat it's not just a cookbook I love\nthat it's about how to build community\nand how all that cuz I think that's what\npeople miss out on right we think that\nhosting is about all the fancy stuff and\nit's like it isn't it's it's not about\nany of that the food you know my gu\nGodfather always said this thing he\nwould always say you know when I was a\nkid I never even understood it but I so\nunderstand it now he always used to say\nwe'd always figure out where we were\ngoing to dinner and he goes it doesn't\nmatter it's about the rap and I and and\nwe were like what do you mean he's like\nit's just about the rap he's like the\nonly thing it's just to get everyone\ntogether if the food's great that's\nawesome but it's about hanging with your\nfriends laughing till you cry you know\nfalling in love with someone fall you\nknow i' I've had the opportunity to have\ndinners where like so many things have\nhappened to people you know someone's\nfound the person they date somebody's\nyou know started a company somebody's\nlaugh so hard they cry you know and it's\nthat's that's what I'm trying to do and\nI love do do you ever you have dinners\nwith people and well it's one of my\nfavorite things to host as well yeah\nit's my favorite thing to do I don't\nwant to go out to a nightclub I want to\nlike sit at home with my friends till 2:\nin the morning well for you you can't do\nthat I can do that I can do that now\nwhat happens what happens if you stay up\nlate do you just self you combust not at\nall man I can stay late I just I just\nchoose not to always do it cuz I love\nsleep okay when you were out uh late\nthis weekend what time what time were\nyou out yeah probably probably get to\nbed around one or two okay and you and\nyou then what time did you sleep till oh\nno that the problem was I was still\nwaking up cuz my body clock so wired\nthat I was still up at the same time W\nno matter what I wake up at like 6:00 in\nthe morning no matter when I go to bed\nyeah I don't go to bed as early as you\nthough I'm like a if in my dream world I\ngo to bed at like 11:30 12 and then I\nwake up at like 6 6:30 and then on the\nweekends I really don't sleep a lot but\nI don't need a ton of sleep but I know\nI'm sure you're going to say that's\nterrible for me no not at all man I'm\nnot going to say anything's terrible it\nworks for you it works for you but you\nshould I should be getting more sleep\nright I mean scientists say 7 to n hours\na day what else do scientists say yeah\nexactly I don't know but that's I mean\nthat's what I'm saying I but yeah my\nwhole family I know I need eight and I\ncan survive on I can do five on six or\nfive if I needed to six and a half is my\nlike is your sweet yeah chef's kiss\nanything over seven I feel strange\nthat's good though but then don't follow\nit Seven's like don't push it I think\nthat's a big part of it too right it's\nlike my wife talks a lot about this this\nidea of being able to listen to your\nbody and I feel like so many of us are\nlike God I got to wake up at 5:30 now\ncuz Jay said he wakes up at 5:30 or I\ngot to wake up at 4: cuz Elon Musk wakes\nup at 4:00 or you know Benny said he\nwakes up at 6:10 so you know so whatever\nit is and it's like well creativity is\nnot based on those things that's just\nwhat works for your body and your mind\nis what works for my body and my mind so\nI think you know but you seem to have a\nlot of like not just Community but you\nseem to have like a lot of the same\npeople around you loyal friends like\nthat seems to be a big part of your how\nhave you continued to be able to build\nthat as you grow and make it it sounds\nlike all your friends love challenges\nand growth because a lot of people who\nlistening sometimes feel their friends\nare not wanting to grow they're not\nwanting to try new things but it's so\nfun you you do it you some people have\npushed to that and some people have\npushed me in other ways and like that's\nthe that's that's what it's all about\nyou know to me I've just had some of my\nfriends for so long because it's hard to\nfind people that are on your and I I\nthink it's harder and harder as you get\nolder you know a lot of my friends most\nof my friends I knew since I was young\nand then I have like you know like a new\nfriend for me is like five years like\nI'd be like I'd be like whoa yeah this\nis like one of my new friends like most\nof my friends are eight 10 20 you know\nand do they live in the city too or no\nall different places some of my friends\nare like some of my friends have very\nregular jobs and and you know some of\nthem I only get to see once or twice a\nyear in person because of their job you\nknow my friend was just out here he\ncomes every year for you know like a\nmonth and a half towards the end of the\nyear because he's a therapist and he\nworks you know in Virginia and he can't\nreally travel that much so then we get\nto see each other then and then you know\nmy other friend his his wife is becoming\na doctor and and they've had to have\nresidencies and all these other places\nand he works for like Capital One or\nsomething and\nhe we don't get to see each other in\nperson very often but when we do it's\nlike we saw each other yesterday you\nknow we talk all the time on on and then\nsome of my friends are in the same world\nas me so they get it some of them are in\nentertainment and I just love bringing\nmy friend group is very eclectic like\nit's like all different types of people\nand I love putting people that W\nnormally be in a room together in a room\nsee what happens what's the randomness\ntoo is it the person building rocket\nships and then your mom and then s I'm\nuh uh it's just like\npeople you know it's very common for me\nto go out to dinner and have like one\nperson be 22 and then the next person be\nlike 70 like and and that's not and and\nhaving it not be someone's mom or dad\nlike having it just be someone that's my\nfriend yeah you know and because I've\nmet so many I'm very interested in\npeople and I\nlove I love meeting creative people\nwhether that means they're creative\nprofessionally whether creative in their\nmind whether they you know I just love I\nlove that feeling of getting into a\nconversation with someone yeah I also\nthink multigenerational friendships are\nso powerful like I was talking to\nsomeone about that like me and my wife\nhave uh a couple friend of ours and\nthey're in their late 60s and they're\nsome of our favorite people that hang\nout with like I feel like I learn so\nmuch I grow so much I gain so much\nperspective they've lived 30 years more\nlife than I have like and I think that's\nit's so interesting how we may spend\ntime with our parents but we're not\nnecessarily having friends that are in a\ndifferent decade of their life but how\npowerful it can be to be with someone a\nlot of people don't even know their\nparents like that like even if you're\nlike close with your parents like like\nhow close are you with your mom I'm\npretty close to my mom yeah okay but\nlike you don't know there's so many\nthings you don't know about her like you\ndon't know like like how she felt the\nfirst time she got her heartbroken you\ndon't know like if she ever cheated on\nsomeone like you don't like sometimes I\nfor me I'll sit my mom down and I just\nask her like every I'm like what drugs\nhave you taken and I'm like how did it\nmake you feel because my parents got\ndivorced I was like how did you know you\nwanted to get divorced what did you feel\nand I and I always I tried to do that\nbecause one of my friends started\nrecording his dad when his dad got sick\nand he asked him every question he ever\nwanted to ask him because it is so crazy\nyou're so close to this person that you\nreally don't know like you really like\nwe really don't even know our parents\nthat well because you don't you don't\nask them those type of things and no one\ndoes like and it it's also that time\nwhere I remember like your parents\ngospel is just like the end all be all\nwhen you're a kid and then all of a\nsudden you're like 15 or 16 you're like\nwait\nyou're just a human that was a mess up\non you you just lied like I caught you\nin that lie but like until you're like\n15 or 16 or something you can't even\nfathom that and then like you realize\nit's cool I'm so thankful that I get to\nlike you know talk to my parents and my\nfamily now like as an adult and be like\nyo what were you feeling like like when\nyou went through this and like how did\nyou raise us like that and is it so hard\nto do this and it's cool I I like that\nfeeling yeah I I did something similar a\nfew years ago I felt that way with the\npodcast where I was like learning about\npeople I'd never met and so we were\ncelebrating my sister's 30th birthday so\nit was me my mom and my sister my\nyounger sister and I just started\ninterviewing my mom at dinner and there\nwas no we didn't record it it was just\nus three and I learned so much so my mom\nwas studying for her exams while cuz she\nwas born and raised in Yemen while there\nwere yemeni soldiers fighting British\nsoldiers on her roof like you know and I\nwas like I had no idea and she just\ncasually drops that as if it's like\nnormal and I'm like Mom you realize\nthat's not normal you should interview\nyour M you need to interview I've been\nthinking about it it's been it's been on\nmy mind interviewing your family is so\ncrazy yeah cuz you're right and I think\neveryone I would love to do it because I\nwant everyone to do it my wife was my\nfirst ever guest on the show really yeah\nyeah because that was a big part of it\nfor me it was like I feel like you're so\nright we don't really deeply know our\nfamily when we think we know them yeah\nwe think we know them we assume that we\nknow them yeah I used to do this thing\non my uh well I still do it on all of my\nalbums where like the last song on my\nalbum has like a a a spoken word section\nof it's like over instrumental of um\neach person in my family and so far I\ndid my mom and my dad and I ask them all\nthese questions and it's crazy to know\nthe because I basically I asked them\nquestion for like an hour and then I\ntake like the best like 30 seconds and\nit was both my\nparents wound up talking the most about\nlike their divorce and it was like so\ninteresting to see both sides of it\nbecause I have now forever in time I\nhave my mom's version and my dad's\nversion and then like I just you know\nI'm putting out a new album and I\ninterview my brother for his version of\nit now and it's like uh that's beautiful\nman that's really special it's fun and\nit's like you know it's emotional and\nit's like w it's cool to hear both sides\nof everyone's side of an event what did\nyou yeah I I think you're so right\nbecause yeah we often think there's only\none truth and one story and then all of\na sudden there's three and what was the\nbiggest thing you learned from hearing\nyour Mom and Dad's version of divorce\nlike what was something that surprised\nyou or something you were like wow I did\nnot recognize that when I was growing up\nI think that it\nmade them both better people together\nget out of the relationship and I think\nlike uh at first it seemed like my\nparents were not fans of each other at\nfirst it was like crazy but now they're\nfriends I mean they haven't been married\nfor you know 20 something years but uh\nbut yeah now now we all like go to\ndinner together and like go on vacation\num but you know it wasn't always that\nway and it's it's cool to see like where\nit started to where it is now and I do\nthink like me and my brother like were a\nbig uh like our success was like a big\nCatalyst on getting like everyone\ntogether because it forced us to get\ntogether and then it no it's cool I\ndon't know yo life is so crazy like the\nway you know the way you meet people and\nthe way people come in and out of your\nlife and someone you may not even like\nreally know could become like your wife\nor someone like that's like you despise\ncould become your best friend and it's\njust it's very interesting how how life\nplays out and I find that more and more\nas I get older and my mom always used to\nbe like she'd be like you know when you\nget older you're gonna and I used to be\nlike what are you talk and but it's so\ntrue just like over and over again I'm\nlearning something new every day yeah\nyeah so true man Benny I could talk to\nyou for hours genuinely like we could go\non and on and on but I wanted to make\nsure is there anything that we haven't\ntalked about before we we go to the\nfinal five which is the way we end in\ninterviews is anything we haven't talked\nabout that you really wanted to touch on\nthat's on your heart or mind or\nsomething that what's your five thing\nwhat's that you that yeah we can do that\nwe'll start with that it's a final five\nthat we end every interview with of all\ntime it's the same question it's the\nsame well same four questions one of\nthem I usually play with same three or\nfour questions and one of them I usually\nplay with for the person and uh these\nare your final five they have to be\nanswered in one word to one sentence\nmaximum oh my God yeah and then I may\nask you to go on because I usually break\nmy rule but here we go all right Benny\nblco these are your final five so the\nfirst question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever heard or received\ndon't be afraid to fail who told you it\nand how have you practiced it I can't\nremember who told me it but I someone\ndid tell you it it wasn't something that\nno no no somebody told me it but I will\ntell you\nthis I always say this to someone\nbecause people come up to me all the\ntime and they're just like oh man you\ndon't miss you did this you did that and\nand I I I'll talk to someone you know\none of my friends was going through a\nhard time recently it was like his first\nfailures and I remember talking to him\nand I said I said you don't think I've\nfailed a million times I\nsaid you look at someone like Michael\nJordan okay he's taking like so many\nshots he's missed so many shots do you\nremember any of those no you remember\nhim swishing it and walking back with\nhis tongue out nobody's sitting there\nbeing like uh Jay I saw that you know\nback in like 2008 that rap career didn't\nreally work out for you no they're like\nJay wow every get you got Michelle Obama\non you so I always tell people like it\ndoesn't it doesn't matter don't be\nafraid to fail nobody's even going to\nremember it there only and if someone's\nliterally tallying your failures they're\npsycho you know well said man yeah no\none remembers the misses no one\nremembers the misses if you keep going\nbut if you stop at the miss you got to\nkeep going you got to keep going uh\nquestion number two what is the worst\nadvice you've ever heard or received I\nwas going around playing my music for\npeople and I just switched my style up\nbecause I used to make I like originally\nmade music that sounded like I was\ncopying timolin sounded like I was\ncopying Fel sounded like I was trying to\nbe someone else and I remember I I I had\njust made music that didn't sound like\nanything it sounded so weird it was so\ndifferent wasn't like what was going on\nI remember I went into a meeting and\nsomeone was like nobody makes music like\nthis they're like you gotta you got to\nfit in more like and that just like made\nme go the opposite way then I was like\nnow I know I got to do the crazy stuff\nbecause at least I just want someone\nwhen I used to go in and play music for\nthem to be like I've never heard\nanything like this like this is so weird\nthis is not going to work because that's\nwhen Everyone likes something usually\nthat means it's not going to work you\nknow when when some people are unsure\nabout something that's when it's usually\ngoing to work so I I don't know someone\ntold me to fit in more and I didn't\nreally Vibe with that that's that's a\ngreat answer I think it's so interesting\nwhen you're young everyone tells you to\nfit in and when you get older everyone\nsays stand out and it's like well wait a\nminute I had to wear uniform I had to\ncoming on time and now all of a sudden\nI've got to find who I am yeah and it's\nsuch a contradiction of course yeah\ngreat answer all right uh question\nnumber three what's something that you\nused to value that you no longer\nvalue\nsuccess I used to really care\nabout getting that number one song\ngetting that thing and I feel like I I\nfeel like I did everything I wanted to\ndo like and now I feel like everything's\nlike the cherry on top of the Sunday now\nso I'm just having so much fun trying\nnew things and of course I want them to\nbe successful and stuff but like I don't\nhave I and I and I do still like work\nand have a drive and want to do it but I\nwant to do it more for me and less for\nlike other people I used to want to do\nit because I was like I have to be\nnumber one I have to be the best in the\nworld I have to be this I and now I just\nget to wake up and I'm like okay I\nalready did the things I want to do so\nlike I want to make a cookbook I want to\ndo it I want to do this and I like\nreally want it to be the best and I want\nit to be awesome but it's something that\nI want to do and I'm putting like that\npressure on myself it's not like for\nother people anymore\nand yeah I\nthink I don't know it's I and and I\nalways had a strange feeling with\nsuccess too I was always like kind of\nlike ashamed of it for some reason or\nI'd be like oh I don't I don't I don't\ndeserve that I'm probably going to get\nlike cancer now because like I did\nbecause I did well so like I don't\ndeserve this and like somebody else\nsomebody else deserves this more and\nlike how did you overcome that doubt\nbecause I think a lot of people feel\nthat way uh people comeing to money Fame\neven a bit of success and we start going\noh crap this wasn't meant to be like\nyeah it's still I still it's still there\nfor me that that part I still have that\nfeeling a little bit a little bit of the\nimpostor syndrome but it's so funny CU\nI'm so confident at the same time but\nyou know sometimes I do have that\nfeeling where I'm just like ah like why\ndo I deserve this like what did I do and\nlike there's so many more people who are\nmore talented and I'll like start\nquestioning stuff like that in my head\nyeah and and you're still working\nthrough that still yeah every day we're\nworking through everything and the\nsuccess thing like it's not fully let go\nbut it's like it's something that like I\ncatch myself more and more like just\nreally wanting to do the things because\nlike it's not a competition always\nanymore and it used to be like such a\ncompetition with me in my head yeah with\nthat and I try to find like other things\nthat are competitions and like\ncompetitions like that are like friendly\nand there's not like a huge thing at the\nend of the tunnel for it beautiful\nquestion number four what's something\nthat you think you learned from your\nparents relationship that affects your\nrelationships moving forward it's like\nsomething that you'll take as a lesson\non what to do or what not to do I don't\nthink my parents listen to each other\nand I think all relationships whether\nit's romantic business\nfriendships you have to you just have to\nlisten to each other it's like the\neasiest thing in the world just be a\nlistener and it's okay to be wrong I\nI like that's that's also another thing\nthat like I've really come to terms with\nlike it's like I\nalways would find myself like wanting to\nbe right about the thing wanting to be\nthis\nand it almost makes you look better if\nyou're like you know what I was I I was\nwrong and stop trying to like offend a\nthing to the end that you know you're\nwrong about so it's like I I I was wrong\nI was wrong and then like everyone's\nhappy if you just say if you're like I\nwas wrong I messed up I messed up\ninstead of like trying it's like putting\nshame around being wrong and it's okay\nto be wrong like it's okay to [ __ ] up\nsometimes like you know I think that's\ngreat listen and it's okay to be wrong\nyeah it's okay to be right uh Fifth and\nfinal question Benny we ask this to\nevery guest who's ever been on the show\nif you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be you know I just I wish\nthere was a world where\njust everyone could find a way to just\nlike fit in and just like not be it's\nokay to get upset sometimes I just wish\npeople could talk things out and and\nfind a way to like love each other and\nfind I don't know find a way to like\nlive together you know it just like\nkills me like anytime it's so hard for\nme to ever watch any of the news and\nit's just like oh I'm like it just like\ncrushes me watching people fight and\npeople like violence and it's like crazy\nlike I don't understand I just like\ndon't even un I don't know\npeople you know to like for someone to\ndo something so bad to like an innocent\nper like anytime I see things like that\nI just don't understand and I you know I\nin my ideal world there's I don't even\nknow if it's a law I don't people just\nbe nice to\nand just be like caring and considerate\nand understand that it's okay to not be\nthe same as somebody else and it's okay\nto not have the exact same opinion as\nsomebody else but you guys can coexist\nand live and just like I I I don't know\nit's like I always have these like\nidealistic thoughts in my head and it's\nvery hard to create those because we're\nso far gone as a planet you know there's\nlike so much greed and there's so much I\ndon't know I've always been like just\nlike happy whether it was like I had a\nlot of money or no money and I've always\nfound that when me and my friends listen\nto each other and work together and talk\nthings out like every like nothing can\ngo wrong and if it can go if it does go\nwrong then you talk about it and you\nmake it better and I don't know what's\nthe best law you heard someone say oh\nthat's a good question um I I think a\nlot of people shared the sentiment that\nyou're saying like I think a lot of us\nfeel like that like we want to live in a\nmore just happier loving kind the world\nI think two that stand out to me uh\nDaniel Kya came on he's the guy you know\nyeah so Daniel came on and he said that\nfor everyone that you judged or\ncriticized the law would be that you'd\nhave to then whoever you judge and\ncriticize you'd have to go live as them\nfor a day or a year or something like\nthat oh I like that something it was\nlike a it was like a fixed thing and\nthen Trevor Noah had one his one was um\nthere'd be a rule that every day\nsomeone's bank balance in the planet\ncould go to zero so it could be you your\nfriend your family member and how\ndifferently you'd behave with people\nknowing that that could be you one day\ncould be your mom it could be your dad\nit could be your friend and that way\nyou'd be more conscious of what it would\nfeel like to be around people who don't\nhave a law yeah I changed mine uh free\nweed for everyone\nthat's yeah yeah yeah that's my that's\nmy new one um no that's great that's a\ngood one those are is is Weeden unlock\nunlock your creativity does it make you\nanxious as you were mentioning for other\npeople earlier I love smoking weed you\nyou are you allowed to no you're not I\ndon't I don't you don't you don't do\nanything that I'm not allowed to you\ndon't do anything you ever have a sip of\nalcohol no not anymore when did you quit\nuh when you were a monk 15 years ago\nyeah 15 16 years what what what's your\nwhat do you do what's your Wild Thing uh\nmy wild thing is St I know no I'm just\nkidding no what is it I'm a super I I\nguess my wildness come I'm super\ncompetitive so if I'm playing a sport\nthat I'm good at no come on give me like\nwhat's your Vice my vice is sugar man\nit's like it's taking me forever yeah\nliterally I'm like yeah my vice is sugar\nmy vice is I like to work hard my vice\nis so but you don't have anything so you\ndon't have it's not that I don't have\nanything I've worked on it hard for\nyears and years so no drinking no weed\nno psychedelics no no I I I'd be i' be I\nsaw I saw your eye glimmer a little I'm\nalways open to exploring anything that\nwould I I mean weed was something that I\ndid a lot in my teens so it's not\nsomething I've never done I want to know\nthe teen you the teen you was wild yeah\nthe teen was wild I think that's what it\nis like growing up in London too like\nyou start drinking very early you start\nplaying around with drugs and stuff very\nearly and so we just had access to a lot\nof things so I feel like it's not that I\ndon't it's that I've done a lot in my\nteens course and so it's not that I have\na again and I've have nothing against it\nI think I'm always open to things that\nhave medicinal or healing benefits so\nI've always been open a lot of my Cent c\nwill do MDMA do iboga do iasa like and\nso I'm very familiar with these things\nand I'm always working alongside uh NE\nclinical neuroscientist that I take\nadvice from for my clients and clients\nown exploration so I'm very aware and\nlike to be educated more and get more\nexperience but I would do it if I felt\nthere was healing that that could reward\nme with for sure I'm very open at\nanything that has healing powers you\ntake any supplements I take a lot of I\ntake 20 supplements a day all right\nlet's tell me\nyeah so I'm taking I'll show you my draw\nlater it's like literally 20 tablets a\nday but it's like B12 magnesium d c uh\nk um\nprobiotics uh gut supplements creatine\nlike a million why you take them all\nbecause I I really do feel a difference\nI why did you take creatine that's like\nfrom the 80s yeah but it works it's like\nso what's really interesting is that I\nwork with we've had the doctor that I\nwork with on the show is is Dr sha he\nruns next Health okay and next Health\nbasically will do the deepest blood\ntests and give you like oh yeah you do\nthat thing where you have like a bowl of\npills you got to take like a packet\nevery day you get all your biomarkers so\nyou get everything and what I found is\nthat different body types can't digest\ncertain things like my body can't get\nthe nutrients from certain things so I\nhave to eat different proteins I'm also\nplant-based so the supplements provide\nme with all the missing nutrients so\nwere you feeling bad before you did this\nI was feeling\nwhen I wasn't taking all the supplements\nI was feeling more tired more easily oh\nand I was like why am I tired because I\nwork out I sleep well I meditate like I\nwhy am I tired what type of tired uh\njust like a feeling of like leagy or\nfatigue at the end of the day but like a\ntired that I didn't like and I realized\nthat so vitamin D is meant to be at 60\nyears safe 100 is ideal I was at 10 and\nif and people always say but you live in\nLA you get enough vitamin D it's not\ntrue like you've got to be out in the\nsun naked like for 4 hours a day to get\nenough vitamin D especially with my\ncolor of skin and so for me to take\nvitamin D is non-negotiable and for most\npeople are low in vitamin D and so my\ndoctors my nutrition was saying Jay your\nvitamin D levels means you should be\ndepressed I was like I don't feel\ndepressed I'm just tired and she was\njust like well you know if you change\nthat will make a massive difference and\nit did wow and so I think a lot of\npeople a lot of the times we think we're\nstruggling mentally but a lot it's\nchemical and biological and physical\nwhat you're saying with working out\nright like it's a physical shift that's\nchanged your mindset and we can get in\nour head and get oh God why am I tired\nthere's something wrong with me like\nmaybe I'm stressed and it can be that of\ncourse it can be that but sometimes it's\nchemical and physical so so you take 20\nsupplements a day I'll show you yeah\nI'll show you my little pill drawer what\ndo you do any other things no no that's\nit do you drink any other tinctures\nthrough the day that you have to no no\nwell creatine is I have to mix it in and\nthen but why do they have you do\ncreatine that's for me to digest a\nparticular nutrient for for my digestion\nto be good I also take um oh do you have\ntrouble you have bad stomach not a bad\nstomach I think that when I went\ncompletely plant-based which I always\ntold people if they're making that\ntransition I always tell people to do it\nslowly I kind of did it overnight when\num eight years ago when I married my\nwife I was vegetarian but I became\nplant-based as soon as I married her and\nI think that my gut reacted poorly to\nthat quick transition and so whenever\nanyone's talking about being plant-based\nor eating healthier was like do it\nslowly because your body's just used to\na habit whether it's good or bad and now\nI feel great but it it was a\ntransitionary period for sure so I do\nthat and then I do I I have um vinegar\nbefore meals because that regulates the\nacid internally so that's like mix shut\nof vinegar with diluted in water do you\ntake like a lot of protein a day yeah I\ntake a lot of protein but a lot of\nprotein meals but like natural natural\nforms of um as much as I can well what's\nyour natural protein well like I'm doing\na lot of lentils and dolls like the\nIndian the Indian diet generally leads\nwell to that kind of stuff and then I\nwill do things like tofu which of course\nyou know and then not so natural not so\nnatural forms of protein as well
