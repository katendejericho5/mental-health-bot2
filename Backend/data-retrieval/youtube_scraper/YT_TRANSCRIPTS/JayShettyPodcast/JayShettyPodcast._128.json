available\nas we speak please welcome to the show\nthe author of worthy Jamie klma Jamie\nthank you for being here Jay thank you\nso much for having me I am excited this\nis going to be an amazing episode I know\nI just want to tell people just so you\nknow Jamie arrived an hour ago and we've\nspent an hour just chatting and hanging\nout and I love it because I always love\nspending time with you we became friends\nto a mutual friend Brenan bashad a few\nyears ago and I've always loved\nconnecting with you learning from you\nhearing about how you have these Divine\ndownloads as you call them and how you\nchannel in your work and I remember when\nyou actually told me when you were\ndivinely downloading this book yes and I\nwanted to start off by there's so many\nthings I want to talk about in the book\nbut but the thing that's calling me to\nstart with\nis do you feel worthy today our\nselfworth is our ceiling in every area\nof life and Jay I have to tell you um\nfor the longest time in my life like I\nbelieve this why that if I achieve\nenough I will finally feel enough and\nright now I can tell you I feel more\nworthy than I ever have but it is a\ndaily it is a daily practice it's a\ndaily intention and for anyone who is\nwith us right now listening watching um\nwho's ever had a goal like a big goal or\na dream and they thought you know once I\nfinally get that thing then I'm going to\nfeel enough and happy and fulfilled and\nthen you get that thing and maybe you\nworked for like a week or a month or\nseveral years and then you get it and\nyou're like happy for a while but you're\nlike why do I still feel like\nsomething's missing or like I'm not\nenough and that was me most of my entire\nlife and usually when that happens we\nthink oh I've just got to work harder\nI've just got to level up and hustle\nmore and get the next thing and the next\nthing and so I spent oh my gosh Decades\nof My Life um kind of as an achiever but\ndeep down inside not feeling like I was\nenough yet I thought I would solve that\nby doing all these things on the outside\nthat the world told me makes you enough\nand what's Wild is even after not to\nlike jump way ahead but um even after\nachieving some of these things that the\ndays I was a Denny's waitress I could\nnot have imagine selling my company for\na $1.2 billion dollar cash right or\nbecoming the first SE o of you know a\nbrand in L'Oreal's history any of those\nthings I couldn't have imagined those\nhappening and yet I found myself in a\nmoment in my life where I was achieving\nall of these things and still feeling\nlike I wasn't enough and here's the\nthing what I learned the hard way is\nwhen we achieve all these things we\nbuild a lot of self-confidence which is\nreally important but none of them build\nselfworth which is different and I when\nwe have a lot of confidence when we're\nrushing it on the outside but deep down\ninside we don't feel like we're enough\nit will show up in our lives and it may\nnot show up in our career it might show\nup in our relationships it might not\nshow up in you know different areas and\nI found myself um at this in this moment\nin time where I was so confident and all\nthese things were going right and IID\nput Decades of hard work and I still\ndidn't feel like I was enough and I was\nstill sabotaging things in my life and\nuh it was really only 3 years ago where\num there was a big moment that happened\nin my life with Oprah actually where I\nrealized oh my gosh I am so confident\nbut I actually I've a lot of\nself-confidence but I actually don't\nhave a lot of selfworth and they're very\ndifferent and you know our self-worth is\nour cealing and and it's why you know\neven if we arrive at that goal whether\nit's like a career thing or getting\nmarried and having kids or finally\ngetting a six-pack abs or you know\nwhatever the things we you still take\nyou with you which is why you still\narrive there and you're like why do I\nstill feel like I'm not enough and as\nyou and I are talking 80% of women don't\nbelieve they're enough 73% of men feel\ninadequate and not enough right and then\nyou look at other areas of life 75% of\nof uh women deal with impostor syndrome\nmore than 50% of men deal with it when\nwe believe we are not enough as we are a\nit is a lie it is a lie but impacts\nalmost every area of our life so uh a\nbig reason why I wrote Worthy is because\nI realized oh my goodness like in life\nwe don't become what we want we become\nwhat we believe we're worthy of and that\nis the thing our selfworth is our\nceiling and so it's really a book about\nyou know believe it my first book was my\nstory of learning to believe in myself\nand Worthy is really like a Playbook\nlike how do you believe in you it's\npacked with over 20 tools on it um on\nbuilding selfworth and it's just the one\nthing because it's the identity level\nlike our\nself-confidence is is really important\nbut it's it's an internal trait but it's\nbased so much on the external on like\nour willingness to try and go for it you\nknow how we feel we Stack Up and compare\nto others and how much of the world's\ndefinition of success we have if we're\nwinning or losing uh and they show you\nknow studies show the boxer who wins the\nfight is automatically 30% more\nconfident our confidence is really\nimportant it's an important part of our\nlife but it's fragile it fluctuates you\nknow our self-worth is different it's\nthat deep internal knowing and belief\nthat we are worthy of love and belonging\nexactly as we are not as our past\nmistakes or failures or regrets not as\nour future successes but like innately\nand exactly as we are and a lot of\npeople worry well if I believed I was\nenough as I am will I lose my ambition\nwill I lose my Edge and it's like oh no\nyou don't you actually become more\nambitious because when you learn to\nbelieve you are enough exactly as you\nare you you become Fearless about going\nfor things because you know even if you\nfail or fall flat on your face or you're\nembarrassed or it doesn't go well like\nthat might shake your confidence but it\ncannot touch your selfworth because your\nself-worth is your ident it's your\nfoundation it's almost like our\nself-confidence is the house with all\nthe rooms and the art and the that we're\nbuilding in our life which is so\nimportant but our selfworth is the\nfoundation under it and our house is\nonly ever as stable and secure as that\nfoundation so uh yeah I have been been\nobsessed with selfworth with building it\nit is just the the one thing that that\nchanges everything um and it for most of\nus like we can go into this if you want\nbut there's like three main areas that\nshows up in our life when when we're\nstruggling with it so um but I'm really\npassionate about it yeah I love it I\nlove the distinction you made between\nconfidence and selfworth yeah because I\nthink we often get those two confused so\noften and we feel if I'm confident then\nnothing else matters and we're chasing\nconfidence and you shared some of these\njust now but when I read this it really\nhit me and it's on the first page of the\nbook so you can't miss it but I'm just\ngoing to share this if you don't mind\nbecause I looked at these stats and it\njust was like a punch in the gut when I\nread it because I was like this really\nhit me so listen to this this is reading\nfrom worthy by Jamie Ken Lima page one\nit says for the 80% of women who don't\nbelieve they're enough the 75% of female\nExecutives who deal with impostor\nsyndrome and the 91% of girls and women\nwho don't love their bodies for the 73%\nof men who feel inadequate and the 100%\nof men who come from a woman and likely\nhave at least one girl or woman in their\nlives whom they care about when you\nbelieve you're fundamentally not not\nenough and unworthy as a person it's a\nlie the time to unlearn that lie has\ncome together let's leave no girl no\nwoman no person left behind in knowing\nthey are worthy oh wow like when I read\nthat I was\nlike those stats just put it into\nperspective because I think we often\nthink of feeling worthy or self-worth is\nkind of like this soft thing right and\nall of a sudden you read the statistics\non it and you think\nbut wait a minute we're all dealing with\nthis like in some way in some area of\nour life and exactly what you said we\nand me my most of my whole life I\nthought self-confidence and self worth\nwere the same thing so when we're\nstruggling with not feeling enough and\nmaybe so many people listening to us\nright now have you know all of the stuff\non the outside that everyone tells you\nshould make you feel enough and it's\nbecause we're all confusing we think we\njust need more self-confidence but what\nwe really need is more selfworth and\nthey're so different but we try to solve\nour feelings of not enoughness with\nthings that just build self-confidence\nbut none of them build selfworth and\nthey're so different like so many people\nthink they need more self-confidence\nwhich is important but it's so so so\ndifferent and for selfworth if someone's\nlistening to to us right now they're\nlike oh wait a minute is this why I\ndon't feel fulfilled or is this why I\nfeel like it's never I'm never enough\nfor for selfworth\num I'm just getting so fired up I want\nto jump out of your chair but it shows\nup for so many of us like you look at\nthose numbers it's like oh my gosh three\nthree ways it shows up so so if we have\nlow selfworth right and again you can be\ncrushing it on the outside and you can\nbe hiding this really well but if you\nhave low self- worth for a lot of us it\nlooks like we're stuck and we don't know\nwhy we're stuck and we don't know why\nand and we tell ourselves like for\nexample maybe we know we want to write a\nbook or we want to share our ideas at\nwork or we want to put our art out into\nthe world or we want to find a life\npartner and and and but we're not\nputting ourselves on the dating app or\nwe're not like going out and socializing\nor we're not sh raising our hand and\nsharing our idea on the zoom call or we\nhaven't written the first word of our\nbook and we tell ourselves stories like\noh I just need more experience or I need\nto get more skill sets or all these\nreasons why we're stuck and they may be\ntrue but what a lot of us don't realize\nis the reason we're stuck is because\ndeep down inside we actually don't\nbelieve we're worthy of the thing and\nthat will keep you stuck all day long\nand not knowing why because again your\nself-worth is your ceiling right and we\ndon't soar to the level of our goals and\ndreams we stay stuck at the level of our\nselfworth every time and uh that's\nreally how low self-worth uh often shows\nup and then when you have a low to\nmedium self worth what that looks like\nmaybe a lot of people listening can\nidentify with this it looks like you'll\ngo for the thing like you'll put\nyourself out there but then you'll\neither hit a ceiling a plateau and\nyou're trying for a breakthrough and you\ndon't know why like maybe you want to\ngrow your follower account you want to\ngrow your business to six figures but\nyou're hitting a ceiling at five figures\nand you don't know why you can't break\npast it or or you'll go for it but\nyou'll sabotage it right you'll go for\nit and you'll sabotage it along the way\nyou'll meet a potential partner and\nyou'll be like there amazing and then\nyou somehow are attracted to them and\nyou put them in the friend zone or\nyou'll you'll write the book and then\nyou won't send it out like you'll go for\nthe thing but you'll stab Because deep\ndown inside you don't believe you're\nworthy of it and the third most common\nway and this is for people who are\nambitious or Achievers this is very very\ncommon uh this is me a lot of my life\nyou'll go for the thing and you'll\nactually make it happen you'll actually\nachieve it you'll actually and but you\narrive at it still feeling like\nsomething's missing still feeling like\nit's not enough still feeling like\nyou're not enough and so you feel\nunfulfilled and then you think I've just\ngot to achieve more and more and more\nand more and more and the most beautiful\npart about building selfworth is that\nyou realize okay I am which this is the\ntruth Jay every single person listening\nto us right now this is the most\nbeautiful part every one of us I do not\ncare your past mistakes your past\nfailures what you think you got wrong\nwho you think you hurt that you wish you\ndidn't the any of that I don't and I\ndon't care how much success you have it\nnone of that matters every person right\nnow is fully fully worthy exactly as you\nare and this journey isn't about\nlearning some stuff you got to do to be\nwor this is about unlearning the lies\nthat lead to\nself-doubt and then igniting those\ntruths that that wake up words in us and\nthat is the part I'm most excited about\nwhy I'm jumping out of my chair because\nwhen I think about everybody listening\nwhen I think about everyone listening\nand watching you and I right now the\nmoment you learn to believe you are\nworthy oh my gosh like that is the\nmoment where it feel it feels like\nBreakthrough it feels like Joy it tastes\nlike Freedom it's the moment when\nunhealthy relationships end it's the\nmoment when you put your dreams and\nideas out there no matter how they are\nreceived it's the moment you share your\nideas it's the moment businesses are\nlaunched and I just yeah I'm so\npassionate about this because and I talk\nabout this and worthy a lot that like\nyou know we don't in life in life in our\nrelationships in in in in our\nfriendships in our hopes and dreams that\nthat we don't rise to what we believe is\npossible right and it's hard to believe\nthings are possible but even then we\ndon't rise to what we believe is\npossible we still Fall To What We\nbelieve we're worthy of it is that one\nthing at an identity level that we will\nalways return to and and building it is\neverything so yeah have you ever had a\nguest jump out of your chair before\nyou're the first you're like a rocket so\npassionate about this no it comes across\nand and I'm glad that you raised that\nbecause what I wanted to do with you\nwhich I think would be really important\nwhich was what resonated so strongly\nwith me about your book was these lies\nlike as I sat here and I read through\nthe lies I was just like I've told\nmyself that one I've told myself that\none I've told myself that one I've told\nmyself that one and I think our\ncommunity who's listening to on purpose\nright now or watching will definitely\nfeel like these lies are relatable so\nI'd love to dive into some of them that\nreally stick out to me and I love that\nyou've made it about unlearning lies\nrather than building selfworth because\nit almost feels so hard to be like well\nhow do I build my selfworth but when you\nrecognize that actually we're trying to\nextract and excavate through all of\nthese lies it makes a lot of sense so\nlet's start with I want to start and\nwe're not going to go through all of\nthem because I want you guys to read the\nbook but I'm going to pick out a couple\nthat I that really resonated with me the\nfirst one that really resonated with me\nwas of course don't wait on your weight\nthe LIE my weight impacts my worth this\nhas been conditioned deeply into society\nand into culture that their weight\nimpacts their worth everyone even if\nthey don't say it subconsciously feels\nit in some way or another there's\ncomparison\nthere's Envy there's images that are put\nin front of you about what you should be\naiming for and what you should be walk\nus through that personally and then how\nwe unlearn that yes the lie your weight\ndetermines your worth has cost so many\nof us like so much in our life believing\nthat lie and I talk a lot about this\nidea of don't wait on your weight to\nlive your best life\nand this is a whole chapter um in where\nthe like you like you said I go into all\nthese lies and how do you unlearn them\nand this chapter is not about your\nweight it's about that if you've been\nwaiting on your weight to live your best\nlife um or by the way the weight of\nexpectations other people's expectations\nor your own what weight are you you know\nletting hold you down so this idea that\nyour weight determines your worth is a\nlie and it is a lie that is impacting so\nmany of us right now as we speak\n89%\n89% of girls and women will opt out of\nmeaningful activities including\ninteracting with friends or loved ones\nwhen they don't like how they look and\nJay most of my life I believe this lie\neven even when I was crushing it by all\nother measures I still even even when I\nbuilt a company that was inspiring and\ndoes inspire millions and millions and\nmillions of people to embrace who they\nare I was still believing this lie that\nmy weight determined my worth and I was\nstill waiting on my weight for that and\nuh the big way to overcome this lie\nbecause first of all it is a lie second\nof all for anyone who has hit fitness\ngoals or hit weight goal they know you\nstill arrive at that goal and you still\ndon't feel enough it does not M it does\nnot change who you are right because\nbecause it is an external thing that can\nfluctuate confidence but it is it does\nnot impact your worth that's the first\nthing no matter what your weight is or\nisn't it does it is irrelevant to your\nselfworth and understanding that's\nreally really important but then how to\nbreak free of this lie is to flip it on\nits head which is what happened to me in\nmy life and as human beings as you know\nwe're wired to avoid pain at all costs\nand we think oh if I you know we're\nwaiting on our weight to to live our\nbest lives and we think oh because I'm\nnot what I think I need to look like I'm\ngoing to skip out on the event I'm not\ngoing to go to the party I'm not going\nto apply for the job I'm not going to\napply for the job I'm not going to put\nmyself out in the dating World until I'm\nthis or that I'm going to stand in the\nback of the photo right I'm not going to\nlive my best life and uh because I think\nI attach pain to that I attach the pain\nof oh I might be judged if I go out in a\nswimsuit oh I might get disapproval I\nmight be all of these things and so we\nhide when you flip this around this is\nfor everyone listening right now and\nthis impacts men in a huge way too uh as\nwell as women but the numbers are just\nstaggering but when you flip it around\nand go well wait a minute what has\nwaiting on my weight already cost me in\nmy\nlife that that pain pain of the regret\nwhen we flip it around and think of it\nthat way that pain is far more painful\nthan well what happens if I'm judged at\na party and in my life I spent decades\nlike telling myself oh nothing fits I\nI'm just not going to go I'm just going\nto miss out on this and it was having my\ndaughter uh and I remember this moment\nJay I was at a public Hotel lots of\npeople there people I knew were there\nand my daughter was 1 years old and and\ngoing to go swimming for the first time\nand I was literally on the side of the\npool I look so cute but I was covered up\ncovered up in a had a swimsuit but I was\ncovered up covered up covered up\nsunglasses all the things and I was like\nI'm just going to watch my husband take\nher and swim and I had this moment where\nI'm like I know why I'm going to sit\nhere and watch I'm about to miss out on\nthe first moment my daughter's going to\nswim because I am still waiting on my\nweight till to live my best life and\nwhen I looked at like what has this\nalready cost me the memories The Joy the\nall of it right and I also realized me\ndoing this is actually me telling her\nshe is not worthy of her of her body\nright and I'm like the pain of that is\nfar more and that was the moment I\nliterally took my cover up off I walked\nover to the pool in front of everyone I\nshook my cell with joy like jiggled my\ncellulite with joy j shete and I got\nright in the pool I swam with my\ndaughter wonder and I'm like I'm done I\nam done waiting on my weight and here's\nthe thing y'all first of all no one\ncares you know what I mean about even\neven people that are really high profile\nthat PE at the end of the day it it\ncannot impact your worth and to unlearn\nthis lie the most important thing first\nof all is to realize it has been a\nimpacting you and then to go wow okay\nlet me really understand the difference\nbetween self-worth and self-confidence\nand understanding the difference and\nthen understanding okay this Li is\nimpacting my self-confidence it doesn't\ntouch my worth but it is impacting my\nself-confidence now how do I unlearn it\nthere how do I unlearn it and this is\nhow you unlearn it and I go deep into\nhow to do this in the book Because when\nwe can reframe a lie and believe and not\nonly associate more pain with believing\nit than with just going for it that's\nwhen as human beings will go for it no I\nthink that question that you asked is\nhuge that question of what has it cost\nme yes and to think that you could have\nnever had that experience with your\ndaughter who is adorable but like to\nhave that moment with her do you\nremember do you remember I'm going to\nshare this moment with you so we were at\nan airport together and my daughter the\nfirst time she met Jay she walks up to\nyou and she calls you Dad yeah she's\nadorable as well so I was like I'll take\nit I'll take it she's so cute and she's\nso she's really shy and she just walks\nright up to you and calls you Dad I'm\nlike what's happening right now so funny\nI love it remember my husband Paulo\ncomes on like PA I promise you don't\nworry\nlike funny so cute and it's like to\nthink I love that question because I\nthink it's really practical for everyone\nlistening and watching right now to ask\nyourself what does it already cost you\nand what is it going to cost you that\nmemory with your child that potential\njob that fulfills your dream that great\nmemory with friends that whatever it may\nbe like we're all missing out on\nsomething because of that and that is\nsuch a great just that one question just\nthat question is a great way to and I\nknow we're going to dive into some of\nthe lies this whole book when when when\noh my gosh Jay this is the thing when\nyou ask yourself what is self-doubt\nalready cost you in your life right and\nthen you look at it from that\nperspective and a lot of us we spend so\nmuch time building skill sets and this\nand and those are important you know you\nknow you know I was talking about it's\nimportant to put in the Reps and get the\nexperience and all the things but also\nlearning how to uh unlearn the lies that\nlead to self-doubt oh my gosh because\nagain our selfworth is our ceiling and\nso just it's so powerful yeah and we've\nhad that doubting voice whether it's\ncome through teachers family members\nwhether it's come through your friend at\nschool whatever it was we've all adopted\ndoubting voices over time yes now we\nreplayed them to ourselves in our own\nvoice and we think they're us when in\nfact they've just been conditioned and\ntrained yes and self-doubt will kill\nmore dreams than almost anything else\nlike literally and it is a lie right and\nself-doubt lives in our head it's our\nthoughts but it is not you it is not you\nand it's like our knowing our truth our\nworthiness I feel like it's in our soul\nit's innate I remember uh a moment Jay\nwhere\nmy whole life I as a little girl I would\nsit there home alone and I'd watch Oprah\nand she was like my hero right and I\ndreamed of meeting her one day so for\neveryone listening maybe you had a like\na maybe your hero was Superman or like\nwe all have different I dreamed of\nmeeting her I'd watch her and I'm like\none day I'm going to host a show and\nshare other people's stories with the\nworld and she was just my my hero my\nwhole life and I remember this moment as\na little girl where I'm like I'm going\nto meet her I just had this knowing I'm\ngoing to meet her which made no sense\nI'm in the middle of a suburb of was\nWasington state like I'm going to meet\nher I just knew it and I dared to\nbelieve it was going to happen I dared I\nprayed it would happen fast forward 39\nyears and I had the chance to meet her\nat an event which is the long story I\nwon't go into it was amazing and then it\nwent by so fast I wrote her a letter\nafter and sent it to her Chief of Staff\nwhich is one in a billion that she would\nread that the chief of staff would read\nit Amy was her name then one in a\nbillion she would share it then one in a\nbillion Oprah would read it all the\nthings happened and Oprah invited me to\nher house for lunch and I'm sharing this\nbecause everyone listening I think is\ngoing to have an aha in their own life\nwith how we handle and how we sabotage\nthings we don't believe we worthy of and\nnow this was my dream my whole life and\nI went to her house for lunch which is\nlike what in the world right and and we\nhad a three-hour lunch just me and her\nat the very end this is make my lifelong\ndream at the very end of it she gave\ngave me her cell phone number and she\nsaid call me anytime you can call me\nanytime and Jay in this moment my life\nand I just want everyone to put\ntheirselves in these shoes because we\nall do this I was really confident I did\nnot know there is a big difference\nbetween self-confidence and selfworth\nand everything was going right in my\nlife right like I just sold a Cosmetics\nfor the money like the Forbes list all\nthese things were and I was really\nconfident and the day she gave me her\nnumber I did not call her for four years\nliterally didn't call her for four years\nand in that four years stretch I told\nmyself stories that I thought were true\nlike oh I just need to have the perfect\nthing to say then I'm going to call her\nor I bet everyone wants something from\nher I'm going to prove I don't need\nanything I'm not you know I tell myself\nand literally four years later it hit me\nlike this light bulb that burst where I\nwas like the real reason I have not\ncalled her was because deep down inside\nI didn't believe I was worthy of being\nher\nfriend and this is what selfworth low\nself-worth will do to you you can have a\nlot of confidence you could be crushing\nit everywhere but you sabotage an\nopportunity you sabotage your marriage\nyou sabotage a friendship it shows up in\ndifferent areas and that was the day you\nreminded me of the story because we\ntalking about our thoughts and our\nself-doubt that was the day when this\nhappened and I realized it I literally I\nimagin myself turning down the dial uh\nlike almost like a volume dial and of a\nradio of my thoughts and my self-doubt\nthat says you are not worthy of being\nher friend and I imagine like turning up\nthe volume on my soul like my knowing\ncuz I am a kickass friend I know I am\nworthy of being her or anyone I am such\na good friend and I know that and and\nand and and I remember turning the\nvolume up on that knowing and that was\nthe moment I called her when I learned\nto to turn down the volume on my on on\nthe lies that tell us we are not enough\nand unworthy and like tune into our soul\nand to our knowing and that was the day\nI called her at first I called her she\ndid not answer I was like oh my gosh\nfour years and she didn't answer but\nthen I called again and she did um and\nand and that was the day I became\nobsessed with studying self-worth\nbecause I realized oh my gosh while\nself-confidence is so important while\nI've worked so hard and I'm so proud and\nI believe we always need to be building\nself-confidence and growing and\ncontributing something bigger than\nourselves to feel fulfillment all of\nthose things are multiplied by our level\nof self-worth and anything Time Zero is\nzero so if we do not feel we are enough\ndeep down it is why we will be\nperpetually unfulfilled no matter how\nmuch we achieve and what is the point of\nall of it if we are unfulfilled and\ndon't enjoy it and so became obsessed\nwith studying selfworth and I just think\nabout how you know I taught a course\nwith her this last year and now it's and\nit almost didn't happen and when I think\nabout what do self-doubt already cost\nyou like for everyone listening and\nwatching us right now what hasn't\nhappened what like I almost so many\ntimes Jay doubted myself out of my own\ndestiny right and like this is why\nBuilding self worth is so important I'm\na little passionate about about worthy\nthe book little passionate yeah a little\npassionate I love it no but you you have\na chapter in here called change your\nrelationship with rejection yes and I I\nthink what's really interesting about\nthat is that\nrejection is a reminder that we don't\nhave selfworth right that's the root of\nwhy it hurts so much is because when\nsomeone rejects us it reminds us of how\nwe've been rejecting oursel time and\ntime and time and time again we haven't\nshowed up for ourself we haven't lived\nour authentic self we have rejected\nourself and so when someone rejects that\npart of us it causes so much pain so\nwhen you're telling us to change your\nrelationship with rejection yes how does\none even St because I think whether\nsomeone's trying to become an actor\nwhether someone's trying to get a job\nwhether someone's trying to find a\npartner rejection is almost the path yes\nbut we don't always see it that way yes\nand I love what you just said said which\nis so insightful every single time we\nshow up inauthentically too every time\nwe're not who we are every time we you\nknow show up as our representative in a\nroom or or the people pleaser and we say\nyes when we mean no or anytime we show\nup as someone who we think other people\nwant us to be but not as who we are we\nare telling ourselves we are Unworthy of\nbeing who we are and we slowly but\nsurely chip away at our selfworth\nthere's a whole chapter in here called\nyou're not crazy you're just first and\nit's all about the power and the data\nbehind it of oh my gosh about how so\noften the things that we think are wrong\nor odd or quirk or off or different or\nstrange or or wrong about us they're\nactually the things that are most right\nabout us and literally I built a billion\ndollar business figuring this out this\nis this this tastes like Freedom when\nyou Embrace this this tastes like\nFreedom I'm so excited for everyone to\nread that chapter and also the one\nyou're talking about when you change\nyour relationship with rejection you\nchange your life and exactly what you\nsaid so uh again so so a lot of us\nassociate so much pain with with getting\nrejected or failing right that that will\nstay stuck and and to your point it can\nhit deeper so here's the thing whether\nwe've been rejecting ourselves by not\nshowing up authentically or a lot of us\nare unaware of past rejections or\nfailures and and when we build\nself-worth what's beautiful is\nrejections and failures they just shake\nour confidence for a bit but they cannot\ntouch our selfworth but for a lot of us\nwe've had past rejections or failures\nthat yes have hurt our confidence but\nwe've let him take root at an identity\nlevel and we've started to believe we're\na failure or we're a reject and that is\nwhen they crush your selfworth and so I\ngo into a four-part framework called the\nfour RS in this chapter and it is oh my\ngosh this might be my favorite chapter\nbecause this was almost its own book\nwhen you change a relationship with\nrejection you change your life I did not\nwant to wait two and a half more years\nto put it out which as you know as an\nauthor you have to wait I'm like like no\npeople need this now so it's now chapter\n2 in the book um but here's the thing\nwhen I was building at Cosmetics with a\nlot of people don't know they just kind\nof read the Press headline oh Denny's\nwaitress builds billion dollar company\nbut it was hundreds and hundreds of\nrejections along the way it was so many\npeople that I just love and I used to\nsave my Denny's tip money to buy a\nlipstick at Sephora and in the\nDepartments like I love shopping there\nand all of a sudden they're telling me\nno that my ideas not going to work the\nBrand's not going to and this was no\nafter no after no after no and from the\npoint I launched this business in my\nliving room it was three years before I\ncould even afford to pay myself a penny\nbut then hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds of Nos and here's the thing a\nlot of people maybe they know at\nCosmetics today and they see it at\nSephora or at Ulta beauty or at you know\nin the department stores on QVC uh and\nthey don't realize it was actually years\nof all of them saying no no no no no no\nno no no no no no and Jade sometimes it\nwasn't just no it wasn't like no come\nback later it was like no like some of\nthe NOS were so painful I would cry\nmyself to sleep under the covers and\nmost of us have so much pain attached to\nrejection that we give up after one no\nor five NOS or we start to think that\nsomeone else's rejection or no or\ndisbelief in us or whatever it might be\nis some indication of our potential or\nsome indication of our idea or our dream\nor our talent and it is not it is not\nand so what I what I um my intention\nbehind this chapter was I was like okay\nlet me break down at a granular level\nwhat are the tools on how to reframe\nrejection so that you actually embrace\nit in a way where you become Fearless\nover it and I break down the four RS\nwhich is how I went from you know going\nthrough hundreds of rejections and\nliterally not letting them take root\nliterally deciding like oh you know this\nis no indication if my business is going\nto make it if my idea is right and there\nwas one moment after this really painful\nrejection from QVC and I knew in my\nknowing right we talk about our knowing\nin my knowing Jay I knew like I'm\nsupposed to be doing this and every time\nI'd pray or get still I just felt this\nknowing like I'm supposed to be doing it\nbut everyone around me was telling me no\npotential investors were telling me no\nall these retailers were tell telling me\nknow and two things for anyone who needs\nthis today what I realized is okay I'm\ngetting all these NOS but when I get\nstill and for some people that's\nmeditation for some people that's prayer\nwhen I get still and I pray I will hear\na knowing and everyone of us has a\nknowing and your knowing is more\npowerful than anyone else's advice and\nin this case I had this journey of all\nthese knows and I had my knowing and I\nbelieve which one you listen to do you\nlisten to the the nose and sometimes our\nthoughts we're the ones telling\nourselves the most painful nose or do\nyou listen to your knowing right and\nwhether you listen to the NOS or the\nknowing I think your life your business\nyour relationships can come down to\nwhich one you listen to but when we're\nin the Journey of understanding that the\nnose can be really painful so there was\none particular moment I was crying under\nmy covers from another rejection from\nQVC and I started Googling every thought\nleader every person who has helped move\nHumanity forward person in business\nwho's ever built incredible things every\nsingle one of them has faced countless\nrejections countless failur countless\nsetbacks they're just the brave ones\nwilling to keep going anyways and what I\nrealized in that moment was every time I\nhad been getting a no up till then the\nfirst thought I'd have is yet there's\nproof I'm not enough right and so and\nwhy that's important is for everyone\nlistening if you imagine yourself\ngetting rejected or imagine yourself\nputting yourself out there telling the\nperson you want to be more than just\nfriends or putting an idea on social\nmedia or going for the business or\napplying for the job and and and you\nimagine yourself getting rejected or\nfailure or failing at it think about the\nfirst thought you think like for me most\nof my whole life it was yep I'm not\nenough proof I'm not for a lot of us\nthat first thought is so painful and by\nthe way that first thought is actually\nyour current definition of rejection or\nfailure that is the meaning whether you\nknow it or not that you're assigning to\nrejection or failure and that meaning\nfor so many of us is so painful that it\nwill keep us stuck we will quit we will\ngive up right and so for me my whole\nlife it was oh yeah there's proof I'm\nnot enough and in the single moment\ncrying under the covers then Googling\nall these people and realizing wow\nthey've all had a million rejections\nthey're just the brave ones willing to\nkeep going anyways and that day I wrote\ndown rejection does not mean I'm not not\nenough rejection means I'm one of the\nbrave ones like it's a victory I'm one\nof the brave ones willing to keep going\nforward anyway I am not one of the one\nsitting on the sidelines in regret right\nno I'm one of the brave ones and so I\nreframed it and then every time I got\nanother no I committed right because\nright away I would think oh yeah proof\nI'm not enough like no no no no I'd\nintercept that thought replace it with\nthis new definition like this is a\nvictory means I'm one of the brave ones\nwilling to go for it and and I believe\nthat to be true um and so this four-part\nR framework is to reveal your current\ndefinition of rejection which we all did\nright the first thought you have when\nyou get rejected or fail that's actually\nyour current definition and for a lot of\nus it's real painful when I ask groups\nof people this it's like I shouldn't\nhave even tried I'm a loser I'm stupid\nwhy'd I go for it that's your current\ndefinition it wasn't meant to happen\nexactly and so then when you redefine it\nwhich is what I started to do in that\nmoment where I wrote out um rejection\ndoesn't mean I'm not enough it means I'm\none of the brave ones willing to go for\nit and then I started building a toolbox\nin my life that's such a great of new\ndefinitions so another one I love is\nrejection is God's protection right\nrejection is the universe's protection\nrejection uh uh means I'm one step\ncloser to that yes rejection is I'm\nputting in the Reps I'm getting strong\nenough to carry the weight of My Success\nwhen it does happen uh rejection means\nlike okay I'm excited for what's coming\ncuz this is not happening to me it's\nhappening for me and I cannot wait to\nright so when so I go through in the\nbook how you do this and build this new\nset of definitions that you're committed\nto and then the third R is my favorite\nand it is called revisit and this is the\none that will change everything it's\ngoing to be really emotional for\neveryone likely who does it but Jay a\nlot of us have past rejections or\nfailures the person that broke our heart\nthe person that we wanted it to work out\nso bad and it didn't or the job we\nwanted so bad and they didn't see our\nvalue and we don't know why or or the\npartner who betrayed us or the friend\nthat pulled the rug out from underneath\nyou or the new friend that did not\ninvite you to the party and you don't\nknow why and and the third R is revisit\nand this is where you go to rejections\nthat have happened that you've let take\nroot into your identity and tell and\nconvinced you you're somehow a rejector\nyou're somehow a failure and then you\napply these first two steps to them you\nreveal what your meaning is you're\ngiving to them and then you redefine\nthem and this is like oh my gosh so many\nof us are letting past rejections and\nfailures stick to us like like labels\nthat we think are permanent that are\nlike lead balloons on our wings when\nwe're trying to fly and we're trying to\nsoar and but we're holding ourselves\ndown and and I have done this with so\nmany things in my life and it has been\nhuge because two quick things I'm so\nexcited but you know I was adopted and\num and I was raised by parents who oh my\ngosh I feel so blessed but they worked a\nlot and I was always home alone watching\nOprah in my living room uh but all\ngrowing up and later in life I found out\nI was adopted and I always had this told\nmyself this story that or I always felt\nabandoned or unwanted and the way that\nthat came out in my life oh my gosh like\nI would stay and talk relationships cuz\nI didn't want to abandon the person\nlater on when I'm crushing it in\nbusiness and have over a thousand\nemployees in my company I would not fire\nemployees soon enough when like they\nreally really deserved it because I\ndidn't want to abandon them and I I went\nthrough this process in the book and I'm\nand I realized the meaning I was giving\nto being adopted the meaning I was\ngiving to growing up alone a lot and I\nrealized okay I can tell myself that\nstory or I can actually redefine it in a\nway I know is true and I just decided\nokay you know what my birth mom and dad\nwere together one time ever like God\nchose me to be conceived and then my\nbirth mom's life would have been so much\neasier if she did not have me but she\nchose to bring me in the world and my\nparents chose to raise me I'm like I'm\nnot unwanted I'm Chosen and like I\nbelieve that to be true and it has\nshifted how I show up in friendships it\nhas shifted how I believe I'm worthy of\nfriendships\num and my all-time favorite just in case\nsomeone needs this today because I think\nso many of us have have been hurt by\nother people have been hurt have people\nhave not loved us the way we need or\nwe're just hurt because we feel like\nwe're not included or a friend doesn't\nsee our value or we're trying so hard to\nput ourselves out there and it's not\nworking uh I will tell myself this\ndefinition and this is for someone who\nneeds this today I feel it in my soul I\nwill literally imagine God saying to me\noh\nyou weren't rejected I hid your value\nfrom them because they're not assigned\nto your destiny and I will believe it\nand even to this day it helps me like\nlet rejections roll right off me like if\nI'm not invited to a party Jay the old\nme wants to think I'm not enough they\nlike and right away I'm like oh okay\nGod's blocking my value from that person\nbecause I don't know why but they're not\nassigned to my destiny and I'm going to\ntrust it I'm going to believe it and it\nhelps me not let these things take root\nin my ident identity and it helps me\njust like break free from them and so I\ngo through the whole four-part framework\nof of how to do this but I I can tell\nyou it's almost never an accident when\nsomeone has been able to create or build\nor succeed in something and and while I\nhave made so many mistakes and I have a\nlot of issues in my life right now fear\nof rejection and failure is not one of\nthem it is literally one of the tools on\nhow I endured hundreds and hundreds and\nhundreds of rejections and then Jay like\nwhat's so kind of cool this is cool is\num just because I know someone needs to\nhear this today that someone else's\ndoubt about you is no indication it's no\nindication of your potential of If your\ndream's going to work of if your idea is\ngoing to work of if you're going to make\nit of if your business is going to\nsucceed and I look back and every single\nperson that told me no along the Journey\nof building a cosmetics and sometimes it\nwas years even after we built the number\none brand in QVC number one Beauty brand\nin their history after they said no for\nyears even after that I think it was\nlike I don't know how many more years\nbefore Sephora finally said yes it was\nno after no forever and every single one\nof those NOS turned into a yes every\nsingle one of them and it's just like I\ndon't know who needs to hear this but if\nyou have a knowing if you have a knowing\nthat you are supposed to be doing what\nyou're doing whether it's putting your\nart or your talent out there in the\nworld or going for that job or launching\nthat business like\nother people's NOS cannot compete with\nyour knowing you and you've got to trust\nyour knowing the second you start\ntrusting all those other NOS or the nose\nthat get in your head that will take you\ndown all day long right it will but\nthose that rejection those nose are no\nindication of your potential and so it\nwas just really important for me to go\nthrough it's really like a master class\nin that in Worthy on how do you reframe\nrejection and learn to believe it so it\ndoes not have power over you and it\ndoesn't take root in your selfworth and\nit doesn't hold you back so I hope um I\ncan't wait for to hear how this blesses\npeople and I want them to share this\nfirst of all anyone listening share this\nepisode with someone who's like oh my\ngosh if they knew how to like reframe a\nno or reframe rejection but then then\npost and tag Jay and tell them how this\nis impacting your life because this is\num yeah it just tastes like freedom and\nit's all a lie you know the someone\nelse's rejection impacts our potential\nthat is a lie that is a lie and when we\nlearn not to believe it's just it's\nFreedom you can see the freedom on your\nface and I want everyone to know just so\nthat you know some of the other lies\nthat I think you'll love to read when\nyou get the book uh lie I don't have\nanything special to offer you're going\nto love that chapter another lie I need\nto please them to love me that's going\nto be another lie that chapter is going\nto blow your mind and there are so many\nother phenomenal insights towards Jamie\nhas just shared a tip of the ice B\nversion of some of the amazing tools\nthat are inside this book and Jimmy I\nwant to ask you one last question that\nI'm I'm sitting with as I'm looking at\nyour beautiful cover I'm I'm witnessing\nyou like a rocket ship flying off of\nthis seat uh and which lie are you still\ntrying to\nunlearn which lie am I still trying to\nunlearn I think um every single day I\nwork to unlearn them the the one I will\nsay that I that feels the best to be\nunlearning right now um I I mentioned it\na little bit earlier but didn't go into\nit and maybe this is exactly for someone\nright now it's so funny I'm not even\nthinking about you and me I'm thinking\nabout the person listening who is just\ngoing to break free with this that's why\nI'm getting so excited um but my whole\nlife Jay for anyone who has felt like\nthey're a little odd or different or\nmaybe they don't quite fit in with their\nfamily or they're like the one that\nlikes to read books when no one else\ndoes or they're the one that you know I\nused listens to podcast yes listens to\npodcast or has big dreams I always felt\nlike I had to kind of change who I was\nto fit in and that who I was if I was\nfully me I would not belong and I always\nkind of felt like that and I always felt\na little bit different and I remember\ngrowing up I would have these big wild\nideas about you know things that could\nimpact the world and and and again I\nhave loving blessed loving family but uh\nI would often hear things like things\nlike that don't happen to people like us\nor you know things like that right and\nand I and and I remember um and I'd\nalways hear like you're crazy you're\ncrazy and it was a term of endearment\nbut you know you're crazy who do you\nthink you are and I just got really good\nat dimming my own light to make everyone\ncomfortable um I got really good at\npeople pleasing and uh in my 20s I was\nthe first person my families that I'm\naware of to go to therapy no one had\never gone to therapy that I am aware of\nand I remember flat out asking my\ntherapist I said you know I'm am I crazy\nlike my family's always said these words\nas Terms of Endearment but like I feel\nlike I'm very different and I don't fit\nin and I and I asked her and she said\nyou're not crazy but I'm really glad\nyou're here and um she explained to me\nthat when you are the first in your\nfamily or your peer group or the people\nyou raised around or your colleagues\nwhen you're the first to actually be\nbrave enough to be who you authentically\nare and be willing to think different or\nlove different or vote different or\ncreate different right uh uh that you\nwill it often comes with feeling othered\nor feeling like you don't quite fit in\nor you don't quite belong uh because you\nare the first ever you and I remember\nthis moment that hit me like a light\nbulb like so bright it Burst when I\nrealized I'm not crazy I'm just first\nI'm not crazy I'm just first I'm the\nfirst ever me and every person listening\nto you and me right now like you are the\nfirst ever you and if you are one of the\nbrave ones willing to show up in this\nlife as who you truly authentically are\nyou are first there has never been\nanother you before there will never be\nanother you again like no one in this\nworld has your unique fingerprints or\ntongue print or or Iris of your eyes or\nwe all have a unique heartbeat but also\nif you think about this right for\neveryone listening no one else has you\nknow the experiences you've have and And\nthe emotions that you feel or sees art\nor beauty in the world the way you do\nand so when you show up authentically as\nwho you are do not be surprised if not\neveryone gets it like they've never seen\nanother you before right there's no\nsocial proof that your idea is going to\nwork if you're doing it authentically\nbecause it's never been done before and\nwhen we talk about that lie about oh I\nhave nothing special to offer okay I\nwalked into a beauty industry with tens\nof thousands of Brands and I and I\nlaunched a concealer then a foundation\nthat has been done a million times\nbefore but guess what I D to do it\nauthentic to me right and that has never\nbeen done before and so for every person\nlistening who thinks someone's done my\nidea someone's done it better than me\nsomeone's done it smarter than me that\nis a lie because when you are willing to\nbe the Brave one and show up is who you\nauthentically are you cannot prove me\nwrong it has never been done before your\nidea has never been done before the way\nyou're going to do it and that is why it\nis your superpower to be fully\nauthentically you because we think oh\nthose things are wrong if they found out\nof who I really am of you know oh uhuh\nthe second you are not you there's an\nautomatic barrier of disconnection\nbetween you and customers you and a\npotential partner you and friends when\nyou are who you f are even the quirks\nand all that is your superpower you are\nnot crazy you are just firsted and and\nand that has been I think the of all the\nlies that is the one that is the most\nfreeing it is the most liberating it has\nbrought me so so much closer in my\nfriendships right and and walking into\nthis room with you J Shetty a friend who\nI love and adore if I am thinking about\noh I need to be a great and say the\nright things and idea there's now a\nbarrier of disconnection between me and\nyou between me and every single person\nlistening and watching right now and\nthere's probably a billion things I've\nsaid that I could do such a better job\nat but guess what I said them fully me\nyeah I was jumping out of my chair\nbecause that is full but this is how\npeople connect and so every person\nlistening who feels like they have to be\nsomething slightly other than who they\nare uhuh uhuh you are not crazy or odd\nor different you're first right and and\nand the last thing I'll say to that Jay\nwhen I was finally got one shot on QVC\nafter years them telling me no and and\nwe sold out in 10 minutes which is a\nwild story and then I eventually did\nover a thousand live shows right we were\nselling over $200 million in product a\nyear just me to a camera on QVC I mean\nthe whole thing was wild but I sat in\nthat green room for over eight years\nover a thousand shows and I met tens of\nthousands of entrepreneurs of brand\nfounders\nof of celebrities of people that came in\nto sell their product on air one out of\nevery I don't know thousand ever come\nback because it is so hard to hit the\nsales numbers because you're live on air\nand they know by the second if you're\nhitting sales numbers and I remember\nwatching this and this is for everyone\nlistening right now I remember watching\nover an eight-year window going what is\nthat commonality with the very few who\nmake it what is that the very few who\nget you know who hit numbers get invited\nback and another time and eventually\nbuild something that lasts what is that\ncommonality and I would just watch watch\ntens of thousands of from every the\nbiggest brands in the world the most\nfamous people in the world the greatest\nFounders and literally it was not who\nhad the best product it was not who is\nthe most famous it was not who's giving\nthe best discount or Deal of the Day\nnone of that it was not who is the most\nseasoned sales person or television\nprofessional the only thing they had in\ncommon the very few who made it was that\nthey are the same on air when they are\ntalking to customers and selling their\nas they are off air in the green room\nand it did not matter if they're\nextroverted or introverted if they're\nquirky and out there and big personality\nor like really quiet and very like\nmeticulous it didn't matter it's the\nones that were the exact same because\nyou cannot fake authenticity and and and\nand customers and people sense it and\nfeel it whether it's your online\ncommunity or it's the people buying your\nit doesn't matter and when I watch that\nI'm like this is the most freeing thing\never because it takes all the pressure\noff of feeling like you got to be\nsomething you're not or you got to show\nup as your representative and I saw\nproof before my eyes in the form of\nliterally success of of conversion to\nsales of people trusting that person\nlike right before my eyes year after\nyear after year that it does not matter\nhow you show up you just have to be\nauthentic like that's it and how few\npeople are and what I realized the last\nthing I'll say is that that I realized\nthis lesson that I try to live by every\nsingle day because I think this applies\nto every area of Our Lives that while\nauthenticity alone does not\nautomatically guarantees success\ninauthenticity guarantees failure every\ntime over time in every area of our life\nbut when we Embrace that it's just all\nthe pressure comes off and it just\ntastes like Freedom it feels like Joy so\nwhen we live in alignment with our\nassignment Jamie I want to thank you for\nrevealing and releasing so many of the\nlies I have within me during this\nconversation too I really felt that\nsitting here and consuming and deeply\nimmersing myself in what you were saying\nthere were so many\nwonderful releases that happened just\njust in that process and I'm sure that\nI'm not the only one and so if you've\nbeen listening or watching I'd love for\nyou to grab a copy of Jam's book worthy\nhow to believe you are enough and\ntransform your life simple steps\nlife-changing results the book is\navailable now the link is available in\nthe caption below please go

compassion my fears\nare only going to continue to show me\nwhat I'm capable of the more that I face\nmy fears the more that I feel I'm\ngaining strength I'm gaining wisdom and\nI just want to keep doing that"
