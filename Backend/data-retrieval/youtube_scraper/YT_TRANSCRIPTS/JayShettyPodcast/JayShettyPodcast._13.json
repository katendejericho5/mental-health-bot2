    "transcript": "let's bust a major myth that dreaming\nand sleep is a time of rest for our\nbrains our brains are not resting while\nwe sleep just imagine somebody lying\ndown and when they're sleeping the heart\nis flickering a little bit of\nelectricity from the EKG that we put on\nthe surface of the heart we put a bunch\nof stickers on the surface of the scalp\nand there's vibrant electricity while\nwe're sleeping the electricity our brain\ngenerates while we sleep is as hot as\nthe electricity our brains are\ngenerating now so that's the first thing\nthe second thing is the heart when it's\npushing up the blood the brain is\nmopping up glucose it's burning hot\nmetabolically so inside our skull while\nwe're lying down even though we don't\nremember a lot of it we're burning hot\nand we're sparking electricity so people\nwho remember their dreams and people who\ndon't remember their dreams that brain\nis still sparking hot and generating a\nlot of electricity so I think it's more\nof memory recall in the morning"
