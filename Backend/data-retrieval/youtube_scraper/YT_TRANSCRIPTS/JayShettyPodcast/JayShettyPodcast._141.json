medicine in a way\nthat would be catastrophic we could tell\nthe insurance company how long you had\nto live to the month Chief Human\nbiologist Gary Brea he's going to make\nyou superum we know that sedentary\nlifestyle is the leading cause of all\ncause mortality you're breathing in that\nrepetitively expired air dropping that\noxidative State you're making the blood\nmore hospitable to\n[Music]\ndisease hey everyone I've got some huge\nnews to share with you in the last 90\ndays\n79.4% of our audience came from viewers\nand listeners that are not subscribed to\nthis channel there's research that shows\nthat if you want to create a habit make\nit easy to access by hitting the\nSubscribe button you're creating a habit\nof learning how to be happier healthier\nand more healed this would also mean the\nabsolute world to me and help us make\nbetter bigger brighter content for you\nin the world subscribe right now the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast\nJett J shett the one the only\nJett you talk about the ability to\npredict how long someone will live and\nthat sounds fascinating and crazy at the\nsame time how is that possible well\nfirst of all it's based on large data\nand it wasn't me just looking at blood\nwork and Gene tests and saying I can\ntell you how many more months you have\nleft on Earth but if we got in the\nindustry that I was previously\nassociated with which was large life\ninsurance if we got 10 years of medical\nrecords on you and 10 years of\ndemographic data we could tell the\ninsurance company how long you had to\nlive to the month and there are enormous\ncompanies that do this if the biggest\none is probably a Fano and Associates\nbut this is based on very very large\npools of data and remember that life\ninsurance companies have data that no\nother financial services Enterprise has\nno other you know bank has CDC doesn't\nhave it Collegiate universities that are\ndoing longevity studies don't have it\nand that is that they know the day the\ndate the time the location and the cause\nof death for hundreds of millions of\nlives and they have blood work on these\npeople they have um you know very\nin-depth um analytics on their\ndemographic data if you've ever applied\nfor a large life insurance company or\nlarge life insurance policy let's say 5\nmillion 10 million $25 million policy\nthere was at some point somebody\ndetermining not where you were on an\nActuarial curve but your specific\nmortality and the way that it's done is\nyou start with an Actuarial curve right\nso if you're 35y old male you have a\nlife expectancy of x if you're 28- year\nold female you have a life expectancy of\nY the question is not where are you on\nthat curve but what is your specific\nmortality and it's incredible how big\ndata Trends can actually predict not\nonly the onset of and the severity of\nbut how quickly you will succumb to\ncertain disease conditions and what\nbecame glaringly apparent to me was that\nyou know if the database that I had\naccess to during that 20 plus year\ncareer could see the light of day it\nwould permanently change the face of\nhumanity it it would upend modern\nmedicine in a way that would be\ncatastrophic because they have real data\nyou know so if you went to your um\ncardiologist for example and he put some\nheart stints in your heart and you left\nhis office um you may or may not ever\nsee him again he doesn't know if\nsomething happened to you 3 days later\nor 30 years later and you if you passed\nbecause of complications related to the\nheart stint or or just died of happy\nripe old age but the insurance company\nknow exactly Day date time location and\ncause of death and you can triangulate\nthat back into the record and you can\nsee where the mistakes were made either\nin Diagnostics as we know medical error\nis the third leading cause of death and\nthat doesn't mean that doctors are out\nto kill people um or that the Health\nCare system is out to kill people what\nwe know that it's completely\noverburdened and sometimes medical error\noccurs it just happens to occur at a\nrate that in the United States at least\nis the is the third leading cause of\ndeath and if you ever want to question\nwhether or not insurance companies are\ngood at predicting mortality just look\nat what happened during the 2008 and\n2009 Financial Services crisis we had we\nhad 364 Banks fail you didn't have a\nsingle life insurance company fail in\nthe United States a valid death claim in\nAmerica has never failed to have been\npaid\nnow that's an impressive statistic but\nyou also have to realized that only 2%\nof life insurance policies ever pay a\ndeath claim 98% of all life insurance\npolicies lapse so uh I guess I you know\nreally belabor that point but you the\nthe science of mortality is some of the\nmost accurate science in the world and\nif you really boil it down to the sum of\nits components you find that it's\npredict\nwhere processes in the body that are\nrunning on Parallel tracks will finally\nconverge right what we call\ncomorbidities when that happens there is\na parabolic rise in the ability to\npredict the terminal end of somebody's\nlife we know that for example all human\nbeings leave this earth the same way we\nactually all die of the same thing it's\ncalled hypoxia lack of oxygen to the\nbrain so when you can no longer sustain\nenough oxygen to the brain that you\ndon't have brain function that's\nessentially the definition of death and\nwe think of it as uh an event like a\ngunshot wound a heart attack a bus a\nstroke you know some other kind of event\nbut the truth is that this is a\npredictable curve um we used to uh use\nan underlying what we call a hypoxic\ncurve how well is this person managing\noxygen or how poorly are they managing\noxygen and once we were able to predict\nthat looking at red blood cell counts\nhemoglobin levels hormone levels\nnutrient deficiencies you can very\naccurately discern whether or not\nsomebody has a fighting chance of\ngetting out of their condition or of\nthat condition you know resulting in\ntheir demise and you know two things\nwere very trying for me in that industry\none was that you know I really began to\nrealize that it wasn't just data there\nwere human beings on the other side of\nthese spreadsheets but the second\nimmensely obvious point that came out of\n20 years in that career was that the\nmajority of the reason why people are\nnot living healthier happier longer more\nfulfilling lives is were because of\nthings that we called modifiable risk\nfactors just simple changes that they\ncould have made to their daily routine\nthat would have materially change the\ntrajectory of their life in most cases\nthey had to do with simple basic\nnutrients that were missing from their\nbody that were causing the expression of\ndisease and you know anemas D3\ndeficiencies hormone imbalance not\nbecause of their endocrine system had a\na particular uh disease or pathology but\nbecause it was nutrient deficient and it\nbecame so obvious to me that if I had\njust been able to pick up the phone and\ncall any number of these people you know\nI could have could have dramatically\nchanged the trajectory of their life wow\nI mean when I'm hearing you talk about\noxygen to the brain which sounds\nso obvious but it's something that is\nrarely\narticulated ox to the brain is not just\ngas entering the brain you know if you\nif you look at the molecular structure\nof a lot of the states in the brain that\nwe talk about like if you were to say um\nto me what is a mood what is an\nemotional state well it's a collection\nof\nneurotransmitters in most cases bound to\noxygen if you look at the molecular\nstructure of some of these activated\ndeactivated neurotrans transmitters or\nsome of these the differences between\ndifferent moods elevated emotional\nstates passion Elation Joy arousal or\nsuppressed emotional states anger you\nknow Vengeance despair you'd find that a\nlarge reason a large um difference\nbetween these two emotional states is\nthe presence of oxygen you know one one\nof the reasons why no human being is\never woken up laughing is because you\ndon't have the oxidative state to\nexperience laughter but can you wake up\nangry very easily lower to your\nemotional states do not require the\npresence of oxygen and so when you know\nif you want to do a fun experiment\ntonight just just pinch your wife while\nshe's in a deep sleep she will instantly\nwake up angry right I I actually don't\nsuggest that and then I may\nlove but if you wanted her laugh right\nif you wanted her to be joyous um if you\nwanted her to be elated aroused you you\nwould have to you know wake her up\nimprove the oxidative State and then\nallow those emotions to come in to play\nand and so you know I have a saying that\nthe presence of oxygen is the absence of\ndisease and so we know and you know very\nwell because you're you're you're in the\nspace that we feel emotion in an area of\nthe brain called the amydala right\nlittle two little almonds um and the\nfascinating thing about this area of the\nbrain where we experience every\nemotional state that we we can\nexperience if you're angry you're angry\nin the amydala if you're you're you're\nelated you're elated in the amydala area\nof the brain is that it is according to\nMIT the sole gateway to the hippocampus\nwhich is where our memory is\nstored and so when you start thinking\nabout that from a physiological\nstandpoint like well the sole gateway to\nthe hippocampus is through the Amiga but\nwhen you start thinking it from a\npractical standpoint then the sole\ngateway to our memory is through our\ncurrent emotional state and if that's\nhow we access memory and memory is what\nwe draw upon you know our prefrontal\ncortex and our our our Consciousness our\nfuture draws from our memories then if\nthe Amiga is what accesses the the\nhippocampus part of the brain and and\nTaps into our memory and then our\nconscience pulls from our memory then\nthis essentially means that your current\nemotional state determines your future\nand I just feel like if we could improve\nthe capacity for people to experience\nelevated emotional states for prolonged\nperiods of time not like a heart monitor\nright because you find find so many\npeople that are not in good\nphysiological condition that are trying\nto become in better emotional condition\nright better mood um and they're only\nable to reach these emotional states for\nshort periods of time like a like a\nheart monitor so um and they do all the\nright things they wake up they Journal\nthey read self-help motivational books\nthey go to the right seminars they try\nto um Express gratitude um even even\nfake their way through it but as soon as\nthey're done that intentional focus it\ndrops back down into the state where\nthey most comfortably exist and I\nbelieve a lot of this has to do with the\noxidative state in the brain it also has\nto do with nutrient deficiencies right I\nmean we every every emotion that we can\nfeel every every mood that we can\nexperience as a collection of\nneurotransmitters as we have imbalances\nand deficiencies in these then we cannot\nmanufacture the moods and the emotional\nstates that we that we really want to\nexperience and then we're told we have a\nmood disorder MH um or a mental illness\nand and I think very often we just have\na lack of mental Fitness and so when\nwhen you realize like the the happiest\npeople are the people that are moving\nthe most that have the greatest sense of\npurpose and that they're not necessarily\nthe the world's greatest biohackers but\nthey're eating Whole Foods they're\nmoving their body a lot they have a\nsense of purpose you look at the blue\nzones and and some of the things that\nactually extend life you know we would\nsee this in the medical record um yeah\nwere those people actually having some\nalcohol yeah were those people actually\nhaving a little bit of elevated LDL\ncholesterol sure um did those people eat\num sweets once in a while yeah they sure\ndid um but they moved on a consistent\nbasis and they had relationships and\nthey had a sense of purpose and for the\nmost part they ate Whole Foods and not\nany particular type of Whole Food not\nany particular type of diet wasn't a\ncarnival diet that extended their life\nit wasn't the keto diet that extended\ntheir life it wasn't the raw food vegan\ndiet that extended their life it was the\nwhole food diet you know just eating\nreal Whole Foods um so I kind of\ndiverted there for a second I get where\nyou're going yeah sometimes my wife is\nlike you just eat people's face and like\nyou know so government you sit next to\nme on like a commercial flight or\nsomething oh yeah I love it I love it\njust e how do we how do we how do we do\nthat though like how do we get more\noxygen to our brain like what does that\nmean what does that look like well I\nmean we know that sedentary lifestyle is\nthe leading cause of all cause mortality\nright and why is sedentary lifestyle the\nleading cause of all cause mortality we\nknow that that sitting is the new\nsmoking well we know why smoking was bad\nfor you right it destroyed the lungs um\nbut uh and you know that the nicotine\ncaused permanent lung damage and but it\nwasn't the really the nicotine it was\nthe reduction in the oxidative State and\nwhen the body doesn't have oxygen it\ncan't really defend itself I mean if you\nactually were to go in through the wall\nof a cell go through the cytoplasm and\nand and find the little organel floating\naround in there called the mitochondria\nwhich there's probably a thousand or so\nper cell and 32 trillion cells so it's\nestimated we have 110 trillion\nmitochondria about 10% of your body\nweight of these little mitochondria\nthese are this is the true energy source\nfor human beings and when cells become\nmetabolically sick and usually begins in\nthe mitochondria um including the\nGenesis of of of cancer and and forms of\nall kinds of different pathologies so\nwhen the mitochondria does not have the\nright oxidative State um you have a\n16-fold step down in its production of\nenergy and what happens when you take\nyou know a 16-fold step down in the\nenergetic state of a cell is now that\ncell can no longer eliminate waste\nrepair detoxify regenerate and so you're\nbecoming metabolically sick mainly\nbecause of the deficiency in oxygen it's\nnot that linear but that is the main\ncomponent and sedentary lifestyle means\nthat um we have prolonged periods of\nwhere our respiratory rate is very\nshallow when our respiratory rat's very\nshallow the majority of the air that we\nbreathe in and out is high in carbon\ndioxide see expelled air I mean right\nnow every time you let out a breath from\nthe tip of your nose and the front of\nyour lips all the way down your\nesophagus through the back of your ferx\nand all the way down and out to the\nbronchioles your in your lungs this is\nall expired air so when you breathe in\nand out if it's very shallow\nyou're breathing in that repetitively\nexpired air and you're dropping that\noxidative state in the blood you're\nmaking the blood more acidic you're\nmaking it more hospitable to disease um\nnot alkaline and less hospitable and not\nfull of oxygen which is energetic and so\nwhat ways to get more oxygen obviously\nthings like breath work just simply\nmoving your body give us give us one\nthat so I I love what you're saying here\nbecause it's so fascinating to\nunderstand that the reason a shallow\nbreath is reducing our lifespan is\nbecause of this idea of just how much\ncan get stuck and lost in there that's\nchanging in the gases yeah and so what\nare some breath work practices because I\nthink what we don't realize today is\nwith everyone dealing with anxiety\ndealing with stress dealing with\npressure we're all subconsciously\nbreathing far more shallower and we're\nbreathing quicker and you got these\nshorter quicker breaths and I think\nsometimes we're doing it without knowing\nat all what are some great breath work\npractices that you stand by there so you\nknow I don't have a breath work practice\nthat I that I take credit for I use a\nwhm Hoff style of breath work I mean you\nyou could spend a lifetime going and and\nI encourage people to do so I mean the\nlifetime going down the the just the\nbreath work Avenue there there's breath\nwork to wake up there's breath work to\ngo to sleep but I think it's important\nyou know as a as a part of a really\ndaily Health practice longevity practice\nsee you're just taking a deep breath now\nnow I'm like suggestion he's like that's\nwhat I'm saying yeah I'm like yeah let's\nget really Che like I'm not dying\nanytime soon I'm not going I'm not going\ndown every listening and watching is\ntaking a breath right now too everyone's\nlike everyone's doing the same thing I'm\ndoing they're doing it right now\neveryone's like counting how long their\nbreath is right now the truth is you\nknow it's better to breathe deeper and\nlonger and less frequently than it is to\nbreathe more shallow and less frequently\num in fact Wim Hoff in some of his\nteachings will do a very simple exercise\nwhere he'll say I just want you to look\ndown at your watch and I want you to\ncount the number of times you breathe in\nand out in the next minute and people\njust they don't know that they're\nactually being tripped and and what he's\nshowing is that the majority of people\nare are are breathing 15 18 sometimes 20\nbreaths in 60 seconds and what this is\nshowing you is if you're breathing that\nfrequently you're breathing that\nfrequently because of the very little\namount of oxygen that you're getting and\nso you're breathing shallow and your\nbuddy is trying to get more oxygen then\nhe says okay count the number of breaths\nin the next minute I want you to only\ntake four breaths for the entire minute\none every 15 seconds and you're going to\nbreathe\nin and you're going to pause and you're\ngoing to breathe\n[Applause]\nout and so essentially what he's trying\nto demonstrate is that in that same\nminute four\nbreaths actually was equivalent to 15 or\n18 or 20 breasts in the same period of\ntime but they were four deep breaths as\nwe age I read a statistic I don't know\nif there's any valid signs behind this\nor not um I actually got hassled online\nfor for repeating this but I read a\nstatistic that after age\n30 less than 95% of people will ever\nSprint again wow I don't know how much\ntruth there is to that but as I kind of\njust Meander my way through the world I\nI I I have a tendency to think that it's\nyou know fairly close and if it's not\n95% of people maybe it's 70% of people\nbut after age 30 and this means that\nwe're not using our auxiliary muscles of\nrespiration we're not using our\nintercostals we're not using our\ndiaphragm to massage our intestines\nwe're not correcting our posture and\ngetting you know air down into the loes\nof our lungs and out of the Apex of our\nlungs and and so what Wim Hoff talks\nabout is is um I do three rounds of 30\nbreaths um every morning takes about 8\nminutes there that is the one thing that\nI do that I never ever ever ever Miss\nthree rounds of 30 breaths that uh every\nminute you're only taking four breaths\nno no so it's three rounds to 30 breaths\nso the the one minute of four breaths\nwas just a way of showing you how you're\nactually hyperventilating yourself\nyou're actually you know if you're\ntaking 20 breasts in a minute or 15\nbreaths in a minute those are really\nshort breaths and which means you're not\ndrawing in a lot of oxygen and you made\nit through the next minute breathing\nless than a quarter of the the amount of\ntime and it just shows you that it's\nbecause during those 15 or 18 breaths\nyou use the Apex of your lungs during\nthose four breasts you use the loes of\nyour lungs where 2third of the storage\ncapacity is and so it's just\ndemonstrating the the fact that getting\noxygen deep into the loaves of our lungs\nand into our bloodstream is a very very\nhealthy thing and it not only elevates\nyour mood and your emotional state but\nit is the antithesis of disease it can\nactually even alkalize the blood um so I\ndo three rounds of 30 breaths\nobnoxiously deep\nbreath and then\nexhale and then on your 30th breath and\nyou exhale and you hold as long long as\nyou can when you start you might be\nholding your breath for 15 seconds 20\nseconds after several months of doing it\nbecause the the oxygen tension will\nchange the storage capacity changes um\nyou'll be up to I'm up to almost four\nminutes now so I can hold my breath for\nfour minutes between rounds and you want\non that exhale you want to build carbon\ndioxide you you that's the main Vaso\ndilator in in the human body it's not\nnitric oxide it's carbon dioxide the\nreason why we get vascular during\nexercise is because of the carbon\ndioxide traveling back to the lungs um\nnot necessarily because of the pressure\nso we want the carbon dioxide to build\nup we want that vasod dilation and then\npost vasod dilation we take a nice\nobnoxiously deep breath in we let that\nair out and we start again it's like my\ncoffee my caffeine my My Double Espresso\nin the morning I call it my drug of\nchoice because my body craves it like a\nrat to cheese So within 30 minutes of\nwaking every day I'm finding a spot to\ndo 30 minutes of breath work and and the\ngreat thing about it is number one it's\nfree and number two it's portable um you\ndo it in a you sound a little weird\ndoing it in the hotel room or in\nairplane bathroom um you know when I'm\non Long flights I I go in the restroom\nand do it God only knows what they think\nI'm doing in\nthere why would you doing your seat Well\num like everybody out there stressing\nout\nyeah I to ring the flight attendent call\nbutton but uh I was actually on a long\nflight from Dubai um back to New York\nand and and actually the a few times ago\nwhen I was in LA I went LA to to Dubai\non Emirates\nand um and they got a big bathroom in in\nthe front of the plane there and I just\nwent in there and had at it you know do\nlike 25 air squats and then I would do\n25 deep press 25 air squats 25 deep\npress and I I could see the looks on\npeople's face when I came out of the\nbathroom but I'm like I feel\ngreat and then and then every hour on\nthe hour I was going back in and doing\nthe same thing I know they were thinking\nGod just give it a r give it a break guy\nthey need a gym on planes yeah they we\nneed to normalize gyms on planes G on Yo\nsomebody was actually talking to me\nabout my friend Mikey Wang was talking\nme about that the other day how he wants\nto put gyms on planes take out the bar\nand put even if you just put like some\nTRX bands um or something you know I I\ncan't I can't imagine a squat rack with\nsome you know freeways but um but what a\ncool thing it would be if if the\nbusiness class section in the back like\nin Emirates it's it's a bar back there\nwith you know with a cool TV and little\nLounge seats but I I'd love for him to\nput some eyelets around and just throw\nup some TRX bands I I would be back\nthere doing in fact I had a whole group\nof people in the back of the planes\nabout 12 or 13 of us last time on my way\nto Dubai um and it convinced everybody\nto do breath work and we all sat in a\nbig circle on the back of that uh Airbus\nand uh and dead breath work for like 20\nminutes it was amazing Gary what's that\nI want to go back to something you said\nearlier what's the relationship between\nmental health and vitamin deficiencies\nwell if you look at um I don't think\nthis is talked about enough I don't\nthink it's talked about enough either um\nyou know when we talk about mental\nhealth a lack of mental Fitness you know\nso many mental health disorders are in\nmy opinion poorly understood they are\ndefined one way and treat a different\nway I just had Dr Palmer from from uh um\nfrom Harvard on my podcast it was\nfascinating how he was treating and he's\na board certified psychiatrist an MD and\nHarvard professor and he's treating some\nof the most drug-resistant psychiatric\nillnesses and I'm talking about the most\nawful of psychiatric illnesses you know\nparanoid schizophrenia the the the the\nconditions where people are literally\ntortured inside their own head voices\nwhat have you and they're drug resistant\nand he treated them with um supplements\nand ketogenic diets and again I'm not\ntrying to oversimplify you know mental\nhealth by any means and saying if you're\nsuffering from sphere depression just\nget on a ketogenic diet that's not at\nall what I'm saying but if you look at\nthe if you keep digging in and you say\nokay what is a mood what is an emotional\nstate um these are collections of\nneurotransmitters they're recipes right\num what is anxiety it's an excess it's\nan elevation of a category of\nneurotransmitters called catacol amines\nso if catacol amines rise in your brain\nyou will feel fearful you will actually\nfeel the presence of a fear without the\npresence of a fear and when we\nunderstand that the brain can play\ntricks on us because it truly doesn't\nknow the difference between perception\nand reality you know I use the example\nthat if you drove home tonight and you\ngot out of your car and somebody was\nstanding in front of you with a knife um\nvery real fear right your you would\nbegin to have a fight ORF flight\nresponse pupils would dilate heart rate\nwould increase your extremities would\nflood with blood but you could also be\nin your place here and we're very high\non the mountain in La um and you could\nbe laying in your bed tonight you could\nstart thinking about getting eaten by a\nshark you know that the chances of a\nshark getting out of the Pacific Ocean\nand making it up there right that your\nHill right even if you had an Uber um\nwhen we are are virtually zero but you\ncould have the exact same reaction how\nis it that I could have the same\nreaction to the Pres of real fear is an\nentirely imagined fear because at their\ncore at the Hub or all these spokes meet\nit's the same thing it's a rising\ncatacol amines so if we know fear can be\nborn from a rise in catacol amines then\nwe know anxiety and anxiousness can be\nfrom a rise in catacol me this is why so\nmany people that have anxiety or\nexperience\nanxiousness very often will say I've had\nit on and off throughout my entire\nlifetime and I cannot point to the\nspecific trigger that causes it they\ncould be sitting on a podcast like we\nare right now very calm their staff\naround nothing to be afraid of and all\nof a sudden become overwhelmed with\nanxiety so um and then we take it a step\nfurther and we say well where are these\nneurotransmitters come from how do we\nmake neurotransmitters well the majority\nof these are made in the gut um\nserotonin for example is methylated in\nthe gut we take a simple amino acid\ncalled tryptophan we methylate it into\nthe neurotransmitter serotonin it\ntravels up the Vegas nerve and it\ncreates a mood we take pheny alanine and\nTy and we turn those into dopamine the\nmain driver of behavior so if we know\nthat mood and behavior driven by\nneurotransmitters that are derived from\namino acids then why isn't it possible\nthat deficiencies in amino acids could\ngive rise to deficiencies in\nneurotransmitters could could then be\ninterpreted as a mental illness and\nagain I'm not trying to oversimplify\nmental illness by any by any means I\nbelieve in therapy I also believe that\nyou know meds do work in in in many\ncases but um why wouldn't we start first\nif we Define for example depression as\nan inadequate supply of Serotonin then\nwhy are we not trying to raise the level\nof Serotonin if we Define some addictive\nTendencies as an inadequate supply of\ndopamine the absence of dopamine is the\npresence of addiction one of the reasons\nwhy addiction has a tendency to shift is\nbecause we never treat the dopamine\ndeficiency we only treat the physical\naddiction right so these are why drug\naddicts become alcoholics alcoholics\nbecome Workaholics Workaholics become\nWorkaholics um you know you shift one\naddiction for another because that\ndeficiency in dopamine drives you to\nfeel want to feel normal and and this is\nwhere I believe most addiction starts is\nthe search for normaly not the search\nfor a high right I don't believe that\nmost most addicts woke up one day and\nsaid I want to get really banged up they\nwoke up one day and said I want to feel\nnormal yeah or numb or numb numb yeah\nyeah and in this search for that\nnumbness or the search for that normal\nwhether it was alcohol or nicotine or\npriscu or what have you um they felt\nthat that either that numbness or that\nsense of normaly and then the addiction\nGrew From that and so they they were\nthen running from a low not running\ntowards a high and this is one of the\nreasons why I have so much empathy for\npeople that are trapped in the cycle of\naddiction and I think that more\naddictive therapy needs to address these\ndopamine deficiencies but now we're\ngetting down to the the possibility that\num nutrient deficiencies could give rise\nto neurotransmitter deficiencies that\ncould give rise\nto states of mental instability and then\nwe label this mental illness you have\nADD ADHD you have OCD you have manic\ndepression you have bipolar you have\nschizophrenia you have um generalized\nanxiety you have generalized depression\nwhich I personally think are nonsense\nbut again I'm not attacking the mental\nhealth profession when you deprive the\nhuman body of certain raw materials you\nget the expression of dis disease and we\naccept this in so many different areas\nof medicine but we don't really accept\nit in mental illness right I mean how\nhow is a leading PhD from Harvard having\nsuccess treating drug-resistant mental\nillness with diet because it's not the\ndiet it's the nutrients that they were\ndeficient in um and how is it that\npeople that experience um High rates of\nanxiety and anxiousness and attention\ndeficit disorder or attention deficit\nhyp activity disorder can sometimes do\nsomething as simple as take a methylated\nmultivitamin and experience a dramatic\nreduction in their symptoms because\nnutrients matter the human being is such\na the human body is such a fascinating\nmachine you know it's the more you you\nstudy human physiology the more you you\nbelieve in God because there's no way\nthat this was just assembled by accident\nor by chance over time right you'll\nnever I don't care how much time you\ngive two bacteria in a mud puddle you're\nnever going to get a human being out of\nit and the intelligence with which it's\ndesigned how one raw material enters a\ncycle it gets used it creates waste and\nthen that waste is is accepted and taken\ninto another cycle and it's and it's\nutilized and it's like one man's trash\nis another man's treasure and cellular\nmetabolism is so fascinating because one\namino acid enters a cycle and it gets\nconverted into something completely\ndifferent homosysteine gets get\nmetabolized into methionine homosysteine\nthen can be one of the most inflammatory\ncompounds in the human body this gets\nmetabolized into methionine which then\ngoes up into the mind and quiets the\nMind by by dismantling by by by\nessentially downregulating catacol\namines these fight-flight\nneurotransmitters so puts people into a\ncalm state of being calm so then you\nstart to understand well the majority of\npeople that have sleep disturbance have\none or two types of sleep patterns they\nare either lay down to go to sleep body\ntired and they are mind wake mhm so when\ntheir environment quiets their mind\nwakes up why does the Mind wake up when\nthe environment quiets because you have\nexcess catamin in the brain there's a\nthere's a gene mutation called comp T CT\ncatacol Oyl transferase it's a fancy way\nof saying the the gene that codes for\nthe enzyme that that breaks down this\nclass of neurotransmitters that\ndownregulates them well let's say that\nthis gene mutation you have this and and\nand you have an impaired ability to\ndownregulate catac colam meines that\ndoesn't sound like a big deal until you\nrealize that catac colam Mees create a\nwaken state in the brain and so this\nwaken state usually happens at night and\nsomebody will lay there and they will\njust think about the most innocuous\nlittle thoughts while they are exhausted\nthey're just like did I get everything\non my grocery list um did my belt match\nmy shoes we changed the uh juny label to\nfuchsia from dark blue you know and\nyou're like why am I thinking about this\nat 2:30 in the morning right or you get\nup to use the restroom and you go back\nto bed and you lay there and your mind's\nawake and so you don't have a sleep\ndisorder you don't have a mental\ndisorder um you don't have generalized\nanxiety you don't have a mood disorder\nyou have excess catacol amines in the\nbrain and very often these can be\ndownregulated very simply with complexes\nof B vitamins methylated um uh B12\nmethyl folate the raw material that the\nbody needs to downregulate these and by\nby not giving the body the raw material\nwe get this expression of disease and\nthen we say this person has this\ncondition you know it I tell the same\nstory all the time a lot about when I\nwas in grad school and I took these\nthese plant botney courses um which I\ndidn't like to take because I wanted to\nget a human biology degree and I had to\nstudy algae um which wasn't wasn't super\nwasn't super interesting to me that's\nwhat was so interesting about biology\ngrowing up I I remember there's so many\nsubjects now I'm like if I knew that\nNeuroscience was a part of you know\nlooking at biology and so many other\nthings I would have been fascinated by\nitar about plant biology I didn't care\nyeah me too I I really could have cared\nless about plant biology but and then\nyou know then you have to start Rock\nstratas and and you know fossil lineages\nand all this other kind of stuff and I'm\nlike who who makes a career out of this\num but uh but you can actually get a\ndegree degree in traffic management too\nso I guess that that I'd rather study\nrocks than\ntraffic no offense to the traffic\nexperts out there you guys are killing\nit but um\nuh but you know when you when you start\nto realize\nthat I'm just still laugh we cut that\nout be like what an\n cck out just lost half your\naudience right there like don't don't\noffend the traffic guys dude somebody's\ngot to figure out when these lights go\non and off um go sorry\nI I'm just having a good time with you\nI'm having a good time too but I I don't\nknow how we got down that road but but\nin any case you know when you when when\nyou're studying\nplants all right goe go go I don't know\nwhy that's so funny yeah hopefully\nhopefully your listeners think it's so\nfunny but when you're studying plants\ngot it and you we'll cut it maybe we\nshould leave it in actually kind of like\nit um you you don't think you have a lot\nof traffic experts to listen to the\npodcast no probably probably a very low\nyou you probably lose two followers on\nthat one it's worth it you know if if\nyou have a leaf that rotting in the top\nof your palm tree and you call a true\narborist a true botanist down to your\nhouse and you know they'll look at that\nleaf and they won't touch the leaf they\nwon't even touch the tree they'll CEST\nthe soil and they'll say um you know\nwhat Jay there's no nitrogen in this\nsoil and they'll add nitrogen to the\nsoil and the leaf will heal we stop\nthinking about human beings this way we\ngo very quickly to chemicals and\nsynthetics Pharmaceuticals as a way to\nsolve potential nutrient deficiency in\nthe human body and we're fascinating\nmachines like plants and when if you\ndidn't add nitrogen to that soil all of\nthe things that were good for that plant\num would have done nothing right you're\nlike well maybe we should water it\nwater's great for plants when you put\nwater on there and nothing happens maybe\nwe should add sulfur sulfur is great for\nplants and you and you put sulfur you\nput Pete M on there and you're like Pete\nmus is great for plants and this happens\nin human beings too we don't get data so\nwe actually never find the nitrogen we\nnever find the raw material that's\nactually missing that's causing the\nexpression of disease and this is how\nmost people wander their way through\ntheir supplement routine they they get\nthey get lost in the Myriad of great\nsupplements and they start supplementing\nfor the sake of supplementing well is NN\ngood yeah it's great it raises NAD\nlevels um is Resveratrol good yeah it\ncan lengthen telm says St John's worth\ngood is ashwagandha good is Sal plemento\ngood should I take CoQ10 I mean you you\ncan make an argument for all of these\ndifferent things that we could\nsupplement with but like the missing raw\nmaterial like the missing nitrogen in\nthe soil if you don't find the\ndeficiency none of that matters and\nthat's why I tell people that they\nshould get data on their body you know\nthere's 74 biomarkers that I look at in\nthe blood they're right up on my\nInstagram if anybody wants to take those\nbiomarkers off my Instagram take them to\nyour doctor your your Healthcare\npractitioner and say hey will you look\nat these in my blood and have your\ndoctor interpret those that's a great\nplace to start I put the the the Gen me\nthat I think are the most impactful for\nmental health and for gut health and for\nmood and for anxiety and for quieting\nthe mind and for the research that I've\nI've been able to uncover on ADD and\nADHD and poor sleep um poor focus and\nconcentration and you could take those\nfive genes and you can um you know find\na genetic methylation uh counselor or\nfind a place to get a genetic\nmethylation test and get data so that\nyou go you know like you were telling me\nbut when we sat down before the podcast\nyou were telling me where you to get\nyour blood work done that's great\nbecause you're getting data you're not\njust aimlessly wandering around going I\ndon't know if I feel good I don't know\nif I feel normal I don't know if I could\nfeel better I don't know if maybe some\nof the little nagging things that are\ngoing on in my life and I don't know if\nyou have any but of course yeah I mean\nI'm not sleeping as good as I could and\nbeen working out and I don't have a\nresponse to exercise like I wanted I\nfeel like my focus is off you know my\nwaking energies a little I was going to\nask you actually about that because I\nthink a lot of people feel and and I\nwant to talk about some of the symptoms\nthat I hear from our community our\naudience of what people feel and to get\nyour take on how to combat that so one\nof the biggest things I hear from people\nis Jay I'm just feeling brain fog right\nI'm just feeling like I have no Clarity\nlike I struggle to make decisions I'm\nfeeling a sense of low energy and so\nlike I'm lethargic like these are very\ncommon things so with brain fog what's\ngoing on there well I mean everything\nthat you um feel about energy like when\nyou say I don't have I'm low on energy\nphysiologically what you're saying is\nI'm low on oxygen in my blood because\neverything that you perceive about\nenergy is nothing more than oxygen in\nyour blood so if oxygen equals energy\nwhich it does then if I want to raise\nyour energy level I need to improve the\noxidative State and how do I do that\nwell one of the ways and I'm not saying\nthis is the only way but one of the\nphysiologic pathways is um if we know\nenergy equals oxygen then we take it a\nstep further and we say well um what\ncarries oxygen around the human body\nwell red blood cell carries oxygen\ninside of a fluid and I'm simplifying\nfor you Ultra work biohackers but the\nyou know the red blood cell carries\noxygen inside of a fluid called\nhemoglobin so if I'm low on red blood\ncells right I'm low on vehicles to carry\noxygen if those red blood cells are\nfurther deficient in hemoglobin then the\nfew cells that I have that are able to\ncarry oxygen have less fluid to carry\noxygen therefore I'm hypoxic and it\nhides in plain sight so then the\nquestion becomes Where are red blood\ncells and hemoglobin made well they're\nmade in the bone marrow so how do I get\nthe bone marrow to make more red blood\ncells in hemoglobin I go to the Bone\nmarrow's boss um which is the hormone\ntestosterone um in men and women one of\nthe one of the roles of testosterone is\nurethr oesis to put pressure on the bone\nmarrow to make new red blood cells and\nin nearly every case where we see\nclinically deficient levels of this\nhormone testosterone free testosterone\nwe see Rebels and hemoglobin towards the\nlow end of the range and then you look\nat well what is testosterone made from\nwell I mean it's made from several\nthings but largely from DHEA so if I'm a\ndeficient DHEA I should get that fixed\nand and and what is the next\nmacronutrient below DHEA vitamin D3 so\nyou go oxygen red blood cells bone\nmarrow hormone testosterone dhaa D3 so\nif you start in the root and you raise\nyour D3 level to the optimal fun\nfunctional range which I think most\npractitioners would agree is between 60\nand 80 and then you raise your DHEA into\nthe optimal range and you wait to see if\nyour hormones respond um and if your\ntestosterone Rises especially your free\ntestosterone Rises your red blood cell\ncount and hemoglobin will go up as your\nred blel count and hemoglobin level rise\nthe amount of oxygen that you transport\nin your blood will rise and you will\nperceive that as more energy you will\nperceive that as improved focus and\nconcentration and your sleep will deepen\nwhy because in low respiratory States\nwhen our respiratory rate gets very\nshallow um we want our blood to be very\ngood at carrying oxygen because if\nyou're already poorly transporting\noxygen and then you try to get into a\ndeep sleep and your respiratory rate\ndrops and you get to where you are\nhypoxic your brain will wake you up it\nwill wake you up by pulsing cortisol and\nso you people that have that are\nexhausted sleep the worst and and ask a\nphysician sometime why is it that people\nthat are the most exhausted sleep the\nworst they very rarely connect the fact\nthat they're low on oxygen which is why\nthey're tired and have brain fog and\nthey're low on oxygen which is why\nthey're not sleeping because their brain\nis waking them up and then they do the\nworst thing they go to their doctor and\nthey go I can't sleep and so then the\ndoctor suggests something like AUM\nnitrate diazapam you know um Desta\nambient and and essentially they\ntranquilize you and and what's happening\nwhen you take a lot of these sleep\nmedications not all of them but when you\ntake a lot of these sleep medications is\nyou're in a low oxidative state so your\nbrain's trying to save your life and\nwake you up um and then you take a sleep\nmedication and you block the brain's\nview of blood oxygen so now the brain\ncan't isn't able to try to save your\nlife and wake you up and so now you get\ninto a deep sleep and you wake up the\nnext morning you go man I hate taking\nTylenol PM because it is I am so groggy\num it's still in my system the next\nmorning that's actually not true that\nthat Drug's been out of your system for\nhours you're feeling the effects of\nhaving suffocated for 6 hours and so\nsuffocating yourself to sleep and then\nand then now you've slept but you get up\nfrom the sleep medication and you are\nstill exhausted and you still have brain\nfog so there are other potential causes\nbut but you know that is the one the one\nthe one nice thing about the clinics\nthat we have is you know we see 20,000\nnew new\n[Music]\ncan be re restored there's a significant\ndifference between the memory actually\nfading which it does in the later stages\nand access to the memory fading so the\noxidative state of the body is very\nimportant which is why I I think people\nreally need to get data if your hormones\nare in the optimal range your you're\nyou're not nutrient deficient um you're\nnot insulin resistant I'm not saying\nthat your blood Labs need to be perfect\nbut by dialing in a few markers in your\nyour hormone levels and your nutrient\nlevels you can live a dramatically\ndifferent life MH and in the majority of\ncases probably 70% of the cases people\nthat qualify to be on hormone therapy\ndon't even need hormones they need the\nnutrients to make hormones and that to\nme is really exciting you mean I could\njust be deficient in something like DHEA\nlike D3 I could have an elevated protein\nlike shbg and I could I could take\nsomething simple like Boron and and\nlower that and raise my hormones and\nfeel a lot better yes I'm not saying\nthat you have to go and get on hormon\ninjections by any means but I am saying\nthat you need to get data on the\ndeficiency so that you can drive a state\nof being optimal because so many people\nthat um I work with will will call me\nlike you know weeks into our journey and\nsay oh my God Gary I feel amazing um\nincluding like Dana White and I'm like\nyou know you really don't feel amazing\nthey're like what I say you feel normal\nright that's how normal supposed to feel\nyou're really supposed to feel that good\nright this was we're not used to that\nthough we're not used to that yeah I was\ngoing to ask you what what does it feel\nlike have you worked in your clinics\nwith women preparing to give birth and\nthen post giving birth yes quite a bit\nin fact our Clinic director is a\nboard-certified um OBGYN she's a\ngynecological surgeon um she's got a\ndouble Masters because I feel like that\nJourney we still don't talk enough about\nhow challenging it is on the human\nbiology oh yeah it's it's it's um very\nchallenging I mean if you look at a\nwoman's you know what happens during\nwoman's menstrual cycle and you look at\nuh what happens when she becomes\npregnant it's perfectly normal during\nregular regular cyclical periods of her\ncycle for her estrogen to be as high as\nyou know in the 400s perfectly normal\nfor it to be in the teens so it has a\nvery large frequency you know um rise\nand fall depending on where she is in\nthe cycle soon she becomes pregnant you\nknow estrogen goes into the 4\nthousands um mainly because you know one\nof estrogen's primary role is to retain\nwater um to pad the uterus and and\nprotect protect the fetus has other\nother roles but it retains water but\npostpartum you don't want to be estrogen\ndominant um and you know it's it's not\nnecessarily for for women especially the\nthe level of hormone it is the ratio of\nhormones in their body and you know Dr\nSardis who's who's our OBGYN is\nphenomenal about pre and postpartum care\num she's an enormous believer that\ncertain Gene mutations like mtfr which\nincrease the frequency of of miscarriage\nshe delivered 9,000 babies so she's very\nqualified to speak on that um that the G\nmutation that is one of the most common\nG mutations in the world the MTHFR what\ndo it do it stands for methylene\ntetrahydrofolate reductase it is the\ngene that that codes for the conversion\nof folic acid and its derivatives like\nfolate into the usable form called\nmethylfolate and this is what I mean and\nwe have a process in body called\nmethylation which is where we take one\nraw material which is useless folic acid\nfor example entirely useless in human\nfolic acid does not prevent neural tube\ndefects it doesn't prevent anything\nuntil it is converted into methylfolate\nso what if your body can't make this\nconversion well it might not sound like\na big deal until you realize that number\none it's the most common gene mutation\nin the world and number two folic acid\nis the most prevalent nutrient in the\nhuman diet in the United States so if\nyou have an issue converting the most\nprevalent nutrient in the human diet\ninto the form that your body can use you\nhave a significant deficiency and the\nexpression of this deficiency is\nincrease in the number of miscarriages\num um infertility a difficulty in\ngetting um pregnant I'm just talking\nabout in the female cycle um postpartum\ndepression which can actually begin\nbefore the pregnancy ends we call it\npostpartum depression but very often it\nbegins during the pregnancy and women\nthat have this MTHFR gene mutation the\nfirst thing they're told when they get\npregnant by their OBGYN is to take high\ndoses of folic acid well if you put 1400\nor 1,00% of the daily allowance of folic\nacid into somebody a woman like that who\nhas that gene mutation and cannot\nprocess it that is a disaster and she\ndevelops postpartum depression before\nthe pregnancy ends and um eventually\nwhen the pregnancy ends she stops taking\nthe prenatal vitamin and the symptoms go\naway and so she blames it on the\npregnancy not on the vitamin and this is\nanother you know pandemic that we see is\nthat pregnant women all of them could\nuse methylfolate less than 60% of them\ncan use folic acid so why don't we just\ngive women methyl folate why don't we\nactually just give them the form that\nwould um that their that their body can\nuse by the way folic acid also is a\nman-made chemical you can't find folic\nacid anywhere on the surface of the\nEarth it does not occur naturally in\nnature so someone convinced me how you\nknow a synthetic chemical that we make\nin a laboratory is somehow necessary for\nOptimal Health yeah it's it's bizarre\nisn't it it can't be yeah you know\nwasn't even around I don't think until\n1993 or so what did we do before that\njust suffer um so I'm a huge believer\nthat um you know getting back to the\nbasics is really the gateway to Optimal\nHealth how do you know if you have that\nmutation and what do you do about it you\ndo a uh a genetic cheek swab um so\nthere's a cheek swab test you you you\nswab your cheek usually put it in a test\ntube you send it to the lab and they'll\nsend you back the results um even 23 in\nme I do I do genetic tests at at 10x\nHealth um you do not have to do the test\nthrough me but you know we do 20,000 of\nthese a month um I'm sure 23 me does\nsomething similar to that but you also\nget a lot depending on the type of\ngenetic test you do you you you'll get a\nlot of um non-actionable data right I\nmean like I if I pulled your entire\ngenetic code I could see that you have\ndark olive skin you have green eyes you\nhave brown hair you have detached\nearlobes but there's nothing you can do\nwith that genetic information um you\nwant you want to look at the genes\nresponsible for converting raw material\nvitamins minerals amino acids into the\nusable form I I I always use the analogy\nthat we we pull crude oil out of the\nground right but you cannot put crude\noil into your gas tank the car doesn't\nunderstand that fuel source crude oil\nhas to be refined into gasoline now the\ncar can run human beings are no\ndifferent we put vitamins minerals amino\nacids nutrients all proteins into the\nbody which are useless in that state\nuntil they are converted into the\ngasoline into the form that the body can\nuse and this is governed by several of\nour genes and they're very easy to look\nat and you only do that test once in\nyour lifetime that's fantastic thank you\nfor that I think that's going to help a\nlot of people listening or watching\nbecause I feel like question when we're\nthinking about people have planning for\nkids or have had kids and they're\nstruggling and again I think we all do\nthis and that's why I'm so glad we're\ntalking about this because I think the\nfirst thing we blame is our mind that's\nthe first thing we all do is we judge\nourselves and we go I'm not strong\nenough I'm too weak I'm mentally not\nthere I'm not figuring it out there's\nsomething wrong with me right but we're\nnot looking at the fact that let me\nactually take a look at what is wrong\nand which part of it and where has it\ngone wrong yeah you know you know what I\nthink we tried to do I mean just\nnaturally instinctively is when we don't\nfeel good or something seems to be going\nwrong in our bodies we're anxious we're\nworried we're depressed um or there's\nsomething more physical we're bloated\nwe're constipated we're irritable we got\ncramps um we're fatigued we begin to\nlook at our outside environment right we\nlook at what's called a cluster of\nsymptoms and a cluster of symptoms is\nvery often nonsense we diagnosed Abraham\nLincoln with a you know depression 150\nyears ago with a Custer symptom so we\ndid the same kind of diagnos IC use a\nsimilar diagnostic tools today what if\nyou consider that it's not something\nhappening to you it's something\nhappening within you right like that\nleaf that was rotting in the palm tree\nnothing happened to it something\nhappened within the soil that and then\ncaus something to happen within the tree\nwhich translated to that leaf and I I\nalways use that example because it\nstarts people thinking that you know\nwhat maybe I'm not as sick or\npathological diseased or mentally ill as\nas I think um you you know people very\noften that suffer from gut issues I mean\nwe see this thousands and thousands of\ntimes so they're like they get gas or\nbloating or diarrhea or constipation or\nirritability or cramping and they are\nalways trying to relate it to what they\nlast ate because that makes sense right\nI ate something and now I blew up like a\ntick it must have been what I ate but\nyou you may not be considering that if\nyou're deficient in meth folate for\nexample very simple\nnutrient that the peristaltic activity\nof the gut is off\nso the pace of the gut is off you know\nyou you can think of the human\nintestinal tract is a 30 foot long\nconveyor belt you put contents on it at\none end and as it traverses to the other\nend from the stomach to the rectum\nthere's a very specific sequence of\nevents that needs to occur there's\nacidic bacteria in the proximal end of\nthe small intestine there's there's\nalkaline bacteria and the distal end\nnear the rectum what if you just change\nthe pace of that conveyor belt what if\nyou went into any factory in America\nthat works on a conveyor belt system and\ndouble this speed of the conveyor belt\nthe whole line would break down what if\nyou went into any factory in America and\nreversed the speed of the conveyor belt\nthe whole line would break down but\nthere's nothing wrong with a conveyor\nbelt and so you know it sends people\ndown the wrong road because they're like\nwell should I get my gut bacteria\nchecked should I get my but gut biome\nlooked at should I start taking\nprobiotics should I U maybe take a you\nknow antibiotics and maybe maybe I have\nsibo should I change up my diet and and\nnothing really seems to work because if\nthey think it's something happening to\nthem rather than something happening\nwithin them and this happens very often\nwith anxiety with you know people that\nsuffer from anxiety generally have the\nsame three characteristics generally if\nyou'll ask them have you had it on and\noff throughout your entire lifetime\nthey'll say Yes um can you point to the\nspecific the trigger that causes it no\nhaving any anxiety medications helped\nyou no they just make me feel like a\nzombie those are very commonly the same\nsequence of answers so so that's that is\nnot something happening to you that's\nsomething happening within you if I ask\nyou if you have anxiety and you go yes\nI'm afraid of heights and every time I\nwalk to the edge of a 30th floor balcony\nI freak out yes I'm claustrophobic when\nI step on a crowded elevator I really\nget anxious but if you say yes okay well\nwhat causes it I don't know what makes\nit come and go pretty much anything um\nyou know have you had it on and off\nthroughout your life time yes then this\nis a sign that this is a\ngenetic mutation that's led to a\ndeficiency that's causing the expression\nof that condition we very rarely pass\ndisease from generation to generation we\ndo pass deficiency we pass these genes\nthat that are either broken or operating\nand when they're broken for a lack of\nbetter words these Gene Snips the body\nhas an inability to convert a certain\nraw material into the usable form which\nmeans that this deficiency is passed\nfrom generation to generation right so\nan A deficiency in the ability to\ndownregulate um homosysteine means that\nyou get the expression of hypertension\nso you see that hypertension runs in\nthese families even though there's not a\nhypertension Gene you see that the\ninability to convert thyroid hormone T4\ninto thyroid hormone T3 which is a de\nionization process in the in in the\nliver and the gut and the periphery that\nthis process is is impaired so so people\nhave hypothyroid but the hypothyroid\nruns in families so but there's no\nspecific hypothyroid Gene and and you\ncould go through dozens and dozens and\ndozens of cases like this we accept that\nthings are inherited or familial because\nthey run in our family not\nbecause we consider that the deficiency\nmay run in our family and the deficiency\ncan be fixed\ntwo more things I want to ask you Gary I\nwant to get your thoughts on this tap\nwater what is wrong with tap water and\nwhat is wrong with plastic bottles we'll\nstart with tap water I mean there are\ntwo or three things that I think that\neverybody should get out of their life\npermanently out of their life tap water\nis definitely one of them and the reason\nfor this is that um it contains you know\nhigh amounts of fluoride contains high\namounts of chlorine it also contains\nmicroplastics um very often now it\ncontains high levels of\n[Music]\nglyphosat-prozess step further and I do\nthis with entrepreneurs all the time I\nwas actually at a u uh an an event this\nweek with uh Damon John and and it was\nhigh level it Tuesday night yeah I was\ngoing to be there oh you were I was\ntraveling yeah I come there okay and\nthis isn't to pick on Damon he's a very\ngood friend of mine I love Damon he's\ndone a lot for me and he's um and he's\njust an incredible entrepreneur and uh\nhe's been a very very good friend to me\nbut we were um in a room with um you\nknow\nentrepreneurs and if you went around\nthat room\nand we asked several of them what's more\nimportant to you your business or your\nhealth and they'd say my health um but\nthen you bring them up and you say um\nwell you know how much money did your\nbusiness make last month\n$628,000 um what was your net income\n142,500 how many employees do you have\num 17 what's your hog glob and\nA1C like right what is your where your\ntestosterone levels blank right so so\ntrue we Our intention is to put our\nhealth first but our activity is is is\nvery different right and and I could\nhave asked them 15 more questions about\ntheir income statement their balance\nsheet their p&l the best marketing\nstrategy where they're getting the ROI\nwhat their you know what their best\nreturn is on Facebook ads or any number\nof other things and they would have hit\nevery one of those metrics don't know if\nthey have a clinical deficiency in\nvitamin D3 or not they don't even have\nthe most basic of information and so\nthis goes back to you know we we need to\nput a an imaginary fence around\nourselves and start filtering things\nbefore they make it to the temple just\nconsciously being intentional about what\nwe're letting into the temple it's very\neasy for me to look at food and say um\nare you going to serve me or are you\ngoing to steal from me because if you're\ngoing to steal from me I'm not going to\nlet you into the temple you wouldn't\nknowingly let a thief into your house\nright so tap water is one of these\nthings um you know there um fluoride\nwhich we know is neurotoxic and if you\ndon't believe fluoride is neurotoxic\njust find a you know just find a uh you\nknow a fluoride toothpaste label in your\nhouse if you're using Crest or Colgate\nor any toothpaste with fluoride and flip\nit over and look at the back because\nthere's a required FDA warning on there\nand it says if more than an amount used\nfor brushing is swallowed contact Poison\nControl immediately It also says keep\nOut Of Reach of children um under six\nyears of age um and it also says do not\nuse more than a p sized amount so if you\nswallow more than a p sized amount of\nfluoride toothpaste you are supposed to\ncontact Poison Control immediately you\nwill get four times that amount of\nfluoride in 6 8 oun glasses of water so\nwhy wouldn't I call Poison Control at\nthe end of every day when I'm drinking\n68 oun glasses of water I according to\nthe previous disclosure I should call\nPoison Control at the end of every day\nand let them know I've been microp\npoisoned there is a um an interesting um\nuh study that was published by the\nnational toxicology program in in in\nMarch of 2023 and they they were able to\npull this data um from the CDC through a\nthrough a Freedom of Information Act\nlawsuit and what it found was in 52 of\nthe 54 Min uh uh studies that they\nreviewed and in nearly every\nmunicipality in America that had\nfluoridated water they found an inverse\nrelationship between IQ and fluoride so\nin other words as fluoride went up IQ\nwent down so the more fluoride in the\nwater the lower the prepubescent IQ and\nif that's not enough data ask we have to\nask ourselves where do fluoride come\nfrom well fluoride is fluosilicic acid\nfluosilicic acid is a byproduct of\nphosphate fertilizer production it's\nalso a byproduct of aluminum production\nbut the majority of the fluoride that we\nuse in Municipal Water Supplies comes\nfrom phosphate fertilizer production it\nis the waste from phosphate fertilizer\nproduction because if we leave it in in\nphosphate fertilizer it burns the root\nof plant and actually so so we can't\nkeep it in because it kills the plant so\nwe take it out and we have a big\nstockpile of fluosilicic acid so what\nare we going to do with it well let's\ndump it into the Municipal Water Supply\nbecause there is\nmarginal and I would call it weak\nevidence that we can\nremineralize the enamel with fluoride\nand stop tooth decay which you can also\ndo with hydroxy appetite and other\nthings that are safe and um so we dump\nthis into the water supply but now the\nevidence is clear that this\nneurotoxin in small doses over time it's\nnot the dosage determining the poison it\nis the cumulative dosage determining the\npoison um and and one of the challenges\nthat I find with a lot of government\nregulatory guidelines is that there are\nsafe levels of Mercury right there are\nsafe levels of fluoride there are safe\nlevels of cyanide um but our bodies\nclear these at different levels nobody\ngot mercury poisoning from one piece of\ntuna fish right they got mercury\npoisoning because they ate you know\nsmall doses of mercury over a prolong\nperiod of time so fluoride is one of\nthose things tap water is definitely one\nof those things to permanently get out\nof your life I use something called an\nan echo water filter um and uh it's a\nfour-stage AR filter and then it\nactually adds um hydrogen uh to to the\nwater on the way out um and because the\nwater is Dem mineralized I just\nremineralize it with a with a salt\ncalled Baja gold salt but you could also\nuse Celtic sea salt I like this Baja go\nbecause it has all 91 trace minerals and\nthey test it for microplastics and\nwhatnot but just about every grocery\nstore chain in the world has Celtic salt\nso you could four stage AR filter your\nwater add Celtic or Baja gold Sea Salt\nto your water to remineralize it um and\nyou're covering the basis of of not\nmissing one of the 91 nutrients 16 of\nwhich are essential for human function\namazing what a great answer I'm hoping\nno one please stop drinking tap water\nyeah yeah please it is the worst thing\ndaily call to the you know daily call to\npoison control yeah poison control I\nmean that is like you know you just\nthink about just these things that we're\nso conditioned to do on a daily basis\nand we're like ah this doesn't me it I\ndon't feel any different and then it\njust adds up and accumulates why would I\nwant to put something into my mouth\nconsciously that if I swallow it I have\nto call it poison control center for\ntotally and then you think well how much\nis being absorbed through my gums how\nmuch you know the thinnest skin in the\nin your body is on the floor of your\nmouth and it is fraught with blood\nvessels one of the best delivery\nmechanisms besides the you know oral the\nfirst pass metabolism is sublingual um\nso so now I'm drinking tap water all day\nand then I'm sublingually and then you\nknow the second thing that's in there is\nchlorine and I did a really interesting\nvideo on my Instagram the other day and\npeople it really made an impact a ripple\neffect I went to the faucet and I filled\nup two glasses with tap water clear um\nglasses with tap water and just set them\non my counter and I have my um one of my\nheads of production just take four\nfingers and hold them down in one of the\nglasses and he held them there for about\na minute um and he took his fingers out\nand by the way you can do this um the\nkit to do this you can order on Amazon\nfor six bucks and then I took a chlorine\ntesting kit and I put drops of chlorine\nin in one glass and I put drops or drops\nof the chlorine tester in in the other\nglass one of them tested very high for\nchlorine one of them tested as having no\nchlorine and so the question is where\ndid the chlorine go well it was absorbed\ninto a skin in just that 60c period wow\nand so that's how good the that that\ntransdermal it will absorb that chlorine\nand you can do that you can get a\nchlorine testing kit for about six bucks\non Amazon just try it take your Tapo\nyou'll never drink it again take two\nglasses of tap water fill it up put it\non your counter put your fingers down in\none glass of tap water for 60 seconds\ntake them out and test both for chlorine\nyou'll find whatever glass you put your\nfingers and tests for no chlorine now\nimagine that's fluoride microplastics\nand other things\nand and you know when we talk about\nplastic bottles and microplastics you\nknow BPA the bisphenols um these these\nbpas were um until the 60s they were\nused as a synthetic estrogen so it was\nused in female hormone therapy labor\ninduction um um and other forms of\nfemale hormone therapy now how some\nscientists with way too much time on his\nhands realize that if you actually mix a\npetroleum based product with this\nsynthetic estrogen um this b f all this\nBPA that you'll make the surface of the\nplastic more viscous um and therefore\nyou know like oils and Waters and fluids\nand things won't stick to it um how they\nfigure that out I'm not sure I'm not\nsure how that combination occurred but\nmake no mistakes the bpas are synthetic\nestrogens um and there's some\nindications that there is enough BPA\ninside of the lining of a of a non-bpa\nfree can of like um tomato paste for\nexample which acidic Foods leech it out\nheat leeches it out to actually shift a\nwoman's menstrual cycle so from\novulation to or folicular to ovulation\nso imagine that you could actually just\nbe eating of food with enough bisphenols\nin it that not disclosed on the label\nthat you don't know are in there because\nit's leeching from the plastic to\nactually shift your menstrual cycle that\nis astounding to me and so um yeah\nplastic plastic bottles is one that I\nwould try to get out as much as you can\ntoo Gary I love we have
