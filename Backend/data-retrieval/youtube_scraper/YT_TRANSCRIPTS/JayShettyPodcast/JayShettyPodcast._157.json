    "transcript": "the more glucose spikes you have the\nfaster you age wow and this shows on\nyour skin and your organs slowly age\ntoday three out of five people are going\nto die of an inflammation based disease\nif you want a healthy body a healthy\nmind you need to make sure you're not on\na glucose roller coaster your body\ndoesn't care whether sugar came from an\norange juice or whether sugar came from\na beetroot and is now in a can of\nCoca-Cola those sugar molecules will\nboth lead to a glucose\nSpike before we jump into this episode\nI'd like to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nshett J shett the one the only J shett\nwhat is glucose and why is it important\nto understand it I love this question so\nglucose is also called blood sugar right\nand glucose is your body's favorite\nsource of energy so make a fist right\nnow with your hand okay so as you're\ndoing this the muscles in your hand are\nburning glucose to contract and for\neverybody listening to us right now the\ncells in your brain are currently\nburning glucose to understand what we're\nsaying right every single part of your\nbody is burning glucose every nanc to\nkeep you alive and as human beings the\nmain way that we provide this very\nimportant glucose to our body is by\neating Foods specifically by eating two\ncategories of foods starches so that's\nbread pasta rice potatoes oats and\nsugars anything that tastes sweet from\nan apple to my favorite triple layered\nchocolate cake okay so we eat starches\nand sugars and we give glucose to our\nbody so you might think okay I want lots\nof energy who doesn't want energy so if\nglucose is my body's energy I should\ngive my body as much glucose as possible\nI should eat as many starches and sugar\nas as possible well that's actually not\nthe case I love to take the image of a\nplant do you have any plants at Home\nmany okay so you know that in order to\nkeep a plant alive you need to give the\nplant some water but what happens if you\ngive the plant too much water it dies\nexactly and the human body is similar\nsome glucose everything's going great\ntoo much glucose and problems start\nhappening most of us are giving our\nbodies too much glucose and this leads\nto whole bunch of symptoms cravings for\nsweet Foods chronic fatigue brain fog\ninflammation faster aging hormonal\nissues and then longterm the development\nof type 2 diabetes so so my whole\npurpose is to teach people how to eat\nthe foods that they love the starches\nand the sugars in a way that's not going\nto cause problems so how do you keep\neating the spaghetti and the cookies and\nthe bread in a way that is not going to\ndamage your health that's the whole\nthing and that's what I really\nappreciate about your work and why I'm\nexcited about this conversation because\nI think a lot of us think oh no I have\nto cut things out completely or oh no\nI'm going to have to completely shift\neverything and actually you're saying\nthere's maybe that is the case actually\nlet's go there yeah let's talk about\nthat is there a need what is it that\nneeds to be fully cut out are there\nthings that we need to definitely avoid\nin those two buckets that you just\nshaped for us well we really don't need\nsugar we don't need to eat sweet Foods\nat all it's really just for pleasure\nyour body doesn't need that amount of\nglucose that amount of sugar so when we\neat sweet stuff whether it's fruit or\nchocolate cake we're doing it because it\nreleases dopamine in our brain dopamine\nis the pleasure hormone so sugars we\ncould do without but listen I want a\nchocolate cake for my birthday I don't\nwant to eat broccoli for my birthday you\nknow and it's all around us sugar is\ndelicious it brings us this pleasure so\nof course if you could completely cut it\nout it would be better for your health\nbut I don't think that's realistic for\nmost people I don't have that kind of\nwillpower and I haven't seen you must\nknow people who have completely cut out\nsugar but it's quite difficult what\nabout you what's your sugar consumption\nlike so I'm an extremist which means I\neither I'm eating no sugar so when I was\na monk I didn't eat sugar for three\nyears but then I can easily drop back\ninto eating sugar every day because my\nmother raised me as someone who ate a\nchocolate bar a chocolate biscuit a\nchocolate yogurt and a chocolate ice\ncream every day growing up my chocolate\nbrother yes I when you mentioned that\nchocolate Triple A Cake and you po I'm\nlike that is my dream and I have had to\nthrough my wife's coaching through your\nwork had to develop a healthier\nrelationship with sugar because I\nbelieve a few years ago I was genuinely\naddicted to sugar and I want to talk to\nyou about that and for me it's taken a\nlot of retraining a lot of steps in\nbetween where now I'm back being the\nextremist where I'm not eating uh\nrefined sugars at the moment but at the\nsame time I would allow myself on my\nbirthday or an occasion to allow myself\nto enjoy and indulge I've just I was\nwearing a glucose\nmonitor for about 3 to 6 months like\nlast year and I was shocked I was\nabsolutely surprised at the types of\nthings that spiked my glucose levels I\nwould eat a nonsugar cereal as a test\nand that would take it to bad\nimmediately not even average it was bad\nimmediately on the glucose levels talk\nto us about glucose spikes and why are\npeople measuring their glucose level\nwhat does that show us and what are we\ntrying to get our glucose to map so when\nwe eat a meal or food that contains a\nlot of glucose so for example a\nchocolate cake is a is a good option\ngood example or a plate of pasta or\nanything else that starts you sweet when\nwe deliver that glucose very quickly to\nour body we experience what's called a\nglucose Spike which means just a rapid\nincrease in how much glucose is in your\nbody and if you're wearing a glucose\nmonitor you will see this it will look\nlike this mountain that's just rising\nand rising and rising and then it\ncrashes you don't need to wear at\nglucose monitor to understand the\nbenefits of my work by the way but it's\na cool visual tool so what happens in\nyour body when we we Spike why is it bad\nfor us there are three main mechanisms\nthat are going on on a physiological\nlevel that make these spikes damaging\nthe first one has to do with our\nmitochondria the mitochondria are the\nPowerHouse of the cell most people\nremember that from biology class so your\nmitochondria are these little factories\ninside your cells that are responsible\nfor turning glucose molecules into\nenergy okay they're incredibly important\nthe problem is when you give them a\nglucose Spike so when you deliver them a\nbunch of glucose molecules very quickly\nthey break down they kind of go on\nstrike you know it's like when you have\nso much to do on your to-do list that\nyou're just like I can't do anything I\nhave to go nap that's the feeling they\nget they're like overwhelmed by all\nthese glucose molecules and they cannot\ndo their job properly anymore and so\nwhat happens you feel this as fatigue so\nyou keep eating this sugar and these\ncarbs but you're exhausted you wake up\nin the morning you're tired going to the\ngrocery store is exhausting playing with\nyour kids is draining your mitochondria\nare not functioning properly anymore and\nthat's why one of the main symptoms of\nhaving glucose spikes which most of us\nhave is this sense of chronic fatigue\nnow the second thing that happens in our\nbody when we Spike has to do with\ncooking\nso you know if you put something in the\noven like a chicken and it goes from\npink to Brown the chicken has cooked and\nthe Browning process is called glycation\nthe chicken has glycated it has cooked\nnow a human being from the moment we're\nborn we're slowly cooking we're slowly\nglycating I know it sounds weird but\nit's true for example if you look at the\ncartilage of babies it's white but if\nyou look at the cartilage of somebody\nwho's 100 years old the cartilage is\nbrown we glycate we Brown as we age and\nso much so that glycation is actually\npretty similar to aging and then when\nwe're fully glycated when we're fully\ncooked when we're fully aged we die so\nglycation is a process that we can't\nstop We Can't Stop aging you know\nthere's billionaires trying to reverse\naging but so far they haven't been able\nto but we can slow it down or speed it\nup and glucose Spikes have something to\ndo with this right glucose and glycation\nkind of sound like similar words it's\nbecause it is the glucose that is doing\nthe glycating the Aging yep the cooking\nthe cooking so the more glucose spikes\nyou have the faster you age wow and this\nshows on your skin wow you get more\nwrinkles and your organs slowly age as\nwell so that's the second thing I had no\nidea yep I did not know that yep wow mhm\nmhm and the third thing that happens\nwhen we have a glucose Spike well all of\nthese processes so the mitochondria and\nthe glycation they also increase\ninflammation and inflammation is just a\nnasty thing in the human body it causes\nlots and lots of issues today three out\nof five people are going to die of an\ninflammation based disease so\ninflammation is not good you want to\nbring that down and the third thing that\nhappens when we have a glucose spike is\nthat your body knows that these spikes\nare not good for you your body when it\nsenses this big glucose\nit calls your pancreas and it's like hey\nwe need to get this glucose down so your\npancreas sends out a hormone called\ninsulin and insulin is amazing and she\ngrabs all the excess glucose molecules\nand stashes them away into your liver\ninto your muscles and into your fat\ncells and that's one of the ways that we\ngain fat on our body but then too much\ninsulin over time that's the reason we\nget type two diabetes so essentially you\nhave mitochondria fatigue glycation\ninflammation diabetes IES and then a\nwhole bunch of other symptoms you might\nfeel depending on your personal health\nhistory like brain fog like hormonal\nissues that could lead to infertility\netc etc basically what I'm saying Jay is\nthat if you want a healthy body a\nhealthy mind you need to make sure\nyou're not on a glucose roller coaster\nbecause otherwise it's going to be very\ndifficult for your body to function and\nfor you to feel your best if you're\nexperiencing glucose spikes on a daily\nbasis what are some of the Hidden\nplaces glucose is that we may not see or\nmay not understand that we can't figure\nout on a day-to-day basis because I feel\nlike when I went to that test of the no\nsugar cereal in my head that didn't have\nglucose only for me to understand it was\nthe rice that it was made from that was\nhaving that impact on me so where is are\nthere any others that you know that are\nhidden actually breakfast food is\nusually a top offender right so orange\njuice fruit smoothies breakfast cereal\neven if they say no sugar or low in\nsugar that doesn't mean they don't\ncontain glucose it just means they don't\ncontain any table sugar but they could\nalso contain sugar from fruit which is\nquote unquote natural so it doesn't have\nto be claimed as an added sugar in a\npackage right breakfast foods huge huge\nhuge offenders um and then kind of like\nfunny things that you wouldn't expect\nlike eating a lot of\ngrapes yeah if you eat 50 grapes that's\nactually a lot of sugar because the\nfruit that we eat today has been bred to\nbe extremely high in sugar and\nconcentrated in sugar but I think\nbreakfast foods are one of the biggest\nones oh also dried fruit people don't\nrealize that it's not because something\ncomes from fruit that it's good for you\ndried fruit or fruit smoothie or fruit\njuice can contain you know tens and tens\nof grams of sugar even though it\noriginally came from a fruit but your\nbody doesn't care whether sugar came\nfrom an orange juice and is now in an\norange juice or whether sugar came from\na beetroot and is now in a can of\nCoca-Cola right those sugar m molecules\nwill both lead to a glucose Spike yeah\nand it's interesting because I think the\nway we've been trained to have a sweet\nbreakfast I've switched to savory\nbreakfast last year and that's something\nyou are a big big bigon yeah talk to us\nabout that switch well listen the\nglucose Spike that we experience after\nbreakfast is going to control the rest\nof our day so if you eat in the morning\nsomething that is pure glucose like most\nof us do right I grew up on orange juice\nand Nutella crepes so I know sounds\namazing it was amazing but then at 10:30\nI was exhausted because I was crashing\nmy glucose levels were crashing and I\nwas super super hungry because after a\nbig spike you experience a big crash and\nthat crash activates the craving Center\nin your brain and literally tells you\nJay go find some chocolate you know and\nyou cannot resist what that voice sounds\nlike and you can't resist that urge so\nyour breakfast if you're having a big\nglucose bike at breakfast you're setting\nyourself up for a day of Cravings\nfatigue inflammation and you're going to\nfeel quite awful an important switch to\nmake is to switch from a sweet breakfast\nto a savory breakfast built around\nprotein right whatever kind of protein\nyou like maybe it's Dairy maybe it's\ntofu maybe it's protein powder maybe\nit's leftover fish from last night maybe\nit's eggs whatever kind of protein you\nwant that's going to keep your glucose\nlevels nice and steady add some healthy\nfats in there and you can have some\nstarch like a slice of bread for Taste\nbut importantly a Savory breakfast\ncontains nothing sweet it except if you\nwant some for Taste some whole fruit\nright and you know all those sweet\nbreakfast foods that you love you don't\nhave to say goodbye to them completely\nthe best time to have them is for\ndessert after lunch or after dinner\nbecause if you eat something that\ncontains a lot of glucose something\nstarchy or sweet after a meal the\nglucose molecules are not going to\narrive as quickly into your bloodstream\nbecause that's already going to be food\nin your stomach the worst time to eat\nstarches and sugars is breakfast because\nyour body is super empty so anything you\neat goes to your bloodstream in a second\nright but it's actually the meal of the\nday where most of us eat just starches\nand sugars yeah think about the typical\nbreakfast orange juice oats with honey\non them breakfast cereal you know fruit\nsmoothies oatmeal with raisins exactly\nand then you wonder why most of us feel\nso terrible throughout the day why it's\n400 p.m. and we're exhausted and we need\ncoffee or Red Bull we have cravings all\nthroughout the day and even at night\nyour breakfast controls how you feel for\nthe whole day and I think switching from\na sweet breakfast to a savory breakfast\nis almost like you know in the movies\nwhen they go through the mirror it's a\nparallel universe yeah and you really\nfeel so different absolutely so so so\ndifferent all of a sudden you have\nsteady energy your brain is clear you\nfeel good you feel like yourself you're\nnot controlled you're not a victim to\nthese Cravings anymore yeah I found\nthough that as someone who has had\ncravings for a long time or lived in\nthat sweet cycle there's been a lot of\nwithdrawal symptoms I think when people\nstop eating sugar I've definitely\nexperienced headaches I think some\npeople experience very low energy\nsomeone was telling me earlier today\nthat they feel nauseous or or sick like\nthere's a lot of different things that\ncome with it talk to us about why it's\nso addictive yeah obviously beyond the\nfact that we love the taste of it why is\nit so addictive and how does it cause\nthose symptoms I think what you're\ntalking about is if somebody goes cold\nturkey and just completely Cuts things\nout and that's not actually something\nthat I recommend I think that again like\nI don't have that kind of willpower um\nand I want to help people improve their\nhealth without having to give up the\nsugar so even if you delay the sugar\nfrom breakfast to after lunch as dessert\nyou're not going to get all those\nwithdrawal symptoms you're still going\nto be able to enjoy it and get the\ndopamine but with less impact in your\nglucose levels and listen sugar is\naddictive right and that\ndopamine is very very very very\naddictive and as human beings eating\nsomething sweet is a very easy way to\nget a hit now what you're talking about\ncan also be due to if somebody\ncompletely cuts out carbs so starches\nand sugars completely let's say from\ntoday to tomorrow you cut out all carbs\nthat can cause issues because if you've\nbeen eating carbs your whole life your\nbody expects these carbs every two to\nthree to four hours and your body is\nactually just burning glucose for energy\nso all of a sudden you cut off its\nsupply of glucose and it becomes a\nlittle bit stressed out especially if\nyour body's not used to also burning fat\nfor fuel in a healthy body you can\nswitch from burning glucose for energy\nto burning fat for energy easily so\neither you eat glucose and your body\ngets energy that way or you're not\neating and your body's burning fat in\nmost of us we're eating every two to\nthree to four hours some carbs and so\nour body doesn't know how to burn fat\nfor fuel anymore it doesn't have that\nmuscle so so the idea is to train it\nslowly to be able to do that not to just\ncut out completely the glucose you know\ncut the grass from under the foot too\nquickly that's going to be difficult\nyeah and I think that's one of the\nbiggest challenges right because when it\ncomes to New Year resolutions or when it\ncomes to changing habits we often think\nwe have to go in or out I hate that and\ndiets you know they don't work they're\nsuper stressful they're actually a\npretty strong way to control women like\nI have been from from the moment I was a\nteenager the magazines are telling you\nlose five pounds in a day you know lose\nyour belly before summer you're\nbombarded by these messages that make\nyou feel inadequate if you're not on a\ndiet I mean it's pretty messed up the\namount of fat on your body or how much\nyou weigh is not a good representation\nof the internal health of your body\nright absolutely and if you're just\nfocusing on I want to lose weight I want\nto lose weight there are very unhealthy\nways to do that that might actually make\nyour health way worse what I like to\nteach people is these simple hacks so\nsave breakfast is very important one\neating sugar as dessert instead of on an\nempty stomach is another key one and\nthese hacks are going to help your body\non the long term and create Better\nHealth from within and you might lose\nweight for example in my experiment\nabout half the people lost some fat on\ntheir body without trying to without\ncounting calories without cutting out\nFoods just because naturally that's\nwhere their body wanted to be and it\nreadjusted right but the objective is\nnot weight loss the objective is being\ncraving free and not feeling victim to\nfinding sugar three times a day or not\nvictim to the pot of ice cream at the\nback of your freezer after dinner good\nenergy so you can actually live the life\nyou want to live and go after your\ndreams you know that's the point and\nplay with your kids and have time for\nyourself and then improving any medical\ncondition you might have from mental\nhealth to infertility to diabetes weight\nloss consequence but it's not the whole\npoint it's not a diet you know yeah and\nit's a different shift in mindset really\nbecause you're saying that a lot of us\nare addicted to weight loss weight gain\nor or something like that and you're\nactually saying well let's make it about\nenergy let's make it about Focus let's\nmake it about make health health yeah\nyeah which is which is which we just\nhaven't been trained to think that way\nyou know we haven't even I grew up\nalways feeling like oh if I didn't put\non weight then I must be healthy and\nthat's such a I mean it's such a\nrudimentary belief around what health\nand well-being is absolutely and it's\nshifting you know we're now\nunderstanding that's not the way to go\nwe need to focus on health not body size\nor abolutely body weight absolutely what\nshould someone eat at 300 p.m. when\nthey're tired because everyone has that\npost lunch you know\nslump slump they do but it actually can\ngo away if you study your glucose levels\nand if you no longer have these spikes\nyou don't have to feel that postmeal\nslump anymore because generally that\nslump comes from your glucose having\nspiked and now dropping because after\nevery Spike there's a drop and this drop\ncan make you feel really really really\ntired so if you feel those symptoms of\nthe postmeal crash the best thing to do\nis to start with your breakfast so have\na savory breakfast then the second thing\nI would recommend is at that at\nlunchtime make sure that you start your\nmeals with a specific type of ingredient\nthat is going to help balance your\nglucose levels and before I tell you\nwhat that is I want to tell you about\nthis amazing research study Jay so\nresearchers looked at a meal and they\nfound that if participants ate the\nelements of that meal in a specific\norder they could reduce the glucose\nSpike of the meal by up to\n75% huge that's huge without changing\nhow much they're eating without changing\nwhat they're eating overall just by\nchanging the order and when I was in\nschool I remembered uh biology teachers\ntelling us oh when you eat it all\nbecomes a big soup in your stomach\nand so I thought how is this possible\nhow can the order in which you eat the\nelements of meal have an impact so the\nresearch is fantastic it turns out that\nwhen you start your meals with\nvegetables the fiber in the veggies when\nyou eat it first has time to coat your\nupper intestine and create a sort of\nprotective mesh okay like a shield on\nthe walls of your intestine and that\nShield then slows down how quickly the\nthe rest of the meal is going to access\nyour bloodstream how quickly the\nmolecules from the rest of the meal are\ngoing to make their way into your\nbloodstream and so veggies first is this\nvery important hack now the scientist\nalways eat my veggies last really\nbecause you hated them yeah because\nyou're right you eat all the Cobbs First\nand all the rest of it like oh yeah and\nyou know actually so when you go to\nrestaurants they often give you bread at\nthe beginning of the meal yeah and\nactually it's pretty smart so I think\nthere's a whole conspiracy here because\nif you give people some bread at the\nbeginning of your meal so you're super\nhungry you eat the bread bread is starch\nit turns to glucose so very quickly you\nexperience this glucose Spike and about\n90 minutes later you're crashing and\nthat's when the waiter comes over and is\nlike hi anybody would like some dessert\nand at that point you're feeling this\nintense craving for sugar because of\nthat glucose drop so you're going to\norder dessert wow that that makes sense\nto me I love bread at the St and end but\nthe best thing to do actually is to\ndelay that bread and first have your\nveggies and then have your main dish and\nhave the bread you know during the main\ndish or after the main dish and that way\nyou can still enjoy the bread but the\nglucose molecules are going to be\nprotected by that fiber mesh and not\ngoing to create that big of a spike so\nyou won't feel those Cravings 90 minutes\nlater you won't feel the energy crash so\nthat's another super important hack and\nif you do nothing else just at your next\nmeal eat what you would normally eat\njust add a plate of vegetables to the\nbeginning of your meal and it can be\nthree baby carrots it can be some\nbeautiful roed cauliflower with tahini\nor whatever it can be some salad it can\nbe any sort of veggies you have in your\nfridge and tomatoes count as well and\nyou'll see how different you feel after\nthe meal no crash no cravings and you\nknow you're also helping your body\nbecome healthier from within and\ninterestingly Jay this hack actually has\na lot of parallels in cultural habits so\nyou know I'm French and in France we\nhave this tradition of crud at the\nbeginning of a meal which is raw veggies\nin Italy they have antipasti which is\ngenerally vegetables at the beginning of\nthe meal in the Middle East you usually\nstart your meals with herbs eaten by the\nbunch MH so none of the stuff I'm\ntalking about is that revolutionary it's\nkind of common sense but we've lost\ntouch with these traditions and now we\nunderstand the science behind them so I\nwant us to bring them back yeah that's\nspectacular there was a study you were\nabout to quote and then I cut you off\ntell me with my I don't know you were\nabout to say and the study says and then\nI said I used to eat my vegetables L I\ndon't know what that was I think I was\njust talking about the food order so 75%\nand so ideally from a scientific\nstandpoint you would always start your\nmeals with the veggies then the proteins\nand the fats and then the carbs last the\nstarches and sugars last now you know\nthat's a scientific theory and if you\nwant to decompose your meal and do that\nspecific order you can but I think from\nthis science we can just extract the\nmost important piece of information\nwhich is veggies first and the carbs\ntowards the end of the meal to reduce\nthe spike I think that's so practical I\nthink all of us can at least do that\nwith whatever's on our plates and if we\ncan just make that shift today we're\ngoing to start to see the benefit and\nthat will hopefully push us in that\ndirection exactly and then naturally you\ncrave less sugar and you feel better and\nit's these small tweaks and you don't\nhave to cut out Foods we're not talking\nabout restricting how much you're eating\nI'm actually telling you to add food to\nyour meal and that is going to improve\nyour health so veggies first that's\nanother very key hack that I recommend\npeople try out how off is the\nrecommended daily amount of grams of\nsugar on any given packages right so if\nyou look at any processed food or any\npackaged food it will say this is 30% of\nyour daily amount how wrong is the daily\namount well so the American Heart\nAssociation recommends no more than 25\ngram of added sugar I think for women\nand 50 grams for men something like that\nbut we don't need any of this sugar we\ndon't need to eat any sweet stuff at all\nyour body does not need sugar to live so\nthat is an upper limit if you will yeah\nthat's an upper limit we're seeing it as\nthe basic requirement it's like saying\nuh I don't know three cigarettes are\nallowed a day it's like it doesn't mean\nyou should smoke cigarettes it means\nlike that's the upper limit after which\nreal problems start happening but it's\nbetter to have\nzero but then what these recommendations\ndon't take into account is when are you\neating the sugar is it first thing in\nthe morning so you're increasing\ninflammation brain fog increasing risk\nof diabetes hurting your mitochondria\nhaving cravings aging faster or is it\nafter a lunch that had fiber at the\nbeginning of a meal where the impact is\ngoing to be way less hardcore in your\nhealth so if you if you just keep eating\nthe same amount of sugar as you're\neating but you just change when you're\neating it that's the first step you're\nalready going to see a big impact on\nyour health MH and then Second Step\ncould be reducing amounts for sure and\nnaturally because you're not creating\nthat cycle of\naddiction you're going to have fewer\ncravings for the sugar anyway there's\nthis other really cool study I want to\ntell you about so scientists put\nparticipants in an fmri scanner you know\nthose big donut scanners okay so they\nwere looking at their brain activity and\nas the participants were in the scanner\nthere was a screen in front of their\neyes and the screen showed images of\nfood chocolate cake Donuts broccoli\nBurger Etc and the scientist asked the\nparticipants to rate how much they\nwanted to eat that food from 1 to 10\nokay like one is like I don't care 10 is\nlike I want to eat this right now and\nthe participants were hooked up to a\nmachine that was measuring their glucose\nlevels in real time and this is what the\nscientists found they found that when\npeople's glucose levels were steady they\nwere rating all the foods like fiveish\nBurger fiveish broccoli fiveish so you\nknow no particular Cravings but then\nwhen the participants glucose levels\nwere dropping two things happened first\nthing on the brain scan the craving\nCenter was activating and second thing\nthey started rating all of the sweet\nFoods really highly okay and that just\ngoes to show that you cannot control\nthese Cravings they come from a deep\npart of your brain that goes on to alert\nmode when your glucose levels are\ncrashing because it is a dangerous thing\nfor the body right your body doesn't\nknow that that crash came from a spite\ncuz you just ate 15\nDonuts your body thinks it's low on\nenergy yeah um and so all this to say\nthat as you study your glucose levels\nthis craving Center will activate less\nand less so naturally you're not going\nto want to eat as much sugar and you're\ngoing to switch from a situation in\nwhich you were controlled by those\nCravings to a situation in which you'll\neat the sugar you really like for\npleasure for enjoyment without feeling\ncontrolled M so instead of feeling like\noh my God I need to eat something sweet\nright now give me anything any chocolate\nbar it's more like hm you know what\ntomorrow I want to go to my favorite\nBakery and get my favorite pastry you\nknow from a sense of like agency tot and\nstrength and boundaries versus being a\nvictim to that sugar addiction yeah you\ncan you can have that delayed\ngratification exactly exactly no that's\nhuge I mean two things that really\nhelped me with this and I notice when\nI'm weaker and this obviously happens\nwith the amount of travel I do and I\ntotally notice how that impacts my\ndesire for more sugar and I found that\none of the biggest commitments I had to\nmake was eating my meals on time every\nday and that started to reduce craving\nso when I was having breakfast at a\ncertain time lunch at a certain time and\ndinner at a certain time I found myself\nhaving less cravings and filling the\ngaps with less sugar when I was missing\nbreakfast I was missing lunch and then I\nwas trying to make up for it then i'\nwould be willing to take anything as\nyou're saying and the second thing I\nfound was when I had poor sleep when I\nwas sleeping badly or I wasn't sleeping\nenough I would wake up craving sugar to\nwant to get me to the next meal and then\nnaturally I'm going to have all these\nthings that aren't great for me because\nI just haven't slept well and I found\nthat those two things had a massive\nimpact but how is what you're saying\nhaving an impact on the other way so I'm\nsaying how these lifestyle choices\nimpact my glucose Cravings but how are\nour glucose levels impacting our well\nfor example sleep so sleep and glucose\nare go hand in hand and so what you're\ndescribing is if you wake up and you\nhaven't slept well you have more\ncravings and you know what else happens\nwhich is kind of unfortunate is that\nwhen your body is tired it cannot\nregulate your glucose levels as well so\nanything you eat will create a bigger\nglucose Spike right so for example if\nyou have that cake on a day when you're\nrested versus a day when you're super\nexhausted the exhausted day the cake\nwill make a bigger Spike you're eating\nthe same take but it's creating a bigger\nSpike therefore a bigger crash therefore\nmore cravings and so when we're tired we\ntend to crave more sweet foods and that\nthat makes a bigger Spike and a bigger\ndrop and then in turn being on a glucose\nroller coaster also makes your sleep\nthat night worse not as deep not as\nrestorative so you start this vicious\ncycle okay here's what to do to break\nthe cycle first of all use the hacks\nwhen you wake up right so if you're\ntired have a Savory breakfast\nsecond thing to sort of reset your\nglucose balance is to exercise even just\n5 minutes so next time you wake up and\nyou're tired do five minutes of jumping\njacks put on a YouTube video five\nminutes you know exercise anything\nthat's going to get your muscles working\nis going to help you manage your glucose\nlevels better that day and then as you\nstudy your glucose levels you will\nnotice you will sleep better and often\npeople will tell me that they used to\nwake up in the middle of the night with\na pounding heart you know sweats that\ncan be because your glucose levels are\ncrashing as you're sleeping wow yeah and\nthat's why in my study so many people\nimprove their sleep not by taking\nsleeping pills not by changing what's\nhappening in their bedroom just by\nchanging how they're eating everything\nis connected Jay you cannot just look at\none thing in isolation when you improve\nyour glucose levels so many systems in\nyour body improve it's remarkable so you\nmight be entering this because you want\nless inflammation or fewer cravings but\nthen what happens is you realize oh my\nskin is better oh I sleep better oh my\nmood has improved you know all these\namazing side effects it's really\nbeautiful to watch Yeah you mentioned\nmood there what's the connection between\nblood sugar levels and mental health\nbecause I think again even though we are\nmaking those connections now I think\noften we don't recognize how correlated\nour diet and our mental health is that's\nthe reason I got into this in the first\nplace so when I was a teenager I had an\naccident I broke my back jumping off a\nwaterfall had very intense surgery I\nhave lotss of metal in my back now and\nphysically I was fine because you\nrecover fast when you're that young but\nthen my mental health started going\nreally down the drain so anxiety\ndepression\ndepersonalization my I felt like my\nbrain was completely broken I didn't\nfeel like myself anymore and I went on a\njourney to try to understand how to get\nbetter and that's what got me studying\nbiochemistry that's what got me into\ngenetics and then almost 10 years after\nmy accident 10 years of Darkness I\nfinally had my first clue I was part of\na pilot experiment and during it I could\nwear a glucose monitor and I saw Jay\nthat the days where my glucose levels\nwere spiking and dropping a lot my\nmental health was worse and the days\nwhen my glucose levels were steady my\nmental health was so much better and\nthis changed everything for me because I\nhad been completely lost for the better\npart of a decade trying to understand\nwhat the heck I could do to improve my\nmental health and I was lost let me tell\nyou and nobody said oh you should look\nat your lifestyle but in that moment I\nremember that day I was feeling one of\nthese episodes come on of\ndepersonalization which is this horrible\nmix of brain fog feeling like a stranger\nin your own body I mean it's terrible\nand I scan my glucose monitor and I see\none of the biggest glucose spikes I had\never seen and so I started putting two\nand two together I said wait a minute is\nit possible that this glucose spike is\nactually causing this episode anyway so\nthat opened the gates really wide for me\nI was like wow this is fascinating and I\nstarted doing all the research I could\nand I I saw that I wasn't alone that\nmost people experience glucose spikes on\na daily basis even if they don't have\ndiabetes and that these spikes are\ncorrelated to all the things we spoke\nabout and to Mental Health M so as I\nstarted managing my glucose levels my\nmental health started improving and so\nwhat's the connection well the cells in\nyour brain also use glucose for energy\nand so you know those three things I\ntalked about the mitochondrial damage\nthe glycation the inflammation the\ninsulin your brain cells also feel these\nconsequences of spikes and we don't\nfully understand how the brain works but\nwe do understand that when these things\nhappen in the brain it's not\ngood we also know that glucose spikes\nimpact tyrosine levels and tyrosine is\nan important molecule that regulates our\nmood I want to talk you about another\nreally fun study can I okay yeah please\nfascinating so bless these scientists\nthey're so amazing okay so let me tell\nyou what this study is so scientists\nrecruited 200 married couples MH they\ngave each person in the couple a voodoo\ndoll representing their spouse wow I\nknow they told the married people to\nplease over the next six weeks put a pin\nin the voodoo doll every time your\nspouse annoys\nyou and then at the end of the six weeks\nthe scientist got all the voodo dolls\nback with all the pins in them and they\nmeasured the participants glucose levels\nthey found that the people who had the\nmost irregular glucose levels had put\nthe most pins in the voodoo doll\nrepresenting their spouse and that's\nwhere the tyus\nhypothesis started com coming up they\nsaw that being on a glucose Roc cooster\ncan impact how irritable you are how you\nsee those around you how nice you are\nhow triggered you are by your spouse so\nif you ever feel irritated agitated like\noh it's so annoying this person hate\nthem well maybe your glucose levels have\nsomething to do with it so whether\nyou're trying to improve irritability\nhungriness mental health anxiety\ndepression whatever managing your\nglucose level again is a key foundation\nin the house of your health yeah and for\nme like it wasn't everything right after\nI managed my glucose levels I had to go\nto therapy do EMDR do lots of other\nstuff but it gave me a foundation that\nwas so necessary as that first step yeah\nwell I think what you're laying up there\nfor us and that's definitely what I've\ndiscovered in my own journey of mental\nhealth and well-being is just that\nyou're just making it harder for\nyourself when you're not using\neverything at your disposal and I was\ndefinitely someone who had used\nmindfulness and meditation in order to\nmaster the mind but I didn't realize how\nhard that was when your body was slowing\nyou down and actually if your body was\nwith you the kind of Revelations and\nbreakthroughs you could have were\nLimitless but when your body wasn't with\nyou or for some people when their mind's\nnot with their body it slows you down\nand it makes everything so much harder\nand I couldn't recommend that more to\npeople like if you're someone who loves\nmeditating and you love mindfulness but\nyou're not taking care of your body and\nyou're not looking your glucose levels\nor your sleep take a look at it it's\nonly going to make you a better\nmeditator and if you're the other way\naround where you're like Jay this you\nknow the physical stuff for me is easy I\nfeel really fit and healthy it's really\nimportant to add the other side as well\nbecause you have no idea how good you\ncan feel it's all connected and to give\nyou another example um I've been\nrecently really into weightlifting so it\nfeels really good my body feels strong\nand I've noticed also my mental\nresilience has improved as my physical\nresilience has improved so I'm able to\nmanage stress better I feel stronger and\nthat's because you train your nervous\nsystem your body and your brain are\nconnected by your nervous system right\nand so when you improve your physical\nhealth your nervous system improves and\nyour mental health improves as well it's\nall it's all connected absolutely is\nthere a more ideal food before or after\nworkouts oh great question so this\nactually brings me to another hack which\nis the hack about movement so as your\nmuscles contract and as you exercise or\neven as your you're just you know\nwalking your muscles are burning glucose\nfor energy and we can use this\ninformation to our advantage so the hack\nI recommend is after eating one of your\nmeals a day after one of your meals a\nday use your muscles for 10 minutes go\nfor a walk play with your dog tidy your\napartment I'm a very messy person so I\ndo that one a lot tidy your apartment do\nsome calf raises if you're at your desk\nat work why not go to the gym you know\ngo weightlift because as you do this\nyour muscles are going to be using some\nof the glucose from the meal you just\nate M and if you're an athlete and\nyou're doing some very intense exercise\nyour body is going to use up most of the\nglucose from whatever you eat so the\nmore you exercise the more you can eat\nglucose before or even after actually um\nand you experience much less of a spike\nso if you want to eat a cookie or\nchocolate cake before after workout is\nactually a pretty good time to do it\nthat way a lot of the glucose will go to\nyour muscles instead of causing a that's\nwhat I've been trying to do so the\nreason I'm asking is for myself one of\nthe things I struggle with is usually\nI'll wake up I'll meditate in the\nmorning and then I'll drink a tea or\nsomething like that like a a warm herbal\ntea and then I'll go on a hike or I'll\ngo and work out because I've never\nreally found what to eat before my\nworkout that's great for me and then\nwhen I come back I'll eat breakfast I'll\nhave my Savory breakfast and I feel good\nand everything feels fine but I often\nwonder could I be doing something better\nbefore I go out on my hike which which\ncan be like it'll be 30 minutes normal\nand then 30 minutes intense incline if\nyou do eat something before going\nworking out maybe a banana or something\ndo you feel like you're able to work out\nbetter do you feel like you have more\nenergy more explosivity that's a great\nquestion I think I'd have to monitor\nthat to give you an like a honest answer\nand I would say that in the past I've\ntested things like dates but then I was\nworried that that was going to SP that's\nvery high in sugar exactly so I had that\nrecommendation from someone I tested it\nout I was like when I learned about\neverything to do with glucose I was like\nwait a minute that's probably not a good\nidea how intensely are you exercising\nare you just walking no so that's what I\nmean it's it's it's probably 30 minutes\nlike easy and then 30 minutes of like\nexplosive incline but it's not it's not\nhigh intensity in that it's not all fast\nit's self-paced but it is all uphill for\n30 minutes for example if I don't eat\nbefore I work out I don't perform as\nwell right because as you're eating\nsomething that contains glucose that's\ngoing to feed your muscles very easy\neasily accessible energy so you could do\nsome tests I I don't think dates are\nnecessary because they're very high and\nsugar but you could even try something\nlike you know a piece of sourdough bread\nright with an avocado on it or a a\nbanana with some Nut Butter you don't\nhave to have something so sweet and\nconcentrated as a date but do some tests\nsee what works for you now I know some\noptions yeah you could even I like the\navocado and S that's sounds you could do\nsome almonds um you could do yogurt with\nsome\nberries try some stuff out and see\nbecause you might find that you're\nactually walking faster yeah yeah yeah\nthat would be good for me yeah\ndefinitely sometimes about going up that\nhill going why am I doing this today so\nand and and I completely agree with and\nwould you say it's the same for weight\ntraining before weight training is that\nthe same typ of f big time Big Time\nespecially if you're doing something\nlike weight training which is you know\nmore explosive than walking or running\nyou have to really your muscle need to\nbe able to go P you know so yes\nabsolutely so my nutritionist put me\nonto this a couple of years ago and I\nhated it but then when I saw you like it\nwas one of your big pillars oh I know\nwhat you're about to say you know what\nI'm about to say yeah go on vinegar yes\nyeah so I was drinking a cup of vinegar\nlike the little whatever the shot of\nvinegar why a shot of vinegar before\ntell us well first of all a shot is not\ngood you should always dilute it because\nif it's a shot it's going to hurt your\nteeth I was literally doing a shot so\nI've got to change that you got to\nchange that it's a lot easier to dilute\nyeah okay so vinegar contains a\nwonderful molecule called acetic acid\nand acetic acid when you have some\nbefore a meal is going to slow down how\nquickly food breaks down into glucose in\nyour body so it's kind of like slowing\ndown digestion and this is really really\ngood it makes you feel Fuller full\nlonger and the glucose molecules arrive\nmore slowly into your blood and that's\nthe whole point so the heck is before a\nmeal that's going to be high in carbs\nhave one tablespoon of vinegar in a big\nglass of water I was not doing that 5 to\n10 minutes yeah well no wonder you\ndidn't like it if you had to do a shot\nlike gosh and it can be any type of\nvinegar apple cider vinegar white wine\nvinegar Cherry vinegar whatever you just\nwant to avoid the very syrupy like\nbalsamic glaze that one's no bueno\nbecause that's full of sugar this is an\neasy hack and again science has shown us\nthat this ingredient that most of us\nhave in our kitchen actually has a\nwonderful effect on our health and it's\nbeen used for m Mia I mean vinegar has\nbeen around forever but now we\nunderstand the science behind it it's a\ngreat hack and what what before every\nmeal or just lunch or is there a depends\non how you feel I recommend before the\nmeal of your day that's highest in sugar\nor starch right um and one of thing you\ncan do is you know how I was explaining\nveggies first is so important you don't\nhave to drink the vinegar you can also\nmake it into dressing oh I like the and\nput it on your veggies okay that's\nyou're making it easy now so you know\nthe salad with some vinegret dressing\nwonderful way to start your meals\nwonderful you get the fiber from the\nveggies making that mesh and you get the\nvinegar slowing down breakdown of food\nyou're golden got it okay now I can get\nback on it cuz I've been avoiding it it\nwas so hard I was like I have to ask you\nabout it today I'm not surprised I was\ndoing a shot of vinegar and and you're\nright about the teeth as well I'm so\nsorry that's terrible that's kind of\ngross iame it was really hard to have\nand yeah every time I'd have it it would\nalmost feel like it could start some\nreflux or it could have like uh you know\nthat's not great oh I'm sorry no no it's\ngood but as you can see this is another\nreally easy hack it it's free it doesn't\nask you to add any to remove anything\nyou're just adding stuff and helping\nyour body at the same time and then I\nlike to see these hacks as sort of an\non-ramp to freeway you know you kind of\nyou kind of get on them and then after a\nfew days you feel so much better and\neverything becomes easier in your life\nyeah no that's great what about for our\nsnackers our snackers that are listening\nwho are saying Jesse I love this advice\nI can do that for my but I'm a big\nsnacker and I turn towards I mean today\nif you look at it whether it's a protein\nbar but I guess protein bars is such a\ncommon go-to snack but they have really\nhigh sugar it depends on the bar yeah it\nreally depends so look at the\ningredients always and if you so when\nyou look at the ingredients list on the\nback of a product they are ordered by\nweight so if the first ingredient says\nsugar that means sugar is the most\nimportant ingredient in that product and\nthen they decrease right in in in weight\nso if you see in the first five\ningredients of anything whether it's a\nprotein bar or yogurt if there's any\ntype of sugar in the first five\ningredients then that product is\ndessert okay so if it says like that's\nsuch a great tip and it doesn't have to\nsay just sugar it can say something like\ndate puree honey dextrose fruit juice\nconcentrate it has in glucose Revolution\nI have the whole list but manufacturers\nuse lots of fancy words words to not\nmake it sound like just cane sugar but\nactually it's just cane sugar it's all\nthe same molecules right so sometimes\nyou could your body's not telling the\ndifference as you said no difference so\nthat's for the protein bars and then for\nthe snackers okay I have a hack that's\ncalled putting clothing on your\ncarbs anytime you eat carbs so carbs\nbeing starches or sugars make sure to\nnever eat them naked and by naked I mean\non their own mhm so never snack on just\na piece of bread or never snack on just\na cookie always add some clothing which\nmeans protein fat or Fiber which means\nfor example adding some avocado to the\nbread or some cheese which means for\nexample adding five almonds to the\ncookie or a Greek yogurt right so if you\nlove snacking remember this hack put\nclothing on your carbs never eat your\ncarbs naked that way you'll have less of\na glucose bike because the risk Jay is\nthat our snacks kick off that Cravings\nroller coaster because between meals our\nstomach is empty so same concept as for\nbreakfast you don't want to eat too much\nsweet stuff otherwise it's going to make\na big spike and you're not going to feel\nvery good 90 minutes later this is\nactually Genius Like if you're listening\nto this right now none of us have any\nexcuses to shift this around genuinely\nI'm listening to you just going thank\nyou like thank you so much because I\nthink it's so often when you're hearing\nabout how to change your diet and your\nfood it just sounds so hard and so\ncomplex and it feels like like God where\ndo I even start with this and and here\nwe are just making really basic\nconnections that that we can all do very\nvery simply and it helps you with your\nenergy with your mood with your skin but\nalso for serious health conditions like\ntype two diabetes this is the way out\nright if you have type two diabetes if\none of your parents Grandparents has it\nit can be quite challenging to know how\nto get out of it and it can feel like\neither I have to go on this extreme diet\nand never eat carbs ever again or I'll\ndo this medication and what I want to\noffer with these hacks is an easy way to\ntake back some control over your glucose\nlevels because type two diabetes is\nreversible it is not a genetic\nhereditary disease that you can't do\nanything about you can improve it I see\npeople put it into remission every\nsingle week using this work in concert\nwith their doctor of course but this is\nthe kind of stuff that can turn your\nhealth around and instead of getting\nsicker as you age your health can\nimprove as you age and don't we all want\nthat that's the dream you know\nabsolutely\nyeah absolutely in the book you about\nthere's some research that says that\neating fruit first in the without any\nother Foods is best for digestion would\neating it as a singular food first thing\nin the morning impact blood sugar like\nwhat's your take on that well you know\nthis this idea of oh if you eat fruit as\ndessert it's going to rotten your\nstomach or it's going to purify that's\nkind of a urban myth that's been\nfloating around so if you look at the\nideal food order from that science you\nshould eat the sugar last right and\nfruit is also in the sugar category and\nso how do you reconcile both of those\nthings and people have asked me a lot\nabout this concept of oh fruit for\ndessert is going to rot in your stomach\nturns out there's no scientific evidence\nto support that nothing can rot in your\nstomach nothing can purify in your\nstomach Sugar Sugar eaten last or fruit\neaten last does not do that okay now\neven though most of us think that a\npiece of fruit is Supernatural they're\nlike oh a banana or Peach like that's\nNature's Bounty turns out Jay the fruit\nthat we find today in supermarkets is\nactually not\nnatural humans are very good at breeding\nstuff so humans have bred gry wolves\ninto\nChihuahuas right and loads of other\nbreeds of dogs we've also bred our fruit\nand our plants to be very sweet and full\nof sugar if you compare a banana from\ntoday to an ancestral banana\nthey look nothing alike the ancestral\nbanana is small full of seeds full of\nfiber quite tart modern day banana is\nbasically dessert same for apples apples\nused to be small like cherries now\nthey're this big nice little plump\npackage of water and sugar\nessentially if you want to eat something\nsweet the piece of whole fruit is still\nthe best thing to eat because of that\nprotective fiber and I explained the\nfiber makes that mesh in your intestine\nbut then as soon as you denature a piece\nof fruit whether you juice it you take\naway the fiber you blend it you\npulverize the fiber then it becomes just\none big glucose Spike waiting to happen\nand it's not because something comes\nfrom fruit that it's good for you yeah\nthat's a really good explanation I\nappreciate that I think there's always\nbeen people who've demonized fruit as\nwell in that way but I think that\nexplanation actually gets into the\nnuance and subtlety of how we're having\nour fruit and I never going to say Don't\neat fruit it's totally fine to eat fruit\nseriously it's much better to eat fruit\nthan a cookie right for your glucose\nlevels for your body and it is still an\nunprocessed food right it's been bred\nand CH that's the but it's still\nunprocessed so of course have fruit just\ndon't denature that fruit totally\nbecause then you're taking it even\nfurther and further away from the way\nnature intended us to consume it yeah I\nactually remember when I first went to\nIndia with my mom and my mom was making\nme the same cures that she would make me\nin London but now making them when we\nwere living in India just for a bit we\nwent visiting when I was younger and\nit's so interesting because each\nvegetable was so flavorful but so\ndifferent and I'm sure you feel this\nback home or when you're traveling like\nyou can find these places in the world\nwhere you're eating real vegetables\nagain or real fruits and they don't look\nas perfect they all look imperfect\nrandom yeah they've got personalities\nand even the flavors are not consistent\nso like a zuccini is going to taste\ndifferent to another one but it's still\nso flavorful but in such a unique way\nand and I remember saying to my mom like\nwhat are you doing here like what are\nyou doing differently in India that\nyou're not doing back in London it was\njust what was accessible and and I think\nthat's in the states for sure where I\nfeel that even more than from London\nwhere in London I still felt certain\nvegetables and everything were still\naccessible but here I I really feel like\na lot of the vegetables and fruits that\nwe're eating are super processed y yeah\nyeah absolutely it's really tough uh one\nof your other hacks uh is stop counting\ncalories and I wanted to talk about that\nbecause I think that's what all of us do\nand again that again the recommended\n2,000 for women and 2500 for men seems\nto be like such a big figure that we\nfocus our whole diet plans on and lives\non I love this question do you know Jay\nhow people used to measure the amount of\ncalories in a food I don't know okay so\nif they wanted to measure the amount of\ncalories in a donut here's what they\nused to do they would put the donut in a\nlittle box box and they would put this\nbox in a bigger like an aquarium like a\nbig Basin of water okay they put the\ndoughnut box at the bottom of the\naquarium and then they would light the\ndoughnut Inside the Box on fire the\ndoughnut would burn and then they would\nmeasure by how many degrees the water in\nthe aquarium increased oh my gosh so and\nthat would give you the number of\ncalories in the donuts the calories is\njust a measure of how much heat\nis given up when something is burned so\nif you were to put an avocado in that\nbox and burn it it might increase the\nwater temperature around it by the exact\nsame number of degrees therefore you\nwould say this doughnut and this avocado\nhave the same number of\ncalories now it seems pretty obvious\nthat this is kind of a silly way to\nmeasure food it's almost like saying oh\nthis book and this book have the same\nnumber of pages Pages therefore they're\nthe same book yeah this is not the case\nright my book and your book might have\nthe same number of pages but they're not\nabout the same topic they're not from\nthe same author they don't give you the\nsame information don't give you the same\nemotion right and so if we just talk\nabout Foods based on how many calories\nthey contain we're missing what's\nactually key what is in that food what\nare the molecules in that food is that\nfood just glucose and going to create a\nbig glucose bike or is that food just\nhealthy fats and protein and going to\nkeep your glucose level steady to give\nyou another example two people could be\neating the exact same number of calories\nlet's say two women are eating 2,000\ncalories a day one of them could be\neating in a way that keeps her glucose\nlevel steady feel great energy\nfunctioning mitochondria clear brain\ngoing after her dreams girl boss\nwhatever the other person could be\neating 2,000 calories in a way that's\ncreating lots of glucose spikes\ninflammation aging type two diabetes\nhormonal issues brain fog etc etc etc\nhow many calories you're eating does not\ntell you how healthy you are does not\npredict your health at all you need to\nlearn about what you're eating and in my\nbook I explain how to identify the\nmolecules in a food and if you follow my\nhacks and you stop counting calories\nnaturally your health is going to\nimprove you might be eating the exact\nsame number of calories as before but\nyour life will be completely different\ncalories are not enough information\nthey're interesting to measure the\nquantity of a food for example one dut\nversus two Donuts but they're not\nsufficient and it's really easy to hide\nbehind calories when you're for example\na food manufacturer and you're making\nprocessed foods and you say there's only\n50 calories in this little bag of sweets\ndon't worry it's not bad for you it's\njust 50 calories yeah but it's 50\ncalories of pure sugar and it's going to\nmake you feel horrible so calories are\nnot enough we need to evolve past this I\nwant to teach people what is in their\nfood I want to make every single one of\nmy readers a food detective I want them\nto have all the agency the power the\ninformation to make informed choices\nwhen they go to the supermarket that's\nthe goal right giving people that\nfreedom and that power that's what I\ncare about yeah that's such a brilliant\nMission like that's such a brilliant\nMission because even everything you've\nsaid to us today whether it's being able\nto know what to look at on the back of a\npack all the way to putting clothing on\nyour cars I just I was just about to say\nthat like putting clothing on your like\nI love that it comes for you in your\nheart and mind from a place of giving\npeople agency and giving people strength\nand rather than making us fearful which\nI think a lot of diet plans do a lot of\nfood advice does it makes us quite\ninsecure and scared that we're doing the\nwrong thing whereas when I'm talking to\nyou I feel a sense of like enthusiasm\nand confidence I know what to do good\nand that's so that's so fulfilling like\nit's so it fills you with so much\nenthusiasm and energy\nto to feel like yes I am in control of\nhow I'm going to feel and what I'm going\nto eat you are and the information is\nthere and I'm I just want to apologize\nto all the people who've been\nmanipulated by food marketing diet\nculture that stuff stop it can stop if\nyou get this information this will stop\nand the thing that breaks my heart the\nmost Jay and I think this is what\nmotivates me to do this work is when I\nmeet somebody who has a medical\ncondition like type two diabetes and\neverybody wants to make the right\nchoices every everybody wants to be\nhealthier but because of the\nmanipulation and all the misleading\ninformation about food they're eating in\na way that they think and they hope is\ngood for them but is actually making\nthem sicker and that's what I want to\nstop I want to insert this information\nin this science in those situation and\nturn it all around for people yeah I\nlove that I love that uh Jesse we talked\nabout so many things today but one thing\nI wanted to ask you about was the use of\nsupplements I take a lot of supplements\nevery day I felt better because of them\nit's had a big imp impact on my personal\nlife and I was always someone who was\nplaying around I think supplements are\nalso things that you have to test and\nexperiment and see what works for you as\na combination what's your take on\nsupplements well I know supplements in\nthe glucose space right and I can't\ncomment on all the other stuff I'm sure\nthere's great things for other stuff\nyou're trying to optimize but when it\ncomes to glucose so people often ask me\ninstead of doing the vinegar hack can I\ntake a vinegar gummy when I can't have a\nveggie starter can I take fiber pills my\ndad has diabetes doesn't want to change\nhis diet what can I give him and I spent\nthe last few years researching\nextensively this space and what are some\ncool molecules that could actually help\nyour glucose levels unfortunately what's\non the market today at worst actually\ncontains sugar and creates a glucose\nbike under the guise of going to help\nyou with your glucose levels and that's\njust so annoying to me and there's some\ngood stuff out there but I've actually\ncreated something incredible that is the\nbest thing on the market if you want to\nhelp your journey to steady glucose with\na supplement now I'll explain what it is\nbut I don't want people to think this is\na magic pill you should do the food\nhacks first and foremost okay that is\ngoing to have the biggest most powerful\nimpact on your health but a supplement\ncan also help so I've identified four\nplants Jay that have existed forever but\nthat recent science has shown have an\nincredible impact on our glucose levels\nthese are white mulbury leaf lemon\nextract cinnamon and antioxidants from\ngreen vegetables I've put them all\ntogether into a capsule you take it\nbefore a meal and it reduces the glucose\nSpike of your meal by up to 40% wow and\nthis is more powerful than vinegar which\nwas up to 30% I know me I got some for\nyou good I'm being serious I've got some\nso if you want extra help this is the\nthing you need it's called anti-spike\nformula you can find it on my website\nantis spike.com and it not only has this\nimmediate impact on the glucose Spike of\na meal it also builds up benefit over\ntime it reduces inflammation it reduces\nyour fasting glucose levels it increases\ngp1 which is a hormone we've spoken a\nlot about recently in the media because\nof things like OIC gp1 is a really cool\nhormone that just makes you feel Fuller\nand OIC tricks your brain into thinking\nthere's more gp1 in your body than there\nactually is but with anti-spike you're\nactually harnessing natural Pathways to\nincrease it for real mhm so this is my\nlatest creation and I hope it's going to\nhelp a lot of people you know when\nyou're 4 P.M birthday party when you're\ntraveling when you can't do the hacks\nanti- Spike will be there for you but\nagain do the food hacks first it's just\nan additional hack to help yeah yeah I\nwant to try it for sure I have it in my\nyeah I love that what is your take on\nasmic I mean based on what you just\nmentioned there what's been your\nassessment of it I'm sure you've seen\npeople who are on it yeah listen I think\nfor a lot of people it's been kind of a\ngodsend um they've really struggled\ntheir whole life with their weight and\nfor some people that's their objective\nright so whether you take it or you\ndon't take it it's not my place to judge\nbut what I found Jay is that if you\nthink about it this craze has shown us\nthat we live in a society in which our\nfood system is so toxic that we need to\ntake a pill to prevent us from eating\nthe food around us do you understand how\nsad that is so I just feel a bit worried\nand a bit disheartened we've gone to\nwe've gone to that place and also when\npeople lose weight on OIC they don't\njust lose fat they also lose muscle mass\nand so when you stop taking oing and if\nyou um gain weight back you often just\ngain fat back and so overall you're in a\nworse place so whether or not you take\nit it's important to learn my hacks so\nthat way when you stop it you sustain it\nright but um yeah I mean wow wow what\ncan I say crazy world we live in yeah\nabsolutely and I appreciate you touching\non that cultural challenge that we have\non a number of parts in our conversation\nand I really think that that's at the\nheart of a lot of what you're saying is\nthat everyone out there who's listening\nright now who feels\nlike they don't like the way they eat\nthey don't like what they eat they judge\ntheir body they look at the mirror first\nthing in the morning and criticize\nthemselves it all comes from programming\nand conditioning it's not your fault\nit's not your fault and it was you were\nset up to feel that way yes and there's\na lot of money being made off your back\nbecause you feel that way yeah and so I\nthink a lot of people we beat ourselves\nup we think oh what's wrong with me or\nthere must be something really bad with\nme or oh my gosh I'm not disciplined\nenough and I don't have good it's not\nabout discipline it's not about laziness\neverything Temptation choices yeah toxic\nfood around you that's cheap mising\nmarketing messages you know incorrect\ninformation so we need to go back to\nteaching people how their body actually\nfunctions in the science and the\nphysiology and you know Jay I hope I\nwill become completely irrelevant I hope\nthis information will be so common\nknowledge people will be like yep wear a\nsunscreen drink water brush your teeth\nhave a savory breakfast like I want my\nstuff to be at that level and I want to\nretire and disappear because everybody\nneeds to know this it should be taught\nin schools it's basic right to\nunderstand how your body functions and\nhow to navigate this difficult food\nlandscape that we live in absolutely and\nand the courage that any of you have\nright now who are listening and even\nwanting to take one step towards that\nagency that Jesse's been talking about\nthat's a huge win because we're\noperating in a society where even taking\nthat one step is often so difficult\nbecause of all the messages we're\nhearing around us so anyone who's\nlistening and about to take that first\nstep uh go and order a copy of glucose\nRevolution right now uh the\nlife-changing power of balancing your\nblood sugar and of course check out\nantis spike.com uh to figure out if you\nneed to add that once you've done uh\nJesse's hacks and Jesse we end every\nconversation with a final five which is\nour Fast Five on the podcast and I'm\nexcited to see what you answer so they\nhave to be answered in one word to one\nsentence maximum got it so Jesse here\nare your final five the first question\nis what is the best advice you've ever\nheard or received when it comes to\nhealth symptoms are\nmessages I'm going to let you expand\nbecause I like that okay yeah if you\nfeel symptoms from acne to psoriasis to\ninfertility to brain fog these are not\nsomething to suppress they are messages\nthey are your body trying to communicate\nwith you to tell you hey there's\nsomething wrong I need your help don't\nsuppress don't feel bad about the\nsymptoms flip the script talk to your\nbody be like okay why is there all this\neczema on my arm what's going on that's\ninflammation that's inside can I help\nyou you see what I mean so symptoms are\nmessages how how do you think we often\nprocess symptoms instead of as messages\nwe think our body is fighting us we're\nlike body why are you against me we\ndon't understand it's crying for help\nit's not against your body just wants to\nkeep you alive your body's not trying to\nbe annoying I promise your body is\ntrying to keep you alive that's so good\nthat's so good I love that your body is\nnot trying to be annoying I love that no\nit's so true your body is so much\nsmarter than you so much smarter than\nyou listen to it it's got stuff to teach\nyou that's such great Insight next time\nyou come we're going to talk about that\nI love that that's really hit Accord\nwith me like I think it's so interesting\nhow we look at anything inconvenient\nas there's something wrong and and and\nyou're being annoying and I wish you\nwould just be okay rather than oh wait a\nminute you're actually trying to share\nsomething and I think a lot of people at\nleast I've heard I don't have kids but\nI've learned that a lot of people feel\nthis with their children where your\nchild's trying to communicate with you\nand just doesn't know how and it's\nalmost like our body's like that yeah\nit's like a baby doesn't cry because\nit's trying to annoy you a baby cries is\ngoing through something difficult and he\nwants your help yeah I love that that's\nsuch a beautiful answer all right second\nquestion what is the wor best health\nadvice you've ever heard or received um\nhave a fruit smoothie first thing in the\nmorning yeah I mean anything that has to\ndo with uh fruit juices fruit smoothies\nas being a health food anything no just\nlike no yeah don't do it don't do it\ndon't do it okay uh question number\nthree what's the first thing you do in\nthe morning and the last thing you do\nbefore you go to bed the first thing I\ndo in the morning I take my earplugs out\nand I drink water so you do have water\nfirst in the morning that's it yeah\nabsolutely and then I try to turn my\nphone on a little bit later I try to not\nturn it on in the first half an hour\nlast thing I do at night before going to\nbed I have this app in which I track my\nmental health so I put a little a scale\nof one to five how my mental health was\ntoday and I write a couple sentences\nabout my day nice what is the app code\nit's called Dao okay have no affiliation\nwhatsoever it's awesome d a y l i o and\nI've been doing this for four years now\nand it makes a little dot for I'll show\nyou in a sec it makes a little dot for\nevery day and so I have four years of\ndots of how mental health was in all of\nthose days and I see these patterns I\nsee that I've gotten happier over time\nmore fulfilled have less episodes of\ndifficult mental health issues so it's\nreally cool to look back that's\nbeautiful I love that that's a great\nrecommendation for everyone listening uh\nfourth question what's something that\nyou used to believe to be true about\nhealth but now you've realized it's\nactually not true uh that everybody\nshould wear a glucose monitor so when I\nfirst started in the space because\nwearing the glucose monitor had changed\nmy life I was telling everybody to wear\none and now I realize that you can get\nall the benefits by seeing what I've\ndiscovered and the science that I've\nfound and sometimes overt tracking\nyourself can lead to issues and stress\nyeah I I can relate to that there was a\npoint where I was measuring everything\nyeah and it was useful and then it went\ntoo far and then I didn't want to\nmeasure anything and then it's it's a\nit's a really interesting balance\nbecause data can be so powerful and at\nthe same it can be so disempowering\nbecause sometimes you look at the data\ndecide how you feel about yourself yeah\nyeah it's like you know yeah you let\nexactly you wake up and you're like I\ndon't know if I'm tired or not look at\nmy sleep data oh I'm exhausted clearly\nbecause I didn't sleep all but you're\nactually not connected to how you feel\nyeah yeah and it takes you outside of\nyour body exactly exactly it's what\nyou're saying earlier we need to\nactually get better at living in our\nbodies and listening within our bodies\nand hearing and feeling what they're\nsaying to us and how they're\ncommunicating rather than expecting that\neven even an external person or system\nis going to somehow predict how we feel\namen yeah that's a really really\npowerful take away I love that uh Fifth\nand final question which we asked to\nevery guest who's ever been on the show\nif you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be okay I'm going to restrict\nmyself to the world of food okay because\nthere's lots of other laws that we could\ndo that would be very important in the\nworld and it can be a real law like you\nknow yeah yeah ban all processed\nbreakfast food m I love that love\nbecause that would help kids it would\nhelp parents it would change\npeople's mood make them happier more\nfulfilled yeah I think that's a big one\nthat's huge or like the law could be\ntreat breakfast like any other meal\nbecause if you ban something then other\nstuff pops up so it's more like treat\nbreakfast as the second lunch and eat\nlunch food at breakfast yeah that's\ngreat I love that everyone Jesse in chop\nthe book is called glucose Revolution\nthe life-changing power of balancing\nyour sugar if you don't follow @ glucose\ngoddess on Instagram make sure you go do\nthat right away please grab a copy of\nthis book we went through the hacks but\nwe were just skimming the surface there\nis amazing Insight amazing
