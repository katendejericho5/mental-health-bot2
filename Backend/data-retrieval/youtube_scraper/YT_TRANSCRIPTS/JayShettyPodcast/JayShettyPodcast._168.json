    "transcript": "join Ry and I for a part two of our\nspecial onp purpose episode today with\nBMW today Ry and I switch rolls and I go\ngrocery shopping in R's place tune in\nfor the road trip with the all electric\nBMW super nice it's really spacious\nlet's go so Ry what's the challenge\ntoday okay so you\nremember a couple of years ago we did\nthis YouTube video where you made\nsomething for yeah I've been trying to\nblock it out ever since okay so you at\nthat time made me what did you make me I\nmade you so this is the one and only\ntime in our entire life that I think one\ntime one time only and I promised it\nwould be one time only I cooked you a\nstuffed pepper and it was the best rice\nstuffed pepper you'd ever had in your\nentire life okay it was it actually made\nit into my cookbook I don't know whether\nI even told you this but there is a\nrecipe imagine you out of all people\nhave a recipe in my that's amazing no I\ntold you if I wanted to be a chef i' I'd\nbe you know I was asked if you've ever\ncooked me if there's any recipes that\nremind me of you and there was one it\nwas either that or beans on toast they\nsaid I couldn't put beans on toast beans\non toast that would have been the best\nwith cheese sprinkled on top I can't\nthat's not in my what made it into my\nbook just because stuffed pepper didn't\nfeel fun enough it's a one po Mexican\nrice wait why did the stuff pepper not\nfeel good enough it just was like a bit\nbasic honestly the actual Mexican rice\nhas made it it's like a one part Mexican\nrice dish so you already kind of know\nhow to do this a bit of idea cheating I\nhave no idea what we're going to do is\nyou're going to we're going to the\ngrocery store or the supermarket as we\nlike to call it and we are you're going\nyou're going to buy all the ingredients\nthis is my worst nightmare but on top of\nthat just to make it a little bit spicy\nwe are going to get you making some\nguacamole and some healthy sour cream to\nbe able to dollop on top and then I will\njoyfully eat it for lunch while we're on\nthe way to the grocery store let's\nanswer some questions all right let's do\nit so you've got them next to you cuz I\ncan't I can't read question and drive at\nthe same time I don't think that would\nbe very safe if we were doing carp\nkaraoke right now what would what would\nit be mine would be yeah yeah yeah yeah\nyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah or it\nwould be baby calm down calm down Okay C\nyou know don't tell me no you know the\nwords you always make fun of me because\nhe makes fun of me and my music choice\nbecause he says a lot of it there isn't\nactual words it's either Mumble or it's\nsound sound\num so that would be mine and if it was\nJay it would be don't never\nstop what is it it' be a Drake song yeah\nDrake song Everybody obviously got that\nI was doing right that's exactly where\nthey go all right so other questions\nwhat's the biggest difference between\ndrivers in LA and drivers in London oh I\ndon't I have to say I do find La drivers\na little bit more impatient just out\nthere really yeah I do find there's a\nlot more beeping no one wants to give\nyou away whereas you know what in London\nI'd say people do do let you into things\nreally yeah oh interesting I feel like\none thing I really love about driving in\nLa as a driver myself is I love the palm\ntrees I like I feel like look at this I\nfeel like I'm on a constant vacation\nthis is about drivers though right right\nright like dri but I agree I do find the\nhighways scary in La when people are\nswitching lanes yeah when people are\nswitching lanes and obviously\neverything's the other way around for us\nso you're driving on a different side of\nthe road and the steering wheels on the\ndifferent side of the car yeah so\nespecially I find when I come back from\nLondon I find it even scarier and I find\nmyself too much on one side or the other\noh I do that all the time but yeah and I\nthink I mean I think driers pretty much\neverywhere in the world are pretty\nimpatient aren't yeah I am too to that\num do you believe you\nare do you believe you're a backseat\ndriver okay I'm a proud backseat driver\nyou know why because my line every time\nI do a backseat driver thing like watch\nout or don't go that close is imagine I\ndidn't say that I could have just saved\nyour life and somebody else the\ndifference is every time you say it I'm\nlike the way you say it is more likely\nto cause an accident yeah exactly yes\nyeah exactly then save me like I'm like\nliterally I have a shock like I\nliterally have a shock every time you\nsay I'm like what happened like what\nhappened something something happened\nand you're like no just I what's my\nusual oh my gosh it's Mommy yeah Mommy\nit's like what's mommy going to do I\nwould say I am more of a backseat driver\nthan Jay is yes I'm not a backi driver\nat all maybe that just shows I care I'm\nalso not a backi driver in life ooh line\ndrop no no but it's important it's it's\nan interesting question right like this\nis like you know what Jetty getting\njhett on me actually you know what let's\ngo deeper into that what does it mean to\nbe a backseat driver in your life a\nquestion then what does it mean Jay to\nbe a backseat driver please do tell us\nno I just I just think that some of us\nyou know grab Life by the steering wheel\nM and navigate and take the journey\nourselves and some of us sit in the back\nseat and criticize and judge and\ncomplain\ndo you not think that in life we need\nboth backseat drivers and people who\nwant to take the steering wheel and too\nmany steering wheel people would\nactually be not impact not\ngood that was that was an amazing\nquestion yeah that an amazing question\nuh no I I believe that when you're\ndriving you should drive safely and\nsecurely and responsibly and when you're\nin the back seat you should be obedient\nI'm talking about the the what life in\nlife oh in life yeah in life okay next\nquestion people next question if you\ncould pick three people to fill your car\nwith on road Tri good question oh just\nto remind everyone these were questions\nthat my team came up with so we had no\nidea what we were on if you could pick\nthree people to fill your car with on a\nroad trip who would they be go on let's\ntry one each three people in the whole\nentire world yeah okay I I know who your\nare easy go on yeah mine are quite easy\ngo mine would be okay people alive would\nbe my grandma my niece and my nephew\nyeah Banta forever didn't make it so\nmuch no but that would be like it would\nbe so funny because three in the back\nthree in the back we'll put three in the\nback then I can the then I you can be in\nthe car too but not alive I would love\nto have a car full of like my grandma\nand then her grandma and like my\nancestors one I love driving around old\npeople I do it for my grandma and her\nfriends all the time and it is so much\nfun cuz they're hilarious you know one\nthing I found my dad opens up on road\ntrips like if it's just me and him he's\ndriving me to the airport or he's my\nsister told me yesterday that he was\ndriving her to the airport and he starts\ntelling stories about himself like it\ncreates this time and space where people\ncan open up a little bit and so with\nthat in mind I think I would want that\nwith people that I really wish I had got\nto know but would didn't have the chance\nto what questions would you ask or what\ngame would you play with these people in\nthe car on a long journey for fun I\nwould definitely play well our version\nIndian version of carpo karaoke andaru\nwhere you all just sing like old Indian\nsongs but I imagine my grandma and her\nancestors would probably sing like\ndevotional songs uh or God songs which\nis amazing but then to actually ask them\nquestions oh I love word association I\nthink it tells a lot about people right\nto like to like understand when they\nhear something what they relate it to\nright right right so yeah that's what\nwhat about you who would your three\npeople be oh gosh all right so\nif it was living it would be\nyou my\nsister and my mom yeah and that would be\nlike my family trip yeah if it was\npeople who weren't alive or like people\nI don't know I'd want it to be Steve\nJobs Martin Luther\nKing and Einstein oh wow and I wouldn't\nsay anything I would just listen it\nwould be all of them yeah because I\nwould have I would just listen I would\nhave nothing to say just I just sit\nthere and think about what they would\nsay you know who was just so fun in the\ncar though we've done a few a few random\ncar trips with him together is rather\nnot swam because I feel like he really\nbrings up such good conversation and\nalso does the same thing my dad does\nwhere there's so many stories that come\nout during those trips totally I love\nthose trips actually I I take you out\nand put him into mine sorry got it got\nit with your bar my grandma my nie my\nnephew I'm not sure that I'm not sure\nhe'd enjoy that I was going to say the\nother person you love having in the car\nis ardel oh yeah that's a good car\nkaroke yeah you and ell are always\nsinging in that's true that's good good\nanswer that would be a really\ninteresting conversation to have yeah if\nit was possible who is more likely to\nleave the car lights on overnight I\nliterally did that yesterday not\novernight not overnight no you leave the\ncar lights on you leave the car unlocked\nyou forget to charge the car I leave my\nlike little like we're so lucky that we\nhave electric cars like right now this\nelectric car hair band a spare drink a\nspare um some pair of sunglasses some\nsnacks there's always something here\nlingering right that's really a blessing\num so then yeah it wouldn't Bean me I'll\ntake that I find that I go through\nperiods where the car is immaculate and\nthen when I have too many clothes and\nshoes in the car there there are times I\nwill literally come to the car and it's\nlike he's been living out of his car for\na long period because I've started to\nrealize like it happened the other night\nright like I needed a suit cuz had an\nevent to go to and I've started to\nrealize so I keep my pickle War stuff in\nthe car I need my I need a suit in the\ncar I need a suitcase in the car\npotentially like I find like so much of\nmy life is so like last minute like jump\non a plane do this do that that I've\nstarted to realize that I need to be\nmore prepared I feel like you weren't\nprepared for this road trip because\nwhere are my beverages oh no but we're\ngoing to buy some juny when we get there\nokay fine who who's most likely to get\ncaric in a car that they're not driving\nme to yeah I get car sck so much I still\nlet's figure that out that kind of like\nlike let's just go a little bit deeper\ninto this shall we let's let's dive into\nit Jay go on I'm trying to figure out\nthis whole caric situation like why\nimbalance in the ear babe there's\nnothing to figure out no but then how do\nwe solve our imbalance cuz we've had\nthis for a while yeah no it's imbalance\nin like your eardrum right so there are\ndifferent ways you can use peppermint\nall that really helps me right um so why\ndidn't you bring peppermint chewing on\nGinger that's really helpful and then if\nyou are reading read upwards got it\noutwards what's the next question okay\nthe next question is is would you need\nmaps to get from our house to go to a\ngrocery store yes compl I think Google\nMaps has really ruined my ability to\nabsorb in things around me and like I I\ndon't know what I would be without\nGoogle Maps I well no I know what I\nwould be I don't know where I would\nbe if I was yeah if I'm in London I can\nreally get around but I feel like ever\nsince we moved to the states I've become\nvery Reliant so relying on maps and yes\nso in conclusion we both would need maps\nto get anywhere yeah I'm assuming this\nis a question from you to me go do you\nnot answer texts from me because you're\nplaying hard so I told the team that\nsometimes you don't respond I have to\nexplain this to our friends as well\nbecause our friends will be like he's\nupset with me like is R okay like I'm\nlike I'm like she doesn't reply to her\nown husband for like seven messages like\nI have to ask you the same\nquestion you're quite you're someone who\nlike it's not you're not so succinct\nthough I am succinct okay fine it is me\nhonestly but I also think you know what\nI really do think this is this is I'm\ngoing to have a jety moment now I\nbelieve that we have this terrible habit\nof wanting people to reply within like a\nday or two and I'm like what if I\nwouldn't reply within a week but what if\nwe live together what if I you can ask\nme when you see me right and I just\nthink that there's this I don't I I find\nthat the reason I get distracted so fast\nis because this KN of oh my gosh I have\nto reply to this person I have to reply\nto this email within this amount of time\nI have to and sometimes I just want the\nfreedom like today I replied back to an\nemail 3 Days Later was anybody hurt by\nit no well if they were I'm sorry but or\nlike text messages someone messaged me\nand I remembered it this morning so I\nwas like oh 4 days later and I don't\nfeel like I should have to apologize for\na late reply because late is relative\ngot it late is relative but yes I I am\nbad I'm actually no no you've got really\ngood at it good so much better I just\nfind sometimes I need to make a decision\ntotally call me I am not a messenger I\nam so good with calls opposite I'm a\nmessage me you're a Messer yeah don't\nalways call me cuz I'll be in meetings\nI'm like if you call me I will pick up\nand we can talk I'm more than happy to\ndo that but because I have to type so\nmuch for work and I'm on my phone all\nthe time for that communication via\nphone becomes so tedious for me it's not\nfun so call me beat me if you want to\nreach me one of the times I do take\ncalls which I do love is when I'm\ndriving that's usually my time to take a\nphone call it speeds up any Journey\nexcept La has such bad reception Fair\nwhat would each other's first first line\nBeat if we met now at a party oh\ninteresting mine would be something like\ndid you try the vegan\ntacos are you vegan are you vegan uh\nwhat would mine be mine would be we\nnever met at P I didn't also have that\ncontext I think maybe you say you'd\nprobably get into like a group cono with\nwith people and then you say something\nintellectual and then I'd have I'd ask\nyou something and oh so I'd use my\nintellect yeah I think you use your\nintellect what's the first song No but\ndo you know what let's no not let's get\ninto this no no no I really feel for\neveryone who's like dating right now\nonline and stuff it's really hard like\nI'm like you have to be interesting on\nyour profile you have to be interesting\non your pictures then you have to be\ninteresting on text then you have to be\ninteresting on a voice note then you\nhave to be interested in real life then\nyou get the real life it's because\nyou're forced to have to be interesting\nat every tiny point of connection no\nsometimes I just want to not talk and\njust be silent you can't do that on\ndates you can't just be yourself you\nalways feel like you have to you have to\nshow up as a really excitable\ninteresting person with a lot that you\ndo in life uh what's your screen time oh\nmy gosh well tell me yours I'll tell you\nmine\nlater I don't even want to tell you tell\nme 7 hours 30 minutes that makes sense\nit's during the work day let's see what\nit should we see what it is though most\nused what'sapp\nso like yesterday was WhatsApp for 3\nhours that's messaging and calls your\nyeah Instagram for 1 hour 10 not bad\ninternet surfing for 1 hour note section\n42 minutes cuz I write on that yeah\nwrite your quotes I write my quotes on\nthere write my little reminders\nReflections Google Maps 30 minutes\nmessages 26 minutes and Google Calendar\n23 minutes that's not too bad honestly\nthat's probably one of my and Google\nMail 20 minutes that was rying back to\nthat one email great if our relationship\nhad a theme song what would it be pop\nstar yeah I'm a pop star not a doctor\nyeah I'd go with that I don't think that\ngoes for our relationship that's great\nuh do you have an ick about me ah I\nthink where to start yeah I know\nliterally I think it used to be when you\nused to run late I'm going to tell you\nmine what mine is because you know you\nhave this like photographic memory and\nthen you remember everything sometimes\neven if I know I'm in the right I\nquestion myself\nyou're not right I am though there are\ntimes where you actually get it wrong I\ndon't you do and this this is my I this\npart you're the stubborn one I don't

bad for one\nrecipe Why did no one time me it's fine\nwe Why did no one time me you did a\ngreat job I reckon I was quicker than\nyou are you get distracted by like choc\nand and like so I actually was far more\nefficient than people give me credit for\nwell all right now what let's go you got\nto pay for it now do you want to go grab\nsome food for yourself no but do you\nthink I'm allowed to open something\nbefore I pay for it if I'm going to pay\nfor it oh wait look she just added other\nstuff that wasn't on the list I did I'm\njust about to pay for it there that was\nfun that was so fun you know I know\nyou're hungry I'm going to go home and\ncook I'm going to go home and make lunch\nfor you how does it feel when someone\nmakes your own food for you honestly\ngreat because you know what the what the\namazing thing about cooking in recipes\nis that you can I like when I cook my\nmom's food I can literally cook the same\nthing with the same\nrecipe and um it will never taste the\nsame m\nin a good way in a great way like\neverything is so different so when I\nmake your recipe it will have its own\nflavor yeah yeah because it would be\nmade with love for you yeah it would\njust be using different hands different\namount like even if you're measuring\nthings out somehow things always taste\ndifferent that's what's so amazing about\nfood right I'm just not a person to\nspeak to when I'm not fed right I don't\nknow whether you're like that is that\nhow you feel right now that's how I feel\nright now I get what you're saying\nthough I get quite hungry as well do you\ndon't you you do hset I get hset or like\nhand yeah hset I get agitated agitated\nright agitated\nagitated so what do we do what do I do\nwhen you're agitated ideally not talk to\nme but we can't do that right now so um\ncuz we're recording a let's keep this\ngoing can you give me the ticket please\nI don't have I just handed them to you\nlike two seconds ago which one's\nwa what do you do to keep yourself like\ncuz you're someone who expends so much\nenergy during the day I feel like you're\nprobably one of the most what's like the\nword for a person who uses their time\nreally well just organized no no no you\nare one of the most productive people\nright that I know and you really don't\nyou know you're not a Time waster you\nreally use your energy and your time so\nefficiently but I always wonder and I\nfeel like I get asked this a lot like\nhow do you manage to maintain that\nenergy level throughout the day I don't\nthere are times when I feel tired but\nsecondary part to that question is when\nyou do like right now I feel like I just\nwant to get into bed and do nothing for\nthe rest of the day but like one can't\ndo that often so what would one do if\none was feeling that way and actually\nyou know how do you keep motivated and\nthen pick your energy back up I think\nfirst of all I do love what I do and I\nreally and I'm really grateful to get to\ndo what I do I feel I feel like I\nappreciate that I get to do what I love\nevery day and I don't take that for\ngranted I've noticed that about you you\nreally even if you are feeling that way\nyou self soothe a lot in the sense that\nyou you selft talk to motivate your like\nyou don't really rely on other people to\nbring you you you give me encouragement\nno but what I'm saying is you find ways\nI know even when you're feeling tired\nyou're like no you know I may be tired\nbut this is something that I love doing\nor you you're constantly talking to\nyourself in a positive language to\nmotivate yourself or energize yourself\nyeah and I've noticed that by you where\neven if you are tired and even if you're\nyeah I'm exhausted but I've had like the\nbest week and it's been so productive\nand I got this done and what an amazing\nthing to be able to do this or this and\nso I've noticed that with you were even\nand and so I think that language really\nmakes a difference to how we talk to\nourselves yeah and I always say to\nmyself I am tired so I'm\naccepting and then and then I add an\naction to solve that so I am tired and\nI'll go to sleep tonight I'll sleep\nearly tonight yeah sorry yeah I'll go to\nsleep early tonight or I am tired and\ntomorrow I'm going to sleep on the plane\nso I've got a flight tomorrow in the\nmorning it's always telling you you know\nwhat it is it's your body reacts to how\nyou're feeling and what you're saying to\nit yeah and you're not lying to it you\ncan't just be like oh I feel I feel\nenergized no cuz it knows you're lying\nbut it's one of those things where you\nare almost giving it that hope and that\nsomething to look forward to where it's\nlike let's just put in that last amount\nof effort and then just know that I also\nknow you are struggling and I know that\nthis is happening in my in your in in my\nbody so I'm telling you body that we are\ngoing to do this and it's going to it's\ngoing to make us feel better and also\nplanning recoup right like I know that\nlike last weekend when you planned a\nlittle spa day for us yeah like I was\nlooking forward to that the whole week\nwe knew we had a tough couple of weeks\nbefore that and now I know I've got\nanother quite intense like s days ahead\nyeah and then I'm hoping to have a bit\nof couple of days days of rest and so I\nthink it's also balancing that out and\nsaying okay I know I've got a busy\nperiod when am I going to plan some deep\nrest rather than going okay I'm just\ngoing to rely on that energy I think\npeople and by people I mean people like\nme We Live moment to moment rather than\nlike there's a lot of people and I'm not\nsaying whether that's good or bad but\nthere are people who live moment to\nmoment and react according to how\nthey're feeling in the moment and then\nthere are people who and and I think\nthere's a training element to it where\nyou know you can't always act on how\nyou're feeling because often how you're\nfeeling may not be may not be the right\nway to do what you need to do like I\nfeel a certain way right now but do I\nhave things to do and do I need to get\nthem done yes whereas if I went with how\nI was feeling and I didn't train myself\nto push through that sometimes I\nwouldn't be able to get done what I need\nto do so I think it takes an element of\ntraining I think that's every single\ntime you're feeling that way having that\ntalk and and and pushing yourself to do\nthat's really smart there you go there\nyou go um solved it what was that last\nquestion on the page it was what kind of\nparty person are you oh introvert\nextrovert what was the no it was kind of\nlike the so I know\nI I'm the person yawning at the party\nbut also the person who I find one\nperson to talk to the whole night\nusually and I stick with that person no\nyou are like a full-on social butterfly\nno I'm not trying to get you out of a\nparty is literally like okay look I find\nJeremy at any party no no this is true\nwhen humble lived here I would find\nhumble or Jeremy at any party and we\nwould sit and have a philosophical\nconversation for hour and off that's\nfact that's fact no that's fact no ask\nhumble or Jeremy you're the person this\nis that stubbornness coming out in you I\nknow why do I know because I'm always\nwaiting by the door waiting that's never\nhappened in a million years are you\njoking are you joking name one place\nthat we went to I'm going to ask all my\nfriends all of our friends tonight when\nwe see them what usually happens at the\nend of the night it's you talking to\neverybody saying bye for about yeah but\nthat's CU they guess at our home or at\nour event when we're out even when we're\nout and about you're talking to people\nand I'm waiting to go to the next shop\nand you're just having a you just you're\njust a chatter you are I'm definitely\nnot you are you love socializing you\nknow what though we went to some really\nbeautiful things lately so we were\nreally fortunate to go to Christen Bell\nwas being honored by un women and for\nthe world peace humanitarian fund and it\nwas a Gala the first ever Gala it was\nabsolutely incredible I think we were\nboth moved by Sharon Stone who spoke\nSharon Stone gave such an incredible she\ntalked about shared so much that I just\ndidn't know about and you know one thing\nthat's made me that that situation made\nme think it was about um there was some\nwomen who are you know advocating for a\nlot of Peace around the world and this\nwas a woman that came from Afghanistan\nand she was talking about the amount\nthat's happening in Afghanistan and it\nmade me realize that there is so much\nhappening around the world that we don't\nhear about and what makes it to us is\nbased on what the media decides to show\nus and I find that so interesting\nbecause when I then was thinking about\nother things that I've heard through my\nfriends or you know depending on where\nyou're from originally you may hear more\nto do with that country right and so I\nwas thinking about the other areas of\nthe world that we just don't hear about\nand there is so much happening around\nthe world that we just don't know about\nand we we can't even it's so difficult\nand and it's obviously what's CL to you\nand what what's meaningful but it is so\ninteresting that we do kind of live in\nour own bubble even though you think we\nhave so much access to other parts of\nthe world like they were talking about\nwhat's happening in Afghanistan and how\nyou know how women are treated yeah\nrefugee camps and how the women there\nare treated and um how they're not\nallowed to go out into even walk by\nthemselves on the street they're not\nallowed education there's so much yeah I\nwas really blown away I think we were\nboth Blown Away by when Sharon Stone was\nsaying that the average Refugee spends\n11 years years in a refugee camp and\nthere's no access to toilets and showers\nfor that much time yeah you know what I\nwas thinking about this and my my\nparents were in refugee camps well my\nmom was for a long time so was my dad\nfor years of their Teenage life and\ntheir refugee camps my mom was saying\nwas actually it was in London it was in\nScotland sorry and they were saying they\ndid have those facilities there but I\nthink maybe in different parts of the\nworld they didn't but um I think it's\nmore Collective showers Collective\ntoilets and you just think about how\ndifferent people's lives can be like my\nparents went through that for their\nteenag years they spent it in refugee\ncamps they see it as a place that saved\ntheir life like they see the refugee\ncamps as we were able to leave a unsafe\nplace to come and take because they were\nable to get out yeah exactly and so they\nwere so grateful to even have that\nsomeone that actually took them in and\nand they given that opportunity to start\nover and start a new life yeah and then\nthe other event we went to that I think\nwas really beautiful and special this\nweek was the celebration event for\nClarence and Jackie Avon oh yeah that\nwas that was just spectacular we're so\nso grateful we both were invited by\nNicole Avan to celebrate her parents and\neven though we didn't know her parents I\ndefinitely felt yeah just it was such a\nbeautifully organized event I felt so\nmoved and touched because I walked away\ngoing wow if only I could even try to\nserve my community and living the way\nher parents did like like to have that\nmuch impact and whether it's impact\nonline offline the people closest to you\nthe people that you meet in a shop\nwhatever it is to have that effect where\npeople are so touched by who you are as\na person and how you've gone above and\nbeyond for them I think it was\nincredible the number of people in so\nmany different areas so many different\nwalks of life I was blown away it it was\nincredible yeah it was unbelievable to\nhave that experience and just yeah just\nto hear about\nhow yeah how someone for that many years\nas well could continue to support and\nserve their Community I know I feel like\nit was from his pretty much like teenage\nyears or both their teenag years all the\nway up till 90 yeah and still there were\npeople who had met him at 990 and were\num sharing how much even within a couple\nof months they had completely changed\ntheir perspective on yeah it was really\nreally special yeah yeah it was\nincredible and then obviously we got to\nwatch this beautiful performance by uh\nStevie Wonder which I thought was my\ngosh it literally made me cry what a\nlegendary human and then to be able to I\nthink more than anybody that I've seen\nin real life we went to Beyonce's\nconcert we went to so many things but I\ndon't know there's something for me I've\ngot a personal kind of nostalgia with\nStevie Wonder it was play my dad used to\nplay all the time in the car when I was\ngrowing up and just an amazing amazing\nartist yeah really fun events so those\nwere two social events you didn't have\nto drag me out there you\ngo um but yeah know really really love\nattending these events that almost\nremind you of humanity yeah like I\nwalked away in different ways one was\nwhat we can do to serve what we can do\nto help the other one about how we can\ncelebrate humans as well I felt I walked\naway thinking how do I want to celebrate\nmy parents so how do I want to celebrate\nwhat they gave me yeah it made me walk\naway thinking I because there were so\nmany amazing stories that they were\ntelling and it made me walk away\nthinking and this is what I'm planning\nto do for Christmas\nis there's these amazing games you can\nbuy and journals that you ask your\nparents to fill in and to talk about\ntheir life before you and even the life\nthroughout you but it's a year-long\njournal I don't know what it's called\nbut I'm going to try and find it again I\nsaw it and it ask questions that you\nwould never normally ask your parents\nand I realized I want to and and I want\nto go back and got all these pictures\nand and um things from when they were\nyounger to actually ask the stories\nbehind the pictures and write them down\nin the album cuz there's one thing about\nhaving like footage of and being like oh\nthis is a nice picture but when you have\nthe depth in the story behind it makes\nit so much more meaningful so I'm going\nto do that with my grandma and my\nparents going to tell you to do that\nwith your mom remember when you tried to\ninterview your grandma I did try to\ninterview my grandma I wish there was a\nway of doing it where she doesn't\nrealize my grandma gets into like\nperformer mode when the camera's out or\nshe gets really serious but I still\nthink I learned so much from her you\nneed to do it in a way when it's you're\njust sitting in a room and just have\ncamer but I do think it's important I\nfollow this page on Instagram that's all\nabout the questions you should ask your\nparents oh my god look this card does\nhand gestures what is that like to\nchange things on the screen oh youed\nyeah it is what do mean I've seen that\non BMWs I forgot you can change songs\nand stuff like this okay but what are\nyou doing right now that's the hand\ngesture I don't know what I'm doing\nright now but that would be like if a\nsong is playing yeah I think it's so\nnice getting to know your parents before\nyou to be able to understand them and\nhow they are with you now MH mhm I\ndefinitely want to invest time in doing\nthat yeah definitely it was really\nbeautiful really really special and her\nbook is amazing it's called um think\nyou'll be happy M it's really really\nspecial it's really grateful to have her\nas a guest on the\npodcast uh and then we're both excited\nfor Christmas oh I was going to say my\nsister's wedding was one of those times\nthat I feel like I really got to\ncelebrate her and I think it's so\ninteresting you get very few\nopportunities to celebrate the people\nthat you love and you almost have to\ntake all of them and create more because\npeople don't take that much time to\ncelebrate their own lives and we don't\ntake time to celebrate the people's\npeople's lives Liv that we love yeah so\ntrue birthday are a good opportunity to\ndo that if you do it properly yeah so\nwho are you wearing\nno oh my god look okay\nR I love how you have energy for stuff\nlike\nthat\nokay now I was just thinking that my\nsister's wedding was honestly just so\nmuch fun talking about spending time\nwith family and talking about doing\namazing things so my sister had five\nevents across 7 days she had a proper\nIndian wedd with an average attendance\nof over 300 people at every single event\na small Indian wding and that was a\nsmall Indian wedding but it was insane\nand I was more run down from her wedding\nthan I was your tour from my tour and I\nthink the reason is because it was so\nemotional as well oh my God this boy I\nmust have CRI yeah I must have cried\nlike was just crying every day I must\nhave cried every day every hour the\nwhole ceremony you were crying as well\nhe looked across he I would look across\nhim and he'd be crying and then\nnaturally when people cry I cry\nobviously I just also love their\nrelationship it's so sweet it's it's one\nof the sweetest brother sister\nrelationships I've ever come across and\nthere was one time where he turned to me\nand he just stopped crying and then\nsuddenly I look over he's crying again\nhe looks at me he goes she was saying\nher vows she's so well\nspoken I was like okay great yeah she's\nshe did really good speeches like she\nwent to elocution classes when she was\nyounger she he was just really he was\nwhing up at her speech so beautifully I\nthink she said like one line but you\nwere crying as well of course I was\ncrying we love her she's just like she's\na baby yeah she's your kid yeah it was\nreally cute it was really cute and then\nI cried throughout my whole speech cried\nthroughout the whole speech blubbering\naway it was really sweet though I don't\nthink do you know what it was actually\nthis the speech was half sweet and half\nsassy yeah the first half was legendary\nfirst half normally you know in speeches\npeople have a bit of banter J took it\nall the way banter it was it was a f on\nComedy set it was yeah who knew you were\nfunny I did you did I think what it was\nright about the wedding was I actually\nrealized just how much my sister loves\nme and I realized how much I love her\nlike it was like that was what I was\nfeeling I you how how you didn't know\nhow much your sister loves you you are\nliterally the epitome of like you're\njust everything to her there is nothing\nyou could do wrong in her eyes and even\nif you do she's forgiven it within like\n5 Seconds well I think it's also you\nknow what it is but she knows how much\nyou love her that's why I think because\nwe live far I think sometimes I have to\nput some of my feelings aside to get on\nwith my focus and my drive MH and\nthere's an element of where I have\nto I don't get to express those emotions\nall year round yeah but I am carrying\nthem internally and then they all come\nout in that moment because I don't you\nknow I don't get to see my sister every\nweek I don't get to talk all the time\nand when I do even I've never found\nphone conversations to be as fulfilling\nand as deep as being in person and so I\nfeel like I carried that love around and\nthen it was all all had to come out you\nwere so wonderful you helped her with\nthe wedding so much love she was so\ngrateful to you and you did so much for\nthe wedding it was amazing and she did\nan amazing job planning an epic wedding\nI was like I don't know how someone\nplans five events
