you're\nthinking about topics you're exploring\nthemes that you're wondering about and\nthis was one of those that I can't wait\nto share with you this has been a theme\nI've been fascinated about we're talking\nto the expert the person who's thinking\nabout it differently who's open to the\nidea of This truly being Discovery all\nbased on curiosity Dr rul jandal is a\ndual trained brain surgeon and\nneuroscientist at City of Hope in Los\nAngeles Dr John dial leads the John deal\nlab which explor the intersection of\nneurobiology and cancer as part of his\nnonprofit that he founded he teaches and\nperforms pediatric neurosurgery in\ncharity hospitals in South America and\nEastern Europe today we're talking about\nhis newest book out now this is why you\ndream welcome to the show rul johnel\nRaul it's great to see you pleasure mine\nthank you for being here yeah I'm\nexcited to do this yeah I'm really\ngrateful like I said to you honestly\nthis is usually when we're doing an\ninterview I'm like all right I'm going\nto you know I've got certain questions\nI'm going to go with the flow and the\namount of questions we've had from our\nteam our audience our community it's\nnever happened before I'm just telling\nyou that and so you're going to see me\nreading out questions from real people\nwho've sent them in for you to\nunderstand more about dreaming which I\nthink is probably one of the most\nundiscovered untapped misunderstood or\ncompletely\nof our life so let's dive straight into\nit and the first question I have for you\nis does everyone dream I think so so\nthere here's how I describe it I would\nfirst say let's bust a major myth that\ndreaming and sleep is a time of rest for\nour brains our brains are not resting\nwhile we sleep just imagine somebody\nlying down and when they're sleeping the\nheart is flickering a little bit of\nelectricity from the EKG that we put on\nthe surface of the heart we put a bunch\nof stickers on the surface of the scalp\nand there's vibrant electricity while\nwe're sleeping the electricity our brain\ngenerates while we sleep is as hot as\nthe electricity our brains are\ngenerating now so that's the first thing\nthe second thing is the heart when it's\npushing up the blood the brain is\nmopping up glucose it's burning hot\nmetabolically so inside our skull while\nwe're lying down even though we don't\nremember a lot of it we're burning hot\nand we're sparking electricity so people\nwho remember their dreams and people who\ndon't remember their dreams that brain\nis still sparking hot and generating a\nlot of electricity so I think it's more\nof memory recall in the morning at the\nsame time we all know about a nightmare\nso we've all had one dream the question\nis why do some people dream more dream\nless or remember their dreams more\nremember their dreams less and that's\nsomething I think is related to the\nvariety of human experience we don't\nhold our waking thoughts to the same\nrigid Contours right so our Dreamscape\nour dream life is individual between us\nand and we remember more when we're\nyounger we remember less as we get older\nand then in certain diseases dreams come\nto the rescue and it seems now that at\nthe end of life like with my cancer\npatients uh dreams return and they're\nthey're filled with reconciliation you\nwere thinking they're struggle like you\nknow there would be dark but they're\nactually positive so those patterns of\ndreams are there the brain electricity\nis firing while we sleep and that's the\nsort of foundation from which I try to\nfind meaning in dreaming absolutely I\nmean the book is called this is why you\ndream dream why do we dream and why is\nit important for us to understand why we\ndream because I think a lot of people\nsay yeah I dream sometimes sometimes I\ndon't who cares what's the big deal but\nI'm fascinated by it I know a lot of\npeople are so why do we dream and why is\nit important to try to understand why we\ndream the it's not a big deal it's\ncompletely off for those people who\nthink it if they understand onethird of\nOur Lives is potentially spent dreaming\nand the brain shuts us down right it's\njust onethird like can't be passive and\nit puts you down right like you get\nsleep pressure like you I got to sleep\nwell when I was in training and surgical\ntraining we skip a night of sleep what\nhappens when somebody Skips a night of\nsleep the next night they dream harder\nand earlier if I can be so bold I think\nsleep is for the brain it's not for our\nthigh muscle it's not for our liver\nthere are some metabolic changes I'm not\ndiscounting all of it but the real thing\ndriving us to sleep is our brain what\ndoes our brain do just vibrantly when we\nsleep it's dream so that's like my\nStraight Up answer by like that thing\nthat's not happening on accident right\nthat's not a glitch that didn't last\nthrough uh 30,000 Generations\naccidentally and so then the question\nbecomes if we have this vibrant\none-third of Our Lives that we partially\nremember sometimes remember sometimes\nit's an exciting Journey sometimes an\nerotic Journey sometimes it's a\nnightmare like what's that all about you\nknow and the way I've come to understand\nit is first you know giv respect to\npeople whove tried to come up with some\nideas like it's a threat rehearsal if\nwe're running from a a woolly mammoth in\nour dreams we're better prepared for\nduring the day what I would say is maybe\nand when I say maybe you're likely it's\nout of respect for you and your\nlisteners I don't want to be that guy\nthat comes in here says yes no about\nsomething as big and magical as dreaming\nso threat rehearsal maybe some people\nthink it's a nocturnal therapist because\ntowards the morning when we have more of\nour vivid dreams the emotional balance\nthe veilance they call it tends to be\nmore positive maybe I like to think of\nit as something that Sparks creativity\nbecause of what happens with the\ndreaming brain the dreaming brain looks\nfor looser dots to connect it's\nimaginative by Design logic is dampened\ndown so I think it's our creativity\nengine and then the way I put it all\ntogether is with something straight up\ncalled use it or lose it that people\nknow about when we talk about the brain\nright they say hey use it or lose it we\nknow if we don't use our biceps the\natrophy but our day if you look at the\nbrain activation electricity is so\nnarrow nrow the brain wants to be\nefficient right cuz it's an energy hog\nit's only like four or five lbs but it\nuses 20% of our blood so the brain\nduring the day to navigate the world\ntask on outward executive Network logic\nwants to be efficient driving down the\none1 easily going on the tube easily not\nhave to activate everything to get that\ndone if we only use those limited parts\nof our brain during the day and then\nhave some way to high-intensity train\nthem those would go deric we wouldn't\nuse them and we may lose them so I think\nin the biggest way possible is that\ndreaming process dreams and dreaming is\nhigh-intensity training for our brain it\nkeeps those Corners engaged it keeps\nthose neurons firing that might not\nduring the day and those are available\nto us the next day for a creative\nprocess for the next day or the next\nyear or the Next Generation for an\nAdaptive process that's my biggest most\nromantic way of thinking about about why\nwe dream so hard yeah I like the maybe\nbecause I think we've all had different\ndreams that you feel you had for\ndifferent reasons and there are some\ndreams that you did feel were like you\nsaid like your nocturnal therapist this\nfeeling of like okay I'm I'm healing I'm\nlearning you're working something out\nyeah you're working something out I've\ndefinitely had dreams where I feel like\noh my gosh like this feels like it's\nmirroring my reality and I'm either\npreparing or I'm dealing with it\ninternally and and I think you're so\nright that there's so many different\nprocesses and it's hard to nail it down\nto one is there a way to start to label\nand Define or do you think that's\nunhealthy when it comes to Dreaming\nperfect question so to the maybe I'll\nadd likely you know not yes and not no\nwhen it come my dream your dream\ninfinitely wild okay but what happens\nwhen you start looking at 10,000 dreams\nwhat happens when you start so I'm over\nhere so there is no like professor of\ndream science right so when I was like\nwhen they asked me the publisher asked\nme like can you put a b together about\nthis I think we were vibing about this\nbefore we uh uh before we went live with\nthis or recording with this and it was\nlike they're like you wrote this thing\nabout the brain like you know smart\ndrugs Alzheimer's creativity then you\nwrote this thing about the mind like\nresilience and Trauma and belief and\nabout your own\nstruggles why don't you put together\nsomething about dreams from a scientific\nperspective that everybody can read and\nI was like there are going to be so many\ngaps and they said then let us know\nwhere the gap apps are say maybe say\nlikely and say I I wonder I believe and\nthat's what I've tried to do in the book\nbut to your question about when I\nstarted this process when I looked at\nnot your dream my dream but 10,000\ndreams Aristotle was writing about lucid\ndreaming a couple hundred years ago\nthey're still writing about being chased\nor falling and I was like wait a second\nthere are patterns to dream reports like\nnow they have dream Banks so the first\nthing I noticed was nightmares and iotic\ndreams are essentially Universal and I\nsay essentially because it's 90 Plus in\nthis world is considered 100 right\nbecause that's just how science Works uh\nwhen you look at questionnaires and\nsurveys so everybody's had a nightmare\nerotic dreams are almost all the way up\nthere and then chasing falling uh\nfalling teeth that seems to be common\nand then there was a dream that was very\nrarely reported doing math now I don't\nlike math so I was like that's all good\nfor me but but you start when you look\nat lots of thousands of dreams you're\nlike why is that one so low then now now\nwalk with me over here then you start\nlooking at brain scans and brain\nelectricity and what happens what's the\ndifference between the waking brain and\nthe dreaming brain right in a 24-hour\ncycle we're about 2/3 waking brain and\nonethird dreaming brain and there are\nsome transition zones that I love like I\ncall them Lial States or blurry zones\nthat we can get into but that when you\nsee that and you say well what's the\ndifference I started off like they're\nboth burning hot they're both sparkling\nelectricity so what's the difference so\nwhen you go from waking brain to\nDreaming brain what happens is the need\nto look outward changes right and so the\nexecutive Network a collection of\nstructures not just one thing dampens\nlogic and math ability dampen they don't\nturn off nothing turns off in the brain\notherwise that you know you'd have a\nstroke so it dampens the imagination\nNetwork and the emotional systems called\nthe limic structures are liberated so if\nwe know now that the dreaming brain as a\nmeasurement not my opinion right we can\ntalk about opinions but this a\nmeasurement if the dreaming brain has\ndampened logic and reason and math\nliberated emotion hyper visual it kind\nof makes sense why we don't see a lot of\nmath because that part of the brain that\ndoes that isn't taking a backseat while\nwe dream so I said okay even if that's\nthe only thing I can say in this book\nand some youngster you know 10 20 30\nyears from now takes more data from\ndream banks that are more in clusive and\nbringing in more people that patterns of\nhow we dream you know and what we dream\ncan be explained by the brain I that to\nme that was fascinating so dreams are\nnot Limitless yours is mine is but when\nyou look at a lot of them nightmares\nhappen universally erotic dreams happen\nessentially universally and then we find\nvery emotional visual movement B based\ndreams that's fascinating I mean you\ndon't even think about it that way and I\nthink so often it's kind of\nit's interesting because it's a\nmicrocosm of how we live our lives like\nwe live our lives thinking no one\nunderstands me no one knows what I'm\ngoing through only I have this\nexperience and then all of a sudden when\nyou zoom out and you look at the\npatterns you're like wait a minute we're\nall struggling with the same thing I was\njust talking to someone earlier and we\nwere talking about how like we seem to\nbe the problem solvers in our families\nand then you start realizing how wait a\nminute we're all trying to solve the\nsame problems we're dealing with the\nsame emotions and those patterns are so\nuseful in finding so have they basically\nlooked at dream patterns and then looked\nat stress patterns and lifestyle\npatterns like is that what you're\nmeasuring them against or what are the\npatterns being measured against so if\nout of the 10,000 people 9,000 people\ndreamt about their teeth falling out\nwhat then are we measuring in their life\nto make sense of that dream yeah that's\na great question and also we tend to\nfall into the same traps right I think\nthat looking at brain science shows that\nyes we're individuals but what's driving\nus and what's holding us back is also\nsomething we share that's why these\nconversations that's why a certain book\na certain song or certain interaction\ncan kind of liberate you and so the way\nI I would explain this is uh the dream\npatterns that they're looking at and\nwhen I say they I mean 20 40 Years of\ndifferent studies I'm trying to stitch\nit together let me give you a specific\none there was one survey questionnaire\nwhere women going through divorce when\ntheir dreams they were reconciling in\ntheir dreams that things were breaking\nup and people moving on those as a group\ntended to recover from divorce better\nand so when you when you just look and\nyou say okay that's in that's very\ninteresting those that were struggling\nin their dreams were also ones more\nlikely to have depression longer and so\nwhat that does to me is that invites a\nconversation so does the dream or the\ndreaming brain kind of give a clue to\nhow well you're coping with your real\nWaking Life stress that by itself is\npowerful that one it knows about it it's\nit ain't some other brain it's your\nbrain it's just in this dreaming mode so\nit knows about it your Waking Life is\nfeeding your dream life I mean six seven\neight hours how are you processing how\nare you digesting how are you\nmetabolizing the most difficult thing in\nyour day and I think that's where I love\nit is that it's not distinct and that\nthe dreaming brain can be your Shepherd\nit can be the thing that helps you\nprocess emotional trauma and for p\npeople with PTSD it can actually\nactually play back flashbacks so it's\nit's a wild space that leans emotional\nleans visual let me give you a second\nexample with my patients end of life\ncancer patients dreams are expansive\npositive filled with reconciliation as\nthey're asking for surgery and all that\nyou would think they're all going to be\nhorrific because it's dark time stress\nright you think day stress is is is\nturned into dreaming stress but but the\nconnection is not clear and that's where\nI think there's power in in in our dream\nlife I think in general when I look at\nall the surveys dreaming is Our\nShepherd uh at the end of life I think\nnightmares and erotic dreams cultivate\nthe young mind much like our minds are\ncultivating adolescence dreams mirror\nand reflect what's going on uh during\nour life for example pregnancy dreams\nwomen have who are pregnant their dreams\nare very different rolling over in bed\nwhat the babies are going to be Rec\ncalled so sometimes waking anxiety and\ndream anxiety clearly linked I got to\ngive a talk tomorrow I got a dream I'm\nshowing up naked I got to uh you know I\ngot an exam alarms sometimes they're\nclear sometimes they're your companion\npregnancy dreams uh end of life dreams\nsometimes they're just junk not\neverything's going to make sense right\nour Waking Life doesn't make sense so I\nthink when you start to look at those\ncategories the fourth category being\nUniversal dreams nightmares and erotic\ndreams and children then the one we're\nleft with that the one that now I spend\neven more time with is that hyper\nemotional hyper visual that lingers into\nthe next day what I would say is don't\nlet that one go that's a solar flare\nfrom your brain in a unique state that\nyou can't get to during the day hyper\nemotional hyper liberated the\nmeasurements of emotion in our dreaming\nbrain can reach a top speed our waking\nbrain can never reach so for me when I\nlook at when I look at the whole thing\nthe hyper emotional hyper visual with a\ncentral image is a dream that has broken\nout from your dream life that is about\nyou that a therapist can't get to I mean\nit's your brain conjured it and that's\none to reflect on what I would say is\nlike not every time not everyone but in\nour search for wellness and healing\nthat's a an a free and accessible portal\nand when I was working on this book with\nthe UK Publishers there were like seven\nor eight people who are like We're\nDreaming more we're remembering our\ndreams more some Lucid you know had\nlucid dreams so that's the second thing\nI would say is that this can be induced\nand cultivated you're not a passenger\nwith your dream life and what you\nremember from your dream life you can\nalso cultivate that you're not a\npassenger at that stage either let's\ntalk about that a little so I was going\nto ask you if you don't remember your\ndream I if you don't make the\nsubconscious conscious does that mean\nthat it doesn't have an effect and that\nyou encouraging us to take time to\nactually make the subconscious conscious\nand reflect on our dreams I would say\nthe first question is I can't answer\nthat fully the second question is\nabsolutely try to engage your dream life\nsleep entry when you go from waking to\nDreaming like Salvador Dolly did or\nChristopher Nolan's talking about\ninception sleep exit which we can get\ninto lucid dreaming the answer to the\nquestion should we engage our Dream Life\nyes yes yes I got a lot of science on\nthat I got a lot of person expence on\ninto that I mean there's so many things\nI want to talk about but let's seeing as\nwe've gone there now let's let's dive\ninto it now so let's talk about the\nprocess of being more of a proactive\nleader in our dreams and not a passenger\nin our dreams what does that look like\nbecause I would argue that anyone I talk\nto we're all passengers in our dreams we\nsimply go to bed we may remember we may\nnot remember we show up it's like a car\nJourney you jumped in the car you went\nasleep for a bit you got to the other\nside maybe you remember a tree you saw\nthe way or your mom and dad did\nsomething when you were a kid but you\ndon't remember most of and it doesn't\nreally matter you're in the driver's\nseat of a car you can't control it seems\nthat way that one will get to with lucid\ndreaming but how you can affect your\ndreams because we've gotten into the\nscience I believe they're relevant let's\ntake this first stage you you go from\nwaking to Dreaming right whatever time\nthat is not every time not for everyone\nbut just the fact that it's possible\nthat's something called Sleep\nentry okay with those surface on our on\nour scalp the electricity Blends it's\nit's like a Lial State like I was I used\nto be a scuba diver when when you go\nfrom a freshwater river to an ocean it's\nnot like there's a crisp line there's a\nblurry Zone similarly when we go from\nwaking to Dreaming there's about a 10 15\nminute period called Sleep entry\nSalvador Dolly and some current tech\ncompanies in San Francisco They believe\nthat during that period you kind of sort\nof have access to that divers ENT\ncreative ideation of dreaming and that\nthey can extract ideas from there so\nmuch so Thomas Edison with the light\nbulb would like have would fall asleep\nin a chair and when he'd fall asleep and\nhe startle himself awake he'd write down\nwhat he was thinking that that was a\nscene in Inception right so I'm just\nbring I'll bring the science in but\nthat's there Christopher Nolan's talking\nabout that salor Dolly wrote a book\nabout that you know his stuff is real\nlike the and so what that that period is\nthe first entry into dream life that\nthat you can still hold on to and what\nwe're finding is that people have more\ninteresting ideas they have more\nDivergent thinking and creative ideas at\nthat window is that but to be clear your\ntrouble at work you got to create a\nproject is that going to guarantee it no\nbut it's a habit of respecting that\ntransition Lial Zone as a portal to a\nstate your brain is not in when you're\nawake or not in when you're dreaming\nright so that's that's one thing that\npeople can do to cultivate in that same\narea some people feel and Report\nquestionnaires and surveys not\nmeasurements that what you think about\nat that\ntime uh will be more likely to populate\nyour dream life whether you remember or\nnot and may lead to the aha moment the\nnext day let me give you a specific\nexample I'm a cancer surgeon cancer eats\nof blood vessels and tissue in different\nways on challenging cases I'll flip the\nP images through as the last thing I go\nto bed thinking about and somebody asked\nme this in London they said well did you\ndream of surgery I said no I've never\ndreamt I've never dreamt of surgery but\nI have a lot of dreams of scuba diving\nnavigating mazes going through Forest\nwow and so what I what I concluded is my\nopinion is that that it's a\nthree-dimensional space and I know I'm\nworking on a three-dimensional creative\nproject and that my dream life is\nsomehow um rehearsing that practicing\nthat providing me with that maneuver in\na complex surgy and I say man that that\nthat was uh where did that come from\nsometimes I think it wasn't like in this\nscenario six I will come up with\nsolution four no like things arise\nduring our Waking Life and I think the\ndreaming brain builds that so sleep\nentry uh for waking up uh intentionally\nand writing down your thoughts and\njournaling at that moment journaling in\ngeneral about what you want to dream\nabout for me looking at pictures about a\nsurgery those are specific things as you\nfall asleep that somebody can try wow\nthat's fascinating because I think\njournaling has taken off so much in\nculture but and I'm trying to bring some\nscience to it I I think the act of\njournaling straight after waking up like\nimmediately I know for a fact that if I\npick up my phone first thing in the\nmorning which I try to avoid to do but\nwhen it does happen I forget my dream\nimmediately yeah I and I know I wake up\nkind of in a dream state and then I\ncompletely shut it off have you found\nlinks between going to sleep with your\nphone or without your phone and how that\naffects our dreams or if you watch a\nparticular show and TV and how does that\naffect your dream and what you do in the\nmorning does that have any correlation\nor so that's a great question the thing\nyou said about waking up I I'll get to\nthat as sleep exit because there's some\ninteresting science there but when\nyou're looking at all these surveys\nthat's why I opened up with like we need\nmore dream Banks we need people who have\na greater exposure to social media uh to\nstart talking about their dreams at this\npoint it doesn't look like they populate\ndreams Ro for let's take a specific\nexample erotic dreams tend to be about a\nnarrow group of people in your life\nfamily even when you're younger\nrepellent bosses and celebrities so I'm\ncurious to see like right like so now\nthat doesn't mean there's 100 papers on\nthat but those are the spr that's the\nsprinkling of information that I saw\nlike so what becomes familiar to us\nbosses well you know people can have\nlike awkward dreams about bosses right\nthey have sexual dreams about people\nthey actually are not attracted to\nthat's a big category erotic dreams but\nis there any reasoning to that\nspecifically because of being uh erotic\ndreams about people you're not attracted\nto like where does that come from I\ndon't know I think now we're getting\ninto opinion I think I think it's a\npower Dynamic play and I think intimacy\ncan be both collaborative and also a\npower Dynamic and some mix of it all\nright but that's just that's an\nexploration but erotic dreams since\nwe're there and we'll get back to sleep\nexit is um they're interesting we all\nget them they come before we've done the\nerotic act even if we haven't seen it so\nit's it's almost like an instruction if\nyou will um an inherit of thinking not\njust risk- taking or mental health but\nwe inherit those dreams even if people\nwho' never go on to have sex they still\nhave erotic dreams almost like a\nPlaybook that's meant for our mind to\nactivate our brain and bodies for the\nACT to procreate that's the big topic\nthe specific thing is across cultures\ndifferent over Generations the\npercentages are surprisingly similar 90\nplus the other surprising thing is that\n80 to 90% in these reports\ninfidelity cheating is common and erotic\ndreams whether you're in a healthy\nrelationship whether you're lying about\nin a healthy relationship and coveting\nsomebody else or whether you're in a bad\nrelationship it's almost like a almost\nlike a semi- built-in thing and I think\nthat's how I've learned to think about\nerotic dreams is that's just desire it's\nlike a flare of Desire interestingly\ntends to be toward a narrow group but\nthe acts tend to be wild there's a few\npoints that you made in the book that\nfascinated me seeing as we're on the\ntopic of erotic dreams I was sharing\nwith the team earlier so there's three\nthings here but let's go one by one so\nerotic dreams are not fueled by\nmasturbation or pornography walk me\nthrough that that's what some reports a\ndecade ago mentioned now that might be\nchanging but what's interesting to me\nthere is it's not what we do during the\nday that shows up in our erotic dreams\nit's actually what we fantasize about\nsecretly during our day that's more\nlikely to show up in our erotic dreams\nand scientifically to me I think that\nmakes a lot of sense because the\ndreaming process is the imagination\nNetwork liberated so it makes sense that\nwhat you imagine in your dream life is\nmore connected to the fantasy you're\nhaving while you're awake it doesn't\nmatter the sexual act the sexual person\nthat what you uh what brings someone to\nclimax the thoughts they have during\nthat process with their love or without\ntheir level it's the internal thinking\nof Desire during the day that tends to\nfind itself uh in erotic dreams and to\nme that's consistent if you think about\nthe dreaming brain uh as something that\nhas the liberated imagination Network\nit's an imaginative process right your\neyes are closed that movie you're making\nfor yourself so whatever you're thinking\nabout during the day you know that's the\nmovie you're making at night so then\ngoing back to what you were saying\nearlier though if someone's in a happy\nrelationship but you're saying it's\nstill common for them to cheat in their\ndreams no that's a separate pattern yeah\nyeah that's a pattern that you've seen\nso is that an argument then that that\nperson may be happy in their\nrelationship but then they're okay\nfantasizing I can't answer that because\nit would no I love the question that's a\ndeep question what I would say to you is\nfrom there what people ask is if you\nhave dreams tend to have more\nbisexuality so does that mean you have\nyou're bisexual you just haven't figured\nthat out out or you're not sharing that\nwith somebody during the day I can't\nanswer that but I think as we bring in\nmore reports from dream Banks and bring\nin more cultures more backgrounds more\ngenders and more more diverse sort of\nperspectives on sexuality will get\ninsights into that but that's a very\nindividual thing so as a whole there's a\nlot of cheating in erotic dreams as a\nwhole what shows up in our erotic dreams\nis what we imagine and then it leaves it\nto the person that's why I open with\nlike you you know people have asked me\nlike if you dream of your ex does that\nmean you really want them I was like\nwell if you're seriously thinking to\nstill think if you're hung up on them\nduring the day and you dream about your\nex that means one thing but if you're\nlike no I've really moved on and a lover\npops up in your dream I think that's\njust a solar flare of Desire I wouldn't\nmake much of that I think that's the\nhard part right I think what we don't\nknow is how seriously to take some of\nthe take a dream or not because I feel\nlike a lot of people exactly like you\njust said you have a dream about\nsomething you're thinking oh God maybe I\nneed that maybe I don't and and and is\nthat a lack of self-awareness is it\nbecause the dream is not clear like how\ndo we how have you thought about that as\nyou've reflected on dreaming how do we\nget better at knowing whether to take a\ndream seriously or not because I feel\nlike that would help solve so much of\nour conundrum or dilemas that's created\nby Dreams yeah it's a big question it's\na big question it's a big question I\nwould love to know your thoughts yeah my\nopinion about it is that uh one dreams\nshould not be neglected okay uh\nnightmares if they pop up and they\narrive out of the blue they shouldn't be\nneglected I think uh dreams that are\nflashbacks after PTSD obviously should\nnot be neglected so there's some dreams\nthat have a uh an easier rule to follow\nif you will but then what about those\nother dreams that you're bringing up\nright like intensely emotional that\nlinger with you during the day and\nyou're wondering like wait a second is\nthat an insight to myself that I don't\neven have yet about myself myself should\nI discuss this with a therapist should I\ndiscuss this with my lover and I think\nthe way I've um started to reflect on my\ndreams a bit more is that when they are\nhyper\nemotional it's an\ninvitation to look at your life\ndifferently all right I'm I feel like\nI'm doing well I'm high achieving I'm\ndoing this I'm not you know you feel\nlike no it's fine I'm dealing with a\nbroken relationship like but if you\nstart having nightmares or if you have\nemotional dreams dreams that are filled\nwith fright or regret I'm not saying\nthat that there's never an automatic\nlink right other than the showing up\nnaked at a Podium or alarm not going off\nbut the one that's powerful haunts you\ndoesn't make sense that's an invitation\nto think about something and back to our\noriginal conversation to me uh that's a\nlife well examined is paying attention\nto the\nemotional powerful dreams that you have\nthat linger with you the dream is\nsymbolic to get to your answer in the\nmost specific way the dream is a\nmetaphor the dream is symbolism because\nthe from the dreaming brain and you've\nhyper visual hyper emotional it's not\ngoing to spell it out for you it's going\nto be metaphorical it's going to be\nsymbolic specific example Vietnam\nveterans who had PTSD got better they\nstart going through divorce they're not\nand they're struggling they're not\ndreaming of divorce they're dreaming of\nWar again so the experiences you're\nhaving having they're an invitation to\nreflect the meaning is metaphorical and\nsymbolic all based on how the dreaming\nbrain is built and it's personal it's\nhard to say a bridge or a light bulb in\nyour life at this moment is going to be\nthe same meaning for me at this at this\nmoment my life or my life 10 years from\nnow not just former versions of myself\nso I'm not here to refute anything but\nit's a very personal process your brain\nmade it it's hyper it's a emotion to a\nhyper emotional state it could mean\nnothing it could mean something but what\nI'm I'm here to say is take a look at it\nyeah I it's not just static no I I I\nthink that's I completely agree with you\nI think it's a great point and I feel\nlike it's really interesting because it\nthen goes back to the idea that humans\nare meaning makers and that we're\nstorytellers and if you're looking at a\nmet got a lot on that man then you're\ntrying to figure out and if you have a\nif you have a negativity bias in your\nconscious mind I wonder how much like\nI'll give an example I was talking to\nsomeone the other day and they were\nsaying that they'd been dreaming about\nbears and so I started Googling what\nthat means and I was you know G to ask\nyou and I was I was Googling about it it\nwas really interesting because in a\nconscious State a big bear feels scary\nand it feels like death and it feels\nlike run away and that's how they saw a\nbear in their dream but then when you\nlooked at the dream spiritual version\nwhatever you call it the sorry when you\nlook at dream interpretation the\ninterpretation of that was Bears\nrepresent strength and they represent\ncourage and they have the symbol in now\nI go so it's a right it depends yeah it\ndepends depends on which brain conjured\nup which image yeah you work in the\ncircus bear means one thing you know\nyou're a hunter bear means one thing you\nknow in culture bear means something\nelse so I like that but just to go back\nto something that you know I've been\nI've been moving around and people have\nasked me stuff the question you just\nasked is is is something special about\nare we meaning makers and now this this\ngoing to take me a little time to open\nup on this but what's what's interesting\nand again I don't have all the ansers\nthis conversation uh is that in the\ndreaming brain even though the logic and\nreason areas are dampened specifically\nthe dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex is\nit's right behind our sort of horns in\nthe prefrontal cortex that pushed our\nbrains forward there's another area\ncalled the medial prefrontal cortex\nthat's preserved it it stays throbbing\nit's actually liberated a little bit and\nyou know what that one does it does\nsomething we only figured out when we\naccidentally injure it or somebody has a\nstroke in that area it Stitches the\nstory of our life\ntogether powerful right and so what's\nhappening this is this is this is cool\nwhat's happening is your motions and\nyour vision centers and your movement\ncenters are just firing up stuff linked\ndirectly indirectly to the stuff you fed\nit during the day the stuff your life\nfed it right your life your memory plus\nthe imagination and then the medial\nprefrontal cortex is there putting a\nstory to it dreams often not always are\nstories they have a narrative component\nthey're emotional they're visual they\nhave a narrative component our brains\nwant to make a cohesive story I know\nthat for a lot of reasons and the\ndreaming brain is something that also\npreserves that and some have even\nextended that say like well maybe that's\nwhy we can you know we get movies that\nhave jumps of ideas people go from one\nplace to the other like art dreaming the\nway we dream prepares us for the way we\nappreciate art right so we can let that\ngo this way on this on this side some of\nmy patients with certain complications\nand certain tumors and different things\nthey'll wake up and they won't feel\ncertain parts of their body and they'll\ndevelop something called uh neglect or\nthey'll develop something what it's\ncalled confabulation it's a fancy word\nfor lying when the body signals are\ndisconjugate they don't make sense the\nbrain the mind will make up a story to\nmake it all fit and some patients have\nactually tried to throw a leg they don't\nfeel off the bed and they say oh that\nwas a stranger and so you see things\nwith the injured brain and the healing\nbrain that there's a drive within us\nsometimes we'll even lie to ourselves\nand other others to create a consistent\nor a story that makes sense to ourselves\nmeaning and I think if you look at that\nat the brain level and you look at that\nat the dreaming level what I try to tell\npeople in my first book Is look at that\nat the life level like our maturation\nisn't done just with adolescence right\nthe work has to continue to cultivate\nyour brain and your mind and your life\nso when you get through a struggle and\nyou you get through it that prepares you\nfor the next one if you're in a struggle\nnow that's just overwhelming like\nsomething difficult so hard don't worry\ncuz you're cultivating that Str stress\nfor the next one and I think all of\nthose pieces not measurements but my\nopinion that we are meaning makers we\nare storytellers uh in the moments of\nour lives in our dreaming brain uh in\nour life in general and the area where\nstories and emotions are the wildest\nwith our dreams and that's why I think\nwhy we dream is something bigger than\njust threat rehearsal I think it's\nsomething powerful when we wake up and\nthat Clarity is is because our\nsubconscious has had its run do are\npeople having when you look at the data\nare people having the same dream again\nand again and again or are they having\ndifferent dreams every night Mo well\nthat's a that's a good question so there\nare recurrent dreams it's a specific\nexample the only thing I can say with\ncertainty is dreams come from our brain\nwe do these Exotics brain surgeries\nwhere we wake people up to map the\nsurface of their brain you don't feel\nyou wouldn't know if I touched your\nbrain if the situation ever Rose which\nit won't but like the brain doesn't feel\nthe brain feels through its nerves so we\ncan dissect the brain and somebody while\nthey're talking the point there is is is\nnot is not to scare anybody that's a\ntherapeutic process but when we tickle\nand map the brain they'll say oh I\nremember this nightmare from when I was\na kid you can activate a recurrent\nnightmare in a patient by tickling the\nsurface of their brain so dreams come\nfrom the brain there are recurrent\ndreams there are that's individual there\nare common dreams across people falling\nbeing chased teeth falling out there are\nUniversal dreams so you you start to see\nall these patterns a recurrent dream is\na loop of electricity in that part of\nyour brain that pops up again and again\nit must be because if we take a little\nfaint pen and tickle it and you have\nthat that dream again that's that's\nbuilt into the the electrical flows of\nyour brain so we have to step back a\nlittle bit when you ask those questions\nbecause there are so many different\ndream types and dream experiences I\ndon't want to give a single answer but\nrecurrent dreams are are Loops of\nelectricity that happen over and over\nagain we can actually activate that and\nthen Universal dreams common dreams and\nrare dreams is how I conceptualize it\nwhat does someone do if they have a\nrecurrent dream that they don't want to\nhave anymore big question um okay so\nlet's look at that um so now we got the\nfoundation waking brain dreaming brain\nhyper imaginative hyper\nemotional um you're cooking up you're\ncreating the events of your Dreamscape\nand I found this to be very powerful\nthat nightmares since we imagined them\nthe treatment for nightmares is\nsomething called imagery rehearsal\ntherapy now I'm not a therapist I mean I\ntake care a lot of cancer patients more\nthan 10,000 in my life so there's a um\nthere's a cultivation uh that I have\nbenefited from from them trusting me uh\nso I think I have some sense of\nunderstanding of human nature\nbut but therapy when you try to help\nsomebody through conversation talk\ntherapy right that's great it seems to\nbe effective that's out there what\nthey're finding is imagery rehearsal\ntherapy is a new thing where imagine\nwhat you want to be imagine something\nyou don't want to have and when I read\nthat I was like H I don't know if I can\nsink my teeth in that until I started\nreading about nightmares and learning\nabout nightmares and across all\ndifferent sciences that if you practice\nbefore you go to bed going back a bit to\nyou're saying that we can actually feed\nour dreams if you practice a new script\nfor the ending of your nightmares you\ncan rescript your nightmares through\nsomething called imagery rehearsal\ntherapy people can look it up and not\nevery time not for everyone but just the\nfact that nightmares can be rescripted\nis\npowerful that you think you're out of\ncontrol but you can feed your dreams you\ncan steer your dreams and lucid dreaming\nis the prime example of that and and\nthat therapy can guide you to a better\nconclusion of your dream I love that as\na scientist because it's the imagin\nNation Network you've imagined this\nnightmare and it's powerful to think now\nyou can actually imagine a different\nkind of ending for this nightmare to me\nthat's all\nscientifically uh uh consistent and to\nme that's why I think it's powerful to\nlook at dreaming as more magical more\nfascinating that it is being driven by\ncertain brain processes right so you\ndon't wake up and say Ah that's that's a\nglitch Ah that's static no there's\nsomething drove that learn about the\nengine behind it and then reflect about\nthe the meaning about it yeah for sure I\nmean I I can relate to that I feel like\nthere have been parts of my life where\nI've been able to code\nthe emotion and feeling and script that\nI wake up with by what I put into the\ncode before I go to bed and so at one\npoint in my life when I was trying to\nwake up early and I didn't enjoy it and\nmy reaction to waking up early in the\nmorning would be I'm so tired I just\njust want to stay in bed I just you know\nand I wanted to wake up early I I\nbelieve that was a worthy Pursuit and a\nhabit to invest in and so I would before\nI went to bed I would say to myself I am\nwaking up energized happy and healthy\nand so even that rescripting in the\nevening I found I would wake up and I\nwould be saying that to myself when I\nwoke up and there was this direct link\nbetween a script that I didn't have it\nwritten in the morning I didn't have it\nthere but that repetition would carry\nover in the morning and I found whenever\nI used it it worked and whenever I don't\nuse it I can still wake up and feel oh\nGod why I waking up so early and so I\nI've sensed moments of that or I've had\nexperiences of that and that coding or\nthat imagery rehearsal therapy that you\nmentioned that would be I would love for\nour audience to practice it Community to\ntry it out and see how it shows up in\nyour life because I think what we don't\nrealize is you're subconsciously\nrehearsing anyway oh yeah right whatever\nyou do the work is going on you're doing\nit yeah yeah whatever you're watching\nreading seeing that is imagery rehearsal\nit's just not therapy and it's not\nconscious but we're doing imagery\nrehearsal throughout the day and before\nwe go to bed and it adds a big question\nhere so when you when you say something\nlike that it ties into positive thinking\nwish fulfillment all these seem these\nnebulous terms that I think some people\nreally Embrace other people poo poo and\nthey say that can't be true would I say\nsomething in the middle if that through\nstudying the the about dreams and\ndreaming I've learned about like what's\nthe biology of how what you just\ndescribed about I think about something\nbefore I go to bed and it helps me wake\nup and I'm you know I'm feeling it more\nI'm thinking about it more in the right\nway like that's just out there right\nthat feels like there's like a kite\nflying flying above our head what I'm\ntrying to get people to understand is\nthe dream the dreams if they can be\ndefined are thoughts emotions and\nactivities that are actually happening\nat the brain level that's what's\nsparking all that electricity if I'm\nrunning in a dream the motor strip that\nmoves my legs the neurons there are\nfiring the signals just aren't getting\nthrough so then what that does is it\nopens up a whole new world of athletes\npracticing the shot in their mind\npositive reinforcement going to bed and\nrescripting your dreams right uh\njournaling like people are like okay so\nso there's brain activity that's leading\nto this mind that I want to get my mind\nto lean a certain way and the brain\nactivity is driving that and so what's\nthe people say well how that happen I\nwould give you the example of placebo\nand so when you believe a medicine is\ngoing to help you even if I tell you\nlook that's there's nothing active in it\nthat's just like sugar um that's just\nsomething that has no capacity to\nchange by the pill itself the physiology\nof your body but belief is enough to\nmake people feel less pain how and I can\ngive you a scientific explanation about\nhow that happens belief you're armed\nwith neurotransmitters that electricity\nthat we're measuring the the chemicals\nthat are floating around think of the\nbrain as like a 100 billion microscopic\njellyfish and there's like electric\nstorms and waves of a of\nneurotransmitters flying around in there\nwhen you believe the pharmacy of your\nmind is actually releasing chemicals and\nthings that generates different\nelectricity that alleviates pain pain\nthat prepares your brain and mind for\nrescripting the nightmare that makes\npositive gives you the scientific basis\npossibly for positive reinforcement\npositive relationships like these are\nactually uh not just emotions but\nthey're working at the level of the\nbrain that's powerful yeah know I love\nthat I love that description and as you\nwere saying that I was thinking about\nthis it it's all coming back to an\nintentionality a programming a like what\nI'm hearing from you is just this idea\nof get active get involved be conscious\nbe aware I was thinking about I remember\nduring the pandemic I probably hadn't up\nuntil the pandemic I probably hadn't\nwatched TV or played video games for\nlike 10 years like consistently at all\nand I think the pandemic kind of you\nknow had had time and we were indoors\nand all the rest of it and so I started\nwatching TV I remember one of the shows\nI was watching with which I really\nenjoyed watching was ozar and I can I\nremember watching ozar every day for 30\ndays in a row and it's not even the\nscaryest show and while I was watching I\nprobably didn't feel anything and\nsomehow I felt that I had to dream every\nnight that my house was being broken\ninto like that that was an experience\nthat I was having and I connected the\ntwo because as someone who didn't have\nnightmares as an adult and as someone\nwho didn't watch that much TV those were\nthe only two changes that I had at least\nnoticed or if if we get back to that\nit's symbolic maybe it's the stress of\nthe pandemic I mean so it's never going\nto be pinned down uh exactly but you're\nright the paying attention to the\npatterns of your dreams More Than Just A\nDream unless it's hyper emotional but\nthe pattern of dreams I think is an\nimportant thing to do like and how does\nour Waking Life feed our our Dream Life\nwhat I will tell you is when color\ntelevision arrived and magazines the\ndream reports show a bump in people\nhaving uh color color dreams like there\nwere more black and white dreams when TV\nwas black and white and I was like wait\nbut the world is in color and what I'm\nsaying to you is that's why this topic\nis so fresh because it doesn't all make\nsense the science gives some insight and\nthe exploration reveals there's so many\nthings we don't understand the the\ntake-home is it's not a p it's not a\npassive process it's not something that\nis coming from the gods or Omens it's\nyour brain giving you thoughts emotions\ndreams and potentially insights that you\ncan't have access to with your waking\nbrain and to me that's a special portal\nand how people cultivate that I think\nit's up to them I'm here to let people\nknow that there's a rigorous science\nbehind the brain biology brain chemistry\nbrain electricity that drives dreaming\nyeah I mean that bump in color\ntelevision I can't imagine when we have\nenough data to look at the social media\nbump right because to me it's bizarre to\nfeel that exposure to social media\npornography uh being on the online world\ndoesn't lead to specific or certain\ndreams like especially with the hours\nthat people are putting in right yeah\nexactly so that would be the next wave\nand my hope is that somebody listening\nto this you know as I mentioned I'm 51\nI've got three sons 18 19 22 in college\nlike my hope is somebody walks away and\nsays oh wait some of the stuff about\ndreams can be explained by the brain\nbecause imagine in 20 30 years how much\nmore data we'll have through people with\nonline dream Banks and how much more\nwe'll know about Neuroscience imagine\nthe connections that somebody sitting\nhere yeah playing different roles than\nus can make and so it's more of a it's\nan Inception it's I want people to be\nignited that dreams can some parts of\nDreams can be made sense of yeah I want\nto dive back into nightmares because as\na child I grew up having a lot of\nnightmares I I don't I remember one of\nthem very vividly uh even till today I\ndon't dream about it anymore but I\nremember waking up in the middle of the\nnight feeling horrified and you talk\nabout in the book how children have the\nmost nightmares like it's common\nchildren have five times as many\nnightmares as adults you say even the\ngentless childhood is no protection\nagainst Nightmares and I think that's\nreally unnerving for parents when their\nkids are having nightmares I have\nfriends who have kids who will tell me\nlike oh God she just doesn't sleep she\nhas nightmares and it's like you're\ntrying to figure it out and I mean\nyou're you're a father so it's\ninteresting to hear how you may have\nfelt about that I'm sure a lot of us\nlistening right now are thinking God I\ndefinitely had nightmares as a kid when\nyou're having that as a kid it can be so\nunnerving it can be so difficult even\nmore than as an adult because you really\nfeel powerless what have been some have\nthere been any therapies or remedies\nthat have helped but then you go on to\nsay that nightmares are needed right so\nwalk me through that all right so so\nwhen I was thinking about this book I\nwas rolling around La going to different\nspots and sort of just bouncing around\npeople you know regular people at Dodger\nStadium and often I got the question\nlike all right you're going to talk\nabout dreams and dreaming uh you going\nhave a new take on it but clearly\nnightmares can't be good for you right\nthere's no use for nightmares and I\nthought I got to take this one head on\nin chapter two and so when I look at\nthat I would ask people to think of\nnightmares based on age and we do that\nin the hospital and in medicine and\nsurgery and science where they're sort\nof age related pediatric and adult is\nwhat I would say we've talked about\nadults flashbacks nightmares if they\narrive pay attention to them\nthey could be a warning flare for some\nmental health issues you get them more\nin depression you know we've left that\nhow to explain nightmares in kids is an\nexploration it's a conversation I think\nit's fresh and I looked at a bunch of\npieces that um uh that helped me sort of\ncome up with an idea uh a story if you\nwill so if you look at uh the first\nthing about nightmares that struck me\nis um you have to say hey Johnny that\nwas only a nightmare it's only with\nnightmares that we tell our kids that's\nonly a nightmare so as a conversation\ndoes that mean Johnny was blurring\ndreaming brain thoughts and waking brain\nthoughts until that moment so that's\nthat's a power I don't I'm not saying I\nhave the answer I'm just I'm leaving\nthat with your audience that's one\nnightmares do that by definition\nnightmares wake you up and they sear\nyour memory okay um just like our kids\nlearn to walk and talk our mind is being\ncultivated so they had these families\nthat signed all their kids up to be\nwoken up and talk about their dreams for\nlike 20 years in a row they're called\nlongitudinal kids when they start\ntalking their dreams are like a table uh\nyou know a sweater then they get more\nimaginative and what happens is\n567 nightmares arrive what else is\narriving they're developing visual\nspatial skills and they're also\ndeveloping this thing called theory of\nMind people can look up these terms\nthat children at some point develop the\nability to look at somebody and say that\nsmile I don't think they mean well mind\nreading reading the other person's\nintention right that arrives theory of\nmind at the same time as nightmares so\nmy biggest way to conceptualize that is\nnightmares arrive in children to help\nthem develop a sense of self versus\nother help them not a sense of identity\nbut that my thoughts and my experiences\nare mine\nmy Waking Life and and dream life are\nseparate and that I need to think of\nmyself as different from my uncles and\naunts and other people around me and I\nthink I think that's the function of\nnightmares in children you may have had\nthem a lot but they arrive and then very\nfew of them lead to nightmare disorder\nlike it doesn't ruin their the next day\nso it's almost sort of like whereas an\nadults nightmare disorder means the\nresidue is lingering with you so when\nyou look at the patterns children learn\nto work walk and talk nightmares arrive\naround 4 56 and most of them go away\nerotic dreams around like 11 12 13 and\npersist in some way adolescence arrives\naround 15 16 but these are cognitive\nchanges the the brain looks about the\nsame it's not like the a new lob pops up\nthese are cognitive changes that are\nhappening so I think nightmares\ncultivate the mind in children they\narrive and fade things that happen that\nuniversally in science aren't accidental\nand it's the it's the dream we've always\nthe all of us have had is a nightmare\nyeah that's super fascinating to me\nsuper fascinating it's exporation it's\nan exploration it's an exploration yeah\nand and it's it is such a it's so\ninteresting how we're so addicted\nto certainty and conclusiveness yeah\nit's kind of stifling yeah it's very\nthere a rigidity to it right do this\ndon't do this this will save you this\nwon't save like no but the dreaming\nprocess leaves it open like yeah we're\njust beginning to understand it's\npersonal keep digging keep exploring\nfail better I think that's what that all\nshows us why why I feel like what the\nconversation we're having exposes a\nweakness that we have across so many\nareas of our life which is that we're\nuncomfortable with uncertainty yeah and\nwe constantly feel discomfort when we\ncan't control and I think dreams are\nlike the ultimate version of that dreams\nare like hey just to remind you you need\nuncertainty yeah let me dig into that a\nlittle bit some ideas about that like\nwhen we fall asleep in dream the\nexecutive networks dampen let me reverse\na bit most of the day is something we\ncall task on it's outward and the Brain\nthe executive Network reason logic is\npaying attention of course food scarcity\nright woolly mammoths it makes sense\nthose who are best at paying attention\noutward navigating the world and using\nas little amount of calories and brain\nenergy that seems like that would be a\nnatural adaptation well I would tell\npeople is when we're not task on the\nbrain doesn't rev down like your like\nyour computer like goes and then you\nhave to hit the keyboard to pop it up no\nit creates a mental life of its own\nright that's the imagination Network so\nduring the day we're mostly executive\nNetwork outward but if there's nothing\nto do like with mind wandering or things\nare safe we turn back into our own head\ndreaming is the example of that but just\nsuffused with like uncertainty\nand so the question becomes the day is\nso focused on thinking calculating\nadrenaline is up adrenaline finds the\nsignal in the noise um they they've done\nstudies where they changed that and then\nthe dreaming brain is kind of the\nopposite adrenaline comes down you're\nlooking for looser patterns Divergent\nthinking designing a car not fixing an\nengine it to me to me the uncertainty\nthat the dreaming brain goes through\nthat's our genius built in we don't we\nactually don't want to become too rigid\nin our habits it might be okay today uh\ngoing on the freeway going on the tube\nas we mentioned but that's not the\nthat's not the process your brain needs\nto be in to be the most adaptive for\nheartache for falling in love for a kid\ngetting sick for the uncertainty the\nenvironment will give us and the\nuncertainty we almost want to engage in\nlove affairs and Adventures I think\nthat's the balance\nget things done try not to be too rigid\ntry to be open-minded and appreciate\nthat your dreaming brain is going to\ntake you there whether you want it or\nnot that's the that's the love story of\nuncertainty and creativity yeah and it's\nI'm going to flipflop because we talked\nabout uncertainty and uh creativity but\nI want to go into lucid dreaming and\nthis idea of wanting some control in the\nuncertainty um but I before we get there\nI wanted to go back to sleep exit cuz I\ndon't think we we talked about sleep\nentry but we didn't didn't finish sleep\nexit and that works because sleep exit\nuh that dampened executive Network that\ndampened adrenaline that looks for the\nsignal and noise it seems to come back\non and if an alarm goes off we know it\ncomes back on like you could be dreaming\nand sleeping you smell smoke the\nexecutive network is the boss it it will\npop back on and dominate and so if you\ndo grab your phone in the morning and\ncheck emails too quickly or jump on\nInstagram like your brain will go to\nthat forward task on feature and the the\nresidue or the lingering feelings of\nyour dream life will necessarily be put\nin the back seat and so if you do want\nto remember your dreams more as you wake\nup if you have the luxury of a bed and\ntime and not an alarm that's a critical\nwindow sleep exit to sort of hold on to\nyour dream thoughts and your dream\nexperiences um it's an imperfect process\nbut I can tell you people who have tried\nthey get better at it and again it's\nfree it's accessible it's from your own\nbrain I think it's one of those habits\nthat I've Incorporated my life for the\nlast 5 10 5 10 years I get out what\nexactly yeah what so what I do is if I\nhave the luxury because I I do now it I\ndidn't for a long time I mean the phone\ncalls and Pages were going off in the\nmiddle of the night and now it's more\nlike if I wake up in the morning I try\nto linger and I try not to move and\nthere's different types of Yoga there\npeople have been talking about a lot of\nstuff like this for centuries and\nMillennia and I'm just adding some\nscientific pieces that support it but\nthat I'm I'm trying to not have my\nexecutive Network kick in I'll keep my\neyes closed I'll run through some\nthoughts oh that's interesting hold on\nthat what should I do that like I I I\nhave my sleep exit uh thinking or\nmoments if you will and then I'll I'll\nreach over I'll go to my notes app it's\nright on the home screen and I'll write\na few things down when I have ideas I\nmean i' say great majority have come\nfrom them they're almost all bad ideas\nbut that is the idea generator if I've\nhad a good idea it's been during the\ntime it's rarely it's rarely like at\n2:00 on a Triple Espresso right that's\nimportant because we have to get things\ndone but the dreaming process sleep\nentries we talked about and sleep exit I\nthink are interesting portals where\nthere are sort of blurry Lial states\nthat we have a different type of\nthinking without it being just like\nwildly psychedelic you know it's\nmeasured but it's a it's a fresh\nperspective it's a different take on the\nthings that are important in your life\nat that moment yeah I mean even the\nlanguage of sleep entry and sleep exit\nis so powerful well I got to you know\nbut this called hypnogogic and\nhypnopompic so the first thing I'm out\nthere is like stop using these words\nthat suck right like words are terrible\nyeah I'm so glad you didn't I but even\nhearing you say I've I've I've never\nheard the word sleep entry and sleep\nexit before yeah and I personally really\nlike that language because I think we\ndon't think about it like that and it's\nso funny how we we enter buildings we\nleave buildings we enter spaces we leave\nspaces and sleep is kind of like that\nand we are talking about evening\nroutines and morning routines but this\nis almost a bit more\nintimate to both sides of that it's the\nessential routine now just sleep entry\nand sleep\nexit what I love about it is that I can\nput stickers on your scalp our scalps\nand record the electricity and be like\nlook the waves change you're you are\nmeasurably not just by report like hey\nI'm feeling different I get that I trust\nthat that's individual but the brain\nwaves during sleep entry and sleep\nexit have uh a pattern they overlap in a\nway that never happens while you're\nawake or while you're\ndreaming right so like that's that's\nwhat I want people to walk away with\nlike it's not just his thing he's\nlooking at the fact that he can measure\nthat this is a different space right now\nyeah yeah no that doesn't mean it's\npowerful or not that's for you to figure\nout but we can measure sleep entry and\nsleep exit and it looks different on a\n24-hour cycle of brain waves and how\nlong does it\nwell it's different for different people\nand people seem to cultivate it but\nSalvador Dolly he's written about it\nsaid you know anywhere from 2 to 12\nminutes that's how long you have yeah\nbut it's it's personal but it's real\nit's for everybody to figure out for\nthemselves you know but I like the two\nto 12 minutes it gives us a gaug sure as\nto how long do you not let your\nexecutive brain turn on in the morning\nand because there's science there's tech\ncompanies coming up with a little uh you\nknow your iPhone or Apple watch is\ntracking your stages of sleep and when\npeople people are in that sleep entry\nit'll Buzz them to wake up like Dolly\ntried and they'll and that that's their\nway of uh write down what you're\nthinking now as sort of the tech\napproach to creativity it's interesting\nright how does I mean talking about the\ntech approach again another tangent\nbecause there's so fascinating I'm like\ncompletely obliterated any form of uh\nstructure but it's it's great where do\nyou see the cross-section of AI and\ndreams like where can it be useful where\nwill it be helpful with this where will\nit not will it help us ask better\nquestions is it going to help us take\nbetter notes is it going to help us I\ndon't know I I'm not a computer\nscientist but I'll tell you two things\nthey're making programs that add noise\nbecause sometimes the patterns and\nalgorithms of computers become so rigid\nlike our daily thinking that they can't\nhandle the insertion of new data and\nthat sort of mirrors what's going on\nlike that's it's called overfitted the\nthe computer process and algorithm\ndesign is too tight too efficient and\nthat learning from dreaming they they\nfind that the computer system is more\nadaptive when they add in noise where\nartificial intelligence fits in I'm not\nsure but Tech is all over it they're\ntracking the data from smartphones and\ncertain people you're volunteering uh\nthey'll play certain songs and you'll\nhave people watch commercials and see if\nthey dream about it more and then buy\nthat product more like that space is\nhere so somebody's listening like that's\na massive space and I just think I would\nremind people that we're not completely\nshut off when we drink dream we wake up\nto alarms and smoke and that we should\nbe careful about in that vulnerable\nprecious uh remarkable and unique state\nthat somebody's not just taking\nmarketing advantage of it and I think\nthat's where AI will extract data figure\nout what's the right Buzz the right\nsound and just Riff on this a little bit\nlike a hundred years ago they were like\npeople were sleeping they put their hand\nin like a bucket of water see if they\nhad more dreams about water in the\nmodern version they're going to be\ntaking your data and trying to find tune\nlike the song the scent and the picture\nto put you know to throw at you to try\nto get you to buy stuff so I'm a bit\nlike dystopian about that because I\ndon't want you know I'm I'm private\nespecially in my dream life yeah yeah\nyeah absolutely no it's I mean I feel\nlike some of my favorite movies have\nbeen about dreams you mentioned\nInception even I mean this isn't about\ndreams but still in that in that space\nof um Vanilla Sky yeah with um Tom Cruz\nand Cameron deers that movie if you've\nnot seen it it's probably one of my\nfavorites and just how that memory bank\nor some sort of like subconscious bank\nis created and held and it's fascinating\nthinking about that there's a few more\nthings r that I want to go over with you\nfrom the book which I think are so\ninteresting for people I want to talk to\nyou about before we get into lucid\ndreaming I want to talk to you a bit\nabout how dreams can predict the future\nand I think a lot of people worry that\ntheir dreams their thoughts can create\nreality subconsciously somewhere we feel\nthat like I know people who have\nillnesses or like go I manifested this\nlike I made this happen or like I have a\ndisease and oh my God I saw this coming\nor or you know that kind of feeling\nwarning Dreams yeah warning dreams and\nthat almost feels a bit worrying as well\nbecause often when you have that warning\nyou now constantly replaying it and\nthinking about it while you're awake and\nwhile you're asleep can dreams predict\nthe future especially when it comes to\nHealth in one specific way dreams can\nabsolutely predict the future of your\nhealth we'll get into that that's\nParkinson's but in general for cancer\nfor other diseases it's hard to tease\nout whether my patients had the\ndiagnosis and then sort of reverse\nthought like I think I had a dream about\nthat I'm not judging them I'm just\ntotally open-minded but I can't I can't\ngrip the data on that um but if you do\nhave a dream about disease statistically\nyou're not more likely to have that\ndisease they've been looking at these\nsurveys so it might just reveal a\ncertain anxiety you're having again\nsymbolic you might be struggling with\nsomething and then have a disease based\ndream so as long as we remember that\nmost of the time they're symbolic and\nnot literal I think that's important um\nthere\nare plenty of reports and surveys where\nbreast cancer patients have said like I\nhad a dream and I felt the lump in these\nsort of things I respect that I respect\ntheir whole journey so I want to put\nthat out there the one specific way that\ndreams can can predict the future I need\nto unpack this one for a little bit\nbecause this was mind-blowing when I\nwhen I learned about it there's\nsomething called REM behavior disorder\nwhich I'm relabeling dream and acma\nBehavior Uh yeah my world thank you\nthank you so much my world the words are\nare they confuse you know um dream and\nacma\nBehavior Uh middle-aged men 50s acting\nout their dream usually protecting their\nbed\npartner um they come in the bed partner\nmaybe has an\ninjury those men 94% of the time and\nthat's essentially in medicine it's\nUniversal 15 years later will develop\nParkinson's I think you know so that is\nthe one example and it's if it's the\nonly example for every neuroscientist\nout there every scientist out there hear\nme with this that the first warning\nflare of the brain's deterioration with\nParkinson's is a change in dreams 15\nyears ago I'll just leave it at that for\nfor all the rigorous people out there\nsaying hey they're talking about stuff\nlike I'm questioning whether what you\nknow the science can really show this\nlook up REM behavior disorder Cap all\ncaps RM behavior disorder which I call\nDream an Acy Behavior it's in Scientific\nAmerican this isn't like one paper I'm\ndigging up like this is thing this is\nstuff that's coming out REM behavior\ndisorder predicts Parkinson's 15 years\nlater and what I would say to the\nresearchers out there is that an\nopportunity for us to start with\nmedicine earlier I mean it just says so\nmuch but outside of that one and and all\nyou need is one unicorn for unicorns to\nbe real I haven't found any evidence\nthat dreams predict the future I mean\nthey definitely don't give you lottery\nnumbers and stuff like that but at a\nmore grounded level they don't they\ndon't necess predict what's going to\nhappen to you um but what happens to you\nmaybe because of what the dream is\nsymbolically mentioning you're going\nthrough a difficult time and you lose\nyour job and you have a dream about\nlosing your job so I can see where those\nconnections would form I just I just\ndon't have any so I'll leave it as a\nmaybe it's so interesting how again it\ngoes back to this idea of when you get a\ndiagnosis or something happens you then\ngo back to finding that point like it's\nalmost like you've been dating someone\nand you knew they were wrong and then\nwhen they break up with you you're like\nI knew it you go I knew you replay it\nall yeah yeah you rep playing like and\nthen you now you see all the red flags\nand and again there's nothing wrong with\nit but it's that feeling of I remember\nand I know and but we're not always good\nat trusting our gut in that\nmoment you know what I'm saying like\nthere's there's not a feeling of it's\nalmost like again and I'm not\ndiscounting anyone's experience but I\nfind even I do it where you're living\nyour life and then something happens and\nyou go I knew it I knew it there was a\npart of you that sensed it I would call\nthat hunch and Instinct yeah and I think\nwe we connect if I may yeah please in\nthe moment as we navigate uncertainty\nand because we're not just reflexive\ncreatures right there's this thing\ncalled counterfactual thinking like I\ncan run out if this happens than that I\ncan play scenarios out and you know what\ndoes that the imagination Network the\nsame thing that's liberated dreaming we\ncreate a mental workspace what if this\nhappens what if this happens what if\nthis doesn't happen as we navigate the\nuncertainty so it's not just you know\npull back from a hot frying pan or you\nknow pull back from a scorching Rock if\nyou're a lizard right that's those are\nreflexes we have the ability to choose\nand I think when you look at what you're\nsaying about hunch and Instinct and how\nwe kind of knew something and we should\nhave maybe paid more attention to it I I\nthink that for me that's in the rear\nview when you're in the moment and\nthings are imperfect as they often are I\nbelieve that that you are trying to\ncreate the outcome out of that imperfect\nsituation and when it doesn't arise or\nit doesn't arrive for you we do look\nback and say hey um you know maybe we\nshould have done things differently that\nis the\ncost of the freedom of choice that we\nhave right now what to do whether to\ngrab this glass or not and just like\nheartache is the cost of exposing\nyourself to falling in love you know and\nI'm familiar with that so I I think I\nthink people should look at that as like\nthat's that's what makes life exciting\nyou know yeah yeah have you seen any\nconnection between alcohol and dreams\nwell this a big question so this is a\nnotable thing that I left out of the\nbook I I have patients waking up from\nanesthesia I'm floating above\ndisassociative States like psychodel\nexperiences ambient dreams fentel dreams\nalcohol suppresses dreams people smoke\nweed marijuana users in the morning they\ndon't remember their dreams I couldn't\nfind an it definitely affects dreaming\nto me that says two things dreams are\ncoming from the brain you take drugs and\nyour dreams change they're\nbiological and the second thing is I\ncouldn't find a way to say\nanti-depressants make this change to\nyour dreams you know Coke and meth makes\nthis change and alcohol as well and\nalcohol I just couldn't find something\nto wrap it around yeah and I tried cuz I\nwas like that's going to be one of the\nchapters and I just uh I um I didn't\nfind a clear link except for one\ngalantamine is this drug we give\npatients with dementia it works on\nacetylcholine it's one of the less\nfamous neurotransmitters we have a lot\nthey do a lot it's not dopamine does\nthis it's not that linear as we're\nseeing now and liberating people now um\nis uh galantamine and so those people\nthat take it and they're like oh my gosh\nI'm I'm becoming aware I'm Dreaming\nwhile I'm Dreaming that's lucid dreaming\nyou double that\ndose they have more lucid dreaming and\nin the world of science that dose\ndependent escalation is as close you get\nto you know cause and effect so uh drugs\ndefinitely affect the brain uh I just\ncouldn't put them into NE categories\nbecause people are anti-depressants had\nthis type of dream people are on did\nCoke the next day they had a different\ntype of dream so that is a mixed bag uh\nin alcohol part of that it's you know\nit's a chemical do you think we'll ever\nget closer to understanding the links\nmore deeply as the memory banks grow uh\ndream Banks gr I hope so I hope so and I\nthink that's an interesting question\nyeah the the things that I'm looking at\nare what were available to me everywhere\nfrom Aristotle few th000 years ago to\nstuff happening now to questionnaires\nfrom 20 years ago it's of course\nnecessarily it's imperfect but I think\nas people are more honest and liberated\nto to to fill the dream Bank in with\nthis stuff somebody after me is going to\ntake that and say ooh I think alcohol\ndoes this and anti-depressants do this I\nthink it's I think it's quite possible\nbut just as like just to let everybody\nknow I'm working with what's out there\nand trying to connect the dots between\nthe gaps of like from you know\nphilosophy to brain science to YouTube\nyou know ambient dreams like I'm really\ntrying to bring it together from every\ncorner that I could you know look at\nyeah how much do we dream in\nevents in reality versus\ncompletely fantasy based events like how\nmuch of our dreams are replaying like\nyou were saying that the Veterans for\nexample their dream about the war that's\nlike a real event that happened in their\nlife they that's a flashback yeah it's a\nflashback yeah so but when they dream\nabout it when they're getting divorced\nthat's a symbolic dream yeah\nrepresenting something what's kind of\nbreakdown of dreams of flashbacks versus\nfantasy uh I think PTS SD flashbacks are\nclearly replay of of a bad experience in\nyour\nDreamscape the imaginative component of\ndreams when you look at these\nsurveys um it's a complete mixed bag but\nwhat I will tell you is that I'm trying\nto just add the information here to your\nquestion which is a good one but how\nmuch of our dream life is a replay\nversus just completely cooked up by the\nimagination Network I get that that's a\ngood question what I would say is um in\nflashbacks it's a\nreplay um if your if your dream is\nfalling that's not a replay but\nindicative something and then there's\nmost stuff is in between it's highly\nvisual highly creative jumping from\nsocial situations to visual situations\nuh you know you're on the top of a\nbuilding you're in an awkward situation\nyou're finding with something there are\nthese jumps a little bit movie like but\nit's not a hallucination\nand this this is the best I I because I\nwanted to be able to answer this\nquestion like two years ago and I was\nthinking of this and this is the gem\nthat I found when you hallucinate just\nbear with me it's a purple elephant in\nthis room the the the\nlandscape is reality the element is\ninserted in it in dreaming the whole\nthing is imagined and so I would say the\nentire process of dreaming leans heavily\nimaginative got it that's the best\nanswer I can get yeah no that's a good\nanswer yeah no it's it's interesting to\nme because I yeah I always wonder like\nI'm like are we always do we have a\ndream in a space we've been in and seen\nin and even I think all of it I think\nall of it I mean that's so you have\nmemory yeah of places you've been and\nthen you can imagine and dreaming has\naccess to both of that and if I may the\ndreaming memory like you go up you get\nup to go to the bathroom and sometimes\nyou can slip back into a dream so it's\nnot random and so I I always wonder is\nthere like access to memory our dreaming\nmind can have that our waking mind does\nnot have access to like people with uh\nthis is fascinating like this little bit\nheavier on the size part like people who\nhave memory issues like they've had a\ntrauma and they can't remember uh if\nthey played Tetris or a video game\nthey'll see pictures of it in their\ndreams but can't tell you about it when\nyou ask them during the day I say no I\nnever played a Tetris game but I had one\nin my dream and they they're basically\nplaying their Tetris is being played in\nfront of them so there's something going\non where the dreaming mind has a memory\nsystem I think I don't have evidence for\nthis but there are little dots like that\nlike slipping back into a dream getting\nup to go to the bathroom people with\namnesia being able to feed their dreams\nI can't identify it like on a map or a\nyou know a dissection but uh there's\nsomething unique going on with the\ndreaming memory and dreaming mind and\nthat's why it's so inspiring for me like\nyou know I you know I use drills and\ntake off pieces of skull and I dissect\nwith I'm like I'm not that guy right\nmost people would think I think that's\nwhy it's powerful like brain surgeons\ntalking about the dreaming mind and but\nthat's what it's done for me my man is\nlike 51 years in 10,000 patients\noperating like 10\ncountries um\nSons you know Wild Affair heartbreak all\nof it intense emotion relationship with\nmy partner for 30 years like all of it\num and he start to think like I think\nI'm getting a sense and then you then\nputting this book together it's it's\nalmost like a rebirth it's that's too\nmuch of a statement but like oh wait a\nsecond there's a a dreaming mind memory\nsystem wait a second Parkinson's the\nfirst flare is uh a change in dreaming\npattern so just when I thought like you\nknow I think I think I'm figuring this\nout you know um I'm excited to have uh\nhave the lens with which I approach the\nworld reset and that's what dreaming has\ndone for me let's talk about lucid\ndreaming we've been talking we've been\nkind of like peppering it in the whole\ntime first of all let's just Define and\na lot of the questions I ask are very um\nsimplified and the reason for that is\nbecause I think a lot of these terms\nideas are out there and most people\ndon't even know and I think as you're\nsimplifying language from a very uh\nscientific point of view my goal is to\ntry and simplify topics that we all hear\nabout and you might even hear about in a\nconversation and you're sitting there\ngoing I don't even know what that means\nI don't know if anyone knows what that\nmeans but we're all pretending to know\nso it's like what is lucid dreaming how\ncommon is it and then how do we do it so\nlet's go through those three phases\nlucid dreaming here's the way I explain\nit to you first a little bit of a a\nstory about it when I was constructing\nthis book I locid Dreaming oh no I don't\nwant to cover this there can't be any\nscience for it two out of nine chapters\nare lucid and so again that's it's\nrefreshing for me and the most rigorous\nscience on dreaming is about lucid\ndreaming so we talked earli about the\nwaking brain and the dreaming brain now\nwe know that there's a sleep entry and\nthere's a sleep exit in the middle of\ndreaming in the middle of the\nnight some people become aware hey I'm\nactually dreaming and they become aware\nof the dream and somebody might say well\nwhy is that unusual well most dreams are\nin the rear view you wake up and you say\noh oh that was a dream mhm because but\nlike I had a visual I had a vibrant one\nlast night but and I was and only when I\nwoke up I was like wait okay that was\nonly a dream but when the dream was\nhappening I was fully inhabiting the\ndream I was the dream was happening in\nmy mind right at the at the neuronal\nelectrochemical level so sleep entry\nsleep exit lucid dreaming is the return\nof awareness allowing people to know\nthat they are actually in a dream while\ndreaming okay not in the rear view like\nI had this morning and so that's a big\nstatement and what I would say is\nthere's proof for it um lucid dreaming\ncan be proven by this experiment that\nthey did and have been doing that's the\nthing about studies and experiments for\nyour listeners if you if somebody breaks\ninto something new and it's real you'll\nsee an explosion of data in the\nscientific literature for that and in\nthe 70s somebody said wait a second you\nyou're a lucid Dreamer\nyou're telling me you you can become\naware um while you're in a dream while\nthe dream is happening and so they did a\ncouple of things they trained the person\nthat rapid eye movement which is like\nskittish eye movements when we sleep and\ndream they said if you're an elusive\ndream and Consciousness has returned can\nyou con can you communicate with me like\nwith your eyeballs through like a morse\ncode and people should look this up they\nleft right left right they train these\nlike eye pattern mov movements at the\nsame time they put the electrodes on the\nsurface scalp cuz a guy like me will be\nlike he's just woke up right well I need\nto know more than that and they prove by\nthe electricity that the person is truly\nasleep so you can't fake being asleep no\nacross a glass this person at a certain\ntime in the middle of the night proving\ntheir asleep starts to communicate with\ntheir eyeballs and it still shows you're\nasleep communicating with the outside\nworld when you're asleep that's powerful\nthat's lucid dreaming am I a lucid\ndreamer no have I had one or two yes did\npeople working on this book start to yes\ncan it be induced yes and so lucid\ndreaming is powerful because again it's\na Lial state right it's a bit of\nawareness it's a a bit of waking\nconsciousness that has bubbled up during\ndreaming Consciousness and so nothing is\nrigid sleep entry you don't go from Wake\nto sleep in a second it's not a hard\nline so they're all these overlapping\nblurry States and Lum lucid dreaming is\nthat two more points about that when you\nput those patients or not patients\nparticipants into brain scanners that\nexecutive Network I've been talking\nabout logic and stuff is dampened the\nthey show more blood flow of that area\nnot as much as when you're awake but the\nblood flow to the frontal cortex that\ndoes reason and logic and awareness is\nhalfway wow so this you know exactly\nright and so for everybody who's been a\nlucid dreamer and telling people to work\npeople are shaking you off like you're\nout of your head tell them no there's uh\nthere's the left right eye movement\nproof there's brain scam proof\ngalantamine that drug that makes lucid\ndreamers have more or have people start\nto lucid dream there's a lot of\nscientific evidence for that and the\nlast thing is so can we learn the lucid\ndream and the the lucid dream I had was\na Trippy one I was in the pandemic and I\nwas teaching the boys to S we got this\nboat I just like we had I had to get\nthem Outdoors do you can't have three\ndogs and puppies in the house and in a\npandemic I thought this is a luxury I\nhave we're by the water here in\nCalifornia it was like I'm turning the\nhelm hard but I'm going horizontal on\nlike on a giant like River pouring off\ninto waterfall and it was just like I'm\ntrying so hard just to stand still and\nyou know I just remember the whole thing\nlike this my right arm and this was\nduring the construction of this book and\nI thought to myself that's interesting\nit's very visual I know know I'm in a\ndream I mean those are unique\nexperiences for me again as a brain\nsurgeon they usually would not even\nExplore these areas but when I see the\nbrain scan showing you're halfway\nbetween sleep and wake when I see that\ndrugs bring in looser dreaming I love\npulling those two worlds together for\npeople you know so I'm fascinating now\nwith fascinated now with lucid dreaming\nand I think people who about a third of\npeople do it like when you 30 to 40%\nreport it uh sometimes more sometimes\nless athletes and have it more Gamers\ntend to have it more visual spatial\ncreative people tend to have more lucid\ndreams and there are some techniques\nthat are out there I was going to ask\nyou if someone's a beginner yeah and\nthey want to try it after watching this\nthey're going to get the book and\nthey're like all right I want to play\nwith it what are the first three things\nsomeone should do first thing they\nshould do is look up m l d lucid\ndreaming mild techniques so there are a\nlot of techniques written about since\nAntiquity uh people cultivated\nspirituality with that this a massive\ntopic Faith use it a lot yeah so mild\ntechnique and what it is is waking up a\nbit earlier than you should you plan to\nor should and then trying to hold on to\nConsciousness and wake Waking Life as\nyou drift into sort of back into sleep\nthe technique is described in the book\nand you can look it up online but I want\npeople to know why I I mention that\ntechnique after four or five is because\nthere is a study when they took a bunch\nof people and I said okay we're going to\nteach you the left right left right mors\ncode you practice this technique then\nwe're going to get you in the sleep lab\nit's not my experiment or it's not my\ninvestigation we're going to get you in\nthe sleep lab okay now prove to us with\nyour eyeball movements that you're\nactually loose to Dreaming everything\nbefore that was a survey like yeah I did\nit and I'm loose to Dreaming more I\nbelieve people but you know I like that\nextra bit of proof so the mild technique\nis proven with the left right left right\nMorse code technique that clearly shows\nyou are asleep based on your BL brain\nelectricity and you are using eye\npatterns so much so this this is a\nbanger they started doing a little bit\nof math two plus two and they have code\nand somebody says to me I think I was in\nParis and I said wait a second you said\nthe dreaming brain doesn't do math I\nsaid yeah but I also showed you the\nbrain scans that show a bit of awareness\nand has come back as does the bit of\nability to do math so I love seeing\nthose pieces come in consistently that's\nbrilliant R from all your research\nyou've done you know tons of research\ntons of reading looking at\nstudies I feel one of the biggest things\nthat I'm taking away from this is is\noften the questions we're asking about\nour dreams are the wrong questions we're\nasking like what does this mean is this\nyou know is this real like you know what\nshould I do with this what would you say\nare the best questions we should ask\nwhen we've woken up after dreaming what\nshould we be looking for point us in the\nright direction because I feel maybe\nwe're wasting time and energy and effort\nin a different direction so I would say\nwhen I I'll tell you my approach again\nthat's that's a massive topic you've\nyou've just um asked of me is one there\nare dreams that clearly reflect your\nwaking anxiety showing up late alarm\ngoing alarm doesn't go off um showing up\nnaked at a Podium because you're worried\nabout public speaking so some don't\nrequire uh you to spend too much time on\nthem number two there are Universal\ndreams nightmares and erotic dreams\nwe've talked about that a little bit\nnumber three there dreams are just St\nyou know let's not hold dreaming thought\nand emotions to what we wouldn't waking\nthought there's a lot of stuff we do dur\nthe day we don't even hold on to right\nsimilarly um fourth are genre dreams\npregnancy dreams massive lifetime events\nare happening massive lifetime events\nare happening and you're dreaming that's\nconsistent the ones that I I would say\nto people are to focus on are the ones\nthat are hyper hyper emotional that you\nand they linger into the next day you\ncan try to cultivate it with the morning\nmorning Technique we talked about a\nslower rise not not switching to email\nand Instagram too quickly but the hyper\nemotional dream is one to reflect upon\nhere's why the emotional systems of your\nbrain called lyic structures and the\nbrain has The Reptilian Brain inside our\nthroat sort of back there that's\nInstinct makes you take a breath when\nyou're underw above it develop the\nemotional brain much like what my dog\nhas you know they have intuition\nuh they have Instinct um that's called\nthe the lyic system and people can look\nthis up and there's there's circuits in\nthere like the Pepe circuit and it's a\nfascinating it's a fascinating part of\nthe the brain and then on top of it is a\ngiant frontal cortex the frontal cortex\nhas um is integrated with all those\nthey're all they're all intertwined\nthere is no dopamine there's a reward\npathway that that jumps from The\nReptilian to the emotional to but to get\nthings done our advantage and the thing\nthat block our foreheads forward was\nlogic and reason the executive and the\nCEO so I believe that lyic system those\nemotional systems are uh dampened during\nthe day for productivity a conventional\nproductivity not creativity and what's\nhappening with your dreams is the roles\nare reversed and the emotional systems\ncan achieve a top speed that you're\nwaking life can't so if you have\nemotions thoughts and experiences from a\nhyper emotional hyper liberated\nbrain that's the one to reflect on on\nwithin your life and I've given a few\nspecific examples and the process of\nreflecting what it means it's individual\nto you if you are having nightmares and\nyou you don't have them and you think\nyour day wait my day is fine I'm having\na lot nightmares when I don't let that\nbe a a warning sign to reflect more upon\nyourself if you're struggling with a\nrelationship and you have dreams of\nfalling or hyper emotional dreams of\nbeing chased uh you know that's your\nrelationship symbolically finding itself\ninto your dreams if you are at the end\nof\nlife and you're having a lot of dreams\nabout\nreconciliation those are that's the\ndreaming process coming to your rescue\nthe end of life dreams serve a different\nfunction uh I think they they bring a\nSolace and there's evidence coming out\nnow that even when our heart is stopped\nthe last thing a brain does is have one\nlast one massive dream in the last\nminute or two potentially experiencing\nuh the universal feature of near\nnear-death experiences so know that a\nhyper emotional dream comes from a hyper\nemotional state that's individual to\nyour brain and that no one can give you\nno one has access to and maybe it's your\nresponsibility to turn over that feeling\nand those thoughts and just to pause for\na minute and take all the information\ncoming at you you take all the stuff\nyou've gone through and actually step\naside for a little bit and say hey what\nwas that solar flare from my mind and if\nit's useful to you great if the process\nhelps you remember those more great but\nif you just have that 5 10 minutes\nduring your morning where you just\nremember that you were not resting the\nnight before that there was something\nwild and vibrant going on and you got a\nglimpse of it what it means is up to you\nbut definitely don't neglect it well\nsaid Dr R johnel the book is called this\nis why you dream if you don't have your\ncopy already make sure you grab it we\ndove into some of the themes some of the\ntopics there's so much more inside this\nbook that I believe you're going to love\nand appreciate so that you can dream\nbetter uh dream bigger and dream more\nbeautifully as well which is what I wish\nfor each and every one of you R is there\nanything that I haven't asked you that\nyou want to share that is on your heart\nand mind intuitively that you believe is\nimportant for our community I think\nthere's too much judgment going on in\nthe ways that people approach life and\nsome people think they've got it all\nfigured out and some people on the other\nend saying I've got nothing figured out\nand I got to tell your listeners I've\nbeen in that entire range and I would\nsay a couple of things I would say um I\nI think the dreaming brain and mind is a\ngenius built in that gives us resilience\nand and resilience I want to leave\npeople with a brand new definition of it\na psychological definition that there's\nsystemic resilience and processive\nresilience systemic resilience is uh is\nis what you bring to the fight and\nprocessive resilience is is what the\nfight brings out in you so wherever\nyou're at you're equipped with your\ndreaming brain as your Ally and I think\nto me that gives me a source of strength\nthat there's this process cultivating me\nprotecting me preparing me for the next\nday that's on one side that's like\nthat's Rahul speaking emotionally right\non the other side when you sit here and\nyou say this brain surch is trying to\nrock this stuff about the brain and mind\nand all that I'll leave you with\nsomething I did not know in Neuroscience\nright I got a lab got a PhD in\nNeuroscience I'm a brain surgeon you\nstart to think you're like the expert at\nit but there are things in exploring\ndreams and dreaming that I was surprised\nlike how did I not know that because it\nwould have changed all the ways I would\nhave acted um through my life I would\nhave been more open more exploratory\nmore willing to accept other people's uh\nexperiences because it doesn't all have\nto make sense even to the Uber expert so\nI leave people with something to search\nonline called paradoxical Kinesis p a r\na d Ox i c a l Kinesis it's called we\ncan't explain why you move that way\nthat's my that's my street translation\nfor that medical term but what it is is\nthose same patients PA s that have dream\nand acma behavior they car act out their\ndreams and later on their Parkinson's\ndevelops and their brains wither the\nstrangest thing is when the Parkinson\nsets in and their voices are stifled and\ntheir movements are\nrigid when they act out their dreams\ntheir voices are big and their movements\nare fluid the dreaming\nmind somehow can access the\nbody in a better way in a more fluid way\nin a more in tune way than the waking\nmind can and that that's what I like to\nleave people with like I'm excited about\nthis I hope you guys are too so rul you\ntalk about how naps lasting 60 to 90\nminutes can boost learning and creative\nproblem solving by\n40% uh why is this and when's the best\ntime to take a nap the the napping thing\nis Big these days and people are finding\nit's not work harder work longer and all\nthat but try to work with the different\nstates of mind and brain that you have\nand napping if you get to 60 or 90\nminutes people have done surveys and\nasked people to nap with puzzles and\nthey find entering the dream state or\nthe sleeping state which again as we've\ntalked about is imaginative is Divergent\nthinking that they solve problems better\nthey have more solutions to riddles and\nthe big point there for people is\nthere's a utility to napping you're not\nlazy because you nap and if you can do\nit in a way that doesn't disrupt your\nsleep later on in the day I think that's\nanother you know this in the world hacks\nI think that's the hack that we've got\nall got built in can you dream in that\n60 to 90 minutes yeah have and have\nthose dreams shown to be any different I\nI can't answer that there isn't date on\nhave those shown dreams shown to be any\ndifferent but I would say one condition\nis narcolepsy where people fall asleep\nsuddenly and there's information coming\nout from them they suddenly fall asleep\nand then they wake up and they enter a\ndream state but that's a whole space\nthat's opening up the utility of naps\nand it doesn't have to be every day it\ndoesn't have to be rigid uh and if you\nhave a big event or a big project coming\nup I think personally what I've tried is\njust shutting your eyes in a quiet space\nand allowing that mental Works Space uh\nallowing yourself not to be task on and\ndrift inwards in your thoughts whether\nyou actually fall technically as sleep\nor not to me that's been advantageous\nyes absolutely I agree with that and I\nknow many athletes who do that as well\nbefore a big game or before a big\nperformance you're not necessarily\nfalling asleep but I like you're in off\nmode uh definitely and also last\nquestion I wanted to ask you\nwas the the question that Helena\nmentioned so a lot of people when\nthey're in sleep entry they feel like\nthey're falling why does that exist why\ndoes why do people have that experience\nI I I don't know if I have an answer for\nthat and I've seen the reports but I\ncouldn't tie any signs to that but sleep\nentry falling asleep is a time where\nactivation of the movement centers is\npronounced and falling is actually a\nmovement it's not uh you think oh\nrunning is a movement falling something\nthat happens to you no but the\nactivation of the brain when people fall\nuh is has to do with the motor strip as\nwell motor sensory so during that\ntransition there may be a link there\nyeah it's even interesting language like\nfalling asleep like I guess you're\nfalling onto your bed but the idea of\nfalling is is just I don't know entering\nyeah I find language really fascinating\nand when I look at like falling to sleep\nI'm like that doesn't make any sense to\nme like Beyond falling onto a bed which\ndoesn't necessarily create a restful\npeaceful feeling take that back 2,000\nyears and we memorize it by heart and\nthat's when we thought the heart was a\ncenter so absolutely language shapes uh\nthe direction of our mind I mean The\nPower of Words and people are finding\nhandwriting is it activates more part of\nthe brains than typing and so definitely\nthe uh communication and storytelling\nand building meaning there's something\nthere yeah I'll explore that hopefully\nin the years ahead I think sleep entry\nand exit is brilliant language though\nthat that has really stayed with me and\nit's making me think even more\nintentionally and insightfully around\nthose intimate moments just before\nwaking up especially those 2 to 12\nminutes that you said before you go to\nbed and after you wake up because\nevening and morning routines make sense\nbut there's a even more special time\nthere that could be managed yeah that\nthat morning time for me sleep exit is\ndefinitely something I put to use a lot\nof the ideas in this book i' I'd read\nsomething I'd be flipping through a\nbunch of papers I'm like what does this\nmean what does this mean and then it\nwould be in the morning I oh maybe that\nmaybe that not a guarantee but\ndefinitely a space to explore yeah\namazing R so we end every episode of on\npurpose with a Fast Five final five uh\nthese are questions that have to be\nanswered in one word to one sentence\nmaximum and these are your final FES so\nthe first question is what is the best\ndreaming advice you've ever heard or\nreceived try to remember them more okay\nsecond question what is the worst\ndreaming advice you've ever heard or\nreceived dreams are meaningless question\nnumber three a dream you wish you'd have\nmore often falling in love the first\ntime uh question number four a dream\nthat you wish people would have more\noften reconciliation dreams dreams of\nforgiveness dreams of letting go and are\nthose ones that we can train ourselves\nto have I don't know but those are the\nones that some people report toward the\nend of life and I just wonder if we had\nthat more in middle of our life we' be\nyou know we would have uh we would have\nless regrets and we'd be less un you\nknow encumbered by the fuss of the day\nwhy do you why is there any study to\nshow why people are having it later on\nin life no wow that's yeah and I can\ntell you that from my own experience\nwith cancer patients yeah they're called\ngenre dreams end of life dreams and\nagain our last act might be a massive\ndream and it tends to be positive not\nalways for near-death experiences to me\nI call that uh a dreaming coming to our\nrescue yeah could you imagine you're so\nright if you could have that earlier on\nlike all that beef all that fuss you\nknow it's a great answer you know I just\nI wish I could have let it go earlier\nyeah Fifth and final question we ask\nthis to every guest who's ever been on\nthe show if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be yeah before you speak\nor act do your best to imagine yourself\nin that person's shoes great answer Dr R\njohnel the book is called this is why\nyou dream thank you so much for joining\nus today if you don't already make sure\nyou follow Dr Raul johol on Instagram\nacross social media grab a copy of the\nbook we'll put the link in the comments\nand the caption section uh and I'm so\ngrateful for your time and energy today\nI've learned so much you've completely\ntransformed my way of thinking about\ndreams honestly through your book and\nthis interview I think I knew nothing\nabout dreams before we met I had really\npoor ideas and maybe some limited\nbeliefs and speaking to you today has\njust opened up a whole new area of\ngrowth for me that I don't even think I\nwas thinking about so I love the idea\nthat I'm walking away with some simple\nyet clear tools to actually start\nimplementing from tonight and tomorrow\nso I'm really excited about this dream\njourney and I hope everyone who's\nlistening and watching when you read the\nbook I hope you're going to go on a\ndream Journey with me too and I'd love\nto see you tag me and Dr Raul in some of\nthe experiments some of the tests that\nyou're carrying out in your own life\nthank you so much pleasure thank you so\nmuch for listening to this conversation\nif you enjoyed it you'll love my chat\nwith Adam Grant on why discomfort is the\nkey to growth and the strategies for\nunlocking your hidden potential if you\nknow you want to be more and achieve\nmore this year go check it out right now\nyou set a goal today you achieve it in 6\nmonths and then by the time it happens\nit's almost a relief there's no sense of\nmeaning and purpose you sort of expected\nit and you
