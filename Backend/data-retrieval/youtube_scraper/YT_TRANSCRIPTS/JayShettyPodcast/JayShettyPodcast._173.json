    "transcript": "narcissistic people are attracted to\npeople who will give them Supply\nphysical attractiveness status praise so\nyou just being a nice person and\npraising someone could actually be what\nmakes you attractive to them so people\nmay think well does that mean I have to\nstop being me I'd say no they may be\nattracted to you and you may be\ncompelled for a minute but the key is\nthen to know how to get off the carousel\nbefore it starts going too fast before\nwe jump into this episode I'd like to\ninvite you to join this community to\nhear more into views that will help you\nbecome happier healthier and more healed\nall I want you to do is click on the\nSubscribe button I love your support\nit's incredible to see all your comments\nand we're just getting started I can't\nwait to go on this journey with you\nthank you so much for subscribing it\nmeans the world to me the number one\nHealth and Wellness podcast J shett J\nshett the one the only J\nshett I want to start off Dr Romany by\nagain clarifying terms because I think\nwe're living at a time where there's so\nmany terms on Tik Tok and YouTube and\nsocial media and often they transpire\ninto how we talk to our family members\nfriends yes what is the difference\nbetween a narcissist and narcissistic\npersonality disorder so let's start\nthere because this is already muddying\nthe water so much right so narcissism is\na personality style right there's lots\nof different personality Styles out\nthere certainly narcissism is a more\nmaladaptive personality style because it\nputs people at odds with other people\nit's not good for their relationship but\nit is a personality style and in of\nitself it's not a disorder there is\nsomething called narcissistic\npersonality disorder which is when a\nperson is presenting with these various\nnarcissistic patterns we've talked about\nthe low and variable empathy the\nentitlement the grandiosity the\narrogance the Envy the admiration and\nvalidation seeking that whole laundry\nlist the egocentricity all the\nselfishness all that stuff right so all\nof that is happening it's chronic it's\npervasive it shows up in their life and\nvarious on a whole bunch of different\nrelationships the difference is they\nactually go to a therapist office who's\nlicensed and trained to issue a\ndiagnosis and that therapist determines\nlike yep I'm seeing these patterns\nthey're consistent they're across\nsituations and they may assign them that\ndiagnosis the vast majority of people\nwho have this personality style are\nnever going to be in a practitioner's\noffice who's going to make that\ndetermination and it gets tricky right\nbecause to call something a disorder\nraises a whole bunch of issues\npersonally Jay if I ran the world I\nthink we'd get rid of this diagnosis I\nthink we get nothing out of it it\ndoesn't I don't even think it helps the\nclients a lot of clinicians don't issue\nit because it feels stigmatizing there's\na whole host of reasons I think it\nshouldn't be but it is right now here's\nwhat you've got to remember when we look\nat narcissism in the world right so\nthere's people out there who are\nnarcissistic they might be mildly\nnarcissistic and a little bit more\nemotionally immature and just sort of\nselfish and shallow all the way up to\nsevere where it can be malignant and and\nit can be uh coercive and manipulative\nand all of that and there's all the\nstuff in between this book is really\nfocused on the in between right so most\npeople aren't dealing with someone\ncoercive that's and many are and that's\na much more severe issue that is\nprobably beyond the scope of the\nbook but most people who are dealing\nwith the mild\nnarcissism they're frustrated and\nannoyed but they're not\ndevastated and hurt like we see in that\nsort of middle level of narcissism right\nso the difference is literally that sort\nof mechanical point they weren't seen by\nsomeone and I don't know that any listen\nI'll be honest with you if I met someone\nat a dinner party and they start telling\nme their life I might even think in my\nhead I've got a hypothesis clinically\nwhat's happening in no Universe we\noccupy would I ever say to that person\neven if I talked to them for two hours I\nthink you have generalized anxiety\ndisorder I think you have bipolar too I\njust wouldn't say it right it's not the\nsetting it's not the situation I might\nstrongly suggest say hey you should talk\nto someone right so what get where it\ngets interesting is the mistake a lot of\npeople make is number one they assume\nthat if a person has narcissistic\npersonality disorder that their\nnarcissism is more severe not\nnecessarily there are people out there\nwith NPD narcissistic personality\ndisorder whose narcissism actually is\nnot as severe as people who were never\ndiagnosed because they never went into\nthat situation so you see what I'm\nsaying so there's people out there who\nare malignant narcissistic people\nthey're never seen by anyone we can\nspeculate we could spitball we' say yeah\nit's probably the case but that person\nwith NPD May simply seen a clinician the\nother piece though here too is that what\nit's doing is it's creating this very\nsort of strange space where people are\nsaying these are the patterns I'm seeing\nin a partner parent whomever I think\nthey might be narcissistic and the\ninternet as it does is very quick to to\nshame that person who do you think you\nare how could you think this about\nsomeone and this person has probably\nalready been really hurt really\ndevastated by this relationship is now\nbeing shamed for sharing like I think\nthis might be what's happening it's also\ncreating this s really painful space so\nsuffice it to say I think in the public\nconversation about narcissism we should\nonly call it narcissism getting into the\nWeeds on NPD is really getting on this\nsort of subtle clinical point and it\njust creates it it makes a lot of noise\nhere so we're not able to have the clear\nconversation that these personality\nstyles are harming the people who are in\nthese\nrelationships yeah it makes a lot of\nsense why do you think it is that all of\na sudden it seems at least culturally\nthat more people are interacting with\nnarcissists like you'll be talking to a\nfriend and they'll be like oh God I'm so\nglad I just got out relationship with\nthe narcissist or I'm struggling I'm\nhealing as your book teaches you how to\nlike I'm healing from this relationship\nI had I think they were narcissistic\nlike why is it all of a sudden we're\nfeeling this kind of awareness in\nculture has it always been there has it\nincreased what what's happened it's\nalways been there J I think as long as\nthere were people it has been there and\nI always say to people open up a history\nbook I'd say about 75% of the people\nthey've written about in that history\nbook were probably quite narcissistic\nnarcissistic people make history they\nand in fact honestly they often are\nresponsible for some of the greatest\nInnovations we've ever known doesn't\nmake them nice people and I'd say let\nthem innovate just don't go on a date\nwith them you know that's really what\nwe're talking about here so there is an\noutof the-box to them there's a fantasy\nthat they live in that they often feel\ncompelled to create so you better\nbelieve that they've always been there I\ndon't know that we would have had the\nleaps and balance we've had in some ways\nwithout that right so that said it's\nalways been there but we never had a\nname for it remember psychology is a\nfield in its infancy what's it been\naround 1507 25 years so it's it's\nevolving and so this concept of talking\nabout someone's personality in this way\nmaybe since the late 1800s we've even\nbeen having that conversation people\nhave been doing narcissistic stuff to\nPartners children family members since\ntime\nimmemorial we just didn't have a name\nfor it I think at some level because\nuntil recently I think almost all\ncultures were probably much more author\nitarian patriarchally patriarchally\norganized I think we're seeing sort of\nbigger conversations around that so I\nthink there was almost a strange sort of\nuniversal radical acceptance that some\npeople are just really jerky and let's\njust follow what they're saying and and\nso we didn't we just didn't even think\nof it that way but we see history books\nof Kings who were ogres and Invaders who\nwere horrific and these were not nice\npeople they were the narcissists of\ntheir time now to your other question\nwhy are we talking about it like even 10\nyears ago a person wouldn't have said my\npartner my boy you heard it that's what\nI mean but they would have said first of\nall we didn't have the platforms but if\nthey did talk about they're such a jerk\nwhy do they keep doing this to me I\ncan't figure this out everyone has\nalways been having the conversations we\ndidn't we're using different languaging\nnow and if anything we now have a\nconstruct we and and we Now understand\nthis hangs together the point of this\nbook was really to say there are people\nwith these personalities they're out\nthere the way they show up in\nrelationships is pretty consistently the\nsame and instead of blaming yourself and\nwondering what you could do it's not you\nyeah it's really them and they're having\ntheir process and their journey and\nprobably not going to get the help they\nneed to defend it against it but rolling\nup and turning your life into a human\nsacrifice to please or win over or prove\nsomething to an unwinable over person I\nhave watched people waste lifetimes\ndoing this you know and it's even\nparticularly compelling if it's her\nparent but even if it's a long-term\nintimate relationship with some\nespecially if they got into the\nrelationship young so this has always\nbeen a thing yeah no that's that's that\nmakes a lot of sense and I appreciate\nhow our vocabulary evolves with time and\nas that expands and extends it allows us\nto Better Label and understand things\nand I know that this book is primarily\nabout the relationship a narcissistic\nrelationship and then the healing\nJourney but before we dive into that I\nwanted to ask you a question how do you\nstop attracting a narcissist like is\nthere a way to not attract a narcissist\nDre I wish I could say yes and here's\nwhere I want to actually give my props\nto everyone's listening out there who\nhas attracted a narcissist you know why\nyou attracted a narcissist because\nyou're attractive and what I mean by\nattractive is you may be physically\nbeautiful it may be your physique it may\nbe your something you know it may be\nyour social status it may be that you\ncould do something for them what's\nattractive to them may not be attractive\nto the rest of us you're attractive to\nthem because you're attractive because\nyou may have power of some kind in the\nworld when I say power I don't mean like\nyou're a leader I mean you're\nself-possessed many people who get into\nthese relationships we have this\nmistaken assumption that the people who\nget into these relationships are\nShrinking Violets who have low\nself-esteem absolutely not I I've got to\ntell you some of the people i' seen get\ninto these relationships I'm like woo I\nshould have your self-esteem they there\nthere they're strong and they're they\nknow who they are and they're saying\nthis thing dismantled me Brick by Brick\nI was really well put together when I\nmet this person right so this isn't\nabout a person who doesn't have\nself-esteem it can be but it's\ndefinitely not an absolute narcissistic\npeople are attracted to people who will\ngive them Supply what is supply for\nevery narcissistic person might be a\nlittle different but it's usually\nphysical attractiveness status praise so\nyou just being a nice person and\npraising someone could actually be what\nmakes you attractive to them so people\nmay think well does that mean I have to\nstop being me I'd say no they may be\nattracted to you and you may be\ncompelled for a minute but the key is\nthen to know how to get off the carousel\nbefore it starts going too fast good\nanswer good answer I'm like it it makes\na lot of sense and again it's not you\nit's not you it comes back to that which\nI like to walk me through the consistent\nyou talk about narcissism being\nconsistent walk me through the\nconsistent pattern of a narcissistic\nrelationship so that anyone who's\nlistening can because I think like\nyou're saying a lot of us sometimes feel\nscared to admit that we might even be\nwith a narcissist because it's it's\nscary to accept that and admit that and\nhave that realization because we think\nit's something to do with us we think\nwe've wasted time there can be a sunk\ncost bias of I thought I had a future\nwith this person so walk me through the\npattern of a narcissistic relationship\nlet's just talk briefly\nit helps us understand the pattern they\nhave traits things like I talked about\nthe entitlement the lack of empathy the\ngrandiosity the arrogance the\nselfishness I want you to think of a\nnarcissistic person as a volcano and\nthat volcano has got this bubbling lava\nand the lava for the narcissistic person\nis shame and insecurity so they want to\nbe able to plug the top of that volcano\nright and that plug is all this stuff\nthe entitlement the grandiosity I'm\nperfect I'm great it's this so it it\nkeeps all that stuff under WS that's not\na conscious process right so but every\nso often in life something's going to\npush that lid off to the side which\nmight be feedback a criticism somebody\nends a relationship with them whatever\nit is something their day doesn't go the\nway they want they get stuck in traffic\nand they're late to something they don't\nget the table they want in a restaurant\nwhatever it may be that nudges that man\nhole cover over and the lava starts\nspilling out and that lava is their rage\nand their anger because their shame has\nbeen shown all of this is unconscious so\nall these patterns in the\nrelationship the way they show up in the\nnarcissistic person is\nmanipulation invalidation of the other\nperson minimization of what another\nperson is going through uh gaslighting\nrage and\nreactivity uh future faking which means\npromises are made and broken just to\nkeep a person sort of on the hook um\nthere will be uh blame shifting they\nwon't take responsibility they'll always\nblame the other person which is why\npeople in these relationships always\ntend to blame themselves there's a lot\nof Deceit betrayal lying infidelity\nthere is neglect over time they just\ngive less and less and less to the\nrelationship and the person in the\nrelationship is trying to make do on the\ntiniest tiniest bits of being noticed\nthat's how they show up in the\nrelationship everything in the\nrelationship is about them getting\nSupply and validation they have\nabsolutely no interest in the needs\nwants and honestly subjective reality of\nthe other person in the relationship\nover time the other person gets almost\nis considered an inconvenience if you\nwant something you're an inconvenience\nmuch like this cup Cup's convenient when\nI want to drink from it but the cup all\nof a sudden said hey can you take me to\nCVS on the way home like what cup you're\na cup don't tell me that so they view Us\nin that sort of objectified lens all of\nthese dynamics mean that over time in\norder for the relationship ship to work\nthe other person has to entirely\nsacrifice themselves and buy into the\nreality system of the narcissistic\nperson but that doesn't all happen\novernight oftentimes at least in an\nadult narcissistic relationship whether\nit's an intimate relationship or\nfriendship that early phase is very\nidealized and seductive it's called love\nbombing but it's really this phase where\nthey're winning not only winning you\nover with gestures and tactics but with\nAttunement and atten or seeming\nAttunement and attention they pay pay\nintense attention to you but you realize\nafterwards is some of that intense\nattention was them learning things about\nyou that were going to be turned around\nand used against you down the road\nthat's often a point of Devastation for\na person who says I was vulnerable with\nthis person I told them things that i'\nnever told anyone before and then six\nmonths in I was being shamed and\nhumiliated and and you know it was being\nused to sort of destabilize me there is\na point where that love bombing phase\nthen starts heading into a place where\nthere's 10 good things one bad thing oh\none bad thing everyone has a bad day\nnine Bad Thing nine good things one bad\nthing over time though that ratio pretty\nmuch comes to like maybe one to one so\nnow you're having as much difficult\nchallenging stuff and then these little\nsprinklings of good things happening\nthat's the origin of the trauma bond\nthat back and forth good bad hot cold\nI'm here I'm not here is where people\nwill often find themselves falling into\na cycle of justifying blaming themselves\nbecause it was so great it was great for\ntwo or three months so how did it not\nbecome great maybe I'm doing something\nso the person will literally it's almost\nlike you know when you open a bag you\nknow you're trying to find something in\na bag and you take everything out of the\nbag chaotically and it's all in the\nairport on the ground and it was that\none little like your headphones that's\nwhat people in narcissistic\nrelationships do they open the bag that\nis themselves and pull everything out\ntrying to figure out what is wrong with\nme why did go from baby where can I take\nyou to dinner I'll take you anywhere to\nwhat like please stop interrupting me\nand you're you're thinking what just\nhappened and so basically once the\nnarcissistic person almost feels kind of\nconfident they've got your supply\nwhether it's a promise maybe you live\nwith them maybe you've really committed\ninto a long-term relationship you said I\nlove you or whatever that they've got\nyou where they want you then there're\nsort of almost narcissistic folks are\nalso very novelty seeking they kind of\nget bored easily so you being around\nfrom time to time they'll be into you\nbut then from other times they won't\nthey do like they do like the idea that\nsomeone's a constant source of supply\nand then over time there can be a real\nprocess of discard they just really it\ncan feel like they just don't care at\nall anymore basically what they do is\nthey no longer fulfill the roles and\nresponsibilities of what it means to be\nin a close relationship which is empathy\ncompassion kindness Attunement\nself-awareness these are the respons\nresponsibilities we have in a human\nrelationship and they do not fulfill\nthem I even hate putting them as\nresponsibilities I think that they come\nautomatically for healthy person and\nthen if you do decide to leave or even\nif they decide to leave you start to\nenter potentially a cat and- Mouse game\nof hoovering where they'll pull you back\nsee how you're doing sometimes they'll\neven figure out oh they're happy now let\nme go see if I can SP spin that around a\nlittle bit wow wow I mean those\npatterns sound so\npainful and they found they sound so\nstrenuous and stressful and you know\nheartbreaking in so many ways why what\nare the\nexcuses that people keep telling\nthemselves and what\njustifications stop us from healing I\nmean it go even more foundationally on\nthat why do we justify right when you\nthink about one of the most Primal human\nneeds needs it's attachment we need\nother people we are not meant to be solo\nacts human beings are tribal we we\nevolved in social groups our brains\ndidn't change that much we still need\nour people we need love we do we need\nconnection and people say what about the\nnarcissist I said they need it more than\nanyone they want all the Supply right so\nwe need to be together but that\nespecially in a child that need for\nattachment is everything and if a child\nhas an unattuned parent or even an\nabusive parent the child doesn't have\nthe option to say I think I'm going to\nsplit up with them and see what I'm\ngoing to go on parent hinge and see if I\ncan find someone new right doesn't work\nlike that the child has to hold this\nparent in esteem which means the child\nthen needs to devalue themselves what am\nI doing wrong how could I be more and\nthe child really learns how to be\neverything that parent wants and needs\nto the detriment of their own needs\nright this is our back story all exactly\nso now let's just jump that to adulthood\nright so the child comes up with all\nkinds of fantasies but in adulthood they\nmay be things like everyone has a bad\nday relationships are tough I'm no\npicnic myself they've been working\nreally\nhard we did have a good weekend they did\ntell me I love you I mean I could go on\nfor the next two hours about all the\njustifications I've heard right so the\njustifications are not not only\nproliferate they come easily and Jay\nthey're reinforced by the world right\nbecause the world will say oh\nrelationships are tough maybe they're\njust having a bad day right so now what\nyou're saying is completely in line with\nsort of what the prevailing wisdom would\nbe and you do that enough every time\nthese really invalidating destabilizing\nthings that cut to the core of your\nidentity happen the people who tend to\nget more stuck in these relationships\nquite frankly are the more empathic\npeople while narcissistic people are\nattracted to people who are whatever\nSupply attractive they are to them the\npeople who get stuck are the people who\nare more vulnerable to trauma bonding\nand who have more empathy and as a\nresults are more likely to make those\nexcuses and justifications right they're\ngoing to be more open to the idea that\nthere's there's always different ways to\nthere's another point of view that's\nwhat empathic people do and that's how\nit happens but in a trauma bonded\nrelationship and it's also about\ncognitive dissonance right that we don't\nlike we don't like the tension of\ninconsistency within ourselves so we're\nalways trying to make it fit and how do\nwe relieve that tension and make it fit\nwe justify then we can maintain the\nstatus quo and human beings are also\nhomeostatic creatures we like the stat I\nwant to keep living here I want to keep\nhaving this routine I don't want to find\na new place to put my toothbrush I don't\nwant to wake up in a new place even if\nyou kind of might want to over time many\nsurvivors will say I don't even care if\nI wake up in you know in a random place\nas long as I'm not waking up here but\nhow much terribleness had to happen to\nthe person in that period of time and so\nit's a person is just getting sort of\nslowly distanced from their true nature\nthe longer a person is in a narcissistic\nrelationship the more they literally\nhave to abandon\nthemselves that's what I wanted to touch\non actually where you got to is you know\nwhat is the impact of narcissistic abuse\nlike how because I think often we also\nthink like oh yeah well you should know\nthat you know he was a waste of time or\nwell look what look what she did to you\nlike you should should be aware like you\nknow it's it's almost like we assume\nthat it should logically make sense to\nsomeone that they should be happy that\nthey're now away from this person but\noften with people who've been with\nnarcissistic people especially\nempathetic people they're still saying\nwell I hope they're okay I hope that\nperson's okay like I know they're\nstruggling what is the impact of someone\nwho's experience narcissistic abuse on a\ndeep scientific psychological level like\nwhat what is actually going on for them\nso what we're seeing pretty consistently\nacross and now I can say now thousands\nof people we've looked at who have\nexperienced these relationships is\nconsistently we see a problematic level\nof rumination regret anxiety sadness\nself- blame\nself-doubt a um a sense of\nhypervigilance a a social anxiety that\ncomes from it and I want to put a pin in\nthat hypervigilant piece because I want\nto come back to that in a moment an\ninteresting sort of mild dissociation\nwhere a person has become dissociated\nfrom their needs their wants and their\ntrue nature because that has been so\nconsistently invalidated in this\nrelationship you see problems with sleep\nyou see you see the neurovative stuff we\nsee in depression like the changes in\nappetite you see problems with\nconcentration what's interesting though\nabout survivors of narcissistic abuse is\nthat some of them may actually develop\nclinical depression but most don't and\nwhat I'll see is these are folks when\nthey are surrounded by healthy supports\ntherapists friends they're animated\nthey're Lely they don't seem like a\nperson who's under that heavy weight of\ndepression right so it is really the\nwhen the relationship is present it's\ntaking its toll and it is why so many\nsurvivors of narcissistic abuse are able\nto roll up and be terrific parents\ndespite what's happening you see what\nI'm saying because it's not a tra it's\nnot a mental illness it's a normative\nreaction to this but even with that\nhypervigilance there's a lot of of talk\nabout how nice survivors of narcissistic\nabuse are we recently did an Instagram\nlive about this and it was just me sort\nof yammering on about something I'd\nheard that day I was really struck by\nthe strength it had in our community\nbecause we talk about empathy empathy\nempathy and survivors but one thing I'm\nreally seeing in my in I'm again so many\nclients now at this point and other\npeople telling their stories is that the\nempathy is almost functioning as a bit\nof a trauma response like let me be as\nkind as possible let me be as good as\npossible POS and so it gets very\nconfusing for you like am I empathic am\nI trying to survive and is my empathy\nliterally like this this trauma is a\nsurvival response to try to like it's\nalmost like that Fawn response we talk\nabout that Fawn trauma response where I\nam going to be what this this harmful\nperson needs me to be so I can win them\nover and I will be okay right so and\nthen after that though there's shame why\nwas I so nice to this person they were\nterrible to me like what's wrong with\nwith me and something I really try to\nfocus on with survivors is to say this\nempathic responsive compassionate part\nof you is beautiful we've got to heal\nyou and not lose that does that make\nsense so this isn't an amputation this\nis very much about we've got to keep\nthis here pull the shame off of it but\nallow you to become more Discerning wow\nand that's the trick in doing this work\nwith clients and for an individual who's\nhealing\nthemselves yeah wow I mean that analogy\nyou just gave of it's not an\namputation that's really interesting\nbecause I think we would think that when\nsomething's that toxic and abusive you\njust want to cut it out get rid of it\nmove it away but but that's not what\nyou're saying no and and in fact you\nknow this is one of the things I really\ntake umage and I'm frustrated with Tik\nTock and and places where people are\ngiving Quicky\nadvices it's almost as though if you\nhave empathy for the narcissistic person\nyou're foolish and absolutely not they\nare in their fashion there's there's\nsomething not quite right there and\nthey're not even anywhere close to\naddressing it my goal for folks is you\nwant to have empathy for them and Ian if\nyou don't want to I get that too for\nwhat you've been through but if that\nempathy for you them is something you\nwant to maintain yes I still need you to\ndisengage can you disengage from someone\nand still empathize with them I believe\nabsolutely yes wow yeah and that's and\nthat's a hard balance for the people in\nyour life that love you to see that\nbecause it can be really really\nchallenging to see someone you love feel\nempathy to someone who's hurt them\nreally bad correct and it's also even\nfor yourself and this is where it can\nbring up complicated emotions like pity\nand guilt right and I try and again the\nthe work of healing is that pity is that\nthese mechanisms inside of you that\nattend and attune and care about other\nhuman beings are still working which we\nwant those to always remain\nonline but that you ensuring that you\npull yourself back from a harmful\nsituation the world needs you we need\nyour whole you not the version that you\nhad to create to remain in this toxic\nrelationship and that Balancing Act of\nretaining empathy when you've been so\nhurt by someone that's some of the\nhardest work of healing I see people do\nit every day and it's really quite\nbeautiful but a lot of them think have I\nbecome a bad person because I'm I'm so\nangry at this person and in fact a big\npoint bring up in the book and I'm going\nto sort of Jump Ahead here is I actually\ndon't know that forgiveness always has a\nplace in these relationships and this is\na complicated conversation a lot of\npeople say forgiveness is all good and\nI'm like slow the no no stop the presses\nit's absolutely not and there's a whole\nbody of scientific research that\nsuggests that repeatedly forgiving a\nrepeat perpetrator actually harms the\nforgiver there's no win in that and so\nin what way in it it lowers their\nwell-being it can result in negative\nmood symptoms\nI mean of course you keep do you keep\ndoing this cuz I think forgiveness is is\na very personal decision but it's also\nnot a necessary one to heal and I think\nthat the message a lot of people get is\nwell if you're gon to if you don't\nforgive them you're never going to heal\nthe hell you're not and I'm going to be\nvery Frank with you Jay there's some\nnarcissistic people who harmed me\nimmeasurably I don't forgive them and I\nheal just fine it comes back to the you\ncan't just say the cliches to people and\nhope they'll move on and be okay with it\nand it can be really hard for that\nindividual to again either rise or lower\nthemselves down to either of those like\nI know someone who's been through\nsomething recently who's dealing with it\nwith empathy and I know for them their\nfriends and family are like how can you\nbe empathetic to this person and so\nthey're dealing with it that way or\nyou'd have the opposite in your case\nwhere you're saying I actually don't\nwant to be empathetic towards them I\ndon't want to forgive them and your\nfamily is saying well you should be but\nI do I here's where it gets interesting\nI empathize with them yes don't forgive\nthem right okay so you encourage\nmaintain those two states simultaneously\nand I think that again one of the big\nexercises in the book and I think it\nmight be one of the most important ones\nis something I do have been doing with\nclients for a long time which is the\nmultiple truths exercise because it's so\neasy to say write all the terrible stuff\nand I do tell people to record all the\nterrible stuff but I said like let's\njust be I want you to write everything\nyou feel for this person and a person\nmight write this is my mother I hate her\nshe had a tough backstory she was\nterrible to us children she lives alone\nI feel sorry for her I wish she would\nchange I know she won't change this is\nliterally the stream of Consciousness\nfor a Survivor you look at that and\nright there it's manifest why survivors\nare so confused but I absolutely believe\nand not everyone does some people say I\nhave no empathy for this person but I\nthink it's quite possible and this is\nwhere everyone say no that's not\npossible if you empathize with them\nyou'd forgive them I say I understand\nwhy they are the way they are I even\nkind of understand why why they did what\nthey did what they did was\nunforgivable and so I do I wish them no\nill will in fact if good things happen\nto them so be it if bad things happen to\nthem so be it so there's a mild\nindifference to it but it wouldn't be a\nloss I mean I don't think again there's\nso many forms of empathy and empathy is\nits own complicated conversation but I\ndon't think that the not forgiving is a\nlack of empathy because forgiveness\nreally reflects the harm it's done to us\nand people say no no no it's a gift for\nyou too M yeah and I'm not giving them\nthis gift because I know they would do\nit again if I let this person back in\nthey would do it\nagain I love that distinction between\nempathy and forgiveness really important\nto understand another word that a whole\nchapter is dedicated to radical\nacceptance Define that for us so that we\ncan understand how that's used because\nagain even looking at the difference\nbetween empathy and forgiveness it's so\ninteresting to me just how subtle and\nspecific healing looks like as opposed\nto this almost abstract Journey that's\noften painted of healing being like you\nmove from this stage to here where it's\nyou know right yeah so so radical\nacceptance is it's it's I have to say\nthere's one there's two probably two\nessential ingredients to Healing you're\ngoing to go through radical acceptance\nyou're going to go through grief and\nthen it's sort of people are going to go\non different paths but radical\nacceptance is the absolute acceptance\nthat these patterns are not this\nperson's behavior is not going to change\nat least not significantly enough to\nmake this into healthy relationship that\nthis Behavior affected you and as long\nas you're in the purview of this\nBehavior as long as I keep doing this to\nyou it will keep hurting you because\nsome people have said to me they say I\nradically accepted they're not going to\nchange how come when they say these\nthings to me it still bothers me I'm\nlike because it's hurting you it's still\nhurtful just because you understand why\nit's coming out of them you you didn't\njust become a piece of concrete like you\nstill have a soul and a heart and a\npsyche that can be hurt so some people I\nthink thought radical acceptance was\nlike a magic pill that if I take this\nthe narcissistic person will never\nbother me again and so all of that\npartic but the key element of it is this\nis not going to change and all decisions\nfrom that point forward have to be made\non that basis by definition narcissism\nis like I said a maladaptive personality\nstyle but it's also a rigid personality\nstyle the less healthy the personality\nthe less uh flexible that it is so very\nhealthy people have extraordinarily\nflexible personality so the core of\nmental health is flexibility it's almost\nlike physical health right a person\nwho's physically healthy has a lot of\nflexibility in their muscles and Joints\na mentally healthy person has a lot of\nflexibility in their psyche how do we\nDefine flexibility in our psyche I would\nsay it's it's an adaptability it is a\nself-awareness and awareness of others\nit's the ability to engage in novel\nproblem solving and not get stuck on a\nsingular solution it's the capacity to\nbe able to self-regulate and to self\nsooth those are some of the things I'd\nfile into that sort of that flexibility\nI'm not just saying it's like sure I'll\ngo anywhere you want I'm not saying it's\nthe it's the I'm game for anything but\nwhen things when there's disappointment\nthere's the capacity to cope with it\nit's a lot of coping a lot of resilience\nis in that flexibility piece right that\nis the core of Health I have worked with\npeople who have survived severe trauma\nit's I and but the the ones who really\nare standing in a different it's that\nflexibility right and you think about it\nif a tree is flexible it'll Bend With\nthe Wind if it's not it's going to snap\nif the wind is too hard that would\nreally be the best sort of an analogy so\nnarcissism is this sort of maladaptive\nrigid style there's very little\nself-reflective capacity for the\nnarcissistic person very little\nself-awareness for the narcissistic\nperson and very little awareness of the\npeople around them there is little\nmotivation to change most grandiose\nnarcissists subject objectively think of\nthemselves as great people if you ask\nthem they'll say I'm a great guy like\nI'll help anyone I'll do anything for\nanyone I'm I'm just a cool person they\nbelieve it having just cheated on their\ngirlfriend two nights before that\nthey're able to maintain what almost\nfeels like a delusional self schema\nthose things are not amenable to change\nand and again the nice thing about being\nan old lady is you I've been doing this\nso long that I've seen cases 15 20 years\nand when I tell you that there's been\nsome interesting things they've learned\nabouts in some cases they had\nco-occurring conditions addiction is a\ngreat example the addiction is managed\nlike they've been sober for many years\nbut that core personality they are\ndefinitely not fit for an intimate\nrelationship at least not one where\nsomeone's not going to get hurt so that\nradical acceptance of the all of\nit that moment is the penny drop moment\nbecause now people see the path forward\nvery different this is no longer once\nthe kids grow up it's going to get\neasier this is no no longer when he gets\nthe promotion things are going to get\nbetter this is no longer when the\ngrandkids come my parents is going to\ncalm down this is this is it and I've\nsat with many clients and said I'm going\nto put something to you and I'm going to\nsay if I were to tell you this is it\nthis is never going to change how would\nthat affect the decisions you make most\nclients will say can I tell you next\nweek because that's a lot to take in but\nthe challenge with radical acceptance\nJay is that I wish I could say it's h\nand the light comes in the window you\nknow couple things is that radical\nacceptance doesn't mean you're signing\noff on this it doesn't mean you're\ngiving into it doesn't mean you're\nagreeing with it it's not that it is\nyou're seeing it absolutely and\npainfully clearly you know what happens\nafter you painfully and radically see\nsomething the grief comes over you like\na tsunami because this is your mom the\nmom you always thought one day we're\ngoing to have the moment or your dad\nwhere you're like one day they're going\nto get me or the part partner we're like\nwe are going to grow old together and\nit's going to be okay you're giving up a\nnarrative you're giving up a hope you're\ngiving up a life story you're giving up\nthings you held on to since you were a\nchild that's Devastation and I tell\nfolks now we're going to hold on tight\nbecause grief is the most human of\nexperiences there's it's one of other\nthan life other than being born and\ndying I don't know of any other\nUniversal Human Experience other than\ngrief all human beings lose\nright we lose something or someone and\nwe all have a very similar experience\ninternally we we we grief and that's why\nwe have rituals right but ultimately we\ngo through a period of grief and I think\nin this Modern Age we think we're better\nthan grief we think we can Soldier\nthrough oh I can make my grief go like\nthis nobody gets to make their grief go\nquicker right it grief is grief and that\ngrief actually leads People Jay to say\nokay this feels terrible maybe I should\ngo back back into the relationship maybe\nI made a mistake maybe I'm not seeing\nthis clearly maybe I'm the problem maybe\nI'm the narcissist and so the holding on\nduring the\ngrief understanding what's happening\nwithin you that the loss isn't just I'm\nnot talking to my partner anymore or I'm\ndistanced from my mother or I'm getting\na divorce but the grief is how much of\nyourself you lost in this relationship\nwhen people have to dive into that some\nthey say I'm kind of glad they're gone\nbut oh what what just happened to me\nyeah yeah it's the grief of the life you\nonce had the thought you going to have\nyou thought you could have the grief of\nthe loss of the person that you lost\nwhile you dissolved into this\nrelationship and and I've seen that from\nthe people I know not people I would say\nthese are people that I know in my life\nbut I've seen just that dissolving of\none's identity like completely clueless\neven if they've disengaged to I don't\nknow who I am anymore and and I don't\nknow what to do anymore and I don't know\nwhether I was confident or whether I was\nbubbly or whether I was extrovert or\nintrovert like I just don't know yep and\nwhat's the first step when you're\nfeeling I don't know what where do you\nwhere's where's the starting point I\ntell folks we're taking you back to\nbasics and it's little things like I'll\nsay three times a day set a little timer\nif you want I want you to just when that\nlittle notification comes up want you to\nstop and say how do I feel right now am\nI cold am I hot am I hungry am I thirsty\nlike physiological functions figure out\nwhere you want your thermostat and move\nit and see like oh I I I'm feeling 60 68\nthis is nice people don't even know that\nI'll say what do you want on your pizza\nyou'd be amazed how many people are\nflumix by that question they say well he\nalways wanted what do you want on your\npizza and they'll say and they'll catch\nthemselves this isn't meant to be silly\nthis is how even these these sort of\nloow hanging questions become a place\nwhere a person is now being able to\nrecreate a subjective Focus they were\ntold for years you can't be hungry you\njust ate you can't be cold I'm warm\nyou're not tired you got plenty of sleep\nthat's what they were told so when\nthat's done to you not just once but\nhundreds if not thousands of times just\nthat initial process and part of what I\nwrite about in the book is just you keep\nreorienting to yourself and you ask\nyourself a few times a day like what's\nthe\nI'm actually feeling a little bit cold\nand that's okay even if everyone else\nhas a bathing suit on it's okay wow it's\njust bringing that person back into\ntheir body into their body because\nthat's our most physical tangible way of\nknowing how we feel and because we've\ngone so far away from understanding how\nwe feel that's going to be the easiest\nway same with what do you want in your\npizza it sounds silly but it's not it's\nwell let's get these basic decisions\nright let's get these really amateur\ndecisions right rather than thinking who\nam I what is the goal of my life like\nbut you work up to that and when you ask\npeople who am I like I don't know I'll\nsay what what do you stand for tell me\nsomething that's important to you and\nthey will really say no I've never\nthought in these levels I mean your\nfocus for so many people's meaning and\npurpose right to me that's when we're\ngetting into the latter stages of really\nthis you know this individuation and\nthis autonomy of what is Meaningful to\nyou what is purposeful I remember a\nclient once saying to me we're talking\nabout meaning of purpose and she said\nare you kidding me what's meaningful and\npurposeful she said I just want to get\nto a day where I don't think about them\nand I said great then that's that's\nwhere it is right now and over time\nwe're going to build on that but that\ncan feel very Out Of Reach for people\nlike in fact in my healing program this\nmonth it's it's going to be meaning and\npurpose month and even I as I construct\nthat curriculum I'm realizing like I\nwant I a lot of the usual conversation\nabout meaning and purpose I'm almost\nhaving to have the conversation point\nyou know point two of what it means when\nyou're\ngoing through this and someone who's a\nsurvivor of narcissistic abuse but then\nit's also the willingness to turn to\ntrusted others I'm going to give you a\nsilly example of something that happened\ntoday I had a very problematic call\ntoday right with someone and I had to\nput the call on speaker because someone\nwas helping me with something in the\nhouse and I had to be I she was doing\nher work quietly but it wasn't a\nconfidential call it was it was a\nbusiness thing and the call went\nterribly the person was very\ndisrespectful very dismissive and I've\nbeen through narcissistic abuse in many\nways and shapes and forms in my life so\nmy first tendency was am I being too\nsensitive am I being too demanding am I\nbeing ridiculous that's what I was\nthinking and at one point the lady who\nwas help helping me out she kind of\nlooked at me rolled her eyes I rolled my\neyes and she looked back at me and she\nsaid yeah and I got off the phone and\nthe person who was helping with\nsomething else she had nothing to do\nwith this call and I closed my eyes and\nthe person said the person in the room\nwith me said yeesh that was absolutely\nridiculous and I looked at her and I\nsaid say more and she said I can't\nbelieve how dismissive that person was\nshe didn't even do the basic and Jay I\nfelt whole because my inner experience\nwhich I still doubt after all these\nyears and I've come a long way but my\ninner experience this person outside of\nme who I know cares about me said it\nwasn't okay how she talked to you and\neach time that happens we have a micro\nadjustment of that was on point I I read\nthat situation correctly and then I was\nemboldened to make a stronger decision\nand decide not to go into to do what\nthis person was asking me to do was like\na speaking thing and I'm like no I don't\nwant to do that but that other person's\npresence yeah having that safe space and\nthis is so a big part of the healing\nthen becomes building up safe validating\nanti-gas lights as I call them in your\nlife people who see you and say that\nwasn't okay or are you okay or that was\ndisrespectful they did not speak nicely\nto you whatever it is most survivors are\nso used to being spoken to badly they're\nlike well business as usual but to have\nthat this is why people go into therapy\nand so then I was able to take the much\nBolder leap of no I'm actually going to\nend up going to the other meeting but\nthanks I don't know that I would have\nhad that kind of Courage this is what\nhealing is you build up those people\neven if it's one or two people giving\nyourself permission\nto to put I call it the 9010 inversion\nmost of us put 90% of ourselves into our\nmost toxic relationships and 10% into\nthe giving reciprocal loving ones that\nrun easily I said flip the math I want\n90% into those good relationships and\nphone it into the toxic ones yeah that's\nso true and and it's it's interesting\nbecause I think that kind of answers the\nnext question I was going to ask but\nthis idea of I think when someone's\ngoing through that healing Journey\nthey're almost oscillating between like\nwell to I know myself again oh I don't\nknow who I am anymore I feel like I know\nwhat I want on pizza oh my gosh I have\nno idea you know so I feel like they go\nthrough this what I I think that partly\nanswers that you need these people in\nyour life who are constantly reminding\nyou and as you said anti-gas lighting\nyou what else can someone do when\nthey're kind of oscillating between that\nI think I'm making progress I'm not sure\nanymore I think I'm making progress I'm\nlost again how do you what do you find\nin that period embrace the oscillation\nright because it is it's calibration\nright you're you're sort of it's like a\nchild wobbly on their feet when they're\nlearning to walk you're you're learning\nthis again and so that wobbliness is you\nit's the it's their internalized voice\nand your individuated self kind of\nhaving a little bit of an argument and\nsort of view that indiv that part of you\nthat's trying to individuate like say\nyou got this and that's an old voice and\nthat old we can just sort of say you\nknow you're you're actually not welcome\nhere anymore like you could just step\nout thank you and the but it's the\nindividuated voice and the internalized\nthe narcissistic internalized or the\ngaslighted internalized voice and\nthey're they're going they're still\nfighting it out and we feel as though am\nI aren't I just like today anyone\nwatching that call I mean but said this\nwas not okay and the the person it was\nalmost like the emperor not wearing any\nclothes right that this person was\nsaying this Emperor is naked go away\nRomany go away and so I think that that\ninitially we need those voices a lot\nmore and there'll still be times when we\nwe will T because I think there's\ncertain trigger situations that kind of\nremain pretty consistent for survivors\nfor a long long time we do hold it\ninternally and we were told too Jay many\nsurvivors are told they're up if they\nwant to achieve a goal do you really\nthink you're going to pull that off like\nI think you're reaching a little too\nhigh so they were minimized and\ntrivialized for wanting to do something\nthat they still hear that inner voice of\ndon't be ridiculous you're never going\nto be able to do that and they make that\nvoice their own instead of trying to\nlearn like that kind of that was an\nunwanted visitor so let's see if you can\nsort of treat it that way and we can\neven think about if you look at trauma\nTheory we talk about the protector\npersecutor kind of a model that the\npersecuting voice in a strange way is\ndoing this really messed up way of\nkeeping you safe because it's telling\nyou like in essence it it's the that\npersecuting voice is that voice is\ntelling you you're going to fail so you\ndon't try and when you were in the\nnarcissistic relationship and you failed\nthey would humiliate and shame you right\nor tell you it was going to happen but\nif you can say that okay I see what\nyou're trying to do persecuting Bo I'll\nbe fine if this doesn't go well because\nit'll be on my terms and if you really\nhave done radical acceptance even when\nthe narcissistic person rolls their eyes\nand says oh big surprise you have to\nkeep coming back to this is a them thing\nthis is not a me thing not saying it\ndoesn't hurt this is a carousel that\nreally takes a toll on people but it can\nbe done but that oscillation starts to\nbecome a little less oscillate the more\npeople have these validating voices\npeople build up what we call efficacy\nthe the idea that they're able to do\nsomething right so the first time we\nable we're able to do something\nsuccessfully from make a cake or change\nthe oil in our car uh use a drill and\nput something in the wall the that what\nit does to the psyche is remarkable so I\ntell survivors keep keep trying new\nthings because the more efficacy you\nbuild that also helps Foster\nindividuation so I'm like grab the drill\nif you put a few holes in the wall but\nthe picture goes up you're going to feel\nreally good about the picture going up\ntry to make the difficult sule you may\nburn a few but when it's made great I\ndid try to do this with bread I still\nhave not successfully raised a loaf of\nbread so it's my last neurotic wound but\nI think that when we find some people\nlearn and other people do all kinds of\ninteresting things I see like some folks\nI've worked with learned languages and\nthey learned how to play a musical\ninstrument and but they'll say this\nfeels so good because back in the day I\nwould have been made fun of for this\nthose who are able to get out will say\nit's so interesting to do this and that\nconfidence starts jumping into other\nareas of their life yeah I mean it's\nreally a rehabilitation of right self\nidentity self-worth self-confidence self\nacceptance you're almost teaching\nyourself to do things again in order to\nfeel whole right absolutely but you know\nwhat you it's interesting see use\nrebuild for a lot of people it's a build\nbecause if this happened to them in\nchildhood their individuated identity\nnever got to form at all wow so this is\na build yeah it's a build it's from\nscratch Dr Romy this is you know so\ninformative I I'm thinking of so many\npeople right now who I know are going to\nbenefit from our conversation today\nbecause it's almost like I feel like the\nmore and more I'm speaking to people the\nmore and more I hear about people de\nwith this in their lives but I want to\nask you one last question and it's this\nidea of can going back to that empathy\npoint that forgiveness point for the\nperson who's healing from the\nnarcissistic person for them can the\nnarcissistic person ever\nheal so it's a listen I I do believe in\nhuman potentiality I'm I'm probably\nnever going to bet on the psychopathic\nor narcissistic horse in the race but\nmight might they at least come in the\ntop five maybe and what I mean by that\nis part of this is an understanding the\norigins of narcissism right some\nnarcissistic folks their personality\ndevelopment was very much shaped by\nadversity trauma neglect loss chaos\nattachment moons\nright that\nsubgroup if they are willing humbly to\nengage into the work of growth they do\nexcellent trauma informed worth work\nwith a with a\ntherapist and then get beyond the trauma\ninformed work and are able to reflect on\nhow they they're able to create that\nschema of how they're they affect others\nright to pull it's almost like you're\npulling away um the you're pulling open\nGates and say there's people out there\nsee this thing you're doing they're\nbeing affected and it it's really\nopening the schema out of how they're\ndesperately trying to protect themselves\nto how other people are getting hurt and\nI have it's interesting I I work with a\nnarcissistic client once for many many\nyears and I I I sort of cut back my\npractice and I've had one or two of them\nReach back like oh can I work with you\nI'm like you know I've really kind of\nshut up shot but they you know what they\nsaid though one one in particular said I\nam I'm screaming at my girlfriend and I\nknow it's not okay now he's still\nscreaming at her not so good but he does\nknow he's like I know it's not okay and\nshe may leave me and I probably deserve\nit I and he's like you taught me that\nwow he's still screaming\non that part but humility is such a big\npart of this right and and the I\nhonestly think the antidote to\nnarcissism is humility and humility\nmeans we're not perfect we have flaws\nand it and we are and it's not all a\nfantasy and that we're and honestly the\nhardest thing for a narcissistic person\nto accept is that they're ordinary we\nyou're ordinary I'm ordinary everyone in\nthis room is ordinary and we're\nsimultaneously special but we're just\npeople right and so if that for them not\nto be the most special person means\nremoving the camp off the volcano which\nis terrifying for them in if in a way\nthey're almost terrified by their own\nrage you need one very skilled therapist\nto guide someone through that Journey\nyou know and so and they have to keep\nshowing up and for about almost 60 to\n70% of narcissistic folks drop out of\ntherapy prematurely and it usually\nhappens when the rubber meets the road\nand the work starts getting really\nvulnerable that's when I've lost clients\nand so we have to go very very gently\ninto that forest with them and but\nunfortunately if we go too gently and we\nnever get there then we're sort of doing\na lot of Naval gazing so it's just\nfinding that kind of balance and and and\nyou know they can do a lot of spiritual\nbypassing that kind of stuff like you\nyou can't just you can't aphorism your\nway through this you're G to have to do\nthis painful work face up to that\nvulnerability that's I I've seen some\nnarcissistic people make a little bit of\nprogress but the way I put it is this\nThere's Hope for them to make some\nprogress but the harm they've usually\ndone to another person usually it's not\nsuper it's not really that fixable and\nso many people will say and a fear of a\nlot of people in narcissistic\nrelationships is what if they change for\nthe next person they're not going to\nchange for the next person right what if\nthey what if it all changes overnight\nthis is not an overnight this is years\nand years years and years of committed\nwork to this like I said I've seen micro\nchanges and not enough to have probably\nconsistently affected other people's\nrelationships and they still personality\nis like a rubber band we can pull it out\nso all of a sudden Romany the introvert\ncould become Romney the extrovert for\none night only and then when we get home\nthe rubber band will go back to its side\nthe narcissistic person on a good day\nwith a good therapist might get\nstretched out a little bit seem a little\nbit more tuned aware do some empathic\nadjacent things but as soon as the first\ntime stress comes into the picture\nrubber band goes back to its original\nsize yeah that's what I was going to ask\nyou as as the last question that came\nfrom that was what would you say to\nsomeone who says I'll wait for them to\nchange you then you're waiting for a bus\nthat's never going to come you're\nwaiting for a submarine to show up at a\nbus stop basically and and in the\nprocess it's not even just as that may\nnot come you will lose yourself in the\nprocess and to me that sort of Soul\ndeath that sort of loss of self is it's\nit's just not okay and and listen you\nand I both know this cultur we both come\nfrom a culture where remaining in a\nmarriage no matter what the conditions\nare is very much a sort of a symptom of\nthe culture and this is where I've\nprobably seen it most pointedly of\npeople who really some folks would find\na way whether through their spirituality\nor other relationships with their\nchildren or others in their Community to\nsort of create a meaningful space\noutside of that problem atic\nrelationship but others it was like\nwatching a fruit die on the vine and\nit's to me one of the most horrific\nthings to witness is the potential of a\nhuman being being lost to this to this\nkind of invalidation and I shudder to\nthink how much potential creative\npotential um knowledge wisdom that\npeople have held back because it\ninvalidated this book is a love story to\nevery Survivor and saying to them please\nbring we need you we we need all of your\ngifts in this world because you have so\nmany listen the fact that you endured\nthis relationship is already a gift but\nso all the stuff you kept behind the\ngate open those Gates so we can see all\nthis beautiful stuff that you could\nbring into the world
