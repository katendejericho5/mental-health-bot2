    "transcript": "live our life as other people view us so\nfor example on this podcast I may be\nthinking how am I going to sit in a way\nwhere I'm going to look the most\nflattering and how am I going to like\nmove my body in a way where maybe they\ndon't get the bad side of me and so\nyou're constantly living through other\npeople's perception of you essentially\nobjectifying yourself and so I feel like\nhaving a better relationship with food\nhas allowed me to care less about those\nthings and and live from inside out\nrather than outside in"
