than\n125 plant-based recipes and it's all\nabout cooking effortlessly eating freely\nand living radiantly obviously I don't\nthink I've ever wanted you to get a book\nmore than this one even more than my\nbooks this is the most important book\nthat I want you to get this year please\ngo and grab a copy we put the link in\nthe caption in the comments wherever you\nare right now go and order joyful\nwelcome to the show my amazing wife and\nthe love of my life Rad deia Rad thanks\noh my God you're so professional doing\nthis I mean we've been doing it for a\nbit it was better than the first time\nyou came on like five years ago this is\namazing thanks for that intro really\nappreciate it much I'm genuinely so\nproud of you like looking at this book\nand obviously I've had the inside track\nof watching you work on this book for\nthe last three years I know the amount\nof energy the amount of effort the\namount of love\nthe amount of devotion that's g into\nthis book is amazing and it's so\nbeautiful and for those of you that\ndon't know when you do get it you can\ntake off this part even though R's face\ntake my face off you can take my\nfavorite part off and look how beautiful\nthis is yeah I made it that way stunning\nstunning book I wanted people to be able\nto have a coffee table book but also\nknow that it's my cookbook but um I like\nthe part where you can just take my face\noff and leave it on your table for\nlittle surprises\ninside uh I have so many questions for\nyou because even though I've seen you\nwork on this book I find that when you\nget inside someone's mind and heart you\nunderstand so much more about what\nthey've created and even though I've\nwatched you from the outside I don't\nalways know all the inside so I want to\ndive straight in and one of the things I\nlove about this book is the beautiful\npictures you have with your family your\nba who's your grandma your mom your dad\nI'm in it as well of course I got one\npicture uh but what I love is that your\nfamily have been such big Inspirations\nfor you in your cooking journey and I\njust wanted to go through your grandma\nmom sister family dad like you know just\nthe people in your life that have\ninspired you and I wanted to know what\nhave you learned from each of them or\nwhat have you gained from each of them\nin your cooking journey I would say that\nbecause one both of us gr up in an\nIndian family food is literally always\nhas been and always will the center of\neverything whether it's celebrations\nwhether it's making sure that we eat\ndinner every single day together and so\nI think I've learned to form connections\nthrough eating because of having grown\nup with it that is my place where I feel\nI can connect to someone the most when\nwe're sharing you know a delicious meal\nor a nice dessert together um and so\nthere's that but also you know both our\nmoms had full-time jobs growing up but\nshe still managed to make breakf like\nhomemade breakfast lunch and dinner\nevery sing single day and so watching\nher do that for us with so much love and\nalso eating her food and feeling her\nlove through the food I think my deep\nconnection with food comes purely\nthrough that to having experienced that\nfrom her my grandma's the same she\npassed everything down to my mom in that\nway my mom was cooking with my grandma\nfrom the age of like 12 and she gets her\nlove for it from her as well and so I\ndefinitely think that it feels like\nsomething generational that's been\npassed down into me my dad my dad is\nsomeone who you know my dad he's so\nquiet he's so sweet and whenever my mom\nwould go away for work or anything he\nwould always step in and be someone who\nhe wouldn't be like let's just order out\nhe would find something he could make\nmac and cheese really well so my dad's\nmac and cheese is in the cookbook that's\nlike my one memory of growing up when my\nmom would go away he would make this mac\nand cheese and we the one time we'd get\nto sit in front the TV and eat and we'd\neat mac and cheese and sit in front of\nthe TV and so I really I feel like I\nmean which is the same as everyone I'm\nsure I I could not have created this\nbook without all of the inspiration that\nI've got from them like all the recipes\nare so inspired by where we're from like\nfrom India from our heritage of things\nthat we've grown up eating and then my\nmom and all the things that I feel like\nare my comfort Foods when I think about\nher and so actually a lot of the recipes\nare connected to memories and things\nthat I can I can make and then feel the\nlove and the energy of the person that I\nate it with or that I cooked it with or\nthat cooked it for me it's completely\nweaved and and just created through\nfamily like that is what the book is\nabout and that is that is what I hope\npeople feel when they read it yeah no it\ncomes across and it's so beautiful\nbecause you see all of those influences\nand all of those energies that come in\nand one of the most interesting things\nabout you is that you obviously trained\nas a nutritionist and then a dietician\nboth of your degrees and then you've\nbecome an ayurvedic health counselor and\nstudied irasa as a big part of your\nLearning Journey and I know you consider\nyourself a continuous student and\nwanting to develop those skills but walk\nme through how those two things have\nimpacted your understanding of food I\nstarted off doing my degree as a\nnutritionist and a dietitian and so then\nI was working in hospitals where I was\nseeing everything from diabetes clinics\nto the elderly who are malnourish to um\nlittle children like pediatric clinics\ntrying to get little fussy eaters to eat\na little bit more and so I actually\nloved working in that environment I\nloved being someone who could be patient\nfacing seeing them every week trying to\nsee their progress and feeling like I\nhad a direct impact to them but the only\npart I kind of struggled with was\nnaturally when you're part of a system\nyou have to recommend what the system\nrecommends and so that was a bit\ndifficult for me because I always wanted\nto be food forward versus supplements or\num you know some anything in a bottle um\nbut but sometimes that's not you know\nthe easiest or most efficient way and so\nI definitely loved it but I felt there\nwas a slight disconnect and then when we\nmoved to New York I threw myself back\ninto study and I found ayurveda and for\nanybody who doesn't know what ayva is a\nmeans life V means knowledge and it's\nbasically the science of life and it as\nsoon as I learned about it it clicked\neverything felt like it made complete\nsense and it would it felt just like\nwhen you go to a place and it feels like\nhome when I learned about areda I felt\nlike I'd found my home in the practices\nand the rituals and the understanding of\nmy body the differences between the two\nwere incredible like you know Western\nmedicine and Western healing is all\nabout Curative like you get to the point\nof disease and then let's figure out how\nto cure it whereas in ayurveda it's all\nabout how can we start understanding our\nbody how can we start noticing the\nsymptoms the things our body is trying\nto tell us and how do we tunee into that\nso that we catch everything a few steps\nbefore disease so we can actually have\nan opportunity to prevent it and on top\nof that it's so individual like a lot of\nthe time with Western medicine it's one\nsize fits all um and I really appreciate\nso much of Western medicine the\nDiagnostics like how we're able to\nfigure things out through so many\nsystems that we have but the one thing\nwe kind of lack is this individual\nnature of the way you eat a tomato which\nwe know you eat a tomato and I eat a\ntomato whenever I make a meal it affects\nyou so differently to me and so I love\nthe individual nature of healing our\nbody as me like not what this person\nonline is telling me not what this book\nis telling me but let me observe and be\nan active participant in my health every\nsingle day so that when I eat something\nI'm not eating this salad because this\nperson told me it was the best thing for\ntheir body I know I'm eating it because\nit's the best thing for my body and I\nfeel it through the way my body feels\nthrough how my digestion is yeah those\nare like a couple of differences that I\nfound and then I just started learning\nmore and more about this holistic\npractice and start practicing it so now\nI know how it feels and I can share it\nwith other people having practiced and\nlived it I love that point that you just\nmade about being an active participant\nin how you feel yeah and I didn't start\nwith this but I wanted to say it now\nsadly you had to give up all those\npatience and everyone you worked with to\nonly have one patient and that person's\nbeen me for the last eight years that\nyou've been ing me and you've been my\nhealth coach and my health Guru and you\nhave helped me with so many things\nwhether it was really working on my\nsugar addiction working on my addiction\nto soft drinks fizzy drinks what do they\ncall them here sodas so many things I\nhad that I thought I'd figured out so I\nloved meditating and reading and working\non the mind but I didn't want to\nphysically work out I didn't care about\nthe body and you helped me understand\nthat you probably switch my sleep\nschedule around I thing when we met I\nwas someone who could sleep a lot later\nand now I sleep really really early and\nthat was a big part of what you changed\nand all of those have made me feel\nhealthier and happier every single year\nbecause you've helped me build these\nhabits and I just want to add none of\nthat was done through Force none of that\nwas done through telling me what to do\nbut you were always patiently coaching\nand guiding me as in how I showed\nenthusiasm or what I wanted to learn and\nso what I love about this book is that\nyou've taken all of that and you've now\nmade it accessible to anyone who wants\nto change their habits and that's what's\nso amazing about this book it's not a\ncookbook in that yes it does have 125\nrecipes and it does have it does have\nrecipe it is a cookbook guys it is a\ncookbook but it really has all of these\nday-to-day guides on habits and how to\nchange your rituals and your morning\nroutine and your evening routine and\npractices with food and with without\nthat improve your life and so as someone\nwho's being a recipient of your coaching\nand of your guidance I'm so excited that\neveryone gets to have this now through\njoyful you've been such a good student I\nfeel like I haven't even had it hasn't\nreally been you being a student you've\nalways wanted to make yourself better in\nsome way and I think that's the\ndifference right like you can we know\nthis from having parents and you know\nhaving different teachers in our life\nthat I've learned best through observing\nsomeone or experiencing how amazing they\nare through the practices that they've\ndone and so when I was writing the book\nI knew I wanted it to come from a place\nof love and knowledge because I think\nthat is the place where people learn the\nbest and make make sustainable change\nit's like I can tell people that eating\na certain way is terrible for you and\nyou're going to die early and like\nwhatever it is that you know you could\nsay to really scare someone into it but\nthat just makes them either want to hide\nfrom themselves or it makes them want to\ncurl up into a ball and kind of be like\nI need to ignore this because this is\ntoo much information and it's\noverwhelming and I do think what you\nsaid about you know me teaching you you\nwere an active participant in your\nhealth and I think that is actually the\nkey like for me I've intertwined I said\nwhen I first wrote this cookbook I was\nlike I do not want it to just be a\ncookbook I love sharing food with people\nit is my love language but what I want\nmore is food is just one aspect like we\nall know food is just one pillar of our\nhealth and then to be able to intertwine\nthroughout your day all of these micro\nthese micro habits that create such\nMajor Impact and that's what it did for\nme like one of the things in there is\nbreath work and I think about this so\nmuch and I just took a deep breath now\nbecause breath has honestly saved me\nfrom being someone who has mass anxiety\ngoing into things that I find so\ndifficult and by the way not even\ndifficult things things that I find\ndifficult so going into events where\nthere's lots of people being coming on\nto interviews and speaking in places\nwhere I don't have full control over it\nlike having all those M minor things\nwhich actually impacted me so much\nbreath work has been the one thing\nthat's allowed my mind to slow down for\nme to collect my thoughts um for me to\nenergize myself in the afternoon for me\nto help relax me in the evening and so\nI've shared breath Works to like really\ntake people through their day to to\ntackle and and handle everything that\ncomes our way and so from breath work to\nthe way that we eat and the way that\nconnect to our food all of that helps us\ncreate more joyful moments throughout\nthe day and the more joyful moments you\nhave throughout the day the more joy you\nend up with every single day like it it\naccumulates throughout the day I want to\ndive into some things in the book now\nbecause I want to give people a sense of\nhow this cookbook is shaped and curated\nin order to help people and I wanted to\nstart off by asking you this question\nabout the modes because you break down\nthe modes as like a big part of your\nbook and you talk about the three could\nyou walk us through these three modes\nand how we think about food when it\ncomes to these three yeah so the three\nmodes in areda essentially they the um\nenergies of the world of everything that\nwe eat of everything that exists\nexternally and internally and so there's\nthe mode of goodness the mode of passion\nand the mode of ignorance and so I've\nspoken about it in the sense of our\nlifestyle and our food that's how I\nfocused it in the book and so mode of\ngoodness are basically foods which make\nyou feel good like on a basic level it's\nfoods that nourish you deeply that that\nnourish your body that that are filled\nwith Prana now Prana is life force and\nwhat that means is um having the most\namount of Vitality and energy in that in\nthat produce and so a simple way to\nexplain it would be you pick an apple\nfrom the tree at that point that Apple\nhas the most amount of nutrient value it\nhas the most amount of life and it it's\njust been taken from the tree it has you\nknow the most it's the most abundant in\nthat form and then you take it home and\nyou leave it out for a couple of days\nand you leave it out and slowly slowly\nthe quality externally starts getting\nbad you see these brown spots that come\nup um and then slowly it starts getting\nmushy inside and so the thing is you\ncould eat something in its purest form\nor it can end up degrading and becoming\nsomething which can move through the mo\ndown to something that's no longer\nbeneficial for you but the point is\ntrying to eat the most amount of foods\nthat that form within this that fall\nwithin this mode of goodness and so the\ntypes of foods would be fresh fruits\nvegetables grains beans um you know like\navocados and like just all the foods\nthat come from a fresh natural place and\nso if you possibly can by organic way\nyou can the less chemicals the less um\nthings that are put onto your foods that\nare unnatural the better and then LIF\nstyle wise mode of goodness are again\nthe things that don't just make you feel\ngood in the moment but actually bring\ngoodness to your life long term and so a\nlot of the time we mistake our temporary\njoys for things which are good for us I\nthink is learning how to differentiate\nthe two so you know that for me when I'm\neating um a sugary donut in the moment\nit brings me joy and sometimes that's\ngreat but actually in the long term it\nmay ruin my sleep it may make me listen\nalgic in the morning and so the foods\nthat actually bring energy and good\ndigestion all the things that make your\nbodily systems feel good those are the\nfoods in the mode of goodness and also\nthe activities are the same um and then\nwhen you get to the mode of passion so\nall those foods that you eat that give\nyou immediate gratification so the sour\nthe salty the um the chili all the\nthings that you would put into your food\nto create that kind of burst of flavor\ninto it those are still okay to have but\nagain in moderation mode of goodness\nbeing the larger amounts of foods and\nactivities that you do mode of passion\nwill be a really intense workout that\ngets you sweating and you're like oh at\nthe end of it you know it really gets\nyour aggression out so that's a mode of\npassion activity and the foods would be\nwhat I just said like chilies and sour\nfoods and spices that are really intense\nand they have their place as well of\ncourse they do all of these have their\nplace by the way they all have their\nplace but as we go down you have to have\nless and less of those foods and then um\nthe last one is mod of ignorance and\nthose are the foods that essentially\nmake your body feel lifeless and\nlethargic and make your digestion feel\nsluggish um and those type of foods end\nup being foods which are deep fried\nbecause it's so dense and heavy in oil\nleftovers foods that have gone bad in\nthe fridge that have been there for a\nlong time basically food that have lost\ntheir life and um according to IA also\nmeat and and foods which no longer have\nlife in them like animals that have have\ndied and then they they no longer have\nthat vitality and so yeah it's just\nbeing mindful about all the things that\nfit into those mes and how they're\naffecting you and it's not just on our\nbody it has the ability to affect our\nmind and our Consciousness too because\neverything carries energy so whatever\nenergy that food has when we're\ndigesting it it's also assimilating into\nour blood and then our bones and then\nour entire being and so it can also\naffect our mind so a lot of the foods in\nthose\ncategories they also will affect our\nmind in the same way they affect our\nbody and I love this because I know\nyou've done this for yourself before you\nkeep and I've been you've recommended it\nfor me to do as well is doing like a\nfood di or a food audit for a week and\nactually just testing it out because I\nthink sometimes we don't realize how\nsubconsciously some of these things work\nand how subtly they work and if you\nhadn't taught me in how to spot these\nthings where it's like well did you\nsleep badly oh wait a minute what did\nyou eat the night before right often we\nthink it's so mental but so often it is\nphysical it is biological it is to do\nwith what you consumed yeah we've I\nthink we've tuned out of our body so\nmuch you know when they say about your\nown inner voice of when your inner voice\nwhen you've got too many voices that you\nhave allowed to be louder and louder\naround you your inner voice becomes you\nknow quiet or it becomes dampen in the\nsame way our inner cues our inner\nintuition about our own body we kind of\nend up using that because we're\nconstantly hearing avocados are amazing\nfor you so you end up being an avocado\nevery day even if it's making your tummy\nfeel bad these salads are amazing for\nyou so then you end up eating those\nsalads and slowly your body is screaming\nat you well first of all it starts to\nwhisper and it's like oh it's a bit I\nfeel a bit uncomfortable and then you\nignore it and then you're like oh my\nskin is breaking out and or I'm losing\nmy hair or you know your external\nsymptoms start to come and still you're\nlike it's nothing to do with my food you\nknow I'm going to keep eating this and\nso you slowly slowly stop quietening\nyour own bodily cues that you completely\nstart to deteriorate your body just\nbecause you've stopped listening to it\nand then your body stops communicating\nto you and if it does it will scream at\nyou until your body gets to the point of\nbreaking down you get IBS or you you end\nup getting gut issues you end up getting\nskin issues and so we don't seem to be\nable to catch ourselves in the point of\noh I'm feeling a little bit\nuncomfortable today I wonder what it was\nthat made me feel uncomfortable and so\nthe diary is really important because if\nyou do with any physical you know\nproblems at the moment digestive issues\nwhatever start doing the Diary of this\nis what I ate and this is how it made me\nfeel 2 to three hours after that's\nusually how long it will start taking to\ndigest your food and then start pairing\nthat up with okay this didn't make me\nfeel good so I'm going to cut that out\nand let me see how I feel it's a process\nof elimination and it does take a little\nbit of work but it makes such a\ndifference because then you're not then\nyour body will start talking to you a\nlittle bit more the more you listen to\nit yeah it's like what I told you last\nnight where where I've been exercising\nI've been meditating I've been feeling\nreally great I've been sleeping really\nwell and then for the past four nights\nI've just had such a busy schedule that\nmy morning routine evening routine\neverything went out of whack and then\nlast night I was like I just need to eat\nsugar and I know exactly why and I was\nlike I literally haven't turned to it\nwhereas last night I literally weeks\nyeah for three weeks I was I had no\nrefined sugars and I was absolutely fine\nbut then the last four nights my\nschedule was crazy and so last night\nordered a chocolate fudge cake a turiso\nand had a scoop of ice cream and it was\namazing and I'm really happy I did it\nbut at the same time I noticed why I was\ncraving it because for three and a half\nweeks I've not craved it at all and\nagain I'm not making I'm not trying to\nfood Shain people or make people feel\nbad I I really enjoyed that food that I\nhad last night but it was a recognition\nof how much my body didn't need that\nwhen I was doing all these other things\nand how much I resorted to it as well\nyeah well it's a wrecking you have no\nnotice what your triggers are for\nwanting foods that are just there to\ngive you a hit that you need and so you\nalready know that when I have lack of\nsleep when I don't have time to rest\nwhen I don't get my weekends when um I'm\ngoing from one thing to another to\nanother slowly it's deteriorating me and\nthen I get to that point and so um I\nthink what you've done is you've\nrecognized it so you know where you're\nleading you know where you're going and\nthen you'll have to you know you have\nyour sugar dose which is fine like\neverybody loves having a little bit of\nsomething but the fact that you're able\nto recognize that the I know this is\ngoing to happen like this is what's\ngoing to it's going to lead to if I\ncontinue down this road yeah Donuts\ntonight yeah\ndefinitely I wanted to dive in there's\nsomething beautiful that you did in your\nbook and I thought these were really\nwell written and explained and super\nunique as well and things that I don't\nhear people talk about all the time so I\nwanted to dive into it you have nine\ntips for living joyfully and the reason\nI wanted to ask you about some of these\nmy favorite ones is because I think\nthey're underestimated and they have a\nhuge impact on the food we eat and so\nI'm just going to pick some of the ones\nthat I like so number two is called eat\nuntil satisfied not stuffed and I was\nthinking that until I met you I\ndefinitely believed that I would eat\ntill my limit yeah and now I'm like\nwanting to know what's made and how much\nthere is and everything else but walk us\nthrough why it's important to eat until\nsatisfied not stuffed yeah in ARA it\nsays that you should eat until you\nthree4 satisfied not full and so what\nthat means is not getting yourself to\nthe point so there's such a fine line\nbetween eating enough to fuel our body\nand then eating so much that it then\nmakes us feel drowsy lethargic\nafterwards and so learning what those\ncues are for your body is really\nimportant and so it's easier for our\nbody to digest when we haven't over\nstuffed like think of your stomach as\nlike a uh a furnace where you constantly\nkeep putting things on top and so\nnaturally there's only a certain amount\nof digestive juices that are flowing in\nyour digestive system so it's like it\nproduces enough for the amount that you\nshould be eating and then you end up\noverdoing it and overwhelming it where\nyour digestive juices aren't actually\nallowed or arable to digest everything\nthat's in there so then what happens is\nyour food remains undigested your\nundigested food ends up fermenting in\nyour stomach you then get gut discomfort\nyou then feel a bit slothy after your\nmeals you feel bloated feel bloated so\nthen those those Foods end up fermenting\nproducing toxins in the body then you\nstart getting headaches and just feeling\nreally groggy or then you're like I\nwonder why I feel this way I just ate a\nfull meal I felt energized but for I I\nthought I would get energy from it but\ninstead it's made me feel worse and so\nthe three4 full thing is you will know\nwhen you've eaten too much when you\ninstead of feeling energized by the meal\nyou're eating you feel the opposite you\nfeel lethargic you feel um under the\nweather you feel groggy and so that's a\ngood indication to you that maybe you've\neither eaten the wrong Foods or most\nlikely you've eaten a little bit too\nmuch and so the way to actually make\nsure you do that is conscious eating and\nlike mindfully eating because the fact\nis when you're distracted you've got a\nburrito in one hand you're typing on the\nother you're talking to people on like\nyou're all over the place so what\nhappens is when you end up um eating\nyour food you haven't yet prepped your\nbody to say hey by the way food's coming\nand so when your body knows that by the\nway you may not have even looked at what\nyou're eating food start your digestion\nstarts as soon as you look at food\nthat's the beginning of when our\ndigestive juices start flowing our\ntongue knows to produce the enzymes it\nneeds to start you know digesting the\nfood from the mouth and so when you\ndon't give it enough notice you start\neating and your body's like oh I wasn't\nready to digest all this food and so the\ntaking looking at the food you know\nhaving a prayer of gratitude just before\nyou eat a second with the food to tell\nyour body food is coming to nourish you\nnow then taking a bite slowly eating it\nyou'll notice that when you eat slow\nslowly and by the way I don't mean you\nhave to Long out your meal for like an\nhour it's just taking bite at a time\ninstead of eating a bite before the last\nbite's finished um when you do that\nyou'll notice oh I actually only made it\nthrough like 3/4s of this burrito and\nactually I feel actually great like this\nthis feels good for me this feels like\nenough um whereas if you eat that fast\nyour body doesn't even get to tell you\noh okay I'm stuffed now until it's too\nlate absolutely and then the next one\nthat you were kind of leading on to is\nthis idea of chewing your food like the\nimportance of that but before I do that\nI want to talk about the one you just\nsaid like I think it's so so so\ninteresting to hear about how the\ndigestive process starts like until I\nmet you I'd never heard that in my\nentire life of oh wait a minute my body\nactually has to be ready to eat but that\nactually makes so much sense it's like\nwhen you go to a restaurant you order\nwhat you want and then they have to\nprepare it yeah and then you're being\nprepared to eat it but we almost want\nour body to respond like technology\nwhere it's like on off like do this now\ndo that now and it's almost like well no\nyour body needs to through the scent\nthrough the sight through as everything\nelse like needs to actually feel ready\nand that's such a powerful point it's\nsuch an important point it's like when\nyou put a kettle on to boil water like\neverything takes a little bit of time\nand our body is a system like it takes a\nsecond to gear up just like when it's\nrested for eight hours at night and then\nsuddenly you're waking up and you're\nthrowing in your coffee and you're\nthrowing in all this heavy food and your\nbody's like oh my gosh I just got up\ngive me a second it's like someone's\nscreaming at you when you're waking up\nand so that's how our body feels\ntoo chewing your food chewing your food\noh okay so I have this memory of my D my\ngranddad every time we would sit down\nfor a meal he would be remind all of us\nyou have to chew I think it was like 32\nor like some 32 times like chew your\nfood and so everyone would have to sit\nthere chewing their food like 32 times\nyou don't have to do it 32 times that's\nlike the recommended amount because the\nfact is the more you digest in your\nmouth which is what our teeth are for\nthe more that you break it down the less\nwork our stomach has to do so if you're\neating food even if it's small even if\nit's big it's like our teeth were made\nto break down the food our tongue was\nmade to release the enzymes to break it\ndown you skip that part your stomach's\ndoing double the work than it needs to\nchewing your food so if you're having\ndigestive issues one of the simplest\nthings you could do is chew your food a\nlittle bit better because if your\ndigestive juices or your gut is a little\nbit weaker it's going to find it even\nharder to break things down so whether\nit's raw foods you know sometimes cooked\nfoods you can get away with soups you\ncan get away with of course but the\nthings you have to really pay attention\nto chewing more are the things with\nroughage around it so like more fiber\naround it the beans um salads when\nyou're eating salads especially chew it\nwell so that it gets broken down I I\nmean that's such a simple yet huge point\nI know as as someone who eats very fast\nand you've slowed me down so much but I\nalways found that I had to eat quick\nbecause when I worked in the corporate\nworld you didn't really get a lunch and\nso you'd quickly eat and you didn't want\nto be seen eating because you always\nbeing judged for not working hard enough\nand so I got into this habit of like\neating really really quick and what I\nrealized was yes I could eat quick but\nit's exactly what you said I wasn't\nchewing my food properly obviously I'm\nthen getting cramps or feeling bloated\nor whatever else it may be and you don't\nfeel good and now you're not working or\nyou're not alert at work not feeling\ngreat anymore true and so it sounds so\nsimple but that ability to chew your\nfood effectively and I love what you\nsaid about how the stomach's doing\ndouble the work again we don't look at\nour body as a system and so we don't\nrecognize that oh that's what's putting\npressure on my stomach and that's why\nI'm feeling pain because I could have\neaten food that's good for me but I'm\nnot chewing it I'm not breaking it down\ny exactly yeah I love that one okay I'm\npicking some more cuz these nine methods\nof eating joyfully are living joyfully\nare brilliant so that's a couple of them\nI wanted to pick a few more this one was\nintriguing to me because you put eat and\ncook with your hands yes you know I mean\nin our culture in Indian culture and in\nmany of Eastern Traditions you eat with\nyour hands and again that's another way\nit's another sign to your body because\nwe've gotten used to holding metal\nthings so our body doesn't actually know\nit could think that we're about to saw\nsomething it could think that we're\nabout to write something you know\nthere's no connection it's it's dead\nmaterial that you're holding on to and\nso you start cutting your food up and\nyour your body's looking at it but it\ndoesn't quite understand like so I can\nsee the food but I can't touch the food\nand then suddenly you put it into your\nmouth and it's like oh we're eating now\nso our hands have nerves and as soon as\nthey start feeding the food um you know\neven with children if you think about it\ntouch and texture is such an important\npart of your body recognizing what\nyou're doing and so that's just another\nindication to your body that you are\nabout to eat um and also a connection to\nfood again we have such a disconnect to\nthe food that we're eating it doesn't\nkind of allow you to do anything else\nyour hands are a little bit dirty you're\nconnecting with the food that you're\neating um and so one it removes\ndistraction and you doing other things\nand two it just allows you to reconnect\nback to the food that you're eating it\nhelps when your hands are a cooking pan\nlike you can hold really you can hold\nreally hot\nlike I'm I'll literally throw something\ninto the air and you'll just be like sat\nstanding there going what is your issue\nyeah my mom calls him es asbestos hands\nI don't know what that means but she's\nalways called it that I think it's like\na thing when they were younger like espo\nbut um my mom has it to I think it's\njust a cook thing you just get like numb\nat the at the uh tips of your fingers\nyou just pick anything up uh one more\nthat I wanted to focus out of all of\nthese like I said there's nine I'm just\npicking some of my favorites was and\nthis one I think is a big one for people\nand this one was a big one for me avoid\ncold drinks and iced beverages this is\none that whenever I've shared it with\npeople who have had gut issues without\nfail they've said oh my God my gut has\nchanged so much since I stopped drinking\ncold drinks Game Changer and the reason\nis your body when it is starting to eat\nis creating heat like if you think about\na furnace you think about a fire for it\nto burn something our digestion is like\na fire it needs Heat heat so there's\nyour body trying to build up this heat\nand and take all its energy towards your\nstomach and then you're\ngoing and then dampening the fire\ndampening the fire over and over again\nas your body's just heating up the acids\nare just building up and then you're\nlike oh let me dilute the acids and let\nme dampen the fire the digestive fire\nthat's happening one part of it is the\ncold drink like the cold part of it\nthat's dampening the fire and the other\npart is too much liquid when you're\neating is diluting your digestive juices\nwhat's recommended is like a half a cup\nof warm water or some a warm tea that\nyou can maybe with some spices for your\ndigestion um drinking that slowly sip at\na time as you're eating your food and\nthen like half an hour after or half an\nhour before you can if you really want\nyou can drink a drink yeah yeah no it's\nsuch a and it's so common right like I\ngrew up in a house where I would have a\ncan of sprite yeah chilled right next to\nmy meal Pizza yeah fries whatever else\nit may be and you get so used to it or\nlike you know we have a friend who will\njust put loads of ice into water when\nthey're just about to have their meal\nand it's so normal it's a normal part of\nculture yeah but it's not necessarily\ngood for you yeah which is the same as\neverything that we see it's like there's\nso much just because it's the most\ncommon thing to do doesn't mean it's the\nright thing to do for us yeah absolutely\nabsolutely and and so those were some of\nmy favorites like I said there's so many\nmore but I thought those were so unique\nand I'd never heard them anywhere before\nI've obviously learned them through you\nbut they're so simple and what I love\nabout them is you don't need to you\ndon't need to learn a new skill you\ndon't need to develop a new habit these\nare things that you can start practicing\nright now yeah what else you learn from\nmy book H I wanted to ask you about I\nmean I learned a lot from your book but\nI learned it from you and now the book\nis going to help lots of people so I\nthink one of the biggest things for\npeople these days is a lot of people are\nmissing meals yeah and skipping meals\nand often what ends up happening is then\nyour first real meal is dinner like your\nfirst real meal like substantial meal\nand naturally we end up overeating or we\nend up you know we're trying to get all\nthe nutrients from that meal what's your\ntake on skipping meals and how does that\naffect us and what can we do if we find\nthat to be a pattern in our lives yeah\num I would say that you know it's it's a\nvery specific thing to your body type\nand you will know just by doing it\nwhether you are the body type that can\ntake it or not I have a body type where\nI can not eat in the morning till I've\nworked out I work out on empty stomach I\nthen will have my meal maybe at like 10\n11:00 I I will Fast for a long period of\ntime and my body thrives off it you with\nyour body type your digestion is so\nstrong and fiery and your body type is\nsuch that you have to have your meals on\ntime when you wake up you're ready to\neat you're hungry by the afternoon like\nclockwork you are hungry like every meal\nhas to be at the right time otherwise\nyou feel that negative effect you feel\nyour stomach getting acidic like you\nfeel all those effects right and so I\nwould say you really need to I mean I\nknow I wish I could give a direct answer\nbut that would be that would be wrong um\nyou have to see if when I am waking up\nand if I'm hungry straight away your\ndigestive system is ready to eat if\nyou're waking up and you're like I could\ngo another 3 hours without eating test\nout test that out for yourself and so\nthere are certain body types where\nespecially if you're quite a slim build\nyou lose weight quite often quite easily\nyou generally are quite ravenous and and\nhungry all the time you probably need to\nbe having your meals regularly and if\nyour digestion is suffering when you\ndon't that's an indication that you need\nmore regular meals for me if I end up\nskipping a meal my body actually is is\ngood with fasting and it and it actually\nfeels better sometimes and less\nlethargic when I do do that so sometimes\nI will last off like two meals and I'll\nbe okay with it but I think um yeah\nthere's there's so much where it's like\nintimate and fasting is amazing and then\nsomeone does it and they're like I felt\nawful but like they said it works for me\nbut I feel so bad doing it then don't do\nit it's not for your body type the\nactive participant thing keeps coming up\nin my mind but it is work to figure out\nyourself just like when you're figuring\nout your partner and you're figuring out\nyou know your relationship with them\nyour body is the same it's waiting for\nyou to listen and learn from it and and\nit will tell you what it needs yeah and\nI I think what's been my personal\nexperience is that when you don't listen\nto these smaller initial warnings the\nbody just gets louder and harder and\nharsher and we think there's something\nwrong with our body when actually your\nbody's been doing the right thing all\nalong which is telling you to be an\nactive participant and listen to me it's\nlike your partner that just gets louder\nand louder and louder if you're not\nlistening or your alarm clock gets\nlouder and louder and louder when you're\nnot listening you're not waking up yeah\nexactly and so your body's trying to get\nyou to do the same yeah yeah all right\none question I want to ask you is on a\nbusy day what's one practice you can\nImplement to make sure you slow down\nwhat's one thing you do and one thing\npeople could do cuz I feel like eating\nfast it sounds like drinking fast we we\ndo a lot of things fast and that seems\nto cause a lot of issues for me because\nas you know my mind the way I talk\neverything is quite this and then this\nand then this and I'm all over the place\nand so I can relate to being someone\nwho's very fast minded and constantly\nfeeling like I'm all over the place I\nhave to just say breath work again\nbreath before you eat take three breaths\nbefore you go into something that you're\nworried about take three breaths like\nreally feel deep breaths going into your\nbody because we take such shallow\nbreaths your breath is the anchor\nbetween your mind and your body it\nbrings you back into your body it allows\nyou to reconnect with yourself um and so\nit sounds really simple but I guarantee\nyou like take a breath right now like\ntake a breath and feel what happens to\nyour body it automatically slows down\nevery time I've gone from in this\npodcast from where I'm speaking fast\nI've taken a breath and then I slow down\nI've taken a breath and I've slowed down\nand so my cure to having a fast mind and\nhaving the habit of being like that has\nbeen just taking a breath and it's like\nas simple as it gets right like breath\nis is there for you it's it's ready to\nbe used and navigate your emotions your\nday um and and help you in some way if\nyou allow it to yeah definitely it's a\ngreat natural tool that's built into the\nbody yeah in order to help you set a\npace for life oh my God that's so true\nand if you think about it every single\none of your emotions is monitored by\nbreath like when we're nervous and we're\nanxious our breath gets shallower and\nquicker and when we're calm and focused\nour breath becomes deeper and slower and\nwhen we're stressed or we're under\npressure or we're late for something and\nwe're worried our breath gets shallower\nand gets quicker yeah and when you're\nfeeling like you're in the right place\nand you made it on time and all of those\nthings your breath gets deeper and\nslower again and we also I've always\nsaid to people we also say things like\nthat takes my breath away like when\nsomething's really beautiful it's\nbreathaking and we also say things like\nlet me just catch my breath or let me\ntake a breath because it's linked to our\nemotions and so we've learned to realize\nthat our breath changes but we haven't\nlearned to realize we can change our\nbreath and what you've just described is\nyou can choose to change your breath\ntotally in order to feel a way you want\nto feel I completely agree yeah you can\nreally navigate your emotions through it\nlike I think about when I'm crying like\ndepending on how I'm crying my breath\nchanges completely you know if you think\nabout when you see someone really\nintensely crying they're they're\nbreathing so shallow they're feeling so\noverwhelmed and suddenly their breath is\ngetting faster they can't even speak\nbecause they can't you know the they\ncan't catch their breath to actually say\nsomething and so um yeah breath can\nnavigate your emotions your day uh your\nmind\neverything what's something you've\nchanged your mind about this past year\nwhen it comes to your mindset around\nhealth or the way you eat food\nprotein I grew up a vegetarian and um my\nsources of protein being from Indian\nfamily as well was lentils and beans and\num you know those are actually the main\nsources for us and then um when I\nstarted learning more about while I was\nworking out and the amount of protein my\nbody needs you know my book I talk about\nhow the average American I think it was\nsomething like has over 75% more protein\nthan they need so there's one side where\nbecause of the foods that people are\nconsuming they're actually overeating on\nprotein to a point where it can harm\nyour body but then I find where\nvegetarians and if you're plant-based\nyou actually can get the right amount\nthat you need and I've been managing to\ndo that but it does take a little bit\nmore work to get it to navigate and get\nit into your food but I've noticed what\na difference it's made like everything\nfrom hair fall hair shedding I when I\nstarted increasing my protein my hair\nwas shedding less my skin was getting\nbetter um I was feeling more satiated\nand more full in my meals because\nsometimes I realize my meals were\nfocused so much on carbohydrates that\nthey were being digested so fast and I\nwas hungry even though i' had such a\nlarge meal I was still hungry so often\nand then I started introducing protein\nand I could last 3 4 hours 5 hours\nbetween my meals and I felt satiated I\nfeel the same way it's changed right\nit's made such a difference and so um\nyou know some of the for anybody who's\nplant-based or thinking about having\nmore plant-based days and they want want\nprotein I would say Obviously beans and\nlentils are great sources of that but\nthen also you know I kind of want to\ndispel myth around tofu being bad for\nyou because there have been so many\nstudies that have been done yes to say\nthat when you have you know they talk\nabout soy and how it affects your\nhormones and your estrogen levels those\nstudies were done on people who are\nhaving such an excessive amount of of\nsoy it was like imagine having five or\nsix blocks of soy every single day and\nsay blocks you mean I mean like blocks\nof tofu let's say so naturally anything\nin excess not chunks large blocks large\nblocks yeah any anything in excess of\ncourse that's going to cause negative\neffects on your body everything has that\nthere's a there's anything in excess\neven water in excess you can have too\nmuch water and so I would say that if\nyou are Health having a healthy um\nnatural amount of of tofu or sawy in\nyour diet it's not going to affect your\nhormone levels and I mean I'm happy to\nshare the studies at some point you know\nabout about that but I really researched\nit cuz I was scared of it too um so\nsoyer is a great source of it another\ngreat source is is from your nuts and\nyour seeds hemp seeds flax seeds like\nyou know in two tablespoons I think\nthere's nearly like six grams of protein\nnow you may think that's a small amount\nbut you add that into a few dishes every\nsingle day um like throughout the day\nand you can gain so much from it um and\nthen obviously you've got your your uh\nmeat Alternatives which do have that I\ntry to avoid that as much as possible\nand get it from natural means um but\nthere are so many great ways to get\nprotein into your diet and it that that\nfor me this year has been I've really\nbeen focusing on that and it's been a\ngame changer yeah it's amazing I felt\nthe difference as well for sure I think\nit's been huge what's the biggest change\nyou've made in your health Journey that\nhas changed your relationship with food\neating to make my body feel good not\nlook a certain\nway because I realized that you know a\nlot of my book is is to do with the\njourney I've had to go through with food\nwhere I remember when we met I was so\nconscious about the way that I was being\nperceived um and the way my body looked\nthat I would want to eat away that I\nthought made me look better and\nespecially this last year last couple of\nyears I've been trying to improve my\nrelationship with food because I didn't\nrealize how much it was impacted by the\nway I wanted to look versus the way I\nwanted to feel you know a lot of the\nrecipes in this book and a lot of the\nthings that I've shared are helping\npeople to connect back to their body but\ncreate a better relationship to\nunderstand\nthat food like you don't have to choose\nbetween food that um between food that\nmakes you feel good and food that brings\nyou Joy food can be both and you can\nlearn how to do that and the way to cook\nto make it make you feel that way like\nwe normally associate if I want to look\na certain way I have to eat salads and\nthings just leaves and I can't have any\nfun when I'm eating because anything\nthat brings me joy is going to be bad\nfor me like it's going to be something\nthat that doesn't make me look a certain\nway\nbut actually how you feel when you're\neating and how you feel in your life is\nso so feel is so much more satisfying\nwhen you nurture that versus\nconstantly living to figure out how\nyou're going to change the way you live\nexternally both can be true you can want\nto change your external body but at the\nsame time thinking about how is my\ninside feeling too and doing both at the\nsame time is possible and will make you\nfeel so much better I was listening to\nsomething today and it was talking about\nself\nobjectification and it was really\ninteresting because it was talking about\nhow we view ourselves constantly as\nother people view us we live our life as\nother people view us so for example on\nthis podcast I may be thinking how am I\ngoing to sit in a way where I'm going to\nlook the most flattering and how am I\ngoing to like move my body in a way\nwhere maybe they don't get the bad side\nof me and so your con living through\nother people's perception of you\nessentially objectifying yourself and so\nI feel like having a better relationship\nwith food has allowed me to care less\nabout those things and and live from\ninside out rather than outside in does\nthat make sense so powerful yeah it's so\npowerful and that requires so much\ncourage and going against the grain\nbecause society's conditioned us to\nthink a certain way like I remember\nyears and years and years ago I remember\nwalking through a department store and\nthe line above the kind of billboard\nabove the makeup section said get the\nnatural look yeah and and I just found\nthat hilarious because I was like you\nobviously already have the natural look\nI'm not saying there's anything against\nmakeup I have no issues with it I'm I'm\nI'm good with it it's great it's just\nit's interesting how it's being sold to\nus and so we're being convinced that the\nnatural isn't good enough or there's a\nway to be more natural and each their\nown everyone's allowed to do whatever's\nright for them but I think the more we\nlive our life through the lens of will\npeople think I look good like this we'll\nalways be disappointed because there are\nsome people who think you look good and\nsome people who think you don't like we\ntalk about this a lot with fashion like\nI really enjoy fashion yeah but when you\nsee my fashion trites you're like I'm\nnot sure what you're doing mate and and\nthen and then everyone else would think\nit looks great but the point is I'm\ndoing it for myself yeah totally that's\nthe only person that you can ever do it\nfor because it's so hard to win like you\ncould have everyone think you're amazing\nand one person think you're not or the\nother option where everyone thinks\nyou're crazy and one person thinks\nyou're amazing and at the end of day the\none person you need to feel that way is\nyou yeah right that's that's what I'm\nhearing from to and and you kind of Rob\nyourself of experiences like um I was\ntalking to uh Liz Moody I was talking to\nthis guy and she was saying how you know\nwhen you go to the beach and you look\ninto the sea and you see the the sand\nunderneath you and you like you're\nthinking oh I want to go into the ocean\nbut I'm a bit worried about what people\nare going to think about me in this\nswimsuit I've had that I've I've robbed\nmyself of so many experiences we've gone\nto pool parties and I've been like I'm\nnot getting in the pool like just so you\nknow I'm not going to get in the pool\nright now because I don't feel\ncomfortable and I've robbed myself of so\nmany experiences where she was like\nthink about when you're 80 years old and\nyou look back at those experiences and\nyou're are you going to say to yourself\nso glad I didn't get in the pool that\nday because they would have seen my\ncellulite or are you going to think I'm\nso glad I jumped into that ocean and I\nfelt that ocean around me and I created\nthese memories and I felt the sand\nbeneath my feet and I had the experience\nand so I've really been thinking about\nthat a lot more of like having the\nexperience because whenever I've gone\ninto situations where I'm constantly\nconsumed by other people's view of me\nI've not been present I barely remember\nthe event I barely remember where I've\nwhat I've been doing or where I've been\nlike there's so much so such lack of\npresence which doesn't allow me to even\nexperience what I want to um and I feel\nlike that's kind of changed um\nthroughout the time I'm still working on\nit but it's it's definitely um yeah all\nof that fuels into everything like it\nreally it really changed the way I was\neating and connecting to my body too\nyeah I think you've also found this and\nthis is why I'm excited for people to\nget the book is that you've found a way\nto make healthy food really tasty and I\nalways say that to you like I find it so\neasy I'm so lucky to have you and I will\nsay that to everyone when everyone's\nlike oh wow you live a really healthy\nlifestyle I'm like you don't know who\nI'm married to right like and it's and\nnow it's almost like everyone gets to\nhave you in their kitchen through the\nbook where they can also feel that way\nand feeling confident that when you're\ncooking for your family that you don't\nhave to sacrifice taste in order for it\nto be good for you exactly and a big\npart for you with that is is the spices\nand the hers that you talk about so walk\nus through what you're fascinated with\nspices like our nickname for you is\nSpice Girl and because of that like in\nthe actual sense like what walk us\nthrough the value of spices and why they\nmake food flavorful and good for you I'm\nso glad you ask me because it's\nliterally my favorite topic about this\nbook um spices\nhave you know been a part of our life\nour whole life because I remember even\nwhen we were younger I would be I would\nbe coughing and sneezing and my mom\nwould use spices in water to like boil\nboil a tea with spices to help me with\nthat or you know when you get a cut or a\nbruise I parents are getting out this\nturmeric Patty and like putting it onto\nour scabs and you know we grew up with\nthat but I didn't realize the power of\nthem until I started studying the\nmedicinal potency and benefit of them\nand so yes they make your food taste and\nlook vibrant like it's amazing you can\ntake like a humble potato and you can\nmix different spices together and taste\ndifferent parts of the world through\njust the spices you're using so spices\nnot only take you to different parts of\nthe world and help you to experience\ndifferent cultures and Cuisines they\nalso allow you to buy really basic\ningredients and Elevate them and make\nthem feel so different every single day\num and the benefits of spices oh my\ngoodness well you know this for the past\nI don't even know how long 10 years I\nused spices in my medicine box spices\nhave been my go-to if I have a headache\nessential oils and spices if I have a\nheadache what do I go to yeah your\nessential oil my peppermint oil like if\nI have a cough what do I tell you I'm\ngoing to make you a Wayne seeds in water\nlike and I have found when I've allowed\nmy body to rely on natural means to heal\nitself and what I mean by that is like\nthe spices the oils whatever I'm using\nthe food that I'm eating my body's\nimmunity has gotten better and better\nthe way that my body reacts to um being\nin stressful environments has changed\nbecause I've allowed my body to heal\nitself through what I'm actually putting\ninto my body and so I actually have feel\nmy best when over the past few years\nprogressively as I've done that and it's\nso easy because all you have to do is\nthe spices you can buy ground or whole\nor in mixes of Blends that you can just\nadd in you don't have to think about it\nyou can put it into your hot water in\nthe morning my one of my favorite things\nis CCF tea coriander cumin and fennel\ntea easy way if you're not used to using\nspices at all even if you don't cook at\nhome add these three spices in equal\nparts a teaspoon of each into hot water\nbeautiful way to add in spices without\nyou even having to do much and then\nexperiment with your food become like a\nplay in your kitchen I really think you\nknow the book is not prescriptive I\nactually want you to use the book and\nthe recipes to play in the kitchen and\nsub things out and I've got so many\nthings where I'm like if you don't have\nthis use this if you don't have this use\nthis because nothing about food has to\nbe prescriptive and so um spices are a\nreally fun way to do that so yeah one of\nthe huge intentions in goals with my\nbook is for you to have a spice cupboard\nthat is full and and over full by the\ntime you get to n and I've got a chart\nin there to tell you what the benefits\nof them are how you can use them um to\nyour medicinal benefit but also to make\na food taste way better yeah I think\nthat's really important that you've got\nso many charts and graphs and things to\nmake it really easy in the book for\nanyone to understand because a lot of\npeople may be thinking God I've never\nreally used totally that many spices I'm\nnot really aware of them but you've\nactually made that really simple and\naccessible and then I'm like pick a\nspice a week and play with it pick a\nspice a week add it into different\nthings like nutmeg add it into your milk\nyour um your milk at night nutmeg is a\nmild sedative it helps with sleep um in\nthe morning for your digestion you know\nfor centuries Indians have eaten fennel\nseeds after their meal it's a tradition\nyou go to Indian restaurant you go to an\nIndian house they will be passing around\nfennel seeds after their meal that's\nbecause it is amazing for gas for\nbloating for Digestive relief after\nyou've eaten and so like try out fennel\nseeds in your you know water in the\nmorning there's so pick one thing you\ndon't have to be over whelmed with so\nmany different practices and spices and\nthings in the book pick one or two a\nweek that you want to incorporate um and\nsee how you like it see how your body\nreacts to it yeah I love that I mean you\njust mentioned two things there that I\nwanted to speak to you about people have\nalways been fascinated with your morning\nand evening routines I wanted to ask you\nwhat does your morning routine look like\nnow and why have you chosen the specific\nthings that exist in it m good question\nare you not part of my morning routine\nthough what do you mean you don't know\nwhat my morning routine of course I do\num what is my morning routine so I don't\nknow what happens before I wake up\nthat's true um so I wake up in the\nmorning um and brush my teeth and also\nuse my tongue scraper which by the way\nis an aurvedic ritual that if you don't\ndo that is a must you do not know how\nclean your mouth can actually be if you\nhaven't used a tongue scraper it's also\nreally important to remove toxins that\nhave built up over the night because\nthat's the time your body starts to\nclean up and take away the toxins and\none place that they come out is on the\ntop of your tongue and so tongue\nscraping is a must and then I make my\nccft in the morning sit down for my\nmeditation and I have a month meditation\npractice as you know um and that's\nusually for about an hour and a half\nmixed in with breath work to help me\nrefocus um and keep bringing my mind\nback to my practice and then um I\nusually get ready for my workout go for\nmy workout and that's ranges from Monday\nWednesday Friday a Weight Workout I love\nweight training it really helps to build\nstrength and I feel confidence in my\nbody the other days I'll either do\nrunning or like a heated yoga class\nother things that help also stretch out\nmy body because I find weight training\nkind of shortens your muscles whereas\nPilates and yoga really helps to\nlengthen them so kind of a mix of both\nand then I'll come back get ready and\nthen what else do I do oh then I eat my\nbreakfast yeah what do you usually have\nfor what do I normally have for\nbreakfast so at the moment I'm trying to\ndo Savory breakfast after listening to\nglucose goddess um and really trying to\nincorporate more Savory Foods and I\nprefer savory breakfast anyway so I do\neverything from a Sourdough toast um\nwith some sort of protein on it so\neither like having a good amount of\nhummus with lots of veggies I'll put\nlike tomatoes and cucumbers um maybe\ndoing and I'll sprinkle some sort of\nspices on top so whether it's you know\ntoasted corander seeds um or cumin\npowder and then um a bit of hot sauce\nbecause I just love hot sauce and then\nI'll have that or I've been having these\nlike protein Bagels you know topped with\nthe same kind of thing and then I'll\nhave a protein shake afterwards so what\nabout your lunches when you don't want\nto feel lethargic after your lunches\nbecause so often we struggle to know\nwhat to eat because we still have a few\nhours of work left like what do you do\nfor your lunches what do you enjoy yeah\nI try to keep it balanced in the sense\nof I will still have a carbohydrate at\nat lunch time and by the way um our body\nis so ins sync with nature and our\ndigestion is the strongest when the sun\nis at its highest and so the sun is at\nits highest naturally in the middle of\nthe day and so our lunch should actually\nbe our largest meal of the day ideally\nbecause that's when our digestion is the\nstrongest it's able to digest like the\nheavier things that we want to eat and\nso I will have like a larger portion of\nmy carbohydrates if possible in the\nafternoon and then I will mix in lots of\ndifferent veggies like eating the\nrainbow is no joke you have to eat\nvariety of colors and so I will make\nsure that when I'm doing my Sharp I have\na variety of vegetables with different\ncolors because each of those colors\nrepresent different nutrients and\ndifferent vitamins and minerals and so\nto make sure you're also getting enough\nof what you need in terms of vitamins\nminerals make sure that you have a\nvariety of different colors on your\nplate so I'll buy like pink radishes\nI'll buy cucumbers I'll buy different\ncolored carrots and um either I'll have\nthem on the side or I'll just quickly\nsauté them have it with either some\nnoodles or um throw some tofu in there\nscrambled honestly I just make sure I\nknow the basics of like a really good\nway of doing is write down where your\nprotein is going to come from what\nveggies you love eating and what\ncarbohydrates you like and then just mix\nit all in I love doing a one pot thing\nso I'll throw in noodles I throw in my\nveggies I'll throw in some tofu mix it\nall up or I'll do a scramble like\nscrambled tofu on toast I just know that\nthe areas I need to make sure I have in\nmy meals and then I kind of just pick\nand choose between go between them and\ndecide what I feel like um and what\nflavors I want and then what about\ndinner dinner um walking through the\nwhole day I know oh my gosh uh\ndinner I mean you know it can be so\nvaried I love for me a doll or a a soup\nor like a a beanie Curry I'll probably\nhave I wouldn't have like as much like\nflatbread or rice with it just because I\ntry not to have too many carbs at night\nuh or something too heavy at night but I\nlove Indian spices are just my comfort\nfood and at night especially when it's\ncold outside I love having a mixed\nlentil like Dal um and all of these\nrecipes are in the book yeah yeah yeah\noh there's a really good like red lentil\ndll in there there's also my mom's uh\nthree bean curry with coconut milk and\noh it's so good so much flavor in it so\nyeah I'll usually do that or a one pot\nthing because at night you just you just\nwant to throw everything in one thing\nand and not spend too much time in the\nkitchen and so there are so many recipes\nin there that are like 30 minutes um and\nthen other ones where maybe you feel\nlike spending a little bit more time in\nthe kitchen and so you can spend an hour\ncreating a beautiful meal if you have\ntime on the weekend yeah I'm so lucky\nthat I get to be the recipient of you\nare the guinea pig yeah yeah I'm the\nguinea pig all of this has been tested\non and what about your evening routine\nhow has that been constructed for you my\nevening routine is usually I try to as\nsoon as I stop working I usually go walk\nfor a little bit I find it really helps\nme to wind down I would do an intense\nworkout but I'll definitely walk go on\nthe treadmill for about like 20 minutes\nhalf an hour listen to something um and\nthen one thing that's really helped me\nis I don't like bright lights at night I\nreally try to avoid Bright Lights it's\nmade such a difference to my like Sarcan\nRhythm the rhythm of your body that\nhelps with sleep artificial life really\nmesses with that and so whether it's\nusing candles or really keeping the\nlights dim that for me has helped me\nnotice that oh wow I'm actually really\ntired by 8:30 or 900 and it's time for\nme to get into bed rather than and by\nthe way TV has the same light and so do\nour phones and so uh for me the bright\nlights are too intense for me and it and\nit really you know messes with my rhythm\nof sleep so I've started using candles\nand stuff a lot more and then we've been\ntrying to read a lot more and so I'll if\nI'm by myself I'll I'll read um\nsometimes watch a little cheeky show of\nsomething which might be called love\nIsland not going to lie and then um and\nthen oh eat dinner and that before that\nand then one of my favorite practices\nwhich is like a self- love ritual for me\nis um abanga it's a really beautiful\npractice of abanga is about in the book\nyeah I talk about it in the book and\nit's it's um massaging your own body\nwith oils that's as simple as it is but\nif you think about it how many how many\ntimes a day do we probably have a lot of\nnegative selft talk and how many times a\nday do you give yourself a hug and like\njust it's literally like giving yourself\na hug just as when someone's had a long\nday a hard day they come home and you\ngive them a hug like you give them a\ncuddle and in the same way our nervous\nsystem wants us wants to hear from us\nand feel from us that I love you and I\ncare about you and one of the most\namazing ways of doing that is by just\ngiving yourself a little massage and so\nwhether it's is just the bottom of your\nfeet putting the warm oils on your hands\nmassaging the bottom of your feet that's\nwhere all of our nerves end and so\nbottom of your feet or even giving\nyourself a little scalp massage or if\nyou have time have a warm shower and\nlather your body in those oils oils\nactually help to lubricate your nervous\nsystem they seep into your skin they\nbasically act as a hug for your nervous\nsystem they help to soothe your nerves\nat night and so that's been one of my\nfavorite rituals that I do before I\nsleep um yeah and I'll do that whether\nit's a two-minute one quickly or if I\nhave a bit longer on weekends and I just\nkind of lather myself up till I'm really\ndeep fried yeah I love it I love it no\nand I'm glad that we went through a\nwhole day because I think so often we\ndon't there was so much that just came\nout of that good like in terms of like\nyou know like what to eat in the morning\nwhy you eat certain things in the\nafternoon why you don't eat them at\nnight time like we just learned so much\nand so many practices and again for\nanyone who wants to understand them more\ndeeply they are well explained inside\njoyful the book oh my gosh wait can I\nsay one more thing of course you can I\nrealized actually um you know I was\ngoing through a period where I was\nfinishing eating by 5:00 p.m. like I\nwouldn't eat anything after that and\nwhat was amazing is I was using I hated\nyou when that happen yeah yeah I was\nusing a Tracker and for my sleep um I\nwas using the whoop at the time and I\nnoticed I was getting 100% I've never\nhad this 100% sleep score wow on my work\nand it was telling me and and I'd gone\nfrom being 70% to having 100% every\nsingle day wow and it was because my\nbody was not working while it was\nsleeping and so yeah because when you're\nwhen you end up eating late at night\nwhen you're trying to sleep and your\nbody's trying to rest and you know\nactually spend time having downtime it's\nactually still working digesting its\nfood and so you can wake up after 8\nhours sleep feeling so tired still\nbecause your body's actually been\nworking half of the time to digest what\nyou've been eating so that was like a\nbig like aha moment for me where I was\nlike wow that really does make sense\nhaving lighter meals at night affects so\nmuch um including your sleep I love that\nthat's great no that's huge and and\nthat's amazing I mean to have a 30%\nincrease in your sleep score because\nyour food is not being digested while\nyou're sleeping cuz so many of us are\neating so close to when we sleep yeah a\nlittle snack a little dessert little\nsugar yeah huge uh one thing I wanted to\ndo I wanted to do something fun with\nyour work so I'm ask you questions that\nI want you to link back to recipes that\napply to those questions okay and you\ncan look at your book if you need to to\nshow us but give example of the question\nthere's no example we're just going\nstraight into so the first question I'm\ngoing to ask is if someone has had a\nlong day at work they're really tired\nbut they do want to make a home-cooked\nmeal what's the easiest one that they\ncan go to my rainbow noodle stir fry\nokay it's like super easy um what I\nwould say is have your veggies cut up\nearlier then it's literally like a\n10-minute meal amazing yeah it's got\nthis really great sauce with it um you\nget your veggies you get everything all\nin one thing and it still tastes good\nand it feels like takeout yeah yeah okay\ngood how do you how do you recommend\npeople meal prep because that's an\nimportant part of all of this chopping\ntakes up so much time my day my meals\nare cut down significantly when I've\nchopped my Peppers beforehand when I've\ngrated my cabbage when I've you know\neverything that you possibly can I\nwouldn't say to do it too in advance\nbecause as soon as you cut up a\nvegetable it starts to spoil and so I'd\nsay you can cut up Peppers 2 3 days in\nadvance um same with like carrots\ncabbage and stuff Tomatoes go bad\nstraight away you cut them up by like an\nhour later they're badoc avocados as\nwell and so there are certain things you\ncan chop up and I recommend doing that\nespecially if you're someone who has\nbeen wanting to eat more at home but\njust don't have the time to cut up your\nstuff in the weekend because at least\nthat'll give you a good 3 4 days worth\nof uh chopped up stuff that allows you\nto eat at home\num and that's been a game Cher for me\nI've been so busy lately and I've still\nsince I've got back here I'm actually so\nproud that I have not ordered out or\neaten out once and that's been that's\ncrazy for me because I've also been way\nbusier than normal um but having things\nchopped up and also having planned what\nI'm going to eat usually we end up\nordering out when you're like I've have\ngot nothing planned and I just don't\neven want to look in my fridge and\nfigure it out figuring out is half the\nbattle so if you already know and you\nalready have the ingredients it makes\nMak it so much easier and then you've\nchopped it up you've basically done half\nthe work I love it yeah okay so let's\nsay another scenario I've got all these\nscenarios okay so someone's got someone\nthey're dating coming over for the first\ntime second time maybe they're making\nthem something this time what do you\ncook for someone to impress them from\nyour book oh my gosh you want to show\noff you know good question I would say\nmy jalapeno cheesy dough balls you know\nwhy because they're those were we had\nthem the other day they so good you can\nhave like there's a masala topping to go\non top too but the reason I say that is\nbecause it shows that you don't take\nthings too seriously that it's a fun\ndish that's like a pull apart you didn't\ntry too hard yeah you didn't try too\nhard your sh it's a sharing dish where\nyou kind of pull apart the bread and um\nit's fun um it's also just a pop of\nflavor and Vibrance um and also who\ndoesn't love a good bread dish yeah like\nbread is life love it yeah if you've got\nanother scenario if you've got the girls\ncoming over it's girls night you're\nhanging out what are you going to make\nokay so for girls night I would probably\nsay the roasted red pepper tag lelli and\nthen mixed with that we're not done yet\nyeah roasted red pepper tag lelli and\nthen doing like the butter bean and\ntomato salad because you always want\nsomething a bit lighter on the side um\nand then having some sort of Veggie side\nbecause you always need I have a whole\nveg hero section so I'd probably do like\nthe zucchini Baba Gan or the sweet and\nsalty broccolini and then for dessert\nbecause for girls like you need dessert\nI have this decadent cake which is\namazing it's like one of the best\ndesserts in here I'd say um I made it\nthe other day the triple chocolate\nbrownie Black Forest celebration cake\nbut what I do is I deconstruct it so it\nends up being a brownie Sunday so that\nwould be my ultimate girls night I love\nthat or I do ultimate guys night oh\nultimate guys night easy I would do my\nbean burgers okay I like that I like\nthat I would do my bean burgers strong I\nthen would do bean burgers with the side\nof my dad's mac and\ncheese um and then for a bit of balance\nI'd probably throw in some\nveggies which would be in the form of my\ngolden caramelized fennel I think\nthat'll be a nice like little refreshing\nside dish and then for dessert I'd\nprobably have to go for cookies\nthreeways M that sounds good or a\ncrumble yeah I like that cookies\nthreeways three way crumble is amazing I\nthink for guys that yeah and last\nscenario date night what would you make\nme on Dat night I mean I've been really\nlucky cuz Fry's been testing recipes\nfrom the book every day so I've been\nspoiled every day but you know what date\nnight I'd probably go with um it depends\nis this like a like a this is like a\nmarried couple who Liv together for a\nwhile they want to make a special day I\nprobably do like my Mexican lasagna\nbecause that wasun\nand it's just so tasty and then I throw\nin maybe like my warm nutty superfood\nsalad on the side um oh and maybe my\ncaval the sweet potatoes with cavalino\npesto so when are we doing date night um\nyeah I mean I can make it all tonight if\nyou want straight off and then Bava\ncheesecake oh Bava cheesecake it all off\nor my chocolate mud pie for you cuz you\nlove chocolate chocolate M both of those\nare amazing Ry I'm so proud of you\nthanks and I I'm so excited

single one of\nthem sounds amazing and I can truly say\nsomeone who's eaten every single one of\nthem multiple times I'm not bored of\nthem they're incredible and I think\nanyone who gets this book and Cooks from\nit is going to invite so much joy so\nmuch energy so much vibrancy into their\nlife and that's what I wanted to ask you\nas a final question around you know you\ncall the book joyful you talked about\ncooking effortlessly eating freely and\nliving radiantly like what is your hope\nfor people because this isn't just\nabout it isn't just about the recipes\nit's about inviting abundance and energy\ninto their life it is three intentions\none intention is reminding people that\nyou do not have to choose between the\nfood that makes you feel good and food\nthat brings you Joy it can and should be\nboth um two that every that life is\nabout all those little joyful moments to\naccumulate to bring you more and more\njoy throughout the day whether it's\nthrough your practices your Wellness\nrituals or through the food that you're\neating and three that you f you spice up\nyour life like you fill your cupboards\nwith the spices that spice up your body\nbut also spice up your food too that\nreally create Vibrance cuz spices are\nvibrant and create more Vibrance in your\nbody and your life too um and actually\nI'll add on the last one\num I feel like I am a seriously grateful\nstudent of many great teachers and it\nreally was a way for me to be able to\nshare so much of what I've learned from\nthe people that have taught me so much\nfrom my mom to my aric teachers to my\nspiritual teachers everything I was able\nto accumulate that and pour it into this\nbook and I'm so excited for people to\nfeel the changes that I have felt in my\nlife through everything that I've shared\nin there so um yeah that's my intention\nfor it the book is called Joy for\neveryone more than 125 plant-based\nrecipes by Rad devlukia cook\neffortlessly eat freely and live\nradiantly
