    "transcript": "when I learn to not judge other people I\nrealize you have to look at when you\njudge somebody else and your fingers\npoed this way you know like Byron Katie\nsays there's three fingers pointing this\nway and so I realized if I had a\njudgment about even say a friend right\nwell gosh I needed to look at is that is\nthat judgment really about them or is it\nabout me and so often the thing I might\nbe picking on in my mind about them was\nactually about me and so I had to learn\nto say to myself okay what is it in\nmyself that I don't like um and can I\njust be okay with that"
