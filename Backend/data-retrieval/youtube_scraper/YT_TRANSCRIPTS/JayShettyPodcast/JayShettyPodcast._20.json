    "transcript": "and I think we equate Grace to weakness\nwe think if I'm kind to myself then\nthat's weakness and actually I found\nthat guilt blocks growth for sure that\nguilt doesn't make you grow guilt can\nmaybe make you feel bad for a second and\npush you in the right direction but over\na sustained period of time guilt will\ndrain you totally and so I think Grace\ndoes what guilt can't it says I'm going\nto give some space to where I'm at so\nthat I can get back on the horse whereas\nif I just guilt myself I'm going to keep\npushing myself down into the ground I'll\nnever get back up"
