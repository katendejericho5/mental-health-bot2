screens for 8\nyears the man himself James Cordon I\nwent upstairs and I sat in his room and\nI just went to him uh I need you to know\nthat I haven't changed I love you more\nthan you'll ever know and he\nwent before we jump into this episode\nI'd like to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nshett J shett the one the only\nJett\nJames it is truly a honor and privilege\nto have you here today because I have to\nbe honest with you I've been a huge huge\nhuge fan ever since Smithy and comic\nrelief and I was at the Grove just a\ncouple of weeks ago and I was\nremembering how that sket started there\nyou yeah and you walk into one of the\nrooms and you're with the and so I've\nbeen such a huge fan from day one and\nwatching you and admiring your journey\nseeing you go crushing it from the UK\nthrough to the US and you know I moved\nto the us a few years after you did but\njust getting to see the impact you had\nthere the amazing amazing content that\nyou've created I'm a big fan of whether\nit's spill your guts or carpo karaoke\nlike every single segment you guys\nproduce such a huge fan and so to be\nable to sit with you and even the few\nmoments we've just spent together off\ncamera I've already enjoyed your company\nbut I wanted to start off by just saying\nI'm a huge fan and thank you for doing\nthis so I'm a huge fan of yours I think\nwhat you've done is is really uh quite\nextraordinary actually I I really think\nI think it's actually deeper than a a\nsuccessful podcast or show or book I I\nthink what you've done really I think\nand I'm sure I'm certainly not the first\nperson to say this to you is you've\ncreated like a safe place for people to\ntalk about to talk about mental health\nhealth everything you know what I mean\nfeelings the depth that that I I I think\nis of course we're more aware of today\nthan we were a decade ago and certainly\na decade before that and I think you're\nyou're a real big part of that and I'm a\nreal fan of the show and it's given me a\na lot over the years so it's a real\nthrill to be here and I hope I can be\ndeep enough to fulfill the needs\nrequired you know well for everyone\neveryone who doesn't know everything\nthat James was saying to me off camera\njust now like James save it I need I\nneed you to say it again because it was\nit was so it was perfect but James I was\nthinking about this I was looking at\nyour journey and I was seeing like you\nwent from writing right Gavin and Stacy\namazing success gone to the West End\namazing success Broadway Tony Award\namazing success then moving off into\nlate night amazing success and there was\nsomething I was observing about you and\nI felt that what I saw in you was\nsomeone who had the ability to\ncontinuously disrupt themselves take\nrisks and innovate when it seemed like\nthere was a clear path and I wonder\nwhether what's the decision you've made\nright now is almost the same thing that\nyou've said I don't want the safe option\nI'm willing to take the risk would you\nagree with that yes I I think so I mean\nit's really lovely of you to say that\nthere's there's also misses in the\nmiddle of that do you know what I mean\nlike I think it's very important to say\nthat that curve could also be looked you\nknow what I mean there's there's as many\nmisses as there is hits you just want to\nkeep that ratio as as clean as you can\nyou know in the sort of last sort of six\nmonths since finishing the show and then\nthe few months before that after when we\nannounced that we were ending the show\nlots of people would\nsay uh you know they would ask why\nyou're doing this and why would you\nleave such a thing and such a contract\nand offer and all that th those things\nwhich I I completely understand I've\nalways been able to\nseparate work and\nlife and that the two one shouldn't\noutweigh the other does does that make\nsense that that actually you have to go\nwell I know that for my\ncareer Ruth and I could have Ruth Jones\nwho I co-wrote Gavin and Stacy with\nwhich was a a show that became\nsuccessful in in the\nUK we we could have of course have\ncarried on writing that show and making\nmore episodes of that show but I don't\nknow that that was at the time feeding\nour life you know I was wasn't feeding\nmine it wasn't feeding ruths it was like\nwe've done that it's time to stop we\nhave to do something else and then you\nknow I I love being in plays I love\nbeing in the theater and when I was in\nOne Man 2 Governors or or The History\nBoys there was a path where you could\nsay well I could carry on doing this and\nthere were moments or opportunities to\nperhaps go and do another play after\nthat but it was like well I don't know\nthat that's going to feed my life so I\nthink the the key from what or what I'm\ntrying to do is go well if my work is\nfeeding my life and my family then it's\nof benefit and if it isn't then it won't\nbe and I think some people perhaps often\njust look at their career as being the\nprimary thing in their life or the work\nis the thing I'm going to do this and\nI'm going to do that then I'm going to\ndo this then I'm going to do that and\nyou have to go no no but but how is that\nfeeding your life and your soul and who\nyou are as\na friend son brother husband father you\nknow and that's that's the thing I think\nI've always thought about so the\ndecision to end the show had nothing to\ndo with not enjoying it anymore it had\nnothing to do with it not being fun\nfinancially of course it was fantastic\nbut then it got to a point where I was\nlike is it feeding me and us as a family\nis this environment what we want now I\ndon't think it is okay well then we're\ngoing to then we're just going to turn\nit over and shake it and see what it is\nthe other side of that yeah the thing I\nkeep coming back to all the time in\nmy in my life a lot recently is just to\nconstantly say well we don't know yet we\ndon't know I don't know yet I I can't\ntell you if it was a good thing or a bad\nthing to stop the show I don't know I\nwill only know in a year or two years or\nmaybe five years time because you just\ndon't know you don't know at all you\nknow in the same time that you might\naccept a role over here and when you get\nthat job people are going oh my God this\nis the greatest thing ever and you say I\nwell we don't know me and my friend\nLouie very dear friend of mine Louie who\nmoved to the moved to America to come\nand write on The Late Late Show you know\nuprooted his family move he didn't have\na family at the time had two kids in\neight and a half years we were there we\nwrote a TV show together which got\npicked up at Hulu I wasn't going to be\nin it we just created this show and then\na few months later we wrote two scripts\nand they really love the first script\nthen we wrote the second script and they\nsaid look we we're just we're not going\nto make this show happens all the time\nand we were I was really bummed and my\nfriend Louie said the best thing he was\nlike look if they'd have picked it up it\nmight have been the worst thing to ever\nhappen to us we might have fallen out we\nmight have who knows what would have\nhappened it might have been a disaster\nwe just don't know yeah you have no idea\nyeah don't know anything you've reminded\nme of this beautiful Zen story where\na farmer finds a new horse story you\nknow the story amazing yeah the farmer\nfinds a new horse and everyone's excited\nand they're like wow this beautiful\nhorse you just came upon it like how\nlucky are you and he says good thing bad\nthing who knows yeah and then his son's\nriding the horse and he looks incredible\nbut then all of a sudden he gets tipped\noff the horse and his son falls off and\nbreaks his leg and everyone's like oh no\nthis is the worst thing ever like if\nonly you didn't bring that horse in and\nhe says good thing bad thing knows and\nthe story continues and hearing you say\nthat it's really honest of you to share\nthat though because I think sometimes\nwhen we make a decision we often feel\nlike we have to convince ourself it's\nthe best decision in order to make it\nthrough but for you to actually have the\nvulnerability to say I actually don't\nknow that takes a lot of Courage well I\nI do know that that ending the show I do\nI do know that the the reasons for it\nare absolutely right no question\nbut but you don't know you don't know\nhow those things will you just don't\nknow you don't know any of it so if you\ncan accept all of it if you can just say\nwell this\nis this is it this is this is life what\nwe're doing now me and you sitting here\nthis is it we're doing it you're alive\nand if I think sometimes the expectation\nof stuff is the thing which really ruins\nstuff your expectation of what a holiday\nmight be your expectation of what\nChristmas day was going to be like is\nthe is actually the problem the thing\nthat happened on holiday or the the\nargument you had on Christmas day that's\nnot really the issue I didn't have an\nargument on Christmas Day I'm just using\nas example that's the thing I think is\nis your expectation of well when I do\nthis my life will be like that and I\nthink my I think I've thought that a lot\nof my life when I get my driver's\nlicense my life will be like this when I\nget a girlfriend my life when I get my\nwhen I move out of my parents house my\nlife is going to be like this and it's\nnot it isn't it can't be it's and what\nit is will be amazing you're going to be\nalive you know and I think I just feel\nvery\naccepting of everything now at the\nmoment yeah there's something really\nbeautiful that came out of what you said\nthis idea of reasons over results like\nyou know your reasons you don't know\nwhat the result will be but you're sure\nabout your reasons and that's something\nwe can all practice and take on like I\nthink that's something everyone who's\nwatching can apply that you never know\nthe result of your decision you don't\nknow how it's going to pan out but you\ncan be sure about your reasons without\nquestion and if you feel clear about\nthose and to recalibrate perhaps what\nsuccess is and that's I think a big\nissue in a broader Society what is\nsuccess success is not\nthis amount of money it's not this\namount of gold statues and trophies you\nyou know you've got to look at it as a\nwhole it's really interesting if you if\nthere there are there are numerous\npeople who talk about the night that\nthey won an Academy Award as being the\nLoneliest Night of their life and and\nand yet for us looking in on that you\nlook and go oh my God that's this is\nincredible I would give anything why do\nyou think that is because I think it's\nmore The Climb is the thing the top of a\nmountain I I think can be quite a\nisolating experience actually and the\nclimb to the top of it is and of course\nwhen you get there it's amazing because\nyou\ngo oh my God we did you know what I mean\nwe did it it's like someone that takes a\nhelicopter to the top of eest is not\ngoing to have the same experience as a\nperson who's climbed it absolutely\nyou're looking at the same view but it's\ngoing to be it's going to feel very very\ndifferent for sure I also think it's\nit's an\nincredibly you know the anxiety of it\nthe the the fear of it I can only I\ndon't know I'm not I don't know I can\nonly imagine and so I think because I\nthink what you realize is that the doing\nof the work and the climb of it is the\nthing that is the most satisfying and\nhow can there be such a thing as best\nyeah ever you can be the fastest runner\nover a 100 meters that's that's not up\nfor debate you say Bol you are the\nfastest runner over 100 meters you can't\nbe the best film that's that's\nimpossible you know it's more subjective\nof course it is and should be yeah where\ndid where did your drive for Success\ncome from from you just said that you've\nrealized now that success is not you\nknow the bank balance or this or that\nthese specific things where did your\ninitial drive for Success come from did\nyou always define success in a\nparticular way or was it just what you\nthink everyone in our generation was\nalmost chasing I I don't know I I I\nthink I for me really from I\nreally don't remember a time that I\ndidn't want to perform I just don't\nremember a time that I didn't want\nto just perform did you perform at\nschool and at home and I mean everywhere\neverywhere I would call it performing\nI'm sure some people would call it\nshowing off my mom would you know\noscillate between the two stop showing\noff so you know like I just I just loved\nI just loved I\nloved performing in in in in any shape\nor form School play\nChurch playground I just I really really\nloved it like I I can remember so\nvividly the first time I was ever sort\nof on what we'd call a stage so we we\ngrew up in I was a we were a family that\nwere in the Salvation Army which is a\nchurch but that's also a charity and and\nuh like any church you're born into you\nthink think that this is completely\nnormal you know when you're any any\nchurch you're Bor into and then like\nthat we you know we would like put on a\nuniform and my we would my dad would you\nknow occasionally March down the road in\na brass band and we would do Christmas\ncaroling and I would play the trumpet\nand you just thought well this is just\ncompletely normal life and then you get\nto about 15 and you're like guys this is\nreally weird but it was essentially a\nchurch and that's what we'd go to and uh\na church from what I can really work out\nnow retrospectively was perhaps full of\nthe least Christian people I've ever met\nin my life you know like many churches\nyou know at its core good infect it with\npeople becomes something very very\ndifferent and uh and so we're in\nhighwick in in bakim Shar and and my\nsister was three no four my sister Ruth\nwas four and it was her\nchristening and we were on the the\nplatform which was you know to all\nintensive purposes looked and felt like\na stage to me\nand the uh Savage army officer the Vicor\nthe\npriest I couldn't see because I was you\nknow quite morning he said let's get\nJames a chair and I stood on this chair\nand I could just see there was maybe I\ndon't know 30 people in the congregation\nit looked like a thousand and I just\nstarted like pulling these faces and\nturned around and looked back through my\nlegs and people are chuckling and I was\nlike well this feels\nfantastic and then what I really\nremember is sitting back down in the\ncongregation\nand my uh I sat between my mom and dad\nand person's back is in front of me and\nI remember being like well this is\nboring this isn't nearly as much fun as\nbeing up there and I was I was seven at\nthe time and no I was four and my sister\nwas obviously a newborn so I was four\nand I remember just thinking well this\nis that's that's it now life is a quest\nto to be up there as much as possible oh\nthat's beautiful so I think that's what\nI always thought success was like my my\nmy absolute Ambitions were to be in a\nWest End musical yeah that was it that\nwas like that was the peak and literally\nit was a roadway from where we are now\nat the prince Edwood theater and I was\n17 and in a musical and I was I I\nhonestly genuinely was like well that's\nit for me I will it cannot be greater\nthan this that's how that's where my\nabsolute Ambitions were to be just on a\nWest End stage that's spectacular I mean\nyou said there were misses naturally in\nthe journey that I laid out in the\nbeginning I wonder what were some of the\nmost painful or tough misses whether\nwhen you were young or as you got older\nwhat were ones that you look to and say\nI'd love people to know about this or\nlearn about this because when you look\nat it from the outside it is easy to see\nhit hit hit hit hit but these are the\ncouple that maybe would surprise us well\nwell there's things that that you do\nthat just naturally aren't very good\nthat's the first you know what I mean\nthere's things that you you do and\nthey're not they're not very good those\nthings you you understand why they\ndidn't connect cuz they're not very good\nyou know and I oddly I don't feel sort\nof sense of\nany disappointment in in that really do\nyou know what I mean I don't because\nbecause someone asked me once because I\nI was in that film I was in that film\ncats right the musical Cats and uh and\nthat you know I haven't seen it but like\nby all accounts not good and didn't do\nvery well and someone said to me oh God\nyou regret that I was like no i' do it\nagain had a great time yeah you have to\nseparate sometimes your own experience\nand the outcome of a project because you\ncan do things that do really well but at\nthat time in your\nlife it was a disaster yeah do you know\nwhat I mean such a good point and at the\nsame time at the same time you can do\nstuff which isn't good but actually you\nhad a really great you know what I mean\nlike you know if I when we were shooting\ncats we had an afternoon and I sat in\nthis weird green suit with dots on your\nface yeah with Ian Kellen and Judy\nDench and I wouldn't swap that for\nanything yeah to literally sit and\ntalk to seran McKellen and Dame Judy\nDench about I couldn't tell you what we\ntalked about I couldn't tell you if it\nyou know and I was like well how lucky\nam I yeah this is extraordinary so I\nthink I did this I did a TV show which\ncame out I think about maybe a just two\nyears ago now maybe 18 months ago for\nwhich was on Amazon called mammals which\nI was really proud of and I really I\nreally\nhoped that people would find that and\nand and they didn't that's the only\nthat's the only thing that I look at and\nI think\nah because it got reviewed\nwell it's written by I think the best\nliving playright at the moment you know\nor certainly Young Living playright\ncalled jez\nButterworth who wrote like Jerusalem and\nthe ferryman and Mojo but then also\nwrote Skyfall and Spectre and Indiana\nJones and it was me and Sally Hawkins\nand Malia Kell and that's that's the\nonly that's I would say that's the only\nthing that I go ah I wonder what we\ncould have done differently to make\npeople find it but then we don't know\nyet yeah you don't know you don't know\nwhen it's going to take off again like I\nlove hearing about but even if it\ndoesn't we don't you know who know you\nknow what I mean like you just you just\nhave to I love what you just said mate I\nlove that perspective of the idea that\nand I can relate to that I've had\nmoments in my life where I'm having one\nof my biggest external career wins but I\ndidn't have the right people around me\nto celebrate it with and therefore it's\nnot as gratifying or as celebratory or\nit's not as meaningful whereas you could\nhave had something that externally like\nno one cared but you had the people\naround you where you knew what you'd\nbuilt and you know knew what you'd\ncreated and I love that that resonated\nso strongly honestly well also say that\nthe the notion\nthat I don't know the way I see it is\nevery single\nday your life can\nget turned\nover and flipped on its head in a phone\ncall every single day like I I used to\nsay that to to my wife Julia all the\ntime when we were in Los Angeles where I\nwould go every day we live here and the\nphone doesn't ring in the middle of the\nnight to tell us Something's Happened at\nhome is an absolute win it's an absolute\nwin and you just have to be so aware\nthat those things are coming and those\nthings are real and all the stuff that\nwe're talking about over here work and\nall those things it's it's not it\nisn't it isn't those things that are\njust going\nto just bang\nand you're to and then you're talking\nabout life before and after before and\nafter those moments like I was talking\nto a friend of mine the other day you\nknow and I'm I'm\n45 and my friend said to me and it's\nquite a dark thought but actually is\ngood to he said we've he said he's 45\nalso and he he said we've we've turned\nthe corner into snipers alley and I said\nwhat do you mean I didn't know what he\nmeant and he said you've to you're now\nin an alley and suddenly people are\ngoing to just and you're going to go oh\nmy God like it's just that it's that\nthat that shift in life of like oh this\nis where like I'm very fortunate both my\nparents are still\nalive so that's inevitable that's\ndefinite and then you're in this world\nof just absolute\nunknowns so I think the older I\nget the just the less I sort of think\nabout work in that way I just don't and\nmaybe because I've had six months of of\nreal\nreflection six months of not really\ndoing anything you know I'm do started\nthis this podcast that I'm really really\nenjoying outside of that I'm writing\nsome stuff some of it I hope people will\nsee other stuff I'm certain they never\nwill you know what I mean and I you know\nand and some I hope they never will\nthat's a terrible idea you know and you\njust don't know and so\nI just think less about work and I want\nto think more about my health and all\nthose all those things you know yeah\nwalk me through what like like you've\nhad all these transitions in your life\nwalk me through what your reflection\nprocess looks like in your head like\njust for you personally like it doesn't\nhave to be systematic or perfect just\nwhat is it what what do you go through\nis it looking at going well am I helping\nmy family am I taking care of them is\nthat the number one thing or are there\nother things that go through your head\nbecause I feel like you've had to make\nsome big transitions well that's that is\nthat's that's the number one thing\nyou're only as happy as your least happy\nchild is a wonderful saying which is\nwithout question true there is there is\nnothing that can happen in your\nprofessional life that will\nmatter if one of your\nchildren is\nunhealthy un unw\nwell either mentally or physically it\nthis is irrelevant so so that's let's\npark that as a as a given yes um very\nclear in terms of my reflection I I I\nmainly I just think what like I'm so\naware of time and the and the and the\npassage of time and that this is this is\nit and you have to go okay well now how\ndo you really really want to use your\ntime because I think when I was hosting\nthe\nshow I think I probably knew this at the\ntime but I recognize it more now that I\nthink I said yes a lot perhaps to too\nmuch because\nI I just loved I knew I wasn't going to\nhost that show forever I didn't want it\nto be the end of the book I didn't want\nit to be the last thing I did so I\ndidn't want it to be a shock when I\nfinished the show and said I'm going to\ngo back to act again now because I was\nvery aware that there was a lot of\npeople watching that show who had no\nidea that I'd ever acted before that so\nI really just said ABS yes I'll do it\nI'll be there I'll do it and I think I\nunderstand my reasons for it but now I\nthink mainly the thing I'm really\nthinking is\nwhat forget what you can do forget\nwhat's possible forget what's in front\nof you forget what's offered to you or\nnot offered to you what do you actually\nwant to do what is worthy of your\ntime what is\nworth not taking your kids to school in\nthe morning or picking them up at 4:00\nwhat are the because that's really the\nquestion you're asking yourself you know\nand like I don't have like so much money\nthat I don't have to ever work again I\nreally really don't whatever you might\nread on the Internet is I cannot stress\nyou untrue and so you know it's it's\nit's that thing of just going well what\nwhat do you what do you want to do is\nthere anything that you want to say and\nif there isn't then\ndon't and then and it will come it will\nit will it will it will come and you\nknow it's interesting this since moving\nback to London and I I feel in a\ndifferent cultural space I'm I'm trying\nmy absolute best to hit 10,000 steps a\nday that's I'm really really really\ntrying to do that and so sometimes I'll\njust go and once the kids are asleep\nI'll go and I'll be I'll look and I'm\nlook at 8,000 steps and I'm like babe\njust going to go I'm and I'll literally\nwalk up and down the road and to come\nback in and in that time of walking I'm\nstarting to feel the notion of like oh\nis maybe that's is that an interesting\nidea but don't leap on it yes don't go\nthat's it let's go let's book a flight\nlet's pitch it is to go let's let it\nlet's see if it almost just to treat it\nlike a plant really and go we're going\nto water it for a minute see if there's\nsomething there and and and already now\nI'm like well thank God I didn't go and\ntell someone about\nthat have you ever read that thing about\ndoing the thing yes yes yes I mean\nthat's my I just I just look at that\nalmost every day doing the thing just do\nthe thing don't talk about doing the\nthing yeah don't tweet about doing the\nthing\ndon't just do the thing the doing the\nthing is the thing and that's all I'm\nreally trying to do yeah it's it's\nfascinating because I find like you know\nyou've been performing as you said you\nlove performing when you're a kid you've\nbeen performing for decades now and it's\nalmost like an identity shift when you\nstop yourself from performing in an in a\nI'm talking about performing in a play\nor in a movie or on stage like you're\nnot allowing yourself to do something\nthat feels so pure and true and I can\nsee in your eyes when you were talking\nabout it like brings you to life yeah\nand and almost removing yourself away\nfrom that requires you to rethink your\nidentity a little like like who who are\nyou today or how are you feeling about\nwho you are when you're not performing\nwhen you've been so used to entertaining\ncrowds for so long but that's ego I\nthink that's ego that's what you're\ntalking about is ego I lived for eight\nand a half years what could only be\ndescribed as a narcissist stream do you\nknow what I mean like and that like and\nI I I cannot stress how much I think\nbeing the host of a late night TV show\nis one of the greatest jobs in the world\nI think it's amazing I think it is\nbrilliant like my God how lucky am I to\ndone that I think it's\namazing you know but if you were another\nway inclined you you know drive into a\nstudio lot you drive past a massive\npicture of your\nface that's that's the first thing you\nsee when you get to work is a huge\npicture of your face and your name you\nthen Park in an amazing parking spot\nwith your name on it you go\nin like I tell you the thing I miss most\nabout the show was my like I missed\nseeing there's a great lady called T who\nwas on the front desk of CBS and I would\njust I my interaction with her every day\nI I just grew to love it so much morning\nT morning James how's it going all good\nand as I walk through the door she'd say\nhave a good one and I'd go have a good\none and it would be a race to who could\nsay it first you get in a lift you come\nout the lift to be greeted by another\npicture of your face do you know what I\nmean it's like another picture of your\nface and your name you turn a corner and\nthen you start walking up a corridor and\nthere is just your name and faces\neverywhere right yeah yeah pictures of\nyou with every everywhere then you get\nto say well what are we going to do\ntonight back up then you get to like\nshoot a sketch with Matt Damon or drive\naround in a car with Stevie\nW then you'll come back into work get\ndressed you work also in a gang of\npeople who are the funniest people\nyou've you ever met in your life ever\nand they only want to try and make you\nseem funnier and that's amazing and you\nchat with them and you're hanging out\nwith them and then good day bad day and\ndifferent day your day will end with a\nstanding\novation right you'll step out of a\ncurtain and 400 people will go nuts and\nyou've got to remember and the thing\nthat I would just remember all the time\nis the other side of this\ncamera is a sign that says\nApplause do you know what I mean there\nis people going it go you know what I\nmean and you the the walk down from the\nfrom like office Green Room to the\nstudio is an amazing change in your\npsyche CU you're with all your bone that\nthat and very slow down I remember the\nfirst show because really you're in a\ngang you're in a team where you make a\nlate night show it's just a gang you\nyou're all making it together and then\nat some point people tap you on the\nshoulder and\ngo\nhave a good one and then you are\nsurrounded by people you walk in\nmicrophone makeup touch up you enter a\ndoor and you hear you know the other\nside of this thing you hear 400 people\nscreaming you hear go go okay that's\neverybody on your feet let's go this is\nhow we do it that another look at the CH\nall right every here we go let's get\nready okay and we're going to five four\nthree and you find yourself stood behind\na\ncurtain completely on your\nown and suddenly this team effort you're\njust you are on your own and the\nspotlight is behind you so this this\ncircle is on the curtain and a shadow of\nyou and\nuh I used to stand there I'd open my\nhands take a breath I would look and I\nwould say to I always have this feeling\nthat my grand Grandad is getting a real\nkick out of all this I so he is not with\nme in any spiritual sense he's just in\nfor the love right of\nit you know like I know that he just you\nknow he's a jazz musician he would be\nlike this is fun J you know and uh and I\nwould open my eyes and I would look up\nand i' say be with me just be with me\nand be here\nnow and for the next hour your only job\nis to enjoy yourself as much as you can\nit doesn't matter what's happened all\nday it doesn't matter what happens on\ntomorrow show your only job is to enjoy\nthis right now and I and I did and I you\nknow we did\n1,198 shows I think and I I just loved\nit I loved it so it's a lot to leave\nbehind it's a lot to walk away from but\nI also think\nthis period of\nsilence is so good for me I'm getting as\nI'm getting as much or more from this\nperiod now yeah like I you know it's so\nodd that I used to do that every day\nthat then even speaking to you now I'm\nlike God I haven't spoken to anybody in\nthis sense yes yes yes\nsince April mm haven't done anything\nyeah and it so it feels odd you're like\noh man this is and the podcast I'm doing\nI'm loving cuz I'm in your chair yeah\nand I'm but even now this feels\nunnatural and there is a feeling of like\nI don't know what I've got to say but\nthen you go but I'm I'm going to get to\nmeet Jay so that would be lovely you\nknow yeah so what is life without\nit it's it's it's great it's great I\nthink because I really really always\nknew that this wasn't going to be\nforever I always knew I wanted to\nleave\nbefore\nit ebbed away I just knew that I wanted\nto to to to do it and then stop doing it\nand see if there's something else and if\nthere\nisn't okay\ngreat who could wish for more do you\nknow what I mean I guess that's the\nthing I I look now and I think I don't\nwant any\nmore stuff or or fame or all those\nthings like what I'd really love to do\nis go I wonder if I've got one more\nthing to write I wonder if there's one\nmore thing to say\nlike I wonder if there just something\nelse and I don't know yet what a\nbrilliant way to live I mean when you\njust said that the idea of I knew that\nit wasn't going to last forever and I\ndid don't want it to that's so the\nopposite of how we're conditioned to\nthink most of us are conditioned to\nbelieve when you find something good\nhold on to it forever make sure it lasts\nforever because you never know and I\nlove your perspective because I think\nnot only is it healthier for the mind\nand the ego it's actually the reality of\nlife that everything is ephemeral and\ntransient and it will move anyway yeah\nand so you wanting to hold on to\nsomething that isn't yours to control is\nalmost a Fool's game anyway well then\nyou're a kid with a balloon yeah right\nand you go and hold I'm never I'm never\never going to let this balloon go right\nand ignoring for this for a second the\nenvironmental impact of letting a\nballoon go let's talk about it just\nmetaphorically you know that you go I'm\nthis is my balloon I'm hold this never\never ever ever ever going to let go of\nthis balloon in fact I'm going to go I'm\ngoing to tie it to my wrist so it can't\ndisappear cuz that that happened to me\nonce before and it you know what I mean\nI'm going to just come you know that's\nit and then slowly that balloon will\njust Wilt and it will run out of the\nthing that made it great and it will\njust then be then it's tied to your\nwrist and you're dragging it behind you\nright and actually there's something\nquite\nbeautiful and again environmentally I'm\nnot encouraging this we didn't we didn't\nknow about this when we were kids when\nyou let go of a balloon it's magical\nmagical look and then you see it and\nyou're like oh my God I used to have\nthat I used to hold on to that look at\nit now look it's just flowing that's\namazing and then you go and now I\nhaven't got a balloon and then you go\nwell maybe I'll get another one yeah\nmaybe there'll be another balloon and\nmaybe it'll be a different shape or\nit'll be shinier or whatever it is like\nyou've got to be able to let go of stuff\nto make new\nthings come in you've got to have the\nspace and the time yeah to encounter\nsomething new a friend of mine a year\nago maybe\nless had his heartbroken in in in the\nmost brutal\ncircumstances it was his first love\nfirst\ngirlfriend and they broke up and he\nwas just not in a good\nway and he this was his first real\nproper serious girlfriend certainly the\nfirst time he'd been in love\nbefore I just found myself saying to him\nI was\nlike this is\ngreat this is great because you\nreally only understand what love is once\nyour heart's been broken you understand\nhow tender it is and I was like and you\nunderstand it now and what's you're\nlooking at this all wrong you you get to\ndo it again you get to do this again\nyou're going to meet someone else and\nfeel all these feelings and\nperhaps you'll go into that relationship\nlearning what you've learned from this\nrelationship and that will then feed\nthat relationship in a different way M\nand like and he he's just met someone\nright yeah and he's like oh my God this\nis amazing and I'm like yeah got that\nballoon again yeah yeah that's it that's\nit and so again I think it's\nexpectation is the thing that that that\nmakes us hold on to stuff yeah if you\ncan just EB and flow with stuff you're\ngoing to find it so much easier to take\nThe Good The Bad and The everything in\nbetween is just all being good for you I\nthink James you're a philosopher who\nknew we're gonna have to add it to the\nlist we're gonna have to add it to the\nlist of uh list of the titles no genu I\nmean that visual you just painted of the\nballoon that's going to stay with me for\na long time I've probably never heard it\nI didn't I don't I don't I don't know\nthat it's a thing I think we just might\nhave made it up you you made it up but\nit is so Banky made it up yeah there we\ngo taken Banks's\nimage no that's s it's such a beautiful\nway of sharing that lesson there's you\nknow a Zen saying that\nsays what's holding you back is what\nyou're holding on\nto yeah and and that's you know but that\nvisual that you just painted is so\npowerful and even the visual that you\npainted of saying that you come out to\nall this rapturous Applause and you know\nthe hooa and the idea of you coming out\ninto the stage but you're all thinking\nabout the fact that the screen says\nApplause on the other side because I\nthink if you don't it's really dangerous\nI think it's really dangerous were you\nconscious of that and have you been\nconscious of that the whole time in your\ncareer because right not the whole time\nwhen when did when did that become like\na real because that's Marcus aelius\nmeditations at its best Marcus aelius\nfamously had a I don't know this so\nMarcus aelius when he would walk around\nthe romant town square he had an\nassistant that would follow him around\nand the role of the assistant was that\nwhenever anyone in the Town Square would\nsay Marcus aelius you are such an\namazing Emperor you were phenomenal\nyou're incredible the assistant's only\njob was to whisper in his ear you're\njust a man you're just a man wow and\nthat sort of practice and so when you\nsaid that that's what I that's the first\nthing I thought of when he said the\nApplause I was like wow you you know\nyou're living that I think I've probably\nfallen into the pitfall of thinking I\nwas more of a dude than I really was\nquite early in is in my career I think I\nguess in a way I think I'm I think I\ndon't know I think I'm sort of\nentering phase three right yeah if if\nphase one\nwas History Boys writing Gavin and\nStacy phase two was moving was one was\ngoing to Broadway to do one man two\nGovernors everything that came with that\nand then ending up hosting a late night\nTV show and phase three will be whatever\nthis is and I don't know um I I I mean\nlook I've fallen into all those pitfalls\nof thinking that you're more of a dude\nthan you really are thinking any of this\nis it's like Fame and success whatever\nyou know level of that I'm kind of have\nin in a way like is on the whole a a\npicnic right it's it's great it's it's\nit's lovely people come up they talk\nabout things all you or to things that\nthey that they've liked or or enjoyed\nand certainly being back here in London\nyou know it's amazing hearing people\ntalk about like Gavin and Stacy and\nstuff which obviously I would never hear\nin America it's and I'm so proud of that\nshow and I think I I've started to thing\nof like don't confuse the selfie right I\ndon't think the I think for me I think\nit's different if you're\nlike Brad Pit Harry Styles do you know\nwhat I mean Adele like I think that's a\ndifferent that's that's a whole that's\nan aura and an orb of of of Fame which I\nthink is not what I'm talking about now\nwhereas I think on the whole when people\nare asking for a selfie with me it isn't\nreally anything to do with me I think\nit's just people go well this is going\nto be good on my story right I do no I\ndo no I I'm not that is not any F I\ngenuinely believe that I think people\nare going well he's\nthere he's only over there this is going\nto this is going to be great yeah in\namongst the other four photos of my day\nright and so and I love taking photos of\npeople I don't say no some I used to say\nno when I was with my kids more but but\nnow they have a bit a bit a bit better\nunderstanding of it and I don't need to\nhold their hands all the time so that\nwas my my wife was like you cannot give\nyour attention to someone else when\nthey're that like so Charlotte the road\nwhatever so Charlotte so I'm out with\nlike you know my my two oldest it's\nalways a lot easier now and it's people\nare people are really great and cool and\nlovely but I don't ever ever in my ever\nin my life go H look at all these\npeople they just want a photo what can I\nsay I just go no no no this is they\ndidn't find me they haven't been waiting\nfor me I just happen to be in the same\nJoe and the juice as them do you know\nwhat I mean and it's like I might as\nwell you know\nI love that that's amazing but no I I do\nlove how how how conscious you were of\nthat and and it's uh it's it's it's so\nit's so fun because that mindset that\napproach to success that approach to\nfame makes everything just feel\nwonderful and beautiful and it makes\neverything so you know in the sense of\nwhen I don't I don't mean Perfection I\nmean in the sense of it gives you a\nsense of joy in an interaction removing\nthe expectation and the weight that can\ncome with it yeah I also just think you\nhave to just take it all with a bag of\nsalt yeah all of it everything yeah\neverything good bad yeah you know it if\nyou just can take it with the same bag\nof salt yeah and and and distance\nyourself from it mhm you can just sort\nof go well that's over there yeah yeah\nthat's happening over there and but but\nI'm but what's really H I'm here yeah\nand here are my friends and my all those\nthings and just and also just being so\naware of\nlike how lucky you are yeah how lucky\nyou are and and if you lose sense of\nthat and and and I understand when\npeople do by the way and I have you\nknow other points in in my career and in\nmy life and I don't I'm not walking\naround like this every day like I have\nall those same things right so this this\nit's not like I'm I'm sort of floating\naround like a kind I'm really really not\nand a lot of this really is predicated\non just how much sleep I get\nyeah that's true for all of us like that\nis it you know what I've been on this\nsupplement I was talking to my so I'm\nI'm very into you know biohacking and\nhealth and all the rest of it and so I\nwas I was been testing this supplement\nthat I've been having for the last 30\ndays and it's it's like boosted my\nmitochondria so so much that I can't get\nto sleep I have so much energy and I was\ntelling I was telling my doctor I was\nlike mate I really want to sleep like I\nenjoy sleep I'm someone I'm not someone\nwho sacrifices sleep I enjoy sleep sleep\nand I haven't been able I haven't really\nbeen able to sleep because of this one\nsupplement anything to do with like also\njet lag and the time difference I think\nthere's a bit of that but I've been here\nfor like 30 days now so I'm like it\nshould have gone in after a week or two\nbut I agree with you coming from LA to\nLondon is the harshest jet lag right\nbecause I go from sleeping really get\nused to it oh it's really rough and so\nit could be that but I feel like yeah\nsleep is we so rarely I I think there\nI'm saying rarely talk about we probably\ntalk about it more now than we ever have\nin the last 40 years but like sleep is\nthis extraordinary gift and I think I'm\nprobably more aware of it now because\nI've got a 12-year-old who it is who\nseems to think that sleep is some sort\nof\npunishment you know what I mean like he\nviews sleep as like why would you do\nthis to me like dude I don't want to be\nawake right now you know and and uh it's\nsomething like in\num in Alan de botton's new book yes\nplease uh which I just I brought for you\nas as a gift I think it's called a\ntherapeutic Journey a therapeutic\nJourney which I I bought for you is I\ndon't know if you want to plug other\npeople's books I no please no I it's not\nas good as how to live man alen and the\nschool of life I'm a big fan genius\nfantastic very big fan and he's got a\nsection in that book where he talks\nabout sleep and he says when you've got\na newborn baby when you've got a newborn\nbaby you are very very your your only\nintention is to put this child into a\nroutine and make sure that they sleep at\nthe right time for the right amount of\ntime so therefore you feed it the right\nfood to make sure it's the you know to\nthe right we have to because if you\ndon't get the right sleep they are going\nto be awful\ntomorrow and then at some point we just\ndecide well I don't need to do that\nthat's only for a baby yeah I can sit\nwith my phone at\nmidnight just looking a stream of 30\nsecond videos to then car to to not\nsleep and and imagine that I'm going to\nbe okay tomorrow and I I I I find that\nthat sleep is is just like this gift a\ntell me about it and the better sleep I\nhave that without questioning every\nfacet of my yeah in every facet of my\nlife I'm I'm better yeah like I'm really\nthinking about you don't drink right no\nno no I haven't so how when how long\nhave you not drunk uh I would\nsay how old am I like maybe 18 years or\nsomething right but did you ever were\nyou right okay not an Al I was never\nalcoholic but I drank socially enjoyed\nit had fun love drinking games like used\nto hang out with the lads and like yeah\ngo you're about where I am so I I I\nreally really yeah I I don't I very\nready drink at home I never really get\nin and go I'm going to have a glass of\nwine or a gin and tonic but if I go out\nyes and if I'm out I'm like I love the\nfeeling of\nbeing three and a half drinks in yeah\nbetween three and six I am look at Raj's\nface he knows what I'm talking\nabout I am I feel it in my knees and I\nlove it right yeah and now as I've got\nolder I'm\njust really um\nreally I'm going to really try to just\nstop doing that like with no great\ndeclaration you know you know I am so I\njust am really really going to try not\nto do that because my friend a a good\nfriend of mine my friend\njez I spoke to him about it and I was\nlike how did you just manage to just did\nyou just stop doing this and he said\nsomething to me and I think you'll\nreally like this he said I he said I\nstarted asking myself and I do think\nthis changes post probably like 37 38 it\nstarts to change in your body and he\nsaid I started to ask myself\nhow how\nmuch of Tomorrow do I want to\nborrow all I'm doing now by drinking is\nborrowing from Tomorrow wow right it's\nlike a it's it's like you're going to a\ncash point yeah you're going to a cash\npoint and you're going I'm going to\nwithdraw three hours from tomorrow that\nI will be useless and then probably if I\njust borrow three hours around about\nnoon or one I'll start to feel okay yeah\nso I'm borrowing from Tomorrow W and\nthat and how many hours do you want to\nborrow and sometimes you borrow a day\nyeah and then the only way you think you\ncan rescue that day is to go let's have\nanother one you know yeah and uh I\nthought that was a really amazing way of\nlooking at it and so my my intention is\nis to really try and and not do that I\njust want to\ntry try and just be healthier I don't\neven sort of think\nabout weight loss anymore I've done that\nso many times in my life just made so\nmany like decisions of just right this\nis it I'm not go why don't you change\nthat CU that isn't working why don't you\njust only try and do what is healthy and\nsee how that impacts your yes frame yes\nyou know yeah yeah yeah no I I I like\nthat approach I mean you know I think\nit's natural when when we're recording\nthis it's like New Year's resolutions\nand start of the year and all that kind\nof stuff and I think all of us know that\nabout 80% of us drop off by the end of\nJanuary by February we're not practicing\nthis New Year's resolution this massive\ncommitment we made and it's almost\nbecause we go from this huge extreme\nfrom being indulgent in December to\ntrying to be hyper intentional in\nJanuary yeah and trying to go from one\nextreme to the other and none of us can\nhack that it doesn't work well a friend\nof mine said a really good thing to me\nmy friend Simon said to me he said you\nneed to stop going on a diet because my\nweight has has gone up and down\nyou know I can I can see it in\nin too many videos on YouTube like where\nI was up where I was down I used to have\nlike three sets of Suits Lauren Shapiro\nwho was our wardrobe uh designer on the\nshow who I am now saying as I said it\nout loud would have hated hearing her\nname on on your podcast H and I my time\nwith her I used to just love so much\nbecause like I said so much of the day\nwould be a lot of people and then it\nwould just be me and her choosing suits\nand choosing what I'm going to wear and\nwe chat about the day and you know we've\nhad moments where we cracking up\nlaughing we have other days where one of\nus is really down and it would just be\nthis little precious moment in this very\nsmall walk-in closet that was off my uh\noff my office where all the suits were\nand my time with the those are the\nthings I really miss yeah that's the\nstuff I really really miss and she very\nvery subtly and we never talked about it\nwe never ever talked about it but I knew\nwhat she did and I was grateful was she\nbasically started organizing my suits\ninto\nlike really fat fat and always looking\ngood you could see and she would just\nyou always look good she know but she\nwould just very very in the in the just\nand I would go and then we just became a\nthing where I'd be like uh I think we're\nyou know particularly if we came off a\nHiatus or a go away and just okay I\nthink we're going to be and she'd be\nlike mhm and we'd never really speak\nabout\nit but my friend my friend said my\nfriend Simon said you need to stop going\non a diet I said what do you mean said\nYou' got to stop you've got to stop\ngoing on a diet he said because going on\na diet is like going on a holiday you\nare going to return you're going to come\nback wow that's he said if you go on a\ndiet what you're saying is this is\nshortterm said you need to just go This\nis How I Live Now that's good and this\nis it that's not going I don't eat any\nbread no no in moderation it's probably\ngood for you to eat certain types of\nbread but that's it and you're going to\ndon't just stop this thing of being like\na guys I'm not I'm on a diet and he was\nlike and stop broadcasting it stop\nsaying it just stop saying it just go\nthis is what I'm going to do I'm going\nto try and exercise like this I'm going\nto try and walk like I'm trying to do\nand just be like no no I'm going to I'm\ngoing to eat this and don't don't be\nlike well I want to be down 20s in 35\ndays like CU you've done that yeah yeah\nand you know how that plays out don't go\non something just change something\nthat's good I like that yeah on a diet\non a holiday that's good that's strong\nyou've got some wise Friends James I do\nthere's a lot of good there's a lot of\ngreat advice are these are these friends\nfor like life are these friends recently\nlike some my friends Simon I've known\nprobably yeah probably about nine nine\nyears and then I have yeah I have like\nfriends who I've known for 35 years you\nknow what I mean like what's it taking\nto keep those because I find like I've\nbeen talking to a lot of my male friends\nabout this recently and this idea of you\nknow do we have do you have a friend\nthat you could call in the middle of the\nnight and you know they would pick up\nthey would turn up they would be there\nbecause if you have one of those friends\nthat's pretty rare and Prett incred\nespecially as men I find it's it's\nalmost hard to have those vulnerable\nrelationships but you seem to be having\na lot of open vulnerable healthy\nconversations\nwith but I think it's easier now I think\nit's easier now than it used to be I\nthink I hope we're going to move into a\na a generation of of of men and I think\nyou and your show is responsible for\nthat I think lots of I think just the\nthe ability to to just be like I'm\nstruggling is a thing which I think for\na very long time men were conditioned to\nthat that was weak and actually it's\nalmost certainly the bravest thing you\ncan do it is it is a\ntremendous Act of Bravery to\nsay I'm not doing too great at the\nminute and as soon as those words leave\nyour\nmouth I reckon 20% of those things have\ngone M and and I'm very I'm very very\nfortunate I just have a lot of I love a\nlot of friends that I've known for a\nvery long time and I and I love them and\nI tell them I love them and I\nI and I\nenjoy the company of people so much you\nknow I I just you know it's interesting\nyou talk about who would call like my\nfriend Lou that I was just telling you\nabout who we wrote that script\ntogether Louie had a previous life where\nhe used to he would go\nout sometimes for three days I don't\nthink he'd mind you me saying this he'd\ngo out for days on end and I always\nalways and when I said to to Jules when\nwe met I said just so you know I've got\nthis friend Louie and he goes out for a\nlong time like you know what London was\nlike in those times in these very\nstreets yes yes and I said if he calls\nme I always I have to pick up I always\npick up because I always used to think\nhe might be in trouble this resulted in\nsome of the funniest things I've ever\nheard right him calling me at 2 3 4 5 in\nthe\nmorning resulted in some of the funniest\nthings I've ever heard and so that's why\nI say to anybody who doesn't pick up the\nphone to a friend in the night\nit might not always be bad it might be\nhe called me once I think it's okay to\ntell you this he called me once and I\nlike for half 3 in the\nmorning said hey man are you okay and he\nwent I'm and he's drunk and he went I'm\ngoing to tell you something now and it's\na\nfact I went what he went it's a fact I\nwent sorry he went what I'm about to\ntell you is a fact it is a fact of life\nand I would like to share it with you I\nsaid okay there quarter 4 in the morning\nhe's like it is a fact James that I have\nnever and will never see the Jersey\nBoys goodbye and hung up\nthe you know oh he's okay and so I love\nyeah I I don't know I I think friendship\nis I think it's I think it's sort of\neverything isn't it yeah like it's it's\nI cherish it\nSoh\nmuchh I also think you know with kids\nit's really important for them to see\nyou with friends yes to not separate\nthose things to to to\nbe to\ninvolve your friends with your children\nand your children with your friends\nbecause I'm really aware that like my\nson's 12 and and like\nhe's right\nnow like we just get on great we get on\nso well yeah so we get on so well it's I\nlove it's beautiful and I'm so aware\nthat that is about to\nchange because that is just nature you\nknow I I I took about a year ago before\nwe\nmoved before we moved back\nI took my\nson I can't even remember what happened\nhe was kind of stroppy and and he you\nknow stomped upstairs he's really not\nthat kind of boy but he he\ndid and I I went upstairs and I sat in\nhis\nroom and I just went to him uh I said\ncan I ask you some\nquestions and he was quite taken back cu\ncuz he thought I was going to go what\nwas that about and I can I ask you some\nquestions and he went\nyeah I said do you think I love you and\nhe went yeah I said do you think I would\never do anything to intentionally hurt\nor upset you he said no I said and do\nyou think in the 11 years that you've\nbeen on Earth do you think I've changed\ndramatically he went no I went well done\nyou scored 100% they are all the right\nanswers I said and I'm telling you\nthis because over the\nnext few\nyears there are going to be points you\nare going to think I don't love you you\nare going to think I am\nintentionally trying to hurt or upset\nyou and you're going to think that I've\nchanged and I need you to remember this\nthat I haven't changed we haven't\nchanged you've changed and you need to\nand you have to and you are going to go\nthrough immeasurable changes in your\nlife and\nbody and all we are trying to do me your\nmom your sisters and it's going to\nhappen to them too are just trying to\nhelp you\nnavigate these bumps that are going to\ncome your way and these changes both\nmental and physical that are happening\nfor you but I need you to know that I I\nhaven't changed I'm never trying to\nintentionally hurt or or upset you and I\nlove you I love you more than you'll\never\nknow and he\nwent I think we should have some sort of\ncode word so I remember this and so we\ncame up with we came up with some silly\ncode word that I would just say to him\nlike do you remember and he' be like and\nhe' be like oh yeah you haven't changed\nI was like my hair hasn't changed dude I\ngot the same hairstyle that I had when I\nwas was 18 years old you\nknow CHS that was yeah and I I really\nfeel that with friendship that that they\nI'm so painfully painfully aware yeah\nthat there's going to come a point where\nthe influences that aren't me are going\nto become bigger on my children for a\nmoment and so if I can make sure that\nthose other people that they look to\nare people who are aligned with how I\nfeel then it's going to be great you and\nsometimes they're going to take advice\nfrom Dad's friend more than they are\nfrom Dad they are going to seek it yeah\nthey're going to absolutely seek those\nother Role Models yes particularly boys\nI think that's right is that right I\nthink right yeah I like I don't know if\nthat's completely right but I do think\nthere is a perhaps more of a a thing\nbetween boys and dads and you know it's\nit's such a strange thing the the it's\nso you know yeah I I remember so you you\nwould have know this because we didn't\nknow each other then but became friendly\nwith um James Longman on your team years\nago yes and so longas had invited me to\ncome and watch the show this is when I\nfirst moved to LA when I first moved\nthis this was like five years ago God\nyeah and I got to come and he was he was\nhe's wonderful obviously he's the\ngreatest so he showed me around I got to\nsee all the rooms and like you know the\ngreen rooms and every like he was he\njust gave me the best toour ever he\ngreat uh took me to the photo wall I got\nto put up a fake photo of myself on the\nwall as if I've been on the show like\nyou know all all of it it was really\nsweet and we we didn't know other at all\nthen of course and um and I didn't know\nanyone else apart from him and I was\njust really excited to be there cuz I\nwas such a fan of the show and I\nremember you were you were so wonderful\neven in between the show where you're in\nbetween segments like it's not live and\nyou would come and chat to the audience\nyou'd Shake people's hands and then I\nremember you'd go and call your kids and\nyou'd literally sit at the desk before\nin between and just like get them\nbecause and you'd tell us you'd be like\nguys I'm just going to call my family\nbecause I'm going to say good night to\nmy kids and it was such a like it was so\namazing to see someone who's in the\nmiddle of everything you described so\nphenomenally earlier but then being like\nI just want to say good night to my kids\nbecause it's that late right however\nlate it was at that time I think kids\nwere going back to bed at seven or'\nseven or whatever it may have been and I\nremember you FaceTiming them and then we\ngot to wave it wave and and and I just\nremember how special that was and I I\njust think you know I've heard you say\nbefore that you know for so many years\nyour your family was marching to the\nbeat of your drum like they were they\nwere there for you they were just\nholding it together for you so that you\ncould build and create and I just think\nabout moments like that that you were\nhaving with them me I'm so worried that\nthe show you came to was\nterrible it's all I can think Mark\nRuffalo he was great he was great he was\ngreat but like that's that's really what\nwhat really resulted in us moving back\nis the truth is\nis you\nknow like my my wife just walks to the\nBeat of My Drum my family you know we're\ngoing to New York we're going to La I'm\ngoing here I'm going there babe I'm\ngoing to do this thing in Australia you\nyou're you're good here with the kids do\nyou know what I mean like honestly I\ngenuinely feel and I get the feeling\nthat you might be like this I feel like\nI could live anywhere yeah live anywhere\nI could live anywhere because we're very\nfortunate that that you're here now in\nLondon you're going to go back you're\ngoing to go to India you're going to go\nto New York you're going to to La like\nwhat a privilege I'm so aware that that\nhasn't been my wife's life for the last\n12 years MH 13 14 years you know and so\nreally our our our decision to move back\nwas like I I was going to stop the\nshow regardless you know there was there\nwas a moment where I was going to stop\nit a bit earlier and\nthen it was done so beautifully my\nleaving of the show like me and my\nboss George just sat in my office and\nliterally talked it out like this no\nagents no lawyers no nothing like I said\nI'd like to leave at this date he\nsaid is there any way I can get you to\nstay to this day I like I can't stay to\nthat day because we've got to resettle\nthe kids have got like they have to\nstart school in September you know and\nand then at one point it was going to be\nMay and then there was like I think\nthere's Golf and Masters and all these\nand we literally just were like okay\nwe'll end it then and that\ngive us the the right Gap and and all of\nthat came from me just saying to Joel's\nlike I I'll live anywh where where like\nwhere do you want to be where do you\nthink it's best for us to be cuz I know\nshe would never make a decision that\nisn't best for the\nkids forget\nme and uh and she was just like I think\nit's time to go home yeah I was like\nthat okay that's it and and I'm\nso I'm\nso grateful that we that we did just in\nmy family before Christmas we had a my\nmom sings in a choir it's not a church\nchoir it's just a choir with some of her\nfriends and we all went out to highwick\nto watch her singing this\nchoir\nI sat in this room in in a in John\nhamen Sports Hall or there you know\ntheater or just a school hall that we\nwere\nin I cried my eyes out I cried I\ncouldn't stop crying because I my\nmom was in this choir with like 40 other\npeople singing Christmas songs and it\nwas so pure\nit was so pure it was so the antithesis\nof what our life have been in Los\nAngeles and I my mom was in the corner\nof this gr you know like and I just she\ncouldn't stop smiling and I just thought\noh my God this Purity that's here these\nare a group of women in and men in their\nI guess they range between 30 to 60\npeople and I just was like this is\neverything I would I don't want to be\nany anywhere else this is I only want to\nbe here and it was so weird it's so\nweird the effect it has on me even now\nsaying I can't understand it I can't\ntell you why I think it just felt in\nthat minute\nlike oh this is the sacri this is why we\nmade what you would perceive to be a\ngreat sacrifice yes this is the\nreason something here that I would never\nsee I would never come back for I would\nnever be part of and then my dad joined\nthem for few numbers playing the\nsaxophone and uh and I just I just was\nlike oh my God this is worth everything\nthis is this is this is everything I\nneed to feed me and my kids watching\ntheir Grandma sing this song I was like\nhow lucky are we to appreciate and have\nthis experience yeah to have come back\nand everyone be healthy you know yeah\nfor sure\nwhat does it take in that in the\nmarriage for that communication for that\neven the fact that you know you're both\nasking each other questions you're both\nchecking in with each other like that's\nnot easy it's challenging yet like what\nis that what has that Taken like from\nboth of you to to really be able to make\nthose big decisions together it's\ntaken\nme learning from my wife that's it\nthat's it\nlike she I think has always known and\nalways figured out how to communicate\nhow to do this and I think I've been\nterrible at it I think I've been rubbish\nat it cuz I think I lived for a very\nlong time an existence of just I nothing\nwill move me from this train I'm on this\nis it oh you're hopping on great but\nthis is this is it's this is the thing\nand actually you then realize that that\nthat isn't the case I mean we don't\nargue very much we really really\ntry to talk in the\nday right to to not make it the last\nthing we\ndo even if you are going to bed with\nlike with you and and it's more her than\nme she's like well I'm going to I can\ntalk to you about that tomorrow you know\nwhat I mean but it's so much better than\nthan going to bed going to\nsleep just don't go to sleep on an\nargument yeah that's the first thing and\nI think I learned\nquite probably halfway through our\nmarriage\nthat that\nactually if all you're doing and this is\nthis is an almost impossible thing to do\nbut if you but if you're at least trying\nto you're pretty much there is if you're\ngoing well if if all you're trying to do\nis meet your partner's needs then all\nyours inter will be met they just will\nlike how many times do we hear it's\nfunny we had a friend of ours or a\nfriend of my wife's their friends of\nours but you know if we ever broke up\nshe'd get\nher you know oh man now you've got me\nthinking about all our friends oh divide\nit up it's quite a fun game I think I\nthink my wife's gonna take it's quite a\nfun game but uh it and uh and she was\nsaying this a few years ago now she was\nlike he just never does anything for me\nhe never he never surprises me and takes\nme out for dinner he never says oh like\noh I'm you know buy a theater ticket he\nnever says oh Friday night me and you\nlet's do this and I just went well when\ndo you do it how often do you do that\nand she went well I don't and I was like\nright but you have to see that that\nmight be a yeah that that might be a for\nall we know he's sat somewhere now going\nshe never takes me out she never CU\nlet's go to the cinema and she was like\noh and I and and and that's it in its\nmost Bas level I think that's probably\nthe the thing I've learned the most yeah\nI love hearing about your relationships\nand the way you talk about your\nrelationships obviously this whole shift\nin your life is because of your\nrelationships and so it's it's so\nwonderful to hear about it and you were\nyou were giving me credit earlier for\nyou know hopefully changing\nconversations around masculinity but I\nthink you did that very much so as well\nwith uh your Bromance comic relief\nvideos with David Beckham and I'd always\nappreciate those when they came out and\nI know you guys have a real Bromance but\nbut seeing it on screen was always a\nreal treat uh whether you doing the\nCalvin Klein ads together or whether you\nknow or doing each other's nails or\nwhatever it was it was it was it was so\nfunny uh and you went to the premere\nrecently of his documentary which I\nthought was just yeah it's brilliant\nphenomenal I read bex's biography when\nautobiography when I was like 15 or\nsomething and it was life-changing I\nloved it and getting to what's the doc\nwas honestly reliving it again ah I mean\nwhat a story what a story right just\njust the whole thing when I watched it\nit really really reminded me have you\never watched Aaron\nsains commencement speech at Syracuse\nUniversity I have not no I have not\nactually me saying you know when I get\nmy driver's license my life will be like\nthis he actually says that in that\nspeech he he he talks about that and and\nI think and that was the first time I\nrealized that like oh that's what I have\nalways done his commencement speech at\nSyracuse University is brilliant okay as\nyou can imagine it's just so brilliantly\nwritten and he delivers it it's\nexceptional it's my favorite thing to\nwatch on on YouTube is people's comments\naddresses and his is particularly good\nand I would urge anybody to to go and to\ngo look at it I I use it I quote it I\nit's fed into me you know and he says a\nbrilliant line and it it really\ncame to the Forefront of my mind\nwatching the Beckham documentary where\nhe says the world doesn't care how many\ntimes you get knocked down so long as\nit's one less than the amount of times\nyou get back up again and that's what I\nthink the Beckham do is yeah it is a\nstory of a man who just doesn't doesn't\nstop he just gets back up and he carries\non and that's what it's about you could\nyou you could say it's about the first\nSportsman to become a global brand and\nicon you could talk about it's the first\nfamily to\nhave become perhaps in Britain outside\nof the royal family a family of intrigue\nand interest you could say it's a story\nabout Fame and Sport it's not I think\nit's a story of someone who just kept\ngoing through adversity through\nchallenges just got up and carried on\nand that's why I think it's resonated so\nmuch with people because it's\ninteresting I don't know if you found\nthis but like it's interesting being\nBritish and watching it yes yes so then\nbecause because people in America are\nlike I had no ideaa oh my God those\nfootball those soccer\nfans the way they were with him and\nyou're like yeah no I know I remember\nthe Effigy yeah yeah all of it you know\nand then and then Greece and the like\nthat's where sport though can transcend\neverything it's like it's it's why I\nthink Sport and\nmusic I think sport stars and musicians\nare I think their Fame is so different\nto actors and performers and hosts and\nwriters I think their Fame is something\ndifferent because they give you moments\nthey give you moments in like and I and\nreally what I put those moments down to\nis they made you feel less alone that's\nactually what it is it's why our\nrelationship with singers and art and\nrecording artists is so personal because\nI was in this play called The History\nBoys and it was written by Alan Bennett\nand there was a a speech that Richard\nGriffith used to deliver every night and\nhe'd\nsay the best moments in poetry or when\nyou think a thought or a feeling is\nparticular to you and then suddenly\nsomeone who is long dead you may will\nnever meet no he say someone who you\nwill never meet perhaps even long dead\nhas written down the very thing you're\nfeeling and it's like a hand has reached\nout and take yours and it says to you\nyou're not you're not on your own you're\nnot on your own that's a great bit in a\nJohn lenon documentary where there's a\nguy saying to John Lennon my that song\nyou\nwrote but it's you know that that was\nabout me it's about me that's that's how\nI am and in John Lennon's going they're\njust songs they're just songs it isn't\nthat and he's going no but it is you\nwrote that about me CU you can't know\nhow I felt and so I think you you don't\nsuddenly you feel very alone you hear\nsomething and you realize you're not and\nthen I think sport when David\nBeckham curled that free kick in the top\nCorner which we qualified for the World\nCup it did not matter Tory\nConservative Republican Democrat left\nright all the stuff the divisions\neverything suddenly yeah and you're\nhugging people you don't know you've\nnever met and you're you're brought\ntogether and you're not alone anymore\nand that's where I think Sport and music\nis such a powerful thing in our lives\nwhich you don't feel when you watch a\nfilm you can watch a film or a TV show\nand go oh yeah that was amazing even if\nit moved you hugely that connection\nisn't the same I don't think that's why\nyou gave him an ugly statue of\nhimself for all of that made was that oh\nmy god I've watched that a million times\nat that that day man that was so much\nfun that was just you know cuz pranks\nthey're the worst thing to film they're\nawful because they could just go wrong\nat any point they could go wrong one\nnotice of a camera and hundreds of\nthousands of dollars gone yeah and my\nGod that day just worked out in the best\nway it was G it's so good if anyone's\nnot seen it it's so good like if if you\nwatch the doc and you love David Beckham\nand you love what does you have to go\nand see it it's just you made the\nugliest statue one of the best looking\nmen well I had the idea because do you\nremember the real Renaldo won do you\nremember that so then it was like I\nremember going into going into Ben's\noffice and going because I think if if\nthey hadn't done that with Ronaldo in\nreal life I don't think David would have\nbelieved it right right yeah but it was\nbecause it happened in real life with\nCristiano Ronaldo that we were like oh\nhang on we could do this I never thought\nwould work as well as it did yeah and\ncredit I have to say to the to the\nactors in that sketch I mean just just\nbrilliant perfect yeah Manchester\ncity that was that was brilliant it's\namazing it's amazing it's amazing walk\nme through that what you just said now\nthat you in that space six months you're\nreflecting figuring it out we're waiting\nfor that next\nballoon we've let the other balloon go\nwhat does James cordon's creative\nprocess Stillness waiting for the idea\nbuilding an idea look like what does\nthat look like where does that where\ndoes inspiration strike where does it\ncome from where do you seek it when\nyou've let go of something without\nknowing what's\nnext what I'm really\ntrying to do\nnow\nis\nnot rush anything I spent a long time\nsqueezing so many things in that\nactually now I I I just sort of think\nwell don't force an\nidea to be the whatever it is that you\nthat you might you know write or do or\nbut then at the same time I think what I\nhave to really be conscious of now is to\nnot be too afraid to not be too scared\nto do anything because I think I've been\nso\nenjoying this feeling of not being on TV\nevery day and putting out content on\nwhether it's YouTube or you know social\nI'm so aware of how much was just being\npushed out all the time and that can\ncome with so much stuff totally It's\ngood to sit and wait but then don't be\nscared to do it don't be scared of the\nthe the failure of it I I I've only took\na screen grab sure I think it's the guy\nwho's the new CEO of Vans shoes yes yes\nI think okay we used to work at UH\nLogitech and it says here I've just got\nthe screen grab which ran for a decade\nand which he ran for a decade and he\npenned a Dr Seuss like poem titled The\nSecret of success oh sorry the secret to\nsuccess avoid it it reads in part\nsuccess makes you fearful of losing your\nplace of gambling with stature of losing\nyour face and it is there is an element\nof that which I feel of like well\nthere's a very very very real chance\nthat you do\nsomething and it's\n you know and all the greats have\nhad that they've all done that oh my God\nbut I think that's why I was so Keen to\neven in this period to make this this\npodcast called this life of mine to like\ngo well no I I know I know what this is\nlike this this idea of this podcast is\nan idea I had when I was 16 MH and I\nwrote it out wow I love that I wrote it\nout and it was called Planet lovely MH\nthat's name now it's called Planet\nlovely because do you remember they used\nto be a TV show uh on TV on BBC 2 when\nwe were growing up uh called Room 101\nyeah of course so Room 101 was a show\nwhere people would take things they\nhated in life yeah and they would be\nthey would put them into room 101 and\nthey'd be gone forever it was a really\nfunny show it was a brilliant show and\npremise and I was like\n16 I was like well this is\ngreat wouldn't it be brilliant to make a\nshow which is just people talking about\nthings that they love Yeah and things\nthat are really significant in their\nlife beautiful and I wrote this like\nthing yeah this planet lovely it's not\ncalled Planet lovely anymore came to the\ncame to the decision that that's a a not\ngreat\nbut I was like why don't we just have\npeople talk about yeah things that are\nsignificant in their life whether it's a\nfilm a a place a person a memory a\npossession a song and uh and and and the\nreal the you know I really really wanted\nto do it so I was like I can I create\nsomething in a completely different\nmedium that\nfeels almost the antithesis of what the\nLate Late Show was it's it's completely\ndifferent it's calm and it's quiet and\nit's soft and it's people talking about\nthings that they love or that were\nmoments in their life and like some of\nthe stuff that we've heard has just been\ngreat so I've really loved that\ncreativity I loveed the creativity of\njust I don't you know like we going to\nput this on Sirus XM and hopefully\npeople find it and hopefully it will be\njust a piece of Joy it'll be a warm hug\non a Sunday afternoon and that would be\na lovely thing to put out into the world\nbut that's a sort of uh gestation period\nof 30 years I don't think I should do\nthat again yeah yeah but I do think what\nI'd really love to do is try and write\none more thing yeah I'd love to try and\nwrite one more thing I'd love to write\nagain with Ruth Jones who I wrote Gavin\nand Stacy with I I I love her so much\nshe\nis and has\nbeen a a constant in my life as a friend\nand you want to talk about a long\nfriendship you\nknow and so I'd love to try and write\nsomething else with her I don't know\nwhat that'll be I don't even know if\nwe'll ever if we'll do it I don't know\nbut you know we we do we do have chats\nabout yeah maybe this is a thing you\nknow yeah so that that's what I'd really\nlove to do it's just Have you listened\nto Bradley Cooper talk about making mro\nmro yeah I did every where he really\njust made a decision to give himself\nover\nentirely for three\nyears to that project to just go what\ndoes it feel like actually to not move\nfrom one thing to the next to be here\nthere doing this doing that what is it\nwhat do it feel like to just give myself\nover in every way to the point where I\nimagine a lot of people around him on\nthat set were earning more financially\nbut like as a as a as a challenge to\ngive himself over to it in the most\nbeautiful way I think\nis it's so inspiring to watch and I\ndon't know if I've ever done that I\ndon't I know I haven't done that I never\nlike that on that level but like I don't\nthink I've\never completely just given myself over\nto something\nand seeing it through from\ninception to pushing it on the water and\nletting other people decide whether it's\ngood or not and seeing who I am the\nother side of it like that's I\nthink that would be a\nreally good thing to to do like I might\ngo to I might go there's this I just\nfound this like seven weekend course at\nthe film School in beckfield or seven or\nI don't know how many days I that might\nbe wrong but I like I think oh maybe\nI'll maybe I'll do that I wouldn't mind\ndoing some acting classes I didn't I\njust wouldn't mind\njust going well can I I wonder if\nthere's one more thing yeah and if there\nisn't how lucky was I yeah you know but\nI really feel like I I might be getting\nto a spot where I might have something\nto say\nyeah James you are\nyou're very unique and uh\nextremely extremely thoughtful and\nconscious and so honest and genuine it's\nit's been such a treat talking to you\nhonestly like genuinely just sitting\nwith you and I know that I'm listening\nto an actual stream of\nConsciousness more than curated answers\nand you know it's it's really powerful\nit's been really really special and I\nwant to thank you for giving me this\nspace holding this space and trusting me\nwith it I mean what I I mean it it's a\nit's a real thrill to uh to sit and chat\nwith you it's it's it's it's great it's\nit's a lovely thing you've created here\nit's brilliant it's really brilliant\nwhat you're doing I'm so uh it's strange\nI don't know if you feel this but I feel\nlike there's a strange thing with like\nBrits that go to America cuz it's only\nlike there's only a handful of us who\nknow how hard it is and how vast that is\nis so like when I look at when I look at\nyour stuff and I see the things that\nyou're putting out and like I think I\nwalked past like a huge billboard of you\nthe other week and I was like and I\ndon't we've never met but we have\nfriends in common and I was\nlike yeah I was like I was like G on boy\nyeah not when I get to work yet this is\ngreat I was like you're from you're from\nwood green is wood green yeah you're\nfrom wood green look at him I'm very\nproud of you with no reason to\nbe no mate I I appreciate it and uh you\nknow offline today and online you've\ngiven me a lot of mentorship and\ncoaching that I'll take on and I'll\npractice in my life honestly that you've\nleft me with some really thoughtful\npieces of insight but we end every show\nwith a final five and these are the Fast\nFive which are answered in one word to\none sentence maximum of course and so\nand I'll ruin that rule every time\nbecause you give such wonderful answers\nbut we'll try we'll start abely we'll\nstart there James these are your Fast\nFive first question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever heard or received to\nask yourself is this of my\nconcern right I'm going to break it\nalready but I really think that phrase\nis one of the most important things you\ncan hang on to is to just\ngo there's there's a great power in\nbeing able to\nsay that's none of my concern it's more\npolite than saying I don't care it's\nmore truthful than saying it's nothing\nto do with me because sometimes it will\nbe to do with you but is it of your\nconcern do you need\nto engage with it you just\ngo sorry what was that someone say\nsomething think about it oh that's none\nof my\nconcern and carry on I love that super\nsuper powerful okay question number two\nwhat is the worst piece of advice you've\never heard or\nreceived oh\njeez oh God it's weird you know I think\njust do it right yeah the Nik the Nike\nif you're in America and the Nike if\nyou're in England uh Britain the I think\njust do it is a brilliant slogan right I\nthink it's one of the most powerful\nslogans in the world and what makes it\nso powerful is the is the Full Stop is\nthe period just do it mhm right just do\nit great but that can really have other\nconnotations so I would say I would say\ndon't just do it ask whether you want to\ndo it yeah and do you really want to do\nit yeah and then do it like I love I\nlove how you just went up against the\ngreatest slogan of all time I do think\nit's a masterpiece I just sometimes\nthink yeah because it's like uh you know\nI would say like you know crystal meth\ndon't just do it\ndon't just do it really don't just do it\nyeah I love it now the new one when we\ngo walking B to the night store in\nEngland it's going be do you really want\nto do it ask yourself seriously do you\nreally want to do it and if the answer\nis yes yeah just do\nit I love it I love it I'm looking\nforward to seeing that billboard with\nyou on it it's not as Snappy I don't\nknow if it'll really take\noff uh question number three how would\nyou define your current purpose I think\nmy current\npurpose is to let it be MH and accept\nwhatever it is MHM and that's not work\nthat's life accept all of it don't get\ncaught up in what you thought something\nshould be just accept what it is and\nrealize how incredibly amazing it is to\njust be alive\nbrilliant question number four what does\nit feel like when Tom Cruz says to you\nyour life is more valuable than his\nfeels like a lie\n[Laughter]\nJay feels like a yeah it feels like a\nlie and I think I knew that at the time\nyeah but you believed it but he I mean\nman he could say anything and I believe\nhim he you know anything at all like the\nguy is just\nexceptional oh my God amazing yeah\nSpecial uh Fifth and final question\nwhich we asked every guest who's ever\nbeen on the show if you could create one\nlaw that everyone in the world had to\nfollow what would it be I think the law\nshould be for every minute you spend on\nsocial media that when you come off the\napp you're not allowed back on for that\nmany\nminutes so if you go on for an hour\nyou're locked out for an hour if you're\non for two minutes you're locked out for\ntwo minutes and I believe that should be\nthe absolute law I don't prescribes this\nnotion that these things should be\nbanned I think it's insane to think that\nI just think that actually we regulate\nthe speed on the road we\nregulate uh what age you are when you\ncan vote what age you are when you can\nget married have a child do a drink\nalcohol all these things and actually I\nthink one regulation would be that yeah\nyou know yeah you could you could SP if\nyou need to spend seven hours on it the\nsecond it's dormant for a minute you're\nlocked out for seven hours and I think\npeople would be I think it would be\ngreat I think it would be brilliant that\nis genius that's my that's my genius we'\nnever had anything like that on the show\nthat is it once to to I was at some\nconference thing uh interview in quite a\nprominent sort of Silicon Valley yeah\ntype you know CEO and I pitched this as\nan idea in the room and it did not go\ndown they did not respond as well as you\nall they were like well that's why would\nwe ever do that we are monetizing every\nall of their time we want all of their\ntime James we don't want some of their\ntime we want to steal it all\noh I I'm the opposite I'm thinking how\ndo we make that happen like what that\nthat's brilliant I think it's a really\ninteresting thing to play with because\nagain it's not I'm on a diet I'm I'm on\na detox I'm on it's not you know it's\nnot going this is awful this you know be\non it for seven days and I think all of\nthese things all of these things social\nmedia the Stu like you know the way\npeople the way that you know the new\nthing where we talk about Ai and it's\nlike of course it's terrifying it's also\ngoing to be miraculous and Brilliant so\nnothing's nothing is all bad nothing is\nall good no one is all bad no one is all\ngood it's impossible but what you can do\nis regulate these things in a sense and\nif that was just the we would all accept\nit we'd all accept it and I'm sure\nsomeone somewhere will find a hack that\nmeans you can't but on the whole people\nwould just go along with it and they I\ncan't open I'll open it in a minute yeah\nand then they would stop and look up and\nrealize that actually maybe maybe out\nhere can nourish me more than it does in\nthere it's very hard to leave in there\nwhen it's always there James your world\nclass uh this life of mine is available\nright now wherever you listen to\npodcasts uh Sirus right is Sirus XM yeah\nSirus XM and so I hope you guys\nsubscribe follow uh and look out for an\nepisode I'm
