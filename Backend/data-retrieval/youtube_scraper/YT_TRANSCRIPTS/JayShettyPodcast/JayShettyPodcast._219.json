that lesson you will meet\nit again Oscar winning actor writer\ndirector producer please welcome Daniel\nKya anything I'm doing now I've been\ntold I can't do I've told I can't act\ntalk to some people then they were like\nyou ain't going to make it I so well I\nthink I\ncan before we jump into this episode I'd\nlike to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the well to me the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nshett J shett the one the only J\nsh I always like starting with this\nquestion because I think I'm intrigued\nto see where you take it like what would\nyou say is your earliest childhood\nmemory that defines who you are today\nthere's one yeah there was one I grew up\nquite a fat kid yeah and we used to go\nScouts Cubs and Scouts you go into like\nI don't know some random place in the\ncountry so I got into a camping or\nsomething and then like there's potholes\nyou know about potholes you go in there\nboom boom it's like guy running through\nrunning through potholes yeah and then\nlike I'm doing this PO I'm going in and\nlike everyone starts laughing cuz I'm\nfat everyone's like oh like Dan's not\ngoing to fit that's not going to fit I\ngot in there and then halfway through it\ngets narrower and narrower and I proper\ndidn't and they looked in bunch of kids\nwere like I must have been 98 they were\nlike he's filled with the whole thing\nthey're just laughing laughing laughing\nlaughing laughing and then I was like\nall right cool I can't really go back so\nit's only really and I'm actually have\nfilled it so then I was like all right\ncool and I just found a way to I was\njust like I knew how to like change my\nbody and go I'm going to get out I'm\ngoing to do it I'm going to do it I'm\ngoing to do it I'm going to do it and\nthen I realized they were laughing and\nthen as I was getting closer closer to\nthe exit they just stopped laughing they\nstopped laughing they stopped laughing\nand then by the end they\nclapped and I think after I was like\nright yeah I don't know I looked back\nand go I think it really\nchanged how I saw everything my life I\ngo BR what what is what what are you to\nme what I'm saying it's like I kind of\nfelt had the energy I was like just push\nthrough just do what supposed to do just\ndo what you're supposed to do and you\nget to the end and people that will say\nthings that will tell you say you're\nweird say you're odd by the end of it\nnot that little clap you can make them I\ndon't know it doesn't matter about them\nit just matters about you getting there\nyou what I'm saying and I think few\nyears ago before then I really cared\nabout the clap I really car like I'm\ngoing to make you clap I'm pissed but\nI'm going to make you clap I think in\nthat moment I saw my\ncharacter I saw what I'm actually about\nin that moment and yeah and then they\njust respected me yeah that's and the\nend it was what I gained respect so yeah\nyeah and you think that that still\napplies today in all ways yeah man like\ndo you know how many people say you\ncan't do\nsomething everything's made up what have\nyou been told that you couldn't do name\nit like anything I'm doing now I've been\ntold I can't do it I've told I couldn't\nact I wouldn't be able to make a career\nout of it connections was on Parkway\nlike in Camden connection yeah they were\nlike saying and my mom was just stressed\nlike you want to act talk to some people\nthen they were like you ain't going to\nmake it I said well I think I can I want\nto SP 15 I think can you know no no no\nno so it's all that kind of stuff like\nyou're consistently kind of told that\nlike it won't happen and I just didn't\nbelieve that so that's why I really\nwould keep it secret what I was doing on\nmy dreams on my hopes on like hopes like\nwhat I see like\nif I can see it that means I can do it\nso it's more that like every everything\neverything like you told you can't do\neven like being away from race even the\nclass that I'm come from like saying oh\nyou can't do that what you talking about\nit's nuts like I just I've always just\nbeen like yeah but then that was very\nmuch the mentality of my school like it\nwas where he like all right cool you\nain't got money all right cool let's\nsell chocolate bars all right cool let's\nsell crisps right it's just like you got\nto make it work no matter what so I've\nalways come I feel like I've come from\nthat\nyeah did you find that keeping it secret\nwas useful yeah cuz it me meant that I\nwas able to fail in private and just\ngrow at my own pace and have it and and\nbasically what it was I realized in\nhindsight and acting and writing all\nthis kind of stuff I realized I found\nwhat it meant to me I found what my\ndefinition of it is I found my style I\nfound what I liked that was so it was\nmine it wasn't like oh I got it from\nhere I got it from there now this is\nwhat I think this is how I've got to\nthis so that's like why I'm happy I did\nit cuz I felt like in hindsight I felt I\nwas a bit too ahead of people that I was\naround in terms of what I was focused on\ncuz it's quite odd if I think about\nthink back I was like yeah no I'm going\nto do this\noh like is that you mean like no one in\nmy family is doing it no one no one's\ndoing it but I just think I can do you\nwhat I'm saying so it's like um so I\nthink it's it's that yeah yeah where did\nthat belief come from at that age at 15\nto go I can even though no one's saying\nit like where where did that inspiration\ncome from was it was it from what you\nwere watching Fresh prins was watching\nlike Wayne's Brothers I was watching\nlike I don't know sponge no SpongeBob a\nbit past um Simpsons maybe Simpsons Ed\nand Eddie like I was watching Ed and\nEddie yeah I was watching life like\nsaying I wasn't really like I don't know\nI just\nbelieved I don't know I just kind of was\nlike no I don't believe you yeah I don't\nknow you like back in the day I was like\nlike see remember John Major yeah\nMinister was they said he told me to do\nsomething I'm like but I don't know\nhim I can he how can someone I don't\nknow tell me what to do yeah kind of\nnuts if I know someone like you mean\nit's like yeah so that's why I was like\nI just always you know I realized I\nthink I just I'm blessed I have faith\nand I think I just have faith and I\nrealized I read something the other day\nand I think the difference between faith\nand delusion is God and I'm not saying\nthat oh God it's just like I just have\nfaith like I just had faith I just just\nbelieved and I think maybe I saw my\nfamily doing amazing things like not\namazing things in a sense that like\nmaking something work or going for a\nholiday or they just didn't accept they\nall right cool then like say wanted to\nact all right cool you can't afford that\nbut we can do this they just pushed on\nthey didn't they didn't let the\nenvironment or the boundaries Define\nwhat they thought was possible in their\nmind so I think it was that right B yeah\nI love that I love hearing that your\nparents were saying yes and like it\nwasn't like no but it was yes and right\nmy mom was just like yo what like how\nare we going to like how are we going to\ndo this she would challenge me always\nchallenge me and then I said oh this is\nthis is this but I realized she was just\nlike going trying to test me if I really\nbelieved in it and then and then\nagain I I probably needed that I did\nneed that cuz I needed to know it for my\nI was aware of it so then I was like all\nright cool this is what's going to\nhappen and then she okay I believe you\nlet's go like this is the way I know\nthis is the way I know I can make it\nwork so I think it was just\nlike I just I just believed I don't know\nwhere it comes from I think it's just a\ngift in it I just I just try and honor\nit and try and do good with it I don't\ntry and\nlike intellectualize it yeah I'm saying\nyeah yeah I get that man I get that that\nmakes sense and obviously like I I heard\nI was watching your hot ones which I\nloved and uh on there you talked about\nhow like you wrote your first piece when\nyou were nine years old and I was\nthinking it's amazing now because with\nthe work that you're doing now with the\nkitchen and like production and writing\nlike you're kind of almost doing this\nfull circle piece why was writing where\nyou started because I don't think a lot\nof people know that like I didn't know\nthat as well like I've discovered you as\nan actor and and loved your work but\nlike what was it about writing that Drew\nDrew you to it N9 years old and tell us\nabout that piece too I know I know I\nknow um I thought know I was at school\none time this before this play\ncompetition which is one our one at\nnight I was at school one time and they\nthe teacher told me to write something\nand in my in my heart I knew I can do\nthis sick I know I could do the sick and\nI wrote something I thought it was\namazing yeah the teacher gave me a\nrubbish grade I'm like you're wrong I\nthink you're wrong like I really like\nthis and then like that that competition\nwas just basically like a playwriting\ncourse they come to your school in\nCamden Roy Williams who's a really big\nplayr now was a teacher then and then\nlike a teacher shamed me and was like oh\nlike like Daniel you're messing about I\nwas I was mischievous like you're\nmessing\nabout I'm like n I'm like I don't like\nthis and then so I was like all right\ncool and I was like all right cool I'll\nshow you I'll show you then I wrote his\nplayers based on Kean and Kell about\nthese guys that work in the shop love\nand they just had a friendship and then\nlike I got to the next round it was a\ncouple of in the next round and then I\nwas just right and then those guys\nJonathan Sid and Roy were like they I\nknew at that time they knew and they I\nfeel like they knew I had something cuz\nI just felt the energy of them I was\nlike yeah I just this what I think cuz I\nhad feel I don't know and then like then\nI won it then my whole school year came\nto hampon theater watch it it's in my\nArsenal top I got a picture now I'm just\nflexing and then like uh and then yeah I\nmean they told me like keep going keep\ngoing I'm like I'm going to play out I'm\nnot going to\nright and then I I did a play for Roy\nWilliams Sucker Punch like when I was 21\nand remember he told me after it yeah he\nwas like yeah do you know that the\nteachers didn't want to pick you they\nwere like don't he too bad don't he too\nbad and then Roy was like I'm definitely\ngoing to pick him so I was just that was\na kind of like I had that antagonistic\nenergy in class but I just I don't know\nI just I knew how to I Knew dialogue I\nknew how people spoke but I think a lot\nof it to do because I was like in my\nfamily didn't speak my language M so\nthen I would like sit at family events\nand I'm be like watching you I mean I\ncan see that in handset like I would\nobserve and I would like peace and I\nknow how to pick tone and energy and I\nfeel it cuz I have to you know what I'm\nsaying so I think that's where it came\nfrom and then um I stopped and I got\npicked it back up at 16 to to get back\nin the game but during that time I got\ninto acting and and I got into act to\nimprov which is actually writing on your\nfeet\nso then I was honing that skill set so\nwhen I got back to playwriting again it\nwas\neasy tell us about some of the Improv\nbecause I feel like that's such a\nfascinating skill I love how you said\nwriting on your feet that's a that's a\ncool way of thinking about it and I feel\nlike improv almost demands so much from\nan artist in a way that other work\ndoesn't how how would you is there is\nthere like a funny moment of improv that\nyou did with a group or or something a\nstory that you went through that you're\nlike oh I remember that and that was a\nmoment where I was like oh I can write\non my feet I can actually do this I\nthink I I think I think he was messing\nabout in class and then um Evelyn taught\nme and\nMarcus they were just like you guys are\nmessing about we's in a community class\nAnish he's in a community class then if\nyou're good enough to get to the yps\nyoung professionals and then like he was\njust like oh like you guys don't get it\nand then they went on stage and they\njust acted and I watched it and I was\nlike copy I okay I understand what\nyou're doing I understand and then after\nthat point I got it CU I needed to see\nit\ngo all right Ka I'll get you I'll get\nyou get you what I love about it is that\nyou just let it go you're not holding on\nI have moments that my friends remind me\nif I see them go oh yeah remember you\nbrought out that\niron you mean as a prop but it's I just\nhad this rule is like once you're in\nyour head you're dead yeah yeah so you\njust got and also is like it's like what\nyou said like improv is yes and so you\ncan't reject you know what I'm saying so\nit's just like if someone says something\ncrazy you just got to go with it you\nwhat I mean you go oh yeah yeah yeah and\nthen also if someone doesn't know how to\ndo it I learned how to drive it so say\nif you didn't know how to do it I be\nlike yeah like why you not didn't like\nthat why you not and I'll have to\nresponding because I'm agreeing with you\nabout what I'm agreeing with you based\non what you said about um what exactly\ndid I say then yeah and then yeah yeah\nand then yeah and then you build me and\nthen like you clock how to like yeah and\nthat's real dialogue too right exactly\ncuz you're listening you're interrupting\nand listening you're not just but you're\nthen by doing that you're playing a\ncharacter doesn't listen or listen too\nclosely that they don't they're hearing\nthey're not listening they're trying to\nfind and then so you're building that\ncharacter through those interactions and\nthen you're honing it through the\ninteractions and then you land like cool\nbang so it's like so that's how I kind\nof learn how to do it more it's more\nthat yeah don't it's hard to like scrub\nlike yeah yeah I I don't know why I'm\ngoing down this road but you mentioned\nit and I'm I'm listening so I was like\nyou said you're an Arsenal fan yeah go\nah I'm a United fan\n[Laughter]\nyou've been an Arsenal fan forever\nwhat's what's been your favorite team at\nArsenal over the years oh man I'd have\nto say like\num my favorite was Adams right yeah Keon\nwi over Mars win but that was crazy this\n98 like come on man PTI that that was\nlike that was like but that's when I\nfell in love you what I'm saying I was\nlike these are my guys like everyone was\njust just everyone was just firing so I\njust I just I don't know and also it's\nmy local team is it so then it was just\nlike says if we won a cup the area was\nhappy yeah you I mean it's not like\nthat's what it came from it's like say\nit was a time we didn't win a cup for\nnine years and then we did FA Cup and I\nwatched it at Hall and all that kind of\nstuff and and then next day it was like\nit was all Arsenal fans outside the\nwindows people like you know their Dusty\nVans the right in stuff and the dusty\nVans it was just everyone was happy even\nif you weren't ARS F you was just H the\narea was happy\nso it was that was it was a connection\nand then I know it was Co the that I\ncould go to games obvious C games all\nthe other games were hard to get I went\nto mtin ke on testimonia actually but\nlike it was like it was like I don't\nknow you just felt like a community like\nwhen the when thing when they scored\nHigh the upper the upper T would just\nrock yeah you think it would break it's\na bit of danger you know what I'm saying\nit was just it was just like and then it\nwas my mom's friend used to give me\ntickets when she went away so then I\nwatch Like Wicked G games or rubbish\ngames but I was part of it from like\nyoung you what I mean you could get a\nticket even if you couldn't afford it\nyou I mean so it's I just fell in love\nwith it during that age yeah and you had\na lot of happy days but I think you had\na lot of unhappy days as well stress BR\nI don't want to put people out there cuz\nit's a public forum but it was stress it\nwas stress but like I I can I'm very I'm\nI see like I'm very child of venga like\nI can see I'm very stubborn like a very\nlike a lot of how Arsenal is is in me I\nfeel like CU not it's bigger than just\nfootball like they have a philosophy you\nI mean they have a style that era had a\nstyle they had a style and I just\nrespected it you know what I'm saying I\njust and I think it's going to a school\nin ISL and the islon team yeah is the\none and then you're like literally\nlooking at the sun in the paper the next\nday in school and then it's the\ninvincibles and they're talking about\nyour local team it CH it I think it\nmakes you think like yeah we the guys at\nsuch a formative age what mean so yeah I\nthink there a bit of that well that's\nwhere I struggled because so I always\nsay this that every Indian person that\nmoved to England in like the 70s and 80s\nI my dad they only support Manchester\nUnited or Liverpool because those were\nthe big clubs at the time like those are\nthe clubs winning and everything and so\nI support United because of that I never\nlived in Manchester and so I never had a\nhappy day in the town because I to\nalmost have to like shy away from saying\nI was a United fan because I lived right\nin between hibery and Spurs so that's\nwhere I grew up in with green like right\nin between and so I never got to go out\nand celebrate in the town because I\ndidn't live in Manchester and so I was\nlike grew up in fear of like I can't\ntell anyone what I follow and like what\nI do and why isn't there a lot of Indian\nplayers in football I've always wanted\nyou that's a that's a great question you\nknow and I think it's because a lot of\nparents don't you know if a if an Indian\nkid told their parent they wanted to be\na football player I mean I just got to\nlook at these two and go what what do\nyou think what do you think the parents\nwould have said what do you think the\nparents would have said yeah definitely\nnot no matter how good they were I was\ntelling RAB one of our mates his I'm\ncalling him out here his kids like\nsupposedly quite decent at football like\nand I told him yesterday I was like M\nyou got to let this kid Chase football\nlike Chase the Dream and I don't know if\nas a culture I think our parents worked\nso hard and they wanted us to have\nsafety and so they didn't want the kids\nto do anything that felt unsafe so\nacting would also be a noo you don't see\nthat many South Asian people in acting I\nmean it's growing now for sure\nespecially the London scene but acting\nmedia anything that was uncertain or\nunsafe Indian parents generally were\nlike no they didn't want us to be a part\nof it because they just wanted us to not\nhave the struggle they did and so they\nwanted us to feel safety security and so\nif you can get a good job right that\nmakes sense if you could get a good job\nthat paid the bills took care of you\nthey were happy they just wanted you to\nbe safe that's interest I'm interested\nin like how cultural\num values dictate what the paths are\nbecause the demographic there should be\nl in like if you look at it as\ndemographically do you know what I'm\nsaying yeah everyone plays at school and\nthen it gets called off like I remember\nwith my parents too it's like they they\nwant you to play they want you to be\nsporty but they don't want you to take\nit that seriously I had friends at my\nschool that were amazing at Cricket like\nincredible cricket players that were\nplaying for England under 21s England\nunder 18s and then went off to be\naccountants because their parents\nwouldn't let them like you know follow\nthe dream and so it's it's really\ninteresting seeing who pushes back\nthrough that as well like some people\njust go no I'm going to try anyway and\nsome people will fold and and Let It Go\nbut I'm H I'm hoping it changes I'm\nhoping it changes great yeah what were\nwhat were some cultural things that you\nthink held you back I mean you've you've\ntalked a bit about the racism you\nexperienced you know for me when I when\nI was hearing about that I thought that\ndoesn't sound easy when you add it to\nthe other bullying and shaming you were\ntalking about earlier like what was it\nlike navigating\nthat um what specific well you talked\nabout what from what I've heard what\nyou've talked about is like it took you\na long time to realize that you felt\ndarker than the people that you were\naround and so there was this whole and\nyou felt that they made you feel bad for\nthat when I got into secondary and I was\nmore predominantly black school it's\nwhen I realized that I was darker than\nthe average black person that I grew up\naround or I was around and then they\nwould tell me it was a kind of culture\nshock but then I was darker than a lot\nof people in my family so then it was\neven that made me feel bit different and\nso then I was just like oh yeah I don't\nreally know what's going on and then but\nthen obviously\nlike at that age you're going through\nracism but you're in a predominantly\nblack space you're not you're going from\ncolorism and then like you go out of it\nand then I mean like got good grades and\nstart going to a different school like\nmore middle class upper class school\nthen you deal with you see\nracism but you see people do things\nyou're like what's that that's weird\nwhat's that what weird you haven't\nreally felt like you're you've got the\nright to go oh that's that you know what\nI'm saying you ain't got no one to talk\nthat understands what's happening mhm\nthen it just started getting a bit more\nthe more the more like kind of more into\nthe workforce the more that you would\nface it yeah and the more asleep people\nare to it and you go call it out what I\nused to say is that like um cuz one time\nlike I was getting not getting roles cuz\nof acting and that cuz of and then I was\nlike oh yeah I was making all these\nexcuses and then my agent at the time\nwas Irish and he was like yeah well\nDaniel is cuz you're black I said what\ndo you mean it's cuz you're black he\nsaid doesn't have to tellone you should\nbe it doesn't matter you should be black\nI that and I was like allowed to kind of\nlike accept it and then I would tell\npeople it was racism and they kind of\nwould wouldn't believe me then when I\nsaid all my Irish agent said it like oh\nis it so I realizing when you're\nblack you\nfeel you don't have the\ndisease but you feel the dis symptoms\nbut you're not allowed to diagnose it it\nhas to to be someone outside of yourself\nthat says that's what's happening and\nthat means it's more valid you know what\nI'm saying usually the people that is\ncome from because you're seen as too\nbiased because you have the symptoms so\nthat's what I realized about it like\nyou're just going through it you're like\noh bro that's kind of nuts I can't\nreally even say it and that's why\nsubconscious going like yeah if I say it\ngo he's got a chip on his should that's\nwhy they you got a chip on your shoulder\nbro I Ain no chips on my shoulder bro\nlike you I mean it's nuts like it's nuts\nwhat you say and it's like it's common\nand people are like and so I think\nthat's what it is you're like just\nnavigating all of those things like so\nit took me a long took me a long time to\nfigure it out yeah still figuring it out\nyeah I feel like that's something that\nyou don't ever figure out because it's\nlike I love how you described that never\nheard it described like that but the\nidea of how because you have the\nsymptoms you can't be the one to\ndiagnose it but you can't be the one to\nexpress it which feels so difficult\nbecause it's almost like this is my\nreality\nbut you need someone else to validate\nyour reality and that is a that is a\nreally interesting prison to live in all\nright cool so Jay like what you what do\nyou love in life what do I love like\naway from like what you love football\nfootball imagine my comment go all Jay\nwhy do people don't like football yeah\nand I'd be like yeah I don't know so\nwhen people go why people don't like\nblack\npeople why would I know yeah you don't\nknow yeah so then that's I'm saying it's\nlike there's something it's it's a b\nit's gas like\nyeah at the cuz it's like I don't how am\nI supposed to but then when I initiate\nit and say this has happened I'm not\nbelieved but then I'm supposed to report\nabout it when it's happening to me from\nthere to justify what they're\ndoing it's it's a whole like it doesn't\nreally make sense what's happening if I\ngo this was happening no that's not true\nand then they they'll have a whole\nlawyer or someone like a professor whole\ndossier and then now if he says it\nbecause he wrote 80 pages of waffle they\nbelieve him yeah but I told\nyou you're just saying that his wor his\nword is worth more than mine and that in\nthat is\nracism I'll say this it's not worth it's\njust not worth anything to you and I had\nto really learn that my word is worth\nsomething to\nme to me and so then like I just I just\nmove like that so I just don't really\nlike kind of engage with the narratives\ncuz it's just people just making up\nthings that protect what they like about\nit cuz you only things are kept because\nthey like something about it cuz they\ndidn't know get rid of it they would\nchange the culture youve seen how they\nchange other things yeah you change the\nculture there's something that protects\nI feel yeah I find what I'm talking to\nyou I find that you've kind\nof really worked on like making peace\nwith how you feel about yourself and how\nyou feel about your views and how you\nfeel about your art like there seems to\nbe this autonomy and Independence in\nsaying as you were saying earlier even\nwhen you were given a bad grade you were\nlike n Noah but I know this is good and\neven what you were saying before where\nyou were like it gave you space to fail\nin private because you were like no no I\nknow that I'm working on myself so it\nfeels like you've really worked on\nhaving this internal peace how hard is\nthat as your career kind of does the\nopposite right so it's like you're\ngetting more and more focused on giving\nyourself peace which is an amazing skill\nlike I'm I'm loving to see it on display\nand I know everyone's going to\nappreciate seeing it and at the same\ntime it's like you're you're doing\nbigger and bigger things so you're more\nand more exposed to other people's\nopinions how have you managed to or or\nhow are you managing to continue to kind\nof hold on to that core of that\nnine-year-old and that 15y old I mean\nlike I think I always just have it like\nit's just mine yeah so it's not\nsomething but I think it's like what\nhappens is is how I I've done things\nthat causes a rocker so chaos in my\nsphere and so like you just got accept\nthat you're a bit chaotic\nI mean it's like I mean it's like\nthere's something that doesn't mean\nthat's you but there's something there\nthat you have to look at if it's nuts\nyeah like that you have to look okay\ncool like where is that like what's that\nand then you get closer to being cool\nwith it or then it will quiet down but\nthere's something I'm not looking at if\nit goes a bit mad or you care too much\nwhat people think you what I'm saying\nit's like you have to accept that just\ngo cool why is that what's happening\nthere I feel like um but yeah no it's um\nit's been the last few years has been\nit's been wild but like it's been like\nI've done it in a very quiet way it's\nbeen W it's been wild in the sense like\nwhat happens and and stuff like that but\nthat's what happens that like the\nnarratives that have been a part of are\npowerful and like the decisions are made\nto like stand on things that I believe\nin or even basically like a lot of I\nknow what I like and I like what I like\nif people don't like it I'm like ask\nyou're I would want to if I care I would\nwant to know why you don't like it but I\nlike what I like and I I stand on\ndecisions I make and I think then\nthat spreads I don't know maybe it's\nthat's a bit different to what how\npeople handle their careers in this day\nand age so I don't know but that's just\nme guessing I don't have a big landscape\non what every decision people are making\nof course yeah what does it feel like to\nsee some of those like 9-year-old 15y\nold dreams come true like what does that\nfeel like in reality like what does that\nactually look like calm normal I knew\nit um I know it like if I minute I get\nthe idea I'm like all right cool there\nboom that's when I get\nexcited we on let's work to it so when\nyou're working to it when you get there\nit costs so much you know it cost so\nmuch if you want something that like you\nreally want the price is so high that\nyou're just a bit like all right cool\nyou're not seeing it as for the sheen\nthat you saw in the perspective at 15 at\n9: you're seeing it all right that cost\nme this that cost me that I had to wake\nup 4:00 a.m. here I had to do this there\nI had to grind here I to do this n you\nto do this you're seeing the cost it\ntakes you're feeling the cost it takes\nso when you land and arrive cool it was\nturbulence oh you got here I did you\njust did you know what I'm saying and\nand then but the excitement comes from\nlike feeling like you can do it before\nyou see all of it that makes sense like\nthe full kind of picture cuz only seeing\nthe good that's why you go there but\nthen like everything's balanced that's\nall it is it's not like it's bad it's\njust like it's everything yeah yeah I\nlove I love that statement you just said\nlike you only see the good that's why\nyou go there and then when you go there\nyou see all of it but you realized that\nall of it was part of getting you there\nit was never possible to get there\nwithout everything else like it was\nnever and and part of it you don't seen\nthe good cuz that like entices you it's\nlike what people say about sex like how\nsex is like a way for your jeans to keep\ngoing mhm like it's a way it's like a\ncreate the body has created this\norganism to keep going so then you have\nthis pleasure out of it or so it's like\nlike it's kind of like oh you got oh\nyeah and then when you go in there I'm\nnot not saying sex bad\nit's you go you go to full of it you go\nsee fullness of\nit I find it when you go on those\nJourneys yeah there's something about\nthe Badness in it that you have to face\nin yourself and it's whether you take\nthe lesson and if you don't take that\nlesson you will meet it again\nyou will meet again until it lets you go\nand then when you meet and accept it\nsometimes you realize well I've realized\nthat like oh I didn't even want that\ngood\nno part of it was me figuring out\nsomething in me that I didn't really\nknow that I wanted to figure out you\nknow what I'm saying but like was\nprobably the majority of it you what I'm\nsaying and the sex impulse told you go\nthere yeah you what I'm saying it's like\ndo that when did you get you said when\nyou haven't I'm going to do a little bad\nimpersonation but you're like when you\nget the idea it's like boom so where 's\nthe uh where's the definitely from wood\ngreen yeah yeah definitely from wooden\nwhere's the uh when did you get the idea\nfor the kitchen and like because I know\nthat project's taking a long time to\ncome to life right like eight years or\nsomething like seven 10 10 yeah I got\nthe idea in a barber shop in hallay I\nwas sit in the barber shop and then like\nthese guys were talking about taking\nstuff like these highest a million pound\nhighest and this is that the other one\nthey were talking well they were talking\nabout actually doing this yeah yeah they\nwere just chatting I'm like these guys\nare talking and then like this and there\nwas something was on the TV and they\nlike yeah that's that's us that's do\nthat and then I was like that's and then\nin that moment I was like I'd love to\nsee that film of people like going into\nlike diamond sh stores and like robbing\nstuff I was like I'd love to see that\njust in the bar chilling cuz like my\nBara just kept on putting appointments\nbefore me even though I made an\nappointment so I'll be sitting there the\nwhole half a day and then like so then I\nwas like i' love to see that and then\nlike and then I never saw him\nagain ever and I was I was like what\nhappened to him and he's like yeah went\nand then like I was like I couldn't\nshake it I was like it was thrilling but\nthere was a cost and I must like 22 in a\nbarber\nshop like chilling I was like they\nsaying about that then I did a bit more\nresearch and I realized it like oh\nthey're getting paid like they're ping\nstealing millions of pounds worth of\ndiamonds but they're getting paid\n200 I was like something in that that\nsays where we're at in this world MH and\nwhat's going on in London where they\ndon't even know the value of what\nthey're robbing they think it's worth\n200 and they're willing to risk their\nlife and their freedom for it I want to\nknow what what's going on there I just\nkept digging so I just would go down\nthere and then then I'm like where I\ngrew up like how we grew up like\nobviously do like the professional jobs\nlike you do like um Harry and Paul and\nthe psycho vills and that but then I\nwould have like a whole other career\nwhere we just make YouTube videos mhm\nand we just comp with people and just\nmake stuff so then it was a time when\nlike CU I wrote on skins and stuff it\nwas a time everyone wanted to do\nmeetings and talk about what my ideas\nwere and I was like I I'm tired of these\ncoffees man like and so I was like all\nright and I got the team together um\ndirector and a producer and that that we\nthat we was building with and then like\num and then I was like oh let's just\nmake it so I asked my\nBara um he's in the film actually and\nhe's in the film and I asked him is he a\nbarber in the film no no no he's just in\nthe film constantly he's one of the he's\none of the residents he's one of the\nmain residents but this is why this is\nwhy so I went to bar he he closed on\nWednesdays so I was like\nhey bro like I beg you let's use your\nshop cuz I want basically it started as\nReservoir Dogs in the barber shop all\nright so then I was like hey like can we\nuse your shot to shoot he's like yeah\nyeah co co co co cool then I like paying\npeople he said I have free I was like no\nman like please and then he was like OB\ndidn't have a budget I think we like 200\neach and we just shot something\ngot new actors and it new crew and then\nlike and he was like don't cut me out of\nthis don't cut me out of this I was like\nno BR I got you like now when it blows\nkeep me in I need to stay involved I\nsaid no I got you I got you so that's\nhow it kind of started and then it\nevolved it kept on evolving from then\nwow I love that I love hearing how like\nideas come about and I appreciate that\nyou have that memory did you actually\nsit down with people who'd done those\nheists or did you meet some people who\nhad actually gone through with it I met\nthe guys I met the guy I met a couple\nguys that did stuff like that and it was\njust like I think I went there and it\nwas like pretty was pretty simple I\ndon't actually why but it's like for me\nit was about the mentality which I knew\nI understood but it was like kind of\nbeing around with people and\nunderstanding just like hanging with\nthem hanging with them and the people\nthat like in the news and next I are\nchildren with them and they was like\nthis is that and the other but they I\nthink them kind of guys\nlike they we understand each other cuz I\nkind of go into the industry like all\nlisten I'm just doing what I want like\nI'm just going to go in there and I\nthink that's how that's the energy that\nthey have um but yeah now they were\nthey're interesting people what did you\nlearn about them do you feel they were\njust they're just trying to survive or\nthey're trying to or they sold a dream\nor what's kind of\nmotivating them to do that I don't know\nI think they just they just do it CU\nlike it's just what it's part of their\noperation it's what they do is what they\nknow is their reality is their it's\nthat's what they know that's how they've\nchosen five whether they've been the\nolder brother or been the only boy in\nthe family or whatever the reason is\nthat they' gone down that path they did\nit and they have a level of intelligence\nthat means they've been able to organize\nan operation and like talk to people and\ncommunicate and this and that and like I\nlike they they're like but that's\nthey're just doing that in this realm\nyou know what I'm saying it's like I\nfound I found how they think more\ninteresting than what they do and that's\nwhat I wanted to explore in this is like\nexposing the thought and the principles\nbehind how they live and what their\nvalues are and why and how it's\nconnected\nto and if they people are really true to\nit so basically like someone like\nStaples in the film he doesn't do\nanything criminal to per se yeah but\nit's like he has the mentality and the\nvalues what I'm saying is like he's just\ngot he thinks that enemy isn't the other\npostcode or the other block the enemy is\nthe system and he engages with them how\nhe how we would see a a kid like that\nengaged with the other block yeah and\nthe postcode he goes it's you and he\njust engages him like\nthat but that's a powerful energy it's a\npowerful mentality it's a leader yeah so\nI kind of was just interested in that\nand how those people think and how that\ncan be how can\nmotor a kind of like a cultural identity\nand I felt that kind of like London had\nthat energy of like bro we do what we\nwant like if you're really from there if\nyou're really from there and I feel you\nhave that energy but you you're just a\nmonk and that you know I mean you're\nlike\nZen but you're like hey it's me but it's\nlike you're doing it for good things but\nit's like I think London is a I always\nthought London was a special City yeah I\ndo too a very special City but our\nsometimes our humility and the class\nceiling yeah stops us from\nlike doing what we want to do people oh\nthere's a glass ceiling and I'm like\nit's made of\nglass you can break it\nit's like made get something yeah you\nmean and I feel like what I was around\nwas basically what I grew up around was\nthat mentality we're going to make it\nwork we're going to make it happen and\nnot in an arrogant way we just cuz we\nwant it to happen yeah we just we mean\nit in sincerity we mean it we just want\nit to happen yeah and like it's more\nthan us and I feel like London and then\nI researched about London about the\nBlitz and how the mentality of like um\nwhen London was bombed for the first\ntime how like people were scared and\nthen after it they were like oh we\nsurvived yeah and how it built a\nresilience in the city like a kind of\nresilience that I feel like is still\nhere but because of the class system\nthat keep calm carry on mentality we\nkind of squash it and\nlike like a very like Regional with how\nwith our dreams we think oh yeah if we\ngot this then that's enough because said\nperson said that's all you can get who\nis this person that's how I feel who who\nare you to limit me that doesn't make\nsense to me yeah do you think people are\nscared to dream or is it scared to or\nthey accepting a limit or what what how\nwould you one of the big moments I had\none of the big breakthroughs I feel in\nthe script was like randomly like so\nlike I did Black Mirror was like 22 four\nyears later like it blew in America yeah\nI mean it's not it went ni in America\nNetflix was wasn't a thing so I did that\nI did this TV show on the and then um I\ndid a thing that it crossed over in\nAmerica so I was in New York and then\nlike um it was years after I did it it\nwas May of a Pacquiao fight R then so I\nI had a photo shoot so I stayed at a\nphoto shoot and I was like I've got to\nwatch the fight here so I stayed in this\nflat in bed I was\nchilling and then I was just I was in\nNew York like I was in New York going to\nI went to the church went to the brunch\nI was going everywhere I was I was\nrolling went to the parties went to\neverywhere and then I was like and I was\nand then I was walking around and\nthere's a massive poster of Biggie in\nBrooklyn and I looked at it I was like\nthey really love themselves this is\nsomeone that's come from there and\nthey've pushed that I don't\nthink n would we wouldn't see our heroes\nof now on that pedestal on that platform\nwe wouldn't see them\nas who they are of time said huh I came\nback home and I used to like go C pool\nbut I used to run from my place to go\nCali pool I used to got a lot of things\nfrom my drugs so I'd run there 10-minute\nJ and I would look around I'm like the\nsame demographic as New York literally\nsame demographic what's the\ndifference why is New York feel like New\nYork New York and then London Phils and\nI was just running running around I was\nlike these guys don't believe in\nthemselves I going believe in myself and\nI think my career shifted but also I\nthink the I just feel I want that for\nLondon yeah I want that we're Global\nwe're playing World Class rent mhm I\nwant world class results from this city\nyou know what I'm saying so like but for\nwhatever reason we're just like go no no\nno it's like I just don't I don't\nbelieve in that I don't believe in that\nand I feel like New York has just decide\nwith is and I think if londoners decide\nwith this I think everything will\nflourish and I think a lot of it came\nfrom that if we're being honest about\nwho we are as opposed to kind of hiding\nand kind of suppressing and kind of just\nkeep calm har on Sheen that we're\npretending to be where we're actually as\na culture very qu cocky or sure about\nwho we are what we stand for even the\nfact that like when you grow up in\nLondon like you really still stay\nhanging out with your friends that you\ngrew up with do you what I'm saying it's\nlike it's your because that's what it is\nyou know what I mean and and um that's a\nis a level of conviction and values that\nI feel we're not honest about publicly\nand I want I wanted more I wanted more\nfor London yeah I love that man I I\nrelate to so much of that as someone who\nconsiders myself through and through\nLondon born raised University School\neverything all my best friends are here\nyou know and obviously I don't live here\nanymore but when I'm back it's like to\nme yeah London raised me and you have\nthat kind of affinity to this city in\nsuch a special way but yeah I feel\nsimilar to you that I feel often people\nthink if you if you dream bigger or you\nthink Beyond or you are pursuing the\nLimitless it's most seen as less than\nit's seen as like no no no don't don't\ntry that like that's it's not worth it\nit's not worth it or when we feel we\nhave\nto present ourselves to others we're\nlike no no you shouldn't even have to do\nthat you should it should just happen\nand it's like well no sometimes it takes\na bit of work and convincing and pushing\nthe boundaries as you're saying as well\nand so I can relate to relate to all of\nthat and and I feel the same way I feel\nthe same way London is fully Global and\nLondon has so much incredible talent in\nall these different Industries and I\nthink it needs to be shared globally too\nwe don't need to stay just here yeah no\nI don't I don't think so I think I think\nwe got a lot to say and we've got an\ninteresting perspective and I just want\nto I want more of it like a lot of time\nI do things I was like come on in and I\nmay mess it up but at least at least I\nwent for it at least I went for it and I\nand I believed in it and then hopefully\nsomeone after me refine it so then I can\nlearn something and I'll go for like do\nyou mean it's like that's the whole\npoint passing on the that's the whole\npoint like um just go for it it's it's\nit's not about you it's about your ideas\nwhat you can hear and what you can let\nthrough that's what this is man and so\nwhat you doing like what you listening\nto what radio station you listen to what\nideas you letting out that's how I see\nit yeah how do you get I'm ined I I\nloved how you talked about how the idea\nfor the kitchen formed how do you get\ncurious and critique your own ideas\nbecause I'm sure you have ideas popping\nat you all the time yeah how do you kind\nof like filter it down to be like oh\nthis is an idea that I really love\nversus going to park that I'm going to\ntake that from here like walk me through\nwhat's happening in your mind because I\nfeel like when you do have a idea that\nyou're sure of and you go yeah that's\nthe one it seems so clear but I'm\nguessing you have a million ideas before\nyou get that it's it's it's it's clear\nwhen you know it's clear I me I think in\nthat time it's like in that before the\ntrue Clarity you can't it's like you\njust can't shake it off you can't stop\nthinking about it you can't St thinking\nabout it I start thinking about it you\nkeep going you keep going keep going and\nthen it goes I got I got to do it and I\nreally truly there's loads of ideas but\nlike what I read like like Lo ideas but\nthen like someone ends up doing it like\nmean it's like and then you like and I\nwhen someone ends up doing it I get\nreally happy like all cool I don't have\nto do\nit they did it like I don't I don't I\ndon't see it as mine it seems what I\nhear and what I can see like I think no\nGiger said in an interview one time like\nin desert island disc and that he said\nlike they asked him about like a Wonder\nWar one of them songs he made they were\nlike what's it like he said it's like\nfishing and you go there by the sh and\njust waiting\nwaiting you feel me or Michael Jackson\ndescribed it one time where like he was\nsaying how like he was\nwriting he was writing a song and they\nwere like oh Michael like go bed like\nyou're tired he's like I can't Michael\ngo bed like can't like why he was like I\ncan't because if I go bed God will give\nthe song to to Prince M and like like\nyou get it like it's not\nlike it's not mine it's what my\nexpertise my hours my perspective my um\nI may have an idea but I'm not the right\num haven't had the right upbringing to\nreally actualize it like it's all these\nfactors that come to you letting it\nthrough you know what I'm saying so like\nI could see things I go yeah that's a\ngreat idea but I'm I'm not that's not\nI'm not sure if I'm able to give that so\na lot of time when I act on that how I\nDefine it a lot of time is there's stuff\nI want to say and there stuff I want to\nhelp people say acting is me helping\nsomeone say something because I'm like\noh I really want to say that too but I\nhaven't got time to like get there you\nknow what I'm saying so cool I just I\nhope you say it cuz I believe so like\nwell this is like oh I okay stuff I\nrealized oh I'm I'm the one that is\nsupposed to say this I can say this and\nthen you have to check yourself and go\nhow much are you thinking about yourself\nhow big is your mentality or like it\ncould be limiting or like you mean it's\nlike there's a whole process that's why\nit's taking me time but I think when I\ndid\nskins when I wrote on skins I had a\nthing that in my career I was like all\nright cool do I want to be a great\nsinger or do I want to sing great songs\nyeah and I think my career shifted when\nI was like I want to sing great songs\nand then I realized in that process you\nbecome a great singer so when skins when\nyou're inheriting characters you're\nsinging a great song essentially and\nthen I realized in this process I've had\nto learn how to make a song M you\nhow that to create a character how that\nto create relationship design how that\nto create structure like you have to\nlearn all that in order to get to the\nstandard that I like you know what I'm\nsaying it's not you can release\nit but I wouldn't cuz I just I have a\nhigher standard for myself and the stuff\nI like and I want me and my friends to\nlike what I make or what I help someone\nmake I I love what you said man and it's\nso interesting like I'm when I'm\nlistening to someone speak on the\npodcast I'm always just trying to like\nsense like what energy kind of connects\neverything they're saying and every time\nyou speak and every time the way you\nanswer stuff is is counterintuitive in a\ngood way because I hear peace and calm\nthrough all of it like even for you to\njust say right now that when someone\nmakes something that I had an idea about\nyou accept that with peace that oh\nthat's not my idea it wasn't meant to be\nmine where a lot of us see someone make\nan idea come that we maybe one day had\nrandomly and we're like they did my idea\nlike I wish you know could have been the\nperson or whatever we often feel a bit\nof competitiveness comparison and you\nhave actually the opposite where it's a\nsense of peace and like actually that's\ngreat for them good for them happy they\nmade it I want to see it yeah I want to\nsee it yeah like I want to see it like\nand it's like it's the reality of like\noh yeah to be to I'm the one to make the\nidea in that certain kind of level that\ncost a lot like so if someone does it\nand they wanted to pay the price I'm\ngoing sit front row be a fan of it you\nwhat I'm saying like back then I buy the\nDVD you I'm saying I would like I would\nsupport it cuz I'm just happy it exists\nyeah I'm just happy I just want things\nto exist I think the world that we kind\nof come into is really\nfake everyone just say this is this this\nis that I'm like this just people\ndecided that I just decided something\ndifferent and I think other people just\ndecide something different and and I\nlove seeing people make\ndecisions I know I know you know this\nand I hope you know this that is\nbeautiful man that is that mindset is is\nlike Top Notch that's that's another\nlevel of thinking um I wouldn't see it\nthat way but I hear you I accept that\nI'm Lear how sharing with you yeah I'm\njust saying it to you I I love that\nbecause I think if we could all live in\nthat way where we could all be happy for\nwhat bringing things into existence yeah\nman whether it was brought by us or\nbrought by others that's that's a\nbeautiful state to live in to make\nsomething that doesn't exist to exist is\nincredible I think it's insane yeah so\nit's like so I need to have this\nmentality back day we for I was like\nthought I was not whatever but like but\nlike be like M said oh you can't do this\nI'm like a man and a woman have sex yeah\nand they make a baby that is so\nincredible it's\ninsane it's like I just like I just\ndon't you think that's the most insane\nthat's really difficult to like it's\nreally difficult for us it's a really\ndifficult thing it's a difficult process\nit's all these other thousand guys\ntrying to get in there to saying y\ncoming here like I just I just it's I\ndon't know I I it makes me I\ncelebrate simple things like I remember\nin at school I used to look up in the\nsky I can't lie this interview is making\nme realize I was a special kid but I\nlook at the sky go BR like why be sick\nthat planes can fly yeah like it's so\nheavy it's so heavy there's so many\npeople there's so many\nbags what's going on like I just got his\nplayground I'm\nlike what's going on it this is this is\nwild and I just was I just just think\nthat's one of the most amazing things\never like that's why I always wanted to\nfly on a Concord and I never got around\nto it cuz it got done by the time I got\nthere but even a fast you there was a\nfaster one wow like you I mean it's just\nlike to Marvel it's a w because it's\ncommon it doesn't mean it's still not\nwow yeah yeah and I think because\nthere's a lot of it people then\ndisregard its specialness because\nthere's a lot of it yeah I just don't do\nthat yeah we yeah we've lost that\nexperience of awe and Fascination when\nyou had things that surprise you because\neverything around you is making the most\ndifficult things look easy AI VR like I\nmean today you know you could go on and\non like everything's becoming so\naccessible yeah and the edit the edit\nart of this kitchen we we call it Island\nwhen you're staying in is yeah yeah this\nis what it is like and then like so when\nyou're in island that is amazing cuz\nthat a big metal box that has 300 people\nwith like 800 kilos of luggage going\nfrom San Francisco to London is\nincredible that is amazing and I just\nkind of I always go where am I I'm in\nIsland am I there am I there because\nthen you're in just perception land or\nwhatever you think it is or whatever\nyour past pain or whatever this\ncrap crap is valid but like you should\nstay in that yeah is it's powerful with\nyour mindset and the amount of calm and\npeace there is in your life internally\ninternally\nyou're you're you're you're thinking\nlike a monk honestly you yeah because\nit's it's the mindset piece man it's\nit's the mindset I'm not guessing you\nit's the mindset piece like you know\nwhen I asked you every question I've\nasked you the things that have come out\nof your mind uh your mouth uh peace and\ncalm and it's come naturally it's not\nlike you're trying to be Zen like it's\njust coming out because that's where\nyou're trying to live and so that's what\nit means like in the modern day where\nyou know we're not trying to live a\nparticular monk life in that sense\nexternally but there's a sense of Peace\nwithin there's a sense of calm within\nand I love seeing it in other people I\nalways say uh one of the other people I\nsaw in during an interview was Kobe\nBryant like when I sat with him and I\ninterviewed him he had so much gravitas\nand so much calm and Zen around him and\nhe wasn't spewing like verses or trying\nto sound you know spiritual he wasn't he\nwasn't doing that same way as you not\ndoing that but it was a natural part of\nthat about their presence so I I I I\nrespect I love seeing it in other people\nthank you so much I appreciate it yeah I\nmean that um I want to dive into uh and\nI love I love this idea about what is\nand what isn't and what could have been\nwhat should have been what what would\nhave been and a lot of us live in that\nwhat if if someone's listening right now\nand they're listening to you and I'm I'm\nI know this for a fact anyone who's\nlistening to you this far today if\nyou're still listening to the episode\nwhich I know you are I know that people\nare going to be moved I know people are\ngoing to be inspired I know there's a\nlot of people going to be going oh my\nGod I didn't didn't know he'd been\nthrough all of that and you know like\nskins and like just writing and the\nchallenges and the stress what would you\nlike people to know about you that maybe\nyou think they don't know or or\nunderstand about you that maybe you've\nnever really been able to talk about or\nshare or or Express I don't know cuz I\nI'm not I don't I struggle with like my\nperception like I don't really cuz cuz a\nlot of the fame it's not like I chose to\nbe this famous it kind of came as a\nproduct of the work and it was a\nsurprise product like I did a film and\nthen a year later I was at the Oscars I\nmean so it was like it was about W um\nI'm not really I think I get the vibe\nwhere I'm like people don't get me in\nAmerica anyway and then in England I\nthink people do get me but they still\nbecause they get me they go they don't\nunderstand how I've done it um I don't\nI'm not really I'll keep it real I've\nlearned how to not be as invested in how\npeople perceive me\nbut I just not invested in it cuz then\nyou're\nconsistently curate it like I've been\nthere it's like I'm not sitting there\nlike mine's holier than D like I've been\nthere I've been in it trying to trying\nto look a certain way you I mean like I\nI was just like what was I happy no so\nlike don't know but\nif from you if you want to go ask\nquestions and that I'll be open to and\nI'll be able to elaborate I would love\nto you what I'm saying but for me I\ndon't go like\ncuz every like if I've really engaged\npeople mentality I could not get to\nwhere I've got to yeah I could not get\nto where I've got to so that's a lot of\nthat a lot of that is in that yeah of\nlike kind of being so\nlike that's what I think you know what\nI'm saying but I'm open same time as\nwell do you what I'm saying no no no I I\nget what you're saying and and I don't I\ndon't uh you know I think that it's It's\ntricky because you're right that you can\neither get so lost in cultivating and\ncrafting and and\ncurating how you're perceived and then\nstill people won't perceive you that way\neven if you do all of that yeah or you\ncan kind of Let It Go and and it kind of\nflows in its own Direction and then\nyou've made peace with that which which\nI think is probably the healthier option\nbecause at least you can live and\nbreathe I give you an example right so I\nwas I remember like I didn't really like\nI came in this game like I didn't watch\nfilms I watched like Batman and Robin\nI'm not really I'm just living life you\nI'm a kid doing my v k yeah Talking\nlikeing George\nClooney like that\njust I'm watching life like films that\ncome out you know what I mean so when I\ngot into the industry I was like talking\nabout this Art House from this Art House\nfrom this this this this that the other\nand I remember HMV had this deal where\nyou can black buy one pound2 pound films\nso I just buy loads of films and I would\njust watch all the people that people\nspoke about like like the Legends like\nMarl Street D Lewis like Shane Meadows\npaty conine like all these people that\npeople were like around that time around\n07 that people were just obsessed about\nbut watch time watching and I would go\noh like all right cool I watch your AC\nperformance okay that's you're clearly\nreally good at what you do but so what\nlike what\nfor you know what I mean and I realized\nI cared more about that than how great\nyou were at something that was aimless\nor purposeless then I realized great\ndidn't mean\nanything being really great at your job\nbeing really good didn't mean it didn't\nmean it had no emotion to it so\nsometimes is really\ngreat then I obviously I'd watched all\nthose that's those films and I went for\nthat and then what happens when you go\nfor that it's a bit of a prison cuz then\nyou watch your work back and you're just\ncritiquing yourself you're not enjoying\nit you're just critiquing critiquing in\nyour head in your head in your head in\nyour head then I had to go yo I can't\nkeep doing this I can't every time I do\na job just kind cuz I'm always I always\nused to be that improv like think about\nthe whole week I'll do an improv the\nwhole week I should have done this I\nshould should have done that should done\nthis next week I'm going go this I\nmissed and then and I was like this\nisn't this isn't enjoyable and then I\ngot to a place where I was like oh don't\ntry and be good try and be\nhonest like what say truth is what\nhappened honesty is how you feel about\nwhat happened so that's how I felt like\nI was just like yo like this is how this\nis what I feel like and minut I go for\nsomething that's honest I'll do a\nsomething at work and then a year later\nwatch it back and you're in completely\ndifferent space that you was a year ago\nand you wouldn't have done it that way\nbut I just go that's how I felt that's\nthe honesty at that point that's how I\nfeel that's where I was at if I can't\nit's not now time is as important as you\nlike it's not like the time is there the\ntime like the time where you was at got\nyou there yeah and a lot of jobs is like\nI'm the best person for the job after\nthe\njob you what I'm saying it's like and\nyou have to make peace man you cuz you\ngrew cuz you learned how to do it and\nnow you go if you give me now and it's\nit's like a annoying thing to being so\nbut it's like you have to go that's how\nI felt I was honest if I was honest I\ncan always walk away and go put my head\nup like that's how I felt yeah and so\nthat's what I go for like in terms of\neverything I go yo it's where I'm at man\nthat's how I feel man like and then oh\nyeah and if I say something different a\nfew years later you know yeah AG in it\nit's not like cuz like I went through\nsomething and my mentality my something\nshift I changed my mind so it's not it's\nnot like um that's how yeah really what\nI engage with now as a guy y like any\nother like micromanagement of my my\nperception I'm too\nmeticulous for me to really go in that\nlane cuz then I will really micromanage\nit so then I was like well what's just\nbe real and then and people that get it\nwill get it people that don't that's\nwhat they're supposed to do I mean yeah\nyeah I I I mean I'm glad I asked that\nquestion cuz I I I love where you took\nit and I think what I'm intrigued by by\nwhat you said is what is what are the\nprojects that you're now and I don't\nmean specifics like I don't need you to\nname stuff that you're working on but\nwhat is it that you want your work to\nmean today as you are writing as you're\nproducing as you're now in charge of the\nstory obviously you've been selective\nover roles you've played but I mean now\nthat you're telling your own stories\nwriting your own stories producing them\nwhich you've been doing since day one\nbut now doing it at this Lev\nwhat do you want it to mean what do you\nwant people to feel what are the things\nyou'd like people I want to feel yeah I\ndon't think I can manage it yeah because\nthat will rob them from their experience\nright but what I want people to feel\nabout the stuff I make writing producing\ndirecting anything I do in my life yeah\nis to\ngo someone to take it\nin call their friend and go hey you seen\nthis this is m like and then and then\nand they get points from their friend\nbecause they have shared something that\nyou I mean you what I'm saying it's like\nyou there's a song that's amazing and\nyou're like this is mad and then now\nforever you're going to rate that for\nlike you're going oh I introduce you to\nthat say you feel like yeah like I got\nit like I want my work to feel like that\nI want to feel to share it to there's an\nexcitement there's a there's a crackle\nto it I want there to be like I want it\nto be sharable cuz I do think sometimes\nin a lot of workers there's stuff you\nshare and there's stuff you don't yeah\ncould be as good as great as you want\nthe stuff that you want to share the\nstuff you don't want to share there a\nlot of depressing stuff I do not want to\nshare but they are excellent it's\nincredible but you\njust yeah you mean and you take it what\nyou take into for whatever reason and I\ndo love the fact that people go yo this\nis this makes me feel something this\nmakes me this makes me want to move you\nknow what it is you know what it is I\nwant to make music that makes people\nwant to dance m and how what I mean by\nthat is like kind of like you can't\nintellectualize why someone dances yeah\nyou what I'm saying it's just they do\nthey move you what mean I want to just\nmove people move people to go I'm going\nto do that or I want to do this or like\nI want to share this I want to I want to\nthere's something that comes after it\nthat means you that's bigger than any\nadjective you know what I'm saying yeah\nCU a lot of times a lot of people's\nfeelings are just adjectives the stuff\nthat you say on Twitter they're not\nstuff that's we actually feeling mhm so\nthat's that's that's where I'm at really\ngreat answer man great answer I the\nreason why I love that is when I start\nwhen I first made my first ever video\nand people said why did you make it I\nsaid cuz I wanted someone to send it to\ntheir friend and say that's what we were\ntalking about yeah that's what we were\ntalking about and I didn't know how to\nwe didn't know how to but that that\nvideo helped explain what I was going\nthrough but Daniel you've been amazing\nI've got a final five we do this with\nevery guest these final five have to be\nanswered in one word to one sentence\nmaximum yeah yeah so So Daniel these are\nyour final five the first question is\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nheard received or given I've got one\nprofessionally but I got one personally\nI used to reject it as a kid dis advice\nbut now I'm older I get the more I'm\nrealizing how much is my mom is always\nsaying everything\nmatters everything everything little\nmatters and I would let out I wouldn't\nfocus on\ndetails I wouldn't focus on details and\nthen now I'm older I'm realizing the\ndetail isn't about the detail detail is\nabout what it says about you M and how\neasily you can show up on everything\nelse if you just practice simple details\nand she goes everything little matters\nshe say everything little matters I\nthink that I love that that's great man\nwe never had that and I fully agree all\nright question number two what is the\nworst advice you've ever heard received\nor given I can't remember specific but I\ncan remember how it made me feel and how\nI reacted to it in my head when they\nsaid it when they basically were just\nsaying accept\nless basically what the principle was\nand I think I just erase it when people\nsay that they go you know you're not\nsupposed to like you know this or that\nperson deserve basically they Bas that\nperson deserves more I think everyone\ndeserves\nmore I love that you I mean it's not\nlike I just believe so if you decide\nthat you want more then you can get if\nyou don't then chill yeah what I mean\nit's not like and I I feel like when\npeople are communicating subconsciously\ncommunicating a hierarchy mhm that they\nwin out of that doesn't benefit me I go\nyou're chatting right\nbut like I can't it's that is I think\nit's except lless love that all right\nquestion number three what's the first\nthing you do when you wake up and the\nlast thing you do when you go to bed\npray\npray what's the prayer just\nthanks thanks I really I got into that I\nused to do as my mom as a kid she make\nme read a Bible every\nnight us to read a proverb a day you\nknow only got like 31 chapters in that I\nused to read it as a kid\nand then I don't know I got into a place\nI was just like no man there was one\ntime I had to audition I really wanted\nthis audition I wasen really on that and\nI went this audition I just\nprayed who am I chatting to what is\ngoing on it like I was in New York I\nremember I really wanted it like why did\nI feel to do that and I just ignored it\njust kind of carried on my life this\nlike 2016 2015 I was\nlike and then like I think I got to a\nplace and I was like you know what\nit makes me just\nSt yeah man thanks focus on what I think\nand like what I'm grateful for and then\nlike humility cuz my ego can get World\nsometimes so teaches me how to just\nchill and um and listen to myself yeah I\nthink God's in you I don't think it's\nGod's above you it's not big brother\n1984 mhm I love that I'm going to take\nthat as question four cuz I followed up\nFifth and final question uh if you could\ncreate one law in the the world that\neveryone had to follow what would it be\nif you have been proven in one way shape\nor form to hate someone or a group of\npeople your punishment is to live with\nthem for a\n[Music]\nyear anyone even like Twitter hate\nanything go on in you do your that's\nlike 9 to5 or whatever bom boom you go\nlive with them for a\nyear and it's being there\nI think that's just off top I really\nlike yeah that's a great answer man yeah\nI like that a lot yeah that's that's\nthat's what that is I like that you went\nthere that's a great answer it's dope\nthere you go man appreciate it Dan\nappreciate you man so much thank you man\nif you love this episode you'll really\nenjoy my episode with Selena Gomez on\nbefriending your inner critic and how to\nspeak to yourself with more compassion\nmy fears are only going to continue to\nshow me what I'm capable of the more\nthat I face my fears the more that I\nfeel I'm gaining strength I'm gaining\nwisdom and I just want to keep doing\nthat"
