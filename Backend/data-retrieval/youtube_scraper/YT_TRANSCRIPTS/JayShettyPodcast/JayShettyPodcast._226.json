know\nif a relationship is worth\nsaving before we jump into this episode\nI'd like to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast J\nshett J shett the one the only\nJett\nhow do you know if a relationship is\nworth saving shall I stay or shall I go\nis one of the fundamental questions and\nhere's the thing even if you decide to\nstay or even if they decide to go you\nmay do so while at the same time having\na part of you that actually holds the\nother side if you think that the\ndecision is 100% perfect no doubt no\nhesitation then it's a setup if you\nleave you need to be able to leave while\nexperiencing the loss of something\nthings that may have been good even if\nit's just a dream of what was if you\nstay you have to be able to grieve the\npart of you that will never know what it\nwould have been like if you actually\nleft so the answer is not in the extreme\ndetermination it's in the ability to\nhold inherent contradictions it's a\ncomplex question question and complex\nquestions don't have easy binary answers\nand it's interesting isn't it because We\ncrave a binary easy answer we want it to\nfeel we often seek complete Clarity when\nwe're trying to make a decision rather\nthan accepting that a decision is\nfollowed by consequences consequences\nand a number of different feelings you\nuse the word grief there and I've seen\nresearch that shows how\nwhen someone breaks up with you or when\nyou break up with\nsomeone you almost crave them like We\ncrave an addiction that may even be\nunhealthy for us at times why do you use\nthe word grief and can you walk us\nthrough both of those losses of identity\nthat you spoke about on either end so\ngrief is because I think every choice\ncomes with loss the consequence is the\nchoice you didn't make and even though\nyou think this is the right choice and\nthis is what I must do\nthe grief may be the fact that you\ndidn't you were not capable of making\nthis thing work or that you had such\nhigh hopes and it didn't materialize or\nthat you have wished that you didn't\nmake some mistakes that you made or that\nyou wish you had left sooner there's\nlots of different ways but there is no\nchoice that doesn't have loss and\ntherefore some grief attached to it and\nthat is the nature of the Beast that\ndoes not mean that you didn't make the\nright choice in terms of heartbreak it's\na different part yes some people\nexperience heartbreak with such an ache\nwith such a sense of longing and such a\nsense of fracturing on the inside that\nthey are that their longing becomes\nobsessive that they are trapped in\nreminition and that it ex experienced\nlike a\nwithdrawal that is not all breakups but\nthat is the extreme kind of breakup\nwhich has been compared to an addiction\nbecause of those intense sense of\nwithdrawal and because it takes place in\nthe same centers in the brain let's say\nsomeone does want to save their\nrelationship they want to make it work\nwhat does that take on a deeper level\nfrom that individual what have you seen\nover the years of what it really takes I\nthink we often think of saving a\nrelationship is like let's do more date\nnights let's spend more time together\nlet's do more this but what have you\nseen it really takes from a human so\nlook I work with relationships for 40\nyears these are questions that I can\nanswer in multiple ways so I'm going to\nanswer it in one way with you today and\nsomebody's going to say but you didn't\ntalk about that so I just want to\npreface that because there isn't a one\nsize fits all and when I'm going to\nhighlight something now with you because\nit's the first thing that came into my\nmind when you asked what can we do to\nactually repair our relationships\nstrengthen them fortify them solidify\nthem enliven them one of the first thing\nI often think about is accountability\nit's actually not asking the other\nperson to do all the changing somebody's\ngoing to tell me but what if you've done\nthat and it hasn't made any difference\non the other side so I just want that to\nbe mentioned in general in relationships\nwe often get to a place where we think\nyou need to change here I'm going to\ntell you what you could do differently\nthat would make this relationship better\nand the hardest thing to do is to\nactually say what can I do because if\nyou change it is quite sure that it will\nalso create change on the other side\nbecause we are interdependent Parts in a\nrelationship I start to do something\nwhich makes you do something which makes\nme do something it's a figure eight but\nif I start to do something else sooner\nor later you cannot continue do the same\nif I no longer answer you when you say\nsomething there's a good chance that at\nsome point you're going to stop saying\nit because because you don't get the\nreaction that you've been used to get so\nthere's no better way to change the\nother than to change ourselves but\nthat's not a 100% thing it's just a good\nprinciple to keep in mind what is it\nthat I can do differently what's one\nthing I could choose that I know would\nimprove the relationship because I've\nheard you or because I know us and if I\ndon't instantly walk out every time but\nI actually stay and I listen and I pay\nattention will that create something\nrather than thinking about you know all\nthe good reasons why I should get out or\nleave in that moment so this\naccountability piece is very high on my\nlist but there are 10 other things about\nwhat makes us work on a relationship to\nimprove it and you talked about there\nhow you know trying to change the other\nperson isn't necessarily the focus but\nfor so many of us that seems to be the\nproblem the problem seems to be the\nother person's behaviors their attitude\ntheir approach to life maybe their\naspirations I hear a lot of people say\nthings like they don't dream enough they\ndon't dream they dream too little right\nlike too much sorry that's it yeah I\nhear some people say they they don't\ndream enough they dream too much I hear\npeople say oh they have too many friends\nthey have no friends right I see people\nat both ends of the spectrum we always\nseem to have issues with how our\npartners live and what I've learned at\nleast in my own personal reflection and\nI found is that for a long time in my\nrelationships I often projected the way\nI lived onto my partner and I we so\nstrongly believe that the way we live is\nright the way we were brought up is\nright that we want our partner to kind\nof follow suit and I always give this\nvery small example from my own home but\nin my house we used to eat hang out and\nthen at the end of the night we'd wash\nthe dishes in my wife home they used to\neat wash the dishes and then hang out\nand so when we got married and we\nstarted living together and when we were\nhaving friends over or whatever it may\nbe in my mind we're going to eat we're\ngoing to hang out and then we're going\nto wash the dishes in my wife's mind\nshe's thinking we're going to eat now we\nhave to clean up make sure everything's\nclean and then we can hang out and\nsomething as little as that can cause so\nmuch friction friction and bad\ncommunication and feelings of oh you\ndon't care about me and you don't love\nme and you don't appreciate me or you\ndon't value the work and there's so much\nthat comes from something and that's\njust a very small example but it's\ninteresting to me that in that scenario\nwe both had not created a new belief\nsystem for our relationship but we're\noperating based on two old belief\nsystems that we'd simply adopted uh walk\nus through whether you agree whether you\ndisagree whether you can edit that\nreveal more to us about I find so many\nof our challenges exist because we\nproject our\noperating system onto someone else\nrather than creating one with them I\nlike the way you call it the operating\nsystem so I'm going to take a sentence\nthat you highlighted and start from\nthere you said here we were fighting\nabout what's the right moment to do the\ndishes but in fact it what we were\ntalking about is you don't care you\ndon't see me you don't appreciate me you\nwant it your way and what your\nhighlighting here is something that I've\nactually talked a lot about in a new\ncourse that I'm doing on conflict which\nis exactly that how do you turn conflict\ninto connection and one of the things I\nsay is that it's not what you fight\nabout it's what you fight for you are\nfighting for recognition you were\nfighting for power and control you were\nfighting for respect you were fighting\nfor trust and closeness underneath the\nfight there are usually three sets of\nissues that we are actually fighting for\nand that is power trust and value M so\nyou don't value me you know I worked on\nthis dis on this cooking I made this\nnice meal I prepared I tried to be kind\nto your friends and you don't value me\nonce you've understood that what is the\nhidden Dimension that you are actually\nfighting for the fight the dishes the\nwhen to do them becomes a lot more clear\na lot more clear rather than it's not\njust I'm imposing my belief on you and I\nwant it to do my way because my way is\nthe right way that's you may think this\nway but the question is what happens\nwhen you have to confront yourself with\nsomeone who is different I mean\neverything about relationships is about\nstraddling sameness and difference you\nknow and when you are a couple's\ntherapist it's very typical that people\ncome to you and they like a drop off\ncenter right they tell you you know here\nmy relationship here's my partner let me\ntell you what's wrong with them and\nmaybe you can fix them and I'll help\nyou I'll be your adjunct\non how to make my partner understand why\nmy family's way of doing things is the\nbest way of doing things it's a very\ngood way and so then the question is if\nyou have to change your mind does that\nmean that it's a loss of your identity\nor can you actually experience that as\nan expansion as something that you let\nin how do you let the other person\ninfluence you without being constantly\nin a defense of your you know this is my\nflag and here are my values or my\noperation system yeah I I I really\nreally relate to what you're saying and\nI love how you've broken it down to what\nwe're fighting for versus what we're\nfighting about I think that's brilliant\nand that's from your master class right\nno this is from my own new course oh\nthis is from your own new course coming\nout with very soon and that is really\nabout letting people have a very\ndifferent View and set of skills for\nhandling conflict like this one you know\nat first it was a nice thing you didn't\nfight about you just said we do it oh\nthat's so interesting no let's do it now\nno let's and then slowly because you\ncouldn't come into an unified agreement\nit became a point of contention and then\nthat point of contention became the\ngo-to every time you need to talk about\nyour backgrounds your values your style\nyour priorities your way of doing I\nthink we feel so robbed or at least when\nI speak to people about this they feel\nso robbed as you said of their identity\nbut also as you said people feel robbed\nof their power that if I give in to this\nother person my partner may be the more\npowerful one in the relationship or if I\nconcede then in the future when we're\nmaking decisions they're going to think\nI'm going to concede and often that is\nthe case that people get into\nrelationships because they think the\nother person is submissive or conceding\nto them or agrees with them on\neverything they say and then one one day\nthat person goes wait a minute I didn't\nrealize I just gave up everything I care\nabout for you and so how does one learn\nhow to practice that humility and giving\nup of power or is the solution a unified\nagreement as you called it just there\nwhat are we what are we trying to\nunravel how do we do that because I\nthink that but you just betrayed\nyourself in the question okay your whole\nquestion is framed in power terms\nconcede acques give in loss of self loss\nof power\nyes some people feel this way that is\none frame for some people to enter into\na relationship but if I actually change\nthe word power I could go like this in\nevery relationship you will find that\nthere often is one person who is more\nafraid of losing the other and one\nperson who is more afraid of losing\nthemselves one person more afraid of\nAbandonment and rejection therefore more\nlikely to acqu yes to pacify to plate to\nsay yes until maybe one day not and one\nperson more afraid of Suffocation and\ntherefore they fight for their ideas\ntheir ways of doing it the timing of the\ndishes and that is less about power that\nis more about the nature of connection\nthe majority of power struggles in a\nrelationship are not power struggles\npower is the defense the control battle\nis the way people are defending in\ntrying to get something for something\nelse that they are worried about it's\nthe surface Behavior you know some\npeople when they're afraid they fight\nbut the issue is not fighting the issue\nis that they're actually afraid and\nthey're trying to deal with their fear\nby gaining\ncontrol so don't just go for what you\nsee because what you see isn't\nnecessarily just what it is go always\nlooking at a level below otherwise\nyou're going to have a lot of this yeah\nexactly and so you're encouraging those\npeople that feel that way\nto look at that layer deeper the context\nof why\nthey're makes you lose your identity\nwhere did you get that idea who did you\nhave to fight with that you had a sense\nthat if you don't go all the way and\nwith fists that's the motion of fighting\nright it's not\nthis you know but you enter the\nrelationship with that and yet you live\nit with this so what happened to you\nthat is making you L interpret every\nsituation as a fight as a power struggle\nas I have to stand up and hold on\nbecause if I give this is the beginning\nof a slippery slope that's a frame that\nis not the truth now maybe you picked\nsomebody with whom this is sometime what\nis going to happen so then you ask this\nperson what happens if you don't get\nyour way for you the question is what\nhappens if the other person gets their\nway and for you the question is what\nhappens when you don't don't get your\nway can you still feel confident even if\nyou don't trample somebody yeah and I\nthink the questions you're asking that\nwe all need to reflect on for ourselves\nI almost think they're as important to\nask our partners like to understand what\nhappened to them like why they're in\nthat position why they get afraid and I\nthink that curiosity is so often lost in\nromantic relationships where we don't\nunderstand why someone is the way they\nare we just assume that it's about us\nlike we make it personal we don't\nrecognize that they have a whole history\nof relationships of family of parenting\nof experiences that have made them that\nway and maybe they are dealing with a\ndeep fear or a deep challenge does that\nresonate yes you know this thing about\ncuriosity is the most important shift we\ntry to make curiosity about yourself and\ncuriosity about your partner or friend\nor cooworker whoever the other is\ncuriosity is on the other side of\nreactivity so everything dealing with\nconflict is about helping a shift from\nreactive to reflective and curious but\nmore interestingly what you reminded me\nof is a thing with I talk about in the\ncourse that's called fundamental\nattribution error if you are\nnasty or reactive or bullying me a bit\nor even just simply if you're late it\nwhatever you're doing that the tendency\nis to think that when you do this it's\nbecause you have a negative personality\nbut if I am nasty or short or you know\ncutting a little bit then it's because I\nhad a tough day mine is circumstantial\nand yours is\ncharacterological and the loss of\ncuriosity in relationships is because we\ntend to think that we are more complex\nthan our partner and that's what makes\nus not ask what is your story with this\nwhy do you need to get things your way\nall the time why do you have to really\nin until I finally say whatever you want\ndear you know we'll do it your way\nbecause unless you got it your way you\nthink that you are you know on the floor\nyeah I think people Anda you've I mean\nyou've done this for decades now like\nI'm sure you feel that what we're really\naddressing here which I'm so happy that\nwe've kind of gone in this direction\nit's it's beautiful I'm so happy that\nwe're there that this idea of are you\ncurious about yourself and why it's\nhappening and what happened to you are\nyou curious about your partner and what\nhappened to them are you not making it\npersonal are you thinking about working\nas a team building unified agreements\nall of this language is so positive and\nI genuinely believe that what we've just\ncovered is so often missed in\nrelationships because we're so busy\npointing the finger and pointing the\nblame and pointing the responsibility\nthat as you started off with there's a\nlack of accountability and that being\nsuch a brilliant shift to even just\nstart it's liberating yeah it's actually\nliberating for people to say let me\ncheck myself for a minute the fear that\npeople have is why me is it my problem\nwhy you blaming me no no no taking\nresponsibility is liberating because the\nonly thing you can really change is you\nthere's a lot more freedom to do\nsomething about yourself than to go look\nfor your partner on the other side you\nknow I had a moment like that with my\nrecently so I was on the phone and I was\na little agitated talking to Banks and\npeople and administrating bureaucracy\nwhich gets me agitated and uh and then\nmy partner said you you too then my\npartner says my husband says to me I\nhave a headache I said what happened he\nsays you've been so yelling here next to\nme in the car and and I'm like you know\nI'm trying to solve these\nproblems and you can't just say to me\nyou know that's really frustrating these\npeople were like keeping you on the\nphone for an hour you think I wanted to\nbe on the phone for an hour with this\nand I just felt like a little lack of\nempathy please A Bit of Sympathy some\nsupport and on top of it I'm get scolded\nnow for my\nattitude and I sat there and I began you\nknow brooding and I said okay I'm not\ngoing to talk to you you know I thought\nif you don't want to if if I'm that\nunpleasant well then I'm not going to\nsay anything and then I sat in there and\nI thinking I'm married almost 40 years\nI'm thinking to myself am I going to go\ndo this one again you know why am I\ndoing this why do I feel so upset why\ndon't I just simply say I can imagine\nthat it was unpleasant to so he says to\nme why don't you say something about the\nfact that it's really annoying to sit\nnext to someone who is so agitated and\nI'm thinking why doesn't you say\nsomething about how frustrated it is\nthat I need to be so\nagitated you know and this could have\nturned into a real fight yeah and\nluckily a little bit of humor takes us\nout of his very quickly it's like became\nlike how many minutes are we going to do\nthis yes yes and where was that coming\nfrom after all this time like like you\nsaid you've been together for four\ndecades you love each other like you\ntrust each other you you've worked\nthrough so many of these things what do\nyou think it is that we're still\nfighting for in that moment like what\nwhat is it because it doesn't go away\nyou're right like we have two answers I\nmean we have we would have very\ndifferent answers to your question first\nof all just so you understand I will\ntell you I sometimes you know hear him\ntalk in a situation like this and he's\nvery could you explain to me why this is\nand I'm think\ntell them that this is not right you\nknow and and he says afterwards he hangs\nup says I was very angry on the phone\nexcuse me that is you know so I don't\nthink I get much further by being more\nyou know confrontational then actually I\ndon't think I'm any more effective I\nthink these situations are frustrating\nwhichever way but we get into an\nargument over which of our approaches is\nthe better one to talk with the\nbureaucracy it's ridiculous yeah exactly\nand it's so he thinks I'm I should be\nnicer right right and I think he should\nbe a little\nmore yeah yeah and and what are you\nsaying are you saying that neither\napproach matters and we're arguing about\nsomething insignificant or is it no\nhere's the thing you're in a situation\nwhere you are bound to not necessarily\nbe successful yes you're bound to\nexperience some helplessness it is\nfrustrating the situation is frustrating\nin instead of dealing with the\nfrustration of the situation you start\nto blame the other person for the fact\nthat they didn't get to the result that\nyou wanted instead of this kind of\nsituation where you go back week after\nweek with another person on the phone\nautomated thing you know and instead of\naligning together against the situation\nit you start to project onto the other\nwhy are you not competent so that I\ndon't have to feel so helpless yes yes\nyes yeah wow yeah exactly and I can\nrelate to that we we had a similar one\nkind of inverse to what you just said\nbut but a similar interaction where I\nremember my wife would often say to me\nI've had a really tough day and i' take\nthat as an opportunity to say I had a\ntough day too and mine was tougher I\nwould go I would go further i' say I had\na tough week you really up like really\nup like you know and and it's like I'm\nusing her opportunity to be vulnerable\nand to share how she feels with me and\nto comforted and supported and just\nheard to be heard I'm using her\nopportunity to be heard to hear myself\nI'm it's kind of like when you were\nlooking at me looking at myself earlier\nit's like that that idea of she's saying\nhey just sit with me for a second and\nI'm saying well no sit with me for a\nweek and think about where I'm coming\nfrom you have it tough yeah and then now\nit just turns into a competition as to\nwhose life is tougher right and making\nthe other person feel like their pain is\nnot valuable or that their stress that\nthey've gone through is insignificant\ncompared to mine and all of a sudden\nyou're fighting for something that you\ndon't even want to prove to your partner\nlike I don't want to make my partner\nfeel like their pain is not valuable but\nbecause I'm not honoring my Challenge\nand my stress and what I'm going through\nI'm expecting to use their space to do\nthat you just explained it very well but\nsometimes yeah please I mean the effect\nis the same you topping her you know in\nsuch a big way completely says to her\nyou have nothing to complain about which\nis not necessarily your intention but it\nis often the way the other person\nregisters it and then the question to\nyou is do you ever say to her I have a\ntough week without her prompt yes\nbecause part of what happens is that you\nget prompted by the other person and it\nsuddenly says oh if you give yourself\nthe permission to say to complain or to\njust vent a moment then maybe I get that\npermission too and what changes it is to\njust you know a is to acknowledge what I\njust been said and then to say I have\nthat feeling often too yeah yeah but it\nis the competition it is the you suffer\nI suffer more yeah absolutely now now\nsomething that's really helped me you\nuse humor now yeah my my wife can make\nanything funny so I rely on her to bring\nthe humor in because she's just very\nuseful yeah yeah she's just she's\nhilarious she's a comedian so not as a\nnot professionally she's just a funny\nperson and so she she can always add\nthat but now what really helps me and\nthis is more what I'm like\nis I'm kind of preemptive of stress and\nso I'll sit down with them like hey I've\ngot a really stressful week coming up I\njust want you to be aware of that and so\nyou know if I'm a bit shorter or I'm\nrunning around or I'm not fully present\nI just want you to be aware I've got a\nlot of stuff going on and if you need me\nof course I'll be there but just know\nand I like to set that up and\ncommunicate that because to me it gives\nme space to at least let her know where\nI'm coming from rather than to catch me\nin a bad moment and then I end up\nbehaving in a way that I'm not proud of\nwhereas now she's aware so now she's my\nmindful of that too and she doesn't have\nto tiptoe around me or she doesn't have\nto be unaware but it's the idea that\nshe's conscious that I get it he's got\nthree crazy days coming up and you know\nwe can talk about something maybe the\nday after can I take this one a step i'\nlove that I'd love that it's probably\none of the most useful things I have\nseen changing in a relationship when you\ndo what you just do you you're attentive\nyou're caring you let her know you're\napologetic and being apologetic is very\nbeautiful but it still says my life is\nvery important MH and I just want you to\nknow I'm not going to be there the step\nthat really changes it around is when\nyou say to the other person I'm so\nthankful that you are here because\nyou're being here is what enables me to\ngo take care of my busy week AB because\nonce you say it like that you make the\nother person very important and not my\nlife is so important thank you for\nunderstanding in it you come after I'll\nbe there if you need me but you come\nafter the thinking reinforces the\ninterdependence and it's true because\nyou couldn't go and attend to your life\nthe way you do without having the other\nperson do whatever it takes for you to\nbe able to be absent for a while and\nwhen you acknowledge that it makes them\nfeel like they're part of the story\nrather than they're on hold while your\nstory unfolds absolutely absolutely I\ncouldn't agree with you more and I've\nalways found that at least for me doing\nthat\nseparately in different context has at\nleast helped me when it's not tied to\nthe same context but I love that idea\nand I I fully agree with you like you\nknow I think it's a nice switch it's\nbeautiful it's a it's a tweak that\nreally changes the power dynamic in the\nrelationship in a small move yes\ndefinitely it's switching the\nsignificance from yourself yes to to\nthis relationship and the the support\nthat you each provide yeah that's\nbeautiful I love that I love what we're\ntalking about and you've probably heard\nthis a million times and that's what I\nthink it's important to address a lot of\npeople will say I want to talk to my\npartner about these things I want to be\ncurious about them I want to ask them\nabout their past but every time I do\nthey shut down they go quiet they don't\nwant to talk about it if I if I get\ncurious and say Hey you know when we're\nnot arguing but when we're just talking\nand I say hey you know what I just I\njust wanted to figure out like is there\nanything that scares you from your past\nis there anything that worries you or is\nthere any you're going through like how\ncan I help you and the other person goes\nno no no I'm fine I'm okay I'm dealing\nwith it and people often feel like they\nget shut down when they're trying to be\ncurious I'm sure you've heard this a\nmillion times in sessions and how have\nyou how have you dealt with that if\nyou've tried to ask your partner a\ncertain set of questions and you\nsystematically get the same answer MH\nchange tactic the point is not doing it\none more time hoping that this time\nyou're going to get a better response\nit's a little bit like Moses and the\nRock You know the water won't flow yes\nso what I like is not to be so direct\nyou know somebody told me recently that\nthey had gone to an offsite at work so\nit started in a different context but\nit's a good example and she organized\nthis whole offsite and she took a card\nfrom the game from where should we begin\nand the card was somebody who impacted\nyour life and doesn't know it mhm and\nthe whole group went through this\nquestion and basically people\nspoke that have that you knew nothing\nabout people who never talk and people\nwho you thought you knew that came up\nwith stories that you had no idea about\ntry to do it in a more playful way try\nto do it sometimes as part of a dinner\nconversation try to do it with a\nquestion that is less on the nose you\nknow and that invites you to then start\nfrom anywhere you want this is an\ninteresting question that you can answer\nat so many levels of depth there many of\nthose if you just say tell me about your\npast no you know you saw this movie and\nyou saw what happened there it's like\nanything of that that that is familiar\nto you and you tell your story you you\nneed to create a context yes for many\npeople digging deep into the past is\ntraumatizing aversive scary\nuninteresting you know or they don't\nhave the vocabulary for it is the other\nthing so that's why people have used the\nArts books movies plays songs poetry\nthey speak our human experience with and\nwe only have to say that that's my thing\nso sometimes I say to people you know\nhow about you find some songs that\nExpress the stuff that you don't know\nhow to talk about and that's a much\nlighter lift than tell me about your\npast you know a character that\nrepresents the parent that you grew up\nwith and you go and find into a series a\ntelevision series one of these\ncharacters they're all they've all been\nwritten about use other mediums other\nvocabularies to open up stuff that\npeople don't necessarily want to be in\ntherapy with their partner yeah I love\nthat that's such great advice and I\ncouldn't agree more I always say\neveryone who's listening to me I always\nsay to them like please don't force my\nbook onto your partner like please don't\nlike you may love my books or you may\nlove my night T please don't do that and\nI always say to people like it's about\nspeaking the language that your partner\nconnects to and that's what you're\nsaying the language could be music the\nlanguage could be art the language could\nbe movies and I always talk about one of\nthe reasons why I love having my podcast\nis because I get to speak to so many\ndifferent people from so many different\nbackgrounds so many different walks of\nlife talking about similar things you\nread a book a day yeah exactly and and\nwhat I find is someone may relate to\nathletes more so if an athlete is\nopening up about their mental health and\ntheir vulnerability or a challenge they\nhave with a parent your partner May\nrespond to that more than they would a\ncoach a therapist a psychologist or one\nof your partners May respond to\nacademics and scientists more than they\nwould to a guide and it doesn't matter\nhow they open up and so I I I love that\nyou said that and I love that you said\nsometimes we're just trying the same\nstrategy for too long and you know like\nyou said on the nose we kind of approach\nit in a very lar literal way like tell\nme about you know you're doing this\nhappened to you before you know like a\ncause and effect you know play with it\nyeah you're trying to be that therapist\nand you can't I think play is a good\nthing I think movement is important too\nmany people talk much more easily when\nthey're walking when they're hiking when\nthey're you know on a ski lift don't\njust sit and try to do face to face\nthere's a reason that fishing is so good\nbecause you do parallel play everybody\nis looking forward nobody has to lock\neyes and it allows me to think out loud\nand to answer a question here and there\nthe other thing is sometimes the\nquestion comes later often there's one\nperson that's much more articulate about\nsome of these things than another so\nfind other mediums other vocabularies\nand other settings start with that yeah\nI love that one of my favorite dates\nthat me and my wife went on very early\non was this activity in England called\ngo ape and what it is is it's a it's\nlike a ropes course that's high up in\nthe air so it's like 80 ft or whatever\nup above in the air and you've got all\nthese different like activities and\nthings so you're like swinging you're\nlike trying to walk on these steps it's\nit's challenging but it's fun and I\nremember having so much fun because\nthere were activities that she found\neasy and I found hard and activities\nthat I found easy and she found hard and\nwe could help each other we could talk\nwhile we were doing it there was a sense\nof support and I think what you're\nsaying is so true that I find that doing\nactivities where we're both novices are\nreally fun because when we're both\ngetting a chance to see a new new fresh\nunseen side of each other we really get\nto play and really get to understand if\nI'm in a position of strength if I know\na sport really well and she's never done\nit then I'm not really learning anything\nnew I'm kind of just being there and\ntrying to be the teacher and same vice\nversa but if we both have no clue about\nsomething like me and my wife took a\nsurfing lesson for the first time in our\nlife like a couple of years ago when we\nwent to Hawaii we' both never surfed in\nour life you know we're both from London\nand that wasn't accessible there and we\nwent on a first ever lesson and it was\njust hilarious it was fun it was silly\nwe were both learning about how much\ntolerance we both had and there was\nhumor coming in and what skill set we\nhad and you're so right that adding\nmovement to being together especially I\nfinding ways where you're not familiar\nprovides a real uh opportunity to see\nsomeone vulnerably so you added more\nthan just movement you added risk mhm\nand you added playfulness there's a\nbeautiful book by Eli fle called The All\nor Nothing marriage and he talks about\nreally what creates a sense of aliveness\nin relationships and one of the things\nhe highlights is the importance of doing\nnew\nthings not just doing things that you\nboth enjoy that you comfortable with\nthat's good but that breeds friendship\nwhereas when you do new things that also\ninvolve unknown mystery risk curiosity\nthat's where you actually bring in\nexcitement and in my language also\ndesire M I love that yeah that's\nbeautiful that that makes complete sense\nand I love those words those words we\ndon't often use around relationships\nrisk mystery like yeah no no I know but\nyou just don't hear them as much you\ndon't hear them enough at all around\nrelationships you always feel mystery\nwas something you had on date one or\nwhen you saw that person from across the\nroom right like that's when the mystery\nwas and there isn't any but I could\nagree with you more that but that's\nbecause people prefer sometimes to\ncreate an\nillusion of familiarity as if I know you\nlike you're the inside of my pocket\nuntil you do something I absolutely did\nnot expect you to do and then suddenly I\nrealized and I say I thought I knew you\nthe real beauty is to know that whoever\nis next to you who you think is already\nso familiar and so known is actually\nstill somewhat mysterious somewhat\nElusive and that's where you maintain\nyour curiosity next to the person that\nis with you you know faced with the\nunknown you can either re with fear and\ntry to flatten it and just ignore all of\nthat and just hold on to what's familiar\nor you can nurture it and then you are\nactually engaging with the mystery and\nthe Curiosity that is right in front of\nyou and that you know from your\nspiritual work that is very much taken\nfrom that notion how you then because\nthat allows you to sit like this when\nyou're talking with your partner because\nyou're still attentive and curious\nversus like this yeah definitely\ndefinitely let's let's say someone\ndecides\nto break up or maybe they're broken up\nwith and we can talk about both sides of\nthat if we talk about the side of\nsomeone's decided to break up with\nsomeone for their own reasons and of\ncourse there could be a million reasons\nfor breaking up with someone so it's\nhard to be specific there but if\nsomeone's broken up with someone but\nthey are having those feelings as you\nsaid the consequences will be you'll\nstill have that grief of what could have\nbeen you have the consequences of maybe\nit could have worked maybe we should\nhave tried there's still a feeling of I\nwish they were still around I used to\ntalk to them every day at 700 p.m. at\nnight I used to on a Friday night we'd\nalways go to this favorite restaurant\nwhatever it may have been we have these\nmemories what do people do with that\nfeeling what do you do with that feeling\nof\ncraving you know you do a lot of\ndifferent things but it's so interesting\nI literally edited a new episode for the\npodcast for where should we begin of a\nguy\nwho leaves his wife who he had been very\nclose to for quite a few years has a\nyoung\nchild moves in with another woman is on\nthe verge a few years later of marrying\nthat other woman and can't do it and has\nfelt guilt and remorse and regret and\nlonging for all those years and starts\nto meet\nthe mother of his child again not just\nas a\nmother but but now they're going on a\nfirst date again and it's like I left\nyou and then I came back to you it's an\nincredible story to see one person that\nbecause that is a question that doesn't\nhave one answer but in this case he\ncouldn't leave her fast enough but he\ncould never leave her\nfully and I can't tell you today if he's\nback with her or what but I have a sense\nthat something when he was about to\nmarry this other woman held him back\nthat he couldn't necessarily put into\nwords and that made him feel like he had\nto examine himself which is what this\nwhole conversation on where should we\nbegin is about and I've never had that\nparticular version of it but it is the\none that most responds to your question\nbut you're going to have to go listen\nyeah yeah yeah absolutely absolutely no\nand I recommend everyone go and listen\nto that if that's a question you've been\nasking yourself I I think that heart AE\nthat that people feel often feels\nendless as you said it can just go on\nand on and on forever people feel like\nwe've always heard you know time will\nheal all wounds but who instigated the\nbreakup is there really changes a lot or\nif it was Mutual is it ever Mutual yes I\nthink I think that it is often Mutual\nwhere two people say we evolved into\nsomething else or it just didn't work or\nyou know both people may have felt it\nbut one person was able to say let's do\nit that that makes sense you know and\nthe person who is more afraid of\nAbandonment and rejection and all of\nthat is often more the person who may\nnot say it but that doesn't mean they\ndidn't feel it many people tell you I\ndidn't have the guts to do it but it's\nthe best thing that happened to me my\npartner pushed it I would didn't want it\nthen so between what happens in the\nmoment and how people experience the\nconsequence it's not one and the same M\nthe person who may have pushed it may be\nthe one who has the most regret the\nperson who was more hesitant it may be\nthe one who actually is most liberated\nyeah it's not it's a much more intricate\npuzzle than just of course of course\nwhat are some of the phases that you see\npeople go\nthrough that can give people hope that\nthere is another side to this because I\nthink when you're in it the emotion is\nI'm never going to be loved again I'll\nnever find someone as good as that them\nagain I can't trust anyone again right\nlike these are the thoughts that people\nare repeating in their minds what do\nsomebody need to understand during that\ntime to to know it just made me think of\nof uh of another episode of this but\nit's the daughter who describes how one\nday a truck came took all of her\nfather's stuff I mean then comes back\nhome that's a story that we hear quite\noften and then all the situations of\nbetrayal of infidelity of falling love\nwith somebody else or discovering that\nyour partner you know wants a\nfundamentally different relationship\nthan you and I think that the situations\nwhere you are like completely sight\nlined and you realize wow the first\nexperience you have is that your whole\nsense of reality is shattered I thought\nI knew my\nlife this has nothing to do with where I\nthought I was at how can this be\nhappening to me you're in a state of\nconfusion in a state of disbelief and in\na State of Shock and in a state where\nyou feel like you've been just ejected\nfrom your life you you you had value and\nyou have none that's all part of\nbetrayal it's not just the lying it's\nthe fact that somebody could toss you\naway like that and that you think I\ndon't matter and that's what makes you\nmuch more afraid will I ever find\nsomeone who can hold me carry care and\ncarry me you know and can I trust that\never again because I trusted it here the\nquestion is as much about how do I trust\nagain but not just how do I trust\nsomebody else how do I trust my own\nperception that's the piece that when\nyou lose the belief in your ability to\nknow that what you believe is what is\nyeah then you are on such Shaky Ground\nso it Demands a real scaffolding and a\nrebuilding no you haven't lost your\nentire sense of perception because you\nhave good friends family colleagues\nmentors there's not just that person and\nyou need to get your sense of value from\nnoticing the other relationships that\nyou have so you need to bring those\npeople into your life do not isolate at\nthat moment you need the people who see\nyou differently from the one who just\nleft you and who those who seek you out\nthose who value your presence those who\nthink you're great you know and then\nslowly you often will find that you\nconnect better with other people who\nhave experience sense of betrayal like\nthat but betrayal is not only infidelity\nit can also be in a partnership it can\nbe in a being co-founders of something\nin there other relationships that go\nthrough this complete fracture slowly\nyou begin to say it's not one person's\nharming me or hurting me that is a\ndecree on who I am and my\nself-worth that person hurt me deeply I\nhave been hurt and I learned from this\nand and I protect myself a little bit\nbut I don't have to protect myself in\nsuch a way that I don't live because the\nbiggest Victory on this kind of hurt is\nthe ability to love again to trust again\nyou did not take that from\nme that is probably your biggest\nvengeance is to be\nhappy well yeah I mean that that\nresonates very very strongly and first\nof all\ncan people rebuild trust After\nexperiencing\ninfidelity\nand what does that process look like for\nsomeone and how different it is it to\nwhat they expect it to be the beauty of\nyour questions is that it filled an\nentire book of mine because it's\nactually a big big topic but if I was to\ntry to summarize it yes yes of course\npeople can rebuild trust I mean that is\nvery not everybody and not in every\nsituation but the process itself very\nmuch is real and I have met you know I\nbegan State of Affair by going to talk\nto couples that I had seen five or 10\nyears earlier to know whatever happens\nto these people because I see them in a\nmoment of Crisis and often I don't know\nafterwards you know they decided to stay\ntogether they worked it through and if\nthey went so I wanted to know what does\nthat relationship actually look like\nyears later who are they what happened\nto their bond you rebuild trust through\na few major stages the first one is that\nwhoever hurt you especially if you\nchoose to stay together has the ability\nto express guilt and remorse for hurting\nyou even if they don't feel guilty for\nthe affair itself even if they have host\nof good explanations good reasons\nthat that make it understandable not\njustifiable not condonable but\nunderstandable they still can experience\nthe guilt and the remorse for hurting\nyou that acknowledgement is fundamental\nit's fundamental in an intimate\nrelationship in a friendship or between\nnations for that matter then it's the\nability to basically become what I call\nthe Vigilante of the relationship it\nmeans it's your job now to say how much\nyou value the relationship and to\nprotect the relationship so in the\nsituation of an affair for example it\nmeans that instead of you're asking me\nquestions about what I did and me hoping\nthat you won't ask me because we've\nalready gone through this 10 times I ask\nyou is there something you want to ask\nme because if I bring it up rather than\nhoping you won't bring it up then I'm\nsaying to you I'm owning my thing I take\nresponsibility I care about the\nrelationship and most of of the time if\nwe have a good day you may say to me I\ndon't want to talk about it I'm having a\ngood day because I am reminding us and\nI'm not letting it be forgotten and I'm\ntaking charge that's the Vigilante I'm\nthe protector of the relationship and\nthen number three is to explain to talk\nbetween the people why did you do this\nwhat did it mean to you and then what\ndid it do to\nme the affair always includes both sides\nif you just talk about what it meant for\nyou you're missing a point if we're just\ntalking about what it did to me we're\nmissing a point so the ability to not\njust look at the facts what did you do\nbut the meaning of it Affairs have\nmeaning they're stories they tell us\nsomething about the person about the\nrelationship not always bad things for\nthat matter so what did it mean to you\nand those three stages in the crisis\nphase remorse guilt acknowledgement in\nthe inside phas you are the Vigilante\nand together we explore meaning making\nof This crisis for us what are we going\nto do with this and then phase three is\nif we do Stay Together what's our vision\nfor who we want to be no we will\nprobably not go back to what we were\nbecause what we were may have been part\nof why we got to where we are who do we\nwant to be what does it open up an\naffair toles the scorecard in a\nrelationship so I may have accepted at\nall kinds of things because this was the\nway I conceived of our relationship and\nI was willing to not work and I was\nwilling to make more money I was willing\nto work all the time I was willing to do\nall the child care I was willing to do\nnone of it I was willing to take care of\nyour ailing mother of your addicted\nbrother whatever I accepted a lot of\nthings but now this basically gives me\nthe opportunity to also say I also have\ndiscontent it's not just your Affair\nthat expresses the discontent and so\nhere's the fundamental line most of us\ntoday in the west are going to have two\nor three relationships in our adult life\nor\nmarriages some of us are going to do it\nwith the same person so sometimes the\naffair is the end of the first marriage\nor the first relationship but it can be\nthe beginning of the next one with each\nother and that's the rebuilding of the\ntrust well said yeah no and it's I'm\nsure that's going to give people a lot\nof Hope but also what I love about your\nwork and in your books is that there's\nalso a process there there's a structure\nthere there's a method there for people\nto go oh okay that's where we're at\nthat's what I'm struggling with I think\none of the biggest thoughts that repeats\nin people's minds when they're broken up\nwith or when they've experienced\ninfidelity that I hear from people is\nJay I feel like I'm not worthy anymore I\nfeel like I'm not lovable again I feel\nlike I'm not desirable while they are\nstaying with the person or while they've\nbroken up both I've heard people say I\ndon't feel desirable because they desire\nsomeone else but I still want to be with\nthat person and I don't feel worthy even\nwith that person now because I'm\nreminded constantly as you said of their\ninfidelity and these thoughts perpetuate\nbut what I'm hearing you say and I'd\nlove for you to guide us is what I'm\nhearing you say is well that's why you\nneed to do the meaning making because\nyou really need to understand the their\nstory and meaning and yours right now\nyou're just focus on yours and that's\nalways going to be this negative\nrepetitive pattern you remind me of um a\ncouple I saw and this man had done\nsomething that was really egregious in\nsome way because he had taken everything\nthat was special to the relationship and\nshared it with the other person but\neverything wow their favorite places\nrestaurants clothing I mean he had left\nnothing sacred that's a\ndevaluing right and whenever they would\ndrive there was a way when they would\narrive to a place and she would look at\nhim and it was like there too and so he\nwould dread it because he knew he was\nguilty as charged and then I began to\nsay to him I want you every time you\ndrive when there is a place you say yes\nthere too without waiting for the\nquestion because you know know that you\nhave to stand but when there is that you\nhave to stand accountable but when there\nis a place not you say no they not\nbefore the question comes up that's part\nof the\nVigilante so that you protect the\nrelationship and you bring back the\nvalue you say you know now go create new\nplaces too that are new for the two of\nyou and that you need new cells you\ncan't just go back and try to reenter\nthe spaces that you were in the loss of\nvalue gets addressed by having someone\nwho is slowly reclaiming the value the\nfeeling is true but it doesn't mean that\nbecause they had desire for someone else\nthey had none for you actually sometimes\nthey had desire for someone else because\nyou had none for\nthem you know the person who says that\nto you is comes with one particular\nstory but there's so many stories you\nknow sometimes you have a person who was\ncompletely in uninterested for a decade\nand then they are upset that they're\npartner was interested with somebody\nelse it's not just you know I was there\navailable for you and you dumped me for\nsomeone that you looked at with a bigger\nyou know fer eyes so what people\nexperience after the Betrayal doesn't\nalways tell the story of what happened\nbefore that's why the meaning making is\nso really important you know sometimes\nsomebody's going to say to the other you\ndevalued me for 10 years you barely paid\nany attention to me you were so en\nruptured in your work you were so busy\nwith your phone you were so you know you\nI was abandoned long before you know and\nthat also needs to be put into the story\nthe story doesn't\nstart the moment that you discover\nsomething because there are a lot of\nmoving pieces underneath and people\naddressing this with\ncare carefulness and responsibility is\nthe process it's the Hope doesn't come\nfrom nowhere it comes because two people\nsay this is important we build something\nwe've been together 5 10 15 years 25\nyears we not letting this just go now we\nneed to reclaim the value of this for\nboth of us absolutely this idea that\nwe're going to have two to three\nrelationships in our adult adult life\nand they could either be with the same\nperson or of course with two to three\ndifferent people and I think this idea\nof choice and\nselection has\nobviously rapidly changed because of\ntechnology and apps and the amount of\npeople you can bump into you know I\nlooked at studies saying that you know\n25 years ago most people ended up with\nsomeone within a f mile radius of where\nthey grew up we know that that's not the\ncase anymore people are moving countries\nfor people moving States people are\nliving in different parts of the world\nwe both live in different parts of the\nworld than where we grew up and so when\nI look at that one of the biggest\nchallenges I find or or that I hear from\npeople is because there's so much\nselection there's a sense of like I'm\nnot feeling any spark I'm not feeling\nany chemistry I don't feel a connection\nwith this\nperson I hear that a lot and we let's\naddress that and then the other thing I\nhear is this idea of like you know this\nguy didn't have as much as the other guy\nor you know and you start comparing it\nbecause you can because you're just\nexposed to so many more people now and\nyou're almost comparing resumés of\npeople that you've heard about spoken to\nseen on a dating app introduced through\nyour friends so this idea of choice and\nthe Paradox of choice as it's always\nbeen called in studies from products to\npeople now you know we can get stuck at\na grocery store wondering which product\nto buy but in in dating it feels like\nyou can keep going because you can just\nkeep\nswiping let's talk about both of those\nthe idea of how do you choose how do you\nselect and when you're choosing and\nselecting\nhow do you not feel that sense of there\ncould be more I said Choice comes with\nloss I'm actually very excited about\nthis question\nbecause I'm very interested in this at\nthis moment right I'm interested in the\nintersection of technology and\nrelationships and mental\nhealth and I've just done a a bunch of\nepisodes with people in the dating scene\nbecause of exactly this so we have have\na frenzy of consu of romantic\nconsumerism in which in search of the\nperfect people are no longer happy with\nthe good mhm we have people looking for\na soulmate on an app that's an\ninteresting combination between\nspirituality and capitalism and how do\nwe even think that a partner is a\nsoulmate soulmate used to be God you\nknow and now we want Transcendence and\nmystery and wholeness and all of it and\necstasy almost with a person you know\nthe stuff that people looked for in the\nrealm of the Divine they now want with\ntheir person and at the same time\nthey're doing it with a checklist so\nthat many dating experiences are like\njob interviews so all of that combined\nright I do think we have more choice but\nwe also have a lot more uncertainty and\na lot more self-doubt and we are a lot\nless capable of handling\nuncertainty because we live with a host\nof Predictive Technologies that are all\nmeant to take away uncertainties\nobstacle friction you know rough edges\nso we don't rub anymore with stuff that\nhelps us deal with uncertainty unknown\nand engage with happen stance you know\nhappen stand means you stand in line and\nyou start talking to the person that is\nbehind you in line and after that you go\nand have a drink with that person and\nafter that you find yourself exchanging\nnumbers and a story starts MH SP ously\nunprompted so I think that the\ncommodification that people feel is real\nit's not just because of your childhood\nit's part of society at this point there\nis a way in which we talk about\nourselves as products and there is a way\nin which we talk about ourselves online\nwith followers as if we are religious\nleaders you and me for that matter so\nthe first thing don't go in thinking\nthat you have to find somebody at the\nfirst meeting that's not the way it\nworks and that you go down you list and\nyou know and then if the the first thing\nthat goes wrong you go ick and you just\ngo on to the next you know what I'm\ndoing now when I address this very\nquestion is I show a very famous\nclip it's classic in Psychology called\nthe still face experiment have you ever\nseen it no I haven't it's a two-minute\nclip on YouTube in the steel face\nexperiment the mother is playing with\nthe little one and the little one is\npooing and showing her things and you\nknow and then at some point the mother\ngoes still\nface and the kid continues to point and\ncontinues to call her attention and\nwithin 30 seconds or less of the mother\nnot responding the kid goes into a panic\na frenzy loses its body composure starts\nshrieking and basically you understand\nthat we are relational people\nfrom and what this clip shows me is that\nthis is what goes on in ghosting in\nbread crumbing in check listing this is\nwhat is the experience of many people at\nthis moment you go you have a honic\nthreadmill you meet someone you think\nthere's possibilities and then they\ndisappear on you and you're left like\nthis and then you unravel and you do\nthis sometimes 20 times a day with the\nsame person this is kind of the\nexperience of modern dating in this I\nhaven't seen many people say I love it\nyou know maybe 6 5% of meeting people\nmeet on an app but I don't see people\nsaying I love it actually it's the\nnumber one complaint of people dating at\nthis moment so try to bring back\nsomething that is more Humane you meet\nsomebody or a friend introduce you to\nsomeone don't go and meet with them\nalone in a bar to have a face to-face\nconversation to go down an interview do\nan activity it's exactly what you were\ntalking about do something you enjoy\ndoing bring that person to a thing that\nyou're doing with friends you want to\nget to know somebody put them in a\nsocial social situation see how they\ninteract with people how they act how\nthey respond how they engage with people\nif you think that you're going to have\nepiphanies with Clarity like an app\nforget it you will be exhausted and you\nwon't meet anybody really well said and\nI and I could agree with you more I'm\nalways trying to push people away I'm\nlike get out of your inbox and your DMs\nand your messages and get out there\nthere's no way talking to someone over a\ncouple of messages is going to help you\nfigure anything out but you've probably\nspoken to so many people who've had\nchemistry lost chemistry never had it I\nfeel like a lot of people today that I\nhear from they're meeting people but\nthey're like there's no spark there's no\nchemistry I'm not feeling\nanything what should we want to feel if\nthere is anything we should want to feel\nat all with someone and what is the\ndifference between chemistry\ncompatibility and well first of all I\nthink we need to differentiate are you\nlooking for chemistry for a love story M\nor are you looking for chemistry for a\nlife story lots of people you can have\nchemistry with have a fantastic night\nwith for that matter or more but that's\nnot the person you necessarily want to\nmake a life with the project will\ndetermine the nature of the\nchemistry right that's number one so\nnumber two is\ncuriosity a desire for more I want to\nyou know it's like you read a book a\nperson is a book right or you can use\nother metaphors do you drag yourself\nthrough the next\npage you know I should you know let me\nsee where it goes or like you can't wait\nyou know it's a page Turner if you have\nthe experience of the page Turner with\nthe person you want more you want to\nhave the next conversation you want to\nask them that kind of question you want\nto go do something else with them you're\non a good track you know this notion of\nthis instant combustion of emotion that\nfills you up you want a religious\nexperience that is not always the case\nsometimes people fall like that you know\nas we say it for but the majority of the\ntime it things grow you know they grow\nthrough the interaction you get a good\ntext you like what you just read you\nfind yourself wanting to answer a\nsentence and you've just answered two\npages you know you wanted to go and meet\nthem for half an hour and three hours\nlater you're still sitting on the floor\nin the hallway having an olling\nconversation that's the stuff that reads\nthe feelings if you sit there like this\nand think that some you know deox\nMachina is going to fall from the\nheavens you're off you know it's this\nfalse certainty that is not the majority\nof people and there's many ways in some\npeople start hot and then they become\nlukewarm and some people start lukewarm\nand the heat grows over time there isn't\none narrative this notion that Hollywood\nhas sold us that just like ah and I\ncan't can't wait and I just have this I\nfall for you on the spot that's one plot\nthere are many plots and if you\nconstrain yourself in thinking this is\nhow I should be feeling and I'm not\nfeeling it then you you are limiting\nyour options yeah one thing that has\nreally come up a lot with people have\nspoken to recently is this idea of they\nfind someone who makes them feel\nsafe who they feel cared for by\nand the person seems to be they consider\nthem to be good-hearted MH that person\nmakes waiting for the butt yes exactly\nyou're right you already know you\nalready know this person in their words\nmakes sense MH but they feel like\nthey're settling because there must be\nsomeone else who has all of that plus\nthe other three things that they want\nyou are a perfect candidate for romantic\nconsumerism if if you think this way\nyou've been had you've been literally\nyou've become a good person that I can\nwe can you know you your mind is set for\nsomebody telling you this is the product\nyou need the perfect fit and then you\nare going to be the perfect patient who\ncomes in thinking I thought my person\nwas like this and this and this and\nthey're not the deal that I bargain for\nit's not what was written on paper you\ncan Le the language it's like business\nyou know capitalism enters romantic life\nit's it's really crippling to people you\nknow the more you have this notion of\nperfection the low the higher you can\nfall you know are you perfect are you\nthat great do you think that everybody\nfalls like what is this notion so then\nthere is this idea that there is the\nsense and settling with the passion you\nknow and you should have that passion\npassion is a wonderful feeling to have\nit's maybe not the best thing to decide\nif you want to have a life with somebody\non it's not the most important\ningredient for that you know that\ndoesn't mean you don't want excitement\nintensity you know draw but this idea\nthat there is reason and passion that's\na very old divide that's the that is the\nDivide of the 19th century the\nrationalists and the romantics and why\ndo you say that why do you think that\nand I and I get that you're giving a\nbalanced approach there but to Enlighten\nUs in what you've seen you compared the\nlove story and the life story why do you\nthink it almost feels like what we've\nbeen sold is for the love story but the\nlife story requires a different set of\nskills yes skills and values and\ncompatibilities because there are many\nmore people that you can love than\npeople you can make a life with I can\nhave many love stories with people that\nI meet on a trip that I you know with\nwhom I have a a beautiful short story\nwith but would that be the person with\nwhom I can do we share anything else in\nterms of how we see life\nM with everything else that life brings\nthat's a different thing that doesn't\nmean you don't want love in the life\nstory but many more love stories can\nexist without life\nstory not that many life stories will\nexist without a love story you know you\ncan call it an adventure you can call it\nyou know and it is what people used to\ndo when they date before they're looking\nfor someone with whom they want to have\na more committed relationship it's very\nimportant that that we see that a lot of\nthe things that we're looking for are\nthe things that make for a real love\nstory the things we want to feel the\nthings that are on the checklist are the\nthings we've kind of created an\nimpossible situation it's really so you\ndon't settle if you see that language\nsays what I am fantastic you know or I\nam not fantastic but I'm going to find\nsomeone fantastic who's going to make\nme rise M and it is a kind of use of\npeople that really is is creating such a\npsychological POS it's really eroding\npeople's sense of self-esteem and sense\nof self-worth it's not good yeah where\nare you at in your life at 23 you're\ngoing to think differently from\n33 you know at 20 at 33 it's likely that\nyou're going to think of a few people\nthat you said no to at 23 that were\nperfectly\nfine and you can kind of didn't because\nyou kept thinking I can do better and\nthis I can do better is eating people up\nbecause it creates constant restlessness\nin relationships in life in Pursuit and\nthen they need to go and\nmeditate to get calmer to be less\nrestless but the restlessness is this\nconstant pursuit of more better younger\nand therefore living with the feeling\nnot enough I don't have enough I'm not\nenough\nand that's the crisis that then follows\naround self-worth because you constantly\nwant more you end up constantly feeling\nnot enough yeah and someone else will\nmake me feel more than enough yes the\nevaluation you know the the the meaning\nof finding the love partner today is\nthat it will end my sense of constant\nself-\nevaluation I'm evaluating myself I'm\npresenting myself I'm selling myself I'm\ntrying to compete on the market it's\nlike language you know the the Romantic\nlanguage is about the market you know\nthe meat and then when I find you my\nbeloved I will finally stop the process\nof evaluation this is a thing from aao a\ngreat sociologist that studies love\nrelationships that's such a beautiful\nlanguage as well that you want to end\nyour process of evaluation when actually\na life story is an evolution of\nself-evaluation it's only going to come\nwith more do do you see there being\ninherent value in long-term committed\nrelationships or is that also a\nconstruct of society I see look I work\nvery cross-culturally right so I I don't\nthink the answer is the same if I am in\nBelgium in India in Turkey but I think\nthere is a lot of value in a long-term\nrelationship but the long-term\nrelationship has doubled in lifespan so\n100 years ago we lived half of now so\nthe long term gets keeps on getting\nlonger but there is also tremendous\nvalue in having had the possibility of\nfinally being able to end this and to\nstart a new or to never have had it and\nto start a new people who marry for the\nfirst time in their 60s or people who\nrealized that they had a beautiful\nrelationship for certain things and that\nnow they needed something else the\nmarriage was an institution that you\ncouldn't leave you got in and you got in\nfor life and if you didn't like it you\ncould hope for a Hur an early death of\nyour partner you know hope because that\nwas the only way out and especially for\nwomen I mean marriage has not meant the\nsame for men and women marriage for\nsame-sex people is very recent so the\nquestion has a lot of different pieces I\nthink that there is something very\nbeautiful in a long novel and I think\nthat there are beautiful short stories\nthere isn't a one siiz fits all at this\nmoment and the interesting thing is\nwe've been Crea about a lot of things we\ndisrupt we are creative about even\nfamily life we have Blended families\nsamex families single parent families\naccordian families but when it comes to\nromantic couples\nRomanticism the exclusiveness the\nmonogamous long-term model has been the\ndominant model for two centuries and and\nis quite um strong so I think we can be\nmore creative and in in rethinking\nrelational arrangements and relationship\nthat are more diverse and that bring in\nother people as in the community because\nwhat is happening in the long-term\nrelationship of today is not only that\nit is much longer but it is also much\nmore\nisolated longer loner longer and loner\none person to give us what normally an\nentire Village should provide and that\nis crippling the relationships under so\nmuch weight and so many expectations so\nthose those who do it well do it better\nthan the relationships of the past says\nEli but the majority of them don't\nmanage to climb the\nOlympus yeah and I you know I often\nthink about that because I think what we\nwere talking about earlier when I first\nmet my wife I definitely say that there\nwas so much of the Romanticism of the\nperfect relationship and I often talk\nabout in my book as well about how I\nproposed to my wife which was basically\nbased off her of Instagram and YouTube\nvideos how I invented a proposal that\nwas so not personal or not she liked it\nwell I'll tell you I'll I'll tell you\nwhat happened so and if anyone's heard\nthis story before I apologize but I I\nwant to estate have the context yeah so\nwe'd been together I think at that point\nfor like maybe I proposed off like a\ncouple of years M and so we'd been\ntogether I decided I was going to\npropose we were walking down the bank of\nthe river temps in London I had an\nAcappella group jumped out and sing\nBruno Mars will you marry me like marry\nyou to her they gave her a bouquet of\nflowers they performed this amazing\nnumber I got down on one knee I proposed\nwe both shed a tear she said yes uh we\nthen had dinner on the side of the temps\nwhere I had the kind of fagala table\nfrom a restaurant I had food that was\nbrought in but it was cold because\neverything had gone wrong on the timing\nso we ate cold food which was we didn't\nmind my wife is amazing so she didn't\ncare but it but I was looking at that\ngun going hm and then we walked around\nthe corner and we ended up on a white\nhorer Carriage that I'd booked that took\nus around London on this beautiful\ncarriage and it was a beautiful trip and\nthen we got on the train to go back to\nher parents and we got home to her\nparents her parents opened the door and\nthey said what happened to you to her uh\nshe had hives all over her face because\nthat was the day I discovered that she\nwas allergic to horses and I didn't know\nthat and she didn't know that and I've\nalways looked back and reflected at that\nstory because my wife said yeah she's\nnever complained about it she was happy\nwith it but when I really look at it and\nas I've got to know her more and more\nevery year and like you said I feel like\nI get to know more of her new things and\nold things every year we've been\ntogether for 10 years now and I still\nfeel like every day I'm discovering\nsomething new about her I realized that\nthat was the most impersonal show of\nLove ever it wasn't the song wasn't\nspecific to her the horer carriage\nwasn't specific to her the the food was\nthe only thing my wife would care about\nbecause she's a big foodie and that's\nher world and it was cold and I look\nback at that event and I go I'm lucky\nshe said yes but actually the hives were\na reminder to me of how little I knew my\nwife at that time or or the how eager\nyou were to impress how eager exactly\nhow I was a complete show of ego I was\num 20 maybe six 27 yeah uh and and just\nwhat a show it was as opposed to you\ncome from traditional amilies uh I would\nsay we come yeah like I would say we\ncome from more traditional families yes\nyeah definitely they're they're modern\nthinking but generally traditional\noverall in the world uh and it was where\nthey arranged marriages or were they my\nmom and dad were and pretty much hers\nwas as well yeah pretty much her parents\nwere as well so that's a major\ntransition so when you ask me about\nlong-term relationships I think people\nwho are in an arranged marriage system\nanswer that question very differently\nthan people Who start with the Roman you\nknow what the research says right what\ndoes I've seen bits but please clarify\nyeah I don't want to I think it's\nDaniel's research that U people who\nstart with romantic and falling in love\nand passion are much more likely to then\nexperience a a dissatisfaction in the\nrelationship then the majority of people\nwho start in an arranged situation which\nis much more\nrational actually their satisfaction\nRises as they get to know each other and\ndevelop the fness and the relationship I\nthink this is true if the relationship\nis good yeah if it's good but for those\nfor whom it was really not a good match\nit must be horrific horrific yeah and\nand I think the reason why I was sharing\nthat story was because I think what I've\nrealized and you were mentioning this\nearlier is\nthat I feel like I found the\nperson who\nhas helped me continue\nself-evaluation in a way that I would\nhave avoided with someone else or that I\nwould have tried to avoid if I would\nhave had multiple love stories whereas\nthis life story that I have with my wife\ncurrently is just the most\npurifying and cleansing detoxifying\nprocess\ninternally but in the most fun loving\nand caring way and I look at that and I\nI think about that often where I think\nto\nmyself I would have had to learn these\nlessons with anyone\nbut maybe someone else may not be able\nto challenge me as much as my wife does\nwith the lack of criticism and complain\nand judgment in a safe space with humor\nwhich actually makes\nit accessible to me and it's it's one of\nthese really interesting Reflections I\nwanted to share with you to hear your\nthoughts on that because I don't think I\nwould there are so many skills today\nthat I have only because I married this\nparticular person there are there are so\nmany\nemotional parts of myself that been able\nto discover because of this person there\nhave been so many you know you know what\nyou're telling me in some way is you\ndidn't succeed in impressing her I have\nnever succeeded in impressing my wife\nand the best that's her power you know I\nmean not that you're not impressive to\nher and that she doesn't appreciate and\nadmire but you didn't succeed till this\nday right and therefore her opinion\nmatters and therefore she can keep you\non your toes and therefore she doesn't\nlet you sit on your laurels and get away\nwith stuff and therefore she can see you\nin a more humble way when you come home\nfrom having done 40 stage events after\nanother where you get you know clapped\nthe whole time and you kind of lose a\nsense of you know proportions and that\nis an extremely I think that you're very\nlucky and not just lucky because you\nfound her but also because you knew you\nknew that you did need someone who\nchallenges you and who can hold hers to\nyou but do it in a way that doesn't feel\nauthoritarian or humiliating or ball\nbusting Etc and so it creates the right\nfriction MH she cares and she can\ncriticize she loves and she can\nchallenge you know it's both end and\nthat that holding those tensions in a\nrelationship is in my mind very\nimportant and very um gives a lot of\nstrength and energy to a relationship\nyeah I think yeah oh sorry please that's\nit I think the it's your self-awareness\nof it that is really good it's like if\nyou had somebody who just looks like\nthat it would have been a problem if you\nhad somebody who just did that it would\nhave been a problem but you knew that\nyou needed that yeah and I don't think I\nknew it before we started having that\nexperience but it it just became really\nevident to me that she loves me for who\nI am not what I do and and what I\nachieve and how I try to impress for\nexample and I think that's a great\nreminder for me to love myself for who I\nam and not love myself for what I\nachieve or what I do or what I create\nand I think that that is a really I'm\nlike that's the great it's very\nimportant yeah yeah to to have some yeah\nand and and it's also how you perceive\nit I think what you're saying is true\nlike I've talked about it with people I\ncould easily perceive it and people\ncould perceive it and say Jay you're\njust a pushover Jay you're just you know\nmaking it up you're making sense of\nsomething and it's bad treatment or\nwhatever and I'm like well no because I\ncan see that done from love and care and\nit's humor as you said like it's done\nfrom such a special loving place that I\nfeel that I know it's a\nknowingness that it is liberating and it\nis it is wonderful but it's interesting\nbecause I think a lot of people may have\nthat experience but they don't want to\nbe humble they don't want to access that\npoint and I'm fortunate that my my monk\ntraining is kicks in there and and\nallows for that vulnerability and\nself-reflection and not thinking I'm\nperfect whereas I wonder if that's we're\nscared to do that because we almost want\nour partner to make us feel perfect no I\nthink I think that this this thing of\nperfection is I think we want our\npartners to recognize us and accept\nus Perfection but it comes in the form\nof at least in the beginning demanding\nadoration and yeah but the beginning is\nonly the beginning it's one phase of a\nrelationship yeah you know I think my my\nfriend Terry real has beautiful\ndefinition self-esteem or\nself-worth or\nself-confidence is seeing ourself as\nflawed imperfect people and still hold\nourselves in high\nregard if you actually need to see\nyourself as perfect you lack the\nconfidence the confidence is the ability\nto make\nmistakes and not to not sleep over it\nfor three weeks because you feel such\nshame and such you know intense attack\non your identity but I have a question\nfrom you for you that from what You'\njust said do you feel that these days on\nboth sides of on all sides of the\nspectrum of the gender spectrum that\npeople are so enraptured with the notion\nof identity and holding on to the self\nthat they find accepting influence from\nanother person an instant threat of\ntheir identity like pushover pushover is\nis is like you know it's it's a power\nDynamic instantly when you use that word\nyou know if you accept what you wife\nsays what kind of a man are you right\nyou're just a pushover that's more in\nthe masculine version the women have it\nin the and but it is along the whole\nSpectrum something about the way we are\nso busy protecting our egos is making\neverything that involves letting someone\nelse actually have influence over us\nwhich is part of what being in a\nrelationship is about as an attack yeah\nI mean I'd love to discuss this with you\nand my My Reflection from what you were\nsaying and I was nodding along because I\nthere's so much of it that I agree with\nI think\nthat what I see is most of us struggle\nto know our self when we get into a\nrelationship so I think I'd propose that\nI don't think most people have a lot of\nself-awareness when they get into a\nromantic relationship ship so they don't\nactually have a conscious sense of\nself-identity we have a subconscious\nsense of self-identity in the sense of\nwhat our parents taught us and what\nfamily and media we have all this mix of\nstuff but we wouldn't if I asked someone\nto lay out their top 10 values they\nwouldn't be able to do that\nbecause they'd be like I'm not\nsure and what ends up happening I think\nin that scenario is you adopt the values\nof the other person and then at some\npoint you go wait a minute I've just\nbeen doing what you want and you think\nthat person made you adopt their values\nbut actually you just didn't know yours\nand so I think you see that happen in\nsome relationships in other\nrelationships I think what you're saying\nis true people are\nso definitive about their own\nself-identity that they go into a\nrelationship going I'm not going to get\ninfluenced At All by this person and I\nthink that also happens because we're\ngetting into long-term relationships\nlater in life so if you're going into a\nrelationship later in life chances are\nyou actually have you know who you are\nand what you want to do and what you're\nbuilding and what's important to you\nwhen you're younger you're less\nself-aware when you're older hopefully\nyou're somewhat more self-aware and so\nyou're more Concrete in your ideology\nbut the opposite could be equally true\nopposite could be equ when you're young\nyou think you know everything and you're\ncertain about stuff you have no\ncertainty about totally and when you get\nolder you actually become more flexible\nbecause you realize that there isn't one\nway for everything totally exactly so it\ncan be both ways and I think overall I\nthink the point that at least I think\nwe're trying to get to which I like is\nthat it's a bit of both there's there's\nit's almost like I read I'm trying to\nfind this poem and I can't find it ever\nsince I read it it's one of those I'm\nsharing it here because hopefully\nsomeone finds it I read this poem while\nI was researching and there was this\nbeautiful poet and I can't find it I've\nlike I've like looked for it and\neverything but this poet was talking\nabout how when you are single you've\nbeen building your\nhome with the bricks that you were given\nand your home is broken and some of it's\nbeautiful because that's how we are as\npeople some parts of our home make sense\nand some part of the bricks are falling\nout and he said when you come\ninto a relationship you want the other\nperson to move into your\nhome you want them to come to your home\nand the other person wants you to go to\ntheir home but actually what you need to\ndo is take the bricks you both like from\nyour own homes and build a new home\ntogether and I really love that visual\nthe idea that this unified agreement\nwhich was the language you used or this\nidea that you're saying of like how much\ndo I allow the influence without feeling\npowerless but to feel like we're\nco-creating something you know my wife\nand I have a lot of agreements that\nthey're not rules or contracts but\nthey're agreements of how we deal with\ncertain things and it it's something\nwe've created together it's not\nsomething we adopted from my parents her\nparents or anywhere else and I feel that\nif we walked into a relationship and\nsaid what do we want to build together\nwhat do we want to create together what\nwhat does a good healthy relationship\nmean to us to me those questions at\nleast feel empowering as opposed to\ndraining of power one of the\ncomplementarities in relationships that\nis that we are often\ndrawn to a person who brings\ncharacteristics that we are trying to\nget away\nfrom so true so true understand yeah so\ntrue so it's a I mean it it when it's\ndynamic IC it's really a very beautiful\nyou\nknow kneading of the dough yeah soest\nthroughout our conversation you've been\nreferencing this new course of yours\nwhich I'm

I never\nthought I never knew any of that like I\nliterally thought there were like three\nit sounds ridiculous but I was so\nlimited in my thinking growing up\nbecause of what I was surrounded by I\nwould change that I want people to know\nthat there are so many different I\ndidn't know you could be a therapist I\ndidn't know you could be a\nneuroscientist I didn't know you could\nbe I would
