    "transcript": "we're too connected all the time we're\nreading too much we're taking too much\nin we are constantly being fed by images\nand that's become the norm and it's we\nwe've been sort of marketed that that's\ncool that's what we should want but our\nbrains are not we are we are not that\nsophisticated a species yeah we have not\nevolved enough to be able to take in\nthat much information on a constant\nbasis and our kids certainly are not\nprepared to handle it I think that plays\na huge role in the higher rates of\ndepression and suicide among young\npeople they've got to let their brains\nrest from the noise even though you know\nwe're all trying to fix everything\neveryone needs a break from it"
