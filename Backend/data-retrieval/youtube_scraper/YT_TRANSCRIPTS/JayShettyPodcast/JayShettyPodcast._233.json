    "transcript": "every couple is different I found I I\nknow people who are each other's best\nfriends they like to travel together\nthey walk and hold hands and I I have\nfriends who are in relationships where\nthey talk like every hour I'm like are\nyou talking to him again nothing changed\nyou know it's up to the individuals to\nDefine that for themselves um that's the\nkey word yeah for Barack and I and I\nthink you should be clear about that\nbecause the other thing is that when we\nhold on internally to an expectation\nof the other we don't even share it so\nnow we're mad that you haven't even\nfilled something I never even told you I\nneed it you know that takes time and it\ntakes work which is why marriage is hard\nright because you'll have the tendency\nto live in your head and live out the\nimage of what you want them to be and\nyou haven't even communicated that to\nthem that's just one little fraction of\nthe challenge of marriage and friendship\nand all of that it's hard it takes time\nbut it's worth it"
