    "transcript": "instead of looking for secret to\nlongevity in a test tube or uh some sort\nof genetic code uh we very methodically\nfound these five areas where people are\nliving measurably longer and then\nbecause only about 20% of how long we\nlive is dictated by our genes 80% of\nsomething else then we took teams of\nscientists to find the common\ndenominators and the the corelates in\nour fast-paced world where we're\nconstantly looking for answers in\ntechnology we've overlooked this\nwonderful repository of time modern\nwisdom that if we stop pay attention you\ncan see not only is there plenty of\nevidence that these approaches work but\nalso it offers a path to longevity\nthat's enjoyable"
