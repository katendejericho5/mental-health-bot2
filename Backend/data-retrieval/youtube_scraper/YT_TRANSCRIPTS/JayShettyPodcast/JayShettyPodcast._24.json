    "transcript": "we make one of two mistakes we either\ntell everyone everything or we tell one\nperson everything if we tell everyone\nour plans everyone's going to have an\nopinion about your plan and that opinion\nmay actually discourage you and\ndisempower you because we're so opened\nup and exposed to people's opinions\nabout us and the opposite is also true\nthat if you only tell one person that\ncan be really hard as well because that\nperson may not have the tools or the\nresources or the experience to guide you\nand so having this Council of wise\nadvisers or guides or mentors or\nwell-wishers and friends can be such a\npowerful thing I think when people are\nsetting goals it's probably one of the\nbiggest mistakes we make today where we\nannounce it on social media to the whole\nworld or we tell everyone in our\nWhatsApp chat or group chat or whatever\nit may be and it can be really really\ntough"
