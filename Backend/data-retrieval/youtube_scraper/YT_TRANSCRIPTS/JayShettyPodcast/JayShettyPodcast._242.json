    "transcript": "you've said that you believe the best\nweight loss tool is the scale um I\nwanted to ask you about that because I\nthink for a lot of people getting on a\nscale is stressful it's like anxiety\ninducing they they look at it and it and\nit makes them more aware of a number and\nnow they get focused on a number and if\nthey don't make that number they judge\nthemselves and criticize themselves or\nthey call themselves fat or ugly or name\nyou know whatever it may be so how what\nwere you trying to get at when you were\npeople who step on a scale every day and\nconfront their weight and by the way you\nknow if your weight goes up yeah you're\ngoing to feel a little kick in the pants\nbut if your weight goes down there's a\nlittle endorphin surge it's a little\nreward and and setting up that system\nputting a bathroom scale in your way\npeople who self we every day after two\nyears weigh about 8 pounds less than\npeople who never self weigh"
