author of the\nbestselling book the moment of lift go\nand grab it if you haven't already\nplease welcome to on purpose Melinda\nFrench Gates Melinda it's such a joy to\nbe with you thank you so much for being\nhere I'm so glad we could do this I know\nme too me too and I want to dive\nstraight in I have so many questions I\nwanted to ask you but I wanted to start\noff by saying you've gone through a lot\nof changes recently so you just turned\n60\ncongratulations you're a grandma now I\nbelieve so\ncongratulations and I believe your last\nchild just left home and so now you're\nan empty nester too which not as much\ncongratulations but you've been through\nso many changes in your life and I\nwanted to start by asking\nyou what are your greatest T takeaways\non dealing with change the thing that\nseems to be the greatest constant in all\nof our lives but something none of us\nseem to be prepared for or comfortable\nwith how have you learned to deal with\nchange you know I think I learned to\ndeal with change pretty early in my life\nbecause I went away for college a lot of\npeople in my school state in Texas I\ngrew up in Dallas and I I embraced\nchange like I was excited to go away\nfrom college excited to meet new people\nand same thing after I left College I\nthen switched I went to college in North\nCarolina at Duke and then I switched and\nwent to Seattle to a brand new company\nhardly heard of back then Microsoft and\nagain I just jumped in with both feet\nand and I found it fun and I was curious\nto meet people so to me change isn't\nsomething to be afraid of it's more\nsomething to embrace and say oh okay\nhere I am I didn't expect to be in this\nplace in life but I am now so okay how\nam I going to make the best of it and I\ntry to stay open and curious because so\noften people will come into your life if\nyou have change in a new way or a new\nplace and I try to stay open and curious\nlike oh what might this person be here\nto teach me or what can I learn from\nthem or can I connect to them in a\ndifferent way so I don't know for me\nchanges in a certain way kind of fun and\nI embrace it where did that mindset come\nfrom because I feel so many people have\nthe opposite experience where change is\nscary change is daunting change is\nworrying I identify with how you feel\nabout change I chose to do pretty\ndrastic things early on in my life which\nmade me very positive towards change\nbecause I had to go against the grain I\nhad to disagree with people that were\nclose to me I had to not worry about\nwhat people thought about my choices and\nso I feel the same way as you do that\nI've seen change as a positive thing in\nmy life but when I speak to people\nchange is one of the most scariest\nworrying things where did your positive\nmindset towards change come from was it\na family member was there something that\nhappened early on in your life where you\nhad a change and you adapted well where\ndid that come from I think it probably\nwas my parents I mean my parents had\nboth grown up in New Orleans but then\nhad gone away when my dad went to\ngraduate school they got married and and\nmoved across the country to California\nthen they moved back to Dallas my dad\nworked on the early Apollo space\nmissions talk about change nobody had\never gone into space or gone to the moon\nand I saw how excited he was and he was\nexcited about being part of it and then\nmy co my parents gave my siblings and me\nI'm one of four um very middle class\nfamily growing up but they constantly\ngave us the message you will be college\ngoing there wasn't a choice you will go\nto college and it's a matter of where\nyou go you can go anywhere you want to\ngo in the country we'll take on the debt\nbut we highly encourage you to go out of\nstate we just think you will learn more\nabout yourself and the world if you go\nout of state and so I think because they\nhad that mindset I did choose a college\nout of state I went to Duke North\nCarolina and to me it just became kind\nof exciting and fun and I think if that\nat that formative time in life if you're\nwilling to go somewhere different and\ntry something out then maybe you're more\nlikely to do it later and then I never\nexpected ever to have the role that I'm\nin in philanthropy but once we started\nthe Gates Foundation I had the\nopportunity to travel the world and not\nthat I wasn't already traveling but I I\nnever would have gone to India I don't\nthink as many times as I did or so many\ndifferent places in Africa and I started\nto realize that the more you travel it's\nlike a book The more books you read the\nmore you learn the more you travel the\nmore you learn about people and and\nparticularly how similar we are and so I\nthink I think my my parents ingrained\nthat in me that's beautiful what were\nyour dreams back then obviously your\nmission is so clear now and we'll get to\nthat but I Wonder because when I see the\nwork you've been doing which is\nabsolutely phenomenal and the fact that\nservice is your entire life is so\ninspiring to me and you know something I\nAspire for in my own life but I wonder\nwhere did your dreams start going to\nDuke obviously an incredible institution\nin and of itself parents who wanted you\nto study and perform well we'll talk\nabout going to Microsoft but what were\nyour dreams back then when you're going\nto Duke like what was the sky the limit\nso to speak what was the sky at the time\nwell I was lucky that in in eighth grade\nmy parents sent me to a course that my\ndad had been through through his work\nhad just recently sent him called the\nsuccessful life course which I kind of\nthink is a little bit of a funny name\nnow when I look back on it but they\ntaught us a couple of things one was to\ntake quiet time in the morning and the\nother was to set goals like really have\ngoals for your life and don't\nnecessarily share those with the world\nshare them with a couple of people you\ntrust and so I set a goal of going to\ncollege I set a goal during High School\nof hey I realize I actually want to go\nto college in computer science so I\npicked a university that was good at\nthat at the time and I knew I wanted to\nbe a professional working woman\neventually with children and so I think\nthat sort of goal mindset really helped\nset me on my path to then go on to Duke\nand then go on eventually to a career at\nMicrosoft who ran this course it was a\nman and a woman Ed Foreman uh was the\nman and they were down in a a southern\npart of Texas and you would go off with\na cohort of people you didn't know my\nsister and I went together yeah you just\nsoaked it in and they gave us a whole\nbunch of books to read we had you know\nwe read Dale Carnegie's book on\ninfluencing people right and I think at\nthe same time I mean again very\nformative time in my life I'm in eth\ngrade I'm switching to a new high school\nbut in high school I had these very\nliberal nuns it was an ursul and Academy\nit was an all girls catholic school we\ngot the messages from all of our female\nteachers we could be anything we wanted\nto be in the world they were incredibly\nsupportive but the nuns also to taught\nus two things one was to take time in\nsilence there was a chapel in the middle\nof the school which wasn't a fancy\nChapel it was two classrooms but they\nwere put together you could go and have\nthis silent time they would send us off\non silent Retreats but they also sent us\nout to serve the motto of the school was\nServ on that is to serve and they taught\nus that you know one person just one\nperson can make the difference in the\nlife of another person and and if you\nare lucky enough to come to a school\nlike ursin and somebody's paying your\nprivate tuition which was my parents you\nshould serve and so I served in the\nlocal um Public School two miles down\nthe road and I saw the difference in\nthat public school for those kids versus\nwhere I was or the Dallas County\nCourthouse or the local hospital and so\nI think those values got embedded very\nearly on I love hearing that because\nthose courses sound so close to the kind\nof programming we offer today and I\nalways think about just how even in\nformal education you may not be exposed\nto some of these ideas which seem like\neveryone should have access to them and\nit's incredible that you know you had a\ncourse like that that you went to early\non I was going to ask you two questions\nabout that what have you found is the\nvalue of spending that time alone both\nfrom the course and obviously from the\nnuns that you got in your uh school like\nwhat have you found do you still do that\nwhat value what has been the greatest\nvalue that you've gained from that over\nthe last few\ndecades I spend time in silence almost\nevery single day and I just find for me\nit's often in the morning um before I\nexercise or get on my phone or whatever\nand I just find that that's the time\nthat you at least for me that I I can\nhear myself I can hear in silence those\nmoments of H I made a mistake yesterday\num I didn't quite show up the way I\nwanted to I wasn't my whole integrated\nself or oh wow I would really like to\nshow somebody today how grateful I am\nfor them I haven't I haven't gotten to\ndo that in the last week and so that\ntime in quiet for me is just it's a time\nto really connect to my soul and to and\nto I hope integrate um all the things\nthat have come um over time in my life\nor in the day before\nI also made sure when our kids were\ngrowing up that we went around the\ndinner table and we all said what we\nwere thankful for before we ate our meal\nand the Only Rule was you couldn't\ncriticize what somebody else was\nthankful for and ideally you'd come up\nwith your own and even when we'd have\ntables of teenagers for dinner everybody\ndid it and I was always just amazed what\ncame out of their mouth out of their\nmouths and it was just that little\nmoment of gratitude right and I think so\noften if we can stop and be silent and\nquiet and hear ourselves then the\nGratitude comes and boy does gratitude\nhelp you get through a lot of things in\nlife even hard things for sure for sure\nand and the second thing you mentioned\nthere was setting your goals but you\nshared something really interesting you\ntalked about how only with the people\nyou trust and I wanted to ask what was\nthe perception or the reason for that\nbecause that's really powerful I think\nfor people to hear so this course that I\nwent to this successful life course they\nsaid you know only share your goals with\nyou know a few trusted people because\nyou're going to have a lot of critics\nyou're going to have a lot of people to\nsay no way you want to go to that\nUniversity you you can't make that or\nyou want to be that in life no not a\nchance but a you trusted people who have\nyour back and have your interest in mind\nthey will help you meet your goal or\nfind your dream or Advance you towards\nyour dream and uh I found that to be\nvery true all through life actually and\nit becomes incredibly important to\ncultivate those relationships with those\ntrusted people and vice versa that you\nbecome there in their small circle of\ntrust yeah we make one of two mistakes\nwe either tell everyone everything or we\ntell one person everything so we either\nwant everyone to have all the answers to\nall of our questions and you're so right\nthat if we tell everyone our plans\neveryone's going to have an opinion\nabout your plan and that opinion\nmay actually discourage you and\ndisempower you because we're so opened\nup and exposed to people's opinions\nabout us and the opposite is also true\nthat if you only tell one person that\ncan be really hard as well because that\nperson may not have the tools or the\nresources or the experience to guide you\nand so having this Council of wise\nadvisers or guides or mentors or\nwell-wishers and friends can be such a\npowerful thing I think when people are\nsetting goals it's probably one of the\nbiggest mistakes we make today where we\nannounce it on social media to the whole\nworld or we tell everyone in our\nWhatsApp chat or group chat or whatever\nit may be and it can be really really\ntough you're fortunate that you gained\nsome of these exposures early on and\nthey've helped you in your mindset\nwhat's a lesson that you wish you would\nhave learned earlier what's a lesson\nthat you learned later on in life that\nyou wish you'd learned earlier I have\nlearned so many things later in life and\nyou know I think you also I have three\nchildren they're now in their 20s\nthey're not children anymore but you\nlearn a lot when you're parenting your\nchildren like you may think oh I'm a\npatient person but you have no idea what\npatience is until you have children and\nuntil you really are trying to pass your\nvalues on you have to really kind of sit\nwith okay what are my values I thought I\nknew them but am I living them so that I\ncan pass them on I would say one one\nlesson I learned later in life was that\nthe world really isn't built for\neverybody you know I kind of I I kind of\nassumed when I left I I was in such a\nsupportive environment in high school\nwith this all girl school that when I\nwent out to\nUniversity you know I just met so many\ndifferent people of different walks of\nlife which was fantastic and widening\nand and help me grow but then when you\ngo out in your professional career I\njust saw began to see so many blocks for\nwomen and people of color where I just\nassumed when we left University we would\nhave the same opportunities as men or um\neven as I traveled for the foundation I\njust assumed if we were getting a new\ntechnology out in a community it went to\nthe men and women equally that was just\na completely false assumption and I\nthink I didn't realize how the world had\nbeen maybe inadvertently um but set up\nfor men and you know I had to go back\nand learn some history to understand how\ndid we get where we are to say okay well\nhow could we start to maybe accelerate\nsome of that change what was the first\nexperience you had in your life like you\nsaid you had none saying to you you can\nyou know you can be anything you want\nand opportunities are available you had\nthat training when was the first time\nyou had personal experience of oh I\ndon't actually have the same types of\nopportunities as men well when I went\ninto computer science at Duke there were\nsome women freshman year but by\nsophomore year there was me and maybe a\ncouple of others and I realized that a\nlot of the young men freshman year were\nbetter trained than I was in computer\nscience so they were already coming in a\nstep up which is why we lost so many\nwomen I was trained well enough thank\nGod that I could persist and keep my um\nself-esteem up to move through and to to\ncontinue on but I just started to\nrealize part of the reason we don't have\nmore women in computer science and look\nhow important Technologies common our\nsociety we still don't have nearly\nenough women in the tech sector um\ncreating products it's\nbecause we haven't offered the right\nthere are many reasons but we haven't\nfor instance offered the right classes\nto young women so that when they go to\ncollege their confidence is up they've\nprogrammed as much as young men or that\nopening freshman class is a creative\nclass not just a coding tech class so we\njust we have whole Industries for\ninstance in the United States that just\nare not as welcoming to women politics\nin our own country is not at all\nwelcoming to women I mean women get\nharassed on the campaign Trails so much\nmore than men and they will tell you if\nthey want to run their campaign uh say\nthey want to become a state\nsenator they have to have had a certain\namount of money to do that which is why\nmen usually will have more money by a\ncertain point in their life saved up to\nbe able to run or a bud Bud will come in\nand will fund their buddy to be in\npolitics so it just there just many\nplaces where there are roadblocks and\nbarriers for women and people of color\nthat don't necessarily exist for a white\nman and I think we need to look at those\nand take some of them down so everybody\ncan can rise up into positions of power\nuse their full creativity yeah you said\nyou had to go back and study history a\nlittle bit to look at how that had\ntranspired what were some of the key\nmoments or key points of history that\nyou think were worthy of studying for\npeople to look back at and educate\nthemselves on that you think would be\nvaluable well for sure the US\nConstitution I mean there were no women\nin the room writing the Constitution\nthere no black people in the room\nwriting the Constitution if you try to\nimagine what we might have devised with\nother people at the table you know and\nnot counted women as you can't vote or\nyou're not smart enough to vote or uh\nblack people as slaves and so not worthy\nyou would have created a society if the\nright people were the table you would\nhave created a society that was probably\nmore equal for everybody and so you know\ngoing back and looking at that piece of\nhistory or looking at I just I couldn't\nunderstand as I would go out for the\nfoundation and meet so many women in so\nmany communities in Africa or southeast\nAsia who knew about contraceptives and\nhad had them and no longer did and they\nkept saying why why don't we have them\nyou have them in your country why don't\nwe have them we used to and as I I had\nto literally learn the history of\ncontraceptives around the world what had\nhappened with those and even where my\nown religion I grew up Catholic where\nthe Catholic church had not wanted women\nto have contraceptives and blocked even\nfunding for that and yet we know that if\na woman has access to contraceptives\nshe's healthier her family her kids are\nhealthier and the family's wealthier and\nit lifts them out of poverty and so I\nhad to learn that whole history before I\nwas willing to say okay am I going to\nstep into this very controversial issue\nI'm Catholic um I have a deep Faith um\nbut what's the right way to step in also\num that maintains my integrity and what\nI've seen but could potentially move\nthis issue forward because it's it\nliterally is a life and death situation\noften for women if they have their\nchildren too

me that's often where\nwe all find ourselves like I don't think\nthere's that much Clarity it's not\nalways black and white it's not always\neasy it's not always like this is the\nobvious path although we may try and\nmake it that way sometimes often there's\nso much more complexity in even trying\nto change the world or having a positive\nimpact in the world how do you tread\nthat carefully also recognizing that\nthere'll still be\nbacklash so this was all around 2011 and\n2012 when I knew we needed to have more\ncontraceptives in the world we needed to\nfurther this issue and I knew the\nfoundation could play a role in that and\nI started to realize that probably my\nvoice and that would make a difference\nuh as a female and I will be honest I\nwas terrified terrified to speak out on\nthis issue yes I was using\ncontraceptives yes I was educating my\nchildren about their bodies and and what\nthey should do long term but to step out\non the world stage and say this is what\nI believe and know I would be attacked\nby my own church um you know as a little\ngirl where I sat in the pews you know\nand saw who was at the top of the church\nlike that wasn't something I wanted and\nso I had to do several things one is I\ntook a lot of time in quiet to think\nabout what do I believe why would I do\nthis what are the ramifications for me\nmy children my parents my family what\nare the ramifications for the foundation\nwho can I have support me that that will\nhelp me learn and be and and maybe do\nthis in the right way I also um went\nback and questioned my faith a lot I\nstarted listening to a very liberal\nCatholic priest Richard Roar in his\nwritings that was incredibly helpful to\nme to realize you could push against\nsome of that some of those man-made\nrules and I listened to a lot and read a\nlot of brne Brown's work you know daring\ngreatly was hugely helpful to me because\nI literally felt like I'm going to step\noff a precipice and talk about this\nissue and I did eventually get attacked\nby the Catholic church and attacked from\nboth the left and the right but it was\nokay and the reason it was okay was when\nI had already talked to my kids about it\ntalked to my parents parents the people\nI cared about the most but also I knew\nwhat I had seen in the developing world\nI knew what women were asking me and I\nknew this tool made a difference in\ntheir life and so how could I have this\nplatform and be in this position and\nthem be willing to share their lives and\ntheir stories with me and me not use my\nvoice that that didn't make any sense so\nI really wrestled with all of that for\nprobably 10 12 months before I then was\nwilling to come out um and again I had a\ngroup of small group of female friends\naround that I said oh I'm going to do\nthis and it's going to be scary but I\ncould sort of talk it through and work\nit through right um and then when you\ntake that one courageous step and and\nthen it does start to snowball and it\ngoes better than you think in some ways\nworse in some ways than you thought but\nokay then you're not as a at least for\nme I wasn't afraid then for other\ncourageous steps I needed to take in my\nlife later on yeah I think there's so\nmuch wi the the idea that first of all\nknowing who you are and what matters to\nyou at a very core level I think a lot\nof us sometimes do things because we\nthink they look good or they might work\nout or someone will but but knowing that\nI feel this is important and it matters\nto me I love the idea of what you're\nsaying of speaking to your friends the\npeople around you and recognizing that\nit's not all oh it's going to be great\nand everyone's going to love it no\nactually there are going to be consequen\nes ramifications challenges and then the\nidea that it took you 10 to 12 months I\nlove hearing that because I think we\noften think that our best decisions or\nbig decisions are instant and We Know It\nAnd you kind of flow in the moment but\noften we have to sit with these things\nand see how they sit with us in silence\nacross a period of time definitely and\nso I love hearing all of that I think\nthat's really valuable you've talked\nabout you know tell me about your\nexperiences with impostor syndrome\nbecause I can imagine even when you're\ntrying to make these changes and maybe\neven earlier in in life maybe what was\nyour earliest experience of impostor\nsyndrome oh gosh um probably at the\nfoundation um probably the first 10\nyears of the foundation's life I felt\nlike an impostor here I am I'm a\ncomputer scientist I knew that\nbackground I had gone to business school\nso I knew economics but here we are in a\nwhole different field I mean I I'm\nliterally it's a whole second career for\nme I'm learning about biology I'm trying\nto understand from people in global\nHealth what can be done I'm you know I'm\nlearning from doctors I'm learning from\ncommunity health workers on the ground\nbut I just I didn't feel like I could\never know enough to speak credibly on\nthis topic because I I didn't go to\nschool in global Health you know or I\nwasn't a doctor but it took some time\nand again someone actually inside the\nfoundation uh who was working for me at\nthe time came to me and and wanted me to\nspeak out on something and I said no no\nI I don't feel like I know enough and\nthis woman said to me she said are you\nkidding just look at all the traveling\nyou have done like go back and let's\nlook at all the trips you've done and\nall the knowledge you've amassed she\nsaid how many people have ever done that\nkind of travel in that way to be in\nthese communities and to be at the\ntables where the scientists I could come\nback and scientists would explain things\nto me and I could ask and I thought oh\nmy gosh I guess I do know enough and\nI'll never know everything no one will\never know anything everything on the\nhistory of the Earth but I know enough\nto know what I know deeply at a core\ncore level and to speak those truths and\nI started to realize there would be\nvalue in a woman doing that because I\ncould speak on behalf of so many of\nthese women that I had met and who'd\ninvited me into their homes or shown me\nthe tough circumstances of their lives\nand I thought okay I've just got to go\nget over this um if if I if they've\nspoken to me I need to speak their\ntruths in the world and so um again I I\nthink the first brne Brown book I ever\npicked up was the gifts of imperfection\nand I learned to embrace all these\nplaces in me that I do see as imperfect\nI still see as imperfect I am an\nimperfect person you're an imperfect\nperson we all are but to embrace those\nparts of myself instead of push them\naway and say but I'm probably enough I'm\nstill enough to be this messenger yeah\nwhat advice would you give to people who\nare listening or watching and have that\nimpostor syndrome it's so easy\nto there's there's goodness in that\nbelief like I've always found that when\nI do doubt myself there's actually\nBeauty in that because it's a humility\nin accepting that I don't know there's a\nthere's a goodness in accepting that I\ndon't have everything figured out I I\nactually think we often play down that\nso much today we make it sound like it's\nterrible to have impostor syndrome but\nto me any one who has a conscience or or\na reflection mechanism will will feel\nthat pretty much whenever they grow into\na new phase so I find it very useful to\ndisplay to me what's missing what I've\nnot learned yet what I need to study\nwhat I need to become educated about a\nfocus on how would you guide and advise\npeople who are sitting here listening to\nus and they're thinking Melinda I don't\nfeel like I'm enough I I feel like I'm\nnot well placed I don't know enough I'm\nnot good enough I'm not whatever else it\nmay be how would you guide them through\nthat well I think it's what you said you\nhave to actually see the beauty in the\nimperfections somebody one time gave me\na heart that had all of these sort of\nholes in it in a funny way and and I was\ngoing through something really tough and\nshe she's part of my spiritual group I\nI'm also in a spiritual group\nnon-denominational spiritual group and\nshe gave it to me and she said Melinda\nthis is probably like your heart right\nnow like you thought it was kind of\nperfect but no it's imperfect but it's\nthose holes and those difficult places\nthat have formed you into who you are\nnow as a person and so I would say to\npeople start by looking at what messages\nyou grew up with in your home what\nmessages are you getting in your\nworkplace what messages are Society\ngiving you and are those possibly not\ntrue and start to say to yourself yes\nthere are places in me that are\nimperfect and I agree with you I think\nlooking at those helps us remain humble\nand not narcissistic or our egoic self\nin embracing those and saying but\nthere's Beauty in those and what can I\nlearn from them but I do think once you\nEmbrace those parts of yourself you at\nleast for me I just know I feel more\nintegrated more like a whole person\nright and then sometimes you also need\nto go back and make amends there are\ntimes where you've really you know made\nsome mistakes or said something hurtful\nto someone and once you Embrace those\npieces going back and making amends also\nI think again helps you feel better\nabout your core self because then you\nare living even more in the truth and\nthe beauty of who you hopefully want to\nbe what else do you do in your spiritual\ngroup and how did you what is what does\nthat look like as people I'm sure\nlistening and watching you also want to\nhave a spiritual group a community a\ntribe what does that look like what do\nyou do and how does it function yeah so\nthere are eight of us women that are in\nthis group we formed it in 2001 at the\ntime we all had small children you know\ngoing through school and we were of\ndifferent religions actually one or two\nwere just no came from no religion at\nall and we just agreed that we would\nmeet monthly second Wednesday of the\nmonth and we would pick a reading or a\nbook um and we would\nall be with it sit with it read it\nwhatever it was we all committed to\ntaking some time in silence every day\neven if it was only 10 minutes and then\ncoming to the group and having it be a\ntrusted Circle where we could share our\ninnermost thoughts about that spiritual\nreading about something going on in our\nlife and um it just became a group that\nbecame Central to my life and and I\nwould say vice versa I know these women\nincredibly well and their trials and\ntribulations and losing a parent or not\nsure they're going to how the marriage\nis going to go or gosh I didn't parent\nvery well in that moment or here's where\nsomething has touched me deeply in my\nlife nature um and then we go on a\nsilent retreat at least once a year um\nand we're in silence usually for two or\nthree days sometimes we'll have a leader\ncome and guide us through that other\ntimes we've done it enough now that we\nkind of go on our own um but it's just a\nplace of deep close Community where I\nwould say we can touch one another's\nsouls and touch our own Souls wow and\nand you've been doing that since 2001\nuhhuh wow that's inredible years yeah\nthat's unbelievable yeah what what is\nwith with with a community like that how\ndo you select who gets to be a part of\nit because I guess life was very\ndifferent 23 years ago everyone goes\nthrough so many different evolutions of\nlife and\nphases how do you pick who stays who\nleaves who goes and and build that\ntogether how does that work well at the\ntime that we formed the group we didn't\nall know each other so there was\nconnective tissue between I would say\nthree of us who then brought in others\ninto the group and there we formed\nenough trust over time that we knew you\nknow the information wouldn't go outside\nthe group you you didn't go tell your\nspouse or your certainly your children\nor your mother and we had one hiccup\nwith one person in the group who it just\nover time that person was clear wanted\nto spin out and so she did that was okay\nbut it just became this place of trust\nand and life lessons and sort of\nMilestones we've been through so much\ntogether and I wouldn't say that we all\nare best friends like some of us are\ncloser than others or the groups reform\nbased on somebody losing a parent or but\nwe're just there for each other like we\nhave each other's backs and it's it it's\nwhen I was thinking about coming out on\nthese on talking about contraceptives\nand being a bit more public for the\nfoundation which I hadn't been before I\ntalked it through with this group first\nthey were one of the first places I said\nI going to do this and I am terrified\nI'm absolutely terrified and I knew they\ncould almost be a trust counsil for me\nto tell me the truth of well look here\nbe careful there know you're going to be\nokay um and it's almost like we kind of\ngrew up together that's beautiful and\nthese are old P they're just at the time\nthey're just people you're meeting\nbecause I think often we feel like we\nhave to be surrounded by like everyone\nwho's 10 years ahead of us and 15 years\nahead of us and everyone has to be a\nmentor but we underestimate just how\nmuch our peers and and the people that\ngoing through life at the same time at\nthe same\nPace are so powerful in our lives and we\nunderestimate the people that almost\naround us we do sometimes and you know\nmany of the women in this group are\nmaybe five or six years older than I am\nbut you also don't know like one of them\nthat's very close to me and age her\nhusband was one of my best friends and\nshe we lost him at a age 37 I mean who\nexpects that you know and you're in your\n30s and you lose she loses her husband I\nlose one of my best friends\nso these these moments also I think form\nyou and you know help shape who you\nbecome so yeah it doesn't always have to\nbe somebody older and in fact because my\nyoungest daughter um I had the youngest\nof all the children in the group my last\none was the youngest I ended up also\nthough not in my spiritual group but\nwith other friends then who were younger\nthan me and that was lovely too there's\na lot of wisdom there and you know I\nhave three other siblings I am\nextraordinarily close to my brother\nwho's 10 years younger than me there's\nso much wisdom there so I think it has\nmuch more to do with is the person on a\ngrowth path right and then can we\nmutually learn from one another\nabsolutely you've talked about having an\naddiction to\nPerfection uh you know and I think\nthat's something that a lot of us deal\nwith what's your relationship with\nperfectionism now H well it was awful as\nI I go uh um how bad was it tell us it\nwas terrible walk us through what would\nit look like uh you know dressing right\nsaying the right thing in in you know at\nat even like a dinner party or a\ncocktail party or or something like this\nwhat if I messed up and said the wrong\nthing on a podcast oh my gosh you know\nand so it was horrible it was absolutely\nhorrible it was zapping my energy and um\nand it was driving the people around me\nI finally realized crazy too like\nsomebody you know who would help prepare\nme for something at the foundation if I\nwas going on a trip you know I was\ngrabbing all these facts and figures and\nit just was so\nunnecessary and so when I finally really\nlooked at it and again read this book on\ngifts of imperfection and started to\nwrite down all the places that was\ncoming up in my life or start to notice\nit like oh my gosh before I leave my\ncloset I'm you know it's taking me 10\nextra minutes how silly is that like I\ncould have 10 minutes to go be in\nsilence or be with my kids or and so as\nsoon as I started to identify all the\nplaces I could break them down and it\ndoesn't mean it doesn't still come up um\nI was going to a a very small dinner\nparty last week with with a couple that\nI really respected but didn't know well\nand I was going with two other\ngirlfriends and literally the hour\nbefore that I went to get a bit of time\nand quiet and I realized that feeling of\nnot knowing enough was coming up that\nperfectionism I need to know this what\nif they asked me this about the\nfoundation oh my gosh and then I just\nwas like no stop just stop I'm going to\nbe enough and might be some things I\ncan't answer tonight that I for you know\nI forgot that particular statistic you\nknow cuz I haven't been in that country\nin a while but so what once you can\nstart to let it go and again I could\njust say okay well I'll just be myself\nthen it then it's fine yeah and how do\nyou stop that recurring voice that\njudges you criticizes you maybe even\nafterward says to you oh you shouldn't\nhave forgotten that statistic oh if you\nwould have said this then imagine how it\nwould have gone I think it's hard enough\nto quiet the voice before you go let\nalone the voice that comes afterwards\nthat kind of puts you down even further\nand says you could have done so much\nbetter you should have done better and\nespecially as someone who's come from a\nhigh performing college and and job and\neverything else like how is that how is\nyour relationship with that voice\nevolved um I used to get that so much\nafter an event or something i' done it\nalmost never comes up anymore it maybe\ncomes up maybe how I stopped judging\nmyself and when I stop and I also sto\njudging other people when I learn to not\njudge other people I realize you have to\nlook at when you judge somebody else and\nyour fingers pointing this way you know\nlike Byron Katie says there's three\nfingers pointing this way and so I\nrealized if I had a judgment about even\nsay a friend right well gosh I needed to\nlook at is that is that judgment really\nabout them or is it about me and so\noften the thing I might be picking on in\nmy mind about them was actually about me\nand so I had to learn to say to myself\nokay what is it in myself that I don't\nlike um and can I just be okay with that\nand so boy I believe me I've made so\nmany mistakes my my kids tease me all\nthe time I'm terrible with people's\nnames and yet it's a sign of respect I\nthink if you use somebody's name they\nhave endless stories about how I made up\nyou know how I messed up their high\nschool friends names but it's okay I was\ntrying to be respectful I'm human and it\nh and I also think the more I can\nhumanize myself in front of other people\nthe more I take down the barrier between\nme and them and we can see we are just\nhumans right MH absolutely absolutely\nwhat do you do you judge yourself do you\nlater say to yourself oh I should have\nsaid this I should have said that I\nthink it took me a long time to get to a\npoint of giving myself Grace there you\ngo and not making myself feel that I had\nto be anyone else apart from myself and\nthat the perfect\nperformance wasn't actually satisfying\nto me it just gave me more to have to\nlive up\nto and so when I first started doing\nwhat I\ndo it felt like in every room in every\nconversation I had to say something\nmagical and miraculous and profound and\noften I'd say something very basic yet\nit would feel that way and sometimes I'd\nsay the most profound thing and it would\nbe seen as basic and I started to\nrealize very quickly that if you were\nspending most of the time in your head\njust trying to figure out how\nto be a certain way or come across a\ncertain way which is what all of us do\nsure you actually lose the opportunity\nto be present and have the experience\nand probably say something and hear\nthings that actually have an impact on\nother people because you're actually\nthere and so it was learning to trust\nmyself and trust that whether I knew the\nright thing to say or I didn't know that\nthat was perfect just as it was but I\nthink that that Grace is something we\nhave to develop and cultivate and build\nbecause it's so natural I was just at I\nwas just at Gman sex on Monday we were\ndoing a talks at Gman sex and it was all\naround the benefits of mindfulness mixed\nwith a high performance culture and so\nit's like how does that work if you're a\nhigh performing Trader what does it mean\nto practice mindfulness and Grace\nthere's not a lot of space for Grace if\nif you're losing $20 million or whatever\nelse it may be and 200 million it could\nbe so much more so what does that look\nlike to give yourself Grace and I think\nwe equate Grace to weakness we think if\nI'm kind to myself then that's weakness\nand actually I found that guilt blocks\ngrowth for sure that guilt doesn't make\nyou grow guilt can maybe make you feel\nbad for a second and push you in the\nright direction but over a sustained\nperiod of time guilt will drain you\ntotally so I think Grace does what guilt\ncan't it says I'm going to give some\nspace to where I'm at so that I can get\nback on the horse whereas if I just\nguilt myself I'm going to keep pushing\nmyself down into the ground I'll never\nget back up my thinking on guilt is that\nsometimes it can point to where you're\noff of your integrated s and it's very\nimportant to pay attention to that um so\nfor me when it comes up in silence I try\nto really look at okay was I off of of\nwho I want to be grace is one of my\nabsolute favorite words and it's\nsomething that in difficult situations I\nactually pray for like I I will pray for\njust bring some Grace to this moment\nwhatever that means and I think so often\nagain I think sometimes if we're trying\nto say the right thing or do the right\nthing or not say the wrong thing we're\nkind of actually in that egoic part of\nourselves as a point as opposed to\nsaying just let Grace come through\nwhatever is meant to to be let it happen\nin this moment and I will say for me\nbecause I have traveled a lot to these\nrural settings low-income countries and\ncommunities I will often pray for grace\nbefore I go in and for the conversation\nto try and drop any judgments I have so\nI can just meet the person where they\nare at and they can meet me and I can\nsee is there's something that can come\nout of this of beauty a learning that\nmaybe we can work on or they can work on\nor um but yeah Grace is actually one of\nmy absolute favorite words oh I love\nthat how how hard was it to give\nyourself grace through the divorce\nbecause I feel like that feels like for\na lot of people can feel like one of the\nbiggest failures challenges stresses\nit's one of the hardest Transitions and\nchanges that you go through in life how\nhard was it at that time to give\nyourself Grace what did that look like\nyeah I um that was the hardest thing I\nhad ever been through in my life let me\nbe really clear about that um why well\nyou have an image I had I I thought I\nwas going to be married for life I\nthought you know I'd be married 50 plus\nyears and so all of a sudden you see\nthat even despite very very much\nwork um and and counseling that that\nwhat you had doesn't actually exist and\nthat for me I couldn't go forward that I\njust there wasn't enough trust any\nlonger um and so it wasn't something I\nwished for I certainly didn't think I\nwould be in my late 50s and be divorced\nyou know like I didn't it was okay that\npeople were divorce I didn't have some\nproblem with that but I didn't know that\nwas going to be me\nand it was incredibly challenging I I I\nI I've never cried so much my whole life\num and I prayed a lot for grace for\ngrace for myself for grace for my\nchildren for grace for the situation\nthat we would somehow get through this\nas a family behind the scenes and hope\nto God it wouldn't be public before we\nwere finished because I knew that would\nbe a whole another thing and I think\nsometimes the only way I got through was\nbecause I do have a faith um and thank\nGod I had close close friends who I\ncould talk to on the hardest days and a\ngood therapist but um it is not\nsomething I would wish on any family it\nis a very very difficult thing to go\nthrough um because you're pulling apart\nsomething that has been tightly woven\ntogether and that you believed in um and\nI will say though on the other side\nthere can be a lot of beauty you know\nonce you get through the rough patches\nand things finally kind of calm down for\nthe whole family and everybody on the\nother side um there can be a lot of\nbeauty so I never thought I'd be in my\nlate 50s I'm about to turn 60 and be\nsingle again right who who expects that\nbut I didn't but hey it's pretty great\ntoo you know and um\nso I I look for I just I look in the\nhardest of hard times I say to myself\njust pray for grace and know there'll be\nsomething that comes out of this\nstruggle I'd read a book years ago many\nyears ago um called Awakening Joy by\nJames Bar Barz and shos Alexander and\none of the things I had learned from\nthat book I carried it around in my\nbriefcase for years or my tote bag is\nthat you can hold joy and sadness side\nby side I had somehow gotten to that\npoint in life you know in my 40s where I\nhad thought oh there are these amazing\nJoy moments or these really sad low\nmoments no you can hold both side by\nside and realize that even when you're\nreally sad there's going to be Joy again\nit might take 10 minutes it might take\n10 months it might take 10 years but\nthere's joy and and both exist and um I\nstarted to learn to be able to hold that\nDuality yeah it's it's so interesting to\nme I was I was speaking to someone\nyesterday who'd just broken up with a\nfive-year relation ship uh not not\nmarried just a partner and they were\nsaying to me they were like I I know\nthere'll be better days but I can't see\nhow right now like I know it but I can't\nsee how right now and I think that that\ndiscomfort is probably one of the most\npiercing emotions that you can have\nbecause sometimes people even go as far\nas they'll never be another good day but\nsometimes we can see there's a good day\nbut we don't know when what talk me\nthrough the emotion of when you know\nsomething is ending and your vision of\nwhat something was is\ncrumbling and you don't know what that\nnext phase looks like like walk us\nthrough the\nemotional navigation of that because I\nfeel like that's what so many people\nstruggle with people it's it's one thing\nbeing like okay this is ending now but\nthere's so much when that Penny drops\nalmost like when that emotion drops from\nyour head to your heart of like okay I\nknow this is not working out anymore but\nthen it kind of goes here and you go oh\nthat that's really uncomfortable and\nthen you actually have to follow through\nwith it walk us through navigating that\nwhat does that\ntake I have had to learn the last 10\nyears I would say um to really feel\ndeeply feel my emotions in my body like\nthat emotion you just described from\nhere to it's not working to drops as you\nsaid into your heart and I got to make a\nchange it literally felt like a stab in\nthe Heart Like I could feel it here like\nand\nso I\num I just knew it was something it was\nsuch a such an enormous consequential\ndecision that I needed to take time with\nit um and I needed to be kind to myself\nI didn't want to I wanted to minimize if\nI could the pain to those around me but\nit's just it's gut-wrenching that's\nprobably the best it feels like a stab\nin the heart at least to me a stab in\nthe heart and gut-wrenching cuz it's not\nwhat you want to do but that's when I\nthink your friends come in and they are\nthe lights and the moments of Grace and\nthey can hold out for you and remind you\nthe hope on the other side you're going\nto be okay I knew I was going to be okay\nbut I'm sure there's going to be\nsomething beautiful on the other side\neven though none of us know what that is\nwhat's something you know now that you\nwish you knew then you will find\nhappiness again you know you you can\nfeel like I had days where I thought I\ndon't know if I'll ever be happy again I\njust I don't know um you will absolutely\nfind happiness and you'll find happiness\nin sometimes really unexpected ways or\nunexpected places right um and I don't\nknow at least you learn at least for me\nI learn to appreciate the world more\nappreciate my friends more my family\nmore being in nature um yeah so you'll\nbe happy again you just can't feel it in\nthe moment thank you yeah no I'm I I\nreally hope that everyone who's\nlistening and watching that resonates\nwith them and being able to find that\nGrace being able to\nnavigate those challenging emotions\nfeeling it in their body\nbecause yeah it's just when you hear\nsomeone say it when they're actually\ngoing through it it's\nit's yeah it's one of those things where\neven your closest friends don't even\nknow the right things to say because and\nsometimes there isn't the right thing to\nsay I mean it's it's also like when\nsomeone passes away right sometimes you\njust need somebody to walk with you or\nsomebody to just cry with you you know\nand um\nand there are no words\num but I always know too when my friends\nstep in in those moments I will step in\nfor them or for somebody else right\nlater on um and so again I I learned\nthrough the process that you actually\nhave to accept help right I wasn't so\ngreat at that I was good at helping\nother people but not so good at\naccepting it myself and I had to learn\nto accept that help because I it isn't\nsomething I could go through alone you\nknow I think sometimes we make the\nmistake in the world of thinking\nyou know I'll Soldier on I can do this\nalone no I mean we can only really do\nthings in community and it takes\nCommunity to feel held and secure and\nsafe enough to move forward in whatever\nit is we're doing our professional\nPursuit our love life our parenting of\nour children if we're going to do it\nwell it takes Community yeah what was\nthe most recent thing you asked help for\nI was struggling with something about a\nweek ago and so it's personal though and\nso I asked a friend to go for walk I\njust said could we could we walk and\ntalk like I have something I really need\nto to work through here and um yeah so\nI'll pick up a phone call a friend say\ncan we go for a walk or I'll text\nsomebody right um and you know we have\nways of telling each other can you drop\neverything versus okay this can wait\ntill tomorrow you know but for sure I do\nit all the time and I hope I I hope I'm\nthere and have the backs of of my\nfriends as well so wonderful\num I wanted to dive into some of the\nissues that you're focusing right now\nthrough the work that you think are the\nbiggest issues facing the world from\nyour perspective if you had\nto if you could narrow down to three\nthings that you're like these are the\nthree things we're trying to solve right\nnow which would have scaled impact what\nwould they be and what are they I'd say\nit's really one thing and it's making\nsure that women and people of\ncolor can walk into their full power\neverywhere in the world and we need to\nget women and people of color to all\nplaces in society whether that's in\npolitics because they make different\npolicies State houses Congress\nparliaments um we need to make sure\nthey're empowered financially we you\nknow we do not invest in women-led\nbusinesses or people of color businesses\nthe way we do in male businesses white\nmen's businesses that's just the truth\nin the VC community and then culturally\nwe need to have more of those stories\ncome forward I feel like if we don't\nAdvance the world on behalf of everybody\nelse we're going to just keep falling\nbackwards we're going to keep falling\nbackwards into these potholes that we\nhave and so I would like to see you know\nmore women be able to step in their full\npower everywhere in the world and it\ndoes it's hard it means breaking down\nsocial norms in certain places it means\ninvesting in women-led businesses it\nmeans thinking about things differently\nin the workplace\num and but I think the world would be so\nmuch better off if the people making our\npolicies looked like the rest of society\nall of society so in the US that means\nyou know having more Latinas who are\nthere more people of color who are\nmaking policy more women making policy\nwe would just reflect more all of\nsociety instead of a certain Echelon of\nsociety and you know still for instance\njust to give you one example I go places\nin the world and people just kind of\nscratch their head and say the US has no\npaid family medical leave policy no\nfamily leave policy like don't you care\nabout your children you know and and\nthen you go to place like Sweden or\nNorway who've had it for 30 years and\nthe men it's not just the women the men\ntake time off at the birth of their\nchild well guess what then they\nparticipate more they're more involved\nwith the child things are more balanced\nin the home\nand so but it's because we don't have\nenough women in our US Congress and\nSenate and other places to be able to\ncreate those policies right we have them\nin 13 states now but we don't have a\nfederal policy yet that just shouldn't\nbe not in this day of of working parents\nwhere most couples both parents are\nworking if they have kids and\nsystemically what does that actually\ntake like to actually achieve that like\nwhat is that what is the actual work\nthat's to go on behind the scenes to\nmake that happen because I think we only\never hear about it if it becomes news\nlike you're saying if someone gets voted\nin or someone gets a position of power\nbut what's happening years and years and\ndays and days behind the scenes to make\nthat happen like what does that actually\ntake it means there are lots\nof groups and that organize and work on\nthis but it means funding women's\npolitical\ncampaigns supporting them when they get\nharassed on the campaign Trail giving\nthem the tools so that when they get\ninto these Halls of power they know how\nto make good policy right um in the past\nwe just have not done that we haven't\ndone it at scale so that's one example\num in the Venture Capital space it means\nreally looking at Women's businesses and\nseeing just because they don't look like\nthe other businesses we've seen these\nare valuable businesses or people of\ncolor but we have to break down the bias\nthat has been there that says oh well\nyou don't take enough risk or I've never\nseen a business bu like this before or\nmaybe you you're not trained up in the\nright way we have all these sort of\nbiased excuses instead of saying no\nlet's fund these businesses and then\nwhat happens is you'll have women and\npeople of color if you have them in all\nplaces in society at the top it means a\nyoung woman can look up and say oh\nthere's three dozen archetypes of women\nwho are politicians there are three\ndozen archetypes of women CEOs I don't\nwant to be like those six but I want to\nbe like like one of those two young men\ncan look up and see three dozen\narchetypes in politics three dozen\narchetypes as CEO three dozen archetypes\non Wall Street right and go I don't want\nto be like those guys but I want to be\nlike those we're just not there yet and\nso we've got to invest more in this if\nwe're going to create true lasting\nchange in the country yeah no I I can I\nmean definitely speaking from the person\nof color point of view like I can I\nnever was I was never raised with that\nbelief system that were any things that\nwere outside of my possibility my\nparents were\nvery uh my parents never made us feel\nthat a color of skin would hold us back\nand so we worked hard we pushed forward\nand it was only until much much later\nprobably more recently where I started\nto realize certain\ndifferences and it was almost as\nif I not that I'd hidden not that they\nwere hidden from me or that I wasn't\naware of them it was just I started to\nrecognize ized how differently even\nsometimes I was criticized or looked at\nversus counterparts who who may not have\nthat like I would would often hear\nthings like you know well Jay's using\nhis culture of meditation to make it\nspread across the world and that's\nwatered down and it's not the truth of\nhis tradition or whatever it may be and\nI was like wait a minute but this is my\ntradition like this I grew up with this\nI'm only sharing what's actually from my\nhome country and where my parents came\nfrom um how fascinating that there have\nbeen other people who have taken that\nculture and spread it all across the\nworld and never had to deal with that um\nfeedback whereas that's feedback that I\nhave to deal with uh and it sounds very\nrandom and and Niche but that point\nbeing the same that sometimes you're\nheld to a different standard you are\neven though even though it is your own\ntotally and and they're just it's bias\nor it's people projecting on to you\nbecause they haven't seen somebody like\nyou before like and and so they'll and\nit'll be I think a lot as a woman I'll\nsay a lot of times it's these sort of\nlittle indirect ways that things come in\nno you can't no you shouldn't no we've\nnever seen one like you before and so I\nthink if we you know somewhat I was\nlucky I got protected being an all girl\nschool but it wasn't until I went out to\nthe workforce and I hear even men talk\nabout these days look I've educated my\ndaughters and sons equally you know in\nschools but then I send them out into\nthe workforce and my son sort of Soares\npretty easily and my daughter just keeps\nhitting these barriers right and so\nthose are some of the things we have to\nlook at as a society and take down have\nyou ever heard anything from your own\nkids that that felt like that where you\nlike oh no like less so them\nspecifically but their friends for sure\nfor sure um particularly their friends\nof color um and my sense of that was\nalways just to support them and tell\nthose kids you can be anything you want\nto be just cuz that white person tells\nyou no uh-uh I see you I you've been in\nmy house I see you I know what you're\ncapable of keep going right or or also I\nthink you know\nsome men are more networked in the world\nthey're they're more natural networks\nthey Connect into so again sending girls\nout or kids of color and connecting them\ninto our networks so they get that first\ninternship so the corporation sees them\nas like oh my God they are talented\nright but we they don't there aren't\nthose natural networks to connect them\ninto today or we have to push harder to\nget them in right and I think all of\nthose kinds of things can help what are\nthe top three values that you wanted\nyour kids to embody that you felt were\nreal priorities for them to operate as\nhumans in the world today I wanted them\nto be\nkind I wanted them to develop their\ntalents whatever that was because I I\nsaid to them you have some inherent\ntalent that is up to you to figure out\nthat you can give to the world whatever\nfield that is in and number three you've\nbeen lucky to grow up in the United\nStates and to grow up in a situation\nwhere you didn't have to worry about\npaying for your education or your health\ncare or your housing like you are lucky\nso you you have some you have to give\nback to the world so just as my parents\nsaid to me you will be college going my\nkids got the message is you will give\nback to the world now I've always said\nto them have your own career first you\nknow know know what you're good at but\nat some point you are expected to give\nback and um I've actually been\npleasantly surprised that all of them\neven in their 20s have figured out how\nto give back um in different ways and um\nagain it goes back to that thing that I\nlearned in high school which is we can\nall one of us can affect somebody else's\nlife right if you grow up in the United\nStates you you are lucky even in a tough\ncircumstance in the United States you're\nlucky compared to way people grow up in\nmany other countries how did you guide\nthem through the process of growing up\nwith such famous parents and and known\nparents because I've that's a really\nhard thing like to grow up where\neveryone knows who your parents are\neveryone recognizes your name everyone\nhow how have you helped them navigate\nthat because I can imagine that's not\neasy at all it was it was difficult for\nthem and I knew it was going to be\ndifficult when they were young um well\ntwo things one is we didn't have the TV\non in the house so they literally didn't\nknow in fact their father was kind of\nwho he was in the world he was just dad\nin the house you know and I was not out\nspeaking in the world that much then and\nso we enrolled them in their schools\nunder my name my maiden name French and\nit would give us two to three weeks\nwhere I would be dropping them off at\nschool and they were just like everybody\nelse nobody knew their dad was who he\nwas and it wasn't until he showed up\nthat people went oh those are his kids\nbut by then they were already in the\nschool and they were just we were seen\nas a normal family so that was done\nintentionally super intentionally and I\nsat would sit down with the\nadministration before the school year\nand talk about the values we had and I\nexpected them to be treated like\neverybody else's kids and if my kids\nwere acting out I wanted to know about\nit or if they were acting wealthy I I I\nI went to school I went to University\nwith other wealthy kids and I wasn't I\nsaw how some of those kids acted those\nweren't going to be my kids so that's\nhow they started Elementary School and\nthen as they got to middle school and\nhigh school we would have conversations\nwith them about would you like to keep\nyour mom's name or would you like to\nadopt Gates and different ones chose\ndifferent things of the three of them at\ndifferent times but we just didn't make\na big deal about what we were out doing\nin the world you know their world they\nwere very protected by their schools and\nby our home life yes they grew up in a\nvery fancy house but you know they had\nchores they knew that they were they had\nan allowance we didn't just buy them\nsomething and when they finally got to\nthe age where they had a phone if they\nbroke their phone there were rules about\nhow that got replaced we just didn't\ngive them a new phone right so they grew\nup with that and I think it taught them\nthe value of money it taught them that\nokay they could see when when also when\nI was out speaking more they knew why\nthey could see what their dad was doing\nespecially in philanthropy then oh my\nparents are living out their values in\nthe world um but they were very\nprotected by their schools and I think\nthat served them incredible ibly well\nhow old were they when they got their\nfirst phone uh so my oldest daughter the\nconversation was about a flip phone and\nthat was in fifth grade and she finally\ngot it in sixth okay and the difference\nbetween when she went through high\nschool then versus my youngest which was\nsix years later through the same High\nSchool two girls because son in the\nmiddle but the two girls the difference\nbetween not having social media in high\nschool and my oldest went through and\nthen my youngest having social media by\nMiddle School just profoundly different\nin terms of parenting um it was just it\nwas like a switch went on and even the\nadults in the school having a phone it\nwas just so different but we did have\nrules early on ever you know they\nplugged their phones outside their room\nat night where I could see them and when\nI'd wake up at night and go look that\nphone better be in the place that it was\nsupposed to be now whether they snuck it\nback to the room for a few minutes and\nbrought it back I've now learned a\ncouple of them did that\nbut um you know we had rules about those\nthings and I think that that served them\nwell how do we how do we create a\nculture of giving in service Melinda\nbecause I think some people would look\nand say oh it's easy to do it when you\nhave billions to give away or you know\nMillions to give away or whatever else\nit may be and I remember in in my\nspiritual tradition one statement that I\nalways used to love is uh God doesn't\nsee how much you give God sees how much\nyou hold back and it was this idea of\nyou know and I've always appreciated\nthat sentiment because and I found so I\nhad parents who were very giving even\nthough our household income for me\ngrowing up was no more than like\n50,000 and my parents were still very\ncharitable in the way they could be and\nit set a really good turn for me and\nthen when I lived as a monk we did a lot\nof service work and that has continued\nin my my life afterwards as well and\nthat continues to be an important part\nof my wife and I's life of wanting to\ngive back wanting to serve but it's I\nthink it's it's hard because we're so\nmany people are struggling financially\nso many people are struggling\neconomically there are far less\nopportunities that people have to even\ntake care of themselves the prices of\nrents you know soaring through the roof\nlike Healthcare in this country of\ncourse is you know the biggest concern\nand so I think what you were saying\nearlier is that people who have\nopportunities and have the privilege to\ngive should give but I think often we\ncan sit and the thing of well when I\nhave a million or a billion or whatever\nmaybe then give how how do we shift that\nlike what does that look like I think\nyou can all there are different ways to\ngive you can give your time your energy\nor your money or any combination of\nthose so I think there's value in high\nschool kids and even middle schools\ngoing out and volunteering you know my\ntwo of my three children worked on the\nteam crisis text line and boy I mean\nthey really had to learn how to counsel\nwhat to do they had to show up but they\nlearned a lot about out you know other\nteens in crisis they benefited from it\ntoo I had one of my kids worked out in\nthe community in a homeless shelter\nright and was helping with the food\nservices so there are so many ways to\nhelp in our own backyard and I always\ntell people start there because you'll\nget attached to something and you'll\nstart to see that your time absolutely\ncan make a difference in somebody's life\nright and even if you can't give much\nmoney or at the end of the year you can\ngive $50 or $100 to that organization it\ndoes help um and so I I just encourage\npeople to start somewhere even if it\nfeels really small to them when they\nstart you learn something from all those\nexperiences yeah and I definitely found\nthat I think service is one of those\nthings\nthat and and I you know there's it can\nbe seen as the most selfless or the most\nselfish thing because it gives you it's\nthe best learning experience of learning\nabout the challenges that exist learning\nthat when you're part of solving a\nproblem you feel the solution is closer\nright I think like you feel like there\nis a light at the end of the tunnel\nthere is a method for sure and you know\nservice has given me so many gifts in my\nlife and therefore I will never say it\nit's been selfless because I've gained\nso much from it uh but the biggest thing\nit's helped me understand is just that\nyeah when you feel you're part of\nsolving a problem it feels manageable it\nfeels possible and seeing one person's\nlife change is is miraculous and I think\nif we see it as statistics or dollars or\nnumbers then it will never feel like\nenough because numbers will never\nsatisfy or make us feel like we won\nbecause we know there's more but\nwitnessing change Through The Eyes of\none individual I mean nothing can\ncompare to that and you you'd have no\nidea how many lives you've changed just\nthrough that impact and the great\nopportunity you gain to even have\nsomething to give it's a privilege to\nyou it's such a someone's giving you the\nopportunity to serve they've served you\nby giving you the opportunity I think we\noften feel like we're helping others but\nI've found so often that I'm fortunate\nenough that I'm even in that position\nthat I can give that to someone yeah and\nand you learn from those people too you\nlearn culturally you learn things that\nyou wouldn't have known even about\nyourself right there's a quote I love\nthat I used in actually my high school\ngraduation speech it was by Ralph Waldo\nEmerson and it Ends by saying to know\nthat even one life has breathed easier\nbecause you have lived that is to have\nsucceeded and so wow even for me even\nthough I was goal oriented I wanted to\ndo this and I wanted to do that my\ndefinition of success was if somebody's\nbreathed easier on this planet because\nI've lived then my life was worth it\nright and you know if you talk to\nanybody who does hospice at end of life\nor if you've gotten to walk the end of\nlife Journey which I've been fortunate\nenough to do with two people in very\nclose you realize that you know people\nwant to know at the end of their life\nthat they were loved by their family and\nfriends and that they loved their family\nand friends in return and that their\nlife had some meaning whatever that\nmeaning is for them um and so you know I\nI often think in the US we have our\ndefinition of success wrong you know we\nlook at these people who've made an\nindustry or made x amount of money but\nno success is like think of that teacher\nwho if we all talk about like who who\nhad the most impact in our lives quite\noften people will talk about their\nparents or a teacher or a coach totally\nand so think about it a coach in a\nschool doesn't make much money but he or\nshe has an enormous impact on the\nstudents that come through that High\nSchool absolutely and play that Sport\nand so to me there's enormous value in\nthat and those are the kinds of things\nwe should be holding up in society I've\nI've had this dream and maybe we'll\nspeak about it another time uh but I've\nhad this dream for a long time in\nregards to that because I grew up in a\nhome where I remember you know where my\nextended family or family members would\nalways want to wait for the Times rich\nlist like that was published every year\nand obviously then it was the Forbes\nrich list became the new thing and then\nnow we have the time 100 list what\nwhatever it may be and I always dreamed\nand I've still have this dream that I\nwant to do it one day is I want to\ncreate a service list and I'd love a\nservice list to be published every year\nof individuals and groups of people who\nare doing the most service and Not only\nwould I like it to be a list of the\npeople who give the most money I'd like\nthem to nominate\nsomeone who works on the ground to be\nnominated to be on that list totally\nbecause of the unknown name that not\nfamous people basically doing amazing\nwork around the world that I'm sure you\nknow many of and I've always had this\ndream that we could publish a service\nlist every year because I feel like if I\ngrew up in a home where there was a\nservice list on my table every year I\nfeel what we reward in society is what\nwe\nrepeat and I don't see service being\nrewarded or seen as an achievement yet\nor it's seen as the achievement of a\nfew and until it becomes something that\nis accessible and open to many will keep\nlooking at the rich list and being blown\naway by that and thinking that's the\ngoal of life it's it's hard to change\nthat if the only list that every major\npublication is publishing is the wealth\nlist how will we ever shift what\nachievement is in the society so anyway\nthat is that is a really good idea\nbecause and again the people doing the\nreal work are the people who are giving\nof themselves and in service and as you\nsaid you see see change even change at a\nGrassroots level we all get so\noverwhelmed by these Global problems and\nthey are overwhelming but again the only\nthing that's ever changed the world are\ngroups of individuals coming together we\nseem to forget that you know so yeah a\nservice list would be amaz find a way to\nokay I know I know about a hundred\npeople I could put on that list amazing\nI love it well let's find a way of\nfiguring it out U Melinda it's been such\na joy talking to you today you've been\nso kind and gracious with your time uh\nwe end every purpose episode with a Fast\nFive a final five
