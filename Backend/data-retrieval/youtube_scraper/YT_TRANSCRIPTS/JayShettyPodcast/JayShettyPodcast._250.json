the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett the first time I met you was the\nfirst week I moved to LA wow because I\nmet Jeremy who you've been working with\nfor a long time I love you Jeremy and\nJeremy introduced to\nus and this was in\n2018 and I loved how genuine you were\nhow down toe you were like it was so\neasy to chat to you like we we hit it\noff right away and I wish you lived in\nLa still so we can hang out all the time\nI know bro I know we keep talking about\nthat right but no it is it's it's so\nlovely a to be here with you bro so\nproud of you and what you've done you\nknow what I mean uh I know that you have\nguests on and it's about them but you\nknow what you've been doing I've been\nwatching everything it's amazing makes\nme proud and you know obviously we're\nboth from England you know both from\nwhat what part of London were you from\nNorth London North London okay so I was\nWest London obviously houndo uh south of\ncourse first standard as cliche as it\ngets for any Indian but you know it's\nnot easy right um having these lofty\ndreams you know and then being here in\nLa which is literally the land of of\ndreams and Broken Dreams let's be honest\nabout that there's people who have goals\nbut there's also Broken Dreams so to be\nable to you know do what what you're\ndoing and what I'm doing is is it's\nreally beautiful so yeah thank you for\nhaving me man yeah man well let's let's\nlet's start there because I think I find\nit really interesting at one point in my\nlife I think I had Big Dreams when I was\na teenager but I never actually believed\nthe dreams could be real because I\ndidn't have Role Models people I could\nsee doing those things did you always\nhave Big Dreams in a belief that that\nyour life could go down that way you\nknow um bro the one thing about me ever\nsince I was a kid I always wanted to a\nwork my hardest try my hardest and apply\nmyself uh I've been a very driven person\never since I was a kid and I think\nreally and so so is my brother I have\none brother Nar and I think both of us\nhave that we share that same quality\nwe're very very highly driven people now\nthat comes solely from my parents it\nreally does um my dad is a big big\ndreamer big dreamer bro\nand I only found out recently like when\nI started going into music and my\nbrother went into film that these were\nalso my dad's dreams but they were\nhidden my dad always you know my dad\nused to write poetry and nobody ever\nknew it but he ended up being a\nbusinessman and a very successful\nbusinessman um but seeing my dad's Drive\num and my mom is super hardworking as\nwell we were always inspired by by that\nlike wow like how did Dad do this he had\nthree factories they used to manufacture\ndenim they like you know top top man and\nRiver Island all these places they used\nto make all the jeans and it came from\nnothing came from just a vision so that\nwas them but then also they put us into\nuh private school now private school in\nEngland as you know it's it's it costs a\nlot of money now I could have gone to a\nschool in the area that I lived in hsow\nbut it wasn't the most affluent area at\ntime it wasn't the best school system at\nthe time so my parents wanted to be able\nto put us into an education system where\nthey felt like we could\nExcel and so they did but that was a\nsacrifice\nthey didn't get to go on holidays every\nsummer and go to Barbados and that money\nthey invested into my me and my brother\nand I think because I saw that sacrifice\nwe always wanted to work hard so we we\nyou know we knew what they were doing it\nwas for us um but the school that we\nwent to was I think and Lara school I\nhave to shout them out because an\nincredible school because not only did\nyou have to be smart to get in so you\nhad smart kids but they weren't like\nstuffy I go to latim and I don't do\nanything fun no it was creative they\nwere fun we had we had so much of a\nlaugh and it was an old boy school and\nthe reason I'm telling you that is we\nweren't getting dressed up during the\nday to impress girls I wasn't doing my\nhair to impress girls so how did you\nmake friends how did you become the\npopular one everyone was smart you had\nto have something you had to either be\nthe funny guy or you had to be the the\nathletic dude or you had to be like the\ncaptain of the football team so\neverybody excelled but at in a in a in a\ncompetitive way but like in a nice\nfriendly competitive manner so that has\nalways been my nature to to do well and\nto to apply myself to whatever I do and\nI think I've been like that my whole\nlife that's why I I always you know I'm\nalways doing different stuff picking up\ndifferent projects because if this is\nall we got bro you know why not make the\nmost of it do do the things you enjoy\nand try to try to see how far you can\nget with them yeah yeah definitely what\nwhat what was it like having those\nconversations with your parents in those\nearly days yeah because we've talked\nabout it a million times and every\nIndian has that pressure and even course\nyou know the other night I was at an\nevent and it was the same thing where\nlike Indian parents are talking about\nthis idea of just like doctor lawyer\nengineer we've heard it a million times\nof course you were on that path you were\non that path to make your parents the\nproudest Indian parents of all time\nbecoming a doctor and I think there are\na lot of people who listen to this and\neven if they don't have an Indian\nupbringing they may have an upbringing\nwhere their parents' expectations mean\nsomething absolutely and their parents\nexpectations are important to them\nbecause they love their parents and they\nsee their sacrifice a lot of people who\nare listening may be thinking my parents\nwork so hard I look ungrateful if I\nfollow my dreams what was that like\nabsolutely listen that's such a good\npoint Jay because I of course I get\nasked that question a lot right like and\nand some people might not know you're\nright I was on my path to being a doctor\nit's not just necessarily an Asian thing\nwe can really break this down because as\na parent now myself I understand what\nit's like to want the best for your kids\nyou want them not to struggle you want\nthem to have a profession you don't want\nthem to be like oh yeah you know I have\nthis dream I want to be an artist\npainter and this that and you're like\nthat's great I love that but I also\ndon't want you to struggle for money I\ndon't so you don't have to be an Asian\nparent to want your kids to do well in\nschool job mhm but the Asian thing the\nreason it's a stereotype I think\npersonally is because we were immigrants\nMH so therefore you can come with a\ndream and you could you cann't come on a\nship from India come to England and go\nhm I want to be a professional gymnast\nthey'll be like what shut up bro you\njust left the pend you've left the\nvillage you need to earn money so the\nour grandparents didn't get to have a\nlofty dream they just had to work hard\nthey had to work two jobs sometimes\nthree jobs to put food on the table so\nthen therefore that also gets passed\ndown to the to their kids um but with my\nwith my particular situation um the\nmedicine wasn't my parents' dream for me\nit was actually mine I was a super nerd\nin school bro I loved getting straight\neight grades I I loved working hard and\nthen seeing the fruits of my labor so\nwhen I used to get those top grades it\nmade me feel like I'd achieved something\nand it wasn't like oh Mom and Dad will\nbe happy I knew they'd be happy as well\nbut it was like I'm happy for myself I\nworked hard for this right so I actually\ngot fascinated with science I still am\ncompletely and utterly fascinated with\nthe human mind and the human body so\nbefore I did medicine actually bro I\nactually not many people know this I\nthink you might be the first person who\nknows this I actually did a degree in a\ncombined science degree in Psychology\nand biology oh I didn't know that yeah\nright so I did a degree in Psychology\nand biology Bachelor of Science um I\nfully enjoyed it and then I was thinking\nI'm going to go on to perhaps become a\npsychologist or a psychiatrist I wanted\nto help people I wanted to get in that\nwas always been my thing ended up qu\napplying for medicine and did two years\nof medicine but like anybody you have\nhobbies my hobby was music so I was\nprobably about 12 or 13 years old when I\ngot obsessed with hip-hop I couldn't\ngive it up I was writing RS at the age\nof 13 because I was watching\nthese rappers from do you remember y I\ndon't know if you remember this probably\nto show my age to show my age here um y\nMTV Raps okay used to be because in\nEngland growing up in England we didn't\nhave access a of course we didn't have\nthe internet back then we didn't have\naccess to all of these hip-hop shows so\nwe had this cable show on MTV and it\nwould come on and it was called yo MTV\nRS with Ed Lover and Dr Dre I had MTV\nBas with Trev Nelson yeah yeah yeah\nexactly and westw yeah westw all of that\nobviously I'm going complet off top I\nbut but yeah like point being you know\nthe the applying yourself and and the\nworking hard and all that stuff it was\nanything I took an interest in I would\ntake it to the extreme so science work\nAcademia interested in it want to do\nwell took it to the extreme let's go one\ndegree all right no but I want to do\nthis too and in my head there was\nnothing saying you can't do that there\nwas nothing saying you done your degree\nbro chill now go get a job I was like no\nbut I'm also want to do this and I think\nI've always been like that my whole life\nso there I am studying medicine but I\nalso want to for some weird reason Go on\nstage and rap and I was a rapper then\nyeah I wasn't a singer yeah anyway so\nI've always been juggling bro I've\nalways been juggling things that I'm\npassionate about yeah what's what's been\nsomething that you think you've taken to\nthe extreme more recently or is that\nmindset still there or has that changed\nas time's gone on so it's not\nnecessarily taking things to an extreme\nrecently but I have really been\ninterested in uh being you know the\nentrepreneur side of the entertainment\nindustry and it's for a number of\nreasons okay first of all being an\nartist this is going to like next year\nis going to be 20 years of me being an\nartist that's amazing and it's and it's\ncool but it doesn't have to be\neverything I do for the rest of my life\nmhm I've been so blessed to be able to\ndo music literally if you think about my\njob I write songs then I sing songs and\nI go around the world and I travel and I\ntry to make people happy when I'm\nperforming my my music but that doesn't\nmean I don't have other interests it\ndoesn't mean that I'm like for example I\nlove restaurants and bars I love them\nanytime I go to a um a different city\nfirst thing I do either before or after\nmy show like where can we go where do\nthe locals go and eat what's the local\nCuisine here what's where where should I\ngo and Sample this city so that I can\nget to say I went to Milan and I knew\nwhat that felt like yeah so then I was\nlike my dream was always like I want my\nown restaurant I want my own bar so then\nI did that you know we set up an Indian\nrestaurant called Nama and a bar called\nswitch and that was fun cuz it allowed\nme to use a different side of my brain\nspace and all of a sudden now making\nentrepreneurial decisions which I never\nreally got to do through music because\nit's a different field so I like so you\nknow and we have the yoga studio that\nyou know my wife Tara owns and runs so\nall of these things keep life\ninteresting for me and I think that's\nthe thing I want to do as much as I can\nand enjoy it and and see where I can\ntake it but it doesn't mean you try to\ndo everything because you don't want to\nbe a jack of You Know Jack of all trades\nmaster none it's just what fills me and\nand so that you know I think that the\nrecently it's been the entrepreneurial\nuh stuff yeah yeah yeah that's awesome\nwhat has been like you spoke about\nearlier like breaking that stereotype of\nit's not only you know families want\ntheir kids to like you know be taken\ncare of and do well in the music\nindustry walk me through what that was\nlike because I think even as a British\nIndian and and an Asian South Asian\nperson I don't think we necessarily know\nwhat it was like because I think when\nyou grow up in England especially in\nLondon and around the I mean to be\nhonest all across England Indian culture\nis very accessible of course it's\nnormalized it's everywhere and then\ncoming to the US I don't believe when\nyou did that it was like that as far far\nas I know and what did you feel you were\nworking with what were you excited about\nwhat did you come up against that you\nwere trying to make sense of because I\nthink there's a lot of people even right\nnow I think everyone in different\ncultures different Traditions different\ntrajectories has to face some form of\nresistance some form of stereotype some\nform of opposition and I've always\nappreciated your way of navigating these\nthings because I don't think you look at\nit as like oh my God everyone's against\nme I don't think you live life that way\nwalk walk us through what's through your\nmind yeah of course man so I guess we\nshould really just take it right back to\nthe beginning right so to answer that\nquestion you know I'm I'm there I'm a\nstudent I'm a medical student um I'm\nobsessed with hip-hop still I'm obsessed\nwith music My Love for hip-hop had also\nlike then gone of into R&B as well cuz\nthey were sort of Hand inand by then um\nthe good times yeah good I just saw Asha\nlive in Vegas oh did this weekend oh man\nit it's you know it's again I'm my God\nbro there's so much that we can talk\nabout about these things because you say\nthat and he took you back to a he\nliterally transported you back to a\nperiod of your life which 16 and what do\nwe what were the stresses when we were\n16 nothing passing our exams get doing\nwell in our GCS everything else was\nchildhood it was it was Big Dreams it\nwas you're Fearless you can take on the\nworld you want to do anything and\neverything and life is just good you had\nmusic was great then just you know Vibes\nwere there right and and that's what I\nwas experiencing I was I was listening\nto you know all of that same kind of\nstuff Usher and and you know um and\nJagged Edge and black street and all\nthat stuff and and I used to think to\nmyself every time we went out and we go\nout clubbing with my friends and stuff\nit would always be especially in London\nas you know this quite a heavy um Indian\ndemographic I shouldn't say just like a\nyou know a an Asian demographic what we\ncall Asian in England they call South\nAsian here yeah tons of us in all these\nclubs we' go to concerts I'd go and see\nFuji in concert or I'd go and see you\nknow D effects I'd go and see Lords of\nthe Underground all of these people\nstill a bunch of of Asians there and at\nthat time I had started writing and you\nknow I had a friend of mine who's a DJ\nand we used to make these mixtapes me\nand my cousin and we used to make\nmixtapes just for our own fun and then\nour friends would be like actually\nthat's pretty sick like can you make me\na copy fine give him a copy make and all\nof a sudden it was kind of spreading\naround school and then that chubby nerdy\nIndian kid you know became cool H all of\na sudden in school and that that felt\nnice but that was just in school it\nwasn't happening on a major level\nanywhere there was no Asian mainstream\nartist on stage that we could go and\nwatch who would sing and or rap the\nmusic that we love so we would go there\nand I'm like I'd be at an Asha concert\nand I'm watching him and I'm watching\ntons of Asians scream for user and I'm\nI'm there I'm in the mosh pit but I'm\ngoing why isn't one of us up there we\nclearly love this music if we can listen\nto this music and we can buy this music\nwhy can't we make this music why can't\nwe be the one up there on stage and I\nthink when that click switched for me\nthat changed everything because again\ntalking about how I just thought nothing\nwas\nimpossible I said said well I'm going to\ndo that why can't I okay how do I do\nthat all right I'll enter Talent\ncompetitions so I did and I'm\nsimultaneously\nstudying but then I'll be listening to\nChoice FM at the time it was Choice F I\nlove Choice FM yeah back in yeah right\n107.1 or something like that uh\nsomething like that right 96.9 I think\nit was 96 I think it was both I think it\nwas one of those ones that was yeah\nright yeah yeah exactly so anyway I'll\nbe listening to Choice FM and there was\nthis Talent competition and it was\ncalled Commander B's Night Flight okay\nit's around about midnight and all you\nhave to do you have to pick up the phone\nspit your best verse or sing at the time\nI was just a rapper right I was obsessed\nwith hip-hop so I said all right what\nhave I got to lose picked up the phone\ndropped a little\nrhyme you either get flushed you got the\ntoilet flush sound or you get passed on\nto the next round I got\nthrough eventually they chose the top\n100 in the country\nand then that 100 was put down to was\ncut down to the final 20 then the final\n20 had to perform live in brickton\nAcademy okay that was my first time on\nstage ever and when I looked around Jay\nI'm not lying to you I was the only only\nnon-black non-white person in that room\nand I didn't think about it at the time\nbecause you're not going you're not\nyou're not looking at at that you just\ngot the mic in your hand and you've got\nan opportunity and you're going this is\namazing how did I even get here this is\nso fun it was fun but now looking back I\nwas like I was the only Asian kid and it\ndidn't scare me and so therefore you\nknow I just did what I loved and I did\nit without fear and I ended up coming\nthird in the whole competition and\nthat's what gave me the confidence to\nknow that I can I think I can take this\nsomewhere how did you have that courage\nand guts at that age and I guess it's\npart of that extreme Focus mentality but\nlike I feel like today I have so many\npeople in my life that I know that are\nscared of posting on Tik Tok or posting\non Instagram or putting out like for you\nto like drop that verse on a phone call\nyou know other people are going to hear\nit other people are going to find out\nabout it when you're on stage of course\nyou're laid bare in front of all the\naudience I think so many people today\nget in their heads and they're like well\nI can't post that I look stupid or I\ncan't do that I'm not good enough and\neven people who are really talented stop\nthemselves from putting things out there\nbecause they're scared of what their\nfriends will say I remember when I\nposted my first video it was the people\nclosest to me that criticized it or\nridiculed it it wasn't the it wasn't the\naudience the audience actually responded\nfairly well for day one but it was the\npeople around me that said Jay you talk\ntoo fast uh Jay that point didn't make\nsense Jay you're editing is not as good\nas it should be like that was coming\nfrom people I knew whereas the comments\nwere like oh I love this I just shared\nthis with a friend and so I feel so many\npeople have that block what was it for\nyou that gave you that courage to say\nthis is fun I love that idea this is fun\nI'm doing what I love and I actually\ndon't care how how did you have that\nthen I didn't care and you're right you\nknow the reason why I didn't care back\nthen because in order to find out\nsomebody's opinion they had to actually\nbe in front of you and talk to you about\nit in person yeah right now we live in a\nday and age where we've got connection\nwith every single human being on the\nplanet we're not built like that bro\nwhere our brains are not built to have\nthat many connections with that many\npeople we're just not built like that\nthat's why we get anxiety that's why we\nget because we know that I post this\nit's going to go out to the world and\nthen 99.9% of the people who react are\npeople I don't know and I have to take\ntheir criticism on board but we weren't\nbuil to be able to deal with that we\njust not designed to be able to deal\nwith that much so therefore of course it\noverwhelms us of course it gives us\nanxiety of course we get depressed\nbecause user Z z15 99 said this about me\nbut we don't know that person so when I\nwas a kid I just did what I did because\nI didn't have the opinions of too many\npeople around me and even if I did like\nyou said it's and that's another that's\nanother great Point often the people who\nare around you may might not have the\ncourage to take a step out of the\ncomfort zone like you did or I did so\ntherefore they're just like I don't know\nbro or maybe it's love maybe they're\njust like I don't want you to be sad if\nsomeone says something about you I don't\nwant you to be hurt if it doesn't work\nout mhm I just loved it that's the only\nthat's the only truth of it all is when\nI tell you that it was an obsession\nJay I was\nobsessed with hip-hop and and R&B but\nlike not just the culture the technique\nokay so if I was to really break it down\nobsessed with the fast rappers of that\ntime that's what it was I was obsessed\nwith Big L I was obsessed with chip Fu\nfrom f shickens i was obsessed with\nJay-Z with original flavor and the way\nthat they would rhyme it was very very\nfast and that to me was just so cool at\nthe age of 14 how are you wrapp in that\nfast so I would emulate it and I would\ntry to do what they were doing I was\nlike damn how did they do that so it\nbecame like this nerdy Obsession and\nthen when it came to singers it was\nvocalist how are you singing like that\nhow are you doing those runs how are you\ndoing those riffs so I would study them\nI would study Boys to Men I would study\nall these guys and copy their riffs and\ncopy and that's how I sort of learned\nhow to rap and how to sing by literally\njust admiring ing these people who had\nsuch a great skill set yeah yeah and so\ntherefore when I learned how to do it\nfor myself of course I wanted to just go\nand have a go at it yeah so why not go\nup there and have a go and and it wasn't\nbecause the end goal was going to be a\nrecord deal I didn't know I wasn't\nthinking that far ahead the end goal was\nI love doing this if you love football\nyou want to kick a football around you\ndon't want to just do it in your back\nGarden if you get a chance to play on a\nbig pitch are you not going to go yeah I\nlove that the Simplicity of their answer\nis beautiful because I do think that is\nlove that carries you through and I\nthink today it's almost the opposite\nit's the inverse right so at that time\nwe didn't have a lot of Role Models or\npeople that look like you or people like\nyou that had made it and I don't just\nmean that by race and gender and back I\njust mean in general in life Fame and\nsuccess and careers like that were\nreserved for a few they're only a finite\nnumber of TV channels finite number of\nmusic artists finite number of actors\nall very mysterious and unreachable and\nnever knew how they got there today we\nlive in the opposite where it's like all\nyour friends are influencers everyone\nhas your friends are famous yeah every\neveryone's everyone's doing something\ninteresting you know someone in your\nfamily who a network who's figured\nsomething out like people are running\nbusinesses there's entrepreneurs here\nthere's this and that someone has a\npodcast whatever so now it's almost the\ninverse where it's like now you see it\nhappening so much that now you think it\nhas to work out that way so that time\nyou just said I never believe I never\neven thought about a record deal now\nwhen you start making music all you\nthink about is a record deal because it\ndoes feel Within Reach or it does feel\nlike someone else did it and I fully\nagree with you when I put out my first\nvideo all I thought was I love sharing\nthis wisdom I'm tired of just sharing it\nin small rooms of five people I think\nthe wisdom should reach more people and\nI'm just trying to see if it works but\nthere wasn't there wasn't a goal or a\nstrategy or a whole approach like one\nday it's going to be this and we're\ngoing to have this we're going to build\na media Empire like it wasn't like that\nit was just I love this and I actually\ndon't know what else to do with this\napart from try and share it I've always\nbelieved one thing right if I operate\nfrom a place of panic desperation just\nlooking around competition it won't work\nit doesn't work for me because it's not\ntrue it's not organic it's not real\nthere is no actual substance in that\nproduct it's Hollow it's fake and people\ncan see it and if and I really believe\nin I it's it sounds Airy fairy but I\nbelieve in it I know for a fact I have\nmade songs just chasing hits just like\noh that song work I went so far down\nthat road bro of trying to chase Big Pop\nhits I lost myself I lost I didn't even\neven when I was behind the mic singing\nit there was no smile on my face because\nI knew you were writing songs for this\nclimate and you got this guy talking in\nyour ear hm you need to do a song like\nthis because so and so had a number big\noh we'll get the produc so who did that\noh WR right with the songwriter who did\nthat I'm like but I don't even like that\nmusic yeah but that's all that's working\nright now so you got to do\nit and there was no love in it and guess\nwhat my fans could tell they could tell\nthey're not stupid they know this ain't\nJay Sean man what's he doing I see what\nhe's doing it's cool I love him so I let\nhim do it but this ain't Jay this ain't\nthe Jay that we loved this ain't the Jay\nthat we fell in love with I see what\nhe's doing there's a pressure for him to\ndo it that's cool well stand by him but\nwe'll wait for him to come back he'll\nfind his way back as I always do but\nwhen it's not from a place of love and\nit's not from a place of passion and\nit's not real I feel like there's a\nmetadata in that that people can feel\nand that's always been the story of my\nlife that's beautiful yeah no and and\nit's great to have that connection to\nyour audience but when you start\nobviously like you said I mean I I still\nremember when dance with you came out\nand we used to wait for it to be played\non Channel u m and I'm trying to think\nof where else but Channel U was my place\nI remember Channel and and the back in\nthe day this is again aent a you'd have\nto wait for the songs you love to come\non to record them on VHS so you'd record\nit and then you'd make your own VHS\nmusic video so then I'd have user you P\nDiddy Eminem like whatever else it is\nand you collecting all these people and\nthen now whenever your mates come over\nyou put this video in and then you\nplayed that or you're playing Channel\nyou in the background anyway right but\nit's like I remember when dance with you\ncame out and for anyone who doesn't know\nit if you if you didn't know Jay before\nthe US world like go back and see check\nthat video out because I still think\nit's a like it it lands even today\nthat's how good that song is thank you\nand and it's like and I can still bump\nin the car and it's it's awesome but to\nme it was such a moment for the culture\nbecause it was actually good music and\nit was actually cool too and I think\nthat that's hard to do as well I think\nit's really hard when you're like trying\nto do something something fresh and new\nand you're trying to own a sound or\ncreate a sound but to actually do that\nis really challenging so when you're at\nyour best most creative self as you were\njust describing now walk us through the\nmore texture of that recipe of like when\nyou're really Landing in that passion\nthat love the excitement as you said\nlike walk us through like when you're at\nyour Peak creativity when it's truly\nauthentic what does that creative\nprocess look like there's no thought and\nthat's what I always tell people making\nmusic is not a science there will be\npeople who tell you and listen fine some\npeople have had a very very long\nsuccessful career by methodically\nthinking hm verse must be x amount of\nsyllables and this melody works because\nthis chord structure worked for the last\n10 years top 10 hits this is the chord\nprogression and cool I'm not built that\nway that's not how I make music amazing\nhats off to the people who can write\nhits like that that's not how I make\nmusic I feel I feel\nand I smile and I jump up and down in\nthe studio when that song is done and if\nI'm feeling like that my the one thing\nthe rule I have is after I've written a\nsong If I am not so excited regardless\nof what time it is it could be 4 in the\nmorning I could have had a 20-hour day\nif I'm not excited enough to go behind\nthat mic bro and sing that song right\nthere that second it ain't it if I can\nsay ah I'll wait till tomorrow then that\nmeans my fans can go ah I'll wait till\ntomorrow to hear it you understand they\nhave options and the thing is I go off\nof that excitement so when dance with\nyou\nhappened I had met richy Rich who really\nyou know responsible\nfor the just everything from the\nbeginning of the Genesis of my career\nour our work together he heard something\nin me he knew I wrapped he knew I I I\nsang and what I had developed was a\nstyle of blending the two\nso I would fast rap and sing but sing it\nwith a Melody so because the rapper in\nme was so alive I didn't approach the\nbeat the way that I would say perhaps if\nI was just a singer so I actually wrote\nit as a rap so girl what have I told you\nbut think good of all the possible\nlyrical ways to come and approach you\nand so then I'd write those lyrics down\nbut then I put a Melody girl what have I\ntold you but think good of all the\npossible lyrical ways to come and\napproach you and it was something that I\ndon't think many people had heard before\nbut it was my style mhm and had there\nbeen like a suit in the room like an an\nanr he would have gone H you're way too\nfast I don't know what you're saying\nslow it down too many words this doesn't\nwork who does this have you seen give me\nan example of someone who's had success\nwith a song like this with a verse like\nthat that's exactly why you should do it\nthat's exactly why I did it is because\nit new because it was fresh and because\nit was it was me bro it's me you know so\nwhen that landed on that song I think a\nlot of the the Asian kids in England\ngrowing up if you're growing up in\nEngland you're listening to you know\nprobably R&B and hip-hop which is very\ncommon for us at the time that was a\nculture right that was kind of what we\nwere into and then your mom's watching\nsome Indian drama or some Indian shuk\nmovie so Bollywood so you got like\nbeautiful Hindi Melodies going on in the\nbackground and if you're Punjabi like me\nyou're going to weddings and they're\nplaying pan Punjabi music and it's\nupbeat those were all of my musical\ninfluences\nso when I was in that room it was not\nforeign or weird or even contrived for\nrishy and I to have first of all when\nrichy put that Indian\nFlute to me I wasn't like oh that's\nIndian I was like damn that's sick\nthat's a sick sample that sounds amazing\nover a hip-hop beat pop R&B chords it\nwas something brand new but it was\nsomething it was all the music that we\nlisten to mhh in one pot yeah yeah it\nwasn't like cont it wasn't like we're\ntrying to create a new genre we created\na new genre by accident yeah because it\nwas just the stuff that we were into so\nthen when we did that um had written\nthat song originally kind of left it\nthere rishy was working with jugy D um\nobviously a Punjabi artist he heard it\nhe was like this is sick jump on it bro\nyeah he did his thing before you knew it\nwe had a song that no one had ever heard\nand guess what the people the Asian\nculture at that time\nhad all of their favorite music on one\nsong You Had Punjabi you had hip-hop and\nyou had R&B and you had this whole thing\nin on in in three minutes of one song\nand for the first time ever I think by\nthree at that time young dudes cuz if\nyou were like listen to Punjabi music\nthey were like Uncle ages you know what\nI mean you're listening to like exactly\nand you're listening to like M Singh but\nhe's like 50 all of a sudden you got\nthese young girl girls and guys who are\nlistening to people who look like them\nyeah yeah doing their stuff and that\nkind of I think was something that was\nbrand new and it it just changed the\ngame man yeah no I I agree with that\neven when you see that in new artists\nlike I remember yeah the first time I\never heard a Drake song right right like\nearly mixtapes like you were like who is\nthis guy who can sing and rap and do his\nown thing now I know that today like you\nknow Drake's gone on to just do hit\nafter hit after hit and all the rest of\nit and I think sometimes he gets a hard\ntime where people are like oh yeah he\njust makes and I'm like well if you\nthink about it when he started he was\nprobably the only like real rapper that\nalso did that like was able to mix the\ntwo and I've always I've always loved\nhis music but to me as well it was that\nsame thing where it's like he was\nputting together two things that felt\nnatural to him in his own way like he\ncould sing really high notes and then\nput in like a a rap verse like hard on a\non a beat ex exactly it could do both\nand it was just exciting it was to me\nit's always been exting when people are\nnot kind of imprisoned and limited by a\nbox and it's what you're saying about\neven the entrepreneur and the musician\nin you and allowing yourself like I\nthink I think today we've become so much\nbetter at recognizing that people are\nmulti- henet like you know that Rihanna\ncan have a music career and be a fashion\nI gu right you know that an actress can\nalso have an amazing company you know\nthat exactly Ryan Reynolds can also sell\nan alcohol whatever it may be but you\nknow there's there's so many different\nways of doing that he can own a football\nteam like re him you know but in the\nbeginning it was like no you're an actor\njust just be an actor honor that do that\nand sometimes oh actually you do this\nrole you're only doing comedies and then\nan acting could be like dude yeah I know\nI'm good at comedy but like give me a\ndrama man at Le give me a shot show me\nlet me show those skills right yeah so\nso for me it was always like okay I'll\ndo music but like don't tell me I can\nonly do these records I can only sing\nthese kind of songs I can only you know\nsing I can't bust into a rap randomly so\nI was so that always confused me cuz I\nwas like hold on a second this is my\nartistic expression so surely it should\njust be why do why aren't I just allowed\nto do who I am because otherwise then\nit's not J sha it's j sha with other\npeople in his ear then it's not just\nDrake it's Drake with other people in\nhis ear so I think the reason why people\nfall in love with an artist is because\nthat person has something unique to\nshare with the world right you know like\nif you're in a certain mood you're going\nto be like man I don't know man I feel\nlike\nI put on some Adele right now or\nsomething why cuz you know what Adele\noffers you know what her music how it\nmakes you feel yeah yeah as opposed to\njust a random singer who's got a\nbeautiful voice yeah absolutely yeah no\nyou reminded me me of uh when Matthew\nmccon came on the podcast he talked\nabout how he was known as the romcom guy\nso he was doing How to Lose a Guy in 10\nDays he was doing all those types of\nmovies and he was amazing at it it was\nlike ghosts of girlfriend's past and\nlike he was that guy he was like the hot\nheart throb that you know that that\nholds those movies and he said he had to\ntake a two-year break from making movies\nto shift his brand to be able to do\nmovies like The Lincoln Lawyer later on\nDallas bias Club which you won the award\nfor and it's like he literally didn't\nmake movies for two years and he was\ngetting paid like 15 million to do a\nromcom right and he said for two years\nhe didn't do anything because that was\nhis brand and he wanted to do more\nserious roles he wanted to do roles that\nhe cared about and and it took him\nsaying no for two years and that's a lot\nof like you know it is it's it's it's\namazing to think that people who've made\npivots in their career have had to kind\nof have these very like interesting\ntransition periods yeah what was it like\nwhat's the biggest difference between\nthe UK and the US music scene because I\nthink you have that you know you have\nthat as a unique experience there's a\nfew of you right there's you and then\nlike more recently obviously people like\nEd Sheeran Adele like there's there's\nfew people who've been able to be\nsuccessful in both I'll tell you a funny\nthing right so obviously at the time pre\n2009 I was lucky enough to have guarded\nmyself a worldwide fan base excluding I\nthought excluding America I just thought\nthere's no way America knows my music\nand that's because America has let's be\nhonest they have the creme de la crem of\neverything if you think of any of the\nbiggest stars they're usually American\nwhether they're Hollywood stars you know\nnow they're all Canadian right now\nthey're all from specifically Toronto\nright\nso but at the time so when we in that's\nwhy when we were in London London is a\nsmall island and so what happens is\nsometimes you can get I I I refer to it\na small island syndrome you can walk\naround your little place and feel like\nthe the big shot you like yeah man man\nI'm a dagam bro people know me in here\nmate yeah I'm Lester bro people know me\nhere boy don't I a Scotland man people\nknow me in Scotland bro okay cool that's\namazing and great and if you can have a\ncareer then and you're happy with that\nthat's great I always again going back\nto me being a person who's highly driven\nI would always say take me somewhere\nwhere no one knows me I want to win them\nover take me somewhere take me anywhere\nwhere nobody knows me and let let me see\nif I can win them over and that has\nalways been something that's very dear\nto me even when it comes to shows any\nshow like you could do a corporate gig\nright and they have it it's like people\nbe like oh they W you for the show I\nokay cool what's the demographic this is\nXYZ I I don't then think okay I'm just\ngoing to sing XY Z song I go how can I\nconnect with them what what am I going\nto be able to on what level and then win\nthem over so that then they they can go\nyou know what I didn't actually know J\nbefore or even like his music but I like\nthe dude yeah I like the guy I connected\nwith him and he was fun on stage and he\nwas funny and he was endearing and then\nhe actually rocked the crowd and now all\nof a sudden you won him over yeah yeah\nyeah so when it came to America I took\nthat same approach I was I remember\ndistinctly being at passport control and\nI was going to go and sign with cash\nmoney that's why I was going over there\nand it was a big day for me and I was\nsuper excited I was like I can't believe\nthis man I'm about to get a deal in\nAmerica but I went\nknowing that if I don't\nsucceed at least I have everything else\nthat I've worked hard for and if I do\nsucceed man that's only a bonus now\nthat's can only be even better but I'm\nexcited I'm bit gassed up right so I'm\nthere of course little way it's like\nit's like oh my gosh yeah big deal Young\nMoney Cashman record it's like yeah\nright so then I'm there at passport\ncontrol and the guy goes you know how\nthey are in America sometimes they're\nlike what is the purpose of you visit oh\ngosh I still get it every time you get\nnervous is it I get so nervous man I'm\nat 7 many years and he's like what is\nthe purpose of your visit to the United\nStates I was like so here's me now Look\nslightly cocky I go be honest with you\nmay about to sign a big record deal and\nhe goes yeah he goes what's your name\nand I go Jon and he goes I haven't heard\nof you so now I know I got work to do\nright on my entry to this country\ncountry the good Lord has gone relax\nmate calm your ego there's work to be\ndone and it was through that one guy\nthat immigration officer who looked me\ndead in the eye and said so what I\nhaven't heard of you and I thought all\nright let's do this yeah let's work\nlet's work it's always the immigration\nofficers that don't recognize anyone man\nI get the same thing every time it's the\nbest but I love that and bro it it it\nhumbled me in a split second and I'm not\nsaying I had a big head either but if I\nwas to be cocky about my Venture in the\nUnited States I learn right there and\nthen bro prove yourself again and that's\nwhat I had to do from scratch yeah yeah\nand it's such a great mindset to have\nbecause you could have had that\ninteraction and gone where you should\nknow me right you you could do that or\nyou will know me yeah you will know get\ncocky right yeah you will know me and\nand it's just it's so interesting\nbecause I feel like that is just never a\nsatisfying way to live that's what I've\ndiscovered the the idea of thinking\nyou're at the top of the mountain or\nthat you're doing things it's the same\nthing as you said earlier like when\nyou're making music from love passion\nand and excitement I feel like if you're\ndoing something because of Revenge\nbecause of proving someone wrong because\nof I'll show you because I'll see you at\nthe top like when you do things with\nthat energy even if and when you make it\nit never fulfills you because that\nperson may not have the reaction you\nwant them to have you in the first place\nthat person would still be like yeah I\ndon't listen to your music or I don't\nlike your music or when you go up to\nthat guy and go oh wait did you hear me\nnow I'm number one billboard and they go\nyeah my girlfriend didn't like it\nexactly like yeah it still doesn't work\nit won't fill you bro and it's a very\nvery good point and I think\nthat it's it's such an important point\nbecause for me 20 years of work okay\nwhat have I learned what are my lessons\nI've been around the world we were\ncalculating this I'm I've coming up to a\nmillion miles just on one Airline wow\njust on one Airline wow so I've\ndefinitely done way more must have been\naround the world 50 times at least 50 in\nterms of mileage yeah easily that means\nI have had experiences after experience\nafter experience after experience after\nexperience some amazing some\nhorrible some that can make you feel\nlike you're on top of the world and some\nthat can pull you into a dark place and\nyou don't even want want to talk to\nanyone depressed\ncrying so where is that safe place\nwhere's the place where you're just okay\nman I'm all right with this I'm in this\nindustry and it can either make me or\nbreak me or it can do neither or I can\njust have a great time while I'm here\nmake people happy do that I love take\ncare of my family earn a good living and\nit all comes down to exactly what we\njust said why are you doing this if I\nwas for the rest of my career only\ndriven to write songs and perform and\nrecord to beat the big monster that is\ndown if that was my only incentive got\nto beat down got to beat down got to I\ngot to top that I am setting myself up\nfor failure a and definitely a ton of\nanxiety a ton of like bad feelings and\nand and feelings that just aren't on a\nVibe at all because I'm doing it all for\nthe wrong reasons\nM if I then go if I switch my mentality\nand go man how lucky were you how\nblessed were you to be able to have\nwritten that beautiful unicorn of a song\nthat makes so many people happy that\nreally did break a lot of records and\nchange your life gave you a life man\ngave you a life put that in your back\npocket yeah and be grateful and say\nthank you that was wicked that was\namazing now let's go on and write stuff\nthat you enjoy that you love that\nperhaps your fans might connect to and\nbut if I was to make the metric of my\nhappiness chart positions comments likes\nfollowers I'm setting myself up for\nfailure because I can't control any of\nthose things at\nall the only thing I can control is the\nmusic that I write the music that I\nrecord the music I put into this world\nthe way I interact with people when I'm\non stage and make them feel those are\nthe things I can contr control and so\ntherefore my happiness hopefully will be\nin a safe place you know because I'm not\npinning it I'm not rooting it in\nsomething that is so out of my control\nthere's this quote that I heard that\nsomeone said that you know at one point\nthey had to stop being a hit machine and\ngo back to being an artist and and I\nlove that idea but I feel every artist\ngoes through this series of phases where\nyou start as a pure artist you start\nwith pure Crea ity and pure passion and\nthen in the scaling of a business of\nhaving team members or whatever it is\nyou become a hit machine and you kind of\ntry and like you said you try and like\nmathematically figure out the equation\nyou may kind of have some hits you may\nnot have some hits but you have this and\neither way whether you've had hits or\nwhether you haven't you become\nunfulfilled and that's what happen so\nexternally even if this person is having\nall the number ones they're still\nfeeling internally fulfilled because it\ndoesn't link back to that pure Artistry\nthat they started why you started doing\nand then they try go back there everyone\ngoes back there everyone wants to go\nback there some people take 30 years\nsome people do it in three years I've\nmet people at both ends of the spectrum\nwho they made stuff they hated for 30\nyears some people gave up after three\nyears and said you know what I'm going\nback to doing what I love and it's\nnormal like it's normal for everyone to\nhave that so so true it's so wonderful\nto hear you talk about it in that way\nbecause I think\nthat we had Reg Ru been here a few\nmonths ago and he was saying the same\nthing he was just like you he he was\nsaying the same thing you said he was\nlike we're not music isn't made\nformulaically like he was like you're\nnot trying to think what people going to\nlove and so I'm going to make it and you\nknow to to hear that across artists and\nmusicians different genres different\nbackgrounds it it speaks to a lot when\nwas your darkest time or when was a\nmoment where you felt like you'd you\nwere just this is not yeah um it you\nknow it's so true everything you're\nsaying artists\nwe are we exist in one of two states we\neither you can't mess with me I'm best\nor I suck everyone hates me I'm the\nworst I should quit I can relate no in\nbetween the hardest place to be is I'm\nall right I'm an all I guess I'm an all\nright artist who who wants to be I'm an\nall right artist\nnobody how's it it's all right man got\ncops nobody wants\nthat so if you're not killing it you're\nhere you I suck I should quit nobody\nlikes me people aren't listening to my\nmusic they're listen to that person's\nmusic so of course I've had those\nmoments not only have I had them\nepically in one particular point in my\nlife my whole journey man has been like\nit's been like the rocky story which is\nwhy I'm so obsessed with Rocky and I\nlove Rocky love Rocky bro the slide dos\nout I haven't oh man I watched it it's\nI'm also obsessed with Sylvester dude\nthat dude he's he's so smart and I\nwatched the I watched it I'm not going\nto ruin it for you but one thing I've\nalways known for about Sylvester\nStallone is that this guy bet on himself\nthat's the story we know he bet on\nhimself didn't get cast in movies\nbecause of the way he looked the way he\nspoke so what did he do he wrote rols\nfor himself what an amazing what a\ngenius thing to do you're not going to\ncast me fine and he bet on himself with\nRocky but he didn't win immediately in\nRocky but what what that story tells me\nis here's a guy here's a guy a bum just\na dude that no one pays attention to but\nhe's he's still a human being he he\nsymbolizes your average Joe your average\nJoe who the world ain't really looking\nat they don't really stop to notice him\nbut he has a secret dream he has a\nLittle Dream inside of him you know what\nI mean and then when he gets that\nopportunity he goes for it cuz he's got\na nothing to lose but B he's all all\nheart he's all heart and he's doing it\nfrom a place of love he doesn't\nnecessarily need that belt he just loves\na the game and B I can't believe I got\nthis opportunity man I'm going take this\nI'm going take it with both my hands I'm\nnot going to let go but then the rocky\nSaga the storyline continues the rise\nand then the fall and that's why he's to\nme he's such a great writer is because I\nthink he was simultaneously writing\nabout what was going on in his life from\nnobody to becoming the biggest star in\nHollywood to then maybe getting caught\nup in the game losing your roots oh now\nI'm not even speaking the same way I\ndon't walk the same way talk the same\nway I don't write the same way cuz now\nI'm a star and people are looking at me\nexpecting different things and my career\nwas like that when I started off I just\nwrote From The Heart man I wrote cuz Jay\nrishy Rich and jugy de coming through on\na\nsong Who Says that why you calling your\nown names out on a song most songs are\njust like hey girl so you from the last\ntime it's an imaginary story about\nsomething now that you call it out yeah\nthis guy thinks it's okay on his first\never song to go it's part of the song\nit's not the intro part it's not like\nthe yo it's yeah it's not it's not that\npart it's it's the verse it's the verse\nwhy young Cockiness fresh fun not even\nthinking about it not studying other\nsongs going well what do what kind of\nlyrics do they write what are the big\nhits I did it and it connected and it\nfelt right and it worked first album I\nmean you you're familiar with me I\nremember buying me against myself on CD\nthere you go cuz I was so excited to\nlook at the art and I loved the idea cuz\non the last track you had to wait like a\nfew minutes and fast forward it to wait\nfor like bonus material I love those\nkind of like hidden things like yeah\nmassive yeah yeah and so me against\nmyself why was it even called me against\nmyself it was called me against myself\nbecause bro in all honesty truth be told\nfrom the beginning of my career I have\nbeen in this little bubble where I have\nbeen fighting myself the whole time the\nrapper versus the singer the R&B Guy\nversus the pop guy it's always been this\nduality of who is actually keeping it\nreal and who's the one making the money\nand you know up on the stages and are\nthey the same person cuz the guy who's\nkeeping it real was the rapper he was\nthe guy who was like yo you sold out\nyou're writing these fictional songs\nabout hey baby girl this baby girl that\nand on the song me against myself it's\nliterally the rapper verse of the\nsinger and the other part of this whole\nthing was it was me against everyone\nelse in the music industry because at\nthe time when I started I didn't really\nknow it know it and you know but now we\nlook back I was really out there by\nmyself myself as the only Asian kid in a\nsea of and we're talking like with the\nmainstream artist now and 20 years ago\neven more so 20 years ago and it was\nonly until I sort of really started\ncoming across situations where I\nrealized I am the the odd one out I am\nthe fish out of water here I'm the one\nthat doesn't look like anybody else it\nwas very\ndifferent and you know for me I felt\nlike at that point the only thing that\nwas going to get me through all of this\nwas by staying true to who I am right so\nthere's this you know song I wrote\ncalled good enough so what I would do is\nI would instead of screaming about it on\ninterviews and ranting on about it and\ncomplaining about how difficult it is\ntrying to break through and not having\nthe same opportunities as other artists\nI used to disguise my songs my love\nsongs I used to dis I used to write open\nletters to the music industry and\ndisguise them as love songs so there's a\nsong on my first album on me against\nmyself um called good enough and in the\nlyrics you think he's talking about a a\ngirl who's not the same races her so\nlike he's dating a girl from a different\nrace but it's actually a letter open\nletter to the music industry and it says\nit says I've got my mother's skin I've\nGot My Father's Eyes that's something\nthat I can't deny and that's nothing\nthat I want to hide and even though my\nroots come from the other side they told\nme that they won't mind cuz I heard that\nlove is blind and then it says how do I\nchange a million Minds in this lifetime\nwhat is it I have to do if I erase my\nhistory what defines me if I had to\nchange my truth would I be good enough\nfor\nyou and really it was about me talking\nto the music industry yeah yeah saying\nlike I'm just like you why are you\ngiving me a hard of time man listen to\nmy music tell me if it fits in where it\nshould fit in so when all that stuff\nstarted to happen I went in a bit of a\nit was hard for me I went in like a\nlittle bit of a a dark place CU I was\nlike this ain't this is meant to be fun\nthis is meant to be my dream and and now\nlike I'm not getting the same\nopportunities and and I didn't know what\nto do about that you know when my first\nalbum when they tried to take me onto\nthe second album at virgin I realized\nthat these people don't understand me\nthey don't understand my vision my art\nI'm going go step out so any money that\nI had earned of that first album and\ntouring I invested in myself like like\nSylvester Stallone yeah and that's where\nI did the My Own Way album of course why\nit's called My Own Way on that\nalbum I remember leaving virgin and at\nthe time being told don't worry you're\ngoing to get another record deal you\nknow you've got all the success you got\nthese chart hits of course you're going\nto get signed immediately I was like\nyeah okay good I'll get signed to a\nlabel that understands me didn't happen\ndidn't happen and now I'm like well I\nhad like four years in the game and\nthat's it maybe I should have stayed\nwith Virgin who who else gets a major\nrecord deal and then walks away from\nit and then I have to talk to my parents\ntell them the situation I've just given\nup a chance at being a doctor I've had\none album out toward the world a little\nbit didn't really smash it though did I\nlike for the Indians around the world\nyes I smashed it of course there were\nlike first guy our guy but in terms of\nmainstream they were kind of like oh\nyeah that guy had a couple of songs\nso I remember being lost really lost and\nuh I pretended actually to my parents\nthat I was off to the studio working on\na new album and there were times where I\nwould get in my car I just drive around\nPark up somewhere and literally sit down\nin my car and go cry and on your own on\nmy own and just cry because I was so\nlost and so scared here's a guy who had\nall the Big Dreams in the world a guy\nwho worked so hard at school two degrees\nI had to just really just sit there and\nthink about there has to be a reason\nthere has to be a reason that this gift\nwas given to me that this blessing was\ngiven to me to be able to try to fly the\nflag for us what do I do I can't just\nend here amazingly as the universe would\nhave it about two weeks later there was\nthis event where I was in doing like a\nmeet and greet and this kid comes up to\nme and uh he's about 16 17 at the time\nhands me a CD and he goes hey man I'm\nsuch a big fan I make music please\nlisten to it if you can my contact\ndetails are on there I said yeah cool\nman now look when this happens as you\nknow like sometimes we're like yeah bro\ncool but sometimes you get 100 CDs you\ndon't get to listen to them all on the\nway home put it in the car listening to\n[Music]\nit I'm like like this beat is\ninsane and I was like holy I'm calling\nthis guy straight away I picked him up\npicked up the phone I was like where do\nyou live where's your studio he's like\nJon I was like yeah he's like bro come\non I was like no I'm coming over now to\nyour studio and he had a studio in his\ngarden shed in\nslow he had a studio in his garden shed\nin slow and this is a fan of mine and I\nsaid\nwe're going to work he's like dude come\non I was like I'm serious and it was\njust me and him and on that day I wrote\nwrite it with this kid who had just\ngiven me a demo CD that's amazing he had\na dream he had a lofty dream he didn't\nknow that I was also in a place in my\nlife where I needed I needed something\nhe needed something and I needed\nsomething we both wanted a win and that\nsong was just sent bro and it changed\neverything that song obviously his as\nyou know I mean I was about to say on\nTik Tok that that song has had so many\nlives and so many edits and so many like\nit's insane it's crazy yeah but I and\nwithout have getting too heavy on the\nspiritual about it I think it's\nbecause there is something special about\nthat song I think it's because that song\nIts very Genesis came from a place of\nwhere I was at my lowest and needed so\nbadly to be plucked out of this dark\nplace and I needed something from up\nhere man I needed something to lift me\nup and that song Not only just did that\nfor me it's kind of like a sacred song\nfor me you know and it gave this kid Al\nlife it gave him an entire\ncareer one\nsong and\nthen fast forward 12 years later it goes\nand gives another guy a life some random\ndude in Lithuania who's just like done a\nremix and put it on YouTube and then it\ngoes on Tik Tok this guy is now touring\nthe world\ndo you know what I mean and it also like\nyou know did pretty good for me during\npandemic a little nice little pocket\nchange for me too and it was like you\nknow it's special so there you go there\nwas my Rocky story right then boom down\nhere in the dumps back up now rit's out\nJ sea version two's out shaved head\nright the spikes are gone the shaved\nhead and all of a sudden man I got\nanother shot at it the reason why I love\nhearing it is because I remember like I\nremember\ntrying to figure out what had happened\nbetween the two albums too and I\nremember like as as your fans were\nfollowing it was like I can't remember\nit was like was it Relentless or\nReckless I can't Relentless Relentless\nright it was relentless and it was like\nyeah you were seeing that shift and you\nnever know what's going on on the other\nside the best part about that story\nthough is the randomness and allowing\nthe randomness because I think so often\nas you become more successful you become\nmore closed you become more are you're\njust a little kid what do you have and\nthat ego we we talked about ego a few\ntimes in this conversation it just shows\nme again and again and again the thing\nthat gets in all of our ways is our ego\nego stops you from being creative\nbecause you're scared of what your\nfriends will think that's ego ego stops\nyou when you start thinking you're the\nman getting into America and if you\nwould have acted in that way back at\nthat guy but you you were like no no no\nI'm going to get better I need more I\nneed to get more people to know my work\nand then ego again could have stopped\nyou from going he's a little kid at what\ndoes he know I'm Jan like he's just\neveryone gives me CDs and it's so\ninteresting just how we have to work\nagainst our ego constantly and Me\nAgainst myself in and of itself is\nactually us against our ego on a daily\nbasis that's the real battle the real\nbattle is us against our ego it really\nis it's it's so true man I I think I\nthink all of that ties in also bro to\njust keeping not just keeping your eyes\nopen right but keeping your mind open\nand the thing is I always look at it\nlike this man um uh self-awareness is\nobviously something that you of course\ntalk about a lot and some people go\ntheir whole life man not being self\naware okay their whole life I think very\nfortunately for myself I I got it quite\nearly on once I started this career I\nkind of understood again just like\nstanding out as the only Brown dude I\nwas very self-aware understood also\nunderstanding that when I came across\nthose problems and those obstacles I\nrealized very quickly that my sense of\nhumor was able to get me out of them\nrather than letting it destroy me so\nrather than letting me go when someone\nsays something dumb or something stupid\nor insensitive or culturally\ninappropriate instead of getting mad and\ncausing an argument I would use wit and\nintelligence to be able to get myself\nout of it then I realize what kind of\nperson I was in this industry that I'm\nin and this industry you know as you\nknow it can be it can be very very fake\nit can be very it's hard to find\nconnections with certain people\nbut if you know who you are in that\nspace I think you're going to just\nyou'll be okay through the highs and\nthrough the lows do you know what I mean\nyeah yeah um but yeah I love what I love\nthat you recognize that because it's\nit's very true if I wasn't open to the\nrandomness and I wasn't open to the\nsigns you just miss out and I think\nabout that right like I think we all\nhave to reflect on our own life and go\nwhere do we miss out on that Randomness\nbecause we've started to think that\nthings have to formulaic or equations or\nperfectly fitting or coming from the\nright Source like sometimes right like\nwe we always think oh yeah that business\nperson will tell me the right thing or\nthat individual and it's like well no\nthere could be some random person in\nyour family or your friends group who\nsays one thing to you that actually\nshoots you off in an amazing Direction\nthere was I I'm gonna give a shout me\nand Jeremy had a call like this recently\nso Jeremy said to me he goes to me\nhe said to me we I just called I called\nhim randomly I was on a drive and I\nhadn't caught up with him while for a\nwhile so I called up Jeremy and we start\nhaving this phone call and I Had No\nAgenda there was no plan it was just\ncatching up with your mate and he said\nto me randomly goes Jay I can't wait\ntill you start a school and I was like\ndude what are you talking about that's a\nvery Jeremy thing yeah exact like huge\ndream and I was like first of all Jeremy\nI don't have kids so I don't even know\nwhat school feels like for kids second\nof all I feel really unal ifed to start\na school I think it's actually very uh\nthere needs to be a lot of research\nthere needs to be a lot of understanding\nlike dealing with kids mind should be\ndealt with extremely uh delicately and\nthoughtfully I don't think everyone\nshould start schools thirdly like sure\nit's a nice idea but like it's so like I\nI wouldn't I've never even thought of\nthat as even a concept in my life but I\nanswered all of that and then\nimmediately something came to my mind\nI'd love to go and study the best\nschools on the planet and I was like I\nwould love to actually go and understand\nnot because I want to start a school but\nbecause I would love to understand the\nhuman mind and what we're messing up\nthat's creating kids who cause issues in\nthe world versus kids that get it right\nnow there's lots of studies and research\nbut I would actually love to go and sit\nwith parents and teachers and I came\nback to my team the next day I was like\nguys I have to go and do this and we\nhave to document it and we have to\nbecause not because I think there's\ncontent in it not because I don't even\nknow what I do with it I just know that\nI would be fascinated yeah if over the\nnext five years I could understand more\ndeeply how to build more compassionate\nchildren not because I want to start a\nschool not because I think that thought\nwasn't even in your head until this\nrandom conversation this random\nconversation that my mate just said I\ncould be like what does Jeremy know like\nI got a Content you know I got stuff\ngoing on like you know he's nice he\nthinks he wants me to start a school but\nlike that's but really it spark like\ngenuinely I can't tell you how much that\nidea has like captivated me because I'm\nlike yeah you know I'd love to know mhm\nhow we build\ncompassionate empowered confident\nchildren who change the world I would\nlove to understand that on a very deep\nintimate and personal level and so I\nstarted researching like where are the\nbest schools in the world like what are\nthe schools that make the most creative\nkids what are the school that make the\nmost this kids so I'm like I got to go\nto the school in Spain I got to go to\nthis school and I was like amazing\ntravel now feels alive again it's not\nlike I go jump on a plane to do some\nwork it's like it's and it's for a\npurpose and it's fun it's something fun\nand I think really what what you're on\nto there bro is is it's very easy to\nlike sort of become complacent as well\nlike you go this is what I do H great\nStudio at this time I write a song great\nblah blah blah when do you find out if\nwe've got if we're lucky enough to have\nanother 40 50 years on this earth right\nwhat's going to light us up that whole\njourney what's and I think about that\nconstantly if I've already done this\nmuch I've been lucky enough blessed\nenough to have 20 years in the music\nindustry what am I going to do for the\nrest of my life what's going to light me\nup what I just going to retire I just\ngoing to sit there and lovely got my\nkids got my family and my wife that's\nlovely it's beautiful but I'm not like\nthat I'm I I need something to fire me\nup yeah you know what I mean which is\nlike I said why I did this thing all\nthese different companies that that I've\ncreated but the biggest thing now that\nreally lights me up Jay is seeing what's\nhappening with this new generation of of\nAsian artists I was about to ask you\nabout it really is it's crazy man\nI I am as you probably know haven't done\nan album for a long time okay a lot of\npeople man when are you going to do\nanother album and you know what my\nanswer always was there's what I said\nhonestly is what I used to say nobody\ncares about an album anymore they just\nwant music content if you let's say your\nfavorite artist let's just say Drake for\nexample let's just say you're waiting\nfor a Drake album and he's like all\nright guys I'm going to be back in 3\nyears I'm going to just work really hard\non this in this day and age that we're\nin with our attention spans ain't no one\nwaiting 3 Years bro no one's which is\nwhy he could churn one out a year\nclearly but that's Drake yeah um but\npeople don't want to wait around so I\nused to just said I said forget album\nthat model is old it's an old notion\nI'll just keep giving you music I'll\njust keep putting putting it up it's on\nmy Spotify it's on my Apple music and I\ndid that consistently for\nyears and through doing that I sort of\nlike you know just spend a lot of time\non the street platforms I started\ndiscovering all this music which to me\nwas reminiscent of what me rishy and\njugy were doing 20 years ago so all of a\nsudden you had these kids from India\nsinging in Punjabi but they're singing\nover like a drill beat mhm and there's\nlike an English vocal on there from some\nrandom artist and I was like this Fusion\nstuff is happening again except this\ntime it's happening with these\n20-year-old kids who at living in India\nwho have basically grown up with access\nto the internet from the moment they're\nborn they got this device so yeah of\ncourse they're listening to Bollywood\nand they're listening to all this stuff\nbut they're also listening to Travis\nScott and they're listening to you know\nRihanna whatever it is so that was US 20\nyears ago and I when I tell you\nsomething happened inside me it just\nstarted bubbling I was like I need to\nget in front of these kids I need to\nsoak up their energy it's that youthful\nenergy that excitement cuz they're not\njaded yeah they're not they haven't even\nstepped into the industry yet they're\njust kids having fun that's who I was 20\nyears ago and it lit me up and I said to\nJeremy and of course it was the best\nnews he ever heard I was like Jeremy\nthat's it decided man he was like y\nyou're what an album I was like yep and\nwe're going to India that's where we're\ndoing it he's like great I've never\nnever been to India I was like oh this\nis going to be fun for you bro so we did\nwe went to India this year and I\nrecorded 34s of my album\nin India With These Guys these immensely\ntalented kids whose faces were just lit\nup from music there was no Journey they\nhadn't even been on a journey yet there\nwere no obstacles there was no problems\nthere were no highs and lows it was just\nlove for music and this album for me now\nI'm so excited about it because again it\ncame from a place of joy and excitement\nyou know what I mean yeah yeah yeah and\nit's so so interesting how like even\nthat with the going back to your Rocky\nstory\nexample there's Rocky five where he\ntrains Tommy Gun yeah and it's like that\nwhole feeling of he gets his enthusiasm\nback because he's back in there he's\nwith a young guy who reminds him of\nhimself and like again there's such a\nneed for us to always go and be with the\nbeginner again and go to the source\nagain and we miss out on that in life\nbecause the higher you get again less\nRandomness means you spend time with the\nsame people you're not spending time\nwith the person who's at the Grassroots\nwho's who's got their finger on the\npulse and all of a sudden again you're\ndisconnected yeah you're disconnected\nyeah completely disconnected and that's\nso right man I I felt myself going I\nfelt like through through my journey and\nthrough 20 years you know what's really\ninteresting is that it's very easy to AE\nyourself out the game right it is and\nand you know I think it's funny I don't\nknow if you've ever if any of the other\nartists who you've had on your podcast\nhave ever talked about this um agism is\na funny thing in the music IND I think\nwe have yeah I don't think we have in\nthe music industry is weird right like\nif you're an actor it's brilliant you\njust get to play older roles yeah and\nsometimes they've become even better CU\nthey've been acting for so many years\nand now right well now I feel like most\nlike the main actors like in movies are\n50 years old like that's like the\nstandard age if you actually check their\nages yeah it's really interesting so in\na way the more time you spend there the\nmore years you put into that craft will\nactually pay off I mean let's say if I\nwas a doctor right now I'd be probably\nbe a consultant within a few years the\nmore years you put in you step up the\nladder and whereas music it's like the\nmore years you put in it's like you're\nending you're going closer towards the\nfinish line and they're like come on\nmate enough now get off stage no one\nwants to see a 50-year-old dancing\naround right and it's a very weird thing\nif again if I didn't have my a sense of\nhumor about that I could be like who are\nyou to tell me when to stop working who\nare you to tell me I'm too old to be on\nthat stage who are you to tell me that I\nhave not done anything great since that\nsong or this song but I do understand I\ndo understand it's kind of awkward and\ncringeworthy at some point if you see\nsome people who aren't self-aware enough\nto understand that bro maybe you\nshouldn't be dancing right now go and\nsit on a\nstool make the song\nacoustic and let's just get that\naudience yeah yeah yeah being able to\nlet go of a former identity that worked\nyeah that's right that's so interesting\nand the thing is quite often we're\nFrozen in time yeah I'm frozen in time\non those plaques in my house and in\nJeremy's house there's a baby face J sha\nand I look at him and I see that young\nboy and I see what he's achieved and I'm\nproud of him but I'm also very aware\nthat maybe I don't want to keep doing\nthis 10 years down the line who knows I\nmean truth told I'm sure Snoop and all\nthese guys said that they wouldn't be\nrapping I I feel like your favorite\nartist redoing songs that are either\nnostalgic like I think Nostalgia is such\na big part of music right like you\nlisten to music to feel that way again\nlike for me with Asha too I don't think\nasha's made a load of new music recently\nbut it's like to me when he did you\nremind me obviously and there was this\nscene in the You Remind Me video where\nthe song shuts off but he's on that\nsilhouette of that you know which\nthe in the backr and he did that on\nstage and for me I was just like that's\nall I want to see because to me it's\nlike that is exactly where I was at 16 I\nremember trying to do the moves and\nfailing ex and and and I still failed at\nthe same why do you think I don't dance\nyeah yeah but it but it that's the thing\nand it's like if Eminem picks up a mic\never I will be there I will just sit and\nwatch I mean I mean watching Beckham and\nhis documentary take free kicks i'\nhappily watch David beckam play football\nany day of the week because there's\nthere's a feeling there that you get\nbecause Nostalgia is built that way\nNostalgia will never change like if you\nhad a positive experience watching Rocky\nI can still watch Rocky cuz me and my\ndad used to watch Rocky together so it\nwill never Rocky will never ever be old\nor boring for me because you know I've\nwatched Rocky a million times bro say I\nknow every word of all of them even\nRocky 5 even though they say it's the\nbad one I still love it Rocky it right\nbut bro you you bring up such a good\npoint it's such a true Point yeah which\nis why I mean if you go to Vegas why why\nall of the biggest acts are Nostalgia\nacts but they put you in a place where\nyou just feel they transport you back in\ntime what can ever transport you back in\ntime as as well as music does totally\nnothing you know where you were what you\nwere wearing what girl you were dating\nyou know all of that stuff you know when\nyou listen to a song you know where you\nand it's it's a beautiful thing but it's\nreally funny you reminded me of of uh\nsomething when you said about the the\nrocky thing right and you were saying\nagain just to go to go back to that the\nother day when I was watching a docu you\nknow his documentary then I'm not it's\nnot going to spoil anything for you\nthere's some of the scenes are in his\nhouse in La you've probably been to his\nhouse I haven't I haven't I've only met\nhim once and he was amazing dude I yeah\nI've only met him once and he was\namazing but he wasn't at his house I\nhope I'm so glad he lived up to what you\nwanted him to be he was awesome yeah but\nhere's a guy who's been acting for what\n50 years now 50 50 years in the game and\nwhat was his biggest breakthrough hereit\nrocky rocky one\nbiggest breakthrough hereit but then 50\nyears of more films now if Sylvester\nStallone was walking down Sunset\nBoulevard and me and my mates or whoever\nwas there and they saw him oh my God or\njust any person sees him what do you\nthink he hears every day of his life yo\nAdrian yo Rocky right that's what we do\nnow he could take that in one of two\nways couldn't he he could either go shut\nup I've done like a 100 films why keep\ngoing back to Rocky or he could go yo\nyeah I get it cuz I love Rocky too yeah\nand Rocky for me changed my life and I\nknow you guys love Rocky totally and he\ntook Rocky his baby that changed his\nwhole life and instead of rejecting it\nand going you remind me of the fact that\nmaybe I've never topped you instead of\ndoing that he's like come here I'll put\na massive statue of myself as Rocky in\nmy swimming pool in my house and I will\nall the rocky memorabilia around my and\nI will embrace you and I will be\ngrateful for you and that I really love\nthat because I think the problem as\nartists is that sometimes we want to\nwhen we do a show right people are\nwaiting man you go see Michael Jackson\nit's Michael Jackson he has some of the\nbiggest best songs on planet Earth one\nof the biggest pop stars that ever lived\nwhat are people waiting\nfor and you want to see him do his dance\nand moonwalk yeah and he's probably like\nI'm Michael Jackson and that's what\nyou're waiting for Billy Jan oh great\nyeah of course they are cuz that's why\nthey fell in love with him and that's\nwhy they fell in love with Rocky and\nthey're the people who for me in America\nman they fell in love with down so when\nI do my shows and stuff like that\nwhatever it is even if I've got new\nsongs I'm not turning my concert into me\nI'm not turning it into hey guys I know\nthat you loads of song songs that you\nguys want to hear but I'm actually going\nto spend the next 45 minutes singing my\nbrand new album I'm not doing it they\ndon't care cuz they don't know it the\nshow's for them yeah right it's such a\ngood point and I love this idea of you\nknow every we all and whether it's age\nwhether it's time whether it's changes\nin life there is a part of your identity\nwhere you have to shed you have to let\ngo like everyone has to do that and\nwhat's amazing is I actually saw what\nyou just said you don't do happened\nrecently I won't Name the artist I'll\ntell you afterwards I'll tell you\nafterwards right so comes on stage and\nwe're waiting for this song Right\nwaiting and he's he's the he's the first\nactor before the main stage but it's\nstill an artist that I love and I'm\nwaiting for the song The Beat comes on\nand we're all there and yes like me and\nRy and our friends that we went we\nreally excited and then 10 seconds into\nthe track they cut the beat and he goes\nyou think I'm going to do that here he\ngoes you think I'm going to give you\nthat whole song he goes I got 30 years\nof songs to give you and then he goes\nplays all these songs that we didn't\nrecognize and he actually did that and\nit was like I was like you just took\naway my moment bro like I wanted you to\ndo that song not because I'm limiting\nyou not because I think you have no\nother hits you you you actually are\nreally talented but that song is so\nspecial and iconic that I need to hear\nit you need to hear it and and I felt\nlike 10 seconds of it was all he gave us\nand then and then he never went back to\nit and I thought oh maybe he gave it 10\nseconds he'll go back set finish didn't\nget it you know and and that's exactly\nthat feeling of like it's our own stuff\nbut you're saying we're dealing with\nthat we're all dealing with that we all\nhave a trapped identity somewhere all of\nus have what you're saying somewhere and\nsomehow we're actually mad at it and\nwe're annoyed by it rather than\nwelcoming and embracing it and I think\nabout that it's been 10 years since I\nleft the monastery I'm a very different\nexternally a very different person today\nI'm married I have businesses we have\nyou know media we change where we live\nlike so many things but in my heart I'm\nthe same person I'm a very I'm Different\nexter my life is different things of\ncourse I've changed people change\nthere's parts of me that have changed\nbut I embrace that experience it's a\nmassive part of me but I found that\nwhether you Embrace or reject people\nalways have an issue with it because it\ndoesn't make sense to them if it doesn't\nfit into their version of how they\nperceive you it's complicated and I\nthink for me I've I've learned to accept\nthat I need to give myself permission to\nbe who I am today to be who I was 10\nyears ago and who I will be 10 years\nfrom now and I promise you it won't be\nthe same and I need to give myself\npermission to allow that and I think we\nwhen you see like you said when you see\nSylvester spow and give himself\npermission I was with we had Arnold\nschwarzer on the podcast with he's the\nsame he has he has the original\nTerminator outfit in his place he has\nalien he has like he has everything and\nhe loves it like he really loves it and\nI love him for it because I'm like yeah\nbro you do of course like crushed it and\nyou're not trying he's not trying to be\nthe Terminator anymore he's not trying\nto be but he loves it he loves doing we\nwhen my social media manager asked him a\nquestion on the way out and they said do\nyou have any last words and he like I'll\nbe back you know like and I'm like he\nloves it and I love and I love it and\nand I love what they want yeah and I\nlove him for it and he's not he's not\ndisingenuous he's not inauthentic he's\nnot stuck in the past he's a really he\nwas great to chat to and so yeah man all\nthese people were talking about but Jay\nI can talk to for hours we can literally\nI think we have been yeah we have been u\ni could genuinely talk to you f and I\nlove this and I think we've what I love\nabout this conversation genuine is I\nfeel like we've drawn like you you\npulled out Rocky and I think because we\nhave that we we've drawn this really\nnice Arc and narrative for people and I\nhope everyone who's listening and\nwatching this I really hope that you\nfind your own Rocky Journey like\ngenuinely in your own way as you've seen\nmirrored in your life that you've shared\nso wonderfully today but Jay we end\nevery episode with the final five or the\nFast Five Jay Shan and these are your\npast five the first question is what is\nthe best advice you've ever heard or\nreceived um spend so much time on\nself-improvement that you have no time\nto criticize others love it that is\ngreat advice and no one's ever said it\non the show uh second question what is\nthe worst advice you've ever heard or\nreceived it sounds so stupid but it's\nlike when you get the big money um\nnobody told me how to spend it or invest\nit so great point right and nobody told\nme any about that go buy some houses\ninstead of like you know wasting on\nstuff like that so I wish I actually got\nsome some advice on on that how to\nmanage money yeah that's good that's\ngood I hope that I hope all the yeah I\nhope everyone who's coming into new\nmoney is hearing that uh question number\nthree what has been the gift of\nparenting that you didn't expect cuz I\nknow you're a great dad and that is no\nlonger the world is no longer about me\nmy job is no longer about me my life is\nno longer about me it's all about it's\nall for my kids all of this now is for\nmy kids and it's the most beautiful\nthing is there's nothing more grounding\nthan you know than when you can be a pop\nstar and famous around the world but you\ncome home and you're just daddy it\nreally is the cutest yeah uh question\nnumber four what is the thing that\nsurprised you most about the music\nindustry in 20 years uh how much how\nmuch of a change technology would have\non it it's literally flipped it on its\nhead it is a totally different animal\nthere's 120,000 new songs that come out\nevery day now every day every day\n120,000 new songs come out so you\nimagine trying to put get yours is just\na needle in a hay stack and so many\npeople can be independent you could do\nwhatever you want don't need that big\nrecord deal anymore although I do have a\nrecord company that I've started for\nSouth Asian talent that that's my way of\ngiving back I'm so excited about that by\nthe way and that's what I want to use\nall of my 20 years for bro all of my\nexperience is to now pass it on to the\nnext Generation so I have experienced it\nI know all about it now so now it's my\nturn to be able to help other people\nthrough it I love that you're doing that\nas well because I think there's there's\nsuch a need for that support I I was\nprobably the two you know I was the guy\nwatching jump off but too scared to go\non right well that's it bro I know you\nlove rapping I might have to sign\nyou no I think the age I'm like but but\nno the idea of like there's just I think\nthere's an I'm so happy that you're\ndoing that honestly when I heard about\nthat that was amazing and I'm so sad I\ncouldn't come to the event I was on a\nplane I was I was out of town uh Fifth\nand final question if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow what would it be the obvious\nthing for me to think that that the\nworld is missing right now is\nkindness so what if there was a law that\nevery person that you meet you had to do\na kind act what if there was a law that\nyou had to do one random act of kindness\na day and I think that could go on to to\nto make the world a better place yeah\nthat would be beautiful I think so I\nlove it even if you didn't want to do it\nif it was a law and you knew you had to\ndo a random act of kindness for somebody\nthat could have a knock on effect yeah\ncuz it would make you do it even end of\nthe day like you have figure it out I\nlove it Jay Sean everyone I'm so\ngrateful Jay thank you so much for\ncoming on thank you brother thank you\nfor having me yeah no this was so much\nfun and you're I knew it would be
