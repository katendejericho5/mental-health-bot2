co-founder\nand co-executive chairman of calm the\nleading mental Wellness brand with the\nnumber one app for sleep meditation and\nrelaxation K has grown to over 150\nmillion downloads and was Apple's 2017\napp of the year and is the world's first\nmental health unicorn Michael is\nfascinated by Neuroscience flow States\nand mental Fitness and is passionate\nabout spreading meditation as a simple\nbut valuable skill around the world\nplease welcome to the show my friend and\nincredible human Michael Acton Smith\nMichael thank you so much for being here\nso happy to be here thank you Jay I know\nI can't believe it's taking this long\nand we were both remembering I I think\nit was probably like seven years ago six\nseven years ago where you had a lot of\nyour friends and people in your\ncommunity saying you had to meet me and\nI had everyone in my community saying I\nhad to meet you and then we had a lunch\nat my first apartment in LA in 2018 and\nwe were just talking about that and it's\nso wonderful that I feel so grateful to\nbe the chief purpose officer at Comm and\nthat came from the relationship we built\nup and I always say that to people when\npeople see Partnerships like this I\nalways say to people it actually came\nfrom just a partnership and a friendship\nbehind the scenes with one person and\nit's evolved into this incredible thing\nI love the calm family and I'm so\ngrateful to be a part of it oh well the\nfeeling is very mutual you know I think\nbuilding a partnership that has\nfoundations in friendship and years of\ngetting to know each other I think makes\nit much much stronger so your impact at\ncalm has been phenomenal the daily Jay\nis uh is just brilliant I would honestly\nsay it's the content I'm most proud of\nthat I create because the team that I\nwork with in order to curate and\nresearch and build what we do we have so\nmuch fun I want to give big shout out to\nBen big shout out to Chris like we have\njust you've developed such a phenomenal\nteam who's so conscious and thoughtful\nand Innovative and creative and not not\nscared to push the boundaries too and\nit's an amazing balance to have that\nwhere so thoughtful yet so Innovative\nand I think that that's it's been\namazing I was just talking about last\nyear I went to the calm Retreat I didn't\nI didn't I missed this years but I went\nlast year and what I was really moved by\nis everyone who's part of your team has\na calm story so for everyone who doesn't\nknow what I'm talking about I was doing\na Q&A with David the CEO on stage and we\nwere doing this Q&A and people would\nstand up and ask me questions but they\nwould share their calm story and\neveryone who worked there had this\nreally emotional really powerful\npersonal story of how Karm has helped\ntheir family or their friends or them\nand I was nearly in tears like a couple\nof times because some of those stories\nwere really emotional it's so meaningful\nto be in a company where as you say\neveryone has a story a reason a purpose\nfor being there it's so much more than a\na 9-to-5 job and you can feel that and\nand obviously you felt that when you\ncame and when you're surrounded by\nhundreds of the calm team it's very very\nspecial you were such a big hit you know\na year on people still talk about it you\nwere doing selfies and chatting long\nlong into the night meeting every single\nperson and and listening to those\nstories so thank you for that no of\ncourse and Michael I want to dive in now\nwith you because you know what I think\nwhat you've done for the world through\nComm is truly remarkable like I think\nit's it's historic it truly is you know\nI think it's really interesting because\ntoday technology has become the way to\nserve humanity and therefore we don't\noften think about cultural shifts in the\nsame way because they're through\ntechnology almost feels a bit robotic or\na bit more kind of organized and so we\ndon't realize just how powerful these\nthings are because we see numbers but we\ndon't see the Deep transformation but\nKarm is helped and transformed so many\npeople's lives when you set out to\npopularize meditation did you ever\nimagine that it would have the impact it\nhas today no no it's it's been an\nextraordinary Journey Alex Chu and I set\nthe company up a little over a decade\nago and we were living in SoHo um you\nknow Soho London love obviously it's not\nthe most calm place in the world it's\nfull of all the best restaurants and\nbars incredible energy and and passion\nand um we lived in a house and we'd play\nvideo games at at night talking about\nbusiness and ideas and I remember Alex\nsaying to me he'd heard about this\ndomain name that was available calm.com\nand we pressed pause and I was like Wow\nsay that again calm.com and I got\ngoosebumps and just thought what an\nincredible word what an incredible brand\nwe could potentially build we felt that\nthe world could have been CU we lived in\nSoHo but we felt the world needed more\nCal and it was just getting more anxious\nmore stress and so that was the the\nstarting point and as I say it's been a\nuh one extraordinary Journey how was\nthat available well it wasn't available\nat GoDaddy for $10 sadly um it was owned\nby a chap in Sheffield in England and it\nwas offered to us for about a million\npound I think and both of us were like\nno that's a ludicrous amount of money uh\nwe could never afford that and about a\nyear later he came back to us and we\nwere able to get it for a much lower\namount still quite expensive I was going\nto use the money to put a deposit down\non a house and uh we decided to buy a\ndomain name with it instead which my\nparents thought was a rather strange\nmove but we just thought there was magic\nin in that word and uh we felt Alex had\nbeen meditating for for many many years\nhe was um teenager who is very\ninterested in um Consciousness and\nmeditation and breath work and so he was\na little more into this than I was and\nhe brought me along but I felt that we\ncould build almost like the the Nike of\nthe mind could we take mental health\ncould we take meditation and mindfulness\nand simplify it make it more accessible\nsprinkle in a little bit of magic and\nand joy and bring it to to billions of\npeople because these practices have been\naround for thousands of years pretty\nmuch every culture and religion has\nsomething similar but it wasn't clicking\nit wasn't resonating with society and\nthere was so much unnecessary suffering\nthere was so many issues and and we felt\nthis could be a very very powerful area\nto explore so that was the The Little\nAcorn that K blossomed into yeah have\nyou meditated today Michael did you\nmeditate this morning today I I take\nsome days I I'm not able to to do the\ndaily calm for 10 minutes and instead I\ntake three mindful breaths before I\nleave the the door so um that was what I\ndid this morning yeah that's beautiful\nno and it's I think that's what's really\ninteresting about the way calms approach\nmeditation and I saw this obviously from\nan outside point of view until we We\njoin forces but when I was observing\nwhat calm was doing I was really really\nadmiring it because I felt it took such\na broad-minded view to meditation which\nI actually think meditation is as a\npractice so even though you're saying\nyou've simplified it and made it more\naccessible which I agree calm has I\nactually think that is how meditation\nshould be and and is in reality when you\neven look thousands of years ago it was\nfar more easy and accessible it wasn't\nthis mystical thing and it's almost like\nas things come into the modern world\nwhen they're older we just kind of put\nthis tag on them as being vintage or\nmystical or unknown but the truth is\nthat it was a part of society it was a\npart of the way kids were raised and\nwhat they were taught at school and so\nwhat even gave you the perspective to\nsay we feel that we're going to take\nthis broad-minded view to meditation\nlike you started with like sleep tales\nand stories and when I saw that I was\nlike this is genius because so much\nmeditation especially of the past in my\ntradition too from my monk time is\nstorytelling like so many meditations\nare based on stories and I think that\nthe modern day became about like being\nstill and being silent and but you had\nthis really broad-minded view how did\nthat evolve and where did that come from\nyes so there were two big step changes\nin the early days where we saw a big big\nincrease in in usage and audience uh the\nfirst was when we introduced The Daily\nCal you know Tamara was our first\nteacher she she was just phenomenal she\nis she is so good but before that we\njust were encouraging people to to\nmeditate listen to the same content\nevery single day that's hard people are\nbusy sitting down and uh it just wasn't\nconnecting with people and the beauty of\nthe daily calm is that it's different\nevery day and humans like variety and\nthey like storytelling as you say and\nTamara would leave everyone with a\nbeautiful quote um it would be memorable\nuh people actually started instead of\nthinking of it as a chore every morning\npeople would look forward to it they'd\ntalk about what they learned in the\ndaily calm and they'd share it in the\ndaily calm community and so these\nripples started to to grow so that was a\na big early shift and secondly the Sleep\nstories you know we um we were looking\nat the the data and we realized that a\nlot of people were using Tamara's\nbeautiful voice to fall asleep at night\nand we were like no no no that's not\nwhat that's not what you're supposed to\ndo so we thought what if we could create\nstories we could take the bedtime story\nthat's been around for forever sprinkle\na little magic on it and create the\nSleep story and so people think oh\nthey're boring Tales they bore you to\nsleep but it's not like that at all\nthere's a lovely curve of Interest where\nyou start in an engaging way your mind\nis probably worrying away with a lot of\nother things and you're intrigued about\nthis story and then we mix in music and\nsound effects and the voice gently gets\nsofter the pacing between the words get\nlonger until before you know it you're\nfast asleep and sleep has been such a\nbig issue so many people knock\nthemselves out with alcohol or sleeping\npills and this is just a delightful\njoyful simple way of of drifting off\nevery night and it it's now actually the\nbiggest part of the app because\nmeditation again is is not\nstraightforward everyone goes to sleep\nevery night 8 billion people that's a\npretty big Market to uh to look after\nyeah absolutely absolutely and it's such\na important part of our life to solve\nright like I think you know the\nimportance of sleep when was it when did\nyou find that not only of course 8\nbillion people are going to sleep but\nwhen did you find that like you looked\nat the studies on how important sleep is\nfor our health and well-being like how\nearly did you kind of realize that was\nan issue you wanted to solve so so\nMatthew Walker's book why we sleep came\nout a few years ago and I think Society\nhad a big Awakening uh excuse the P at\nthat point around sleep because before\nthen there was this uh view in society\nthat you know well I'll sleep when I'm\ndead the lack of sleep you got was\nalmost a badge of honor in the workplace\nand I think very importantly that has\nchanged people get it now it's not just\npart of your health and wellness it's\nit's a foundation so we were a little\nbit before Matthew Walker's book came\nout we just felt a sense that there was\nsomething something really really key\nhere and um and then one of the the big\nelevations there was bringing in talent\nand and celebrities for years we'd been\ntrying to get Hollywood interested in\nrecording some content within Cal we\nwere knocking on doors and no one would\nanswer and uh eventually um uh guy and\nand Ashton from sound Ventures they were\none of our early investors they\nintroduced us to Matthew mccon and he\nused Cal for one of his charities in\nTexas and we said Matthew would you\nrecord a sleep story for us and he said\nsure thing and great voice oh he's got\nsuch a good voice very very popular um\nso some of the earliest Talent we had on\nthe app uh was Anna Acton my sister\nSteven fry Jerome Flynn from Game of\nThrones so um the talent coming onto\ncalm suddenly made this practice and\ntalking about your mental health and\nmeditating and mindfulness it\npopularized it it made it almost cool\nand so that really helped the growth\naccelerate dramatically no it's\nfantastic and again I was watching all\nof that from the sidelines at the time\nand just thinking how genius it was\nbecause to me as well it was making\nmeditation accessible and relevant as\nwe've already said but it was putting it\ninto a language and a voice that people\ncould understand could relate to could\nconnect to could see it as entertainment\nalmost entertainment is a really good\nexample it seems strange to talk about\nthis beautiful ancient practice as as\nentertainment and mental health is a\nvery serious subject but as we know if\nyou want to connect with people if you\nwant to get their attention make\nsomething joyful make something\nentertaining the the fastest way to\nconnect with another human being is is\nthrough a smile and so we thought could\nwe not take ourselves too seriously\ncould we have a little bit of fun with\nthis and we did and so several examples\nover the last two years you know we um\nwe have a brilliant uh person working\nwith our PR team Peter who came up with\nthe idea of creating barar land around\nthe time of La La Land the film and he\nsaid what if we created a movie eight\nhours long of sheep grazing in a\nfield and it was very calming and\npeaceful um we did a Premiere with red\ncarpet in London and had sheep walk down\nand we got so much publicity and\nattention for it people loved it then\nwhen gdpr came out you remember the\nlegislation uh very very serious and\ndare I say a little bit boring we got\nsomeone to read it as a sleep story and\nwe got loads of PR for it um falling\nasleep to gdpr so we did a lot of these\nkind of quirky unusual little ideas and\nthat PR again made people go wow maybe\nI'll check this out maybe this isn't so\nweird and and woo woo and this could be\nfor me yeah it's I mean I I love it and\nit's so genius but at the same time like\nyou said there there can be the view and\nI've definitely talked about this before\nlike there can be the view that it's\nlike well this is such an ancient sacred\npractice and like how can you make it so\nyou know how can you make it so silly or\nso one would say silly or clever or\ngenius or or how can you make it so\nfrivolous and it's really interesting\nbecause that perspective I think has of\ncourse validity and there's there's\ngreat thought behind that but I think\nwhat I've gained or learned over time is\nthat people starting their journey of\nmeditation meeting people where they're\nat meeting people where they're starting\nwith their struggle with their challenge\nis so much more compassionate and loving\nand kind than it is to force someone to\nadopt a practice that they may never\nadopt or may think is so alien to them\nthat they'd never have a chance and I've\nalways said that to people like real\nit's not a technique it's actually\ncompassion and empathy where it's like I\nunderstand where you are I understand\nthat and I think about myself in that\nway where as a young kid growing up in\nLondon the amount of times I laughed or\nwas making fun of someone trying to get\nme to meditate when I was younger\nbecause it was was just bizarre it's\nlike I just want to go and drink and\nhave a good time like I don't want to\nthink about meditation but maybe if K\nhad been around when I was younger then\nit would have been an easy place to\nstart for me and that would have been\nthe beginning of my journey and of\ncourse Karma's evolved so much since but\nyeah how have you kind of tackled that\nopinion because I'm sure you faced that\nso much very much so in the early days\nwhen we'd go to parties and tell people\nwe were building a a meditation out we'd\nget one of two reactions one is that\nthey'd back away from us and make any\nexcuse to go and talk to someone\nelse um the second was that they'd be\nlike oh I've heard of that I've tried it\nbut I can't do it you know my mind is\nfar too too busy and it has been\nextraordinary how that has shifted over\nthe last decade again this is connected\nto mental health do you remember how\nstigmatized it was no one talked about\nit could you imagine telling your boss\nyou were struggling with your mental\nhealth uh years ago it it wouldn't have\nbeen a good move and and for most\norganizations now that has changed\ndramatically I think it was because\npeople did have so many misconceptions\nabout meditation there were so many\nmyths associated with it I think they\nthought it was either religious or\nconnected to the counterculture they\nthought they might have to dress up in\nrobes or go to a different country or\nsit for hours and hours in an\nuncomfortable position and we just\nwanted to let people know that that is\nnot true you can literally start with\none mindful breath if you don't have\ntime to to meditate for a minute or 10\nor or longer uh literally start with one\nconscious mindful breath and then build\nyour practice from there yeah no and I\nand I think that I'm hoping that and I\nmean we know it from the fact of the\namount of people that have taken up to\nit and it's been the beginning of their\nmeditation practice and and just where\nit's gone from them as well but for you\nwhat's it been like building the\nbusiness of it because that's you know\nobviously it's been over 10 years now\nand I'm guessing that it's really\ninteresting when you're building a medit\nbusiness it doesn't mean you're not\nimmune to burnout and stress pressure\nand that includes the team it includes\nyou it includes there's so many things\nthat come up in business that don't help\nyou be mindful or on the contrary where\nmindfulness can really help as well so\ntalk to us about that balance yes so\nAlex and I love business you know we\nlove startups taking crazy ideas and\nputting them out into the world so this\nhas been such a a joy to to work on but\neven though we we practice what we\npreach and and we've learned a huge\namount from from K on this journey we're\nnot immune and and during the pandemic\nwe both really struggled we were running\nthe company over Zoom we were on Zoom\nfor 10 12 hours sometimes more every\nsingle day and uh we were based in\nEurope the team was over in in the US so\nthere was time zone challenges as\nwell and uh we just started to feel it\nwe felt it in our bodies you know we\nweren't moving uh around as much um we\nfelt it in our minds we were just tired\nand stressed and exhausted so that was a\nvery very challenging time and and we're\nboth in a much sharper more energized\nplace now but uh that was a very tricky\npart of the the\njourney and it was one of the reasons\nwhy we both decided to take a new role\nand bring David in as as the CEO who was\nabsolutely brilliant we bought his\ncompany Ripple one of the reasons was we\nwanted to move more into Healthcare you\nknow Healthcare in the US uh is a $4\ntrillion industry and a very small\nproportion of that is spent on mental\nhealth and that is changing rapidly and\nso Ripple was a Healthcare company so\nthat helped but we also just wanted to\nget back both of us to to what we love\nmost which is the the zero to one phase\nthat messy chaotic creative wonderful\npart where you're building something\nthat that has never existed in the world\nbefore and we weren't able to do that\nwhen we were on Zoom for 12 12 hours a\nday we were doing you know 2026\nFinancial Planning and uh feedback with\nteam members and it it was uh it was not\nlighting us up we could do it we can run\nhundreds of P people company but um I\nthink in life you have to focus deeply\non what you are really really good at so\na few sleepless nights before handing\nover the the Reigns to David as CEO but\nI I can honestly say it's been one of\nthe best things I've ever done and I\nthink Alex feels the same so we are both\nnow co-chairman so we're still involved\nvery deeply in a new way but um because\nwe love business and creativity so much\nwe're now running calm studios in London\nwhich is fully connected to calm but\nit's where we can dream up the future\nwhere is the puck going what is the\nfuture of mental health and what is the\nfuture products and services of calm so\nuh that's what we're deeply involved in\nat the moment I mean that's so exciting\nand it's such a beautiful example as\nwell of just how Detachment works even\nin business and knowing when it's okay\nto let go of something to create more\nspace for something else and it's\ninteresting because you can talk about\nthat but to do it in a practical sense\nwhen you're building you know the first\nmental health unicorn and building one\nof the biggest mental health and sleep\napps in the world to then go actually we\ndon't want to work on this part anymore\nwe have we believe in it we care about\nit but we actually want to focus on the\nfuture again and that you know you've\nmade it sound seamless but I can imagine\nthat's very challenging because you know\nI think we get attached to roles we get\nattached to titles we get attached to\nJourneys and we talked a lot about this\nwhen when I was coming on with you and\nand it was the same for me where I had a\nlot of people in my business and my\nworld saying to me like Jay you should\nstartop up your own app and why would\nyou partner with the Comm and why would\nyou partner with anyone and you know we\nhad other apps that were reaching out to\nus and I saw all of that I think we\ntalked about this very openly and I said\nI saw that if I went down that path it\nwould have been egotistic I would have\ndone it for my ego not for what I\nactually want for the world and what I\nsaw you doing was so\naligned with what I'd want to do for the\nworld I was like well wouldn't I join\nforces like isn't that what my\nmeditation practice would want me to do\nwhere collaboration would be better than\ncompetition if you're trying to achieve\nthe same goal for society and so it's\nreally interesting how for me at least\nI'm always looking for how am I still\nacting out of the same old mindset even\nthough I've been meditating for years am\nI still pulled by that or am I able to\nbe self-aware and say okay and that was\nyou know one of the biggest reasons why\nI came on at calm because I was like\nthis is a mission I believe in obviously\nI'm friends with the team loved getting\nto know David now he's\nfantastic and I'm like okay I want to\nwork for the world with people that I\nlove and care about for people that I\nwant to serve and help as opposed to\nlive from my ego and I'm guessing\nthere's a bit of that and when you go\nyeah I'm not going to be CEO anymore\neven though I've built this thing from\nscratch but now I'm going to start again\nI'm guessing there's a bit of Detachment\nthere would you is that accurate or how\nwould you then your words very very very\naccurate and I think what you're saying\nis is about Focus as well we can't do\neverything in life you know you like us\nget asked to do a lot of different\nthings and you have to uh get good at\nsaying no and know what is the elements\nthat really light you up what are the\nareas where you can have the biggest\nimpact and uh and I think focus is so\nimportant for anyone listening wanting\nto build something new figure out what\nthat is and don't be worried if you're\nnot quite sure what that is take your\ntime to find it you know I use this\nphrase phase um when you want to create\nsomething new take a step back often if\nif you have the chance not everyone has\nthe luxury but if you have the chance go\naway on your own for a few days clear\nyour head get into a new space a new\nenvironment and then marinade yourself\nin the the areas that you're intrigued\nabout and what starts to happen is you\nstart connecting dots that you might not\nhave seen before you know watch\ndocumentaries related to what you're\nthinking about read books and\nautobiographies chat to people who are\nexpert in this area and suddenly the\nlight starts to to become brighter and\nit becomes clearer what you need to do\nnow that often doesn't happen you know\nover a few days it can take weeks\nsometimes years every time I've started\nup a new company or a business there's\nbeen a huge amount of work before day\none uh just thinking and planning and\nthen you just have this very strong\nFoundation that you can build your\nskyscraper on top of calm was was that\ncase from the very early days we did a\nlot of research and a lot of thinking\nbut our mission was to make the world\nhappier and healthier and it stayed\nexactly the same over this last decade\nyou know I I love hearing that because\nand I love your advice on stepping back\nyou know to kind of really understand\nwhat you're trying to do and I love the\nidea of you saying that it could take\nyears I I think the challenge has become\nthat today because we're living in a\nworld where there's so many successes\nand there's so many more success stories\nin our\ngeneration that people are scared to\nstart because they're scared if it won't\nbe big enough or it won't be like when I\nstarted creating content I wasn't even\naware that it could get a million views\nlike I didn't think about that I was\nhappy with 100 views or a, views at one\npoint because I didn't have a false\nmarker in the same way with business\nlike I don't think most companies that\ntoday have a billion dollar valuation or\neven billion in Revenue like they didn't\nstart with knowing that that would be\nthe case maybe at one point it became a\nstrategic plan or a focus to get there\nbut that's not how they felt on day one\nand it's almost like not having that\npressure was better because then you\nwere able to Pivot and shift and change\nand not stayed so tied and I think today\nwe're I mean calm was always meant to be\na meditation app I guess and now it's so\nmuch more it's a sleep app it's got you\nknow like you were just saying now like\nthere's now the daily move right there's\nso much more happening on the app that's\nnot meditation and that comes from being\nopen and curious and so how do you\nencourage people because I think there's\nso many people listening right now and\nthey may be like Michael I want to start\nthe next app or Jay I want to start the\nnext podcast or I want to build this\nlike you've given some really great\nInsight but I personally feel there's\ntoo much pressure for what you build to\nbe big and that's actually what ruins it\nyes very very good point so we live in\nthis culture where it just looks like\nthere's overnight successes everywhere\nwe're surrounded by people who are who\nare smashing it and the reality is every\none of those people have been on a\njourney and they've spent a long time\ngetting to that point so first of all do\nthe Deep work as I just mentioned do\nyour research there's no no shortcuts\nand then patience is incredibly\nimportant accept and understand that\nyou're going on a journey and you're not\ngoing to crack it and be on front of\nmagazines you know in the first week or\nyear maybe not even in the first decade\nbut if you believe deeply and what\nyou're doing if it you know is is deeply\ningrained and you've done that that\nfoundation work then you'll put one foot\nin front of the other and and you'll get\nthere eventually and it's often said\nthat compounding is the eighth wonder of\nthe world in financial terms it's true\nin self-development and building a\nbusiness and and growing ourselves it\ndoesn't happen overnight and so being\naware of that and being ready for that\nuh long journey I think is very very\nimportant yeah and I think that time\nthat it takes to to master something so\nthat it becomes worldw worthy almost to\nto speak it's almost like a law of the\nuniverse that when you've put in that\nmuch time and energy and effort and\ndiligence it's likely to succeed but\nit's just the patience that it takes to\nput in that 10 years of Mastery or\nwhatever it may be for a different skill\nlike you just kept saying it there's no\nshortcuts there's no easy way through\nthat and I think one of the other\nchallenges is people will see success\naround them and hear about a story or a\ntype of business and then go and build\nit like a good example is there are now\nthousands and thousands of meditation\nand mindfulness and sleep app and heads\nspace and Cal and a handful of others\nwere were there first the problem is if\nyou're building something because you're\nseeing it everywhere in society you're\ngoing to be too late you know I often\ntalk about the analogy of of Surfing\nwhen you're trying to catch that wave if\nyou're hearing about something in\nsociety the wave is already broken and\nthose Surfers are far off into the\nsunset that's why you've got to do that\nwork up front and figure out which wave\nis building uh in the distance what's\ncoming closer and closer you also don't\nwant to be too early because freeze to\ndeath before the sun comes up and before\nthat wave ever gets to you so timing is\nso crucial but when you catch that wave\nwhen you're ready it's an extraordinary\nthing and then as I say the compounding\ntakes place and we were very fortunate\nwith our timing and it was tricky in the\nearly days because as I say no one was\nreally talking about mental health\nthought or mindfulness it took about\nhalf a decade uh before we were able to\nraise our series a investment but again\nwe had that very deep conviction that\nthis was eventually going to happen we\njust needed that patience and uh we were\nbuilding day by day step by step and\nthen uh then whoosh art it's been\nholding on to the rocket ship ever since\nso would you say that that process\nbecause I love what you're saying there\nand I think it reminds me of something\nthat Rick Rubin was saying when he was\nhere and you know he was he was talking\nabout from a music point of view but\ncreating art and and even with you you\nare you're a great business person and\nyou know that's such a you you've built\ncompanies before this as well like you\nhave a successful for track record but\nat the same time whenever I talk to you\nand this is I think why we get along as\nwell is because you you're an artist at\nheart and and you're a creative at heart\nI feel at least and what I'm hearing is\nthat there's it's almost like you have\nto be so like when you talk about\nsurfing I'm I'm terrible at surfing I've\nonly tried it once me too by the way\nyeah yeah I was I was going to ask you I\nwas like you sound like a pro right now\nbut when you think about surfing and you\nthink about it it's being so aligned\nwith nature and being so aware and\nyou're so present and conscious about\nthe air and the wind and the wave and as\nas you're describing it it's almost like\nyou've got to be so in\ntune to really know when to catch that\nwave you're almost talking about it as\nif it's an intuitive art like there's\nsome can you expand on that for us\nbecause that's really beautiful and I\nthink we almost talk about it through\nall the externals like where's the\nindustry going and where's this and that\ndoes work for sure but I think what\nyou're saying is actually far more of an\nartist conversation in yes so surfing is\na very mindful activity you know you're\nout there in nature and balance is\nimportant so so many different\nconnections with with meditation and\nmindfulness and I feel that analog works\nwith with business as well you can\nanalyze stuff until you're blue in the\nface and look at every chart and\nprojection and uh sometimes you just\nhave to step back and and feel into it\nwhat's the intuition what is your god\nInstinct telling you about this\nopportunity I listen very carefully to\nmy mind and my body at 4:00 a.m. in the\nmorning that's a great signal when I'm\nwaking up and it and it alerts me to\nopportunity and trouble as well I've\nbuilt many businesses that haven't\nworked and even though I may have been\nwinning Awards and being written about\npositively in the Press I'll wake up\nevery night at at 4:00 a.m. and my body\nwill be saying uh-uh this isn't working\nlisten to me and uh you can ignore that\nvoice for for only so long so I think\nbusiness is this just beautiful mix of\ndata and Analysis very very important\nbut when you combine it with magic and\ncreativity and intuition the center of\nthat ven diagram I think is where the\nthe the biggest most exciting\nopportunities are built yeah what are\nsome of the learnings that are coming\nout of calm Studios I'm fascinating now\nas soon as you mentioned that I was like\noh that's amazing I want to know what's\nhappening there like yeah what are some\nof the key learnings or the key kind of\nCuriosities that have already stemmed\nfrom that work well next time you're in\nSoHo you must come and visit I have to I\nyeah I have to and it's tiny space you\nwouldn't think this is you know calm\nyeah that's the best it's very Scrappy\nuh we're a barely a one pizza team\nthere's Sam and Anis and Steve and me\nand Alex and uh we're just having an\nabsolute blast so we we've been thinking\nvery carefully as I say about this\nmarinating process and thinking deeply\nwe've been exploring a lot of different\nideas uh psychedelics is such a\nfascinating area and I think we could\ntalk about that for hours and hours I\nwon't um but you know that that uh that\ncould um hold a huge amount of promise\nfor how we treat and support people with\nmental health you know there's still a\nlot of research and science that needs\nto take place but there's very early\npositive signs so we explored the idea\ncould calm step in and uh work here and\nI think that may be something for the\nfuture we've looked at going offline\ncalm has 100 million downloads but not\nthat much presence in the physical world\nand there's nothing quite like looking\nin someone's eyes or being in the same\nspace with them so how can calm show up\nthere could it be physical products\ncould it be events and parties and uh\ncreating communities uh around the world\nin in different cities could it be a\nresort one day you know the most\nrelaxing calm Resort in in the world so\nwe've explored that a little bit but\nwhere we've kind of settled and where\nwe're going deep at the moment is an\narea that has really caught the\nattention over the last year uh which is\nartificial intelligence now obviously AI\nhas been around for decades you know we\nwe've had the the Deep learning\nRevolution over a decade ago chat GPT\ncaught the attention uh last December so\neveryone's buzzing about it now but\nwe've been thinking about this for for\nquite a bit uh longer and asking the\nquestion how can these incredibly\npowerful silicon brains support our\nbeautiful and fragile human brains how\ncan AI help Humanity so many many\ndifferent ways uh we're we're tackling\nthat could AI be an amplifier and\naugment mental health professionals\ncould it help on board patients could it\nProvide support 24/7 when you're not\nwith a human therapist the average time\nit takes to see a therapist in in the US\nis about six or seven weeks when you\nneed support that's way too long um so\ncould there be an intermediate step and\nif you think of mental health as falling\non a spectrum apps like Karma fantastic\nat the the healthier end um but as you\nmove into the sort of Amber and orange\nand middle end uh therapy becomes more\nvaluable but there's a big gap between\nan app like K which is very proactive\nand seeing a human therapist could AI\nplay a role in that Center Point um so\nthere's many different uh paths we're\nexploring there I'm very curious to know\nwhat your thoughts are of of AI because\nI imagine you've had many many\nconversations on this I think we have a\nsimilar approach to things\nwhere I try not to get lost in the kind\nof negative news that stems around any\nnew discovery because I think we kind of\ndo it constantly and sometimes I find we\nmake it harder to find usefulness and\nsolutions through new technology that's\nhappening anyway as opposed to we get so\ndistracted by like well these are the\nissues and this is what's going wrong\nand this is where it's going to destroy\nHumanity Etc and and I think that those\nkind of headlines kind of steal the show\nand they distract us from saying well\nactually this is happening anyway\nwhether you like it or not it already\nexists how can we now make sure that as\nhumans we are benefited by it and that\nit helps us and supports Us by analyzing\nthe potential challenges and coming up\nwith Solutions rather than going oh God\nit's it's the same thing we did with the\ninternet I'm sure it was the same thing\nthat was done with TVs back in the day\nit was the same thing we did with social\nmedia and it's kind of tiring CU we kind\nof still having those same conversations\nwhen I'm like look no one's going to\nstop using social media no one's going\nto stop using their phones let's stop\ntalking about that as the ultimate\nsolution to helping people with this and\nthe same with AI people are using chat\nGPT already and like you said ai's been\naround so I think when I think about AI\nI personally think about it in a similar\nway to you're saying so I've always\nwanted the idea of people to have a\ncoach in their pocket MH so if people\nwere able to get not only reminders\nwhich is what our phones do already but\nthey're reminders that you have to put\nin but I've always had this feeling of\nlike if your body could notify your\ncoach of what you need without you\nknowing it and then your coach could\nthen prescribe you whether there is\ncontent food recommendations diet\nrecommendations supplement\nrecommendations it would make it so much\nmore seamless and easy because I think\nfor so many of us we don't actually know\nhow we feel and unless you're looking at\ndata and unless you're looking at what's\nactually happening the body so to give\nyou an example for me a couple of years\nago I was feeling fatigue and low energy\nand I couldn't figure it out because I\nthought I was sleeping well I thought I\nwas eating well and I thought I was\nworking out so I was doing all the right\nstuff and it was only when I got my\nvitamin D levels checked where I\nrealized that my vitamin D level was at\na 10 supposedly healthy is around 60 and\nlike great is like 100 and I'm at 10 and\nI'm living my current level of Lifestyle\njust 2 three years ago and without that\npiece of data I wouldn't have known what\nthe problem was and I would have\ndiagnosed the problem as well maybe\nthere's something going wrong up here\nmaybe I'm not working out enough maybe\nI'm not eating enough greens you just\nmake stuff up and so I think a data\nlevel approach that AI could help\nmeasure but then AI could help find\nsolutions for to me is very exciting\nbecause I think when humans are left to\ndiagnose their own issues I think we\ncause more issues and cause more stress\nand stressing about stress is we both\nknow is not healthy so I love the gaps\nthat AI can fill so I've been testing a\nneutr sense glucose monitor just because\nI've been fascinated by glucose levels\nand how keeping steady glucose levels is\nhealthier for us and so I had the\nmonitor in me for a couple of weeks I'm\ngoing to put the new one in soon and\nwhile I was testing it I could see where\nif I ate like and I was eating I was\nback in London so I was back from my\nsister's wedding in London I literally\ngot back two days ago and when I'm back\nin London I'm eating much unhealthier\nthan when I'm in LA and I still went out\nand find found a no sugar cereal\ngluten-free or whatever I was trying to\nbe really healthy and I had it and it\nstill spiked my glucose into the bad\nlevels and I was thinking I would never\nhave known that because eating it I felt\nfine and so I think if AI could help us\nmonitor measure and then navigate\nSolutions which includes meditations it\nincludes uh sleep monitors whatever it\nmay be I I think it's incredible what\ncould happen especially to make it\naffordable and that's what I get excited\nabout is making it affordable which Karm\nhas always been at the Forefront of that\nlike making things affordable and\naccessible well I love what you're\nsaying because it's it's very similar to\nwhat we're thinking at at calm Studios\nyou know one of the questions we've\nasked ourselves is could we build the\nworld's greatest health coach what would\nthat be and as you say you know having a\nhuman coach is the best the gold\nstandard but that is not cheap and and\nnot widely distributed so having a coach\nin your pocket 24/7 that you can chat to\nwhenever you want nudging you motivating\nyou inspiring you and here's the\ninteresting thing the AI will get to\nknow you better than your yourself it\nwill see your healthkit data it will ask\nhow you're feeling every day and then\nstart making fascinating inferences and\nand connections and surprising you on a\non a day-to-day basis so you know I\nthink it was Socrates that said many\nmany years ago know thyself and AI can\nhelp you really know yourself but that's\nonly one part of the puzzle and I think\none of the problems with AI at the\nmoment is it's very logic driven one of\nthe foundation models we've been so\nimpressed with is what inflection have\nbuilt p I don't know if you've had a\nchance to check out Pi it's beautiful if\nif gp4 is IQ Pi is more EQ it's uh it's\nlike chatting to a really thoughtful\nfriend it asks you questions it keeps\nthe conversation flowing it's very\ncompassionate and empathetic and that's\nthe essence that we want to capture with\nwhat we're doing and the other thing to\nsay here is that interface is so crucial\nyou know gpt3 was released I think in\nabout 2020 but it didn't capture the\nimagination it was only when the rapper\nof chat came about that people suddenly\nwere able to to connect with it and and\ntalk about it and make it more\naccessible and simple kind of like we\ndid with with meditation back in the day\nso we're asking ourselves having a great\nAI health coach is one step but what do\nwe build around it could we create\nsomething that is set in a universe with\na vast array of characters could there\nbe storytelling could there be music and\nand Magic could we add a gamified\nelement you know look at Jingo and what\nthey've done uh to make learning a langu\nanguage fun and en joyful and as we said\nat the beginning if you can make\nanything fun and entertaining that's how\nyou cut through the noise and and get\npeople to pay attention so I think\nthat's one of the big shifts we're\nthinking about at calm Studios and and\nwe think for this next evolution of of\ncalm because 100 million downloads is\ngreat but there are 8 billion people in\nthe world there's a lot more people we\nwant to connect with and reach these are\nthe kind of conversations that I love\ntoo because because it's it's so\nexciting trying to figure out and and by\nthe way I I want to remind everyone that\nlook you know Michael said it earlier\ntoo if you can get a physical coach if\nyou can get out in nature if you can get\nout there and you know play pickle ball\nwhich I'm doing a lot of right now like\nwhatever it is like those things are\nnever ever not going to help right being\noutdoors in nature like listening to\nnature sounds for real but like K you\nknow I I use nature sounds on K all the\ntime I'm not always in a space where I\ncan access nature sounds like I can't\nalways be in a rainforest orever and and\nbeing able to have it digitally is\nhelpful and I think that's what we're\nsaying here where it's like if you can\ndo things physically of course do them\ndon't don't stop doing them like it's\nimportant to talk to a real friend it's\nimportant to talk to a real human but\nfor everyone who's struggling or those\nthings are not immediately accessible\nthat's where I think why we've seen such\na rise in the digital world because we\nare looking for Alternatives and we are\nlooking for support and I've definitely\nfound that the collective approach of of\ndata and human has been really powerful\nfor me personally like I found in my own\npersonal mental health journey I still\nneed to talk to my best friend three\ntimes a week which I don't stop doing\nbut at the same time I do need to\nmeasure the quality of my sleep my\nglucose my vitamin D levels whatever it\nmay be because they're equally affecting\nhow I feel on a daily basis yeah no\nthat's that's well put I think I think\nthe key is awareness and understanding\nand this is what developing uh\nmindfulness practice does attention is\nthe most valuable resource in the 21st\ncentury but our attention is dragged in\nso many different directions it's so\neasy to go through life like a a\nmarionette on on the the strings of the\nthe Puppet Master not being consciously\naware of what's going on but if you can\ncatch yourself if you can build a\npractice and know where your attention\nis going you can put it where you want\nso you can spend time in the digital\nworld and on social media and watching\nNetflix and all these things that that\ndo bring value to our life but you catch\nyourself and don't overdo them and\nsuddenly find yourself 3 hours later\nafter using Tik Tok and so I think\nhaving that sense of of control knowing\nwhat's going on in your mind knowing\nwhere you're consciously putting your\nattention and how you're feeling and\nstriking that right balance is is a\nsuperpower in our modern society yeah\nand I think what we're trying to do here\nwhich I think is key is trying to create\nalternatives for viewers or listeners on\nthe platform that we're on anyway yes\nlike I often like people often ask me\nwell Jay you're making social media\ncontent and I'm saying yes because we're\ngoing to be on social media anyway so\nwhy not give people another option to\nhave something that hopefully is\neducational entertaining and insightful\nthat can benefit their life and so same\nway as you're saying I love the idea of\nlooking at you know I mean AI is already\nable to but especially with the EQ\nversion you're saying there with pi like\nAI is able to write movie scripts and TV\nshow scripts and conversation scripts\nand it's going to be able to it is\nalready able to but going to be able to\ndo so many things in an entertaining way\nto find a way that people can almost go\non a unique Journey that was tailored\nmade for them like I always get asked\nwhen I coach clients everyone's like so\nwhat's your program and I'm like the\nprogram is unique for every client\nbecause you can't take everyone on the\nsame program the fact that you could\nhave a tailor made unique program for\nyou and visuals and universes and\nexperience could be created is quite\ncrazy and phenomenal to think about like\nright now we're just used to suggested\nfor you but imagine suggested for you in\nthe metaverse and suggested for you\nLandscapes places to visit people to\nknow it's quite remarkable to think how\nhow personalized it could get yeah we\nthink it's it's going to be very very\nexciting combining all these things to\ntogether so yeah we're having a lot of\nfun at at calm Studios and I just want\nto jump back to something you said on on\nsocial media because social media gets a\nreally bad wrap in our society and\nthere's a lot of people that are very\nstressed about it and it does cause a\nlot of uh anxiety and polarization in\nsociety but there's a lot of joy in\nsocial media as well again when you when\nyou take to it consciously you know I've\nmet some wonderful friends through\nsocial media incredible business\nopportunities have have flowed from it\nit can be really joyful and entertaining\nbut again it's about using it for you in\ninstead of against you being very aware\nof how you're using it dipping in and\nout um if you're on social media\nmindlessly scrolling late at night\nbefore you go to bed that's that's not\nideal if you dip in and out every now\nand then that I think is a much more\npowerful way of doing it and you can\napply this to most things in life you\nknow stop pause take a deep breath and\nthink is this helping me is this serving\nme and uh that fraction of a a second\ncan completely transform and and change\nyour life I guess that that's it though\nMichael like you just hid the nail on\nthe head there and that is the\nultimate human skill of being conscious\nit's almost like being selective about\nwhere you are why you're there and how\nyou want to interact with this person\napp technology space but being conscious\nseems to\nbe the ultimate lesson because like you\njust said that doesn't just apply to\nsocial media it applies to everything\nhow do we help people developed that\nbecause that's that's how I feel like I\nyou know I often talk about it with\npeople as well this idea that Envy has\nalways existed social media's just\nAmplified it ego has always existed\nsocial media's just put a magnifying\nglass on it the desire for competition\nand status and status and all of these\nPursuits that we have they've always\nbeen there like I remember at school it\nwas what what trainer you wore to school\nor sneaker you wore to school made you\nthe cool kid now you just post your\nlatest sneakers on Instagram it's the\nsame thing and so it's just Amplified it\nand it's exposed you to far more\npeople's trainers right like the idea\nthat back in the day if there were 20\nkids in the class in this 20 kids in the\nplayground you know I had high-techs on\nCU my parents didn't buy me Nikes and\nthen so was like I had high-techs that\nperson had Adidas or Adidas that person\nhad Nike or Nikes and and that was the\ncompetition whereas now you can see 3\nmillion kids shoes and now you feel 2\nmillion\n97 on the list as opposed to 23rd and so\nthe exposure gone High the scale has\nincreased but the problem has still\nremained the same that we don't know who\nwe are we don't know where our selfworth\nand our confidence comes from and we're\nnot conscious about our choices like\nthat is the rote at least in my opinion\nhow have you thought about answering\nthat question for people because that is\nthe the real problem it's the\nfundamental question isn't it and it's\nwhat we're trying to achieve through\ncalm it's it's what you're doing with\nyour work you know Sam Harris talks\nabout it as waking up um it is becoming\nmore aware and more conscious so\ndeveloping a a mindfulness practice\nhelps know one of the things that that I\nthink has been very useful from doing it\nis this idea in life of responding\ninstead of reacting to stimulus stuff\nhappens constantly throughout the the\nday and if you instead of from the\namydala reacting someone cuts you up in\ntraffic and you honk your horn and\nsuddenly you're miserable and angry all\nday if you pause for a fraction of a\nsecond and think more thoughtfully and\nrespond it it changes everything you can\nstill get angry and honk your horn but\nyou're you're more aware you're doing it\nI think this is really important in\ninterpersonal relationships as well so\nmany triggers and and little things that\ncan cause arguments and and stress with\nour partner but I think pausing and\nthinking before resp responding is so so\nvaluable so that's that's one step but\nthere isn't an easy answer human beings\nare complex things and even though we\nknow what we should do even though\neveryone loves the idea of being more\nMindful and meditating one of the\nchallenges very few people sit down and\ndo it and build it into a healthy habit\nuh every single day and so this is why\nwhat we're doing at calm is a is a\nlifelong journey you know Decades of\nwork ahead of us I agree with you and I\nthink I think it's also just I really\nwould love for everyone to step back and\nlook at their\ndecisions and choices thus far in life\nand ask themselves why they chose those\nthings and what was their value behind\nthat choice and almost kind of go\nbackwards as far as you can and figure\nout what made you do something and most\npeople will track it back to parents\nSociety or hopefully some of the things\nwill be things that they really value\nand it's almost like how can you edit\neverything to be living your life based\non what you really value so that there's\nas little noise and as little\ndistraction from the outside world or\nForce as you're saying responding to\nsomething's happening as opposed to this\nis who I want to be yeah and this is how\nI want to live my life and that's not an\neasy practice and I'm not saying that\nthat will solve everyone's problems but\nI know that we've you've talked about\ncalm in healthcare which I fully agree\nwith and I love that direction I was\nreally passionate about that happening\nhow hard has it been to talk about calm\nin schools or calm for kids or where's\nthat conversation because I know that\nthat's something we've talked about\nbefore and I think we'd both be\npassionate about it how hard is that to\nmake happen well again that's a long\njourney but it's it's shifted a lot in\nthe last decade I remember some of the\nearly conversations we had where we\nwanted to bring calm into schools we got\nquite a bit of push back I think think\nagain people thought this was a bit\nweird and and religious and teachers\nhave been opening up to it and it is now\nin you know thousands of schools around\nthe world start their day with with\nsilence or or short meditations which is\nso valuable you I I use this quote a lot\nbut if you want to change the world as\nwe do at Cal start with the youngest\ngeneration and the Dal Lama said if we\ncould teach meditation to every\nseven-year-old in the world we could\neradicate violence in a generation\npretty profound and not easy to do so um\nthat is Shifting the problem is kids are\nnot particularly excited about\nmeditation un mindfulness they've got a\nlot lot of other exciting things going\non so you have to as you were saying\nearlier bring it to them and shape it in\na way that uh resonates with them and\noften entertainment can do that so we\njust did a a wonderful partnership with\nDisney and so Disney princess is helping\nkids uh fall asleep and and learn about\nmeditation we've worked with Peppa Pig\nand moshim monsters and a whole bunch of\nothers so that's been a very powerful\nstep in the right direction and sleep\nhas has been very valuable for kids so\nrather than trying to get them to sit\ndown and be still for a minute which is\nhard enough for adults almost impossible\nfor kids when they're going to bed sleep\nstories is a very mindful way a very\ngentle way for them to learn about this\npractice Yeah I love that I'm so glad\nthat you're talking about it that way\nbecause I agree you're not you know\nanyone who's listening is going right\nnow they're going I can't get my kid to\nsit still and and so I think you know I\nlove the idea of the Disney\ncollaboration is fantastic and I think\nmore of that is so needed these\ninnovative ideas of how meditation and\nmindfulness can be presented to kids\nbecause that that's literally all it is\nand I just you know this is a really\ngreat conversation to make that point\nthat please understand that when you're\ntrying to make things more accessible\nmore entertaining more practical for\npeople that's the only way it's going to\nwork because if we keep forcing people\nto do things in what we assume is the\npurest way it it may never ever be like\nyou're saying like a kid when are they\never how many kids are actually going to\nsit down and you know just breathe meet\npeople where they are understand what's\ngoing on in their world and then try and\ncreate and frame something that that\nworks for them you know for anyone\nlistening who is thinking about you know\ntheir big idea what their purpose in\nlife is going to be one thing that I\nfound very helpful is take something\nthat is already successful whether it's\ntoday or or in in decades past and then\nput a Twist on it a tweak and if you\nlook at some of the biggest successes of\nall time that that kind of is what's\ngoing on it's a pattern that human\nbeings have done again and again and\nagain but with a little tweak so it's\nfamiliar but it's got that newness and\nand uniqueness and if you can find that\nuh that no one else has done before as I\nsay lean into it do your research be\npatient and and you can have a\nphenomenal success I love it Michael\nthank you so much for today this has\nbeen so this has gotten so many\ndifferent directions than what we\nplanned but it's been so fun talking to\nyou oh and I'm so glad that we've I'm\nhoping that anyone who's listening and\nwatching you've gained a bit more\ninsight into how you can kind of tune\ninto that voice that you've got within\nyou to be creative to be reflective to\nbe introspective and you found that you\nfound just a bit of clarity on the\ndirection that you need to take\ninternally towards creating something\nthat can help the world and you can hear\nhow it can be a business it can be an\napp it can be a product it can be a\nservice it can be anything you want it\nto be but you got to be just that that\ntiming piece I want to go back and\nlisten to that because I thought that\nwas so powerful of if you're really\naware of the problem and you're aware of\nthe people you want to serve then you'll\nfind the potential solution but that\nrequires Stillness it requires sitting\nwith that community and that problem I\nthink just to jump in here I think you\nsaid something so important listening to\nthat inner voice and what we're very\ngood at at human beings doing is\ndistracting ourselves as we said earlier\nthere's so many distractions and we mask\nwhat we really need to hear with alcohol\nand drugs and Netflix and a a ton of\nother things how often are we really\ntruly in solitude and alone and\nlistening to ourselves and I I would\nencourage anyone listening to do to try\nand carve out time to do that if you can\nas we said earlier go away for a few\ndays on your own fantastic if you can't\ndo that a really valuable practice is\nfirst thing in the morning
