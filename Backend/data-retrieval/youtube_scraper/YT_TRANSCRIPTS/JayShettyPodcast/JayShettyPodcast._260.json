death\nin its eyes I've almost gone bankrupt\nmultiple times there are so many things\nthat I should not have succeeded at but\nI have because I I won't quit if you set\ngoals that are easy to accomplish then\nyou're actually saying you want to fail\nbefore we jump into this episode I'd\nlike to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett I wanted to ask you Michael what\nwhat was you know you're such a\nsuccessful business person what was your\nfirst ever job that you ever had in life\nso for me I think a lot of people know\nthe story I was a terrible student you\nknow barely met out of high school went\nto college for less than a semester um\nas bad as a student I was I was honestly\na worst athlete like I was just I wasn't\ncoordinated I wasn't a good athlete the\none thing I was always good at was\nworking like I love business from the\ntime I was a kid so everything I\nremember about being young was working\nso my first job was that I can remember\nwas probably 8 years old I probably had\nlike five different side hustles I mean\nI was selling trading cards you know by\nthe way not to my friends but to my\nfriend's parents cuz they had the money\nI was when it would snow in Philadelphia\nwhere I grew up I would get five kids to\ndo the snow shovel and I would go door\ntoo and actually sell the snow shoveling\nI was selling vegetable seeds door too I\nwas making stationary on the Apple 2\nplus and selling it I mean I was just\nlike I was the real entrepreneur like I\nit's what I was good at it's what I like\ndoing and so I had so many different\njobs as an 8-year-old but I mean that's\nlike when people say you know how long\nyou've been out it it's crazy 43 years\nI've been doing this since I've been 8\nyears old wow and when you were doing\nthat was there any inspiration was it\njust you wanted money what did you want\nto buy what were you doing with that\nlike what what excited you about I don't\nthink for me even at 8 years old it was\never about money or wanting to buy\nthings I think it was always about doing\nwhat you're good at and for me uh\nknowing that I wasn't a good like I had\na lot of learning challenges I mean as a\nkid like I had every you know person to\ntry to help me with all the things I\nsucked at whether it was athletically or\nyou know it was just like I just I\nwasn't good at sports I wasn't good at\nschool but business was what I was good\nat so I just always gravitate to that I\nthink that's a good thing like you\nshould always figure out how to do\nthings that you love you should figure\nout how to do things that you're good at\nand kind of double down on that so\nthat's always been my whole life how did\nyou know that at eight because I feel\nlike most eight-year-olds today\nobviously playing video games back then\nthey were probably watching TV maybe\nthey were out riding a bike like how did\nyou know that you were good at this and\nI think it's something for me I was born\nwith like I was born with that\nentrepreneurial hustle I think I came\nout of the womb like just you know\nwanting to be an entrepreneur like just\nloving the hustle and you know to me you\nknow I've been at this a long time I\nwork harder than I've ever worked today\nI love it's an honor to do it's fun it's\nan opportunity like I'm never tired I'm\nnever worn out like I'm just always I\njust want to go yeah can it be learned\ncan you teach people to hustle and grind\nand develop that mindset or is it born\nwith as you are so I think I was\ndefinitely born with it that said I do\nthink you know for me the way I learned\nis by being a sponge from people so I'm\nalways picking things up from different\npeople like if you just look at the\ndiversity people I have around me like\nI'm always taking so much learnings from\nthem to you know be better than what I\ndo and I try to give those back so yeah\nI think you can definitely learn a lot\nof the stuff just what you know find\npeople you respect find people that you\nadmire find people that you want to be\nlike and then you know take the good\nfrom them and by the way figure out what\nthey do that you don't like and ignore\nthat like I see good and bad in each\nperson I try to take the good and learn\nfrom the bad and same thing with me I\ngot lots of bad habits I mean like I'm\nmyself that's right that's all I ask for\nthat's all I ask for there is no\njudgment here there's no it's it's a the\nsafe space I just want people to be\ntheir authentic selves and so so please\ncontinue to be yourself and uh what's so\nwhat I love that idea of learning from\npeople being a human sponge what's the\nmost recent or most memorable think you\nthink you took away from someone a\nconversation a moment uh something you\nread or heard or Learned was there\nanything that kind of stuck with you\nyeah for sure I mean um look I'm in La\nfor the week I'm doing six to 10\nmeetings a day in my house and you know\ntwo of the people I met with in the last\ntwo days have been through some real\nchallenges and just watching the\nchallenges that they've been through I'm\nlike okay I need to be that much more\ncareful about how I conduct myself in\neverything that I do so to me I'm always\ntaking learnings away from people I\nthink if you're not like you know you\nhave no chance of like you know getting\nbetter at what you do I mean it's like\nlife is no different than Sports you\njust got to keep getting better at your\nsport and so to me I keep working at\neverything I do yeah what what do you\nthink obviously now like when you\nstarted 43 years ago at 8 years old\nentrepreneurship wasn't as touted as\nthis incredible no it wasn't it was it\nwas actually weird like to be clear like\nI was a nerd like like that I loved\nbusiness like entrepreneurialism came\ncool really around technology like I I\ndon't think it became cool till almost\nthe the from my perspective I think it\nwas the really the the birth of the doc\nerror you know kind of late 90s is when\nentrepreneurialism became cool I think\nbefore that was kind of nerdy and weird\nso I was definitely born before it all\nyeah and I'd say even off to the\nfinancial crisis in like 20078 like that\nrecession which is because I grew up in\nthe era where we still aspired to be\ninvestment bankers or Consultants so\nwhen I was at college or when I was\ngrowing up that was seen if you were\ninto business my goal was to go into\nthat world because that's what I aspired\nfor whereas I think the generation after\nme and the one after me they were like\nI'm not going to go work for someone I\nwant to build something on my own I\nthink that's amazing like for me I love\none of the things that I'm fortunate\nenough to do is really I think in a lot\nof ways you know encourage\nentrepreneurialism and you know one of\nour biggest businesses the Collectibles\nbusiness which is trading cards of\nmemorabilia and that's all about\nentrepreneurs the so many entrepreneurs\nin that business it's probably the\nbusiness in a lot of ways that I I\nactually relate to all three of our\nbusinesses but it's the business that's\nmaybe the most relatable for me because\nI grew up selling trading CS as an\n8-year-old but also it's all about\nentrepreneurialism talk to me through\nthat business because so I remember so\nback in London obviously where I grew up\nI collected football stickers right\nsoccer stickers so that's what we'd have\nwe'd have the big you'd have the spread\nwith all the Premier League clubs and\nyou'd collect the little stickers and\nthat was a big part of Collectibles how\nis that industry evolved as Tech is\ngrown or has it stayed the same where\npeople still collecting cards and like\ntop trumps and things like that yeah\nwell I'll say we got into the business\nabout three years ago in a really\nsignificant way today uh we own tops\nwhich is the you know kind of preeminent\nbrand in in trading cards I'd say that\nyou know until our arrival in the\nindustry a little less than three years\nago I said there hadn't been you know a\ntremendous amount of innovation there\nhadn't been a tremendous amount of\nmarketing you know we kind of looked at\nthe business said wow like this is such\nan incredible collector base such an\nincredible fan base yet it hasn't\nchanged for like decades here and you go\nto a you know the big Trading Card show\nwhere there's more than 100,000 people\nthat come to Chicago this past summer\nit's called the national Trading Card\nshow yeah it looks like something from\n20 30 40 years ago so for us that was\njust that just meant opportunity meant\nif you actually make Innovative products\nyou actually really Market these\nproducts you build a better consumer\nexperience and bring people forward into\n2023 like what an opportunity so for me\nlike I we do that in all of our business\nlike I love like we love finding great\nopportunities big challenges and kind of\nbeing unrelenting about going after him\nyeah how has that changed how has that\npractically changed like are people\nstill buying cards and trading physical\ncards are the biggest part of the\nbusiness a lot of ways very similar to\nArt but I can tell you like just as one\nquick example this year you know our\nteam came in and actually the CEO of our\nbusiness Mike Mayan said hey I got a\ngreat idea every time a player debuts\nfor the first time I want to put a patch\non their Jersey and then as soon as they\nget down the game I want to put that\npatch off and put it in a one-on-one\ntrading card so you have the card from\nfrom the first so think about for for us\nyou know maybe I grew up in the in the\nMichael Jordan era had I had you know\nMichael or yeah if I had Michael Jordan\nor CO's first 101 cards yeah that could\nbe the the most valuable Keepsake that I\ncould ever have and so you know that\nInnovation like for us it was really\nsimple like yeah why would you not want\nto put a patch on someone's Jersey\nsticking into a card and make this a\none-on-one card but no one did that\nuntil we created it and by the way it's\nalready live we came up with the idea\nthis past December it was in it was live\nin in April with with all baseball\nplayers it's going to be 3 to 400\nbaseball players debut this year you\nknow with this debut patch that we put\ninto a one-onone card so that's just\nlike one of dozens of examples of\nInnovations because you have to be\naggressive like we have to be great\nentrepreneurs we have to push and\nwhatever we do yeah no what I love about\nthat though for everyone who's listening\nis I think we're stuck in this world now\nthat believes that all innovation has to\nbe digital or technological or virtual\nor some sort of you know AI whereas this\nis like the most tangible physical\nchange but it's still so valuable\nbecause it's what people want look we're\nin three business today our first\nbusiness where we started is what we\ncall finax Commerce that's our\nmerchandise business we own Lids the Hat\nretailer we own Mitchell NES uh we own\nFanatics which operates you know\nobviously all of the different League\nyou the NFL shop the NBA Store and we\nsell you know more than $6 billion of\nmostly fan apparel and headwear okay\nabout um you know you know more than 100\nmillion units of merchandise a year\nthat's a very physical business okay but\nAI is helping us to do things more\neffectively in the Collectibles business\nAI is going to help us to be more\neffective and then our third business is\nthe online Sports bet and I gaming\nbusiness so you know for me we still do\na lot of physical things but there's so\nmany things from the digital world that\nhelp us to be better yeah no but I love\nthat collaboration and thinking about it\nthat way because sometimes the greatest\nvalue to someone is a physical change\nbut you're learning that through the AI\nI still want to wear my Kobe jersey yeah\nexactly exactly I want my Bron card yeah\nthat's the same thing I'm still buying I\nsupport Manchester United that's that's\nmy soccer team and I'm still buying you\nknow soccer jerseys every single year we\nappreciate that because that's a fanatic\nthat's ftic store even though I\nabsolutely even though we absolutely\nsuck right now but uh it's you know but\nthat's what being a Sports Fan's about\nsometimes you're going have the great\nyears and you get you're getting those\nchampionships and other times you're\ngoing to suck and you got to stay with\nyour team you got feel the pain I'm a\nreal fan now I grew up as a glory Hunter\nbecause we just won everything and now\nI'm going through real fandom of 10\nyears we're going to test you now we're\ngoing to see What You're Made Of are you\nreally committed to man united here yeah\nthat's that's I'm being tested right now\nI'm being tested but uh we were talking\nabout people not being entrepreneurship\nnot being Ted when you started when you\nlook at it today now it's become the\ncool sexy interesting f fasinating thing\nfor people to want to try it's not\nnecessarily things people are good at\nlike you said you were it's not\nnecessarily a skill that we honor or\ngive it the the Kudos that it deserves\nwhat are the mistakes people are making\nwhen they think about being an\nentrepreneur today well first of all\nentrepreneurialism isn't for everybody\nbut if you think it's for yourself you\nbetter go out there and try it put your\nbest foot forward you know for me look\nthe biggest mistakes I see people make\nin building a business are kind of a\ncouple common themes one is first you\nhave like are you even going to take the\napp Bat so many people tell me I've got\nthis great idea but like I don't want to\nhear about but like let's go for it\nlet's if you have an idea you want to do\nsomething you know I love the story you\nwere just telling me before we went on\nhere that you came over here and you\nknow you worked one place for six months\nand you're like I want to go out and do\nthis you went out and did it like part\nof being an entrepreneur is to have the\ncourage to fail like you just have to go\nout there and try and by the way when\nyou fail which many times you will\nyou're gonna learn from that failure\nyou're going to grow from that failure\nyou think the best you talked about Kobe\nbeing your favorite you know athlete\nwell guess what how many times did he\nfail and he got better and he pushed\nthrough and so that's what being an\nentrepreneur is so from my perspective\nit's really all about first and foremost\nif you have something you want to do if\nyou believe in it go for it don't worry\nabout whether you succeed or not go out\nand take the swing and if guess what if\nyou strike out if you fail just go back\nagain and I know some people going to\nsay oh well he's really successful now\nso it's easy to say but I got to tell\nyou something I've like I've seen death\nin its eyes you know I've almost gone\nBank up multiple times you know I've had\nepic failures and every one of those led\nme to be better in what I do so that's\nmy first thing second thing I'd say is\nyou need great people around you to\nsucceed like whether it's great people\nyou're learning from that you want to be\na sponge from whether it's you build a\ngreat team to do what you do like I know\nfor Fanatics we have 18,000 people that\nget up and go to bed obsessed with how\ndo we improve The Fan Experience each\nday but like I collect and work with the\nbest people in the planet like if you\ndon't work with great people you will\nfail like you can't win a championship\nif you don't have great talent but\nTalent also works needs to work together\nand then the last thing and this will\nsound corny but like have fun in what\nyou do like I love what I do I have the\ngreatest you know job in the planet I\nget to wake up you know work 18 hours a\nday go to bed thinking about you know\nwhat's next I dream about my work nearly\nevery day like I'm having work dreams\nall the time because I'm obsessed with\nwhat I'm doing it's like it's it's fun\nit's like I should pinch myself it's so\nawesome what I get to do yeah absolutely\nno I I love hearing that and I think you\nknow what's fascinating to me as well\nwith being an entrepreneur you know my\nstory was very different to finding my\nway into entrepreneurship I grew up\nthinking I had to have a steady job cuz\nthat's how I was raised by good Indian\nimmigrant parents who made me\nacademically astute and so I was a\nstraight A student did first class at\nUni like I was always good at that and\nthen I got into a job afterwards after\nmy own detour and when I finally got\ninto a job I was just like this doesn't\nfeel right like this doesn't feel like\nthis is going to use my skills to the\nbest of my ability this doesn't feel\nlike I'm going to propel and do well and\nbecome my best version of myself it\nwasn't about money or what I thought I\ncould win at it was I just don't feel\nthis is going to complete me it or make\nme feel like I'm winning in the way that\nI can listen the most important thing is\nenjoying what you do every day I'm going\nto tell you something I know a lot of\npeople that have been really successful\nfinancially and they're miserable you\nknow what they don't love what they do\nevery day they're not happy like for me\nI don't think about financial success I\nthink about like just loving what I'm\ndoing now financial success can tell you\nare you winning or losing that's your\nreport card that's the scoreboard right\ngood Financial results means you're\nwinning bad financial results means\nyou're not winning in the current moment\nbut for me like I just want to love what\nI do every day I I I can agree with you\nmore I want to wake up and do what I\nlove every day which is why I do this\nbecause I get to sit down with\nFascinating People pick people's minds\nand then we each learn from each other\nabsolutely absolutely and by the way I\nguarantee you I'll learn I'll leave here\ntoday having picked up some things from\nyou and you'll leave from\nhere that's the way it works that's the\nway like we should all be students of\neach other yeah absolutely who's who's\nthe randomst person you've learned from\nI wonder like who's the most curious\nrandom intriguing person that we\nwouldn't expect for you to learn from\nlike not like a business Mogul or a you\nknow someone like that but someone\nyou're like you know what that person I\ndidn't expect to learn from them but I\ndid is there someone like that comes to\nmind I could give you a thousand\nexamples I mean I could tell you when I\nused to be part of the ownership group\nof the Philadelphia Sixers I'd walk\nthrough the arena and I would ask lots\nof Arena workers what's going on here\ntoday you know what's working what's not\nworking like you know you can pick up\nthings from everybody I could I could\nwalk through the street look look at\nwhat someone's wearing and say Hey\nwhere' you buy that is that a good do\nyou like that do you not like that like\nI'm always asking questions so you know\nfor me I I mean that's pretty random if\nyou just walk up in the street ask\nsomebody you know where' you buy that\nwhy' you buy it do you love that what so\nI'm always picking things up I'm\nwatching the way Trends are changing\nwith people I'm probably the most unique\nthing about me is the diversity of\nfriends that I have and I'm learning\nfrom the people around me every single\nday yeah I think that's the only way you\nunderstand the pulse of human behavior\nright it's like asking questions\nwatching patterns I think pattern\nwatching is is an ability whether it's\nan algorithm whether it's the stock\nmarket whether it's you know crypto\nwhatever it is for people watching\npatterns is such an unbelievable skill\nwould you say that's a skill that you've\nhoned and developed and Built Well I\nthink it's a really important skill in\nbusiness because I think it's very\npredictive of the Future Okay so the\nreality is when someone comes in and I'm\ninterviewing a top executive for a roll\none of our businesses and they could\nseem great and then I'm going to go out\nand I'm never going to ask anybody for a\nreference ever I've never asked somebody\nhey can you tell me who to call like\nthat's the you ask me for reference on\nmyself i' call each other people and say\nhey I gave you as a reference make sure\nyou say great things about me right so\nthe reality is I'll interview somebody\nthe first thing I do is if I like them\nas soon as they leave I go out and I\nstart calling people that I knew we had\nin common to recognize patterns okay\nbecause to me 50% is the interview and\n50% is um what I learn behind the scenes\nand that's probably the more important\n50% because someone can blow me away and\nthen you know you'll find out one minute\nthat person sucks that person people\ndon't like working with them or you can\nfind out that person was a little bit\nunderstated but they're a beast you know\nthey've got huge followership um they're\nsuper smart they've got an unrelenting\nwork ethic so to me pattern recognition\nis everything and I use in everything\nthat I do by the way I use pattern\nrecognition when I go play blackjack\nwith my friends you know there's three\ntypes of cards you're going to get cards\nare either going to be you know you're\neither streaking hot you're streaking\ncold or you're kind of in between and\nyou know when you're cold you should not\ndo what sometimes I'll do if I'm\nmisbehaved which is be aggressive when\nyou're cold cuz you you got a pattern\ngoing on so you got to recognize\npatterns in whatever you do I find it\nfascinating how superp powerful\nentrepreneurs hire and fire and recruit\nand you know reward and retain people\nwhat have you found when you're\ninterviewing someone I feel like you\nmust have interviewed so many people\nover the years for huge positions small\npositions in the beginning what are you\nlooking for and how are you finding out\napart from the second part which I love\ncalling up people that you have in\ncommon what are you asking what are you\nlooking for and how are you making sure\nfind it in that very dat likee format so\nlet me say first of all and this will I\nthink shock you I still probably\nspend 10 to 20% of a 70 to 90 Hour Work\nWeek interviewing people okay W so I am\na beast on finding great talent for\nwithin our companies because to me you\ncan't win without great talent so it is\nprobably the thing or one of the things\nI spend the most time on is the Quest\nfor incredible Talent I'm looking for\nfirst does someone have the subject\nmatter expertise and the intellect to be\nsuccessful in what we want them to do\nand then two do they have the leadership\nskills because generally I'm\ninterviewing people that are either\ngoing to work for me or someone who's\ngoing to work for someone who I work\nwith so let's say the top 50 to 100\npeople within our our 18,000 people so\nI'm looking for people that are going to\nbe real leaders um that are going to you\nknow share the same values that we share\nI'm looking for people that can be with\nus for a long period of time like I I\ndon't want people that want to come in\nand be with us for three years I want\npeople that want to like I like people\nwant to be with us and build their\ncareers with us for maybe their entire\nlife you know we want people that are\njust going to be you know and also\npeople that are going to like just\nthey're going to figure out how to win\nthey're going to put it on their\nshoulders and they're going to be\nunrelenting like that's my personality\nlike there are so many things that I\nshould not have succeeded at but I have\nbecause like I won't quit okay and so so\nI think those are some of the things I\njust ramble to you that I care about no\nno no I I love those and I guess the\nthing about not quitting is really\ninteresting right because you've got\nthis unrelenting you can see it in the\nway you speak in your eyes like I've\njust spent a few moments with you we've\nnever met before today and I can fully\nsee that it is just at the core of who\nyou are and you probably find that you\ncan push people and they may not be able\nto go as far every time because they may\nnot have that same energy in them so how\nhave you found that balance of like\nseeing someone who you know has the\npotential you know they the skills but\nit's almost like they're like Michael I\nalready went seven times and you're like\nyeah dude we're going to go 17 because I\nknow at 17 we're going to get there yeah\nI think the people that are in my real\nInner Circle you know I have six key\nExecutives that I work with day in and\nday out the people that run my three\nbusinesses the the online sports betting\nand iig gaming business the Commerce\nbusiness which is merchandise and the\nCollectibles business which is trading\ncards and memorobilia these businesses\nand then my three corporate Executives\nlike they have that same mentality I\nwouldn't want to work with anyone that\ndidn't have that mentality of like you\nknow CU they're saying the culture for\nthe entire 18,000 you know employees at\nFanatics and so to me uh people don't\nshare our core values you know they\ndon't believe in what we believe in\nthere probably not going to be the right\nfit they could be a great human being a\ngreat individual and just not be right\nfor us MH do you ever take a break have\nyou ever taken a break to me I don't\nunderstand work life balance it's just\nit's not who I am so I'm not going to\napologize for it and I know I sound like\npeople get listen this say like this\nguy's you a little bit deranged and but\nI am who I am I know like I know what\nI'm good at and I know what I like doing\nI I mean it may shock you but I fully\nrelate to it like to me it's I you know\nI think people I appreciate I'm trying\nto get more people to you know try\ntrying to get more people to not look at\nme like I'm crazy and and I would agree\nwith I feel exactly the same way like\nthis week and this is my average normal\nweek I I have morning hikes where I'm\nout with people that I work with but I\nlove them and I enjoy their company\nthey're not people I have to work with\nthey're people I enjoy working with so\nI'm having a hike meeting in the morning\nwhich is you know 7:30 a.m. then I'm at\nwork whether I'm doing this or whatever\nI'm up to whether I'm recording\nmeditation so sometimes I'm alone in a\nstudio and sometimes I'm with people and\nthen I have meetings and then I've been\nhaving dinner meetings too and I love it\nI wouldn't have it any other way I've\nhad the best interactions I'm getting to\nknow the best people I know their\nfamilies I know their they're getting to\nknow their kids their spouses whatever\nit is and to me it's like this is what I\nwant life to be I actually don't look at\nlife as work and life like I don't have\nthat disconnect and I actually think\nthat when you look at life as a\ndisconnect that's when you think you're\ntaking away from the other and also\nthink if you do what you love to do yeah\nit almost breaks those barriers down\ntotally yeah no so I'm actually more on\nyour side than people may think uh I'm\nI'm I'm a big fan of having my daily\nroutines and habits that make me the\nbest version of myself like obviously\nmeditation working out there are certain\nnon-negotiables are there things in your\nday that you do that are your routines\nthat may not be those things but things\nthat you're like you know this one thing\nthat I do per day this makes me feel\ngreat it's probably centered around work\nif I'm going to be H honest with you I\nmean I was always pleasantly plump until\nmy joural came out so now that my joural\ncame out I've gone from 210 to 160 I'd\nsay working out is more important to me\nyou know when you're 210 is harder to\nwork out when you're 160s much easier to\nwork out so you live here in uh uh the\ntop of Rion and you know for me you know\nkind of hiking to the top of ran you\nknow I've done that once already this\nweek I'm going to do it again tomorrow\nlike I love doing it like it's a it's a\nblast for me working outs actually\nsomething that is becoming good for me\nbecause it's the one thing that lets me\nget a little bit of a mental break\nputting my phone down sometimes I can be\nso addicted to my phone it's just like I\njust need like sometimes at dinner when\nyou know my family has dinner just like\nput my phone down for 20 minutes that's\na good thing so I'd say things that have\nhelped me of late have been you know\ngetting those three to four workouts in\nper week because it does give me some\nmental Clarity I'd say putting my phone\ndown 20 or 30 minutes a day when just\nnot going to look at and say okay like\ngive me a mental break cuz I think you\ncould just become so obsessed that it's\nalmost it's bad for you and then you\nbecome less effective yeah um probably\nthe biggest routine I have if we say\nlike let's keep it real it's going to be\nthe people that I I work close with it's\ntalking to them all the time I'm always\njust like peeling the lyus back on what\nwe're doing so like any of my you know\ntop leaders I'm on the phone with on\nzooms with meeting with imp person all\nthe time because that's the way we're\njust like building the best business\nyeah absolutely and I I I do believe\nthat it's it's what it takes for the\nlevel of success that you've achieved I\nwonder you know if you if you Google\nyour net worth it says 11 billion could\nbe more probably is how do you define\nhow much you're worth I don't I'll tell\nyou a story I probably shouldn't say God\nthis is blowing somebody up I shouldn't\nblow up like forbs reached out and they\nsaid hey we want to put you on the cover\nof Forbes um for the Forbes 400 I'm like\nno I don't want to be known for my net\nworth I want to be known for building a\ngreat company by the way there's so many\nthings with a company that we suck at\nthat we need to be better at like I want\nto be like the way I look at it is I'm a\nbig startup and I want to make sure that\nI'm always fighting to be better in\neverything we do and in everything we do\nI want to build what what we make better\nfor the fan and we have so much to do to\naccomplish that so I don't want to be\nknown about money I don't want to be\nknown I want to be known about making\nthe world a better place or making my\ncompany better those are honestly you\nknow the two things I'm maniacally\nfocused on yeah I believe it I believe\nit I I genuinely do and and I think by\nway who can't like I'm not in a\ncompetition for like tot it's irrelevant\nlike my life is not changing financially\nbased on anything that happens going\nforward you know I'm fortunate that I'm\nin a nice position today so like to me\nthe thing that gets me most exciting is\nwinning in business cuz that's my sport\nthat's what I'm good at and so I look at\neach business and I look at not all the\nthings we do right I look at all the\nthings we do wrong and all the things we\ncan be better at and so I'm always\nsaying how can we improve in everything\nwe do because guess what there are a lot\nof things we need to be a lot better at\nand that's what I'm focused on and then\nyou know upfront you talked about kind\nof giving back is interesting I never\never cared about making a difference in\nthe world until I had an event in in\n2017 that that changed my perspective\nbefore that I would just always write\nchecks you came and said hey I'm doing\nthis hey let me give you a check to shut\nyou up as quickly as I could because I\ndidn't care I just want to focus on work\nand then my eyes got open which is what\npeople always say like hey should I be\nbehind this I said do what's authentic\ndo what's real and you know for me\nthat's kind of how my life is kind of\nyou know evolved yeah and why was it I\nbelieve it was Meek Mill who introduced\nyou to criminal justice it wasn't I mean\neveryone knows the story at this point\nyou know you know me got um you know\nsent to prison for 2 to four years for\npopping a wheelie on a motorcycle he the\nsmartest thing he did for both of us was\nsay hey can you come to court with me\nthat day I want you to see what happens\nwhen a black person goes to court I\ndidn't like even understand what he was\nsaying and then you know I watched him\nget sent to prison for two to four years\nfor not committing a crime uh for\npopping a whe on a motorcycle like that\nwas the most uncomfortable thing that's\never happened to my body because it was\nlike I'm used to being in control I'm a\nstrong business leader I'm used to\nLeading and now I had a judge who who\nsent him to prison for 2 to 4 years for\nnot committing a crime for popping a\nwheel on a motorcycle and it was like\nthe most out of body experience I ever\nhad and so once he ultimately got out of\nprison and we started the reform\nAlliance you know for me you know I\nlearned a really valuable lesson because\na lot of people told me don't get\ninvolved with this don't get involved\nwith him you're going to hurt your\nbusiness you're going to hurt the Sixers\nand I just went with my instincts which\nis like this my brother and like he\nneeds help and by the way Jay-Z and Des\npres from from Rock Nation stepped up in\na huge way like you know it was It was\nkind of us collectively but like\nI've had a couple experiences in the\nlast four or five years where we've done\nthings where people told us would be bad\nfor business bad for us and we didn't\ncare we do what we thought was the right\nthing you always get paid back in karma\nlike that is something I've learned in\nthe last five years probably the biggest\nthing I've learned in the last five\nyears you know don't worry about what\npeople tell you is going to be that the\nright outome you do what you think is\nright if you do what's right you know it\ngenerally works out yeah know and and\nI'm glad you repeat that story there may\nbe some of our audience who may or may\nnot be aware so thank you for sharing\nthat but and I wanted them to hear it\nfrom you because it it is it's so\ninteresting when something becomes so\npersonal when it happens to someone\nthat's so close to you the issue almost\nbecomes so much more relatable and easy\nto access for you what have been some of\nthe most like I loved what you said like\nthe moment you walked in here I was\ntelling you how much I've appreciated\nthe impact work you're doing and you're\nlike we're not doing it fast enough\nwe're not there's more to do you know\nand I love that like that's exactly the\nenergy you need to have so walk me\nthrough the winds that have been there\nthat have shown you that you're doing\nthe right thing and then walk me through\nwhat are the issues that you're still\ntrying to solve and figure out well look\nthe interesting thing was when Meek got\nsent to\nprison in November\n2017 just about everybody I knew said do\nnot get involved in this this will\nreflect poorly in the Sixers this will\nreflect poorly on Fanatics less people\nwill buy tickets and and they're going\nto see you helping a criminal and so da\nPerez from Rock Nation myself you know\nwe spent a lot of the next six months\nyou know working every day to get him\nout of prison and once we got him out of\nprison you know Meek said to me and I\nsaid to Meek like look this is Destiny\nman you got sent to prison because you\nwere the one anointed to to help fix the\nsystem and I would if you would have\nasked me before November 12th 2017 when\nhe got sent to prison if you would have\nsaid to me what do I care about from a\ncharity perspective it was writing\nchecks to get people out of my office as\nquickly as possible I did not care about\nany issues but what Meek used to always\nsay to me Michael this is a normal day\nfor black America and so you know that\nhe had been sent to prison for a\ntechnical probation violation it was\neasy for us to say we have to change the\nprobation and parole system that's what\nwe set out to do the interesting thing\nwas uh when we finally decided to do\nthis which was I guess finally when we\ndid it immediately I was trying to\nfigure out how to come up with a goal\nbecause to me you have to come up with\nbig bold goals and this this speaks to\nentrepreneurialism and not taking a kind\nof charitable approach to things I asked\na friend of mine who I don't want to\nname but someone I have huge respect for\nI said you know how many people should\nwe try to get out of probation Pro they\nsaid well how many people in the system\nI said 4 a. half million they said well\ngo with 10,000 that's a really safe\nnumber I said 10,000 let's go for a\nmillion so we're in this less than 5\nyears we've passed 17 bills in 11 states\nand created a pathway for 700,000 people\nto get off of Probation and Parole who\nshouldn't be on it and by the way um\nthere were 4 and a half million people\non probation Pro when we started there's\n3.8 million people 10 what's proven this\nis really important to understand if you\nkeep someone on probation or parole too\nlong you entrap them in the criminal\njustice system and then what you do is\nyou actually create a less safe outcome\nfor neighborhoods and for environments\nversus if people serve their time have\nthe appropriate amount of Rehabilitation\nyou know they're on probation burrow for\nthe right amount of time then they're\ngoing to go out they're going to make\nyou know a positive impact in the world\nso Meek had been on probation between\nthe time served and time left 18 years\nnow in California where we're doing this\ntoday the governor assed it in one of\nthe first bills that we did with with\nGavin new which was amazing is a\none-year cap on misdemeanor and a\ntwo-year cap on felonies and that was\nlike Breakthrough legislation that we\nworked on together you know with many\npeople to bring together to make that\nhappen in the state of California was\none of the best things we've done at the\nreform line so my point is like that's\nhuge we turned this negative into a\npositive we then came up with a really\nbold goal that people thought we were\nnut when I told people a million people\nlike everyone looked at me like I have\nseven heads but I'm like what's the\nworse that happens like so we get\n300,000 people 400,000 people I'll still\nthink we won I don't care you want to\nsay we fail cuz we didn't get the\nmillion and by the way now we're going\nto we're going to surpass the million I\nthink wow that's incredible and you're\nso right most of us when we set a bold\ngoal whether it's to make an impact or\nwhether it's in business we're actually\njust worrying about what everyone will\nthink if we don't hit that goal so I'm\ngoing to give you a great example so um\ntoday at Fanatics um you know we've\nbuilt a pretty big business in our\nCommerce business which is merchandise\nthat's where I started that's where a\nlot of people know us from by the way we\nstill have so much to do to be better so\nmany things to improve the consumer\nexperience to innovate more product\nwe're a leader in that business in the\nCollectibles business we're a real\nleader today in the online Sports bet\nand I gaming business we're just\nstarting okay we're going to be um\nfnatic sports book just launched earlier\nthis year will be basically in just\nabout every legal state by the end of\nthis year under the Fanatics brand with\nwith one wallet I woke up and our guys\nwe talk about being number three like\nyou know hey fanduel's number one\nDraftKings number two uh we're number\nthree and you know sorry we we aspired\nto be number three today we're like\nnumber eight we're just started and I\nwoke up about 3 weeks ago and I called\nour coo Mt H who's amazing I said Matt\nlike we got our goal needs to be number\none by way maybe we'll accomplish it\nmaybe we won't maybe we won't be\nsuccessful at all like the jury's out\nwe're investing a billion and a half\ndollars to try to be the top player okay\nbut like I don't want to play for number\nthree number three is a loser I want to\nplay for number one and so many people\ngoing to say to me so many people\nlistening to this would be like wait you\nwant to be number one to Fan doing\nDraftKings in online Sports bet and I\ngaming I'm declaring right now it's the\nfirst time I public say this I want to\nbe number one I have no idea whether I\nhave any chance of that accomplishing\nbut I can tell you what I'm not waking\nup to try to be number three that's a\nloser and that's what's got you here so\nyou feel convinced that that's what it\nwas what was the do you remember the\nfirst Go Big Goal you ever set I do yeah\nin 2009 I made a goal I said to all of\nour uh Team I said that I want to build\nwe were $250 million in Revenue 2010 I\nsaid one day we could be a billion\ndollars in Revenue that division is $6\nbillion today okay I said one day we\ncould be a billion dollars okay then\nfour years later you said one day we\ncould be $5 billion okay and we're only\njust trying to come up with goals for\njust like to try to measure you know\nsuccess or failure but I love come up\nwith B goals and I don't care whether I\naccomplish them or fail I care about\ncoming up with both goals to work\nagainst and then making huge progress\nagainst them whether I accomplish them\nor not yeah the point is you're more\nlikely to challenge yourself enough to\ncome up with better strategies more\nproducts better customer service like\nyou're actually just going to improve\ndrastically towards that level if you\nset goals that are easy to accomplish\nthen you're actually saying you want to\nfail to start with if you come up with\nbold goals and by it's easier look I\nknow people going to say I'm an owner\nit's easier to say that as an owner okay\nand maybe sometimes you just need to set\ngoals up that you say to yourself\nbecause you don't want to tell your boss\nthat goals okay or you tell your boss\nhere's the budgeting goal I'm giving you\nbut now let me tell you the real goal\nthat I have okay and so I like rallying\npeople against big audacious you know\nhard to achieve goals because I think\nyou're just going to accomplish more\nyeah absolutely how does how does this\nenergy convert over to Michael's love\nlife like how does this kind of how does\nhow does Michael in love change from\nMichael I mean you have to ask Camille\nthat um I think what Camille would say\nis she's incredibly supportive of what I\ndo she knows it's what I love doing you\nknow she's the most incredible mother on\nthe planet we have uh so I have a\n17-year- old daughter then I have a\nthree-year-old and Oney old with Camille\nyou know she puts as much energy as I\nput into work she puts into being a mom\nand I think that's what makes makes us\ngreat together would I say that you know\nI'm always the most available person no\ndoes she want to you know kill me\nmultiple times a week probably yes but\nshe also knows this what makes me mean\nand what I love to do and you know she\nloves being the greatest mom in the\nworld we have a great relationship but\nyou know would you call my personal life\nor our personal life perfect definitely\nnot cuz I work like an animal no of\ncourse not of course not no no one has\nthe perfect personal or professional\nlife but did you the reason why I ask is\nyou know it's really interesting I I\nalways feel like you know so much can be\nsolved at the point of connection what I\nmean by that is I you know my wife's a\nbusy person I'm a busy person but I've\nyou know I was saying to some of my team\nthe other day I'm really grateful that\nmy wife has never said to me in the last\n10 years that we've been together you\ndon't spend enough time with me uh it's\nbecause she knows who I am she\nunderstands how I work she knows I make\ntime I am present when I'm there but she\ngets me like she she really gets me and\nshe got me when we got together yes I\nwas very not successful when we met but\nshe gets me and she's seen that energy\ngrow and so she loves the time and by\nthe way I don't say the same to her\neither she never hears from me like you\ndon't spend enough time with me or\nyou're not around if she's busy and she\nhas to move did you know that when you\nmet Camille how did you set that up how\ndid that become real how did she get to\nknow you that well because I feel like\nfor a lot of people the way you work the\nway I work the way certain people work\nit would be unbearable and it would be a\ndeal breaker but then it's really hard\nto also have an amazing life and and\nbuild everything you want to build right\nit's so how how did you I'm just\nintrigued as to how you had that\nconversation early days yeah I'm not\nsure if we had the conversation it kind\nof just grew into what it is I think the\nsame thing for Camille or my older\ndaughter Kylie they would both say they\nwish that I were more available more\npresent but they also respect and learn\nfrom my work ethic and what I do and I\nthink you know it kind of works itself\nout in the end but you know different\nthan you um I do hear from both camir\nand Kylie you know you don't have enough\ntime for me you're not available enough\nand sometimes that's a really good prob\nlike okay you know what put your phone\ndown and turn the ringer off for half an\nhour you know you don't always need to\ngrab every call you know what what what\nmy older daughter would always say to me\nKylie is like Dad it's always somebody\nimportant I'm your oldest daughter and\ncamil would say to me you know it's me\nlike just let it go for a little bit so\nthey actually help me whatever little\nbalance I have I think I get from\nCamille and Kylie I loved what you said\nlike you know sometimes they say I need\nmore time but they also respect me how\ndo\nyou reconcile that kind of dad guilt\nthat could come with that or and a lot\nof I'm not a father yet but a lot of my\nfriends who are they'll say it's so\npainful watching your little girl my my\nfriends who have little girls will say\nit's so painful watching your little\ngirls say Daddy just stay at home with\nme today right like how are you how do\nyou reconcile like this is good for them\nto see me work hard and I know when to\nlike put my phone down but how do you\nhow do you make sense with that yeah\nwell the good thing is my three-year-old\nand one-year-old have grown up with me\nlike this so and so did Kylie by the way\nso they've all seen that work ethic look\nKylie as everyone knows my 17-year-old\nis with me you know all the time she\ntravels with me all the time she's\nactually on a plan right now she's about\nto land here in a few hours so you know\nyou know she's with me a lot she's got a\ngreat you know Kylie and Camille have a\ngreat relationship they may have a\nsupport group you know together for the\ntwo of them against me um every family's\ndifferent every person's different\neveryone needs to do what works for them\nand I think I do what works for me and\nthey do what works for them and I think\nthey appreciate it I also know to be\nthere when it really matters and so for\nme Kylie went through an experience\nearlier this year and she called me and\nit had to do with college she's like\ncursing me I just like like I need you\nto help me figure this out right now and\nit's was about like get cuz Kylie's much\nsmarter than me but she's not like you\nknow she goes to the toughest School in\nPhiladelphia and she like she wanted\nlike some help with certain things and\nlike I had to call around and figure out\nhow to do that and learn and peel the\nlayers back and ultimately figured out\ntogether so like when it really matters\nlike I'm always there and I'm good at\nfiguring out what matters and what\ndoesn't and so I think that could be a\nsuperpow have which is how to prioritize\nI am good at figuring out when am I\nreally needed when do I need to like you\nknow lock in and focus it could be lock\nand focus on a really important business\ndeal or could be locking and focus on a\nreally important moment for Camille or\nfor Kylie yeah what what what your\ndaughters do for you my sister does for\nme She'll always be like stop being J\nshete just be my brother like you know\nit's like that feeling of like stop\ngiving me that advice just be my brother\nand like give me I I get that from both\nof them all the time my three-year-old\nRomy will I'm sure be giving me that\nlike within a year or two and it's the\nbest feeling right it's such it's such a\nbeautiful feeling because you know\nsomeone loves you and wants you to just\nbe there for them it's getting those\nmoments which you can really appreciate\nso you know I try try to get him when I\ncan yeah and Michael that's what I'm\ntrying to do on this podcast here you\nknow I don't have a I don't think there\nis an ideal way to live I don't think\nthere is a perfect way to approach your\nproblems I think that what I like to do\nis I like to introduce people this is\nkind of my whole hypothesis in life if I\ncan introduce people to as many diverse\npeople as possible that have all in\ntheir own way found purpose impact and\nsuccess then people actually have a\nchance of saying I like what they're\nsaying I'm going to run with that or\nactually you know what I never thought\nabout it like that because I find when I\nwas growing up we were all exposed to\nthe same set of people and the same set\nof ideas and it was so hard to break\nthat and it was only for me obviously\nwhich is my personal Journey when I met\na monk at 18 I didn't know what monks\nwere I didn't care what monks were I had\nno interest in anything spiritual if I\nhad never met a monk I would never have\ngone down the path of life I did and so\nI'm always asking people who's your monk\nand for some people their monk will be\nyou and what I mean by that is they're\ngoing to get introduced to you and go\nyeah that's that's how I want to live my\nlife that that resonates with me doesn't\nthat make sense it makes complete sense\nthat I'm a huge believer in it and I\nhave look if you'd say what's the most\nunique thing about me it's probably the\ndiversification of the people around me\nand I think I've built that because it's\nright for me because I'm learning from\nall these people around me and so I've\ngot this person actually it's a uh\nperson who owns a a local hobby shop and\nhe keeps um sending me these really long\ntext messages and I actually keep mean\nand send back a voice not you say hey\nman I actually appreciate your input but\nI don't I barely read like I'm not that\nliterate like you're you're laughing I'm\ndead serious like I haven't read a book\nsince nth grade the last book I read was\nin ninth grade I read the swish the\nstory about the unauthorized story about\nPhil the last time I read a book okay so\nI'm not a good reader I'm pretty\ndyslexic okay so like the way I learn is\nby like quick conversations you know you\nwant me to read something send me three\nlines and I'm actually going to read it\nyou send me three paragraphs I'm already\nI'm tuned out before I start um so it's\nlike that's why I'm saying got to learn\nfrom each other what works for each\nother and that's you know what makes me\nme absolutely Michael you've been\namazing we end every episode with a\nfinal five you'll like this each\nquestion has to be answered in one word\nto one sentence maximum so it goes\naligned with what you just said so\nMichael ruin these are your final five\nquestion one is what is the best\nentrepreneurship advice you've ever\nheard or received don't be afraid to\nfail because cuz if you're afraid to\nfail you're never going to take the shot\nlike how do you want to be an\nentrepreneur you're sitting there and\nyou're trying to figure out like should\nI do this or not like you got to go for\nit second question what is the worst\nentrepreneurship advice you've ever\nheard or received do it for the money\nall right question number three what's\nsomething you're currently trying to\nlearn maybe in business or in life\nsomething you're working on how do to do\nwhat's best for the consumer in\neverything that we do like just complete\nconsumer Focus I didn't grow up as a\ncomplete consumer person so I think\nthere's things of I look at parts of\nFanatics where we're not good enough we\nhaven't been good enough I'd say it's an\nobsession with the consumer yeah that's\nI always loved about I still love it\ntoday like when I grew up I remember the\nfirst time my parents took me to Disney\nWorld and I was just like everything\nabout this place is like perfectly\norganized for me to have the best time\nof my life yeah and it's it's insane how\nmuch detail you can put into someone's\nexperience yeah I think we we got our\nbusiness model right everything I do has\nto be about the consumer to win in a\nconsumer business it has to be about\nconsumer first and everything you do\nthat's something that I've that I'm\nreally it's the biggest thing I'm\nfocused on right now yeah I love that\nthat's beautiful all right question\nnumber four how would you define your\ncurrent Purpose with your impact work uh\nreal change like to make real change not\nlike like so many people who make impact\nwork they write first of all writing a\ncheck is easy okay if you have money\nright in check is easy like don't think\nbecause you give money away that you're\nmaking a difference like go do the work\nokay but making real change like measure\nthe results treat it like a business not\nlike you know a charity like we don't\nwant to run the reform Alliance like a\ncharity we run around like business we\nwant business results beautiful uh Fifth\nand final question we ask this to every\nguest who's ever been on the show if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\ncouldn't be president after 65 I want\nthe president of the United States to be\nan animal from a work ethic perspective\nI want them to be on their aame I want\nto make sure that they're maniacal about\nthe country the way I'm maniacal about\nmy business one law to go in place Max\nyou can't be elected to become president\nafter 65 years old Michael Rubin\neveryone if you've been listening and\nwatching make sure that you cut the the\nclips for Tik Tok and Instagram that\nrelated to you insights that you loved\nshare them I love knowing what are the\nlessons you're taking away what are you\npracticing what are you implementing and\nputting into your life I think everyone\njust got the best pep talk that they\nneed for right now in their life this is\ngoing to get you to those big goals\nlisten to this episode share it with\nyour friends share it with your family\nI'm sure someone just needs a train to\ncome run through their mind and break\nthrough all of the barriers that they've\nset up I think Michael's that train uh\nMichael thank you so much oh by the way\ndisagree with us tell me tell me you\ndon't agree I I love when you disagree\nwith me too yeah yeah totally of course\nif you disagree with us you can tell us\ntoo you'll do that anyway I don't need\nto ask for that hey thanks for having me\nit was a bless thank you Michael such a\nblessed I appreciate you man and thank\nyou for being so what I appreciate about\nyou is your Clarity your commitment to\nthat Clarity and that you're still open\nand available to learn I think that\nCuriosity that's what I see in you it's\nlike complete Clarity complete\ncommitment to who you are and then still\nbeing curious that's a deadly\ncombination so thank you well well said\nand I'm going to try to preach it and do\nit every day thank you man thank you if\nyou love this episode you'll love my\ninterview with Kobe Bryant on how to be\nstrategic and obsessive to find your\npurpose our children have become less\nimaginative about how to problem solve\nand parents and coaches have become more\ndirective and trying to tell them how to\nbehave versus teaching them how to\nbehave"
