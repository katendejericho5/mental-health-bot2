to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett externally you've had what looks\nlike a LoveHate relationship with tennis\nand at this this point you're injured\nyou've been away from the game I'm\nintrigued to understand how is your\nrelationship with the game changed when\nyou haven't been able to play it this is\na tough one for me cuz when I step away\nfrom the sport for so long I actually\ndon't miss it so that's scary for me you\nknow most athletes when they get pulled\naway from their sport injury or take\ntime off they're like really hungry to\nget back with me it's like I've always\nkind of known that life has so many so\nmany cool things about it with you know\nand Tennis you when we're traveling s\neight months a year I barely see my\nfamily my friends and during this time\nit's like I get to see spend time with\nmy partner more my family do all these\nthings that I've been missing out on\nit's like wow this my life's amazing now\nbut you know I do miss playing tennis a\nbit you it's all I've ever known since I\nwas seven years old you know my family\nloves it you know all my friends you\nknow know me as Nick Kos tennis player\nso I do miss it a little bit but at the\nsame time I've I've really enjoyed the\ntime off yeah I'm glad to hear that it's\ngood to good for the honesty I think you\nknow like people people forget that\nwe're human and we need a break\nsometimes what's your earliest childhood\nmemory that you think has defined who\nyou are\ntoday well I hated tennis when I was\nyoung so you know I was very chubby\noverweight as a kid and my mom kind of\nshe was like okay we got to get you\ndoing some some some sport or be active\nso she dragged me down to the local\ntennis courts and I remember I was\ncrying all day hated it didn't want to\nbe there anyway I gave it a chance for\nlike you know a couple weeks couple\nmonths and the coach was like oh he's\npicking it up pretty quickly and then\nthat was I guess that was a defining\nmoment because ever since coach said\nthat it's like my father and my mom put\neverything into tennis you know they\nsacrificed you know my dad and my mom\nhad nothing growing up and I guess they\nkind of saw me as the person in the\nfamily to to eventually you know try and\nmake it and help and help them out and\nhelp the family out so look tennis was\nit was such a interesting Journey you\nknow I never thought I was 17 18 still\nin school and people were telling me you\ncould really do something and I never\ntook myself seriously enough to one day\nbe on the tour beating people like jovic\nfed it was just never in my mind and\nthen all of a sudden it just happened\nand my life changed it's like I have big\nimposter syndrome like I'm sitting here\nI watch you my bed in my house and\nCamera I'm watching you and then now all\nof a sudden I'm here having a\nconversation like that's just for me\nit's crazy well dude I feel the same\nwith you I'm watching you play all the\nmajor tournaments and watching you on\nbreakpoint and I still have to pinch\nmyself that I get to do this so the\nfeeling is very mutual and I want you to\nknow that too like and and you know a\nbig part of that for me watching you is\nI think and I chose not to introduce you\nthis way but I think a lot of people\nwould introduce you as the bad boy of\ntennis how does that title make you feel\ntoday yeah it's been hard that's one\nthing the media's done they've branded\nme as you\nknow I don't know like I'm I'm crazy I'm\na bad boy but my family and my closest\npeople know that I'm quite generous I'm\nquite caring I'm intellectually switched\non I like having deep conversations and\nI I try my best to make other people\npeople feel comfortable like I know what\nit's like to be overweight insecure like\nI I love when I see kids that are a bit\nlike I guess myself at a younger age I\nlove that I go up to them I make them\nfeel look if I can do it you can do it\nso that's been one of the hardest things\nin my career is like everyone I meet\nthinks that I'm just a you know a bad\nperson I've got crazy Tempo but then off\nthe court I'm it's like a complete\nopposite person and it's been really\nreally hard to shake that and it's taken\nyears like only now I feel like people\nkind of understand how I am on the court\nand how I am off the but it's been it's\nbeen hard how early did that title set\nin like that idea of Nick Kos meltdown\nagain Nick curios break breaks a racket\nlike whatever like how early did that\nset in and how did that impact it um\nprobably the first couple years I was on\ntour um and that was almost 11 years ago\nand it's been an uphill battle ever\nsince you know everyone thinks that I'm\nthat type of person but it's like I've\ngone through my whole life trying to\nprove to people that that's not me and\nit's it's been really hard like all the\nmedia backlash the negativity all the\nnegativity on my family my partner like\nit's not it hasn't been so easy to\nnavigate um but I think getting older\nand growing through it and getting thick\nskin I've kind of given up trying to you\nknow make everyone understand who I am\ncuz it's exhausting and it's I don't\nthink it's possible everyone's going to\nhave their opinions but it's taken a\ntoll like I'm definitely a bit tired of\nbeing branded that and it's sad in a way\nbecause people only really want to get\nto meet me to meet that side of me which\nis not how I actually am as a person how\nmuch of it early on was self-inflicted\nversus was that just you trying to deal\nwith the pressure and the stress like\nwhy did that I've so I've met you just\nnow yeah you're smiling you're easy to\nbe around you're chill you're cool when\nwe were messaging I was telling my team\nI was this guy seems like one of the\nnicest guys like s everything you just\nsaid yeah but then when someone watches\nyou on the court or watches you in a\npress interview you could be\nintimidating\nhow much of that became a Persona you\nfelt you ended up playing versus where\ndid it actually start was it that you\nwere stressed and there was pressure or\nwell I guess yeah when I'm on court I\nturn into a different person like I love\ncompeting and it's like I hate losing\nand I guess when I even when I was a\nyounger kind of kid on the court I\nalways carried my emotions I would cry\non court I would scream I would just I'd\nlove to compete and hate to lose and I\nguess I never changed like whether it's\nme now I don't cry on court now but I\nstill am very emotional and I just it\njust shows how much I care I feel like\nit was a way for me to outlet the\npressure you know get angry or smash a\nracket but the thing is tennis can go\nfor four or five hours the match go for\nfour or five hours and then for that\nsmall snippet of time 20 seconds 30\nseconds I'm losing my losing my mind and\nthat's all they're showing like if you\njust show 30 minutes of a 4H hour match\nthen everyone's going to assume oh\nthat's how he's carrying on for 4 hours\nlike the majority of the time I'm well\nbehaved great competitor respecting my\nopponent and then I look I turn on you\nknow say the TV it's just me smashing\nthe rack and I'm like I can't control\nthat and it's been it's been hard like\nmost of the time I am how I am now but\nit's it's been a tough one yeah you were\nsaying I've I've watched how you talked\nabout how it's impacted you it's\nimpacted how people communicate with\nyour girlfriend like the kind of\nbacklash that you receive Y what has\nbeen the the darkest hardest period of\ndealing with that whether it may be a\nmedia narrative or uh fans reaching out\nwhatever it may be yeah in 2019 was I've\nopened up about the some of the darkest\nperiods of my life and I just it was so\naccessible all these negative comments\nyou know you go on your phone now you\nopen up social media Instagram Twitter\nall this and I just see millions of\nmessages that were negative negative\nabout my family like just things that I\nfeel like I didn't never really listen\nlisten to but they just went into the\nback of my mind and subconsciously\nthey're just there and then when things\nstart happening you're like maybe\nthey're right you start doubting\nyourself and I feel like that's what I\nfell into it was like oh maybe they are\nright and then I started feeling really\nnegatively about myself and I started\nall these bad habits happening and it\nwas it was impossible for me to deal\nwith I was 19 at the time when this all\nstarted happening and I wasn't prepared\nfor such a I guess such a hard time like\nI was just enjoying myself I had normal\nfriends and then I went from being in\nschool to now being on the global stage\nin the spotlight and it was just\nimpossible for me to deal with I never\nreally dealt with it uh in a healthy way\nat all yeah you talked about in\nbreakpoint about drugs alcohol\nisolating yourself you talk about even\nconsidering attempting suicide and then\nwe hear that you locked into a psych\nwood but we don't really realize what\nyou went through like walk us through\nwhat it felt like to be nickos in 2019\nit's just the I think about those times\nand I don't necessarily feel sad about\nhim or happy about him it's just like\nthat part of my life is over and it's\njust a mess like I think about that time\nI just was not thinking clearly I was\ndrinking every night you know just at\nthe at the time I thought it was just\nfun but it wasn't fun it was just\nself-inflicted pain and I was had\nfriends around me telling me it wasn't\nhealthy and I ignored them and then I\nfound myself going to a Psy psychiatric\nward in London and I had to play an\nadult the next day and these are the\nthings like everyone would assume that I\nwas doing fine I was answering questions\nand they told me that I should stay in\nthis psychiatric ward for two weeks and\nbe re reassessed and I was playing at\ndoll the next day it's like I I looked\nat myself I was like I I can't do this I\nhave to somehow change these habits so\nand I had self harm everywhere I had to\nwear an arm sleeve on on Center quar\nwimon and no one knew any of these\nproblems and it was it was hard and I\nlook back and I just don't know how I ne\nlike got out of it to be honest I was\nsuch a mess and the worst thing was the\nmedia I was having decent results during\nthat time and the media was like okay is\nthis a new Nikos is this the Nikos and I\nwas like this is the darkest period of\nmy life there was a tournament in Mexico\nkco where I was thinking about I was\nhaving suicidal thoughts and you know I\nwas just on the balcony of my hotel and\nI was genuinely thinking about it and my\nteam was like all right we got to play\nin 10 minutes ended up going out on\ncourt played amazing won the tournament\nand everyone globally was thinking wow\nis this the person that we've all been\nwaiting for when I was really on the\nbrink of of everything and that's so\nscary cuz no one else knew what was\ngoing on it was really hard I mean that\nParadox of feeling that way and then\nhaving to play\nthe biggest games and then even winning\nsome of them but then feeling that way\nwhen you're off court again that sounds\nlike one of the most\ndifficult like just just listening to\nyou right now I'm listening to that\ngoing I was just putting myself in that\nposition thinking you're sitting\nstanding there at the balcony like I\ncan't imagine what's going through your\nmind how did you break through that like\nhow did how was that not the end because\nI feel there's so many people listening\nright now who might be feeling like you\nwere then and I want you to talk talk to\nthem I want them to hear you right now\nbecause I want this to be the message\nthat they say that got me through it um\nit just everyone I felt like I was very\nselfish at that time was I was always\ngiving into my feelings which weren they\nwere probably valid but I felt like I\nwas playing Just based on how I felt and\nthen I looked back at millions of fans\nthat I have and that I you know for\ninstance there was a make A- wish kid\nthat I met up with a week and a half ago\nhe's probably got 6 months to live and\nthen I realized that those types of\npeople that look up to me and really\nwant me to succeed that's who I started\nplaying for so family these like kids\nthe the future generation that's the\nreason why I probably would have retired\nand probably stopped playing you know a\ncouple years ago if if I just kept\nplaying on how I was feeling but then I\nrealized I've got a whole contingent of\nfans of why that want to see me succeed\nso that's why I love playing now like I\nplay for them but that's what got me out\nof it I started feeling like I got a lot\nmore to give not not for me like I've\nalready proved myself that I can play\ntennis but for all those people out\nthere like if I can do it like you look\nat jovic federan a doll like these\npeople are gods in my eyes like they're\nsuper professional jovic takes care of\nhis diet daily I was not doing any of\nthese things and still getting to that\nlevel so I think if just the inspiration\nfor other people got me out of that but\nit was really those times are you there\nare definitely times now where I think\nabout those moments and I'm I get I\nstill get a bit emotional on it like\nbreako obviously showed interviews with\nmy my sister and my father my best\nfriend they break down into tears and\nthat just shows how emotional that time\nwas cuz they could just see me spiraling\nout of control and I I hadn't I didn't\nthink it was okay to just step back and\nnot play I I kept thinking I had to\nforce myself to get out there yeah it\ndefinitely was traumatizing how much did\nit mean to you that they stood by you\nyeah I mean I probably owe them my life\nto be honest you know they were standing\nby me\nthrough Reckless Behavior and that's\nwhat I'm everything that's what I mean\nlike people now I go on social media and\nthey're like oh you're a waste of talent\nor why are you not playing or why you\nnot doing this and I'm everything I'm\ndoing now is just a bonus like being\nhere speaking to Jay shedy for me it's\njust that's like a it's like all a bonus\nlike every day I I just don't think\nabout the past I don't think about the\nfuture I just live every day day by day\nand I just everything I'm doing now is\njust a bonus like cuz I was so so\ndepressed and so sad and like I\nliterally wanted to end my life and now\njust I'm just here and enjoying it so\nyeah everything's just\nit's all a bonus yeah that's a beautiful\nway to live yeah it is to know that yeah\nit's a beautiful mindset to live in just\nstay I just stay on my feet I don't\nthink about the past or I don't I'm not\na big planner anymore because I just\ndon't know anything can be taken away\njust like that yeah I mean I think\nlistening to you it's so interesting\nright when we have views on athletes\nespecially where we're like oh you could\nhave been this and you could have been\nthe next greatest and you could have\nbeen whatever it may be and and the\nchallenge is you have no idea what that\nperson's going through you have no idea\nwhat's worrying that person and I think\neveryone almost\nprojects their own insecurities onto\neveryone else where we also feel like we\nhave so much potential that never got\nseen that never got untapped and to\nalmost live in the way you're living now\nwhich is like I'm already living in\nbonus land yeah I mean I I feel like\nthat in so many ways in my life\nwhere I am able to do things today that\nI couldn't even have imagined as a kid\nand we can actually we have a lot in\ncommon growing up because I was and I\nheard you say this and I felt the same\nway I was the I was a short brown fat\nkid growing up at school and so when you\ntalked about that in breakpoint I felt\nexactly the same way where I was bullied\nfor it I was beaten up for it I was\ncriticized for it and when I look at my\nlife today I'm like I get to do things\nthat I didn't ever think were possible\nso I'm already living in bonus world and\nyou're so grateful for it so grateful\nfor it so grateful for it Beyond and\nwhether I reach the potential what\npeople think I should do or whether I\ndon't I'm already living in that\ngratitude with you when you're playing\nat the top level and there is that\nfeeling so when you find out you're\ngoing to make it you've made it through\nto the final of Wimbledon y walk me\nthrough what the feeling is when you\nknow like I've made it through to the\nfinal of Wimbledon like which is the\nbiggest stage the biggest moment you\nmade it through what does that feel like\nI was laughing inside like I was I had\nNovak jovic behind me the royal family\nwatching me play and there's like Gods\nthere and I'm just like thinking to\nmyself I I don't this shouldn't be me\nlike the way that everything had panned\nout it was like I just thought it was\nall a joke I was like this is incredible\nhow how am I here in this moment in time\nand yeah I was I was walking out to the\ncourt and I just yeah like it's like\nevery single thing that I'd gone through\ntraining family sacrifice it all that's\nthe one time in my life where everything\nmade sense everything made sense every\ngym session conditioning session every\ngood meal I decided to eat was all equal\nto that moment in time and it's like I\ndidn't sleep the night before and then\nas soon as I stepped on court all those\nfeelings went away it was like okay I'm\nnow I'm home and then I I lost the match\nbut I played incredible it was a great\nfinal but I just remember seeing the\ndoors open real slowly and I saw every\nblade of grass the same length and I\njust walked out there and it was just\nlike home and then that was it I just\nI'm not disappointed that I lost the\nmatch obviously I would love to have a\nwi wooden Crown but it was all a bonus\nlike the fact that I was just walking\nout Novak's behind me Royal Family's\nthere like Nick curios making it that\nfar ridiculous when I hear you speak you\nspeak like every almost like\nreal it's almost like that childlike\nfeeling yeah of like you're still living\nin that childlike moment or childlike\nfeeling of what that would have felt\nlike where sometimes we grow up too soon\nand experience it that when you saw\nblade of\nbeing even that mindfulness like\nwatching the doors the fact that you can\nvisualize it it means you were so\npresent what goes through your mind\nduring the game when it's not going your\nway like what happens when you start\nlosing a point or when you know you\ncould have made something you didn't\nlike what's going through your mind at\nthat time just competing like just\ntrying to get the best out of myself\nlike I guess people when they watch me\nplay like why you get so angry it's like\nthere's millions of dollars on the line\nso many hours of work put in and I'm\njust trying to like do the best I can in\nthat moment of time like people when\nthey see me I guess getting angry or\ndoing whatever they're like he doesn't\ncare it's like I think I care too much\nat times on the result and coaches\nalways told me like don't care about the\nresult too much but in my life and my\nexperience if you don't win at the end\nof the day I wouldn't be here if I if I\ndidn't win majority of tennis matches I\nwouldn't be sitting here so I know the\nimportance of winning but at the same\ntime I guess I just\nI'm just so involved in every little bit\nof effort's been I know my my family's\neffort my support crew I want everyone\nin my team to feel that I care the most\nand I want like success for all of us\nnot I don't care about just me like my\nphysio is there my partner there my best\nfriend my agent like we're we're all\ncontingent and that's why I guess I love\nthe team environment a little bit more\nyeah but tennis is people just think\nyou're you're on your own out there but\nit's like there's so much more than just\nme like everyone's put so much work in\nto get here so your anger is actually or\ncare exactly I wanted to win wimon so\nthen like my whole team like can share\nthat with me I I don't really care like\nI actually don't really care and I I\nwanted to win winen so I could just shut\neveryone up and so I could be just left\nalone so if I'm at home and I'm actually\nhaving a beer or I'm just chilling\npeople just oh what are you doing I'm\nlike I want Wimbleton like you can't\ntell me anything you're in like you're\nImmortal in that tennis world you know\nyeah like I made the final and people\nstill criticize me I feel like if I'd\nwon that maybe it would stop so you feel\nlike when you're playing\nyou're trying to win because you feel so\nmany people have invested in you and so\nmany people believe in you the people\nthat you care about and that you almost\nwant to win for them yes and to shut\neveryone else up as well that would be\nnice I'm excited to see you go on and\nwin a few like I I I think you have the\npotential and the ability and you know\nthe mindset to go and do it but when you\ngo and win you know as well as I do that\nthat still won't shut people up I know\nthat know that I just it just false hope\nI guess what is that false hope walk me\nthrough that because I think that's real\nI think we all feel right this is this\nis this is the\nhypothesis we all feel that there's\nsomething we can do that will finally\nconvince people of who we are and we're\nall waiting in our own way to do that\nthing for you it may be a game or tennis\nfor someone else it might be a promotion\nfor someone it will be graduating with a\nparticular degree for me will be\ninterviewing someone whatever like we\nall have that thing where we think when\nI do this then people will say I made it\nyeah why is that I don't know I feel\nlike if people really understood my\njourney then they wouldn't be so pushy I\nthink and like if I just sat down with\nall my haters and we had like a nice\nmeal together and I gave them my side of\nstory I think they'd have a better\nunderstanding and they wouldn't be so\nlike they wouldn't criticize or be so\nlike aggressive towards me on social\nmedia or just in general so I feel like\nmaybe if I do win wimon and like it's I\nwas so close and I don't even really\nlove the sport like I'm only doing this\nbecause I love taking care of my family\nmy my people and I want to do this so I\ncan prove that no matter how much more\nof an underdog you are you can achieve\nsomething like winning win with it like\nthat's I never thought in my mind that\ni' would be capable of doing that and I\nlook may you are right I know that even\nif I did that people are going to be\nlike all right now do it again and it's\njust like that's I guess that's the rat\nrace of of life you know how much is\nenough and I feel like I'm very content\nwith my life I have more than enough to\nenjoy and so if it was up to me I\nprobably would I don't really want to\nplay anymore to be honest but I have to\nalmost I've got so much more to give but\nfor me I'm I I don't feel like playing\nanymore and that's not your way of\ntaking the pressure no it's not like I'm\nI'm exhausted I'm tired and you know I\nhave had three surgeries now that I'm\nonly 28 years old I always wanted to be\nable to have a family and and not be in\npain when I get up I can't walk without\npain so it's it's a tough gig it's tough\nI appreciate the realness\nbecause it's that you know there's a\ncouple of things that come to mind the\nfirst thing that comes to mind for me is\nalways I'm a Cristiano Ronaldo fan\nthrough and through like if anyone asks\nme CR7 or Messi I'm CR7 all the way he's\nthe example for me of you can achieve\neverything yeah and there'll still be\n50% of people who think that someone\nelse better yeah some else is better and\nnot even just better they think you're\nnot even in the conversation like\nthere's a 50% of people who will be like\nwell CR7 doesn't even make it into the\ntop two conversation yeah and it's\nbizarre that you can even feel that way\nand so that I look at it through that\nperspective where I'm like this guy's\nwon everything he's inspired pretty much\nevery next generation of football\nplayers in the world yet there are\npeople who have an issue with him and\nblows my mind and then at the same time\nwhat you're talking about the reality I\nappreciate you saying I'm exhausted it's\nhard you know I remember a interview\nthat Vanessa Bryant did Kobe Bryant's\nwife and she talked about how the only\nthing that got Kobe to play when he was\ninjured or having an injury during a\ngame was his love for the fans and he\nwould say that this fan paid to see me\nplay and if I don't play today then that\nfan may never be able to afford to play\nagain and so I have to play\nand so he was playing for Beyond him it\nwasn't I've got to play CU I got to win\nanother R it's really interesting to\nhear an athlete say I'm tired it's a\ntough gig it's hard because I think we\nalmost want to believe that the best\nathletes don't feel that but that's not\ntrue no it's not true and I guess that\nperiod in 2019 kind of accelerated my ex\nlike if I had a bit of a normal career\nand I flew under the radar I don't feel\nI'd feel this way but those couple years\nreally I think put a lot on my age like\nI'm 28 but I feel like you I've traveled\nto pretty much every country I've seen\ncultures you know I was traveling to\ncountries when I was 13 and I saw what\nyou know poverty was like it really\nopened my eyes and I guess those couple\nyears accelerated my almost pushed me to\nthe end of my career a bit earlier\nbecause I was just I felt that way and I\nwas so eternally hurting that I I had to\nplay for more than myself and that's why\nnow I do I'm exhausted when I train I'm\nlike I just I don't want people to watch\ndoesn't say Okay soft or whatever but\nit's just like it's just hard like I am\ntired I'm I'm tired of playing tennis\nlike it's it's more than going out last\nyear had the best year in my career and\nI'm playing in front of millions of\npeople stadium is packed out everyone's\neyes on me I don't know if I'm an\nathlete loves that but I'm a bit to that\nI feel like a circus animal a little bit\nI walk out there and like oh we just\nwant to see Kiros do something crazy\nlike I'm sick of kind of playing that\nrole I'm sick of playing like I have to\nturn to a completely different person\nand I don't like that it's exhausting do\nyou think when you come back how are you\ntrying to figure out how you'll approach\nit differently have you thought about\nthat well I think now I'm I've kind of\ncome to peace with I only want to play\nfor about another one to two years and\nbe at the top and and go on my own terms\nlike I would hate to have another\nsurgery or anything like that so I think\nI've still got the ability to have a\ngood one to two years and then that's it\nI think I'll be at peace with everything\nI've achieved and you're right I'm going\nto have to just say look to everyone out\nthere who wants me to play more you're\njust going to have to be okay with me me\nnot playing anymore yeah well people are\ntrying to figure out whether you'll be\nplaying in December yeah you're\nobviously like you said you're in pain\neven when you stand up like how do you\ndeal with that anxiety of like people\nwant me to play in December I don't even\nknow if I'll be better yet do I enter\nhow do you naate it's hard because you\nknow I'm going to the gym I'm doing my\nrehab you know you might have something\nseriously wrong with your body and it\ntakes time like we're I'm only human I'd\nlove to be like a Novak or someone that\njust is always healthy almost it seems\nthat way but it takes months and months\nof you know strength consistency dilcy\nto get back to playing tennis at that\nhigh level again like I don't want to\nget back on tour and just play decent I\nwas competing for Grand Slam so I want\nto get back to that level so it might\ntake you know a bit more time yeah I\nwant to go back a few things when you\nwere saying like if you could take all\nyour haters out for dinner and and hang\nwith them so imagine we were at dinner\nyeah and all the haters are here right\nnow\nwhat do you want them to know about you\nto understand you deeply if you could\nsay three things to them to understand\nyou more deeply and intently what would\nyou genuinely at the heart want them to\nknow if if we had the floor with them\nright now I guess I would I would want\nto listen to them more I'd be like why\ndo you dislike me so much cuz I feel\nlike when I'm reading all these comments\nthey really truly don't like me and I\nfeel like I don't dislike anyone that I\ndon't know like I just think it's\nridiculous to have an opinion or or that\nperson this one I have no idea who they\nare or how they are so I would just ask\nthem like why do you dislike me so much\nand then I would make them open up and\nthen I guess cuz I think for instance I\nuse my girlfriend as an example so my\nreputation in Australia is like arrogant\nhe's crazy he's\nvolatile and having those three things\nwhen you're meeting a person for the\nfirst time they be three pretty rough\nthings to like already assume of someone\nso I had to prove every time I meet\nsomeone new I have to kind of prove to\nthem that's not me and so and I I asked\nher what was the first three things you\ncame to mind and then she told me those\nthree things and so that's how everyone\nin the world that hasn't met me before\nassumes I am and that's that's pretty\nbrutal like how those three things are\nthey're terrible I I know hang around\nwith one person that is arrogant or\nvolatile or crazy so I think and she\njust spent time like two times with me\nand then she's like you're like\ncompletely different to how the media\npaints you out to be so I guess every\nhater just thinks I'm like that I'm\nassume so I would just try and prove\nthat I'm not like that but it's it's\nit's so hard how did she give you the\ntime of day to like make you believe\nthat cuz like you said for a lot of\npeople they and you've been together for\na bit now two years now coming up but\nyou I just bought a mirror off for small\ncompany it just it were just excuses you\nknow just an excuse of how am I going to\nget her to just give me the chance and I\nfeel like these people that hate me or\ndon't like how I go about things they\njust they won't even give me a chance\nthey won't even listen because they\nthink that I'm crazy\nand do you think you just you just\nstarted playing the character at one\npoint like definitely well that's you\nknow at the end of the day you know\nmoney's important so I knew that that\nNick could that's the one that everyone\nwanted they didn't give they didn't care\nabout how I actually was they just\nwanted that one like Brands just wanted\nto work with that one wow and that was\nhard like I was like every time I do\nsomething brand wise earlier in my\ncareer I was exhausted I got home I was\nlike thank God that's over so I could\njust be myself again and I'd meet people\nand they would just want that and how\ndid you know that were there people in\nyour like vicinity like telling you that\nor like because that's fascinating right\nlike the construction of talent is\nsomething that I think the average\nperson is so separated from like when I\nmoved to LA five years ago and I coach\nand work with so many different people\nin different parts of whether it's music\nacting athletes and you start\nrecognizing how their management and\ntheir teams want them to be a certain\nPersona whether it's like you got to\nshow that you're single because\notherwise people you know people won't\nbe into you if if you have a long-term\nrelationship or you've got to be this\nway so that this brand will want to work\nwith you how much of that was was in\nyour ear were you hearing things like\nthat or was it more in your own mind it\nwas more in my own mind I think you know\nmy team now have only ever wanted me to\nbe happy and be myself and I know that\nthat's why I keep them around I have a\nreally small circle but I knew that\nBrands just that knew that they wanted\nthat Nick and that's it's it's sad in a\nway because they don't even want to get\nto know me like as me as a person like\nwe wouldn't even have sit down and have\nthis conversation with they just wanted\nme to be that the one they see on the\ncourt like be the entertaining one and\nit's like I'm not like that off the I'm\nvery chilled out and yeah I just I feel\nlike most people just want to meet that\none yeah because it sells tickets of\ngets attention get the headlines it\nmakes a moment out of it when was when\nwas the day where you felt you played\nthat character really well like when\nwould you say you're like you know what\nthat was the best acting gig I ever did\nwhere last year at the US Open was good\nlike arur rash Stadium in New York is\nthe biggest stadium that we have and\nit's crazy you you go to the back and\nyou look up as on the plane it's just\nlike a wall of people just like glaring\ndown at you and that's the coolest thing\nabout tennis there's nowhere to hide\nlike if you're playing if you're having\na bad day you can't sub out there's no\none to play your position so you're just\nthere and I just feel like New York and\nthe Americans I feel extremely at home\nhere I feel like they really do enjoy\nwhen you put on a show and you do some\ncrazy stuff out there so every time I\nwas stepping out on that Court it was\nlike and like 5 minutes before I was in\nthe locker room I was like okay I got to\nI got to be more of that Nick tonight\nbecause I do appreciate the love that\nthe American fans do give me but yeah\nevery match was a bit of a was a bit of\na show do you feel differently about\ndifferent places around the world you've\ntraveled of course as a tennis player\nyou travel everywhere how do you feel\nlike when you're in Australia versus\nwhen you're in the UK versus when you're\nin the US like what me through the\ndifferences you experience as a player\nin the media and everything else austral\nI I I hate playing in Australia like\nthat's going to if you're going to air\nthis obviously that that's going to\npeople think that like most Australians\nlove playing Australia but there was one\nkind of moment that ruined it for me I\nwas playing second round of the\nAustralian Open I had some match points\nwas like a 4 and a half hour match and\ni' lost I'd lost second round I remember\ngetting booed off the court in Melbourne\nand that was one of the worst feelings\nfor me because I remember after that\nmatch\nI was I locked myself in the physio room\nwith my Physio and there were just\npeople knocking in on the door like I\nhad to do media I had to do this and I\nwas just I turned the lights off and I\nwas just so overwhelmed like I'd given\nmy absolute all in front of my my fans\nfor 4 hours and I lost the match and I\njust got booed off the court and for me\nthat really ruined that put a sour taste\nin my mouth playing in Australia and I\nknow now like I've had some great\nresults in Australia and they have been\nbehind me but I don't forget things like\nthat I feel like if I Loved Someone and\nI understood the effort and and the\nhours I put in I would never do that I'd\nnever boo off one of my hometown Heroes\nso and that's why I guess it's affected\nmy relationship with Australia you know\nplaying for the country it's because\nI've been battered in the media there\nlike they've said some horrible things\nlike there are some Australian legends\nthat have told me and my family to go\nback to where we come from and I I just\ndon't forget things like that I've had\nLeon hu call me on my phone and say why\ndon't you want to play for the country\nlike everyone here wants you here and\nit's like yeah but I no no other player\nin the in the country is dealt with the\nbacklash or the the negativity towards\ntheir family their girlfri like me like\nthat that hurt so I guess playing in\nAustralia for me I don't I don't really\nlike London I just don't fit it there at\nall like Wimbledon it's a crazy feeling\nit's like the documentary said it's like\na snowman in the desert it literally is\nI walk around there everyone's like oh\nmy God he's wearing like a I could be\nwearing like an anime shirt they're like\noh look what he's wearing everything I\ndo there's like under a microscope and\nthat's a that's a cool feeling I guess\nNovak would kind of understand what that\nfeels like too like the villain you know\nyou know it's like no one wants to see\nyou win no one and you made the finals\nyou have people like Piers Morgan just\nthrowing absolute Venom at you and\nthat's why I feel I love playing the US\nOpen cuz I feel wow this is at home like\nthe energy is amazing and they they\nbring that energy that I have and I love\nplaying there so yeah Australia and\nEngland are a bit I don't like playing\nthere but us I love it yeah good yeah I\nlove Asia as well Asia is amazing Asia\ntoo yeah they just I think Asia just\nlove entertainment they love something\ndifferent and they're they're respectful\nyou that I think they get to think the\npeople are different there but yeah I\nlove I love playing Asia as well what\nwould have changed if you were allowed\nto be nice guy Nick from the beginning\nlike and and people perceived you as you\nactually are like how do you think that\nwould have impacted your game your\ncareer to work well the first 5 years of\nmy career I was almost impossible to get\nany sort of deal with anyone cuz they\njust thought I was volatile crazy they\ndidn't want me representing their brand\nwhere I feel like if they knew I how I\nwas and actually like a nice guy that\nwould have helped would have I prob\nwould have made a lot more money I\nprobably would have been more at peace\nwith people actually knowing that I was\na good guy cuz for a minute there I\nthought the whole world thought that I\nwas just a terrible person I feel like\nit would have helped me I definitely\ndon't think I would have fell into that\ndark period of my life as well but cely\nI don't want to I don't want to change\nthat because that makes me who I am\ntoday obviously I know everyone kind of\nsays that but when I opened up on social\nmedia about it the amount of people that\nnow open up to me daily you I got people\naround the world that you I give them my\nnumber and I've had phone calls with\npeople and tried to articulate in a way\nthat it's okay like that's completely\nnormal what you're going through but\nlike please keep reaching out to me stay\nin touch with me if you need any help so\nthat's been the most powerful thing in\nmy career at the end of the day is\nhelping others getting through rough\npatches of their life all the\naccomplishments I don't actually care\nabout them I would I I don't all my\npeople know I don't ever sit there and\ntalk about what I've achieved like I\ndon't really care about it I think\nthat's all a bit superficial but the\nplatform that I have now is amazing what\nI can do with it yeah it's interesting\nisn't it as a\nprofessional we assume that complete\ncontrol is a demonstration of Brilliance\nwhen the reality is that when you're\nplaying something you love it's natural\nto be passionate yep and like I think I\nmean I'm not an athlete but as in even\nif I'm playing football with my mates if\nI miss a shot someone misses a penalty I\ncould take it very seriously and I don't\nsee that's sign of passion and care and\nenthusiasm and energy it's not a sign of\nnot caring they're not caring or being\nangry at someone or being mad at my mate\nit's my mate he's always going to be my\nM but in that moment it's like dude you\nshould have put that penalty away right\nand but we've tried to make com\nespecially in tennis yeah it's almost\nlike there's no space for passion and\npersonality especially in tennis yeah\nit's a very look it's a it's a white\nprivileged sport so I was again I was\nbehind the eightball from the gecko you\nknow I was College\nhad some you know big personality wore\nthe emotion on my sleeve so I was always\ntrying to play against so many more\npeople than just so who was down beating\nthe best players in the world is already\nhard enough you know the training every\nday the diet the the discipline that was\nalready hard but me it was like I was\nplaying against Millions more people\nevery time I went out in the court and I\nthink that's why I'm a bit more\nexhausted than the average tennis player\nnow when someone goes out there they're\nnot they're just playing against Who's\ndown the other end but I was playing\nagainst the media I was playing against\ncuz I knew that every every little thing\nI did was under such a microscope and\neven if I had a Flawless match I was\nlike oh that's how he should be anyway\nbut then the minute I did something bad\nit was like oh here it is see that's his\ntrue col I was like I couldn't win I\nactually couldn't win and then if I was\nwell behaved and disciplined it was like\noh it's boring so it's like okay which\none do you want and that's how I've\nalways felt like on the tennis world\nthey they haven't embraced me and that's\nwhy I've got such a big chip on my\nshoulder now with the tennis world it's\nlike I don't know any one any anything\nanymore so that's been the biggest it's\njust been a whole Contra like a walk in\ncontradiction my entire my entire career\nit sounds like a lot to carry yeah it is\nit is and I think that's why I fell into\nthat dark space cuz I knew that I\ncouldn't win no matter what I did how\ndoes this I wanted to show you this yeah\nthis\none take a look at that it's uh from the\nboss open stutgart June 2023 I\nbelieve don't look\nhappy um yeah and I was just this was\nwhen me coming off my knee injury and I\nhad a pretty pretty serious operation\nand I just knew that physically I\nprobably wasn't ready to go\nand it's hard because even when I don't\nplay or you know even during Co I the\ntennis world used me as a kind of one of\nthe key marketing points to keep I guess\nthe sport a float while it's during that\nperiod and and that's been one of the\nhardest things as well it's like from a\nsport that's given me so much negativity\nand you know kind of treated me like an\noutcast they still use me as you know\nsomeone that they want to you know put\non the front cover for you know tickets\nor getting people to be there so it's\nlike I know that I just get treated so\npoorly in the tennis world it's like it\njust honestly I look at that photo I\njust look like I'm just spent like I\njust so my there's just no energy there\nand it's sad cuz I'm just in front of a\ncamera doing another interview because\nthe tournament needs it yet I know that\nif I which I did go on to lose that\ngot got hate for it\nso yeah it's hard it's hard it really is\nare you trying to heal your relationship\nwith tennis and the industry like for\nyourself in the sense of it almost feels\nlike you have you carry there's validity\nto this of course like you carry like a\nsense of like pain and stress and\nvictimhood to the industry because\nthere's been so much pain caused to you\nis there any part of you that's trying\nto heal that so that you're not carrying\nthat bitterness towards the industry I\nthink so much damage has being done from\nI guess because when people ask me like\nif you had your time again would you\never pick up a racket and I genuinely\nhave thought about it and I don't think\nI'd ever play the sport like I don't\nthink I'd ever pick up a tennis racket\nand that's such a scary thing because\nit's like my whole life has been built\noff tennis and if I had this again like\nto go again I wouldn't play tennis and I\nthink\nthat's that's so hard and it's so dark\nlike my whole whole life now revolves\naround what I've achieved on the court\nbut then if I could do it again I\nwouldn't ever want to pick up a racket\nand that is like and I'm genuinely being\nhonest like I've had conversations with\nmyself about it but I don't think I can\nrepair the damage that I guess the\nsports brought upon me and just anyone\nlike the am amount of stress that has\nput on my family has you can't heal that\nlike you know about 6 months ago someone\ncame to my house with a gun and pointed\nat my mom for to steal my car and I\nnever thought that I'd bring that up\nlike I live in Australia in a nice\nneighborhood like where things like that\njust don't happen and it's just been\nhard like I never thought I'd deal with\nthings like that like the trauma that my\nmom has now gone through and yeah I\ndon't think I can repair my relationship\nwith tennis at all\nwow I mean that's yeah it's amazing that\nyou've been able to kind of take care of\nyourself and your family and figure it\nout because a few years ago I\ninterviewed Dennis\nRodman and it was one of the toughest\ninterviews I've ever done because he was\nin a really bad place at the time I\ndon't know him personally so I don't\nknow if he's better now or you know\nwhere he's at but all I remember was\nthat in that interview he\nwas like I asked him what his purpose in\nlife was and he said to survive another\nday like that's where he was at and a\nlot of it was because of how he'd felt\ntreated by the media cuz he was like you\nknow Dennis Rodman was was everywhere\nwhen you know Not only was he successful\non the court but off the court his whole\nlife was documented in so many ways and\nand he was the wild card too like in his\nin in his Persona yeah and it's just\nfascinating to me like it's almost like\nuntil someone crashes or until someone\nBurns we don't realize how\nheavy media and like I don't think our\nbrains are wired for millions of\nopinions no they're not to write about\nus and our performance and our families\nand our life and I think the amount of\npeople that are now dealing with that\ntoday who are in the spotlight\nconstantly has only increased there are\nmore people in the spotlight and there\nare more\npeople criticizing people in the\nspotlight and I don't think we've ever\nstopped to think about and when someone\nis as honest as\nyou you can only empathize to think yeah\nwe don't realize the damage we're doing\nto people because I don't think it's\ntennis that you're mad at as a sport\nyeah the activity it's what comes with\nit is what it sounds like to me yeah\ndefinitely it's not playing tennis no\nbecause I I enjoy it I think tennis is a\ngreat Sport and everyone who plays it\nI'm like it's I can see how it's\nenjoyable and it's it's great for you\nyeah it's more so I think Kyrie Irving\nyou know I love some of his stuff\nbecause he says like I don't think\npeople understand words can actually\nhurt someone a lot and I've told I had\nI've said the exact same thing like Fame\nand social media it's all man-made like\nit's someone's not supposed to deal like\nsupposed to wake up and then see such\nnegativity feed into their brain\nconstantly every day and like how how do\nyou expect someone to just perform or\njust survive with that much negativity\nand you I have conversations obviously\nyou wouldn't understand but I have\nconversations with some my friends about\nit no one can understand that because\nit's like it's not normal like you're\nnot supposed to say all that negativity\nyou're not supposed to deal with it and\nI don't know I guess I've kind of run\nout of answers or Solutions as to how do\nyou deal with that like yeah you can\nspeak to people about it but it's so\noverwhelming and how do you stop it and\nyou're right until someone really\ncrashes and burns then you're like I\nthink we push it too far but that's\nhuman nature we all take things for\ngranted and we all don't understand our\nactions until you know there's a\nreaction but yeah I mean I don't like to\nword it in the sense that I'm just\nsurviving every day I'm just surviving\nbut it it does feel like that for me\nlike that's why everything's a bonus\nlike if I'm here tomorrow and I'm\nenjoying it I'm eating Chipotle and I'm\ngoing to watching Lakers game or E\nClippers game like that's amazing like\nthat's awesome I never thought that I'd\nstill be here doing those things but\nobviously Dennis just couldn't obviously\narticulate any other way like that's how\nit is that's how it feels like at times\nand just a bit dark to say it like that\nbut yeah was in a dark place but I guess\nthat's just what it feels like for me\nhalf the time as well what I was saying\nit's amazing that you've been able would\nhave be more upbeat and kind of positive\nand and I hope you keep finding that\nbecause just from the few moments we've\nspent I could tell you like you like\nhaving a good time you you like smiling\nyou like laughing you like you know like\nthere's a positive energy that surrounds\nyou from the moment you walked into my\nhome today and I hope you always hold on\nto that because you have that natural\nability to make people feel good and and\nhave a positive energy and I hope you\nnever lose that because it is seems to\nwho naturally who you are it's so easy\nto go down the other track how have you\nmanaged though with your relationship\ntoo like obviously quite public about\nyour relationship like how have you\nmanaged to maintain that in a positive\nway as well because that seems to be a\npositive part of your life a part of\nyour life you like sharing aot a part of\nyour life that you talking about earlier\nlike but having a relationship in the\nspotlight is very challenging so how\nhave you managed to keep that in the\nspotlight but then also keep it positive\nwell I was very that just comes from\nexperience as well I've had\nrelationships prior that that you know\nwere toxic and they didn't end up going\nwell and I think the thing I love about\nmy relationship now we have such strong\nboundaries and respect for each other\nlike we don't and in with social media\nand relationships in general like\nboundaries can be a bit soft and I think\nyou know my I come from a background\nwhere my parents have been together for\nnearly you know 40 years wow and they're\nyou know they're still they argue and\nthey they joke with each other they get\non each other's nerves and you know I\nspoke to my mom about it she goes\npatience is the biggest thing in a\nrelationship where communication and\npatience and I I think like she my\ngirlfriend's a bit more a bit younger\nthan I am but we've we've sat down we've\nwe've set our boundaries and respect for\neach other and I think that's why it\nworks because we understand that being\nin the spotlight is brutal like for\nrelationships there always going be\npeople trying to tear you down send a\nmessage here or there like even liking a\nf like these types of things and I've\nnow realized that I have to be diligent\nwith these things because it's a respect\nthing like on social media I guess\nthat's like who you are in today's day\nand ages who you are who are you on\nInstagram who are you on Twitter so you\nhave to make sure that you're ticking\nevery box on those sort of platforms but\nyeah like and my girlfriend gets it and\nshe listens to me if I hadn't have all\nthese experiences she wouldn't listen so\nshe knows that I've been through a lot\nand and she trusts me as well so she's\nvery she does listen and we have a great\nrelationship yeah yeah the the\nboundaries part is so important it's so\nimportant yeah you know like if I I\nalways have this example like you know\nlike\nif if if she was like pregnant with my\nkid and my just popped up with like you\nknow girls just like liking my photo and\nstuff like that plays a part I think\nthat builds up you know tension and then\nit just explodes so you know I try and\ntick every box and make her feel\ncomfortable and respected and especially\nit's heightened because we're in the\nspotlight so much so I try and I try and\ndo everything I can to make her feel\ncomfortable yeah no it's uh you know I\nthink it was I remember my wife and I\nhad been together for like three years\nbefore no we'd been together for for\nwe've been married for 3 years and\ntogether for 6 years before we did\nsomething together publicly on social\nmedia Y\nand I felt that that was so important\nfor us because we'd been together for a\nwhile but then when social media started\nto take off for me and and the content\nthat I was making we were just still\nlike finding our foundations and like\nfiguring it out and I can't imagine if\nwe would have been active on social\nmedia together\nin any way earlier than that for us\nbecause I think I was just figuring out\nwhat it meant for me then she was\nfiguring out what it meant for her and I\nfeel like a lot of people it doesn't\nmatter whether you have a platform or\nnot we're not having those conversations\nand figuring that out with another human\nbeing and even now even till this day my\nwife has different priorities on social\nmedia and what she wants to share than I\ndo and it comes with so many interesting\nquestion marks like we had someone\nasking us a question of like like oh\nlike well you post about your\nrelationship but she doesn't like does\nthat mean there's an issue and I was\nlike no it's just we have different ways\nlike I love sharing about her\nrelationship she likes keeping it a bit\nmore private like that doesn't mean that\nthere's an issue but it's so fascinating\nhow everything gets taken out of context\nyeah I think most relationships the\nproblems stem from social media and you\nknow I've got friends that have very\nhealthy relationships with different\nstandards on social media like you said\nbut I feel like to give the relationship\nthe best chance of working you need to\nsee eye to eye on those things because\nin my previous relationships the St the\nstandards on social media weren't the\nsame and they weren't as respected of\nboth sides and it didn't go well but\nhere we have we see eye to ey and I\nthink it's a crucial part of it because\nit again social media what what is it\nlike I didn't grow up with social I had\na flip phone and and I remember the\nfirst time when Instagram became a thing\nand it was like you used to share a\npicture of a flower and stuff now it's\nlike a whole business it's it's just\nevolving and it's changing so I think\nyou need to have it's so important to\nhave these conversations because they\nunfortunately it plays a huge part in\nrelationships it does yeah another thing\nthat came up on social media was your\ninteraction with Drake that you posted\ndid you ever get together well the thing\nis we didn't our beef was so so\nridiculous like I was 19 and I just said\nI came out slow so I'm not going to\nlisten to Dr I said it jokingly and then\nhe came out and said oh who is this guy\nI'll chop him down and I was like all\nright you're five you're like 5'9 I'm\n6'4 and then um and then he reached out\nafter wimon and then I I went back and I\nwould love to I mean I would love to get\nhim on on on my stuff but he I mean I\nalso respect these guys have so much\ngoing on you know in in their life and\nif they speak to me or send me a message\nthat's a bonus you it it comes back to\nall that being a bonus so I do love his\nmusic I'm just going to say that yeah\nyeah so do I so do I good and uh but no\nit's funny but that so that was an old\nconversation old conversation yeah yeah\nthat was funny that was funny no I mean\nI think I mean watch it I think you guys\ndoing a podcast today would be dope that\nwould be cool I think it be really good\nlet's put it out there I think that\nwould be cool that would be that would\nbe awesome to watch no it's I I love\nwhat you keep going back to man I think\nit's you know I've met so many people\nwho have achieved incredible things but\nthey've lost that childlike view of it\nthey've lost that not that they've lost\ngratitude but they've lost that feeling\nof like oh my gosh I can't believe this\nlike that feeling of magic and it feels\nlike you've held on to that that I think\nthat's the only thing I like even just\ndriving to your house today like I was\nlike this is insane like I just I love\nyeah I just love like I have utmost\nrespect for everything you've created\nlike you must just look back at your\njourney and be like wow like this is\nsick and I love reminding people of like\nnot that they need it but like it feels\ngood when someone comes into you and\nactually is like dude well done like\ngood stuff cuz I can only imagine how\nhard you've worked for everything here\nand like I feel like the normal person\ndoesn't really realize how hard someone\nhas to work to achieve all this just you\ndidn't just put your hand into a raffle\nand pull it out and be like okay I'm J\nshet now with all this like and I just\nlove making people feel that way and\nit's because it's yeah we all started\nfrom from something so small and I think\nthat's so cool and and you and how you\nfind a way to still let yourself feel\nthat way yeah sometimes I I I like\nmaking myself feel good and it's not in\nan arrogant way it's like I I just think\nI've done some pretty cool things like\nyou know whether it be on the tennis\ncourt or collaborations with people like\nit's a it's cool and I think for the\nviewers that are going to watch this\nlike it's not like you just we just\nstarted in this position like we were\njust normal people and we didn't really\nask for everything that came with it\nwe're all trying to figure it all out\nyeah what's been your proudest moment\noff the court I guess anytime I'm with\nmy family and you know where having a\ngood dinner together we might be eating\nat a restaurant and just all together\njust any moment like that for me now is\nthe best I just feel like we were cuz\nduring that period when I was really\nunwell I didn't talk to my family at all\nI didn't you know speak to them they I\ngave them I put so much stress on on my\nfamily and now when we meet up and we\nhave a gathering and we're all there and\nwe're just having some good laughs like\nthose are the my my favorite moments now\nlike the simplest of things are so make\nme so happy now yeah do you do a lot of\ntogether during the holidays coming up\nor yeah we going there's so many you\nknow we have the annual curios Christmas\nparty like things like this tell me\nabout that tell me about the annual\ncurios Christmas so every every year\nthere's like in camra like 3 to 400\npeople come through our house during the\nnight 3 to 400 people and then they're\ncoming and going there's always a theme\nlike this year it's Gatsby so everyone's\ngoing to be in suits cigars and stuff so\nit's good last year was like superhero\nsuper villains like those types of\nthings now are amazing like I can't wait\nto just see all my loved ones family and\nfriends and that's what I look forward\nto now and yeah I guess everything that\nI achieve is and when people like ask me\nthat they're like no you're just being\nhumble it's like no I genuinely just\nlove simple moments like that so good\nyeah yeah what's you were talking about\nyou've been inspired by the Next\nGeneration walk me through a moment\nyou've had with like a young fan or or\none of those moments that you feel like\nthat stays with you and that keeps you\nmotivated and keep going well I guess my\ngame style is you know unorthodox and\nyou know I'm playing crazy shots and\ncrazy moments and when people send me\nvideos of like their young kids playing\nthey're trying to hit a tweener or\nthey're trying to serve like me that\nthat's cool I think someone that I kind\nof look up to is like alen Iverson you\nlook at his basketball game and you look\nat the culture he left you know the way\nhe dressed and he's some of his press\nconferences are are hilarious and I\nthink he had his own style and people\nwanted to be him and I think when I when\nit's all said and done there's going to\nbe so many people around the world\ntrying to play like me and play the shot\nthat they're not supposed to play and\ncuz it gives them that thrill so I think\nif if that carries on at the end of my\ncareer that's that's something pretty\nspecial yeah yeah it's very cool I\nremember I still remember the Alan\nIverson rebok I am what I am adverts I\ndon't know if you had rebook back in\nAustralia back then but in the UK we had\nthese ads and it used to just say I am\nwhat I am and Alan Iverson kicked it off\nand it's stayed with me ever since that\nday even though you know I I maybe never\ndidn't even follow the brand or the\nsport that much but still it stayed with\nme yeah he's like the definition of that\nlike I just love his press conference so\ngood cuz he was just like human he said\nlike I cry just like you guys you know\nI'm not the best every day I don't feel\nlike working I don't feel like showing\nup but and you expect me to do all these\nthings and I think yeah just normal\npeople towards athletes or people that\nyou know have a lot of things going on\nlike they just lose a bit of compassion\ntowards those people I think yeah you've\nmentioned crying a few times I was\nwondering when was the last time that\nyou like really cried or something that\nreally made you cry I probably could\nhave broken down a couple times during\nsome of this conversation but I tried\nnot to\num I try to control it a little bit more\nthese days I just feel like I used to\ncry a lot you know I've had\nconversations with my you know my mom um\nheaps of people I feel like I can break\ndown so often just because things are\njust so raw and they just have it's like\na if you pull the wrong string I feel\nlike at any moment in time I probably\ncould get really emotional but I think\nwe do need to be a bit stronger than\nthat at times um but yeah I I my dad I\ndraw a lot of strength from my dad you\nknow he's he never cries and he's always\nhe's like the strong person in our\nfamily so I try and look I looked up to\nhim a lot with that type of stuff so\nyeah I mean I used to cry a lot yeah but\ndo you see do you still see crying as a\nweakness or you've seen it as a good\nOutlet as well I mean you're obviously\nfeeling that way for some reason I think\nit's not good to let it in it's not good\nto bottle it up during this conversation\nand I felt like crying and because\nyou've touched on things that are so\nemotional and I think that if I don't\ntry and be stronger then I'm always\ngonna you know someone's going to watch\nthis like I don't want them to think\nit's like the only way is to open up and\ncry about it you can be strong about\nthings and I still feel like crying of\ncourse I do but I feel like I need to be\na bit stronger than that yeah that's an\ninteresting I I like that kind of nuance\nbecause of course I believe it's healthy\nto cry I think it's necessary to cry\nsometimes when you feel a certain way\nbut at the same time I agree with you\nthat the ability to know you feel like\ncrying but keeping it together not for\nperformance or not for the sake of how\nother people feel but you're almost\nstrengthening your ability to deal with\nan emotion is an interesting Nuance cuz\nI feel like the world used to tell men\nlike you can't cry and then it became\nlike you should cry and then and then\nthere's like this in between which is\nthe reality of like I can relate to what\nyou just said where I'm like I like\ncrying sometimes I think it's important\nbut then there's sometimes where I'm\nlike no actually I want to be able to\nhold myself like I just gave a it was my\nsister's wedding like two months ago and\nI didn't anticipate how emotional it was\ngoing to be so my sister's like five\nyears younger than me she's been my baby\never since she grew up she's a little\nkid for me she's short as well she's\nshorter than me so it's like she's\nliterally like a child and I knew her\nwedding was coming up and all the rest\nof it you prepped yourself for it I I\nkind of prepped myself but I didn't\nrealize how was going to be and Indian\nweddings are like huge I got I got I got\nI got a guy he's he's going to be\nwatching this for sure he told me about\nhe sent me all the videos nuts you guys\nare crazy it's crazy so it was five\nevents over seven days and every event\nhas like 300 people in and so we at\nthere and I was more emotionally drained\nafter that week than I am for my whole\nyear of like giving and helping and\neverything that I do that was the most\nemotionally moving week of my entire\nlife and I walked my sister down the\naisle and if you watch the video I'm\nliterally trying and I'm doing what you\njust said you had to do I just had to\nhold back cuz I knew if I cry and she\nsees me cry then she's going to cry then\nher makeup's going to go bad then then\nshe's going to be mad at me later that I\nmade her cry on a wedding day yeah and\nso I'm holding it back and then my wife\nthought about it ahead she told her she\ngoes don't look at him during the\nwedding ceremony cuz he's going to be\ncrying and so my sister avoided eye\ncontact with me the whole ceremony cuz\nthe whole time was crying and it was\njust fascinating to me because I've\nprobably not cried that much ever in my\nlife but there were times when I had to\nhold back for her sake and there were\ntimes when I let it out and I like that\nyou brought that up because I do think\nthat we've gone from one extreme to The\nOther Extreme of men never CED to men\nshould cry all the time to figure out\nthat healthy balance yeah I think it's\nwith anything like you get injured you\nbreak a bone it heals you get stronger\nso like it's not to say that you\nshouldn't acknowledge the pain or\nacknowledge trying but trying to stay\nstrong through those moments I think is\njust as important of of realizing yeah\nyou're you're hurt and those are touchy\ntopics but how are you going to every\ntime someone brings it up are you just\ngoing to cry or are you going to be able\nto talk about and educate other people\nthat are going through the same thing\nyou know I think you got to be a bacon\num and just yeah hold it together a\nlittle bit what's your days looking like\nright now like now that you're in your\nelement you're having a good time things\nare opening up you're doing new creative\nEndeavors what what does your day look\nlike right now and what you loving about\nit yeah well my team comes with me for\nthese opportunities and obviously like\nyou know I I kind of it's all insane the\nfact that I have these options now and\nso obviously training is a big part of\nmy day still you know obviously\nrehabbing through you know surgeries and\nand just maintaining that strength\nwhilst you're not playing is a big thing\nyou can get pretty you know relaxed with\nit and you can lose years of work in in\na couple of months so you know I'm\ntrying to stay on top of that and then\nwith doing all these things I feel I\njust got a new passion cuz I I love\ncommunicating with people I love\nlearning about people and I love helping\nand I just love entertaining giving the\naudience something different than what\nthey've seen from me the last 10 years\nso just all these types of things\ntraining you know seeing the world with\nmy girlfriend is is is I know that we're\nExtremely Blessed you know 95% of\nrelationships you don't get to travel\nyou don't get to do the world like we\nget to do it so I know that I'm\nextremely blessed in that department and\nand a little 1% of NBA games I love\nbasketball so yeah you been watching\nyeah yeah I'm watching we might be going\ntonight to the game too oh who's your\nteam I'm a Boston Celtic fan okay so\nbeing in La is tough\nyeah what's been the best country you\nvisited your favorite place that you\nvisited maybe with your girlfriend even\non your own that that's kind of like\nleft the mark well Australia is the best\nplace in the world I'm just going to say\nthat it is every person that go I loved\ngoing to I had the best time like out of\nmy whole tour I had so much fun in\nAustralia it was amazing Australia is\nthe best place in the world I I love the\nstates personally just because of the\nsport you guys do sport here like\nnothing else\num but my mom's half Malaysian I'm half\nMalaysian my mom's Malaysian so every\ntime I go to Malaysia or you know any\nAsian country I love the food like you\nknow my mom cooks I'm not just saying\nthis my mom is honestly probably one of\nthe best cooks in the world and I've\ngrown up with such a good food\nbackground so I love I could live in\nAsia hands down um but the states\nprobably some in there I mean I'm half\nGreek Europe's nice but Australia is the\nbest place in the world it's the best\nplace in the world where in Australia if\nsomeone had to visit where should they\ngo where should me I come from Cambra\nand everyone from Australia thinks CRA\nis not a very good place but I love the\nSimplicity of CRA like it's a very I\nlove coffee like I love the cafe scene I\nlove just chilling but Sydney Melbourne\nor even Gold Coast some of that\nbeautiful places just such a good\nlifestyle they're so safe and you can\njust do whatever you need to do in\nSydney I mean Australia in general so\nyeah yeah yeah I need to go back I I\nwent for work and I was feel like when\nyou go for work it's different\ndefinitely of course and so I was like I\nwas telling my wife I was like we have\nto go back and and just experience it I\nlike to come come to you for\nrecommendations yeah we got a couple\ngood spots couple good spots what would\nyou say now if there's anything keeps\nyou up at night still yeah so I lost my\nI lost my grandma when I was about 19\nafter I first broke onto the scene and\nshe was like my best friend through my\nchildhood like my mom and my mom was\nalways working I didn't get to see much\nof my mom like my grandma picked me off\nfrom school dropped me into trainings we\nslept in the same room together we had\nbunk beds like we were like best friends\nand she kind of passed away when things\nget a bit crazy for me in my career like\nmedor and you know I probably didn't\nspend as enough time with her that I\nwould have liked and I think back to\nwhen you know we she was in a nursing\nhome towards the end of her life and I\nfeel like that kind of really bothers me\nI feel like\ntennis took time away not tennis itself\nlike you said the sport just everything\nthat came with it took special time away\nthat I should have had with her and I\nwas so young and naive to say to these\npeople no I don't want to do it like it\nwas like the time where you know money\nwas coming in for my family I was\nchanging my entire family's life so I\nfelt like that that sits with me and\nthat's painful because she was my best\nfriend and she I guess she maybe\nunderstood it maybe she didn't so I feel\nlike if I could spend some more time\nwith her instead of doing Media or an\ninterview or business or something like\nthat I guess I wish I could have more\ntime with her but hopefully she's up\nthere watching and and proud of\neverything that I'm doing now and yeah I\nguess that I think about that you know\nall the time that's that's that's a\ntough one when you can't do anything\nabout it now CH yeah you can't change it\nthose are the ones that are\nlike you know it's it's tough thinking\nyou could have done one and you're so\nyoung too and like your career is taking\noff like it's so forgivable in that\nsense like you know it's how would you\nknow at 19 what to prioritize and what\nto focus on and you're living the dream\nin one sense and like you said you're\nchanging your family's life it's it's\nhard it's hard to deal with that and I\nguess would you say it doesn't sound\nlike that's a regret though it does it\nsounds like it's something that's kind\nof yeah I think I used to think it was\nlike I used to really be upset about it\nand I I was regretful of doing\neverything that came with it I was like\nI hated tennis I hated everything that\ncame around it cuz I was like we I just\nkind of I didn't leave her but I kind of\njust didn't spend as much time as I used\nto spend with her so now I've come to\nunderstand it like I was young I didn't\nI wasn't educated on you know these\nthings that I had to be doing so I I\nguess I've been a bit nicer to myself on\nthat on that topic but I still think\nabout it like I unfairly think about it\nat night time yeah yeah it's yeah it's\nit's amazing how the mind works right\nlike you can literally avoid something\nthe whole day yeah and somehow at night\nit comes back and it just like almost\nlike on Clockwork like on time it's so\nfascinating how have you found a way of\nswitching those thoughts off or um I\nguess I just realized now that that's\njust more love and more time that I want\nwanted with her so I'll try and look at\nher as a positive like why am I always\nthinking about this moment why is it\nalways coming up it's just because she\nmeant a lot to me and that's you know I\nhave so much more stuff that I wish I\ncould just sit down with her now and\nspeak about everything that's been going\non and you know she would love it she\nwas the ultimate jok through in our\nfamily she had she was just a free\nspirit and I feel like that's where I\nget some of my personality from on the\ncourt so if I could just sit down with\nher now and just chat about things would\nbe amazing and I guess that's what I\njust try and turn into positive like she\nI got so much stuff that I want to talk\nto her about and I feel like yeah if she\nwas here during that dark time I don't I\nthink I would have got through it a lot\neasier but yeah I guess I just turned\ninto a positive yeah there's there's\nalso you've said that you know after the\nwimon game with jovic you you felt like\nyou could have won it like there was a\nfeeling like yeah you could have done\nthat that could have been it how much\ndoes that play on your mind a lot that I\nwas two sets away from winning wimon and\nyou know if I played anyone else on\nplanet that day I felt like I would have\nwon so yeah I mean now I'm at peace with\nit but for the 3 to four months after\nthat was like an everyday it was like\nnot just a nighttime thing it was like\nwhat could I have done differently every\ntime I was in the gym every time I was\non court like why didn't I you know that\nwas my opportunity why didn't I just\ngrab it but now I understand like the\nmore he achieves now the more I'm nicer\nI'm like okay no everyone's trying to\nstill figure this out but um yeah I mean\nlook N More Than 99% of the world hasn't\nfigured out how to beat him on a on a\nconsistent basis so I can't be too angry\nabout it yeah I like that perspective\nthat's a good mindset to have yeah and\nbut it's so interesting right like I can\ntotally empathize with that idea of how\nyou can be so harsh and heavy on\nyourself for like three to four months\nbecause you can overanalyze how have you\nmastered the art of limiting over\nanalysis or what have you learned about\nstopping over analysis to the point that\nit becomes a weakness well tennis is a\nis a sport where you have to be a good\nloser because every week you're you're\nlosing unless you're one of these top\nguys who is winning consecutive\ntournaments you're experiencing a loss\nevery week and you just have to pick\nyourself up and go again in a different\ncountry different surface different time\nzone so you just have to just be really\ngood at understanding what you've done\nwrong moving on and just going again cuz\none week one to two weeks in tennis can\nchange your life you can have 30 Bad\nweeks in a row the minute you have one\nreally good result things change for you\nso you have to that's what I about\ntennis you have to learn to bounce back\nquickly and I think it's That's A Life\nLesson like you're going to experience\nups and downs things are going to be\nhorrific for a couple months they might\nbe great so it's like riding the wave\nand being kind of equal through\neverything and just backing up and going\nagain consistency is you learn that from\ntennis so early on which is cool I like\nthat yeah with other sports you have an\noffseason so you have like a period of\ntime to say what do I need to get better\nat I can get stronger with tennis\nthere's no off Seas it's like every week\nit's a new tournament so you can't be\ntoo down when you lose and then when you\nwin it's like but you're playing\ntomorrow so you got to just start again\nyeah what's something in life that\nyou've had to learn the hard\nway\n[Music]\num that's hard yeah take your\ntime I don't know let me ask you that\nquestion what something I've had to\nlearn the hard\nway here's a hard question so let me\ntake a second\nto that no one's coming to save\nme that no one no one magic person is\ngoing to discover my\nabilities my qualities and help me\nbecome the best version of myself that\nthere's not going to be one person who\njust activates it all you activates it\nall and makes it easier and shows me the\npath and clears all the you know clears\nall the obstacles and says Jay Just Walk\nThis Way and like when you put something\nin in iPhone maps and it tells you which\ndirection to go exactly like someone\nwho's going to come and show you the map\nof\nlife and no matter how much someone\ncares or doesn't care it's that's not\nthere and I think I've I think I just\nhad this inbuilt belief since I was\nyoung that someone else was going to\ndiscover me and help me and it was only\nwhen I realized that that person was me\nthat life became easier but it took me a\nlong time to learn that\nand you know they talk about it in\ndating especially for the way women were\nraised but it's called the Disney\nprincess syndrome this idea of like\nhow Disney made young women believe that\none day your night and shining armor\nwill come and save you and there'll be\nthis perfect guy who has everything\nfigured out and you'll kiss a frog and\nhe'll become a prince and all these\nideas and I think we all carry that in\nsome way so I think that's been really\nhard for me and I think the other one\nwas what we were talking about earlier\nlike I think something I've had to learn\nthe hard way is I deeply\nbelieved that when I achieve a certain\nlevel of success that everyone will like\nme y or that when I make it to this\nlevel that everyone will recognize my\nstruggle and my pain and everyone will\nacknowledge how hard I've worked yeah I\nguess that's that's probably been my\nbiggest one like I I wish people like\nwhen I meet new people that they just\nlike how I am with people that have\nachieved things I'm so grateful I'm so\nlike proud of them in a way and I don't\neven know these people but I'm like wow\nyou must have worked really hard like\nthat for me is like I wish people would\ngive me more just maybe a little bit\nmore credit from time to time you know\njust of some of the things that it it's\nbeen hard it hasn't been like an easy\nJourney at all for me and for for I'm\nsure anyone in a position of achieving\nthings it's been so hard yeah and that\ncould be anything right like I think\nwe're talking about everyone everyone\nlike if you're someone who's just\nfiguring out how to pay the bills for\nyour family or you're taking care of\nyour K deserve a little pat on the back\nhe deserves to sit down and may be made\nto feel good a little bit about things\nyou know yeah yeah and it's almost weird\nbecause we think of that as cheesy yeah\nlike we think of that as like I'll get\nover it you know just but I feel like we\nall need me and my friend talk about\nthis my my best man at my wedding like\nmy best mate we talk about this a lot\nabout how we all need a sense of\nacknowledgement and recognition for what\nwe're doing yeah and a lot of the time\nthat scene is like soft or it's scen as\nlike oh you shouldn't need that like get\nover it I think it's motivating like I\nthink it makes you want to achieve more\nwhen people recognize okay you're doing\nreally well you're on the right track\nkeep going it's not like it's not\narrogant I think to just sit down and\nrecognize that I've come a long way I'm\non the right track and what I'm doing is\nvery special I think that could be\nmotivating in a way rather than seen as\nlike soft or why do you need credit for\nthat like it's like you're not doing\nthings at every single person person is\ndoing like that you're doing obviously\nsomething about you is special your your\nyou know your details are you're ticking\neverything off the box like that's you\nshould need acknowledgement for that\nyeah what's uh is there is there\na moment that you wish you had acted\ndifferently in a press conference or in\na game a moment where you look back and\nthink you know what actually I'm better\nthan that and I'm I'm such a I'm a nice\nguy that's not me that was so far from\nwho I am that I actually don't feel good\nabout yeah I've had so many moments like\nthat I mean I could go on YouTube now\nand I guess the thing about tennis is\nwhen you finish a match you only have\nyou you have to do media like so soon to\nwhen finishing so you haven't had time\nto digest any sort of emotions so you go\nin there with and the thing about it now\nwith me I walk into a room with about 50\npeople all ready to attack me they're\nnot actually going to ask me about oh\nhow did the match play out they're going\nto just nitpick and come at me in an\naggressive way and I haven't had time to\ndigest I I haven't even eaten after 4\nhours sometimes and then when I did that\ntime on Pi Morgan he's like this guy's\nso rude he's so such so disrespectful I\nplayed for 4 and a half hours I needed\nto eat some food because for my\nnutrition and my preparation so it's\nlike I walk in there and I have had no\ntime to digest I haven't and then these\npeople are just going at me and then I\nretaliate and for me oh I'm not that\nthat that's fine you should be able to\nretaliate but then I look back at all\nthe people that are watching this kids\nand they see I could be disrespect F to\nsomeone that I don't even want to be\nthat but in that moment I just haven't\nhad any time to just reflect on what's\njust happened and I feel like yeah I do\nI do regret sometimes on how I've acted\non the tennis court or in the press\nconference because it's it's not that\nversion of Nick curiosity I want people\nto like millions of people to watch and\nsay oh that's how he is what a prick you\nknow what I mean but that's not me and\nAustralians in general we have a bit of\nthat like where if you come at us we'll\nwe'll retaliate in a way of you know\nwe'll make you feel it too and I I guess\nmy upbringing where you know the\nbullying and stuff I've always had that\nchip on shoulder where I'm in a position\nto give it I'll give it a little bit you\nknow so I don't feel proud of making\nother people feel bad and I think that's\njust more of a retaliation of I know how\nmuch it hurts so now I'm going to give\nit back to you a little bit and that's\nnot that's not a good thing to do\nespecially after you know in a press\nconference where millions of people are\ngoing to see it yeah see I definitely\nhave some regrets with that yeah yeah\nespecially when it's not you it's not me\nyeah I think that's I think that's the\nhardest part right like when something\nyou there's a certain understanding that\nyou have with it but when you feel like\nthat's not me like I I I can empathize\nwith that like if in any conversation or\nanything that I've done more offline\nwhere I've not acted like myself it's\nalmost the hardest thing in the world\nbecause I'm like God now I've shown\nsomeone aside of me that's not me\nexactly and then they run with it\nthey're like look look how he is and I'm\nlike that was like a 10-minute press\nconference you know it's not\neven at all of what I actually what's\nkind of person I am at all so yeah\nthat's been that's been hard and it's\ninteresting by the way it is interesting\nto understand the context of you playing\nfor four and a half hours you haven't\neaten like it's good to know all you\nknow like The Human Side of like if\nyou're watching a press conference\nyou're not thinking it through that\ndeeply no you're not you're just like ah\nthis guy just come off the court like\nwhatever like's you know it's what we do\nand it's interesting cuz I'm like yeah\nif I was hungry for four and a half\nhours and I'm just played and I get\nasked a question that annoys me I can\nimagine retaliating too and defensive\nlike exactly if if the player had you\nknow if you came back into the tennis\ncourts the next day and had a whole\nnight to reflect on the match moments\nwhere you were great moments where you\nweren't you could just speak calmer\nabout situation it's like when couples\nhave a fight sometimes having figuring\nout then and there is not the best thing\nyou know you need some time away you\nneed to reflect you need to have a\nconversation and come back and when\nyou're both Cala like rather than when\nthe emotions are high and you just turns\ninto an absolute explosion so yeah I\nmean that's the same thing and I'm into\nroom where empathe that I lost they like\nwhy you lose for why you act like this\nit's like okay you're attacking me now\nI'm going to go back at you and then\nyeah so yeah and it's the Trap it's the\ngame they want play that's the Articles\nand the headlines they want it's the\ngame they want to play yeah who is that\nwho is the basketball player who had a\nreally good respon was it yanis oh yeah\nand he's like do you you know if you\ndon't get a promotion do you see that as\na bad year like exactly everything's\nbuilding to you know losing is not\nalways seen as a failure why is that so\nyeah yeah no it was what is the joy tell\nme tell me how it feels yeah to break a\nracket how how does that feel it does\nfeel good it does feel good doesn't it\nit does feel good sometimes it feels\ngood when does it when does it feel good\nand when does it not feel good I guess\nit doesn't feel good when I know it's\ndetrimental to what's going on if look\nwhen I know when I get to that level of\nanger I know that it's not helping me\nbut sometimes you know if I've lost the\nmatch and you know the match is over and\nI go to my bag and I see it there and I\nknow that I've got all this anger built\nup and I let loose it does feel good the\ntiming of doing those things can help\nyour performance or you know cuz\nsometimes I've seen in my experience but\nother athletes like jovic and Serena\nWilliams all these Legends of broken\nrackets but the response after that the\nkey component and sometimes you need to\nlet off the steam because you're\nexpecting more from yourself and I feel\nlike the response if you're going to\ncome back with energy and you know say I\ndid that now it's time to reset that it\ncan actually help you in a way walk us\nthrough the balance of when anger is\nhelpful versus when it becomes\ndestructive as the way you found it cuz\nI've been angry where I've broken\nrackets and then I become you know\nsmartass with the Umpire and then I'm\nI'm actually not concentrating on what I\nneed to do to win the match it's like\nI'm more pissed off at myself I'm more\npissed off at the Umpire where I've had\ntimes where if I break a racket and you\nknow I walk back to my bag and I'm like\nall right here we go you've you've done\nthat now you know it's time to reset you\nwe we're not playing well but now how\nare we going to change that so I feel\nlike the discipline of doing and these\ngreat players have shown that and they\nstart playing better and they end up\nwinning the match so it's hard because\nyou don't want to make it seem like a\nviolent act because then kids are going\nto be like it's okay to throw rackets\nit's okay to but that's why I think the\nresponse after that's more important\nit's like he did that but then he\nstarted playing unbelievable so\nsomething must have clicked in his head\nafter he did that so I guess it can be\npositive but you don't I'm not going to\nsit here and say yeah smash all the\nrackets in the world no no no not at all\nyeah yeah no no that that's a that's a\nthoughtful response like I I can\nappreciate that like\nI can definitely see how getting that\nkind of competitive Spirit out in a\nphysical act can be like helpful I I can\nrecognize that yeah and unless it hurts\nsomeone else which it isn't exactly and\nso it's it's interesting how like you're\nsaying like the greats do it often y but\nthe respon is like how how did how did\nthat help you process things yeah versus\nhow did it lead you down it's like a\ncomplete reset almost so yeah and I've\nI've seen it all the time like I've seen\njovic alar as Serena do these things and\nit's like okay they realize they're not\nplaying up to their standard and they go\nback and you see them breathing and then\nit's like they've done that it's like a\nit's like they've reach the limit of\nplaying really bad and now it's time to\nswitch that so it's good I mean it can\nit can be used as a reset yeah how much\nis meditation and breathing or\nmindfulness been a part of your world or\nis that something you're discovering or\nyou've been practicing for a while oh\nI'm just the I'm in complete work in\nprogress like people think that I've got\nmy stuff figured out and you know I have\na nice routine like people don't realize\nthat having a routine is harder than\ndoing something different and having\nstimulation every day that's easy like\nhaving waking up and doing something\ndifferent is so easy every day but can\nyou get up week in week out monthly\nyearly doing the same routine having the\ndiscipline like that's having a routine\nfor me is probably the hardest thing\never and that's been my weakness in my\ncareer is consistency okay played great\nthat week but canny shop and I haven't\nproven I guess that's what I haven't\nproven is cons I've been consistent\nenough to make it this far but am I\nconsistent Enough To Be A Champion\nprobably not and I know that so I think\nI'm just a work in progress whether it's\nmeditation whether it's breathing like I\nstarted Pilates like two months ago I\nnever thought that I'd ever stop Pilates\nlike when my girlfriend went to Pilates\nI'm like I started laughing I started\ndoing it I'm like oh my God this is hard\nthis is hard ass I'm still trying to\nfigure out like breathing for me is a\nbig one when I'm on court I I I really\nam mindful of my breathing but am I I\ndon't even think I'm at that point of\ndiscipline or consistency yet to\nmeditate I can't even I hate being alone\nwith my thoughts still I still have\nextremely dark thoughts so I think I\njust try with easy you know consistent\nhabits you know go for a walk to get a\ncoffee in the morning with my girlfriend\nor you know just these lighter things um\nhaving a routine for me is incredibly\nhard still and people with routine think\noh they're boring no they're just cons\nthey're really disciplined and\nconsistent with their work and that's\nthat's really healthy\nroutines and disciplines are I mean yeah\nthey're so hard to build so hard to\nbuild easy to break y so easy to fall\noff so hard to get back on yeah and so\npowerful when you get them right yeah\nand yeah anyone who can keep a\ndiscipline together every day is it's\nit's it's a serious achievement it is\nwhat what's the most difficult emotion\nor thought that you deal with regularly\nstill or an emotion or thought you\nstruggle to deal with still um that I'm\nnot enough I\nthink that was the biggest one I think I\nI struggled with was I'm letting people\ndown and I'm not enough and that's from\nyou know millions and millions of\nopinions that have just built up over\ntime and I I can see you know when I\nlose a tennis match or when I don't\nachieve things I can see sometimes my\neven my family get disappointed and\nthat's just it just ate me up for so\nlong like going on social media saying\ncuz I was supposed to be the next per\nafter the big three it was like okay\ncurios is going to take over the mental\nhe's going to be the one for 15 years\nyou know being professional winning\ngrand slams and I think I look back on\nmy career and I didn't even get close\nnot even a quarter of what people\nthought that I should have achieved um\nwith the talent that I have and I still\ndeal with it it's\nlike I'm never going to achieve what all\nthese people thought I was going to\nachieve but I've had tough conversations\nwith myself in the mirror saying like am\nI okay with not maybe winning a grand\nslam am I okay with not achieving you\nknow I am I I I'm okay with that but\nit's still hard because it's like I know\nthat my family would love that like they\nmaybe would they they would prefer me\nbeing that type of champion or this\nperson and I really did struggle with\nthat early on like it's it's hard\neveryone wants you to be something that\nyou're not but the one thing that they\nkind of understand more is that I'm\nhappier being this this way I'm happier\njust being myself and having some fun\nand and just doing it my way and that's\nthat's I'm so thankful that the most\nimportant people are they can just\nunderstand I'm not saying that they\nthat's what they want but at least they\ncan understand it now but yeah that's\nbeen that was the hardest thing I think\nfor me that makes sense Nick you've been\nincredible man this has been uh what I\nreally appreciate about you is\nthe genuine authentic raw real answers\nlike I can tell when I'm sitting with\nyou I'm listening to someone who's\nnot it's interesting in a press\nconference it seems like you don't feel\nfilter the combativeness and today I'm\nlike you're not\nfiltering to make\nyourself look a different way or appear\na different way you're just being who\nyou are and I really appreciate that\nbecause I think we all need to to make\nsense of it and I think a lot of us who\nare struggling with that feeling of not\nbeing enough or not living up to the\nexpectations of our family or not having\nachieved the goals that everyone else\nthought we'd set out to I think that's\nmore of us in in life than the people\nwho go on to achieve everything and the\ninteresting thing is even the people\nthat go on to achieve everything that\neveryone wanted them to they're not\nhappy either because they often find\nthat they went and W at things that they\ndidn't care about they lost themselves\nthen they lost themselves and so I know\nthat this is going to resonate with a\nlot of people but as you know we end\nevery onp purpose episode with a final\nfive these questions have to be answered\nin one word to one sentence maximum okay\nand so Nick curious these are your final\nfive the first question is what is the\nbest advice you've ever heard or\nreceived uh it's Never As Good As It\nSeems and it's never as bad as it seems\nwho said that where did you learn that\nso s he was one of my tennis coaches and\nI feel like we there was that was very\ntennis specific because when I was on\ncourt I had the talent to like Amaze\nmillions of people but I always went on\nCourt and tried to do that where he was\nlike you don't have to do that these\npeople paid to come watch you play just\nbecause of how you just are so I always\nwas like okay maybe I don't have to try\nas hard and then when I was playing bad\nhe I used to think I was playing\nhorrific but then he was like you're bad\nfor most people is still amazing so it's\nnot that bad and then I started carrying\nthat to everyday life like when I was\nhaving some really bad moments and\neveryone thinks when they're going\nthrough a struggle they're like [ __ ]\nthis is the worst part of my life and\nI'm like this is not the worst part of\nyour life it's just going through a bad\nphase so that's why I'm never too high\nanymore with some amazing achievements\nlike when I finals of Wimbledon to most\npeople was is an amazing achievement and\nit is but I wasn't like it's like I\ncarry my trophy everywhere with me and\nI'm like you know I make fun like you\nknow I just you know it's an amazing\nachievement and it's it's it's in the\npast now so I think just being able to\nride the the highs and the lows the same\nI think when you're able to do that it's\nyou can just navigate through life a\nlittle easier and you know that's the\nthat's actually the quote above the\nWimbledon Court is when when when you\ncan look at a victory and a loss the\nsame way that's when you've you know\nconquered life a little bit so I think\nyeah that's like the final thing you see\nabove the core as it's opening up I'm\nnot sure that's the exact quote but it's\nalong those lines so that quote there is\nvery similar to that you know it's never\nas bad as it seems It's Never As Good As\nIt Seems nice I love that uh Second\nquestion what is the worst advice you've\never heard or received it's not that\nsimple I don't like I think about when\nI've Had My Success you know I've eaten\nhealthy I've been active and I've just\nworked hard those it's it it really is\nsimple for everyone I think if you just\nbreak it down into nice simple\ncategories you're going to get the best\nout of yourself and you you're going to\nhave success whatever whatever that is\nsuccess is different for everyone but\nit's not that simple the amount of times\nI heard that in school in from tennis\ncoaches from everything it it really if\nif they told me it's simple like do\nthese things and you'll probably get the\nbest out yourself so yeah it's not that\nsimple though I hate it I hated hearing\nit cuz it really was to get in my\nposition it is quite simple yeah it's\nit's hard but the the steps to getting\nit it's it's actually very simple yeah\nit's not easy but it's simple yeah yeah\nyeah I agree I would agree uh question\nnumber three what's something that\nyou've been trying to unlearn oh that's\na t that's a hard one because I've had\nto unlearn nearly everything that I\nthought like cuz you know I made so many\npeople I'm not really following your\nrules of keeping it short am I that's\ncool man it's good they're good answers\nbut um a lot you know I've met so many\npeople and I thought that I'd meet a lot\nof I thought I'd meet a lot of cool\npeople and good genuine people on the\nway but I've been really disappointed I\nfeel like I feel being in our position\nit's hard every time you meet someone\nyou don't know if anyone genuinely wants\nto be your friend or hang out with you\nor you know go to dinner with you\nbecause we're good people or is just do\nyou want to just be around us because of\nand that's just a common struggle I\nthink that I deal with every day I\nreally do struggle with that cuz I'm a\ngenuine person I only want to hang out\nwith you if I think you're cool and\nyou're you got a good heart so I think I\nI I thought that a lot of people I'm\ntrying to unlearn that everyone has good\nintentions I felt like everyone should\nhave that and everyone\ndoesn't that's yeah and that's a hard\none that's a really hard one and I I can\nresonate with that too I think sometimes\nit's really interesting right like when\nyou're I feel like sometimes if I get\nalong with someone or I feel like a\nnatural sense of chemistry with someone\nI can come on quite strong but I'm just\nbeing who I am and I'm okay with that\nlike I'll be like to someone hey we\nshould hang out or whatever I'm exactly\nlike that and and I like living that way\nbecause to me that's how I've made some\nof my best friends if I wasn't like that\nyeah you're always sheltered how you\ngoing to experience like the good times\ntotally and and I've opened myself up to\nthat sometimes people are like oh maybe\nhe has something that he wants or like\nI'm like no not really I'm just that's\njust who I am that's how I was raed just\nfeel good yeah exactly and so I I I can\nrelate to that all right question number\nfour a rule everyone should break and a\nrule everyone should\nfollow I prefer the follow one I think\ngoad um\noh I don't know I'm going to give that\nto you I'm going to give that to you I\ncan't answer the rule everyone should\nbreak y i i i actually I can't answer\nit I've never asked it before I just got\ninspired to ask it to you rule everyone\nshould break I'm just trying to think of\nrules that the world sets that we think\neveryone should break and so let me\nthink of a rule the way I would think\nabout it is what of rules that we were\nall told like even Unwritten rules that\nwe all heard since we were young that\nnow I look at it and I go n we should\nbreak that\nrule and you expected me to answer the\nquestion and you no no no I want to give\na genuine answer cuz I know but you're\nso the way you have answers to pretty\nmuch everything but I like I like to be\nthoughtful because it literally I came\nup with that question right now just for\nyou like it was a moment thing it wasn't\na the I would say that like an Unwritten\nrule or like a rule that I think\neveryone was told to follow was like I\nfeel like when you were growing up yep\nyou were told to fit in yes and then\nwhen you get older you're told to stand\nout y right it's like if you want to be\nsuccessful when you're a kid fit in yeah\nwear the uniform stand in line do well\nin school it's like everyone's told to\nfit in and then as you get older if you\nwant to win at whatever career auth you\ngot to be different you got to be\nauthentic it's like wait a minute and so\ninstead of fitting in or trying to stand\nout the rule to break is to say well I'm\nnot going to fit in or I'm not going to\nstand out I am just going to learn to\ndiscover myself and I think it's not\neven about being you I think that's the\ncheesy answer of like just be yourself I\ndon't think it's about being yourself I\nthink it's about discovering yourself\nand getting to know yourself and so the\nrule we need to break is stop trying to\nfit in or stand out just get to know\nyourself I think figure out yeah just\nfigure it out is what comes to mind\nanyway so I like it yeah we'll go with\nthat you just keep flipping them back on\nI like it it's smart it's good tactic\nit's good PR training this this a class\nin PR training from Nick Fifth and final\nquestion if you could create one law we\nask this to every guest of all time if\nyou could create one law that everyone\nin the world had to follow what would it\nbe before you criticize someone you have\nto do what they do for one day so like\nif someone criticizes my tennis game\nthey need to get on the court and try\nand play or like if I was criticizing\nsomeone that I had to go I think that\nshould be a law before you if if you're\nwilling to criticize then you're going\nto be that person for one day and deal\nwith everything that that person deals\nwith that is a brilliant answer I love\nthat we never had that on the show and I\nlove that that would be amazing if you\nactually became that person for a day\nyou had to swap lives anyone you judged\nor criticized you had to swap lives with\nthem for one day yep that would be\nphenomenal and it's not like a it's not\nlike a holiday it's like a business day\nit's not it's not like a party like a\nSaturday night no it's like the the\nworking day yeah because then I would\nthink I would think twice yeah like I've\ncriticized basketball players anyone I'd\nbe like oh you what and then they like\nall right you want to do the day thing\noh actually no I'm good cuz I think a\nlot of people in my position would like\nthey would freak out I think if I had to\ngo out and play a match in front of the\nstadiums then do the press conference\nand then deal with the criticism and\nthey had to real like feel the realness\nof it all they wouldn't want to\ncriticize again yeah I like that law man\nlike that's a good law it is a good law\nit's a good law Nick kirus Nick this has\nbeen such a joy and pleasure man you\ntotally overd delivered and for what\nit's worth from the moment we started\nmessaging to meeting you today to having\nthis conversation you're a genuinely\nnice guy man appreciate that thank you\nand uh I've enjoyed every minute we've\nspent together and I look forward to\nmany more genuinely genely man yeah it's\nbeen fun thank you man of course if you\nlove this episode you'll love my\ninterview with Kobe Bryant on how to be\nstrategic and obsessive to find your\npurpose our children have become less\nimaginative about how to problem solve\nand parents and coaches have become more\ndirective in trying to tell them how to\nbehave versus teaching them how to\nbehave"
