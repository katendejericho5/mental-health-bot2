    "transcript": "when I used to work in the corporate\nworld I used to always tell everyone\nhave a 55 minute meeting or have a 25\nminute meeting that then gives you an\nextra 5 minutes to stand up to walk to\nget hydrated to look out of a window or\nmaybe get some fresh air and then to\nlook out into the distance so that\nyou're not constantly shortsighted I\nfeel today we're constantly looking at\nour phone at our laptop at an iPad and\nwe're becoming more and more\nshortsighted and that's why it kind of\nfeels like our mind can feel a bit\ncrowded and clouded I feel like just\nshifting it from having 5 minutes off\nevery hour which isn't going to\nnegatively impact a meeting you're not\ngoing to achieve anything more in that\nextra five minutes and same with if you\ntook 15 minutes off a meeting maybe if\nmeeting shifted to being 45 not an hour\nI think you'd achieve so much more in\nthe meeting too because now you have\nless time and so a lot of it's just\nbreaking these old rules that have just\nlasted for far too long"
