year ago\nit feels like it feels like about a year\nabout a year yeah about a year yeah\nabout a year and I remember we got in\nuced through my health coach I believe I\nthink I'm trying to now I'm like trying\nto piece it together yeah connect the\ndots I think it your health coach right\nyeah so Mona Sharma who I've worked with\nfor quite a few years now she introduced\nus right you have this incredible\nfacility I know it's definitely in la\nbecause that's where I go where else do\nyou have it so yeah we have three\nlocations in La one in New York and one\nalso in Hawaii right now in Maui which\nis sadly right now they're going through\na lot but um and now we're actually\nfranchising all over the world so we'll\nbe in Dubai um we will be in Canada\nAustralia and all over United States\nhere pretty soon and talk to me about\nthis transition that you made very early\non in your journey or not early on\nactually sorry more recently yeah more\nrecently you made a shift in your career\nright because you went from practicing\nas a doctor traditionally to now\nbuilding next Health talk to me about\nthat transition and us to about why you\ndid that and what was the reasoning\nbehind it yeah I think you know most\nPhysicians never anticipate a complete\n180 transition in their career\nespecially after you've like dedicated\n25 plus years but I felt a real need to\ndo that and it was mainly because of my\nown personal health so what happened was\num I started off as a surgeon um I then\nalso went into the entrepreneurial side\nof surgery I brought surgery centers and\nI started hiring doctors as well and so\nI was spending half my life being a\nsurgon treating patients in the\noperating room the other half my life\nrunning the business and the other half\nof my life you know trying to maintain\nmy own health and my own um sanity and\nunfortunately that last part of my life\njust kind of fell through the cracks\nright and so what happened was I found\nmyself 15 plus years into my career as\nprobably the most unhealthy person in\nthe building that I was working in I was\n40 lounds overweight and you know weight\ndoesn't really matter for everything but\nfor me that really led to a tons of\nhealth challenges such because I had\nhigh blood pressure and that blood\npressure was not getting any better\ndespite being on two medications I was\npre-diabetic on Diabetes medications and\nI was not able to move very well like\nall my joints achd because of an\nautoimmune disease starting so you know\nI was 15 16 years into my career and I\nwas like I'm getting really really sick\nand um at that point in time as well I\nhad my first child and you know having\nyour first child is often like a time in\nyour life where you sit and reflect and\nI was actually doing the math utilizing\nstudies that say like if you have this\nhemoglobin A1c this level of high blood\npressure this level of obesity how long\nyou're going to live and that's I was\ndoing the math and I came quickly to the\nrealization I was a little bit older\nwhen I had my first child I was 40 that\nI would not live to see him potentially\ngraduate from college and to me like\nthat was a major kind of punch in the\ngut right like what am I doing to myself\nand so that kind of started this thought\nprocess and this transition in my life\nwhere I said I need to make some massive\nchanges here and I need to do a quick\nbecause I need to be alive for this kid\nyou know I did what a lot of people do I\nsaid you know I need to find the best of\nthe best doctors so I went to Beverly\nHills I researched all the best\nconcierge medicine doctors you know I\nhired an expensive concierge medicine\ndoctor I said your job is to get me\nhealthy went to his office and um you\nknow paid a pretty penny for this too\nwasn't cheap he did a bunch of tests on\nme and he found out that yeah I was\npre-diabetic and it was getting a little\nbit worse and I was hypertensive and I\nneed to be another blood pressure\nmedication and probably the reason I was\nhaving difficulty moving and you know\nbeing performing all the activities of\nmy life that I wanted to perform with\nVitality was because I was depressed so\nthen he added a anti-depression\nmedication to my list of meds so my list\nof meds Grew From eight medications of\n12 medications and that's all he told me\nhe just prescribed me four or five more\nthings there was it even a mention of do\nyou go to the gym do you how do you\nsleep what's your stress level like not\neven a question about that and I thought\nto myself like there is something really\nwrong here and and this is the world\nthat I grew up in right this is the\nmedical training that I grew up in the\nin medical school when I did med school\nback in the\n1990s you spent one day of one class\ntalking about nutrition maybe half a day\nof another class talking about sleep but\nit was mostly about Sleep Disorders\nright right uh like sleep apne and\nthings like that I did not have the\nknowledge so how could I expect this guy\nto have the knowledge right I mean\nWestern medicine is so disease focused\nand so reactive that unless things are\nreally bad and we can't prescribe you a\npill or a surgery there's nothing they\ncan offer you really right and so I saw\nlike a massive flaw here and I decided\nthat moment in time like I need to learn\nfor myself how to do this right so\ndecided to hire someone else to take\nposition in my office that I had and\njust take some time off and educate\nmyself and so that led to 6 months to a\nyear of going to every conference I\ncould find and this was like eight nine\nyears ago when I have a struggle my\nfirst instinct is to educate myself\nlearn learn learn and so I went to every\nconference I could find I went to like\nPhysical Therapy conferences I went to\nlike how to become a personal trainer\nregistered dietitian courses I went to\nall these conferences and I learned so\nmuch much and then I kind of stumbled\ninto the field of functional medicine\nhave you heard of functional medicine\nand I'm sure you have you had Dr Heyman\non here is one of the fathers of\nfunctional medicine my favorite people\nin the whole world but learn from him\nand others about the root cause of\nillness and it was incredible like\nwithin eight months I was able to like\ncompletely turn my health around and as\nI was doing this the patients I was\nseeing I was helping them do the same\nthing and they were like how come no one\ntold me this and so that's what kind of\nstarted my new career in met I said you\nknow medicine is fantastic if you're\nhelping sick people become unick you're\ntreating cancer you're treating diabetes\nbut it's also to me exponentially more\nfantastic when you're helping the other\n90% of people who aren't sick stay\nhealthy and never get to that point in\nthe first place and so for me it was\njust kind of bringing all that together\nand really providing a place for people\nto go when you're not yet sick like when\nyou not yet need to go to the doctor the\nhospital where do you you go it's not\njust the gym right there's much more you\nneed to do there a lot more work to be\ndone and that's what I then dedicated my\nnew kind of my new life in medicine to\nis creating that place what are those\nkey pillars or the core areas of next\nHealth based on functional medicine that\nyou're measuring and that you think we\nall need to be aware of when we're\nlooking at that 360 degree look at our\nhealth right right so you know this is\nwhere I think you know I have this\nconversation with all my patients we sit\ndown and we say look there's an\noverwhelming amount of health\ninformation out there and a lot of it is\nnot based in science there's a lot of\nlike majoring and minor things right\nthere's a lot of focus on like what's\nthe best superfood or you know what's\nthe how much caffeine should I have per\nday but like in reality what I tell\npeople is let's break this down for you\num into the main components and over\ntime let me educate you on the main\ncomponents of Health but let's not major\nand the minor things let's focus on the\n20% of the information that's going to\ngive you the 80% of the result right\nlike what are the key two or three\nthings you need to know on each aspect\nof your health to create a major\ndifference and that's the parto\nprinciple which is where can you expend\nthe least amount of energy to get the\nmost amount of results and once you get\nthat right you can absolutely go down\nthe rabbit hole further if you want to\nso we start off I have this thing called\na wellness wheel I call it they're 12\npoints in the wellness wheel we start\noff with the basics nutrition sleep and\nexercise but then we move on to gut\nhealth immune system health Hormone\nHealth heart health and brain health and\nso then we spend a lot of time talking\nabout each one of those individually and\nin each one of these categories what I\ndo is I try to frame it as this it's a\nthree-step process and the first step is\nnumber one how do we make sure you're\nnot dying from this right how do we make\nsure your nutrition is not killing you\nlike you're becoming a metabolic\ndisaster with diabetes or how do we make\nsure that your immune system is healthy\nenough to prevent cancer how do not die\nbasically the second part of it is how\ndo we improve your health span how do we\nkeep you as healthy as possible for as\nlong as possible and then the last part\nis what's the advanced science out there\nin the longevity world that we can um\nImplement into your life once we make\nsure you're not in trouble and then\nyou've mastered how to take care of your\nhealth span yourself how do we then\nstart applying these um these new\ntechniques this new science so a lot of\npeople come to us and they want to jump\nstraight to like how do how do I do\nnadiv how do I do hyperbaric oxygen\ntherapy I'm like no no no let's hold on\na second let's make sure you're not\neating ultr processed food first because\nthat's what's going to make the biggest\ndifference right so that's kind of how\nwe frame it and it's um we go down each\none of these categories and talk about\nwhat's going to make the biggest\ndifference for people fantastic I think\nthis is I wanted to lay that out for\npeople because I wanted people to\nunderstand a you've been on this\npersonal Journey yourself there's a\nprofessional shift here as well because\nyou can see the kind of challenges that\ncome with traditional medicine and how\nfunctional medicine is is the future\neven though it seems like it's rooted in\nancient times or an older method that's\ncoming back and then looking at these\nkey areas and that's what I want to dive\ninto with you today if that's okay AB i'\nlove to touch on all these areas because\nI'd love to give people whoever listened\nto this episode whether you're watching\nat home or whether you're you know\ncooking right now whether you're\nlistening with a partner or whatever it\nmay be I want this to be the episode\nthat you come back to to learn about\nthese areas of your health so you can\nbecome more proactive not reative and\nget focused on the areas that need help\nso abolutely yeah let's dive\ninto let's first start with nutrition\nbecause I think that it's such a big\narea of our lives and I think it's one\nof those ones that everyone will say hey\nI was put in for surgery but I was never\nreally told to change my diet or even\neven when I went last year like you\nhelped me through my you didn't perform\nthe surgery but you helped me through my\nhernia surgery and I've spoken that on\nthe podcast a couple of times and I was\nnever told to change my diet however by\nby the doctors you did tell me and so\ndid Mona if you had not told me that it\nwould have been a lot harder to even\nrecover so even though it wasn't\nintegral to the surgery it did affect\nthe recovery and so let's talk about\nnutrition it's such a big part of our\nlife let's start with what has gone\nwrong with our food like what what has\nchanged about our food that it's almost\nlike a surpris to us today that what we\neat is affecting how we feel yeah it\nit's it's really multifactorial but it's\nall happened in the last 50 or 60 years\nyou look at like obesity rates heart\nattack rates diabetes rates the last 50\nyears just exponentially increasing and\nI think it's a few things that happened\none was there was a little bit of a\npanic back in the 50s that we weren't\ngoing to have enough food to feed\neverybody right so the government start\nputting into place subsidies and laws\nand bringing corporations together to\nstart Mass producing food and that mass\nproduction of food led to over farming\nof soil packaging foods to make them\nlast longer but then also you know you\nhave these packaged foods are not that\ninspiring so how do you make them taste\nbetter you make them hyper\npalatable and then whenever you involve\nCorporate America in anything right\nwhat's the goal of Corporations to make\na profit how do you do that by making\nthings cheaper and making more of them\nright so now you have these Giant Food\nconglomerates like making tons and tons\nof food as cheaply as possible and that\nmeans using chemicals it means using\ndyes it means hiring scientists make it\nhyper palatable so even though normally\nyou're you know you would eat this thing\nand your body would be like what is this\nyou this is horrible and you your body\nable to sense how bad it is for you now\nyou can't because the scientists have\nmade it taste good right and so you have\nthis massive um kind of explosion of\nultr processed food and entire\nSupermarket you look at the square\nfootage of a supermarket only the\noutside of it is dedicated to fresh food\nthe entire middle is frozen processed\nboxed canned food right and we have so\nmuch of it in our society right now that\nthat's really what's caused a lot of the\nproblems in addition to that we have\nfood coming from all over the world to\nus so it's being shipped to us it's\nbeing stored it's being preserved it's\num being grown in soil that's over\nfarmed and so we kind of come to this\ndisaster point where most of the food\nthat we see that is being supplied to\nour population has become full of toxins\nand basically not healthy for you so\nreally we have to really really look at\nand take a step back how do we eat 50\nyears ago and how can we go back to that\ntype of eating pattern yeah and so I\nthink that's the hard part right like\nyou just said that when you go into a\ngrocery store you're seeing that the\nmajority of it is taken up by processed\nfoods\npeople are thinking well how do I what\ndo I eat because it's almost like we've\ngot so used to eating out of tins cans\nboxes packets it it almost even takes a\nsecond to think of what food isn't in\none of those or isn't refrigerated or\nisn't Frozen or whatever it may be like\nwhat would you say taking your 020\nPrinciple as you were mentioning\nreferring to before what is that thing\nthat we can do 20% because I think when\nwe think about food it just feels so big\nand overwhelming and then the stress\ncooking with our busy lives and working\nand coming home late from work and\ntrying to eat something quickly like\nwhat's the what's the quick win or\nwhat's the small win that we can make\nyes absolutely so so the 20% here is\nworking really hard to eliminate that\nultr processed food okay so really\nfocusing on how do you get fresh organic\nfood into your body as much as possible\nand I can tell you if you only make this\none change that's all you need to worry\nabout you don't need to worry about your\nprotein content and your micro nutrients\nlike all of that will come with just\nswitching from Ultra processed food to\norganic fresh Whole Foods and then if\nthat's the only one thing that you do\nyou you've had a massive wind that's\ngoing to give you the 80% of the result\nbecause it will force you to learn how\nto make good food quickly because we're\nall busy right so how do we make how do\nwe make a quick protein shake or how do\nwe make a quick salad and still get the\nnutrients in that we need to and not\nfeel hungry once you start doing that\nyou find that your hunger go goes down\njust exponentially you don't need to eat\nas often and you kind of eliminate you\nknow snacking is such a huge thing now\nit's almost like we're taught that if\nyou're not snacking you're not going to\nhave enough energy for the day and\nthat's only because we're snacking on\nprocessed food in between eating\nprocessed food right so so so really\nonce you start eating whole food again\nyou can even a lot of people just stop\neven eating one meal a day they go\nstraight into lunch and dinner I eat\nprotein every morning for my meals I I I\nneed to have protein in the morning most\npeople do and we could talk about\nfasting later too and kind of the change\nin thought around that but making that\none change is going to give you 80% of\nthe result in in my opinion and my\nexperience talking to hundreds of people\nabout this over the last year or two and\nthen there's two or three things you can\ndo after that once you got that down but\nthat would be number one for sure what\nare two and three okay so number two is\nmanaging your glucose response curve\ntalk about this yeah exactly so the\nscience has come extreme L far in this\nand what we know for a fact is first of\nall we know for a fact that metabolic\nsyndrome diabetes is rampant and is just\ngetting into more and more communities\nthroughout America all the time and\nthat's because of things like we talked\nabout snacking ultr processed food Etc\nbut it's also just people have forgotten\nhow to eat in a way that keeps your\nglucose curve under control now when I\nsay glucose curve that means that I'm\ntalking about like actually measuring\nyour glucose all the time and seeing\nwhen it goes up and when it Goes Down\nAnd so there's a device now that you can\nbuy it's called a continuous glucose\nmonitor have you worn one of these yet I\nhaven't but I've seen them yeah I think\nmy wife had one ah fantastic it is a\ngame Cher as far as I'm concerned I mean\nI don't recommend a lot of like you know\ntechnology and things until it's like\nreally proven and vetted but I really\nfeel you know this is something we've\nused for diabetics for years now but\nfinally people are starting to use it in\ntheir regular day life and you don't\nhave to wear it forever I just wear mine\nfor like 6 weeks and I found incredible\namounts of information about how to eat\nso for example one thing is you know we\nall sit down and we start with chips or\nbread right it's the absolute worst\nthing you can do you want to start with\nyour vegetables first that puts fiber\ninto your body and slows your digestive\ntract and then you do your protein and\nfats and last is the carbs okay because\nthat'll slow the release of glucose from\nthe carbs that's one of the things you\nlearn from wearing a continuous glucose\nmonitor you also learn from wearing a\ncontinuous glucose monitor\nwhat foods shoot your glucose through\nthe roof versus you know Ries or anybody\nelse's right and it's different like if\nyou eat a banana it could shoot your\nglucose to the roof and your friend no\nproblem at all and that's because your\nmicrobiome your metabolism is different\nthan every single other person so you\ncan personalize the foods that you eat\nto keep your glucose level steady and if\nyou keep your glucose level as steady as\npossible day after day after day and you\nknow you can cheat it's not like people\ndon't cheat we all like to eat a every\nonce in a while or cook but it really\nmakes you cognizant of what's Happening\ninternally and you know we live our life\nnot being cognizant of what's Happening\ninternally until we feel really really\nbad this really teaches you like how\nyour body is reacting to the food that\nyou eat so I recommend all my patients\nyou know six weeks of a continuous\nglucose monitor really learn how your\nglucose curves reacts to certain foods\nthere's a really good book out there\nit's uh called the glucose Revolution\nit's very well written you can read it\nin like 3 four hours about how to manage\nyour glucose curve I love that book I\ngive it to all my patients as well and\num I think you learn a lot so number two\nis managing your glucose curve well\nthat's fantastic you know what I love\ntalking to you because you make it sound\nso simple and accessible like whenever I\ntalk to you I find it so easy to\nunderstand what I need to do why I need\nto do it why it makes sense and I don't\nneed to be as well versed in what you're\ntalking about as you are right and it's\nnot overly technical in a way that I\ncan't WRA my head around it so I love\nhow practical you just made that\nespecially how we eat what's on our\nplate because I think so many of us\nspend so long trying to figure out like\noh maybe I shouldn't eat that and I\nshouldn't have that it's actually the\norder can make all the difference and\nnow everyone who's listening or watching\nmake sure that you don't go and start\nwith the the bread or the chips and you\nknow get the crudity instead exactly\nexactly that's why they serve it first\nor well now I guess they serve chips and\nguac first too but uh what was the\nnumber three so number three and number\nthree and number four it can be switched\naround based on your particular dietary\npattern but I would say number three is\nmaking sure you have adequate protein\nintake and a lot of people they diet and\nthey not just cut back on the you know\nthe carbs they eat the fats they eat but\nthey also cut back in the amount of\nprotein they eat and you lose weight on\nthe scale but you're losing more muscle\nmass and you're losing fat and that's a\ntravesty because you need your muscle\nmass to support not just support your\nbones and give you strength but it's\nalso one of the biggest organs in your\nbody that's preventing you from going\ninto diabetes cancer and dementia so\npreserving muscle mass is key so I have\nall of my patients buy this really cool\nscale that I like it's called the inbody\nh2n scale h20n scale and it's a scale\nthat you step on but you also grab under\nthese handlebars and it tells you your\nskeletal muscle mass okay so you can not\njust track your body fat percentage but\nalso your skeletal muscle mass and\nobviously you want to maintain your\nskeletal muscle mass especially the\nolder you get so the closer you get to\n40 and 50 you need to have a big store\nof skeletal muscle mass because it's\ngoing to decline we all start declining\nafter the age of 50 and it takes a lot\nof protein and a lot of strength\ntraining to make up for that Decline and\nyou want to maintain that skeletal\nmuscle mass number one thing to do is\nhave one gram per pound of body weight\nof protein per day broken up into three\nto four divided dosages okay so you do\nthat you step on this scale I like\nweighing myself every day I it gives you\nthat accountability Factor um and you\ncan track the data and make sure you're\nmaintaining skeletal muscle mass and if\nyou need to decreasing fat mass now one\ngram per pound of body weight like\npeople don't really know like how what\nis that really so look it up most people\nweigh you know somewhere around 150\npounds look up 150 grams of protein look\nthat up on Google and you'll see all\nsorts of infographics and it's it's a\nlot of protein it's not a small am\namount of protein and if you're\nvegetarian or vegan you can still do\nthis but you're going to probably need a\nlittle bit more because only about 80%\nof that is bioavailable protein so you\nwant to maybe even increase a little bit\nmore and once you see that infographic\nonce you see or just even like buy a\nlittle scale and measure out 150 grams\nof protein see what it is you're like oh\nwow I am really not getting enough\nprotein day to day you I've been\nthinking about that a lot lately myself\nI've been looking at that and Ry and I\nwere talking about it I was like yeah\nI'm not sure I'm getting as much protein\nas I need to be getting and I'm\nobviously plant-based so that was\nsomething that we were diving into what\nare the best plant-based sources of\nprotein that you're seeing and that\nactually add up to that amount not I\nknow what the sources are but it's\nalmost like how do you get that much of\nit yeah I mean you know you know where\nthe sources are like beans and Grains\nand all but also I myself and all my\nvegetarian and vegan friends I recommend\nyou know pea protein powder it's really\ngood it goes down easily put it put it\nlike you can even add it to like your\noatmeal and other other things that\nyou're eating and and you'll you'll\nstart building up you know and look the\nidea is not to get from like 10 grams of\nprotein a day all the way to 150 grams\nyou build up slowly over time and you\nsee what kind of works for you all of\nthis needs to be individualized and\nthat's why I like having like that data\npoint which is the bioimpedence scale\nthat inbody scale because you can see\nlike oh wow my skeletal muscle mass is\ngoing up I'm doing good now like here's\nwhere I need to be right you can really\npersonalize it for yourself okay\nfantastic this is this is already\nhelping me I I'm like listening to\neverything you're saying this is It's So\nrelatable and so so actionable\nimmediately which which is fantastic and\nI love the and I keep keep please keep\nsharing like the tools or the the\ngadgets that we can have or websites or\nbooks because I want all of our\ncommunity to feel really supported and\ngo okay that's what I haven't read yet\nor yeah absolutely and I have no\nFinancial like hookup with any of these\ncompanies I'll tell you if I do but this\nis the stuff that I love and I've seen\nmy patients really take to as well so\nI'm going to I'm going to blurt them out\nand I think it's fantastic do your\nresearch you know but yeah yeah let's\ntalk a bit about supplements and\nVitamins because I think that there's a\nlot of like mixed messaging out there\nabout what's needed how much of it's\nneeded some people are like well none of\nit really gets absorbed and does it make\na difference and there there's always a\ndebate about it how do you go about\nfiguring out what someone needs as an\nindividual as opposed to just taking\nwhat everyone's taking because you keep\nhearing about it everywhere yeah that\nthat's such a great question and we\ncan't even talk about that Jay without\ntalking about number four on the list\nwhich was vegetables all right and I'll\ntell you why so the fourth thing which\nis as important as protein is getting\nenough vegetables in your diet on a\ndaily basis so do you know how much that\nis by chance I don't I mean I have a lot\nof vegetables right but I have no idea\nso you're going to have to tell me right\nit's a lot a lot of people really know\nlike what's the right amount and really\nthe amount of vegetables you eat has a\nlot to do with the amount of fiber\nintake you need which 90% of America\ndoesn't get enough fiber and fiber is a\ncritical ingredient of our diet secondly\nthat's where most of our micronutrients\nand phytonutrients are as in those\nvegetables thirdly they just keep you\nfull and satiated all the time as well\nso getting enough vegetables in your\ndiet is extremely important the number\nthat I've seen in a lot of um Fitness\nand Nutrition gurus talk about is it's a\nbig number it's like 800 grams of\nvegetables which is about you know a\nquart of vegetables right so once again\nget your scale and measure this out and\nsee what it is it's it's not a small\namount it's like two full salads a day\nbut that's kind of what we need to work\nup to so if you're doing that the need\nfor supplementation is minimal To None\nactually I'm not a big supplement Pusher\nI'd much rather people get it in your\ndiet the reality of the situation is\nhowever it's really hard to get that\nmuch protein and that much vegetable\nproduct into your diet right and of\ncourse we can't talk about vegetables\nwithout talking about making sure you're\nbuying organic you know you're buying as\nlocal as possible um and if you can't go\nto ewg.org environmental working groups\nwebsite they'll give you a list of what\nare the most toxic vegetables and the\nleast toxic out there right now so look\nat that website and I'll give you the\nlist so if you're not getting enough uh\nvegetable intake into your diet the next\nstep is to add some supplementation to\nthat the most common supplements I\nrecommend for people are vitamin D um we\ndon't get enough sunlight to produce it\nwe're not getting enough in our diets so\nmost people do need some vitamin D it\nneeds to be dialed in based on a blood\ntest so you do a blood test I like the\nvitamin D level to be around 50 to 80\nand the vitamin D form that I like\npeople to take is vitamin D3 K2 the K2\nis also another vitamin add add it in it\nprevents over absorption of calcium with\nthe vitamin D and deposition of calcium\nin your blood vessels so vitamin D3 K2\nthen fish oil supplement as well for the\nvegetarians and vegans out there there's\nsome great non fish sources of fish oil\nas well so I would do that as well\nmagnesium is something that we're all\nvery deficient in so I would do\nmagnesium as well and then creatine\nbelieve it or not it's amino acid that\nhas a lot of research behind it do you\ndo creatine yeah fantastic yeah 5 to 8\nmilligrams every morning just put a\nscoop in your coffee and mixes in with\nanything I think that's another really\ninteresting good one and then I kind of\nthen you know kind of do it based on\nwhat I ate the day before right so if I\ngot couple good salads in fine I don't\nneed to do anything else if I didn't\nI'll take a packet of ag1 which is like\na phytonutrient powder which I really\nlike and or a multivitamin sometimes as\nwell I'll do that too and then protein\npowders or pretty much always a staple\nfor me as well that's the other\nsupplement that I use you're just\nputting that onto other stuff yeah\nputting that onto other stuff putting\nthat into a shake you know shakes are\nvery convenient there's a really good\nprotein powder I like called super gut\nit's actually a resistant starch and a\nprotein powder and fiber all in one like\nbag and so super gut is a fantastic like\nrescue product I have like if I've been\non a plane for eight hours or something\nyou know and I just come home and just\ntake that and I get my nutrition in and\nthat's pretty much it you know there's\nother things you can do like if you're\nhaving trouble sleeping there's\nashwagandha there's glycine if you're\nhaving trouble with stress ashwaganda is\nanother good one for that but then I'm\nreally selective about which ones to use\nyeah great those are fantastic that's a\nreally good breakdown for anyone I mean\nI remember when I first started\nmeasuring that with Mona is like my\nvitamin D which you would never have\nknown if you met me or saw me was 10\nyeah and it was just like I was living\nmy life like I was on planes I was\ngiving Keynotes I was I was healthy I\nwas energetic whatever and she was just\nlike I don't even know how you function\nI was out of 10 it was like it was and I\nwas unaware how old were you when you do\nthis this is oh this was like a year and\na half ago two years ago yeah like it\nwas just interesting to me because the\nonly thing I could feel is like I was\nfeeling a bit of fatigue and that was\nthe only thing and that's why I think\nthat the reason why I'm raising that for\nmy audience and Community here today is\ndon't take it for granted and don't\nassume that you might be like I don't\nneed any of these vitamin supplements\nit's like it could be the tiniest thing\nthat you're experiencing as a symptom\nit's important to take it seriously\nbecause you don't want to be at a 10 you\nbring up an extremely good point a\ncouple points I want to make here one is\nyou have to become the CEO of your own\nhealth and what I mean by that is a CEO\nmanages a business by looking at numbers\non a daily basis right most people\nmanage their health based on a feeling\nthat they have symptoms that they have\nthey're not looking at numbers so\nbecoming this CEO of your own health\nmeans knowing what are the key kpis of\nyour health there's only about 10 of\nthem skeletal muscle mass being one of\nthem body fat percentage being another\nvitamin D level being another you got to\nkeep that dialed in right because the\nother point I want to make with you is\nthat when your vitamin D level is low\nlike at this age and you don't take care\nof it for 20 to 30 years that's when the\nlack of vitamin D leads to the higher\nrisk of Alzheimer's leads to the higher\nrisk of heart attack leads to the higher\nrisk of hormone problems it all started\n20 to 30 years before when you barely\nfelt it you see what I mean so looking\nat those numbers 20 to 30 years ahead of\nbecoming sick is the key to becoming CEO\nof your own health and then making all\nthose diseas is a non-issue making all\nthe things that people die of a\nnon-issue fantastic yeah no I cann't\nagree more and I'm so glad you made that\nconnection because I think it often when\nyou find it out long term you then feels\nlike a surprise right but actually it\nisn't if you're looking at the numbers\nand I think we just haven't been trained\nto look at our health in terms of\nnumbers like you'd measure your height\ngrowing up or you'd measure your weight\ngrowing up but those are such poor\nindicators of Health in and of\nthemselves without looking at all of\nthese other metrics that we're talking\nabout here today whether it's your\nglucose levels whether it's your vitamin\nD levels magnesium Etc you mentioned so\nmany other vitamins and supplements I\njust don't think we're trained to know\nwhere to look and what to look at and\ntherefore we're basing it on I feel\ntired today I feel and I think this is\nsomething I want to mention as well that\nthe mind and the body are so connected\nbut I think so often our physical\nchallenges we think are a mental\nchallenge so we think we're tired\nbecause we have we're not focused enough\nor we're not excited enough or we're not\nmotivated enough we make the physical\nissue a mental issue but it isn't it's\npurely a physical and I know that\nbecause I feel so purposeful and love\nwhat I do and I'm so joyful about it and\nI'm so so excited about it so if my\nbody's not working to the degree I want\nit to I'm very clear that you can have\nall the mental stuff down but if you're\nnot taking care of your body it doesn't\njust you can push it a bit further but\nthat's not going to get you up the hill\nso no you're absolutely right there's\nwhen your brain starts feeling it\nusually your body is in big trouble yeah\nthat's when you start feeling it so you\nknow I think your point about the\nnumbers is so it resonates with me\nbecause that's what happened to me when\nI became sick I outsourced my numbers to\nmy primary care doctor and my you know\nconsur medicine doctor and they got my\nnumbers back they looked at them and you\nknow you get these if you've ever seen\nyour blood worksheet like if something\nis out of range it turns red otherwise\nit's all black it's all like a bunch of\nnumbers right and so because things were\nlike barely in the red and not moving\nthey decided not to even talk to me\nabout them right but in reality things\nwere changing for a long time and going\nin the wrong direction and that's\nbecause Western medicine can't really do\nanything about that number until they\ncan prescribe you a pill for it and that\npill only comes when it's disease time\nthat's the problem and I also think\npeople get overwhelmed with the with the\nnumbers because you know most people you\ndon't know what these numbers mean so\nwhat I really try to do with my patients\nis give them like 10 numbers these are\nthe 10 numbers you need to watch and why\nand I think that makes it a lot easier\nfor them so I give them a spreadsheet I\nlet them watch their own numbers and I\nthink it's important for them to watch\ntheir own pH numbers rather than\nOutsource their health to their\nphysician because they need to know\nwhere the optimal range is not just the\ndisease range right so let me just give\nyou one more real quick on the glucose\num point because it's a really important\none it's a hemoglobin A1c and you\nprobably heard of this before too it's a\nmeasure of your last three months\naverage of glucose and you're\npre-diabetic when this number is 5.7 and\nyour diabetic when is 6.5 or above my\nnumber was 5.7 and he just put me on a\nmedication but five years ago I had\nmeasured this with my doctor and it had\ngone from 4.7 to 5.0 to 5.2 to 5.3 to\n5.4 and no one said anything to me you\nknow and I could have done something\nabout it back then before I had to now\nit's an emergency right so I think\nthat's another number people should\nwatch uh nutrition wise is that\nhemoglobin A1c number and I guarantee\nyou if people call their doctors and ask\nfor their latest blood work result it's\non there or it should be if it's not on\nthere you have a bigger problem but it\nshould be on there and you'll see kind\nof where you're at you know oh this is\nfantastic Dr sha thank you so much all\nright I want to dive into let's do\nexercise next you brought that up I want\nto dive into it and if I if there's any\never time when you want to go back or sh\nsomething feel free you know this is all\nabout giving the most value to everyone\nwho's listening and watching right when\nwe talk about exercise I think\neveryone's kind of always known they\nneed to exercise one of the things I\nlove before we start talking about about\nthe technicality of it you talk a lot\nabout the need for social exercising\nwhich I love that because\nrecently I've been playing so much\npickle ball with friends I don't know if\nyou've been playing as well I got to\nplay pickle ball with you I love pickle\nball yeah and it's just it is like I\nhave played at this point today I don't\nI'm not playing today the I played the\nlast five days in a row every day I\nprobably played for an average of two\nhours a day on average some days were\nthree some days was one\nand it is such an easy workout because\nyou're just running around you're\nsweating you're having a good time with\nfriends you're outdoors and I've I've\nmade it a priority in my life that all\nof my friendships this year we're going\nto do something active together so\ninstead of getting together and sitting\ndown and eating dinner even though I\nlove doing that we're actually going to\ngo on a hike instead or we're going to\ngo on a walk and if I don't feel like\ngoing on a hike or a walk then at least\nwe're just going to do something active\nwhether it be an escape room so that\nwe're moving around around or if it is\nthat I have enough energy to play pickle\nball we're doing that the idea is how\ncan every friendship be based on Fitness\nthat is also fun rather than friendship\nwhich is based on us sitting on a couch\nwatching a movie together which by the\nway I still do as well but that can't be\nthe primary way to hang out such an\nincredibly good point and um I just\nspent the last weekend in ohigh with a\nwith some of my friends and literally\nlike we would not sit down until we all\nhit 10,000 steps you know for for the\nday and pick was part of it hiking was\npart of it and you know the old adage is\nso true you become the average of the\neight people you surround yourself with\nright and so of the eight people you're\nfriends with like my community of\nfriends we work out together that is our\nsocial activity and it's so much fun we\nfind different things to do you know\nwe're lucky we live in the hills and we\ncan hike together we can go to these\nreally fun gyms together but it makes\nexercise not exercise I think what\nhappens and why people don't get enough\nexercise is because exercise is\nliterally like going to the gym by\nyourself and it's not inspiring a lot of\ntimes when you go to the gym if you\ndon't especially if you don't have a\ntrainer you know and social exercise for\nme was the cure to not getting enough\nmovement in my day absolutely yeah it's\nhuge and tell us about let's talk about\nwhat type of movement is needed because\nI think again we have so many\npreconceived notions exercise in\nsomeone's head could be like\nweightlifting what it looks like\nexercise could be doing a high-intensity\nworkout at a gym exercise could mean a\nsport what movement do we actually need\nto genuinely be healthy in a real way\nbecause you could be doing any or none\nof these things and you could or could\nnot be healthy so what is that what do\nwe actually need what do our bodies need\nI love this question because it's\ncounterintuitive okay so people are\nalways like what do I need to do I go to\nthe gym how many sets and Reps and\nminutes on the treadon do I need and I\ntell them wait once again PTO principal\nall you have to do is move all day long\nso sedentary Behavior which means\nsitting for more than an hour at a time\nfor eight hours a day is literally\nwhat's killing most of us right now and\nso what happens is most people have an\neight- hour job right out of that eight-\nhour job they'll sit for two hours maybe\nget up for to go to the bathroom sit\ndown for two or three hours again have\nlunch with they're sitting so just\nsitting for long periods of time\nincreases your rate of mortality\nexponentially so for every 10%\nadditional time you spend sitting you\nhave an increase of 10% in your all\ncause mortality and it's like linear\nwait say that again yeah for every 10%\nof time that you spend sitting over a\nbaseline you have a 10% increase in all\ncause mortality big studies yeah it's\ncrazy how much sitting or just moving\nchanges the entire equation so once you\ngo from being sary to not sedentary your\nrate of death from heart attacks from\nAlzheimer's and Dementia from stroke\nfrom Anything Goes Down exponentially so\nwhat I tell people is no matter what\nevery 45 minutes you need to take an\nexercise snack and this has been proven\nin research as well every 45 minutes\nspend 10 minutes getting up and walking\naround a little bit and and if you do\nthat you've broken the cycle of\nsedentary Behavior completely so what I\ndo is I have my patients buy like a\nlittle egg timer like a little metal it\nlooks like an egg and we just set it to\n45 put it down and when it rings you get\nup walk around and guess what that's the\nsame amount of time needed to break the\nstrain on your eyes to break the stress\ncycle as well so it's a really good idea\nto take these exercise snacks when\nyou're at home I'm sorry when you're at\nwork but then also when you're at home\npeople sit down and watch you know TV\nfor two hours so it happens again so\nthat's Step One is don't be sedentary\neven athletes there's so many athletes\nthat are sedentary during the day like\nor during the evening that um they're\naffected by this as well so focus on\nthat first don't be sedentary then step\ntwo on exercise is now what kind of\nactivity can we put in to really start\nlike moving the needle with how exercise\ncan improve your longevity and health\nspan so do you want me to talk about\nthat a little bit too yeah before you\ndive into that there's something that\nI'm really glad to hear that because one\nthing I've been recommending to a lot of\nmy corporate clients is I don't know who\ninvented 30 minute and 60 Minute\nmeetings I just don't know where that\ncame from we just invent these things\nwhere they have to be that long and I've\nstarted saying to so many of my clients\nwho are living like I don't live a\nmeeting to meeting life anymore so I get\na lot of movement I'll stand up I'll\nwalk over there I'll walk back I'll walk\nnext door I'll jump in a car we'll walk\nto the meeting so I thankfully have a\nlot of movement in my day but when I\nused to work in the corporate world I\nused to always tell everyone have a 55\nminute meeting or have a 25 minute\nmeeting that then gives you an extra 5\nminutes to stand up to walk to get\nhydrated to look out of a window or\nmaybe get some fresh air and then to\nlook out into the distance so that\nyou're not constantly shortsighted I\nfeel today we're constantly looking at\nour phone at our laptop at an iPad and\nwe're becoming more and more\nshortsighted and that's why it kind of\nfeels like our mind can feel a bit\ncrowded and clouded and to me just going\noutside and looking out into the\ndistance maybe spotting a bird a cloud a\ndistant building it just opens up the\nmind a little bit and I feel like just\nshifting it from having 5 minutes off\nevery hour which isn't going to\nnegatively impact a meeting you're not\ngoing to achieve anything more in that\nextra five minutes and same with if you\ntook 15 minutes off a meeting maybe if\nmeeting shifted to being 45 not an hour\nI think you'd achieve so much more in\nthe meeting too because now you have\nless time and so I just think there's so\nmuch there and I just want to give\npeople more value on that that it's so\neasy and practical to implement some of\nthis\nand a lot of it's just breaking these\nold rules that have just lasted for far\ntoo long yeah so true and you must have\ntalked to Google about this because on\nGoogle Calendar you can program 25\nminute meetings did you know that or I\ndidn't know that yeah or 55 minute\nmeetings so every meeting is\nautomatically like cut short by five or\n10 minutes oh I didn't know that yeah\nand then what I tell people to do too is\nswitch from a regular Zoom account to\nthe free Zoom account because it kicks\nyou off in 40\nminutes that's F like sorry guys I got\nto go I'm running out of time yeah you\nmight look cheap but it will save your\nhealth yeah but um on that one more\ndouble click on that point too is that\nif you do have a life where you have to\nspend a lot of time at your desk um on\nthe computer on meetings really consider\ngetting a treadmill desk or a walking\ndesk that's been a game changer for me\ntoo like I'll I'll get 25 30,000 steps\nin after three hours of meetings you\nknow it's pretty pretty incredible\namount of steps yeah wow that's amazing\nall right sorry so go for number two on\nthe ex okay so number two I was think\nthe most important um thing that you can\nfirst start doing in an exercise routine\nis strength training especially after\nthe age of 40 muscle breakdown is a root\nof all physical problems and Frailty as\nwe age and so really getting into a good\nstrength training routine is key and\nthen secondly you want to work on your\ncardio right and cardio really need to\nthink about it in two prongs there's\nanerobic and aerobic and um anerobic is\nbasically you know working really hard\nand then you have the aerobic where\nyou're not working working is hard and\nyou're utilizing oxygen to make energy\nso the way you do your anerobic I like\nusing hit exercises there's anerobic\ntraining protocols Sports I guess sports\nright exactly where you're working\nreally hard you don't have to do a lot\nof that every week but you you do need\nto get some of that in every every week\nand then I really like what Peter AA\nsays about zone two aerobic exercise\nlike getting 30 to 45 minutes a day into\nstart every other day or so I think\nthat's important but look it's so hard\nfor people to fit all this into their\nlife right so you got to make it as easy\nas possible so there's like these s\nminute hit routine apps that you can do\nwhich are fantastic getting a set of\nbarbells and putting them in your closet\nor your bedroom so every time you go\nthere you do 15 20 like you know Arnold\npresses or something even that as long\nas it's consistent and done on a daily\nbasis for busy people is going to be\nextremely helpful I think a lot of\npeople think like it's either go to the\ngym for an hour three to four days a\nweek or just give up completely yeah and\nnothing could be farther from the truth\nright yeah and you're saying literally\nhaving something at your office desk\nhaving something in your bedroom just\njust a little bit of addition to your\nalready busy life is going to make a\ndifference and we need to stop having\nthis glorified view of going to the gym\nand having The Perfect Workout routine\nright how do we get how do we get how\nhave you found people get rid of that\nperfectionist mentality when it comes to\nhealth because I feel like we also have\nit with food we have it we we're on we\ntalked about nutrition we have it with\nexercise where it's like I'm gonna eat\nreally healthy or I'm gonna eat really\nbad like if I had a pizza too many days\nin a row I might as well just carry on\neating pizza because oh it's not going\nto matter that I had vegetables for one\nday although you would argue it does\nmatter and that one day of breaking the\ncycle is probably useful how have you\nworked with clients on that mental\naspect of it because that's obviously\nwhat I focus on in my work so much I'd\nlove to hear about it from yours yeah\nyou know it's there's a lot of science\naround habit building and routine\nbuilding um Atomic habits is a great\nbook that I read there's a couple others\nthat I really like and is this kind of\nlike this reward and cycle that you\nreward yourself over you have to\nconsistently reward yourself on a daily\nbasis for doing the right things and\nthen not punish yourself for doing the\nwrong things and so I think there's a\nlot of psychology around that it's it's\nhonestly it's really hard I I mean we\nfind it hard for ourselves too right but\nI really believe in having a positive\nattitude about it I think if you come at\nit with positivity and say you know what\nit's fine I messed up but I'm going to\ndo it and you you're just positive about\nit that in itself is a psychological\nbarrier broken into starting today as a\nfirst day of your life to start building\nnew habits again absolutely right\nabsolutely yeah it's uh I think I can't\nremember who said it but I've heard the\nrock say it plenty of times he's like\nit's either one day or day one right and\nyou'll always quote that right it's a\nmindset like it's either one day we'll\nget to it one day I'll do it one day or\nit's like no today's day one this is the\nday that I'm going to solve it and start\nit and I think that's that positive\nmindset you're speaking yeah exactly uh\nwas there a point three an exercise that\nyou wanted to make I I'm sure there's a\ns but was there another one you wanted\nto kind of we should probably stop there\non exercise there's ABS there's\nabsolutely more you can do as you get\nolder you know your audience spans all\nages and everyone as you get older you\nreally want to look at stability and\nbalance so I try to do stability and\nbalance exercises on a daily basis as\nwell things like standing on one foot\nbelieve it or not yeah just things like\nthat as we get older we lose that and if\nyou're not training it especially after\nthe age of 50 you're going to keep\nlosing it and then the number one killer\nof older people is becoming frail\nfalling because they lose their balance\nand breaking a hip or a bone that's what\nusually takes out most older people and\nso you can avoid that by incorporating\nsome stability balance routines in your\nlife I really appreciate you also\nlooking at it from the perspective of\nlike let's stop there because I I I\nthink so often people listen to podcasts\nor read books there's just so much\ninformation and then that makes us go\nall right I don't know where to start\nand so I love the fact that you're like\nwell wait a minute let's just this is\nstep one this is stage two I love that\nvery curriculum systematic based\napproach to mastering our health rather\nthan starting on point number seven and\nthen figuring it out so and like what I\ndo with my patients is like we're having\nthis conversation about everything but\nI'll only give them one thing to do\nright and like we'll change two or three\nthings and then you come back and we'll\ndo the next thing and then the next\nthing so let's not worry about how much\nprotein you have in your diet until you\nclean out your pantry and get rid of all\nthe crap in your pantry right let's do\nthat first and then let's talk again\nnext week and so we take it at a\nstepwise approach but if whoever's\nlistening to this you know if you're\ntaking notes don't try to implement all\nof it at the same time you're get\noverwhelmed and quit yes absolutely\nabsolutely all right let's talk about\nsleep mhm so I've generally been a good\nsleeper my whole life and very grateful\nfor that how do you know by measuring as\nI was going to say by measuring not by\nhow I feel by measuring I I wanted to\ntalk about an experience that I had that\nwas bad which was surprising for me so I\nwas wearing the aura ring for a long\ntime measuring my sleep and I was\nscoring really well and then during the\npandemic we moved home and we were\nrenting a place that\nwas really disruptive at night we'd get\nreal animals in the floorboards in the\nwalls there was lots of noises\noutside I often because of where we were\nand there were certain things about it\nthat I was worried that what if someone\nbroke in and you know there were these\nother anxieties that I had around it and\nit was the first time in my life that I\nthink I consecutively had one and a half\nyears of bad sleep during the pandemic\nand it was really interesting because I\nwas doing my supplements I was eating\nright I've always meditated I was doing\neverything and just this one\nundercurrent man I was fatigued I was\nexhausted I was irritable like it was so\nit was so intense because I just wasn't\nsleeping deeply and I'd often wake up\nmultiple times per night and that wasn't\nnormal for me and I also was wearing the\naura ring at that time and it was my\nsleep score was just not great and that\nwas actually what forced me to move to\nthis place and and get this home because\nI was just like I was I was telling rad\nI was like I need to leave like it was\nthat bad and so I know what it feels\nlike to have good sleep and bad sleep\nsleep and I think that sleep is one of\nthose areas of our health that we\nunderestimate in terms of how great it\ncan be but I think so many of us\nstruggle with sleep whether it be\nanxiety whether it be insomnia whether\nit be stress and so I want to start off\nby talking about tracking your sleep and\nimproving the environment that we sleep\nin at least as a starting point but I do\nwant to get to two and three with you\ntoday on your list because I do think\nthere are people who are trying to do\nall that stuff but there's still\nsomething not clicking and I'm sure\nyou've experienced this a million times\nwith clients so let's start at step one\nand then see where we go from there\nright so I agree with you like tracking\nis a game Cher but I can also tell you\nthat I've had a lot of patients that get\nsuper anxious tracking and they live and\ndie by those numbers right so if you're\none of those people that the overt\ntracking of sleep kind of changes your\nday and changes your perspective on your\nday only use tracking for a very\nspecified amount of time use it for when\nyou are very mindfully changing your\nsleep habits and your routines and then\nstop weing it once you got your sleep\nscore up to a score that you like right\nI personally I I like tracking my sleep\nall the time I'm just a real data guy so\nI like to see it but when I go on\nvacation now I don't wear my aura ring\nbecause I know that the sleeve's not\ngoing to be his good sometimes right um\nso so you know I use it I use it for\nwhen I'm being mindful about trying to\nget better sleep or if something's\nchanged like I noticed\num I had Co um and right after Co I had\nlong covid and my heart rate was racing\nfor months I'm sorry to hear that yeah\nit was horrible and um um it really\naffected my sleep but my aura ring told\nme that this is what's happening this is\nwhy you're not sleeping well your heart\nrate is is racing so I think the benefit\nof sleep tracking is really\nunderstanding it's not just the number\nof hours you're sleeping it's really the\nsleep pattern and educating yourself on\nthat sleep pattern um Aura does a good\njob whoop does a good job the eight\nsleep Bess has a phenomenal tracker\neight sleep's great is great I love it\nyeah and um you know understanding how\nmuch deep sleep you need where that deep\nsleep needs to be in your sleep night\nand understanding things like heart rate\nvariability and an average heart rate at\nnight is a GameChanger right while\nyou're modifying your sleep environment\nand your routine so once we get that in\nplace then the second thing we do is we\nabsolutely make sure the person doesn't\nhave sleep apnea all right so for those\nof you who don't know what sleep apnea\nis that's when you stop breathing at\nnight your body physically stops taking\nin oxygen you don't have oxygen in your\nbody for for a few seconds at a time but\nall night long that affects your brain\nyour heart virtually every organ in your\nbody so many people have sleep apnea and\ndon't recognize it and it's really sad\nbecause it's causing basically I tell\nthem it's causing a slow death believe\nit or not if you have sleep aptia you\nhave to get it treated right away\nthere's lots of different ways of\ntreating it there's Dental appliances\nthere's you know that CPAP mask you can\nwear there's surgery but you got to\nfigure it out because no matter what you\ndo not going to go people could notice\nright so the symptoms of sleep apnea are\nnumber one you wake up gasping for air\nin the middle of the night or you're\nsignificant other your sleeping with\ntells you that secondly you wake up\nreally tired every morning and you and\nyou have daytime somulin so you're just\nkind of falling asleep a few hours after\nyou've woken up even snoring very loudly\ncan indicate sleep apnea as well so if\nyou know your spouse whoever tells you\nyou're snoring really a lot um and then\nthere's a questionnaire you can take\nonline it's a very simple questionnaire\ncalled a stop bang questionnaire St o p\nb NJ just Google that and you take the\nquestionnaire it'll give you a score and\nit'll tell you if you need to be\nevaluated for sleep apnea so being\nevaluated for sleep apnea now is much\neasier people used to dread going to a\nsleep lab and getting all the wires put\non them now you just wear like a little\ndevice on your finger overnight at home\nand we can get a good idea if you have\nsleep apne or not and the Sleep doctors\nare very good at treating this now as\nwell wow and you're saying there's\ndifferent types of uh therapy or there's\ndifferent types of treatments forat\nsorry treatments for yeah yeah there's\nthere's stuff you can get from your\ndentist like a little Dental appliance\nthat pulls your jaw forward there's a\nCPAP mask there's also surgeries that\nyou can do as well losing weight special\npillows propping your there's lots of\nthings you can do wow okay yeah that I\ncan't believe that it's it's so\nfascinating right again because these\nthings haven't been measured since we\nwere young and because we don't know\nwhat to look out for you could be\nsitting there for months or years going\nwhy do I wake up feeling like this maybe\nI'm anxious maybe I'm stressed and that\ncould be a part of it but there's\nsomething else going on as well yeah I\ncan tell you how many people that I\nsimply asked a few questions I just\nasked you and they're like yeah I have\nthat yeah I have that it's like a\nrevelation and they're 55 years old and\nthey have sleep apnea they've had it for\n25 years so it's really sad how\nunderdiagnosed it is and how incredibly\ntreatable it is and that could change\nthe trajectory of your life you know\nbecause once you treat sleep apnea your\nmetabolism actually gets under control\nand you start losing weight you start\nhaving less glucose spikes you start um\neating better you you feel less brain\nfog and then you also prevent Al sleep\napne is one of the main risk factors for\nAlzheimer's disease so you prevent\nAlzheimers do so once again is knowing\nearly and treating Things Early what if\nsomeone's they they okay just about\ngetting to sleep but that they wake up\nmultiple times when they're sleeping\nwhat have you found to be useful for\nsomeone in that scenario have you\ntreated worked with anyone who has that\nI've just met so many more people these\ndays that are not telling me they can't\nsleep they're saying I can sleep but\nthen I'm waking up and then waking up\nand these aren't people with kids or\nanything so this is like a you know it's\njust how they're feeling three main\nreasons for it I normally say one is\nnocturia where they have to get up in\nthe moment night to go to the bathroom\nand so there's medications and exercises\nyou can do to treat that the second\nreason is going to bed with anxiety and\nstresses on your mind so what I tell\npeople to do is number one no\nelectronics and maybe even no TV before\ngoing to bed because that can keep you\nthinking but keep a notebook by the side\nof your bed if you're one of these busy\npeople that you have so many things\ngoing through your head write them all\ndown and then you'll at least you know\ndownload that on a piece of paper and\nhopefully get it out of your head but\nthe third thing that I find that really\ndoes this too is eating or drinking a\nlittle bit too close to your sleep you\nhave this kind of glucose surge that\nhappens after you get to bed and it just\nwakes you up too so really making sure\nthose three to four hours between your\nlast meal and going going to bed is key\nyeah and I'm I'm so glad you brought up\nthe devices and conversation because I\nwas talking to a lot of people when when\npeople have been saying to me J I'm\nexperiencing anxiety one question that I\noften ask people is what did you watch\nlast night and there are some people in\nthe world who can watch the craziest\nscariest eeriest things and not feel\nanything and there are people who watch\nthose things and it puts these\nCliffhanger chemicals as I like to call\nthem into your body which constantly\nputs you on that Cliffhanger which keeps\nyou up that makes you wake up with this\nstate of fright I was just at we went to\nwatch Oppenheimer a couple of weeks ago\nand we were watching the trailers and\nThe Exorcist trailer came out there's\nanother exist movie and rad just sat\nthere like this if you're not if you're\nwatching ing sorry if you're listening\nthen I'm closing my eyes and my ears and\nR literally sat there like that and she\nwas like just tell me when it's done cuz\nshe doesn't want to watch it and that\nthat trailer was far too long for a\ntrailer I felt like it told me the whole\nmovie was one of those trailers so for\nRI she knows that she's aware of that\nand so she won't watch and consume\ncontent like that I can watch it and\nlaugh it off and be fine and it won't\naffect me unless I'm watching it every\nday and I think it's so important that\nwe we check ourselves that way because\nyou're just making it harder for\nyourself in a way you don't need to\nright absolutely I'm one of those people\nI can't watch horror movies anymore it\njust affects me way too much it sticks\nin my head I actually become a scaredy\ncat at night and I can't sleep so I just\ndon't even entertain the thought of\nwatching like even a trailer I'd\nprobably close my eyes with that trailer\ntrailer was haunted that was like do not\nwatch the new exus trailer if you want\nto sleep at night that like it stayed\nwith me for a while but uh no that's\ngreat anything else on sleep that you\nfeel as as that one two three as we're\ngoing in yeah so number one is sleep\napnea make sure you don't have it as\nyou're tracking your sleep two and three\nare fix your sleep environment and fix\nyour sleep routine so your sleep\nenvironment needs to be like how our\nancestors slept when they were cavemen a\ncold dark cave right so turn the\ntemperature down in your room what's\neven better than turning it down in your\nroom is buying like an eight sleep or\nsomething that keeps your bed cool\nitself but it should be somewhere around\n65° dark like totally dark like even the\nlittle red lights and alarm clock cover\nthem with black electrical tape and put\nthem in a different room and then quiet\nand most people can't get it fully quiet\nor some people like the quiet even\nbecomes like it becomes noise to them so\na sound machine like a white noise\nmachine is very very effective in\nimproving your sleep and what's really\ncool about doing these things is you can\ndo like one thing and see how it affects\nyour sleep score and then a week later\nbuy a white noise machine and see what\nhappens to your sleep score like you\nmight not feel it physically the next\nday but tracker will tell you like you\nwent up from 85 to 95 just by buying a\nwhite noise machine and I've seen it\nhappen over and over again so your sleep\nroutine what I like to tell people is\nyour sleep routine actually starts the\nmoment you wake up and there's probably\nlike only 3% of people that the moment\nthey wake up they actually go outside\nand expose themselves to Sun right most\npeople just they go from being inside to\ngoing in their garage getting in their\ncar going to work parking in the garage\nright like no one goes outside anymore\nin the\nI make it a point to take me and my kids\noutside first thing in the morning\nexpose yourself to sunlight that sets\nyour circadian rhythm your melatonin is\ngoing to start secreting like 14 hours\nafterwards that's key sleep routine\nstarts first thing in the morning and\nthen you know how the iPhone now has\nlike a sleep alarm right so like it's\nnot an alarm clock to wake you up it's\nwhen you need to start preparing for\nsleep so when that alarm goes off two\nhours before sleep all the lights turn\noff as much as possible switch on some\nyou know Soft Orange colored bulbs\ninstead and just start winding down your\nbrain you know a big part of that is\navoiding electronic devices absolutely\nyeah great advice no great great advice\nand all things that I've been practicing\nI used to I used to worry about sleeping\nat 65 degrees because I think it would\nfeel cold and what I always remind\npeople is you still have your duvet you\nstill have your blanket over you like\nyou don't you don't have to be cold uh\nyou can still wear pajamas right like\nit's just cooler in the room and that's\nbeen done wonders for my sleep even for\nsleeping in longer and and being more\ncomfortable the cave likee Darkness has\nalways been a a big win for me and and\nhuge and I think that the we've always\ntried to have very early dinners and\nthat's been such a huge thing of like we\ntry and eat dinner like 600 6:30 p.m.\njust so that when you're in bed at 9:30\nthat it's you know easier to go to sleep\nbut right all things we've had to work\non over time and adjust and figure out\nand it's not always perfect and you know\nit's yeah and part of like the eating\ndinner earlier thing too is our caveman\nancestors didn't eat after it became\ndark right and so it's really food is\nanother item that sets your circadian\nclock almost as much as light does as\nwell so that's that's a key factor\neating earlier but yeah it's all little\nthings and one at a time and you know\nyou're not going to change everything\novernight it might take a year but it\nbenefits you for the next 50 yeah right\nabsolutely absolutely I want to dive\ninto so there's a few areas left and I I\nwant to take bits and pieces of all of\nthem I don't want to do all of them but\nI want to dive into gut health just\nbecause it's\nso I didn't realize for years I was\nhaving gut issues because I just didn't\nknow what that even meant I didn't know\nhow to know I think today now people are\nmuch more informed I'm talking about\nlike 10 13 15 years ago when I didn't\nfeel it was in the Zeitgeist or the\nconversation as much uh how can someone\nbe conscious and aware if they're not\nalready that they may have leaky gut\nthat they may have gut issues that\nthey're not fully conscious or aware of\nor they're being negligent I was one of\nthose people who even if there was some\ndiscomfort I would just write it off\nbecause you're young and you're fit and\nyou're healthy and you don't care about\nit too much what should people be\nlooking out for yeah no that's that's a\nreally good point and um once again you\nknow by the time you become symptomatic\nfrom some of this stuff a lot of damage\nhas already been done for a long period\nof time right and so what I look at here\nis another one of those biomarkers one\nof those CEO of your own health type of\nthings which is a biomarker called HS\nCRP highly sensitive C reactive protein\nthis is a marker of inflammation um it's\na very simple test that every doctor lab\ncan do we've been doing it for like 50\n60 years in medicine but it's a marker\nof inflamation you want this number as\nclose as zero as possible but a lot of\ntimes it'll go up to one two three or\nfour and usually that comes from some\nsort of situation going on in your gut\nso your gut is the biggest organ in your\nbody protecting you from the side\nenvironment most people think it's your\nskin but your gut actually has four or\nfive times the surface area of your skin\ndoes and so when that barrier to the\noutside environment is\ndisrupted toxins from the outside\nenvironment filter into your bloodstream\ncausing inflammation inflammation is\nwhen your immune system is overactive\nand you not only destroy the toxins but\nyou start destroying your normal brain\nheart muscle bone cells all of it so you\nneed to know when you have inflammation\ngoing on in your body the first way to\ntell is by this blood test and then\nprobably after that blood test has been\nelevated for months and years is you\nfinally start feeling it in your gut so\nif you get this measured and you have\nthis a little bit too high then you\nstarting to looking at your gut as a\nprimary source secondary source would be\nyour oral health believe it or not like\nyeah I talked about that that's that was\nyeah go for it yeah there's a huge\nassociation between poor oral health\ndementia and heart attacks as well and\nthat's because a lot of inflammation\ntakes place in your mouth if you have\ncavities if you have gingivitis Etc so\nyou know if your infl inflammation\nlevels are high you need to go see the\ndentist make sure your your oral health\nis okay but then you need to start\ntreating your gut here's where a\nfunctional medicine doctor can be\nextremely helpful because they can\nreally sort through like what is going\non with your gut do you have leaky gut\nwhy do you have leaky gut you know 10%\nof the population has gluten\nsensitivities 7% is dairy sensitive or\nprobably even more or these are just you\nknow these are just estimates and once\nyou start eliminating those inflammatory\nfoods the toxins in your food from your\ndiet your gut starts to heal and we can\nput you on a gut healing protocol\nreduces inflammation and inflammation is\nthe root cause of all the major diseases\nonce you treat inflammation your chance\nof getting all the other diseases are\nmuch less right so you got to focus on\nyour gut and so this is where you know I\ntell my patients like look it's not just\nabout sleep exercise diet now we need to\nstart talking about gut health like\nthat's another thing we need to talk\nabout and so hscp is the biomarker for\nthat measure that and then of course if\nyou're having symptoms bloating diarrhea\nconstipation definitely need to go get\nthat checked out yeah it could be so\neasy to just kind of feel embarrassed\nabout it or be negligent of it or to\njust kind of brush it off to the side\nbut I can't tell you the number of like\nmen and women that I see that are like\ndon't want to talk about it because\nthey're just like doct you know like\nhave a lot of gas they're so embarrassed\nabout it but it's like let's double\nclick on that we need to figure that out\nright yeah and it's just and it's just\nit's almost like it's it's weird what\nwe've been taught to like be ashamed of\nin society when these are like really\nnormal natural things that we all need\nto be massively aware of it's\ninteresting how the most important\nthings in society become the most taboo\nto talk about you know we're talking\nabout health right now money is another\none in in a different way or like even\nlike relationship challenges things that\nare vulnerable have become this thing of\nlike don't talk about it it's it's weird\nit's strange sad right yeah it's really\nsad yeah it's really sad like so well\nhopefully I mean stuff like this podcast\nyou bring it to light people start\ntalking about it and bringing a more\ninto mainstream conversation is so\nimportant yeah I think that's what's\nneeded I mean I know for a long time\nlike I didn't know who to talk to about\nthings because you just don't hear it\nright and I think when people are\ntalking to their doctors also having\nPhysicians who we feel understand this\nlanguage and that's why I think with you\nsaying that we need to become the CEO of\nour own health I think we've always\nwanted to Outsource it to a doctor or to\na healthc care professional whatever it\nmay be and the truth is no one's going\nto care about it as much as you\nabsolutely and so it has to start there\nso this I want to focus on this one\nbecause it's so interesting so you\nobviously talk about heart health as one\npart of your Wellness wheel and it\nfascinates me because even when I've\nseen it on your Wellness wheel a million\ntimes when I've been in and and when we\nknow how important the heart is we\nrarely talk about heart health and if we\ndo we kind of do it in a soft way we\ndon't really talk about it from a\nscientific point of view and you talk\nabout how important it is to know our\nlevels at 25 years old is it APO AP o\nyep AP right yeah so walk us through\nthat and understanding what that is what\nit means and how do we know right\nexactly so I think everyone's heard\nabout like watching your cholesterol\nlevel right okay so right now what\nhappens is you get your cholesterol\nlevels measured sometimes in your 30s if\nyou're lucky usually doctor will wait to\nyour 40 and unless it's like over a\nreally high number no one's really going\nto do anything about it and then people\nwill start talking to you about your\ndiet and managing your exercise you know\nexercise more eat better eat less fat\neat less cholesterol then you just kind\nof let it go until all of a sudden it's\nan emergency for you to get on a Statin\nyou know and I think it's kind of 10 15\n20 years too late at that point in time\nright the damage has already been done\num if you do cardiac testing you'll see\nthat there's already blockages in blood\nvessels at that point in time and most\nof the time these are not diagnosed\nuntil people have their first heart\nattack no one even looks at the blood\nvessels until you've had a heart attack\nand it's really sad the way this whole\nthing goes and it's especially sad\nbecause heart attacks and strokes can\nbecome like an orphan disease like a\ndisease that never affects us if we just\ndo it right and this is where I think\nmedicine has made like a tremendous\nincredible amount of knowledge has been\ngained and this is where I try to really\nencourage my patients to really partner\nwith their medical doctors and really\nget this treated so when I say know your\napob level I love apob it's a new new\ntype of cholesterol measurement kind of\nlumps together all the bad forms of\ncholesterol which I even hate saying bad\ncholesterol but it lumps that together\nthe dangerous forms and knowing what\nyour apil B level is when you're 2025\nthat's kind of the Baseline where you\nwant it to be right so as this starts\ncreeping up you want to start doing\nthings about it with your exercise diet\nsleep gut health all of that matters but\nthen when it gets to a certain level\nthat's a little bit too high that's when\nyou want to start doing cardiac testing\nand diagnosis so this really great test\nthat can be done now CAT scans of your\nheart that can tell you 20 30 years\nahead of time before you have a heart\nattack if you have a blockage and we\nhave great Therapeutics Now to turn back\nthe time on these blockages to get rid\nof these blockages to prevent you from\nhaving a heart attack I can't tell you\nthe number of patients that we've had in\nour clinics that we've done this scan on\npreventatively and how many of them\nactually had to go straight to the\nemergency room to get a blood vessel\nopened up you know double clicking on\nthis just because I think it's really\nimportant for your audience to know ail\nB and there's another one everyone needs\nto get measured when they're young is LP\nlittle a or even young or old if you've\nnever had it done got to measure LP\nlittle a LP little a is a genetic form\nof cholesterol that can't be treated\nwith diet nutrition and um exercise or\ncholesterol lowering medication\ntraditional ones and if you're one of\nthe you know few percentage of people\nthat have it you'll still get massive\nblockages in your arteries at a very\nyoung age so most people don't check\nthat until it's too late as well and we\ncan treat that now as well so LP littlea\nand a\ntwo tests everyone need to ask their\ndoctor about that's fantastic I'm so\nglad you're like giving us a vocabulary\nof knowing what to check CU I think\notherwise you know I know I just go up\nto my doctor and be like well how how\nhealthy is my heart and they're going to\nbe like you're fine like you know and\nit's and I think that's the challenge we\ndon't really have a vocabulary or we\ndon't know the exact tests and checks\nthat need to happen and again I think\nyou've given us so many across the board\nand I just hope everyone who's listening\nor watching like please please please go\nand check these things out because I\njust want you to live a healthier longer\nhappier life and you know so much of\nthis could either make it easier or\nharder right absolutely and I think you\nknow there's different types of people\nsome people like you like you want to\nknow and you want to know as soon as\npossible because you want to make sure\nyou get it treated or take care of it\nbefore it becomes a big problem and so\nthose are the type of people I think\nwill take this information and really\nrun with it then there's another type of\npeople that will take this information\nbring their notes to their doctor some\nof their doctors will say okay let's\ncheck it some will be like no you don't\nneed to do that and they'll be like okay\nI'll just leave it which you know it's\nfine but I really encourage people to\nbecome the CEO of their own health\nbecome more aggressive and proactive and\nlearning and tracking these things and\npushing your doctor on some of this\nstuff and then you have a group of\npeople that just like they want their\nhead and their sayand like I don't want\nto know until it's a problem tell me\nthen which there's not much you can do\nabout that except you know take care of\nthem yeah absolutely absolutely we've\ntalked about brain health before the\nshow but I wanted to talk about cancer\nyeah and the the reason why I want to\ntouch on that obviously is because I\nthink the rates are just going up and up\nand up I've lost two people in the last\nfour years three people in my entire\nlife people that I'm like very close to\nthis does not include your auntie your\nmom's friend like you know like not even\njust like looking around the whole space\nbut like people that I'm directly close\nto and all from different causes or from\ndifferent reasons it's something that I\nthink you know that we all have a fear\naround because you just hear it so often\nand everyone's going through something\nlike you talk about Cancer's biggest\nenemy is being diagnosed at stage one\nbut that whenever I've had friends or\npeople I love we always find out at\nstage three or four so how do how do we\nget that what do you mean to do so\ncancer Diagnostics literally in the last\nfive years has become incredibly\nrevolutionalized and there's two tests\nthat have done this um one is a test\ncalled the full body MRI like the pros\nscan which is what we did when I think\nyeah right exactly yep you you you did\nthe full body MRI and that happened\nbecause we've always had MRI scanners\nbut now MRIs are becoming more\nubiquitous and cheaper these are no\nradiation scans of your entire body and\nthey're getting quicker too so we can do\nthe whole body in like under an hour I\nalways say if Steve Jobs had one of\nthese he'd still be alive today you know\nso it's a scan that scans your whole\nbody for not just tumors but also other\nanatomical abnormalities that can kill\nyou like aneurysms in your brain or your\naorta so I think that's a very useful\ntest it's controversial because you do\nfind a lot of us called incidentalomas\nThese are incidentals that you end up\nchasing down a rabbit hole as far as\nwhat is that thing over there but if you\ncan tolerate a little bit of you know\nhaving Diagnostics done and a little bit\nof stress while you figure out what\nthose things are you'll know a lot more\nabout your body in enough time to take\ncare of an issue so that's one\ntechnology the second technology which\nis truly Revolution is the liquid biopsy\nthis is the grill the gallery gril test\nand um this is a blood test that you can\ndo and you just send in a vial of blood\nthey check it for little fragments of\nDNA from active tumors in your body okay\nand so it can diagnose 50 of the most\nhard to diagnose tumors at very early\nstages and um right now unfortunately\nthis test is expensive and not covered\nby Insurance my feeling is as a\ntechnology evolves it'll become cheaper\nand cheaper of course and it'll become\nthe new standard in medicine is to check\neveryone for this once a year because\nthe reason cancer is so hard to treat is\nbecause of being diagnosed at pH three\nor four when it's metastatic right and\nthen it's almost it's you have to go\nchemo radiation surgery it's so hard but\nonce you diagnose it to stage one it's\nlike it's not even had a chance to get\nthere right so this blood test if you\ncan afford it right now you know once a\nyear I would start doing it for if you\ncan't it's going to get cheaper keep\nyour eye out on it I think it'll get\ncheaper really quickly as a lot of\ntechnology is becoming right now it's\ngoing to revolutionize the way we\ndiagnose cancer and then everyone in\naddition to those you can't just do\nthose each of those detects its own\nthings right you got to get your\ncolonoscopy do it early especially if\nyou have a family history of colon\ncancer done too yep exactly yeah very\nimportant I was scared for like a week\nit was like yeah it is scary but the n\noscopy is not just diagnosing cancer\nlike if you go in there and you see a\nprecancer you can remove it immediately\nso it's like treatment as well right and\nthen for men get the PSA test which is a\nblood test for your prostate for women\nmake sure you get your mammograms and\nmake sure you get your OBGYN exams\nthat's kind of like the array of\npreventative Diagnostics you want to do\nnow in the 21st century to you know\nbasically diagnose cancer before before\nit kills you you know as soon as\npossible and how how do we cancer proof\nour body cancer proofing is done by\ndoing all of the other things that we\ntalked about today getting seven eight\nhours of sleep making sure that your\nnutrition is comes mostly from Whole\nFoods not processed foods and exercising\nand not being sedentary the other thing\nis eliminating toxins from your\nday-to-day life and so we can talk about\nthat a little bit if you like how to\neliminate toxins so the parto principle\non that is realize where do you spend\nthe most time right you spend the most\ntime probably at work and sleep in your\nbed at night that environment the air in\nthat environment you want that to be as\nclean as possible so you want to\ndetoxify your air your water your food\nand chemicals on your skin so air buy an\nair purifier for each one of those\nenvironments if the air is not perfectly\nclean for your water um I recommend\ngetting UND syn Reverse Osmosis System\nin your kitchen um where you drink get\nmost of your drinking water drink it out\nof glass bottles for the most part and\nfor your food organic or go to that\nwebsite called ewg.org and finally for\nthe Cosmetics that you use and the stuff\nyou put on your body there's a great app\ncalled think dirty and it you can put\nany product in there scan the barcode\nit'll tell you the level of toxin and\nrecommend to you the most non-toxic\nproducts you do that you've covered 80%\nof the landscape like you're you're\nliving in a mostly non-toxic environment\nI'm sure there's people that have other\nthings that they do but that to me are\nthe keys yeah my wife is my Think Dirty\napp like she figure out she's like she's\nchecked every product she got us to\nswitch to Glass bottled water she put\nthe reverse osmosis system in like she's\njust so on top of all this stuff and I'm\nlike if I didn't have her in my life I\ndon't know what I'd be doing right now\nand it's incredible how these and and\nalso you know when someone recommends\nthese things like when my wife first\ncame up with this reverse osmosis water\nthing I was like come on like do we\nreally need it like you know and and\nit's interesting how we have such random\nresistance to a lot of these things we\nkind of overthink it or we we underthink\nit where we just go oh well that can't\nbe that such a big deal like I think the\nwhole bottled water thing is now blown\nup when my wife was talking to me about\nit like four five years ago and at the\ntime it was like I could have been a bit\nlike oh no it doesn't matter it's just a\nplastic water bottle and now you see the\nresearch right and so I think it's so\ninteresting how like if you have someone\nin your life your friends your family\nwho are recommending things to you be\nopen-minded about it because you have no\nidea when it's finally going to be\nproven and I'm hoping that anyone who's\nlistened to this episode please please\nplease share this with episode with\nfriends and family members because I\nthink what Dr sha has done beautifully\ntoday is he's laid out step one step two\nand step three and so whether you're\nsomeone who's just getting started in\nyour journey or whether you're someone\nwho's trying to refine it and improve it\nand enhance it in a deep way you know\nyou've kind of given the pathway for all\nof those well thank you and you know\nyou're right it's so easy to be\nskeptical right it's hard to be not\nskeptical and open-minded do your\nresearch and really dive in but I mean\nyou do such a good job of you know\ntrying to get people to break through\nthat barrier of skepticism and opening\ntheir mind to new possibilities that I\nthink if people were to like just kind\nof even they pick up one thing and\nresearch it on their own you're going to\nmake a positive change right I agree Dr\nsha you've been incredible today I mean\nyou've given us such a wealth of insight\nand like I said at the beginning I want\nthis to be the episode that you come\nback to to go if I'm looking at my gut\nhealth what do I need to focus on if I'm\nlooking at my nutrients what do I need\nto focus on please please please take a\nscreenshot of this episode right now I\nwant you to make sure that you tag Dr\nshy and I on social media so that he can\nsee what resonated with you so that I\ncan see what's that one thing you're\ntrying what's that thing that is now\nyour day one not your one day what is\nthe thing that you're putting into\npractice that is going to shift how you\nfeel that is going to shift uh how you\nlive your life what is the thing that\nyou've been avoiding measuring that\nyou're going to measure from now on to\nmake sure that you can start taking the\nproactive steps in avoiding some of\nthese challenges that you can Dr sha I\nwant to ask you the final five of course\nwhich we do with every guest uh but I\nwant to make sure that I ask where\nshould people find you where should\npeople follow you where can people\nconnect with your work to continue to be\neducated yeah so you know I've been\ndoing this course for my patients now\nfor many years and um a lot of them want\ntheir family and friends to do this but\nthey might be living in different\ncountries so I recently started putting\nthe entire course on my Instagram\npageant so Daran sha MD if you go there\nlike it's all kind of in order we're\ngoing to start with nutrition then move\non to sleep and move on to exercise Etc\nand over the course of the year we'll\nhave all the content on there but in a\nsequential fashion that's fantastic so\nDaran Shaw MD on Instagram right is the\nplace to go and follow we're hoping you\ncan upload it to Tik Tok as well so yes\nyeah we need we need D and Sham D on Tik\nTok too I love it both of them would be\namazing uh Dr shot these are your final\nfive we ask these to every guest\nsometimes a different mocktail of of all\nof them but we need one word to one\nsentence maximum for each question so\nquestion number one what is the best\nhealth advice you've ever received get\nup and start moving nice all right\nquestion number two what is the worst\nHealth advice you've ever received let\nyour doctor watch your blood markers\nright wow all right uh question number\nthree what is something you used to be\nskeptical about in terms of health and\nwellness techniques but now you swear\nyeah this whole um field of eliminating\ntoxins from your day-to-day environment\nI used to think it didn't matter but it\nmatters so much again yeah you think oh\nair purifier like it's just yeah what\nare they trying to sell me but it does\nmake a huge difference right uh question\nnumber four what is something that you\nused to swear by for your health and now\nyou actually think ah no I don't need to\nfocus on that anymore intermittent\nfasting I know a lot of people will get\nupset at that answer but I think there's\na lot of science to the contrary now\nlet's yeah let's dive into that let's\nsegue into that for a second yeah so\nintermittent fasting is great for people\nthat need to start eating less calories\non a day-to-day basis it's a good way to\nmanage your caloric intake but like I\nsaid earlier a lot of people end up\ntaking less protein and so they lose\nskeletal muscle mass and that's what\nhappened to me I was intermittent\nfasting I started my skeletal muscle\nmass on my scale started like plummeting\nand I was like what is happening and\nit's all because it ad been in fasting\nso I stopped it so it's really more\nabout what molecules you're putting into\nyour body I think rather than the timing\nof it and I think um you know you really\nwant to be careful if you are\nintermittent fasting that you're still\ngetting your protein intake and you are\nalso not in the category of people that\nare either pregnant or breastfeeding or\nyou know an athlete I think I seen a lot\nof athletes actually cause a lot of\ndamage to their metabolism by\nintermittent fasting that's I I mean I'm\nnot an athlete but I found that when I\nwas experimenting with it so do I stop\neating dinner by like 6:30 p.m. and I\ndon't eat until the next morning until\n9:00 a.m. so that's the closest I get to\nit but I'm someone who needs to eat\nthree meals a day and I don't snack a\nlot and so for me it's like those three\nmeals are my main meals and I'm very\nhappy with them so breakfast lunch and\ndinner so I eat breakfast at 9:00 lunch\nat 12: to 1 and then dinner at 6:00 and\nit's like for me that keeps my energy\nsteady I'm not overeating or undereating\nat any point like it works for me and so\nI've always I've always been been\ninterested in that as well because I\nI've always found myself feel healthier\nhappier and stronger when I'm doing that\nyep and that's the key you have to go by\nhow you feel and and um I think you said\nanother key where you don't have to\nsnack during the day like you're\nobviously eating Whole Foods and you\neating in adequate quantity where you're\nnot having a snack so that's another key\nas well yeah absolutely all right Fifth\nand final question Dr ST which is if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\nget yourself a group of friends that you\nare so happy and proud to be around that\nyou share common interest in where you\nwant your life to go not just where it's\nat right now it's a great answer\neveryone that's Dr sha on on purpose\nthank you so much for listening and\nwatching again I hope that you take away\nand practices Dr sha kept saying just\none thing from this episode and watch\nhow your life changes again a big thank\nyou follow Dr sha on Instagram at Darian\nsha MD on Instagram and on Tik Tok soon\nto come uh make
