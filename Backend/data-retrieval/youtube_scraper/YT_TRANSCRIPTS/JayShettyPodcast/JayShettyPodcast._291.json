    "transcript": "today most people they buy gy\nmemberships and they don't go there's\n$400 million a year of ghost memberships\nwhere people pay and never show up\nbecause well if I have the membership I\nmight show up but the lazy impulse of\nthe body wins because the gym doesn't\nhave a good return on investment of your\ntime wow and I'm not saying you\nshouldn't work out no I know you and if\nyou go to the gym awesome I enjoy that\nas well but I'd frankly rather go to a\nyoga class in my spare time and then you\ncan get the muscles in about three to\nfive times less time than going to the\ngym you get the cardio in I don't know\n15 minutes versus 5 hours a week I don't\nknow the ratio there but it's crazy and\nit's much better cardio anyway"
