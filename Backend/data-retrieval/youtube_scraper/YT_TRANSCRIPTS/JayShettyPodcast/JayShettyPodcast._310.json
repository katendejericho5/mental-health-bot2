    "transcript": "I think Envy is the thief of Joy where\nwe run into problems is when we stop\nadmiring those people and we start\nwanting what they have or feeling like I\nshould have gotten what they got\norganizational psychologists want to\nbring in best-selling author Wharton's\nnumber one Professor Adam Grant I think\nthat's people saying I'm stuck I feel\nlike my life isn't going anywhere I feel\nlike I'm squandering my potential that's\na travesty growth is is part of how you\nfeel like you're using your time well\nthe person you're competing with is your\npast self and the bar you're raising is\nfor your future self before we jump into\nthis episode I'd like to invite you to\njoin this community to hear more\ninterviews that will help you become\nhappier healthier and more healed all I\nwant you to do is click on the Subscribe\nbutton I love your support it's\nincredible to see all your comments and\nwe're just getting started I can't wait\nto go on this journey with you thank you\nso much for subscribing it means the\nworld to me the bestselling author and\nhost the number one Health and Wellness\npodcast on purpose with J\nshett why is is getting better important\nlike why is growth important and I know\nit sounds it may sound like a stupid\nquestion it may sound like a a silly\nthing to talk about especially on a show\nlike this but I find that people I talk\nto sometimes idolize being average they\nthink it's good enough good enough is\ngood I find that we are wired often to\nwant things to stay exactly the same we\nlike how they are why should we get\nbetter why should anything get better we\nshould be satisfied with what we have\nand often in the guise of contentment\nand peace there's a sense of Lethy and\ncomplacency that well we don't need to\ngrow because you're just being greedy so\nI'm presenting a spectrum of ideas there\nI'm happy for you to dive into any of\nthose but why is getting better and\nimproving matter at all this is\nfascinating nobody's ever asked me that\nbefore and I frankly I think I've taken\nfor granted that growth is just\nintrinsically enjoyable and motivating I\nmean I think you made a case that maybe\nsome people are not motiv by growth I\nthink that where I might push back on\nthat is to say we live in a world that\nglorifies performance so you know people\nfeel like if they want to be respected\nor celebrated they need to win a medal\nthey need to earn a trophy uh they need\nto get an\nA+ and I think what we've lost sight of\nis that what people actually enjoy is a\nsense of progress feeling like they have\nforward momentum when I think about what\ndoes it look like to not grow I I don't\nthink for most people that's good enough\nI think that's stagnation I think that's\npeople saying I'm stuck I feel like my\nlife isn't going anywhere I feel like\nI'm squandering my potential and I just\nI think that's a travesty and so I think\ngrowth is is part of how you feel like\nyou're using your time well absolutely I\nI completely agree with you and I'm glad\nno one's ever asked you that before\nbecause I think I'm like that too I kind\nof take for granted that I love growth\nand I love the idea of being better and\nimproving and I can't remember I mean\nit's been said a million times it's a\nit's like an age-old quote but it goes\nyou know if you're not growing you're\ndying and I think that's the point that\nwe are either moving forward or we're\nmoving backward we're either getting\nfaster and smarter or we're getting\nslower and and not smarter and I think\nwhen you recognize that idea that there\nis no staying the same there is no we're\njust going to stay on this place and\nplatform forever you start recognizing\noh I have to move forward and the pace\nat which I move how how have you guided\npeople with that I find like often We\ncompare our pace of growth and our pace\nof becoming better and that's the\nhardest one because you're like well\nthey got that body in three months or\nyou know you've been the top rated\nProfessor for seven years like I've only\nwon that once or whatever it may be pace\nof growth how how have you thought about\npace of growth in your work for a long\ntime I I believed the the saying the\nMantra that comparison is the thief of\nJoy I don't believe it anymore I think\nEnvy is the thief of Joy I think social\ncomparison is invaluable I think we have\nto look to other people for inspiration\nI think we look to other people for\nlearning you know not just what am I\ncapable of but also how do I get there I\nthink where we run into problems is when\nwe stop admiring those people and we\nstart wanting what they have or feeling\nlike I should have gotten what they got\nand I think there what's probably\nhelpful is to make a different set of\ncomparisons you know part of what you\ncould do is not think so much about Pace\nas start um maybe focus more on starting\npoints M so maybe somebody who's growing\nfaster than you actually just started\nwith more advantages than you did and\nyou've traveled a greater distance um I\ndon't think we pay enough attention to\nthat would be one thought I think\nobviously comparing to ourselves is\nhelpful too and I think that you know so\noften when it comes to benchmarking\nprogress I want to tell people okay the\nperson you're competing with is your\npast self and the bar you're raising is\nfor your future self and if you can\nfocus on that it's a little bit easier\nto to realize all right yeah everybody\nhas a different starting point everybody\nhas a different pace but if I could tell\nactually let me let me say this I think\nso many people let their expectations\nrise with their progress and so you set\na goal today you achieve it in six\nmonths and then by the time it happens\nit's almost a\nrelief yeah I didn't blow it definitely\nuh there's there's no joy there's no\nsense of meaning and purpose um you you\nsort of expected it and you would have\nbeen disappointed if it didn't happen I\nthink the way you avoid that is you get\nin touch with your past self and you say\nif you know if six months ago me or five\nyears ago me knew where I would land now\nhow proud would I have been how excited\nwould I have been and if you keep that\npast self in mind it's much easier to\nappreciate the I guess the strides that\nyou're making I love that distinction\nyou made as well between how comparison\nversus Envy is the thief of Joy I think\nit's so subtle but it's so new nuanced\nand so powerful because you're so right\nthat I always think of it in the same\nway that you either study someone or you\nenvy them and often the deeper you study\nsomeone the less you'll Envy them\nbecause you'll actually realize how far\nthey've come and what they had to get\nthrough and challenges they had and you\nstart getting the energy from that study\nto say oh maybe I have that within me\ntoo and maybe I can find that within me\ntoo because I have challenges I think\nfor me a really concrete example of that\nwas um I was I was terrified of public\nspeak\nwhen I decided to become a professor\nlike maybe it was the wrong profess like\nwhat are you doing here um but I I\nremember even being a student and\nthinking about raising my hand in\ncollege and I would start to physically\nshake and by the time I got called on\nsometimes I would like I would forget\nwhat I was going to say or I'd second\nguess it or I'd stumble and stammer my\nway through it and so the idea that I\nwas now going to stand in front of a\nwhole classroom or on a big stage was\nextremely daunting so what did I do I\nwent to speakers that I really admired\nand started studying them thinking this\nis going to help me and the first one I\nI picked was\nMLK great Pig really yeah I me what a\ngreat way to get demoralized so I\nwatched his dream speech I tried to take\nnotes on you know on things I could\nlearn from him you I wanted to know well\nhow did he get there and so I start\nreading about it he's 34 years old when\nhe gives that speech like I might as\nwell\nquit I I cannot believe it's greatest\nspeech in American history you know done\nby somebody who's you know not even\nclose to his Prime and I think if I had\nstopped there I would have quit and it\nwould have been easy to walk away from\nMLK is just an Impossible role model and\nlet's be clear he is an Impossible role\nmodel I will never I could work on\npublic speaking for an infinite number\nof years every minute of every day and\nnever come close to that what was\nhelpful though was then sort of\nrewinding and\nrealizing we we usually see our role\nmodels at their Peak MH and we don't\nhave this starting point we don't have\nthe distance they've traveled so how did\nMLK get here and turns out he started\nentering public speaking competitions\nwhen he was 15 years old that was two\ndecades of practice the year he did his\ndream speech he gave over 350 talks and\nso you know if you think about the the\ncumulative progress that was made that's\nmultiple lifetimes you know of effort so\nI think that's that's the kind of sort\nof analysis that we need to do and I\ndon't think most of us do that yeah\nabsolutely absolutely I can't believe I\ncan't I can't remember exactly what it\nwas I left to find it but it was I think\nit was Usain Bol who said something like\nI've worked for x amount of hours to run\n10 seconds or something like that right\nlike the idea of he's practiced for all\nthese hours or months or years to run\nsomething in however long he did it in I\nforgot the exact number but it's so\ninteresting what you're saying and that\nthat backstory of that Journey that\ngrowth the skills development the hours\nthe struggle 300 that year alone is\nbrutal you know yeah that's that's\ninsane and and I think it's fascinating\nand you talk about this I mean I want to\nI want to read from the book a bit if\nyou don't mind so there are a couple of\nthings that I picked out so this is page\n26 for anyone who's uh listening or\nwatching right now page 26 of hidden\npotential so character cannot be\ndeveloped in ease and quiet only through\nexperiences of trial and suffering can\nthe Soul be strengthened Vision cleared\nambition inspired and success achieved\nrecording Helen Keller and then you go\non to say that summoning the nerve to\nface discomfort is a character skill the\nway you were writing in this book was so\nempowering because it was almost like\nyou were pulling from you know I know of\ncourse everything's highly researched\neverything's backed with science but you\nwere kind of pulling from a bit of a\nMartin Luther King's face there like the\nlanguage in there of like summoning the\nnerve to face discomfort is a character\nskill and so you're actually saying what\nwe just talked about with M okay that\ndoing hard things doing uncomfortable\nthings doing difficult things is\nactually where so much of this ability\nfor hidden potential comes from but all\nof us shy away from it you know all of\nus don't want to do it we're scared of\nit you becoming a professor that's scary\nif you don't like public speaking we\navoid discomfort we avoid awkwardness we\navoid challenges how do we summon the\nnerve to face discomfort well clearly\nwhat I did was I started by thinking\nokay writing this book is going to be\nuncomfortable there are going to be a\nlot of times when I'm going to get stuck\nwhen I'm going to feel like this chapter\nis not working and then my writing is\nnot working and then I'm not capable of\nbeing a writer why did I ever think I\ncould become a writer and then that just\nspirals out of control and then the\nantidote to that is to think you know\nwhat Jay shett needs to be empowered and\nAl I love it I love this image of you\ngetting empowerment I do get empowered I\nwould never think of you as somebody who\nwho is in need of that like you're out\nempowering lots of other people always\nin need I guess for me one of the things\nI learned from the research that I\ndidn't know before I I think I think I\nalways understood intuitively the idea\nthat discomfort is key to growth what I\ndidn't understand was that actively\nseeking discomfort and even amplifying\nit was one of the ways that you could\nmove toward your idea of progress I kind\nof saw it as a necessary evil something\nthat happens you know when you're\nlearning and you're struggling and\nyou're tinkering with new skills and\nwhat the I think what the evidence shows\nis that people who are actually given\nthe goal to intentionally feel\nuncomfortable um this is done in some\ncases asking people to Go on stage to do\nimprov comedy and literally feel awkward\non purpose they they end up growing more\nfrom that experience because they put\nthemselves in situations that challenge\nthem and so I think that's what I had to\ndo with public speaking when I was\nstarting to teach is therapists talk\nabout exposure therapy and they often\nrecommend systematic desensitization to\nsay all right let's start you know\nlittle seminar and then you know get to\nknow a group of students well and then\nyou can kind of build from there I\ndidn't have time for that so I went to\nthe opposite extreme of flooding and\nsaid all right I'm just going to\nvolunteer to give guest lectures in\nfront of huge classrooms of hundreds of\nstudents um who I've never met before\nfor my friends classes I don't know why\nthey let me in I don't know why they I\njust volunteered yeah they were overly\ngood friends maybe uh they were\nsacrificing the whole class for for my\ngrowth but extremely uncomfortable for\nme and I remember you know just walking\nin and feeling like I do not belong here\nI'm not qualified uh it was a massive\ncase of impostor syndrome but I think\none of the things that happened when I\nput myself in that uncomfortable\nsituation is I realized it's not really\ngoing to go worse than it did today and\nreading through the you know the\ncomments there were lots of suggestions\nfor improvement and lots of criticisms\nbut there were also you know little\ncompliments about things people liked I\nwas like okay I can build on that I can\nwork on this and um I think you know\njust coming in with the goal yeah I\nshould put myself in a deliberately\nuncomfortable situation um it opened me\nto a much steeper learning curve then if\ni' done the kind of let me dip my toe in\nthe shallow end and then sort of take\noff the the floaties and learn to swim\none step at a time yeah and I feel it's\nreally interesting right do you think\nthere are those two approaches like do\nyou think from the research you've done\nand even your own personal experience do\nyou feel like it is either or like\nsometimes you just jump in the deep end\nand sometimes you should kind of dip\nyour toe in and then walk in or do you\nthink it's it's either raw like or or is\nwisdom knowing which one to try when I\nthat that's where I was I was going to\nland I haven't seen a good comparison of\nthe two and when you should do each but\nthat's that's my intuition as well is I\nthink there's there's a time and a place\nfor both approaches and probably most of\nthe time we want to be somewhere in the\nmiddle but to the point that you made\nearlier I think most of us air too far\non the side of avoiding discomfort and\nso we make these very small incremental\nsteps and one it feels like we're not\nmaking progress which is frustrating and\nthen two we often then don't take enough\nrisks or try enough experiments to\nreally stretch ourselves and move up to\nthe next level yeah definitely one of\nthe things I find that I always do if I\nget curious about something it could be\na sport it could be a subject it could\nbe a topic whatever may be I'll kind of\ncancel everything on the weekend and\njust obsess about it for a weekend\nbecause it gives me a sense of momentum\nor growth or a sense of yeah that's not\nmy thing and I can very quickly decide\nwhether to invest more time in it\nwhereas if I was to have booked a six-\nweek course or a program on something I\nmay find by week three that this isn't\nsomething I want to study for 6 weeks as\nopposed to I could have figured that out\nin 24 hours if I just really obsessed\nabout it or if I'll play a sport and I'm\nthinking oh I like this sport should I\nplay it more let me play it for a whole\nweekend every hour of that I'm awake and\nsee whether it fulfills me or whether\nit's draining and tiring and I feel like\nthat's kind of what you're saying works\nas a better experiment yeah I think that\nkind of immersion is a really efficient\nway to figure out is is this an area\nthat I want to try to keep growing in I\nthink the one thing I'd want to be\ncareful about there is there's there's\nsome evidence to suggest that oftentimes\nwe only like things when we become good\nat\nthem if that's true if you spend a\nweekend on a skill that you're terrible\nat you might quit it prematurely because\nyou just haven't built up enough\nconfidence to start to I was just going\nto say the like the the day I spent I\nspent swinging a golf club I've never\nfelt so incapable in my life same um\nalso golf is not a real sport so I had\nno problems walking away from that\nexplain that explain that I think I'll\noffend too many people I think so true\nthat's hilarious no but I think\nsometimes you you do have to say all\nright this this could take me a couple\nweeks or a couple months where you know\nI build enough competence to really\nexperience the joy of it like I I've\nseen this with um I actually went\nthrough this with tennis um I think I\ntook tennis lessons when you know when I\nwas four or five and I really disliked\nit and you know ended up convincing my\nmom that I should quit and then when I\npicked it up again around 11 or 12 I had\nbetter hand eye coordination i' played a\nbunch of ping pong and like now I was\ndecent enough at a sport the tennis was\nactually fun and I think that's probably\nrelevant to many skills absolutely\nabsolutely so people always ask me and\nI'm sure you get asked this question a\nmillion times of course you do you have\nyour own book club too like which you've\nbeen kindly featured me in the past and\npeople always ask me what should I read\nand my number one response to that is\nwell what are you struggling with\nbecause I read for what I'm struggling\nwith that's how I choose I always say to\npeople you don't go to the grocery store\nbecause your refrigerator is full of\nmilk you go when you're out of milk or\nyou're out of cheese or you're out of\nbread and you go and stock up and so\nI'll often do an audit of my internal\nunit and go well what am I feeling like\nI don't have and I've talked about how a\ncouple of years ago I was building my\nteam and I realized that being a leader\nand a recruiter were very different\nskills and recruitment wasn't a strength\nthat I possessed and I almost assumed\nthat because I was good at certain\nthings that I should be good at\nrecruiting and I and I wasn't and I\nstudied Daniel coil's book the culture\ncode which I love great book yeah it's\nFant fantastic and I interviewed him on\nthe show too and looked at his Playbook\nand everything else and that one book in\nand of itself made me better at\nRecruitment and so I always look at it\nthat way but how do people figure out\nwhat they're struggling with or what\nthey're not good at or what they need to\nget better at is probably the right way\nto put it because we have so many things\nwe're not good at yeah what do we know\nwhat we need to get better at this\nshould have been a chapter in Hidden\npotential where where were you J shete\nwhile I was writing this book that would\nhave been really helpful I um maybe\nmaybe it'll go in the paperback I think\nI my first thought is I always want to\nlook to killes heel what's the one thing\nthat's holding me back from a goal that\nI care about or a value that I'm trying\nto pursue and then the other is um\nwhat's an area of passion or curiosity\nthat you know I'm excited to spend more\ntime investing in and sometimes that's\nfor me because I'm excited about it\nother times it's cuz I want to help\nsomebody else and I think those are\nreasonable questions to ask I think\nwhere a lot of people struggle is they\nthey know the domain already right so\nthey've decided like I want to be a\nbetter entrepreneur or I want to be um a\nbetter artist or I'm interested in\nimproving my coding skills right and\nthey they've kind of already figured out\nwhat part of life they're trying to\nimprove at but then they don't know what\nto focus on from there I think the\nmistake that a lot of us make is we end\nup asking the people around us that we\ntrust for feedback which is a a\nperfectly reasonable thing to do except\nwhen you ask for feedback you get a lot\nof cheerleaders and critics the\ncheerleaders are basically applauding\nyour best self and the critics are\nattacking your worst self and the\ncritics leave you often moralized and\nthe cheerleaders can make you complacent\nwhat you want is a coach a good coach is\nsomebody who sees your potential and\nthen helps you become a better version\nof yourself and so one of the things I\nlearned through uh doing research for\nthe book is that instead of asking for\nfeedback it's often better to seek\nadvice so feedback leads people to think\nabout what you did right or wrong\nyesterday advice helps people focus on\nwhat you can do better tomorrow so the\nway I would like to I guess that I apply\nthis personally is when I'm trying to\nfigure out where I need to grow every\ntime I get off off stage for example or\nevery time I finish a podcast interview\nI will ask the audience or the host\nwhat's the one thing I can do better wow\nwhich is enormously helpful because they\nstart to give concrete suggestions but\nI'm not immediately going to going to\nfocus on the the first thing that I hear\nwhat I do is I ask a bunch of different\npeople and then I look for the patterns\nand I think that what what too many\npeople do is even if they get to the\npoint of asking for advice rather than\nfeedback they start to hear all these\nthings they need to work on they're like\nwhoa this is this is overload it's too\nmuch I I can't handle anymore um I can\nprobably only improve one or two things\nat a time what I would say to those\npeople is when you feel a little bit\noverwhelmed by the number of suggestions\nyou're getting you should actually seek\nmore of them because that will help you\nfind the signal in the noise that will\nhelp you sort of figure out what's one\nperson's idiosyncratic taste and what is\na bunch of people's you know quality um\ninput so I guess that's my favorite way\nto figure out where you need to grow ask\na bunch of people for advice and then\nfocus on the common themes yeah the\npatterns yeah that makes a lot of sense\nI'm going to start doing that I'm going\nto try that out actually try it at your\nown risk\nyeah I've not practiced it in that way\nand and I like that again distinction\nbetween advice and feedback and you're\nso right if someone ask me for feedback\nyour spot on my mind goes into right and\nwrong and you know weaknesses and\nstrengths as opposed to reflecting on\nhey this could work really well or I\nlove this style you have and it could\nwork you know I think that's such a a\ngreat way to about it and it's hard too\nbecause we do base so much of where we\nwant to grow on what other people think\nwe need to grow too and I wonder how we\ncan get better at sitting with our with\nourselves and reflecting on our days I\nalways loved that statement from Steve\nJobs where he said that every couple of\ndays I would look in the mirror and ask\nmyself or reflect on if this was the\nlife I wanted to live am I doing with my\nday what I'd want to do and if it wasn't\nthen I knew I needed to make a change\nand that self-evaluation I think is such\nan important need BEC at the same time\nas listening to others you need both\nit's not an either orw how have how have\nyou done the self- evaluation part as\nwell from from going to someone who was\nscared of giving talks to being you know\none of Ted's most prolific popular\nspeakers of all time to obviously now\nyou know traveling book tours events\neverything else how do you self-\nevaluate now as you were then that's\ndefinitely been a an evolution over the\nyears I think probably the most helpful\nthing that I learned came from another\narea where I struggled a lot earlier and\nprobably based on my initial lack of\ntalent should have quit which was uh\nwhich was springboard diving so\nspringboard diving right yeah I I\nbasically ended up diving because I\ndidn't make the middle school basketball\nteam or the high school soccer team and\nI saw a lifeguard diving at a pool one\nday and was just mesmerized like I want\nto learn how to do that unfortunately I\nwalked like Frankenstein I couldn't\ntouch my toes without bending my knees I\ncould hardly jump uh very little\nexplosive power or Grace not not cut out\nto be a diver I was really fortunate to\nhave a coach who who saw more potential\nin me than I saw in myself and and said\nto me on day one I will never cut a\ndiver who wants to be here and you know\nI'll put in as much as as you want and\nas much as you put in and one of the\nthings I really struggled with was\nknowing when a dive was good and when it\nwas improving I felt like I needed to\nalways aim for perfect tense and Eric\nbest my coach one day sat me down and he\nsaid you know there's no such thing is a\nperfect 10 wait have the have the\nOlympic announcers been lying to me what\nwhat do you mean the whole point is a of\na 10 is perfection that's the peel of\nthis Sport and he's like nope if you\nlook at the RO book um a ten is for\nexcellence so even a dive that gets\nquote unquote perfect score is flaw wow\nso then what we started doing was we set\ntargets for each dive and he said okay\nyou know basic dive like a a back dive\num we're going to aim for sixes and I\nthink that's within your range right now\nand then we would level that up over\ntime as I started to learn harder Dives\nI remember when I was doing a two and a\nhalf somersaults with a full twist um\nlike let's just make the dive if you\ndon't fail it if you don't do it for\nzeros that'll count and then you know\nwe're aiming for fours and so we have\ndive specific goals what I've done with\nthat sort of post- diving career is\nrealized I never had somebody like this\nin my life I need a judge not just a\ncoach so what I will do is I'll ask\npeople give me a zero to 10 how did that\ngo and it's very rare for people to say\n10 yeah of course yeah so then you know\nwhatever they say whether they give me a\nthree and a half or a six I just want to\nknow how can I get closer to 10 that's\nwhere I'm I'm really trying to use other\npeople's reactions as a mirror from\nthere I'll ask for suggestions but to\nyour point I need to make sure I'm also\nproud of my own progress and I'm\nfocusing on my own principles and so the\nthe last analysis I do after I get the\njudges ratings and the advice from\nanybody who's willing to coach me is to\nsay okay let me go back to the version\nof me that set this goal in the first\nplace would that version of me be proud\nand if the answer is no I don't care\nwhat score I got yeah how do you\nnavigate this I'd say that I've\ndefinitely got it wrong before as well\nlike I've definitely made mistakes in\nthat where I think when I first started\nout I kind of kept things very secret\nand I kept things very quiet so I had\nstarted working on creating some content\ncontent online and for everyone who\ndoesn't know I had been making content\noffline for 10 years before that\nspeaking of small groups of 5 to 10\npeople colleges uh after school clubs\nuniversities things like that and my\nparents forced me to go to public\nspeaking in drama school when I was 11\nyears old so I started learning public\nspeaking because I was a shy kid I have\na very similar public speaking story to\nyou when I was 11 years old so I wasn't\nborn with a skill it was something that\nwas harnessed and developed except for\nthe accent except for the accent which I\nwas born with yes I can't do anything\nabout that and funnily enough and I\nalways like to clarify this when I see\nTed speakers with American accents I\nprefer it I yes because to me hearing\nfrom an authority in America from like\nyou know Warton or Harvard or you know\nit has magic it's no this is this is\nthis is like wanting the Beatles to sing\nwith American accents no that's\ndifferent that's terrible no no you\nBritish people always sound smarter we\nknow this go on I I feel the opposite\nway honestly true true uh that's a shame\nso i' I'd spent I'd spent all these\nyears so I developed a skill that I\ndidn't know what I had use for when I\nmet the monks and studied the G and\nEastern wisdom I was like oh wow I have\na skill set that was ready to be used\nfor this when I'd never used it I never\nused public speaking of drama before\nthat for anything meaningful for me at\nleast and then I'd done that for 10\nyears and then I made my first piece of\ncontent online so I but I made it in\nquiet because it's some of these things\nthat you talk about here and I'm\npointing this out because we can go back\nto it after I answer your question I was\nscared of looking stupid I was you talk\nabout making more mistakes Theory versus\nreality in the book this is page 40 and\nyou talk about looking stupid feeling\nshame being laughed at and experiencing\ndiscomfort I was scared of all of those\nthings because now it was going beyond\nmy community of people like five to 10\npeople who used to come and hear me\nspeak I had no idea what the online\nworld would bring I had never done that\nbefore I didn't have any friends who'\never created any online content so I\ncouldn't check in with someone I didn't\nhave a coach and so I was kind of doing\nit in quiet and I think what was\nbeautiful about that is I got to really\nconstruct my own voice that was\nauthentic to who I was and was just\ngenuine to who I was so my earliest\nvideos are half spoken half spoken word\nbecause I loved rap music growing up so\nthere's you'll hear lazy Rhymes you'll\nhear words that Cascade together and\nit's inspired by what I loved as a\nteenager the visual visuals were I've\nalways been into Art and Design and so\nthat was very easy for me I love\nAesthetics I love visuals I love\nfeelings and experiences so I edited all\nmy own videos granted the editing was\nsloppy because of cuts and sound which I\ndidn't know well but it was still what\nwas natural to me and then when I put\nout my first piece of video the first\npeople to react were the people I knew\nand they were all like Jay you talk too\nfast the music's too loud well we don't\nthink this point is that great and it\nwas all negative feedback and I kept\ngoing because I was getting some Joy\nfrom it so in the beginning it was that\nway I and I think I've tried to hold on\nto that as much as possible because as\nthe scale grew the plethora of\nnegativity or criticism or judgment got\nlouder as well and I started to look at\nit more seriously because now you're\nworried about perception and image and\nhow you think people view you and\nwhether people see your truth or they\ndon't and you can feel defensive and I\nthink where I've got to now is I still\nget affected by it I'm I'm so not Beyond\ngetting affected by negative comments or\nchallenging comments or criticisms\nbecause my monk training has left me\nvulnerable at some points because I have\ncreated a space in which to always allow\nadvice to come in because that's seen as\nthat's seen as a mark of wanting to\nimprove and wanting to be better and\nI've had to learn to balance that with\nalso knowing my intention so what I've\naccepted is that the only thing I can\ncontrol is my int ention being\naligned and pure to what I believe not\npure like in a Godly way I mean pure in\nwhat I believe but the way my action is\nreceived will come with advice feedback\nand criticism and all I can keep doing\nis keep refining my\nintention and hope that that will\nchannel the effective communication\nexternally and no matter how perfect 10\nit is it will never be perfect and\ntherefore there will always be criticism\nno matter how phenomenal an idea it is\nor whatever it may be so that's me\nMeandering around your question to\nthat's how I'm dealing with it I don't\nthink that's a solution or a or a solve\nit's how I'm mentally kind of\nconstructing Bridges and walk ways to\nnavigate how stressful it is I think it\nmakes a lot of sense it it also leaves\nme wondering like is there a j shett rap\ntour\ncoming but but all kidding aside\nalthough I I think there would be an\naudience for that\nuh I think one of one of the things that\nthat you're making me think about is\nthere's a spectrum of you know on one\nhand we have the monk ideal of either\nI'm open to everything or I'm not going\nto live in fear of social disapproval\ncorrect on the other and I guess we have\nthe monkey reaction like we are we are\nsocial primates and uh anything that\ncould lose status could get us excluded\nand this is really problematic I don't\nthink either NE is really realistic for\nfor us as humans I think we're always\ngoing to care about what other people\nthink and I think my goal is to say I\nwant to care enough about other people's\nreactions to learn from them but not so\nmuch that I feel pressured to conform to\nthem it's powerful wow the way that I've\ntried to get to that is to say well I'm\nalways going to be disappointing\nsomebody so let me decide whose opinions\nactually matter to me and then include\nmyself in that group and say it's better\nto let down a bunch of ERS or a bunch of\npeople whose standards are not the same\nas mine or whose taste doesn't match\nmine than it is to let down the people I\ncare about and myself too mhm what you\ninspired for me also with that\nConformity idea is how I'm willing to be\nopen enough to improve but not see\nsomething as a reflection of my identity\nand I think that's where it's we all\nstruggle where it's like when someone\nsays when someone laughs at you you feel\nlike they're laughing at you not at that\nparticular event and moment and day or\nevening or improv or whatever it was you\nfeel you are someone who should feel\nshameful as opposed to that was a moment\nwhere I made a mistake and I think\nthat's where I think you struggle when\nyou hear feedback or advice that you\nstart attaching to your identity I think\nthat's it's a huge problem and I think\none of the most reassuring bodies of\nresearch that I guess speaks to this\nfrom the book is um is the overblown\nimplications effect the idea that when\npeople see you make a mistake they don't\nactually attribute that to your\nincompetence or your lack of character\nlike you think they do so you know you\nyou watch somebody um you know take a\nreally crappy photo and their thumb is\nin the frame and you don't immediately\nthink that person is incapable of being\na decent photographer like that was a\nbad photo right it was literally a bad\nsnapshot um and it's a snapshot of a bad\nsnapshot so it's a meta bad snapshot you\nknow I think somebody you know is is\ntrying to cook and they they burn\nwhatever is in the oven you don't\nimmediately think they're a bad cook you\nthink oh they they got distracted or\nthey you know didn't have the right\nrecipe or they this is the first time\nthey're trying that and I think we're\nreally good at recognizing that in\nothers we we we don't sort of leap to\nconclusions that they're inescapably\nhopelessly flawed and that their failing\nmakes them a failure but I think in our\nselft talk and our self assessment um we\ndo so much of that like I screwed this\nup I am a screw up and everyone else is\ngoing to know it that yeah so true and\nit's and it gets it gets really dark it\ngets really really dark I'm so glad we\nwent there and thank you for asking me\nto reflect on that too because it's I'm\nalways trying to find better Pathways\nmentally to to deal with these things\nthat you have to navigate on a daily\nbasis I think we all are and I don't\nthink you need to thank me for wanting\nto learn well let's talk about that I\nlove this diagram that you put in the\nbook about how we think Learning Happens\nversus how it actually happens and I\nthink that idea of so how we think\nlearning happens I'll explain that and\nthen you can explain that how learning\nhappens from your words uh Adam shows in\nthe book this diagram that says\nknowledge leads to comfort leads to\npractice leads to progress which is how\nwe think learning happens and I think so\nmany of our beliefs around learning do\ncome from school and do come from even\nfor me learning happens in that I\nlearned something now I know it fully\nand now that rule stands forever and I\nthink modern day learning isn't that at\nall like I don't know any rules that\nhave completely stood forever and apart\nfrom obviously certain mathematical or\nscientific rules of course but most\nrules in business most rules in\nmarketing most rules in sales most rules\nin even a relationship they they change\nthey they mold they they grow and so I\nthink that fixed approach is hard to\nshake because you were always told at\nthe end of it well you got the wrong\nanswer so it was always about the answer\nand it was always about well if you knew\nthe rule you would have got the right\nanswer and today we feel I'm not getting\nthe right answer so I must not know the\nright rule but that we're not finding\nthat so how reflect on that and then\nguide us through the the principle\nyou're right that we have a kind of have\nthis ideal in our heads that I'm going\nto reach Mastery and then I'm done yes\nit's a version of what tal Ben Shahar is\ncalled the arrival\nfallacy that you know I'll hit my Des\nand then everything will have changed\nand the reality is when you reach\nMastery you don't freeze at that moment\nyou have to keep evolving your Knowledge\nand Skills as the world around you\nevolves and I think what that leads a\nlot of people to do is to spend far too\nmuch time trying to get to the point of\nMastery before they ever really try\nsomething you know from the book I saw\nthis really clearly in examples of\nlanguage Learners I mean how many people\ndo you know that just concluded in high\nschool that they're incapable of\nmastering a foreign\nlanguage you yeah what what languages\ndid you take so we did uh French and\nGerman from year seven so 11 years old\ntill like 14 and if we did well at those\nI got to do Russian so I actually\nstudied Russian for a year and I could\nread write and speak for a whole year it\nwas really great learning and then I\nnever got to practice any of those\nlanguages and so they all fell away and\nthen when I went by the time I went to\ncollege I had already lost touch with\nall of them so French German and Russian\nwere the ones I studied the most yeah\nand so it sounds like you actually did\nexperience some progress but then it\ndidn't stick and you weren't able to\nkeep it up yes exactly yeah so I I think\nthat's pretty common I think maybe even\nmore common is the like I don't have the\ngenes for this I'm missing the langu the\nforeign language gene or I like I miss\nmy critical window if only I had you\nknow if my parents had raised me\nbilingual or if I had started an\nimmersion when I was four everything\nwould be different I met two amazing\nlanguage Learners when I was uh when I\nwas doing research for the book Sarah\nMaria hasbun and Benny\nLewis and they both concluded After High\nSchool that they were incapable of\nlearning a foreign language um Sarah\nMaria could not make it through Spanish\num and her father speaks fluent Spanish\nBenny I think uh just had a disastrous\nexperience with German also with\nIrish and what's amazing about the two\nof them is that combined they can speak\na dozen languages fluently today wow a\ndozen languages fluently\nconversationally even more um so they're\npoly thoughts there are people who not\nonly talk but think in multiple\nlanguages they're effectively\nself-taught and they've picked it all up\nin their 20s 30s Beyond so what I wanted\nto know is what can we learn from them\nnot just about language learning because\nbut about any kind of learning because\nthey are professional Learners and my\nbiggest takeaway from you know talking\nto them and also ju supposing what they\ndo with the evidence is that language\nclasses are broken in a lot of schools\nbecause basically what happens is um you\nyou learn learn a vocabulary um and a\nbunch of you know rules of grammar and\nthen you're taught to more or less just\nwrite it down and very few schools do\nextensive practice in speaking which\nmeans that you never learn to actually\ntalk in the language which means you're\nnot using the language and you don't\npractice enough to really Master it what\nSarah Maria and Benny recommend is start\nspeaking from day one literally the\nfirst day you're picking up a language\nyou start talking in it and what will\nhappen as you do that is you're going to\nmake lots of mistakes but through using\nit you're going to start to internalize\nit and in fact one of the things we know\nfrom the research is when you make a\nmistake you're more likely to remember\nthe correct answer because it really\nsticks you're like oh wait I screwed\nthat up last time let me now change it\nso I think the the broader lesson here\nis that to go all the way back to the\ndiagram I think a lot of people want to\nwait to use their knowledge until\nthey've acquired it oh wow it's not how\nLearning Happens the way Learning\nHappens is you got to use your knowledge\nas you're acquiring it and that's how\nyou build it and that's a that's a\nvirtuous SE\noh my God that you know it's so\ninteresting I don't think I've ever\nheard that put that way I I feel like\nI've just and it's resonated so strongly\nwith me because as soon as I met gangas\nwho's the monk that I spent time with as\nsoon as I met him I had no qualification\nbut I went back to college and started\ntelling everyone about what I'd learned\nand then I'd go back and spend time with\nhim and go learn more and then come back\nand just teach whatever I'd learned and\nthere was no I didn't have any\nqualification to teach I didn't I didn't\nunderstand it fully but it was like it\nwas so much more fun that way and I\nallowed myself I gave myself the\npermission to say I'm just going to\nteach what I learn I'm going to teach\nwhat I learn up until now I don't have\nto speak beyond my level of realization\nor reflection but but I'm learning this\nI'm fascinated by it let me share it\nyeah I mean that's that's a higher level\nversion of you know of learning by doing\nit's learning by teaching yeah and so\noften people like to say well those who\ncan't do teach and I would I would edit\nthat and say no those who can't do can\nlearn by by teaching because exactly as\nyou found uh when you explain something\nto someone else you remember it better\nand you also understand it better and I\nI actually think anything you want to\nlearn um a lot of people are trying to\nfigure out what is generative\nAI you you could go and take a class in\nit you could go Tinker with it I would\nsay go teach a class in it or get a\ngroup of people together who are also\ninterested in learning it and each of\nyou take a module to teach to the rest\nof the group and that's when you're\nreally going to internalize it and start\nto master it yeah you I love that I I\nI'll butcher it now trying to say as\nwell as you did but yeah cuz you always\nhurt for\neloquence no no but that idea you put so\nwonderful J shett bad talker is a is a\ncommon I that's actually a meme I don't\nknow if if it's if it's made it on your\nradar but like this guy's incoherent we\nnever understand a word he says he's\njust babbling constantly no but that\nparticular statement I I I honest I love\nthat idea of how we always waiting till\nwe've mastered something till the end of\nsomething to feel like we can play share\ndo and and there's a so there's a few\nthat is well put yeah that's exactly\nright I'm like I'm trying to get to the\nend of the line and then I'm like I will\nhave made it and now I can demo it and\nnow I can teach it yeah and and I think\nthat making something\npublic is so\nhorrifying because the reason why we\nstruggle to go teach a class on AI is\nbecause we're scared we're going to be\nasked questions that we don't know the\nanswer to and actually your spot on that\nis exactly the best way to learn because\nyou'll be able to say to all those\npeople hey I don't know but I'll find\nout for next time or I'll email you the\nanswer whatever it may be and I find\nthat but we haven't created space for it\nto be okay to not know no I think that's\nright and there's actually some work on\nthis in Psychology which shows that when\nan expert expresses uncertainty they\nactually end up becoming more believable\num in part because people are surprised\nand then they listen more carefully uh\nand realize wow this person does know\nwhat they're talking about I don't think\nthat permission should only be granted\nto experts I think in fact the less you\nknow the quicker you should be to say I\nhave no idea and it's really ironic that\nonly the people who know the most often\nget to the point of feeling secure in\nthat knowledge to be able to say yeah I\nhave no clue but let me let me do some\nresearch on that and come back to you\nyeah yeah and I I mean I felt this as a\nteacher I felt like especially in the\nyou know the major public speaking\nanxiety days early career I I felt like\nI had to be able to regurgitate a study\nfor every single question that came up I\ncan imagine yeah I like I thought that\nwas my job and I I was really missing\nout on the joy that that students get\nand also that I get of saying I've never\nseen anyone explore that before I think\nthat would make a great dissertation\nhave you ever thought about coming to a\nPhD program totally um and I don't know\nI think part of the joy of learning is\nthat every answer raises at least nine\nnew questions yeah um and I think that\nwe close that off when when we expect\npeople to always have an answer\nyeah you've mentioned a few times that\nand even in your diving example the need\nfor a coach you know I feel like therapy\nculture has and is still slowly\npenetrating like we I think if you're in\nthe circle you think of it as like\nreally accessible and easy and it's a\nbig deal and and not stigmatized correct\nand the truth is it isn't across the\nboard it's getting there it's slowly\nbecoming destigmatized I think the idea\nof finding a coach is is so unless\nyou're an athlete it seems so far as an\nidea or as a thought process how you\napproach things I know exe there are\nexecutive coaches that have definitely\nkind of got into the Zeitgeist but still\nfinding a coach is quite an alien\napproach I find that people have there's\nstigma there there's confusion there\nthere's a a lack of understanding of\nwhat is a coach how do how have you\nthought about it seeing as you've\nmentioned it a bunch of times in yeah in\nthe book and today well I think I think\nwe're actually comfortable with it in\ncertain domains right so no one would\never hesitate to say all right I want my\nkid to learn the piano they need a piano\nteam teacher M so I think when it comes\nto you know to hobbies and you know kind\nof skills early in life um everybody\nknows they need a coach to learn the\nbasics and then move toward intermediate\nand then hopefully you know figure out\nif if this is something they want to\npursue further I think where it starts\nto become a little uncomfortable is when\nyou're an adult and you think that you\nshould be able to teach yourself\neverything or you want to be\nself-reliant not dependent on someone\nelse and I think that's that's a broken\nmental model of a coach a coach is\nactually I think a good coach is trying\nto work him or herself out of a job and\nsay obviously I'm going to give you lots\nof advice and I'm going to try to help\nyou improve but at some point you should\ninternalize the way that I look at your\nperformance the way that I think about\nhelping you make progress to the degree\nthat you can you could figure out what\nwould I say like after this and then\napply that advice and at that point\nyou're probably ready for a new coach\nwho has different Knowledge and Skills\nto share with you and I think that's\nwhere I would start is I would say\ncoaches are all around us you know going\nback to the the asking for advice idea\nright you ask people for advice you\nstart to turn them into your coaches and\nthere's no reason why you can't\nformalize this um a lot of and you're\nfamiliar with this a lot of writers have\nwriting groups where somebody's working\non a manuscript and then you know four\nor five other writers are basically\ncoaching them and trying to help them\nimprove it um I don't think that should\nbe limited to you know it has to be my\njob or it has to be the hobby I'm trying\nto improve at I think anything you want\nto you want to get better at you could\njust ask for somebody to give you\ninformal coaching and then you learn\nreally quickly is this person's\nperspective helpful to me in this domain\nabsolutely absolutely yeah I you have a\ncoach I I'm looking for one right now\nfunnily enough that's why I asked you uh\nand I think for me at the moment now we\nknow why you were asking how do I figure\nout what to grow on yeah exactly and uh\nI think there's that feeling for me\nabout I'd say if I really worded it\naccurately and clearly it would be I'm\nreintegrating and re renewing and\nrefining my values because my life has\nchanged so drastically and so there were\ntimes when I felt\nlike I had kept up with the pace of my\nexternal growth and then all of a sudden\nI was like oh no this is way bigger than\nI thought it was and this is so\ndifferent from how I lived just 10 to 15\nyears ago and I want to realign and\nreconnect with that if that makes sense\nit does and so I think that is something\nwhich I've given myself personal time to\ndo regularly to refine to realign to\nreconnect but to do it with someone else\nwho can see beyond and and and maybe has\nhad experience of two very Opposite\nWorlds and has has traversed those paths\nmay be really helpful and so I think\nthat's that's what I would be looking\nfor and so coaching would be the right\nmodality for that I I think it could be\nI think it's interesting there are two\nlevels of that that I I think could be\nfruitful the first first one is exactly\nthe way you framed it which is uh let me\ntake a step back and figure out what my\nvalues are and how my core principles in\nlife have changed should change moving\nforward that's what it is yeah but I\nthink the other layer of it is saying\nmaybe the values are the same but your\nopportunity set has evolved so what does\nit mean to live your values now given\nthose opportunities correct absolutely\nabsolutely there we go get I've got a\nfew candidates for you I'll uh I'll\nsuggest them offl please I'd love I\ngenuinely love that yeah no and that's\nthat's definitely been where my head's\nbeen at probably the most most recently\nand it's and and again I usually sit\nwith something like this and let it\nsimmer and let it clarify and it's nice\nin a forum like this to be able to\nvocalize it in an articulate way and\nthat's another beautiful thing about\ntalking to someone else about it if you\nkeep going around it in your own head\nchances are you won't say it as\narticulately as you would say to someone\nelse because you want it to make sense\nto them that's one of my favorite things\nabout conversation uh there was a a\nbiographer once um it was em Forster\nbiographer she used this beautiful\nphrase called inverse Charisma which was\nthe idea she said Forster had had this\nability to ask you such insightful\nquestions with such sincere interest\nthat he brought out a more insightful\nmore Charming version of yourself than\nexisted I'm like that's part of what a\ngood coach is I actually think great\ncoaches are filled with inverse Charisma\nthey're not giving the rousing halftime\nspeech all the time or the pep talk um\nthey're not always necessarily kicking\nyou in the butt to try you know to get\nyou to to work harder or persist longer\nI think what they're doing is um is\nposing challenges and ideas for you that\nbring out a better version of you yes\nyes I couldn't agree more and I think\nthat is what hidden potential is I mean\nit's someone is not planting potential\nit's not uh manufactured potential it's\nnot Inception potential it's hidden\npotential it's it's there and someone's\nhelping ask the question so you can keep\nrevealing it and peeling away the layers\nand I think that is exactly what a good\ncoach does good coach is not telling you\nwho you are or telling you the answer or\ntelling you who you could be it's\nallowing you to discover that for\nyourself which is needed for someone\nelse to do that because otherwise you're\njust stuck in your head saying I'm not\nthat I remember Ida coach years ago when\nI'd left the monastery I was working at\nAccenture in London and he'd always say\nto me you're an entrepreneur just from\nwatching you I can observe that you're\nan entrepreneur and I'd be like no I'm\nnot an entrepreneur I don't to be an\nentrepreneur and I said I would fight\nand debate that with him I would give\nhim all the reasons and he said Jay one\nday you'll see and now I look back and I\nthink wow I was that is exactly who I\nwas not in the in the way that it may be\nseen in the world but the autonomy the\nthe wanting of being artistic being a\nleader wanting to create wanting to\nproduce without uh with freedom and\nwithout restraint like all of that\nquality of an entrepreneur I think\nlanguage is so limiting too it is yeah\nright yeah you're right if you would if\nyou had defined entrepreneurship back\nthen as as being someone who sees\nopportunities and then creates a vision\nand then builds around that without\ngiving up a ton of Freedom like yeah of\ncourse that's who I am and instead\nyou're like I gotta be I don't run a\nstop like that's that's what in my head\nI was like I don't want to manage people\nlike I don't you know yeah I got to be\npitching a Scrub Daddy on Shark Tank\nyeah yeah yeah that's what you yeah I\ndon't want to start business like that's\nnot you know that's not what I want to\ndo with my life and so yeah it's\nfascinating how language limits us I was\nI was going to ask you that about that\nlike how do you feel comfortable and\nthis is Chapter 3 of your book the Imp\nimperfectionists finding The Sweet Spot\nbetween flawed and Flawless how do you\nallow yourself to release\nanything when you know it's going to be\nflawed and imperfect because I think\nthat that's the challenge right with the\nbook especially with social media less\nso it's it's short form and short term\nso there's it's easier to get to what\nyou want to get to but with a book with\na talk with a obviously as a professor I\nmean everything you're teaching you know\npeople are going to practice it for\nyears potentially how do you feel\ncomfortable putting something out that's\nimperfect and incomplete this is a\nlittle embarrassing but I I have to say\nso I after writing the book I said all\nright I want to I want to use some of\nthe the psychometric tools that we were\ntrained in to create a fun quiz for\npeople to identify what their greatest\ncharacter strength is among those and\nthen also an area for growth so I finish\nthe quiz I sent it out to a bunch of\npeople to Pilot it and then it was time\nfor me to take it and after writing this\nwhole chapter about what I've learned\nabout being an\nimperfectionist my lowest score was\nimperfection ISM so I am not fully\nrecovered from perfectionism and it's\nsometimes hard for me to release things\nI think what's helped me is a couple\nthings one the calibration of saying\nokay if it's something as big as a book\nI a I'm aiming for a nine like this I'm\ngoing a pour a lot of time into it\nhopefully a lot of people are going to\nengage with it and so I really wanted to\nbe as good as I'm capable of doing at\nthat moment in my life if it's a a\nsocial media post like I'm content with\na six and some people might get angry at\nme some people might misunderstand me\nI'm definitely going to learn something\nand it's better to put out a bunch of\npotential sixes and and hit some eights\nthan to post once a year as somebody who\ncares a lot about both sharing knowledge\nand learning from other people's\nreactions to those you know those posts\nI think that's been really helpful and I\nguess what I've realized through that is\nif you never put anything out into the\nworld then you're actually limiting your\ncontribution MH and I think when when\npsychologist study regret it's pretty\nclear that in the short run people are\nafraid of failing but in the long run\nthey're more afraid of failing to try\nand that's that's kind of where I've\nI've come down is i' I'd rather fail\nthen fail to try it all it's really\nfascinating you said something there\nwhich which I really resonate with is\nthis idea that\npart of the learning is in the sharing\nand seeing reactions and I think we\nunderestimate like I could honestly sit\ndown and think I know everything about a\nsubject and keep quizzing myself and\nthink I know everything but the moment I\nshare it with someone else and they ask\na question I'll be like oh I should have\nin you know that that was missing I\ndidn't think of that and so sharing it\nin some form even if it's not the\ncomplete form but sharing a talk based\non one of the chapters or sharing I\noften do that with podcasts like when I\nhave an idea I'm like let me just record\na podcast episode about that and see\nwhat people have to think about it and\nit's a great way of just experimenting\nand testing and seeing what part of it I\ndidn't consider yes because someone will\nconsider it and we don't we don't see\nthat as part of the growth process we\nsee it as separate we see it as I'm\ngoing to make something complete people\ngoing to have exactly the reaction I\nwant to it and that will be the success\nof it yeah I think that's right I think\num the medium also matters so podcasting\nis a much more forgiving medium I think\nthan book writing 100% um because nobody\nexpects you to have said everything\nexactly right in the moment whereas yeah\nyou say something wrong in a book it's\nlike well shouldn't you have done your\nresearch why didn't you fact check that\nyeah one of the things I see a lot of\npeople hold back on when it comes to\nsharing anything they've created is so\nmany people limit themselves by saying I\ndon't want to\nself-promote I'm so glad we're going\nhere let's go there this this is not\nabout me I'm like good because there's a\nhuge difference between self-promotion\nand idea promotion promoting yourself is\nsaying look at me look at how great I am\nI'm special uh you're sharing the awards\nYou've Won you're posting a lot of\nselfies you're in the spotlight I think\nidea promotion is really different which\nis to say I made something I'm proud of\nI hope it's valuable to you I hope you\nget some joy out of it if you don't put\nthat out in the world you're depriving\npeople of benefiting from what you\npoured your heart into and that that to\nme seems like a mistake yeah did you\nalways feel like that or was something\nyou had to to wrap your head around\nbecause that's something I definitely\nhad to wrap my head around so I'm\nintrigued no I because as a professor I\njust don't imagine putting a book out\nand promoting like that doesn't come\nnaturally like that doesn't feel not at\nall no I remember a few weeks after I\ngot tenure a colleague wrote and and\nsaid hey I'm thinking about writing a\nbook about motivation you've done a lot\nof research in this area do you want to\nco-author it I wow I love I Lov working\nwith this collaborator um huge admirer\nof his work this is a great honor and\nI've always wanted to to figure out if\nthere's a way I could share my ideas\nmore broadly than just with the students\nI happen to meet in in the classroom I\nimmediately I had a lab meeting later\nthat day with a group of um of\nundergraduates and I told them I was\ngoing to do this and they had a mutiny\nlike no you cannot you cannot write a\nbook about somebody else's ideas you\nneed to write your own book like nope\ncan't do it I cannot do that this is\nlike I don't feel comfortable doing I I\nhardly even teach my own research in the\nclassroom I want to I want to share with\nyou the knowledge that I've found most\nuseful like I don't think my research is\nlike the most important thing for me to\nteach you and they push back really hard\nand they said look you have a\nresponsibility if you've invested a lot\nof of your own time and energy and you\nknow in the work that you do um to share\nthat more broadly and get it out there\nand see what people think of it and they\nbasically held me hostage they said\nyou're not leaving this lab meeting\nuntil you agree you will write your own\nbook before you help somebody else do\ntheirs and eventually they iic bullied\nme into into into\nagreeing and I I kind of came around and\nsaid okay this is what we do we don't\ncreate knowledge for it to collect Us in\nacademic journals or for it to only be\navailable to students who are lucky\nenough to get into an ively League\nschool like that's not right um I\nbelieve in democratizing knowledge so\nyeah I'm going to do this book came out\nuh a little bit beforehand I sent an\nemail to my network just saying hey you\nknow I wrote this book if you find it\ninteresting or you're useful would be\nreally grateful if you would help spread\nthe word the responses were so lovely\nbut I got one email that kind of crushed\nme in the moment and it was from an\nacademic colleague who said Dear Adam\nlove the book hate the\nself-promotion this was my fear and I\nthought about it and I ruminated about\nit and then it hit me this is not\nself-promotion it's idea\npromotion this is about the knowledge\ncontained in the book I went out of my\nway to site a bunch of um you know a\nlong list of researchers later I was\ntold too many I was trying to synthesize\na body of knowledge and get it out there\nand we have to be to a certain degree in\nthe spotlight in order to promote our\nwork and I think you know people want to\nconnect to the the author the narrator\num and so there's I think an amount of\nself-disclosure that's required but\nself-promotion that does not have to\nhappen and and I looked at the book and\nI said okay the main things I've shared\nabout myself are mistakes I made\nI failed and what I learned from those\nso I feel okay saying this was IDE\npromotion not self-promotion and that's\nfor me the litmus test ever since so\nthat I guess that's how I landed at that\ndistinction it's such a interesting\nthing for any artist any creative any\nacademic any any person who feels that\nthey've come across something worth\nsharing and that's why I've always been\na fan of anyone who has anything worth\nsharing because there are so many I\nthink isn't Ted's what's Ted's tagline\nor at one point spre ideas worth\nspreading like I like sharing better I\ndon't want to assume that every idea\nshould be spread but share it with\nsomeone and let's find out yeah sharing\nand and I think we all have ideas worth\nsharing we have insights worth sharing\nof some kind and especially if you're an\nartist Creator academic and I think for\nme it was it was very very similar\njourney to yours and it's so interesting\nto hear that academic circles and\nspiritual circles can often have the\nsame habits of behavior and for me when\nI wrote Think like a monk which was my\nfirst\nbook the biggest thing I was trying to\ndo and what I learned in my second book\nwhich I if I would have known in my\nfirst book I would have done this is\nkind of explain this thought process\nwhere I tried to do it intuitively in\nhow I shared it as opposed to explicitly\nspelled it out whereas now I'm much\nbetter at explicitly spelling out what\nI'm doing I did that to honor all monk\nTraditions so I studied lots of\ndifferent monk Traditions I spoke to\nlots of different monks and so it wasn't\njust the tradition I studied in so that\nwas very important to me because I\nbelieve that there were Traditions\nBeyond mine that would have values to\nshare and important messages to share\nthe other thing that I tried to do in\nthe book was I definitely have always\nwanted to make ancient wisdom accessible\npractical and relevant that has always\nbeen my mission because I'm trying to\nspeak to the 18-year-old kid that I was\nin\nLondon before I got into spirituality\nand meditation and mindfulness I'm not\ntrying to speak to the person I am now\nor someone who's already learned a ton\nand so to me to make it simple and\naccessible and relevant was my biggest\ncall and always has been and that can\noften come with the critique of you're\nwatering it down you're oversimplifying\nit this isn't the truth um in the way it\nshould be shared and the other thing was\nsimilar to you and I love that you said\nthat too I never shared an enlightened\nexperience in the book all the\nexperiences are mistakes there when\nmeditation went wrong there me being\nenvious they're me judging people\nthey're me wanting to get what the monks\nhave without having done the work like\nall the stories the the The Human\nExperience of a kid from London who\ndoesn't have the qualification to be\nwhere he is in this space trying to make\nsense of it and and and so the book was\nit wasn't think like me like that wasn't\nthe book it was called think like a monk\nlike I'm not a monk anymore and I want\nto show us how we can think like monks\nbut not live like monks and I think it\nwas really interesting to me just our\nagain it comes from our preconceived\nnotions on ideas language having baggage\nand thoughts where people were just like\noh but you're not a monk anymore so how\ndo you teach that and this isn't your\nlife and it was so interesting to me\nthat we couldn't learn from things that\nwere things I'd learned and gained as\nopposed to if you're not exactly that\nthing anymore then you can't teach it I\nI think there are things you could study\nthat you don't have to share if you were\njust really fascinated by um painting or\nRare Coins um you could say this is a\npersonal interest of mine and it's just\nit's my own curiosity I think you and\nchoosing to be a monk me and choosing to\nbe a psychologist we chose to take a\ndeep dive into the mind and human\nbehavior if we gain knowledge from that\nit feels like it's selfish not to share\nit like why would you keep that to\nyourself why should the wisdom of monks\nonly be accessible to monks AB doesn't\nseem right yeah it doesn't seem right at\nall it feels like taking away uh it\nfeels selfish and and also to honor\nthose people to me the book was honoring\nthese amazing people that have done it\nfor their whole lives and studies of\npeople who meditated for 40 years and\nyou know that's not me and and I just\nfound it interesting that yeah it's\nfascinating and there's a great book by\nAustin Cleon called show your work yes\nand I really like it and I recommend\nthat to anyone who's struggling with\nshowing their work because it's exact\nand I love the way you've differentiated\nbetween self-promotion and idea\npromotion and I really hope that that\nstays with people who are listening and\nwatching because if you have an idea\nthat you believe is worth sharing and\nworth helping people and supporting\npeople please don't hold on to it like\nplease don't hide it from the world\nbecause I worry for us to only be\nexposed to the same three ideas that\neveryone's exposed to because we hide\naway from all these other new ones\nsometimes I hear people hold back for\nanother reason which is they're afraid\nsomebody's going to steal their idea and\nAustin Cleon wrote about this in Ste\nlike an artist another book of his that\nI found very thought-provoking\nmy my response to that is you know what\nit is possible that somebody will steal\nyour idea most of the time that won't be\nintentional um but what what\npsychologists have sometimes called klep\nAmnesia where you misremember an idea as\nyour own and forget the source um that\ncan happen inadvertently you hear an\nidea um you know you don't necessarily\ntrack where you learned it um and then\nyou know it kind of bubbles up a month\nlater and you think you thought of it I\nthink that can happen ideas can get\nstolen on purpose they can get stolen by\naccident what I always want to say to\npeople who are afraid of their ideas\ngetting stolen is if you have one big\nidea and you're afraid of putting it out\nthere because you think someone else is\ngoing to steal it you don't have a lot\nof ideas and people who generally\nsucceed with ideas are people who are\nconstantly generating ideas and so what\nyou should do is you should generate a\nwhole portfolio of ideas and then you\nyou're not identified with any one of\nthem you don't feel attached to just one\nof them and then then the risk goes way\ndown yeah there's there's so many blocks\nthat we could talk about whether it's\nand I mean one's the ego right so there\nthe self-promotion is almost like an\ninverse ego so it's almost like we think\nwe're better because we're not promoting\nan idea it's like we we're we're doing\nright this yeah like that is ironic yeah\nright like it's like I think I'm better\nbecause I'm not monetizing or\ndemocratizing or popularizing anding\nyeah popularizing or publicizing an idea\nmakes it better to not do that you talk\nabout the ego differently but let's talk\nabout in that category first of all like\nit's it's interesting how that scen as a\nholier than thou kind of approach and I\ndon't think either is Hol I I just think\nthat one's compassionate and and to me\nthat's more what it is like I think when\nsomeone shares an idea about an\nexperience that I could never have to me\nthat's just compassion it's their\ncompassion to share it with me I mean\nthere's no reason why people can't have\nmultiple motives behind their behavior\nof course I actually I mean almost\nalways do all of us yeah Meed I think\nit's very rare that people are conscious\nof all their motives uh or willing to\nadmit to all of them but I I actually\nthink the most sustainable route to to\nunlocking people's hidden potential is\nto try to align their you know their\npersonal aspirations um with social good\nmhm and I don't think there's anything\nwrong with saying yeah I want to promote\nthis idea both because I wanted to help\nother people and because I appreciate\npeople respecting my knowledge and\nconsidering me a credible Source like I\nactually think it would be problematic\nif you're were like yep I care nothing\nabout my own reputation whatsoever like\nonly Character Matters to me and even if\npeople think I'm an idiot and I'm\ndishonest and I lack Integrity like as\nlong as I know I'm a good person that's\ngood like that's just not functional in\nthe social world and so I think we\nshould give people this is another we\nneed to give people the the space to to\nsay yes like I do I do want to be valued\nand appreciated for things that I think\nare important and I want to add value to\nother people too oh I'm so glad you went\nthere yeah it's so important it's so\nimportant to allow ourselves that too\nlike yeah do I like it when someone\nleaves me a nice review on the podcast\nor the book of course I do yeah I love\nit it feels great and do I do things\nbecause they make me feel good yes I do\nand and and at the same time it comes\nfrom a place of wanting to do good in\nthe world and wanting to spread ideas\nthat will help people and serve people\nand support people and hopefully help\nthem transform their own lives uh and it\ncomes from both of those places I want\nto do things that make me feel good and\ndo good in the world like I I think\nthat's I don't know any other way\nactually I don't either yeah and I don't\nknow how to live in a world if I only\ntried to do good to others I would\nautomatically feel good from that anyway\nbut if I was only to do things that were\nonly good for me I don't think I'd be\nsatisfied either no I mean you you'd\nlack the purpose that so much of your\nwork concentrates on what was the thing\nyou found most surprising when writing\nhidden potential about hidden potential\nspecifically that kind of you were like\noh wow I didn't I never thought I'd find\nthis I think the first one was was the\nidea that learning character skills can\nbe more powerful than learning cognitive\nskills assuming that you have a\nfoundation in you know in in thinking\nskills um that like learning to embrace\ndiscomfort and become more of a sponge\nand accept the right imperfections like\nthat that could fuel more growth than\nyou know if you're an entrepreneur like\nlearning finance and marketing stunning\nand that you can learn those skills in\nyour 4S and 50s as opposed to thinking\nthat those character skills are set when\nyou're young um that that I found\nliberating um and encouraging so that\nwas a surprise I think that maybe a\nbigger surprise though just as I I think\nthrough the insights that I picked up as\nI was I was investigating I think I had\nthis image of people who you know not\njust achieve greater things but achieve\nthe greatest things I had this image\nthat they just figured out how to make\nthe Daily Grind just\ntolerable I think about Steph Curry just\nyou know drilling over and over again to\nshoot as well as he does I assumed that\nhe just figured out how to not mind the\nmonotony and the boredom and the\nexhaustion and he would just power\nthrough it and he had a a superhuman\nability to tolerate extreme amounts of\ndiscomfort light bulb um reading the\nresearch on deliberate practice was like\nit's not that motivating for a lot of\npeople to just do the same activity\nrepetitively over and over again if\nyou're Steph Curry shooting is fun like\ndoing Wind Sprints and then trying to\nmake baskets when you can hardly breathe\nand doing that over and over again like\nnot anybody's I Joy like not my idea of\njoy and I don't I don't think it's\nstephs either and through the the\nresearch I read and through spending\ntime with um with his trainer who\ndesigned this set of routines that had\nreally elevated his game I realized the\ndeliberate play is a huge part of\npractice and we don't give it enough\ncredit that you know if you're Steph\nlike you play a game to see how many\nbaskets you can make in a minute and a\nhalf and then you've got a Target to\nshoot for and you're competing against\nyourself or you're competing against a\nclock and all of a sudden that that\nsupercharges your motivation especially\nin the summer when nobody's you know\nwhen you're not actually playing\nbasketball games that really count and I\nlooked at that and thought why do we\nhave to turn the Daily Grind into such a\ngrind like yes there are times when we\nall have to push ourselves but pushing\nyourself day after day is not a\nsustainable routine and what we want to\ndo is try to figure out how to redesign\npractice and skill development so that\nthere are you could break skills down\ninto these enjoyable pieces and then\nmake them more playful you you mentioned\nan Coyle um I love the culture code and\none of my favorite ideas that he wrote\nabout was the difference between shallow\nfun and deep fun I think shallow fun is\ngamification it's tricking people into\nenjoying practice even though they don't\nreally like it because there's a carrot\nthat's being dangled at the end I think\nthe Deep fun is about saying we want to\nactually take the process of learning\nitself and make it enjoyable and so you\nknow the step example is a great one um\nbut it's easy to think about that in\nbasketball Evelyn Glenny a percussionist\nsaying like let me figure out if I could\nharmonize Bach on a snare drum like what\na cool way to make learning percussion\nplayful and I think that that was a big\naha for me I think that I I had come to\nsee play as a reward for finishing my\nto-do list and mastering a skill and now\nI realize it's got to be on the to-do\nlist and it's got to be part of learning\na skill that resonates so strongly as\nwell again it's like yeah the the\nprocess has to be fun meaningful and\nfulfilling in and of itself not just a\nreward trying to think about an activity\nthat I've done that with that just felt\nimpossible to do it with have you have\nyou was what was the thought experiment\nthat you did there was well I I was\nwondering this this had to I I feel like\nmonks are often misunder\nas like complete denial of any Earthly\njoy and I I don't I don't see how a\nhuman could ever function in that\nenvironment so I guess the question is\nyou had to do a lot of hard stuff as as\na monk especially I imagine in training\nMH like how did you make that playful\nyou made it playful by laughing at\nyourself like it was it was right so I\nthe thing that came to mind was often\nwe'd walk down a path and we'd be asked\nto find a new stone and the goal was to\nfind something and be really present\nwith it and you know be aware of it its\ncolors its texture its shape everything\nyou'd want to practice through a\nmindfulness practice and what the mind\nwould do is I'd find a stone for today\nand I'd find a stone for tomorrow so\nthat I didn't have to do the same\nactivity tomorrow because we want to\nmake things easier mentally and we're\nalways trying to cheat the system or or\nyou know break the game so my mind would\ndo that very naturally I'd find two\nstones all right saw that one where that\nis behind that tree to today I'll pick\nthis one tomorrow I found one anyway and\nthen we'd get to the next day and the\nteacher would say all right today we're\ntrying to find a petal like and they\njust switch it up on you and you'd laugh\nat your own mind like you'd find it\nhilarious that your mind was trying to\ngain the system but the monks were too\nyou know they already were one step they\nalready one step ahead of you they\nalready know that cheat codes are\nalready built in exactly and so I think\nthings like that where learning to laugh\nat yourself brought play when you saw\nthe monkey mind as you mentioned earlier\nyou laughed at it you didn't you went\nharsh on yourself you didn't if you saw\nmonkey and I've seen monkeys do this in\nIndia steal people's sunglasses uh cut\nbags if you're holding it to grab fruit\nD Coke yeah Diet Coke whatever CH it get\nit back stealing I've seen them steal\ncredit cards like out of people's hands\nif they're paying for something you\ndon't look at that and go what an idiot\nlike what's wrong with you you just\nthink oh monkeys and you just laugh and\nand that's partly what the mind is like\nlike it's it's funny to watch the flawed\nmind uh and not take it so seriously and\nrecognize that that it's just how it's\nbuilt and how it's How it acts I I like\nthat a lot it it seems that's what came\nto mind yeah I mean I think the idea of\nyou know of taking your your goals and\nyour growth seriously but not yourself\nand your ego that seriously is obviously\npowerful there it also sounds like your\nteachers really appreciated the\nimportance of of novelty and variety\nabsolutely saying all right like we got\nto switch up stones for pedals just to\nkeep making this interesting and and\nmake sure you don't lose your curiosity\nyeah and just recognizing that you were\ngoing to you know I remember saying to\none of my teachers once I was like I was\nlike oh you know I'm just really\nstruggling with my ego I don't think\nit's ever going to go away it's so big\nit's so hard to deal with I see it come\nup in so many scenarios and they just be\nlike relax just you know it's okay like\nyour ego will always be there just do\nyour service like it wasn't seen with as\nmuch like kind of pain and stress\nbecause they understood it's hard they\nget that like they know what the mind is\ngoing to do and so why would they react\nto it with this like very serious and\nkind of imprison undertone rather than\nlike yeah it's going to be there just do\nit anyway I I like that idea of just\njust do it anyway it's going to be there\ndo it anyway like okay so you might feel\nyou have too much of an ego to give a\ngive a talk do it anyway and be aware of\nit right be aware of something and do it\nanyway is far better than wait till you\novercome your ego to do something like\nthat you'll be waiting for the rest of\nyour life it will never disappear and\nthat's just ego it could be anything\nobviously like Envy or any of the things\nyou mentioned I don't know that it's\nrealistic to expect it to disappear\naltogether I think what you want is to\nbe you want it to be in the rear of your\nmirror so that it's not your primary\nfocus but your you're checking in on it\nevery once in a while exactly Adam there\nare so many things in Hidden potential\nwe could talk for hours and hours and I\ndon't I want people to actually read the\nbook I want be able to pick it up I want\nyou to go and grab a copy of hidden\npotential the science of achieving\ngreater things as we've talked about\ntoday there's such a need for Progress\nthere's such a need for growth I think\nthis book breaks it down makes it simple\nin a way that I love and I admire but on\non top of all of that it's packed with\ngreat stories case studies science and\nresearch to back it all up and in Adam's\nsignature style of making it fun uh the\nnatural humor that always comes through\nbut thank you for doing this and I\nwanted to ask you Adam is there anything\nyou haven't shared either from the book\nor that's coming your mind and heart\nthat you're like Jay I really want\npeople to know this or share this and it\nmay not be but I want to give you the\nfloor Ah that's well you as always too\nkind um no I mean I the only thing is\nI'm second guessing I'm like was that\nthe most surprising thing should there\nbeen a more surprising thing I am right\nnow failing my imperfectionist test like\nit doesn't matter which one I picked\nbecause no one knows what the\nAlternatives were but I am curious uh so\nwe talked about deliberate play being\nyou know potentially as important or\nmore important than deliberate practice\nfor growth the other two that I was just\nstarting to think about were um that\nwhen you get stuck you often have to\nmove back to move forward that before\npeople leap in a scale they they have to\ndip that that was aha that I did not\nhave before yeah that it's better you\nwere talking about climbing the mountain\nthe idea of like yeah yeah like that\nit's better if you're stuck not just to\nstand there but to walk backwards to\nkind of and find a new route yes or a\nbetter method actually most of us don't\nmove backwards to move forwards we've\nremained stuck because we're too\nembarrassed to move backwards or we feel\ntoo like we've reached somewhere to move\nbackwards like there's a comfort I don't\nwant to give up the gains that I made\nyes yes that's exactly and so like why\nwould I start over when I've already put\nso much time into to getting where I got\nthat sun cost bias is uh that was huge\nfor me I remember learning about that in\nlike a level economics like 18 years 17\n18 years old and thinking what a great\nconcept to understand that and I kind of\ngave that up very naturally but I saw\nthat As I Grew Older people who'd\nstudied something especially some I had\nfriends who would become lawyers or\ndoctors but then didn't enjoy it or\ndidn't see that as their path directly\neven and having to Pivot from that was\nso hard because you worked so hard to\nachieve something that is rare and hard\nand difficult yeah one of one of the\nthings I I would like to remind my\nstudents of when they they they come to\noffice hours and they're in tunnel\nvision like I have to do the prescribed\nthing like my parents want me to be a\ndoctor or everyone in my family went to\nlaw school I always want to say to them\nlisten I I understand that you're\nalready down this path like you've done\nthe Premed thing or you're already like\nyou know you're already in the program\nbut what's worse realizing that you\nwasted the last two years or going on to\nwaste the next 20 m it's not a hard\ncalculus and so I think maybe the\nantidote to Sun cost is opportunity cost\nto say yeah you know what you have\nalready invested a whole bunch in this\nbut think about all the growth and all\nthe joy that you're giving up on if you\ndon't shift gears yeah yeah I think I\nmean I think about that all the time in\nmy own life and it's hard because you\nnever know it then and it's the old\nSteve Jobs quote of you can't connect\nthe dots moving forwards you only\nbackward yeah only backwards and it's\nhard to remind people almost as their\nfuture self and I I think that is the\nactivity that's what I did I I fast\nforwarded when I was working in the\ncorporate world I fast forwarded 20\nyears and I asked myself would I be\nhappy doing what I see other people\ndoing 20 years ahead of me and the\nanswer was no and so I was like well\nthen anything will be better than this\nbecause if the answer is no and it's not\nthat they had bad jobs or they weren't\nhappy it's that I wouldn't be happy\ndoing what they were doing 20 years from\nthen and so if you're not then you can't\nkeep following the same path uh Adam I\nactually have two more questions from\nyou that I just saw my notes that I I\nactually don't want to miss asking these\nto you this comes from part three\nsystems of opportunity opening doors and\nwindows and I had these two questions\nthat I think are really interesting we\ntalked about certain challenges of our\nschool system and what we find wrong but\nthis was the interesting part for me do\nyou believe children should be able to\nchoose what they study um I think that's\na really fascinating concept one of my\nfriends\nruns schools where kids do get to choose\nuh it's private and uh I'm always\nfascinated by this idea of we've gone\nfrom living in a world that kids had no\nchoice we naturally swing to the other\nside of the pendulum where we want to\ngive kids all Choice what what did you\ndiscover I think this is really\ncomplicated so the the research on the\nParadox of choice suggests that there is\nsuch a thing as too much Choice first of\nall there's a lot of debate about how\npervasive that is um it's much worse to\nhave no choice than too much m much\nworse uh so it's easier to manage the\nproblem of too many options than it is\nto create Freedom where it's absent I\nthink that's clear the second thing is\nwe can we can think about bundling and\nsort of bucketing choices in a way that\num maybe gets the best of both worlds so\num I think it's potentially helpful for\nstudents to have choices within\nconstraints um for example so you ask if\nyou're an elementary school teacher you\nask kids to read 30 minutes a night but\nthey get to pick the book m I think\nthat's the kind of choice we're looking\nfor early on I think later probably in\nhigh school every kid should take some\nmath but I don't think everyone needs to\ntake trig trigonometry has never been\nuseful in my life in a heartbeat I would\nI would throw out the trig curriculum\nand replace it with uh statistics which\nI think actually is useful for how\npeople think and what they do in the\nworld but not everyone feel there no\ncognitive benefits of doing trig either\nlike are there no because I often think\nabout things not being as literal and\nthink oh wait is my brain developing by\nthinking that ways I have never seen a\nrandomized controlled experiment saying\nthat learning trigonometry will teach\nyou a set of thinking skills that's\ninvaluable like I don't think there's\nanything about sign and cosine that you\nwould get that you can't get through\ngeometry would be my would be my hunch\nas a psychologist but I have not done\nthat experimen or that series of\nexperiments I think but what I would say\nis like within I mean colleges are much\nbetter at this right saying there's a\nmath requirement but we give you a menu\nof options and you can choose within\nthat um nobody wants to go to a\nrestaurant and have a menu with a\nthousand options um but if they kind of\nknow what they like they can say I can\nlook at that category and I can choose\nwithin it and I think that's where I\nwould want choice to land for um for\nkids at different levels yeah and it's\nso hard to you know hidden potential as\na kid and as we grow is so difficult\nbecause if I was asked what I liked\ngrowing up now I can easily say that I\nthink I was naturally drawn towards the\narts and design and philosophy and I can\nsee it even more clearly now but it\nwould have been really hard for someone\nI don't know how how would you be better\nat spotting hidden potential in schools\nand in young people earlier on so that\nwe can kind of hopefully better guide\nand Coach people as opposed to have them\nbecome preds or or con complete a career\nand then having a pivot well I think the\nthe person who's best suited to see your\nhidden potential is often the one who\nknows you best and I don't think we give\nteachers enough opportunity to get to\nknow kids I love the research um un\nlooping that I wrote about uh in the\nchapter on um on what we can learn from\ncountry countes like Finland and Estonia\nbut even here in the US um there's\nstrong evidence from multiple states\nwith millions of students in elementary\nand middle school that if they just\nhappen to have the same teacher for two\nyears in a row they achieve more gains\nin math and raing which is remarkable\nand I know there are tons of parents who\nare afraid of this idea like what if my\nkid gets stuck with Professor Snape for\ntwo years instead of one that's the end\nof the world it turns out that not only\nis it good for kids to have the same\nteacher for multiple years but that when\nkids are struggling and teachers are\nstruggling they actually benefit more\nfrom the extended relationship and I\ndon't think it's hard to unpack why this\nis I think when you know when when a\nteacher moves up with a student they\ndon't lose all this information in the\nhandoff from one to the next um they\nunderstand the students strengths and\nopportunities for growth they also have\nseen this the distance that the student\nhas traveled and so instead of just\nsaying well like a new teacher well that\nstudent didn't shine in math to say wow\nthat student was really behind in math\nand now is right on track with the class\nI think there's some hidden potential\nthere I think every school on Earth\nshould let kids have the same teacher\nfor multiple years and um I think it's\nnot a huge effect in the data but I\nthink it's a meaningful one it is one of\nthe biggest I mean even in spiritual\neducation and and teaching and guidance\nit's that's the only way it works like\nthe the practices that my monk teachers\ncreated for me were very different from\nwhat they created for other students\nbecause it was all about specific\nlearning and specific growth and so some\nof the practices I did were not normal\nfor others and some of the practices\nother people did were not normal for me\nbecause you trusted that your teacher\nwas getting to know you better and\ntherefore would create plans whether\nsome of that included travel for example\nI would be asked to travel back more to\nLondon to teach while I was a monk uh\nbecause they saw that that would be a\nuseful skill set for me that would be a\nuseful experience for me of me going\nback to the country I was from and\nhaving to connect there and that wasn't\npart of everyone else's training and so\nI I've always been a fan since my\ntraining in that way of having the same\nteacher and even till this day I still\ngo back to the same monk teacher who\nknows me much better and now he has like\nso much data on me because he known me\nsince I was 18 years old and so he has\n18 years of insight of knowing me and\nmany of those years living together\nwhere the his ability to say oh my gosh\ndo you remember when you used to be like\nthis and this challenge would trip you\nup and look at you now like you you and\njust that context is so useful to hear\nfrom a student uh like you're saying\nlike whether it was hey you know you\nwere struggling with math last year and\nlast year you got C and this year you\ngot B but I actually noticed that you\nknow whatever I I think it's huge I\nactually think it's huge and that that's\na great Coda to the earlier point about\nyou want a coach to work them out of a\njob but then you want to be able to go\nback to that coach at inflection points\nfor a fresh perspective or for somebody\nwho has that continuity yeah and so I\nthink over time the hope is that you\ndon't rely on that person dayto day\nanymore of course um as a crutch but\nthey are the person who I guess has the\nmost accurate mirror yeah absolutely and\nthat's at least from a Eastern\nphilosophy point of view education was\nalways meant to be the the guru as it\nwould have been called at the time and\nand a small enough glass for the guru to\nget to know the class well enough in\norder to spot hidden potential and their\npsychophysical nature and their Dharma\nword for purpose in order to ignite that\nspark deeper and that requires a lot of\ntraining for the guru and and an\nopenness from the students as well but\nyeah you're right it's not just Choice\nas well it's not just like hey choose\nwhat you want yeah it's it's beautiful\nthank you so much Adam this has been\namazing it's than you always a joy I\nlove how our conversations go from\nwhat's wrong with the school system to\nwhy we're not idea promoting in enough\nall the way through to you know how do\nwe choose what we need to work on what\nis a weakness what are imperfections and\nagain it's all inside this book called\nhidden potential uh the science of\nachieving greater things highly\nrecommend it from Adam we'll put the\nlink in the comments and the caption for\nyou to get it uh thank you so much Adam\nfor doing this I appreciate you thank\nyou Jay it's been uh it's been a joy and\nalso a privilege and I think we've never\nspoken other than when we're recorded So\nwe uh we need to do a little bit more of\nthis I think I would love that and\nappreciate and welcome it thank you so\nmuch thank you yeah thanks if you love\nthis episode you will enjoy my interview\nwith Dr Daniel aan on how to change your\nlife by changing your brain if we want a\nhealthy mind it actually starts with a\nhealthy brain you know I've had the\nblessing or the curse to scan over a\nthousand convicted felons and over 100\nmurderers and their brains are very\ndamaged"
