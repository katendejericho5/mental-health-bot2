    "transcript": "it was one day no one cared what I did\nno one cared what I wore what I looked\nlike what I said and then all of a\nsudden that was all anyone would talk\nabout I think back to some of the things\nthat I said in interviews yeah hate\ncomments don't bother me and I was like\nyou went home and cried all night\nbecause of it while filming season 3 our\nentire family was going through a lot\nit's hard to watch back those episodes I\nsay I don't know to everything but the\nthing is I don't know who I\nam before we jump into this episode I'd\nlike to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett I want to say this to you because\nI don't think I've ever talked about\nthis with you but you come up in more\nconversations or when I'm doing Keynotes\non stages and it's really funny because\nI kind of think of you randomly and\noften I want to share this with you I've\nnever said this to you and it comes up\nbecause I have watched your journey from\nafar as everyone has for such a long\ntime and I've really deeply admired just\nhow phenomenally skilled you are at what\nyou do I think you're a phenomenal\ndancer you're an incredible performer\nthank you and if I'm ever presenting or\ntalking to anyone about social media or\ndigital or whatever it is I always bring\nyour name up because I think you're one\nof those people that obviously got your\nmoment on Tik Tok when it took off and\neverything but I feel like there were\njust years and years of practice and\nhard work that went behind it that we\ndon't always see and I just I just\nwanted to share that with you as we kick\noff today that I think it's incredible\nand I think you've been practicing for\nthis life that you live since you were\nlike four years old and so I I always\ntry and highlight that and so I don't\nknow I I think of you in that context\noften so no thank you I mean I\nappreciate that I think when it comes to\nsocial media it's very easy to get on\nyourself and say it was just luck but to\nhear that from someone like you is\ndefinitely you know puts it into a\ndifferent perspective that I don't\nalways let myself feel which is really\nnice good I'm glad thank you do you\nstill kind of kid yourself and just say\nit's luck to yourself now after all\nthese years do you still feel like that\nway I do and I think that you know\nhaving that in the back of my mind\ndefinitely keeps me a little bit more\nhumble and helps me you know this wasn't\nsomething that I was asking for looking\nfor but I mean I've all like my entire\nlife I've been filming videos whether\nit's like I was 10 and look at how I do\nthis or this how I do my makeup like\nalways just making videos that was\nalways something I loved and I never\nshared them with anyone until Tik Tok so\nit's really it's crazy to think back\nabout those times and how they probably\nreally did help me get to where I am now\nI love what you said that luck or\nviewing your success as luck helps you\nstay humble I think that's such a\nbeautiful trait and quality to Aspire\nfor and to always practice at the same\ntime though I'm guessing that when you\nsee it through the lens of love\nsometimes it can affect your self-esteem\nor selfworth because you're like oh I\njust got lucky and maybe I don't deserve\nthis I don't know if those thoughts come\nup at the same time as trying to stay\nhumble there's this side of like low\nself-esteem that we all go through I\nmean absolutely I think it's hard not to\nfeel that way especially a lot of my\njourney was everyone telling me that I\ndidn't deserve it kind of feeding into\nthat and it's starting to really affect\nyou know know how I think about myself\ndo I deserve anything why am I where I\nam I don't do anything special I'm not\ndifferent than anyone there's millions\nof people that would probably be better\nat my job than I am but somehow it's me\nand you know I kind of try and separate\nmyself online from who I am in person I\nalways like to say it's Charlie demilio\nwho everyone else sees and Charlie who I\nam when it's just me and you know you\nreally have to appreciate the things\nthat you work hard for because I feel\nlike those are the moments where I\nreally do feel proud of myself because I\ndon't always even when achieving these\namazing things I'm like well it's not\nreally me it's the people that are\nwatching me that got me here you know\nlike they could have done this to anyone\nbut when it comes to things like Dancing\nwith the Stars or hosting the Kids\nChoice Awards like those were two of\nprobably my favorite accomplishments of\nmine because I really felt like I had to\nwork for that and it was just moments\nwhere I I really truly felt proud of\nmyself and I don't feel like that very\noften I'm so glad that you shared that\nwith us because yeah it's it's\ninteresting isn't it it's like the\nreason why you did so well on both of\nthose is because you've done it for\nyears and years and years but sometimes\nyou need to have a moment where you're\nworking really hard on one specific\nthing so that you can see it how long\ndid it take you to make\nthis awareness of like there's Charlie\ndemilio and then there's Charlie like\nhow long did it take you to figure that\nout for yourself and to even explain it\nin that way yeah it definitely took\nme a while I always knew in the back of\nmy mind I was like I would do certain\nbrand deals or ads and they'd have this\ncreative and I do it and I put on this\nlike super happy smiley like obviously\ncatering to a younger audience which I\nlove doing but that's not who I am at\nheart and I think growing up and I\nstarted this when I was what 15 years\nold and then I was turning 17 and 18 and\nI was you know getting tattoos and I\nwould curse and everyone would be like\nwhoa this is crazy and I was like this\nis what I do in my normal day-to-day\nlife like this is who I am so I really\njust had to the version that people\ndon't like isn't even me you know it's\nwhat they nitpick out of certain things\nthat I do and I think coming to that\nrealization honestly over the past few\nmonths maybe this past year I think has\nbeen probably one of the most helpful\nthings to not let what other people say\nget to me I empathize and feel so\ncompassionate for how difficult that\ncould be to be that young and to have\nmillions and millions and millions of\npeople having an opinion on everything\nfrom what you wear to what what you say\nto what you do and who you date and just\neverything right like I can't imagine\nbeing your age and being put under a\nmagnifying glass like in the way you\nhave which I think is also very unique\nbecause I think Tik Tok put people under\na magnifying glass in a way that it also\nnever been done before it's like a first\ntime thing so what has changed\nabout then 15 and you're only 18 now so\nit's only been 3 years right 19 19 now\n19 so it's been four years yeah in those\nfour years what\nhas what would you say is the\nbiggest change that you've seen\nin who you thought you were then and who\nyou are now I think I just you know I\nwas in high school it was one day no one\ncared what I did no one cared what I\nwore what I looked like what I said and\nthen all of a sudden that was all anyone\nwould talk about it it happened so fast\nand I put up a a shield to kind of\nprotect myself which helped me but also\nhurt me a little bit because it was hard\nto get out of that shell and I mean I\nthink back to some of the things that I\nsaid in interviews like three years ago\nyeah hate comments don't bother me and I\nwas like you went home and cried all\nnight because of it like I would say\nthings to make people think one thing\nbut inside I was very\nsheltered and I went through a a pretty\nbig stage for maybe like the first two\nyears where I always looked out for the\nbest in people and I got myself hurt a\nlot you know people wanted to make\nvideos together and and they would\ninvite me over for collabs and then they\nwould all hang out and I wouldn't be\ninvited and I would I would be so\nconfused and the excuse was always\nyou're too young or you know whatever\nand I was like you guys are just just\nhanging out at a house like how am I too\nyoung for that but not too young to have\nin all your videos and it took a lot of\nyou know distancing myself a lot of\ntalking to my family going to therapy\nyou know figuring out who I am outside\nof anyone watching\nto be a little bit more content with\nmyself and understand that I don't need\nto have all of these people like me you\nknow I'm fine on my own I love being by\nmyself I'm fine with the friends that I\nhave in my corner that I've had for\nyears are the new friends that come into\nmy life that actually love me for me and\nyou know there's nothing that I can do I\nfeel like now I'm kind of at a point\nwhere you know whatever like that's kind\nof my motto I always am just like all\nright okay I don't I don't know I don't\ncare and focusing more on the things\nthat really matter to me like it sounds\nso lame cuz I constantly talk about my\ndogs like they're my children but\nliterally like spending the day with\nthem taking care of them my\nresponsibility being them and not myself\nI don't have to worry about work or\nanything they don't care if I have a\nmillion followers or none like I don't\nknow just focusing more on the things\nthat actually matter the fans that\nactually love me no matter what like\nhave been there for years or brand new\nand actually like who I am and not just\nwhat I put out you know yeah and it's\nand it's so hard because so much of what\nyou put out is you or is a part of you\nand it can feel like the biggest part of\nyou because it gets the biggest response\nyeah and it's it's almost confusing in\nyour brain to be like when you're with\nyour dogs it's a small part of your life\nor there's a small amount of people\nthere but it's actually a bigger yeah\nbigger importance or bigger significance\nto you cuz I have so much life that no\none sees I have so much about me that no\none knows about and I'm fine with that\nyou know I don't\nfeel like I need to change myself for\nanyone because I've I did that for so\nlong and it was so exhausting and I\nworked so much while being so burnt out\nand just wanting to kind of get away\nfrom everyone yeah that now what I want\nto do is definitely a lot more important\nthan what everyone's telling me to do\nand that's and that's really tough like\nwhen I've spoken to even like young M\nmusicians and and music stars it's like\nmost people get their break when they're\nlike 15 years old or something like that\nand naturally everyone's older than you\nand as a 15-year-old you're used to\nhaving parents or people older than you\ntelling you what to do and so whether\nit's your manager or whether it's your\nagent or your team or whatever it is\nthey book you and then you're doing what\nthey say cuz you're doing what the\nadults say it's kind of normal and now\nthat you're an adult yourself you're\nkind of like trying to take that back\nwhat was it that you felt you did that\nwasn't you or that you felt you were\ndoing because the adults are saying to\ndo it or what were those things that you\nfelt like you moved away from who you\nwanted to be or who you were I think I\nyou know for quite some time tried to\njust do whatever anyone said to make\nthem like me whether it was how I\ndressed or how I talked or what I said\nanything what type of videos I make I\nwas listening to every comment whether\nit was\nlike I hate that hoodie well I'm never\nwearing that again like this person\ndoesn't like it and dictating every\ndecision I made through what other\npeople said and I mean\nfor a long time the beginning um I was\nonly only surrounded by a bunch of\nadults and 25-year-olds and all of this\nstuff and they would always say how\nmature I am but I was just trying to fit\nin you know I was still in high school\nstill like you know you want to be with\nthe cool kids so the people that I\nthought was cool I would do anything to\nbe like them you know dress different\nevery day or or speak about specific\nthings or try to sound cool or change\nmyself and it's just so not worth it cuz\nwhy why am I going to do that and how\nlong am I going to do that until they\nrealize that it's like okay we get it\nlike you like whatever we like you don't\nhave to do that you know it's just I\nthink it's it's so unfair to yourself\nto have to do that all the time I love\nthat I love that you use that word\nunfair yeah it's almost like it's just\nunfair to do that to yourself that that\nreally hit me and resonated with me\nbecause it's it's almost like you're\njust doing yourself such a big\ndisservice by molding yourself into what\nyou think someone wants and that was\njust a thought they had on one day in\none second in one comment and then and\nthen you have no idea who you are I I\nhad to sit with myself and say I have no\nidea what I like I have no idea how I\nwant to dress I have no idea how I want\nto do my makeup or what's my favorite\nsong or what's my favorite movie I just\nI don't know like I do not know anything\nabout myself and my answer to every\nquestion was I don't know and I actually\nhad to talk to my therapist about this\nand I was like I say I don't know to\neverything but the thing is I really\ndon't know I don't know who I am I feel\nlike all I know is what anyone tells me\nto do and I mean it's it's a really\nweird feeling because how do you get out\nof that how do you find out what you\nlike but you really just have to try\nthings get out of your house I was not\nleaving my\nhouse ever like I would go through these\nphases where I don't want anyone to talk\nto me I don't want to do anything I just\nwant to stay in my room all day watch TV\nlike not get ready nothing and I've been\nreally low a couple times and I think\nthis Pastime that I got really low was\nwhen I was like okay my parents even\nsaid they were like we're not going to\nlet you we're not going to sit here and\nwatch you rot in bed all day and not do\nanything and just like we can't do that\nthat's so unfair and especially when you\ndon't live with your parents and they're\nnoticing that it's an issue so I had to\nkind of really dig deep and ask the\nquestions\nthat I didn't ask for so long for\nwhatever reason maybe I didn't want to\nknow the answer or it was too much or\nscary to figure it out and be your own\nperson but I think it's just so much\neasier and I and I think it's also just\nyou know being it's really hard when\nyou're living your own journey and then\nyou realize as you're getting older and\nas you are maturing as as everyone does\nyou're looking back going I can't really\nexpect my 15-year-old self to know all\nthis anyway like I think you know for me\nwhen I think about being back to 15 and\nI didn't know anything about myself and\nI wasn't dealing with the pressures you\ndealt with or the challenges that you\nhad and sure I had different challenges\nand different stresses as I'm sure\neveryone does has their own thing but\nthe point is that as a 15-year-old self\nyou don't really know what you like\nanyway because it is true you are trying\nto be with the cool kids or you are\ntrying to be like the other people and\nyou're getting involved in all sorts of\nthings just for people to give you\napproval and validate you and then all\nof a sudden it's amazing that you're now\ncoming to that point where you're like I\nwant to know and I think what I love\nabout what you said is and it's because\nI said this often in my books and my\nwork is that knowing what movies you\nlike what foods you like what songs you\nlike that is the beginning of\nself-awareness like it's that basic it's\nit's not this\ncomplicated Deep thing that it begins\nwith it really starts with those things\nit starts with these really simple\neveryday choices that we all have to\nmake so I want to ask you simple\neveryday choices what is it now that\nCharlie likes like what is it that\nCharlie has discovered that not Charlie\ndemilio but Charlie enjoys and\nappreciates that what are the joys of\nlife that your dogs obviously you\nmention but what are some of the things\nthat brings you Joy that you feel you're\ndiscovering for the first time things\nthat bring me joy I love cleaning that's\nsomething that sounds so lame but it's\nso therapeutic I love um what about\ncleaning cuz I know I want to know now\nthe way you said that was so much\ngenuine I'm like all right what about\ncleaning honestly to me it's just\ntherapeutic like put something on my TV\nclean my room organize my stuff make it\nhow I like it you know because there can\nbe certain things that oh well you know\nthis is cool I guess I like this but\nwhat picture do I want out what am I\nproud of and want presented how do I\nlike my bed made how do I like my\nChargers to be set up it's like such\nminuscule things that I think make such\na difference and it also makes you feel\nproductive and makes me feel like I have\nmy stuff together and I mean as someone\nwho struggles with obsessive compulsive\ndisorder that's one of my like big\nthings where I feel like when I'm doing\nthat I'm almost clearing my head so I\ndon't know it's just something that I\ngenuinely enjoy doing and I think is\nsuper fun like this morning cuz I've had\nsuch bad jet lag I was like okay I can\neither try to go to sleep for the next 3\nhours or get up and clean the kitchen\nand play with the dogs and I was like\nall right let's just get up and do it\nyou know I'll get up in 5 minutes and\nwe'll start to do this stuff you order\nyour coffee and do all the things that\nyou need to do to feel together and that\nmade me happy and I was really proud I\ndid that and I started my day on a great\nnote and now I feel great so it's just\nlike little things that I just I find so\nmuch fun in mhm yeah no I I mean the\nteam will attested this too I'm like\naddicted to organizing shelves and\nbookshelves so I'll take you to the\nhouse afterwards and I have like I have\nthis bookshelf in there that I\npersonally curated and like everything\nand like even if my wife moves one book\nI'll notice it and I'll be like where's\nthat book going but it's like I get that\nlike organizing spaces and creating\nspaces to be spaces you want to live in\nand sit in like even this room right now\nlike I curated it because I want to be\nin this space and I want it to feel\ncomfortable for my guest and for myself\nand I want it to also spark curiosity or\nwhatever it may be and I think it's\ninteresting how all these tiny things\nwhen you're intentional about them they\ncan spark so much joy without trying\nthat hard and I mean it might be a\nlittle bit of\nlike the very few parts of my life that\nI genuinely get to control you know it's\nnot up to anyone else it's not you know\ndo it this way or wear this or show this\nproduct it's like I just get to do this\nand make it how I want the way I want it\non my own schedule and I'm fully in\ncontrol of this task start to finish\nwhich you know yeah it's a way to deal\nwith being a little bit of a control\nfreak yeah no and you're right I think\nthat's such a great point it's rare that\nwe have that much certainty and control\nover anything in in life and if we don't\ndo it at home we're going to potentially\ntry and do it everywhere else where we\ncan't and no I think that's a great\npoint what else would you say that\nyou've discovered about your likes and\ndislikes like what was something that\nyou thought you liked before or someone\nhad told you to like before and now\nyou're like uh I you change now like\nthat's not how I feel about it o um\nthere's definitely a few I'd say one\nthing that I started to specifically\nlike my own way was music\nI you know would listen to whatever's\npopular and I feel like now I really\nonly listen to the songs that I\ngenuinely enjoy listening to or I relate\nto and even if it's the most random\nplaylist ever where it's like rap sad\nmusic country music like all inone I\nenjoy listening to that and I don't have\nto listen to whatever everyone else is\nlistening to and I also can if I want to\nif I want to listen to whatever's the\ntop 100 I'm going to do that you know\neven in front of other people like I can\nplay what I like and I'll take\nsuggestions and not just what's your\nfavorite song well whatever want's the\ntop one right now like you know having\nthat to myself is also something really\nnice have you discovered any new artists\nor anyone recently that you're like\nsomeone that maybe we haven't heard of\nor someone that maybe is less heard of\nthat you're like well my favorite artist\nhis name is PIM Stones he doesn't make\nmusic anymore which is really really sad\nbut my favorite artist ever he's made\nlike some of the most incredible songs\nI've ever heard and they're just so\nbeautiful to listen to and one of them\nhas been my favorite song for a while\nactually someone at my dance studio when\nI was like probably 13 had a solo to it\nwow and ever since then I've been\nobsessed and he only has like two songs\nout on Spotify but I will listen to the\ntwo of them just on repeat forever and\never and ever cuz they're so good wow\nwow that's amazing yeah I love it I'll\ncheck it out only two songs on Spotify\nso him Stones all right I'm going to go\ncheck it out after this interview no I\nlove that and I think it's really\nrefreshing and it must feel so good I\ncan see in your face so you just seem so\nlike genuinely happy talking about the\nthings that spark joy that bring you\nthat sense of comfort and ease and make\nlife that much more what if someone\nright now is listening and they're like\nCharlie I'm struggling with what what\nyou just said like I find it hard to be\nopen and honest about the things I like\nbecause people make fun of me or\nridicule me or maybe people tell me\nthat's not cool or whatever it is like\nwhat has slowly given you the confidence\nto get there and what what do you think\npeople need to hear to almost feel\nconfident in themselves to say that I\nthink it just starts with giving\nyourself permission to be open with\nyourself because it really like as much\nas it sucks to hear like it is all in\nyour head you have to work on your selft\ntalk and I think positive selft talk is\nsomething that is so often overlooked\nbecause everyone's so overly critical of\nthemselves you see your face you know in\nthe reflection of your phone you're in\npictures background of photos you're\nlike oh I hate this one but this one\nposted it and I can't do anything about\nit you know you have to once you start\nspeaking in a more positive tone about\nyourself and the people around you the\neasier it is to feel more positive you\nknow instead of oh I hate the way I look\ntoday you know what my hair is doing\nsomething different and I kind of like\nit you know starting with those little\nlittle things that sound so so like it's\nso tiny who who even cares you know it's\nin my head it's not affecting anyone but\nit's affecting yourself so I think just\nthe more you can be positive and open\nwith yourself and not so overly critical\nof yourself\nif you like a movie and no one else\nlikes that movie doesn't mean it's a bad\nmovie and you can't like it you can\nstill enjoy watching it and okay we just\nhave different opinions that's normal\nand they probably like like stuff I\ndon't like but that doesn't take away\nfrom what they like it's just you know\nthe way you talk to yourself is so\nimportant yeah you're so right and it's\nit's so subtle like those thoughts as\nyou just said like I love that switch\nthat you just made between I don't like\nhow my hair looks today or oh my hair's\ndoing something different today and\nthat's interesting or it looks cool\nwhatever it may be there's an amazing\nbook uh for those who who are more\ninterested in what Charlie's talking\nabout right now it's called psycho\ncybernetics and it's this whole idea of\nhow our thoughts completely define our\nreality and how as you just said studies\nshow that we have 60 to 80,000 thoughts\nper day and 80% of them are negative and\nrepetitive so we're often having the\nsame thought which is like I don't like\nhow I look or I don't like how my hair\nlooks or I don't like this about me or\nwhatever it may be and you keep having\nthat thought oh yeah and then it just\nSpirals and then that's all you feel\nabout yourself and then it becomes your\nreality so that book really help me it's\nit's an old school classic in this space\nbut it convinces you that you can change\nyour thoughts and it's not like you're\nlying to yourself right like I I want to\naddress this for people who think that\npositive this is not about positive\nthinking this is not like looking at\nyourself and going I'm amazing and I'm\nspecial like that stuff doesn't work\neither but it's almost just tweaking\nyour thoughts slightly to being how do\nyou change from being critical to just\nbeing curious and that little switch can\nchange everything exactly and it's I\nthink it's so important because getting\nto the point where you have a more\npositive selft talk it's it's not linear\nyou know you're going to have dips and\nand bad days and good days and bad\nmonths and good months you just that's\nthat's how it works but I notice when I\nstart to see myself slip and realize\nI've been super critical of myself and\nyou know what I've had such a bad week\nthat's probably why I'm feeling so\ninsecure and maybe I'm taking it out on\nother people or I'm I don't want to\nleave my house because I've critiqued\neverything about the way I look and not\nfocus on one positive thing at all you\nknow it really that's when I noticed\nwhen I started to dip again how\nimportant it is to really focus on being\nkind to yourself yeah and I and I I I\nhope people really hear that because I\nthink the reason why we're hard on\nothers is because we're so hard on\nourselves and the reason we're so hard\non ourselves is because we're so hard on\nothers and it's almost like if we were\njust able to be kinder to the stranger\nour friend our family member then I\nthink we'd actually be able to be more\nkind to ourselves and vice versa as well\neven like in friendships and\nrelationship ship I think it's important\nI if you're telling jokes back and forth\nto each other and maybe they're like you\nknow how you joke with your friends\nlike sometimes it can be a little mean\nI've you know I've done the why don't we\ntry and just be really really nice to\neach other for a little bit let's really\nfocus on bringing each other up and I've\nactually had that conversation before\nand I think it's something that sounds\nalmost corny like let's be super nice to\neach other but it really is helpful to\nhave the people that you love and maybe\nyou say it when you're a little bit down\nso you know you're not asking for\ncompliments you're just asking for a\nmore positive environment around you and\nI think that there's something so\nspecial about that and the people around\nyou that love you will definitely be\nopen to it you know and I think that\nthere's also something in that the\npeople that you have around you every\nday you need\nto try and build up with you MH yeah and\nthat's I get I get that people will find\nthat hard because I'm also in England we\nbanter a lot and so I banter a lot with\nmy team with my wife like if if people\nsee me and my wife together they're like\nyou guys hate each other because we'd go\nso hard and even my friends I just came\nback from London for my sister's wedding\nand I was there with all my boys and I\nwas so we're so intense with each other\nand that's how close we are like the\nmore intense we can be but you're right\nthat sometimes and it's really\ninteresting because when you get into a\none-on-one with a friend they'll say how\nmuch they need the opposite like when\nyou're with a group of people you're all\nBing it's great but then when you're\none-on-one with someone you hear how\nsomeone's like you know I need a bit of\nencouragement or I need I need to know\nthat you think I'm doing good at this or\nwhatever it may be so and also like\ndon't be afraid to be the person that is\ngoing to text all the people around you\nevery time you see them do something I'm\nso proud of you like you looked amazing\nat this or this was so cool that you did\nthis like be that person be the annoying\nperson you know I wish I did it more and\nI should and that's something that I'll\ntaken to the rest of the day um but this\nmorning even I I had a conversation with\nmy mom and she's got back into modeling\nshe's in Louisiana right now so I\nhaven't seen her in a couple days and\nshe was sending me photos and I didn't\nanswer my phone for a little bit just\nbecause I've been jetlagged and crazy\nand I was like geez like if I sent her\nsomething I would want to hear back how\nproud she is of me so let me just go\nover the top because sometimes you need\nto be that person ESP especially if\nthat's the energy that you're trying to\nget back you can't get that without\ngiving it too yeah well said and how's\nthat been because obviously that's a big\npart of it right especially with the new\nnew docy series as well like the new\nseason like this idea of your whole\nfamily is now in the spotlight yeah and\nit's almost like people just lump\neveryone together especially when it's a\na big family and everyone's got exciting\nthings happening and you know I've\nobvious obviously interviewed your whole\nfamily before so I've I've sat with them\nand it's it's wonderful and at the same\ntime it's hard to find find your own\nspace and carve your own identity right\nlike that's challenging yeah I think\nthat the family Dynamic is something\nthat is really really\nconfusing especially for me I'm the\nyoungest so you spend all your time\ntrying to impress your older sister you\nspend all your time trying to prove\nsomething to your parents even when\nthey're already proud of you you know\nit's really confusing you don't know\nwhere you fit in I'm like I live with my\nsister I don't live with my parents but\nyou know I still want the same support\nthat I got when I lived with them but I\ncan't just go up to their room anytime\nI'm having a bad day they don't know\nwhat's going on with me all the time\nwhen we're working together and on a\nshoot you know I I hate to say this but\nsometimes they want more stuff of me or\nwhatever it is or we want this H for the\nfamily and then they'll you know expect\nextra from me and it's like well where\ndo I fit in because I'm the youngest but\nsometimes they want the most and well\nyou know it gets to the point where it's\nlike well they they they're not there\nfor me and it's like well you know what\neveryone's doing their own stuff like\neveryone has their own stuff going on\nDixie is music my mom's modeling my\ndad's doing business stuff\nlike there's so much going on for all of\nus at the same time it can get hard to\ncelebrate every single achievement when\nthere's just four of us all doing\ndifferent things all at the same time\nrunning from place to place traveling\nyou know we're still figuring that out\nnow I think while filming season 3 our\nentire family was going through a lot\nlike mentally and with work so it's hard\nto watch back those episodes\nbecause we were just all in such a\ndifferent place and so confused at where\nwe all stand and taking it out on each\nother which I think is probably the\nbiggest regret I have through all of\nthis with my family is like we need to\nhave each other's backs through\neverything cuz you know through it all\nyou work with people you make friends\nwhatever you have to have family or\npeople that you've kind of adopted as\nfamily that are there to support you\nwhen there's no cameras or when there's\nno likes or followers anything like you\nneed that and the hardest time for all\nof us was when we didn't have each other\nto lean on and that is really really\nshown in season 3 and like even when I\nsee Clips I'm like I don't want to see\nit at all like that was such a hard time\nfor all of us and it's so embarrassing\nat times to see that like people posting\nit reposting it edits of it edits of\ntimes where I was like really really\nreally struggling and hearing people\nshe's so dramatic but you hear a tenth\nof what was actually going on you know\nso it's it's a lot or things are you\nknow maybe I was upset about one thing\nbut in the show it looks like I'm upset\nabout something else it's like a whole\nbunch of stuff that's just I don't even\nwant to pay attention to it it must be\nso challenging like I've always I've\nalways thought about it like having a\nshow where every one of your feelings\nand emotions is being\ndocumented and then broadcast sounds\nlike the most challenging thing ever\nit's a lot yeah it's like even just that\nas a premise and I know it's been around\nforever and you know families have been\nfollowed forever and there's this format\nhas been around forever but I'm like it\ndoesn't get easier because of that\nbecause as humans we love to watch Drama\nWe love to watch the gossip we want to\nsee the scoop the show has like twists\nand changes and you know characters that\nare upset at each other and you have all\nof this going on but then behind all of\nthat there's a real human with real\nemotions trying to figure it all out\nhave you been able to separate like\nyourself and then the character on the\nshow too like do you feel or do you feel\nthat's just so in interrelated that\nyou're like in ways yes for sure\nbut like people don't realize when\nyou're filming sometimes you forget you\nhave a mic on and you say something and\nyou're like it really wasn't that deep\nlike yeah it's not that important\nsometimes you're really really upset or\nyou're maybe mentally struggling a\nlittle bit and you don't have a reason\nbecause sometimes you don't need a\nreason sometimes you just feel really\nbad and that happens so you go through\nthese well why are you well what was\nhappening you know was it this person's\nfault and it's like I don't know I was\njust really feeling bad and I didn't\nhave a handle on it and I had to film so\nyou know it's like I don't get a choice\nof\nhow\nI how I go into filming you know I can\ntry and go in with a positive mindset\nbut after a couple hours you know like\nI'm tired and you see how maybe I was\nreally feeling that day maybe it's\nnothing that was at all in the show like\npeople watching have no idea but it is\nso many real emotions that it's really\nreally hard to separate the two but\nhopefully you know if another season\nhappens I'll be able to do that and why\ndid you feel though in season 3 that it\ngot harder with family than easier like\nyou'd hope that season 3 like made it\neasier but why do you think it got\nharder is it just that everyone's more\nbusy now or yeah I think we were just\nall going through so much individually\nand constantly taking it out on each\nother and you know that's building\nblocks to working with your family no\nfamily that works together is perfect\nall the time and if you say you are you\nare so wrong especially when you know we\ntalk about it all the time like family\nis everything thing but when you're in\nthose moments where you're like I'm\npissed at this person in my family\nbecause of maybe it's something stupid\nbut to me it's like it feels like a lot\nfeels like the entire world on my\nshoulders for maybe something that isn't\nthat big of a deal but it feels like\nthat to me you know it's\njust we were all going through so much\nat the same time that there was no way\nthat these cameras weren't going to\ncatch it m\nit sounds like even even though\nobviously you said that you know when\nyou're a kid you still want your family\nto take care of you and obviously now\nyou're in a position where obviously you\ntake care of yourself you you live with\nyour sister but what would you say has\nbeen the biggest skills you've learned\nin how to take care of yourself when you\ndon't have your family to rely on I\ndon't even know I feel like that's\nsomething that is so confusing to me\nstill I feel so dependent because you\nknow I'm traveling without any of my\nfriends or family I'm on these big work\ncalls like I have no training for this I\nI didn't even finish High School like I\ndon't know how to do this I don't know\nif I'm making the right decision I don't\nknow if this is you know good or bad I\nstill call my dad all the time and I'm\nlike okay but seriously what do you\nthink about this because I like this\nsounds not that cool to me but\napparently it's really like I have no\nidea how this works and you know the\nmore I do it the more I get comfortable\nand learn but I missed so much of the\nnormal growing up going to college and\nthen coming back for Thanksgiving or\nChristmas or whatever it is that I kind\nof had to like race to figure it out\nbecause it was one day you're a kid and\nyou're in high school and you have no\nresponsibilities and now you have people\npeople that are working for you and and\nyou're responsible for them and you're\nresponsible for everything that you do\nand you're not allowed to mess up but\nI'm 16 I don't know how to not mess up I\ndon't know anything like how am I\nsupposed to learn that without having\nthese real life experiences so I think\nthe more as time goes on and the more\nI'm put in these situations where I have\nto be independent and a grownup you know\nthe easier it gets but it's still\nsomething that I really have to figure\nout in each individual situation yeah\nI'm 36 and I still don't know how not to\nmess up like it's just because I think\nwhat we don't realizes you've got\nyourself and your identity like you as\nan individual which is always changing\nso whether you're 36 or whether you're\n19 you're still dealing with that on top\nof that you've now got the industry is\nalways changing so like the platforms\nare changing and the business is\nchanging and the social whatever all of\nthat's always changing so you've never\ndone it before and most people have\nnever done it before so no matter how\nsmart someone was five months ago\nEverything's changed and so everything's\nbeing updated and then on top of all of\nthat you've got everyone around you\nwho's constantly changing and growing\nand evolving and so it's so hard to ever\nfeel you ever have a handle on on all\nareas of your life yeah and so\ndefinitely as a 16-year-old now a\n19-year-old like it's it's so much to\nlearn quickly and I think you had your\nyou recently had your prom or you did\nyour prom here right like you yeah I had\nI had two we did one on the show and\nthen I went to my high school prom back\nin my hometown yeah which was really fun\nand like the bit of senior year that I\ngot to have which was really nice\nbecause I didn't get that at all and a\nlot of kids didn't during Co and\neverything so I'm definitely not the\nonly person feeling like this a lot of\nfreshman sophomore year college like\npeople didn't get that people didn't get\nthat very very intrical part of growing\nup or whether it's your first job like\nthis was my first job I had never had\nany true responsibility before and I\ndon't know how and there's no rule book\nto say well this is how you be an adult\nso it's kind of\njust figuring it out and messing up\nalong the way but when you mess up and\nyou have so many people telling you how\nyou messed up and how that's horrible\nand you're doing all of these things\nwrong you're like yeah I know but this\nis all I know how to\nyou kind of\njust every day learn a little bit and\njust continue to do your best cuz that's\nall you can do yeah yeah and do you know\nwhat it's interesting because we're\nhearing that from you and I think\neveryone who's listening right now is\ngoing that's me too like you know I\nthink it doesn't matter how old you are\nor how wise you are or how smart or\nwhether you have your own business or\nyou don't or we're just all feeling that\nway because everyone is just tring\ntrying to do their best and sometimes\ntheir best is not good enough for\neveryone else but that's all they could\ngive and I feel that for anyone and\neveryone today and so I think what\nyou're saying resonates or feels very\nrelatable at least even to me and I'm\nsure everyone who's listening is\nthinking that as well like I'm just\ntrying yeah and that's like the normal\nhuman experience and I definitely get on\nmyself about it\nbut everyone's just doing their best\nlike my parents are still figuring out\nwho they are are you know it's ever\nchanging like my grandmother before she\npassed started to get a a handle on all\nof the Social Media stuff and like how\nto watch me she would watch YouTube\nvideos or like see see things online\narticles and she would be like I heard\nyou did this and I'm like well that's\nnot true that's just like an article you\nknow and she's like no no no but I saw\nit in the press and I was like yeah I\nknow but it's not it's not true so we\nlike had to get a handle on that but she\nwas changing and she was evolving with\nthe times and she didn't know how it\nworked and she was you know she was she\nwas a lot older and and still figuring\nout who she is and well how do I do this\nand and I want to watch you but I have\nto discover this whole new thing like\neveryone is learning something and she\nwas just doing her best to watch her\ngrandchildren on social media like it's\nsomething that is so cute and something\nthat seems so simple to me like we'll\njust download Tik to talk and watch my\nvideos you know but to her it was like\nthis whole new thing that she has to\nlearn and I think once you realize that\nliterally everyone is just trying to do\ntheir best to get to the next day like\nyou can be a lot easier on yourself but\nalso a lot easier on everyone around\nyouh and also even just what you said\nabout your grandmother like learning\nabout how she's reading something that\nsounds so true and you're like no it\ndidn't happen that way and it's funny\ncuz I go through similar things with me\nand my family so my parents will read an\narticle about me or whatever and they'll\nget really upset for me or they'll get\noffended for me because there's\nsomething in it that they don't like or\nwhatever it is or there's something said\nabout the family which you must have to\ndeal with way more than I do because\nyour family's in the spotlight too but\nthen they're like oh well why did they\nsay that about the family and this and\nthat and I'm like I didn't say anything\nlike you know it's almost like I didn't\neven talk about that I didn't mention\nanything it's just someone coming up\nwith something yeah and I imagine for\nyou like it's like the clickbait\nArticles I'm like I'm telling you that\nthis isn't real or she'd like see\nsomeone online she's like I don't like\nthem why they said something about you\nthree years ago well they're my friends\nnow she's like I don't know I don't like\nhim it's like all\nright you're going to think whatever you\nthink like that's fine she was so cute\nand so so supportive like she spent all\nday on her iPad just watching YouTube\ncompilations of my Tik toks and every\ntime I see her she she' be like you need\nto stop cursing on the internet and I\nwas like I know I\nknow that's so sweet that's so funny\nyeah I mean and and you nice of you not\nto block her from those videos either oh\nyeah even I know so many people that do\nthat my other grandma she like still\nswipes up on all my stories she's like\nyou look great or she'd like reply to\nfan pages like a lot of people's\ngrandparents I hear this all the time\nfrom all the social media kids it's like\nmy grandma responds to my fan pages\nthinking they're me and I'm like but\nit's so like it's so sweet and I love it\nand I mean my grandma that's my grandma\nmy dad's side like she like she still\ntexts me all the time like you look so\ngood in this or this is so cool or\nanytime I do anything where it's like\nsomething that she would like I'll like\nsend her a photo and you know she's just\nproud you know that's also a good person\nto talk to that's just like always going\nto be proud of me just really nice to\nhave yeah definitely and to allow that\nin do you find that you found like I\nknow you're close with marel who I love\ntoo he's such a I I love marquel's\nenergy I've only met him a couple of\ntimes but he's so awesome have you found\nthat you've got a good group of friends\naround you in the industry because what\nI found is that so I have a bunch of\ngreat friends back in London who are\nlike my best friends like my best man at\nmy wedding and like my closest friends\nthat I grew up with and I speak to them\nlike I speak to my best friend like\nthree times a week still because it's so\nimportant to me and I need it and at the\nsame time I also need friends who are in\nthe industry because there are certain\nthings that we can all understand about\nthe industry kind of like the idea of\nyeah don't trust the Press on that and\nwhatever because they already know that\nbecause they go through the same stuff\ndo you find I it sounds like you have a\ngreat group of friends back at home do\nyou find that you've also found good\nfriends in the industry that you can\nkind of compare notes with a bit too and\nbe like oh I just went through that this\nis how I'm feeling yeah yeah definitely\nI mean marquel's like he's family to me\nhe has\nshown so much to me just as a person\nwhether it's talking to me oneon-one or\ndefending me online or you know\ndefending me to the people around him\nlike he is someone that every person\nthat meets him has so much amazing\nthings to say about him and I'm so\nthankful that I have him in my life\nwhether it's like we're doing nothing or\nwe're out with a bunch of people and I\nwe want to have a dance party in the\nmiddle of the dance floor and it's just\nus to like we'll do it or in the middle\nof a restaurant whatever it is like I\nlove that but I've definitely found a\nlot of people that are in the industry\nand a lot of the friendships that I have\nI tend to keep quiet about and a lot of\nthe friendships that I have I've met\nthem in very very weird ways cuz how am\nI supposed to meet people you know I\ndon't go out super often I don't I am\nnot usually around people my own age\nlike a lot of my friends that I met they\nwere actually dancers at the Kids Choice\nAwards and we just clicked and I started\nhang out with them and I really like\nthem and they're really cool people and\nthey're in an industry that I'm so\nfascinated by and yeah they do so much\nsimilar things to me but it's also\ndifferent and I think that that's really\nspecial and after meeting them it\nwas really refreshing to be around\npeople my own age and also just have\npeople that are hardworking and\ndetermined and not competitive with me\nat all and just happy to see me happy\nand I can have fun with whether we're\nfilming or not you know but even like my\nboyfriend he's in the industry and you\nknow we we tend to handle things a\nlittle bit differently but sometimes I I\nhave to be like it's not not worth it\nyou know we don't have to respond we\ndon't have to do anything like it's not\nworth it I know you you know me whether\npeople are saying things about me or\npeople are saying things about our\nrelationship you know having each other\nto kind of navigate\nthat on our own is is really nice\nbecause it's\nalso what two 19-year-olds in a\nrelationship have their lives together\nyou know there's ups and downs like\nwhether I'm working all the time or he's\nworking all the time or I'm traveling or\nwhatever it is like there's always so\nmuch going on that can so easily put a\nstrain on a relationship and also just\ncoming into adulthood with two teenagers\nthat have no idea what they're doing and\njust trying their best like you know\nit's been really confusing to navigate\nbut also really refreshing to have\nsomeone else there that's\nlike just trying to figure it out day by\nday mhm it's almost yeah it's almost\neasier in one sense because you have\nsomeone to bounce it off of as opposed\nto you're like am I crazy are you crazy\nis this like is this okay you know so\nit's it's really nice do you do you\nthink the hardest part about success and\nfame is having a relationship in the\npublic eye would you say that that's the\nhardest part in terms of when it comes\nto your relationships or that's not\nsometimes I feel\nlike you know when two people that are\nin a Rel relationship have like an off\nweek or whatever there can be the whole\nthis person didn't like their photo or\nthey haven't posted together they're\nbroken up or this person's starting a\nrumor like even if you you two are\nstruggling that's for you to go through\nand handle it however is appropriate\nwhether you guys part ways or continue\nto work through things together like no\nrelationship is perfect ever you have\nmoments where so much is going on like\nduring Dancing with the Stars I was\ndancing seven days a week I was never\nhome he was like I felt like I didn't\nhave a girlfriend and that was really\nhard it was hard on my parents you know\nlike it's a lot and especially for two\nyoung teenagers to go through like we\ndon't we don't know how to do this no\none knows how to do this so we're just\ndoing our best and there's ups and downs\nbut we work through it and that's just\nbeing a person\nyou know yeah yeah yeah know absolutely\nand and and just the idea\nof it is interesting when you've got two\npeople who have crazy lives and and have\ndifferent Journeys and have different\nyou know commitments and family\ncommitments and there's just so much\ngoing on yeah to keep up with it all\nwhat have you found what has helped you\nboth kind of keep up with each other's\nschedules and each other's lives because\nthat's not going to change at least not\nright now and so how what what has\nhelped what has worked I think think you\nknow we've obviously talked about this\nso much just as a whole I was I was just\ngone for almost two weeks and we were on\ndifferent time zones just trying to text\nand update each other but it it's\nfiguring out what each other needs you\nknow if he wants me to keep him updated\nthen I'll keep him updated because\nthat's what he needs if he if I need him\nto tell me what's going on in his week\nso I don't feel left out like that's\ntotally cool that's what I need it's\njust having that conversation and\nrealizing that people's needs change and\nadapting with that and not feeling like\nwell I don't want to make him upset like\nhe's working a lot and I know he's super\nbusy like I need a shoulder to lean on\nit's also having the conversation like\nsometimes I'll literally say I'm really\nreally sensitive right now like I just\nneed some extra support and then he\nknows to well she needs this right now\nokay like that's totally cool that's two\npeople in a relationship doing whatever\nthey can to make the other person happy\njust normal human things and definitely\nnot worrying about what anyone online\nhas to say it's so not worth it it\nreally isn't cuz 99% of these people are\nlooking for you to respond like even\ntoday I woke up to\nsome crazy person talking about me and\nlike the most wildly disrespectful ways\nlike I've really seen a long time and\nthe thing is like me and this person\nwere at an event together and this\nperson introduced themselves I\nintroduced we tried to be nice this kid\nwas not nice to me and then went and\ntalked very poorly on me and Landon's\nlike well let me call this kid and I'm\nlike it's not that big of a deal like\nit's not that's what he's looking for is\nit taking everything in me not to\nrespond or not to text him yeah but I\nknow if I text him he's going to post it\nand that's going to be a thing and he's\ngoing to get exactly what he wants me to\nrespond and give in to whatever story he\nwants to portray to the people that\nwatch him it's not it's not my problem\nlike I know who I am and that's good\nenough for me like it doesn't matter\nyeah and it's so hard to get to that\npoint but it's so liberating when you do\nlike it's so freeing when you realize\nthat where you're like actually not\nresponding is not getting caught up in\nsomeone else's thing yeah and like then\nit just gives people an opportunity to\nwell if I say this about her then she's\ngoing to respond and it's like I don't\nhave time to respond to every little\nthing that people have to say about me\nand it it takes so\nmuch it's so draining to to have to see\nthat and the more you talk about it the\nmore your fans talk about it and people\nin the Press talk about it and it's like\nfor what reason because I was angry at\nthis kid who I met once like who cares\nyeah yeah and and it's hard when the\nperson you're in a relationship with\nwants to defend you too and like and\nhe's so sweet he is so quick to defend\nme in every way possible and I just have\nto be like it's cool like it's good I\nfeel like I tell him that all the time\ncuz he gets so upset whenever people\nhave something negative to say about me\nor his family and I mean I\nthink I definitely told him like many\nmany times it's cool like it's it's\ntotally fine they're going to say it no\nmatter what and even if you respond and\nare like well this isn't true because\nthis is this they're not they're they\nalready read it and they think what they\nthink about you they're not going to\nchange their minds you know yeah you're\narguing with people that don't care what\nyou have to say yeah it's already lost\nlike yeah it's it's a lose lose\nsituation so moving on is the best thing\nyou can do yeah no and and it's\nwonderful to be with someone and have\nthat with someone who you know cares\nabout you that deeply like my wife's\nlike that like my wife gets very\ndefensive about me and like can get\nreally activated and she gets really\nupset for me and whatever it may be and\nI I really always appreciate that\nbecause I can see that she knows who I\nam and that's kind of what it goes back\nto where I always said the same thing to\nher I'm like I'm just glad I have\nsomeone who knows who I am especially\nlike when someone cares about you like\nthat to see you upset because of\nsomething and not being able to fix the\nproblem because they just want to see\nyou happy like I understand how upset\nthat might make you you know and I I\nfeel bad because sometimes I feel like I\ndrag him into the drama just because of\nthe relationship but I think knowing\nthat you know we have each other and I\ncan tell him like this was this actually\nreally hurt my feelings today and and it\nwas it was a lot and I just need some\ncomfort and I need you to be by my side\nand that's good enough for me you know\nyeah definitely definitely Charlie what\nare you excited about right now like\nwhat's kind of like you know you've done\nso many amazing things and I feel like\nthis journey that you're saying with\nyour identity of like getting to know\nyourself better yeah you've done so many\nthings and I'm guessing some of them\nyou're like oh yeah that was Charlie\ndemilio and then this is Charlie it's\nlike what is Charlie like really excited\nabout or curious about or passionate\nabout or like what's coming up where\nyou're like I really want to try that\nout or learn that or whatever whatever\nit may be like open floor\num okay I think first thing that I'm\nmost excited about is my dogs I have a\npuppy um I know I sound so lame I have\npu I'm not laughing because I think it's\nlame I'm laughing cuz it's cute it's\njust like yeah you're going to have to\nopen up a dog shelter or something I\nknow I'm like in love with her uh I have\nmy like older dog who's nine she's\nliterally me as a dog and I'm I'm\nobsessed with her she's the most\nadorable dog ever she's literal human\nbut then I have this puppy that L and I\nadopted\nfrom Nashville and she's like she was\nabandoned and she was like it was a\nhorrible story and it really like pulled\nup my heartstrings and I was like okay I\nneed to take you home now like I will\ntake care of you I love you and like\nwatching her grow up and being\nresponsible for her I think has been\nvery refreshing to me because my older\ndog she's you know she's very\nself-sufficient she's also very lazy so\nI'll be up in the morning and she'll\nwake up 2 hours later ready to be fed\nlike she is not she has her own schedule\nand I love that about her because that's\nhow I raise her she's a very like\nlaid-back dog can have all the lights on\nand she's sleeping like I love that but\nthis puppy you know you have to train\nher you have to it's very specific and\nthese formative puppy years are so\nimportant to who this dog becomes\nthere's no bad dogs there's only bad dog\nowners so I just like am loving this\njourney of truly cuz you know I got my\ndog nine years ago I was 10 I wasn't\nactually raising her and now I'm getting\nthe chance to raise a dog and it's\nreally really exciting and special and\nseeing the two of them together is like\nmy favorite thing ever I think something\nelse that I'm excited for is I have a\ndance room in my garage so I love just\ngoing down there any time of the day\nwhether it's 4 in the morning or 1: p.m.\nand just like letting go and being open\nwith myself and using movement as\ntherapy and also getting a little bit of\na workout in you know like being\nproductive I love that\nand\nprobably experimenting more with my\nstyle that's something that I've just\nrecently started to get into I think\nLandon and my sister had a lot to do\nwith that because I I love the way that\nthey put together outfits I think that\nthey both have really good Styles and it\ncomes very natural to them and to me\nit's a lot harder because I always go\nfor what I know instead of stepping out\nof the box but I'm trying so that's\nsomething exciting and it's fun to\nexperiment you know yeah I love how FAL\nall those were those were great they\nwere great choices thank you yeah I love\nhow none of them were career career\nrelated and like none of them were work\nrelated and that's awesome because I can\ntell that you've you've really started\ncarving those two things as separate\nyeah um work-wise you know using my\nvoice more online I think that you know\neven doing a podcast is something very\noutside of my comfort zone a lot of my\ncareer has been not talking so it's been\nvery hard for me to get into using my\nvoice and figuring out what do I want to\nsay especially when you don't know\nyourself how do you answer questions I\ndon't you can't just say I don't know\nfor everything so that's something\nthat's been special and I've been trying\nto make more content for my fans and\ntrying to use my voice more and like\neven little things finishing a get ready\nwith me which I film 50 of them and I\npost one of them like trying to get more\ninto it and go back to the reason why I\nstarted social media because I like it\nand I'm finally at a point where I like\nit again which is really refreshing and\nnice it doesn't feel like\nwork I love that and what what's been\nwhat is that when you say you want to\nuse your voice and even doing the\npodcast today like you coming on today\nand you know being open and and trusting\nme and trusting this space and just\nbeing vulnerable with the idea of like\nyou said I don't know I'm trying to\nfigure out who I am yeah and and being\nokay with that which I think by the way\nfor a 19y old is is completely normal\nand wonderful and good and like I think\nthat's amazing that you want to\nspend this time in your life figuring\nout who you are I think it's the best\ninvestment you could ever make I'm so\nhappy that you're doing it I'm hoping\nthat you take your whole audience and\ncommunity on a journey to do it for\nthemselves because you're going to save\nso many people from so many stressful 20\nto 30 year old Journeys right right like\nliterally like you can either do it now\nor you can do it when you're 30 and if\nyou do it now it's like you're going to\nhelp so many people what is is that kind\nof like when you say using your voice is\nthat the type of Journey you want people\nto go on with you or are you are you\nstill figuring out what that Journey it\nis that you want people to go on with\nyou yeah as of right now it's literally\njust talking talking online just\nactually using my voice you know for so\nlong it was a song\nand no words like it sounds so little\nbut just talking I feel like that's\nsomething that is which is so weird but\nit's so outside of my comfort zone and I\nfeel\nso like weird doing it but has honestly\nbeen really refreshing for me because\nyou know I'm growing up and a part of\ngrowing up is being confident with what\nyou have to say and using using your\nwords and just talking with you know a\nlittle bit of purpose and I'm growing up\nbut also so are all of the people that\nare watching me and I think bringing\nthem on that journey of this is\nliterally just what I'm doing I'm not\ntalking about anything that's really of\nany importance sometimes sometimes I'm\njust talking but that's what I need to\ndo to move to this next step of my life\nto hopefully talk about something\nimportant and talk about what matters to\nme I think that that's this is a very\nintrical step of growing up I think\nthat's really smart I genuinely do I\nthink that takes a lot of courage to\neven say that I don't think it's I don't\nthink it's like insignificant at all I\nthink it it makes a lot of sense to me\nthat in order for you to stand for\nsomething you need to get to a point\nwhere you just feel comfortable being\nopen and sharing yeah and so much of the\nbeginning few years of this journey\nevery time I talk\nsomeone had something to say and you\nknow you get cancelled every 5 Seconds\nlike that was what was happening to me\nfor so long anytime I opened my mouth so\nI just stopped talking I stopped saying\nanything that was important to me I\nstopped doing anything that was outside\nof the box that I was put in where I\ncouldn't go wrong if I just didn't do\nanything you know and I have opinions I\nhave thoughts I have things I like I\nhave things I don't like why can't I\njust say it like who is stopping me the\npeople that actually care what I have to\nsay they're going to support me even if\nthey disagree you know whether it's I\nreally like this outfit and they don't\nlike that's cool they respect my opinion\nI respect theirs that's awesome the\npeople that don't like me they're not\ngoing to like me no matter what they\ndidn't like me when I wasn't saying\nanything they're not going to like me\nnow that's fine I'm I'm not making my\nvideos for them mhm yeah definitely when\nwhen you say you still want to get to\nknow who you are and your identity what\nare the parts that you're like I'm still\njust trying to figure this out or this\npart I'm like really curious about I'm\ntrying to learn about this about myself\nbut I don't know what like what are\nthose parts of yourself yeah I think a\nlot of it has to do with the way that I\npresent myself whether it's how do I\nlike my makeup done how do I like to\ndress how do I like to look how do I\nlike to show myself to other people not\njust what\nis going on at the moment how do I like\nto smell you know I like born dreamer I\nknow I like that and let's discover for\nfuture with born dreamer what else do I\nlike you know whatever I know I like go\na little bit deeper and you know\nsomething's so simple I've been doing\nmore colors with my nails which is so\nrandom and so small it's your nails you\nknow people get their nails done all the\ntime but I did bright green and I\nthought about that for 3 weeks before I\ndid it and like why I enjoyed it I liked\nthe color I wanted it on my nails it\nmade me happy every time I saw them I\nwas like I did that that was something\ndifferent I normally do nude let's do\nsomething fun like that little thing was\nso much fun for me and it brought me so\nmuch happiness and I would match this\ncolor to this and it's just so fun why\nam I robbing myself of fun because I\ndon't want to put myself out there yeah\ngood for you honestly like you're\nliterally doing all the Practical steps\nthat it takes to build your values like\nand that's what it is all of these\nlittle habits for anyone who's listening\nall these little habits and these little\nchanges that you're making they turn\ninto values that you appreciate about\nyourself so a value could be and I'm not\nputting a value on you I'm just throwing\nit out there as for a reflection but a\nvalue could be I like Freedom or I like\nself-expression or I like uh random can\nbe a value or whatever it may be and\nlike and then those values become some\nthings you can use in the future for how\nyou make decisions now when you make so\none of my values has always been to take\nrisks I feel like I took risks ever\nsince I was 14 18 21 and I've noticed\nthat pattern in my life and so now when\nI'm taking a risk I'm not that scared\nanymore because I've always taken risks\nmy whole life and I love\nhow when I first took a risk I didn't\neven know what a risk was like when I\nwas 14 years old or 18 I just did it and\nnow when I look back I'm like oh no\nthat's a skill I have now and so it's\nalmost like when you're doing all these\nthings you're just collecting lots of\ndifferent like skills and then one day\nthey'll evolve into values which will\nform an identity and then you'll be able\nto be like these are the three things\nthat I value and that really matter to\nme and you know I love that you I love\nhow simple you've made it for yourself\nand I love how you've broken it down\nbecause I think a lot of us Tred to like\nLeap Frog like this is who I am now and\nwe almost want the the performance part\nbefore the work part and it's like I\nfeel like you're doing the work part\nyeah and it's it's great to watch it's\nreally great to see thank you Charlie\nwhat have I not asked you about that\nyou're like I really want to share this\nor this been on my heart on my mind or\nlike something you want to talk about\nthat you're like this is what I want to\nuse my voice for and that you haven't\nasked me about it or it just didn't come\nup something for me that I think is\nvery interesting which is very random\nand has nothing to do with my career my\npersonal life or anything I love the San\nDiego Safari Park which is so Random but\nI've recently found I watched this like\nwhole video on it this like very\nspecific thing that you have to go\nthrough a lot of steps to be able to get\nit for like a zoo or aquarium or\nanything but it's a certificate that\nshows if it's Humane to the animals and\nlearning about that has been really\ninteresting because I love going there\nand I love how free the animals are and\nhow it's just like they are in the wild\nand how they help the animals and that's\ndefinitely something that I want to get\nmore into is like figuring out exact\nwhat it is and going to more places like\nthat and you know not appreciating\nplaces like SeaWorld that treat their\nanimals horribly you know like little\nthings like that that I think is so\ninteresting because I love animals so\nthat was something I I need to find the\nname of exactly what that little like\nthing is but it's really cool and like\nto get that you have to go through a lot\nof work and every place is constantly\ntrying to outdo each other so the bar is\nconstantly being raised which I think is\nso interesting the quality of how they\ntreat the animals there and they have to\npass a certain number right right right\nwow yeah so that's really cool and\nsomething random that I discovered I\nlove that yeah my my wife's a big fan of\nuh visiting animals as much as we can\nand so she's she's kind of always LED\nthere and we've gone to some of the\nrandomest places in in LA because of her\nbut her relationship with animals is\nreally beautiful and she can like you\nknow start a relationship with I love\nyou know yeah and it's really special to\nwatch and it's really interesting\nbecause we went to a couple last year\nand she'd always come back really like\neven more calm and even more just still\nand and I and it was really beautiful to\nsee just how when you're connected to\nNature and we are nature and you know\nwe're a part of that but now we feel so\ndisconnected from it but animals are\nsuch a great way of reconnecting what\nwhat do you find I guess fulfilling or\nmeaningful about being obviously your\ndogs but with these animals like what is\nit about it for you specifically that\nyou appreciate about it I think it's\njust\nso peaceful and to learn so much like\nwhen you go to these places I will come\nback only talking about animal facts for\nlike a month and I love it and sometimes\npeople are like that's like where did\nyou even come up with that but I think\nit's so cool and so interesting to see\nall these animals\nin with each other and and how they\nrespond to things and I love places\nwhere it's like if they're out and you\nsee them that's great if not they don't\nfeel like being out that's just how it\nis is I just think it's so interesting\nand I literally I've been to the San\nDiego Safari twice and the first time\ntalked about animal facts for like two\nmonths the second time I leading up to\ngoing that was all I could talk about\nand I brought I got so many other people\nexcited about it because like but you\ndon't understand how cool it is like you\nare 20t away from a cheetah with like\nthere's no big fence up you know like\nit's crazy just to see these animals\njust living not worried about anything\nthat is so materialistic or anything\nlike that like I don't know I just find\nso much joy in it yeah yeah definitely\nhave you been to anywhere in Africa\nbefore I haven't and I really want to go\nI've like I've seen so many videos and\nso many of my friends have gone and it\njust seems so cool yeah I I I've talked\nabout this before on the podcast but I'm\nsharing it because it's natural in our\nconversation I went to Rwanda last year\nand Rwanda R gorillas so literally every\ntime there's a new gorilla in Rwanda the\ncommunity comes together and they name\nit and they have this whole ceremony for\nit and so they've had these uh gorilla\nsanctuaries for years and so same as\nwhat you're saying there's no fences or\nwalls or whatever it's basically the\nmountains and you take TRS into the\nmountains and you discover gorilla in\ntheir natural habitat and there's\nfamilies so we followed we I went three\ndays and one of the days we discovered a\nfamily that had like 20 gorilla is in it\nthen we discovered another one and you\nget to see the babies and the adults and\nit was easily one of my favorite things\nI've done in my entire life and it was\njust the most magical experience because\nyou're truly in nature the animals are\nin their habitat so you're going into\ntheir home yeah and they're going to Res\nthey're so respectful and let you do\nyour thing and at the same time you get\nto learn about them in this really\nintimate way it was beautiful to just\nsee how they took care of the kids how\nthe kids played around how they were\ndefensive if we got too close like just\neverything about them and the guides\nthat we had said that you can also go\nand walk so this was walking with\ngorillas but they said you could go walk\nwith elephants too that's cool and me\nand my wife have been talking about\ndoing that we're like I'd love to go\nwalk with elephants like how cool would\nthat be and so there's all these\nincredible experiences out there and you\nknow whether it's a local Safari or or\nwhether it's being able to go there and\nhave this experience I I definitely feel\nand my other team someone on my team's\nbeen talking about going to see The\nGreat Migration which is what so the\neasy version of it I'm giving a very bad\nexplanation but just to make it\nrelatable for everyone it's basically\nwhat happens in The Lion King when all\nthe wilder beast are like running across\nlike so that's the Great Migration where\nthey're like stampeding across the\nStampede where maasa unfortunately dies\nlike that moment is what the Great\nMigration is and it happens every single\nyear that's so cool so yeah anyway I'm\nI'm getting carried away to but no I\nmean it's so easy to yeah it really is\nyeah and it's magical to think that\nthese things exist and you can go and\nwitness them or even watch them online\nor a documentary whatever you well at\nthe San Diego Safari they're literally\nlike with the southern white rhinos and\nthe northern white rhinos it's like one\none of them is going extinct and they're\nliterally figuring out through stem\ncells like how to bring it it back it's\nso so wild and so interesting and\nhearing these people talk about it and\nand all of the steps they're going\nthrough with scientists and zoologists\nand literally everyone to\nhelp you know bring back this species of\nR rhinos it's like this is so cool and\nhas nothing to do with anything that I\ndo in my normal everyday life but how\ninteresting is that to just hear and and\nsee and like what that's crazy but I\ndon't know I just think that that's so\ncool I love it I love it and I hope you\njust keep pursuing and following all of\nthese things that you think are cool and\nyou know you're it's not that you don't\nknow yourself I wouldn't say that you\ndon't know who you are I just say that\nyou're you're firmly on that path yeah\nlike you're on that path of\nself-discovery and you're doing it at a\nperfect time in your life and you're\ntaking every one of the right steps like\nyou know it's not that you don't know\nwho you are or you're confused you just\nyou just taking those steps and and all\nof it's going to become more and more\nclear as you continue to take more steps\nSo yeah thank you for sharing the this\npart of the journey with me because I'm\nhoping that in a few years time you'll\ncome back and then you'll be like Jay I\nfigured this out these are all of my\nfavorite things that I've decided yeah\nyeah and I and I hope and I hope they'll\nchange again and you know I but I I'm\nglad that you came and shared this part\nbecause this is the hardest part to\nshare when you're not sure and you're\nfiguring it out and I'm glad that we had\nthe opportunity to capture that today\nyeah and I'm really really appreciate\nyou sharing that with people because it\nis the hardest part to share when you're\nlike I don't know I'm not quite there\nbut this is where I am now yeah perfect\nCharlie thank you so much no thank for\ncoming on the show today and we end\nevery episode with a final five and\nthese I'm going to totally ruin these\nbecause I enjoy doing that but you meant\nto answer them in one word to one\nsentence maximum but I will probably ask\nyou to expand because they always lead\nto more thoughtful answers so all right\nCharlie these are your final five the\nfirst question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever heard or received or\neven given to someone this is probably\nthe only thing that keeps me Saye\nwhether it's good or bad everything\nhappens for a reason you can't control\nit and that's something you hold on to\nit sounds makes me feel like I'm not\ngoing crazy when have you used that the\nmost you can expand beond one sentence I\nmean when I feel like I have no idea\nwhat to do next or I feel like\neverything's coming crashing down this\nis important because it's helping me get\nto the next step of my life and as much\nas this sucks right now now I need it\nand some of the worst Parts where I I\nfeel like I'm at an all-time low that\nhelped me get to that next step so next\ntime I'm I'm feeling like that I know\nhow to I know first I can get myself out\nof it and second that you know maybe\nit's not that big of a deal and in a\nyear I'm not even going to remember it\nabsolutely love that all right second\nquestion what's the worst advice you've\never heard or\nreceived probably that I need to\nsay yes to everything because you don't\nknow when this is going to\nend sometimes you just need to say no\nand take that time for yourself I'm so\nglad you brought that up so many young\ncreators here that just overwhelm\nthemselves and it's you're doing a\ndisservice to yourself give yourself\ntime to figure out who you\nare and I think you're so right like\nI've I've said this to a lot of people\ntoo\nthat it will only end when you want it\nto like nothing can end if you're if\nyou're alive and you're creating and\nyou're building like things just don't\nend and I think we use the end as a\nscarcity tactic or a fear tactic to get\nmore out of someone or to get the most\nout of it right now not realizing that\nsomeone could take a break for three\nyears if that's what they wanted to do\nand come back even stronger and bigger\nand better and whatever and I just don't\nthink we allow people to have that space\nand I think it's really unhealthy for\nanyone to think that oh if I'm not don't\ndo this I'm going to be irrelevant or\nwhatever it's like actually if you're an\nartist you could take time out and come\nback in years from now and create a\nmasterpiece yeah I mean the first like\nthree years of my career all anyone was\nsaying was it could be over like that no\none's going to care about you and I\nspent so much time when is it going to\nend everyone keeps telling me it's going\nto end like do I want it to end maybe I\nwant it to end maybe I want to break and\nit just to all be over and go back to my\nnormal noral life I've taken breaks I've\ntaken step backs I've done everything\nthat was coming to me at the moment and\nit's like letting whether the people\nthat are watching you are going to stay\nor leave dictate every move you make\nthose people that really care about you\nthey're not just going to leave if you\nstop posting for a month or a week or\nhowever long like put your\nown mental state first yeah yeah because\nif you don't put your mental state first\nthen it's definitely going to go away\nyeah you're going to get burnt out and\nthen no one's going to care cuz you\ndon't care exactly or you're not going\nto be able to put anything out like you\nknow and if you look at that perspective\nit's like yeah you just keep pushing and\npushing and pushing you lose yourself\nand then you have nothing to share and\nthen you've definitely you know lost out\nno really really great answer I love\nthat uh question number three what is\nthe craziest rumors you've heard about\nyourself one that made you laugh and one\nthat made you cry ones that make me me\nlaugh are\nprobably the ones where I'll like I'll\nseem\nsuper I'll see like blind items about\nmyself and it's like she did this crazy\nthing at this party and it was wild and\nand I was like didn't even go to a party\nthat's so like like where did you guys\ncome up with this I wasn't even there um\nso those ones always make me laugh and\nthey're like so not true\nI to be like okay crazy yeah I it's\nfunny you say about not being at the\nparty like so I I officiated uh Ben and\nJen's wedding last year and there was a\nguest list that was printed and the\nguest list just had everyone's name on\nit and everyone was like asking me like\noh did you see this person did you see\nthis person I was like they weren't\nthere like it was a really private\nwedding yeah but it's like everyone\nassumes that all these people were there\nand now that all these magazines are\nprinted it everyone assumes that it was\njust this big celebrity wedding it's\nlike well it wasn't it it was just a\nreally intimate friends and family\nwedding you laugh yeah it's you guys\npulled this out of nowhere nowhere like\nit was just crazy to me I was like how\ndo you make this up like you know and so\nthere was no official guest list printed\nexternally anyway all right uh yeah and\nthen one that kind of like got to you or\nif there was one that like made you more\nemotional or things that make you more\nemotional in general things that make me\nmore emotional are definitely ones that\ntry to display my character in a way\nwhere you know I I don't want to defend\neverything that I do I don't want to\ndefend every rumor that comes out about\nme but it's like to think that people\nthink I'm capable of\ndoing these things that you know are\nsometimes so horrible or you know there\nespecially when I was like 16 16 was\nreally hard for me and I would hear\nthese grown adults every single day\nCharlie did this Charlie did that\nCharlie did this I literally it was\nactually right when I hit 100 million I\nthink I was at the lowest mental state\npossible and I looked so happy\nonline and it got to the point where I\nwas I was like I'm not doing this\nanymore like I physically cannot do this\nlike it got really dark to where I was\nlike I don't even want to be here here\nanymore and I think back to those times\nand the grown adults that put\n16-year-old me in that\nmindset and I'm just like like you guys\nhave kids now like you guys are are\ngrown and first of all never got an\napology through a direct message never\ngot an apology or anything besides if it\nwas for other people or that they want\nsomething from me and I just\nlike I wish that they could see what\nthey did to me and how truly horrible\nthey treated me and like what if that\nwas your kid what if what if that was\nyou how would you feel and like I'm so\nproud of myself for getting myself\nthrough that cuz that really like\ndepending on how I responded to that\ncould have changed the trajectory of my\nlife whether I started to cope in\nunhealthy ways or or harmed myself or\ndid something that you know would make\nthese people feel bad like I'm just very\nglad that I have the people around me\nand also got to give some credit to\nmyself was able to get out of that MH I\ncan't I mean even just hearing you talk\nabout it like it feels so hard and heavy\nand like I can feel how intense it could\nhave been like what got you through that\nlike what was it that because at 16 I\nmean you don't have a lot to pull on\nlike what gets you through all of that\nespecially being around you know now\nyour family is more used to it so\neveryone has a bit more doesn't make it\neasier I'm not saying it makes it easier\nbut people are more aware of it yeah for\nsure but at that time it's like right at\nthe\nbeginning you\nknow it was really hard for a long time\nand especially at that point I showed\nmyself in a very specific light and\ndidn't want to let anyone know it was\ngetting to me and then I would go and\nand cry on live and and I think back to\nthat and I think it was the people that\nI had around me like it was getting to\nthe point where like people were coming\nto my house to check on me like it was\nbad and like I don't know if these\npeople that did this like I think they\nknow who they are but are ever going to\nsee this like first of all I think I\ndeserve an apology second of all not\nthat I need one because I'm content with\nwith how it happened whatever but the\nfact that there's no accountability for\nthose people but there was so much\naccountability for a 16-year-old I think\nis so wild and there's so like honestly\nthe hardest stuff to deal with was the\npeople that were grown adults that were\nlike just ripping on me every second of\nevery day like 20 videos like what I now\nlook back and I'm so disgusted by the\nfact that these people like thought that\nthat was okay it's so wild and I'm just\nI'm very thankful that I had my friends\nand my family\nand enough in myself to want to get\nthrough it and come out the other side\nand show these people that they can't\nruin me and I have more to show people\nthan what I've done so\nfar that's so powerful and it's so no it\nreally is it's so powerful to hear that\nand it's and it it breaks my heart\nhearing it too\nbecause I totally get what you're saying\nin terms of just like when you have kids\nwe live in a world that wants to\nprioritize mental health but then when\nwe take people apart whether they've\nmade a mistake or not yeah we're not\nmindful of their mental health at all\nand it's almost like if someone's made a\nmistake or maybe not even made a mistake\nit's almost like well now we don't have\nto treat them as if they have mental\nhealth yeah at all or it's like people\nloved me because I wasn't perfect and I\nwas authentic but then anytime I would\nmix up my words or make a mistake or do\nanything outside of what was okay for\nthese people it was like yeah well I\nhate her and everyone should hate her\nand she's a horrible person because of\nthis and I was like but what did I do\nlike it was so hard to come to terms to\nthe fact that so many people hated me\nand I was just doing my best I was like\nbut I I don't get it like all I do is\ntry to please everyone around me and\nthey're not happy like how do I how do I\ndo this I'm never going to win and you\nknow that's really hard like I give\nmyself so much credit for how I handled\nthis stuff the best way I knew how\nlike so wild if you ever doubt how tough\nyou are you just got to remember 16year\nold Charlie cuz she was a beast that's\nso tough that is really really intense\nthat is really really intense how have\nyou dealt with that feeling of like\ntrying to keep everyone else I know\nyou've talked about it before the idea\nof like trying to keep everyone else\nafloat and you want to kind of let go of\nthat pressure do you feel like you've\nlet go of it or do you feel like you're\nletting go of it I think I am in certain\naspects but also leaning into it a\nlittle you know like maybe not what the\ninternet wants but what does my family\nwant what do my friends want what does\nmy boyfriend want you know\nlike those people what do my true fans\nwant what do they want me to put out\nthat would make them happy cuz I'm doing\nit for these people and maybe if I'm\nfeeling a little bit burnt out right now\nI really think back to well this is the\nreason that I started doing it you know\nbut\nalso understanding that I have to listen\nto myself and what I need yeah figuring\nout that balance which I don't think\nI'll ever truly get the hang of because\nit's always changing but at least\nacknowledging it m MH all right question\nfour and five last two questions what's\nsomething new that you're trying to\nlearn this year or something that a\nskill that you're trying to develop I\nwant to get better at\npacking I love that and like traveling\ncuz you travel so much yeah and it's\nsuch a stressor for me literally every\nsingle time before I leave for a trip I\nwill have a little mental breakdown full\nlike tears\neverything it's a that's another control\nthing and a very obsessive compulsive\nthing that I do because I like to have\nmy stuff around me I like to have my\nthings I like to\nhave everything that I could possibly\nneed like even in my purse I have\neverything that I could possibly need\nfor if I go on a 3-day vacation like it\njust causes me so much stress that I\nwould like to be able to take a\novernight trip mhm and just like pack\nand go without worrying so much like\nthat would be the dream yeah that's a\ngreat that I think that's a great skill\nthat I wish everyone was taught out to\ndo definitely there are great Packers\nand there are bad Packers and I'm a bad\nPacker for sure and I get that do what\nmy wife does my wife just takes six\nsuitcases she just lit my sister she\nwill go places pack like an hour before\nshe's like only brought one shoe like\nhow how do you do this this is insane\nyeah that's amazing I love it all right\ngreat Charlie final question Fifth and\nfinal question if you could and you can\ntake your time with this if you could\ncreate one rule or one law that everyone\nin the world had to follow what would it\nbe lead with\nempathy don't be so hard on every single\nthing every situation everything no\nmatter what like you never ever know\nwhat someone's truly going through even\nyou can ask me what's wrong and I could\ntell you one thing and maybe deep down\nit's something else that I'm embarrassed\nto tell you about like you just never\nknow the struggle that someone's dealing\nwith when they're by themselves so just\nbe a little more empathetic I feel like\nCo really you know caused people to\nreact fast just take a step back you\nknow cure people\nout just calm down calm down a little\nbit yeah it's so needed for ourself and\nothers and it's amazing how many of us\nwe all know we need that\nworld but it's almost like the system\nand society and the way it works is set\nup to make us not be that yeah right\nlike we all want that we all say that\nand then something happens in the press\nand then everyone jumps on it and like\nit and I have to say that to myself too\nyeah keep yourself in check you know\ndefinitely Charlie I love how this\nconversation's been so fun and deep and\nlike random and you and I love that\nbecause that's what all of us are right\nlike a thing if you try and have a\nconversation that's just deep or just\ncool or just whatever it doesn't work\nbut when you just get to know someone\n360 it's it's a bit quirky it's a bit\nfunny it's it was super thoughtful and\ninsightful and I'm so glad that it was\ntruly you I hope you felt that way yeah\ndefinitely this is refreshing for me\ngood I'm glad and thank you so much for\ntrusting me and uh being here and I'm so\ngrateful and everyone who's been\nlistening or watching whether you're\nwalking your dogs because I know you do\nthat whether you're at the gy gym\nwhether you're driving to and from work\nor whether you're editing a video right\nnow I want to say thank you to you for\nlistening and I hope that you're going\nto share your highlights of so many\ngreat insights thoughts just Reflections\nI think that Charlie shared with us\ntoday make sure you share the ones that\nstood out to you tag both me and Charlie\nas well whether you're using Tik Tok X\nor Instagram because I love seeing what\nyou related to and what you connected to\nthere was so many parts today I felt\nwhen I was listening I was like oh I get\nthat like I hear that and I want to know\nwhat you heard and what you understood\nand what you learned uh Charlie thank\nyou so much again I hope you'll come on\nmany many more times in the futk you for\nhaving me seriously this was really nice\nto be able to have the space to talk\nabout anything well

healing your inner child\nyou could be reading something that\nsomeone is saying about you and being\nlike that is so unfair cuz that's not\nwho I am and that really gets to me\nsometimes but then looking at myself in\nthe mirror and being like but I know who\nI am why does anything else matter"
