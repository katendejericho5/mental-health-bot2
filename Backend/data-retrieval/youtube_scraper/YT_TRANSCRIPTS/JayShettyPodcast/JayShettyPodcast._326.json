    "transcript": "to be honest so much of it is just about\nnot feeling like on set and in my\ntrailer when I'm alone wanting to tear\nmy skin\noff so the future I think I couldn't see\nit cuz I didn't know how much longer I'd\nlast feeling that way in my day-to-day\nlife everyone's sort of go-to was your\ndream's coming true your dream's coming\ntrue your dream's coming true Kate\nWinslet

on\npurpose thank you so much thank you so\nmuch for making the time for for being\nhere I know you're in La only for a few\ndays and I'm grateful that I get to\nsteal some of that time thank you for\nhaving me here yeah well today we're\ntalking about your incredible new Memoir\nfor anyone who hasn't already read this\nbook I highly recommend that you go and\ngrab it we're going to put a link in the\ncaption so that you can order it right\nnow page boy uh please make sure that\nyou go and grab a copy if you're\nenjoying this conversation Elliot when I\nyou know was reading through the book I\nwas truly just first of all I just felt\nvery um grateful that someone was\nletting us in on such an intimate part\nof their life and doing it in such a\ngraceful and thoughtful way and even the\nstructure of the book too I was just\nlike oh this is like easing me in a way\nthat I wouldn't expect to from a memoir\nusually and you chose this not linear\napproach consciously and intentionally\ncould you explain why you felt that that\nwas the right way to share your\nstory yeah I mean for me the\nnonlinearity of it is a reflection on\nsome level of speaking for myself the\ntrans and queer experience and how that\nJourney weaves how we get close to our\ntruth potentially pull back maybe know\nourselves very very deeply before we've\nbeen inundated with you know uh the\nsociety and its expectations that are\noften toxic and and limiting and uh you\nknow so for me in regards to exploration\nof memory and of those moments of my\nlife where I I did feel close and then\nwould pull back potentially because I\nwas frightened um overwhelmed or what\nhave you\nso um I guess also personally I enjoy\nwhen books are nonlinear you know um\nwhere in different themes and topics and\nhistory and emotion and what have you\ncan uh all sort of collide so that's\njust inherently I guess exciting to me\nand also yeah I think it reflects the\nsort of queer trans Journey on some\nlevel I love the phrase you just used\nthe exploration of memory I don't know\nmy mind just latched on to it and I\nthought wow that's a really interesting\nway of putting it I think our\nmemory so often is a beautiful thing it\nso often fails us it's so often\nskewed what was it like for you going\ndown memory lane and when you said\nexploration of memory what did you\ndiscover or explore about memory when\nyou're putting together a memoir I feel\nlike I feel like there must be something\nin there for me so many of um you know\nthe stories or the moments that I chose\nare ones that have just always been\nvibrating under the right under the\nsurface and\nfound the act of writing it in in many\nways was quite organic it was sort of I\nsit down think of a\nperiod think of a relationship that\ncould potentially sort of speak to many\nthings during that time or a friendship\nor an incident or what have you and then\nsort of mold around that and for me so\nmuch of what came up was the stuff that\nwas kind of always running around uh my\nbrain so some of my earliest memories\nwhen I was you know in preschool to\nobviously then all over the place\nthroughout so I think a lot of the the\ninstances and feelings were quite sort\nof readily available and tangible for me\nthe experience\nwas I don't know if this comes from like\nacting or having so much of my life\nbeing a part of telling stories where it\nwas as if I could sort of picture the\nmoment and feel the moment and it was as\nif I was just describing this movie I\nwas watching or something do you find\nI'm always fascinated by this especially\nwith people who are in film making do\nyou find that when you're looking at a\nmemory you're seeing\nyourself move or are you kind of the\nperson doing the moving does that make\nsense yeah it does I think I think\nprobably both com combination of of the\ntwo yeah probably also a a conscious\nremoval on some level to be able to you\nknow give a texture and and and and\ndescription that hopefully will you know\npull the reader into it absolutely where\nI always find that all my memories which\nit took me a long time to realize this\nall my memories that are based on\npictures are ones where I'm seeing\nmyself as opposed to memories that I\nactually have from my mind if that yeah\nif that makes sense like whenever I see\na picture of me and my family then I'm\nlike oh actually I don't have a memory\nof that I just have a picture that\nsparked something for you was there a\nmemory that was more of a discovery or a\nmemory that was like oh I didn't I\nforgot that that happened or I maybe\ndidn't pay enough attention to that when\nit happened was there anything that came\nup that way or was it more just things\nthat were already there I wouldn't say\nanything sort of necessarily sparked or\nem emerged out of nowhere that was was a\nsurprise but I think on some\nlevel\nand this made you know the experience of\nwriting it of course intense in moments\nbut ultimately really healing and\ncathartic I think there was a lot of\nmemories that I had just so swept under\nthe rug where you become so conditioned\nto let certain things go certain\nBehavior coming at you you\ngo that even sitting here right now I\ncan kind of feel it in my body to\nregister how much certain things really\ndid affect me and and my life and my\nphysical well-being and my emotional\nwell-being and what have you so it was\nalmost more like there was like a\ntherapeutic element to it on some level\nbut sitting with the reality of some\nthings that I think was actually really\nimportant yeah well thank you for doing\nit here and and here in both places\nbecause I I I can only imagine how much\ncourage it takes to do that so so thank\nyou for even experiencing it even now as\nyou were saying you can feel it in your\nbody and I can see that it's I can I can\nonly imagine how much courage that takes\nso thank you thank you for going there\nfor us how does it feel to\nfinally be living the way you've always\nwanted to and being perceived in the way\nyou've always perceived\nyourself it's\nlike getting to feel a way that I never\nthought was possible M like when I would\njust think about my future and how I was\ngoing to feel and\nI had a very difficult time seeing it\neven this morning I saw a friend and I\ndon't see him as much because he lives\nhere and he's just like this like\nlightness in you he's just like oh my\ngosh\nit's such a amazing thing to see and\nthis is someone who's been in my life\nsince I was you know first really in Los\nAngeles at the age of about 20 like\nconsistently is when we first met\ninitially so it's uh yeah it's getting\nto exist in a way that I never thought\npossible doesn't mean I'm not human who\ndoesn't have difficult days or you know\nSparks of anxiety naturally um but it's\num a complete GameChanger just getting\nto feel being able to do this this would\nhave been a one impossible before\nimpossible I could have\nnever simply the action of sitting down\nfor the length that it takes to have\nspace in my mind freed from everything\nelse that was occupying it to feel the\nsort of surge of creativity and feelings\nof just being\ninspired and waking up and being able to\nactually sit down with myself and and do\nsomething like this um impossible before\nimpossible what would your thoughts\nabout the future have been then that you\nthink made it feel so impossible as you\nsaid you used to think about the future\nand it could never have felt as good as\nit does today despite there being\nnatural human challenges obviously but\nyeah what would what would that picture\nof the future would have been I think\nthe way like the way to explain it is\nalmost\nlike it's almost as if your days I I\njust do feel like for very significant\nperiods of my life I struggled to\nfunction on a pretty basic level you\nknow it was hard for me to just\nliterally sit down it was hard for me to\nbe productive it was hard for me to be\nyou know present at all and so the\nfuture I think I couldn't see it cuz I\ndidn't know how much longer I'd last\nfeeling that way in my day-to-day life\nhow does it feel now reconnecting with\nacting being who\nyou've always been and perceiving being\nperceived in that way like what is what\nis acting like now has your relationship\nwith acting changed is it better is it\nmore so much better yeah I mean I mean\nliterally everything in my life is\nbetter now because of how I get to feel\nand feeling embodied and present and you\nknow all these things really for the\nfirst time because this is the other\nthing I have people say to me or I'd say\nto myself like like you're an actor just\nput on the clothes flip the switch play\nthe game you know\nwhatever but uh I wasn't starting from\nthis foundational place of\nmyself and as much as acting is about\ninhabiting uh you know another\npersonality or um you know whatever\nmanifestations of of a character what\nhave you it you're always bringing\nyourself to a role right like you're\nit's so much about connecting to a\ncharacter to a story to motivation to\nemotion to trauma to whatever to the joy\nto what have you and developing your\nconnection with that and then molding\nsomething on that\nso the I used to be so profoundly\nuncomfortable and I feel like I see that\nin work like uh inability to sort\nof I almost think of the word loose like\nand now there's like this like looseness\nthere's this ability to just like exist\nevery day on set be in my body and\nthat's the starting point I'm not having\nto like fight through something to get\nto the starting point you know where's I\nknow people approach the work\ndifferently but to me it's about being\nas present and open as absolutely\npossible with all the you know\ninformation you've gathered about how\nyou want to you know play this role or\napproach it so it's allowing for that\nand it's feeling like how acting felt in\nthe moments when I was the most in\ninspired which usually were roles that\nsomewhat I could almost handle you know\nI could handle the you know there'd\nstill be some discomfort but it was at\nleast somewhat closer to who I was which\nagain sounds counterintuitive to acting\nbut to me the the presence of it is what\nmakes it possible and the most powerful\nyeah it's it's hard to even though\nsomething's an art and then there's\nhumans it's hard to separate the two\nlike it's it's hard to just say oh well\nthat's an art you turn it on like and\noff like a switch and then then there's\nyour life and I think we all know that\nregardless of our disposition or setup\nthey the two intertwin anyway absolutely\nyou know and so what parts of the art do\nyou feel have drastically improved for\nyou now like that you just feel more\nconnected to or as you said I love the\nwords open and present too I mean to be\nhonest so much of it is just about not\nfeeling like onset and in my trailer\nwhen I'm alone and wanting to tear my\nskin off I don't know whatever the sort\nof physical ways that I would feel and\nlike I can remember I'd call my you know\nmanager on films and just be like I'm\nI'm not okay like I and not necessarily\nhaving the words or having them but\nnot not being able to fully follow\nthrough with the thought I guess so so\nmuch of as it actually is like to be\nhonest if someone had told me oh you\ncome out as trans and you'll never work\nas an actor again I would have been like\ncool like all right I'd way rather live\nmy life and be myself and engage with\nthe world as myself and feel embodied\nand not feel like I don't know how to\nget through the day yeah not\ninterested so for me I'm mostly like\nokay cool that the you know if I keep if\nI do get cast um The Fallout does seem\nto be this very positive aspect of of\nfeeling so much more grounded and\npresent that I think I will it's going\nto make performances better yeah and if\nit\ndoesn't\nI doesn't I don't really care yeah\nthat's not what life's about for me yeah\nI've had been in movies that have done\nwell and movies that have not done well\nand you're still where you are and\nliving your life and uh like I'm good\nyeah I love that I mean that that is I\nlove you said that's what life's about\nand and I I think it's so true like for\nall of us in our own ways wanting to\nfeel that we can truly be who we are and\nand be seen for who we are and be\naccepted for who we are is kind of what\nall of us on our journey are pursuing\nand seeking and when you say and and it\nsounds like to me and I'm trying to\ndeeply understand this as well it's like\nwhen you say I in the book you talk\nabout how you're like I knew when I was\nfour years old and it's like that\nknowingness and then you use the\nlanguage of like you know tearing off\nyour own skin like that idea to me feels\nlike when there's such a strong\nknowingness\ninside knowing is different to feeling\nand and it sounds like when I was\nreading I was like there was just\nknowingness and and I was intrigued as\nto is that the right language do you\nagree with that and what is the\ndifference for you between knowing and\nfeeling because I think knowing is so\nmuch more of this like visceral deep\ngrounded rooting\nfeeling yeah I mean I suppose they're\nprobably both\nobviously interrelated to a degree and\nand connect I mean I think at those\nwhich are some of my earliest memories\nlike these moments that were just always\nlike right under the surface um was so\nmuch of how I felt uh at that age and\nwho I knew myself to be and how\nperplexed I was at how the world was\nseeing\nme and\nthen and when I was about 10 sort of\nlike kind\nof like pushing my mother to the degree\nthat I was like really actually getting\nto present how I wanted and like\nremembering just how good that felt and\nthis solidness and this this way I I\ncould could exist in the world without\nthe similar feelings that I had as a\nfull-blown adult of wanting to rip my\nskin off that I was feeling at really\nyoung ages and not obviously having the\nwords for but in some ways you're like\nno way I did have the words for them I\nwas going this is who I am and want to\nbe and these are the things that I want\nto wear and how I want to look and\npresent and you had people going you\nknow no I'm sorry you know so in some\nways you're like wait no I did have the\nwords and also I guess I did to a degree\nin my 20s and same thing people were\ngoing no you you can't do that you have\nto do this if you want a future in this\nindustry for example or you have to be\ncloseted or what have you so I think for\nme the knowing the knowing and the\nfeeling relate the the knowing and\nfeeling good about the knowing is is\nwhen you feel Euphoria is when you feel\nthat sense of connection when that's in\ncongruence with uh what you've been\nlabeled as and defined as and how you're\ngetting treated versus who you know you\nare you know then when that's heightened\nand like you're losing the sense of the\nknowing that's when all these awful\nfeelings come come up and the\nmanifestation and the consequences that\nare self harm obviously mental health\nstruggles and what have you feelings of\nhopelessness so I suppose they entwine\nin that way yeah definitely\ndefinitely I'm curious as\nto friends that you've had in the\ncommunity who may have been more limited\nby those statements or that push back or\nthat judgment how have you been able to\ntalk to others in the community what\nhave those conversations look like when\nthey're at their healthiest and at their\nbest gosh well I'd say those\nconversations are uh you crucial right\nI'd\nsay community\nis maybe the biggest reason why I even\nhere and able to exist and a lot of\nthose conversations\nand it goes both ways in the\nconversations is someone speaking to\nsomething that might be a thought or a\nfeeling that you thought you were alone\nwith because we obviously don't you know\nthere's not a tremendous amount of\nrepresentation and when you are able to\nconnect with someone that's having these\nsimilar experiences that have made you\nfeel very alone that have filled you\nwith shame potentially or put you into a\nsense of hiding\nis\nthe not that you want anyone else to be\nsuffering by any means but when you're\nable to speak to someone else who's also\nmaybe had the similar feelings when they\nwere for who uh maybe had similar um\nmanifestations of uh of their pain I\nsuppose you feel less alone you are then\nin a position where you know I can offer\nsupport and support's been offered to me\nfrom so many trans people that I'm close\nto and people I've never met whose books\nI've read who's you know who've deeply\ninspired me so yeah were there any\nparticular books or people that you\ndidn't know that you came across that\nyou think you'd recommend to people to\nconnect with that you felt were powerful\nfor you while you obviously now that\nyour book's going to play the same role\nfor so many others gosh I mean so many\nand then yet some people I know some I\ndon't and um also a couple books I've\nread recently actually Travis\nalabanza book that came out in the UK\ncomes out here I think next month called\nnone of the above is\njust astounding I don't know if you're\nfamiliar with them I'm not no no I'm not\nyeah brilliant um also a British book\ncalled um trans a trans man walks into a\ngay bar by Harry Nicholas\num stunning book anyway I just sort of\nlike just read those oh and I just read\na collection of um I don't know if\nyou're familiar with Lou Sullivan\nthey've published like massive amount of\nhis Diaries which I just read and that\nwas actually quite an interesting read\nBecause at first you're reading\nsomeone's diary like it is very I did\nthis then I met this person and then you\nreally get into the flow of it and it's\nvery you know it's beautiful it's\nemotional and intense and mock books\nwhich are stunning those uh I read\nprobably around the age of 30 Thomas\npaig mcb's but amateur and man\nalive\num I'm blanking no I mean you've given\nus a great list that's a that's a\nphenomenal list I mean to even get\nstarted with and it's it's incredible to\nhear how much you know I mean you were\njust reeling off of book names there but\nit's like so much deep study of you know\nwe did you ever keep a diary or during\nthis time or a journal or anything at\nall over your time or was this something\nthat was all happening in your mind\nultimately mine for the most part there\nwere little I did go like hunting in uh\nfor any kind of old writing from\nwhatever age and I found some things as\na teen late teens and like little things\nfrom in my 20s and did kind of regret\nnot writing more because a lot of those\nwere really helpful um and fascinating\nto just read you know thinking back so\nno not so much but yeah but you'd\nrecommend it as a as a practice and I\nkeep meaning to do it and I'm not I\ndon't know maybe I like I wrote a book\nbook tour was a lot I'm like I'm just\ntaking a moment and then I'll I think\nthat's fair get back into the writing\nflow I think that's completely fair\nbooks and book tours it's almost like\nyou finish writing a book and you think\nthe job's done and then it's like just\nstarted and it's yeah no completely\ncompletely understand that you you were\nsaying that you know and I I liked how\nyou were thinking that through you were\nlike I actually did have the right words\nat 4 and then at 10 and I wonder how\nmany young people are going to have the\nsame conversation with their parents in\nthe next few years and think you know\nwe're going to have more parents hearing\nthe words that you used to from from\ntheir children what do you think would\nbe a healthy response from parents that\nyou think would be helpful or that you\nwould encourage so that they could be\nable to better stay connected to their\nchildren as they're going on their own\njourney I think you really need to just\nlisten to your\nchildren\nand not be dismissive of what they're\nexpressing not shame them for embarrass\nthem for what they're\nexpressing and allow a child the the\nspace to explore you know I mean even as\nan adult the things I was saying to\nmyself the things I'd internalized and I\nremember this moment which when people\nsay things like what do you say to young\npeople who might be struggling or people\nare struggling is I went from oh am I\nthis oh I don't know oh\nto whoa wait why does this energy need\nto be this way why can't I just be going\nhuh H yeah maybe I am maybe yall go find\nsomeone and finally sit down and really\ncommit to speaking about this and how\nI'm feeling and my relationship with my\ngender and my body CU I'm not okay and\nwhy can't I put my shoulders back and\nspeak to this and explore this and I\nthink in so many ways it's just about\ncreating that space that gentleness and\nlistening and educating yourself you\nknow there is a lack of information and\nthere is a tremendous amount of lies and\nmisinformation about trans people\nparticularly about our healthare\nparticularly about health care for youth\nso also try and educate yourself from\nactual sources from lived experience and\nand also care that's supported by every\nMajor Medical Institution in the United\nStates could you exp and and if this is\nyour field of knowledge could you expand\non some of those lies or some of that\nmisinformation that's out there\nespecially to do with healthcare because\nI think that would be really useful if\nif you feel comfortable too yeah I mean\nI can I can do my best I guess yeah but\num I mean the idea that children's\nbodies are being mutilated flat out Li\njust literally not true um the idea that\nuh puberty blockers are experimental no\nthey've been used for decades um for\nchildren who have uh precocious puberty\num and this care is sort of framed as\nsomething that's like very easily\naccessible and immediate not the case at\nall uh most trans people are have an\nincredibly difficult time accessing care\nit's not how it's Being Framed in terms\nof this um as if it's getting like\npushed I it's like the opposite um and\nthis is like a\nvery\nthorough\npatient process that deeply involves the\nparents of course and so much of the\ncare for children or you know young kids\nis just about supporting them uh\nsupporting a a social transition\npotentially you know name change pronoun\nchange how they might want to dress cut\ntheir hair whatever you know very you\nknow basic aspects of you know how we\nexist and how we're alive and then you\nknow the moment a a child starts to show\nany sort of characteristic of of puberty\nthat's when the conversation weighed out\nconversation with all the information\neverybody involved about puberty\nblockers which can stop and then you\nknow if if that's the choice or continue\npotentially do hormones and then when\nwe're talking about any kind of you know\nsurgical aspect nothing like that is\nhappening until the age of typically 18\nin some cases 16 but um\nso I guess that's like the bulk of what\nI see is this idea that children are\ngetting like mutilated or brainwashed or\nin environments that are forcing it it's\nthe opposite actually you know trans and\ngender non-conforming people are um\nbullied deal with\ndisproportionate violence um\nso so much of that is just just\nliterally not true right yeah thank you\nfor sharing that yeah no it's it's\nuseful because yeah I think that the\nchallenges\nwith with all of this is like you said\nthere's so much information that it's\nhard for as misinformation and\ninformation that it's hard for people to\nkind of hear about things effectively\nand and we hope that these conversations\nlike this can lead to people doing their\nown research finding the right sources\nso that they can actually be able to\nmake sense of you know something that\nthey may not understand as well as\nopposed to having an assumption based on\nuh broad\ngeneralized yeah headlines or we're just\nhearing people that have no amount like\noh I didn't know you were a medical\nprofessional you're not talking about\nany other sort of\nMedical Care uh uh in this way when it's\nsupported\nby every Major Medical Institution in\nthe United States yeah what do you think\ntrans men can add to the conversation of\nmasculinity or add to the thoughts and\nbelief system around masculinity I'd\nlove to hear your perspectives on that I\nthink we can add something I believe and\nuh the book amateur I mentioned by\nThomas Paige MCB is so much about really\na contemplation of masculinity what it\nmeans to be a man the man he wants to be\nwhat have you beautiful book I think\nyou'd love it I mean I've had a lived\nexperience of being perceived as not a\nman of course um\nand also the sort of brief experience of\nlike entering that space and like\ngetting sort of treated in a different\nway or in many ways I feel so much for\ncismen being brought up\nand the limits put on them emotionally\nencourage to be you know not sensitive\nthat vulnerability is weakness on some\nlevel or what have you just ingrained\nmisogyny obviously we live in a very\nmisogynistic Society clear phobic\nSociety transphobic society and\nhaving certain experiences I've had in\nmy life with men um has definitely\nhighlighted certain things that I\npersonally wouldn't want to be and I\nsuppose\ntrans man trans mask people\ncan come to the table with\nuh with those experiences and and\npotentially offer something different or\nan Insight that's different or I hope\nfor cismen in so many ways that there\ncan be more encouragement for expressing\nemotion and sensitivity and having close\nfriendships with other men and all these\nthings that seem to to happen that\nare\ntoxic yeah I think there's become such a\npressure as well to just play the role\nof protector and provider and that stoic\nkind of cold demeanor around around\nemotion or challenges or stress and that\ncomes with its own form of limits to The\nHuman Experience to self-expression to\nyou know I've I've always found\npersonally because I was raised by my\nmom growing up and witnessed her\nstruggle and her stress and her pain and\nher her Challenge and just her\nresilience and then also with a younger\nsister it was I found that very useful\nbecause I grew up in an environment that\nwas highly emotive and highly supportive\nof being emotive and and and expressing\nemotion and I often think about if I\ndidn't have that experience I don't know\nwhere else I would have got that from in\nmy life and and that's interesting to\nthink about like how I could have grown\nup and never had that Compass it would\nit would never even have come across me\nwhere else would I have learned that I\nwouldn't have definitely wouldn't have\nlearned it at school definitely wouldn't\nhave learned it at college\nand then in the world of work I\ndefinitely wouldn't have learned it\neither so you could literally spend your\nwhole life and never access some of\nthese subtle\nnuanced Expressions which are so key are\nthere any specific interactions you've\nhad or moments you've had where this\nkind of experience has been heightened\nor some of the things you mentioned that\nyou felt like oh wow this was this was\nreally powerful for someone or something\nI think maybe it allowed me to have\ncertain conversations\nwith cismen that I hadn't had before\nlike it created an an opening and be\nquite frankly more empathy because I've\nhad not great experiences with men and\num it's easy to lose some of the empathy\nsometimes you know I think it's allowed\nme to have conversations with men about\nhow they have not felt permitted to\nexpress the themselves or have close\nrelationships with other men or you know\na sort of a certain age where emoting or\nself-expression in that way is is not\nseen as a positive and if anything you\nknow aggression is more you know\ncelebrated or or or encouraged which is\ndamaging to the person themsel and\nobviously the world in my life I've\nnoticed things that are just more you\nknow subtle but like men who used to if\nI hadn't seen them for a while we used\nto hug and then now we're like there's\nno hug and I'm just like you know these\nlittle things I'm like wow that's\nfascinating you know you know even\nmyself at the very beginning like going\nhaving these like really brief moments\nlike oh should I talk with my hands less\nlike what Elliot did that thought\nactually just enter your brain no be\nexactly who you are but it highlighted\nsomething that even just in that tiny\namount of time\nsomething in me was starting to judge\nmyself about how I was going to\nbe as the man that I am I'm going to\ngrow up to be and it's you know it's\nit's sort embarrassing too to to admit\nbut feeling\nthose those sort of yeah pressures or\nmisguided um thoughts M but yeah I think\nit's allowed me to have quite meaning\nconversations with with male friends\nthat um we hadn't really had before yeah\nand they probably haven't had before\nyeah and I think and then I will say one\nthing I feel like a lot is blamed on\ntestosterone and as someone who's\nliterally jokes on me going through\npurty again I will say like I'm not more\nangry I'm the least angry I've ever been\nit doesn't like I think you know we're\nnot taking into account the degree of\nsocialization and and uh and like talkx\nlimitations that encourage you know a\nlot of the behavior and issues we see\nwith toxic\nmasculinity another challenge that you\nraised in the book you said research has\nshown that transgender and gender\nnon-conforming youth are four times more\nlikely to struggle with an eating\ndisorder that obviously creates its own\ncomplexity what what was the what do the\nresearch point to as the reason behind\nthat and and how people can find support\naround that especially with that\ncomplication well gosh I mean I'm not a\nobviously like a professional that could\ngive some exact yeah what have you come\nacross is my question I mean from my\nexperience it's you know a profound\ndiscomfort in the body of wanting to\nhave a sense of control for me in some\nways I think to being smaller L I looked\nmore boyish when I was you know so this\nsort of way of like literally\ncontrolling the body and also just the\nsort\nof you know sort of psychically mentally\nso much of your time becomes consumed\nwith those thoughts that think it's\nallowing you to not focus on other\nthings to think about other things to\ncontemplate other things you talk about\nin the book about how like your thoughts\nwere\nconsumed with contemplation for a very\nlong time and I guess that now that\nyou're able to not have to contemplate\nthose same thoughts almost like what\nwe're talking about the beginning about\nthe thoughts about the future and the\nthoughts about it being impossible what\nnow that you have that headp space back\nor hopefully more of it back what would\nthat now be what are you directing that\ntowards or what opportunities that\nopening or where are you able to spend\nthat thought\npower wrote a\nbook I wrote a yeah I wrote a book I\nmean I make you know for fun like music\nwith a friend uh it's actually hard to\ndescribe when it's literally now every\naspect in every moment of my life you\nknow like when people go oh what was\nyour last in inent of like gender\nEuphoria I'm like oh this morning when I\nwas drinking coffee in silence and just\nbeing able to sit and have my coffee\ndoing things in the past that like I did\nenjoy but a part of me wasn't there so\nit could just be going to meet some\nfriends in in the park and I'm really\nable to just be in the park with them\nI'm not thinking about oh well are they\ngoing to did I eat well you only ate\nthis much time ago and oh oh God I'm so\nuncomfortable and tucking down my shirt\nand looking and just kind of wanting to\nget out always like always wanting to\njust the sense of always wanting to flee\nand\nnow sometimes of course there's moments\nwhere I'm like I'd really love to just\nbe home reading a book right now I mean\nlike I'm not like it's not like I'm like\nJohnny social all of a sudden but going\nfrom having like a very difficult time\nbeing social and feeling connected or\nnow getting to feel feel like immersed\nin life versus struggling to know how to\nlive it wow that I that definitely\nregisters hearing that definitely hits\nthank you for explaining that there when\nyou went on the book tour and you\nobviously as you just said you wrote the\nbook what's been what have been the\nresponses that have really warmed your\nheart or that have really connected to\nyou in a way that are going to stay with\nyou for a long long time either on tour\nor I'm sure you've had so many people\nwrite to you because of the book and\nwrite to your team and everyone else\nwhat are some of the what are some of\nthose that you could tell us now\nespecially now that the book's been out\nfor a while guessing it's only getting\nmore and more yeah I think um the most\nmoving uh and beautiful responses are\npeople kind of expressing at all\nages how me and sharing my story has\nhelped them you\nknow feel less alone\nhelped them talk to their parents in a\nnew way helped them\nfeel carry less\nshame I had a letter from someone who\nwas they might have they might have been\nyou know 50 and they'd read the book and\nthen like you know finally had decided\nyes I'm going on testosterone and just\nsaying like how much that decision had\nchanged their life and I\nfully was like crying when I read this I\nwas just so um well thankful that they'd\nwant to you know share that with\nme and also to know that anything you\ncould have done or expressed would would\nhelp\nsomeone feel less alone because I know\nhow alone you can feel I know how\noverwhelmed and burdened you can feel by\nthis self-hate and discomfort that just\nis constantly running through your\nbody and what it means when you do get\nthose moments of clarity and feel\nconnection i' as I've said have had that\nwith books I've read or you know\nfriendships and and what commun\ncommunities offered me so those are\nbeautiful moments and then even you know\na friend of mine who's who's transm mask\nand\nthey their mom read the book in like a\ncouple days and they said I'm now having\nconversations with my mom that I didn't\nthink were possible before it's\nlike I mean at the end of the day like\nthat's the point I mean that's really\nthe\npoint it's like why else am I like\nspilling my guts in this thing like\nsometimes I feel like leading up to it\ncoming out I'm like oh my God why'd you\nwrite about that you know and then when\nyou have those moments that you know it\ncould be helping someone it's just like\nI to me that's the point yeah did you\nencounter anyone that initially may have\nbeen you know in their own way initially\ncritical or judgmental and then was able\nto kind of even just sit with you and\nhear from you or and and was able to\ncomprehend and understand\njust even a glimpse into the journey did\ndid you come across any of that or hear\nabout any of those types of stories from\nanyone I mean I suppose people I don't\nknow if uh you know the individual went\non like some huge Arc or change of\nthought but that it enabled them to to\nthink about and\nunderstand the experience a bit more and\nactually in so many ways that I think so\nspecial is how much they also related to\nit despite having an very different\nexperience you know not being\ntrans and how did they relate to it what\nwas they related it being um you know\nsis and gay and so obviously there's\ngoing to be like overlap there but\nhad maybe they did have their certain\nfeelings about trans people or thoughts\nand the book really did help you know\ntheir mind change to a degree I'm so\nglad that I mean there's so many books\nthat you mentioned today that I want to\nread and I know that you know our\ncommunity is hopefully going to read\npage boy as well after this\nbut it's fascinating to me just\nhow how we all became trained in\ndifferent ways conditioned in different\nways to become closed to experiences\nthat you would hope we would have become\nmore Curious to learn about and more\nopen to learn about and it's it's\nfascinating to me as a society how we\nbecome more and more close-minded about\nso many issues as opposed to being\nbroadminded when it obviously makes\nsense to be open-minded about things\nmakes us a healthier happier more growth\nfocused human and for me I've always\ntalked about how I think the best thing\nthat happened to me is I met\npeople who were very different to\nsociety when I was young and when I said\ndifferent I mean for me it was um uh\nmeeting spiritual monks like that was my\npersonal journey and so meeting a monk\nat 18 years old was so Random to my\nlife's journey that it was great because\nit presented a whole new way of thinking\nand ideology that I would never have\never thought could even be possible and\nit became such a big part of my life and\nI I just I I'm hoping that you know\nstories like yours and stories like this\nwill continue to help people open up\ntheir minds to recognize how much there\nis in common that we have and how much\nthere is in common experience that we\ncan learn from and be guided by even if\nit's not the same experience would that\nwould that be an\naccurate mission statement to a part of\nthe mission statement absolutely ideally\nyeah and I mean I you know like Memoir\nin particular it's I read a lot of and\nlove and so much of it are you know\nstories that are very different than\nmine and and people with different\nexperiences and identity and what have\nyou that have deeply touched me and\nmoved me and opened my mind and allowed\nme to grow and expand and we're all\nlearning all the time you know and it's\nit's beautiful to have the space or you\nknow to help create the space on any\nlevel that allow people to to grow and\nexpand in that way yeah how's your\nperspective on love changed and that\narea of your life definitely very\ndifferent now than I was in before I was\nvery much which I think's maybe\nrelatively evident in the book a bit of\na serial monogamist and just like really\ndid find it so hard to exist and in in\nfunction that\nI I do think like I needed someone like\nI\nand the moment there was like attraction\nor a feeling it's just sort of like\nuhhuh you know like and like hold on\ntight you know and staying in situations\nthat um I'm sure a lot of people again\nthis is something that so many people\nwould relate to in different ways\nsituations that weren't the wisest that\nprobably weren't great for either party\ninvolved and that came\nfrom really just not knowing how to\nExist by myself and the feeling of love\nright oof that's like like we escape\nit's pardon the pun but Transcendent you\nknow\nit's\nand that feeling would give me a spark\nof life it would give me a moment\nof I can\nbreathe ultimately though that's not the\nreason why I think we should be with\nsomeone and um it's Tad selfish on my\npart and uh now I\nI'm so blown away by the fact that I can\nbe alone like that is such an\nexhilarating sensation a an element of\nthe feeling way I never thought was\npossible that right now I'm very much\nenjoying\nbeing you\nknow connecting with people having some\nfun but just sort of being on my own\nright now and that is very new for me\nvery new for me yeah and I want love in\na relationship to\nbe you\nknow I mean our stuff's always going to\nfollow us into Intimate Relationships I\nknow but you know come from a a solid\nand embodied Foundation where I know I'm\ngoing into that because we're going to\nlove each other and explore life\ntogether and grow together and not\nbecause I'm clinging to something for\ndear\nlife that sounds like it must be such a\nsuch a so I'm single\nso\nI love it no\nbut that was brilliant I was I was about\nto say like just how meaningful that\nmust feel like to you know it must it\nsounds like such a a profound place that\nyou know it's such a deep space to to\nfeel\nthat centeredness and Stillness and\nbeing with oneself and\nthat confidence of just is just being\noneself but you're single so that's\nwe're going to throw that out there how\ndo you think the journey and of course\nyou know the communi the trans community\nso well so you would know how how do you\nthink the journey is different when you\nare in the public eye versus when you're\nnot like there are the obvious\ndifferences of course with we've talked\nabout like the pressure from success of\nmovies and things like that but are\nthere any more nuanced or subtle things\nthat some of us could miss in plain\nsight because you're not living that\nJourney or you're not seeing it\ndon't know I mean it's so funny because\nit's just like my I know strange\nexperience in this in this life um I\nmean maybe in that you're just going\nthrough this transition in front\nof a lot of people um and having people\nspeculate or make comments or\nassumptions about your life and your\nexperience that can often be incredibly\nhurtful and demeaning and at the same\ntime everything everything's like you\nknow relative everyone's sort of having\nthat in their own individual orbit and\nmy position obviously comes with such an\nenormous amount of privilege like my\nlife does not\nreflect the lives of most trans people\nwho deal with you know disproportionate\namount of unemployment poverty\nincarceration violence Etc um\nparticularly\nblack Trans people so I'd be lying if I\nsaid there weren't certain elements of\nthis sort of unusual experience that\ndon't have its sort of challenges or\ndifficult moments and at the same time\nwhat I always go back to is\nuh the degree in which my privilege and\nresources help and also protect me you\nknow if I'm getting threats I have the\nmoney to hire security I could get you\nknow pay for surgery to get it quickly\nyou know all of these aspects that name\nchange all you know think about that all\nthose documents just you know your\npassport like all of these things that\num for those that you know don't have\nthe certain Privileges and resources I\nhave is is incredibly difficult and\nmakes life incredibly difficult yeah and\nI'm I'm glad you raised that point\nbecause yeah I\nthink yeah we have we have to also look\nat it from that perspective of just\nagain going back to the reality of what\nthese choices and decisions like\nactually look like in in the real world\nbecause similar and I appreciate that\nview from you constantly of like looking\nat it from well this is what it actually\nlooks like this is what's actually going\non this is this is what we may not see\nif we're only looking at the you know\nthe and again that doesn't take away\nfrom your journey as well like that that\nshouldn't take away from the challenges\nand stresses and the the realities of\nwhat you're experiencing but I I wanted\nto Pivot to certain things because I\nfeel like I feel like the book is just\nthe beginning of so many more exciting\nincredible uh Adventures of of what\nyou'll go on to do and Achieve and I\nheard that you're a big uh history buff\nuh and and I'm guessing you're doing a\nlot of reading there I wonder whether\nthere's any uh has there been and and\nyou talked about even just I I love what\nyou've been saying that just and and you\nknow when I'm hearing someone speak and\nit really the the way you express\nthis has is really going to stay with me\nthis idea\nthat the biggest win is just you being\nable to do the simplest things in a\npresent way like that will stay with me\nso much because it's something that we\nall take for granted so much like you\nknow you just I know I do like it's a\nit's a very easy thing to miss out on\nand some of us are not even present but\neven if we are present we take that for\ngranted and so the idea that you feel so\nmuch presence in just having coffee this\nmorning or like reading a book or being\nwith friends in the park or what you\nknow all those examples you were\ngiving uh yeah I wanted to dive into\nwhat seeing as you're such a big reader\nuh when did you become such a history\nbuff and and what has been the latest\nhistoric discovery that that has kind of\nbrought you Joy I haven't been reading\ntoo much stuff about history or anything\nelse any anything you're reading oh\nlately I've been reading um Octavia\nButler\ncuz I embarass to say I hadn't read\nOctavia Butler before so I just read\nwild seed and Kindred I guess obviously\nthose books have a his Fantastical sort\nof history but obviously a very intense\nhistory element to it you know partic\nyou know wild seed and Kindred very\nbrutal history been reading more novels\nlately yeah obviously both of Octavia\nButler's books are novels but also um\nour wide under the sea was\ntremendous Brandon Taylor's new\nnovel I'm trying to is it called the\nlast Americans I might be getting the\nname wrong but his latest novel was\namazing so less like history specific\nit's all history yeah but obviously\nthere's historical elements in a lot of\nthe those different things yeah not\nreally the Brandon Taylor one at all no\nnot the novel but yeah yeah the other\nones yeah no no and and and I think that\nthat is the point right like I thinks\nfun biographies and Diaries and\nautobiographies are\nall have historical elements to them I\nmean that's that's where they come from\nand one part that felt very Journal like\nin your book was um at the end of the\nbook you describe being at the show with\nMark and having a moment of self-love\nthat you wanted to hold on to and you\nsay taking a deep breath exhaling\nexhaling down to my toes I wanted to\nhold on to the feeling to pocket The Joy\nthe fleeting moments of self-love and I\nthought that felt very diary like like\nit felt very like journaled thought it\nwas you know very unique words and I\nwanted to know like why did you choose\nto end the book at 16 years old like\nagain we talked about the nonlinear but\nspecifically to end on that after going\nthrough this journey back and forth what\nwas it what was\nso yeah why why end on 16 years\nold yeah well I felt\nlike sort of began the book at this time\nthat\nwas um also involved Mark and was this\nperiod\nof feeling more self-love feeling closer\nto myself Falling In Love With My First\nGirlfriend Paula and then you know that\nleading up to a moment that was a big\npivot in in my life and then to sort of\nuh you know bookend that with this\nmoment\n16 peaches\nconcert what would have been the\nqueerest environment I'd probably been\nin at that point in my\nlife\nand the just palpable Joy the\nelectricity of it\nand I'll never forget that night I'll\nnever forget walking home with Mark and\nwhat that felt like what that Community\nfelt like\nand to end on that note there at 16\nhaving that atmosphere to go to having\nthat incredible performer who's inspired\nme since I was a\nteenager it felt like a special moment\nto end on yeah I I definitely felt it\nand it's it's wonderful to have that\nexperience of euphoria through your\nexperience in that moment and you know\nElliot we I I just want to say how\nhonestly I was so excited to meet you\ntoday and and do this\ninterview and I love it when this\nhappens when you get an experience that\nyou didn't know you were going to get\nand that's how I feel with you today\nwhere you can always intellectualize\nwhat you think you're going to learn or\nwhat you think you're going to gain and\nI had all those ideas which I definitely\nhave learned so much it's not that I\nhaven't learned but it's I've kind of\nbeen moved more internally and and I\nfeel that that's sometimes even even\nmore valuable because it's something\nthat I can express from a deep Place\nWithin Myself and I feel like I've been\nmoved by you sharing your experience so\nthoughtfully and intimately in your book\nbut also even getting the opportunity to\nsit with you today and I only have a\ncouple more questions for you we ask at\nthe end of every interview do a final\nfive which is a Fast Five in the sense\nthat they have to be answered in one\nword to one sentence maximum but I\nalways ruin it because I'm so intrigued\nby my guests but I'll try so Elliot page\nthese are your final five the first\nquestion is what is the best advice\nyou've ever heard or received and it can\nbe about any topic you choose it to be\nabout you know what I don't know why\nthis is popping into my brain but\nthere's a memory popping in my brain so\nI'm like why not go with this and the\ntime in that period when everyone's sort\nof goto was your dream's coming true\nyour dream's coming true your dream's\ncoming true Kate Winslet said to me and\nI was still am obsessed with Kate\nWinslet love one of just my favorite\nactors of all time and I was too shy to\ngo up to her at this like party or\nsomething it would have been the first\ntime we met she just came up to me and\nwas like oops obviously I took me a long\ntime to listen to the advice properly\nbut she was just like don't let them\nchange you like\ndon't like you hold on to yourself\nessentially don't let this W and\nI'll never forget it who was I think the\nonly person in who that whole period\nbasically said anything like that you\nknow from that and I've always\nremembered it and it's always meant a\nlot to me I think that's a great answer\nand yeah what a beautiful statement\ndon't let them change you hold on to\nyourself that's that's beautiful okay\ngreat uh second question what is the\nworst advice you've ever heard or\nreceived sure this is easier yeah you\nknow don't be you know don't tell people\nyou're queer and disguise yourself to to\ntrick\nthem yeah even those words disguise\nyourself to trick them it's like yeah\nit's it's hard to live in a disguise and\nas a trick so which is just so silly too\nas if like so you're telling me lesbians\ndon't wear dress like what are we like\njust the whole binary aspect is just\nridiculous yeah what are we trying yeah\nso boring God question number three uh\nwhat is something you used to value that\nyou no longer\nvalue I think like a certain I idea or\nwhat we envision success to be you know\nthat's not really that important to me\nanymore yeah and that was clear from\nwhat you said earlier the idea that you\nwere willing to let it all go if you\nallowed to be who you are and be\nyourself totally yeah it's just like not\nwhat success means to me mhm uh question\nnumber\nfour what is something that you're\ncurrently trying to\nlearn guess still you know whatever\nshame still lingers that was projected\nonto me by those around me Society um\nobviously in a so much better place like\nso much of it's probably unconscious but\nas if it's not you know still lingering\nand\nstill disconnecting from those thoughts\nor feelings that make you feel\nsmall and fifth final question we ask\nthis to every guest who's ever been on\nthe show and I'm really intrigued to\nhear your answer if you could create one\nlaw that everyone in the world had to\nfollow what would it\nbe you can take your\ntime um that everybody had to follow\ndon't be a\nbully that's a good one bullying is\noutlawed yeah any type of bullying yeah\nyeah I think that's a good law yeah\nthere's a rule needs to become a\nlaw yeah I love it Elliot page everyone\nthe book is called page Boy A Memoir if\nyou haven't read it already highly\nrecommend it read it for your own\neducation share it with friends make\nyour next book club pick to be able to\ndiscuss it dissect it support the\ncommunities around you support your\nfriends

energy\nyour presence today like I said I I I\nwill take this experience around and\nshare with many people because it's an\nexperience that I've really felt deeply\nthrough your words and through your\npresence today and so often when I'm\nsitting in this chair the number one\nfeeling I'm having\nis I wish the world could feel what I'm\nfeeling right\nnow because so often I'm feeling If\npeople could understand the pain the\nhurt the trauma\nthat people like yourself are\nexperiencing and could experience your\nHumanity in the way that I'm\nexperiencing then maybe we wouldn't\ntreat each other that way then maybe we\nwouldn't speak to each other that way\nthat maybe we\nwouldn't impact each other in that\nnegative way I'm I'm really thankful I\ngot to spend this time with you and I\nreally hope that more and more people\nget to experience you through your book\nand through your work so\nthat they they too can understand more\nabout themselves and more about you so\nthank you so much thank you so much\nthank you really appreciate it thank you\nif you love this episode you'll enjoy my\nconversation with Megan Trainer on\nbreaking generational trauma and how to\nbe confident from the inside out my\ntherapist told me stand in the mirror\nnaked for 5 minutes it was already tough\nfor me to love my body but after the\nc-section scar with all the stretch\nmarks now I'm looking at myself like\nI've been hacked but day three when I\ndid it I was like you know what her\nthighs are cute"
