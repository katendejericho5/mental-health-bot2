kindly\nallowed my testimonial to be here so you\nknow how much I endorse this book I I\nrecommend a lot of books but this is a\nbook that I've realized I needed more in\nmy life because of how many people I\nhave in my life that are losing people\nthat they love and I now finally have\nthe book to encourage people to read and\nreceive in their life to know how to\nhonor the people they love uh please\nwelcome to on purpose Nicole event\nNicole thank you thank you for being\nhere beautiful introduction I'm very\nhonored thank you it's from the so happy\nto be here no Nicole I mean I mean what\nI said and I was just saying it to you a\nfew moments ago and I wanted to repeat\nit for my community I'm so grateful you\nwrote this book because honoring the\npeople that we love\nremembering what they taught us what we\ngained from them and then passing it on\nis without a doubt one of the greatest\nacts of service that we could possibly\never do not just to that individual but\nto humanity yes absolutely and I was so\ntouched not only by you sharing this\nwith me earlier when the writing process\nwas happening but you trusting me to be\na part of this journey with you because\nit's so deeply important to you and it's\nso deeply intimate and close to you and\nso I I couldn't be more thankful and\ngrateful so thank you so much well thank\nyou for taking the time while you were\non your book tour and I'm sending you\nfirst draft second draft Jay what do you\nthink about this and you took the time\nto read it and again that is a part of\nshowing up for people which I've been\ntalking about about this book of you\nknow my mom really her her superpower\nwas really showing up m for people and I\nthink we're all forgetting I think when\nwe all like things on Instagram and all\nthis that that's showing up for someone\nbut that's you know the icing of showing\nup but the cake of showing up of really\ntaking the time out for somebody whether\nyou feel like it or not whether you have\ntime or not but it's honoring somebody\nelse's Soul because not all of us are on\nthe same Soul Journey we're not all\ngoing through the same thing at the same\ntime and so I thank you for for giving\nme the encouragement to keep writing and\nand to finally get this book done\nabsolutely it feels great I know I'm so\nglad that we're finally here yes I know\nand Nicole I want to take a moment\nbefore I dive in I have so many\nquestions I want to ask you today and so\nso many questions I'm excited to ask you\nbut I want to say a big thank you\nbecause people show up in our lives in\ndifferent ways and towards the early\nstages of my career I was uh wonderfully\ninvited by Jennifer Aniston to her home\nto give a short present\nand you were in the audience that day it\nwas only a small group of people and we\ninstantly connected and I remember your\nenthusiasm for my work and your energy\nfor my work was so reassuring you showed\nup for me without even knowing it maybe\nbut it was so beautiful to have such a\nreal interaction you know you can have\npeople say that was wonderful that was\nnice but when when you were sharing your\nthoughts and your feedback and the\nenergy I felt from your words was so\ndeeply encouraging when I probably\nneeded them most so I just want to thank\nyou for showing up I'm happy to hear\nthat I remember I remember sitting where\nI remember exactly where I was sitting\nand then standing and I remember\naffirming you the whole time like\nnodding up and down because that was it\nwas a small group but it was an\nintimidating group of people to be in\nfront of and you were fantastic and what\nI thought in that moment was finally\nsomebody's really coming out and talking\nabout the human Spirit and the soul and\nour energy and who we really are as\npeople as just not what we do but who we\nare and I think that conversation has\nbeen missing in society and I was so\nhappy that it was you and I thought it\nwas perfect I said this is exactly what\nwe need and I was not surprised by\neverything that has happened for you I\nsaid of course it's happened you know\nand even my husband Ted when I told him\nI was coming on the podcast he said\nisn't it phenomenal think about it how\nyou started this journey with Jay before\nhe even put out anything and look at him\nI mean you're all over the world you're\nhelping heal people you're helping Souls\nrepair which I think a lot of us forget\nthat our souls on our soul Journey are\ngoing to need to go into repair\nsometimes and none of us want to go into\nrepair but there's no way you're going\nto be on the earth and not have to go\ninto repair some sometimes we just you\nknow we just do like and I say to people\nhow are you doing after this I'm in\nrepair I I'm in repair I am allowing my\nfriends to heal me life to heal me\ncircumstances to heal me but I am in\nrepair we have to make it okay to be\nable to say and own I'm in repair I'm\nstill going to show up mhm but I'm in\nrepair what a beautifully beautiful way\nof putting it Nicole I want to dive in\nand I want to start by asking you what\nis is your\nearliest childhood memory or your most\nmemorable experience as a child that you\nthink is defined who you are today h\nwell there's a couple of things uh one\nmy mom was very open to various\nscriptures around the world so it didn't\nmatter if it was a Hindu scripture or\nBuddhist scripture whatever it was\nChristian script she loved the idea of\nunderstanding energy your thoughts your\nwords and everything how it helps create\nand shape your reality and I remember\nspecifically there was one time my\ngodfather Quincy gave me a book and it\nwas called creative visualization now\ngranted I was older at this time I\nwasn't a child but I'm just going to\nthis right now is that it it was\neverything my mom had said but I found\nit on paper and someone was saying no\nand then I started doing it I started\nokay if I really say this all the time\nthis is going to happen but I did notice\nmy energy shift and I did start to\nunderstand how the universe works know\nwe can't control every single situation\nwe are in control of you know how we\nrespond to it but I think one of the\nearliest things that I learned the most\nimportant life lesson was that we are\nall here to share our blessings I\nlearned that firsthand as a young child\nto realize with all these people yes\nthey might have been very successful and\nvery famous but the difference with the\ngroup that I had was that it was never\nabout them MH it was always about how\nare we going to move people forward we\nhave this door that has been open for us\nand our job is to make sure we keep the\ndoor open for other people and the power\nthat I got from that was there is such a\npower in helping people get to where\nthey want to be help them on their soul\nEvolution and that has to do with being\nunselfish mhm and aware and focused on\nprogress moving energy forward and not\nstaying stagnant and not feeling that oh\nif Jay gets this or so and so gets this\nthen I'm going to get nothing no I it's\nthere is the lesson I learned was there\nis enough to go around for everybody\nbecause everybody is on a different soul\npath and everybody has their own mission\nno one can take it away from any of us\nno one they can try to come in and steer\nyou off course but J shett is J shett in\nthis lifetime there is no other jete\nthere is no other Nicole Avon there\nthere's one of all of us and we get to\ndo what we choose to do and who we want\nto be is even more important than what\nwe do but who we want to be on this\nplanet who what do we want people to say\ncuz believe me the another thing I've\nlearned now after my parents have gone\nis you know everyone says you know you\ndon't take anything with you we know\nthat Technic but when you really see it\nI have everything everything's still\nthere my parents didn't take one\npossession with them but the beauty is\nis that everybody they left their\ncharacter they left their stamp on\nHumanity people smile when they hear\ntheir names people say thank you people\nwrite me letters about how they changed\ntheir lives so all of this comes into\nthe lesson that I learned is that\neveryone's significant\nand everyone's energy can help each\nother move to where we need to\nbe yeah those famous words again which\nwe've heard many times but you've\nexperienced this and and you feel it and\nI want to talk about some of the\nhonoring that you received for your\nparents but Maya Angelou who said that\npeople will forget what you did people\nwill forget what you said but people\nwill never forget how you made them feel\n100% And we say this we repeat it you\nsee it on Instagram but then you've\nprobably experienced that very deeply\nthat people have not forgotten how your\nparents made them feel that's exactly it\nhow they made them feel and it's through\nthe small actions it's the note it's the\nphone call it's the text it's the email\nI'm checking in on you I want you to\nknow I love you I've been thinking about\nyou these are all things that I've had\nto relearn of oh this is important it's\nnot just about me and my feelings and\nwhat I'm going through\nI have people that I'm on my journey\nwith that need check-ins that I need to\nsay hey I'm just thinking about you I\nknow you're you're traveling and I know\nyou you know things are going well in\nyour life but I just wanted you to know\nI'm thinking about you those little\nthings mean everything they mean\neverything because you're not alone and\nand you want to feel as if you are\nimportant to somebody you want to feel\nthat you're significant you want to feel\nthat you're seen you know you want to\nfeel that someone you want to you that\nfeeling of being loved mhm changes\neverything yeah that's what we're\nyearning for all of us for everyone who\ndoesn't know I'd love to give them the\nthe background so we can really go deep\ninto this conversation you start this\nbook by and I'm reading from the book\nyou receive this news love you've got to\nget up get dressed and get the seeders\nyour mom's been shot I\nmean every time I read that line as\nsomeone who didn't know your family\nevery time I read that line I\njust only could put myself in those\nshoes to even try to imagine what that\nwould feel like to hear don't have you\nyou can't you can't it's something that\nyou've either been through you haven't\nand so you can't fully empathize you\ncan't fully understand you can't no\nmatter how hard you try I cannot imagine\nhow difficult that is walk us through\nthat moment so that our audience can\ncome with you on this journey\nextrapolated off it so my husband had\ncalled me it was early in the morning\naround\n2:30 and my phone had been ringing and I\ndidn't hear it my brother had been\ncalling and I and then you know how the\nyour intuition gets you up something\ntold me to get up and I just happen to\nroll over I looked at my phone I see all\nthese Miss calls from Alex and thank God\nmy I was looking at my phone because my\nhusband called again and Teddy said\nthose words love I'm so sorry you have\nto get up I said what's going on he goes\nyou have to get up your mother's has\nbeen shot you have to get to seed her\nsomething what do you mean she's been\nshot what are you talking about so then\nI'm thinking oh it must be 8:00 at night\nI was so it from that moment I went into\na whole different sphere almost I I\ndidn't just know where I was and I said\nwhat are you talking about where was she\nand I was asking Teddy all these\nquestions and he said Nicole you have to\nget to the hospital I don't have any\nanswers I just got this call I'll meet\nyou there and thank God he was in Los\nAngeles he was on a work retreat but he\nwasn't far Jay I froze my knees buckled\na little bit and then my heart rate just\nstarts going and I'm thinking wait what\nand I remember you know our dog sleep in\nthe room I'm looking at these two sweet\nsouls and and you know dogs pick up on\neverything so they immediately jump on\nme kissing me licking me and I just\nremember getting dressed quickly getting\ndog food out feeding the dogs leaving\nthe door open for them going out the\nback my my life changed I knew whatever\nthe outcome was at the hospital that my\nlife had changed forever that if my mom\nsurvived this which I was praying for\nthat she was 81 when this\nhappened that okay this is so traumatic\nthat I don't know if she's going to be\nable to function emotionally after this\nor anything so I'm driving and I'm on my\nway to the hospital and I'm you know\neverything's energy to me and I have all\ngreen lights and the last one I remember\nI was was turning right on San vente and\nit started flickering MH and I just\nstarted for myself I just started\ntalking I said mom Mom if you can hear\nme I don't know what's happened I know\nyou've been shot I don't know by whom I\ndon't know where I don't know anything\nbut I'm on my way and I don't know how\nhard you're fighting or what happened\nbut you don't have to come back if you\ncan't you know I just it all these\nthoughts just and I and I remember\nsaying I'll take I'll I'll take care of\nDad I'll take care of\neverything I I think I was saying that\nJay because I she always did that for\neverybody else and so there was just\nthis new energy flowing through me and I\ndon't even know what I was talking about\nbut it was keeping me sane because I had\nto you know I could I didn't know where\nto park I was in the wrong building I\nwas so discombobulated I didn't know\nwhat was happening and then you know I\ngot to the hospital and I was with my\nfamily and we waited and unfortunately I\nmean God bless her she was 81 you know\nsomebody had broken into her house and\nshe happened to be up so she they\nencountered each other completely\nopposite Souls completely but she made\nit to the hospital which I love about my\nmother of course she did shot in the\nback you know with a rifle and she M 81\nand makes it to the hospital and she\njust didn't make it through surgery\neverything that I had known for 53 years\nwas just I felt that it was just pulled\nout from under me but then I became her\nI decided okay I'm what would Jackie do\nyou know and I started delegating that's\nI went into that mode but the shock and\nthe trauma and the stress and the fear I\nmean I have there were veins I didn't\neven know I had because they were all\nit's just it's amazing with the body how\nit responds to trauma and then I just\ndecided that day okay I have to decide\nwho I want to be in this moment versus\nwhat I want to do because I kept saying\nokay I'm gonna do this I have to do this\nI'm gonna do this\nand then I looked at myself in the\nmirror when I got home from the hospital\nand I said no no no Nicole who do you\nwant to be in this time in this trial\nbecause now here's a trial and this\ntrial is here who do you want to be and\nI just looked at myself and I said okay\nI want to be as courageous as possible I\nwant to be as peaceful as possible and I\nwant to be as helpful as possible and I\njust went downstairs as that woman\ntended to my father you know the police\nofficers were at the house Detectives at\nthe house I I he was like out of like a\nCSI you know TV show I'm like oh my\ngoodness you know how we all say one day\nat a time mhm I tried that I was like\nthis is not one day at a time this is\none minute at a time this is okay Nicole\nevery five minutes you're going to check\nin on yourself let's just and so I knew\nI can get through one minute at a time\nor five minutes at a time but when I\nsaid tomorrow I'll be better my whole\nbody was like no no no I'm not going to\nWe Can't Live till tomorrow wow that's\nhow heavy the pain was wow it was too\nmuch shock it was an energy that I never\nexperienced before cuz it was such a\ncruel energy on such a deep level and a\nviolent energy that I had never\nexperienced it so I found myself in new\nterritory I've never heard it put that\nwell in terms of how heavy it can be and\nthis idea that we say one day at a\ntime\nI really hope that anyone and everyone\nwho's listening right now who is going\nthrough their own version their their\nown path of this sort of pain is able to\nsimplify it to one minute at a time one\nmoment at a time so I I already deeply\nappreciate that how do you think you\nhad this ability and I'm I'm assuming or\nguessing that it also came from your mom\nthat you could go upstairs and say I'm\ngoing to be courageous I want to be\npeaceful I want to be helpful like those\nthree words are not accidental they are\nvery intentional powerful special words\ncourageous peaceful and\nhelpful how did you find that Clarity so\nquickly which could have taken months or\neven years thank God it was my mom it\nshe my mom was a big believer in in\nvibration and she'd always used to say\nyou know your your soul emits energy and\nyou you have to think of yourself as a\nradio tower and you have to think of\nyourself as a you know as a station on\nthe radio or a channel on the TV because\nyou know as long as you change the\nchannels you'll get different vibrations\nwe all see that so what are you tuning\ninto she'd always say to me what are you\ntuning into in your mind what are you\ntuning into but she thought those those\nthree words are from her she always\nwanted to be courageous and helpful and\nkind and those were always her\nintentions of how she was going to show\nup in the world and it's interesting\nbecause she used to say to me courage is\nisn't not being afraid it's being afraid\nand you do it anyway you do it anyway\nyou do the thing you're afraid of while\nyou're afraid and that's when you're\ncourageous and and it's so true so I\njust decided okay I I don't I have no\nidea what's happening and I'm very\nafraid but I'm not going to turn my back\nto it I'm going to go through it I'm not\ngoing to have necessarily get through\nthis I never put that pressure but I am\ngoing to walk through this season I am\ngoing to walk through this challenge\nwith as much grace as possible to the\nbest of your ability and thank you so\nmuch for recounting that for our\naudience and of course as I've said to\neveryone I highly recommend you get this\nbook because not only is it of course\nNicole's story I feel what Nicole does\nexceptionally well is through and you\ncan tell already from the way she speaks\nand and for those of you are listening\nand watching Nicole you have this way of\nbringing us on this journey with you but\nalso giving us these\nsteps and insights along the way of how\nto honor people that we love how to\nlearn from them how to just what you\njust said now like I think this idea of\nbecoming and\nbeing the people we\nlose is the most beautiful way for them\nto continue to live with us and through\nus and live on yeah I listened to part\nof another healing step for me was\nlistening to her favorite music every\nday I thought okay what did Mom mom love\nwhat music did she love what flowers did\nshe love anything that she loved I put\naround me if I could so the orchids that\nshe loved the certain color that she\nloved I ordered them and made sure I\nlooked at them every day because when I\nlooked at them it reminded me of her and\nI smiled and it helped heal my heart you\nknow and listening to the music because\nmusic was so healing and it is so\nhealing and so I listen to all her you\nknow she loved Johnny matys and she\nloved the commodor and the beees and she\nloved really eat like Gordon light F she\nloved really easy kind\nmusic and it did help me become more of\nher it was really helpful and a lot of\nrituals you know she loved taking baths\nmy mom love that and my mom was always\nget the Magnesium get the salt and get\nwhatever it doesn't have to be fancy get\nin the water you know she was such a\nPisces and I'm born on her birthday so\nshe was always you know take a bath so\nit out you know talking and I started\ndoing those things so at night I I would\ntake a bath and and I started to talk to\nher as if she was there as if I could\nhear her even if I couldn't I didn't\nneed to hear anything and it wasn't even\nabout so much feeling anything but I\nneeded to express\nmyself and it was very healing for me to\nact as if she was listening and that she\ncould hear me whether she could or not\nit was the act of doing for myself mhm\nwhich was very healing that's so\nreassuring to hear I was speaking to a\nfriend the other day about their loss\nand they lost a parent very recently MH\nand I recommended your book because I\nreally really do believe that is my\ngo-to recommendation when when people\nhave this experience and they were\ntalking to me they said you know if my\nmom was here right now she'd laugh at\nthis and she'd do this and I was like\nthat's it I was like you know it and\nit's wonderful hearing it from you like\nI was like that's it like you know how\nyour mom would respond to what you would\nsay or what you would do like you know\nthat when you love someone so deeply and\nso that doesn't have to\ndisappear never it doesn't have to stop\nno it does not that's a really good\npoint it does not have to stop it\nchanges\nform the energy changes form but the\nenergy is there my you know we're\nspirits in the material world so if\nwe're spirits in the material world and\nevery everything is Everlasting and the\nsoul never dies and we all know that if\nyou believe that then yeah she's in a\ndifferent form but she's still around\nand her energy is with me I feel her now\nstronger than I ever did before I really\ndo I I I really feel her presence much\nstronger and even writing the book cuz\nyou know she wanted to be a book editor\nand there were certain drafts I was\ndoing and I just put the pen down and\nthere and there was one night and I had\na dream and it was I just saw her red\nnails typing on the typewriter and I had\nasked myself before I went to sleep I\nwonder if I should change that paragraph\nrewrite it and move it up and it's I\ntook it as a sign which I did and I did\nmove the paragraph but as soon as I saw\nher nails her fingernails on the the\nkeypad I went thank you Mom I'm going to\nmove that thank you for editing you're\nstill editing in my life you are still\nworking and it's just a different form\nof energy and my girlfriend wrote me a\nbeautiful letter and she said\nRemember the best way to honor anyone\nyou've loved but especially your\nparents is to live a full significant\nlife you owe them a\nlife that that that's the only thing you\nowe them is is to live because that is\nthe best way to honor them is if they've\ntaught you great things and given you\ngreat lessons and given you\ntools go on and carry the Baton and even\nfor the ones who don't let's say you\ndon't have parents that were good to you\nbecause there that happens and you don't\nhave parents that show up for you you\ncan choose to be different than they\nwere and show up as a completely\ndifferent type of human being in the\nworld I've seen it you've seen it I've\nseen I've heard about I've heard\nhorrific stories about abuse and and\nTrauma and neglect and these young\npeople have chosen to be very different\nfrom what they receed reive from their\nparents and I have such respect for that\nbecause that's hard MH it's hard to\ncarry on a memory if your memories are\nterrible and when that happens then your\njob now is to I have to create new\nmemories yes yeah people by their\nactions are either showing us how to\nlive or how not to live or how not to\nlive and oh yeah I can definitely\nidentify with that with the home I grew\nup in I was just taking notes my whole\nlife of how not to be a dad how not to\nbe a husband how not to be a person in\nthe workplace how not to be a family\nmember especially in the workplace I\nmean yeah I had I had people around me\nall the time where I would say o okay so\nwhen I when I'm older and I'm working\nand I have this position I'm definitely\nnot going to be like that and then there\nwere certain people where I'd take notes\nand I'd say I want to be just like Carol\nshe's great she's so helpful she's so\npatient she's so you know and then\nserving I mean I was a waitress for a\nlong time my parents had me work you\nknow since I was 10 and 13 and and just\non and on and on I sold shoes I worked\nat a dry cleaner I did the my mom would\nsay I'm throwing you into these\nexperiences because to your point people\nwill show you who they are and you can\nlearn how you want to be but the only\nway you do that is when you're in\ninteraction with others and gosh you're\nspecially serving people you see the I\nsaw the best of people and I saw the\nworst of people I was either\ncompletely just\nnon-existent or somebody took the time\nto be really kind and smile at me and\nask me how I was and so you become very\nsensitive to it yeah you know and Tony\nand Sarah you know my my step kids with\nTed they they're the same Sarah I threw\nher into waitressing and she said my\ngosh some people don't even see me I'm\nnobody to them and I said now you know\nand now she's very sensitive as a young\nadult when we go to restaurants did you\nmake sure you tip this did you make sure\nI mean she looks at the waitress waiters\nall the time she looks at every server\nhow are you how is your day how are you\nI mean she's so engaged but to your\npoint because she's experienced the\nopposite and she took notes I don't want\nto be like that yeah so beautiful I was\nuh reminded as you were talking about\nyou said this beautiful statement of you\nknow we're we're spirits in the material\nworld having this experience and\ntherefore energy lives up on and there's\nthis beautiful message that you receive\nyou say I'm reading from your book if\nyou don't mind if that's okay so this is\npage 53 for those who are reading along\nwith us and think you'll be happy and\nyou say a few days after my mother died\nFel Williams called he's like a brother\nto me his\nfamily and he says we're going to\ncelebrate your mom he said we're going\nto celebrate her Legacy she's a big deal\nand we're not going to let anyone forget\nher she created a life worth talking\nabout do you realize that hundreds of\nthousands of babies were born around the\nworld the day she passed over there are\n140 million a year all around the world\nlife is always continuing Nicole and you\nmust continue her life by living yours\nto the fullest and he concluded God is\nstill the\ngreatest and you said that FOH says this\nall the time through good or bad times\nand he's right God is still the greatest\nwhat I find really unique unque about\nyour journey Nicole as well is that you\nare able to keep and strengthen your\nfaith in your own spirituality in the\nway you practice it at a time when it's\nvery\nnatural and I would never judge anyone\nif it would actually Veer them away\nright and just say no no exactly yeah\nmean yeah what do you mean what are you\ntalking about I've been so good and I've\nhad so much faith and how can this\nhappen you know and as I say in the book\nit's like why not us it tragedy and\ntrials and everything it happens to you\nknow as it says in scripture you know it\nrains on the just and it rains on the\nunjust it's everyone kind of gets\nhammered but it goes to the power of\nchoice for me and the reason that I grew\nstronger in my faith as opposed to\nleaving it is because I really do\nbelieve that the Universe has kind of\nlaid it all out life has laid it out\nvarious scripture you know your Buddhist\nscript everything is laid it out which\nsays here it is you're on this Earth and\nkind of here here's how you play this\ngame but these things we're not going to\nlie these things will show up but the\npower of Free Will which my mom always\nreminded me about of is that you know\nlisten we as human beings do have free\nwill we have we have the freedom to\nchoose how we're going to live choose\nhow we're going to think as opposed to\nany other animal you know they they\ndon't have the power of imagination and\nchoice we do so to blame the cre creator\nfor the choices that people make is not\nsomething that I wanted to subscribe to\nI was like I'm not even going there\npeople make choices all the time I I see\nit every day we all do people who' have\nhad the worst childhoods make great\nchoices have great lives I've seen\npeople who I grew up with in a very\naffluent neighborhood make the worst\nchoices and it had nothing to do with\ntheir environment it was their choice so\nI wanted to stay my faith for me really\nwas believing in something that is so\nmuch bigger and greater than me that you\nknow swing you know the stars come out\nat night I'm not in control of that the\nEarth is spinning H that's not my power\nyou know the birds wake up every morning\nthe Sun is up the sun goes down that's a\npower that is I yes I'm a part of that\nand I'm connected to it but I did I'm\nnot the Creator and so I just decided to\nto lean in\nmore with that power and just\nsay Okay I accept this I don't\nunderstand it I may never understand it\nbut I still do love life and I still do\nbelieve in life and the goodness of\npeople and the goodness of life and I\ndon't want to get bitter that was my M\nJay I was so afraid of becoming a bitter\nperson and I could feel the roote I\ncould feel I could feel it starting and\nI was like no no no no I got to get rid\nof this I I and that's where I just went\ninto the Forgiveness of not condoning\nthe behavior not uh saying oh it's okay\nthat this happened or making an excuse\nforgiveness for me was I am casting this\nburden or these burdens of anger and\nshame and doubt and disappointment and\nfrustration and fury cuz I was furious\nand I thought but if I hold on to these\nfeelings I'm going to sink myself mhm\nand I'm not giving anyone the power to\ntake me out no I'm not doing that so I'm\ngoing to stand in my faith I'm going to\nbelieve in what I believe in I'm going\nto believe in life and I am going to I\nchoose to believe that things will get\nbetter I don't know when and I don't\nknow how I didn't care but I knew that\nthey would and I believe and I'm a big\nbeliever in tomorrow I love tomorrow I\ndo I really do I'm always thinking okay\nbecause if I don't get it right I'm like\noh there's always tomorrow and it keeps\nme hopeful tomorrow keeps me hopeful I\ndon't try to stay out of the present but\nI do look forward you know my mom always\nused to say you have to have something\nto look forward to because otherwise you\nif if you don't train your mind to and\nI'd say well I have nothing coming up\nthat I'm looking forward to and she used\nto say make it up make it up pretend you\nhave some party go pretend you have some\nwhatever it is that's something that's\ngoing to make your heart smile because\nwe can all fall into despair very\nquickly I I love that that is brought a\nmassive smile to my face it's so\nbeautiful how how someone's energy in\nspirit can be so big that it can you\nknow truly live on and and truly truly\nbe F and shared it's yeah there's this\nbeautiful line that you share uh from\nyour friend Penny who says grief is the\nreceipt from the universe showing that\nyou loved someone or something and love\nthem very deeply it's not the best when\nshe reminded me of that I said okay wait\nsay it again I have to write this down\nsay it again that is so good yeah but\nshe said baby that's what it is it's a\nreceipt and it it could be a mother a\nfather a sister a brother a dog cat\nwhatever something that you love that is\nno longer there that has changed form\neven if it's the most peaceful\ntransition the grief is proof that you\nloved you know the grief is most of the\ntime and there's a lot of grief also\nwhere there's regrets and all that I\nunderstand that I and I respect all\nforms of grief but it is it's a receipt\nyeah a receipt that you loved and you\nwere loved and I was loved yeah deeply\ndeeply this one line in the book you\nreally I just felt it was perspective\nshifting in a way that oh I just I just\nfeel like that statement just like you\nknow you just embodied and captured\neverything and you said that even though\nyour mother's death was shocking her\nlife was beautiful so imagine even\nthough the end was so terrible her life\nwas beautiful and that's what you're\ncelebrating that's what you're putting\nemphasis and focus and your light on and\nI find that's very difficult because\nwhen we lose someone it's so easy and\nnatural again and normal and that's when\nit's normal for us to obsess over how we\nlost someone and how we left them which\nis the shortest amount of time we\nactually experience the most mostly but\nwe have all of this time but the brain\nand our memory and our mind is so good\nat just fixating on the end the end and\nnot the life yeah was yeah and not the\nlife and I I had to get to the end so I\nused to say but but but and then I\nrealized wait I can have both this is\nshocking and terrible and hurtful and\nI'm going to celebrate her life and I'm\ngoing to think of the good times and I'm\ngoing to try and think of all the great\nmemories that'll bring a smile to my\nface so it was no longer a butt and once\nI changed butt to and I didn't have to\nchoose which one I was going to do both\nand move through life with the shock and\nthe trauma and the stress and the beauty\nof her life the beauty of how she lived\nthe energy of what she gave so I was I\nwas moving with all energies and it was\nonly until I shifted because I was\ndefinitely in the but this happened so I\ndon't know how I could ever smile again\nbut this happened and it was so tragic\nand then as soon as I said this happened\nand it's tragic and I'm going to think\npositively I'm going to think\nconstructively you know my dad always\nused to say to me girl keep your mind\nright keep your mind right crucify your\nmind every day you got to keep your mind\nright and so that really helped me you\nknow and that my friend uh TD Jakes had\ncalled me and he said I understand\nyou're angry of course it's normal to be\nangry and all the things you're feeling\nbut I have a question for you do you\nwant your focus to be on her last five\nminutes or are you going to focus on the\n81 years that she lived and it's your\nchoice and you have to choose every day\nwhich one are you going to focus on you\ngoing to give him five minutes the five\nminutes and the trauma or are you going\nto focus on the 81 years and I remember\nthrough all my tears like the 81 years\nthe 881 years and it was but it was\nbeautiful because he helped me shift and\nI had to go to that every day it wasn't\nlike he said it one day and then but\nevery day and every time it was very\nchallenging for me Jay and every time I\ndid want to quit and there were days\nwhere I didn't stop all the time but you\nsometimes you have to push Paws in life\nand there were days where I would lay in\nthe bed and just lay there and be still\nand think or not think and just lay\nthere and I but I still\ndecided to focus on her 81 years and to\nfocus on what I loved about her and to\nfocus on her contributions to life and\nsociety and other people and how she\nmade people feel so powerful that shift\nfor me was you know I was like that I\ncan that's something I'd like to remind\nmyself every day with the with the\npeople that I've lost like that that\nreally felt like a real gift that that\nGem of advice and insight thank you you\nknow again another natural\nthing is especially in a circumstance\nlike this is to focus on how to get\nJustice on you know how to make sure\nthat the perpetrator and the person gets\nwhat they deserve and are found and like\nthey and that that again is a very\nnormal reaction it makes sense how did\nyou navigate that at the same time as\nnavigating grief like walk me through\nthat because sometimes we lose people\nnaturally this wasn't that this was you\nknow so it's an additional kind of\nenergy Direction because here you are\ndealing with loss but then you're also\ndealing with an individual who's you\nknow acted so recklessly yes and I\nthought oh my God and my my father broke\nmy heart one day because he said oh boy\nbecause they hadn't caught him yet and\nhe said and then he was curious about\nthat obviously and like wondering oh my\nGod is this person still around and my\ndad immediately went to other people he\nwasn't just focused on my mom he\nimmediately went to oh my gosh I hope\nthis person is not hurting somebody else\nbecause he's obviously shown he he can\ndo this he does this but I still I had\nto present on behalf of my mom and the\nfamily to the judge you know what my\nintention was and it really was listen\nyou know whatever the Divine Justice is\ngoing to be in this I'm not the Divine\nJustice here but I will say that my\nintention was I want to make sure that\nthis doesn't happen to another family I\ndon't want this to happen to anyone one\nelse I don't want other people to feel\nthat so if I have any little way of just\nstating that and making a difference\nthat gave me something to live for\nactually can I try in my little square\ncan I hopefully stop this from happening\nto other people and thank God that that\nhe's not on the streets you know because\nthere's a lot of Reckless people on the\nstreets and and a lot of violence today\nin various different forms and it's\nreally heavy and it's so\nunnecessary and it's um cruel and unkind\nand and but I like it's Reckless yeah\nit's I mean it's horrific it's horrific\nand Reckless and but it happens to so\nmany people in so many different ways\nand I don't think people realize you\nknow what it you we see the science of\nwhat it does to families when there's a\ntragedy it could be a child drowning or\na car accident or anything\nand families sometimes fall apart and I\nunderstand why and Ted and I had to look\nat each other and I I sat with my dad\nand I said listen you're going to come\nlive with me I'm never leaving you we're\ngoing to be locked up you're going to be\nmy road dog wherever I go you're in the\ncar with me whatever my life is we're\njust going to\nmerge but I had to sit with Ted and I\nhad to say to him we had to look at each\nother in the eyes I said\nlisten this is horrible\nand both of us are grieving in very\ndifferent ways but we have to make a\ndecision and look at each other in the\neyes right now and make a commitment to\neach other that we're going to walk\nthrough this and no matter how hard this\ngets and no matter if any each of us\nwant to bail we I'd UND but we're not\ngoing to we're going to stick this out\nI've got your back you've got my back\nwe're going to be here take care of my\nfather and my intention was we're going\nto give him a space where he feels loved\nand honored and safe and\nseen and if we can do that then we've\ndone our job but we have to have a\ncommitment because the pain is so deep\nJay and I I see it now I used to read\narticles like why would they they had a\nbaby and I understand this tragedy but\nwhy would they divorce after that why\nwould they oh I get it yeah until you go\nthrough it I get it because the shock is\nso insan\nit's your brain isn't the same your\nheart's not the same your brain's not\nthe same yeah and and and that's another\nreminder to us all where it's like if we\nhaven't been through a experience how\nnot to judge how to take a step back how\nto be compassionate but when I hear you\nbeing able to take a step back to the\npoint of view of saying I want to look\nat this from the point of view of how\nthis will not happen to someone else\nthat's like Model Behavior I mean that\nthat is that is such an elevated\nspiritual space to come from that you're\nnot going I think this person deserves\nthis because of what happened to this no\nwhich would be fair like that would be\ntotally fair there'd be nothing wrong\nwith if you fell that way but the fact\nthat you could come from a place to say\nactually I just want to make sure it\ndoesn't happen to anyone else again and\nand I believe actually after the\nunfortunate event at your home like he\nwent off and did did more that same day\nlike 40 minutes later so you were very\nright to actually have that feeling yes\nthat news was crazy and so one of my\nfriends Amy who's in the book she's the\none who went to the house and got my\nmom's things for me and got the Bible\nfound the Christmas card all these\nthings Amy shows up at the house that\nafternoon and she says I am so sorry I'm\nlate I heard about your mom this morning\nbut we were woken up last night by\nhelicopters and Sirens right next door\nto my house there was a home\ninvasion and it was craziness and the\nguy shot himself and there was Madness\nand blah blah blah and we were all out\nin the streets she's going on on on and\nI said really she goes can you believe\nin the same night it happened to your\nmom she comes over 24 hours later white\nas a ghost eyes wide open and I said\nwhat's going on she said uh remember I\ntold you that there was a home invasion\nnext door to me and I said yes she said\nthat was the same\nperson that was the same person that\nleft your mom and showed up right next\ndoor to a best friend just that out of\nall places out La is pretty big out of\nall things but the energy and the\nconnection and and interesting love I\nhad this huge Crystal that I had bought\nfrom myself and I couldn't figure out\nthe right place to put it and it\nhappened to be Amy's birthday coming up\nand I was on the phone with my mom it\nwas months before she died maybe six\nmonths before she died and I said I\ndon't know what to do with this Crystal\nit's so gorgeous but I don't have the\nright room and Ted's like what are you\ndoing with that big thing\nand she saidwell didn't you say you\ndidn't know what to get Amy for her\nbirthday why don't she give that to Amy\nI said oh I absolutely will and of\ncourse she had put it right in her\nbackyard on the fence\nline of where all this so Amy just felt\nmy mom everywhere it's just but again of\nhow we're all connected and you don't\neven realize that out of all places but\nyeah he did this to someone else and\nthat family was traumatized there was a\nyoung girl in the house so I think that\nalso helped me knowing that story mhm\nknowing that there was a teenage girl in\nthe house and she was petrified and all\nthis and thank God nothing happened to\nthem but that it is about other people\ntoo that this didn't just happen to us\nmhm that's why I went to the place\nof okay there's so much trauma here my\nprayer is that it doesn't go any further\nyou know I'm I'm listening to you and\nobviously I read the book and I'm\nhearing just it's almost like your mind\nyou allowed your mind to naturally go to\nall of the\nthe buts MH but then you've found like\nthat tiny crack of light and that\nbreakthrough and you've kind of found\nyour way there and and I for everyone\nwho's listening I can see Nicole nodding\nand it's like that that feeling that we\noften have is like the the amount of\nlight that's shining through is so small\nlike the Teeny right like the tiniest a\nlittle nail like a little head of a oh\nyeah yeah it's not because it just looks\ndark and you know one of the biggest\nones that I think a lot of people Again\nNaturally feel are\nwhy me I could have done this I should\nhave been there like that can just you\nknow I've heard that like destroy people\ninside I was just going to use that word\nit will destroy you yeah it will destroy\nyou and I felt it you could feel the\ndestruction in your what did you dotion\nI immediately said you know why not me\nfirst I was like okay we're human we're\nin a human experience and bad things\nhappen around the world to really good\npeople all the time bad things happen to\nbad it's everybody right you know it's\nfun my mom used to she loved the theater\nshe loved stories she loved film\ntelevision and song also because her\npoint was each of these\nmediums most of them especially film and\ntelion is showing you the hero's journey\nyou are the hero of your story but you\ndon't go to the movie because you know\nthe ending we all go and we pretty much\nknow the ending in the trailer but we go\ncuz we want to see the middle which is\nthe challenge which is the butt which is\nwhat do I do am I going to survive the\ndecision the Turning Point the\npivot so the pivot for me was everything\nbecause I thought right mom told me this\nlike things happen people make decisions\nevery day you know you've got laws on\nthe books now you know Mothers Against\nDrunk Driving all these things but that\nhappened those good things came from a\nvery tragic place and it is looking for\nthe light at the end of the tunnel it's\nreally grasping\nfor that light looking even if it's\nteeny I was looking around like it's got\nto be there somewhere and some days I\ndidn't see any light I have to be honest\nthere were some days there was no light\nI felt it but I didn't see it but there\nwere some days where I just was sitting\nin darkness and sitting I felt like I\nwas sitting in mud and just or quicksand\nand it just was heavy and those were the\ndays that I thought okay I've Got to Now\npurposely look for a little light and I\nwould go outside and I'd sit in my yard\nand I would stare at the flower I would\nsit in nature and I would look at the\ntrees and I would watch the birds and I\nwould watch life I would watch the\nsunsets every day I never looked at him\nevery day I took advantage I took that\nfor granted oh there's a sunset all you\nknow a couple times a year oh every day\nsince my mom I would watch the sun go\ndown I would make sure to watch that sun\ngo down because it reminded you there is\na cycle of life and the sun's going to\nrise again and if I knew the Sun was\ngoing to rise again then I knew I was\ngoing to rise again you know the more\ndisconnected we've become from nature\nthe harder it is to acknowledge the\nnatural Transitions and the natural\nrejuvenations the seasons the the\nability for things to wither and then\nyeah and then come back come back and\nand my mom died you know in the it was\nWinter it was December 1st and I\nremember I just trimmed back everything\nand pruned everything and everything was\nBarren and then I remember in April\neverything that I had cut back\neverything was re blooming showing up\nagain gorgeous and it had pushed\nthrough that it was that Harvest Time\nyou know there's seed time and there's\nHarvest and there's this growing time\nand I understood Growing Pains that's\nwhat I was like oh this is what growing\npains oh this is what this means okay\nbut nature helped because the seasons\nhelped me CU like I said it was rainy\nand it was dark when she passed and then\na few months later the sun was coming\nout the the weather had changed the\nflowers were out the hummingbirds were\naround and it was a reminder of this two\nshall P like things will continue and\nyou have to go on with life yeah and and\nof course while you were writing this\nbook I believe it was when it went to\nprint you also lost your father at that\ntime and he knew you were writing the\nbook he he was reading was he yes he was\ninto it he was great he was pushing me\nto write because he knew it would be\ncathartic for me and I said Daddy I've\nbeen writing this book but mommy's died\nso I'm going to put this away goes no no\nno I want you to write about Jackie I\nwant you to write about life I want you\nto write Nicole and he was so I was so\nhappy to have his presence in my home\nbecause yes I was taking care of him but\nhe was really taking care of me too and\nTed Like like you would just acknowledg\nhe had just lost his father so to have a\npatriarch back in the house when Ted is\ngrieving the loss of his own father to\nhave my father's energy was great and my\ndad was a real doer I mean he was always\nmoving and shaking and and getting\nthings done he never really sat down\nnever really relaxed and he said to me\nyou have things to say in this book and\nyou'll help people hopefully you know\nand he what I loved he's like this this\nbook is about an being an offering it's\nnot about business right now this is an\noffering Nicole write your book finish\nyour book your mother would want you to\nfinish the book I said I know but I\ndon't know how to Pivot this he goes\nyou'll figure it out you could throw\nJackie in there but he did read it and\nhe read five chapters for sure and then\nhe said he flipped through a lot but he\nwas so proud Jay because he knew his\nlegacy and my mom's Legacy were not\ngoing to be lost and he was a big\nbeliever in history and Legacy and he\nsaid every generation has the\nresponsibility to honor the generation\nbefore them m of all Races of all\nreligions everybody who sacrificed the\ngreatest way to say thank you to the\npeople that you will never have met you\ncan't say thank you to is to honor them\nby taking the Baton that they've given\nyou and live your life that's why my\ndad's big thing to me growing up was you\nbetter use your freedom wisely I didn't\nhave the freedom that you have we're\nliving in the same Lifetime right now\nyeah I didn't have what you have I\ncouldn't go to school I wanted to go\ndidn't go to the hospitals I wanted to\ngo to couldn't get the healthcare\nnothing I didn't have your rights but I\ndid not stop because you are the promise\nand youj are the promise like all all\nour generation everybody is the promise\nyou think of all these wars that have\nbeen fought and all around the world and\nit's for a freedom that the Western\nworld has and war is not pretty it's\nugly it's unfair all of it it's un it's\nall nothing great but the truth is it\nhas happened from the beginning of time\nmhm so I think I think I love that my\nfather reminded me use your freedom\nwisely and and remember your ancestry\nremember the people who came before you\nand remember that you're the promise you\nare the promise so show up your parents\nare phenomenal they're just unbelievable\nthey're so it's so funny because they\nwere so opposite I I told somebody today\nmy dad was Archie Bunker from all the\nfamily and my mom was Queen Cleopatra\nand they but their energies got together\nthey made magic and they were complete\nopposites but I just love how clear they\nwere in their communication with you\nyeah that today their ideas are so clear\nfor you and they're so coherent for you\nnot just that you can repeat them you\nknow when children can repeat smart\nthings we get\nimpressed but when we become adults we\ndon't get impressed by\nrepetition we get impressed if some\nsomeone can actually live and apply the\nideas apply the ideas and to be living\nand applying the ideas in this much at a\ntime of such horrendous pain that speaks\nvolumes to just How Deeply your parents\ntaught you these incredible yeah they\nthey really wanted to make sure I never\nforgot or took advantage or took for\ngranted what I had you know and the\nblessings that I had yeah there was one\nline in here about the blessings that I\nloved because you have area called the\nblessings of our\nancestors um but no actually it was this\nit was this that I wanted to pick out\nthis is for anyone who's going to be\nreading the book as well this is on page\n99 uh I know now that my parents my\nmother especially truly were preparing\nme for a terrible day like this the\nlesson was this it's not about the loss\nand the death it's about the life the\ndash between the dates as my dad would\nsay that there is truly The Art of\nLiving yeah the fact that you believed\nthat your parents were preparing you for\nsomething hard and difficult it was a\nsubconscious knowing but I would always\nsay to them does everything have to be a\nlesson why does everything have to be a\nlesson it felt like every day I came\nhome I got it can we just can I just go\nto soccer practice and come home and eat\ndinner and go to bed and there was\nalways a lesson but my dad would say you\ncome with a number and you end with a\nnumber what are you going to do with\nyour dash and it was all the time and\nbecause they had seen so much tragedy\nand my dad I mean he's born in 1931\nsegregated America he has seen his fair\nshare of tragedy so he didn't want me to\nbe ignorant to the ills of people he had\nalready grown up with it he had seen it\nhe was taught don't do not look up in\nthe sky because you might see someone\nthat you know who's lynched that that\nwas the world he grew up in but the\nbeauty of him is that he still found a\nway to look at the great things of life\nhe still felt I have something to do in\nthis life he still felt I'm significant\nhe still felt I'm going to go out and\nfight for my rights fight for the rights\nof other people and so he wanted to make\nsure that I didn't become\ncomplacent and I so I think a lot of\ntheir lessons have reminded me of my\nhistory there was so much pain or\nhistory in general of all people of all\nRaces CU my mother loved you know we\nknow we all say now like cultural\nappropriation she's like it's\nappreciation\nit's\nappreciation because she she believed\nthat you have brothers and sisters all\naround the world that you're connected\nenergetically they're going to be\ndifferent races different religions\ndifferent genders it doesn't matter\nyou're still connected and they they\nwere really big on that which I love but\nwith that came the history of a lot of\npeople MH and so that's why I think they\nwere preparing me because I saw with all\nthe great history of every culture\nthere is also so much pain and Trauma\nthat got them to the promised land and\nso my mom that's what I meant by that\nthat they had prepared me because they\ngave me this\nappreciation of every culture that has\nbeen through something horrific and yet\nthey still chose to live and they chose\nto to still be good and do my mom's\nprescription always was be good do good\nbe good do good that's that's start\nthere you know she'd always say I'm\ngonna start there what do I do with this\nbe good and do good even right after she\npassed away I went to a restaurant and\nthe hostess was really rude and I was\nstill fresh in my trauma and she said\nsomething to somebody and I remember I\npointed my finger at her I go no hey\nwait stop that and she said oh I'm so\nsorry I'm so sorry but even though I was\nquote in the right I walked in and I\ncould feel my mother inside of me saying\nyou don't ever put your finger in\nsomebody's face Nicole don't you ever\nput some your finger in someone's so I\nremember walking over to the owner of\nthe restaurant I said I'm really sorry I\njust want to take ownership of this I\ndid do this I am very sorry I have\napologized to her it was rude and it\ndoesn't matter that just I just want to\nown this and he thought you don't have\nto AP you're you really I go no I really\ndo because I can feel my mother and I\nand I I do not want to be haunted by her\nbut I I could just hear her saying\ndoesn't matter how if some an eye for an\neye doesn't work so just because she was\nrude doesn't mean that you have to go\nand be rude you know so and that's what\nI had done she was rude so I said I'm\ngoing to get you back and I'm waving my\nfinger and I could my mom used to say an\neye for an eye does not work we all know\nthat it's proof it doesn't work the\nkarma doesn't settle you just create\nmore karma yeah you just create more\nkarma yeah yeah so it doesn't work\nabsolutely it doesn't cancel it out we\nthink it's going to cancel the karma and\nall it does is make more karma to get\nover yeah it's really fascinating how oh\nI'm so glad you end there I feel like we\nwe're so convinced that if someone does\nsomething bad then we can react however\nwe want we're Justified but not\nrealizing that it just creates more\nnegative energy it doesn't perpetuate\nyeah it creates more chaos yeah there's\nnothing positive that comes out of an\neye for an eye we think that there is\nbut it doesn't at the start of this\ninterview Nicole you said you're in\nrepair I love that word I think we're\nall at the uh Workshop you know I like\nthat we are at the workshop are getting\nrepair done and you know being renewed\nand refueled in so many different ways\nand I do you still cry yes a lot just\nthe other day I saw something and it\nreminded me just right there it was this\ndraag all a bunch of dragonflies it was\nlike a beehive of and I've never seen\nthat before and my mom loved dragonflies\nand I when I tell you I burst into tears\nbut deep cry like belly cry and I do cry\na lot but it's helpful for me because\nI've noticed the times where I want to\nstop crying like Oh Nicole it's been 20\nmonths stop cry no it's and and it and\nit does release it's a release and\nthat's why I think that the Creator gave\nus the ability to cry to to move that\nemotion to get that emotion out and to\nto honor the emotion to look at it for\nwhat it is because until I cry I don't\nreally know how I feel about things\nuntil I do cry and then I realize oh\nthat really did make me feel this way or\nit did hurt me I didn't realize how much\nthat hurt me until the tears come I'm so\nyou said that yeah yeah the crying is\nimportant and and I actually will play\nmusic sometimes that I know will make me\ncry if I'm feeling stuck and I know that\nas soon as I get this\nout it's going to create a space for new\nenergy to come in but you know it's once\nyou have that hard stagnant energy and\nif you don't move it\nnew energy doesn't get to come in Nicole\nyou've been so generous by sharing your\njourney with us today and I'm really\njust appreciate how you've been down\nevery normal\nnatural path that anyone\nwould mentally and emotionally and\nspiritually after this and you found the\nend at the end of every path you know\nwhen we get to the end of every path and\nit feels like there's nothing Beyond it\nand then you found the end which is that\ntension that we all need to find and I I\ngenuinely genuinely genuinely believe\nthat if anyone has someone they\nlove this this book is a toolkit it's a\nguide to give someone the transformation\nthat we know is possible but I I am an\nawe of how you've responded and been\nable to channel your parents in this\nvery difficult time it's it's so easy to\nsay it and share it but to to to use it\nat this time is is is beautiful and I I\npray and I meditate that Anyone who\nreads this book receives the the courage\nthat you have the peace that you have\ngained and the helpfulness for others to\npass on what they've gained as well\nthank you I appreciate that Nicole we we\nend every on purpose episode with a\nfinal five these are questions that have\nto be answered in one word to one\nsentence maximum okay and I believe it\nwill be a really useful exercise because\nI think we'll even discover further so\nNicole Avant these are your final five\noh boy the first is what is the best\ngrief or advice you've receiv received\nduring grief love love matters that\nGameChanger for grief healing bomb and\nwhat would you say is the worst grief\nadvice or words to hear during times of\ngrief I know how you feel I've said it\nso many times to people I mean I had to\nlearn I was going through my own thing\ngoing oh my God I've said all the wrong\nthings and done all the wrong things but\nit's just a reaction that we all say\nyeah it's because when we say we\nknow we actually limit the other\nperson's ability to share to then share\nyeah so it's over I know how you feel\nlike oh well I can't even tell you how I\nfeel or I can't even call on you to come\nand sit and talk with you and and talk\nthis out cuz you already know yeah\nthere's no chance for me to feel\nunderstood or seen seen or loved because\nany of it yeah cuz you already know\nthank you that's really beautiful I\nwanted to ask you these three words you\nso eloquently chose third question for\nyou is walk me through when you needed\ngrit when you required Grace and when\nyou chose gratitude so you can give me\none for each so uh the grit showed up\nfor me on this journey right when I got\nthe news I had to Pivot and I had to you\nknow grit for me is is a hustle it's a\npivot it's an action and I had to have\ngrit to move through these terrible\ntimes where I just wanted to sit down\nand do nothing and I had to I had to be\npresent and on and figure this out the\ngrace was choosing to\nforgive choosing to give up the anger\nand the frustration and the pain and\ngiving it up to a higher power and not\nletting it poison me so that was the\ngrace and the gratitude was being so\ngrateful that I had two parents who paid\nattention to me and supported me\nthroughout my life and and I didn't\nunderstand a lot of things when I was\nyounger you know they were a little more\nstrict than other parents and a little\nmore disciplined and all this but thank\nGod that I had uh parents who who did\nshow up for me even in disagreements\neven in hard times I never once thought\nthey weren't going to be there for me\nand that's what I was the most grateful\nfor that I had I that I had them and my\nfriends and my friends that showed up\nfor me I'm grateful that that's when I\nwent into the Gratitude of my gosh\npeople are showing up for me and people\nare taking care of me thank you that's\nso so beautiful question number four two\nleft question number four what was your\nmost frequented prayer I would say over\nand over again my grand it was my\ngrandmother's prayer which is today is\nthe day the Lord has made and I choose\nto be glad and rejoiceful and I just I\nchose to be glad and rejoice in it sorry\nthat was it and she and I look at her\nlike okay Grandma whatever she us just\nto sing the song and she'd be cooking\nher food and and I but I found that\nbecause it was repeated over and over\nagain and I overheard her when I spent\ntime with her and I and it was that word\nchoice and I choose to be glad and\nrejoice in it so I just thought okay I\ncan do that too I I don't feel like it\nmhm and nothing is showing me that I\nshould be joyful or glad but I choose to\nrejoice in and choose to be glad and\nthen I found things to be glad about\nthat's how you found like even in the\ndark yeah that's how I that's how I\nfound it I I really was and then my big\nMantra was you know I'm just standing in\nmy faith I'm standing in my faith I\nwould say that over and over and over\nagain even though I didn't really\nbelieve that I was I just said it over\nand over again because I needed to\ncreate Some solid platform under me\notherwise it felt like quicksand Fifth\nand final question Nicole we ask this to\nevery guest who's ever been on the
