    "transcript": "I have a hack that's called putting\nclothing on your\ncarbs anytime you eat carbs so carbs\nbeing starches or sugars make sure to\nnever eat them naked and by naked I mean\non their own MH so never snack on just a\npiece of bread or never snack on just a\ncookie always add some clothing which\nmeans protein fat or Fiber which means\nfor example adding some avocado to the\nbread or some cheese which means for\nexample adding almonds to the cookie or\na Greek yogurt right so if you love\nsnacking remember this hack put clothing\non your carbs never eat your carbs naked\nthat way you'll have less of a glucose\nbike because the risk Jay is that our\nsnacks kick off that Cravings roller\ncoaster because between meals our\nstomach is empty so same concept as for\nbreakfast you don't want to eat too much\nsweet stuff otherwise it's going to make\na big spike and you're not going to feel\nvery good 90 minutes later"
