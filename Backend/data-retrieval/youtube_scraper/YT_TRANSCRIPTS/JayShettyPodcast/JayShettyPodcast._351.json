we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with j\nshett how do you describe what do you do\nhow how do you like to choose because I\nfeel\nlike when you have a role that is public\nlike I always get asked what do you want\nyour lower third to say and I don't like\nbeing defined by the lists of roles and\ntitles so how how would you describe\nwhat you do or what you believe in I\nagree I mean I think roles and titles\nmake it easier to work with other people\nwith roles and titles um but I think in\nin life it's different in my life I'm\njust a fan I'm just a I'm a fan I'm I'm\nsomeone who discovers something very\nearly on in life that stuck with me um I\nknew it was going to be very special and\nimportant to my development um to my\nidentity to helping me find my way in\nlife and once I kind of made it a\nsingularity rather than a one of many\nhobbies it just I just tried to immerse\nmyself in as much of it as possible like\nalmost obsessively and so um I'm just a\nbig big fan of what I love which\noutside of my family and friends's music\nso I'm just I'm just a super fan that is\nI love that that's such a great cool way\nof defining yourself with uh with that\nyou've sat down with obviously so many\nincredible artists and beautiful\ninterviews I've watched your one of my\nfavorite interviews is yours with Harry\nstals actually that was I thought that\nwas brilliant but when was the first\ntime you felt like a fan when you hadn't\nmet someone like when was the first time\nyou felt like a real fan when you didn't\nsit opposite that person and you didn't\nknow that person and do you remember\nthat moment you mean at a concert and\nstuff at a concert or like when you\nbought your first record or like where\nwas that experience of your first moment\nwhat a beautiful question out the gate\nbro like what an amazing question um the\nfirst time I really I really realized\nthat um it was\nchemical it was um it wasn't really\na something by design it was uh it was\nreactive um\nwas\nprobably going and seeing\nbeing a band called split ends which is\num arguably New Zealand's most\ninfluential and legendary band um they\nwere around predominantly in the 70s and\nhad a lot of success in the 80s um in\nthe in the in the late 80s they they\nsort of splined off and Neil Finn left\nto go and form Crowded House and of\ncourse everyone knows Crowded House and\nNeil F Don't Dream It's Over and you\nknow he had a huge he's had huge success\nin huge career has have other members of\nthat band but in their Heyday when I\nwent and saw them as a kid with my mom\num I I think being in that crowd and\nreacting the way I did to the music\nwhich I don't really remember my mom\nalways told me that it was it was almost\nlike an out of- Body Experience like it\nwas like I was in church or something\nlike I wasn't I wasn't listening to the\nmusic in the same way that she'd seen me\nat home or she she was looking left and\nright I was somewhere else for the\nentire yeah in a way in some kind of\ntrance and so that's when I think she\nrealized oh this it grabs this kid and\nthen I think also going and seeing stop\nMaking Sense the movie by Talking Heads\nwas when I realized like I wanted to get\nas close to because it was different\nwith split ends they were right there on\nthe stage but seeing Talking Heads on\nthat screen and I made my mom take me to\nthat movie two days in a row as a young\nperson but a little bit older that that\nwas when I was like oh how do I get to\nthem like they were on a big movie\nscreen right now how do I get to\nthem like split ends is down the road\nbut Talking Heads is somewhere like they\nmay as well be on Mars you know yeah\nthat's a beautiful answer yeah I I love\nthe I love the idea of first I remember\nI think the first movie I saw in\ntheaters was Cool Runnings which I loved\nsuch a great first experience at the\ntheaters and I was like w I don't know\nanyone who doesn't love their film I\nknow it was just it was such a great\nlike first experience and then my first\nalbum that I properly listened to so I\nit's weirdly I I talk about this I\nhaven't talked about this a lot but it\nmakes sense talking about it with you\nlike I grew up in a home where I was\nencouraged to learn how to play\ninstruments but we never listen to a lot\nof music interesting so it was more\ndiscipline than an enjoyment level\ncorrect it was more like an\nextracurricular academic activity\nbecause it would look good on my resume\nwhen I applied to a better school later\non and it really hampered my ability to\nto love instruments and so I grew up\nplaying the piano I did grade up to\ngrade four in the piano I did grade five\nTheory I played percussion all the while\nnot really knowing what listening to\nmusic the feeling is yeah there was no\nfeeling and then I turned 12 or 13 when\nI kind of stopped doing that and I was\nintroduced to Eminem for the first time\nthrough a friend at school so you went\nfrom studying an instrument and not\nreally being exposed to the enjoyment of\nmusic to listening to Eminem yes\nliterally that was it that was exactly\nit and I we don't want you eating any\nsugar in the house and then eventually\nlook here's a six tier chocolate Death\nCake decadent and delicious and just\nyeah and I remember getting from a guy\nat school and he and he had he had like\nthe he had the infinite album too which\nwas awesome yeah the first one and I\nremember putting it on and feeling like\nsuch a fan where in a way that I've\nnever you know felt again maybe even and\nthat first is so important but with you\nwhat do you think's changed about your\nrelationship with being a fan you said\nyou're still a fan but like what was it\nlike being a fan back then and what is\nit like being a fan back now when you're\nso close to the industry you are the\nindustry in so many ways you Define what\ntakes off what doesn't like you're so\nclose to it all what what has changed in\nbeing a fan a lot and nothing I mean you\nknow the the simple question is very\nlittle I mean the distance between who I\nwas in that concer and who I am today is\nvery it's a very short distance um I\nstill get the same sense of um I still I\ncan still find myself in that space\nwhere I'm lost um you know I can still\nput on music in my headphones and go for\na walk and end up in floods of Tears\nquietly on my own you know um it's it's\nsomething that is deep affects me deeply\nand I haven't had to work to hold on to\nthat that's how I know I'm in the right\nplace in my life you know um in terms of\nthe industry side of it that's a whole\nother conversation I mean everything's\nchange there and I think finding myself\nin any room or in any seat or behind any\nmicrophone or in any conversation or in\nany studio um to me was always a\nprivilege I didn't know how to get in\nthose rooms I didn't know how to do that\num I didn't come from a background where\num the kind of music industry I wanted\nto move into or the area I wanted to\nmove in my life made sense my dad from a\nradio background so okay you can say\nthat makes more sense but um that wasn't\nmy intention as a kid I I I didn't wake\nup and want to follow My Father's\nFootsteps he knows this um I wanted to\nbe in recording studios and make music\nmy whole life and I didn't know how to\nget there and I didn't know what a music\nindustry was and I mean there was no\nmusic industry really in New Zealand and\nand some might even argue that there is\nbut it's specific to that environment\nit's not London it's not New York it's\nnot Tokyo it's not Germany you know\nwherever so that is a journey that I\ncan't even put into context text myself\nI think you know this more than anyone\nright like stay in the moment absorb the\nsituation learn and move\nforward and um I think I was doing that\nwithout him realizing it because I I I I\ncouldn't have chartered this this path\nwell that makes your journey even more\nfascinating to me because you're right\nyou didn't grow up in a space that\nnaturally lended itself to the career\nyou have today do you remember if you\ncould track back for us even before what\nconsciously comes to mind what was that\nfirst step you took to say I'm going to\npursue this because I feel today it's\nreally fascinating that there's even\nmore choices in one sense there's even\nmore access but people who are listening\ntoday even myself a few years ago I\nfound myself having the limiting belief\nand\nthe hopelessness almost of my dream's\nreally far away I don't think it's\npossible those kind of things don't\nhappen to people like me I'm not set up\nto SU\nwell because I think at that in that\nmoment in time and I've felt that many\ntimes in my life I think that what\nhappens is we're at our most effective\nwhen we have some kind of Singularity to\nfocus on you know it's like this is what\nI love this is who I love this is the\nperson I most want to have this\nconversation within my life right now\nthis is what I need to do to be healthy\nand I think when we when we're focused\non things that are ultimately giving us\npurpose uh it's it it we manifest\nwithout even realizing it you know and\nand I think when we get into that place\nof hopelessness that you've been in I've\nbeen in others have been in um and are\nin it's it's when we um split that\nSingularity up into 55 things 100 things\na thousand things a million things at\nbest they contradict each other or\ncounter each other at worse they\nactively fight for fear attention you\ncan't give your attention to to\neverything and so that's where you end\nup just standing still questioning your\nown purpose your own\nabilities because it seems hard just to\ntake a step forward because there's so\nmuch noise that that's around around you\nwhen I've been at my most effective and\nbest for myself is when I've been least\naffected by that noise and the most\nfocused on what I know is moving me\nemotionally and inspirationally in my\nlife yeah that's I've never heard it put\nthat way but that resonates deeply I\nremember I sat down with one of my\nspiritual teachers probably when I was I\ndon't know maybe like 10 years ago and I\nsaid I've got all these ideas I want to\ndo all these things but I don't know\nwhere to start it was what you just\ndescribed that like fragmented\ndistracted yeah static static yeah and\nand I said to him I just I don't know\nwhere to start and he said something\nbeautiful to me he said he said open\nevery door that you possibly can and\nthen he said the doors that close let\nthem close and just keep walking through\nthe ones that remain open that's amazing\nand it was it was the best advice I've\never got in life because I felt like all\nof us were just standing at one door or\n10 doors just trying to open all of them\nyou know what my wife says to me when I\nget like there she's like pull not\nliterally and maybe sometimes literally\nbut she says pull the car over and what\nshe means is is that um just pull the\ncar over stop driving in a direction\nthat you think you should go in because\nyou're directionless right now and\nyou're actually possibly driving\nyourself further away from where you\nshould be pull the car over stop let all\nthe cars drive past you and don't worry\nabout where they're going let the\ntraffic go past you don't worry about it\njust enjoy the fact that you're actually\nstopping ignore the traffic ignore\neveryone else focus on where you want to\ngo choose your direction and focus on it\ncuz right now and this I mean you know\nwhen she's at her most L she's like cuz\nright now you're veing all over the\nfreeway you're like you you have no idea\nwhere you're going and you know it's to\nme that kind of it it speaks a similar\ntruth which is it's we're all in\neveryday life entirely capable of of\nbeing distracted and distracting\nourselves and allowing us to ourselves\nto be distracted and um it's a part of\nlife because it's noisy it's really\nnoisy and especially the older you get\nthe more you see the more you absorb the\nmore you try to own the more you try to\nDefine yourself through the things you\nown this is an awesome space but you got\nstuff in here right it's some point if\nyou leave you got to figure out where\nthe stuff goes do you take it do you\nleave it these are all decisions right\neverything's a decision and I think that\nyou know when we're probably most\ncapable of making the decisions that\nultimately Charter a path of of of true\nholistic and and spiritual and also just\nam ambition level value is when we're\nfocused on Simplicity simple things yeah\nit's true simple doors it's true yeah\nand it's what I found really attractive\nis a peaceful mind and an internal\nSimplicity allows\nfor navigation of external chaos it\nmakes us more capable yeah of moving\nthrough that thrash yes correct yeah\nlike I've I've always thought about what\nI've tried to work on a lot and I work\non every day because I'm not there yet\nis to refine my internal intention to be\nso simple and\nclear that then the external\ncomplexity which naturally comes with\nbeing an entrepreneur and running a\nbusiness and everything else that comes\nwith trying to make an impact and and\ntrying to provide for your family and\nthe people you love but it's like the\nreason for doing it is just one little\ndot oh dude when I met my most\nindecisive yeah I probably had a few\nnights drinking some wine um my work is\nreally busy and I'm not really seeing\nI'm not I'm not seeing it I'm not seeing\nthe playbook for that week um and\nsomeone can call me and ask me the most\nsimple thing and I can't make that\ndecision and it's it's because to your\npoint I've clouded my own ability to be\ndecisive um and sometimes it's not it's\nnot my it's not my decision sometimes\nit's just stuff going off around you I\nmean the thing is as well about about\ntrying to find that\ninternal balance that Clarity internally\nis that that's where the most noises I\nmean that this all pales to that like\nthink about every experience and every\nmemory and everything and whether it's\ntrauma or joy that we're absorbing all\nthe time like that's why I love therapy\nso much and and if you can do it and you\ncan afford it and it's something that\nyou would are willing to try I'm I'm a\nbig believer in it because it's it to me\nit just creates space it just helps you\nlike down like 30% the trash and now I\nhave space to fill it with stuff based\non my learnings and what I truly know\nabout myself that is of value to me\nversus the stuff that I either inherited\nthat I never wanted in the first place\nor stuff that I thought I wanted that is\nnot actually good for me like just get\nrid of all that right and U it's a good\ngreat way to clear out and because that\nis to me the noisiest for me that is way\nnoisier than what's outside this door\nmhm way noisier so you say you're not\nthere yet I'm never going to get there\nJay but I love I love the process the\npursuit but I I like the way you\ndescribe therapy as a clear oute because\nI don't think that's how it's of of\nalways seen and it's really interesting\nright we all know I need to clean my\nwardrobe out I need to get rid of some\nof my clothes it feels good when you do\nand it feels good when you do but we\ndon't think about our thoughts that way\nyeah and we are finite we have finite\nspace I think we have finite ability to\nbe able to process certainly emotionally\nyeah and way that we process information\nand how it makes us feel um a lot of our\nfeelings are wasted are a waste yeah\nbecause we get driven by ego we get or\nit takes us back to a time in our life\nwe weren't happy or it triggers\nSomething That We're is unresolved and\nand our feelings then dictate our\nactions but if we're not creating space\nfor us to be able to fill ourselves with\ngood things then our then our feelings\nsometimes again our feelings just won't\nbe they won't honor us I don't think wow\nyeah that you reminded me of a study\nthat I read a while ago that\nsaid and it may it may be different now\nbecause of just how fast things are\nchanging but it was saying that the\nhuman brain has the ability to compute\nlike 74 gigabytes of data a day\nbut we are just filling it up with like\nwe're easily consuming that much that\nisn't selected cleared out curated it's\njust being filled up with what's coming\nthrough and we're always going to have\nto because we can't like controls a\nfallacy and we can't dictate how our\nlife Works in terms of who gives us what\ninformation and how we process things\nand who tries to you know how we unload\nenergy on each other and that's that's\njust part of being a human and living in\na society but um what it does allow us\nto do is to be conscious of that and to\num allow ourselves the way I always look\nat it is like a meteer in the red right\nif if you look at those old kind of like\nI don't know if the G gigameters\nwhatever whatever You' got like the\nneedle here and and the last kind of 10%\nis red it's always red right the rest of\nit's white everything's gray bad you\nknow all good bad right and and and if\nyou you haven't got the ability to be\nable to process it properly then then\neven if you wake up in the morning and\nyou're sort of back to sort of 30\nbecause you're restless and you got some\nanxiety when you wake up if you haven't\ngot the space figured out the smallest\nthing in you back in the red what I\ntried to do is have it go like that and\nthen when it gets to about 70 figure out\nhow I get it back down to 30 so if it\ndoes get in the red I've just I've got\nmore of an ability to process and to\nmanage those feelings you know yeah yeah\ndefinitely one of one of the things I me\nI wanted to go back a couple of steps\nwas something you mentioned that was\nbeautiful where you described your trans\nlike experience almost of being lost and\nit reminded me of the visual which I\nthink baz lurman did a great job of in\nthe new Elvis movie like when you see I\nlike that movie yeah I I really like the\nvisual storytelling of it I thought it\nand the music was spectacular but I\nthought the scenes of young Elvis having\nthose trans like experiences was was\nreally really special and I wonder what\ndid it feel like when maybe when you\nwere DJing you were creating that you\nsaw people having that kind of\nexperience to you how was it like almost\nbeing on the opposite end well the\nreason I I chose to DJ in the first\nplace place was because I think there's\nalways been a performative part of my\nnature that um I I I sort of turn turn\nmy back's too strong a term but as I as\nI found myself in the in the media side\nof things and I guess connecting the\nartist to the fan which I love to\ndo it it meant I didn't really have so\nmuch of an outlet for that until I got\nto radio and then I guess that started\nto come out in the way I broadcast and\nthe way that I played records it was\nvery I was very sort of like and I still\nam but very much during my time at the\nBBC I was very active with the music I\nliked to use a fit and reverbs and sing\nalong to the songs and pull them up and\nexplode them and in them early and I\njust saw them as things to kind of play\nwith rather than just press play sit\nback think of something to say wait for\nthe song to end say it press that is\nactually the most respectful way to\ntreat music in the media and and my\nfavorite DJs do that not all of them but\nbut some of my favorite DJs are the ones\nwho pull a song up and play it five\ntimes in 30 minutes and scream over it\nand get me excited and make me connect\nto the music in a different way that's\nan example of the the performative side\nof who I am and so I started to get that\noutlet in radio and then and then I was\nlike well you know I miss being on stage\nI miss that that being in front of\ncrowds how would I carve up a space for\nmyself as a\nDJ and when I started to sort of carve\nout my Iden as a DJ I was trying to do\nso in a way that was um built out of the\nthe kind of chaos that I love about\nmusic the um genre indefinable genre\nviolence of the Clash like I don't know\nwhat they make half the time right the\nway the bomb squad made Public Enemy\nrecords and Ice Cube records and just\nlike whoa is that a chainsaw like what's\ngoing on like how did hang on what did\nthey just do they stopped that the way\nthe Beasty Boys did it with Paul's\nBoutique you know um you\nknow and I got all my stuff I'm going\nback to New York City what the heck I do\nbelieve I've had\nenough like what are they dropping in\nwhere are they going what's happening\nwhy is this happening what's going on\nlike it's just full of surprises left\nturns right turns the whole thing is\njust completely unpredictable and I\ntried to do that so I say all that to\nsay that I I had to learn how to put\npeople in a trance because most of the\ntime I think I was just hurting\nthem their sensibilities at least you\nknow I was just like that was like waa\nand some kids got it and we're like this\nis awesome and some kids were like man I\njust want a house mix like can you just\nlike mix something and blend something\nyou know so I mean my I mean for for me\nlike the joy I got out when I was DJ of\nwatching the way people reacted to music\nwas just realizing that in that in that\nmoment in\ntime whatever else was going and I'm\nsure every artist would tell you this\nwho who gets to step on a stage and and\ndo anything in that in that environment\nknowing that in that moment in time\nwhatever else has happened before or or\nthey're worried about happening after\ndoes doesn't really matter that as far\nas being in the moment is\nconcerned you get to share in that with\npeople and you get to try to create an\nenvironment where that matters and every\nDJ that I've ever played with or toured\nwith the greats of all time right\nthrough to you know my\nfriends that's what really is the if you\nboil it down to its to its primary\nsource I think it's about creating a\ncommunity experience that exists in the\nmoment that is free of the thrash of\nlife and is really there to just inspire\npeople to um yeah go into that space\nthat I was in as a kid yeah that and not\nhave to socialize with people which if\nyou're socially anxious like me then be\na\nDJ it protects you yeah you never have\nto speak to anyone again for the rest of\nyour life you don't want to no one\nexpects you to I I was going to ask you\nthat actually like you you talk you\ntouched on like the importance of\ntherapy and you're saying that's worked\nfor you what was it initially that\nguided you in that direction a how did\nyou why did you specifically choose to\ntherapy as a modality to support you in\nwhatever you looking and what were you\nlooking for from it uh Parenthood you\nknow I became a father and um I realized\nin that moment that I was Ill prepared\nto be to to share my\nbest um and so I had to do the\nwork in order to be a my best and I'm\nincredibly grateful to my wife and to my\nfriends and my family for encouraging me\nto do that um at the time I\nwas at at my lowest point I think\num and it was really hard but in doing\nthat work my life just changed like for\nthe better in every way and um and\nultimately you know gave me the ability\nand the tools to be able to like and\nlove myself enough to love the people\nthat I love more than anything in the\nworld\ncompletely and\nwithout\ncompromise I think if I hadn't done that\nwork I think I would have always either\nfelt compromised in my ability to love\nothers certainly love my kids and my\nwife and um be loved and I think that\nyou know that is the thing that really\nultimately makes me the saddest is\nthinking back to that alternative and\nhow that feels for people I think to be\nloved and to love completely is the is\nthe purpose I think that is it someone\nwho is feeling that sense of love and\ncommitment has to let go for us to exist\nand we have to let go to move on and\nsomewhere in the middle it's just\nabout the ability to be loved and to\nlove do you think\nthat you fell out of love with yourself\nor that you were never in love with\nyourself in the first place I don't know\nthat's a great question I don't know I\ndon't know I don't know I was definitely\nloved my mom and my dad and my brother I\nmean I come from a very loving family\nbut I think that it was a compromised\nenvironment in terms of it was a\ndivorced environment and so you see\nsides of relationships and life and the\nfamily structure that um are shocking to\nyou as a kid and it's hard to figure out\nwhat your identity is to yourself let\nalone what you need to be for everybody\nelse you know I wanted to fix it and I\ncouldn't I didn't have the tools I was\ntoo young I didn't know what to do and\num guess somewhere along the line I just\njust lost lost touch with the\nsimple Ambitions of Life which are\nlike put try to put yourself in an\nenvironment which is as joyful as\npossible around people that you love and\njust try to find as much balance as you\ncan and I I just think I yeah I don't\nknow man I mean I I definitely came from\na background that was it wasn't a\nsimilar to in terms of the the cause and\neffect as billions of people I mean\nrelationships start relationships end I\nlove my parents in the end it was the\nright decision for them it was very\ntough for me as a kid at that moment in\ntime and I and I think what I had to do\nwas take responsibility for that rather\nthan um either ignore it or or project\nsome kind of really pointless blame on a\nscenario that was completely out of my\ncontrol it's like okay and and so the\nonly way I could really sort of the only\npoint in my life I could do that was\nwhen I realized that I had something\nthat was more important than the blame\nor more important than the ignoring and\nthat was being a dad\nit's like all right\nlike I need to take responsibility for\nhow I'm processing this or\nnot\notherwise this beautiful future is I'm\nnot going to get the most out of it and\nneither are they well what kind of dad\ndo you want to be in why I want to be a\nfather that and hope I am a father that\nprovides our kids with a sense of\nunconditional love a very trusting\nfather who really leans into the\nprinciples that I hold dear which are\nyou know just love and support and\nhonesty and I I you know I just I I want\nour kids to know that um and they do\nthat um I'm happy if they're happy and\nI'm I want them to work hard and I want\nthem to be focused on if they're lucky\nenough to find something they love which\nboth of them seem to have done I want\nthem to know that there's no substitute\nfor The graft and for the work and you\nknow for the dedication and and being\nrespectful and and of your opportunities\nand making the most of them and keeping\na Keen very sharp radar for when the\ndoor opens ever so slightly know how to\nwalk in and know how to stay but equally\nI just want them to be happy and I and I\nwant to be someone who they they feel\nlike I said they feel unconditionally\nunderstood that takes a lot of work on\nyour part well especially considering\nthat I didn't even understand myself\nyeah so but I'm I'm very lucky I mean if\nwe're going to go there I will just go\nthere like I you know I have this\nincredible partner for life and my wife\nwho um has been\nI don't know how to tell you man I mean\nshe's just incredible and sounds it for\nsure yeah I mean you get it even through\nthe advice that you said she but you get\nit but you get it you get it you find\nsomeone in your life that makes you\nbetter and then you start to figure out\nhow you can make them better because it\ncan't go one way and then you've got\nthen you've got something special yeah\nmy my wife has exposed to me floors that\nI would have hidden for so long from the\nworld because I could and then all of a\nsudden in a very non-judgmental and\nnon-critical\nway someone helps you realize not even\nit it's so subconscious as well it's not\neven like a teacher it's not like having\na coach or a guide or someone who's\ntelling you or showing you it's just\nsomeone who effortlessly reveals to you\nparts of yourself that you know they're\nthe only one that sees it well love is\nan unspoken language a lot time I mean\nthat's why families if if you have a\nvery loving unit around you um you're\nable to communicate without saying\nanything and I think in in a different\nway when you when you develop your own\nfamily your own relationships that you\nknow ultimately grow with you over the\ncourse of your life it becomes more of\nan individual um experience that that\nthat builds from within that out um the\nlanguage changes again but it's still an\nunspoken thing I mean how did you meet\noh wow I mean KY and I met when we were\nkids and and um you know I always say it\nwas like first sight for me it just took\nher like 10 years to figure it out but\nwe we weren't together took her 10 years\nwe we weren't together for that time we\njust newal small and we knew each other\nin certain circles and we were just kids\ngrowing up and running around and um\nthen I moved to London and she followed\nabout 6 to eight months after that just\non her own and just looked me up cuz we\nknew each other from back in back in the\nday and back home and she didn't really\nknow anyone out there and she's like hey\nI'm out in London if you want to get a\nbeer\nand this a true story we went for a beer\nat a pub which I think is called the\nfamous I mean there's a lot of\n in in London that serve beer yes\nright there's famous and there's\nroosters and and there's like you\nknow the the TS on Henley and\nthere's lots of yeah so um we went\nto one of those uh I think on\nRegent Street and it was me and I hope\nshe doesn't mind me telling you this but\nI'm sure she wouldn't because it's a\ngreat footnote in our story it was me\nand a and a good friend of ours who\nstill is a good friend of ours called h\nand Cat Dey who I who I knew from\nMTV um who was just getting her break in\nMTV and doing some great stuff as a even\nas a as a young person on TV and so we\nall went for a pint and that's how I\nreconnected with her and then from there\nour story started to unfold and and we'd\nhave to drink wine to tell the tell you\nthe rest of that but uh you know it's\njust long and Brilliant and you know\nunique like everyone's story but yeah I\nmean i' know I've known who I mean I\nalways joke I had to move halfway around\nthe world to marry someone I'd known\nmost to my life from home how do when\nyou've known someone for that long I\nalways wonder how you allow that growth\non both sides because I guess when\nyou've known someone for that long\nyou've you've been three different\npeople or at least more of who you are\nand she's becoming more of who she\nreally is like how have you continued\nbecause you said you've been over\ntogether for over two decades or\nsomething like that yeah nearly 24 years\nwe've been married yeah 24 years we've\nbeen married you said exactly which is\nreally long time congratulations like\nhow was that conscious and intentional\nor you've both just been flowing to stay\ntogether that long to stay together but\nmore importantly to it seems and it\nsounds from what I'm hearing that you've\nkind of grown together during that time\nand allowed the growth I think you can\nstay together unless you grow together\notherwise you grow apart well you know\nwe got we got married quickly you know\nwe were together and it was like oh this\nis meant to be and then for one reason\nor another our marriage was really\ndictated by other things it was like a\nVisa issues and she'll have to go home\nand because you know we didn't we didn't\nhave a I could stay in London she\ncouldn't and so you know really came\ndown to like look if there's a future\nfor this then this this has to be the\nonly way forward and so we got married\nand it was a in a registry office and\nwith two witnesses you know and it was\nshort of telling our parents which we\ndid about two weeks beforehand I mean it\nwould have been we would have eloped I\nmean it was it was so fast and you know\nI think both of us felt like it was\nforever but I think it's kind of too\nsimplistic to say that we were dead you\nknow we I think we were just trying to\nkeep the keep it going yeah I think we\nwere just like look this is really great\nwe don't know what the future holds but\nif you have to leave and I stay it's\ngoing to make it that much harder for us\nto find out and in a way that works for\nthe kind of people that we are I mean\nnot to speak for her I'm very conscious\nnot to do that because she's her own\nperson but um you know I think I think\nboth of us just liked finding out and\nwe're still finding out and I think\nthat's what's cool about it is that um\nwe didn't go into it with some kind of\nmajor pressure with no dis respect I've\nbeen some incredible weddings and I\nthink you should be entitled to\ncelebrate your union however you want\nbut for us not feeling there were sort\nof 150 pairs of eyes on us you know like\nthis is for Life everybody like I mean\nit just it just suited us to just get\ngoing just get to work like we just woke\nup one day and we're like let's just get\nto work and we have and we've been\nworking at it ever since and it takes\nwork but as someone said to me once you\nknow um even even the days when it seems\nlike it's really hard work um the next\nday um like anything in life the hard\nwork pays off yeah absolutely so just so\nyou know we had 400 people our wedding\nand I'll tell you why cuz in an Indian\nhousehold your parents are obliged to\ninvite every person that's ever invited\nthem to their kids wedding so it's so\nyou could literally you could start the\nbull rolling early and just invite\neverybody with you know them or not and\nthen just be like I am set for the rest\nof my life I have so many great\nexperiences I'm going to have literally\nand they only get better right so so\nit's like literally my parents and my\nwife friend have list of people that\nhave to be invited to the wedding\nbecause they've been to their kids\nweddings love that and so half the\nwedding list is like who are these\npeople I we don't know like my wife\nstill talks about we're like walking\naround at our reception saying alone my\nwife's like I have no idea who this\nperson is and so and that's small for an\nIndian wedding like I have friends who\nhad like 500 to a thousand people at\ntheir wedding we we were somewhat given\nin a way it's not to similar because\nit's not like you're signing like some\nkind of emotional contract for these\npeople you know yeah no no it's not at\nall comes down to it just comes down to\nthe Union to the to the team and it's\nlike it either works or it doesn't I\ndon't hold my\nparents I don't have any ill will\nagainst toward my parents or hold them\nresponsible for the end of their\nmarriage it it just it ceased to exist\nyeah and it happens all the time I've\ngot good friends going through it right\nnow same yeah I I I just think for us we\nwe try to keep things really simple we\nmake each other laugh like a lot and if\nit's not the same thing it's it's it's\nat each other\nyeah yeah she gives that to me like she\nreally dishes out a lot you know like\nyou're a kind of you know and I am\nso it's it's an easy joke and then I\nthink beyond that we like each other's\ncompany and we know that we're not\nalways going to agree but we know that\nit's not going to it's it's not going to\nget in between the simple principles\nthat keep us together she's just\nsmarter better way\nharder you know she's just yeah I\ndefinitely married up it's beautiful you\ntalked about having uh social anxiety\nand you know being a DJ and talking\nabout how we were joking about how it's\neasier to get away with that but\nobviously in your career there's been so\nmany opportunities as you said with your\nchildren you want them to be able to\nwalk through the door and stay there and\nthat requires one to kind of negotiate\nthrough that social anxiety sometimes\nI'm sure you've had to walk into the\nrooms and Pitch yourself and hold your\nown and negotiate and then stand your\nground and whatever it may be talk to\nlawyers and you know there's so much to\nit when you're in and I feel like\nthere's so many people who are listening\nand watching where social anxiety is at\na point where it cripples them it stops\nthem from walking into rooms starting\nthat conversation what was what were you\nsaying to yourself what were you working\non in order to move through some of\nthose uncomfortable experiences it's\nCase by case you know my friend was\nhaving a function the other night\nbeautiful function a reason to celebrate\nand I I I I nearly was like I can't go\nthere wasn't any valid reason for me to\nnot go in my mind from a cerebral kind\nof oh that makes sense none of it made\nsense and then there are times when you\nknow I'm skipping out the door it just\ndepends I mean for me in terms of like\nbreaking it up into two things cuz you\nmake you made some good points like in\nterms of like the social side of it I\ntry to be kind to myself I try to allow\nmyself the space to make a decision\nthat's as pressure-free as possible and\nthen more of often than not I find good\nvalid reasons to continue forward I feel\nthat if I apply too much pressure on\nmyself most of it's unreal and then I'll\nend up just not going anyway and then\nI'll feel bad cuz the unreal will\nevaporate and I realize that I made a\ndecision that wasn't based in the real\nso I try I try to I know myself enough\nto get ahead of that and just be like\nyou don't have to do anything don't go\nand once I just tell myself that I'm\nlike oh well there's couple of good\nreasons to go you know and I start to\nbring myself forward on that in terms of\nthe work side of it and and getting in\nthe room I don't know what to tell you I\nmean the few times when I've when i' I\nknow that I've had to step up and do\nsomething that's ultimately helped\nchange the shape of my journey and\ntherefore my family's Journey or\nwhatever that's when you start getting\ninto the intangible a bit for me into\nthe sort of the magic of the moment and\nwhat makes performers\nathletes\nsurgeons I mean I'm going lofty but\nanybody I mean some Heroes people do\noutof body things it's nowhere near on\nthe same level and I'm not trying to put\nlike getting in a room and pitching your\nbest at the same thing but it it\nexists in the same space of like I don't\nquite know why what's motivating this\nextra gear but I'm using it and I think\ntrue greatness comes from people who\nknow how to access it more consciously\nthan I do at this point in my life\num you know you're talking about you\nknow the Michael Jordans of this world\nwho can the Beyond says of the sword who\nare like I can you they don't shy away\nfrom the occasion they level up they see\nit they know what it is they understand\nand I'm just talking about the Arts now\nrespectfully to everybody else like cuz\nif I start you know going and\napologizing for every other Outlet or\noccupation or thing in life that's more\nimportant than the Arts to everyone else\nthen I'm just going to end up in like\nthe fer position and this podcast is\ngoing to be over so I'm just focusing\nbased on your background I know how it\ngoes I know how it goes there's more\nimportant things in life than music and\nthe Arts I get it and I respect it but\nfor me that's the world I'm in so I'm\njust going to focus on that so so um in\nthe Performing Arts you know I watch I\nwatch people all the time Step Up\nfurther than they have before and I just\nthink it's something in us that um is\nthere and sometimes the occasion\nrequires it and sometimes you meet\nsomeone who has found a way to harness\nit and that is when you start dealing\nwith like the greats like the people who\njust they see it they manifest it it\nhappens but then they recognize that\nit's happen\nand then they recognize the feeling and\nthen they remember that feeling and then\nthey practice that feeling and then they\nget the ball in with three3 seconds to\ngo every time that's like that's when\nyou're dealing with just another level I\nnot there but I've had a few moments of\nmy life when that Gear's kicked in and I\nlove it I mean you know the job I'm in\nnow I mean I I I I nearly got on a plane\nand flew home CU I just was like I don't\nknow where this is going and I'm unhappy\nI don't think I don't feel I don't feel\nlike I can do this and I had a big\nmeeting the next day and I went the next\nday and I had a great meeting and it\nchanged everything so who knows man I\nmean it just comes out of nowhere but\nI'm I'm more interested in the people\nwho just somehow know how to like kick\nthat into action yeah yeah because\nthey exist yeah absolutely they exist\nyeah there's a beautiful book called\nflow don't know if you've ever come\nacross it I forget the author's name\nit's like\nMii I think his name if I mess it up\neveryone please do not be mad at me I\nthink it's cheek sent me high I think\nthat's how it's said Mii cheeks sent me\nhigh the book's called flow and that's\nwhat you're describing this Flow State\nthat people experience where you see\nfreestylers rappers musicians you know\nathletes artists\nwhere time stops but it's really fast\nand no one knows what's happening like\nit almost feels like time slows down and\nspeeds up at the same time I've had a\ncouple of conversations in that state\nweirdly like on the record like like\ninterview situations where it's like\nthere's been such a nice mood in the\nroom and I feel there's such a strong\nlike two and fro going on until the\nquestion the answer and then the\nquestion the answer and it's just been\nI'm like wow and then someone's like\nokay time it's been going for like 2\nhours I'm like was like that yeah I mean\nyou must have done that too it's lovely\nit's really cool when it happens like\nthat too because it's a human experience\nwith somebody else so it feels really\nnice I also you know my social anxiety I\nthink I think it's it's it's Unique for\neverybody I mean I have no problem\nwalking in a room and being around\npeople but there's a difference between\nbeing present and fitting in or or or\nplaying a role that you think is going\nto serve a purpose for that environment\nor that party or whatever and just being\nable to be comfortable in yourself\nthat's what I'm talking about like I'm\nnot always and and very\noften entirely comfortable I just I've\njust have figured out how to\nmaintain but there's always something in\nme that's feel bit like my Skin's a\nlittle bit too tight or my brain's not\nreally focused on what someone's asking\nme and I'm yeah just I guess that's what\nI'm that's my form of social anxiety you\nknow yeah and I think I find that most\npeople at events especially in the\nentertainment and the Arts feel that way\nI don't know many people who don't feel\nthat way or one of these that's good to\nhear I mean I definitely do yeah whether\nit's at an award show or whether it's at\na red carpet or whenever I speak to\npeople behind the scenes that's the\nnumber one emotion that people are\nexperiencing and everyone's feeling it\nin a different way about do you think\nthat is I I think it's\nbecause the way events are organized\nthey're not not crafted for community\nand connection yeah so the challenge is\nthat the way it's been built is not set\nup for people to come in and feel so I\nwent to one place that was I went to can\nlions last week I'd never been to the\nLions Festival before it my first time\nthere I've been to can and it was\ncrafted for Community like I felt like\nyou could walk into any space you\nconnect with people you could hang out\nwith people you bumped into people\nwalking in and out of stuff no one had\nan ego where people were like you know\non a high horse or like maybe that's\npart of a evolutionary State I mean we\nwas 75 years of that FAL that's what I'm\nsaying and maybe we need to actually\njust start looking at every single micro\nexperience rather than like we're all\ngoing to evolve like something's going\nto happen we're all going to evolve it's\nlike maybe we are and maybe it is just\nlike right down to the smallest thing\nlike an event like that where being able\nto walk in there room for you to feel\nconnected to people and like you came\naway with something that was meaningful\nnot just valuable maybe that that that's\ngoing to inspire people to do to do it\nin multiple different places I mean I\nwould like that I've gotten better at\njust maintaining like when you're\nyounger it's like oh my gosh everything\nrisks on this night and then after a\nwhile you're like can we go you know\nthat's exactly what it is your your spot\non that's exactly what it is like when\nyou first I remember that when I first\nmoved to LA I went somewhere it was like\noh my God if I don't make this move\nright now that's the end of my career\nand then like years later you're like\nactually it didn't affect it at all\nsomeone asked a friend of mine who I was\nworking with at the time someone in the\nindustry was like is z afraid of success\nwhen I first got to La cuz I wasn't in\n65 parties a night running around doing\neverything and then yeah and my goals\nbecome very clearly my intention is\nalways was like can I find one person\ntonight who I can bear my soul to like\nis there one person that I can fully be\nmyself because then at that event I\nfully been myself so how do you know who\nthat person is I know it changes but is\nthere a constant to that you can get a\nsense pretty quick obviously and like\nwe're saying it's respective to what you\npersonally are interested in so for me\nI'm I'm hoping that I can have a\nconversation like I'm having with you\ntoday which is Meaningful it's\npurposeful it's vulnerable it's it's\nopen it's thoughtful it's about growth\nit's about being better like but but\nwhen I when I walked in the house today\nand we met for the first time and and we\nsort of have each other's gaze for a\nsecond and it was like all right cool\nwe've got this moment here like it's\nit's it's more than just like\ntransactional like all right if we're\ngoing to do this let's do this and let\nstart and see where this relationship\ngoes in the future right it's not just\ngoing to be like good to be on your\npodcast next like is that like is there\na technique to how you do how you you\nfind people think I wouldn't say it's a\ntechnique I think it's more of a\nintuition like I do believe it's\nenergetic as opposed to like ask these\nthree questions you know like I don't I\ndon't think I have like a a formula like\nthat but I feel like you can usually\ntell by someone's language body language\nand emotional languages to whether\nyou're on the same frequency or\nvibration I find over time I've been\nable to to sense that and and and I've\nalso realized where your ego wants to\nforce it with someone because there's\npersonal gain or there that's big that's\nbig self- awareness energy right there\nyeah you can tell when it's like oh\nthere actually isn't a frequency but I'm\npretending there is or hoping there is\nor trying to manufacture it because I\nthink this person can do something for\nme or I'm useful to them or I feel\nsignificance because I'm being useful to\nthem yeah I think also realizing that\nyou don't want to be that to someone but\nalso someone's trying to be that to you\ncorrect is really important um for\nanybody going into any any area of life\nand it's something that I think um\npeople should try to develop that radar\nfrom a young age because it'll save you\nso much time yeah and energy yeah yeah\nand also it's fine to acknowledge that\nyou're doing that to me and I'm doing\nthat to you because we're in a trade\nthat's totally fine great work great\nthings come out of that but friendship\nis different like I'm really realizing\nhow important my friendships are and I'm\nand and there are multiple types of\nfriendships there are people I love to\njust hang out with and sometimes some of\nthem I like to talk industry with and\nmusic with but they're not the people\nI'm going to call up and have a heart to\nheart with about someone else uh and\nthere are others that you know I know I\ncan call up when I'm at at a low point\nor they can call me and and and there is\nthat I think it's just understanding\nthat you know we all serve we all serve\na purpose and if you're in someone's\nlife you've got a purpose just\nunderstand try to understand what that\npurpose is that's what being thoughtful\nwith your thoughtfulness is to me like\nmaybe I'm not the person to pick the\nphone up and check on someone's\nwellbeing because that's not the kind of\nfriend I am to that person but they have\nthose friends doesn't mean I'm not their\nfriend correct yeah yeah we have\ndifferent relationships with different\npeople in our life that that serve Us in\ndifferent ways and we serve in different\nways and knowing how you do that for\nsomeone is is so important it's really\nimportant and yeah it's that's that's a\nbig self-awareness lesson I think you\nknow it took me a while to figure that\nout I was always trying to like be all\nthings to everyone I think yeah for a\nlot of my life trying to fix everything\nbe all things be this be that be funny\nbe caring this like sometimes just be\nfunny or not just try that's a great\npoint I love that yeah that's that's\nactually really powerful to think that\nlike I think you're so right we want to\nbe all of ourselves to everyone yeah and\nwell cuz we're covering all the bases\nyeah yeah covering all the bases yeah\nand and we there's that subtle ego in\nlike we want to be considered funny and\nthis and smart and this how do you\nmanage your ego in a situation like this\nwhere you where you I mean you said at\nthe very beginning you have the number\none Health podcast in the world\nCongratulations by the way like that's\nthat's a real thing to have a number one\nof anything but to have a number one in\nan area where you're adding so much\nvalue and support to people but the very\nnature of a number one anything is\nreally that's just like you know bourbon\nfor the ego right it's like number one\nis like by its very nature is connected\nto an ego experience um how do you\ncontinue to build around success but\nmanage what's your relationship like\nwith your ego in this environment yeah\nit's a I would say it's a constant\nconversation on a daily basis between my\nconscious self and my ego self I think\nthat it's something I have to be\nvigilant of on a daily basis because of\nthe world we live in and the the\nenvironment we're in just someone that I\nI Mentor messaged me this morning and\nhe's kind of having a real moment in his\ncareer and things are going well and he\nwas saying the same thing to me goes Jay\nI don't think this is healthy for me\nlike I'm I'm worried about my ego and I\nwas like this is amazing the fact that\nyou're even aware and you're conscious\nand you're because 99% of the time you\nhave the success and then it falls apart\nand then you think about your ego and so\nfor me I there are a few things that I\ndo the first thing is\nthat I always look\nat how I compare\nto the work I really want to do so the\nimpact I really want to make in the\nworld is not just downloads or views or\nwhatever else or numbers it's actually\nI'm trying to create a journey for\neveryone that connects with my work from\nentertainment through to education\nthrough to personal Enlightenment in how\nthey Define that term and to me it's\nlike I'm trying to create that journey\nby building steps that I know from the\njourney that I've been on the journey\nthat I'm still on and the journey that\nI've learned from the great and trying\nto put those building blocks in place\nfor people and my goal is unless I'm\nhelping people walk that Journey the\nnumber is is insignificant but but but\nthe beautiful thing is cuz by the way\nI'm not anti- ego like ego serves an\nimportant role this a great conversation\nyou know there's egoo and it and those\ntwo things need to be managed in in in a\nway that with with like I said a sense\nof self-awareness and understanding of\nwhat is going to press your buttons both\npositive and negative but what I'm\ninterested in is like it's interesting\ncuz CU you're building this thing\ninternally from within your own Vision\nyour own what inspires you it's come\nfrom this tiny little fire that you're\nbuilding into this beautiful thing that\nhelps people but you can't help more\npeople without your ego serving a\npurpose a role yes absolutely and so I\nthink engaging it and being aware of it\nare the only two options you have\nbecause I think that when you try and\nignore that there were probably even\ntimes in my life where I tried to\nsuppress the desire to do and make it\nimpact because you think it's ego not\nrealizing that then it's just brewing\nand now you're envious of everyone else\nsee that's why the word humility is so\ninteresting to me right because we kick\naround humility all the time like it's a\nreally important positive part of our of\nour makeup and it is it's it can be\nthere's a time to be humble and there's\nno universally sort of positive humility\nand there's no universally negative ego\ncomplexities cross both of them but it's\ninteresting isn't it like you can find\nyourself If you deny your ability and\nwhat you love and your talent and and\nand your ambition too much you find\nyourself in a false state of humility\nand you can't help the people you want\nto help so ultimately turning your back\non what you should be doing yeah and and\nto me ego when it gets dangerous is when\nyou feel better or worse than others and\nso I feel like there's a difference\nbetween doing what you think you're\nmeant to do and doing it well than\nthinking you do it better like I am\nfriends with so many people in this\nspace who do who are who are number one\nin their fields but and and even in a\nsimilar field in a different way like I\nknow a phenomenal set of scientists in\nthis space who are doing incredible\nhealth and wellness work and a number\none in the way they do it but it's like\nI have my own version and I have my own\nway and Method and that's what I'm\nexcited and have an ego about I guess is\nthe idea that I'm doing what I'm doing\nbut it's not a it doesn't make me better\nthan someone or worse than someone and I\nthink so interesting isn't it though\nbecause growing up like in music there\nis an innate competitiveness of wanting\nto be the best and in sports you won't\nthat will look you in thee and tell you\nthat that attitude is going to get you\nto be the best in the world right so\nit's so interesting how we relate to\nthis thing that I think we know very\nlittle about yeah which is which is why\nI think some of the best athletes like I\nknow that Cristiano Ronaldo who's the\nbiggest football and soccer star in the\nworld for anyone who is he though I mean\nhim and\nmessii we just did a little Rolling\nStones\nBeatles exactly the world is divided my\nTik Tok feeds me Cristiano Ronaldo Miss\nthere you go we complete human being and\nnow we're in the US and so Messi\neveryone's excited cuz Messi's coming\ninto Miami and he's awesome and and my\npoint being that whenever he does an\ninterview I always see him say I have to\nthink I'm the best in the world like I\nhave to think that way is what he'll say\nyeah and I think that's really\ninteresting language because he's not\nsaying I am or I definitely am he's\nsaying I have to think that way in order\nto perform at my best so he's he's he's\ndividing it into a mentality versus a\nreality correct yeah exact that's\nbeautifully said yeah exactly and I\nthink that that's what's so fascinating\nthat if you sat down with Michael Jordan\nor Kobe Bryan who I had the pleasure of\ninterviewing or today LeBron it's like\nI'm sure they have to feel that way but\nit's whether like if they were you know\nall things said and done behind closed\ndoors you know I'm sure they have an\nopinion on on stuff that you can say\nwhen you retired too that you couldn't\nsay when you were playing are you a\nmanifestor I would honestly say I've\nbeen an accidental unintentional\nmanifestor so I don't believe that I\never set out to say okay I believe in\nmanifestation I know how it works and\nI'm going to do it I don't think I ever\nhad that I've just had things happen in\nmy life where I can track back when I\nfirst visualized it in my mind and then\nit came to fruition but I never intended\nfor that to happen and so when that\nhappened did you ever have the intention\nto try to kind of do it more or Master\nit or anything else or were you just\nlike I love the Curiosity of that I like\nto let it happen I love the Curiosity\nand I love the magic of it because that\nalso makes me realize that it's beyond\nme and I like that humility I love that\nokay so the mystery of it is is that's\ncool that surrender of it that I don't I\nlove the idea that it's happening and\nit's happened in my life so\nsubconsciously yeah that it also makes\nme recognize that there is more than me\nI was saying I'm I'm more like you than\nI am like some of the other people who I\nknow who you know are continually\nsearching for that feeling that they can\nthen and with some success be fair yeah\noh yeah yeah I know people who I\nconsider to manipulate material energy\nlike\nthey have that ability and I don't Ryan\nReynolds Ryan Reynolds is a master\nmanifestor I'm so sorry but you cannot\ntake\nrexim and do that unless you know how to\nbend energy forms yeah absolutely but\nthat's the point like like I S billion\ndollar telecom companies oh yeah that\nmint yeah I I and and I don't think\nthere's a right or wrong again like I\ndon't think someone who focuses on\nmanifesting in the in the sense that the\nway it's been packaged or marketed is is\na bad thing it's just not the way\nfunction can I ask you another question\nis it cool if I ask you a question of\ncourse this is a real conversation I'm\nloving I I I want to I want to talk to\nyou about ambition like what your\nrelationship is with your ambition\nbecause you have a big you have you\nyou've already built something massive\nand you want to continue to reach more\npeople um so how do you manage your\nambition into something that is balanced\nwith your life I think it's evolved over\ntime so I've always honestly said that\nwhen I first started I was working 16 to\n18 hour days\nand seven days a week but I never missed\nmeditating and that was always my\ngrounding practice I was like I'm going\nto meditate and I'm going to work my\nsocks off because I kind of had that\nmoment of or at least what I heard when\nyou were saying that about your kids\nlike I remember the first time I felt\nthe door open and I was just like I\nnever believe this door would ever open\nlike I have to be so grateful and\nresponsible for this and that was\nthrough meditation that was no no no\nthat was oh no spiritually that had\nhappened I mean like externally with\nwith building a platform got got it like\nwhen you realize like wow I have a shot\nI have an opportunity to do this in a\nlike I was happy and content and anyone\nwho knows me back then would verify this\nlike I was happy and content doing what\nI do today for the 10 people that showed\nup every week for 10 years yeah and I\nwas so happy I didn't feel like oh\nthere's not enough people or like oh my\nGod I'm not like I just felt grateful\nand happy that even 10 people would show\nup and I loved it and then at one point\nI did feel I was like I feel this\nmessage matters the people that are\ncoming are having great success from it\nI think it should reach more people so I\nshould attempt to and when I attempted\nand it and it and I had that first\nGlimpse then I was like wow I'm so\ngrateful and I should be responsible for\nthis and I shouldn't take this I should\ntake this as a gift and I should give my\nheart and soul to it not just live off\nthis momentary you know success so for\nme that's to me the graft was me\nexpressing my gratitude back to the\nuniverse to say I see that you've given\nlittleit all me a shot\nand I feel my only way of expressing my\nthanks and appreciation back to you for\nthis gift is to show you that I'm\nwilling to work for to make the most of\nit correct so that was like a couple of\nyears where I did that as soon as I\nstarted doing that and things started to\ngrow externally I started to realized\nall right this not sustainable like on\nan energy level and so then I cut back\nso then I was like I'm only going to\nwork five days a week so I took my\nweekends back I was still working\nevenings now I'm at a point where I've\ntaken my weekends and my evenings back\ncuz that cuz that to me is like that's\nthat's the crucial moment where perhaps\nsome like maturity and some life and\nsome some distance between youthful\nambition the desire that I've got to go\nand take every opportunity I can versus\nwhere you were at that moment in your\nlife really served you yes because\nbecause that that's the moment when I\nthink it can consume people yeah and\nrelationships yeah get hurt and or or\nget torched and we Chase something so\nfar down the road that we forget where\nwe wanted to go in the first place\ntotally so yeah I mean that's a really\ngreat point and and I think for me it\nwas like that was a turning point for\nyou that moment yeah and at the\nbeginning it was just like all right all\nthat matters is this and my wife like\nthose were the only two things that\nmattered I don't really have time for\nanything more than that and now I'm at a\npoint where working backwards where now\nmy I only work not I have the privilege\nof only working 9:00 a.m. to 6 p.m. and\ndon't work evenings or weekends and now\nI can take care of my wife and my\nfriends and my because you're in the era\nof no yeah and and that's and I think\nthere was an era of complete yes and\nthere had to be and there's there's an\nera there has to there has to be and I\ndon't want to lie about not like Perfect\nBalance you can't get to know without\nfiguring out like where your line is and\nyou can't figure that out unless you\npush yourself and that's what work is\nthat's what the working era is like when\nyou just grind grind grind grind grind\ngrind grind and and but yeah I'm I'm a\nfan of\nof balance I was talking to someone\nabout this the other day about ambition\ncuz I have friends of mine who are never\ngoing to stop and I love them for that\nand they just to them to them it's all\nout there and why would they ever not\ngrab grab every opportunity or explore\nthe next thing and no numbers too big\nand no opportunities too too far away\nand I and I love it and I've definitely\nbeen that in my own way but I I'm\nreaching a point in my life which isn't\nto say I'm going to turn down\nopportunities or I'm going I'm not\nwinding down I'm not in semi-retirement\nmode I want I want to do my best work\nover the next 10 years but I want to do\nit in a\nway that is joyful mhm and to your point\nreally make gratitude like the number\none driving force I think to be truly\ngrateful you need to allow yourself\nspace to be grateful I think we kicked\nthe word gratitude around a lot I know\nI've been definitely the kind of person\nwho's like done 100 things in a day and\nthen when I've had two minutes the end\nof the day gone I'm really grateful uh\nthank you so much for and it's like it's\nnot a checklist item like you got to\nfeel it yeah and I think to do that and\nI guess that's what meditation provid\nI've never been able to find the space\nto meditate and calm my mind down enough\nI know I will I just can't force it yeah\nyou have a naturally Zen energy though\nthat's cool yeah it's like I I would\nhave thought you were a meditator which\nis quite nice yeah yeah which is yeah\nyou you have that the I always said like\nI mean and Kobe Bryan did meditate but\nhe was the most like he had the most\ngravity around him of any person I've\never met like he was just like time like\nthings Stood Still when he spoke and\nthere was that but he did meditate but I\nfeel like you have a real like there's a\nthere's a peace around you even though\nit's not you know if it's not from that\nwhich is really beautiful in OB hard\nearned peace yeah hard earned peace yeah\nbut but I I think it's true like I think\nalso you know it's what we're saying\nabout the yes and no there's also a\ndifferent time in life for sometimes\nit's scale sometimes it's speed\nsometimes it's strategy sometimes it's\nsincerity sometimes it's you know like\nit's I I think what you realiz is that\nif you just go speed speed speed speed\nspeed like that doesn't actually make\nany sense well you miss your\nopportunities more than you actually\ngrabbed them I think yeah you think\nabout like being a Formula 1 racer it's\nnot speed at every turn that helps them\nMaster the track speed's a massive part\nof it but only when you need to go fast\nonly when you need to go fast like Round\nthe Bend if you just go fast cuz you're\nlike no no no I just got to beat the\nother guy you could potentially turn\nover and throw the you know the the race\naway that's why I love boxing so much\nlike I've just started to like like do\nboxing training and stuff it's my wife\nbugs that's the most fun it's the it's\nthe greatest exercise I've ever done\nI've struggled with exercise my whole\nlife fits and starts like everybody else\nno pun well pun very much intended um\nbut yeah this is a whole other level I\nlove it right and the reason I love it\nis because like my mom has dementia and\nand she's in the lat stages of De\ndementia I feel and it's it's it's been\nreally tough to to witness but I've also\nwatched Church sort of want to hold on\nto memories and the whole cognitive\nawareness thing has become very present\nfor me and what I love about boxing is\nthat it's really it's it's it's 100%\nmind and body and it's about strategy\nand it's about people just think you\njust B stuff it's so not the most tiring\nthing I do when I'm working out boxing\nis the inside work where I'm I'm not\nactually punching anything I'm just\ntrying to push this guy off like that's\nthe most exhausting thing out of any of\nit like that punching the MS is like\njust Rhythm that's the driving fast\ncorrect yeah and that's what I mean I\nthink we just live in one mode of like\nspeed or or slow we think we think those\nare the only two things to play with\nyeah yeah and when you box or if you\ndrive a car or whatever maybe you start\ngoing oh wait there there's so many\nother dials to play with here and so I\nthink I'm trying to you know I've\nrealized that and I also realized that\nit's the same as a hike like getting up\nthe hill is different to staying at the\ntop and getting down again and going\ndeep into the valley like it requires a\ndifferent skill set and so I try and you\nknow I I try and live a very disciplined\nlife health-wise in order to be able to\nbe high performing and I value all of\nthat like the high performance world\nlike I value all the do you have cheat\ndays though do you allow yourself a\nchance to slip out of routine always I\nmean you have to like this morning was\none of those morning\nI you just got back off tour for a start\nso you were all over the show right no\nno no no I wasn't that's the thing I I I\nallow myself like small windows and then\nI go back but like this week I haven't\nmissed a single workout and this morning\nlast night I told I told my my friends\nthat I was going to work out with today\nI go guys I'm sleeping in tomorrow burn\nI'm not going to be there I'm tired so I\nI woke up an hour and a half later than\nI usually wake up today and was the best\nthing I ever did and I loved it do you\nsleep well I sleep yeah that's a big\nthing for me I actually read you that's\nbeen something you've had to work\nthrough right like dude I've never been\nI'm not a good sleeper I hav't been a\ngood sleeper you know what's crazy and I\nwas telling a friend of mine who's in a\nband about this this morning cuz she was\nlike I'm just trying to kind of come\ndown off tour and I said listen man let\nme give you a bit of advice and I don't\nknow if it's going to work for you but\nI'm telling you like I read somewhere\nsomething ages ago where Rick Ruben said\nthat he goes out every morning when he\nwakes up and exposes himself to natural\nlight the first thing he does is expose\nhimself to natural light and then I\nsomeone someone else said it and someone\nelse said it and I was like all right\nthis is like too many things pointing in\nthis direction so and I haven't had a\ngood night's sleep in a long time and so\nI started going outside and it was so\nstrange it was such an alien experience\nfor me to stand out in my yard at like\n6:30 in the morning like in my boxer\nshorts like like I feel like a weirdo\nthis is really weird and then the second\nday felt less weird and the third day\nfelt less weird and I started putting\nshorts on on cuz I was like you know I'm\ngoing to enjoy this and I have been\nsleeping like like I wake up and my head\nis just like heavy on the pillow and I'm\njust\nrested like that works yeah yeah yeah\nyeah that's Cadian rhythms thing yes\nyeah it's crazy like yeah yeah I know\nthey're all ancient practices though I\nknow you do yoga too and so the ancient\nyoga as is called the sua namashkar so\nwhat that means is is sun salutations\nand so the ancient practice was the\nfirst thing you do in the morning is you\nsalute the sun right which was that\nbathing and gazing and and paying\nrespects to the sun yeah and that was\nthe that was what was happening like\nyour circadian rhythm was kicking off\nyeah now you're on that you know and we\nand we sit there and we read that and we\nthink oh it's it's it's only a worship\nto the sun it's all worship based but\nactually it can be worship based and it\ncan also be lifestyle related they were\nfiguring out how to get a good night's\nsleep exactly yeah they were figuring\nout how to get vital\nand that's what they were pay gratitude\nto the for and your day started with\ngratitude but for everything not just\nfor being the Sun but for the light the\nheat the warmth I mean for everything\nthat it provides right so so we have all\nthis literature and all these these\nopportunities like even in this\nconversation to be able to just dive\ninto all of this and and there'll be the\npeople who roll their eyes and they're\nprobably not listening or watching and\nthere'll be the people who are open and\nabsorbing and ready to sort of try and\nmake positive changes and help others\nfurther down the line but where do you\nthink we're going wrong like like if the\nancient species were saluting the sun\nincreasing their ability to be able to\nmanifest good things understood the\npower of gratitude understood the power\nof rest understood what they needed in\norder to maintain that this is thousands\nof years ago mhm why do you think we\nseem to be getting either further away\nfrom that or trying to get back to that\nbut we haven't actually gone on from\nthat yeah I mean it's a it's a big\nquestion and one place I really\nexperienced it beautifully was when I\nwas in Hawaii and every morning we which\nisland we were on the big island so in\nKona Kawai is like I've heard I need to\ngo I need go I've never ever been to a\nplace where the the energy the lay lines\nand the oxygen coming up from the\nocean it's amazing I need to go next\nyear and you'll have to give me all the\nrecommendations but no I've got no\nrecommendations it's not that kind of\nplace the beautiful thing is it's a Lo\nit's just pure local like it's not like\ngo here go here go just rent just get a\nreally awesome little Airbnb near the\nto\nthe anyway no no no no and so I remember\nin Hawaii we'd get like a kayak every\nmorning one of their I forget the\nofficial name but this big like Cano\nkayak they have a name for it we jumped\nin we'd go out they they'd PID their\nrespect to the sun they had their own\nofferings which I loved learning about\nthey' offer it to the water like so what\nI find that where we've gone wrong is\nthat we've unlearned and reconditioned\nto a new way of working so hard and so\nstrong and for so long that undoing that\nand resetting our habits to be healthy\nfor us is the biggest challenge so\ndiscipline is 99% of the challenge and I\nthink the problem is that because if you\nthink about school which was the only\nthing that had the opportunity to\ndiscipline us and parenting those are\nprobably the only two things that you\nhave certainly our introduction to it\nyour introduction to it as school\ndiscipline you always knew what you were\ngoing to do you always knew what the\nnext grade was you knew what the next\nclass was it was all mapped out for you\nyou never actually had to discipline\nyourself and so when that runs out at\nage 18 or 21 whenever you finish school\nyou now are left to your own devices to\nfigure out discipline and you've never\nactually been taught how to build a\nhabit how to break a habit how to grow\ndiscipline how to end discipline right\nyou just and that's really what's\nmissing like my wife has single-handedly\ncoached me to better eating habits than\nanyone ever has in my life and I had to\nlive with her every single day\nyou know for the past seven years for\nher to do that for me and I'm like well\nif I didn't live with her I don't think\nI would be able to do these Health\nchanges like to me eating pizza Burgers\nyou know a Sprite or a seven up like\nthat was my like every other day and\nthen all of a sudden I marri my wife and\nshe's just like you know sugar that yeah\nyou know like and I'm like well wait a\nminute it took that much coaching and\nguidance and steer so I don't think\nanyone's at fault I think it's more that\nSociety set us up to not know how to the\nbiggest skill you can learn is how to\nbuild a habit and how to break a habit\nyeah yeah because because one of the\nbest things that we're capable of doing\nbut we tend to use against ourselves is\nthe ability to absorb and translate\nabsolutely and it's like all right if\nyou can manipulate that if you know how\nto put things in because we're really\ncomplex but also quite simple totally\neverything's a routine right\neverything's a pattern it takes one\nperson to do something cool and we're\nquite a sing We we live in a singularity\npretty quickly it's just like you know\nwhat I mean it's just like that's cool\nlet's all do that right we all do it and\nso yeah it's it's interesting isn't it\nlike I think you're right we allow\nourselves and and to your point about\ndiscipline we need to have the\nconfidence in our own abilities and in\nour own um determination to be\ndisciplined enough to do what's right\nfor ourselves yeah right yeah because\notherwise I think we are susceptible to\nthe the shiny lights yeah of course and\nand I think that discipline comes\nultimately through going what is truly\nvaluable to me it goes back to what you\nwere saying that that Singularity of not\nhaving this fragmented approach to I\nwant to be this and I want to be this\nfor that person I want to do that you\nknow it's it's well what do I what do I\ncare about you used to overwork too\nright like that was a big big thing for\nyou what was did it lead to did you ever\nget to that brink of burnout and pain\nand that's what shifted absolutely man I\nhad physical pain for like 5 years\nchronic pain like I wouldn't say it was\nchronic it was a consistent there were\nconsistent pains wearing the body like\narm finger um neck lower back hip wow a\nlot yeah a lot of plac a lot of pressure\npoints and um a lot of it really was\nwell there's a couple things going on\nthere there was some there was some some\nstuff I had to process from one side of\nthe brain to the other that I hadn't\ndone so it was stuck in my body so once\nI actually started to work that through\nin therapy and you did that all through\ntherapy that 100% yeah my guy put\nme to sleep once he basically broke it\ndown for me I was like for 20 minutes\nwoke up and 3 weeks later things started\ndisapp at but also I was I absorb I was\nabsorbing a lot into my body through of\nthe of the work and the stress and the\noverwork um cuz I I didn't have anywhere\nelse to put it and so my body was trying\nto protect me it was like well we'll\nstore it but after a while that body\ngets filled up and then it starts to\nache and hurt and and the pain starts to\nhappen and I really genuinely thought\nI'm just going to live with these aches\nthis will be it for the rest of my life\nright as long as it doesn't kill me I\ncan live with it why would you want to\nlive with pain so I'm so glad that I was\nable to kind of start to unlock that so\nverbal release mhm you all the therapy\nyou did was traditional therapy or it\nwas more even just a concept that\nactually in my mind in my brain I have\nbeen storing it in an area where my\nbrain is telling me to put it all in\nhere and what I need to do is is to\ncreate space in here to put it somewhere\nwhich has infinitely more ability to be\nable to process and distribute and\nremove and and and release so I need to\nget it over there and and as simplistic\nas that sounds it just worked for me I\nmean it was a concept and perhaps it's\nrooted in truth and perhaps it's not I'm\nsure there' be people who are saying\nwhat are you talking about other people\nwho' be like Ah that's exactly right but\nyou know the way that it was it was it\nwas explained to me was that I had been\nstoring it in my brain because I didn't\nhave the ability to be able to deal with\nit emotionally and so I didn't want to\nand so once I figured out that I didn't\nhave anything to be afraid of just talk\nit through get it out release it let it\ngo it started to transfer and the pain\nstarted to disappear that's the first\ntime I've heard about that in therapy\nthat's cool but I was working through it\nyeah like working around the clock\nbecause again it's a great distraction\nisn't it you know getting up and going\nto work is a great way to spend your\ntime avoiding things that you don't\nreally want have to deal with and it's\nalso more productive so the harder you\nwork the more you achieve the more you\nachieve the more you tell yourself\nyou're okay then when you tell yourself\nyou're okay you're not dealing with\nabsolutely so it's like okay you know\nand and the opp the opposite is also\ntrue which is why back to your argument\nof balance like the opposite also true\nwhere if you're too idle and there's no\ndirection and there's no Pursuit and\nthere's no work yeah for sure there's\nthere's an infinite amount of ways to do\nit I'm just that's how I did it and um\nand you know there's a difference\nbetween work and hard and and working\nand working hard right like like for me\nit's like I love to work and I love to\nwork hard but I don't have to work hard\nto be working well right I can I can I\ncan do it in a way that is like you know\nefficient and good for my balance excuse\nme good for my balance my decision-\nmaking got better my ability to delegate\ngot better I became less stressed out\nabout the things that I didn't have\nany reason and or um right to be\nstressed out about I stopped feeling I\nneeded to respond to every single email\nand every single thing and I start to\ntrust the process and I don't know you\nhave to ask my colleagues but I feel\nlike I'm happier and better at what I do\nso yeah I'm I'm a big believer in in\njust because you're putting the hours in\ndoesn't mean you're actually getting the\nmost out of it absolutely absolutely\nyou've sat with so many of the you know\nmost iconic artists of our\ntime and and this generation and you\nknow you you're a brilliant interviewer\nyou ask awesome you listen so\neffectively like it's fun to watch like\ngenuinely fun to watch who do you feel\nwas like wise beond their Years or or\nlike an old soul but because most of\nthem are young like a lot of a lot of\nthem are very young who did you find was\nkind of like you know I find the\nconversations that leave me most\ninspired\nand feeling like something in my life\nhas changed and I've I've learned\nsomething new tend to come from the\npeople who reached a point in their life\nwhere they're not trying to\nsell something\nanymore\nand they don't have to do\nthis it's there's some value in the\nconversation and perhaps they're looking\nfor learning themselves the truth is\nmore often than not I find elements of\nthat in everybody because I'm\nnot trying to squeeze juice out of the\nlemon mhm mhm I'm genuinely not trying\nto sell anything at this point in my\nlife I love music so it's easy for me to\ntalk about it and to say it's great and\nto back and forth about it but I don't\nfeel any need and I don't feel there's\nany requirement for me at this point in\nmy life to try to sell anything when I\ngo into the conversation and I don't\nknow if I going to ask your question\nbecause no one immediately sprang to\nmine because I think I'm I'm not I'm not\nexisting in a hierarchy anymore yeah\nyeah yeah that's a beautiful I'm not I'm\nnot thinking like this person surprised\nme or this person was not Charming or\nthis person was wise beyond their years\nif you'd ask me that 5 years ago I could\nhave given you an answer like that\nthat's a beautiful answer I love that\nbut I'm trying to go into every\nconversation whether it's little yachty\nor Neil Young or Billy ish or you know\nwhatever I'm just trying to go into a\nconversation from a position just like\nus of what is the most interesting and\nhuman experience that I can have and I\nremove as much of the cell as I can and\nI try to get into a place with people\nwhere like I don't really have questions\nanymore and I don't really go in with a\nhigh with a with a with a framework\nanymore I just try to feel the music\nretain how it makes me feel and just get\nto that as much of that feeling as I can\nin the conversation and so\neveryone is surprising and everyone\ncatches me off guard with their\nobservations because I'm not going in\nwith any prior observations or any kind\nof premeditated framework yeah I'm not\ncoming in going I think I know what\nyou're like and I will say that the one\nonly time I've ever had a proper like\nlong form conversation with Justin\nBieber changed that's what changed it\nfor me because I thought I was going to\nget a great conversation focused on an\nalbum that served the purpose that the\nlabel and the management and the artist\nwanted it to serve and serve the purpose\nthat Apple music wanted it to serve and\nI would get something out of it too and\nthat conversation became something very\ndifferent very quickly and I realized\nthat he wasn't interested really in\nselling anything\neither on that day and that was the\nmoment that I learned how to\nlisten and stopped trying to control the\nnarrative and gave myself the the space\nto go with it and not panic mhm\nit's just a moment it's just people yeah\nstay present listen observe and try and\nfigure it out so from that point forward\neverybody that I've spoken to really I\nget there with everyone in some way\nshape or form that if that makes sense\nmakes so much sense makes Beyond sense I\nlove it I every every time I'd have a\nconversation with anyone before that I\nwould come in with so many different\nmetrics of you know questions and orders\nand this and that and expectations and\nwhatnot and you know if you ever get a\nchance to sit if you haven't already\nopposite Neil Young you cannot go into\nit with that he has no\ninterest it's like this is all that\nmatters and if you think you're going to\nbe able to sort of carve out some shape\nwith him then he's just going to be like\nlook man like it's not what I'm here for\nI'm not interested in it so I really\nlike this yeah me too yeah I love that\nthank you for saying that I don't know\nwhat to do with the old meth anymore I\nused to have one I just don't know what\nto do with it yeah yeah and every now\nand then I myself falling I find myself\nfalling into it cuz I'm\nworried and I can't stick to it\neverything you need to know is in the\nanswer right every question you need you\nhave a structure when you're untrained\nand then when you're trained it's spont\nspontaneous it's like a I just wasn't\nlistening Jay I was just going in and\ntrying to figure it all out before it\neven happens which is very in line with\nwho I was and who I've been through how\npeople train too I think sometimes right\nlike yeah I'm just Terri I'm a very\nanxious person I got to know the you\nknow my therapist always says you know\nanxiety is based on not knowing the\noutcome right you're scared of what the\noutcome is going to be and so you know I\nneed to prepare for every outcome and at\nthe end of the day what I really need to\ndo is just start and listen and it will\nbe what it will be Z this has been such\na special honest open conversation I've\nloved every bit of it and uh we end\nevery onp purpose interview with the\nFast Five so these are questions we do\nask everyone okay and every question has\nto be answered with one word to one\nsentence maximum okay so it's short\nanswers suzan Lo these are your Fast\nFive the first question do they change\nevery time no okay they stay they four\nout of five stay exactly the same okay\nhit me okay so the first question which\nwe've asked everyone who's ever been on\nthe show is what is the best advice\nyou've ever heard or received uh be\nyourself cuz everyone else is taken nice\nsecond question what is the worst advice\nyou've ever heard or received eat that\nit's not that\nhot all right uh question number three\nhot ones at me seriously hot ones call\nme my kids won't ever respect me until\nI'm on that show\nI I love that uh question number three\nuh what is the one thing that if you'd\nwant your children to remember every day\nwhat would it be you are\nloved\nand you can love love that question\nnumber four what's something you're\ntrying to unlearn right now that I don't\nhave to wash my\nhands every time I a surface and they\ndon't have to check the Taps I'm always\ntrying to unlearn my OCD compulsions how\ndoes that affect life what is that it's\nbeen my life for so long that um I think\nthe most frustrating thing is I'm just\nI'm used to it that's what frustrates me\nthe most if I ever stop and take a step\nback and realize and actually try to\nhave step back for myself and realize\nwhat I'm doing and what it must look\nlike not that I'm ashamed of it or that\nI worry about what other people think of\nit just for my own sense of awareness I\nget very\nfrustrated and really try to tell myself\nlike if you don't do this routine the\nworld is not going to end and I have\nvarying degrees of success that's hard\nbut I'm always trying to unlearn it\nFifth and final question that we ask\nevery guest on the show if you could\ncreate one law that everyone in the\nworld had to follow what would it be\nthat we would allow ourselves the\nprivilege of listening to each other\nbefore we act that we would do our best\nto understand the many points of view\nand that that level of understanding and\nultimately that knowledge would allow us\nto come together to fix\nthings and not keep breaking things so\nneeded Zan L everyone if you've been\nlistening or watching wherever you are\nwhether you're walking a dog
