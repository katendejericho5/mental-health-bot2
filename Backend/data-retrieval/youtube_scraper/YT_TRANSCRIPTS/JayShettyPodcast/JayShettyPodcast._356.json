famed interior\ndesigner of private residences and\nboutique hotels we were doing three\nhotels at one time and I was burning the\nmidnight oil and then you lose a team\nbecause they're burnt out

podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett Kelly I'm really happy to be with\nyou\nbecause I've had so many special offline\ninteractions with you and I've always\nloved them because you always have this\nreally bright really light energy about\nyou and you know we'll bump into each\nother in one of the beautiful hotel\nprojects you've worked on or we bumped\ninto each other at uh mutual friends\nhomes or you've been here to and I've\njust always appreciated just how\nthoughtful that you are how reflective\nyou are and I've been really looking\nforward to this so thank you so much for\ndoing it honestly oh thank you Jay well\nI'm so honored to be here and be one of\nyour guests and sitting here with you\nsuper excited okay well let's dive in\nthe question I want to start with you is\ncan design make you happy yes absolutely\nand you know one of the most beautiful\nparts of my jobs is making people happy\nwhich is like I me you can't I can't\nbelieve I get paid for what I do because\nit's making people happy and inspiring\npeople and uh you know there's nothing\nbetter than designing a hotel and going\nin time and time again and seeing people\nlaughing and having fun and listening to\nmusic and seeing them time and time\nagain you know whether they're there as\na leer traveler or business traveler and\nknowing that's their place that's a\nlocal venue for them just makes me feel\nso good yeah I've been to two of your\nprojects the one in Austin uh the proper\nHotel there in the one downtown in LA\nand they are just spectacular and you're\nso right like I remember when I walked\nin last year we were going to watch F1\nand so I'd come into the A and I bumped\ninto you and you were listening to the\npodcast you showed it to me which was\namazing I loved it and then I just\nlooked at this one place behind the\nsteps and you have all these most\nbeautiful collected like pots and vases\nand like they're just they're so simply\nand beautifully kept on this like this\nkind of Step I'm I'm I have no you have\nsuch a good memory yeah I I have a\npicture of on my phone like I'm like\nit's it's stunning and it's so\ninteresting to me because I think I\nunderestimate growing up just how much\nspaces and Aesthetics affect our mind\nand today as someone who wants to live\nan intentional mindful life I find that\ndesign and interiors and Aesthetics play\nsuch a big part in the mood we\nexperience and how we feel throughout\nthe day what do you think it is about\ndesign that does make people happy or\nsad or drain energy or bring energy or\nlike you just said you walk into a space\nand people are connecting versus\nisolated like what what is it about\ndesign that's doing what have you\nlearned about design people want to see\nand experience something they haven't\nseen before and that's what you know I\nlove doing at for example a hotel\nproject and they also want to feel uh a\nlocation and you know when you travel to\nsay Austin Texas and you remember those\nbeautiful uh the pottery on the stabs I\nmean all those were designed by local\nartisans so really bringing like this\nlocal experience and this authentic\nexperience to you know wherever we\ndesign and and you know all of our\nprojects are you know very sight\nspecific and uh you know getting very\nclose to our our client and really\nunderstanding and listening to uh to\nwhat the client you know intentions are\nthey're going to be no surprises and\nthey're going to love to be in their\nenvironment and it's going to in turn\nmake them happy and uh and inspire them\nand we all want to live a better life\nand we all want to look better in our\nclothing and it's the same thing at home\nyou know we want to surround oursel with\nthings that are familiar and make us\nhappy yeah I've got a lot of friends in\nmy life right now who are trying to\nredecorate or redesign their homes which\ncan be such a challenging thing to do\nyou obviously worked on some private\nhomes obviously you work on hotels and\nso many other spaces but if someone's\nlistening right now and they're thinking\nKelly like you know the book looks\nstunning like they've seen your pictures\non Instagram they're like like wow that\nliving room looks spectacular but\nthey're thinking you know what maybe I\ndon't have access to a designer maybe I\nI don't have access to Kelly like but I\ndo now through the podcast how do I find\nmy creative Spirit like how do I find\nthat spark to start that process in my\nown home well you know there's something\nthat everyone gravitates towards and I\nreally encourage everyone to to go out\nto museums and go to a flea market and\ngo to vintage stores and and I always\nsay vintage stores because I think it's\nimportant for people to see history and\nsee things that are Soulful and that\nhave had like this life you know there's\nlike you know I love like you know how I\ndesign it's like there's always an old\nsoul and a new spirit you know I love\nemerging artist and I love contemporary\nartist and and that is you know apparent\nin everything I do I dress that way as\nwell so really looking at you know what\nis something you like to collect are you\nyou know interested in art and and maybe\nstarting there you know do you like\ncolor maybe you want to have color in\nyour home and and uh you know maybe\nthat's a good place to start and and and\nbaby steps and pace is so important\nbecause when somebody gets their\napartment and I've been there it's like\nI'm so excited I want to get in there\nand make it amazing and and enjoy it\nright away um but you really should take\nyour time like it's really important\nbecause you're going to really value all\nthe pieces and they'll spark a memory\nyou know so maybe you went to a flea\nmarket with a friend and you're going to\nremember that day or you traveled uh\nwith your boyfriend or husband and you\nfound this really cool chair together uh\nor went to a gallery so baby stepping\nand um and being very thoughtful about\nabout what you start to curate I really\nlove what you said about history and\nvintage and I think it's so true I I'll\ngive an example of something that\nhappened to me recently so I remember a\nquote from Robin Sharma which I read\nwhen I was very young he wrote a book\ncalled The monku sold his Ferrari the\nquote the quote read so it was a fiction\nstory and it's really funny I read it so\nyoung but ordinary people have big TVs\nextraordinary people have big libraries\nand that always inspired me and today\nI'm fortunate enough to have a beautiful\nbookshelf in in our main living room\nwhich is like you know there's a lot of\nbooks that can fill in that shelf and so\nwhat I've been doing is travel and\ncurating books for that for my by myself\nbecause I really enjoy reading but I\nalso enjoy design I can't wait for this\nto be right there while I was doing that\nI was inside a store we have a local\nBuck Mason store here in LA and I was\ninside there they do a great curation\nand their curat always finds books from\nall over and so I was in there checking\nout their books and they said Jay you\nknow what if you really want books you\nshould go to this random vintage store\ndown the road and I'd never seen this\nstore so I start walking around I walk\npast this store and it looks closed and\nit looks really small and it looks\nreally old and I don't see anyone in\nthere but I start knocking and just to\nmake sure this lady comes out and she\nopens the door and I say hey I heard you\nhave vintage books here I'd love to see\nthem and she goes oh yeah she binds\nbooks you could see all these like old\nbinding materials for like these you\nknow massive book covers and all of the\nold machinery and tools and processes\nyou would need and she said well I don't\nreally sell books but we have all these\nbooks here and she said I'll tell you\nyou know she told me a story she was\nlike when I got divorced from my husband\nwho used to own loads of bookstores I\ngot half the books so she goes I just\nhave thousands and thousands of books\nsome of them are here most of them are\nat home I said well I'd love to look\nthrough them so I started looking\nthrough these books and I was\ndiscovering like early editions of\nreally special books and I was you know\nstarting to make a list and I got a\nwhole pile out and she she was really\nlike she didn't care she was like you\ncan take them for free and I was like no\nno no I'd love to pay for them like you\nknow this is such a gift and so I so I\npaid them whatever she asked me to pay\nfor them and then there was one book and\nshe said I've been looking for this book\nfor years and she goes I couldn't find\nit because it was like all these crease\npages and hidden away and she said do\nyou mind if I don't sell this to you can\nI keep it and I said of course I was\nlike it's your book if you can it was I\nreally wanted it it was called I'd never\nread it but it was a little book that\nwas called like the Hidden Temple and I\nwas like oh that sounds so cool like\nespecially with my background but anyway\nshe kept that one I know that um that\nshop cuz she does book binding and\nthere's very few companies that do that\nstill and you know the like I love going\nto a bookstore and just getting lost in\nthe aisles and just randomly just\npulling books out of something that I\nknow nothing about and there's a The\nStrand Bookstore in New York it's\namazing bookstore and there's so few now\nthere's a few downtown that are so good\nbut I agree like going and and just\ndigging around and exploring and\nDiscovery and and really it's all about\nhaving an open heart and being open to\nall the possibilities and you know\nenlightening yourself I think one of the\nchallenges that makes it hard to do what\nwe're both agreeing on is that we're so\nused to now seeing the same thing like\nif you're on Instagram and you're\nfollowing these channels everyone's\nposting the same kind of Interiors the\nsame kind of rug with the same kind of\ntable which there's nothing wrong with\nthat that's how things get mainstream\nand and bigger and scaled how do you\nchallenge yourself to stay curious and\ntry and discover new things like how\nwhat do you do what are the practical\nsteps that you take to be open-minded I\nguess I'm constantly you know in search\nof something new that I'm F going to\nfall in love with and I know if I go uh\nto a gallery and I'm so moved and I\nmight see three new materials come\ntogether in this unbelievable creation\nand something I've never seen before and\nmy heart stops it's like seeing you know\nthat cute guy and you're just like oh my\nGod like like you're just so moved and\nit's so inspirational to me and it's\nthat feeling of falling in love and you\nwant to keep falling in love and\ncontinue to discover and there you know\nthere's so many new technologies and you\nknow I'm inspired by pulp culture and uh\nAI which is like such a huge disruptor\nin in the you know world of du know\neverything it's like a major earthquake\nhappening right now also all of our\nclients are also different and they come\nyou know they're from all over the world\nand all the architectur is different and\nthe landscape the view from the window\nis different so everything truly is one\nof a kind so I'm just always searching\nlike you know I have my bar is like\nsuper high and I just want to keep doing\nbetter and and striving you know to be a\nbetter designer and I kind of live that\nway I want to you know be uh you know\nthe best mom I can be the best you know\nwife I can be and and and you know\nleader at my studio for my team you know\njust being inspired and sharing you know\nmy love and uh you know continuing to\nmake people happy if there's people\nwatching and listening right now and\nthey're like Kelly I just have bad taste\nlike they're like you know I just I just\ndon't you know I can't I don't know what\nmatches like I try but it doesn't look\nright like if if the people feel like\nthat like have you I'm sure you've\nworked with places people homes hotels\nwhere you kind of see that creative\nslump what is it that you say to someone\nwho's struggling goes I just have bad\ntaste I can't think about this like how\nwould you encourage them to think about\nthat well nobody should B with all of\nthe visuals in our world with magazines\nand social media and everything like\nthere's so much inspiration out there so\nit's really just having an open heart\nand and being aware and and finding your\npassion and what you love and what moves\nyou like what excites me is seeing\nsomething that I haven't seen before and\nyou can't find that unless you go out\nand seek it out like even you might find\nsomebody's like oh my God I love the way\nthey dress or I went to this home and it\nwas so incredible and inspirational and\nit happens to me all the time I'll go to\num to a party and it's like how they set\nthe bar and it's like wow like I haven't\nseen that and that's really cool and I'm\ngoing to put it in my bag of tricks for\nthe next time I have you know and I'm\ninspired and I love it I take photos of\neverything that's like my journal like I\ntake photos of everything and every\nmonth I always go back and and look at\nyou know what has inspired me and U you\nknow I I share it I like to share it\nwith you know my team and um and social\nmedia and just see you know how my eye\nwanders and and what excites me yeah I\nthink you spot on when I was on my tour\nthis year I took so many pictures around\nthe world of stores Arts\nFabrics textures details like there were\nso many things that I was like wow I\nwould never have thought about that\ntogether or and there's a pattern like\nthat's where you'll discover like your\nstyle like would you Jay if I said what\nis your\nstyle what what would you say oh my the\nway I dress or the way I uh design like\nmy home just inherently because they go\nlike how somebody dresses and before you\nanswer that question like I always I\nhave clients who'll say you know what\nlike I really I'm not sure exactly what\nI like and I'm like listen we're going\nto go in your closet and we're going to\nsee like what you gravitate towards is\nit all neutral like do you like pattern\ndo you like little bits of color is it\nmodern is it more minimalist and like\nthe answer is there yeah absolutely i'\nI'd say that my overall style is I try\nand wear something that's a more or not\nwhere I try everything to have more of a\nuntraditional silhouette or something\nthat's hopefully a bit thoughtful I like\nmy spaces to be very calm and very\napproachable and I think about\neverything like a sanctuary so I think\nabout the energy that it has even more\nthan the item and I think when I'm\nespecially putting my spaces together\nI'm like okay well what how do I want to\nfeel when I walk into this room and you\nknow even when we had a tiny apartment\nback in New York which we lived in like\nthis 600 foot apartment every corner of\nour apartment was thought about in that\nway like what can we put in this corner\nto make it feel special or like how do\nwe differentiate between the bedroom and\nthe bathroom when it's like in the same\nspace right like what do you do whether\nit's a scent whether it's something you\nsee I even think about like what's the\nfirst thing I see in the morning and\nwhat's the last thing I see at night all\nof these kind of things to me are really\nimportant and like like you said it\ncould be an art piece it could be\nPottery it could be a picture of your\nfamily like I think it can be anything\nand everything but I think we don't\noften use visual cues and Aesthetics we\nthink of it so aesthetically that we\nforget how emotional it is if that makes\nsense we think of it as like oh that's\njust about looking cool and being cool\nit's not about feeling a certain way but\nto me like even when I walked in today\nand I saw the cover of your book and I\nwas like oh wow that looks beautiful\nlike I wanted to feel it and I wanted to\nI was drawn towards it I was like wait a\nminute what what's the texture like and\nI think when we were kids that's how we\napproach things when you're a kid you\nsee something cool and you want to touch\nit you want to press the button you want\nto and I think as adults I think we\nsometimes lose that do you ever how how\ndo you feel about do you think that as\nchildren we are naturally that way and\nthat you are connected to your childlike\nfeeling or is that is that something\nelse well I'm like the most curious\nperson and uh and that drives my passion\nand you know I'm just I want to know how\nsomething's made I want to know you know\nand I love going to artist Studios and\nseeing how how they operate I love going\ninto a creative's home and just see how\nhow they organize curiosity is such a\nbig driver and I just love the\nimagination you know and it started when\nI was like really little I had um when I\nwas about 7 years old we would go visit\nmy grandparents and our you know cousins\nand everyone and I would make these\nlittle uh designs like I would take like\nan an egg carton and do something\ninteresting you know with it I would\nmake little cards for the family to buy\nand you know blank cards with a drawing\non it and then uh I would pack\neverything up and I would take it and\nput it on my grandparents table and put\nlittle price tags I was in business I\nwanted to make money because my mom was\nalways taking my sister and I to the\nflea market and that's where I really\nstarted educating my eye\ngoing to the flea market and not having\nany money is not fun so I'm like I'm\njust going to like start making money\nmyself and you know and it was a great\num fun thing to go and now I can go to\nyou know these vintage stores and flea\nmarkets that my mom would go to all the\ntime and uh and be able to uh to shop so\njust in going to these and being very\ncurious and just seeing and and also I\nwas educating my eye from you know a\nyoung age yeah no and I think that\nthat's it's f how much you pick up from\nfrom those moments and those times about\nwhat you gravitate towards and I I\nalways wonder whether we've yeah whether\nwe block that as we get older and we\nstart to follow a more status quo or\nstart to follow a more rhythmic routine\nlike approach to our spaces as opposed\nto like that childlike as you said\ncuriosity but also that I don't know\nthat kind of contagious feeling you get\nI I guess how do you know when when how\ndo you know as Kelly when you're saying\nokay I need to be patient you were just\nsaying that when someone moves to an\napartment or to a home they should take\ntheir time how do you know when you\nshould take your patience with an item\nor when you're like no I need to buy it\nnow and it's almost like taking your\nexample of the cute guy how do you know\nwhen this is the one to be with or\nwhether you feel like you're settling\nlike that's such a good question like\nit's intuitive I think you know and the\nmore that you see and the more that you\nknow what's out there like you're uh\nyou're you know what the anomalies are\nand what what's really special but it is\nit's an intuitive feeling and working\nwith with clients and you know these\nprojects that we work on can take two\nyears you know five years and so really\ntaking our time to find things that are\nmeaningful and that the clients truly\nare are going to you know they're going\nto live with these pieces and and it it\nmakes them feel good also when you when\nyou're working and and buying things\nyour house you should have like an\nhierarchy everything can't be super\nexpensive so that's where if you want to\nbuy something new and you want to you\nknow have a really amazing comfortable\nsofa versus you know piece of art is\nknowing where where to to spend the\nmoney like a sofa you're going to have\nyou know probably for a shorter time\nwhere you'll have a piece of art and you\ninvest in it it brings a a memory and\nit's so personal that you can take it\nwith you in your next uh your next home\nso you just encouraged everyone to spend\nmore money on the\nthan the comfy that you sit on every day\nyeah you know because it's just it's\nlike you know it's furniture and it's so\nit's so true what you said about how\njust with social media and everything is\nthere's so much sameness out there and\nso you you know your your home reflects\nyou know who you are your home you know\nreflects who you are you know what what\nare you collecting and and you know it's\njust like how you dress and it's such an\nimportant important part of of who we\nare and don't you look like when you do\nZoom meetings are you checking out\nwhat's behind them always always I know\nand it says a lot about about the person\nand I'm looking at all this amazing\nthings behind you and like it's all of\nthis are these all personal choices yes\nso we what we tried to do so my biggest\ngoal for this space obviously this space\nis just so everyone everyone who\nlistening and watching you know that\nwe're in my podcast studio and this room\nis only used to record the podcast and\nso our goal was I wanted it to feel\nintimate because a lot of production\nsets have like 30 people on them and I\nfind conversations like this to be much\nmore intimate and close and like this is\nhow I would sit with a friend so that\nwas a key need the second thing was I\ndidn't want it to be packed with too\nmany other people because I think that\nremoves the intimacy the choice of art\nwas all to evoke emotion so I chose that\npiece there with the heart because to me\nI want to only have heart-based\nconversations here that's that's what\nonp purpose is all about where we reveal\nour hearts to each other me included and\neven our audience and Community is\nopening up their hearts to the ideas and\ntopics I genuinely put eyes there\nthrough that art to because I think eye\ncontact is such a beautiful way of being\npresent and being still and being\nfocused with someone and again these are\nI'm giving these subliminal not\nmessaging but the deeper meaning behind\nwhy these things there this is an afan\nshield and we had that there because I\nwanted people to reminded to put their\nguard down it almost like hanging\nhanging your Shield up the the thing\nthat blocks you and then there were and\nthey're all pieces by uh people of color\nso all the art in here were by people of\ncolor and this was to remind of the\nhighest good which is of serving and\noffering and uh which is such a big part\nof the philosophy that I followed and\nstud you know one question that I had is\nbecause you obviously were working in\nfinance and in London and you uh went\nyou became a monk how has like material\nthings and design and and fashion you\nlook amazing uh and super stylish and\nlike how has that changed for you it's\nso it's such a good question I'm so glad\nyou asked me that honestly\nbecause I think that I was always\ninterested in fashion and design before\nI became a monk so I was always\nintrigued by graphic design I loved\ncollage art and design was one of my\nfavorite subjects at school and I did\nreally well at it and I've talked about\nmy art teacher often who I credit so\nmuch with my intentional thinking so\nlet's say we're doing a collage and\nwe're doing mixed design I would put\nsomething together and I think it would\nlook amazing and my friends would think\nit would look great and my teacher would\nlook at it and say why did you do that\nand if I didn't have a good enough\nanswer I didn't get a good grade and so\nhe was training me to always ask why he\nwas like why would you put those two\nthings together what's your reason and I\nstarted to realize that the intention\nwas so important the\nintuitive design of putting things\ntogether it wasn't just about the form\nit was about the substance and so I\nwould I loved that from before I became\na monk I even wanted to I had the dream\nof becoming a graphic designer or art\ndirector when I grew up and put\nmagazines together that was always kind\nof what I enjoyed and obviously I left\nthat all when I became a monk and and\nmoved away from it and the monastery was\nalways very minimalist right there was\nno it's not that there was no design and\nI think that's always important to\nremember like if you've ever seen an\naltar an altar is highly designed\nwhether it's deities of God whether it's\nuh forms of sages or gurus if you ever\nwalk into a temple atmosphere it's very\ndecorative very decorative and some of\nthe temples that I visited in India had\nlike the most ornate carvings around\nthem telling stories and histories and\npastimes of incredible epics and you'd\nsee a you see that the design that was\nabove the place where you stand when\nyou're in front of the altar had\nspecific markings on the ceiling like\nthere's so much intentionality even\nabout a temple and how they were\ndesigned and so I think I appreciated\nall those things although in the temple\nit was very minimalist it wasn't you\nknow it was it was it wasn't I guess\nmaterial in that sense but I think for\nme now I've just allowed all my passions\nto infuse and I really do believe that\ndesigning your home designing what you\nwear or choosing and selecting it\ncarefully allows you to feel different\nand so to me design and mindfulness or\nfashion and mindfulness or how you dress\nis probably a better word than even\nfashion but how you dress and\nmindfulness and how you design your home\nand mindfulness are completely\nsynchronized uh and they can't be\nseparated because I feel different when\nI wear something different I can express\nmyself differently when I dress\ndifferently I can sit with you and we\ncan create an atmosphere hopefully in\nthis room for you and our guests that\nallows you to be comfortable and open\nand that allows you to feel safe and so\nhopefully that answers your question I\ndon't know if it does but no it does\nit's great and it is it's a lifestyle\nit's like how you dress and how you uh\nhow you design your home and and two how\nyou operate your your lifestyle whether\nit's Wellness to what you eat you know\nthe whole thing goes hand in hand I\nthink one thing about your work though\nKelly that I like and it kind of\nreflects on the question you ask me is\nyou know one of the things I often\nstruggle with is because I lived as a\nmonk and now don't at all and I'm\nmarried of course and we have businesses\nand companies and everything else I've\ngiven myself permission to be all of the\ncomplexities of who I am and I love\nmeditating but I also love media I also\nlove sharing messages I also love\nmanagement and strategy and I've just\njust allowed all of myself to coexist\nand I feel that allowing myself to do\nthat has allowed me to be happier with\nwho I am and when I look at your work\nand I'll let you comment on that in a\nsecond on me but when I look at your\nwork I see that same juter position of\nthings that people would often say well\nthat doesn't work or that wouldn't make\nsense and if you walked it through\ntheoretically most people would argue I\nthink with your designs that they\nwouldn't make sense because I think you\nput things together that seem so alien\nand challenging and random that people\nwould say yeah that doesn't make any\nsense now you've found a way to make it\ncohesive and make it work I wonder are\nyou trying to do you do you agree with\nthat first of all and and how have you\nallowed yourself the permission to put\nthings together that people would find\nunexpected you know that that's such a\ngood question and when I was starting\nout um there was a very specific style\nit was like the slip cover furniture and\neverything was neutral and I came to Los\nAngeles and I you know so grateful for\nthis first job that I got for a couple\nthat lived in Venice Beach and they\nneeded help with like one dining room\nand I was going to actually work with a\ndesign studio and this job just fell\ninto my lap and so uh it was on the\ncanals in Venice this really cool\nBungalow and designed they were like\nlisten all we do we only have money for\none room so let's do this I did it and\nand there was color and there was like\nvintage things and there was some\ncontemporary artist pieces and the room\nlike looked you know incredible they\ndidn't quite understand it and they were\nlike well it doesn't feel like maybe\nwhat I'm seeing and so you know I had to\nreally like talk them through it and\nthis is you know before you know now\nyou're doing like renderings for you\nknow your clients to really understand\nyou know there was a lot of\ncommunication you know I took them to\nthe flea Market with me you know and we\nreally made these decisions together\nthey were a little apprehensive but it\nturned out great I ended up doing the\nwhole entire house and then somebody saw\nthat and so yeah it was it was a little\nscary and and still now there are\nclients that are maybe we'll do a\npresentation they'll say you know I like\npart of it but maybe this part I don't\nlike and if I truly believe I'll take\nthe time and and kind of show them the\nway and my thought process and uh maybe\ngive them you know a few more visuals so\nthe team and I will work on that you\nknow but if it doesn't if they're not\n100% dialed in and excited then we'll\ncome up with another option and you know\nwe're all about you know making you know\nour projects you know amazing and unique\nbut we also you know want to make sure\nour clients are like so happy and and\nlove the space so it can be challenging\nfor sure how did you get that confidence\nespecially early on right so you asked\nto do a dining room I can't believe that\nyou was you know like it's beautiful to\nhear that that that today when you're\ndesigning multiple hotels and that it\nstarted with just designing a dining\nroom and I think that's so inspiring for\nso many people listening and watching\nwho either want to follow in your career\npath or do something creative that they\ncan think wow that that's where it can\nstart how did you have the confidence at\nthat point to walk them through it and\nsay hey even if you don't get it this\nmakes sense what gave it to you at that\npoint or did you feel at that point did\nyou feel a bit nervous when they said\nhey we're not you know we don't get it\nor or did did you always have that\nconfidence about your work no I was\nnervous 100% like I was like oh my God\nam I making the right decision like I\nfelt like in my heart it was the right\ndecision so I really wanted to not\nconvince them but have them like\nunderstand like where I was coming from\nand and they they uh had faith in me and\nwe went for it and it looked amazing and\nyou know you we still have those those\nclients but yeah it was a nervous uh\nnerve-wracking um experience and we\nstill now will do a presentation like\nthe team and I will work on something\nfor weeks and it's like a really big\nconcept presentation and there will\nstill sometimes be like this just\ndoesn't feel right because our audience\nmaybe whether it's for a hotel and it's\na group of people they might not they\nmight not have seen it before and and I\nstrive for that I want to do something\nthat is unique and site specific and and\nso they might not see before so they get\na little a little timid so again it's\nbeing um you know really communicating\nand letting the client know what what uh\nyou know is in our Mind's Eye tell us\nabout some of the communication skills\nthat takes because I think when people\nthink of creative careers we think of\nthem as purely\nartistic but actually you're dealing\nwith someone's intimate homes or a hotel\nspace which again is people are coming\nthere to rest or relax or connect or\ntake a break so they're very important\nspaces for us and therefore people are\nquite opinionated about them how what\nhave you learned about communicating\nmore effectively with people especially\nwhen things are so personal because I\nthink that's a unique skill set that\npeople wouldn't understand that you've\nhad you'd have to have but you you\nobviously have to because you're talking\nto people about things that they have\nvery clear thoughts about and specific\nchoices for de with confidence like\npresenting it like you have to believe\nit and having confidence is everything\nthe visuals are so important and so I\nlike to communicate with the visuals\nbecause I can talk for an hour and and\nthe client might still not understand\nlike the direction so having the visuals\nis\neverything and the confidence confidence\nis so is everything for\nyou you know like we just talked about\nyour career started from like humble\nbeginnings and I wonder what is what was\nthe hardest thing about getting started\nwhat was the most difficult thing on\nthis journey to get to where you are\ntoday what was the thing that scared you\nthe most the thing that you struggled\nwith the most like I'm I'm a really hard\nworker and I I know what I like probably\ngoing into it like by myself like I did\nthe job starting out for 3 years by\nmyself I was the the the business person\nthe creative person I was loading my car\nup at the flea market with a huge chair\nand putting it in myself and doing\neverything and so doing that by myself\nand I didn't work in a design studio so\nI didn't have that visibility to how a\ndesign studio truly operates so really\nfiguring out the contracts the budgets\nand how to present that I did it you\nknow on my own and I ask a lot of\nquestions and there were some great\ncontractors and people that I was\nworking with and collaborating with on\nthese projects and I just ask you know a\nmillion questions but I would say that\ndoing that alone and now when I go to a\nbig meeting and I get nervous doing a\nbig presentation and I have my team and\nmy support team my family um my my\nhusband who's like my biggest\ncheerleader and uh and and we do it as a\nteam and that was probably like the the\nmost uh kind of frightening part of\nstarting yeah and I'm hoping that the\nreason I asked that is I think there are\nso many people right now who are\nlistening have a passion have a creative\nproject that they want to work on and it\ncan feel daunting when you say oh I\ndon't know accounts I don't know how to\ndo my taxes I don't know how to put a\npresentation together I don't know how\nto pitch that but you're saying asking\nquestions and just doing it I guess I'm\nguessing there were lots of yeah you\njust have to do it I mean honestly you\njust have to do it it and really you\nknow just having the passion and really\nyou know the the drive to to wanting it\nand educating yourself along the way and\nI'm continuing to educate along the way\nand every project we have there's a new\ngroup of creatives whether it's a\nlandscape or an architect lighting\ndesigner that we all learn from one\nanother and and that just makes me and\nand my team a better designer and uh any\nwe pass it Bel to all of our next\nprojects and clients what do you think\nwas your biggest mistake that you made\non that part of the journey like\nsomething that now you look back and\nlike oh that's ridiculous I can't\nbelieve that was a mistake that it\ndoesn't feel that big but at that time\nyou like oh no I don't know how to do\nthis or you know this oh my God so I\nworked I worked on a project um and I\nhad one assistant we were working on\nthis project for this um uh music\nexecutive and she loved color and so she\nwas traveling and um and this was\nactually starting out she had a really\nlow budget and\nso we were like listen we're going to\nhave this painted we're going to do\nsomething unbelievable and it it looked\nawful it was like so it was a wreck and\nit was just too many colors just went\noverboard which you can do which is\ngreat you you to make mistakes it's so\nimportant in the creative process to\nmake mistakes and um so she was going to\nbe back in a week and my assistant and\nlike we' spent the money on the painters\nso we so I painted myself with with my\nassistant the entire house ourselves wow\nwow you know we wanted to make it great\nand that's not the first time I've done\nthat we worked on projects that there\nwas like a little budget and I wanted\nthe project so badly to be amazing and I\nwanted to make the client happy and\nthey're just and so I just like painted\nmyself that's amazing that's\nincredible can that person now claim\nthat Kelly painted my house I think they\nmoved since then uh but you know I just\ndid it myself and sometimes you just you\nknow you have to do it you have to just\nput in the extra work and and make it\nhappen what do you think was the biggest\nrisk you took on this journey where you\nfelt like you were kind of leveling up I\nfeel everyone goes through this phase of\nthey're doing the work they growing\nthe're building you went from doing the\ndining room to the whole home what was a\nbig risk that you thought or a leap you\nhad to take which kind of shifted your\ncareer I would say you know when I was\num doing interiors and um and this is\nlike what's so great about you know my\njob is like anyone can call any moment I\ngot a call from Bergdorf Goodman you\nknow this incredible store in New York\nand they were looking for a designer to\ndo the like iconic restaurant on the top\nfloor and so they're like we'd like to\ncome out and meet with us and we did\nlike a presentation and I was like they\nwere like well listen we're speaking to\na few other people and I thought for\nsure I was going to be a New York\ndesigner like I was the only one on the\nwest coast they were speaking with and\nwe ended up getting the the commission\nwhich was like unbelievable and this is\nlike a store that you know you just you\njust dream about because it's you know\nso you know iconic so doing that project\nand it was like a really you know big\nsuccess it looks the same way I think\nit's been like 12 years since that\nproject was was completed so after the\nproject the president uh of the company\nsaid Hey listen you know we would love\nfor you to have uh a shop and I was\nthinking but I don't sell anything like\nI'm a designer and I don't have products\nso I said well let me think about it cuz\nthat was like a dream now I'm going to\nhave like a shop within berdorf Goodman\nand um so I uh went back and I was like\nyou know what I have designed a lot of\nthings like a lot of uh commissions for\nsome of our projects and we've done a\nlot of custom things that we couldn't\nfind and we ended up designing So within\nabout um 6 months we designed this\nincredible space it was like a little\nJewel box and um we were in business and\nI had accessories and it was there for\n10 years it did so well and it\nwas and you know I I took as a challenge\nlike I want to do this I was so excited\nand I you know really educated myself on\nhow to you know find uh you know\nFabricators you know around the world a\nlot of our things were made there in\ndifferent places so it was a you know\nreally cool thing and that got me into\nhaving uh a a store mhm that's\ncompletely different completely\ndifferent and I think that's having an\nopen heart and just like riding the wave\nand being open to like any opportunity\nand now we're you know designing product\nand you know hotels I never thought in a\nmillion years I'd design a hotel and uh\nyou know work we're now working with a\nlot of Brands doing really like\nunbelievable cool things um and um so\nit's it's like really exciting are there\nany particular cities in the world that\nyou feel you just constantly gravitate\ntowards or have they changed over the\nyears and what would be some of your\nmemories of going to any of your\nfavorite cities or countries where you\ndiscovered something new or something\nfresh or even something that felt\nfamiliar I would say uh going to uh to\nEurope like I love going like the Paris\nFlea Market is it's like unbelievable\nand just any of the European cities like\nI was in Amsterdam the summer and I was\nin so great and in Belgium and the so\nmany uh incredible artists like these\nreally great emerging artists and when\nyou travel you just see like what's\nspecial and and I think it's so\nimportant to travel because if you our\nworld is becoming so same there's not a\nlot of you know if you look on your\nInstagram and uh you know in your\ntechnology things are feeling the same\nso it's so important to travel because\nyou really see what are the special\nmaterials and the the inherent designs\nand craftsmanship that many of these\ndifferent countries have so it's very\nimportant to get out and see things in\nperson absolutely Kelly I want to do\nsomething intuitive with you the singers\nwe're both being intuitive so I'm going\nto look through your beautiful book\nwhich I love to do in general anyway and\nI'm going to pick things that\nintuitively call out to me okay and then\nask you ask you the story about them how\ndoes that sound okay amazing does that\nsound okay yeah okay there's so much\nstuff already I saw this picture I fell\nin love with this actually I was like\naddicted to this whole space for a\nsecond maybe I should ask you to walk me\nthrough this because I saw this on your\nInstagram too oh yeah that's a project\nuh that's in uh California we worked on\nit with um an architect uh Marwan elad\nand he did the Aman in um Airi right\nyeah and he's just such a a talent and\nthis is U an Anish kapor uh artwork uh a\nJonas Bolan chair that from the 80s that\nchair was is stunning the chair is like\nsculpture yeah and that's why actually\nJay like one of the things is you know\nyou think you've seen everything and so\nfor example like a stiletto heel you\nthink you've seen every stiletto heel\nand someone comes out with something\nthat totally blows you away and it's\nlike a new thing that that your heart\nstops and it's the same thing with a\nchair and and having like artists find\ntheir creative spirit you know that's a\nthree-legged chair and just people\ncontinue to to uh design and come up\nwith things that you you've seen you've\nnever seen before and it's the same\nthing with music like you think you've\nheard like every kind of Rhythm or\nsample and you just hear something new\nthat just blows you away what about\npeople who think they're like you know\nKelly I don't have enough money to make\na space look good like do you need to\nspend big in order to create a space\nthat feels good to you no\n100% because you can just like I did you\ncan paint a wall and it could be one\nwall which is actually kind of cool\nevery wall doesn't have to be the same\ncolor it makes it more interesting and\njust have one amazing chair that you\nlove in one light we need light uh light\nfixture and and a table and like let it\nsit for a while and and really just um\nthat showcases your style and it's nice\nto live in something a little more\nminimal for a while like I used to live\nwhere I just had so many things that you\nknow I found on my travels and there\nwould just be a lot of stuff and I've\nkind of changed I like things that are\nreally like a little more minimal and\nimportant and it lets the peace shine\nand have its own moment yeah I think\nminimalism is definitely where I feel\nlike I feel our home is quite minimalist\nthere's a lot of empty space\neverything's very low as well which I\nreally like I know love like like some\nof these like beds and Furniture I mean\nyou need like a stool to step on they're\nso they're so tall and it's and it's the\nsame everything's getting big yes\neverything like literally mean we're\ndesign designing tabletop and you know\nwe plates like you know they're so much\nbigger now it's like everything and so\nwhat I love really low beds because I\nthink you feel like really low to the\nground and it also makes a small bedroom\nlike feel more expansive because it\ndoesn't cut the room in half so that's a\ngood note yeah a bed that's like 12 in\nin height and it's so nice I mean it's\nvery you know it's how like in J in\nJapan everything's like really low and\nit doesn't get in the way of Windows and\nit makes your space feel so much more\nexpansive these are very good practical\ntips I think everyone everyone's\neveryone's going to be getting low beds\nbecause of that this space is\nspectacular I don't think I've seen this\nin real life actually with all the tiles\nand everything oh yeah that is uh in\nAustin where we met we actually spoke\nover on on the right side there oh\nhidden behind here yeah yeah so that is\num a restaurant and so all those tiles I\nwas in Portugal and I stumbled upon this\nuh shop that had tiles and it was like a\n75-year-old family-owned tile company\nand I went inside and I was so moved and\nthis restaurant the chef that we were\ndesigning this restaurant for it's\nMediterranean and so uh the reason why\nit's patchwor is because all of these\ntiles came from different like decades\nand periods and so you know many of it's\nlike dead stock and there was seven left\nor maybe 20 left and so really created\nthis Patchwork of all of this you know\ndifferent color and pattern and and\nreliefs and it looks you know amazing\nyeah I love it it's I I didn't I didn't\nsee it that day I think we were what\nhidden on the other oh we're on the\nother side right or through there I'm\ntrying to figure that out yeah and it's\nalso like making do with what you have\nor what you've seen like I could easily\ngone in this tile store and seen one\ntile that I absolutely loved and like\nokay let's just do the entire wall in\nthat but you know having something that\nthat you know okay how can we make this\nwork and make it really interesting and\num kind of just you know letting your\ncreative Juices Flow I think that's\nwhat's so beautiful about it is that\nwhen we're present and when we're when\nwe observe I find that and I don't know\nhow I started doing it with furniture\nand things like that but I feel like\nwhen you re I think it's just\nmindfulness training but when you get\nreally present with like looking at even\nthe direction of like the Grain Lines\nyou know on a piece of uh wood or\nwhether it's looking at like how it's\ncut or connected or you know and I don't\nhave any of the vocabulary of an\ninterior designer at all or the language\nor have any skills in the space I can\nappreciate something that that looks\nbeautiful and so as I'm looking through\nthis yeah and things that are also like\nimperfect and if you you you know if\nwe're skinning if we're skinning a wall\nin in Timber and you know you want the\nhand of it to really uh show its like\ndimensionality and and how things are\nare assembled and put together and and\nit's all you know part of the\nstorytelling and it does like things\nthat are imperfect are so beautiful\nwhich is kind of crazy because I'm a\nlittle bit of a\nperfectionist and I'm trying to like you\nknow let things go a little more\nlike sometime like I literally will go\nto like one of the hotels and I will see\nthe furniture that's out of place and\npeople are like oh God there's Kelly\nlike she's like moving like the\nfurniture I'll I can tell if things are\nlike 2 inches off I mean I like to keep\nthings like super tight but sometimes\nyou just have to like Let It Go no I'm\nwith you my my wife and I get into this\nall the time I will rearrange our dining\nchairs around the table every night just\nbecause I I totally am that person yeah\nI my wife's like what are you doing I'm\nlike like no these are just too close\nand I can't appreciate this space\nbecause of this I I'm totally like that\nso I get that and I told my boys and\nlike listen I see everything like you'll\nnever like pull anything over on me yeah\nI see everything I love it this piece I\nsaw uh I loved it from the moment I saw\nit I it looks spectacular yeah so this\nis uh in the hotel that's in downtown\nand it's a pool Suite because the the\nbuilding is a historic building and uh\nit used to in one of its lives be a YMCA\nand so in order to get the historic tax\ncredits uh you have to keep a lot of the\nprogramming there so there was a pool\nand it's quite it's like a 30 40 foot\npool and so it's a three-bedroom suite\nand it has its own kitchen so you know\nyou can stay in this you know really\nincredible I mean this is an experience\nthat you'll really rarely get and that's\nwhat we like to do is like you know give\npeople an experience and something that\nthey can\ntake an incredible memory home with them\nwow I mean there's I could stop at every\npage so I'm I'm really trying to be\nintuitive as I said yeah and you have to\ngo to the Santa Monica proper yes I've\nbeen there before oh you've been there\nno I've been there it's beautiful no\nI've been there I've had uh I've been\nI've been there for birthdays and events\nand yeah that that space is spectacular\ndownstairs upstairs I've been on the\nrooftop as well it's a it's a really\nbeautiful space I love the use of like\nplants and nature like to me these kind\nof spaces of course these kind of spaces\nare really special with like this kind\nof composition but that feels similar to\nthe first one I showed you I think but\nwhen people are trying to do plants in\ntheir home how should they think about\nit because I feel like that's something\nthat people try hard and and struggle\nwith keeping them alive is one thing but\nwhat about in terms of placement well\nyou know like that is where having\nsomething that if you have a really amaz\nincredible yeah that's that's so great\nwell we are so fortunate to work with\nsome amazing talents and but I actually\nlove going to the nurseries and seeking\nout these unbelievable specimens that\nhave that are imperfect and that uh\nreally transform your interior and I\nthink too like less is more although I\ndo love uh you know we're working on a\nproject where there's a salarium and\nthere's there's so many you know\nincredible you know plants and uh in\ndifferent uh colors of green in the pots\nand it just was like a really beautiful\nstory and that project that is a artwork\nthat's a vase the chair do you see this\nyeah this this this is probably one of\nmy favorite rooms have you've ever done\nlike I love this room yeah so that's The\nGrotto and uh The Grotto actually the\ninspiration it's a library when we were\nworking on this hotel I wanted an\nintimate space where people could go and\nhave a meeting and hang out and this is\na hotel that's in Santa Monica and so\nthe it's like merry time I mean that was\nthe the inspiration and so I went to a\nfriend's um parents house and there were\nan older couple and they live in Malibu\nand I remember walking in their home and\nbeing so inspired because they had this\nincredible artwork and they had a\nlibrary and all of these things that you\nknow they're well-traveled couple that\nthey've collected their whole life and\nit just felt so real and represented\nthem and so this room the grot we called\nit um we brought in a lot of emerging\nartists from Los Angeles and then we\nalso found a lot of vintage pieces as\nwell and it's just a great place that\nyou can have a meeting and it's like\nbeing in a in a grotto yeah little\nlittle podcast studio right there I love\nit no it's beautiful and like I said I\ncould go on and on I'm glad we did that\nthough because I love hearing you react\nand tell us the story behind incredible\nthings and I'm such a visual person like\nit helps to like see to see things\nbecause I am like so visual and it's\nsuch a you know a big part of you know\nmy spirit and and what I do and that was\nlike when I was doing the master class\nthey were like listen we want you to you\nknow you're going to be you know the\nteacher and you're just going to talk\nand I was like but you guys everything\nis like so visual and tactile and\nthere's like materiality and so much to\nthe story and so um we uh went outside\nthe box and went on some uh site visits\nwas so fun yeah absolutely oh oh yeah\nyou actually went out with the course we\nwent out yeah that's incredible yeah we\nwent out to um entor and and I think\nthen people can apply and I think if\nsomebody is not like really skilled at\ndesign like they also need to see things\nas well so that helps them you know to\napply it to you know what they're trying\nto do absolutely and people can actually\nlearn from you directly from the\nmasterclass so that's that's a great way\nof giving people the tools if you're\ninspired from today then hopefully the\nmasterclass will help you piece together\nall these amazing lessons that Kelly's\nsharing Kelly you didn't you've said\nbefore where I've learned before that\nyou didn't always plan on being a mom or\nlike you didn't think about it as your\nnatural course but it's something that\nof course I've even met some of your\nchildren I believe as well so yes yes\nyeah so my like growing up you know my\nmy mom worked my grandmothers both\nworked and so having you know the white\npicket fence was not you know in my in\nmy mind I wanted to work and I really\nlove designed you know from when I was\ndoing my bunny shop when I was seven\nyears old and really discovering my\npassion in high school and just like you\nI love graphic design and that's kind of\nwhere it all started from is going to\nthe flea markets with my mom and seeing\nall the magazines and so I really wanted\nto to work and be uh you know have a\ncareer and then I met my incredible\nhusband Brad and a family was important\nto him and I was like okay uh I got to\nthink about it you know have an open\nheart like I'm in love with you know I'm\nin love with my husband and so I said\nlet's do we'll have one we got engaged\nand um and I got pregnant that was the\nmost transformational like moment in in\nmy life my family is everything and kids\nare like the most like incredible layer\nto life and I love what I do like\nabsolutely love what I do but it's like\nthere's nothing like it oh and it's like\njust everything and um yeah it's the\nmost beautiful thing like my kids are my\nheroes they teach me like so much about\nlife and you know um and I just had a\nbaby and you know so many people are\nlike oh well you have two older kids and\nlike you know what would you do\ndifferently like reflecting and is spend\nthe most amount of time with your kids\nnow because it goes by so\nfast yeah where how's that how's that\nbeen with also of course your ambition\nand you're working on so many projects\nlike you've been able to\nit sounds like be so present with your\nkids and not have to give up your\npassion and I think that that's such an\nimportant thing that we also need to see\nas well because I think in that advice\nof people thinking God I need to spend\nevery time we kind of let go of the\nthings that you value how have you and I\ndon't like the word balance because I\ndon't think that's necessarily what I'm\nasking it's almost like how do you keep\npassion and presence alive present with\nyour family but then your passion which\nkind of keeps you alive how do you keep\nboth alive it can be a struggle and what\nI do is when I'm at work I'm so present\nwith my team and and I go to my studio\nlike I love going to my studio I'm like\nin the thick of it with them every day\nbut I make time for my for my kids and\nobviously there are things that that you\nmiss out on and you know it's all about\nprioritizing and having a a routine and\nand schedule and yes like reflecting you\nknow with with all of and Elliot when\nthey were younger and this is before\nthere was like Zoom meeting and working\nfrom home and all that is I missed\nthings I was traveling and you know it\nit it broke my heart but I was also\nhappy I was happy that I was being\nfulfilled as a designer and I was living\nmy dream and I am living my dream and\nand they see that and and makes me an\nincredible mom because I get to teach\nthem things but yeah it's definitely you\nknow can be be tough what is the\ndifference between creativity and\nreplication and is replication the thief\nof creativity it's it's such an\ninteresting question and for me\ncreativity comes within it's your soul\nand it's your stylistic\nvoice\nand replication is looking outward so\nwhat maybe inspires you to uh design a\ncertain way um and you know for example\nreplication can inform\ncreativity and if we're designing a\nfront desk of a hotel and the\nfunctionality works so well we're going\nto incorporate that but then we're going\nto give it a new spirit by skinning it\nwith another material so that's where\nthe replication comes into play uh but\ncreativity truly comes from within and\nit's an artist or a designer or chefs\nit's like it's their creative uh their\ncreative\nvoice when when you were on the journey\ntowards this successful career you have\nnow were there moments of experiencing\nburnout where it's like okay I'm taking\nthis project on okay well I've got\nanother project but oh no they want me\nto do the whole house and oh my gosh now\nI got another one and I feel like a lot\nof creators today especially online feel\na lot of burnout because they feel like\nthey have to keep up with their own\nsuccess they may have had an overnight\nmoment which led to more work which is\nexciting but equally challenging even\nduring the pandemic there were so many\ncompanies that went through their\nbiggest scaling but also led to people\nhaving to work harder and longer so how\nhave you thought about burnout saying no\nis just as important uh to saying yes\nand there are projects that I really\nwanted to take but it just would have\njust over and dat and stressed the\nstudio and so timing is everything and I\nknow there's going to be other projects\nthat will be on the horizon but you want\nto do a great job I'm personally so\ninvolved in every aspect of my business\nI'm in my studio every day providing the\ncreative leadership to the team I'm\ninvolved in the business I'm involved in\nso every aspect of the studio and so you\nreally have to uh kind of pick and\nchoose like the right time yeah how do\nyou trust that\nthe next project will come I think\nthat's so brave and thoughtful that\nyou're like look I want to do a great\njob I'm only going to take these few\nprojects I get it have to say no even\nthough I'm so in love with this but I\ntrust that the right projects will come\nhow did you kind of build that sense of\ntrust because I think a lot of us fear\nthat oh no maybe I'll never get an\nopportunity again if I miss this one so\nhow did you have that\nmore open mindset that yes I trust well\nbecause it came from um the mistake of\ntaking on at one point I took on a lot\nof work and I just remember just oh my\nGod I cannot wait for these projects it\nwas we were doing three hotels at one\ntime and some residential projects and\nso of course I'm like we're just going\nto hire more people but you have to be\nso in tune with your team and when you\nhave a lot of new team it takes like a\nyear or so for them to really get in\nsync with what's going on in the studio\nhow it operates what's the the the\nphilosophies and so making the mistake\nof taking on too much and I remember it\nwas a really like you know stressful\ntime and I was burning the midnight oil\nand uh you know and the team was and and\nthen you lose a team because they're\nburnt out and you know that's you know\nterrible and uh so so really from those\nmistakes I learned to uh to Pace myself\ndo you have a turn off when I sleep\nthat's good when sleep and I hit the\npillow so hard and I'm out and I have\nthe aura ring which I love so I know I\nsleep very well but um yeah when I sleep\nis when I completely turn it off and uh\nbut then I dream design I really I dream\ndesign it's amazing and I wake up and\nI'm like oh my God I wish I had turned\nthe corner to see like what was next or\nso uh but sleep and I go a million miles\na minute and I love it I would not have\nit any other way I love I'm not like a\ngreat person with a lot of free time I\nlove being busy I mean tell us about\nsome of your dreams do you have you ever\ninvented created curated in your dreams\nand taken something out of it or 100%\nlike there was um like the staircase\nactually in Austin I love that staircase\nlike that was like kind of a moment of\nsomething that that I dreamed about and\nand the pottery and it's kind of like\nnot something you would traditionally\nsee like a really big staircase in a new\nyou know contemporary\narchitecture and um so that was\nsomething that that I dreamed about and\nlike the other night I was having a\ndream that I was in a house and there\nwas like this really amazing light\nfixture that had all of these um um like\nuh strings of some sort with these small\nlittle uh lights and it was like really\nlike very artistic like it's in my\nmind's eye and we'll see where it comes\nup in in the design but yes I I do dream\ndesign I love that that's that's\nwonderful to hear because yeah it just\nshows how obsessed you are and how\nimmersed you are in the world that it's\nit's even happening in your dreams and\nthat staircase it's so it's so amazing\nthough and I love that it's dreamed to\ndesign also it's being visual because I\nsee so many images like all day because\nwhen we're doing concept presentations\nlike we're constantly curating images to\nhelp uh present our story and the\nconcept to to the client and so I just\nhave like this library of like images\nconcept L going through my head so I\nknow that obviously is the inspiration\nfor my brain mhm yeah and I love the\ndream to design\nbecause when I'm reacting to that\nstaircase people like Jay it's a\nstaircase relax but it really does spark\nso much joy like I look at it and I go\nwow like you know and so it's amazing\nhow design from your dream can actually\nspark moments of awe which are so nice\nto experience when you're just walking\naround doing your daily tasks you know\nso special sure I I want to ask you a\nquestion Kelly around artists valuing\ntheir work or even creatives or coaches\nor experts or whatever it may be I think\nso many of us and I get this question a\nlot Jay I don't feel confident enough to\ncharge what I think I'm worth like\npeople forget the amount of time they\ntrained people forget the amount of time\nthey worked it becomes really hard to\ncome up with an hourly rate or a project\nrate or a piece of art right I have\nfriends who are artists who are con L\nlike not knowing how to charge how did\nyou make sense of how you wanted to\nprice yourself and how do you encourage\npeople to figure out how they priced\nthemselves what things could they think\nabout in order to do that well it all\nhas to do with if you if you really want\nto be involved in the project for\nexample we just had this happen like\nthere's a really amazing project um\nthat's in Asia that you know I'd love to\nbe part of and our fee was too high and\nI know I'm going to be very involved but\nI really want to take the project and so\nthe client came back and was like how\ncan we make this work so I think it's\nlike\ncommunication and uh you know and really\nuh you know both parties valuing each\nother's worth and uh so I think just\nbeing in really you know great\ncommunication and we'll have uh you know\nsome emerging artists that I know are\nstruggling and they're just getting\nstarted and we want to bring them on to\na project as for a commission and um you\nknow we'll figure out ways like can we\ninternally help them get to a place\nwhere it's not going to be as time\nconsuming so I think there's really many\ndifferent ways that communication is key\nhow did you go\nabout creating\nyour first pricing structure because I\nfeel like when someone's starting out as\na creative as a designer as an artist\nthey can struggle so much with their\nself-worth and what their value is but\nthey don't want to miss out on the\nclient and so how would you encourage\nsomeone to think about pricing\nthemselves and how did you do it I\nreally wanted the job like my first\nproject I really wanted a job and as I\nsaid I didn't work for a design studio\nso I didn't know really how how to\ncharge and so I asked them I said what\ndo you feel comfortable paying me to do\nthis project and they told me and I was\nlike\nWow and and so I came back to them with\nsomething I found you know thought was\nfair and we met in the middle but I was\ndoing I really wanted the project and so\nyou know that is one of the projects\nthat I actually did the painting myself\nand if you know this is a stepping stone\nin your career then maybe you do take\nless for it I think you have to like\nlook at all the um the different factors\nin in how you charge and is it you know\nfor a friend is this going to be a big\nstep in your career or um or is this\nsomething that uh you know is going to\ntake a lot of time on your part and your\nteam's part and you have to charge\naccordingly yeah and I think that\nHonesty that's a that what you just\nshared there is really smart and I want\npeople to really listen to that is it a\nfavor for a friend is it a project\nbecause it's just so epic you don't get\nto do things like that is it actually\njust going to take a lot of your time\nand it's not that epic like it's just\nwork which level is it because that's\ngoing to affect how you price yourself\nand I'd also add that I found that when\npeople are coming up with their hourly\nrate they're usually thinking about how\nmuch an hour is worth but really it's\nnot about your hourly rate it's about\nthe hours it took to get there so for\nyou to learn the skills you have the\nhours it took for you to make it as\nsimple or as accessible or as useful as\nit did to that individual whatever it is\noffering of course it includes the hard\ncosts of materials and things like that\nbut really you're charging for how much\nsomeone values that time or effort or\nwork and in these circles it can be hard\nto understand and I think looking at\nother people that you aspire to be like\nor people that are in your Fields can\nhelp you find that middle ground but\nagain I love what you said about\nfiguring out where it ranks in the order\nof yeah and most clients and are like\nreasonable and if you if you really lay\nout like it's going to take me this\namount of hours or it's going to take a\nyear to get this done and it's like this\nyou know uh this much of a team and on\nalso the skill set because if you're if\nyou're going to bring someone on you\nknow that they have an incredible skill\nset they're going to save you time but\nthey're also going to save you money at\nthe end because a mistake is is money\nand so is it worth to pay someone up\nfront who knows exactly what they're\ndoing and how to operate absolutely that\nwas great Kelly it's been such a joy\ntalking to you today and I'm glad that\nwe've this has been a very unique\nepisode we've been reacting to beautiful\npictures in your book I've loved hearing\nabout your stories as well of just you\nknow the steps that it's taken to build\nthis phenomenal career that you're\nhaving and I love that you still feel\nlike you're just at the beginning which\nis such a great mindset to have but as\nyou know as a fan of the podcast we end\nevery episode with a final five and you\nhave to answer all these in one word or\none sentence maximum but I always\ndigress so let's let's start with the\nfinal five all right question one is\nwhat is the best design advice you've\never heard received or given\ndiversity of everything I'll let you\nexpand now diversity of\nscale of\neras materiality because you don't want\nto buy all your furniture in one place\nand so many people do they'll go to one\nplace and buy all their Furniture\nbecause they're in a rush and so\ndiversity is like so so important good\nadvice all right so don't don't buy\neverything from Ikea uh\ntrust me I I know yeah I've done that\nmany times all right got it uh second\nquestion what is the worst design advice\nyou've ever heard received or given that\na project has to be done in such a short\namount of time that you're forced to buy\neverything right now good advice because\nyou want to to curate everything over\ntime so it's meaningful I I made that\nmistake earlier this year and we didn't\nluckily I didn't go through with it but\nwith the house was finished and I wanted\nto do art and that's the thing you\nshould least rush but there was so much\na part of me that was like I'm just\ntired of looking at blank walls and I\nwant to feel inspired in this space and\nI like I was quickly looking at\nCollections and everything luckily my\nwife is the so I'm a very decisive quick\nperson and my wife is like really slow\nand will never make a decision if she\ndoesn't have to and so we balance each\nother out really well because I'll be\nlike yeah I think this will fit there\nand she'll be like no I don't think so\nand then we sit with it and I think this\nidea of sitting with things is such a\ngreat you you mentioned it multiple\ntimes in this conversation and I've\nlearned that skill through through\nworking on my own home that sitting with\nsomething is the most important thing\nbut often we think once we bought it and\nput it together we have to keep it and\nluckily there is a refund policy and a\nreturn policy you can give things back\nand I think it's it's interesting the\nidea of sitting with something is\nsomething we struggle to do we think\nonce we bought it we have to keep it or\nwe didn't buy it well everything just so\nfast now everything like just is like\ngoing a million miles a minute and you\nfeel like you have to get something done\nand it's such an exciting process of\nlike you're curating things that you're\ngoing to put into your home uh but um\nyou know Take the Long Road\nHome uh question three I know you do a\nlot of health and fitness is a big\npriority in your life in order to how\ndoes that that affect your creativity I\ncome up with a lot of ideas it's just\nit's unbelievable having just this it's\nactive meditation for me where I can\njust cleanse my my brain and uh and a\nlot of things come to me when I on to\nrun and uh and I love Dana as well yeah\nit's my Act of meditation and when you\ncreate this clear space in your brain it\nallows for creativity and is running\nyour main form of that or is and SW or\nare there others is that your yeah no I\ndo uh I do a little bit of everything I\nlike to change it up cuz you want to\nsurprise your body just like you always\nwant to surprise your audience you know\nit's the same thing with you and me and\nin design and uh so surprising your body\nis so important so I'll do Pilates uh\ncardio strength training like Mobility\nwork like a little bit everything and I\nlove playing tennis and uh also padel MH\noh I love padell padell is so fun p is\nso cool I keep missing your tennis\nparties I'm so so upset with myself I\nlove tennis too and whenever you invite\nme I'm out of town or traveling it makes\nme so sad we just put in a pedel court\nour house and it's so much fun it's such\na great like social um sport with the\nglass walls with the glass walls and we\nplayed the first time uh last year we\nwent to Brazil and they're all over\nthere and uh it's so much fun I got into\nit in Dubai and so Dubai's really taken\noff and then I played it in Miami but it\nhasn't taken off in La cuz pickle ball\nhas so I've been playing pickle ball but\npadel is we just this weekend met this\nguy who's a padel uh he's from Spain\nhe's like a padel expert he's a teacher\nand he told us there are 11 courts in in\nLos Angeles where they're like there\nwere people's homes there's actually one\nironically on Santa Monica like near um\nuh like by the Peninsula Hotel like a\nreally random place but it's such a it's\nsuch a fun Sport and I like it because\nit's a little more like skill and um uh\na little more challenging it's a little\nmore unpredictable than pickle ball for\nsure because you've got to be great at\nphysics to play padel have no idea it's\nlike chess it's like active chess it's\nlike so um yeah so fun and soal and\nreally uh social absolutely all right\nquestion four and five last two\nquestions question four what's the first\nthing you think about when you look at a\nspace to bring it to life what's outside\nthe window interesting walk us through\nthat it's like what is outside the\nwindow is so important because it's part\nof your Interiors like you have to look\nat it is it's like your first piece of\nart in the room so is it a tree is it\nanother building across the street um is\nit the mountains you know it's so\nimportant to to the space wow that I I\ndid not expect that there you go you\nknow and and how how do you use that to\ninfer what goes on inside well if we're\nselecting like we were working on a\nproject in New York and there was a\nterracotta building outside the window\nand so like and it was there were large\nWindows there was five of them that go\nacross um this elevation and so it's\nreally it's like a large piece of art in\nthe room so we need some something that\nreally um speaks to to the window and\nand the materiality on the building and\nso we had to consider it and um so it's\nit's really you know important part of\ndesign what are some of I'm digressing\nhere from the final five but what's what\nare some of the biggest mistakes you\nthink we make when it comes to setting\nup our spaces and our rooms what are\nsome things to avoid that people can\nlook out for like one thing that I love\nthat I think a lot of people um like for\nsmall spaces mirror goes so such a long\nway and it actually really feels good\nlike there's a great Fu in mirror and\nwhere it's placed is so important and uh\nit not only creates a window if you have\none window in your room like we're\nworking on a hotel project in like Tahoe\nand you know we're using you know really\nbeautiful mill work and incorporating\nmirror and like the transformation of\nthe room and what it does to the space\nis is unbelievable wow yeah that's a\ngreat note but but I would say too the\nthe furniture like really low seating\njust is makes your space seem so much\nmore expansive and lighting is so\nimportant and like one thing like we\nreally avoid is like just directional\ndownlights you have to be so uh careful\nthat they're not over seating areas\nbecause you know we have people and come\nto the hotel we want people to look like\ngreat and feel amazing and um so\nlighting is like really I think\nunderestimated and um should be really\nconsidered got it all right great aners\nall right Fifth and final question if\nyou could create one design law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be really I understand what\nyour style\nis and frequent museums and Galleries\nand go out and see what things say to\nyou because you're going to discover\nsomething that you didn't know was\ninside you that's going to make your\ninterior represent who you are I think\nthat's great life advice and design\nadvice it's it's knowing who you are and\nand and allowing\nenough input I definitely found that\nwhen when we moved from London to New\nYork and then from New York to LA it was\njust I just got exposed to so much more\nthan I'd ever been exposed to and that\nexposure is what also helped Define and\nedit who you were and who you wanted to\nbe so and you're constantly changing\nlike the more you see like I look at\nprojects I did 20 years ago and they're\nthey're great and but they're different\nthan how I would approach things now\njust taking your time it's like so so\nimportant and I go M A Million Miles a\nminute and I get excited about things\nand I want things to happen now and but\nreally it's like taking your time like\npace is\neverything well Kelly thank you for your\ntime today and thank you for being so\npresent and gracious and kind and thank\nyou for being so trusting of me I've\nloved having this conversation with you\nand I hope that everyone who's been\nlistening or watching has found some\ninspiration some spark some creativity\nto help enliven and and uh bring to life\ntheir spaces because I I really do\nbelieve design can make you happy I\nreally do believe that design and\nAesthetics in our spaces can Define how\nwe feel and how we move and the emotions\nthat we go through and so thank you and\ndesign Too Jay's something else about\ndesign that we're speaking that is is\nvery more aesthetic but it also makes\nour lives easier MH and that's something\nthat continues to get better and better\nand which is going to give us more time\nand so not only the aesthetic of design\nbut also the functionality which is\nreally you know critical give us an\nexample of that because that's a great\ngreat point and we didn't talk about\nthat tell tell tell us a bit more about\nhow we can think about our spaces\nfunctionally in order to make them\neasier as well what have you found or\nwhat little tips have worked for you for\nthat well in our studio we're actually\nuh working with AI and after uh like\nduring theid holidays and you know the\nfall when open AI um announced the the\nyou know generative uh intelligence and\nand what it can do uh I just listened to\na lot of podcasts and read up on it and\nI was like I'm going to implement this\nin my studio in some way and obviously\nyou can't go full force into it so I in\neach department I uh have like a\ndirector and we're using it uh every day\nand it's been like really profound and\nreally inspirational and it's not\ndesigned designing um spaces for us but\nit is actually generating ideas that we\ncan Implement into a project and\nsomething that maybe we never thought of\nand you know and I tell the team I'm\nlike listen this is like you have like a\njunior designer by your side that can\nhelp Implement and I'm super bullish on\nAI and what it's doing for my business\nis is unbelievable and we're only like\nat the surface and soon we're not going\nto have just a junior designer\neveryone's going to have a senior\ndesigner working for them and it's not\ngoing to take away what we do because\nyou got to have somebody driving the\nship but it's um it's fascinating and\nlove it yeah no I love hearing you\nEmbrace that because I think so many\npeople get scared like oh no like people\ncan just design their rooms by AI but I\nthink when you're confident and\nconscious of what you're doing what do\nyou think what parts do you think it's\ngoing to help replace and help solve\nversus what parts do you think you're\nlike well wait a minute my brain will\nalways be able to you know do this part\nuh it's just generating like idea\ngeneration but also like photosop and\nhow quickly that you can get things done\nnow so maybe we can take on a certain\namount of work a year but it's going to\nenable us to probably take on more\nprojects and be more efficient with our\ntime and then when you're more efficient\nwith your time your team's more happy\nbecause then they have free time so so I\nthink it's going to make are and this is\nI'm not an expert in AI I'm just telling\nyou how I'm using it um and my studio\nusing it but it's going to benefit us in\nso many ways and helping give us more\nfree time and idea generation which is\ngreat because it's like having a new\nperson on your team a new creative\nSpirit on a project every\nday which is is unbelievable it was just\nunbelievable yeah that's great I love it\nwell thank you again Kelly thank you so\nmuch so Wonder I hope you yeah you're\namazing and I and thanks for having me\nand I'm so happy to be here finally with\nyou and uh and you're uh you're amazing\noh you're so kind well I'm glad that we\nkeep uh deepening our friendship and I\nI'll never forget the FES when I met you\nand how how kind and sweet you were to\nme so thank you so much and I'm glad\nthat you know the book's available I'm\nglad that I'm glad that we're drinking\nfrom your classes this is this is\nspectacular these are beautiful I can't\nwait to shop the whole collection thank\nyou so much if you love this episode you\nwill enjoy my interview with Dr Daniel\naan on how to change your life by\nchanging your brain if we want a healthy\nmind it actually starts with a healthy\nbrain you know I've had the blessing or\nthe curse to scan over a thousand\nconvicted felons and over a hundred\nmurderers and their brains are very\ndamage"
