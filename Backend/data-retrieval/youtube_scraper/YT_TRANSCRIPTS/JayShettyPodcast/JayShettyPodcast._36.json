    "transcript": "a human being from the moment we're born\nwe're slowly cooking I know it sounds\nweird but it's true for example if you\nlook at the cartilage of babies it's\nwhite but if you look at the cartilage\nof somebody who's 100 years old the\ncartilage is brown we glycate we Brown\nas we age and so much so that glycation\nis actually pretty similar to aging and\nthen when we're fully glycated when\nwe're fully cooked when we're fully aged\nwe die"
