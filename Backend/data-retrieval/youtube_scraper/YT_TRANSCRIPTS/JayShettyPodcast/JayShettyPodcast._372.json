activists please welcome\nBecky G\n[Music]\nwhen you start in a career as young as I\ndid it's very much so like put your head\ndown get it done get it done get it done\nget it done and then you like blink and\nthen you're like oh snap I'm 26.\n[Music]\nbefore we jump into this episode I'd\nlike to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\neverything we all do is wanting to feel\nconnected right whether we're crying or\nwhether we're laughing or whether we're\nreaching out for help or we're reaching\nout to help like all of it almost seems\nto be a cry for connection we're all\nwanting to feel that and you've talked a\nlot about this concept of the 200 which\nis what this new album's based on your\nroots and I love that idea can you\nexplain it because\nit's the first time I'd heard about it\nin that way and I really really\nappreciate it yeah of course\nit's interesting to me how\nI was always like the 50 50. you know\nyou're half this half that and I didn't\nlike that there was something about that\nthat never sat well with me and I think\nit's because it made me feel like in\norder to be accepted here I have to give\nup a part of myself and in order to be\naccepted there I have to give up a part\nof myself and in reality it's like I am\nwho I am I shouldn't have to give up any\nof who it is that is my true authentic\nbeing to be accepted somewhere to fit\ninto this this space this shape right\nthat doesn't feel organic to me that\ndoesn't feel natural to me and it was in\nlittle like micro like experiences like\neven hanging around my cousins who were\nfrom Mexico and I'm telling me I was\nAmerican and I'm like well I guess\ntechnically yeah but like I I don't know\nwhen I'm in America they tell me that\nI'm Mexican so which one am I and\nthere's this uh this saying in Spanish\nyou know yeah you're not from here\nyou're not from there and then I would\nrespond to that and\nlike well in that case where do I stay\nlike where do I belong you know and so\nit's kind of like rewriting that to say\nlike No SI soy like I am I am from here\nand from there she's right\nyou know and it's kind of what inspired\num the the album esquina's because I am\nnot this side or that side of the\nstreets that raised me I am the corner\nof two flags two cultures two languages\nand I know I'm not the only one you know\nnot just within the Latin Community even\nbut I'd say and I have so many friends\nwho I mean I don't know about do you\nfeel like you have a 200 experience\nsometimes yeah well I love that that's\nwhy I love the way you put it and even\njust now the way you explain that is so\nbeautiful and elegant like it really\nresonates with me I love that idea about\nnot having to be half of this and half\nof that I actually experience it even\nmore in the roles I've played in the\nworld and so I often say to people that\nI'm as much\nthe monk mindset as I am the manager in\nmy work as I am the media person as I am\nnow a married person like all of that is\nme I'm not one or the other because I\noften get that where it's like well Jay\nyou used to be a monk and now you have\ncompanies and you're married and you're\nthis and that and I'm like yeah but the\ntwo things can co-exist for me as an\nidentity because there's so much from\nthat that I love and relate to and then\nthere's so much from this that I I love\nand relate to and again with being born\nin London but my parents are from\noriginally from India but then my\nmother's from Yemen and so there's so\nmany cross-sections in my background and\nthen I'm someone who's born and raised\nin London but now lives in L.A and so\nthere's that intersection and I love the\nidea of how we can all be so much more\nthan what our passport says or than what\nour job title says or then what our bank\nbalance says or whatever it may be like\nwe're all so much more so I think by you\nsaying that and I love the idea of the\nstreet corner yeah that's that's really\ncool because that's and all the cool\nstuff happens on the corner not on\neither side of the street anyway I mean\ntotally and if you're from La you know\nthat's where all the best fruit stands\nare and the best tacos things so\num but I I yeah it's the\nintersectionality that's what it is\nexactly what it is it's like where all\nof these things meet all the spaces in\nbetween you know and and I think that's\nthere's so much Beauty in it but I think\nunfortunately there's you know systems\nthat that make us think that they're\nwrong but in reality it's just an old\nprogramming that doesn't necessarily\nwork anymore and that's okay too you\nknow and I love\nwhat you said about letting you know all\nthe truths exist because that's\nsomething that I think growing up I felt\nSociety tells you how to think very\nblack and white and I'm like life is in\ncolor for a reason you know like we\nshould be seeing Life in Color there's\nso much going on around us and I like to\nthink that you know this vessel I'm very\nthankful for I'm very thankful for the\nvessel that allows me to experience this\nlife but my spirit is so much bigger my\nsoul needs to expand you know in the\nsame way we can experience such beauty\nwe can experience pain and there's all\nthese like opposites of everything and\nthen it's the spaces in between that\nkind of just tie it all together you\nknow I love that there's purpose in that\nhow did you go about that journey of\ngiving yourself permission to belong in\nboth\njust it\njust if we\nstay in that like uncomfortable position\nfor so long you know you're sleeping on\na plane yes and you're so tired like you\nwill fall asleep anyway but then there's\nlike that half hour that goes by when\nyou wake up and you're like my leg is\ndead and I can't feel my neck and it\nhurts and this is not like this isn't\ngood quality sleep like I can't wait\nuntil I get into my bed yeah and I felt\nlike I would feel that way sometimes\nlike I I could stay here for just a\nlittle bit you know but it didn't feel\nvery long lasting and I think that there\njust comes a time where if you allow\nyourself to and like you said give\nyourself permission to even just explore\nwhat could be on the other side to\nexplore that maybe I don't want to sleep\non the plane maybe I do want to sleep in\nmy bed and I can't right now and that's\nokay but I can't wait for the day yeah\nyou know or the time that comes\num and look forward to it and so I would\nalways look forward to like the day that\nlike I wouldn't be compared to like\nanother artist that like literally\nlooked nothing like me spoke nothing\nlike me and I'd be like I don't want to\nbe them I want to be Becky you know like\nand I was so young already feeling that\nway growing up in this industry and um\nand it was those boxes man it was those\nboxes that just like I I knew I could\ncheck them I knew I could check those\nboxes and and make other people happy\nbut there came a point I think when I\ndecided honestly to pursue singing\nSpanish music was that turning point for\nme and it was it was because I was going\nto be facing my biggest fear which was\nokay well I I am American and I've\nstarted a professional career singing\nmusic in English but I've always wrapped\nmy latinidad but now me singing in\nSpanish I don't know if I'll be accepted\nthere and that was like really scary\nbecause the only real point of reference\nI had was the queen Selena Quintanilla\nwho you know unfortunately is no longer\nwith us and so I just remember being\nlike there's a scene in the movie where\nher dad says\nyou have to be more Mexican than the\nMexicans the more American than\nAmericans it's exhausting and he says it\nlike that too it's exhausting and I'm\nlike yeah your girl's tired man I'm\ntired like I just want to be I just want\nto be who I am and the truth is is like\nI think when you lean into the\nauthenticity of just knowing like I\ngotta make myself happy and this this\nreally does make me happy\nthere's got to be something on the other\nside of that and little did I know I was\ngonna be confronted with so many other\nyou know obstacles in Latin culture that\ntotally didn't want me to succeed you\nknow the machismo that exists the amount\nof times you know the labels will say\nyou know girls don't sell tickets they\ndon't get played on the radio all kinds\nof stuff and and I like to think you\nknow we're here we're doing it so there\nmust we do something right you know\ndoing a lot right a lot right tell me\nabout that\nthat fear that you had in terms of like\nI've started my career singing in\nEnglish now I'm moving over will I be\naccepted yeah and that fear is really\ndisplacing too again when you're like\nI'm from here and I'm from there as well\nwhat was it inside of you that pushed\nyou to say I'm gonna do this anyway like\nwhat was it that gave you the courage\nand strength because I can imagine\nthere's so many people who are listening\nand watching right now\nwho are thinking I don't want to do that\nbecause I don't want to be seen that way\nor I don't want to do that because\nsomeone's going to put me in a box or\nsomeone's going to push me back like we\nall have these doubts in our own ways\nwhat was it that helped you overcome\nthat doubt I think remembering what\nsomeone like Selena did for me and\nunderstanding that like like somebody's\ngot to do it like and and not like so I\nnow I have to it really came from a\nplace of truly Desiring and wanting to\nto do that for myself because I know I\ndeserved that space in the same way I\nbelieve I deserved that space I believe\nthere's so many other talented young\nwomen that deserve that space and so you\nknow Brick by Brick and if I only bring\none brick to this to this bridge that's\nfine so be it but we we need it there\nisn't there's a need for this and and I\nwant to be a part of that and I think\nthat was really inspiring for me to be\nable to like take agency in that way and\nknow that there was a lot of like Nays\nstairs that were like not believing but\nthen also knowing like the same way I\nwas in that nurturing household where I\nwas allowed to be different like we're\ngoing to keep building spaces like that\nlike we need that in the systems that\nare you know continuing because they're\nnot sustainable some Somebody's gotta\nshake it up and so uh and I remember\nbeing a part of like specifically the\nLatin industry at that time and I think\nit was my intersectionality that that\nmade it kind of less intimidating for me\nbecause I was like I know what it's like\nto not be accepted here like because it\nhappened on the other side so there's\nnothing you can tell me here that I\nhaven't already heard yeah you know it's\nfascinating isn't it that when you're\nyoung you're forced to fit in and then\nas you get older it's all about how do\nyou stand out yep and it doesn't make\nany sense because it's so\ncounterintuitive your whole life you've\nbeen told stand in line do as they do do\nas I say and everyone's told to conform\nand as you get older it's like well how\ndo you brand yourself how do you Market\nyourself what's unique about you but\nyou've been told to hide all of your all\nof it uniqueness all right you've been\ntold to hide a little bit so it's almost\nlike we're trying to figure out what\nthat uniqueness is I love your idea\nabout or the vision that you just\npainted for all of us of like how we're\nall just laying another brick on the\nbridge yeah that's that's such a\nbeautiful way to think about it and I\nwonder how instrumental your grandfather\nwas in in this whole journey for you I\nknow that this album is inspired\ndedicated to and you sadly lost him a\nfew years ago but tell us a bit about\nwhy family's been so important to you\nbut particularly him and I can see you\ntaking it in for those who are not\nwatching you can yeah big deep breaths\nfrom Becky yeah no I think it's because\nI mean to understand that we come from\nsomething so much bigger than us is so\npowerful sometimes overwhelming I think\nfor a lot of us mixed ethnicity kids\nbecause you know we're we're not just\nwalking into a room with our dreams\nwe're walking into a room with our\ndreams and then the dreams of the\ngenerations before not just into a room\nwith our own sacrifices but the\nsacrifices of those before all of the\nstuff that you know can feel very heavy\nsometimes but then those two truths can\nexist at the same time that I really\nhear so strongly in in the back of my\nsubconscious which is that\nit can be really heavy but such an honor\nand there's a power in that to come from\npeople who have had to make something\nout of nothing and if they did you can\ntoo\nmy grandfather Miguel Gomez\nhe is one of the greatest men I think\nI've ever gotten to know in this life\nand I feel this way about all my\ngrandparents like to have had all four\nof my grandparents so present in my life\nand to be a part of the the village that\nraised me you know it's such an honor to\nme and when he passed away and him being\nyou know my first grandparent that I\nthat I lose\njust that that thing that I hold on to\nis that although again his vessel May no\nlonger be with me that guidance that\nthat honor that it is to carry that that\nsuperpower with me is just it's so\nincredibly motivating and so\ninspirational and I think there's\nthere's a lot there that when I look\nback at it you know he was really a big\npart as to why I started pursuing this\nbecause a lot of my grandparents I mean\nthey didn't finish their educations they\nall started working very very young and\nthat was the social Norm in Mexico you\nknow in Mexico like that that was part\nof you know part of what it was you\ndon't finish school you work to help\nyour family\nobviously we live in America and there's\nsuch thing as child labor laws so it\nwasn't the same thing for me but the\nconcept of being nine years old and\nworking to provide for my family and\ngoing out in the streets and hustling\nlike it didn't feel like a absolute no\nto me it felt like well if they did it I\ncan do it too you know and to see\neverything that my grandparents have\nbuilt I mean my grandmother talks about\nall the day she says\nlike her little village she's so\nthankful to God for her little village\nthat she created you know with my\ngrandpa and it's just like yeah like\ny'all really did that and and we're all\njust this ever-growing tree of branches\nand of those roots you know and so um so\nyeah he's he's with me every day I feel\nit that's beautiful yeah you can kind of\nsee that energy coming through you right\nnow as well it looks like it's evident\nthat he has a place in your heart that's\nreally deep and special and it must it\nmust be so powerful to be able to use\nthat to give back and to connect with\npeople definitely yeah and I think it's\nlike like it's their humanness you know\nit's seeing their old age like even\nseeing like they once could and now they\ncan't physically but we can you know so\nlike how do we carry that on it's just\nit's so beautiful and so empowering and\nso\num just knowing that even when we're no\nlonger here like things stay like\nthere's an energy there that stays\nthere's something so meaningful and so\npurposeful to our every word and\ninteraction shared it's just like you\nwant to live a life that is\nof substance yes you know like I don't\nwant to just lollygag and just you know\nI mean maybe every now and then don't\nget me wrong but um but no I mean it in\nthe way of just like even in the\nsimplest of things just like living in\ngratitude Becky you grew up in the\npublic eye and\nyou know you've grown up in the public\neye too and it's the idea of growing up\ngrowing up yeah growing up yeah growing\nup\nin the public eye what would you say\nhave been\nthe pros of that like what really great\nlessons have you kind of Taken on and\nwhat have been some of the challenges\nthat you're still trying to figure out\nthat you still feel you struggle with\nsometimes yeah I think it's interesting\nI don't think I saw many of the cons to\nit as a kid because I was just like wow\nlike this is so cool a space to just be\nand be yourself and they don't really\nrealize how you're exposing yourself\nlike beyond what then the average person\nlike usually gets exposed to and it's\nnot just like the support it's also the\nopposite of what support is right people\nhaving a a thought and a say or an\nintention that isn't always positive\nagainst everything that you do and it\nwasn't until you you were like a\nteenager and you're getting made fun of\nfor the way you dress or what your teeth\nlook like or having acne or whatever and\nyou're like wow you're really wearing\nthese things like you're really wearing\nit and then you know on top of that\nyou're dealing with I mean for me I was\ndealing with you know the pressures to\nprovide for my family so like I'm really\nshowing up as my best self because\nthere's too much writing on the line\nit's not just me it's everybody who's\nwalking in the room with me so when you\nare kind of put in this place where you\nare you feel almost attacked sometimes\nor you know you feel let down you don't\nfeel as supported as you thought you\nwould you start to question like oh is\nthis a safe space is this is this what\nit's supposed is this what I signed up\nfor because that's what everybody's\ntelling me this is what you signed up\nfor this is what you signed up for\nand it's like as I've I've continued to\ngrow up in this space I think the\nbiggest like lesson for me is just like\nmaybe I'm not supposed to be liked to\nfight everybody maybe that's not the\ngoal you know maybe I'm not maybe I'm\nnot supposed to be for everyone maybe I\ncan be a little bit more sacred with my\nenergy you know maybe I don't have to be\non social media 24 7. you know like\nmaybe I can remember that there's a real\nworld out there with real people and\nquality connection matters not the\nquantity of connections I make and so I\nthink that like for me going from\nliteral baby Becky 14 years old getting\ndiscovered on the internet to the 26\nyear old that is still figuring out how\nto practice those boundaries every\nsingle day yeah it's like the the\nbiggest takeaway for me yeah and that\nrealization that\nwe're not for everyone is really\ndifficult to swallow because I feel like\nour whole life\nwe've been trained to kind of be\npeople who make everyone around us happy\nwe've been trained to be that way\nconditioned like we make people smile or\nyou are The Peacemaker in your family or\nyou were the change maker in your family\nor you were the person who kind of you\nknow communicated individually and\nmediated with your family like we've all\nplayed roles and most of those roles\nrevolve around us being liked or doing\nthings to be liked and all of a sudden\nyou grow up and especially if you have a\nlarge public platform and even if you\ndon't have a large public platform just\ngrowing up you go to work and you're a\nfamily it's crazy because I was\nliterally gonna gonna interject right\nthere to say you do not have to be\nsomeone with a platform like ours to\nknow what this pressure is like today\nagree and that actually makes me so\nfearful for the future Generations\nbecause we are constantly comparing\nourselves to everyone's greatest hits\nand that is really really hard to leave\nany room any space for Grace\nfor for growth you know because there's\nthis fear this fear of messing up saying\nthe wrong thing or whatever and it's\njust like that's actually part of\nlearning we have to leave room to learn\nand I think it's also learning that we\ncan be something different\nI was thinking about this the other day\nand I had a conversation with like a\nreally close friend of mine about how\nit's it's wild to me that I've shared so\nmuch of my life on the internet since\nsuch a young age and because I shared\nthat you know my favorite flavor of ice\ncream seven years ago was chocolate that\nsomeone can come across that today and\nbe like oh she's a she's a chocolate ice\ncream loving girly and like little do\nthey know like I don't really like ice\ncream anymore like I don't even have a\nfavorite flavor I actually prefer frozen\nyogurt you know and and there's like\nseven years but because someone can come\nacross that you know today it can be\nlike no that's who she is and unless\nit's documented\nyou can't tell me any different yeah you\nknow but it's like I think it's it's\nleaving space that like I can change my\nmind I mean I could love ice cream\ntomorrow who knows you know and that's\ntotally possible but on a deeper level\nit's interesting you were you were\nsaying something there's a book that I\nread called the family on Bradshaw and\nit really blew my mind about the rigid\nroles that we play in like family\nsystems and we find so much purpose in\nthat but then we we get so attached to\nwhat that role is to forget that like we\nhave to go out into the world and like\nlearn more you know like it terrifies me\nsometimes when I think about that\nbecause I feel like I've lived so much\nlife in my 26 years and I'm like wait\nthere's more you're telling me there's\nmore I should be inspired and excited at\nthat idea and a part of me is but then\nthere's another part of me that's\nabsolutely terrified you know and I\nthink it's it's again leaving room for\nthose two truths to exist yeah and\nusually when it's terrifying I think\nit's because it's right for you yeah\nyeah you know what I mean like it's\nsupposed to be scary like just at least\njust a little bit to like ignite that\nthing in you that really like catches\nyour soul on fire and says I was made\nfor this yeah you know and I'm so happy\nthat I did it yeah you know yeah how\nhard was it for you you just talked\nabout there where you're like maybe I\nwant to be someone who experiences the\nreal world maybe I do want to switch off\nfrom social media like as a public\nfigure and even in our friend circles\nlike I remember when I quit drinking\nalcohol\nand when I went back to my friend group\nthat was used to me drinking alcohol and\nbeing a certain person at the party and\nnow I don't it was a complete switch I\nwasn't I didn't have a public platform I\nwasn't known but even in my group or my\ncommunity it was like wait a minute Jay\nhave you changed right or when I stopped\ndoing certain things and when I started\ndoing certain things we all go through\nthese like identity deaths of who we\nwere and who we wanted to be to who we\nare today and when you're trying to make\na transition like not being as active on\nsocial media or you're trying to make a\ntransition of I don't go to those places\nanymore whatever it may be I feel we all\ngo through this moment of identity\nshifts and it sounds like you've had to\ndo that too what has helped you make\nthose as smooth as they can be or what\nhas happened when you've made those\nshifts and what have you dealt with I'm\nlaughing because Jay it's so not smooth\nlike it's not yeah it's so rough out\nhere it's very new for me it is so new I\nhave lived more of my life this way than\nI have practicing trying something new\nbut it makes me very proud of myself to\nknow that I can look at myself every day\nin the mirror and say I know it's going\nto be really hard and it's gonna be\nchallenging and there's going to be\nthings that trigger a response from you\nmaybe that you are that is second nature\nwe are gonna take time to process we're\ngonna add some filters in your process\nthat are better for you because there's\nbetter ways to deal with things there's\nbetter ways than having to just like\npromote your pain you know I somebody\nthe other day it was so funny somebody\nthe other day uh mentioned to me like\nwhat's up with all these young kids\nposting videos of themselves crying on\nthe internet and I said first of all\nthat's really mean because little do you\nknow maybe they're singing for\nconnection and second of all I've\ntotally done that\ndamn it oh I'm guilty I'm so guilty of\nit but are there times where I wish I\ndidn't absolutely because maybe not\neverybody needed to see that I wanted to\nbe seen so badly but who am I seeking\nthat from why am I seeking that from the\nworld when maybe it's really Within\nMyself And so that that daily practice\nfor me is still very new but it's it's\ndoing things differently willing to\nwhat's that saying\num you you won't you got to be willing\nto do something you've never done in\norder to get the result you've never had\nright and so if I want to be the\nhealthiest version of myself I have to\nbe willing to look at my daily routines\nmentally routine the mental routines\nthat I have the spiritual routines that\nI have the physical routines that I have\nand and and really just be honest with\nmyself and am i setting myself up for\nsuccess you know and there's been hard\ntimes like people very close to me would\nbe like be we had this conversation\nwe've had this conversation and they\nvery lovingly hold space for me to come\nback around and be like you're right\nyeah you're so right you know but it's\nlike just understanding that we are\nconstantly always in process yeah yeah\nwe're let's walk through some of those\nactually because we love doing that one\non purpose you mentioned mental\nspiritual and physical routines let's\ntalk about some of the let's start with\nthe mental routines what are some daily\nroutines or habits or practices that\nyou've been working on okay so shout out\nto my therapist because she taught me\nthe three little therapists I love\ntherapists me too they're dope\num they keep it real that's for sure but\nuh the three-legged table is the Mind\nBody Soul and if it's a table that needs\nto work right it needs to hold things on\ntop of it\num if one of the tables is a little\nwobbly or one of the tables the legs\nbreak it can't it can't fulfill its\npurpose right what it what it's intended\nfor and so I am very much so a Mind Body\nSoul kind of person and I think for me\nif we're starting with the mind just\nlike not being on my phone the first\nmoments that I wake up in the morning\num I didn't realize like how second\nnature was\nlike even just having like a separate\nalarm clock outside of my phone\nvery new for me actually just started\npracticing that I do a social media\ndetox once a month so like there's I'll\nliterally delete the apps from my phone\ncompletely and it's the best for how\nlong for how long I do at least seven\ndays wow constantly yeah wow that's so\ncool yeah also very new but it's working\nhighly recommend and I don't say these\ndays to like knock anyway because\nthere's some people I know that can like\nvery much so be on these platforms and\nlike are so unfazed by it and it's great\nfor them and I love that for them but I\nknow myself yeah and I'm very very\nsensitive so kind of just just\npracticing those things has been super\nhelpful for me on the on the mental side\nand then I would say on the spiritual\nside meditating has done so much for me\nlike meditation and prayer I think just\nbelieving and having faith in something\nthat is greater than you is is always\nhelpful you know I think it's really\nhard to trust something that you can't\nsee that you can't physically feel or\ntouch but there's all also something\nvery magical when you tap into that and\nthere's been moments where my day will\nbe so crazy and I you know this is\nconstantly trying to find time how do we\nreset the mind how do we reprogram and I\njust think to myself even after 10\nminutes of meditation there's another\nversion of me on the other side of that\nthat will be so much better so much\ncapable what part of me can't give\nmyself 10 minutes today so like that\nthat spiritual like tap in and like\nre-centering for me is\nspecial sauce and what type of\nmeditation is that for you what what\nguided meditation still for me because\nwe've got a lot of thoughts these days\nyou know and it's hard to silence them\nbut uh it's sometimes twice a day you\nknow I I try to do it twice a day\ndefinitely in the morning or sometimes\nwhen I'm in the sauna like post-workout\num to kind of just really be in my body\nand then uh and then at night and I also\ndo uh uh do you know Wim Hof yeah of\ncourse yeah yeah love it we've had room\non the show oh my God yeah another\nperson I would like absolutely geek out\nto me but honestly that that whole\nroutine for me even like before shows\njust really relaxes the nervous system\non that breath hold there's like a\nspiritual feeling that I have and\nsometimes I'll play like frequency\nduring and it just like there's moments\nwhere I'm like oh my God I'm totally\ncoming out of my body right now and this\nis so nice wow yeah and what about\nprayer you mentioned prayer there yes\nyeah prayer is super important it's\nfunny I grew up in a very religious\nhousehold I'm very Mexican in that sense\nmy grandmothers are very Catholic and\nI'm much more spiritual than religious\nI'd say but I think seeing them in their\ndedication seeing them in their practice\nwas like very inspiring to me when I was\nyounger and also the communal aspect of\nit too like getting to pray with my\ngrandmothers growing up is something\nvery sacred to me and I just think that\nyeah when I pray and I Surrender like\nlike going like God is like I literally\nhave it tattooed because it's it's\nimportant to know that you can't control\neverything you just can't you can\ncontrol what you do how you react to\nwhat's going on around you but you can't\nactually control everything that's\nhappening around you and I struggle with\nthat on a daily basis well said yeah I\nthink you know it those are beautiful\nroutines that's mental and spiritual\nwhat about physical there is not a\nversion of me before this this I'd say\nage that would say I love being in the\ngym I love working out\num so much the point where I'm like\nmaybe I should prioritize sleep a little\nbit more than the gym but um good sleep\ngood diet\ngym like feeling strong physically and\nknowing that I'm taking care of my body\nagain like the The Vessel needs to be\nsafe and it needs to be protected and\nprovided for and and so I try my\nabsolute best\num but even in that sense it's like you\nknow not that my indulgent self takes\nover but like enjoying the little things\nin life like the balance you know like I\nlove food so the balance of that is like\nyou go burn it off in the gym girl and\nyou'll be just fine I love that no and\nit's so beautiful that you're thinking\nabout your life as those three legs to\nthe table or the stool in your life\nbecause\nit is so interesting to me about how as\nsoon as you take your eye off of one of\nthem how much harder everything else\nbecomes And yet when those three things\nare good like you said they can carry\nthe weight even if it's getting really\nreally heavy yeah you still have this\nFighting Chance almost and I guess\nthe thing that\nI found that has really helped me in\nthat regard as well is making sure that\nI'm not trying to solve all three at the\nsame time it's almost like one at a time\nlike I remember I always had my\nspiritual practice and then I added my\nmental practice and then I added my\nphysical practice and for me that order\nworked really well whereas when you're\ntrying to solve all three at the same\ntime then two it's almost like saying if\nyou're putting a table together using\nyour analogy you can't put all three\nlegs on at the same time it just doesn't\nwork that way you got to put one in\nproperly then the other one and then the\nother one I want to go back to something\nyou said earlier\nyou talked about the need for Quality\nConnections instead of quantity\nconnections what is Becky G's definition\nof a quality connection how do you view\na quality connection you know I think\nit's it's when I feel safe in a room to\nbe my true authentic self\nand there's ways that my body used to\ntell me that that like this isn't\nauthentic like there's something about\nthis that doesn't feel right and I would\nstay in the room because you're scared\nof how that might come off or again the\npeople-pleasing Tendencies totally start\nto come through right yeah I'm a\nperformer by Nature at this point\nbecause I've been doing this for longer\nthan I've ever not been doing it but I\nthink it was just really understanding\nman like it feels really good when I can\njust show up and be me\nand\nwhen I'm trying to be my authentic self\nsometimes there's a little fumbling that\nhappens or just sometimes it flows like\nright now this feels like a quality\nconnection it's just flowing I'm not\nreally thinking about what could be said\nor what could be felt and how that might\ncome off and that feels to me again\naside from the universe and it really\naffirms that I'm exactly where I'm\nsupposed to be and so when I have those\nfeelings that feel very affirmed in a\nmoment that is quality connection and it\nmight be with the stranger there's been\ntimes where like I mean man I'll be at\nthe airport sometimes just killing time\nbecause I'm totally like my grandparents\nI don't want to be late for a fight or\nsomething and I'm just talking to like\nthe person behind the bar and just like\nhow's your day today and I walk away\nlike oh my God Johnny was so sweet I\nwant to go to his mom's pizza shop like\nnext time I'm in the city I'm coming\nbecause there's like a true connection\nthat's being made and I think what we\ncelebrate today is like followers like\nhow many followers you have how many\nnumbers you have streaming this and it's\nlike that I I think is is is amazing\nwhen you're thinking from a business\naspect but even then truly like people\nwant to support something that is real I\nwant to support something that is real\nwhether it be in my friendships whether\nit be with my family with my team with\nmy fans and so uh yeah I'd say that's\nwhat it is it's like that authenticity I\ncould feel it yeah yeah and it's really\ninteresting right you said that we\nalmost all have a inner\nCompass or an inner\ndial that tells us whether something\nfeels authentic and aligned or it\ndoesn't but we tend to ignore it\nsometimes because of our people pleasing\nTendencies or whatever it may have been\nwhen is the time in your life where you\nfeel like you've ignored it and it's\nmisled you or it's LED you away from\nfeeling how you feel now where you feel\nsafe in yourself yeah I definitely feel\nso reflective on like certain career\nmoments where it was very easy for me to\nlet other people make decisions for me\nand then and then when it wouldn't work\nbe like ah I should have said something\nyou know oh why didn't I say oh but\nthere wasn't enough time\nthere just wasn't enough time we just\nand and realizing like man I spent some\nkey pivotal moments in my career\nfeeling like I was being far more\nreactive to what was happening than like\nproactive and setting myself up to like\nfully be present you know and I look\nback at it and I'm like I'm very proud\nof myself for having made it through\nthose moments but like there was moments\nwhere and and this is like even deeper\non like the uh the experiences I used to\nhave with like anxiety and panic attacks\nyou know I didn't know that that was\nlike my body physically telling me\nsomething's wrong like you're not okay\nbut because you're scared to let other\npeople down you're scared of what other\npeople might say you push through\nanyways\nand I realize like just because you can\ndoesn't mean you should\nand I think that that's one of my most\nvaluable lessons for sure because there\nwas I mean many moments before going on\nto a stage and\nI mean we're talking full-blown tears\ncan't breathe if you've had a panic\nattack you know the world is ending and\nthere's also this like subconscious part\nof you that's like girl breathe just\nbreathe you know you know what this is\nyou know but your nervous system can't\ntell the difference between like the\nmental bear and the real bear that's in\nthe room and there's no bears in the\nroom so like chillax it's okay you know\num yeah just being really young and in\nreally high stress situations like you\nknow you're everybody's boss but\ntechnically everybody's older than you\nand it's just such an interesting\nDynamic to have grown up in and so I\nthink that that has been the most\nvaluable lesson for me up until this\npoint you know just like yeah just\nbecause you can doesn't mean you should\nyeah that's good advice yeah well said\nwhen you're doing my people pleasing\nthere and that naturally happens in\nenvironments where like you said even\nthough you're the boss everyone's older\nthan you it's it's natural to want to\nplease our elders in the same ways we\ntry to please our parents in our family\nand I know you've worked a lot on\ntherapy and that's an area of your life\nyou've invested in deeply\nhow is therapy or what work have you\ndone in therapy that's helped you\nidentify your people pleasing Tendencies\nand allow you to start reframing and\nreshaping them because I think so many\nof us often work so hard at pleasing\npeople that we end up\ndispleasing and disconnecting from\nourselves and we don't realize that in\nthe attempt to make someone else happy\nwe're making ourselves more unhappy and\nmiserable miserable yeah and the other\nperson's not happy either because they\ncan tell that it's not it's not coming\nfrom an authentic genuine place it's\njust coming from a place of like I don't\nwant to cause any trouble so what's some\nof the work that you've done or what\nsome of the lessons that you've been\nable to illuminate about your triggers\nand where they come from and reframing\nhow the people how to move away from\npeople please yeah well like I said it's\ndefinitely like a daily practice for me\nbut I think a lot of the first I would\nsay like the first two years of therapy\nfor me were very reactive to what was\nhappening in real time I wasn't really\ncomfortable with the idea of shining a\nspotlight on what the root cause of\nanything was you know it was very\nambiguous in the sense of like it's got\nto be this this is because this happened\nand so going back to like the the\nreactiveness of the first two years for\nme is is funny because yeah there was a\nlot of small fires that I had to put out\nin that moment it was a very high stress\ntime in my career in my personal life\nwhen I had first started therapy but I\nthink when I really surrendered to the\nfact that this goes so much deeper than\njust what's happening around me but it's\nlike how I exist in all of it like that\nis when I was like oh yeah this Cisco's\na lot deeper and a lot of it is you know\nchildhood stuff and when I think about\nyou know big part of my childhood was\nalso shared in an industry that you know\nmy parents were very very young they\nknew nothing about it like quite\nliterally and and even then I like to\nthink I came out kind of okay but but\nyou know like they they couldn't really\nprotect me from much when it came to\nthat stuff and then the fact that they\nwere young parents when they got married\nand and had children like they were\nbabies raising babies and so there was a\nlot of things I had to like learn from\nmyself and teach for myself and so I\nthink having a lot more empathy for\nmyself was like a big step in therapy\nbecause it was hard for me to accept the\nfact that I went without things like\nwhat do you mean but we tried our best\nbut we did what we had to do I did what\nI had to do there was just so much\nresistance to the fact that I still\ndidn't get what I really needed and so I\nthink when you can just come from that\nspace of empathy and compassion for\nyourself that like everybody really was\ntrying you really were trying and it\nstill came out a little short but hey\nit's not too late like you can still\nlearn you can still learn you know and\nthat was like I would say yeah third\nyear of therapy and that's crazy because\nyou're right it's invest Smith and even\nthen I mean some of the the types of\nwork that I do you know I think when you\ntake inventory\non your life you know like really taking\ninventory on what your relationships\nwith the people around you in your life\nlook like and felt like from the moment\nyou were born to this current day\ninventory on memories you know\nexperiences that you've had in your\nRecollections of them and then also kind\nof revisiting those with those people\nand being like hey what was your\nexperience like in this you know it's\nthe trippiest thing for me and my\nsiblings because I'm like we let us have\nthe same parents grow but the same four\nwalls around us and we're all so\ndifferent yeah and we all process so\ndifferent right so going back to an even\nthe deeper level of compassion and\nempathy holding space for each other in\nthat way so beautiful yeah we didn't get\nto really doing that until we went into\nfamily therapy together so thankful for\nthe resource and opportunity to do that\nbecause there's there's a lot of times\nwhere I'm like man like we things could\nhave gone one or another way and we kept\nchoosing you know family and we got to a\npoint where like choosing family this\nride or die mentality of like oh you\nknow like why do we have to ride or die\nwhy can't we just be you know like\nnobody's gonna ask that question and I\nwas the big sister who was like you know\nparentified so I was like I'm their\nparent they're my and they're like we\njust want you to be our big sister we\ndon't need you to be our mom or our dad\nand I'm like what do you mean I have to\nbe it was like all those rigid roles and\nstuff so taking inventory was super\nhelpful for me it gave me so much\nperspective and then recently I started\ndoing like Parts work which we were\ntalking about all the parts you know\nlike oh there's a part of me that's\nstill a child I'm still freaking Afraid\nof the Dark I the amount of times I\ntravel and I'm alone in my hotel room\nand I'm like I'm gonna sleep with the TV\non just so it feels like somebody's here\nbecause it's a little scary in here\num that's a part of me you know that's a\npart of me that's still trying to figure\nfigure things out still feels a little\nlonely the stuff is a little lost\num there's the Boss part of me that\nfeels super empowered and feels like\nsuch a Visionary over the career that\nI've built from myself and excited to\nlike continue to attack these like parts\nof the industry that quite literally\nneed to just be broken down you know so\nmore of more of me can get in there when\nI say more of me I mean other powerful\nwomen who have you know so much talent\nand so much just to offer in these\nspaces yeah it's it's beautiful I love\nthe parts work yeah no and it's so\nbeautiful to hear someone talk about it\nso thoroughly and thoughtfully and I\nthink when you can articulate something\neffectively it means you're more likely\nto be able to process it up here yeah\nright when you connect the feeling part\nyeah though that's that's the other part\nbecause I really I learned this from\nmyself it's like Becky you're really\ngood at intellectualizing your feelings\nbut do you feel them\ncue the tears like I on purpose\nsometimes have to like get myself to\nthat space to release because the body\nkeeps count the body keeps score of all\nof what you go through so you can be\nlike yeah I was really stressed I really\nis if you don't allow your body to feel\nit somatically like that's the other\nthing that for me I think I find myself\nlike that's was the manifestation of the\npanic attacks and things like that like\noh right anxiety depression they're not\nthe diagnosis they're the result of\nthat was like whoa big knowledge for me\nbecause I was like oh yeah I just have\nanxiety and depression it's normal like\nI just have panic attacks all the time\nlike no your body is telling you\nsomething you are processing something\nthat you aren't letting your body feel\nyou know\nit's again a hard reality because\nallowing yourself to feel it again is it\nalmost goes back to that giving\npermission like just giving ourselves\npermission to feel giving ourselves\npermission to process something giving\nourselves permission to allow for this\nParadox to exist when was the last time\nyou cried this morning yeah yeah that's\nwhy I'm not crying right now\nno truly truthfully speaking it was this\nmorning\num it's such a stressful time you know\nand it's a it's a time where I feel like\nin my career\nit's funny to me I'm like I can walk off\na stage and feel like oh I want to do\nthat all over again and then leading up\nto a performance I'm like why do I do\nthis to myself this is torturous\num and I know but I I like to think that\nuh I I always regret not working out I\nnever regret the workout and so I tried\nto think about that way in my life like\noh I gotta do hard thing I was designed\nto do hard things you know but even then\nacknowledging that it's hard is super\nimportant because then you can have that\ncompassion and empathy for yourself but\nif you don't acknowledge that it can be\nvery challenging you're not gonna leave\nany room for that compassion and that\nempathy that you need to have for\nyourself in order to do those hard\nthings and so yeah your girl is crying\nit was a full moon it was it was all\nkinds of things but it was good it was a\ngood cry like it's not always like a sad\ncry sometimes it's like a a release like\na sense of relief you know yeah it's\nreally interesting that if someone's\nnatural reaction to something was to\nlaugh we'd see that as normal but when\nsomeone's natural reaction to something\nis to cry we see that as wrong or it's\nlike stop crying everything will be okay\nwe'd never say to someone stop laughing\neverything will be okay right or\neverything thing is okay like it's\nreally interesting to me which emotions\nwe allow for in society and which\nemotions we try and block others and\nourselves from having and I find that\nthe more we try and stop others from\nhaving a certain emotion it's usually\nbecause we block that in ourselves for a\nlong long time and I love that you cried\nthis morning and that was a release for\nyou and it was helpful for you and it's\npowerful yeah I think it's and I'm so\nglad you shared that with us today as\nwell because at the moment we're\nexperiencing a really vibrant abundant\nwith your frequency and the interesting\nthing is when you were crying you were\nstill vibrant and abundant like we\nshouldn't see that as not that right\njust because it looks different yeah\ndefinitely and I think it's like it goes\nback to like those core those core\nemotions you know really understanding\nlike again what are the symptoms of\nthose core emotions and when I'm feeling\nthis anxiety when I'm feeling is it\ncoming from a place of fear and do I\njust need to talk about it or am I\nexperiencing such great joy that my body\nreally doesn't know how to receive this\nright now you know or am I experiencing\nboth because there's two things going on\nat the same time\num and and I think it's doing that that\ncheck in with yourself that's super\nimportant making time for it you know\nlike I genuinely made time to cry today\nand I'm very proud that I did that\nbecause I would be crying right now\nwhich would have been totally fine as\nwell but uh but I think it's also such a\nit's such a sacred practice for me not\ncrying but just checking in with myself\nthat to be able to know how to do that\nand support myself in that way instead\nof seeking it\nagain in a space of validation when it\nfeels too late and more reactive\num or from people who maybe don't know\nhow to do that for me it feels\nempowering to know oh I I got me I\nalways got me you know ah I mean if we\ncould all just feel like I've always got\nme and we don't all the time like I said\nit's it's a it's a it's a daily practice\nto make that effort and even then I fall\nshort you know I fell in charge even for\nfriends and family members of mine and I\nthink that's that's when our human\nreally shows you know like there's that\nwindow of Tolerance and we can try to\nexpand it as much as possible but\nthere's still a window you know like\nit's still a window and some days it's\nthis big and some days it can be this\nbig\num and so it's just like acknowledging\nand then expressing that too just\nletting everybody know hey my windows my\nwindows really small today it's Becky's\nsize\num or sometimes it's just like yo my\nwindow is Big we should fit a whole\nhouse to that thing you know everybody\nbring come on in yeah it's nice to just\nbe able to Vibe check like that yeah and\nthat's that daily as you use the word\ninventory that daily check-in of like\nwhere am I at how am I feeling what can\nI offer is today a internal day or an\nexternal day like I I do that all the\ntime too there are certain days where I\ncan literally be there for anyone and\neveryone and I am this outward person\nand then there are days where I just\nwant to be alone and be in silence and\nStillness and being able to accept that\nthey're both one and the same thing yes\nthat one is not a better expression of\nme and one is not a worse expression of\nme I think we still live in this world\nof what's right and wrong and better or\nworse good or bad I can't that's what I\nmean about the black and white thinking\nthat I was talking about earlier and uh\nwhat's that story there's a story about\nthe man and he says well we'll just have\nto wait and see basically\num\nis he like a father and his son and this\nthing happens and then they're like oh\nI'm so sorry and he's like well we'll\nsee you know we'll see and it actually\nyou know there's so many things that you\nthink are a bad thing right\nquote-unquote bad thing that are\nhappening but in reality it's a good\nthing and uh and then maybe maybe it\nturns out to not be a good thing you\njust never know you know but I like to\nthink uh that everything happens for you\nnot to you like that is my that is my my\nmojo these days everything is happening\nfor me not to me and it's interesting\nhow you're the way you exist in those\nspaces will actually shift because you\nrealize oh this is in my favor\nI'm supposed to learn something from\nthis you know I'm supposed to like gain\nsomething from this and that's why the\nwhole concept of failure and success\nlike navigating this industry since such\na young age there's songs of mine that I\nlove that I thought deserved to be the\nnumber one song and they're probably\nlike the lowest streaming whatever you\nknow but it's like what it means to me\nis a win like that is a success to me\nthat's not a failure you know and so\nit's like redefining what what success\nmeans to you uh redefining what\ngreatness is it's redefining what all of\nthe the stuff that life has to offer and\nsaying No this is happening for me not\nto me for me I just think it's so yeah\nyeah for anyone who's wondering the\nstory that Becky was referring to which\nplease encapsulate in that point it's a\nbeautiful Zen story about a man and his\nson and the man buys his son a horse\nwell actually his son finds a horse I\nbelieve and comes home riding this\nbeautiful horse and all the villagers\nare like wow this is amazing like he's\njust so incredible that he could tame\nthis Wild Horse and now he's writing in\nlook how elegant it is\nand the man said the father says good\nthing bad thing who knows or maybe let's\nsee and then the next thing that happens\nis that the sun's riding the horse and\nthen he gets thrown off the horse and\nwhen he gets thrown off the horse his\nleg gets fractured and he has to have an\noperation and surgery and whatever else\nand everyone in the village it's like oh\nmy God this is the worst thing that's\never happened oh no oh no no and the man\nsays good thing bad thing who knows or\nmaybe let's see and then after that they\ncome and recruit everyone in the village\nto join the Army because they've got to\ndefend themselves but this guy can't go\nand everyone's like you're so lucky your\nson's not going because his leg's broken\nall of our sons have gone we're gonna\nmiss them and the man says good thing\nbad thing who knows or maybe let's see\nand it continues that way that it's and\nit's really hard in the moment to live\nthat way because when it feels like\nbecause our mind has been trained in\nthat good and bad when something bad is\nhappening it feels like nothing good can\ncome from it and the interesting thing\nis when something good happens we're\nalso equally convinced nothing bad can\ncome from this and the truth is those\ntwo moments can switch so quickly and\nI've been at the intersection of both of\nthem in my life and I've just found that\nnot seeing things as good or bad but\nseeing them is just learning and lessons\nand healing and growth\nand what you just said which is that\nit's all about what's happening for us\nif we can just live in that way it's\nbetter than the dichotomy of good and\nbad positive and negative ugh Jay Shetty\nladies and gentlemen\nI just yeah yeah I mean you definitely\ntold the story better than I did no no\nI'm just filling in the gaps no but I\nreally appreciate you going into that\nthat much detail because I think that is\nI I wish that for the the future\ngenerations to really know that to\nreally know that there is no such thing\nas as good or bad there's just you just\ndoing doing what you can do for yourself\nwhatever that looks like you know and\nand unfortunately I think what happens\nfor a lot of Youth that grows up in you\nknow communities like the ones I grew up\nin it's like we're doing a lot of things\nthat we were never taught\nyou know like we were doing a lot of\nthings that we were never taught and so\nthere's a lot of like self-doubt that\nCreeps in there's a lot of shame that\nCreeps in there's a lot of oh you know\ndo I trust myself or do I just stay\nwhere I'm comfortable and it's just like\nnah just just do the best that you can\nwhatever that looks like just do the\nbest that you can you know and I I feel\nproud that there's moments in my life\nthat I can look back and say wow I\nreally I really showed up for myself you\nknow in the best way I knew how to maybe\nwould look a little different today but\neven then like very proud nonetheless\nand so yeah I I hope that for the future\nGenerations that they leave room for\nthemselves to know that good thing bad\nthing I don't know guess we'll see you\nknow yeah yeah and you know it's you\nknow what's really interesting back yeah\nobviously I went so I went on tour for\nthe first time this year\nit was what you did it was hard and\ngrueling and exhausting and at the same\ntime the most fulfilling beautiful\npowerful thing we did I think it was\naround just under 40 cities across the\nworld and it was insane as an experience\nand I'm so grateful I did it but I\ncouldn't do anything else but that for\nthe time that I was out I think overall\nwe did that in like 80 days all of that\nand it was it was a lot of travel and\neverything else but I was obviously\ntouring for my book eight rules of love\nand it was really interesting to me\nbecause there were\nthere were lots of moments of the\ndifference about for those of you who\ncame to my show you already know but it\nwasn't a speech or a lecture it was\nliterally like a social experiment where\nI would take people up from the audience\npeople would be an uncomfortable\nsituations there'd be humor there were\nmoments where people were sharing their\nstory with the entire you know thousands\nof people in the room it was really\nmoving and there was one area where we\nreally focused a lot on and it was this\nidea of how the biggest space we lose\nourselves is often in romantic\nrelationships and romantic relationships\ntend to be the relationships where we\ninvest the most of us and often find\nthat we leave feeling the most broken or\nhurt or whatever it may have been and I\nwanted to ask you like how have you\nlooked at healing through romantic\nrelationships that you've had we've\ntalked a lot about platonic friendship\nfamily yeah and life but\nromantic relationships tend to affect us\ndeeper I don't know if you agree with\nthat or feel that way but uh yeah I mean\nI'm a sucker for love I love so much so\nmuch so I'm excited to talk about this\nwith you because I know you are and I\nthink for me it's because it doesn't get\nany closer to your heart than that you\nknow this is this is the type of\nexperience that isn't uh that's actually\nchosen you're not born into you know\nyou're not uh placed into this is a this\nis a space of choice I I enjoy this\nperson I enjoy the time that's spent\nwith this person and I think that\nthere's so much to be revealed in a\ndynamic like that about yourself\nand you don't realize it because\nsometimes you're so focused on the other\nperson on the other side that when you\nrealize like oh this is actually about\nme too you know it it it's as close to\nyour heart as it gets and I think my\nhealing in that is\nthe deepest it's gotten of how do I\nexist in these spaces you know the the\nself-accountability part the\nself-reflective part of like what part\nof me shows up in these spaces and going\nto the parts work and stuff that I've\ndone in therapy it's just like yeah\nit's powerful it's as I think it's it's\nas powerful as I could ever get because\nit's the most revealing of your weakness\nof your weaknesses yeah and your\nvulnerabilities and and all of that\nstuff and also maybe not your weaknesses\nbut also your strengths you know it can\nshow you like just how strong you are\nhow giving you can be to someone finding\nparts of yourself that you didn't know\nexisted you know I think it's a very\ninspiring space to be in uh I was\ntalking I was to say talk about this\nwith a friend but it funny enough is\nsomebody who also works in the industry\nand she goes oh Amiga I used to be told\nall the time that I'm so unlucky in love\nand I beg to differ I've been so lucky\nin love and I'm like it's that that\nchange of of mindset of knowing that\nlike everything is happening for us not\nto us and I think that when I think of\nmy journey of healing and relationships\nyou know some of my earliest\nrelationships and how I existed in them\nand then the ones that I've had in like\nmy my you know teenage years young adult\nyears\num and how they evolve and how you\nchange so much so much what have you\ndone to that you'd encourage all the\npeople to tend to to find that\nstrength within themselves and that\nconnection with themselves when it\nalmost feels like\nthe foundations are broken like those\nthree legs are just destroyed yeah well\nare the three legs actually destroyed I\nthink it's like again it's a it's an\nopportunity to reflect inward what is\nreal what is not real and going back to\nlike what's happening in the real world\nversus what's happening what's happening\non social media\nit's not always reflective of the same\nthing you know and and one's experience\nand something can be so different than\nsomeone else's but leaving room for\nyours is super important and then also\nbeing selective and who you share that\nwith because it is such a sacred thing\nyou know and I think that's been one of\nthe most revealing things for me in this\nyou know chapter of my life is like who\ndo I share with with everything who do I\nshare with who deserves to be in these\nspaces with me in my pain in my peak in\nmy process all of those things like I I\ndeserve to have filters I deserve to\nhold space I deserve to just be and not\nhave to explain\nyou know and I and I think being a\nperson who's grown up on social media\nthere has been so many times in my life\nwhere I've just been like no no\nand then what you say how you say it who\nsaid it always gets mixed up always gets\nused against you in some shape or form\nand and I think for me it's just like no\nI'm I'm good\nbecause um my three legs are they're\ngood they've been solidified they're\nbeing catered to they're being taken\ncare of and so my table is standing you\nknow and I'm I'm proud of that I'm very\nproud of that to me it's\nreally powerful what you just said now\naround the idea of\nwe get so lost in a conversation that's\nhappening outside of us that isn't\nactually reality and so almost we're\nlooking at the wrong things we're\narguing about the wrong things where\ninternally having a debate about\nsomething that isn't the thing yep I\nactually had a friend I was talking to\na week ago and we were discussing\nyou know he's been going through some\nstuff and there was someone in his life\nthat\nhe had some\nrightful\nanimosity towards right like it would it\nwould be okay for him to feel this\ncertain way about it\nand I was asking him what was the big\nwin and what was the ego in\num and I was asking him like what is\nreally the win in this situation and he\nwas saying the win in this situation is\nthat my family member can move on from\nwhat they've been going through\nand I said what's the ego win and the\nego in was that person's life is ruined\nright the other person that that they\nwere mad at yeah and it was really\ninteresting like just looking at it from\nthat perspective of like it's natural to\nhave the ego win become strong in a\nsituation but then when you look at the\nbigger picture and you zoom out you're\nlike oh actually now when I make sense\nof this that actually is irrelevant\nto what I really care about does that\nmake any sense yeah 100 100 and so I\nthink to me it's I'm always reflecting\non that like what's my ego win in this\nscenario\nand what's the bigger win in this\nscenario and that only comes when you\ntake a step back and what you said you\nlook at the reality and you look at the\nfilter that you just talked about to me\nthat's the biggest one and I love how\nyou said it wasn't just about the pains\nit was the Peaks it was a piece that's\nso well said like yeah who's the first\nperson you want to call when you win\nand who's the first person you call when\nyou want to lose yeah and there's a\nfilter to that there's a filter to that\non on what the qualifications of someone\nanyone in any way that comes into your\nspace and I think going again so crazy\neverything goes back to my childhood of\njust being like giving giving giving\ngiving when do you take\nand not take just to take I mean like\nreceive you know like that to me is is\nuh is is like the thing to really\nbe just thoughtful about and so those\nfilters are again constantly being\nreevaluated for me and that's why I say\ngrowing up I'm not grown up I'm growing\nup and I'm sure you know the same way I\nfelt this I felt such a strong sense of\nself at 16 and I look back at her and\nI'm like you better give me some of that\ngirlfriend I don't know what that was or\nwhat you was on but you were you were\nlocked in but also not aware of what was\nreally out there in the world and so you\ngo out in the world and you see what's\nout there and you're learning and you're\nadapting and you're taking all these\nthings in and things start to feel a\nlittle different your surroundings your\ncircumstances they all shift\nand then you know what that this is how\nI feel at 26 who's to say I'm not going\nto feel any different when I'm 36. you\nknow and then 46 and so on and so I\nthink just like leaving room again for\nthat like that humanness and that being\nin process and the filters you know like\nnot the filters we see on social media\nbut the the real filters that matter you\nknow we can't just be drinking any water\ninteresting you think you're really sick\nby drinking just any water you know but\nif also if you just drink only purified\nwater you're not getting the minerals\nthat you need you're not getting you\nknow so you can't you can't be too\nguarded yeah because then that's a very\nlonely space to live in you know to have\nthese walls that no one could ever get\nthrough\nbut but if you have no walls\nyou have no no boundaries no anything\nand everyone and anyone can come in\nwhenever they want to I don't think\nthat's a way to live life either you\nknow so uh I I like to think of the um\nthe the house that I was born into\nhad no roof sometimes you know maybe\nsome of the doors were a little funky\nthere's no locks on the doors and and\nthe windows are a little broken\nbut there comes a time when you grow up\nand you can say I don't have to live in\nthis house anymore I can go build a new\nhouse I can build my own house where the\nwindows I can open and close them as I\nwant to\ncheck the blinds or let in the light\nthere's locks on my doors I can let\npeople in and share in my in my space\nand share a meal with them and and even\nif they'd like to move into my house\nbecause I choose for them to to be in\nthe house beautiful but also there's\nlocks on my door so not just anybody can\ncome into my house you know knowing that\nknowing that I I've provided a roof over\nmy head that yeah if it rains we're good\nwe're fine you know it can it can come\nCrashing Down\nand I will be safe I think that's that's\nbeautiful like we're all building our\nown houses that look very different than\nthe houses we grew up in that is so\npowerful Becky G just off his shoulder\nthat was like thank you that was right\nno that was so powerful like I love that\nanalogy it's so it's so true there are\nsome people you only meet in restaurants\nthere are some people who may get to the\nporch of the front door there are some\npeople who make it inside to the living\nroom there are some people who you cook\na meal for some people just order in for\nand there's some people who not\neveryone's allowed into your private\nspaces your bedroom you know like I\nthink for people to know that they can\nset how intimate they want to be with\ndifferent people yeah and that there\nisn't a\npolicy that exists outside of that it's\nsomething you have to set for yourself\nis is such an important thing to remind\npeople because I think people feel\nforced through stages they feel\nuncomfortable through the different\nsteps and\nfor you I mean you just referred to the\nhome I was wondering I think it was was\nit when you were nine years old that the\nhome you grew up in yeah that was I was\nuh oh it didn't burn down so the economy\nat the time was just it was a very scary\ntime it was a recession happening and I\njust think that you know at the time my\nparents were so young they had no idea\nthey were first-time homeowners no idea\nreally what type of mortgage they had\ngotten you know committed to and\nyou hope for the best but not\nnecessarily prepared for the worst you\nknow this is one of those things where I\nthink\nI mean thank God for our families that\nwe had like this family support that we\nhad because\nwe lost everything we we lost our home I\nwent from having like my my first own\nbedroom like most of most of my life I\nshared uh up until that point I'd shared\na bedroom with my siblings all three of\nthem and so I remember this house that\nwe were living in it was the first year\nI had ever had my own room and I was so\nexcited I was like this is what Lizzie\nMcGuire has this is what like all the\ngirls on Disney Channel they get to put\nposters up on their wall and they get to\nlike you know rhinestone their closets\nand whatever and and I just remember\nlike being so excited about moving into\nthat house and then when we lost it just\nfeeling like oh well that that didn't\nlast for very long I think like\nsubconsciously that started something in\nmy mind that felt like oh when you have\ngood things they go away\nnothing lasts forever so don't hold on\nto it too tight and I'm thankful for\nlike the flexibility that that gave me\nin life but it also makes me very sad\nfor my younger self that really believed\nthat everything good that happened to me\ncame with a really hard price to pay you\nknow so like if you have good things oh\nyou gotta be ready gotta be ready for\nsomething that you know the the for the\nshoe to drop and uh and so we moved into\nmy grandparents converted Garage in\nInglewood\nuh where I was born and it was a garage\nI would say the size of the studio\nactually and it was all six of us my mom\nmy dad uh my two brothers and my sister\nand there was bunk beds I slept on the\nbottom bunk with my sister and my\nbrothers up top and my parents on the\nfuton bed that you know they would make\na couch during the day so we'd have a\nlittle bit more room and we had a pop-up\ntable from Ikea that I would do my\nhomework on and eat my cereal that was\nthe knockoff brand of Cocoa Puffs not\nthe real one all to all to fast forward\nto the day that I decided you know I\nwant to do this I was obsessed with\nwhich is really funny to me I mentioned\nLizzie McGuire blonde\nwhite girl I mentioned I was obsessed\nwith Shirley Temple young blonde white\ngirl I was obsessed with Dakota Fanning\nblonde white girl I don't know what it\nwas but it was something about how young\nthey were and how like empowered they\nwere and they were doing these like very\nadult things you know they were like\nthey were the the heroes of the stories\nthat they were doing and and and acting\nand I just I remember thinking like oh I\nwant to do that like I wanna and shout\nout to the internet I go on Google and I\nlook up like what do you need to do or\nwhat who represents Dakota Fanning and\nall these things like how do you become\nan actress and\num my first agency that I signed with uh\nat nine years old was osbrink agency\nshout out to my first ages and at the\ntime they were representing Dakota\nFanning and I did not know what the heck\na monologue was I didn't know what head\nshots were I didn't know any of that was\nuh but I just knew I really wanted to\nlearn I really wanted to do this and a\nhuge shout out to my parents too because\nagain they knew nothing about this they\nhad three other kids you know to take\ncare of too and the drive from Inglewood\nto Hollywood is is you know with traffic\nespecially it's not not very close L.A\nCounty's big but they really supported\nme through that and I have like a little\nlike I printed out a little contract to\nmy parents and I said give me six months\njust six months and maybe yeah if\nnothing happens then like okay like you\nknow that's fine like I'll leave you\nalone we'll Pretend This Never Happened\nor we can renegotiate our terms now we\ncan renegotiate our terms after six\nmonths if all goes well\nand yeah going back to just like that\ninstinct that agency that empowerment\nthat I felt to just like to do this\nthing that no one in my family had ever\ndone like there was really no point of\nreference\nand I'm glad I did it because I look\nback at the garage which is like still a\nreal place where my family still lives\nyou know there's there's a lot of things\nup there my Grandma has a couple of like\nlittle Shrine things of like oh you know\nI'm like Grandma this isn't a museum\nyeah there's people walking around the\nhouse like is that the house the back\nyou lived in my grandma's like\nabsolutely I'm like no very Sacred Space\num but yeah it's like it's crazy to like\nlook back at and think like this is you\nknow this is where it all started that\nFire Within me that felt like no I can\nreally do this\nlet's let's try this that's so\nspectacular that's special that's\nspecial how so many Big Dreams start\nfrom so many small places and and small\nplaces within us too yep and I was gonna\nask you that like how have you now that\nyou're building this new home\nthat has Windows that work and there's\ndoors that have locks\nwhat's changed about how\nyou\ndecide and Define how\nsomeone gets to get closer to you and\nand connected to you like what has\nchanged what has evolved what have you\nlearned growing up about who you allow\nclose yeah I think it's like again it\ncomes back to knowing that anything has\nto be concrete you know you can you can\nVibe with people you can enjoy Beautiful\nMoments with people\num and then and then the moment that\nsomething doesn't feel right you can\nspeak to that and everything is always\nto me always owed a conversation you\nknow I've had friendships in my life\nthat just in all honesty I I outgrew and\nthere's all love and it was a\nconversation and it's sometimes that\nsimple but I think it's just like\nleaving room for that growth just like\nit's Gonna Change that's the point like\nwe grow like we change going back to the\nice cream seven years ago was chocolate\ntoday it's frozen yogurt I still have my\nback because I love chocolate\nagain but you know like you're literal\nlike you're even your physical body\nchanges why wouldn't our minds and our\nhearts also expand and change in those\nways too you know so I think it's like\nand it's not just in the way that I hope\nto be received by other people but it's\njust it's also like or like how I hold\nspace for other people so also like\nbeing around people who hold that same\nspace for me you know like I think\nunderstanding that these are like Mutual\nspaces right like it's empowering when\nyou're like oh this is a choice yeah\nlike I get to choose to be here you got\nto choose to be here like and we're here\ntogether like that to me has been the\nmost beautiful part of my like Evolution\nand healing is like man like when I go\non tour and my fans buy their tickets\nbecause they chose to be there like you\nknow the same way I chose to walk onto\nthat stage like let's not Rob ourselves\nof that like empowerment that agency\nthat we have over our lives to decide to\nchoose what's good for you what's best\nfor you what motivates you what inspires\nyou and that can be the bad things that\ncould be the hard things that could be\nthat because there's no such thing as\ngood bad uh whatever you know it's it\njust is um\nyou know when I'm speaking to you and I\nlove this and I love it when I get to\nexperience it in someone because I think\nit's quite rare but you would just have\nsuch a like strong spirit\nof just like positivity mindset like you\nobviously you're working on all of these\nthings as we've been talking about today\nand I love seeing it be so tough in\nsomeone not I'm not saying that of\ncourse like you said you cried this\nmorning\nI'm not saying without I'm actually more\ntough I'm not saying tough in the sense\nthat there isn't any pain or stress of\ncourse to and to me the display of\nto yourself of pain is even tougher to\nbe able to admit to yourself that hey\nI'm working on this stuff\nhow have you\nstayed so open to that mindset of trust\nand forgiveness for yourself and others\nwhen it almost seems like there's so\nmany reasons to not be that way yeah if\nthat makes sense well I think it's just\ngoing back to like it makes it makes it\neasier for our human mind to see things\nin black and white right it makes our\nlife easier but actually it doesn't I\nfeel like it cuts a short from the\nexperience that we're supposed to have\nlike I I believe in karmic energy I\nbelieve that like we are here for a\nreason you know there's there's we're\nhere on purpose there's a purpose to our\npain to our our happiness to our\ngreatest Joys to our anger there's\npurpose to all of it and so I think just\nlike really allowing yourself to be open\nto it is is where I think I find it it's\nlike it is that story of the father and\nhis son like I\ndon't think that there's these practices\nthat have been around for like\ngenerations and generations and decades\nyou know\nto think that like yeah it's just a\nbunch of Hocus Pocus you know like I I\njust don't I don't think so like I think\nthat's why I have a hard time trusting\nlike the power of technology sometimes\nthat's a whole other conversation but it\nhasn't been around long enough for me to\nreally understand what this is and what\nit's capable of and the impacts that it\nhas like I said on the future\nGenerations like it is it's intimidating\nand I think but you got to be open to it\nbecause if it cuts our processing time\nyou know by half and our kids can learn\nmore that's that's great but I believe\nin Balance I believe that we need\nbalance as human beings and I think that\nthere's just so much more to this life\nthan just being like well I don't like\nyou it's like okay well maybe there's\nsomething in that person that you don't\nlike that actually reflects something\nthat you don't like about yourself but\nyou're not ready for that conversation\nyou know some people just aren't and\nthat's totally fine but I am that person\nlike put yeah I love it I really do yeah\nyeah yeah I can sense that I could tell\nthat and it's it's fun to watch I I\nthink it's it's really meaningful to see\nin someone you've talked about having\nguardian angels and I wanted to ask you\nwhen do you feel most connected to your\nguardian angels oh\num ah I feel like my faith journey is\nvery interesting because it was\nsomething that I was introduced to again\nat a very very young age because I grew\nup in a very religious family my mom was\nkind of the one to break that up for us\nwhich I'm very thankful for because it\nallowed me the opportunity to kind of\nfind it on my own instead of it be\nsomething that was forced because like\nmy mom I remember many times she taught\nme stories you know your grandma would\njust uh call us in we'd be like playing\noutside having the time of our lives\nlike kids don't even play outside\nanymore you know but here here there we\nwere like playing outside and my mom\nwould make us come inside and pray the\nrosary and we'd be like again come on\nGrandma come on Mom you know and and\nwhat I loved is like as a kid I would\nhave so many questions like I'd tell my\nmom like you know sometimes when I was\nlittle this is very funny my grandma\nwould sometimes be like kind of\ninsinuate like oh you know people don't\ngo to church or like they're on the\nthey're on the bad list the naughty list\nright and and so my mom would be like\nyou know how grandma is you know we're\ngonna go to yosito's house you know\nwhich was like to go to church we're\ngonna go to this I'm like why doesn't\ndiocito come to our house like why can't\nhe come to our house like what's this\nconcept of us having to go to him why\ncan't he come to us like challenging\nthese things all the time and I just\nremember just thinking like no\nspirituality is a mutual connection with\nsores with greater sores and for me my\nconnection with God is just like\nyeah like he loves me regardless there's\ntimes where I pray and I mean some of\nthe stuff that I share I'm just like\nyou know what I mean you know what I\nmean you know and I think that that's\nlike I love that for me that I was able\nto discover that that faith and and I\nfeel so protected and in some of the\nmoments that are so simple you know I\nmean not just like in my moments of deep\nlike confusion or like pain when I am\nchallenged to like surrender that\ncontrol right when I say I practice like\ngo let God but even just like when I'm\nby myself in my house like making my\ncoffee and I'm playing like I don't know\na certain song will come on like on my\nplaylist and I'm just like that's my\ngrandpa I know it like I know it you\nknow or today a big thing for me is uh\nis dragonflies I have a dragonfly tattoo\nand they they definitely represent\nsomething very significant for me and I\nmean for months now on the way here\n[Music]\nI love that that's beautiful and it's\nit's wonderful to have these\nnotes and signs and you know moments\nthat make us feel aligned we all need\nthem in in some capacity and I think we\nwe all look for them because we're all\ntrying to feel connected to something\nhigher and bigger and\nmore powerful than ourselves whatever it\nmay be whether it's in the world or\nwhether it's beyond and it's it's nice\nhearing about your spiritual journey and\nhow it's evolved because\nit is so personal and there's a\nbeautiful\nthere's a beautiful statement I believe\nit's\nI believe it was said by David Lynch\nand he said that prayer is you talking\nto God and meditation is God talking to\nyou and I've always loved that that idea\nof the god of God Universe whatever you\ncall it but the idea that prayer is when\nyou're speaking and meditation is when\nyou're listening yes and that\ncommunication is mutual as you said it's\nthis two-way connection it's not a one\nway as it's often portrayed or comes\nacross and I really find that as well\nthat sometimes my job is to stop talking\nand just to listen yep and so often\nwe're just talking too much or trying to\nfigure it all out or problem solving and\nthat listening ability is so lost in the\nart of communication a hundred percent\nyeah yeah it's it's that's why I said\nyou know everything is always a\nconversation I think that's how we\nshould look at even things I can't talk\nback to me my my dogs that live in my\nmom's house you know I love them so much\nthere is a mutual love they can't\nnecessarily talk back to me but I listen\nI take the time to like connect with\nthem you know know but I think it's\nabout being that type of you know\nintentional\ntype of person I guess when when you're\nhaving these daily practices and that's\nwhy I think when I like meditate like\nthere was like a shift instead of saying\nwhat do I want what what do I feel right\nnow it's like what do you want like it's\nsir you have to ask your subconscious\nyou have to bring parts of yourself\nfull word you know to really receive\nwhat that is because our psyche's like\nis crazy there's certain things that I\nhave unpacked in therapy I was like oh\nI didn't even remember that that\nhappened you know like and it's it's\nbecause our minds are very powerful our\nminds were designed to protect us right\nlike our human body\nwants to survive and avoid death at all\ncosts but our spirit needs death our\nspirit needs death the the thing of\ngiving up something to then have a\nrebirth of something else to gain\nsomething else like you have to be\nwilling to do that you know like there's\nso many parts of myself that I think you\nknow I I have kind of like resolved with\nand it's beautiful to look back at like\nthat's that skin that I needed to shed\nthat's a beautiful thing but there's\nlike you know Parts in that that\nprobably people I grew up with people\nthat knew me to be a certain way that\nwas more beneficial for them\num would probably be like she changed\nyeah like no I did I actually did I did\nchange you know and that I don't think\nthat's a bad thing so it's funny how\nyeah Spirit can need something different\nthan like what our body is like designed\nfor and you're like no no it's not the\nliteral thing it's it's the shedding you\nknow it's the shedding that needs to\nhappen yeah\nthank you it's been such a joy talking\nto you today and I'm so glad that we've\nfinally connected in this way and we've\ngot to share your abundant energetic\nspirit with everyone through this so\nmuch episode and I'm hoping that\neveryone who listens to it can kind of\nyou know walk away feeling that\npositive energy through your voice\nthrough your energy into them as well\nbecause I really feel like it's come\nacross for me too like you just yeah you\njust have this spark and I'm hoping that\neveryone today got to feel a bit of it\nbut we end every on-purpose episode with\nour final five which is a question that\nhas to be answered in one word to one\nsentence maximum so Becky G these are\nyour final five uh the first question is\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nheard or received you miss a hundred\npercent of the shots you never take um I\nthink that's one sentence right yeah\nyeah that's good I was like it's\nsupposed to really be one word that\nworks no no one way to one sentence is\nfine uh question number two what is the\nworst advice you've ever heard or\nreceived\nI don't know I'm that per I'm that\npositive Patty I'm like even those\nnegative things they're a positive thing\nah I would say\num\njust make sure you really think about it\nit's like no you could overthink it yeah\nthat's what I would say just make sure\nyou really think about it really think\nabout what you're saying yeah or really\nthink about you know what it is that\nyou're asking for no no I trust my gut\nI'd say probably that's the worst advice\nyou should really think about that yeah\ngot it\nuh question number three\nwhat is something you're currently\ntrying to unlearn\ndefinitely people pleasing what's the\nhardest part about giving it up\nuh it's just second nature you don't\neven realize like how you practice that\non a daily basis you know like I said\ngrowing up in this industry just it it I\nfeel like there's a lot of child stars\nthat are set up to not be very\nsuccessful as adults who are trying to\ntake agency over their own life\nand so uh just knowing that like your\nfeelings matter how you feel matters and\nalso not everybody needs to participate\nin that mm-hmm and that even if you\nspend your whole life trying to please\neveryone chances are they'll still be\nupset with you yeah for something else\nyeah and again maybe it has more to do\nwith them than it does you so totally\nyeah great all right question number\nfour\nwhat's something that you used to value\nthat isn't important anymore\num\nI would say like the Optics\nof what it is to\nOK the Limelight\nlike going back to like that thing that\nlike oh everybody needs to like you and\nlike you know you gotta you gotta Feed\nthe Beast or whatever I don't I don't\nthink I really value that anymore I\nvalue like my my personal peace more\nthan anything else I like that yeah\nbeautiful Fifth and final question if\nyou could create one law that everyone\nin the world had to follow what
