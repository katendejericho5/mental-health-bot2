give her I was shamed\nfor so many years for being so hyper\nemotional and crying so much and like\ngetting angry so fast I just am so\nafraid to celebrate myself and then be\nlike slapped in the face I don't want\nthat I value like being very true to how\nyou feel whether that's a good feeling\nor not that's\nbefore we jump into this episode I'd\nlike to invite you to join this\ncommunity to hear more interviews that\nwill help you become happier healthier\nand more healed all I want you to do is\nclick on the Subscribe button I love\nyour support it's incredible to see all\nyour comments and we're just getting\nstarted I can't wait to go on this\njourney with you thank you so much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbestselling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with J\nshett I feel like you've been through so\nmuch change so\nmany you know career Puffs and then I\nwas like you're so young as well and I\nwas like wow like it's so much that\nyou've been through and I guess my first\nquestion is how do you feel about where\nyou've landed now like who is the Renee\ntoday what version of this is you how\nare you feeling yeah my manager and I\nwere just talking about this in the car\nevery couple months I get into this like\nnew wave of like where like something\nreally settles in where I'm like a new\nlevel or I feel like personally I'm at a\nnew level or I'm at like a different\nlevel of visibility typically in the\npast it's felt really good right now to\nbe honest it feels very um scary in like\na lot of ways just like in a I'm really\naware of myself all of a sudden um so I\nlove the changes I feel very grateful\nright now um for everything I've done\nand hopefully KN on wood or whatever\ncontinue to do\nbut the new the new the newness and the\nnew levels when they come it it knocks\nme it knocks me what's scary I\nam becoming much more aware of how\npeople perceive\nme and whether that's um good or bad or\nin between I feel some kind of way about\nit and I'm trying to like let that go\nreally bad I'm trying really really hard\nit's not been working\nlike we had like a bunch of like stuff\ncome out this morning about like the\nalbum and granted this is all like\nfairly good news but I like immediately\njust started having such an anxiety\nattack cuz I was like oh I just don't\nwant anybody to ever speak about me\nagain which is exactly why I'm here\ntoday and exactly why I keep doing this\num yeah it's it's a weird thing I I\ndon't know I don't know it's it's\ninteresting it's never really sat with\nme before in that way like this really\nhit hit me about a week ago where I was\nlike oh I've actually chosen to like\nhave a very visible life M just really\nhit me to be honest yeah I'm like okay\nyeah in my own small way I can relate to\nthat as well in my own world like it's\nthe same thing though what's really\ninteresting is I think from the outside\nin yeah a level up looks\nquite at least from the way I perceive\nit my opinion sure sure I think from the\noutside in most people's careers level\nup look very\norchestrated and\nmanufactured when in reality they're a\nlot more organic and they're a lot more\nnatural I think so I think so especially\nlike especially of course I'm I'm such\nlike an internet rat like I really have\nto get better about like not reading\neverything I'm I'm so bad at that I like\ncommend people who are good at being\nlike I'm going to turn my phone off and\nnot take this to heart I cannot do that\nI care so much and I got to let that go\num but I I definitely feel that way cuz\nI read things sometimes again that I\nshouldn't be reading but that are so\ninteresting to me like somebody somebody\nthe other day called me an industry\nplant and I was like bro I wish I was an\nindustry plant I was like that would be\namazing I was like that would be iconic\nI was like if like my father was like\nsome like industry Mogul that would be\nlovely he went into like medical sales\nlike he didn't help me out like that you\nknow so yeah it's always it's always\ninteresting and I find it really silly\nand funny but yeah yeah and then it must\nbe hard I mean obviously I think\neveryone's seen it the video where you\nsadly have a stalker coming up to you\nand Drew on set on stage and then it's\nalmost like looks like you've been\nnotified and you kind of see it coming\nand then you're protecting Drew like I\nmean like when you have moments like\nthat happen does that almost make you\nfeel more vulnerable and susceptible or\nI feel like even to say it out loud it\nsounds so silly and so like wo is me but\nI really was so weirded out by that\nwhole thing and I that's not to say that\nlike it it shouldn't be I just like I\ndon't know she's such a g and she's such\na pro and sadly has probably had that\nhappen her entire life I've never been\nin situations where that has happened to\nmyself luckily or anybody around me that\nwas so SC I I cuz I don't know like you\nnever he had like a bag on him and I was\nlike okay I just don't know where this\ncould go also I'm I live in fight ORF\nflight just by the nature of having so\nmuch anxiety so like when you see me\nlike twitch in that video and like go\nit's like half of like a I'm like a\npretty like transparent person like if\nsomebody like scares me you're going to\nknow and also be like that was so\njarring for me but yeah I don't know\nI've just never been through anything\nlike that before to me I'm like I know\nit sounds very wo as me and silly but it\ndid scare the hell out of me yeah it's\nvery weird fully understandable I'm glad\nthat you know it didn't go any further\nthan it did same and yeah it's always in\nagain I think it's the unpredictability\nof it I was reading a study that was\nsaying that humans would rather know\n100% that are bad things going to happen\nas opposed to have a 50/50 chance of it\nhappening or not happening oh my God\nyeah probably right like we we would\nrather know that something bad's going\nto happen rather than live in this world\nof like it could or it couldn't like\nthat uncertainty you've been doing this\nfor a long time what parts of your\nanxiety have you got better at dealing\nwith and what parts of anxiety are like\nstill just flaring up well it's funny\nbecause I think that I 100 I get what\nyou're saying because 100% of my\ndecision making happens before I do\nsomething like this morning right like\nwhen like chart data or things are\ncoming out about like the album but\nbefore anything was even posted\npublished out there whatever I had\nalready made the Assumption and was\nalready like okay people are going to be\nupset about this this is going to be not\nreal and I've already decided that it's\nbad before it happens so that I've I can\nprepare myself to at least not be so\ndisappointed um so I definitely do that\nuh that help I actually don't know I\ndon't know because for everyone around\nme like all they say is like we really\nwant you to enjoy things and like we\nwant you to be having fun and we want\nyou to be able to celebrate\nyourself I just am so afraid to\ncelebrate myself and then be like\nslapped in the face I don't want that I\nwould I don't know and I don't know if\nit's not great to say I would rather\nlive in a state of like just like\nchilling and like hope that nothing\nhorrific happens but be prepared if it\ndoes I don't know what's better or worse\nI'm not sure no I I don't think there is\nI just wanted to know whether you feel\nyeah no yeah I I don't know I mean don't\nget me wrong I would love to enjoy\nthings a little bit more I'm not really\nthere right now I still I still I think\nhave like the same anxieties as when I\nstarted it's just more that I'm I'm much\nmore aware of how I'm perceived now and\nyou feel before you just weren't aware\nand so yeah I just just kind of was like\noh this is me I'm\nso out here and don't care and whatever\num I also was just so hungry to do this\nand to be doing music that it was just\nlike run for it and now I kind of feel\nlike that I'm embarking on whatever\nmusic looks like in my life I'm much\nmore nervous about it um maybe just cuz\nI'm in it and experiencing it but it's\ndefinitely weird it's definitely weird\ndo you have to do you have to turn down\nthe outside noise when you're creating\nand when you're making and are you able\nto do that or is it just so hard and\nit's not something that I really think\nof when I'm creating it's something I\nthink of when I'm acting I'm more so\nthinking about like for me like do I\nfeel like I'm doing the best I possibly\ncan I'm so hypercritical of myself when\nI'm writing that I'm not even worried\nabout another person because I don't\neven have the space in my brain to think\nabout someone else's opinion if that\nmakes sense MH um which I guess is nice\nyeah it sounds great it sounds good to\nme it's a little nicer yeah it's bad\nwhen I write like a really bad song\nthough cuz when I write a bad song like\nmy like worst critic is myself and it's\nlike what's what's the Thought you think\nyou repeat the most at those times that\nI will never write another good song\nagain it goes to that extreme oh my God\nin two seconds and that everybody around\nme is lying to me and that everybody who\nis kind enough to work with me and um\nput their time and energy toward things\nthat I really want for my career and how\nsweet that is that they're all making\nginormous mistakes and this is all a\nleap of faith that they've taken that\nthey're going to regret immediately jump\ninto that totally and then how long\nwould you sit in that for a long time a\nlong time like this morning again good\nthings were happening and I was just\nlike in my head I'm just like they're\nall lying to me I'm like there's no way\nmind you these are people who I trust\nand love and who are giving up time out\nof their lives to work toward a goal\nthat I really want so deeply like these\nare lovely people it has nothing to do\nwith them and everything to do with me\nbut yeah I sit in that all the time and\nthen what gets you out of it I just keep\ngoing like resilience and also just I\nwant it so bad and I also like I want to\nsucceed for myself but I also really\nwant to like prove to everybody who is\nworking with me or who believes in me or\neven like consume as my music from 2\nseconds of a song to like listens to\neverything I put out like I want to do\nwell for those people so I don't know\nmaybe like\nDrive things like that yeah fear of\nfailure really motivates me love\nher do all of these characters in your\nhead have names and voices and hers and\nhis and theirs my God they're all\nthey're all they're all me they're just\nall different versions of me like the\nlike fear of failure is like\nme as like a kid yeah I think because I\nlike I used to set like such obnoxious\ngoals for myself as a child like and it\nwould keep changing I would be like if\nI'm not Beyonce by the time I'm 18 I\nhave failed wow insane and it used to be\nthings like that used to and I and when\nI was really really little I'd be like\nif I am not on Disney Channel by the\ntime that I am 13 I might as well just\nend it all like they were just such\nextreme extreme things um so there just\nsaw different versions of myself that\njust kind of coexist or lack thereof\nthey don't have that and do you find\nyourself still repeating those audacious\ngoals even now or oh my God every day\nyeah every day and they're they let's be\nclear there are things that I'm not\nnecessarily proud of like no no I get\nthat yeah it's coming across yeah 100\nokay fabulous cuz sometimes I like say\nsomething and I'll be like no no no\nthat's not how I like feel that is what\nI think though um like this morning like\nthese are great things that are\nhappening okay and like we we had like a\ntop 10 like debut album and everybody's\nlike this is\namazing and in my brain I was like I\ncould have done better like all I could\nthink of in my head was like I could\nhave done better and I cried and I like\nbeat myself up and then I like kind of\ncame to and was like oh no this is\nactually like very exciting and then I\nwould like go back down again you know\nthat movie tallal and nights yeah yeah\nof course yeah what a great reference I\nwas thinking if you ain't first you're\nlast like that's all I think of in my\nbra which is so silly and so stupid and\nI wish I didn't feel that way but I\nreally do I really do no hearing you\nexplain it and I want to clarify what I\nwas reaffirming with you was hearing you\nexplain it is a really good breakdown of\nhow I think so many of us think totally\nso hearing you articulate it with so\nmuch Clarity yeah I'm listening going I\nknow there are times when I think\nexactly the same way as and I know\neveryone who's listening is going in\ntheir own way\nthink we dehab that is because now\nnumber two is the same as 9 and it makes\nno difference and by the way 99 is great\nbut 99 is not you know we're so it just\nkeeps going and it's it's a Perpetual\ncycle which can be so paralyzing insane\nI also would never hold someone else to\nthe standard that I hold myself and I'm\nvery aware of that it doesn't change how\nI feel sadly but I never in my life\nwould say to somebody if they're like my\ndebut album debuted at 5,600 whatever\nI'd be like that is amazing what an\nincredible amount of work Blood Sweat\nand Tears you and so many other people\naround you have put into this and this\nis an accomplishment that you should\ncelebrate for years and years on end MH\nand believe every single word of that\nfor myself I'm like could have done\nbetter I should have done more I'm just\nimmediately like what should I have done\nbetter which is silly yeah but it is\nkind of like a human thing I guess yeah\nand I think it's that almost it's\ninteresting isn't it it's like that's\nthe same mindset that will make you\nimprove and get better but it's the same\nmindset that can slow you down and train\nyou it is it is also the life that that\nI have been like praised for by like\nadult figures in my life since I was\nvery young that's where it comes from oh\nmy God absolutely absolutely like I\ndon't blame anyone or think this is like\na negative thing that somebody you know\nput in my brain but I do always think of\nit like I used to like finish like\nbasketball games or like any sort of\ncompetitive thing that I would do\nwhether it was like sports or like some\nlike showcase for like singing and like\nmy first like comment from like my\nparents who I love and who are so\nsupportive but my first comment from my\nparents would be like okay what could\nyou have done better even if I would\nhave like crushed and so like that is\nhonestly my thought every single time\nwhich in a way is really great cuz I'm\nalways like trying to make myself better\nand also like hold myself myself\naccountable for places that I um slipped\nup could have done more didn't do enough\nbut then also it becomes this thing\nwhere you just like beat yourself up for\nevery little like tiny place you could\nhave had a little celebratory moment and\ncongratulations internally that you then\ndon't have yeah it's very weird MH it's\nalmost like taking that question M if\nall of us were first asked what did you\ndo great what you what could you have\ndone better I got to be great it just\npositions it so differently like if\nsomeone said to you what did you do\ngreat and you as a kid were like I think\nI did this right and I think I got this\nright and I think I did this right now\nyou've celebrated you've got a moment\nwhat you were just saying earlier you've\nhad a moment to celebrate and know\nyourself and know that you've won and\nthat you're powerful and and great and\nthen it's like okay well what could you\nhave done better and now it's like okay\nnow I have absolutely a balance of\nexactly whereas if you don't have the\nwhat you did great you only have the\ncritical judgmental questioning oh my\ngod when I first started doing therapy I\nwas 20 so this is like maybe 3 years ago\nnow three and a half years ago and I\nwill never forget like they would\ntherapists would like ask me they'd be\nlike okay what is something you like\nlike about yourself or what is something\nyou're proud of that you do and I could\nnot for years like\nanswer that question at all I would just\nstart sobbing every single time every\nsingle time I was just like I cannot\ncompliment myself in any sort of the way\nm which sucks\nsucks how about now I can I can I do I\ndo a better job of it now I do what\nwould it be I love the people in my life\nreally really hard very glad yeah that's\nbeautiful yeah you found it yes\nwoohoo no and you've attracted them yeah\nyeah and they've attracted you yeah it's\nlike it's a two-way thing it's like\nthey're around you because they love you\nand believe in you and you're around\nthem because you love them and believe\nin them that's that's special and you\nknow I'm I'm going to definitely miss\nyou on sex lives of college girls like I\nyour character was awesome me me and my\nwife watched the show all the time and\nabsolutely loved it what what you were\njust talking about earlier like acting\nwas actually a space that made you feel\na lot more yeah like anxious and\neverything was that the reason to switch\nover or what was it for you that made\nyou go you know what I need to step away\nno I mean to be honest like I inevitably\nlike one day I'm like very excited to to\ntalk about it I can't say a ton about it\nbeing with the SAG strike that being\nsaid acting to me was always just so\nscary was just so scary it was just\nsomething I had no confidence in and\nthought I was just so so so terrible at\nit was something that came later on in\nmy life at least to this point later on\nin my life I was like 18 19 that I just\ndidn't think I could do MH and it became\nlike a really\namazing opportunity to like get people's\nattention to pay attention to me to do\nmusic which I didn't feel like I was\ngetting when I was younger or at least\nit was harder for me to but I just\nreally really wanted attention musically\nyeah and I wanted to like get signed and\ndo like the whole thing and when acting\nbecame a conduit for\nthat I just was like okay I guess I got\nto do this like I would be silly not to\ndo this I still felt\nso so incredibly insecure around it I\njust was like I cannot do this I was\nlike I'm gonna get fired from any job\nthat I have when it comes to acting so\nit's something I've developed a love for\nnow later on actors are so so so\nthoughtful so thoughtful and so like\ncareful and articulate and like you\nreally have to like rid yourself of like\nthe judgment and I struggle so so hard\nwith that yeah so it's it's just\nsomething that I was always so insecure\nabout that's actually a really powerful\nlesson though and I'm glad you shared\nthat detail\nbecause most of us have one goal and we\nthink there's one path to it yeah and\nwe're just walking in that direction and\noften that door doesn't open at a\ncertain age at a certain time at a\ncertain point in life but we don't\nrealize that a pivot at that point doing\nsomething that you even massively\nuncomfortable with oh my God so\nuncomfortable but that's actually helped\nand been a productive and proactive use\nof time as an investment in doing what\nyou really want to do which I love that\nas a life lesson like that's incredible\nthat's huge yeah no it's it's been the\nbest I've like not only like in a in a\ncareer sense have I grown so much and\nlearned so much and been able to work\nwith really incredible people I've also\nlike met like my best friends in the\nwhole wide world like my best friend in\nthe planet I met on a TV show Aaliyah\nand you know so it's like it's it's\ngiven me a lot and it's been like a\nreally really big Catalyst for my music\ncareer and that is not at all lost on me\nthat's fantastic what what's been your\nmost difficult insecurity to channel in\nmusic like what's been the hardest thing\nto actually communicate and express and\nwhy do you think that is it's\ninteresting I feel like I express most\nof my insecurities and things that I\nthink yeah pretty well and it's pretty\nopenly absolutely no I think you do\nthat's totally but even though I do I\nstill constantly feel\nlike I'm so not communicating anything\nwell anything at all even though I know\nI do that you know like that is the\nentire basis of like my like songw\nwriting is like exactly how I feel and\nlike letting that go again whether it be\nsomething I'm like proud of this thought\nand opinion I have or whether it's\nsomething that I'm not proud of but at\nthe end of the day that is how I feel\nand that is my art and that is the\nreason why I put it out there whatever I\nstill judge every inch of it so harshly\nlike I cannot let it go like I wrote\nlike a bunch of songs on my album and\nI'm really like proud of the things that\nI said and like proud of the place that\nit comes from and then I'll Panic about\nhaving written it and be like oh my God\nI shouldn't have said that that was so\nstupid like as this like sending the\nwrong like message or something or am I\nyou know going against everything I\nbelieve in and then I'm like no that is\nactually just like how I felt in that\nmoment and like not everything I say is\nlike Bible and like how you should live\nyour life please God don't but like it I\ndon't know I I communicate it all and\nI'm proud of how I do but I don't let\nthat just be like I that just never\nexists so I can overc communicate as\nmuch as humanly possible and still be\nincredibly insecure um about what I'm\nsaying or like how it is received\nabsolutely just sitting with you for a\nfew moments I really feel like when you\ndo describe what anxiety feels like yeah\na lot of the time when people talk about\nanxiety it sounds like here or it sounds\nlike here they trust is tight or they\nfeel uncomfortable but when I hear you\nspeak about it you speak about it from\nhere which really helps because it's\nkind of like making sense there was one\nlyric that stood out that I wanted to\nshare with you I'll make it through the\nwinter if it kills me I can make it\nfaster if I hurry I'll angel in the snow\nuntil I'm wor\nbut if it kills me I tried if it kills\nme\nand when I was there was a couple of\nlines in there that I wanted to kind of\nbreak down with you if that's okay yeah\nno please so one was I'll make it\nthrough the winter if it kills me and I\nwas like when do you feel like you're\nmost in winter like when does it feel\nthe\ncoldest in the moments of me getting so\nriled up and so um panicked and freaked\nout about my career my family being a\ngood friend like when I'm just like\nreally really really really really I\ndon't know just coming for myself to be\nhonest I I never feel like I'm going to\nlike stop like I just always feel\nresilient in a stick way honestly in a\nway that has really really really helped\nme but is crazy sometimes I think about\nit and I'm very confused like I\ngenuinely don't know where it comes from\nor like what it is but like I could be\nhaving the worst day of my life and I\nwould still be like yeah this sucks and\nlike this is the worst day of my life\nand I feel like a terrible person and I\nfeel like I've done something really\nreally horrible and I'm still not going\nto stop what I'm doing not that behavior\nI guess like I'm still not going to stop\nlike making music or doing the thing\nthat I love and it's silly now in\nretrospect cuz I get it like your kids\nyou say dumb things but like I would\nlike post these singing videos online\nwhen I was in high school and like all\nthese girls would like go on Twitter and\nlike say how terrible of a singer I was\nand how I was just so silly and I looked\nstupid and I remember that so so well\nand I remember really hurting my\nfeelings but at the same\ntime I still kept posting videos it\nwasn't like it didn't hurt my feelings\nbut I was like you're not going to stop\nme from doing the thing that I love to\ndo and that I want to do so winter is\nalways but winter is resilient and so\nAngel as a whole is just full of\nresilience absolutely what what makes\nyou feel worthy\nnow I\nfeel I feel worthy when the people\naround me are happy which I guess is\nsomething inherently that's like oh that\nsucks like I should feel worthy when I\nfeel good about myself but I really do\nat this point in my life I feel I feel\nworthy when the people around me are\nhappy and proud of me m if I feel like\nthe people around me are happy and proud\nof of me and they're okay then I feel\nokay and that goes for like our like\nkind of like community and like fandom\ntoo like if they like things and they\nfeel good then I feel good and if they\ndon't then I don't feel good which sucks\nI H I know that's something I have to\ninevitably work on and find some sort of\nequilibrium to like be balanced and\nstuff but right now it's really just\nlike it sucks but it's when other people\nare proud of me then I am proud out of\nmyself I don't do well finding that\ninternally which is not ideal yeah um\nbut it is like what it is right now yeah\nyeah and and starting from where you are\nis the only thing you can do so being\nhonest about that and knowing where it's\nat absolutely and it's interesting both\ntimes even earlier when we were like you\nknow what are you proud that you have\naround you you were like yeah the people\nand then even now it's like the people\nit's no it really does go like anything\nelse yeah\nexactly there's something beautiful in\nthat and it's the idea that What Makes\nYou Worthy is that those people choose\nto be in your life because they see you\nas worthy absolutely and that and it's\nlike if you can just connect that like\nit's like that but it's hard but it it\ntakes a while it takes a while for all\nof us we've all been conditioned whether\nit's everyone around me matters everyone\naround me doesn't matter like whichever\nway we are we're all at some end of that\nSpectrum yes what are the experiences in\nyour life that you think have made you\nbecome resilient like when did that when\ndid you start to look at your life and\ngo I've been through a lot of tough\nstuff yeah and that's built of\nresilience what were some of those\nevents or what was a moment that you\nfelt made you resilient yeah it's\nwhenever I start to like again like\ncompliment or or like like Pat myself on\nthe back in any sense of the word I get\nso like my immediate like response to be\nfrank was to be like well I've had a\nvery easy and and I'm good and don't get\nme wrong I have many many ways but I\nthink\nthat I feel like my resilience comes\nfrom like two different things I like\nthings I actually go through be things\nthat like how I speak to myself I'm very\nresilient when it comes to how I speak\nto myself like if I had the the inner\nmonologue that I have that was from\nanother human being oh my God like that\nwould suck that would suck but for\nwhatever reason I keep pushing through\nand keep going and that doesn't really\nchange that much but I keep going but\nlike situ like for instance like so snow\nangel which was like the single of this\nalbum and is now like the album title\nand everything is something that I've\nlike talked about for for months really\njust being like okay this is a situation\nthat happened to me and this is\nsomething that like I'll eventually talk\nabout but like I want you to like have\nthe song sit with the song interpret it\nin the way that you need and feel like\nit can like sit on on you so that you\nhave it because like the situation of\nthat song A is something that I pray and\ndoesn't not something legit that\neverybody can like relate to in the\nsense that I went through it which I'm\nvery glad about but like that was a huge\nmoment of resilience for me and even\nwriting the song I feel like was\nresilience and then in a way holding\nback from then talking about it for a\ncouple months was resilience so it shows\nup in my life in a lot of of different\nways but for that specifically it was\nJanuary maybe late January early\nFebruary of\n2022 and I had just gone through like a\nbreakup and it was really tough and it\nwas like the first time I had ever been\nreally in love with someone and then\nexperienced like a breakup and I had\nalways I had been in relationships back\ntoback for like 5 years so my like later\nteen years were all that and so at this\npoint I'm 22 and I started like having\nlike freedom in my life kind of for the\nfirst time and I was living here in LA\nand I was like hanging out in a new\ngroup of people and they were like they\nwere partyers and they like really sent\nit really sent it I like had heard from\nlike my family and like my friends\naround me that like this isn't really\nlike a good group we don't think for you\nand that's not to say that these are bad\npeople cuz I I don't I don't believe\nthat I think that people can do bad\nthings and be still be good people\nsometimes um a couple of them um but I\nwas I was in this group of friends and\nwe were just like sending it and it was\nthe first time in my life where I wasn't\nworking I was fresh out of this\nrelationship I was just going there and\nI think that I\nhad always had to like really like nail\nmyself to the ground and I had always\nbeen just so incredibly nervous and for\nthe first time I just like didn't and I\nlike really let my judgment go when it\ncame to the people that were around me\nand we were all out and it was just\nsituation after situation\nwhere they were just not trustworthy and\nthen like the next thing you knew I was\nface up like laying down in like a\nbathroom stall in a hotel um bar just\nwaking up like 5: in the morning like\ncompletely alone and I woke up and I was\nlike I was just so confused\nand I had like blood on my pants and I\nwas really just like so caught off guard\nand I like looked down I had my phone\nand my purse and I looked down and I was\ncompletely alone in a bathroom stall and\nI looked at my phone and it was like\n5:00 in the morning I was like what\nhappened I was like I was out at like a\nparty with like my friends and I had\nmissed two texts from two people that I\nwas with at like\n10:30 the night before which was like 7\nhours had gone by that was like Hey I\nguess you left like we'll you know see\nyou when we see you and mind you I was\ndating somebody in the group at that\ntime and so I didn't go to this place\nalone and I had like a boyfriend or a\nsituation or whatever somebody that I\nwas at least with that just was nowhere\nto be found and so I still have no idea\nwhat happened no clue what happened but\nI was drugged and just like missing for\nlike 7 hours and and stopped being\nfriends with those\npeople and stopped doing as much\npartying as I was and told my parents\ntold some of my friends and um just kind\nof explained it in like a really matter\nOFA way and they were all very concerned\nand I didn't really even understand what\nwas happening cuz again I didn't recall\nanything that had happened and then a\ncouple months later we like really delve\ninto it and like I kind of started to\nlike have to to like deal with\neverything that happened um and was just\ncrying and so upset and very confused\nand then resentful of those friends that\nI was with but all that to say then like\na year later we wrote snow angel and I\nhad been saying to Alexander who I did\nthis whole album with like I really want\nto write a song about this I'd recounted\nthe situation so many times and after\nlike the 10th time of telling like a\ngroup of people that you know through\nmaybe just music sessions that you were\nlike drugged and you have no idea what\nhappened and you were like kind of into\ndrugs at one point but you don't really\nwant to talk about it but you do want to\nwrite a song about it and then just\nbeing\nlike then you kind of stop wanting to\nwrite that song naturally so I was like\nokay I guess I just won't write anything\nabout this um and then eventually\nAlexander like came back to me and was\nlike I really want to write that song\nthat you were talking to me about and I\nthink you and I should just do it\ntogether and I I was like okay and then\nwe started writing it and it was just\nthe two of us and frankly the whole time\nwe were writing it I felt nothing\nnothing like I was explaining all this\nstuff and I was like yeah and you can\nlike reference like the snow as whatever\nyou want to reference it as and things\nlike that and I felt nothing at all\nuntil we like had recorded the song the\nwhole thing was done and I played it for\na bunch of my friends and my manager and\neverybody was like this is insane but\nfor me that\nwhole year of my life was inherent\nresilience because not only was I like\nfighting through an experience I have no\nidea what happened to me lost friends\nfelt like I couldn't go out with anybody\nand trust anybody and then was like\ntrying to explain the situation in a way\nthat I understood it but I didn't really\nunderstand it and then wanted to write a\nsong about it and wanted to write an\nalbum about it but was also afraid to be\njudged for having something like that\nhappen to me but it's also like what did\nhappen so it was a whole thing up until\nwe decided to like name the album snow\nangel and have that be the song that to\nme was all resilient because I was just\nlike kind of cold-faced like fighting\nthrough everything and I still don't\nreally know how I feel about it I just\nknow that I feel weird and very\nresilient that's resilient for sure yeah\nthat's resilient for sure yeah for sure\nI mean have you ever been able to piece\nanything together from the night or not\nat all like just nothing that's that\nmust be\n[Music]\nso that's almost like so disconnecting\nfrom yeah very weird yeah no I have no\nidea and I just stopped talking to the\ngroup of people I was like I don't I\ndon't want to know what you know or\ndon't or what you claim to know or don't\nknow I just wanted to let it go yeah\nwhat what made\nyou trust him in the first place that\nyou now look back as a red flag and go I\nshould have been aware I really wanted\nto have fun like really really wanted to\nhave fun I had just gone through this\nbreakup and I had just changed a lot of\nmy life and I had just you know become\nvisible in like a different way in the\ncareer thing and I just wanted to like\nparty and have a good time I didn't go\nto college and I didn't have that\nexperience like to like let loose and\njust like chill and these were people\nthat I saw were really partying too much\nto a point and I just I wanted to have\nfun and I wanted people who knew knew\nnone of my friends who knew nothing\nabout my life who didn't know my ex who\ndidn't know two xes ago who knew nothing\nabout me and I was just like fresh new\ninto the group I don't know it was just\nlike it was exciting to have a group of\npeople that just did not care about\nanything else other than partying cuz I\ncared so much about everything else I\nwanted that like level of just like\nescape and not dealing with it and then\nI just escaped too far yeah how did they\nreact when you kind of started to\ndisconnect to be honest like it wasn't a\nbig deal like it\nwas it was nothing to them to lose a\nfriendship like that it was it wasn't a\nbig deal to them and that's you know\nwhatever I guess the only time that I\never heard like anything was like when I\nstarted to like really release music and\nstarted getting more attention for it\nsomebody was like Hey you know I would\nlove to talk to you about like the time\nand I'm just like no you don't like no\nyou don't no you don't and I feel like\nthat person obviously I mean you don't\njust disappear like randomly you just\ndon't as far as I'm concerned I could be\nway wrong and silly for thinking that\nbut\num yeah it wasn't a big deal to them it\nwas just nothing and I've I've made\npeace with it to just be like okay\nif that is how you react to something\nlike that happening to me then you don't\nvalue my life friendship and safety um\nin the way that I would value yours so\nit's best we just part ways and then we\njust never really talked\nagain that's hard as well to like yeah\nyeah how does that feel to you\nnow\num I trust people really fast and then\nwhen I don't trust someone I don't trust\nthem and I think it's very jarring for\npeople around me um sometimes but I'm\ngood at letting go very good at letting\ngo and I don't know if that's something\nthat I'm really good at because I've\nbeen burned one too many times I mean I\nwould rather be like with my group of\nfriends now and like not be at risk to\nlike be left alone and hurt and have\nwhatever happened happen then like be\nwith those people yeah I think I'm doing\nlike pretty good in my life where I\ndon't really feel like I need that and\nalso the idea of like wanting to party\nand have fun is not a bad thing yeah but\nit's like you know it's like it's almost\nlike it's so that wanting to have a\ngreat time and your intention is just\nlike hey I've got through this breakup I\nwant to party I want to have fun like\nthat doesn't seem like a terrible thing\nand so no and and I also I was worried\nabout how my friends and people who were\nimmediate in my life would like view me\nfor then having all this have happened\nto be like yeah okay so I was out with\nthis group of people X Y and Z happened\nwhatever I was very scared about how\nthat would look how did they respond\nthey were at the time they were much\nmore worried than I was aware of what\nwas happening cuz I really just brushed\nit off and honestly I think I was just\nin like kind of like a fight ORF flight\nthing just like okay well this happens\ngot to move on to be honest the next\nweekend I went to Coachella like I was\njust like okay whatever um my friends\nwere very concerned and we're really\nweirded out and we're I guess talking\nlike amongst each other more so than to\nme but we're really protective did you\nfeel like you had to move on fast in\norder so that people didn't take it too\nseriously because you wanted them to be\nokay with it and you didn't allow\nyourself to feel it yeah I also really\ndidn't want to\nknow what\nhappened I didn't want to find out what\nhappened and still yeah nope um and in a\nway I kind of do cuz I also am\nlike vengeful to be honest and I like in\na way want to know like who let what I\nyou know um but also I was just like\nokay move on like I don't want anybody\nto see me sweat in that way cuz then\nthat would be admitting that something\nbad actually did happen to me and I've\nnever had anything specifically like\nthat happened to me before and I thought\nit was a very like a a long shot of an\nidea like that's something you hear\nabout happening to like girls and people\nout who like get drugged and things like\nthat and that's not ever something that\nwould happen to me um so I just I wanted\nto move past it quickly yes it's that\ndenial as well don't want to get there\nAB absolutely how has that changed your\nway of now having fun and being able to\ngo out and being able to trust like how\nhas that impacted I have better friends\nnow talk about that group yeah I'm very\nI'm very lucky um I have good people in\nmy life I also am\nreally I think a more like honest\nversion of myself like if I don't trust\nsomeone they will know and odds are they\nwon't really be around me but also like\nI used to want everybody to be my friend\nso badly and don't get me wrong I still\nkind of do um but I like I wanted\neveryone's approval in a in the worst\nway when it came to a friend group I\ndon't necessarily feel like that anymore\nyeah I feel like I got taken advantage\nof obviously a lot in many ways but now\nI don't really feel like that happens to\nme as much m yeah it's almost like how\nfar are we willing to go away from\nourselves to get someone else's approval\noh my God I would have ran to the ends\nof the Earth yeah once you made that\nsong uh how as you were saying you were\ntrying to put it in and you were trying\nto get your team finally Alexander you\nsaid yeah finally like you know\nunderstood and was listening and how did\nit then feel to put that out there in\nthe world to then obviously you've\ntalked about with your family your\nfriends and now for everyone to hear it\nhow did that feel it was honestly weird\nfor the first couple months cuz I was\nlike\nI what I\nwanted was for the song to live on its\nown and have its own kind of existence\nwithout my experience attached to it so\nthat people could take it in in a way\nthat they weren't listening to the song\nand feeling like pity for me in a way I\nwanted everybody to have their own\nexperience with it cuz again\nthis is a very specific song sure I also\nhowever would find myself like getting\nso\nfrustrated like wanting to like talk\nabout it and just like blurt it out\nbefore I was like fully\nlike not ready to but like before I was\nready to like actually like make this\nlike okay this is a thing now the album\nis out it was like a weird back and\nforth cuz also I'm still very like Angry\nfrom the situation as much as I want to\nlike move past it and push past it would\nit would just float between like I\nreally like nobody knowing what this is\nabout and also like I want revenge like\nyou know what I mean and and revenge for\nme is just like talking about it I guess\nbut yeah it went it went both ways I am\nhowever really really really glad that\npeople got to sit with it and take their\nkind of experiences with it but it was\nreally interesting seeing people's\ninterpretations of the song because\nsomebody was like oh my God yeah when\nit's cold outside it's brutal and I was\nlike yeah girl like that is amazing that\nyou feel that way I was like art really\nis subjective yeah it was weird for a\nminute it was so weird have you ever had\npeople reach out to you and to tell you\nabout their experiences of similar\nthings happening or nobody has and not\nthat I've seen anything because I don't\neven feel like I it's really suggested\nincredibly in the song but um unless you\nlike\nknow you won't know yeah you won't know\nbut I have however had um had a couple\npeople talk to me about like their own\nexperience with because these are people\nwho have been through some sort of like\ndrug or alcohol related like thing or\nwhat have you and been like hey like I\nreally really like this song for my own\nreason and I've been in and out of XYZ\nsituation and this has been really\nhelpful for me and there have been a\ncouple times where like obviously I\nhaven't like said anything but like you\nknow when you're talking to somebody and\nyou're like not saying exactly what what\nit is but like you can kind of both tell\nin each other's eyes that there's like\nsomething much deeper happening than\nwhat you're both saying it's that kind\nof like camaraderie and like I see you\nwithout like saying it yes absolutely\nyeah which has been really comforting\nit's sad that you can connect on that or\nunderstand each other but at least you\nfeel understood and held in that moment\ntotally thank you for sharing that with\nus I mean it's like it's just oh yeah\nit's just I mean you know I think that\nwhenever we go through things go through\nthings where we don't have control and\nwe don't have Consciousness even you\nknow what I speak of control it's it's\nso disconnecting from the self because\nyou were disconnected from a from a\nperiod of time from yourself what have\nbeen the things today that you feel\nconnect you to yourself like what are\nthe things that you love to do that make\nyou kind of you know smile in love and\nyou know bring joy to you I am I love\ntalking to people I love talk I'm I'm\nsuch a like extroverted introvert I I\nreally like I relating is my favorite\nthing in the whole world and and whether\nit's like actually relating or having\nsomeone else or myself feel understood\neven if it's not necessarily relating I\nlove that I love writing songs writing\nsongs is my greatest weapon in this life\nit's my favorite thing in the whole wide\nworld and I also honestly the thing that\nI like love most in my life right now is\nlike I love watching my little brother\ngrow up that's kind of like a complete\nsegue but yeah he's like he's only a\ncouple years younger than me but he's\nlike totally my baby and so I'm like\nreally trying to like cherish watching\nhim like grow up so yeah again it's like\nthe all the like people connections I'm\nlike I love the people in my life very\nmuch yeah yeah my my younger sister's\nlike five years younger than me and so I\nremember like when she was born I\nremember holding her and she's getting\nmarried in\nand she's 30 years old 31 now and it's\njust like such a you know it's I feel\nthe same way like she's like my baby and\nmy baby is getting married like it's a\nit's a crazy feeling my God it's insane\nyeah it's insane were you like a like a\nlike an emotionally Ava it's kind of an\nevasive question I guess but were you\nlike an emotionally available older s\nolder sibling I have a really good\nrelationship with my sister and like she\nsees me that way as well so yeah\ndefinitely I would say I was and I would\nsay that as she got older though I kind\nof intentionally I wouldn't say\ndistanced myself but I intentionally\ngave her space to build up those skills\nherself and so I started that's smart\nI'm not doing that with my brother well\nyou still have time I'm not doing I'm\nlike Charles how do you feel about\neverything that's actually very smart\nyeah I just realized over time where it\nwas like I didn't want her to wait to\nwake up one day if I wasn't around or\nwhatever it was or even right now I live\nacross you know the world right the idea\nthat she didn't have the tools and\nskills herself and I was really trying\nto help her build those tools and skills\nherself and I'm really proud that she's\nbeen able to do that and it's taken\nyears of doing that but it's almost like\nI wish it's almost like when you know\nwhen you first start riding a bike you\nhave the stabilizers and your parent\npush the bike yeah and then your parents\nstop holding on to the bike and you just\nhave the stabilizer maybe fall off\ntotally and then you put the stabilizer\nand then they get taken off but it isn't\nlike your parent like pushing you on a\nbike like when you're 21 years old and\nso I feel like with mentorship with\ncoaching with anyone that I work with\nlike the goals always like how did they\ndevelop the tools themselves oh that's\ncool what what kind of tools do you\nthink you you're wanting to pass on what\nare the lessons that oh my God cuz\nthere's only a twoyear gap so yeah\nyou're like accelerating your learning\noh my God I know I I like I really want\nGod my brother is so much like me in my\nlike worst and best ways I just want him\nto like not beat himself up so much I\nwent through so Grant granted I'm\ntalking about I still absolutely do I\ndon't how however to the extent that I\nused to I used to beat myself up into\nbad bad places I it was tough like I\nagain like I couldn't sit with myself I\ncouldn't say something that I was proud\nof because it would be every thought I\nhad would be met with something else I\ndidn't do um and I really want that for\nhim really really badly because I don't\nI don't\nwant I don't want anybody to beat\nthemselves up the way that I beat myself\nup Jesus Christ it it was exhausting I\ncan tell you fir hand it's very\nexhausting nobody nobody else should\nreally have to go through that I don't\nthink what age was that do you think you\nwere like the harshest critic oh my God\nI mean I feel like it honestly just\nstarted to be honest when I started\ndoing music and when I got signed like\nin June of 2022 my life changed a ton a\nton because also I was working in a\nenvironment with a bunch of people who\nwere choosing to be there and choosing\nto show up for me and choosing to help\nsupport and and and Foster the thing\nthat I wanted so badly and I felt like I\nhad big support like I felt like I had\nbig guns behind me which was a huge huge\nboost of confidence and also made me\nwant to work really hard to prove to\neverybody that believed in me and was\ninvesting time and and money let's be\nclear into me um that I was worth it and\nI don't know I just felt really like\nuplifted and I hadn't felt that in a lot\nof like working situations before I felt\nlike everybody actually really cared\nwhat I had to say for the first time and\nI had never felt that specifically in\nwork never so it was really nice to have\nthat wow yeah yeah it's it's amazing\nisn't it it's like we we're constantly\nlooking again for that external just\nkind of just make me yeah it's hard and\nit's always it's we so programmed that\nway I write music for a living like I\nmake songs for a living for people to\nlisten to like you know what I mean like\nin a way that's inherently that and\nthat's not to say that I don't do it for\nmyself at all I absolutely do but like\nyou know yeah I go to a concert to\nperform not for people to not have fun\nand not enjoy it yeah what do you think\nthat when you were obviously you didn't\nyou didn't go to college because you\nwere trying to you know get into the\nindustry you were just saying that when\nyou were young you wanted to you know\nfigure out the Disney thing or figure\nout this thing whatever abely like\nimagine you\nwere sitting with 10-year-old Ren right\nnow mhm what does she need to hear\nI similar to\nhave lived with a lot of years of\nbeating myself\nup I used to just live with this like\ninherent like guilt and regret like a\ncloud over me like just in a big way and\nI used to think that like oh I would\ntell my younger s to do like this and\nthis and this better or like this and\nthis and this or I am now like really\ndeciding to like not regret any of it\nthat's not to say that I don't want to\nhold myself accountable for things that\nI've done that aren't great or for\nthings that I inevitably will do that\nare not good um or that you know don't\nserve myself or other people that's a\nseparate conversation this is more about\nI'm really so incredibly proud of like\nsuch a lively spunky monstrous little\nlike 10 old girl who was so Fearless so\nFearless like I was a rambunctious kid I\nwas crazy I was inviting everybody in\nthe neighborhood to my concerts on the\nfireplace I was forcing people to come\nand listen to me sing I was screaming\nfor people to pay attention to me and\nI'm really really glad that I did that\nand I I would just say like do\neverything how you feel like you're\ngoing to and when you mess up just\nlisten to yourself that you've you've\nmessed up yeah I would honestly just say\nlike everything she did was great happy\nto be here in in you know failures and\nin wins you've talked about being so\nself-aware and you can hear it when\nyou're you know when I'm talking to you\ntoday I'm like there's there's such an\nawareness of who you were there's such\nan awareness of who you are what you're\nfeeling at this stage in your life what\nare you hoping to unlearn for the future\nand learn for the future if there was\none thing you had to unlearn that you've\ndeveloped and if there was one thing you\nhad to learn what would you say they are\nI would say something that I would like\nto learn is how to like I'm I'm so hyper\naware of when I do this in situations\nand I try so hard not to whenever\nsomeone is talking about something that\nthey've experienced with somebody else\nlike if somebody has hurt their feelings\nright like if my best friend is talking\nto me about someone who has hurt them or\nharmed them or done them wrong in the\nsmallest or biggest sense of the word\nall I can think in my brain is like when\nhave I done that in my life life and\njust start like spiraling down this like\nI remember when I did that to so and so\nand like I need to call this person and\nbe like I am so sorry for what I put you\nthrough and we were like four like you\nknow what I mean and I really would like\nto not Center myself in what somebody\nelse is talking about and it's not at\nleast it's not consciously a selfish\nthing like I'm not actively trying to\nmake my friends grievance about myself\nit's just antic I do and I hate it cuz\nthen I'm also like oh my God now I'm not\nas present with like my friend who's\nbeing so sweet and vulnerable as me um\nand now I'm doing a disservice to her by\nby not you know listening to her fully\nand and being so hyperconscious of like\nhow I've acted or how I could have\npossibly showed up that way I really\nwant to unlearn that I'm trying so hard\nnot to do that I hate when I do that um\ngranted if I just keep beating myself up\nfor it then I'm going to do it for the\nrest of my life and then I'm never going\nto like give myself Grace for it um\nsomething that I want to well I guess\nthat's kind of learning and unlearning\nand another thing that I want to like\nlearn or unlearn I need a little more\nlike internal patience I need internal\npatience I need internal patience and\nexternal\njudgment really quick like I really need\na lot of internal patience I also need\nto like not give people who have hurt me\nor done me wrong as much slack like it's\nokay to like say that\nlike no thank you I'm good at like being\ndone when I'm done but it takes me a\nsecond right you know like I think like\nwith that group of friends like I should\nhave taken maybe two things that\nhappened before I ended up like face up\nyou know before that yeah it doesn't\nneed to get to that extreme correct\nthose are great answers those are great\nanswers how have you how have you kind\nof navigated the the you know again\nwe're talking about change you've talked\nabout before like I think you were\nstruggling with the eating disorder when\nyou were 10 you've talked obviously\nabout how you've had the you know the\ngrayer area of your sexuality like\nfiguring that out like how have you got\ncomfortable navigating like the gray\nwhen it comes to like eating disorders I\nthink at least and this is not\nnecessarily everyone else's opinion but\nhow I perceive it myself is eating\ndisorders are something that you are\nalways going to deal with and always\ngoing to have right and this is not to\ncompare it to alcoholism because it is\nin nowhere um the same or different or\nwhat whatever it's not a comparison but\nit is to say that like with alcohol you\ncan decide to put yourself in situations\nwhere there is going to be alcohol there\nor not or like you are going to decide\nwhether to drink or not you are never\ngoing to decide whether you can eat or\nnot you have to you have to and again\nthat is not to like put down or make\nlittle of alcoholism or any sort of\nstruggle like that my dad has been sober\nmy whole life but is an alcoholic um and\nthis is something we talk about\nconstantly and try to better understand\neach other it's hard with an eing\ndisorder that is just constantly going\nto be around you you have to eat to\nsurvive um so that's a constant gray\narea for me I feel like I talk about it\nevery day so it's always just like how\ndid I do with it today or how am I going\nto do with it tomorrow mind it's like\nliving in a gray area which is really\nfrustrating because I think to myself a\nlot like I would love for this to be\ngone but it is just not something that\nI'm never going to deal with if I want\nto continue to be alive I'm going to be\neating and I'm going to have food around\nme and that's going to make me feel\ncrazy some days and out of control and\ninsecure and really proud of myself and\nin full control other days so there's a\ngray area with that constantly when it\ncomes to like\nsexuality that's a whole other gray area\nthat like at least for\nme I over the last like six or seven\nmonths have become less gray at least\nright now but I think Le this is going\nto sound so silly but like I try to and\ngranted this is also very easy for me to\nsay cuz like I am a queer person who\nlike is still at the end of the day like\na white woman and is cisgender and like\nI also am bisexual so like I'm going to\nbe in heteronormative relationships\ninevitably just based off of being\nbisexual potentially I think for me it\nis easy to say but I try to like view\nlike the gray area or times when I'm\nlike struggling for like a label if I\ndon't feel like I'll go through\nconversations with like my like\ngirlfriend constantly if I'll be like I\nactually feel incredibly not bisexual\nright now like and it's it's silly but\nthere are things we talk about all the\ntime both of us with each other and I'm\njust going to try to view it as like a\nlittle pink area like it's all good it's\nall cool it's pink it's good it's good\nwhatever it is like if I one day feel\nlike this label or whatever or lack\nthereof does not suit me then that's\ngreat and that does not suit me and I'm\nvery fortunate to be able to make that\ndecision and have that not affect my\nlife in an incredibly massive way a lot\nof other people are not but I view it as\na little pink area it's just good I'm\ntrying not to be so angry with myself\nabout it I struggle to like want\na a rhyme and a reason and a label and a\nseason to make sense every single day\nand I'm just not there yeah and I don't\nthink a lot of people are so I think\nit's fine like straight people at least\nas far as I'm concerned don't like wake\nup every day and are like oh my God what\nlevel of straight am I today and then if\nyou are one of those people you're\nlikely queer so you know yeah yeah we're\nso hardwired to be like you have to\nchoose an answer right I think whether\nit was school whether it was parents it\nwas like was one right answer you had to\nfigure it out there were no other\noptions there was no great you're either\nright or wrong and so I think we still\nlive in the right or wrong and so it's\nreally hard to be like well if I don't\nhave the right answer I must have the\nwrong answer but I know this isn't wrong\nbecause it's how I feel so then how do I\nmake it right and it's so confusing and\nso I love the pink I love the P the P\nthis is just a little pink area like I'm\njust chilling in the B\nnice I love it Renee you've been so\nhonorable so gracious so kind with your\ntime today uh I'm so grateful to get to\nknow you today and thank you for letting\nus into your mind you know I really feel\nwhen I was sitting with you today I was\nlike you really just kind of opened up\nyour mind and and let us walk in and I\nappreciate that because it's hard to do\nthat and I felt like you opened up some\ncupboards and some drawers and you know\nuh but Renee we end every on purpose\nepisode with a Fast Five these final\nfive have to be answered in one word to\none sentence maximum okay I may ask you\nto expand and I'll let you know all\nright so Renee these are your final five\nor Fast Five question one what is the\nbest advice you've ever heard or\nreceived Integrity over\neverything okay great second question\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nheard or received just stop trying to\ncare my God I used to hear that all the\ntime going God yeah you are going to\ncare I'm like are you kidding me now I\ncare more because I care about not\ncaring ridiculous oh God that's a good\none we never had that on the show before\nI like that all right question number\nthree what's a part of yourself that\nyou're most deeply trying to love this\nis very two things for me first first\nand foremost my mistakes things that\nI've done that I don't agree with the\nthings that I've done that I'm not proud\nof I'm trying to like make peace with\nthem I guess is a better word and do\nbetter from them and second like\nhonestly is somebody like with\nincredible incredible you know lengths\nof difficulty of Eating Disorders like\nmy like body and like the like skin that\nI like live in and like my like vessel\nthat I just like operate in very very\nhard for me so hard for\nme thank you okay question number four\nwhat's something that you think people\nvalue but you don't really value keeping\nit cool all the time oh interesting I'm\nvery Pro and and this is just who I am I\nguess maybe how I was raised or how I\nwork I'm not\nsure I I love to just like let your\nemotions get the best of themselves\nsometimes I think that's really\nimportant at least it is for me I'm very\nvery anti keep it in and deal with it\nand like try to regulate your emotions I\nthink that like if you need them to be\nbig in a way let them be big in a way\nthat feels like safe and and careful for\nlike yourself and the people you're\naround cuz if not then that's just so\nstupid I was I was shamed for so many\nyears my this is is not a short answer I\nwas ashamed for so many years of my life\nfor being so hyper emotional and crying\nso much and like getting angry so fast\num and that is something I just I don't\nvalue the like being quiet and like the\ncontrolling your emotions and keeping\nthings at Bay I value like being very\ntrue to how you feel whether that's a\ngood feeling or not that's powerful yeah\nthat's and how have you found a way of\ndoing that in a way that it doesn't you\nsaid you said a statement you're like to\nbe mindful of like you didn't say for\nwhat you said to be aware of how it\naffects yourself and people you love\nlike how do you kind of get that because\nsometimes like you said an emotion could\nbe so big and so real and so visceral\nbut then how do you kind of how have you\nfound a way to do that or at least how\nare you trying to find a way to do that\nI have in beating myself up less I'm not\nlike a physical danger to myself um\nwhich is great cuz I used to like get\nreally really really angry and like I\nwould like you\nknow so many people do I don't know like\nwhat it is or what it isn't my dad and I\nhave talked about this at length because\nhe said he did the same thing as as as I\ndid as a kid but like I would either\nlike like bang my head against the wall\nor like like hit my arms or things like\nthat or like tweak out or freak out and\nThe more I've stopped like beating\nmyself up for it and The more I've just\nbeen like oh these are just things that\nI feel and I feel in a really big way\nand the more I'm around people who allow\nme to feel in a big way the the less I\nhurt myself mhm mhm the less I like feel\nthe need to like bang my head against\nthe wall I feel like if I'm around\nsomebody who's like oh this is upsetting\nyou that's okay that that's that upsets\nyou I don't even get to that point so\nfor me it's about like the company I\nkeep and the things that people are\nsaying to me um that being said I also\nknow that like certain people in my life\nlike my mom for instance is the\ngreatest my mom does not like to see see\nme incredibly upset all the time and\nthat's not to say she can't deal with me\nupset but that is to say that I'm an\nadult and I know that I don't want to\nput my mother through turmoil every day\nby calling her and telling the telling\nher the 10 things that upset me because\nshe lives 3,000 miles away from me and\nwe'll Panic you know so it's like it's\nabout going to the right people and I go\nto her of course but like not in a way\nthat is going to upset her or hurt her\nday cuz I you know she's my mom but yeah\nyeah I think the company you keep is\nimportant Fifth and final question okay\nif you could create we also to every\nsingle guest who's ever been on
