much for\nsubscribing it means the world to me the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nI've been talking to a friend\nand one of the biggest challenges she's\ngoing through is that\nmen tend to want to have a relationship\nwith her even though she tends to want\nto be friends with them and is open\npotentially at some point in the future\nto it going somewhere else but he's not\nputting herself out there saying I want\nto be in a relationship I want a day she\nwants to just build up good connections\ngood friendships and what ends up\nhappening is that she ends up in these\nscenarios where\nmen are then sometimes guilting shaming\nbullying her into believing that there's\nsomething more here and that she's\ndenying it and she feels really\nuncomfortable because deep down she\ncares about this individual she admires\nthem appreciates them but she just\ndoesn't see them romantically and I\nthink what's really hard is the deeper\npoint that I think is more Universal\nthat a lot of people can connect with is\nyou care about someone just not in that\nway so you don't know how to keep a\ndistance at the same time you don't want\nto be intimate with them does that make\nsense yeah it absolutely does and I\nthink that the the problem people have\nis that they feel like I don't want to\nhurt this person\nand at the same time they're not\nthinking about what matters in this\nfriendship to me so it doesn't sound\nlike a great friendship if the other\nperson is telling you no you actually\nfeel this other way\nso you want to talk about are you\nwilling are you interested in being\nfriends with me because I'm not\ninterested in anything else and part of\nbeing friends with me is hearing what I\nhave to say and believing me otherwise I\ndon't think we're gonna have a\nfriendship that's healthy so if you want\nto be in my life I would like to be in\nyour life if you want that then I need\nyou to believe me when I tell you this\nis how I feel and not try to push me\ninto something that doesn't feel\ncomfortable to me and then that person\ncan really think do I want this person\nin my life knowing this is their hard\nboundary but people don't say it that\nway they feel like I'm going to hurt\nthis person or they start arguing with\nthe person if you find yourself arguing\nwith someone about how you feel that's\nnot a great friendship and that's so\nhard right I feel today so many of these\nconversations are happening over text\nyes or messaging these on face-to-face\nconversations\nthey're happening in a way where you're\nwriting this much someone's responding\nreply back\nwhen you find that this goes on and on\nand on and it can kind of spiral for\ndays sometimes weeks\nhow do you kind of accept that it might\nbe time to\ndraw a line maybe distance or disconnect\nand move on even though that's painful\nor what is that moment where you can\nkind of just say I'm gonna honor myself\nI'm gonna honor what I wanted from this\nfriendship that doesn't exist anymore\nyou know first of all I think that this\nthing about text is really important I\nhave so many clients who come into\ntherapy and they'll say you know we had\nthis conversation and they'll tell me\nthis conversation that went on and on\nand on and on and I'm thinking how did\nthis conversation go on were they there\nfor five hours what happened and it\nturns out they've been texting for days\nabout it yeah and I said why didn't you\njust have this conversation face to face\nand they say well that would have been\ntoo hard but look how hard it is to have\nit on text I think it's so much harder\nto have it on text because when you're\ntogether you're actually connecting even\nif it's difficult even if you're saying\nsome things that might cause some\ndiscomfort it's easier actually to do it\nin person so it's kind of paradoxical\nthat people think I'm going to protect\nmyself and somebody else by doing this\non tag text because you're not\nprotecting anyone it's easier to have a\nchallenging conversation in person it\ngoes so much better how have you\nencouraged people to take that leap into\nhaving difficult conversations across\nrelationships not just in this scenario\nin person because it's exactly what you\njust said people feel anxious they feel\nlike they won't know how to control\ntheir emotions they feel they might say\nsomething they don't mean or the other\nperson might say something they're not\nready to hear and I find more and more\npeople whether it's in the workplace\nwhether it's in their marriage whether\nit's in a friendship struggle to have\ndifficult conversations face to face\nwhat are some of the practices or\nmethods or tools that you've shared with\npeople to help them do that well first\nof all I think that people establish\npatterns in a relationship very early on\nI always say that relationships are like\ncement so in the beginning there's a\nlittle flexibility so the other person\nis texting you when you want to have a\nconversation you can kind of mold that\nby saying hey let's talk in person but\nif you keep texting them then the cement\ndries and that becomes the pattern in\nthe relay relationship with anything so\nmany people put up with a lot at the\nbeginning of a relationship because they\nthink this person has all these other\ngreat qualities so what if they can't\nreally have a conversation with me right\num you know I have so much fun with them\nor I can fix them or over time I'll\nbring this up later but I don't want to\nbring it up now because we're early in\nthe relationship no no that's the time\nyou should bring it up because the\ncement is drying and it dries quickly so\npatterns get established so if the\ncement is dry and then you try to change\nit and say let's have a face-to-face\nconversation but you guys have been\ntexting about things for months instead\nof talking about them it's really hard\nto change that so I would say very early\non establish what you want in a\nrelationship and if the other person\nisn't down for it that's really good\ninformation to have early on it's almost\nlike well now if you want to talk to me\nabout in person it must be high stakes\nyes it almost like amplifies how\nsignificant this moment is when it\nshouldn't be that way it should be the\nnorm if someone is doing it later on in\na relation how do they do it in a way\nthat doesn't feel like this is\ngroundbreaking or this is we need to\ntalk yeah yeah it's it's really it's\nactually pretty straightforward and and\nI know I know it's it's hard to do in\nthe moment but to be able to just make\nthat shift in the relationship and say\nyou know what I know we've been texting\nabout this stuff but I think it'll be so\nmuch better for us and so much easier to\ntalk about this in person and then you\nsee will the other person show up well\nthese will they keep texting you or will\nthey say sure let's get together let's\ntalk about it yeah I feel like a lot of\npeople just keep texting because because\nwhat they're afraid of is they're afraid\nthat it's going to be harder that again\nlike like they're going to drop some big\nbombshell and you're saying no I just\nwant us to be able to be in a room\ntogether and talk about anything\nyeah absolutely all right great well I\nhope\nfriend if you're listening I hope that\nanswers your question another one that\nkept coming up from our audience there\nwere a couple of people who felt this\nway was around and I want to spend some\ntime in actually we'll go back and forth\nwe'll go back and forth we'll come back\nto relationships one of the biggest ones\nthat we obviously get a lot about is\nsocial anxiety and a lot of the\nquestions that came up and some of the\nstories that I dived into was people\njust struggling with being around big\ngroups people going to\nevents or parties or even their friend's\nhome where other people are there\nstruggling to strike up a conversation\nfeeling lonely and disconnected even in\na crowd\nfeeling uncomfortable being able to\nshare what they're doing and feeling\nconfident about what they're doing let's\ntalk about where's the root of some of\nthat social anxiety coming from I know\nit can be many different things what are\nthe variety of things it can be and what\nhave you seen some of the ways of\nhelping people understand that anxiety\nbetter rather than staying at home\nkeeping away and maybe not encouraged to\ngo out and meet people so I think that\nwhatever we're experiencing is\nrelational and so a lot of times\nrelational issues or childhood issues in\nDisguise and even with social anxiety so\nfor example if you have a story that\nyou've been told when you were younger\nlike I'm not good enough or I don't\nmeasure up or you know people are going\nto criticize me whatever your experience\nhad been you're going to project that\nonto all of your relationships as an\nadult so social anxiety is usually\nsomething about I will not be liked I\nwill not be loved and that has to do\nwith how you were liked or loved when\nyou were younger if you haven't\nprocessed that and work that out so I\nthink that it's about kind of rewriting\nyour story before you say you know I'm\nnot going to go to that event what is\nwhat am I afraid of when am I afraid\nsomeone's going to think and is that\ntrue and do I have evidence from other\nparts of my life now as an adult that\nit's not true I think unfortunately the\nstories that people told us about\nourselves are about the Storyteller\nmeaning it was the person you know in\nour past who had mental health issues or\nthey had their own insecurities and they\nprojected them onto their children they\nwere limited they didn't know how to\ninteract they didn't know how to love\nand then they criticized their children\nor they neglected their children or they\ncouldn't hear them or see them or value\nthem they couldn't feel that that\nexcitement around like I love who this\nhuman being is\nand I think then that gets internalized\nand then you grow up and you think\neverybody in the world thinks that about\nme and a it's just not true that other\npeople think that but more importantly\nit's just not true that you are whatever\nstory you were told about you so you\nneed to say what is the true story and\nthen you go into that environment with\nthe true story and it doesn't mean you\nhave to go to a party with a hundred\npeople it means maybe I open up to a\nfriend a little bit more maybe I try\nhanging out with a group of three people\nand see what that's like and you kind of\nexperiment and when you see that this\nstory this old story doesn't seem to be\nplaying out in these new situations you\nget more confident going into bigger and\nbigger situations yeah it's those baby\nsteps and I often surprise people when I\ntell them that I'm\nin some cases so much more of an\nintrovert than I am an extrovert and\nit's so it's kind of confusing for\npeople because\nI generally am in places where I can be\nmy extra itself but if I go to an event\nwhere I don't know anyone I'm likely to\ntry and find one person that I can have\na really deep meaningful conversation\nwith rather than working the room or\ntrying to connect with loads of people\nbecause I feel so much happier and\nfulfilled if I can walk away from an\nevent and go wow I met one person and we\nhave so much in common and we share so\nmany values and now I'm actually going\nto keep in touch with that person as\nopposed to the idea of like well oh my\nGod I feel the pressure that I need to\ntalk to 20 people here and I should be\nnetworking and I should be exchanging\nnumbers and whatever it may be which\nisn't how I like to operate and so I\nlove that idea of those baby steps and\nand starting small yeah yeah and I also\nthink there's a difference between being\nan introvert I'm exactly like you in the\nsense of I really like to have these\ndeep conversations and I'd rather be\nwith fewer people and have a deeper\nconnection than be with more people and\nhave a more superficial connection but\nat the same time I feel like it's one\nthing to say I would rather have these\nsort of smaller more intimate\nconversations but I'm not anxious going\ninto them and so I think what you're\ntalking about with social anxiety is I'm\nanxious to just reveal the truth of who\nI am to anybody I'm I'm worried about\nshowing up and being found wanting\nyeah and I think that is what what a lot\nof people are struggling with so I guess\ndoes it help then having a question you\nwant to ask people does it help I I\nfound that for people that I work with\nwhen they struggle because they're like\nwhat do we talk about I don't want to\nsit there and talk about the weather or\nI don't want to talk about the news or\nand it was like having a question to\nopen with to ask to share with someone\nand being confident to share on that\nquestion felt like something that\ndefinitely has helped me and help people\nI know where\nyou also know that you do feel\ncomfortable sharing that part of your\nlife have you found any other tools or\nmethods that have helped individuals in\nthose spaces what you're saying is so\ntrue and I think that's curiosity that I\nthink when people feel anxious they feel\nlike they have to tell a story that's\nentertaining they have to keep the\nperson from being bored with whatever\nthey're talking about people like to\ntalk about themselves so if you're and I\ndon't mean that in kind of a\nnarcissistic way I mean that people like\nit when you show interest in them\nand we don't a lot of people don't ask\nother people about themselves enough\nyeah so when they have an opportunity\nfor a person who genuinely is curious\nthis isn't just some kind of strategy\nfor your social anxiety it's actually a\nway to relate to people I'm genuinely\ncurious to get to know you and you ask\nquestions about their life they're going\nto be really interested in interacting\nwith you yeah and and I think what's\neven more true about what you're saying\nis that everyone's feeling that way and\ntherefore everyone feels like everyone\nis uninterested in everyone else yes and\nso I've been to events with people\nbefore and they've come with me and\nthey've said oh that person was so cold\nor that person seemed like they had an\nego and I was like well no I know that\nthat person just feels uncomfortable in\nthese settings and it's weird how we all\njust look at each other and we kind of\nmake these judgments of like oh they\nwere called they brushed me off yeah but\nactually everyone's just feeling quite\nanxious as opposed to having this like\nVendetta against you or some sort of and\nobviously there could be something else\nas you get to know them better but it's\nworth giving someone the benefit of the\ndoubt and stepping it out there yeah and\nI also think another thing that turns\npeople off is when you ask about sort of\nexternal things like tell me about what\nyou do tell me about your work right\nbecause then it feels like oh are they\ntrying to network with me or do they\nactually want to get to know me you know\nyou can ask something like where did you\ngrow up yes something as simple as that\nand they're like oh I grew up here oh\nreally wow you know that's so different\nfrom where I grew up or I grew up\nsomewhere similar and you know did you\nhave siblings did you what was that like\nhow did you end up here just get their\nstory absolutely yeah I I think you're\nspot on I I think the work question is\nkind of\nit's kind of faded away I feel like it's\nhow people used to talk and connect and\nyou're so right I think now everyone\nalways feels like what's the agenda here\nbut asking about yeah for me when I'm at\na birthday party like how do you know\nthe person whose birthday is how do you\nknow the person who's getting married\nlike how are you connected to them I\nfound that to be a much healthier\nquestion and then as you were just\nsaying now like I love asking people\nwhere they're from because I'm from\nLondon I've lived in New York I live\nhere now it's like it's great for me to\nlearn about the United States because\npeople are from all over the place here\nand places I've never heard of or never\nbeen to it can be an education and all\nof a sudden it's you can see someone\nopening up and it's easy for most people\nto mention where they grew up or where\nthey started rather than a question\nabout like\ntheir job or whatever it may be right\nbecause that always feels there's so\nmuch pressure with that am I successful\nenough am I telling the right story or\nif you are successful I don't want to\nmake them feel bad you know so there's\nall this stuff underneath\num whereas we're just connecting human\nto human with tell me about yourself\ntell me about your story yeah absolutely\nall right now I want to switch into back\ninto relationships because it seems to\nbe a big one\nand this is something that\na couple of people that came to our\naudience have been struggling with\nand it was this idea of being with\nsomeone or dating someone but you don't\nlike their work ethic or you don't think\nthey are focused enough so these people\nsay that I'm very hard working I'm very\nfocused I've started dating this person\nwho I like a lot of qualities they have\nbut something I really obviously value\nis someone who's driven and ambitious\nand a doer but I'm not really seeing\nthat in them does this relationship have\na chance to last does it have a future\nor am I always gonna feel this way this\nreminds me of this saying you you don't\nchoose a partner a la carte you can't\njust order up all the qualities that you\nwant you know I want them to I want them\nto be sensitive and I want them to be\nkind and I want them to be super driven\nand ambitious and I want you know you\nyou get what you get and there's going\nto be all these different qualities and\nif that's really important to you and\nyou are going to feel like I want to\nchange this person then that's doomed\nthat the person is who they are now it's\ndifferent if the person says I'm working\non this for myself this is something\nthat I'm trying to do this is my area of\ngrowth right now and maybe you might say\nhow can I support you\nand then you only do what they ask you\ndon't do more than they asked in terms\nof supporting that but if you want\nsomeone who comes you know\nintrinsically driven in that way that's\nprobably not a good partner for you and\nand I guess the\nthe Counterpoint is also true that you\nmay discover someone ambitious and\ndriven but they may not have the other\nqualities but I think it's obviously\nwhat researchers today are calling the\nParadox of choice right we've heard that\nso many times and I think today because\nthere is so much more choice or at least\nthe perception that there is so much\nmore choice I think there is a belief\nthat people have I don't want to settle\nI believe this person does exist that\nwill have all of these things\nhow have you navigated that with clients\nwhen they're telling you I feel like I'm\ngetting older I'm worried about my body\nclock I'm scared about you know not\nfinding someone I'm getting pressure\nfrom my parents and my friends but at\nthe same time I don't want to settle\nwhich is a completely Fair valid feeling\nright at the same time you're saying\nwell you can't order someone a la carre\nand so how do we kind of how does how do\nyou help people grapple with those I\nguess conflicting ideas or what at least\nseems that way I think you have to know\nwhat your deal breakers are but they\nhave to be the right kind of deal\nbreakers so I want people to kind of let\ngo of some of the things that research\nshows doesn't matter for a happy lasting\nrelationship and I want people to have\nhigher standards ironically about what\ndoes so the character issues you know is\nthis person a kind person the two most\nimportant predictors of whether a\nrelationship will succeed are emotional\nstability are you do you both have\nemotional stability are you whole in\nthat way I don't mean like you're\nfinished right I just mean that you can\nself-regulate you can have a\nconversation you don't act out in\negregious ways you're honest those kinds\nof things and the other one is\nflexibility\num you it's really hard to be in a\nrelationship with someone who's very\nrigid\nso those are two things really to think\nabout but in terms of the character\nqualities that should be the big deal\nbreakers is this person responsible do\nthey say do they mean what they say how\ndo they show up what do they do under\nstress\nthat's really important because you will\nexperience that in the course of your\nlives together do they have a sense of\nhumor right in when things are stressful\ncan can we still hold those\ncontradictions of this is hard and we\ncan support each other make each other\nlaugh you know the things that people\nget hung up on are oh I'm not sure that\nthat career is the career that I want so\nto be with someone right as opposed to\nwow they're really passionate about this\nthing that's a really cool quality so\nmaybe they won't make as much money but\nbetween what I make and they what they\nmake will that work for us\nso you know letting go is sort of like a\nlot of these fantasies that we're told\ngrowing up we should be looking for in a\npartner versus who do you want to spend\ntime with every day who is the person\nthat you really enjoy spending time with\nwho you also feel safe with and I think\nsafety is so important I feel safe with\nthis person because I know that the the\nrug is not going to be pulled out from\nunder me yeah that's such great advice I\nlove hearing about\nthe things that should be deal breakers\nand the things that shouldn't and I want\nto talk about those first two I find\nthat\nso much growth today and maybe it's\nalways been this way but so much of our\ngrowth is happening while we're with\npeople it's not happening in that we\nsolved it before we were 18 or 21 and\nnow we move on to a relationship and I\ndon't think people are often getting the\nbest versions of people you're getting\nthe work in progress version at all\ntimes like you said no one's ever\nfinished but I find that more often than\nnot I'm just hearing about\nsuch a lack of flexibility and such a\nlack of emotional regulation when I'm\nhearing about people's stories and\nlearning about them and how people talk\nto each other how people deal with\nproblems\nand I find of course\nwhere do obviously all of them in\ntalking to you from a therapy\nperspective a lot of that's coming from\nchildhood a lot of that's coming from\npersonal trauma it's very hard to make\nsense of that when you first meet\nsomeone and you're dating someone you're\nalmost meeting the you are meeting the\nbest version of them uh because it's the\none they're portraying or the one that\nthey want you to see and then naturally\nyou spend longer with someone you see\nthem stressed you see them angry you see\nthem upset you start seeing all of this\nother 360. I guess the question is how\ndo we allow for the fact that we're less\nlikely to meet someone who is the\nfinished product\nbut at the same time give ourselves\nenough time to not feel too deep or fall\ntoo hard yeah I think about that saying\nin the first three months of a\nrelationship you're not you you're the\nambassador of you so it's very hard to\nknow and everybody's on their best\nbehavior\num but I think that people you know\nyou're still having a lot of deep\ndiscussions in those first three months\nbecause you feel this incredible\nvulnerability and intimacy and people\nwill tell you a lot of things that maybe\nyou don't want to hear so they are these\nred flags and you kind of block them out\nyou think oh well that's okay or I'm not\ngoing to pay attention to that you\nproject onto them who you want them to\nbe as opposed to who they actually are\nand I think that what you said about we\ngrow in relationship is so true I think\nthat people grow so much more in couples\ntherapy than they might even in\nindividual therapy because you are\nforced to contend with another person\nthat you're coming up against\nand I I really feel like hey you have to\nlisten to those to those everything that\nthey tell you the good the kind of\nquestionable all of it and just say what\ndoes that mean and you can even think\nabout well let me get more information\nabout that what did they mean when they\nsaid oh they don't really want kids like\nlike what does that mean does that mean\nnow does that mean ever what does that\nmean you have to listen to these things\num you know what does that mean where\nthey're they talk really really uh you\nknow in with a lot of aggressive\nlanguage about a parent for example\nthat means that yes maybe that parent\nreally disappointed them and maybe there\nwas a lot of trauma but how have a sort\nof processed that and where are they\nwith processing that because if that's\nstill so raw to them that will come out\nin your relationship with them you might\nnot think they're gonna that's gonna\ncome out toward you but it will\nright we marry our unfinished business\nso I think you really have to look out\nfor that so no you're not looking for\nlike a person who has all the answers I\ndon't think anybody ever has all the\nanswers but you're looking for\nwillingness to show up willingness to\ntake responsibility willingness to\napologize\nthat's huge and also willingness to to\nbring things up so and and are you\nwilling to hear what the other person\nhas to say so a lot of times when I'm\nseeing a couple and someone will say you\nknow oh this person never brings things\nup I'm less interested in the fact that\nthey don't bring it up and I'm more\ninterested in why what are you afraid of\nwhy can't you talk to your partner and\nthey might say when I have brought\nthings up my partner tries to talk me\nout of the way that I feel when I try to\nbring things up my partner tries to tell\nme I'm wrong when I try to bring things\nup my partner shuts down when I try to\nbring things up my partner yells\nI'm when I try to bring things up my\npartner acts like they don't like me\nanymore\nright so then they say okay I'm not\ngoing to bring things up\nso then we need to talk about well this\nis a dance the two of you are doing it's\nnot just that this person is avoidant\nit's that you are inviting the avoidance\nso no one's to blame here it's just that\nyou guys are doing a dance and you both\nhave to change your dance steps if you\nwant to change the dynamic in the\nrelationship I think a lot of our\ninflexibility leads to this binary\nthinking of oh my gosh if they've got\nissues with their parents then I can't\nbe with them or if they've got this I\ncan't be with them and I think or if\nthey're like this then I should be with\nthem and I almost feel like there's that\nmiddle ground of just no I just these\nare things I need to be aware of and\nthen I can still be in a relationship or\nchoose not to but I I feel like there's\na lot of binary decision making based on\nsmall data points yes because we're so\nscared by our own Trigger or by our own\npain that comes from that that we can\neasily write something off that may just\nneed a little more work yeah I I don't\nknow if that if you agree you can\ndisagree completely that's just I'm just\nsharing what my thoughts are at least oh\nyeah I agree a great example of that is\nI I was seeing a couple and he had a lot\nof issues with authority because his\nfather really kind of misused Authority\nas he was growing up so that's a big\ntrigger for him and he's really working\non it so if he wasn't working on it that\nwould be different but he's really\nworking on it but sometimes things\nhappen and so his partner had this\nbeautiful we came up with in couples\ntherapy a beautiful way for her you know\nwhen you can see the child childhood\nwounds and you can help your they're\nworking on it so you're not solving it\nfor them but you can support them in\nsome way so if she saw him out in public\nmaybe getting triggered by something it\nwouldn't happen often if it happened a\nlot that would be a problem she would\njust put her hand on his arm like that\nand it just calmed his nervous system\nand it brought him to the present with\nsuch a beautiful thing that she could do\nfor him and she had stuff from childhood\nand he knew oh I can see the little girl\nin her right now I have so much\ncompassion instead of getting frustrated\nby it so much compassion for the little\ngirl I know this about her and here's\nwhat I can do for her in that moment\nthese shorthands these little things\nthat you can do to kind of help someone\ninstead of going from zero to sixty just\ngo from like zero to five and then be\nlike oh and I can come back down we\nthink we can see where our partners\ntriggers are and what their weaknesses\nare especially if you get to know them\nbetter and you start to think oh yeah I\nknow that his mum talks to him like that\nand so that's why he's talking to me\nlike that because he's taking that\nstress out on me that's useful but often\nwe don't look at that as context and\ncompassion and empathy we look at that\nas how does he not get it yes or how did\nthey not get it that that's where it\ncomes from and we almost want our\npartner to like learn the lesson or it's\nso obvious how can you not see it and\nhere you are talking about like a gentle\ntouch in the arm that helps someone calm\ntheir trigger how do you help each other\nunderstand your triggers in a way that\ndoesn't trigger you because I feel like\nit's such a sensitive conversation to\nhave and because we some people are self\nunaware and some are self-aware or\nyou're seeing things in others but you\ncan't see in yourself how do you have\nhealthier conversations around\nhey do you know why we're behaving this\nway do you know why we're talking like\nthis yeah we just had a beautiful\nepisode on the podcast so on our podcast\nuh dear therapist we have we bring\npeople on for our actual sessions and\nthen we give them homework to do and\nthen they tell us how it went to the end\nof the session we had this young couple\non and her trigger was weight that she\nwanted to she was trying to set a\nboundary but it was a very difficult\nboundary it was you know sometimes we\nthink about boundaries as I'm going to\nmake this request and you're going to do\nit and if you don't do it then you have\nbroken my boundary that's not how\nboundaries work okay boundaries are\nabout and I think this is a really\nimportant Point related to this which is\nthat when you set a boundary you're\ndeciding for yourself what you will do\nnot what the other person will do so you\ncan say to the other person in her case\nI don't like it when you talk about\nweight because that's a big trigger for\nme growing up that was something that\nwas always talked about I don't want to\ntalk about dieting I don't want to talk\nabout people's weight or people's\nappearances that really bothers me but\nit got to the point where he couldn't\nsay anything about you know like it was\nit was too restrictive of a boundary and\nso they would argue about this because\nthen you're just like I'm just not going\nto say anything because I never know\nwhat's going to trigger you her boundary\ncould have been\nI'm going to ask him not to say a\nreasonable number of things about weight\nbut there are certain things that he\nmight say and I'm going to have to maybe\nleave the room or I'm going to\nself-regulate or I'm going to have a\nmantra for myself that's what I'm going\nto do they would argue about this and\nwhat would happen is she would um you\nknow we had to get to sort of what was\nunderneath this and she finally\ndiscovered it's like I need more\naffirmation I need more like just flirt\nwith me during the day or you know and\nhe said I need that too and so we gave\nthem this homework assignment where they\njust had to do one very subtle\nflirtation\num you know just once a day and she left\na little note on the bathroom mirror and\nhe said oh my God that made me feel so\nthe whole day I was so excited it is\nthese tiny things and so then she was\nless triggered when like food would come\nup because he was so much about like you\nlook beautiful and she said you always\nsay when I get my eyebrows done you're\nlike dang and she's like why won't you\ndo that with other things I don't want\nto have to get my eyebrows done right\nand he was like oh my God I think you're\nso beautiful I should be saying that\nmore yeah so it just it's just realizing\nyou know what is the trigger really\nabout and then how can you as a partner\nsupport that yeah and I just want to\nre-emphasize that point if anyone missed\nit it's like\nboundaries are not to control other\npeople's actions towards you there to\ncontrol your own actions based on what\nothers do to you right and the important\npart about boundaries is maintenance by\nthe way so it's not just one time it's\nlet's say that you say to someone you\nknow if you\num if you yell at me if you raise your\nvoice I'm going to end the conversation\nwe had this on the podcast with someone\nelse the father was kept talking to his\ndaughter about when are you going to get\nmarried when are you and your boyfriend\ngoing to get married and she said to him\nif you bring that up I'm gonna end the\nconversation I'm Gonna Leave the Room\nbecause I want to have fun with you when\nI'm with you and this just makes it\nreally stressful and so every time it\nhad to be in every time he mentions that\nyou say Dad just reminder\nwe'll talk another time and if you don't\ndo that if you don't do it consistently\nlike let's say that you do it 10 times\nbut then one time you like let that\nconversation continue the person thinks\noh I can still talk about this because\nthey're not going to leave the room\nthey're not going to end the\nconversation so again it's what you do\nyou have to hold the boundary every\nsingle time for yourself and the other\nperson is going to realize at a certain\npoint if I want to be in that person's\npresence I can't bring this up because\nevery single time they're going to leave\nand I think that's the mistake we make\nwe break our own boundaries yes in order\nto show our care or to be seen as a good\nperson or whatever it may be but that\nends up setting us up for more failure\nbecause now that person thinks they can\ncross the boundary as well because we're\ndoing it anyway yes yes boundaries are\njust such a fascinating thing because I\nfind them so useful in so many areas of\nmy life but I think you just hit the\nnail on the head that it's our own\nletting our guard down about our own\nboundaries that actually allows people\nto think they can break them anyway it's\nnot about them breaking them down like\nif you stay pretty strong on that I mean\nif I mean people can still do what they\nwant but at least you'll know where you\nstand with them I remember a small\nexample of what you just said I remember\nwhenever I'd go back to London because\nI'd like to see my family there there'd\nbe certain members of my family who'd\nalways say to me oh you're only back for\n30 days and then I see them the week\noften they'd be like oh you're only got\n21 days left and I just be like guys I'm\nback for 30 days like you know and I had\nto draw a boundary around just and it\nsounds so small and silly but it isn't\nbecause I didn't like hearing that\nbecause I was like let's just be really\ngrateful for this present moment like\nlet's have the best time we're together\nright now and I don't want to sit here\nand think about how many days I have\nleft again it can be so small but it can\nbe so important to you but I have to\nhonor that okay if you bring up time\nagain then XYZ is going to happen or\nwhatever it may be yeah and the other\nthing about boundaries is that people\nthink that boundaries separate you the\npoint of the boundary is to bring you\ncloser it's I can be in relate I want to\nbe in relationship with you but we need\nto have these boundaries I remember\nsomebody wrote Into the column a parent\nwrote in and said my daughter has all\nthese boundaries about how many times I\ncall her during the day and she said you\nknow I want I'm setting a boundary and\nhe wrote in and said I don't want to\nhave a boundary relationship and I wrote\nback and I said every relationship is a\nboundary relationship you can't just do\nwhatever you want in a relationship all\nrelationships have boundaries it's like\nit's kind of like the difference between\nbeing in an ocean with No Boundaries or\nbeing in a fishbowl where the boundaries\nare too tight and people can't live you\nwant to be in an aquarium in\nrelationship right so there's enough\nroom for each person to kind of have\ntheir space\nbut it's not so constrained that like\neverybody's walking on eggshells and\nit's not so open like an ocean where\nthere's you can just do whatever you\nwant yeah well said I like that analogy\nand and I I think that the the important\nthing about the boundary is when you set\nthe boundary it's saying I want to be\ncloser to you I want to be in\nrelationship with you but if you keep\ndoing that it's going to push me away so\nplease don't mention this right don't\ncriticize me don't talk about whether\nI'm married because that's going to make\nme go farther away I want to be close to\nyou and actually there is a sign of\ncloseness because if someone actually\nlearns about your boundaries they\nactually are learning about some of the\nmost intimate yes details about you\nbecause if you're saying this triggers\nme or this makes me feel upset or this\nreally gets to me you're actually\ndisplaying vulnerably something that's\nso significant and meaningful to you and\nso it should bring you closer to someone\nelse it's like that person actually\nvalue season respects you so much to\nactually open up and share with you a\nweakness or a pain Point yeah I saw some\nfriends on the podcast we were doing and\nthey came together and they were saying\nlike I set some boundaries and the other\nperson thinks that I don't want to be\nfriends and no what you're saying is I\nwant this friend they'd been friends\nsince childhood and things changed\nthings evolve As you move into adulthood\nand you move into family life and your\ndifferent stages of Life whatever they\nmight be and this person was like I am\ndoing this because I want to our\nfriendship matters to me it's important\nand once the other friend heard that the\nboundaries were fine\nit was that this person thought oh\nyou're trying to dump me and she's\nsaying no I'm doing the opposite I'm\ntrying to keep our friendship alive yeah\nand I think that's part of the\ncommunication I feel like there's a need\nfor whoever you are if you're the person\nin the relationship that's almost to\nsome degree guiding this conversation\nit's important for you to clarify why\nyou're setting the boundary I think\noften we just say this is what I want to\ndo and we kind of announce it and it's\nmore of an announcement than it is a\nsetting of a boundary and it's so much\nmore powerful when someone says to you\nhey I actually really value our\nrelationship and I think this is going\nto bring us closer and that's why I'm\nactually being really vulnerable with\nyou and I'm sharing with you this is how\nI feel when you do this it'll mean the\nworld to me if if we were able to shift\nthis or this is how I'm probably going\nto behave if this happens but that kind\nof casing that sometimes our\ncommunication needs to be in it it\ndemands a lot of us and I I get this\nfeedback from a lot of people when we're\ntalking to them on the podcast and\nthrough my books and everything is that\npeople feel like they're often the one\ncarrying the torch to help\nthis maturity develop in a relationship\nand a lot of people are quite exhausted\nby it they're like well gosh I'm like\ntrying to help us set boundaries I'm the\none like setting agreements I'm the one\nwho's like encouraging us to be positive\nand it can get really exhausting\ncarrying the torch\nhow what do you say to people who feel\nthat way right now but they're like you\nknow what Laurie I'm trying to be\ncurious with my partner I'm trying to do\nthis um with my friends I'm like the one\nsetting up this but like I'm exhausted\nnow and so I I don't know how long I can\ndo it for and I just want them to step\nup\nso often what what we'll see is if that\nperson will come to couples therapy\nwe'll find out either the person doesn't\nwant to step up and you keep asking them\nto do something they are not interested\nin doing\nand so that just you know so so the\nquestion I would ask the person who's\nfeels like they're holding the burden of\nit all is why are you trying so hard why\nare you in this\nyou know like what what is how is this\nserving you because this is so hard\nyou're not happy why are you why do you\nremain why are you trying to get this\nperson to do something why don't you\nfind someone who is willing and\ninterested in the kinds of things that\nyou're interested in in a relationship\nand so then there's some usually some\nold stuff there about you know what we\ncall repetition compulsion which is\ntrying to you find someone who is\nunwilling to give you what you need or\nwant which is maybe some old stuff and\nthen you uh then you think like I'm\ngonna do it with this person because\nthis time I'll win this time I can make\nit happen I couldn't make it happen when\nI was a child but this time I'll win\nexcept you won't win it doesn't happen\nthat way the way you win is you let go\nof that you grieve what you didn't get\nand then you go find it in someone\nwithout trying to change them\nso you're not trying to win anything\nit's already there but another reason\nanother thing that might happen is this\ncouple comes to couples therapy and the\nperson says I'm not showing up because\nthe other person's so controlling this\nperson has tried to control everything\nthey're trying to set every role they're\ntrying to manage every aspect of our\nlives and there's no room for me and my\nthoughts and how I want things to go and\nwhen I say I want this they say no\nyou're wrong no it can't be that way\nit's my way this is the way this is I'm\nthe healthy person you're the not\nhealthy person\nand that doesn't feel good either yeah\nit requires so much self-excavation to\njust see whether we're being that person\nor we can often so get lost in our\nholier than thou and like kind of this\nfeeling of like oh I'm so emotionally\nmature and I'm so self-aware and I'm\ndoing the work and I know the language\nand all of a sudden\nactually we're\nwe're being so Evangelical that the\nperson that we're speaking to is kind of\nfeeling like they have no say or no\nimpact or no involvement\none of the scenarios that came up in\nthis conversation while we were\npreparing for this podcast was\nthis coupled there\nthe woman earns more than the man\nand\nshe doesn't have an issue with it she's\nvery comfortable with it she didn't care\nshe wasn't she that wasn't a big\npriority for it wasn't a deal breaker\nfor her but it's really triggering to\nhim and he's uncomfortable with that and\nso if the topic of money comes up or\nbudgeting comes up he often tries to\nyeah he gets very uncomfortable about it\nit can it can make him can make him\nangry it can make him upset\nshe's trying to figure out\nhow does she help him become more\nconfident and comfortable and happy\nabout who he is and not feel this\npressure that he feels potentially\ncoming from his family or his upbringing\nas well yeah this would be a great thing\nfor them to talk about in couples\ntherapy and really get it sort of what\ndoes money represent to them does it\nrepresent self-esteem acceptance love\npower lack of power money represents so\nmany things I think people when they\ntalk about money if they talk about\nmoney in their relationships it's such a\nsensitive topic they tend to talk about\nit in on the content level like let's\nmake a budget or why why did you spend\nmoney on that right and they're not\nreally talking about how do we both feel\nabout money what was money like in our\nhouseholds when we grew up what were the\nmessages that we got around money some\npeople got really mixed messages you\nknow money is good money is bad we have\nmoney we don't have money\num value judgments it's it's okay to\nspend money on this but not on this\nand so you bring all of that into your\nrelationship and then the gender roles\nof course right so what does that\nrepresent what kind of family did you\ngrow up in in terms of how they thought\nabout gender and power and money and how\nthat changes with culture with the kind\nof maybe egalitarian marriage that you\nwant those are all conversations they\nneed to have yeah not about let's sit\ndown and make a budget but about all the\nquestions that I was just bringing up\nthose are such great questions and and I\nknow that for that they work because me\nand my wife have sat down and looked at\nthat through our marriage and we've\nwe've had so many questions about that\nbecause we both came from very different\nFinancial setups and uh relationship\nwith money was very very different I\nstarted working very very young my wife\nstarted working while she was at college\nand after and just as time grew in our\nlifestyle changes and things changed\nthere were so many conversations we had\nto always reset as well it wasn't just\nlike oh we've solved it now we don't\ntalk about money anymore and it's we've\nhad to almost re-evaluate and re rethink\nthat topic so many times depending on\nhow many changes there are but I find\nthat those are the questions that I find\npeople avoiding or when they do talk\nabout it it's always a full-blown\nargument so it's like you said it's\neither about budgeting if they talk\nabout it in a healthy way or like at\nleast a practical way is probably a\nbetter word or we don't talk about it\nbecause you're like so scared to mention\nit because when you do it turns into a\nfull-blown argument and now we're\narguing about not even money we're\narguing about something else I want to\nhelp people have the tools to\nstart difficult conversations\nwith people in their life it could be of\nMom it could be a dad it could be you\nknow I feel like all of us avoid we\navoid discomfort in our lives and\nuncomfortable conversations are one of\nthe biggest ones whether it's when\nyou're firing someone when you're giving\nfeedback to someone when you're trying\nto be direct with someone these are such\nchallenging things to do how do we sit\nin the discomfort\nor how do we prepare for uncomfortable\nconversations\nto help them go better first of all I\nthink that people are worried that\nsomehow they're being unkind by bringing\nsomething up that's uncomfortable the\nkindest thing you can do is to have a\nconversation with somebody that is real\nand genuine and authentic I think that\nthe first the way you start that is you\nstart it with yourself so before you\neven get to the other person you want to\nbe able to say to them to say to\nyourself I'm being really kind and I'm\nremembering their humanity and I'm going\nto have this conversation in an open\ngenerous curious way so I'm not here to\nset my agenda necessarily I'm here to be\ncurious about their experience so we\ntogether can come to some kind of\nunderstanding about each other that we\ndidn't have before and I think that's\nthe framework that you come into any\nhard conversation with yeah and and it's\nalmost like it again comes back down to\nwhat we're discussing it today is like\nframing a conversation I think we get so\nlost and like what are we trying to\nsolve yeah and we're trying to be very\nlogical and actually it's like well no\nframing the conversation in the emotion\nof understanding how people feel about\nthings and where it comes from and what\nthis could lead to is so much more\nimportant than actually solving the\nproblem right and knowing that this is\ngoing to be a dialogue not a monologue I\nthink that we're like I have something\nimportant to say and you're gonna\ndeliver whatever you're going to deliver\nto them it's not a monologue it's not\nI'm coming to deliver something it's I'm\ncoming to bring up a topic and I want to\nhear where the other person is coming\nfrom and you might want to ask them\nfirst like hey I know that money has\nbeen kind of stressful for us can we\ntalk a little bit about it I'm curious\nto hear more about what money is what it\nmeans to you what it was like growing up\nI want to share that with you about what\nit means to me what it was like for me\ngrowing up and you could have a really\nbeautiful conversation the other thing\nis if it's a Roman romantic relationship\nhold hands it's really hard to argue it\nactually calms your nervous systems just\nhold hands as you're having the\nconversation it's so lovely\nit opens people up to be more vulnerable\nyeah no I love this advice and I really\nhope everyone is listening and watching\nyour gonna try and practice some of\nthese they're they're so subtle and\nthere's such small insights but they\nmake such a big difference because\nit could be a game changer when you\napproach the same conversation in a\ncompletely different way and it can\ntransform the trajectory of your\nrelationship with an individual because\nthey have so much more respect for how\nyou handled it too and we just we just\ndid a podcast episode with a mother and\ndaughter they've been having the same\nfight for 25 years wow and they came on\nthe podcast and they said we have never\ntalked about it this way and it's not\nbecause we did something you know like\nunheard of it was just because they had\nnever been taught to talk about they've\nbeen having literally the same\nconversation or lack of conversation\nwhen you know one person would shut the\nother person out usually the daughter\nshutting the mother out and they just\nnever talked about it in this other way\nand I think so many people think oh we\nhave a problem and it's not fixable\nmany problems are so fixable you can\nheal a lot of things maybe not in\nexactly the way you want but certainly\nto have more of a relationship than you\nwere ever than you ever thought possible\num\nall right I've got so many more for you\nI hope you're having fun Lorien sure\nyeah I love talking about all this stuff\nyeah it's so it's so fascinating to just\ndive into you know these real scenarios\nthat all of you have sent in and I want\nto give a big thank you to everyone who\non Instagram sent me all of these\nincredible notes for this episode\nthere's a few more here that I really\nwant to get to so\nokay this this one's a good one because\nit kind of relates to something we\ndiscussed earlier but it's it's a more\nspecific question on\nwhen in your mind do you know when\nyou're settling or you're not settling\nhow do you know\num I think if you're asking yourself\nthat question that's that's a really\nimportant\nsign\num but I I think you need to get clear\nis is this something culturally like the\nculture has told me that I need to be\nwith someone like this\num and whether that's like the greater\nculture or your specific culture that\nyou grew up in or your family culture\nwhose voice is it I think that's really\nimportant that as adults sometimes we\ncan't tease out our own voice from the\nvoices of people who raised us or the\nculture even\nso I think that's an important question\nI also think the the question is\num are they you know when we think about\nwhat compromises we have to make with\nanother person we don't tend to think\nabout what compromises somebody has to\nmake to be with us which is a really\nimportant point it's not like it's not\nlike you know I think people treat\ndating like shopping like I want this\nI'm gonna go find this and it's not like\nthe clothes when you're shopping gonna\nbe like I don't think you're going to\nlook good in that or I'd rather be with\nsomeone who looks differently like the\nclothes are not judging you right but\nthe thing is like when you're going into\na relationship with going back to the\nyou know we can't order a people a la\ncarte they can't order up you a la carte\neither and we have this weird notion in\nour culture that like love is loving all\nthe annoying things about me too no\npeople are not gonna they're going to\nlove you even though you have these\nannoying things but that doesn't mean\nthey're gonna love the annoying things\nof course not so we have this weird idea\nthat this unkind additional love\nand it's just they they misuse that term\nso I think we have to remember that as\nwe are thinking about this whole human\nbeing this person is choosing us with\nall of our annoying things our quirks\nare maybe our past that we haven't\nreally worked through that we're still\nworking through and you know we have\nthis idea that you know I'm shopping for\nsomeone you're not shopping for someone\nit's how do I feel with this person that\nis the most important question you can\nask how do I feel when I'm with this\nperson\nand if you feel you enjoy their company\nyou feel heard you feel understood you\nfeel safe you you\num you're having fun you're not settling\nall the rest is just noise yeah yeah I\nreally like those\ntwo really powerful points I think so\nmany of our definitions of the perfect\npartner settling\nyou know whatever it may be comes from a\nsocietal parental impact yeah and so\nwhat do my friends think of him or what\nhow would they react oh no they're gonna\nknow I'm settling and it's like well no\nwas that your definition of what a good\npartner was and the second point that\nyou mentioned that I love because I do\nit all the time whenever I'm sitting\nthere in my head and I'm thinking God\nI've made so many sacrifices for my wife\nI've done this or that I come up with a\nlist of hers in my head and I'm like oh\nshe's made so many like it's such a\ngreat activity to do that when I think\nabout I often ask people to zoom out\nand say you may think like maybe\nsomeone's sitting there going I do\neverything financially for a\nrelationship or I do everything uh\nphysically for this relationship like I\nget the groceries I do the house\ncleaning whatever it may be I always ask\npeople to zoom out and go look at your\nlife physically financially mentally\nemotionally and spiritually okay if\nyou're making all the sacrifices across\nall five of those there's something\nreally important to look at but more\noften than not when people zoom out they\ngo oh actually you're right like I pick\nup the slack here and they pick up the\nslack there and there's a bit of give\nand take yeah and and I would say also\none exercise to do is describe the\nrelationship from their perspective yeah\nright like what are they putting up with\nreally if they were to if they were to\nreally talk about you know the\nrelationship from their perspective\nthere would be all these great things\nand there would be all the sacrifices\nthey're making too and sometimes we\nforget about that absolutely all right I\nlike this one uh\nso there's this person who was let go\nfrom their job and decided\nthat she may want to get into comedy\nbecause she always had a dream of being\na comedian but doesn't want to feel like\nshe is taking a step back into the\nservice industry in order to pursue her\ngoals that may be very far to reach she\nhas some trouble with structure and\nfacing the unknown of it all how do you\nsuggest she structures herself and gives\nherself tangible benchmarks I think that\npeople make this binary I'm either going\nto pursue my dream and give up\neverything else or I'm not going to\npursue my dream and I always say to\npeople you can have two things going at\nonce it's a lot safer to say I'm gonna\ntry comedy and I'm going to put\neverything I have into it but I'm also\nnot going to maybe leave my job yet and\nso I can see whether this really works\nfor me or not before I give up this\nother thing so it doesn't have to be so\nbinary yeah I I agree with that I think\nthat I think too often we make that move\ntoo quick yeah if someone comes up to\nand goes yeah just listen to your\npodcast and decided to make this big\nfish I'm like oh I don't think I said\nthat like please don't do that like you\nknow that's that's definitely not what\nI'm encouraging if anything I'm\nencouraging this\njourney of learning about something you\nlove first experimenting maybe interning\napprenticeships shadowing watch how the\njob's actually done like I'm so much\nmore into an incremental yes approach to\nchange as opposed to thinking that this\nbig all-in approach is going to suddenly\ndeliver some miraculous reward if\nanything if you go slower you'll learn\nmore and then when you do make the big\njump it will actually more likely be\nmore successful that's right and I think\nthe other question to ask is am I moving\ntowards something or am I trying to\nescape from something because sometimes\npeople will just jump into something\nvery impulsively because they want to\nget out of their situation and they\ndon't do well with uncertainty because\nmost people don't so they want an answer\nso they feel like I can't just leave\nthis other thing that I know is making\nme unhappy I don't want to be a lawyer\nanymore I don't want to do this job\nanymore but I don't know what else to do\nso I'm gonna do this other thing but\nyou're not even sure you want to do the\nother thing yet so are you are you\nescaping or are you moving toward yeah\ndefinitely and I think when we try to\nescape too soon yes without thinking it\nthrough yeah and that's that's actually\none of the biggest things that I've I've\nactually been talking about is a lot\nlately in it because I think it's\nimpacted me so much in my life and I was\nit's almost like if you don't like where\nyou are\nif you can figure out a way to learn\nfrom it\nand when I say learn from it I don't\nmean some magical life lesson I mean\nlike thinking about what are the\npractical lessons I could learn here\nwhat are the things I can get curious\nabout sure I don't like the setup I\ndon't like my manager but maybe there's\nsomething here that's actually going to\nbenefit me in the future all of a sudden\nI'm not saying that becomes the best job\nyou've ever had but it doesn't feel as\npainful while you build the next step\nyes whereas this desire to just rush out\nof pain or again pain is maybe a strong\nword but rush out of\na place that you want to escape from you\nactually might fall into the same thing\nagain in another way which we again do\nin relationships as well we do that all\nthe time somebody is like I'm Gonna\nLeave This relationship and then oh but\nI fell in love with this other person\nmaybe you do need to leave that\nrelationship but why don't you take a\nbeat why don't you see are you just\ngoing to another person you're going to\nrepeat all the same things in this other\nrelationship or do you want to\nunderstand more about do I understand\nwhat happened in this relationship why\nit didn't work and then now I can leave\nin a way that feels good or maybe I was\nwrong and maybe there actually was\nsomething great here but there was a\nproblem that I wasn't willing to face in\nthis relationship yeah I want to ask you\nthis question because obviously we're\ntalking today about your beautiful new\nJournal that assists maybe you should\ntalk to someone which is the book that I\ninterviewed you about a couple of years\nago which is such a phenomenal book it's\nhelped so many people how and why is\njournaling valuable to everything we're\ndiscussing today I think there one of\nthe things that happens when you Journal\nis you go into this space that you don't\ngo into when you're not writing it down\nwhen you actually can see something it's\nvery different from thinking it our\nthoughts are fleeting they just move\naround they're very disorganized and the\nthing about journaling is no one's\njudging it no one's seeing it it's just\nfor you you know I used to think it's\nfunny because I put out this journal but\nI used to not want to journal because I\nwould think oh it's a chore and I'm\ngonna have to sit down and it's going to\nhave what if you know I don't know what\nto say or I don't really have anything\nto say and what the the way that I've\nstructured this journal is there's a\nprompt that comes from maybe you should\ntalk to someone just to give you a\nlittle bit of structure but it follows\nyou through the 52 weeks of the year\nlike a therapy session and we always say\nthat the work of most of the work of\ntherapy happens outside the therapy room\nso people think I'm going to come to\ntherapy I'm going to have all these\ninsights and that's my therapy no you're\ngonna if you don't use what you learn in\ntherapy and you don't put it into action\nduring the week then the Insight is\nuseless so someone might say oh I got\ninto that fight with my partner again\nand now I understand why and I'll say\nwell that's great but did you do\nsomething different well no but okay\nwell good first step understanding why\nbut now you need to do something\ndifferent so when you reflect every day\nduring the week then you say what am I\ndoing with this bit of insight so the\nprompt will maybe Inspire some kind of\ninsight into your life and then what how\ndo you noodle that around during the\nweek and you can watch your progression\nbecause you've written it down and what\nI love about the doing a journal for a\nyear is that you can look like three\nmonths ago I thought this but look how\nI'm handling this situation now and it\njust takes five minutes A lot of people\nwill wake up in the morning and journal\njust to clear their minds many of us\nwill wake up and the first thing we do\nis we look at our phones and already\nwe're stressed and already we're\nthinking about oh I didn't do this or\nI'm behind already it's not a good way\nto start your day I love taking five\nminutes in the morning to just write\ndown so that then it's out there and I\ndon't have to sit with it all day long a\nlot of people also will do it right\nbefore bed because you know how\nsometimes we'll just think all these\nthoughts before bed and it keeps you up\nat night and you can't sleep you Journal\nbefore bed and now you feel like oh I'm\nreally I'm all cleared out I feel good\nso I think that journaling is really\nvaluable and I think it reminds me of\nsomething that we often say in\nrelationships that it's easy to notice\nthe person who gets angry in a\nrelationship and harder to notice the\nperson who Smiles all the time\nso when people say like oh my partner's\nangry all the time and it's like well\nbecause you're ignoring that person's\nholding the anger for both of you if you\nJournal you might notice if you're the\nperson who Smiles all the time that\nmaybe you have some anger to or maybe\nyou have trouble bringing something up\nand if you're a really avoidant person\nlike the person who does smile all the\ntime it's a good thing to put it down in\na journal because then you say oh wait\nthere are things that I want to bring up\nand let me figure out what to do with\nthem or if you're the person who's angry\nand is holding the anger for both of you\nyou might start to notice through\njournaling I'm not it's not my job why\nam I angry all the time this person is\nnot willing to have any of these\nconversations this person's stonewalling\nme so you discover a lot about yourself\nand your patterns when you have this\nspace that's you can be vulnerable in\nthat no one's judging to add to that one\nof the things that I think that's so\nspecial about journaling is that\nit's so much easier to measure physical\nchange so if you're trying to put on\nweight lose weight if you're trying to\nbuild muscle you know whatever it may be\nyou can measure that and there's a\nnumber to it and I found that for me\njournaling's always been a great way of\nlooking back a week ago a month ago a\nyear ago and going what was I thinking\nabout then where was I in my headspace\nwhat was I worried about and often I\nfound when I've gone and done that you\ncan actually see growth yes in the same\nway as having like a marker and if\nyou're not journaling every day you kind\nof don't know whether you're moving\nforward or backward because you don't\nhave something to think about you just\nhave your feeling in the moment whereas\nwhen you look back and you think wow\nfive years ago\nI can't leave I used to worry about that\nexam or that interview or that whatever\nit may have been and now I'm like I\nwouldn't be worried about that at all\nthings have changed yeah so to me it's a\ngreat way of monitoring and measuring\ngrowth yeah and I think that change is\nreally hard this is why New Year's\nresolutions tend not to work out for\npeople a lot of the time and you can see\nwhen you Journal I talk in the book\nmaybe you should talk to someone about\nthe stages of change and you can see\nthem happen so pre-contemplation is you\ndon't even know that you're thinking\nabout making a change so that's when\nyou're kind of in denial in your Journal\nlike oh no this isn't really happening\nand you see yourself kind of justify or\nrationalize things that you know just\nare not right and then contemplation is\nyou know you need to make a change but\nyou're not ready yet so now you're\ngetting more real with yourself that's\nusually when people come to therapy at\nthe contemplation but you can see it in\nthe journal oh now I'm really getting\nout of denial and then there's\npreparation where you're sort of saying\nhow do I prepare to make this change\nwhat's steps do I need to take whether I\nwant to leave this relationship or I\nwant to get into a relationship and put\nmyself out there more or I want to you\nknow I want to go after some dream or I\nwant to set a boundary so how am I\npreparing for this and then action is\nwhen you actually make the change but\nthat's not the last step the last step\nis maintenance and that's the most\nimportant change and that doesn't mean I\nhave to maintain the change and be\nperfect it means that I'm going to slip\nback like in Shoots and Ladders right so\nit's like yes I will there will be oh I\nI broke up with that person but no I\ncalled them I didn't mean to call them\nthat doesn't mean you failed that just\nmeans you're human and so how can you\nshow yourself and you can do this in\nyour Journal how can you write something\nto yourself that's very compassionate\nbut also holding yourself accountable so\nand how you can look in your Journal\nabout how do I talk to myself you know\ndo I do I beat myself up all the time am\nI a bullied to myself or can I be\ncompassionate with myself be because\nthat will actually help me to be\naccountable I can be more accountable\nwhen I'm kind to myself so that doesn't\nmean oh it's fine that you called him\nyou just get back in the relationship\nwith him it means oh you were feeling\nsad or you were feeling lonely and you\ncalled him because you were lonely but\nmaybe next time I'll call a friend maybe\nnext time I'll take a walk maybe next\ntime I will go to this meeting you know\nwhatever you need to do and then you're\nreally being compassionate and you have\nin your Journal kind of this this friend\nthat's really kind to yourself that\nknows you really well and that knows\nwhat you need to do and it's right there\non the page\nsuch a great note about\nyour general letting you know how you\ntalk to yourself yes the language you\nuse with yourself and helping you change\nthat because when it's on the page you\ncan cross it out you can edit it you can\nwrite a new version when it's in your\nhead it just keeps repeating and you\nnever get that moment to\nto edit it or to filter it Laurie you've\nbeen so card with the time today I want\nto ask you one last thing and it's about\nwhat you just mentioned there and I\nthink it's breakups and it's you know I\nstill find till this day that breakups\nseem to be the hardest yes relationship\ntransition that people tend to go\nthrough\nmaybe apart from grief or maybe even\nsimilar and I'd love your thoughts on\nthat but because it is a kind of loss I\nthink that people feel there was one\nperson uh from the audience that we were\nconnected with that had a breakup and\nthey really they were together with this\nperson for two years they really thought\nthis is the person that they were going\nto spend their life with they really\nthought this was going in that direction\nthey felt that they actually had good\nlike compatibility they were good at\ntalking about things but then what felt\nlike out of the blue to this person they\njust felt that this person was like I\ndon't think this is going in that\ndirection anymore and then things\nwithered away quickly it's hard when you\nkind of you know and this is probably\nwhat you get all the time people don't\nfeel a sense of closure they don't\nreally understand the other person's not\ndoing a good job explaining it and\ndoesn't want to or doesn't have the time\nwhat are some of the steps that we need\nto take when we're kind of lost in that\nno person's land of I thought I had\nsomething it doesn't exist anymore so\nfirst of all loss is exactly it's grief\nand people go through the stages of\ngrief and the stages of grief are not\nsequential so they're they're actually\nmeant for people who are who are\nexperiencing terminal illness denial\nanger bargaining depression acceptance\num but they're very apt I think for for\nany kind of loss and when you talk about\na breakup there can be denial like oh\nyou don't really mean that we really are\ncompatible and you try to talk the other\nperson into maybe seeing the light that\nthey can't see you know the anger is how\ncould you have led me on for this amount\nof time you're you're such a terrible\nperson you wasted all my time you were\nlying to me this whole time when the\nperson wasn't they they probably truly\nyou know thought this was going\nsomewhere you know the bargaining is\nwell what if you know you know the\nperson tells you maybe why they're\nbreaking up with you like I don't think\nthat we're compatible in this way and\nthen you try to become the thing you\nknow like what if I did this or I can be\nmore this or we can do this and they're\nlike no that's not really the the way\nthis will get solved you know depression\nin which is just the whole I mean it's\nso because I think what people don't\nrealize is it's not what you're losing\njust in the moment it's you're losing\nthe future that you had imagined so you\nyou lose the past you lose like all the\nwhatever amount of time you spent with\nthat person you built a life with this\nperson and it's the dailyness there's an\nintimacy to that dailiness there's a\ncomfort there's a safety of this person\nknows all these little quirks about me\num you know we have all these inside\njokes we have a short hand\num you know this person asks how my day\nis I know you know it's it's the\ndailiness of being with someone so you\nlose that that's very lonely but then\nyou also lose the future you had built\nup a whole story about what your lives\nwere going to be like in a year five\nyears 10 years 20 years gone and you\nhave nothing to replace it with right\nnow because you don't know what it's\ngoing to look like yet so the grief is\nreal and I think people try to downplay\nit they're like why are you so sad about\nthis he was a jerk or she was a jerk or\nwhatever it's like I'm sad because I\nlost something very important to me\nand your friends need to realize that\ninstead of just demonizing the other\nperson they need to realize like you\nlost something really valuable in your\ndaily life in the present in the Future\nPart of your past all of that is gone\nnow so that's really hard I think the\nother part of of then dealing with the\ngrief is letting yourself feel it\nbecause it's real no matter what people\ntell you it's real\num and the other part is the story that\nyou're telling yourself about it is\nreally important so you might be telling\nyourself a story of the other person's\nterrible that might feel good in the\nmoment it might be something like I'm\nbad you know like I'm not good enough if\nI were only something else this person\nwould love me more or I'm not lovable or\nI'll never find anyone right those are\nnot helpful stories because it's not\ntrue it's you are not compatible with\nthis person for whatever reason even\nthough you thought you were if the other\nperson doesn't feel you're the right\nperson for them you're automatically\nincompatible right you can't you can't\nmake it so that well they just don't see\nit\nso we aren't compatible because the\nother person doesn't want to be with me\nso many times I'll hear you know someone\neven without a breakup like someone will\nbe dating someone and the person isn't\nreally invested in the relationship\nmaybe in the way that they would like\nthem too and the person sitting on my\ncouch will say but we're so compatible\nwe're so perfect for each other that\nperson just has intimacy issues and I\ncould just change them even if the\nbreakup was about you think the person\nhad intimacy issues it doesn't really\nmatter the point is they aren't able to\nbe with you so you are not compatible\nand so that is I think very comforting\nto know like we are just not compatible\neven though it hurts a lot we're not\ncompatible enough to sit with the pain\nof I need to know that we were not\ncompatible and that's not going to Jade\nme in other relationships\nand I think that's the important thing\nso many times we get into a new\nrelationship after that and we punish\nthe new person for something the old\nperson did yeah right like the old the\nold person wasn't truthful with me so\nI'm gonna like check your phone all the\ntime no don't don't like put someone in\njail for a crime they didn't commit\nso you gotta really like know what are\nthe wounds from this relationship what\nam I learning from this what does this\nteach me about me about the other person\nand then how do I move into a new\nrelationship with hope and with caution\nand hold holding both hope and caution\nfantastic Lori the reason why I love\ntalking to you about this is you're\ndoing this all the
