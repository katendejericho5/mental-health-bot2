    "transcript": "you talk to a person the day before\nthey're going to die they would give\nanything and everything for more chance\nat life the best-selling author and host\nthe number one Health and Wellness\npodcast on purpose with Jay Shetty\ncould you walk us through what it feels\nlike to think you're healthy to maybe\neven feel you're doing okay but in\nreality there's something going on\nbehind the scenes yeah I mean I think\nthere were two sort of things that were\na wake-up call for me and neither of\nthese things happen immediately I think\nit's just sometimes the realization that\nhappens immediately so the first one is\nI'd always been an athlete my whole life\ninsanely active potentially even you\nknow active to an unhealthy level and\nyou know the focus of that Obsession had\nalways shifted but at the point in the\nstory that we're talking about at this\npoint I was sort of a ultra distance\nswimmer so I was you know probably in\nthe Water Swimming 24 to 28 hours a week\nplus you know other types of training\nyet you know I found out this is\nprobably around 15 years ago that well\nactually on top of that I was sort of\ninsulin resistant I was overweight and\nagain not that I didn't know I was\noverweight you sort of you can realize\nthat but but that I was sort of insulin\nresistant and you know that's sort of\nthe first step up on the way towards\ntype 2 diabetes it was really at that\ntime that I also I think confronted my\nown family history so just within my\ngenes the acknowledgment that you know\nbasically every man in my family died\nprematurely of heart disease and in some\ncases very prematurely in their 40s\nthose two realizations in my mid-30s\nwhich also happened to coincide with the\nbirth of my daughter which my first\nchild was a real wake-up call and the\nrealization that you know I needed to\nfigure something out so that I didn't\njust you know March down the footsteps\nof what seemed to be my destiny and even\nthen you were in the medical profession\nright or yeah although I had actually\nleft medicine at this point so after 10\nyears of medical training including\nmedical school I became sort of\ndisillusioned with medicine and left so\nat the time that I'm having this\nrealization I'm actually in the world of\nfinance and quite far from medicine what\nwas your biggest fear at the time like\nif you could take yourself back to that\nmoment like what was the\nfear that you had yeah that I wouldn't\nbe around to you know be with my\ngrandkids and things of that nature\nbecause I think you know prior to my\ndaughter being born I didn't really\nthink I would be the kind of person that\nwould find any joy in having kids and\nthat changed in an instant the second\nshe was born I'm sure there are lots of\npeople who can relate to that probably\nmore so men than women I think because\nthe switch is a little more binary when\nwe have kids and then the thought of you\nknow I'm not going to relive this in 30\nyears with grandkids I think that was\nprobably the thing that was the most\nmotivating factor well yeah it it needs\nthat kind of incentive to get activated\nand the reason I asked that question is\neveryone who's listening or watching I\nwant you to think about what that fear\nwhat that challenge is for you because\noften fear isn't a great motivator to\nkeep going but it's a great place to\nstart and and our health almost starts\nthere sometimes like I remember that I\nremember feeling like Superman when I\nwas in my early 20s and then all of a\nsudden having certain health challenges\nI got into chronic fatigue I had polyps\nin my throat that had to be lasered out\nI lost my voice for a few months and\nthat wasn't life-threatening but it was\nlife-altering in the sense that I\ncouldn't communicate in the same way it\nwas different getting my voice back and\nnot feeling like it was as strong or\npowerful and then having gut issues and\ninflammation issues and acid issues and\nall of these things again like they\nweren't it's not that my life was going\nto end that year but it's like you start\nthinking long term and you start\nthinking about living a unhealthier\nharder life when is the right time for\npeople to consciously start actually\ninvesting in their health and I'm gonna\ncaveat that with what is generally\nhappening and happening in the different\nDecades of our life so what's happening\nbetween 0 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 30 to\n40 40 to 50 and when is the time when\nyou have a bit more control and ability\nto shift the trajectory of your health\nbar any of course major complications or\nsurprises I've never actually been asked\nit that way but the way you asked it\nkind of makes me think about different\nthings the aging process in some ways uh\nthere are some aspects of it that are\nmoving in the wrong direction the moment\nyou were born in other words the the\nmoment a fetus comes into this world\nthere are certain aspects of Aging that\nare only getting worse there are others\nthat are not so you have to imagine now\nthey were talking about different things\nso I'll give you an example of each\nsomething that's getting worse the\nsecond you're born is the damage to your\narteries so we call this process\natherosclerosis this is what leads to\nheart attacks and strokes heart attack\nand stroke is the leading cause of death\nin the United States for both men and\nwomen and globally for both men and\nwomen but it takes an awfully long time\nthat's why you've never heard of a baby\nhaving a heart attack that's why\nteenagers don't have heart attacks and\npeople in their 20s it's almost unheard\nof they would have a heart attack\nbut the disease is starting right away\nand we know this because when we've\nlooked at people who have died\nprematurely from other causes car\naccidents homicide suicide and you look\nat their coronary arteries you already\nsee evidence of disease so we know that\nthis is happening right away and it's\nsimply a matter of time until it reaches\na critical level that results in disease\nand of course everybody's accelerating\nat a different rate based on many\nfactors genetics smoking high blood\npressure metabolic Health all these\nother things but point being that's\nsomething for which you could\ntechnically argue it's never too soon to\nstart prevention then there are other\nthings in which we're actually getting\nbetter and better and better until we\nreach a certain point and then we start\nto demise and an example there might be\nsort of cognitive capacity so we might\nhave our greatest neuroplasticity in the\nfirst few years of life but we're also\nbuilding on that and if we're in the\nright environment we're exposed to the\nright things we're actually getting you\nknow better and better and better here\nat our fluid intelligence and that\nprobably reaches our Peak sometime in\nour third decade so that's something\nwhere you know you're actually getting\nbetter and better and better and then it\nslowly starts to decline and then there\nare all sorts of things that are\nmixtures of these things so for example\nyour physical capacity your muscle mass\nstrength power type 2 muscle fibers\ncardiorespiratory Fitness all of those\nthings are also increasing in capacity\nagain depending on which of those things\nwe're talking about if it's you know\npower and explosiveness that probably\nPeaks early in the third decade if it's\nstrength that Peaks a little bit later\nPeak cardiorespiratory Fitness again in\nyour 20s and then those things will\nstart to decline\nwhat's undoubtedly clear is for you and\nI we're pretty much in Decline so most\npeople listening to this are in a state\nof Decline and part of the objective I\nthink ought to be to slow the rate of\ndecline as much as possible but there's\nanother aspect to your question I think\nis very important right which is like at\nwhat point should you start putting\neffort into this\nand that's a very difficult question\nbecause it encompasses a couple of\nthings when you talk to a person let's\ndo this as a thought experiment you talk\nto a person the day before they're going\nto die I mean they would give anything\nand everything\nthey have for more chance at life\ndespite how high their motivation is\nthere's no Runway left\nconversely if you went into a high\nschool and talked to a bunch of freshmen\nand said I've got the program for you\nthat is going to add 15 years to your\nlife I mean they couldn't be less\ninterested right so there's a Sweet Spot\nsomewhere where\nI almost think people need to go through\na little bit of decline kind of like\nwhat you described it wasn't\nlife-threatening but you just need to\nrealize that you're fallible to sort of\nsay hmm\nI can project this movie forward a\ncouple of decades I'm now mature enough\nto maybe see my parents see my\ngrandparents Aunts Uncles friends\nPeople's Health deteriorate and realize\nthat's a bit of a reality check that\nit's coming for me but yet I still have\nlong enough to bend the Arc of my life\nand so I think those are the two curves\nthat we're trying to intersect yeah\nthat's a great answer and I and I\nappreciate that I feel the same way\nunfortunately always comes through some\nsort of pain or some sort of\nreality check or wake-up call that gets\nus going and it's interesting what you\nwere saying about cognitive function and\nability as well there were studies that\nI read that said that the average age of\nmost successful entrepreneurs is 37 and\nit's fascinating because we live in a\nworld right now where everyone wants to\nbe a successful entrepreneur by the time\nthey're 21 or 25 and we put these\nartificial pressures on ourselves when\nactually there's so much more to it in\nthe genetics versus environment debate\nwhat have you what's the latest in that\nspace of like because I think we're not\nyou said you dove into your family's\nhistory I think most of us are not fully\naware of our family's history even\nthough every time I saw a doctor growing\nup they'd always ask is there this in\nyour family's history is that that first\nof all how aware do we need to be of our\nfamily's history how important is that\nfor people to figure out and second of\nall what is that breakdown between\ngenetics and personal environment and\ncareer and work you know I think\nactually family history is such an\nimportant thing it's one of these things\nthat we stress to the nth degree with\nour patients so much so that you know it\ntakes them weeks sometimes to gather the\ninformation that we want to know because\nwe want to know and we give them 10\nquestions for each member of the family\nso your parents your grandparents your\naunts and uncles your siblings like we\nwant to know everything do they have\nhigh blood pressure do they have high\ncholesterol do they take this medication\ndo they take that medication what was\ntheir cognitive function like in the\nlast decade of their life you know what\ntype of cancers did they have did they\nhave low bone density you know do they\nhave osteoporosis I mean we really want\nto understand every detail about it and\nI think a big part of the reason why is\ncontrary to what\nmaybe people believe a genetic test does\nnot give you that information so if you\nand I went out and got a genetic test\nand I don't just mean an all you know\nover-the-counter genetic test like\n23andMe but I'm saying if we went out\nand got the best whole genome sequence\nmoney could buy we spend thousands and\nthousands of dollars and literally\nlooked at every one of our you know 20\nto 30 000 genes we still wouldn't be\nable to impute from a risk standpoint\nwhat you can gather from a very well\ncollected family history and the reason\nfor that is most genes by themselves are\nnot deterministic which really gets to\nyour second question so if most genes\nare not deterministic they need\nsomething in the environment to sort of\ntrigger them\nfurthermore most conditions that we care\nabout are polygenic it's easy to think\nof the sort of mendelian mono Gene type\nconditions they get a lot of attention\nand they're important to be sure but the\nvast majority of things that people care\nabout cancer heart disease dementia they\nare not really just related to a single\nGene and in many cases we don't even\nknow what the collection of genes look\nlike so genes matter but I think we're\ngoing to get the majority of our\ninformation by understanding our family\nhistory in terms of susceptibility and\nthe environment matters greatly and the\nextension of that is of course you have\ngreat agency over that yeah and what is\nthe best methodology for getting the\nfamily history in a complete\ncomprehensive way that's actually it can\nbe hard if members of the family are\ndeceased so for people your age and my\nage you know our grandparents I mean at\nleast for me my grandparents are long\ngone so it's you know do your parents\nreally remember and part of it it just\ncomes down to are they being prompted by\nthe right questions now again to be\nhonest in my family history I have very\nlimited understanding of grandparents\nbecause\nyou know they just died long enough ago\nand frankly I don't think my parents\nwere necessarily great historians of\nthis in my case where the bulk of my\nunderstanding came from was that my dad\ncame from a very large family you know\nthere were 10 kids two that died young\nso eight that survived to adulthood and\nthere I was able to elucidate really\ngood information and really understand\nthat there's something very bad going on\nwith respect to heart disease on my\nmom's side I could also see some issues\nwith her two siblings as well that also\ngave me a sense of you know what some\npredispositions might be where can\npeople find those questions or how can\nthey connect with that approach you know\nthat's a good question I I don't we we\nhave a a program that we've developed\ncalled early which is like a digital\nproduct that is our practice I know that\nit is within there got it yeah yeah so\npeople like look for early I don't know\nif you I should know how to do this if\nyou go to like earlymedical.com there's\na way to find it okay perfect yeah no I\nthink that that kind of practical step\nis so needed because one of the biggest\nthings when I was talking to my team and\ntalking to the community about health\none of the biggest things that came out\nis Jay would just stuck on where to\nstart like I don't know where to start I\ndon't there's just too much information\nout there it's over saturated everyone's\ntelling me to do this and that and it's\nalmost like let's figure out your\ngenetic history like that's a great\nplace to start because that's where we\ncame yeah this program early is divided\ninto 12 modules we think each module\nwould take you about a month to get\nthrough and that's the first or second\nmodule I think the first module is\nsetting your goals and going through\nkind of this type of exercise then the\nsecond module is okay how do you get\nyour family history how do you take that\ninformation and extract what the\nimplications are for you and then go\nfrom there what's your take on like full\nbody scans and that kind of testing and\nhow often should it be done because I\nthink again what's happening I was\ntalking to\nsome younger people in our audiences gen\nZ and it was just like going to see a\ndoctor has become like not even a\nthought and I could see that in my\ngeneration but I remember my parents\ngeneration like my mum will still call\nme up and be like have you seen the\ndentist every six months like have you\nbeen to the doctor every 12 months like\nyou know my mom will still do that with\nme but I find that that kind of culture\nis diminishing day by day because of a\nlack of trust because of a lack of\ntransparency so many different things\ncould just be laziness and complacency\nwhat is your take on getting checks\nwhich checks how often and I guess the\nquestion is how do people know how\nhealthy they are and early is a great\nplan but from the other point of view it\ndepends on the type of scam so for\nexample there are certain scans that are\ngoing to be very helpful at predicting\nrisk from heart disease so for example\nlike coronary calcium scan for the heart\nor a CT angiogram for the heart those\nare tests that I don't think are\nabsolutely essential but they can be\nvery helpful if you're trying to further\nstratify risk you refer to a whole body\nscan so the best example of a whole body\nscan that I think provides value is an\nMRI the reason being is an MRI doesn't\nhave radiation whereas a whole body CT\nscan or a pet scan would have staggering\namounts of radiation we would never want\nto do that just from a screening\nperspective but of course not all MRIs\nare created equal and anytime you're\ndoing a screening test you have to be\naware of something called sensitivity\nand specificity and these are really\nimportant parameters we've put out a lot\nof content on this because I think it's\nvery confusing for people so sensitivity\nis the capacity of a test to detect\nsomething if the something is present so\nif you're looking at a sensitivity of an\nMRI scanner for cancer the sensitivity\nis How likely is this to detect cancer\nif cancer is present\nso on the topic of whole body scanners\nMRIs are very sensitive and again not\nall MRIs are created equal but I'm\nassuming we're talking about the best of\nthe best yeah yeah that's good news\nmeans if you go into an MRI scanner and\nyou have a cancer the MRI is quite\nlikely to pick it up now it does have\nsome blind spots and every screening\ntest has a blind spot so a blind spot\nthat's worth acknowledging for an MRI is\na small calcified breast cancer that's\neasily going to get missed by an MRI and\nthat's why it's not a substitute for\nmammography a woman would need to do\nboth\nthe next parameter of of a screening\ntest is the specificity this says How\nlikely is this test to give you a\nnegative result if indeed the condition\nis not present so it's the mirror\nopposite of sensitivity\nhere is where those whole body scanners\nare abysmal they have very low\nspecificity what that translates to in\nEnglish is they have a lot of false\npositives I always tell patients look if\nyou're going to go and get these scans\nand we Advocate that our patients do but\nthey we do it in a much more kind of\nrobust way where it's part of a multiple\nsystem of screening tests so that we're\ncovering the bases of everything and\ntrying to attach to the strength and\nweakness of each study but when it comes\nto that MRI we say look there's a really\ngood chance you're going to come out of\nthis test and there's going to be some\nfalse positives we're going to need to\nchase down so I always feel bad when\npeople sign up to do these scans and\nthey aren't aware of that because it\ngenerates sometimes more stress on the\nback end yeah yeah I I went through that\nwe had an MRI done and they found like\nalmost like a group or a cluster of\nthings in an area and they're like oh\nthat could be\ncancer then I had to go and do a um uh\nendoscopy as well and luckily they found\nit was nothing but I remember for that\nweek before I was like that's it it's\nall over here it is like you know I need\nto whereas I think sometimes if you're\ntold up front hey Jay there's like a 15\nchance yeah I didn't I was not talking\nabout that yeah and we want to make sure\nour patients understand and by the way a\nsubset of our patients probably 10\ndecide I don't want to have the scan\nyeah because I don't want to cope with\nthat the stress yeah yeah and it was\nreal I was like all right I'm gonna have\nto get focused on figuring this out\nbecause it sounds bad and I didn't have\nthat layup as you said and it's it's\nreally interesting and and that's what I\nfind so fascinating today right like\nthere's managing your health and then\nthere's the stress and the pain that\ncomes with figuring your health out\nwhether it's the overexposure to too\nmuch information whether it's bad\ninformation in the past and then we're\nlike oh well just forget it I don't want\nto do any of it I mean that's what I\nfeel your book does and that's what your\nwork does is trying to help people\nfigure out well let me give you all the\ninformation here's how you can know\nwhat's good for you and test it for you\nand write for you one of the things that\nI love that you talk about is you talk\nabout the need to get rid of you know\njust focusing on a random diet or\nfollowing a random diet and actually\nlooking at like eating habits and\npatterns that work for you and so just\nputting a little footnote for everyone\nwho's listening the book will walk you\nthrough how to make sense of how to know\nwhat is right for you what is wrong for\nyou whether you should do something\nwhich I think is like the biggest\nanxiety driver for so many people when\nit comes to their health when it comes\nto food I think fasting has become\ntrendy it's become a big thing though\neveryone's talking about uh you know we\nhear so much about every single diet in\nthe world there's always a new one\nthat's coming on the surface how have\nyou helped people one-on-one actually\ndiscover what's right for them because I\nfound that my eating patterns are very\ndifferent to the trending habits of how\nto eat food and even fasting yeah I mean\nI think the first thing is you you said\nit's just letting people understand that\nthe less you can pay attention to social\nmedia fads and your news feed on Google\nor whatever the better acknowledge that\nthere is surprisingly little known about\nthe relationship between nutrition and\nhealth and people are going to be\nshocked to hear that because I think\nmost people think the exact opposite\nmost people think that nutrition is the\nmost important pillar of Health\nand the reality of it is outside of very\nextreme states that's that's really not\ntrue and the very little bit we know\nabout nutrition just frankly speaks to\nthe challenge of scientific inquiry into\nsomething as difficult as nutrition to\nstudy and the reason for that is you\ncan't study us as humans very well we're\nvery messy subjects so we're not like\nmice where you know you can put us in a\ncage and control what we're eating and\nfollow us through the duration of Our\nLives it doesn't work that way so when\nyou're trying to make inferences about\nnutrition in humans you have to rely on\npoorly controlled studies called\nepidemiologic studies which are fraught\nwith all sorts of limitations that I\ntalk about in the book or if you're\ngoing to control the study you can only\ndo it for a very short period of time\nthere's only a short period of time in\nwhich I can control exactly what you're\neating\nso as a result of that we don't know a\nlot so I always want to start with what\ndo we know well we know that protein is\na very important macronutrient there are\nfour macronutrients carbohydrates fats\nproteins and alcohol people kind of\nforget alcohol but it's important to\nunderstand it's very caloric and so it\nconstitutes a source of energy it's the\nworst macronutrient but nevertheless\nit's you know you'd be amazed sometimes\npeople are getting like 15 to 20 of\ntheir calories from alcohol if they\ndrink enough\nso protein is really important and it's\nnot a source of energy the way\ncarbohydrates and fat is but it's a\nstructural macronutrient and so I always\nstart with that and say look rule number\none is you have to make sure you're\ngetting enough protein and this is\nespecially true if you're over 50\nbecause if you're over 50 you start to\nbecome resistant to the effects of\nprotein that's called anabolic\nresistance and loss of muscle mass in\npeople over 50 is a significant driver\nof mortality and a significant driver of\na poor quality of life you know if you\nreally start to think about it even if a\nperson is of sound mind and they're not\nyou know suffering from some intractable\ndisease later in life a great source of\nmisery is simply being physically unable\nto do things after that it really comes\ndown to what do we understand about\nenergy balance well we understand that\ntoo much nutrition I call this over\nnutrition is bad and that the body\nhistorically developed lots of tools to\nstore energy because that's what allowed\nus to evolve the way we did\nand up until I don't know 100 years ago\nor so that was a great skill to have\nit's now uh thwarting Us in an in an\nenvironment of too much food so now this\nability that we had the superpower\nbasically to store excess energy has\nbecome a liability in the United States\ncertainly the vast majority of people\nprobably over 70 of people are\novernourished and that's the thing\nthat's driving a lot of their poor\nhealth if you're overnourished you have\nto correct that problem the way to\ncorrect that problem is to eat less and\nthere are three strategies to do that\none of them is to deliberately go about\ncutting calories that's called calorie\nrestriction or CR\nthe other one is called dietary\nrestriction that means limit certain\nthings within the diet and if you are\nrestrictive enough that will indirectly\nalso reduce total intake and then the\nthird is fasting or time restricted\neating where you create a narrower and\nnarrower window each day in which to eat\nall of these things can work and all of\nthose things have significant\nlimitations that you as an individual\npracticing this need to know yeah it was\nincredible I was looking at the just\nhistory of the design of plates and cups\nrandomly I don't even know how I got\nthere how much bigger they're getting\njust how much bigger they're getting and\nit was insane for me to think that the\nway plates are designed the way cups are\ndesigned the way anything's designed\ntransforms how we consume and it's\nfascinating to think that just because\nof a larger plate size we're now eating\nlarger amounts and we think it's normal\nin our time where someone else would\nhave think we were feasting I'm sure you\nstill get back to Europe all the time\nbut like look at the difference in\nportion sizes when you're in you know\nItaly versus the United States it's\ncomical what a difference it is yeah I\nremember as a kid coming to the states\nand obviously when you're a kid\neverything that's big is better yeah and\nI remember like pulling over at the gas\nstation and I'd see like this massive\nlike you know jumbo thing to fill your\ndrink up in and like you know forever\nrefills or whatever it is and just like\nas a kid I was like this is the coolest\nthing in the world and now you look and\nyou're like wow that's you know there's\nno need for that so it's it's\nfascinating also how these cultural\nshifts and cultural changes have made\nsome of these things harder for us today\nso you said CR Dr and TR those those are\nthe three that people need to experiment\nwith each of those basically if you are\nin that overnourished camp you need to\nemploy some combination of crdr and or\nTR and if you're adequately muscled\nthat's you just you can just focus on\nthat if you're inadequately muscled you\nhave the added challenge of needing to\nboost protein intake to match strength\ntraining while engaging in CR drtrtr\nyeah but the raw of it is that's it yeah\nyou know the rest of it the alphabet\nsoup of diets is just it's all noise I\njust encourage people to not fixate on\nthe trend and just think about those\ndifferent things because you know look\neach of the alphabet soup diets fits\ninto some form of Dr I mean and that's\ntrue whether you're talking carnivore or\nvegan or everything in between those are\njust forms of Dr and they can all be\neffective but you have to be aware of\nthe limitations of each and make sure\nyou're circumventing them yeah\nabsolutely absolutely I I think that one\nof the things that there's a lot of\nquestion marks around as well from the\ncommunity that they were asking was\nnutrition which you've beautifully\nclarified there but nutrition versus\nsupplements yeah and the need for\nsupplements and I think I would love to\nhear your takes on supplements that are\nworking types of supplements types of\ningredients types of chemicals that are\nmaking a difference natural supplements\ntoo I'd love to hear your thoughts on\nnootropics because I'm just hearing\nabout New Tropics everywhere right now\nadaptogens as you just tried as well\nwe've been we've been focusing on\nadaptogens I'd love to\nlet's talk about your take on great\nsupplements that everyone needs to take\nnot not a brand but I mean like\nseriously and then you take on\nnootropics and adaptogens that would be\nfantastic I mean I definitely do take\nsome supplements I'm always careful to\nkind of make disclosures so one thing I\ndo supplement I take something called Ag\nand I'm an investor in ag but I've been\ntaking it long before I invested in it\nand I know the founder very well I'm\nvery under the hood of exactly how their\nproducts are made and sourced and for\nfolks who aren't aware AG is like a\ngreen that you you know just mix in with\nwater I drink it every morning they\nsponsored the podcast\nand my approach to that is if you buy\nthe thesis that we need to be having x\namount of vegetables a day and let's be\nclear and be transparent I can't\nguarantee that that is true\nbecause we don't know that's another\nexample of something that the\nepidemiology tells us is true but there\nare many confounders there\nbut my view is that it's better to err\non the side of that's probably true than\nthe than the counter so if you buy the\nthesis that you need x amount of\nvegetable a day\nI actually find it very difficult to do\nthat without exception there are lots of\ndays I can but there are enough days\nthat I can't so my view of a supplement\nlike AG is it's my belt and suspenders\napproach it's it's basically my way of\nguaranteeing that by seven o'clock in\nthe morning I've met my needs and then\nif I have a salad for lunch and dinner\nas well perfect I went a little\noverboard but that's better than the\nreverse to me so that's one and AG\nspecifically talking about that kind of\na supplement that's a vegetable focused\nsupplement that's right not all\nsupplements uh that's right specifically\nfocused that's that specific age yeah\nyeah there's another supplement I take\nwhich is a probiotic now no one has been\na more\nvocal critic of the probiotic space than\nme I have generally viewed it as a space\nthat has demonstrated no efficacy\ndespite all the intentions in the world\nin the past year I have sort of changed\nmy take so there was a study that came\nout that looked at a certain type of\nprobiotic and noted that a certain type\nof bacteria in it would help with the\nproduction of something called butyrate\nand this was actually helping with\nglucose disposal the results of this\nstudy actually were pretty impressive it\nwas a relatively short study a\nthree-month study but it demonstrated in\nthe group that was actually taking this\nprobiotic and this was in a blinded\nrandomized trial that these patients\nwith type 2 diabetes had a significant\nreduction in in blood glucose even\nthough I don't have type 2 diabetes I\nsort of subscribe to the idea that\neverybody benefits from lower blood\nglucose including those without diabetes\nso that's a probiotic that I take I\ndon't have any involvement with the\ncompany the company is called pendulum\nbut I take their I take their glucose\ncontrol of probiotic can you walk us\nthrough a bit on glucose control because\nI think that's still an area that for\npeople who are not as well informed that\nthat's an area that I I learned about\nprobably in the last year and a half\nthat has changed what I eat first thing\nin the morning it's just what I'm eating\nat different times like to me I was just\nlike oh if I need a boost of something\nas long as it's a healthy sugar it's\nfine not only to realize that you know\ncausing spikes in my blood blood glucose\nlevel so could you walk us through that\na little bit you know glucose is this\nessential very simple carbohydrate it's\nkind of the final common pathway of most\ncarbohydrates there are other simple\ncarbohydrates as well fructose being one\nof them so sugar for example table sugar\nis a is a molecule of fructose and a\nmolecule of glucose but glucose is the\nis the most abundant carbohydrate final\nbreakdown product and it's very highly\nregulated at any point in time you're\nwalking around with you know if you\nhaven't eaten that day somewhere between\nfour and five grams of glucose in your\nblood maybe say four to six grams of\nglucose in your blood which is just over\na tablespoon or a teaspoon rather so\ntiny tiny amount but you're using it\nconstantly and therefore your liver is\nconstantly putting more out into your\ncirculation ever so delicately and the\nbalance of that is so fine that if that\nlevel were to be just twice as much if\nyou were to go from one teaspoon two\nteaspoon to two teaspoons that would be\nconsistent with having type 2 diabetes\nso type 2 diabetes is a condition where\nan individual can't control the amount\nof glucose in their blood\nthis is very problematic because glucose\nwhen it becomes too high starts sticking\nto proteins and it starts causing damage\nall over the place but primarily to\nsmall blood vessels so blood vessels in\nthe heart blood vessels in the kidney in\nthe brain if you're in if you're you\nknow in the extremities of the toes\nthat's why people type 2 diabetes are\nmore susceptible to amputations kidney\ndisease heart disease Strokes\nAlzheimer's disease all of these things\nanything that compromises blood flow and\noxygen\nso it turns out that even if you don't\nhave type 2 diabetes and that today is\njust defined by a threshold of average\nblood glucose above 140 milligrams per\ndeciliter even if you are not in that\ncategory it still appears that your\nmortality goes down the lower your\naverage blood glucose so meaning within\nthe normal range of glucose lower is\nstill better people sometimes say\nwell does that just mean you know you\nshould never eat a food that raises\nblood glucose no that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that at all what it\nmeans is you need to be mindful of\nmatching your glucose consumption to\nyour capacity to dispose of glucose and\nthose are factors that are of course\nhighly impacted by how much you sleep so\nsleep interruptions in sleep\ndramatically reduce Your Capacity to put\nglucose into your muscles which means\nglucose levels get higher it also has to\ndo significantly with how much you\nexercise and how much muscle mass you\nhave so people can have completely\ndifferent tolerances for glucose and I\nthink I write quite a bit about this\nwhich is you know basically trying to\nunderstand your your glucose tolerance\nlevel comes down to matching it with\nyour insulin sensitivity muscle mass\nactivity levels sleep stress Etc\nabsolutely thank you so much sorry and I\ngot you off from moving away so just to\ngo back to this other point quickly so\nthere are lots of other supplements that\nI think can be really valuable I think B\nvitamins are very important especially\nmethylated B vitamins vitamin D is very\nimportant many people I think don't have\nsufficient levels of vitamin D I think\nthe data on vitamin D we could do an\nentire podcast on that the clinical\ntrials looking at vitamin D levels are\nreally poorly done clinical trials and\nso I think if a person looks out at the\nliterature and the literature says\nthere's no evidence that vitamin D\nreally helps I would argue pretty\nstrongly that those trials haven't asked\nthe right question and weren't designed\ncorrectly so my view is it's better to\nprobably err on the side of caution and\nmake sure your vitamin D is probably\nsomewhere between about 40 and 60 and if\nyou're not achieving that through\nnatural exposure to sunlight which many\npeople are not then you're probably\nbetter off supplementing there are a\ncouple of other supplements I really\nbelieve in and I think magnesium is a\nvery important one and I think you have\nto be thoughtful about the form in which\nyou take magnesium so you can take\nmagnesium in a slow absorbing form or a\nfast absorbing form that's poorly\nabsorbed technically and I think we need\nboth right so I think that I'm like a\npoorly absorbed magnesium would be like\na citrate glycinate or oxide and those\nactually really help with bowel\nregularity So for anybody who's a little\nbit constipated or just you know kind of\nneeds to be a little bit more regular we\nalways want to have in anywhere from two\nto five hundred milligrams of one of\nthose forms conversely I think virtually\neverybody also benefits from a slow\nabsorbing form of magnesium the brand\nthat I like is called slow mag again I\ndon't have any affiliation with any of\nthese companies unless I'm disclosing it\nas I did with ag that actually you know\nso most people if they notice oh I have\na little bit of cramping sometimes or\nyou know I'm getting little palpitations\ncalled PVCs sometimes those get a lot\nbetter with magnesium supplementation so\nso I think most people benefit from that\nthere's another type of magnesium that\nI'm a fan of called magnesium L3 and 8\nwhich is magnesium paired to a\ntransporter that gets the Magnesium into\nthe brain I think there's reasonable\nevidence I wouldn't say it's incredible\nbut I think it's quite good that\nmagnesium L3 and 8 is beneficial to the\nbrain and and might even have some\ncapacity to reduce the risk of dementia\nbefore bed I tend to rely on ashwagandha\nwhich I believe you said is in there so\nI take a big dose of ashwagandha and\nGlycine and again I take that magnesium\nL3 and 8 and those are kind of things\nthat I think help with reducing cortisol\nand making it a little easier to sleep\nthen the final supplement that I do\nthink most people benefit from and there\nare probably many others but I'm just\nsort of going through a few that I can\nthink of would be fish oil so most\npeople probably don't consume enough\nMarine fat to get what I think are ideal\namounts of EPA and DHA which are two\nvery special types of fats called\nomega-3\nfatty acids and EPA and DHA\nI think the balance of evidence is is\nquite strong that they're both\nbeneficial to the heart and the Brain\nEPA probably a little bit more for the\nheart DHA probably a little bit more for\nthe brain I take a brand that I've had\ntested because you always want to be\ncareful about contaminants here and it's\nit's made by a company called Carlson's\nagain I have no affiliation with them\nbut I take their EPA and DHA\num daily as well that's a fantastic\nsummary for anyone who's who's looking I\ntake all those things yeah you know I\nthink that's a brilliant summary and I I\nreally hope everyone is listening and\nwatching you know get those checks and\ntests done and and grab those\nsupplements because again I like what\nyou're saying that it's all about airing\non the side of caution right it's it's\nalmost like protecting yourself being\nsafe rather than assuming that a you get\nthis or B it doesn't really matter you\nknow is it that we used to find these\nsupplements in other forms before or as\nhumans if we always ignored this and now\nwe've suddenly figured it out or has our\nlifestyle just got so stressful and\nintense that we're needing more of all\nof this to support the pace at which\nwe're moving yeah it's a great question\nI do think that the supplement world is\nsuch a slippery dirty world that I\nalways want to throw out a disclaimer\nwhich is when I talk about these things\nI'm also very diligent about the brands\nthat I buy so again I have no\naffiliation with any of these entities\nbut having looked at third party testing\nI find the brand gero j-a-r-r-o-w the\nthe brand pure encapsulations to be two\nof the most reputable companies out\nthere so I'm basically always going to\ntry to buy from them if I can even if\nI'm paying a little bit of a premium\nyour question is a very good one and I\ndon't know how much you've paid\nattention to kind of the field of\nregenerative agriculture but it's a\ntopic that interests me quite a bit and\nThe more I've read about it\num The more I've come to realize that I\nactually think part of the problem is\nour food today is far less nutrient\ndense than it once was and so I do think\nthat many of us don't get the same\nquantity and density of nutrients today\nthat we did for the same caloric intake\nsay 50 years ago and the proponents of\nregenerative agriculture would argue\nthat a big part of that has to do with\nsoil health so as the health of the soil\nhas deteriorated with more tillage more\nfertilizers less crop rotation all of\nthese things the net result of that is\nthe plants themselves are less healthy\nso when you're eating a plant you're\ngetting less nutrient density and of\ncourse when you're eating meat if you're\nan omnivore the meat is all also less\nhealthy and less nutrient dense because\nit's eating a less nutrient dense plant\nwhich is growing in a less nutrient\ndense soil and so the old adage that you\nknow it's hard to be healthier than the\nanimal you eat which can't be much\nhealthier than the plant it eats which\ncan't be much healthier than the soil it\ngrows in brings this whole thing full\ncircle and so I suspect that that plays\na pretty significant role in it coupled\nwith the changes in our lifestyle right\nso many of us would have got sufficient\nvitamin D for example in the past\nbecause we would have been outside more\nand we would have been active more and\nyou know today we aren't as one example\nare you seeing the rise of more\nregenerative farming and places to buy\nregenerative vegetables or yeah I mean\nis that even a thing yeah no it\nabsolutely is and and there there are\nthere are some great places uh you know\ncertainly one of my sincere hopes is\nthat you know we see we see a greater\nand greater movement to scale this\nbecause I I do think Regen of\nAgriculture is not only what I think of\nas one of the most important ways in\nwhich we can improve human health\nthrough nutrition but but for folks who\nare also concerned with with climate\nchange and the effects of anthropogenic\nCO2 regenerative agriculture probably\nhas more potential to attenuate that\nthan anything else inclusive of\nelectrifying the entire Transportation\ngrid and that's a pretty bold statement\nit is it's very important that's what I\nwant to dive into it too like what gives\nyou confidence to make that bone\nstatement like what have you seen that\nhas given you that conviction it really\ncomes down to understanding the capacity\nfor plants to fixate carbon I'm sure\neverybody understands you know the\nbasics of how how CO2 works right so why\nwhy is there a concern with the\ncombustion of fossil fuels because when\nyou're combusting a fossil fuel whether\nit be cold or natural gas you're taking\ncarbon that was sequestered billions of\nyears ago in the form of fossilized you\nknow know organic matter and you're now\nliberating that carbon dioxide out so\nhow do we get carbon dioxide back in the\nsystem well plants do that so plants\nhave a capacity to do something that no\nanimal does which is they fixate carbon\nso they fixing carbon literally is just\nthe chemical process of taking a carbon\nout of the out of CO2 and attaching it\nto another hydrocarbon the way that\nregenerative agriculture works is by\nstoring more and more CO2 and carbon\nspecifically in the soil so right now\nthe way conventional agriculture works\nwhen you're constantly tilling the soil\nyou're leaching carbon out of the soil\nand so you know when you look at the\nmathematical models that look at how\nmuch carbon could be brought back into\nthe ground and sequestered I.E brought\nout of the atmosphere it's more\nsignificant than the carbon that's being\nput out through the combustion of fossil\nfuels the reason I'm particularly\nexcited about that is you're basically\ngetting two ends for the price of one\nright so you're reducing atmospheric CO2\nbut doing so in a manner that's also\nvery positive for our health because in\ndoing that you're increasing the soil\nhealth and by extension then the\nnutrient density of plants and\nultimately animals and ourselves what's\nyour take on regenerative agriculture\nversus lab produced vegetables I have\nyet to see any evidence that laboratory\nproduced meats and vegetables can be\ndone really well at scale or that they\nare particularly\ncertainly any more viable in terms of of\nthe nutrient density I think in part it\ncomes down to the complexity of soil\nthere's a great book I would recommend\nfor people who want to go really deep on\nthis I believe the book is called what\nyour food ate and it's it's a wonderful\nbook it's a it's a bit of a deep dive\nit's a nerdy book it's not Light reading\nand they go into incredible detail about\nDavid Montgomery yes and there's another\nonce you get under the hood of how\ncomplex soil is so for example many\npeople talk about the human gut biome\nand uh you know we talked to minutes ago\nabout probiotics right well the human\ngut biome is really complicated and we\nhaven't figured out a way to perfectly\nmodel it I mean maybe we're just getting\nto the point where we can figure out if\nwe add a little bit more of one bacteria\ncan it make a difference in in the\ndirection that this thing goes well it\nturns out that soil is probably even\nmore biodiverse and complicated than the\nbacteria in our gut and so again I just\nthink it's very difficult for us to sort\nof play\nsuper farmer and think that we can kind\nof replicate what Nature has figured out\nfor you know literally a billion years\nwell see so yeah so your understanding\nis actually that we don't know enough\nabout the complexity of the soil which\nis actually what is impacting the\nquality of the vegetable or hence then\nall the way up all the way up the chain\nhence even if we can produce a vegetable\nor me in a lab\nit won't have that same that's my take\non it which says nothing about it which\nsays nothing by the way about the scale\nfactor I think at the end of the day\nscale matters like I mean food\nI I think it's safe to say agriculture\nis the second largest industry in the\nworld just in terms of like the\nmagnitude of what it takes you have to\nhave solutions that work\nbroadly and and by the way I think\nthat's still there are certainly\nproponents of regenerative AG who say it\ncan be scaled but I think that's an open\nquestion still regenerative agriculture\nright can it be scaled to meet the needs\nof the entire world yeah what are the\nchallenges with scaling that it's a\ntotally different infrastructure\ntruthfully right it's not going to rely\non as much automation so for example\nlike you're not going to be able to rely\nyou know so so one of the Hallmarks of\nregenerative AG is you're not using\nfertilizer uh you're not so you're not\nusing the nitrogen of a fertilizer\nyou're actually using the nitrogen of\nthe animals another one is you're not\nusing pesticides so you're crop rotating\ninstead of using pesticides and allowing\nyou know the crops themselves to\ngenerate resistance uh by cycling them\nand not letting the pests get used to\nthe same crop not to you know belabor\nthe point but all of a sudden the\nindustry that is now dominated by the\nthe Pioneers the cargills the monsantos\nof the world it's going to have to look\nvery different so I think that's a big\nchallenge is going for from Big to\nlittle and then scaling little if that\nmakes sense where are the places like if\npeople are fascinated to\nhave you been out to any regenerative\nagriculture Farms or anything yeah yeah\nyeah there's there's one outside of\nAustin there's actually one here in\nCalifornia so there's not many there's\nlike I mean there's so the one out in\nCalifornia is called there's a\ndocumentary made about it called I think\nthe documentary was called biggest\nlittle farm that's not too far from here\nby the way and uh my kids were obsessed\nwith this so we like watched this\ndocumentary like I don't know 15 times\nbut you'll get a sense of what it looks\nlike but yes no I mean you I think\neverybody can find regenerative farms\nnear them so really it's just a question\nof helping Farmers understand why\nultimately it is in their best interest\nto do this so economically it makes more\nsense but look it's going to require the\ngovernment completely changing incentive\nstructures and changing the way they\nsubsidize certain crops today it's a big\nshift yeah what's your take on people\ntrying to create Little Farms in their\nhome like the they're like mini growing\nyeah I mean look I think it's wonderful\nI think if you can grow your own\nvegetables I mean we have a vegetable\ngarden and there's no question that the\nthe the vegetables we grow taste\ninfinitely better than anything we're\ngoing to buy at the grocery store and\nhow do you take care of the soil in in\nyour area you're saying because it's\nuntouched it naturally has yeah I mean\nwe use we compost our own stuff so but\nit's you know look it it's not even big\nenough to completely feed us right so\nyou know it's it's there's work that\ngoes into this and I and I have friends\nthat that do have the time and effort to\nat least you know support themselves\nfully that's beautiful yeah yeah I love\nthat you know my wife's really my wife's\nreally big on that she wants to build a\nlittle vegetable garden on the back\nright now in in the same way because\nthat's one of her core beliefs as well\nso just this past weekend I was I had to\nput all this chicken wire around the\nfence where our garden is because these\nsquirrels are figuring out a way to get\nunder the fence and they're like eating\nall the tomatoes and the peppers and\nstuff and it's like my son who's eight\nthis is his project and it just drives\nhim nuts when the squirrels are getting\nthem so what what a great age to like\nget connected so it's so great yeah it's\nthe land into the soil into growing\nthat's so beautiful I love that yeah\nwe've had to go for problem for for\nyears here and it's like it's always\nruining the lawn and I'm like well if I\nplant vegetables here those vegetables\nare gonna be gone yeah you have to be\nyou have to be smart about it yeah yeah\nincredible uh I I want to make sure that\neveryone knows the book dives into\ncancer Alzheimer's uh we talked about\nwe're going to dive into exercise in a\nsecond we talked about diet you know\neating less eating patterns I want to\nmake sure because I don't want to either\nrepeat things that are already in the\nbook or repeat things you've talked\nabout in other interviews and so I just\nwant everyone who's listening to know\nthat that you know it dives into\nmultiple key diseases that we're all\nstruggling with today and the biggest\nchallenges one thing I wanted to talk to\nyou about which I think you really\nwonderfully highlighted was this\nchallenge between physical health and\nemotional health\nand you talk about the need for\nprioritizing emotional health as well\nand I've found that so much of my\nsubtle emotional health was so based on\nphysical health so what I mean by that\nis I found at one point in doing all of\nmy checks and tests that and by the way\nI was doing I was functioning it like a\nreally optimal level I was just feeling\ntired and when we did my test we found\nthat my vitamin D was at a 10. this was\naround two three years ago and I\nrealized the majority of the challenges\nI was having was because I was sleeping\nwe rented a home during covid\nwe moved from our apartment and when\nwe've rented this space I never slept\nwell in that space because\nit was just the most like noisy loud\narea because there were it was it was in\nthe middle of\nuh too many animals too many things at\nnight like going through the floorboards\nlike it was an old old space and so\nthere was like I was waking up multiple\ntimes which I don't usually go through\nand so I started to find that a lot of\nmy emotional challenges whether it's\nfatigue irritability\num you know stress because of that\nenvironment was causing emotional\nchallenges but it was actually all\ncoming from a physical space if that\nmakes sense for sure and and I think so\noften these days I find a lot of us are\njust trying to solve everything in our\nmind rather than recognizing that often\nit's a chemical it's biological it's\nit's physical so I want to just point\nthat out to people because I think a lot\nof us like I could have done anything to\nchange I was working out I was trying to\nsleep right I was doing everything I\npossibly could but because my vitamin D\nwas at a level 10 there's not much you\ncan do and instead of apart from taking\nVitamin D supplements how where are you\nsaying this relationship where are you\nseeing this relationship between\nemotional health and physical health\nwell they're absolutely linked and you\nknow I think that one of the things that\nI've observed you know my therapists\nwill always ask me at the beginning of a\nsession is how are you doing physically\nso are you in pain right is you know is\nyour shoulder bugging you is your back\nbugging you do you have like an ulcer in\nyour mouth or something like like\nliterally something like that how are\nyou rested and how much stress are you\nunder and the reason I think is those\nthings exacerbate vulnerabilities that\nwe have on the emotional side on the\nmental side so if you take an individual\nin two parallel same individual and two\nparallel universes but in one situation\nthey have lots of issues going on\nphysically right so they're not well\nrested their vitamin D is low they're in\npain and you have another individual for\nwhich everything is physically uh firing\non all cylinders and you present them\nwith the same emotional distress you're\ngoing to see a completely different\nresponse that's a big part of why I\nthink it does matter to keep your\nphysical health in order to optimize\nyour emotional health but I would also\nargue that you could still have your\nphysical health in perfect order and you\nknow not becoming close to addressing\nyour emotional health when you use the\nterm emotional health what does that\nconstitute for you I try to distinguish\nit from mental health right I think\nmental health is a subset of emotional\nhealth but it's the perhaps the more\nmedicalized piece of it so in in\nmedicine we use something called the DSM\nthe diagnostic and statistical manual I\nthink we're on version five and that's\nthe one that codifies psychiatric\nillnesses right everything from\ndepression anxiety different personality\ndisorders and all sorts of things like\nthat and those things clearly matter but\nI'm talking about something that is\napplicable to everyone whereas those\nthings might only be applicable to\npeople who would meet diagnostic\ncriteria\nso emotional health in the sense the way\nI think about it kind of encompasses\nyour relationships with other people\nyour sense of purpose fulfillment\nHappiness joy\nspontaneity all of these things that\nevery human should be thinking about\nbecause every human is a part of those\nthings in my case you know so so the\nbook is written basically at 17 chapters\n16 of the chapters are me\nyou know writing about it as the doctor\nyeah the scientist and then the last\nchapter which is about emotional health\nis me actually just writing about my\npersonal experience and my own well\ntransformation I think would be an\nunderstatement you know I think that the\nmost important lesson for me in the past\ndecade has been that\nall the health stuff that's that makes\nup most of that book how do you reduce\nyour odds of getting cancer how do you\nreduce your odds of getting heart\ndisease Alzheimer's disease how do you\nmake sure your muscles work better in\nthe last decade of you know all those\nthings they're very important but if\nyou're miserable none of it matters\nright if your relationships suck none of\nit matters\nand I can't state that enough but I I\ncouldn't have understood that a decade\nago you know I had to personally\nexperience things going really wrong I\nhad to nearly lose everything to realize\nI've really missed the plot here and if\nI don't get this stuff addressed then\nthe rest of this outliving doesn't mean\nanything what was the wake-up call for\nyou or what was the uh I mean I think if\nyou know it was essentially almost\nlosing my family right it was just being\nso so selfish and so such an awful\nperson that you know I I finally woke up\nand realized how much I was hurting\neverybody around me and I was confronted\nwith that and confronted with the\nreality that I had no choice but to go\naway and get help to to sort of address\nmy own reasons for why my coping\nmechanisms were so negative what made\nyou so selfish and awful like where did\nthat come from well I mean again at the\ntime I had no clue but but also at the\ntime I don't think I was even privy to\nunderstanding what\num what I was doing but but obviously as\nI as I talk about in the chapter when I\nwhat I basically learned is I think a\nlot of my adaptations had to do with you\nknow certain things in my childhood some\nof which were you know I describe as\nkind of Big T trauma and some of which\nare frankly just little tea trauma but\nbut collectively they just produced a\nresponse an adaptation I talk about this\nsort of model of trauma where wounded\nchildren become adaptive children\nand adaptive children are there to\nprotect the wounded children and I think\nthat's a remarkable trait of us as\nhumans right we are very resilient the\nproblem is that a lot of those\nadaptations become maladaptive in adult\nlife and I think that's really what I\nwas dealing with was so many of my\nadaptations\nyou know for example control Drive\nPerfection anger all of those things\nserved me quite well as a child but as a\nhusband and as a father they were not\nserving me well anymore and all of the\ngood that came from those adaptations\nfor example a strong work ethic a desire\nto to to do good was was more being done\nfor the wrong reasons it was I'll show\nthem I will you know I will matter my my\nself-esteem will be based on performance\nEtc and I think all of that had to be\nturned on its head for me that was sort\nof my journey was learning how to undo\nall of the maladaptive behaviors to try\nto keep the good parts of the adaptation\nand then shed the the harmful ones why\ndo you think it takes us thank you for\nsharing by the way and I know you're\ngoing to more depth in the book and I I\nfind this fascinating and I think people\nI'm so happy that you address it because\nI think people find it especially\nfascinating from coming from you\nbecause\noften they're just seen as such separate\nthings and separate Pursuits but for you\nto unify in them is is really really\ninteresting why do you think it takes so\nmany of us so long to address the very\nroot cause of so much of our problems\nand you partly covered it there that\nsome of these things become superpowers\nin the material world like they're\nphenomenal\nyou know manipulating the outside world\nthrough control and uh perfectionism Etc\nbut then in the inner world in the the\nfamily tends to suffer from that why\ndoes it take us\nso long to Look Backwards almost to look\nforwards in both our genetic background\nand our also genetic trauma in that\nsense I don't think we want to\nuncover painful things unless the pain\nthat we're confronting is greater than\nthe pain we're going to encounter by\ndoing so that's probably my simplest\nthought as to why I just think that like\nhow many people without ever having\nexperienced dental pain would go to the\ndentist right like you do as a kid\nbecause you're sort of told but but when\nI think about now like why do I put so\nmuch effort into taking care of my teeth\nit's because I've learned how miserable\nit is when\num when I don't I think\nuntil you experience enough discomfort\nin the present\nand in my case that came through the\ncircumstances I write about the pain of\nturning around and going back and\nexploring what happened and why and and\nthen embarking on the corrective steps\nand learning a whole new language and a\nwhole new set of skills I mean there's\nwe in chemistry we call that the\nactivation energy of a chemical reaction\nright so you know every chemical\nreaction has to overcome sort of some\nsort of activation energy and the higher\nthat activation energy the less likely\nthat reaction is to take place so\nenzymes\nwhich people have heard what's an enzyme\ndo an enzyme or a catalyst will make\nthat reaction more likely it lowers that\nbarrier to Activation so I think what we\nneed in our life are catalysts we need\nsomething and unfortunately I think\nsometimes it often has to be painful a\nloss to to force us to do that I make a\npoint when I showed up in the first\nrehab place I went to there was this\nthere's a woman that I met there who\ncould sort of see from the look on my\nface that I wasn't happy to be there she\njust said to me in in a manner that was\njust so perfect she said hey nobody\nshows up here on a winning streak yeah\nthis is just 100 True how how did you\nhelp the people around you that you\ncared about\nbe patient as you went through your own\nJourney because I feel like it's really\ninteresting when we're trying to solve\nour own wounds and pain it's already so\nhard but because we've taken on\nresponsibilities or commitments whether\nthat be in a marriage or as a parent or\neven as a CEO or a boss or whatever it\nmay be it's like all of a sudden you\nhave so many other commitments that you\nhad taken on even before you realized\nyou had to work on yourself did you find\nyourself helping them while you helped\nyourself to be around and be supportive\nas opposed to like tap out and say you\nknow what we don't want to be around\nbecause I think we often look at like\nhow are people helping us in our time of\nstruggle but sometimes it's like we\nalready committed to them and then we\nrealized that does that make any sense\nit makes a ton of sense and I I will\ntell you I think it just speaks to how\nfortunate I am and perhaps why I feel I\nhave an obligation to talk about it\nwhich is I just think I was really lucky\nand that the people around me stood by\nme and let me go through this and and\ngave me the chance to do it and stood by\nme because I don't I don't think many\npeople would have I really you know I've\nsaid this to my wife many times I\ndescribe her as like you know sort of\nHall of Fame wife who didn't really need\nto stick by me I think she had enough\nreasons to leave and take my kids away\nand just say to hell with that guy and\nthat she didn't I will forever\npay that forward and I think the same is\ntrue of people that I worked with who\nknew I was struggling I think deep down\nbelieved\nthat I was not a bad person I was a good\nperson who did very bad things and that\nI deserved another chance I wish I could\nsay I was supporting them on that\nJourney but I don't think I was I think\nI was just reeling in pain and lucky\nthat they stood by me well thank you for\nsharing that that's that really hit me\nthere's\nyou know don't expect people to catch\nyou when you're falling but if they\nstand by you never let them leave you\naside because I think most of us could\nprobably\nthe fortunate ones attest to that I\nwould say that about my wife too I'd say\nthat about my parents I'd say that about\nthe people that I'm surrounded by that\nsometimes I haven't had the capacity to\nhelp them as I help myself even though I\nintend to but the problem sometimes is\nwe do the Other Extreme where we demand\nthem to help us that's the balance it's\nlike the gratitude that you're\ndisplaying right now is is actually like\nthe right I think a wonderful balance\nbecause we do either or we either go I'm\ngoing to solve this myself and I don't\nneed anyone or I want my family to solve\nmy problems for me interesting yeah like\nwe live in one of those extremes and\nyou're actually saying well I had to\nhelp myself I'd admit I didn't have the\ncapacity to help them at the time but\nnow I'm just grateful and I'm humbled by\nthe fact that they stayed here like\nthere's some there's some beauty to that\nand uh that that really resonates it's\nprobably four years after one of the\nevents that I write about in this book\nwhich was when my son almost died I was\ntalking to\nEsther perel and I was just saying I\ndon't think I could ever\nforgive myself for what I did and she\nsaid that's okay I think it's okay that\nyou remember this for the rest of your\nlife I think there's a degree of\nhumility you need to carry with you\nforever and I think that was really wise\nthing to say right like I think it would\nhave been easy to have said no no no no\nyou should just forget about this and\nmove on but she's like no you should\nremember this forever this is the\nhumility you need to remember and and\nshe described it in a very eloquent way\nwhich was you need to understand that\nthere's a monster in you and he's never\ngoing to go away\nI'm confident you will keep him in the\ncorner for the rest of his life but\ndon't ever take an eye off him yeah and\ndon't ever think that just because\nyou're better now you're better for life\nthis is a constant process yeah and and\nremembering that\nthere's a monster in you but you are not\nthat monster that's right yeah he's over\nin the corner and you have the you are\nthe one in charge of whether he stays in\nthat corner yeah it reminds me I\nremember in my early experience of\nliving as a monk I said to one of my\nmonk teachers I was I said\nI just feel like I'll never overcome my\nego like it just is too big like there's\nthere's too much to deal with and it's\nnot that it's coming out in an\nexternally gross way that it's\nmanifesting but I I can I know it's\nthere you know we've trained in\nself-awareness and and I can see it and\nhe said to me yeah it's always going to\nbe there because it's not going anywhere\nand he said it will always act as your\nanchor and ground you and humble you\neven when you saw to new heights or\nwhatever else your life brings to you\nthat you knowing that it's there is\nactually what will help you right you\nknow stay grounded which is such a\nbeautiful reminder as opposed to like\nego death and we're gonna crush it in\nit's interesting with the health too\nright with emotional health and physical\nhealth that from what you said the first\nthing you said today was\nyou know there are certain things from\nthe moment you're born that that's it\nit's already going in the wrong\ndirection\nand we often think of like how do I end\nthis so how do I start this how do I\nfinish this and it's like well most\nthings are just in motion they're not\nbeginning or ending they're just yeah\nalready happening and as you said\nearlier we're trying to slow it down or\nwe're trying to be aware of it or we're\nwe're trying to monitor it when you were\nspeaking about your family there and\nyou're talking about that emotional\nwell-being there was something that came\nto mind there were these two beautiful\nwords you used which one of them is used\na lot but one of them not so much but\nyou talked about joy and spontaneity and\nI love the word spontaneity I think it's\nnot used enough when we talk about\nemotional health Joy is used but the\nchallenge I find today when I'm talking\nto people is that we're so\nOverexposed to whether it's whether\nchemically we're talking about dopamine\nor whether we're just talking about like\nlike fun pleasure instant gratification\nwhich we've talked about for such a long\ntime that everything feels boring almost\nit's it's hard for people to get to a\nstate of Joy or spontaneity I find that\na lot of people have a sense of like\nwhat what's there to look forward to or\nlike oh nothing's that great it's okay\nlike you know whereas before and now\nit's like it feels like you've got to up\nthe\nresults so hard and the problem is even\nwhen you up it like you're thinking that\nhappiness is in Europe on that yacht\nright and in fact even if you got there\nit won't actually even live up to that\nexperience that you put in your mind\nright because it was never about the\nphysical manifestation of it it was it\nwas the idea that you've over exposed\nyourself to so much pleasure that now\neven the highest Pleasures don't satisfy\nor suffice how do we work on that like\nwhat is the health and emotional version\nof approaching that problem I wish I\nknew I mean and I think you're\naddressing one of the most important\nquestions and this is something I I\nreally struggle with because you know\nfor me I and I was just talking about\nthis with someone earlier today I think\nabout the next decade of my life this\namazing time where I get to be with my\nkids the most because you know as you're\nprobably aware the the data are pretty\nclear that once your kids leave for\ncollege the amount of time you will get\nto spend with them is is quite small I\nthink it works out to basically you have\na total of 19 years with your kids 18 of\nwhich occur until they leave for college\nand then one year is the sum total of\ntime you will spend with your kids the\nrest of your life on average so I look\nat that and I think I regret the time\nI've wasted so far right but so so\nthat's the stuff I talk about and now\nI'm here in the future I think wow the\ngreatest source of Joy I really\nexperience is with my family that to me\nis what spontaneity is Right spontaneity\nfor me is an important the reason I\nbrought it up is\nI'm a very rigid person by Nature like\npart of control for me is rigidity\ndeviating from my plan is a very hard\nthing to do but I also realize it's a\nvery important thing to do so like I'm\nthe kind of guy who makes lists on\nweekends me too right like there's just\never like there's a list of 12 things\nthat have to be done on Saturday and\neight things that have to be done on\nSunday and you can imagine that that\nthat rigidity takes any spontaneity out\nof life\nand one of the great things I've learned\nis how to screw the list sometimes the\nother day when I went to get you know\nhad to go to Home Depot to get all the\nchicken wire to do the thing like that\nwasn't on the list that day but I could\nsee that my son was upset that the\nsquirrels were eating his tomatoes and I\nwas like you know what I'm I'm supposed\nto be doing X Y and Z let's go to Home\nDepot yeah I think interestingly anyone\nwho who does that which I'm sure is\neverybody listening to this at some\npoint can experience that those are\nprobably the things that bring more joy\nthan the yacht in Ibiza it doesn't mean\nthat you should never go on the yacht in\nIbiza yeah I think it just means\nthat don't dismiss the stuff that's\nright in front of you and again for most\npeople\nI really do believe connection is that\nthing like just having intimate\nconnection with friends and family\nprobably provides more of that than any\nof these other kind of material things\nyeah and and I think what you're saying\nis actually true and I want to clarify\nthat point too that I actually think\nthat when you are\nnot missing the simple things that are\nright in front of you then when the big\nmaterial thing is right in front of you\nyou won't miss that either that's that's\nthe point I believe like I think that if\nsomeone is grateful\nfor where they're at and what they see\nand what they experience and are able to\nimmerse themselves in it then the same\nhappens on vacation the same happens on\nthe yard as as our thought experiment\nlike the idea is is that the ability to\nexperience a flower as a Thor experiment\nin the most immersive way allows you to\nexperience a garden which allows you to\nexperience a forest which allows you\nknow it's it's that you can't really\nfully experience the forest if you\ndidn't know how to experience a leaf\nthat idea of that much immerse and I've\nand I've personally experienced both the\npresence and absence of those\nexperiences where\nsometimes I'm walking up and down here\nor doing my morning hike and you\ncompletely Miss The View\nbecause you're on your phone or even if\nyour phone's not there you're thinking\nabout something and then and then second\nyou look up and you're oh wait a minute\nlike this was right there and so I think\nwe all experience presence and absence\nand I found that beautiful we think\nbeautiful things will make us more\npresence\nbut actually we'll be absent even in\nbeautiful things if they're not present\nfor the small things and I've seen that\nagain and again and again uh and in your\nexample and I'm just I'm only picking at\nthis because I think there's so much\nlived experience in what you're saying\nand and the scientific backbone helps\ntoo it's like how have you also not end\nup because it sounds like your kids and\nyour family is just so important to you\nwhich is beautiful and I think that's\ntrue for so many people but again I find\nthat a lot of the people that I'm\ntalking to are living at The Other\nExtreme where they're like Jay I am so\ngiving in to everything my kids want to\ndo what my family wants to do that I\ndon't even have any of my own habits and\ndisciplines right like for you going to\nget chicken wire was a spontaneous\nmoment of love for your son who's\nworried about this project that he loves\nwhereas for some people all they're\nliving in is not spontaneity but in\nurgency and and then they're not getting\nI was speaking to a friend the other day\nand they were telling me Jay I wake up\nat 6am but what happened and then I was\nkind of walking through their schedule\nwith them for the day and helping them\nmap habits and they were like I don't\nknow what and I was like well when do\nyou start cooking lunch for example that\nthey as part of their day they have to\ndo and they were like 12 and I was like\nso what happens between 6am and 12 noon\nthey're like I don't know I was like\nwhat do you mean like you know like\nthat's six hours of time like where does\nit go and then they were like emails\nphone calls random people calls random\nthings happen it's all like I'm like wow\nyou're waking up pretty early which is\namazing but now all of that six hours is\njust lost in kind of moving how have you\nfound that balance between like I love\nmy children I want to be there but I\nalso need to do everything I say in this\nbook which takes time and energy I don't\nwant to necessarily use myself as an\nexample because I also realize like I\nhave some really good things going for\nme which is I have like an amazing\nspouse and I have an amazing team and\nall of these things but what everyone\naround me has figured out is if you want\nto get the best out of me as a husband\nas a father as a friend as a boss as a\ncolleague whatever it is if you want the\nbest version of Peter he also so has to\nbe well rested he has to be eating well\nhe has to be exercising he has to be\ndoing the the things that he has to do\nevery day for his mental health I am\nactually quite structured when it comes\nto that stuff so I'm very routined with\nhow I do things so I do not take a\nsingle call or meeting\nwith very rare exceptions once a month\nthere's an exception to this rule before\n11AM I am scheduled without a break from\n11 to 5 every single day so I have six\nhours of pure schedule that I consider\nthat not my time it's my patient's time\nthat's my team's time that's me giving\n30 hours a week to everybody I get up at\nabout six from six to eleven is really\nsacred time so six to seven is just\ncoffee with my wife and playing with the\nkids so my daughter of course knows\nshe's still sleeping but the boys were\nplaying board games doing puzzles having\ncoffee doing whatever from seven to\neight is work just get the emails done\nuh read whatever I need to read et\ncetera Etc from 8 to 11 is Hobby plus\nexercise so every day I'm either in the\nsimulator driving or shooting my bow and\narrow and then I'm actually exercising\nfrom five till about seven is family\ntime so I'm usually cooking dinner\nplaying with the kids going to you know\nJiu Jitsu whatever it is and then seven\ntill ten is some combination of family\ntime plus work and that's where there's\nhas to be some flexibility like how much\nmore work do I need to do and the price\nI pay for that is I have to work on\nweekends too right why because like I'm\nforcing the time to be spread out and so\nthat means like yeah there's just you\nknow there's other things I'm going to\nhave to make sacrifices around but I\nguess my point of that is you have to\nkind of try to take hold of the schedule\na little bit and sort of say like there\nare certain things that are\nnon-negotiable so not exercising is a\nnon-negotiable not having some time with\nmy family is a non-negotiable I rarely\ntravel anymore I used to travel 20 days\na month I travel two to three days a\nmonth now just very deliberate and\nconscious decisions about\nhow I want to spend my time and the\nimportance of you know taking care of my\nbody in an effort to take care of\neverything else absolutely no it's and I\ndefinitely I agree I don't think we want\nto use ourselves as examples or you know\nas as the way to do it because\neveryone's so personal I think it's just\nuseful understanding that that structure\nis needed for that spontaneity what\nmight be more helpful for people to\nunderstand how I communicate this with\nmy wife so my wife is that person who\nwill put everybody ahead of herself so\nwhat I have to help my wife do is\nrealize hey like you need to go for a\nrun too because that matters a lot to\nyou and you need to go out with your\nfriends and have drinks once every two\nweeks because that matters or you need\nto go and get a mani pedi with your\ndaughter and actually relax I'll pitch\nin and do this other thing because I\nreally feel strongly about you doing\nthat and that's not something I would\nhave done before before I would have\njust sort of said hey it's awesome\nyou're doing everything great yeah yeah\nso I think as a spouse you want to sort\nof really understand that as true as\nthat is for me it's just as true for her\nI think that's the key thing in a and I\nwe don't have kids but I can definitely\nsay on a relationship level it's like\njust because your partner can do\nsomething and is doing something doesn't\nmean that you should just accept that as\nreality for the rest of time and I see\nthat that's one of the biggest\nchallenges in relationships is people\nfeel like their role is assumed because\nof what they've done in the past but no\none checked with them as to whether they\nwere okay continuing to do it or whether\nthey felt good doing it and we think\nwell they should tell us if they don't\nlike it they would tell us like I would\ntell them but often you find that\nsomeone so ingrained in playing a role\nthat they've even forgotten that they\nhave needs or or who they could be or\ncan be or they feel this over bearing\nburden or urgency in their role that\nthey just can't disconnect from it so\nyeah I think that's a great going to\nhighlight Peter I mean there's so many I\nreally do want to talk to you if you\nstill have the time I really do want to\ntalk to you about cancer and maybe\nAlzheimer's as well because we went on a\ndifferent direction which I wanted to go\ninto and which I loved but I want to\ntalk to you about cancer just because I\nlost\nI've lost three people in my life to\ncancer I lost my uncle who was my\nmother's brother when I was around\ngosh maybe I was around\nmaybe just about to be 18 or something\nlike that he had throat cancer and it\nwas tough to see him go through that it\nwas the first time someone in my direct\nCircle I'd kind of witnessed the Journey\nof someone like struggling going through\npain and and then you know dying at a\nyoung age he was like 57 years old and\nthen I saw my one of my probably my\nclosest friend\nuh who I lived as a monk with and he was\nstill a monk when he passed away and he\nhad colon cancer\nhe was like my age like he died two\nyears ago now so like that it was a bit\na couple years older so like 35 around\naround there about I believe\nsome of that was genetic which we found\nout afterwards or like during the\nprocess and he went through tons of\ncycles of chemo and like he tried\neverything like that guy had spirit and\nresilience and and everything in it you\nknow it was tough and then I lost my\nspiritual mentor to brain cancer\num in the same time frame during the\nyear of kovitz I also missed both of\nthese people's funerals because I\ncouldn't go back to London because you\ncouldn't fly at the time so anyway all\nof that to say I've just lost so many\npeople to cancer and I think that's just\nnot uncommon which is even worse in one\nsense like I think everyone who's\nlistening is like yeah Jamie too and so\nI think it's so important to talk about\nbecause\nI don't know was it one in three one and\ntwo is it I don't know what what the\nstats are but yeah because it's so\ncommon because it's so\nnormal now and just someone having\ncancer but at the same time it's the\nmost painful news in the world because\nyou kind of feel like you know where\nit's going to go what have we seen as\nproven ways of preventing and\nconfronting cancer\num both holistic and you know\ntraditional medicine you know the way I\nsort of think about it is there are\nthree things to be thinking about three\nthree categories so the first as you\nsaid is\nwhat steps can you take to prevent\ncancer the second question is if you get\ncancer how can you catch it as early as\npossible one thing we really do know is\nthat if you treat a cancer earlier your\nchances of beating it go up and the\nlonger you wait to treat it meaning the\nlater you catch it the worse your odds\nand then the third question is if you do\nfind cancer what are the ideal treatment\nstrategies let's start with the first\nquestion and this is the least\nsatisfying because we don't know a whole\nlot about what's causing cancer so we\nknow\ntwo things for sure we know that smoking\nis a Big Driver of cancer and we know\nthat obesity is a Big Driver of cancer\nnow obesity is a bit of a misleading\nterm because it's just kind of a overly\nsimplistic way to think about what's\nactually happening\nthe data say obesity but really what it\nmeans is insulin resistance and\ninflammation those are two Hallmarks of\nobesity that are present in 70 80\npercent of cases of obesity and if you\nlook at the data more closely that's\nwhat's actually driving cancer so it's\nnot actually how much fat you have on\nyour body it's more how much fat is in\ncertain parts of your body that are\nmetabolically problematic But after\nthose two things smoking and instead of\nobesity I just prefer to say poor\nmetabolic Health we have some one-off\nexamples we know that there are certain\ntypes of exposures pesticide you know\ncertain types of pesticides for example\ncertain type of toxins\nbut those don't account for the\nsignificant majority of them so for many\npeople cancer is still a mystery in\nother words whatever it caused whatever\ncaused the initiation of the genetic\nmutations that ultimately led to a\ncancer that the body was not able to on\nits own remedy\nis still a bit of a black box and some\nvery prominent cancer biologists\nactually just argue that it's bad luck\nin other words it's a stochastic process\nso our genes are constantly replicating\nbut when mistakes are made mutations\noccur and some of these mutations Drive\ncancer and there's broadly speaking two\ntypes of mutations there are mutations\nin tumor suppressor genes so these are\nmutations in genes that are there to\nstop cancers when cancers appear and\nthen there are mutations in what are\ncalled oncogenes These are genes that\npropagate cancer so mutations in any of\nthese things can actually lead to cancer\nso once you sort of accept that you're\ngoing to do everything in your power to\nnot get cancer which is to say you're\nnot going to smoke you're going to be as\nmetabolically healthy as possible you're\ngoing to exercise sleep do all those\nthings right the next most important\nthing is thinking about your strategy\nfor cancer screening you know this is\nwhere I probably differ significantly\nfrom the mainstream you know\nestablishment view which is is actually\nkind of you know know not that\naggressive on cancer screening I would\nargue that we have to be very aggressive\non cancer screening provided we can get\nour minds around the problem we\ndiscussed a little while ago which is we\nunderstand that there's going to be the\nharder you look for something the more\nlikely you are to find something that\nisn't relevant but if you understand\nthat going in and you're willing to\naccept that risk and evaluate each\nfinding in a thoughtful way I think that\nfor most people psychologically and\nphysically the benefit is is a net\npositive one and so that means looking\nat things that are for example with a\ncolonoscopy doing it earlier and more\nfrequently than is the standard\nrecommendation the standard\nrecommendation is not to begin till\nyou're 45. we would recommend that\neverybody even without a family history\nbegin at least five years before that\nit also means repeating colonoscopies\nmore frequently especially in the\nfinding of certain types of polyps whole\nbody screening you talked about with\ncertain types of MRIs we also use\nsomething called the liquid biopsy so\nit's a blood test that looks for really\nreally small fragments of DNA in the\nblood and can identify the presence of\ncancer and the tissue of origin now\nagain none of these tests are perfect so\neach of these tests have things that\nthey're going to miss but the idea is\nthat the more you're layering these\ntests the better your odds are finding\nsomething earlier and then the final\npoint is okay well what are the\nstrategies you know if should you have\ncancer and this is where I think we just\nhave a little bit more promise now than\nwe did a decade ago so a decade ago\nbecause this is the first time I did\nthis analysis in the previous 50 years\nso from you know 60 years ago until 10\nyears ago the overall survival\nImprovement in cancer was about three\npercent wow it is abysmal but in the\npast 10 years it's been about another\neight percent and while that doesn't\nsound remarkable and the implication of\nthat is is half the people who are\ndiagnosed with cancer today will still\ndie from cancer it's the biologic\ninsights and the trajectory that we're\non right now that gives me much more\nhope and that is\nprimarily based on a couple of things\nthe first is the field of Immunology has\nreally taken off the tools that we have\nto harness the immune system to attack\ncancer have become so dramatic\nimmunotherapy right that's right that it\nreally is\nI think within the next decade which I\nknow seems like an infinite amount of\ntime for someone who's got cancer right\nnow we're really seeing changes that I\nthink are going to allow immunotherapies\nto go from the niche place that they\noccupy in only working for certain types\nof cancers like melanoma and kidney\ncancer to being able to go after the\nHoly Grail of cancers which are what we\ncall the solid organ epithelial tumors\nrest pancreatic colon lung these are the\nbig cancers that do the majority of the\nkilling 50 percent of cancer deaths are\njust five cancers lung colon breast\nprostate pancreatic that's more than 50\npercent of all cancer deaths until you\nhave a solution for those we're not we\ndon't have a solution for cancer and I\ndo believe that we are really moving in\nthat direction we've touched on this\npoint a few times of almost the stress\nabout stress for health and and that's a\nreally interesting way of thinking about\nit it's like the stress of oh I need to\nwork out today the stress of I need to\nhave my supplements to the stress of I\ncan't sleep why am I not sleeping right\nlike we stress about the things that are\ngood for us\nhow have you helped your patients have\nyou coached them through that how do you\nguide people through that because I\nthink a lot of people go well then I'm\njust not going to do anything because at\nleast then I'm not stressed\nI don't think that's the wisdom in what\nyou're saying I don't think you're\nsaying well yeah it's better not to have\nany stress at all how do you help people\nto engage and you know use that stress\nin a healthy way or how do you guide\npatients through that stress I mean I\nthink every patient's different and I\nthink you have to sort of get to know\nthe person a little bit and figure out\nwhat what's the underlying issue so I do\nthink that there are a lot of people who\nfrankly self-sabotage going back to kind\nof like where I was I mean my\nself-destructive behaviors weren't\ncoming directly at the expense of my\nphysical health they were coming at the\nexpense of my emotional health but I\nactually think there were a lot of\npeople who have very similar stories to\nmine but their manifestation is it's\ncoming at the expense of their physical\nhealth they are sabotaging their ability\nthey they're coming up with a million\nexcuses why they can't eat well they\ncan't exercise they can't do this they\ncan't do that and so you have to be able\nto get to the root of the problem and so\nthere are many patients where we just\nthink look you're not going to get\nbetter without trauma-based therapy like\nuntil you come up with a way to care\nenough about yourself to stop punishing\nyourself in this way because I think\npeople punish themselves in different\nways you could almost argue I used to\npunish myself by overdoing all of those\nhealthy things like some of the exercise\nI was doing was actually a form of\npunishment so on the surface you'd say\nboy that guy's really healthy but no he\nwasn't another thing I always think\nabout is\nwhen we're in the spirit of trying to\nbuild new habits sometimes perfect is\nthe enemy of good typically what I want\nis a win and I think that what people\njust need is a win and it doesn't have\nto be the biggest win it just has to be\nOwen so if you're looking at a person\nfor whom nothing is optimal don't try to\nfix all things at once pick the one\nthing that you think they have the\ngreatest odds of being able to make a\ndifference on and just work on that and\naccept the fact that the other things\nwill continue to be sub-optimal but you\ndevelop their confidence in that one\nthing how about for 20 minutes a day you\ndo something active you go and walk for\n20 minutes a day if you're talking about\na person who's never lifted a finger\nthat would be a huge win and you might\ndo that before you get into the details\nof this type of training or that type of\ntraining or we're going to tweak your\nnutrition and optimize your protein\nintake I mean that's just overwhelming\nand you're probably just more likely to\nfail at everything and create kind of a\ncompensatory negative reaction but again\nI I don't think there's a pain by\nnumbers approach I think you in the way\nwe do it with patients I think you just\nhave to treat everybody individually and\nby the way when something's not working\nyou have to accept it and pivot and try\nsomething that is I think that's the\nkeyword pivot yeah that's the keyword\neveryone uh Peter the book is called\noutlive the science and odd of Longevity\nif you don't already have it please go\nand grab a copy uh I I highly recommend\nit of course today's conversation has\nbeen fantastic I've tried to touch on\ntopics that Peter may not have been\nasked about in a million different\ninterviews he's got fantastic interviews\nout there on so many awesome podcasts as\nwell so if you're more interested in the\nparts we didn't cover please do go and\nwatch those and get informed uh Peter\nit's been such a joy sitting down with\nyou today honestly there's been a\nmoments where I've been mind blown in\nmoments where I've been taken aback and\nfelt really you know in my body and\nreally present where my feet are and uh\nI'm just really grateful that we got to\nhave this conversation we got to share\nso much incredible insights with our\ncommunity today and I want you to make\nsure that you tag me and Peter on\nInstagram on tick tock on threads uh\nwith what you're learning what you've\ntaken away what are the things you're\ngoing to apply and practice with what's\nsomething you're going to experiment\nwith this week that would make me really\nhappy is that you just take one thing\naway from this and you're like I'm gonna\ntry that out I've got to figure this out\nfor myself that would be an awesome\nplace to start Peter we end every\nepisode with a final five a Fast Five so\nthese questions have to be answered in\none word to one sentence Max uh so Peter\nis here these are your final five or\nyour Fast Five the first question is\nwhat is the best health advice you've\never heard or received exercise every\nday second question what is the worst\nHealth advice you've ever heard or\nreceived do a cleanse ah interesting why\nthat's interesting yeah okay oh I just\nthink that you know I've seen I've seen\nsome of those things go really bad where\npeople you know get really mucked up and\ndehydrated and I've seen people actually\ntake in some chemicals and compounds\nthat dramatically alter liver function\ntests and things like that wow okay all\nright uh question number three what's\nsomething you're currently trying to\nunlearn continuing to work on\nperfectionism yeah unlearning or\ndetuning it uh question number four\nwhat's something that you're a very big\nproponent of but a lot of people may\ndisagree with you and you'll they're\nlike I'm not sure about it maybe the\nimportance of very heavy strength\ntraining in post-menopausal women\ninteresting let's dive into that because\nthat's that's fascinating I'm really\nyeah I have a specific you and that's\ngreat women post-menopause are so\nunbelievably susceptible to osteoporosis\nand osteopenia with the loss of estrogen\nunfortunately many any women in that\nsituation are not getting hormone\nreplacement therapy and so they're\ndoubly susceptible to it I think there's\njust a cultural belief that you know\nwomen don't need to lift weights and if\nthey do it's very light but the truth of\nit is you really need to lift heavy\nthings to make your bones stronger and\nthat doesn't mean it has to be\ncomplicated stuff like squats or\ndeadlifts or things like that but you\nknow one of the most important things is\ncarrying doing a farmer's carry so\nholding very heavy dumbbells in your\nhands and walking so important and it\ndoesn't matter how old you are got it\ngreat Fifth and final question if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\nyou must go into nature for at least an\nhour a day with no electronics and just\nbe just be outside be in nature but be\nuntethered to\nElectronics or obvious distractions\nbeautiful Peter that's fantastic thank\nyou so much again for your time your\nenergy your presence today I hope this\nis the first of many times that you'll\ncome back on on purpose and again if you\ndon't already follow Peter Peter where's\nthe best place you'd like be able to\nfind you I know you're on Instagram and\nYouTube and everywhere but yeah I think\neverything is Peter attia MD is all the\nhandles everywhere and uh yeah so thank\nyou very much I really appreciate this\nthank you if you love this episode\nyou'll enjoy my interview with Dr Daniel\nAmen on how to change your life by\nchanging your brain if we want a healthy\nmind it actually starts with a healthy\nbrain you know I've had the blessing or\nthe curse to scan over a thousand\nconvicted felons and over a hundred\nmurderers and their brains are very\ndamaged"
