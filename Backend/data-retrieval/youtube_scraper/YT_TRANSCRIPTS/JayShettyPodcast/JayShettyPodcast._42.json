Co a\nmuch buzzed about book The anxious\ngeneration is available now here's of\ncourse Jonathan height girls are\nextraordinarily anxious and depressed\nboys are extraordinarily undeveloped

a researcher a\nprofessor that I'm so excited to talk to\nI've been wanting to have this\nconversation with him about many of his\nbooks and we're finally here for his\nlatest installment it's called the\nanxious generation how the great\nrewiring of childhood is causing an\nepidemic of mental illness please\nwelcome to on purpose Jonathan height\nJonathan thank you for being here thank\nyou for making the time and spending\nthis energy with us oh my pleasure Jay\nthanks for having me this is a\nconversation that I feel as I was saying\nto you offline which is so critical and\nCentral for our listeners I know that\neveryone who's tuned in whether it be\nright now on YouTube or listening to us\non an audio platform this is of the\nnumber one concern in their life which\nis their personal mental well-being and\nthen the mental wellbeing of their\nchildren and the people that they care\nabout and love and I think when I first\nsaw the title The anxious\ngeneration I was thinking about how\nthere's this rhetoric that has become\nquite normal in society\naround how every generation has had\ntheir anxiety whether it was the world\nwars whether we talk about oh we have\nsocial media but you know kids back in\nthe day had black and white TVs and then\ncolor television and then then they had\nvideo games and so I feel like there's\nbeen this rhetoric that social media is\njust the latest installment in a host of\nprevious technologies that have made old\npeople worried about young people why is\nthis different uh so that is the main\ncounterargument I get is from people say\noh we've been through this before when I\nwas a kid we watched too much television\nbut look it didn't do anything to us um\nand it is true that ever since modernity\nbegan so beginning in the 17th century\nwhen the pace of change really begins to\naccelerate generation to generation the\nNext Generation actually is a little\ndifferent from the previous one and the\nand generally we think the Next\nGeneration they're kind of soft you know\nthey don't have our virtues um they have\nfunny habits so that's always been going\non and that's what I'm a late baby Bomer\nI was born in 1963 so that's what we\nthought about you know you know the\nmillennial generation you know oh\nthey're always just you know folks on\ntheir coffee and their and their avocado\ntoast they're not serious but actually\nand you're a millennial I believe right\nthat's correct so Millennials born 1981\nthrough 1995 roughly um but the\nMillennials their mental health was\nactually pretty good um better than Gen\nX actually and they're an amazingly\nsuccessful generation they were creative\nthey traveled the world they start\ncompanies so that's the normal interger\ndifference this time is really really\ndifferent because all of a sudden in\n2012 2013 it's like someone flicked on a\nlight switch and all over the developed\nworld we don't have data from the from\nthe developing world but all over the\ndeveloped World certainly the english-\nspeaking countries\nScandinavia girls in particular began to\nget depressed anxious they began to cut\nthemselves they began checking into\npsychiatric words in right around 2013\nin the US it's very sharp right around\n2013 it sometimes is little bit but it's\nbasically the early 2010s this has never\nhappened before there has never been a\nglobal synchronized collapse of mental\nhealth this is far larger than anything\nwe've ever seen in terms of its effects\non kids this is way way larger than\ncovid um this is affecting most kids so\nI'm engaged in debates with other\nScholars about well why did this happen\nand what I Marshall in the book is the\nevidence that it's not just a\ncoincidence it's not just a correlation\nthat oh that's exactly when kids\nbasically switch from flip phones to\nsmartphones it was between 2010 and 2015\nall over the world um but I'm showing\nthat there there's a lot of uh of\nexperimental evidence that shows\ncausation and another thing that makes\nthis different the kids themselves say\nit so when I was a kid we watched too\nmuch TV but you didn't see kids\norganizing to keep kids off TV you\ndidn't see kids saying oh please save us\nfrom TV you know we're stuck watching it\nwe don't want to be watching it but\nthat's what young people are saying\nabout social media I just saw a survey\nuh the majority the majority of people\nof of all ages including young people\nsay they would rather that Tik Tok was\nnever invented they're spending time on\nit because everyone else is but they see\nthat they're trapped so this is so\ndifferent from any previous moral Panic\nthat's so fascinating to hear that it's\nthe first time that people are actually\nsaying or kids are actually saying that\nthis experience is something that we're\nfeeling yet we feel so trapped addicted\nand exactly that's what my students say\nat NYU that's what students say on\nsurveys when you ask them why do you\nthink mental health is so bad in your\ngeneration the most common answer is\nsocial media they see it happening the\nparents see it happening to the kids the\nteachers see it happening to the kids so\nthere's all kinds of eyewitness\ntestimony like people see this happening\nit's not just like hm I wonder if it's\nthe phone like no we see the evidence of\nit what I'm fascinated why are people\ndebating you well there are so you know\nI'm an academic and we publish um our\narticles and journals and there are some\npeople who been studying media for a\nlong time and many of them are um very\ntechnophilic that they they you know\nthey like technology they some of them\nlike video games have been writing about\nthe benefits of video games and there\nare some and so I think they come to\nthis prepared to believe that this is\njust another moral Panic we've been\nthrough this with television and video\ngames and before that comic books the\n18th century it was novels people didn't\nwant young women to read novels because\nstimulate their sexual appetites so they\nsort of approach it with a like you know\nthis is just another one of those moral\npanics and then I keep doing this work\nwith Jee twangy and Zack Rous we keep\nshowing like no other explanation works\nthis time is different this is not just\nsome artifact of kids being more willing\nto talk about it this is you the same\nCurves in self-report you see those same\nCurves in Hospital admissions uh so and\npsychiatric emergency department busit\nso this is not just some illusion uh but\nyou know there's about four or five five\nor six researchers um you know they're\nserious researchers and they look at the\nsame data I do and they uh they say well\nthe the correlations are too small to\nexplain it or they say you know it's\nmostly correlational they're not enough\nexperiments and I say okay look I found\n25 experiments 16 of which do show a\ncausal effect you know with random\nassignment the kids who the young people\nwho are assigned to do less social media\num in the first few days maybe their\nmental health is bad because they're\naddicted but if you wait three or four\nweeks on average they feel better so I\nsay look here are all these experiments\nand they say well the experiments aren't\ngood enough here's a flaw in that one\nhere's a flaw in that one so this is a\nnormal academic debate not going to\nchange their minds ever they're not\ngoing to change my mind ever um this is\njust the way these things go but as we\nargue it out in public the rest of the\nworld can look and they can say what are\nmy arguments what are their arguments\nand then they'll decide yeah absolutely\nand from reading your book and your work\nwhat I understand is you actually I'm\nnot saying social media doesn't have\nbenefits either that's not\nreally what you're saying you're not\nsaying that there is no validity to it\nwell what I would say is for adults\nsocial media has many benefits so you\nknow obviously many people start their\nbusiness businesses look I use Twitter\nto get my research out so for adults so\nthink about this these are these were\nthese used to be called social\nnetworking sites because originally they\nwere just ways to connect people and as\nan adult I have a need to network and\nit's useful to me and Linkedin is useful\nTwitter is useful many you know Facebook\ngroups are use these are all useful for\nadults but let's talk about middle\nschool kids so in America Middle School\nis roughly ages 11 to 13 let's talk\nabout kids just beginning puberty\nhow much need do they have to network\nhow much do they need to meet strangers\nstrange men who are approaching them how\nmuch do they need that um how much do\nthey need social media to connect with\ntheir friends the telephone was an\namazing invention you pick it up you\npress some numbers and you can talk to\nyour friend anywhere in the country\nanywhere in the world so we already had\nthat how much more help did 11 and 12y\nolds need to connect with their friends\nand so I would argue that when we look\nat middle school this is my main focus\nis early puberty early puberty the brain\nis extremely vulnerable because the fr\nthe the fral part of the brain is\nrewiring very rapidly um growth is slow\nduring childhood but it's very rapid in\npuberty and so I would say that for 11\n12 13y old kids I'm willing to say there\naren't really any benefits and the harms\nare extraordinary so that's why I say we\nneed to just raise we need to raise the\nages we should have a norm that no one\ngets a smartphone before high school we\nshouldn't have kids with massive\nentertainment center in their pocket by\nwhich strangers can reach them companies\ncan reach them and we should raise the\nage of social media opening account from\n13 which is at present not enforced to\n16 and enforce it if we do those two\nthings we'll really get at least a\nhandle we'll protect kids during early\npuberty yeah and I want to get on to all\nof those points I think one thing before\nthat I think the word anxiety in some\ncases we've become so numb to it it's\nbecome so normalized it is the norm to\nhear someone you know as anxiety someone\nyou love as anxiety children have\nanxiety and I feel that word has been so\nrepeated over the last 5 to 10 years\nmaybe that it's become we've become numb\nto it and because of that we don't\nreally understand and which you do spend\na lot of time in the early parts of the\nbook not only defining what anxiety is\nan experience but the extent to which\nanxiety affects our normal everyday\nfunctioning could you give us a short\nsummary on that which I want people to\ndive into the book to read the Deep\nresearch on but could we at least\nexplore what are the implications what\nis anxiety and what are the implications\nof anxiety in the long term if not for\nsome of these recommendations you're\nsuggesting so the most important emotion\nfor Animals is fear fear is across all\nthe different species vertebrates and\nvertebrates there's a very you know huge\nlong Evolution a lot is known about fear\nbecause if you've ever been snorkeling\nor out in the woods you know that life\nfor Animals is you're looking for you're\nlooking for food and then you're dead\nbecause someone jumped on you so all\nanimals including us have a hair trigger\nalarm system that's normal that's\nhealthy uh so that's fear now sometimes\num that's when you're attacked you're\nthreatened now sometimes you're in an\nenvironment where you don't see a threat\nper se but it's you're very wary of it\nand so let's say you know so humans are\nmuch more afraid in the dark because in\nthe dark you're much more likely to be\nkilled by Nocturnal hunting animals so\nwe have an innate fear of the dark it\ndoesn't mean we're necessarily afraid\nbut we're just we're a little more on\nedge and so that's your brain saying\nokay we're going to shift the alarm\nsystem over we're going to make you a\nlittle warier if anything happens you're\ngoing to jump whereas if it was broad\ndaylight you would just look and say\nwhat was that um so our brains are these\nincredible survival machines that have\nvery very deep circuits for fear which\nmobilizes us to fight or to to flee or\nfight um and then for anxiety which is\nmore diffus just a general sense of\nthreats now when the fear system is\ntriggered and then you take action and\nthen it shuts off that's normal that's\nhealthy but as many of your listeners\nwill know chronic stress causes an\nincrease in circulating cortisol it\nkeeps your stress system on stress is\nnot bad kids need stress but short-term\nstress but when you have long-term\nstress now you have hormonal\ndisregulation you have cortisol which\nhas many functions in the body but high\nlevels of cortisol expose you to all\nkinds of health problems joint problems\nimmunity I mean I forget the whole list\ncortisol has so many effects um so\nwhat's happening is um young people\nthere have always been anxious young\npeople some people are set to anxious\nsome people are set to more calm that's\nalways been the case but there's a shift\nso that more and more kids are are\ncloser to the anxiety side now um part\nof this is they're told there's a lot of\ntalk actually just this week or two\nthere's a lot of talk about how these\nprograms that teach kids to label their\nemotions and they talk about you know\nwere you afraid were you anxious they\nseem like they're well-intentioned it\nseems you know social emotional learning\nthere is some basis to that decades ago\nbut it seems though it's moving in a\ndirection of teaching kids to dwell on\ntheir own emotions always be looking\ninward how did that make you feel how\ndid that make were you anxious um you\nknow what you know where can you go for\nhelp um that this there's actually not\nmuch evidence that this is helping and\nthere's some new studies suggesting that\nthis stuff backfires this is actually\nmaking kids more anxious what kids what\nI argue in the book is what kids really\nreally need to overcome anxiety is\nexposure go out and play and sometimes\nyou will be afraid and sometimes you'll\nclimb a tree and you'll be go too high\nand you're afraid I remember those\nfeelings from my childhood but that's\nhow you get over childhood anxieties\nwhere sitting inside in a classroom with\nthe teacher giving you an emotion Circle\nand saying which of these emotions are\nyou feeling right now Johnny you know\nand and sometimes they're asked have you\nthought about suicide\nhave you thought about harming yourself\nand they ask this over and over again so\nthis suggests to kids that they are weak\nthat they have these emotions and if\nthey have these emotions it's a problem\nso I think we're you know the Mental\nHealth\nCommunity um you know I think we're just\nwe're not we're not recognizing what's\ndriving the epidemic and we're not doing\nthings that would effectively reverse it\nwhat is the root of that because I feel\nlike the research oscillates in some\ncases or at least as humans we like to\noscillate there's this idea of the past\nand I assume it's the opposite of what\nyou just said where when you were young\nyou weren't allowed to feel I think\neveryone's experienced that idea of oh\ndon't worry everything will be okay or\noh it it doesn't matter that you feel\npain like everything will be fine let\nLet It Go or you know don't cry or\nthings like that and so that was one\nextreme and then the other extreme is\nwhat you're saying now where it's like\nwell let's talk about every emotion and\ngive it equal waiting and give it equal\npriority what what is the middle and\nyeah so um so I'm saying kid need\nadversity they need to sometimes be\nexcluded so all of that is necessary you\nknow if you if you ask any parent how\nmany times would you like your child to\nbe excluded you just have a newborn\nchild your child's going to turn 18 and\n18 years in those 18 years how often do\nyou want your child to be excluded and\nto feel excluded and anybody who says\nzero they're speaking from their heart\nbut they're not speaking from their head\nI would never hire someone who's never\nbeen excluded this person is going to be\nhave it very difficult to have normal\nhuman relationships sometimes they won't\nbe included and that's not a big deal U\nso we need adversity now I think what\nyou're saying is it used to be we were\ntoo insensitive and that's true uh and\nthere were a couple of categories\nespecially so bullying bullying is\nreally really bad but what we have to be\nclear about is bullying is not\naggression bullying is aggression or\nhumiliation directed at a kid day after\nday it has to be over time because\naggression is a normal and necessary\npart of childhood you have to let kids\nexperience aggression Express aggression\nExpress hostility you have to allow that\nand let them work it out now now and\nthen there will be a problem there'll be\none kid who is picking on another kid\nand that kid doesn't want to go to\nschool and if that goes on for more than\na day now it's bullying and now we need\nto be responsive and I was a kid we\nweren't in the 70s that we weren't um\nand in some countries I know at the time\nyou know in Japan and Korea there were\nhorrible I mean the culture around\nbullying and English boarding schools\nI've heard so it's great progress that\nwe're being more senstive about bullying\num obviously the shaming of LGBT TQ kids\nthat was a that was constant when I was\na kid um but now it's much much better\nso so in many ways we do need to be more\nsensitive but I think the gist of your\nquestion is have we overshot have we and\nI would say yes we have really overshot\num you know if if there's any you know\nrecess in America is often very heavily\nmonitored and as soon as there's any\nkind of conflict an adult comes in when\nmy kids my kids went to New York City\nPublic Schools they go there still\nthey're in high school um and so that\nkind of attention to let's make sure no\none's upset let's make sure no one's\nexcluded you know my daughter and her\nfriend they formed a little Club but\nthey were you know on the playground\nthey were told no you can't do that you\ncan't exclude anyone that's crazy kids\nneed to play with that so anyway that's\nthe I think we've gone too far yeah\ntalking about recess I believe it was in\nyour book that you said that the average\nrecess time or outdoor time is 37\nminutes is that the numbers vary it\ndepends on the but in elementary school\nI've heard numbers as low as 27 minutes\nas the average average yeah across the\nday and sometimes that's combined with\nlunch some kids only get 25 minutes\nincluding lunch and so you go you know\nyou're in you know kids need to run\naround they need recess there's a lot of\nresearch on this play helps them learn\nhelps them attend later but in America\nat least and in East Asian countries I\nwould imagine um we're so focused on on\non test scores on that we think what\nfive and six and seven year olds is more\nneed is more math and they don't they\ndon't need more math what they need is\nmore playtime and then they'll learn\nmore in a shorter amount of math um in\nthe States if you are in a federal\nmaximum security\npenitentiary you are guaranteed two\nhours a day of yard time you can't keep\nit's in inhumane to keep them in in\ntheir cells all day two hours of yard\ntime but if you're an elementary school\nstudent in the United States you have no\nguarantee and it's it's very often as\nlittle as 27 minutes including lunch\nwhich means you have to stand in the\nlunch line that takes 10 minutes you get\nyour lunch you have you know you wolf it\ndown in 5 minutes you have whatever 5\nminutes left to play this is complete\nInsanity\nif we want to get a handle in the Mental\nHealth crisis I think we need to back\noff on the adults instructing kids about\ntheir emotions do a lot less of that and\ntake all the money and all the time\nwe're spending on that and give kids\nmore play and what do what do we need\nyou talk about what we need as children\nyou're talking about the need for play\nis play truly just play or is there\ncertain parameters certain ideas certain\nthoughts that make play more effective\nyes play is a mamalian universal so\nmammals you know the first mammals\nwhenever it was that some females began\nto secrete milk from glands in their\nskin it's kind of an amazing\nevolutionary adaptation for having a\nlonger childhood you know other animals\nthey lay an egg and that's it animals on\ntheir own but mammals we have this long\nlong childhood and that allows us to\nhave much larger brains and much more\ncomplex social behavior compared to say\nreptiles and so we have this long\nchildhood um and especially the social\nanimals dogs more than cats but you know\ndogs and humans and are incredibly\nplayful creatures we have a puppy at\nhome she's now a year and a well year\nand a half she still looks like a puppy\nshe wants to play all the time and she\nhas to play that's the thing since all\nmammals play when they're young and they\ntake risks so Evolution isn't stupid\nEvolution didn't say we're going to let\nthese these baby animals practice\njumping out of trees and practice\ngetting in fights for no good reason no\nthere's a very good reason that's what\nyou have to do to train your brain to\nreach adulthood and that's why for\nhundreds of thousands of years millions\nof years you could say all human\nchildren played unless they were being\nseriously deprived of play and stuck in\na factory so we in America we had play\nall the way up through the 1990s that's\nwhen we begin to lose it in the '90s we\nfreak out in America and Britain and\nCanada uh and we say it's too dangerous\nyou'll be abducted you'll be sexually\nmolested no you stay home or you stay\nunder supervision oh and there's this\nfabulous new internet so why don't you\nspend more time on that that's what\nhappened in the '90s and that's when\nchildhood really departed from the human\nneed for play and independent activity\nand became over supervised helicopter\nparented uh restrained restricted and\nyou can play on a video game in a way\nbut it's not embodied whereas we're\nphysical creatures we need to run jump\ntouch wrestle hug uh you know I remember\ndoing all those things with my with my\nfriends when I was in second or third\ngrade we would sometimes hug each other\nor pick each other up or wrest Soul you\nknow it's children are physical like\npuppies but but now you know kids\nthey're on their screen all the time\nthere can be a playful element but\nthere's no risk there's no physicality\num they don't learn the social skills\nthat you do from face- Toof face\nencounters when you were saying that I\nwas actually thinking back to a trip I\ntook to Rwanda two years ago and I was\nthinking about our our gorilla friends\nwho we share I believe over 96% of our\nDNA with and watching the young gorillas\nplay outdoors and you when you talking\nabout wrestling and and we so\nrecognizable that's right yeah and it\nwas such a like cuz we're primates\nprimates have arms and primates use\ntheir arms in play and you see it with\nall you know with chimpanzees and\nbonobos and gorillas yeah and it's so\ncute right like we love watching it\nbecause we mammals as adults we are\nprimed for cuteness because that\ntriggers in us a protective Instinct\nover the kids so we have this protective\nInstinct and un unfortunately it's kind\nof run rampant you know it used to be\nthe kids are out of the house you don't\nsee them but now we can monitor kids all\nthe time and we're just we're swooping\nin too quick yeah no I I mean I think we\nall resonate with that even as adults\nthere's this beautiful quote from George\nburnard Shaw where he said\nthat we don't stop playing because we\nget old we get old because we stop\nplaying beautiful yes that's right and\nand I think that we can relate to that I\ncan relate to the this idea that I miss\nplay I think the challenge is that as\nyou said in the 1990s when things\nstarted to Veer off course now children\ngiven the choice generally are going to\nchoose indoor video games phone time\niPad and they're not going to choose\nplay so I think the challenge becomes\nnow that our taste buds have become\ntechnological how do we rewire that\ntaste bud when we've been so diverted\nthat's right so it's not clear whether\nit's that the taste buds have become\ntechnological or that the technology has\nadapted so profoundly that it now knows\nexactly what we most want so uh I was\nborn in 1963 I remember when the game\npong came out it was the first video\ngame you could get on your home\ntelevision so it was very very crude but\nit's amazing you turn a knob and you can\nplay tennis and I'd sit there with my\nfriend and we'd do that for you know 20\n30 minutes and we' go do something else\num so these video games were not\nimmersive they were fun and and you\nplayed with a friend\num but once you get you know you get\ngraphics cards you get color monitors\nyou get high-speed internet you get\nmultiplayer video games these games are\nincredible I mean my son plays fortnite\nI didn't let him on in sixth grade when\nhe was 11 but I did let him on 13 around\ncovid time um these games are incredible\nand as a boy what's most exciting is war\ngames and so the games just get better\nand better and and this is actually\nsomething we we need to talk about you\nknow so much of the talk about social\nmedia and girls with boys it's a\ndifferent problem boys there are many\nthat are harmed by social media many are\ndriven to Suicide I don't want to say\nit's okay for boys but social media use\nis not so correlated with depression and\nanxiety for boys it is for girls for\nboys what's happening is the technology\nis so amazing and the real world is\ngetting more and more inhospitable to\nthem I mean we've been really trying to\nreduce prejudice against girls and open\nup girls and bring them into every\nthat's all great but girls are just so\nmuch better in school they just do\nbetter in school they school is made for\nmore of a a female child than a male\nchild it's for you sit still you learn\nyou please the teacher um and we've we\npushed Out rough and tumble play we've\nreduced recess there's no more shop\nclass so boys aren't enjoying school as\nmuch as girls um boys um are enjoying\nthe technology more and more and it's\nnot just the video games it's also the\npornography um so you know war games and\nsex those are deeply appealing to boys\nand young men and as the technology gets\nbetter and better now you know if you're\na boy with buding sexual urges and you\nhave two choices one is the most\nincredible pornography you've ever seen\nand then soon there'll be goggles soon\nit'll be put into into sex dolls and\nrobots I mean you can have this amazing\nsex life that you can customize you can\ncustomize the body size you can\ncustomize the personality you know you\ncan have virtual girlfriends and\nboyfriends now so boys are finding uh uh\nvideo game play and pornography more and\nmore satisfying and it's just difficult\nto arrange a soccer game with your\nfriends that's just difficult let's just\nmeet online and it's difficult to flirt\nwith a girl and develop a relationship\nand fall in love and have sex that's\nreally hard um so I think we're losing\nboys um it's not just because their\ntaste buds are rewired it's because the\ntechnology is amazingly good at learning\nwhat do we most want let's deliver that\nbut it's not what we most need it's what\nwe most want and what's the cost of that\nwhat's happening to boys brains and\nMinds so the big picture is that boys\nare failing to have the kinds of\nexperiences that will toughen them teach\nthem skills teach them virtues and turn\nthem into men um boys development is\ndifferent from girls development all\naround the world traditionally um boys\ngenerally initiation rights involve more\ntoughening toughness demonstrations and\nwe can say this is terrible and\npatriarchal but I actually think it's\nimportant um so you know all kids start\noff in the female sphere we all live we\nknow we're all raised by mothers and\ngirls and aunts traditionally around the\nworld um and so girls stay within the\nfemale world and girls initiation rights\nare usually pegged to puberty to\nmenstruation and then they're taught all\nthe secrets of of being a woman all that\nboys have to make the transition from\nthe girl the women's world into the\nmen's World and less so today I'm not\nsaying it needs to be this way I'm just\nsaying it generally is to some extent\nboy development is different from girls\ndevelopment and boys um if you give them\nthe easy way out all the time the many\nof them will take it and then they don't\nthey don't grow they don't toughen and\nso I think what we're seeing now is is a\ngeneration jenz born after 1996 and\nlater in which the girls are\nextraordinarily anxious and depressed\nmuch more so than the boys um but the\nboys are extraordinarily undeveloped\nmany people say they have no social\nskills they don't look you in the eye um\nthey don't know how to behave in public\nthey certainly don't know how to talk to\ngirl so I think we're seeing just a\nmassive massive blockage of development\nand you know jenzie the oldest St 28\nwe'll see um we'll see if they come out\nof it but when the Millennials were 28\nthey had already invented so many\ncompanies they were inventing\nTechnologies I mean the Millennials by\n28 they were like you know a meteor\nstreaking across the sky and gen Z seems\nmuch more to be hunkered down like you\nknow talking about their anxiety so I'm\nnot blaming them at at all um it's not\ntheir fault we deprive them of play we\nput touch screens in their hands then\nthey had the bad luck to you know\nbasically come out of college the eldest\nof them right into covid so those in\ntheir 20s now their work experience was\ntruncated what they need is mentoring in\na real office or a real job and they\ndidn't get it so again I'm not blaming\nbut man we have to have a lot of\nsympathy and we have to make sure this\nstops we have to stop this right now and\nI think that's the challenge right A lot\nof people say well people are going to\nhave virtual girlfriends and we are\ngoing to live in the the virtual world\nand everyone's going to go home and put\ntheir headset on and you know disapp\ndisappear into the abyss and then we'll\nbe wearing it all day not just in the\nevenings and so there's that belief\nsystem that actually we're just getting\nbetter at using the technology that\nwould define our future success anyway\nor future failure if we don't know it\nbut you're saying that there's just what\nwhat are the I guess the harsher\nimplications of what does this look like\nin 20 time okay so I'm very influenced\nby by one of the puzzles that I first\ntried to deal with is why you know what\nmade jenz why because when I started\nthis work when I started writing the\nking of the American mind with Greg\nlukianov we first wrote an article in\n2015 in the Atlantic and we thought\ncollege students were Millennials the\nyou know the millennial generation\nstarted in 1981 and you it was expected\nto be if you're born all the way up\nthrough 2000 you're a millennial that's\nwhat we thought um but then jeene twangy\ncame out with her book I Jen and her\nresearch showing that kids born around\n1996 and later are very different much\nhigher rates of mental illness and so\nwhen you look at the millennial\ngeneration their mental health is\nactually pretty good you know the\nyoungest Millennials are a little bit\nmore like Jen Z but for the most part\nthe Millennials mental health is\nfine they made it through puberty before\nthey got their first smartphone and\nsocial media account so if you didn't\nget a so you know Millennials like a lot\nof them got you know Facebook when they\nwere in college in fact originally\nFacebook was only for college students\nyou had to be in college to get\nFacebook so what we see in the data is\nthat if you didn't get a smartphone in\nsocial media until you were 18 or older\nyour mental health is fine now you know\nlet's say you're 35y old right now you\nmight feel overwhelmed you might feel\nthat this thing is stressing you out but\nyou had normal brain development you had\nyou you us technology when you were a\nkid you had a flip phone you used it to\nconnect with other kids you used it to\nyou know youd have to text and it was\nhard to text and you had to use your\nthumbs and press number keys\nbut you use the technology as a tool to\nhelp you meet up with your friends or\nmaybe you called them on the phone that\nwas it that's all your phone could do\nbut if you got a smartphone in social\nmedia at the start of puberty which is\nwhat almost all kids do now um that\nmeans you're going through puberty on\nsocial media and with a with a massive\nentertain with a supercomputer and a\nentertainment system in your pocket with\nyou all the time so my point is this if\nwe can protect childhood and let kids\nget through puberty and then we give\nthem the goggles and the virtual\ngirlfriends and everything else their\nlives are still going to be kind of\nmessed up by this stuff but at least\ntheir brains matured and they're\nprobably not going to be depressed and\nanxious for life if we if we keep giving\nit you know it used to be at you know\n1011 is when kids get their first\nsmartphone now it's more it's going down\nto five or six um if we keep giving\nlittle children a touchscreen device\nincluding an iPad and and using it as a\nbabysitter and saying oh yeah yeah you\njust you know here here's here's your\ndevice I'm busy I'm doing email I'm\ncooking here's your device\nif we keep doing that um we're not our\nbrains are not going to adapt to that\nchildren's brains are not going to\nsomehow evolve so that that becomes okay\nit's not going to be okay yeah and it's\nit's it's such a harsh reality but it's\ntrue that people have less time we have\nless we are doing so much more it seems\nwe are living further away from family\nthere's so many reasons why the iPad is\nbecoming the babysitter that feels\nvalidated because we're not living in\nbigger family spaces we don't have the\nsupport of our neighbors we don't have\nwe don't have the resources or the funds\nto have a a paid babysitter or whatever\nit may be so there's so many almost\nvalid reasons for why we even say take\nthe iPad no that's right again you know\nin my book I have almost no really no\ncriticism for parents yeah and some\npeople say you know why don't it's the\nparents responsibility it's their fault\nwhy aren't you blaming the parents to\nwhich my answer is you know I'm a parent\nI know a lot of parents a lot of us are\nreally trying and it's really hard I\nmean the technological environment now\nis such that you know if you don't give\nyour kid a smartphone she's left out and\nshe you know says Dad I'm the only one\nI'm left out so parents are trying and\nas a social psychologist who studies\nmorality I know that if one person does\nsomething that seems evil well maybe\nthey're maybe they're evil but if an\nentire society and if an entire planet\nchanges at the same time in the same way\nit's not individual's fault and so if\nparenting changed certainly across the\nenglish- speaking World um we can't\nblame the parents for that there must be\nsome reason why we all freaked out and\nbegan\noverprotecting um so yeah I don't I\ndon't blame I don't blame the parents I\nsay we're stuck in systemic problems and\nI'm proposing Norms by which we can\nescape and I think anyone when I've been\nmentioning you were coming on the on the\nshow I was talking to people about your\nwork and I was talking about your\nrecommendations of no social media\nbefore 16 no phones before 14 and I\ndon't think there's any adult that I\nspoke to that had any debate with either\nof those I think everyone looked to me\nyou know I'm talking to everyone 25 and\nup but anyone that I talked to 25 and up\nwent that makes perfect sense I think\nthat's a great idea and what a brilliant\nrecommendation like when when do we get\nstarted like that's right that's right\npeople are ready to get started because\neveryone sees it everyone's sick of it\nyeah and and obviously in the book you\nhold you say here's what governments can\ndo here's what technology companies can\ndo here's what schools can do I think my\nquestion is and I know you've talked\nabout what they can do in so many other\nplaces which is fantastic my question is\nhow do we actually get that to be a\nreality like what does it actually take\nto change Norms because I was trying to\nthink and and I'd love your take on this\nlike when was the last time we tried to\ndo that in any sphere of life and how\ndid it go and and where did it work and\nwhere did it fail so we have a lot of\nexperience with Norm changes so one of\nthe clearest is smoking it took 20 or 30\nyears uh when I was in high school in\nthe 70s um you know a bunch of kids\nsmoked most of us didn't but a bunch of\nof high school kids smoked you know age\nyou know 15 16 17\nand beginning in the ' 80s or 90s there\nwas an anti-tobacco campaign and it took\na few decades um but the rates of\nsmoking are very very low now now\nthere's vaping kids moved on to vaping\nwhich is bad but not as bad as smoking\num Norms around lgbtq and shaming and\nbullying and using racial slurs these\nNorms have changed radically in the last\n20 or 30 years so Norm change normally\nhappens over the space of a few decades\nand we have many many examples there's\nwe've been studied so some things get\nmore moralized like smoking is now seen\nas evil whereas homosexuality which used\nto be seen as evil is now seen as\nperfectly okay so Norms change over the\ncourse of decades what's happening now\nis very different what's happening now\nthe digital world has put us into an\nenvironment in which things can spread\nwithin minutes I mean this has never\nhappened in human history um Norms can\nspread around the world in days not\nNorms but ideas or memes can spread\naround the world in in days and what\nthat means means that Norms can change\nvery quickly too and so all over the\nworld all over the developed world uh in\n2010 kids had flip phones no social no\nsocial media on their phones in 2015 we\nhave now the phone based childhood all\nover the world kids are behaving the\nsame way so that H that changed very\nquickly and that put pressure on\neveryone else to do the same thing okay\nso we're stuck in this Collective action\nproblem that emerg very very\nquickly but by the same token we can\nescape very very quickly because\nWherever I Go the main counterargument I\nget is parents who say h you know it's\njust it's too late the trains left the\nstation what are we going to do this is\nthe way of the future so resignation is\nreally the only obstacle I'm\nfacing but most parents so many parents\nare upset by this that they're ready to\nact if only some way can be found to\ncoordinate them so in the UK I just got\nback from London a few days ago in the\nUK the parents Revolution started in\nFebruary um a couple of mothers Daisy uh\nGreenwell and CLA Reynolds they just put\nup um on a Instagram post they put up\nthat they started a WhatsApp group for\nparents who wanted a smartphone fore\nchildhood they were going to delay\ngiving their kids smartphones and like\novernight tens of thousands of of\nBritish parents signed up there's a\nlimit on WhatsApp groups they had to\nform local they had to form hundreds of\nWhatsApp groups it spread like wildfire\nand what I'm finding I've been involved\nin a lot of efforts to change ideas and\nNorms it's very hard takes decades on\nthis one I don't have to convince anyone\non this one it's like everyone's ready\nto act they just need to know what to do\num and so you know I'm proposing these\nfour simple Norms as you said the two\nthat I would add that I add uh that we\nhaven't mentioned are phone- free\nschools we must keep the phones out of\nschool there's lock them up as soon as\nyou come in that should be doable that\nis doable this can be done by September\nyeah and the fourth is give far more\nfree play and Independence in the real\nworld that's the hardest one actually\nbut that's incredibly important so let\nme actually just take advantage I'm\nactually very excited you have this\ngigantic Global a I was about to ask my\nnext question how can we help what can\nwe do because I I want to be a part of\nthe mission great great so so here's\nwhat I can say uh first let me just give\na little background which is is this\njust happening in the United States no\num uh if if listener if you so all over\nthe world please go to after babble.com\nafter Babel that's my substack it's free\nnothing's behind a pay wall uh that's\nwhere we're putting our research out um\nand you'll find articles there uh we\nhave one post on on how the the mental\nhealth epidemic is hitting all the\nanglosphere countries and so this so\nZack Rous this was his first\nInternational Post we've gathered all\nthe mental health data we can from\naround the world most countries don't\nhave any but the developed countries\noften do um so we can show that the same\nthing is happening at the same time in\nall the Anglo countries and then he\nmoved on to Scandinavia same thing's\nhappening at the same time in the\nScandinavian countries now that's very\ninteresting because I just had an\ninterview with a Finnish journalist this\nmorning and she said you know in Finland\nwe let our kids out like our kids at 78\nthey're out playing but even still she\nsays they go outside to play and they\nsit down and they're on their phone\nbecause they all have phones from the\nage of you know six or seven so so this\nis happening all over the developed\nWorld um I in Europe Zach has a post on\nthe rest of Europe it's especially\nNorthern Europe it's a little less so in\nEastern Europe and southern Europe so\nfirst there is variation around the\nworld in mental health that that is\ndefinitely important but what I'm\nfinding is parents everywhere are seeing\ntheir kids not playing they're seeing\nthem sit on their phones at recess in in\ncountries where the kids can have a\nphone in their pocket at recess the kids\nare often sitting down on their phones\nthey're not running around and yelling\nand laughing so wherever you are in the\nworld figure out you know figure out\nwhether you have this problem you\nprobably do that your kids even if\nthey're not depressed they're missing\nmost of childhood they're missing\nAdventure they're probably have fewer\nHobbies they probably don't read books\nthey probably don't spend much time with\nother people so this is going to\ninfluence them in a bad way around the\nworld um and then start talking to other\nparents um the simplest thing most of us\nare on a text thread with the parents of\nour kids friends because you had to\narrange for the oh this birthday party\nokay I'll pick them up and you know so\nwe're all in contact with the parents of\nour kids friends just start with that\nsay do you know do you see this problem\nare you concerned and especially if you\nhave younger kids you can delay when you\nknow you can delay when you give your\nkid a smartphone if your kids friends\nare in the same boat then it's not hard\nthat's the point of this Collective get\ngetting out of the collective action\nproblem um I would also urge um anyone\naround the world bring up the subject of\nphone-free schools if your child so a\nnumber of countries France um\nAustralia um a few countries have and\nBritain um just have guidance that\nschools must go phone free they must\neither you know lock them up or lock up\nthe phones in a lock special Locker and\na Yonder pouch a lockable pouch um but\nif your country doesn't do that start\nadvocating for it if you go to anxious\ngeneration.com that's the website for\nthe book we have a whole research Page\nlook at that send that to people I have\nall kinds of talks I've given on YouTube\nyou can find my YouTube channel lectures\nabout why we need to go phone free so\nthat's right that's the thing we can do\nthis year we can do it in 2024 is make\nall our schools phone free and that will\nallow our children to learn more because\nwhen there's sitting in class they don't\nhave the world's greatest entertainment\ncenter in their hand ridiculous and\nthey're not texting and they're not\nbullying each other and they're not\ndoing Tik Tok challenge they're actually\nlistening to the teacher or passing\nnotes with other kids which is fine\nthey're interacting with other kids\nthat's actually okay with me why haven't\nschool's done it already I I feel like\nit's a because a few parents complain in\nthe United States the only problem the\nonly reason they don't do it is that\nAmerican parents are so overprotective\nmany not all so overprotective and\nthey've gotten so used to being able to\ntext their kids throughout the day so it\ncould be you know hey Johnny how did you\nhow did your math test go and they might\neven te text that during the math test\nand the kid checks his phone during the\nmath test um you know or oh I'm going to\nbe late for pickup like okay do the kid\nneed to know that during English class\nlike why not just you know let when when\nhe gets his phone back he can see okay\nyou'll be late for pickup um and in\nAmerica we have the problem that because\nwe do have school shooting now they're\nextremely rare but they're happening\nmore so some parents think oh if there's\na school shooting I want to be able to\ntalk to my child and this is a huge\nmistake because if there actually was a\nshooter on a school campus what you want\nis the kids to follow directions and do\nwhat they were trained to do you don't\nwant every kid pulling out their phone\nand crying to Mom and Dad so I've spoken\nto many principles or or heads of school\nand I asked them why don't you B you\nknow ban the phones and they always say\nthe same thing there' be a riot among\nthe parents well only among some parents\nand so if you're listening to this\npodcast you kids in school talk to the\nhead of school and say no I want my kid\nto be in a phone free school I want my\nkid to listen to the teacher and to\ninteract with other kids so that's\nsomething we can all do right away and\ndo you have resources on how to have\nthat conversation effectively okay\nbrilliant I do so at anxious\ngeneration.com we do have some you go to\nresources or take action and then\nthere's a tab for parents there are also\ntwo organizations in the United States\nthere's smartphone free\nschools.org and smartphone free schools\nmovement.org so we have two different\norganizations that are they show you\nhere's a sample letter that you can send\nhere's what you can do um in the UK\nthere's smarton prech childhood. co.uk\nSo within a number of countries there\nare already movements but you know what\nyou can just use the resources from The\nAmerican or the British one um and you\nknow what this Global audience start\nyour own um come to anxious\ngeneration.com we have a list of aligned\norganizations mostly in the US and the\nUK but there are a couple in Canada\nthere's I think one in Germany there's\none in somewhere in Latin America so\npeople are starting these parents are\nrising up all around the world let's\njoin them let's talk about before we\ndive into spirituality because I was\ncurious to see you had a chapter\ndedicated to that inside the book talk\nto me about the difference in girls and\ntheir use of social media versus boys\nbecause like you said and I'm glad we\ntalked about young boys because often\nthey can get forgotten in the\nconversation but let's talk a bit about\nyoung girls and how social media is\nhaving a far more adverse effect on\ntheir Mental Health First the evidence\nof a link is just very clear for girls\num with girls their mental health was\nvery stable until 2012 and then in 2013\nit starts Rising it really is a light\nswitch for boys it's not so sharp it's\nmore gradual um secondly um the\ncorrelations for girls are much higher\nthe correlation between time spent on\nsocial media and mental health problems\nso for girls the evidence is much\nclearer now why why the connection um in\nthe book I go into the psychology of of\nmotivation and there are two categories\nof motivation they're very important to\nunderstand agency and communion so\nagency is the desire to be an agent to\nmake things happen you know when I was a\nkid it was so exciting to take a BB gun\nand shoot at tin cans because I pull a\ntrigger and the thing Falls over it's\nit's an incredible thrill so that's\nagency making things happen um communion\nis connection being with friends bonding\nsharing stories sharing emotions I\nreally enjoyed that too everyone has\nboth motives on average on average boys\nand men are have a little bit more on\nthe agency side it matters more to them\nwhen you let them choose what to do\nthey're going to go out they're going to\nbuild a tower and then knock it over my\nfriends and I used to build model\nairplanes like World War II fighter jets\nthen we'd we'd put like rubbing alcohol\nin them and then we'd light them on fire\nlike that was really fun to do so that's\nagency making things happen communion is\nconnection girls if you let kids play\nthe girls are much more likely to sit\nand talk they want to connect and what\nare they talking about other girls\nthey're talking about relationships\nthey're developing their mental map of\nspace so girls are a little more\nsophisticated about social relationships\nthey think more about them they share\nemotions more and that's a strength\nthat's that's something that that's why\nwomen excel in certain professions uh\nand Men excel in other professions um\nbut the differences aren't so much how\ngood they are they're what they enjoy\ndoing and so when the companies come\nalong and they say hey do you want to\nsee what everyone's doing do you want to\nsee what everyone's saying do you want\nto see what they are saying about you\nthis is like catnip for girls this is\nthis is they really Target the girls\ninsecurities and they get girls to come\non and then there's drama which brings\nmore girls on um now boys are affected\nby this too but it's it's not it's just\nnot as alluring and if you give so when\neveryone gets multiple screens you know\nby 2010 2011 and the iPad comes out\nmultiplayer video games everyone is\ntempted by screens the boys go rushing\ninto multiplayer video games and porn\nthey do a lot more of that the girls go\nrushing for Instagram Pinterest Tumblr\nespecially the the visual platforms okay\nso now why is this so bad for girls and\nI go through I think five reasons in the\nbook uh so one is just the social\ncomparison girls are always judged more\non their looks I just came across a\nquote from epicus I read stoic writings\nin the mornings epicus commented in\nancient Rome about how when they turn 14\ngirls are are are judged as sexual\npartners and they focus they're made to\nfocus too much on their look and you\nknow this is a sad thing that these\ngirls are are are just becoming focused\non their looks what's happening now\nbecause girls it's constant social\ncomparison with other girls who get\npraised for being not just beautiful but\nsexy so whether they know it or not\nThey're copying porn star type poses\nporn star type looks they're being\nhypersexualized massive social\ncomparison and on average they don't\nmeasure up because if if everyone on\nInstagram is actually appears much more\nbeautiful than in real life well then\neveryone else is below average so the\nsocial comparison hurts girls more than\nboys um the nature of aggression is such\nthat boys aggression is more physical\nand it's ultimately about who can\ndominate who who can beat up who if it\ncame to that girls aggression girls are\njust as aggressive but it's different\ngirls aggression historically and across\ncultures and even across species um is\nmore relational girls will damage\nanother girl's reputation or\nrelationships and boy does social media\nallow them to do that anonymous ly and\non the weekends too it used to be that\ngirls were safe from bullying on the\nweekends but because they're out of\nschool but now they're not so and then\nthere's the sexual predation you know\nthere are sexual predators that are\ngoing for boys but if you're a boy on\nthe internet you're not being constantly\nsexually proposition by older men I mean\nit happens but it's not that common if\nyou're a girl on the\ninternet we just published an article\nfrom Antonio bear who was a Facebook\nwhistleblower and his research within\nFacebook within Instagram actually was\nthat 13% % of teenagers 13 to 15 year\nold\nteenagers had gotten some sort of a\nsexual proposition or someone coming on\nto them a stranger coming on to them in\nthe past week in the past week\n133% so if you're a girl online it's\njust you're just living among Predators\nyou're like you know the animals we\ntalked about before in the Woods After\nDark you're more frightened so for all\nthese reasons when kids shifted from a\nplay-based childhood to a phone based\nchildhood it was more devastating for\nthe girls VI and I were talking about\nthis yesterday what's your take on uh he\nwas he was suggesting this idea of\neveryone on social media being verified\noh yeah having to be verified what would\nbe your take on that oh my god of course\nthat has to happen so think about it you\nknow we're in America we're afraid to\nlet our kids out in part because we\nthink they'll be abducted there'll be a\nstranger hanging out by the playground\nluring them into a car and that has\nhappened in America it's very very rare\nthere's only about 100 150 cases of true\nkidnapping by Str in this country every\nyear so it's extremely rare but it does\nhappen we're very afraid of strangers\napproaching our\nchildren um but guess what the strangers\nare not at the playground anymore\nthey've moved to\nInstagram okay so the idea that we're\ngoing to put our kids on platforms where\nstrange men can reach them flirt with\nthem say that they're a 12-year-old boy\nor 15-year-old boy exchange fake photos\nincluding a photo of your daughter in a\nbathing suit or less this is complete\nInsanity um I don't think we should be\nhaving children interacting with\ncomplete strangers um the sextortion\nRings now it used to be just 10 or\n20,000 a year reported um in in the\nUnited States it's way more now there's\na Nigerian gang the Yahoo boys I think\nit's called they've industrialized it so\nwe don't know but you know hundreds of\nthousands millions of boys are getting\nsix distorted now and dozens are known\nto have committed suicide it's probably\nhundreds who have committed suicide but\nmost we don't know about um because you\nknow they're flirting with what they\nthink is a girl and then this criminal\ngang trick fix them into sending a nude\nphoto and at that point then they say I\nhave what I need to ruin your life send\nus send me $500 right now or I will send\nthis to all of your contacts this is\ncomplete Insanity that we let our boys\nand our girls interact with criminals\nday and night so what I would like to\nsee um is first we just have to raise\nthe age so you know below 16 they just\nshouldn't be on it at all they they need\nto be in contact with each other over 16\nokay you know this is the nature of the\nworld people are going to be interacting\nwith strangers there are some benefits\nto that there's networking issues but if\nyou were on a platform like LinkedIn\nLinkedIn people use their real names you\ndon't hear problems about LinkedIn the\nproblems are especially on Instagram\nSnapchat um any platform that has\nAnonymous strangers interacting um so if\nwe had if we had both age verification\nwhich is essential we we have to get age\nverification eventually and then also\nidentity verification now here I'm not\nsaying that the government needs to\nmandate identity verification on all\nplatforms the world would be a much\nbetter place if we did that um there\nwould be many fewer threats to democracy\nif we did that Russian agents and\nChinese agents couldn't like just drop\ncrazy rumors and make us hate each other\nin America the way they do so I would\nprefer that we live in a world where\nevery platform has mandatory identity\nverification you could still post with a\nfake name but in order to open an\naccount you have to show I'm a real\nperson in this country and I'm old\nenough but I would be content even if\nit's not mandated I would be content if\nplatforms just made this the default\nwhat if meta or let's say not meta\nthey're not going to do it but what if\nthere was an alternative to U Instagram\nin which people had to be\nverified uh and then they had all kinds\nof other safety features if they have an\nimmune system built\nin now how would I feel about letting my\n16-year-old daughter on that much better\nthan on a platform where she's in\ninteracting with criminals from around\nthe world have you spoken to meta yes\nI've spoken to why would they not do it\nwell they say they're working on it they\nsay they're working on age verification\nbut they I've seen nothing from them\nthey I shouldn't say they haven't done\nnothing they did they've done a few\nthings one thing is they at least I\nthink they set the Privacy defaults to\nhigh for under 16 I think it is whereas\nit used to be you know you you know\nyou're you're a nine-year-old you lie\nyou say you're 13 and what you say is\npublic that's completely insane so they\nhave taken a few steps but not much and\nagain Antonio Bear's testimony to the\nSenate last year was I showed them\nwhat's happening the sexual solicitation\nof teens I I told them a simple way to\nhave this reported they didn't do\nanything so I think um meta in\nparticular has shown itself resistant to\nchanges suggested by people within\nthat's why we have a couple of Facebook\nwhistleblowers um so I'm hoping that\nmarket competition will help um I'm\nhoping that Congress will repeal the\nmistakes it made in the United States we\ncreated this problem for the world um we\nyou know our companies created this\nstuff our Congress said that we're not\nallowed to sue them for what they do to\nour kids they can show our kids whatever\nthey want and we can't sue them it's a\nspecial law that says we can't sue them\nuh but in other countries they can and\nso I'm really hopeful that all around\nthe world people initiate lawsuits when\ntheir kids have committed suicide\nbecause of things that happen on social\nmedia um I hope that people will\ninitiate proceedings if they can um if\nit's clear that it was caused by by on\nonline activity uh and then Cong\nthe US Congress created this really this\nvery ridiculous law that the age at\nwhich you can sign a contract with a\ncompany give away your data without your\nparents knowledge without your parents\nconsent is 13 which is insanely low um\nit should that I think needs to be 16 or\n18 but it was set to 13 in\n1998 with no enforcement in fact the way\nthe law is written as long as Facebook\nor Instagram or SnapChat as long as they\ndon't know you're underage they're fine\nbut if they ask and then they find out\nthat you're under 13 well then then now\nthey're responsible so it's very\nimportant for them that they not know\nhow old their users are and we have to\nchange that we have to get to the point\nwhere they have to know of course they\ndo know how old their users are they\nknow everything about their users but\nthey don't kick them off so we have to\nget to the point where the companies are\nheld responsible for underage use in the\nphysical world it's like it's so absurd\nyou know people say tell me well it's\nthe parents job to keep them off okay\nimagine a world in which we generally\nthink kids should not be exposed to\nhardcore sex to drugs to violence and to\naddiction so we have age limits on bars\nstrip clubs brothel there you know the\nbrothel in Nevada and in Europe um and\ncasinos we have age limits on those what\nif someone said you know it's the\nparents job to keep the kids out of that\nif they don't want their 13-year-olds\ninto brothel they should stop them from\ngoing to brothel like no that's not the\nway it works like no this is a business\nthis business is hurting kids this\nbusiness is responsible for checking IDs\nfor keeping out Children yet in the\nonline world we say well you know what\nare you going to do you know N9 year\nolds are going to be watching beheading\nvideos they're going to be watching anal\nsex they're going to be watching the cat\nin a blender video have you heard of\nthis one cat and a blender I didn't know\nthat one it's exactly what it sounds\nlike and this is something that kids are\nexposed to like a it's an actual cat put\nin a blender and killed yeah I have not\nwatched the video because I don't ever\nwant to see it because I'll never unsee\nit but I did enough research to know\nthis is not just an rumor this actually\nhappened in it was in China um so you\nknow this is the world that our kids are\nnow inhabiting and I'm saying no no wait\nat least till you're 16 get partway\nthrough puberty before you're immersed\nin this garbage and that is a great\ntransition to our spirituality\ndiscussion well it's an it's an\nironic situation where we were\nglorifying the Millennials to have been\nmuch more productive and effective but a\nlot of the Millennials who created\namazing companies are the companies that\nare now creating this challenge that's\nright is an irony yeah but I read\nsomething around over 10 years ago and\nit talked about how humans defined what\nwas most important to a community a city\nor a town based on the tallest building\nthat was built and so previously it was\nthe church or the place of worship few\nyears later that transformed or few\ndecades later that transformed to the\ngovernment building yeah and then\ndecades later that transformed to the\ncorporate offices and and now the tech\ncompanies or the financial instit s and\nso we saw how Society has shifted its\nNorth Star I was curious to see why you\nbrought a chapter on spiritual elevation\nand degradation into this conversation\nand how is it connected yeah so my first\nbook was called the happiness hypothesis\nfinding modern truth and ancient wisdom\nwhat I did in that book it grew out of\nmy teaching psych 101 introductory\npsychology at the University of Virginia\nI noticed when I was trying to explain\npsychology to 300 you know students I\nwould quote sh spe you know there's\nnothing good or bad but thinking makes\nit so well that Insight is actually also\nMarcus aelius and Buddha Buddha says we\nare what we think with our minds we make\nthe world um and so I realiz wow you\nknow across the Millennia across the\ncontinents people have come to these\ndeep insights about psychology about\nhappiness about love about Consciousness\nso I collected I read a lot of ancient\nwisdom all over the world and I took out\nevery psychological claim and I\norganized them and I made it into 10\nchapters and you know so some of them\nare you know like you know be slower to\njudge quicker to forgive you know Jesus\nsays judge not lest ye be judged you\nknow and I have a whole chapter on how\nour moral psychology is such that we\njump to judgments we care about our\ntribe we don't care about the truth you\nknow so so that was my background I I\nwrote that book on Ancient wisdom and\nthen I wrote the coddling the American\nmind with Greg lukanov and we talked\nabout these three great untruths the\nways that students are being taught you\nknow that they're they're fragile\nancient wisdom is you know what doesn't\nkill you makes you stronger there's\nquotes from all over the world about\nthat um but kids are being taught no\nyou're fragile like uh you know if\nsomeone says a word or a name that can\nbe violence against you so we're making\nmistakes here um so that's sort of my\nbackground is thinking about ancient\nwisdom in Psychology all right so then I\nend up writing this book The anxious\ngeneration and I'm it's July of last\nyear and I'm way behind deadline and I'm\nalready really stressed about like\nyou know I'm so far past the the\ndeadline in order for us to get the book\nout but I felt like you know what I just\nwrot this whole book about kids I\nhaven't said anything about adults but\nwe're all feeling it most of us at least\nare feeling it where something is wrong\nyou know the you know when I got my\nfirst iPhone it was so amazing I loved\nit um but these technologies have become\nour Master they're changing our lives\nand I decided you know what I I'm going\nto write a chapter for adults I'm just\ngoing to stick in a chapter what is it\nthat's happening to all of us and I just\nstart making the list you know it keeps\nus indoors it keeps us distracted and I\nsuddenly realized wow almost all the\nancient insights into how to live the\nphone based life is the opposite and\nonce I saw that I said oh my God that's\nthe structure for this chapter so I\nopened it with my earlier work on moral\nelevation I I I study moral emotions I I\nused to have writings on moral elevation\nwhich everyone will recognize when you\nyou see a story about you read a story\nyou see a you know on the news or\nanything about heroism about loyalty um\nabout devotion you know a dog that um\nyou know was so devoted to its master\nand it keeps coming to the train station\nto greet him I mean you know we're\neasily moved and we feel it we feel it\nin our chest and it it's the Vegas nerve\num gets activated our heart rhythms\nchange um there are hormonal effects uh\nthere's um um oxytocin is released women\nlactate I I showed that experimentally\nin a study with Jennifer Silvers so I\ndid all this research on moral elevation\nand the key to it is the psychology of\nup and down some things make us feel\ncloser to God uh some things make us\nfeel further from God that's the way\ncultures talk about it um and it's\nalways a vertical metaphor God is up the\ndevil is down so this is my view I'm a\nJewish atheist myself I don't I'm not a\nBeliever but I've had some religious\nexperiences I've had a number of\nspiritual experiences so I know these\nare an important part of human\npsychology and once I put in that\nframework that ancient Traditions are\ntrying to move us up they're saying you\nknow meditate you know Hindu Traditions\nBuddhist Traditions you know things\neverything out of India is much more get\ncontrol of your attention get control of\nyour Consciousness otherwise it just\ngets drowned in trivia but no you know\nmeditate live purely do your work with\nMastery come out like the moon come out\nfrom behind the clouds and Shine That's\na loose translation of from the dapada\nbut what does a phone based life do\nconstant notifications constant\ninterruptions my students at NYU you\nknow they get two or 300 notifications a\nday on average on their phones many of\nthem never go 10 minutes without\ninterruption um so so I just made a list\nand it was things like spiritual\npractices involve making something\nsacred and we all agree this thing is\nsacred and we worship it we have sacred\ndays so you know in the Jewish religion\nwe have the Shabbat you know Sabbath\nyou're not supposed to use Electronics\nif you're Orthodox um things are sacred\nand it's the sharing the sacredness\nbinds us together that's what every\nreligious community does but a life\nonline nothing is sacred there's no\nthere's no sacred time there's the\ninternet never closes it's Global um\nthere's no there are no holidays there\nare no holy days um and the constant\ndemand for you to post about your brand\nwhat you're doing look at the amazing\nlife I have so we have a posted after\nBabel we we we're just taking on this\nreally wonderful British writer a young\nwoman named Freya India jenz\nwriter and she has a post which starts\nwith you see a photo of of a young woman\nposing for a sexy selfie on the train\ntracks in front of awit here she is\nshe's on some tour of awit the\nconcentration camp but it's a nice day\nin Poland and so she poses in a sexy way\nin front of the gates of hell and so you\nknow if everyone's a brand manager all\nthe time nothing is sacred oh and it's\nAll About You whereas one of the keys to\nspirituality is it's not all about you\nyou actually are not that important it's\nonly when you can transcend yourself\ntranscend your self-interest that you\ncan open your heart to God to to our\nhigher motives to love to other people\nso you know you just go through the list\nwhatever the Ancients urg us to do to\nachieve spiritual progress a life lived\nonline even for us adults pulls Us in\nthe opposite direction I couldn't agree\nwith you more and I think what's really\ninteresting when I'm hearing that and\nthat's primarily why I started this show\nthe goal and the intention behind this\nshow was how can we avoid gossip how can\nwe avoid the juiciest scoop how can we\navoid the lowest hanging fruit and still\nget as many or more views than everyone\nelse on the internet beautiful because\nmy belief system was that if you were\nable to make wisdom go viral then you\ncould actually raise\nConsciousness and if we keep feeding\npeople junk food and junk content it's\nactually not that hard to get clicks and\nViews but if you actually just as if\nyou've retrained your habits when you\nput a healthy meal in front of someone\nit can taste like the tastiest meal in\nthe world because you've retrained it\nand we've seen that like I know that the\naudience that listens and watches us\nwhich is all across the world every age\nbracket and every demographic is\nchoosing to do something healthier with\ntheir time but I wonder when I'm\nlistening to you Jonathan I'm hearing\nthe challenge again goes back to the\niron ironic point I made which is if\ncreators are not informed and trained in\nsacred\ncreation you end up creating things that\nhave the flaws of the Creator and so\nwhen oh beautifully put right when I\nlook at what the flaws of the Creator\nthat's beautiful yeah like i' I've\nalways thought when everyone's like oh\ndo you think AI be manipulative of us\nI'm like of course it will because we're\nmanipulative like it's it can't not be\nanything that we've seen so we're like\nAI is going to take over the world it's\nlike yes because humans did like it's\nnot it's not that surprising and so when\nI think of the challenges that I see in\neven TV content and streaming content\nand how dark it's got and whenever\nanyone says to me in my coaching\npractice that I have anxiety the first\nthing I asked him is what did you watch\nlast night and it's there's such a\ndirect correlation between\nthese cffh that are released in\neveryone's brain to keep them addicted\nand so I go where do this education come\nin because we can take away and I agree\nwith you by the way I'm fully with you\nwe take away what is currently causing\nan amplification of insecurity Envy ego\nand the acceleration of it but the\nchallenge is that the seed of that Still\nRemains and then gets exercised in\nadulthood how what do we do well so the\nfirst thing is we need to understand\nwhat's happening to us and this is all\nso new and um my argument is that the\nworld change life Chang between 2010 in\n2015 and my book is about how it changed\nfor kids but it changed for all of us\nand we're confused we don't understand\nit um these things are powerful tools we\nknow we adults we benefit from them in\nmany ways um but we don't understand\nwhat's happening to us and so my hope is\nthat you with my book with your show\nwith a lot of people who are writing\nabout this I think people are coming to\nrealize you know we were we were\nconfused in the 2010s it was so new and\nI think we were beginning to get there\nto see this as a problem and then Co hit\nand we all got super confused by Co and\nwe needed our online devices all the\ntime in Co but I think the reason why\nthings are changing so fast now is\nbecause now that we're coming out of\ncovid now everyone sees the wreckage\nthey see it in the new patterns in their\nchildren they see it in the new patterns\nin themselves they're sick of being on\nZoom calls all the time they want crave\nhuman contact so so let's just see how\nfar we can get just by raising awareness\nof this as you're doing on on your show\nas many people are doing so two things I\nwould urge people to think about are you\nneed to control your own attention your\nattention is the most precious among the\nmost precious resources you have so once\nyou see your attention as a precious\nresource you can stop letting companies\njust steal it from you this is perhaps\nthe most effective thing I do with my\nstudents at New York University and\nthey're mostly 19 years old plus or\nminus and I I I show them how important\nattention is they're business students\nthey want to have an effect on the world\nthey want to create something and I show\nthem if youve giving away all your\nattention to Notifications to Tik Tok\nyou have no attention left so you're not\ngoing to be able to do anything in this\nlife do you want that no they don't well\nokay how about if we turn off almost all\nyour notifications how about if we take\nsocial media off of your phone so I'm\nhoping that some of them will quit\nentirely but let's just start by just\ndon't it on your phone you can use your\nlaptop at home whatever if you need to\ncheck you need to keep up with things\njust by making a few changes they regain\ntheir attention now suddenly they have\nthe mental capacity to think to to to\nthink big to to do things so we we need\na global awaren a global recognition\nthat our attention is being drained away\nas if there was like a like a giant\nmosquito you know like a giant drill\nstuck into our brain sucking out our\nattention we got to say stop we got to\npull the needle out that's the first\nthing um uh another is to recognize that\nwe need to be rooted in real communities\nwith real relationships and face Toof\nface and touch and so we need to resist\ntaking the easy way it's so much easier\nto set up a zoom meeting than it is to\nget in your car and go to visit someone\nuh and there's many times when you need\nto do that but but we need to rehumanize\nour lives and that means more time with\nreal people not feeling so rushed um and\nbeing able to be open to people and\nsharing experiences so that's another\nthere's so many list I'll just list one\nmore area where I want to really raise\nawareness which is time in nature so the\nmodern world we're further and further\naway from nature um and as we get busier\nand busier we have no time and so after\n2012 when everyone's on social media all\nthe time everyone's on their phones um\npeople are spending less time people in\nAmerica uh Church attendance has\nplummeted since 2011 or so 2012 because\nno one has time everyone's so busy with\ntheir notifications and their and their\nposts um so exposing ourselves to to\nBeauty to Nature going out for all walks\ngo out for a walk I have my students go\nout for a walk in a park with no phone\nand no headphones they can't listen to\nmusic they have to go just walk slowly\nand the effects are amazing because many\nof them they've never noticed they've\nnever noticed how beautiful the world is\nyeah so we can we can take steps to\nrehumanize our lives and how do we resp\nspiritualize them like how do we going\nback to that chapter of I feel like it's\nalso spiritualizing of intention right\nif someone's creating something and I'm\nassuming when you do your research and\nthe books you've written and even the\nthe the one H happiness hypothesis that\nyou started with and and the journey\nthat you've gone on it seems like your\nintention has been to uplift people\nthrough your work certainly my early\nwork I used to study positive psychology\nand the goal there was very explicit the\nwhole movement started by Martin\nSeligman in the 1990s the whole movement\nwas psychology is pretty good at taking\npeople from -6 up to zero we we we're\nyou know we we have some ways to bring\nyou up to zero but most people are\nactually above zero most people are\nactually doing reasonably well and they\nwant to go from plus two to plus seven\nand psychology had nothing to say to\nthem so yes a lot of my early work was\nabout how do we get to plus seven um but\nespecially with the cing the American\nmind and now the anxious\ngeneration I'm I'm now talking about how\ndo we get from10 up to up to zero I mean\nthat's the first step um just help kids\nhelp the Next Generation get out of\ndefend mode out of performance mode and\ninto a more human real childhood it's\nalmost like your students in the you\nknow the people that will go on to\nbecome entrepreneurs and Business\nLeaders it's almost like the challenge\nstill becomes that even if people think\nbig and think successfully and think\nscaled and are open-minded it's almost\nlike without the inherent belief that I\nshould create something to help\nothers without that no matter what you\ncreate will in some way harm or or cause\ndifficulty to others because it wasn't\nthere in not saying that you can do\nsomething perfectly and not saying you\ncould build something without any floors\ncompletely that's no one can do that but\nthis idea that at least if that's my\nintention if that's at least my North\nStar if that's my compass and I'm\nwondering where where people are getting\nthat from if at all yeah I'll take what\nyou said and I'll just make it a little\nbit more business friendly please um you\nsaid seem to be something like if you\nintend to make something that's good for\npeople or or you know if you have a\npositive intention that's is going to\nhelp people and so you know many people\nthink like oh you know I should go into\na nonprofit work I should go into\ncharity work you know a lot of young\npeople are headed to towards nonprofit\nwork and a lot of the nonprofits don't\ndo very much and they're they're wasting\ntheir talents there since I moved to a\nbusiness school in 2011 I used to teach\nin the psychology department of the\nUniversity of Virginia but I've been at\nthe NYU Stern School of Business since\n2011 what I've come to see is that is\nthat almost all businesses make the\nworld better because they're creating\nsomething that people need and I once\nheard a philosopher say in an ideal\ncapitalist Society the only way to get\nrich is by making other people better\noff and so you don't have to be all\npro-social you can just say look there's\na need for this kind of wrench I\ninvented this wrench the world's better\noff people need it and and then I make\nmoney that's great you know if I tell my\nstudents if all you do is is create\ngoods and services that increase this\nthe general welfare of humankind because\nit's a useful product that's great\nyou're part you're part of progress um\nbut now when we look at it that way now\nwe get a new view of social media\nbecause social media is not a normal\nconsumer product a normal consumer\nproduct if it hurts the customers\nthey'll stop buying it unless they're\naddicted but with social media and\nespecially the um the the advertising\ndriven business model that Facebook\ndeveloped originally now many of them\nhave copied the customer is the\nadvertiser that's who pays the money the\nconsumer is the product they're the\nvictim in a sense of this and that\nexplains why for especially for Tik Tok\nand Instagram I've seen a couple of\nsurveys now and I did with my own class\nyou say do you use Tik Tok you know so\nlet's do it this way I ask my students\nhow many of you use um Netflix how many\nof you watch Netflix at least once a\nweek almost all hands go up how many of\nyou wish Netflix was never invented\nnobody\nnobody Netflix is Stories full length\nStories We enjoy it maybe we watch too\nmuch but we don't feel it's ruining our\nlives okay how many of you use Tik Tok\nonce a week most hands go up how many of\nyou wish Tik Tok was never invented most\nhands go up same thing for Instagram so\nwe have this bizarre situation where a\ncouple of big platforms especially Tik\nTok Instagram Facebook Twitter a few\nothers they're sucking up most human\nattention billions and billions of\npeople are spending hours a day day most\nhuman attention is being drained away\nfor a product that most people wish\nnever existed so this is I think the\ngreatest destruction of human value in\nhuman history these products should not\nexist or at least they should not exist\nin their present form unregulated not\nresponsible for the harm they cause\ncausing massive harm the people who use\nthem don't overall which they didn't\nexist something is deeply deeply wrong\num with with our society and the and the\nthe nature of these companies which are\nnow some of the biggest richest\ncompanies on Earth yeah and you could\nargue that fast food companies and junk\nfood companies have done the same for\nyears and got away with it too well\nthat's true that's true but at least\nthere people are making a decision now\nthere it's it's part of it is addiction\nbut at least there you know like I\nreally enjoy Fritos I just love Fritos\nit's just you know something I and M&M\nthere are a few consumer products that I\nlove and I you know I know they're bad\nfor me but I make a decision about it um\nand I don't think and they are of course\nthey are adding obesity but I think\nsocial media is so much more pernicious\nbecause if I eat Fritos that doesn't\nmake anyone else eat Fritos but if I get\non social media that you know the more\nof us are on the more pressure there is\nto be on and that's especially hitting\nour kids we've got to break that up\nabsolutely Jonathan it's been such a joy\ntalking to you and uh so insightful I'm\nso glad you gave our audience so many\ngreat call to actions and we'll make\nsure we put them in the caption in the\ncomment section so people can find them\neasily uh we end every episode of of on\npurpose with a fast five or a final five\nthese have to be answered in one word to\none sentence maximum so you have some\nsomething to play with drink of water\nlet me compose myself this could be\ndifficult uh Jonathan I these are your\nfinal five the first question is what is\nthe best advice you've ever heard or\nreceived well what comes to mind I don't\nknow if it's the best but what comes\nright away to mind is what my father\nsaid when he dropped me off at college\nand he said uh John the most important\nthings you learn uh you're not going to\nlearn in the classroom and it was just\nyou know it's just advice to go have\nexperience and and that's actually\nsomething I tell my students now is just\nyou know take risks have experiences\nbeautiful uh question number two what is\nthe worst advice you ever had or\nreceive um the worst advice I ever\nreceived um hard to say but I think um\ngenerally a piece of bad advice that\nyoung people receive um is you know just\nfollow your passions um that's important\nbut I think many young people now think\nthat they need to be engaged in work\nwhich is not just rewarding but socially\nvaluable like as though my first job\nafter college has to be have all these\nfeatures and what I try to tell them is\nno no you want to end up there you want\nat you know in a decade or two you want\nto have work that you love that doesn't\nmean you have to love every moment of it\nyeah you know think long term think\nabout the skills you need think about\nthe toughening you need think about the\nexperiences you need and it might even\nbe unpleasant for a while but but think\nlong term mhm great uh question number\nthree an experience that you'd never\nthought you you'd ever try but you're\nglad you did um I'm really Pro experien\nI'm very high in openness to experience\nand I always kind of wanted to try\neverything so you know whether it was\npsychedelic drugs or um you know travel\nall over the world so I actually can't\nthink of anything so you've done them\nall well I I've done I mean I've done a\nlot of different things in my\nlife yeah yeah which I've talked about\non some podcasts now that now that\nMichael Polland has written a book on it\nnow that people can talk about\npsychedelic experience that is you know\nI mentioned before I've had a number of\nspiritual experiences some of the most\nintense ones were on psychedelics\nquestion number four an experience that\nyou are excited to try this year an\nexperience I'm excited to try this year\nuh well this well actually going to\nWimbledon my my son have you ever been\nbefore no going be amazing my my son is\ngraduating from high school and I wanted\nto give him something special I said\nwhat's something that that you what's an\nexperience you want to have and he said\nwimbl he loves tennis we go to the US\nOpen in New York but he's never been to\nWimbledon oh you're going to have the\nbest time yeah so I was able to scr up a\nfew tickets and we'll go a couple of\ndays fantastic that would be great okay\nFifth and final question we asked this\nto every guest who's ever been on the\nshow if you could create one law that\neveryone had to follow what would it be\nI mean I'm thinking kind of practically\nhere you know pleas um you know one\nwould be that businesses that impose\ncosts on others um that are not party to\nThe Exchange should have to bear the\ncost so basically get rid of\nexternalities and social media imposes\nso many\nexternalities um but if I if I have just\nlike one Dart to throw one thing to ask\nright now I'm just going to say let's\nget uh effective mandatory age\nverification on the internet so that\nsome sites um are actually like porn\nsites are actually not open to Children\num I think a law like that would be\nthat's that's going to be the big hard\none that would be a real game Cher so\nagain not very I you know hoping you\nknow it would be great if I could come\nup with you know some version of K's\ncategorical imperative here um but uh no\nI'll just go with those are the ones\nI've been thinking about fantastic\neveryone thank you so much for listening\nthe book is called the anxious\ngeneration how the great rewiring of\nchildhood is causing an epidemic of\nmental illness Jonathan height thank you\nso much for joining us on on purpose I\nreally am encouraging everyone who's\nbeen listening and watching to go ahead\nto the sites that Jonathan recommended\nsee if we can be a part of the mission\nsupport the work that Jonathan and his\nteam are doing because I couldn't agree\nwith you more I think this will this is\nwhat I what I love about what you've\ndone is often I find a lot of thinkers\nand thought leaders create fear based\narguments and without any Concrete\nSolutions and I feel that only adds to\nthe fear and anxiety in the world and so\nI'm very grateful that we have very\ntangible specific things that we're\nfighting for here and I really really\nhope that you'll lean on us to help you\nand and help be a part of this with you\nwell thank you Jay I am wildly\noptimistic that this is a problem we can\nsolve in a year or two at least get most\nof the way towards solving and I really\nappreciate your help in getting the word\nout I'm so excited to reach a global\naudience because this is this is a panum\nthis is a global problem AB so thank you\nJay thank you Jonathan thank you if you\nenjoyed this podcast you're going to\nlove my conversation with Michelle Obama\nwhere she opens up on how to stay with\nyour partner when they're changing and\nthe four check-ins you should be doing\nin your relationship we also talk about\nhow to deal with relationships when\nthey're under stress if you're you're\ngoing through something right now with\nyour partner or someone you're seeing\nthis is the episode for you no wonder\nour kids are struggling we have a new\ntechnology and we've just taken it in\nHook Line and Sinker and we have to be\nmindful for our kids they'll just be\nthumbing through this stuff you know\ntheir their mind's never sleeping"
