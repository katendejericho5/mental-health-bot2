    "transcript": "we know people should exercise and yet\nwhen we tell people who are overweight\nand diabetic to go exercise they don't\nactually lose weight and they very\nrarely improve their diabetes why is\nthat the best-selling author and host\nthe number one Health and Wellness\npodcast with Jay Shetty\nyou know what was your journey from\nconventional medicine to internal\nmedicine\nand how did you even move in that\ndirection because I think that today\nwe're seeing a lot more of that but\nyou've been doing this for a long time\nso I wonder what that transition was\nlike it was a stepwise journey into a\nlot of left-hand turns and pivots I\nthink but the the journey began in the\nPhilippines I took a hard left turn in\nmy career I was going into engineering\ntook a year off and then had the\nopportunity to birth babies in the\nPhilippines with a group of\ninternational midwives and that\nexperience of being around the birth of\nhuman life was so riveting and so\nengaging that the idea of returning to a\nprogram in robotics and machines just\ncouldn't capture my imagination anymore\nand so that was my age reporting to the\nhealth career and initially thinking\nmaybe nursing nurse practitioner and\nthen eventually slippery slope took me\ninto the idea of just going ahead down\nthat medical doctor route and that\nJourney came along and an interesting\npoint in human history where or I didn't\nrealize in the 1990s none of us knew at\nthe time that we were about to witness\nthe most extraordinary explosion of\nchronic disease in human history we were\nabout to see the complete collapse of\nthe human immune system the human\nneurologic system and the debut of\nthings like attention deficit disorder\ngluten sensitivity Lyme disease chronic\nfatigue syndromes chronic pain syndromes\nthings that had simply not existed 10\nyears let alone in the in the previous\nthousand years and so it was a very\ninteresting time to enter into this\nworld of science and medicine at the\npoint where we would lose it all and now\nwe recognize you know 30 years later\nthat we're now in the midst of the sixth\nExtinction event where we're losing\nbiology at such an extraordinary rate\nand we see not only cancer epidemics and\nautoimmune epidemics and the rest we're\nseeing you know pandemics and the\nresults of this real disruption of\nneural anatomy and attention deficit to\nautism from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's\nand this breakdown in our cell cell\ncommunication such that we wouldn't\nreally lose our our self-identity in\nthis milieu of inflammation and\ndestruction at the cellular level which\nof course is manifesting at the macro\nlevel as well and so we see the\ndissolution of socio-political systems\nand this polarization and the fear guilt\nshame paradigms amplifying as our\nbiology collapses so never before so\ninteresting a moment to step into this\nspace and it's been a real exciting\njourney into realizing that the end is\nnear of an old Paradigm and the\nbeginning is nigh for everything that we\nperhaps have not even yet imagined\nbecause we are starting to realize that\nto be human to be human health is really\na description of an ecosystem rather\nthan a single species trying to met out\na survival Paradigm within a complex\necosystem of life you know one of the\nreasons why I've been so interested in\nyour work is because I found myself\ngoing from being quite a healthy\nindividual to then randomly having\ninflammation and having gut issues and\nwhatever it may have been and none of\nthem were things I could even explain\nlike I was living a generally healthy\ndiet or I was pretty active or whatever\nit may be but still I've started to see\nall these things and so what started in\nthe first place at such a global level\nlike what has been going on with our\nhealth the food system and everything\nelse what's been happening that has\ncaused it today where I think the\nmajority of us either are experiencing\nit or know someone who's experiencing it\nyeah\nI think I had to go into the problem\nbefore I found some of the answers to\nyour questions there and uh diving\ndeeper and deeper into the problem I was\nas trained in Internal Medicine which is\nGeneral Hospital care kind of your adult\nmedicine and conventional pharmaceutical\nmodel running icus and the like running\nhow's the chief resident training\nresidents and Med students at the\nUniversity of Virginia and was finding\nthat I wasn't finding the answers to how\ndo I make my patients healthier I was\nchasing disease and it was getting more\nand more difficult seemed every year to\nactually have a positive outcome with my\npatients and so I felt like I needed\nmore training and I did endocrinology\nand Metabolism for another three years\nand that training really took me into\nwhat is the communication network of\nthis Exquisite Symphony that we would\ncall a human body how's liver talk to\nthe brain how's the brain talk back to\nthe adrenal glands out of the adrenal\nglands talk to those kidneys and so that\nwas the fascination of that hormonal\nnetwork of communication and that drove\nme down deeper into the second half of\nthat specialty which is called\nmetabolism how does energy get liberated\nwithin a human cell to manifest life and\nthe answer was just becoming obvious was\nthat it's actually not the human cells\ncreating the energy it's these tiny\nlittle microbes these little bacteria\nthat live inside of our cells that was\nliberating energy for the human cell to\nthrive upon and those little bacteria\noften called mitochondria are very\nsusceptible to toxins\nI was developing toxins to kill cancer\ncells and was watching those toxins\ndamage this ecosystem within and then\nmake it very difficult for a cell to\nrecover on a cancer journey and so it\nwas a realization that this this\nParadigm of poisoning for the effort of\nHealth was just chasing for the wind so\nI'd spent 17 years of Academia becoming\nan expert in cellular biology becoming\nexpert ultimately in this little niche\nof chemotherapy realizing that at the\nend oh my gosh I'm chasing the wind no\nmatter how good my chemotherapy gets\nit's never going to actually solve the\nproblem that I face because actually in\nhuman history not a single cause case of\ncancer has ever been caused by a lack of\nchemotherapy and so it was that kind of\nslippery slope of root cause root\nsolution would cause resolution to\nrealize I'm not anywhere near the root\nof this thing\nbut my chemotherapy was in vitamin A\ncompounds which are nutrients obviously\nfrom Food Systems and so that was a back\ndoor into the question of what happened\nin nutrition that we would suddenly have\nall this cancer if nutrition can kill\ncancer where did that nutrient base go\nand that led us then to some pretty\nexciting answers and I had to leave the\nuniversity setting at that point because\nthe research that I next wanted to do\ncouldn't really fit into the Paradigm of\nhere's a drug here's the disease and I\nwas starting to want to ask deeper\nquestions about how does life happen how\ndoes biology happen so I left in 2010\nstarted a clinic that was you know based\nin nutrition an idea that the nutrition\ncould be the basis for reversing chronic\ndisease and perhaps ultimately\npreventing it and that was a daunting\nand scary moment for me because I had\nbeen trained nothing at all in nutrition\nand so I was desperately looking for\neverything I could put my hands on in\nthe nutrition Sciences to try to find a\npath forward and I was finding that the\nnutrition science is really disconnected\nfrom the deeper understanding of how\nbiology worked we were practicing on a\n50 year old beliefs about nutrition with\nthe feud pyramid and all this when in\nfact we kind of knew already at the\nbiology level then that was a Miss but\nwe hadn't matured that that science and\nlong winding path it turns out that I\nfound myself back to not recent medicine\nbut Ancient Ancient medicine and we find\nthat long before Hippocrates came along\nto say we are what we eat kind of thing\nright Chinese medicine had recognized\nthat we we must you know realize that we\nare a manifestation of the nutrient\nnutrition the connection to Nature and\nmaybe deeper than Chinese medicine\nayurveda which was a deep deep uh feel\nthat you've studied extensively with\nyour tea company and everything else\nthis science of ayurveda dates back 9\n000 years and comparing that to like 50\nyears of Food Science that we throw at\nthe at the wall right now it's it's been\nproven over and over and over again in\nvast different you know people's groups\nand genetics and everything else and so\nand then that long whining path took me\nback into this indigenous realization of\nwe are of nature we are of the earth\neach one of us is of the earth and this\nis why we call ourselves earthlings I\nsuppose but this Human Condition\nidentifies that nature intended us into\nour existence and into our resilience\nand into our full potential and it's in\nthis last hundred years where we've\naccelerated this March away from that\nnature and the convenience life Styles\nand the technology boom and everything\nelse and this has been that pivot point\nof how did we lose Health we simply\ndistanced ourselves from nature further\nthan we'd ever been and we did it at\nthese fundamentals as you point out of\nthe food system\nand so that was my slippery slope into\nwhat's happened to the food which took\nus into what happened to the soil which\nhas taken us into a realization of oh my\ngosh we became chemically dependent both\nin our farming practices and our\nPharmacy of the hospital and when we\ntook both of those Industries and said\nwe will technologically create a new\nchemical that will allow us to grow food\nbetter and be healthier\nwe lost our underpinnings we lost the\nfoundation of Nutritional Health on the\nplanet and the Vitality of humanity it's\nincredible isn't it that it feels like\nsuch\nsmall simple changes but then they\nachieve incredible scale\nright like the idea of\nif you could find that to be the root\nbut the rate at which we've all been\nnegatively impacted by it has been\ncolossal\nI guess right now the individuals that\nare listening and all of us it's kind of\nwe're in a challenging place because I\nthink people want to be healthier but\nthey feel extremely conditioned by how\nthey've been raised how they grew up the\nkinds of foods that they've been exposed\nto the types of convenience as you said\nthat they have already and I find that\nthat's probably one of the hardest\nthings is habit change because like you\nsaid we've marched so far away from\nbeing at one with the environment or\nbeing at one with the soil or being so\nclose to our food and now we're being so\nfar away that it almost feels more\nabnormal to go back to Nature because of\nthe conditioning\nthat exists and so how difficult have\nyou found it to help people actually\nreconnect with that which we've\nforgotten\nwhen that's actually who we were if that\nmakes sense I think it's almost\nimpossible when you sit down with\nsomebody in the construct of I'm gonna\nI'm gonna prove to you that you're wrong\nbut it's incredibly easy to get there\nwhen you start in a state of compassion\npassion is a much different energy than\nempathy and I think we've lost\ncompassion for our belief and empathy\nempathy is that effort to bring my\nenergy my vibration to your vibration\nlet you be the tuning fork because you\nmight have been just been diagnosed with\na condition if I sit down with a cancer\npatient their vibration is in fear and\nyou know maybe guilt and shame because\nthey're going to leave their children\nbehind at a young age or whatever it is\nand so if I dive into empathy and try to\nmatch that vibration we get stuck there\nwe get stuck in the fear guilt shame\nParadigm and I'm suddenly steeped in\nfear of like I don't think I'm equipped\nto help you free yourself this disease I\nthink you are going to die I think that\nyou know and so I have these deep fears\nwithin me around the death of my patient\nand they have that deep fear of death\nwithin themselves\nand so that's typically where we go as\nhumans right now as we're taught that\nthis empathic state of what is the\nvibration of the other person across\nfrom you can you match that there before\nyou're in it together whereas compassion\nis a much different state of recognizing\nwhere they're at listening to the song\nthey're singing but not becoming part of\nthat Symphony and holding this other\nspace this other potential reality of\nokay yes this has happened but what is\nthe alternative to it and I think you\nlose that when you slip into that fear\nState when you lose your creativity as\nsoon as that fight or flight State kicks\nin on your sympathetic nervous system\nthe creative part of your brain shuts\ndown when we stimulate the adrenal\nglands\nwhich is of course what we're doing to\nour children with Adderall and all this\nwe stimulate with drugs those adrenal\nglands and they lose their creativity so\nwe have whole Generations now that have\nbeen taught to answer multiple choice\ntests at the cost of their own\ncreativity and performance is linked to\ntheir adrenaline levels\nthat is basically the same thing that's\nhappening in every doctor's office in\nthe world as the physician is afraid\nthat they're not going to prevent death\nin this patient and the patient is\nafraid that they are dying\nand for all that fear of an end point we\ncan't imagine Life as a Continuum as a\ncontinuing\nenergetic event that's vital and\nconstantly regenerating itself and so\nthat's kind of the the death spiral that\nwe were in\nand finding our way out of that had to\ndo with realizing that nature has never\nseen an endpoint has never seen death of\nan individual or species as endpoints\nalways new potential energy and the\nbeauty on this planet has continued to\nget more Rich more diverse and\nultimately more intelligent with every\nsingle iteration\nwe call it the sixth Extinction that\nwe're in because there's been five\nothers\nand yet life booms on this planet in\nways that we couldn't have imagined\nbefore that last Extinction 60 million\nyears ago the dinosaurs were walking\naround on top soil levels that were 30\nfeet deep we're lucky if I find three\ninches of good soil on the Earth right\nnow 30 feet deep Topsoils root systems\nof ferns and Palms that allowed for\nthose forms of vegetation to fuel those\ndinosaurs into these massive bodies\nbecause there was so much nutrition so\nmuch energy available\nand then the top topsoil died an\nasteroid hit choked the Topsoils out and\nlife on Earth disappeared\nfor a moment and then it came back not\nwith Dinosaurs but with birds\nmammals humans not with palms and ferns\nbut Palms Ferns and flowering trees\ndeciduous trees flowering plants\nwildflowers\nand so this has been a journey of\niteration on this planet of life more\nrich and more intelligent at every\nsingle turn and this needs to be\nembraced as a society right now as we\nanticipate the death of many things\nwe need to get excited for what will\ncome next more richness more beauty is\ngoing to happen and that's programmed\ninto the Matrix of life it will get\nbetter it will get more diverse and it\nwill get more intelligent if we imagine\nthe Earth leaping from dinosaurs to\nbirds and mammals and humans where do we\ngo from birds and mammals and humans to\nwhat what species has this Earth already\nimagined and already coded for in the\nvirum\nthe virum is a description of a library\nof genetic potential it's all of the\nviruses of the planet it's a database\nthose viruses are new potential genes\nwaiting to be expressed by whatever life\nhappens next\nright now in my body there's 10 to the\n15 viruses coursing through my\nbloodstream it's 10 billion viruses in\nmy bloodstream right now not the same\nviruses repeated different viruses 10\nbillion new genes\nchecking in with every cell on my body\nsay is this an opportunity is this an\nopportunity is this an opportunity so as\nI let go of my own biology if I let go\nof fear guilt and shame is there a\npossibility for me to leap forward with\nmy own biology with the genes that are\nwithin me right now coursing through my\nbloodstream because I'm a microcosm of\nExtinction and rebirth and this is where\nmedicine has really failed us is it was\na belief of scarcity rather than\nabundance death rather than rebirth\nfear of being that everything was\nagainst us rather than perhaps\neverything is for us\nand this has been that slippery Journey\nFor Me of realizing at each turn I\nunderestimated our potential and we are\nsitting here at the Pinnacle of a great\nRebirth of humanity if we choose to go\nthat direction\nI guess if anyone's\nfeeling that way on a personal level\nwhere they're living in that scarcity\nthey're living in that fear they're\nliving in that insecurity of\nand just challenge of I don't know what\nto do I don't know where to start\nthere's so many things that I need to\nsort out with my health there's you know\nI'm worried about I keep hearing about\nmy nervous system and the microbiome and\nit just feels like overwhelming because\nwe've been so uneducated and untrained\nin our bodies right it's almost like\nwe've been given these buddies since\nwe've been born but we're so uneducated\nabout how to use them and what they need\nand what's good for them and what's bad\nfor them and so if someone's feeling in\na state of overwhelm where do you\nsuggest they begin we've been working\nfor the last 15 years in our laboratory\nand in our clinics to sort out what's\nthe simplest\napproach to beginning again because I\nthink we really are at the end of\nphysiology when we see two-year-olds\nwith osteosarcoma when we see 15 year\nolds with you know psychotic major\ndepression when we see a 20 year old\nwith life-threatening autoimmune disease\nall of these conditions are that we need\na radical revolution and so we've been\nworking through all the complexity of\nthe diseases and the root causes and\neverything else to find that there's\nreally eight very basic things that\nstart to build physiology from the\nground up at the cell level and\ntherefore at the organism level and from\nthe organism to the species and those\neight things really revolve around some\nvery basic lifestyle interventions the\nfirst of which is coming out of fear\nand so we spend the first segment of\nthis process of finding self within the\ncontext of all the anxiety that you have\nthat you might feel like you're dying\nthat you feel like it's hopeless feel\nlike all the cards are stacked against\nyou how do we get out of that Paradigm\nquickly\nand that's an effort of really bringing\nthe arrow inwards because right now the\nmedicine and the World At Large are\ntrying to point outside of you to say\nthere's your problem there's your\nproblem there's your problem there's\nyour problem there's your problem so\nturning the arrow inward to say where's\nmy solution\nand you and I talked about this briefly\nbefore the podcast started of like how\ndid you know your journey how did you\nget from North London to Los Angeles and\neverything in between and you answered\nvery beautifully you said I just\nlistened to my intuition and I never\ntried to judge it for did it make sense\nor not\nand that's basically what's happened at\nour Clinic is we had to go Inward and\nask where does this health come from\nbecause I wasn't trained into health I\nwas trained into disease management\nand so as myself and my colleagues\nstarted to put that Arrow inward we\nfound wow this is really exciting it's\nsuper simple in the end it's not a\nthousand diseases against humans it's\none Health waiting to to emerge and so\nas you come out of the fear Paradigm and\nthat external definition of self and you\nbecome you then your guide is your your\nfuture self your highest self whatever\nis it being expressed to make you alive\ntoday with a self-identity which is\npretty bizarre it's strange that you\nknow you wake up every morning and you\nknow your J and strange that I haven't\nwoken up and at some point thought I'm\nJay Shetty because we're we're really\nthe same thing like we're saying biology\nsame thing I think I'm in Los Angeles I\ncould have bumped into the j-wave very\neasily I mean like I'm Jay Shetty\nand yet you keep being you no matter how\nclose and proximity others are around\nyou no matter how much food you share\nthe same beliefs you share the same you\nkeep being you\nand the Really trippy thing is I get to\nand they have that ICU setting see\npeople let go of the body and die hard\nstops brain waves come to a standstill\nthey leave that body and then they\nsuddenly reanimate we're doing chest\ncompressions we're shocking them\nwhatever's going on or sometimes they\njust spontaneously come back into that\nbody\nand they traveled after that body\nstopped after that heartbeat stopped\nthey traveled around sometimes in the\nroom sometimes great distances around\nthe planets visit loved ones Etc\nsometimes off the planet into the cosmos\nand at no point in that after death\nJourney did they lose track of their\nself-identity\nand so that is a very strange thing\nabout near-death experiences that is I\nthink has been under\nexplored your identity preceded your\nbiologic expression and will follow your\nbiologic expression as your body but\nyour you when we begin Health at that\npoint of realizing that's a permanent\ncondition\nthat can't be destroyed by biologic\nprocesses that's your original math\nthat's the vibration you're going to\nfollow\nfor me that's the anatomy of the Soul\na soul is something that has been\ncaptured by the religious world to\ndescribe the thing that will supersede\nyour life\nbut on the science side it is perhaps a\ngreat description of the energy field\nthat allows you to organize in your\nmother's womb at the beginning your one\ncell that starts to divide just like a\ntumor divides\nand then settling around replication 260\nyou start to differentiate and suddenly\na cell becomes a kidney cell or a\nneurologic cell or whatever it's going\nto become and not only does it become a\nunique cell it knows where to migrate to\nin a three-dimensional map to become\nthat organ system\nand we cannot find that map in a in this\ninside the human cell or in biology that\nmap seems to be in the physics field\nwhich is to say in the electromagnetic\nfield which is say in the space between\neverything\nyour body is solid as it appears to me\nright now is 99.999 vacuum space\nfilled with an electromagnetic field\nwhich is super dense that organizes the\nreality of tissue around it then this\nsolid is organized by the vacuum\nand so that thing that thing that\norganizes Jay Shetty every millionth of\na second to reorganize itself because\nyou disappear and reappear constantly\napproximately every millionth of a\nsecond and you keep being you you keep\ncoming back every millionth of a second\nso one million times a second I'm\nre-manifesting in front of you with a\nmap from that electromagnetic field so\nperhaps that's the anatomy of the Soul\nperhaps that's the thing that holds the\noriginal you\nand we have Set This World up for\ndis-ease by convincing you you're a\nwhole bunch of identities outside of\nyourself you're a son you're a father\nyou're a mother you're an employer\nyou're an employee you're a boss you're\nthis you're that bizarrely the more\naltruistic those titles get the more\nlikely they are to diverge you from self\nfor me that was the title doctor\nthat the whole world wanted to make me\nfeel like that was the most important\nthing I had accomplished and this is\nwhat gave me value in society and I\nspent a long bumpy 30 years since\ngetting that MD kind of in behind my\nname to realize it's not the thing it's\nnot me I'm something bigger than that I\nam something more true than a\ncompilation of somebody else's\ncurriculum and some doctors title\nand when you find that original\nvibration of this is me you become very\npotent you start to tune to something\nbigger than the biology would have you\nbelieve in\nand in that you start to do something\ndifferent with your relationship to\neverything and that's the a point\nJourney that we've put together for the\nJourney of intrinsic Health which is our\nprogram that we've been helping answer\nthat question how do you get to health\nthese eight steps are laid out in this\nthis eight week journey and it's about\nthat change of relationship to your food\nto actually water water is really kind\nof backwards as to our understanding of\nhow we hydrate and what water is\nand then we also get confused about our\nbreath and our relationship so each each\nlittle respiration we take we've we're\nconfused about what it happens when we\nfast and what is that positive stress on\nthe neurologic system look like confused\nabout exercise we do exercise kind of\nbackwards as well and so it's reforming\nthe relationship to all these lifestyle\nthings that have been you've been told\nare important but when you go and do the\nthing that's important you don't get\nhealthier and that was a big question\nmark for all of us in the medical field\nlike we know people should exercise and\nyet when we tell people who are\noverweight and diabetic to go exercise\nthey don't actually consistently lose\nweight and they very rarely improve\ntheir diabetes why is that we know\nmovement is important and yet it's not\nworking and I think it's because of this\nexternalization of everything and so\nsince you're not you and you're this\nexternal representation of yourself your\nrelationship to all these things food\nmovement breath fasting the rest are all\nbackwards as well and so this is the\na-week journey into the obvious but in a\ncompletely new lens of everything's\ngoing to go internal instead of\nexternally sought after and that's\nchanged a lot of everything and it's\nallowed me to close my physical Clinic\nwhere I was seeing one in patient at a\ntime and go to a coaching model where we\nare witness to the healing process\nrather than mandating the healing\nprocess rather than the prescriptive\nprocess of an MD writing down eight\nprescriptions and saying this will make\nyou better\nrealizing that can never make anybody\nbigger better because those\nprescriptions are eight external you\nknow stimuli that have absolutely\nnothing to do with the root cause of\ntheir disease and so this has been an\nexciting journey of reversing out of my\neducation and into the realization that\nthere's nothing more beautiful and\npotent than a human being in their own\nfield in their own self in their own\noriginal math I'd love to dive into some\nof those eight if it's okay because I\nthink identity is such a cool one which\nyou just touched on beautifully there\nyou touched on water there I'd love to\nunderstand a bit more about\nthat because I think that's kind of like\nnot even talked about I've barely heard\nI know I know my wife's I I always call\nmy wife a water snob because she's very\nvery careful about what do we drink and\nwhat do we you know shower with and\neverything else but if you could guide\nus to understanding what you're sharing\nin your eight week program around water\nat least as a high level could you guide\nus through that right now when we think\nabout liquid water we tend to think of\nthis stuff in this glass here and tastes\ngood to drink it feels good to drink\nwhen it's clean and it has this kind of\nrefreshing quality to it for a lot of us\nbut my body is 70 water and not a single\nounce of that is in this form the vast\nmajority of the water within my body is\nactually in a crystalline structure if\nyou've ever seen Jello eating jello made\nJello you see liquid turn into a solid\nand that gel like structure with hidden\nJello is the result of complex Crystal\nstructures of the water organizing\nitself around proteins\nand that's how I hold water and it turns\nout that my biologic age and my\nlikelihood of disease correlates\nperfectly with how much Crystal water do\nI hold that Crystal water is holding\nsomething within it and it's light in a\nvery amazing biologic phenomenon this\nplanet is able to capture solar energy\nin chlorophyll which are tiny little\nmitochondria that live inside of plants\nlittle bacteria and these chlorophyll\nhave been able to take CO2 and turn it\ninto batteries\nand the battery is a long chain of\ncarbon double carbon bond is the most\nefficient battery ever invented by\nNature that takes no energy to maintain\nThe Light Within that so sunlight is\ncaptured between two CO2 molecules and\nthen eight and then 12 and these long\ncarbon chains and then we digest those\nby consuming food and we liberate\nglucose sugars carbohydrates fatty acids\nand and the oils in our foods and we\npackage that up in our liver and send it\nout to every cell in the body and it\nturns out the human cells don't know how\nto use any of that glucose or fatty\nacids there's no mechanism for releasing\nthe sunlight so it has to pass it down\nto the mitochondria living inside our\ncells so it's basically the\nmitochondrion plants communicating\npotential energy to the mitochondria\nwithin us\nthose mitochondria start breaking apart\nthe CO2 and start releasing sunlight\nback into the cellular matrix and that's\nwhat's being held within the crystal\nstructure of water\nand it turns out that when I drink water\nlike this I'm doing very little to\nsupport the crystalline structure within\nmy cells for this to turn into a crystal\nit takes a complex relationship to a\nvast array of salts mineral amino acid\ncomplexes and protein structures\nand that's where we kind of lost the\nhydration story\nif I drink this water it's going to feel\ngood it's going to feel like I'm\nhydrating myself for a few minutes but\nI'm going to pee this out in the next 45\nminutes It'll if I haven't emptied my\nbladder it will be sitting in my bladder\nit's no longer in my body it's outside\nof my body again because this pure water\nhas no Reservoir\nin my body it has to pass quickly\nthrough my bloodstream back to the\nkidneys and get out to my urine\nand so the journey into health is really\na rediscovery of how do you get water\ninto the crystal stage and that it's a\ncomplex journey in some ways but it is\nan exciting premise to begin with as I\nneed to be more full of Light how do I\nbecome more full of light so that I'm\nmore vital so I can repair at a faster\nrate than ever before because there's\nmore poisons in my environment than any\nother time in human history I need more\ncrystalline structure and so we\nreevaluate water at that that Journey\nfrom your gut into the crystal form\ninside your cells where it turns into\nthat gel battery storage place for that\nlight Liberation from the sunlight\nfor the animation of life to happen and\nso that's a little bit of a nutshell of\na lot more content that can be drilled\ninto but that's a little bit of that\nflip on the head of water yeah\nabsolutely I mean\nand you said you can actually test\nyou can actually see your age through\nthe quality of that crystalline\nstructure you can test for that how do\nyou test for that the easiest way to\ntest for is a relatively old technology\nit's called a phase angle calculation\nbut you use an impedance monitor which\nis a description of just measurement of\nresistance and it looks like EKG leads\nif you've ever seen an EKG 12 leads\naround the heart and all that stuff\nthey're sticky little pads you'll put\none on the wrist one on the forefinger\none on the ankle one on the toe and then\nyou lay perfectly flat and you measure\nacross that column of water that's now\nat a an equal lateral level to the Earth\nand to the gravity you measure the\namount of electrical resistance across\nthat column and from that you can\ncalculate based on body weight and your\nheight and all this stuff how much water\nis inside every cell\nand when you calculate that then you get\na very good biologic age and biologic\nestimate of Your vitality an ideal phase\nangle is up around 10 12. I've never\nseen anybody at 10 or 12. the healthiest\npatients walking my clinic are typically\naround a seven or an eight on their\nphase angle anybody coming in with the\nC's let's go with cancer for for the end\npoint there is typically around a four\ndeath happens at 3.5\nand so what I just told you is ideal\nhealth is 10.\ndeath is 3.5 and cancer shows up at 4.\nand here we're telling everybody they're\ndying of cancer as it turns out when you\nlook at the simple reality of water\ninside a cell\ncancer is one of the last symptoms of a\ncomplete disconnect from the energetics\nof Life cancer happens when you no\nlonger are connected to the energy of\nthat plant of that chlorophyll of that\nsunlight that charged life in the first\nplace and so that's where we go with\nthis eight-week journey is where did it\nbreak down how did you go from 10 to 3\nhow did you get from ten to four\nwhatever it is and then how do we start\nto back you up that track of crystalline\nwater how do we get your body to hold\nmore light energy so that you're more\nvital so that you accelerate every\nenzyme process detoxification repair\nregeneration protein structures\nthroughout all matrices all of that\nhappens automatically when the light\ngoes up\nyou mentioned a product earlier the the\ngut supplement you probably got put on\nby your nutritionist but the journey\ninto that phenomenon was our\nunderstanding of soil and food and how\ndid it break down so quickly was the\nquestion we were trying to answer how\ndid we go from 1992 to 2002 that 10 year\nsaw the complete dissolution of human\nhealth across all ages across all organ\nsystems in a 10-year period across all\npeoples really that were touching\nWestern Civilization Western Food\nSystems\nand in that Journey we discovered\nglyphosate and glyphosate is the primary\nherbicide or weed killer in the vast\nmajority 90 plus percent of the weed\nkillers on the planet\nwe now spend you know billions of\ndollars a year spraying this thing into\nour environment we have an estimated 4\nbillion pounds of glyphosate being\nsprayed into our Soil and Water Systems\nworldwide and it turns out as our\nlaboratory has been studying this\ncompound for a decade now every time you\ntouch human cell systems with glyphosate\nit dissolves the communication between\nthem\nit disconnects you from the boundary of\nBeing Human and it dissolves that to the\npoint where you don't know where your\nbegin or end of human biology and UBS\nyour immune system has to turn on to\nfight everything\nso you were eating pretty healthy you\nwere exercising you were living a pretty\naffluent lifestyle compared to the rest\nof the World perhaps and yet you weren't\nthriving because there was a chemical\nnow in your food that was dissolving the\nboundary event and your energy was now\nleaking out of your body quite literally\nwe've popularized the term leaky gut but\nit's much deeper than that that is\nhappening at the individual cell level\nthat's leaking light leaking water\noutside of itself if you can't hold that\ncrystalline water you can't hold the\nVitality the energetics of the plants\nyou're eating of the nutrition you're\neating and so you start to fade with\nyour energy levels and with less energy\nyou repair less well and you start into\nthis chronic disease that happened\nbetween 1992 and 2002 chronic fatigue\nsymptoms chronic pain everything\nmentioned and so that was your personal\njourney and then you got put on a\nsupplement what what is that supplement\nit's not actually a traditional\nsupplement those supplements are like\npieces of the nutrition Cascade of a\nvitamin or mineral or protein or\nwhatever it is this is way way Upstream\nthis is not a nutrient this is in fact\nthe the small carbon molecules that form\na redox signaling system which is a\nfancy word for a wireless communication\nNetwork between your cells\nthere's two ways cells can communicate\none is through hard fiber optic cables\nthey can pass light energy back and\nforth for communication and the other\none is through this more ethereal\nWireless Communications similar to your\ncell phone your cell phone sits there\nall the time with a complex transmitter\nin there a transceiver really can\nreceive and transmit tiny little signals\nbut it has to be picked up by a cell\nphone tire that will propagate that\ninformation in that distance so I can\ntalk to my grandmother\nfor me to talk 3000 miles away I need\nlots and lots of connections between all\nthose cell towers to to Cascade through\nto carry that message\nif you lose one cell tower nearby you\nyour cell phone selling doesn't work\nnothing broke and the cell phone is an\nimportant real reality it just can't\nreach the bigger system and so the\ndisease of today is not actually a\ndisease of a single cell it's a failure\nof that wireless communication Network\nand so when a single cell gets injured\nnow it can't send out the signal of hey\nI'm I'm injured I need repair and it\nsits there and accumulates injury\nand without accumulation of injury we\nreach cancer cancer is a single human\ncell that has 20 000 unrepaired genetic\ninjuries in it and so this journey\ntowards cancer is not only a loss of\nelectric light and light potential it's\na loss of communication and loss of that\nregenerative potential and so we now\nhave a whole society of humans a billion\nof us that are losing our light we are\ndimming and we are losing our our cell\ncell communication the cell phone towers\nare going down and we cannot repair\nbut nature always prepares for the worst\nand the antidote it turns out to the\ndeath of communication which is\nhappening at the human level is actually\nthe microbiome which is a term that's\nnow thrown around a lot and I think we\nall have a vague understanding I think\nthat's like bacteria or something but\nreally what it's describing is complex\necosystems it's thousands if not tens of\nthousands if not millions of different\nspecies of bacteria fungi protozoa and\nhuman cells alike all getting into this\ncoherent communication Network and so\nthe microbiome is a description of a\ncomplex landscape of biodiversity and\neach of those microbes bacteria fungi\nprotozoa and the like are making another\nvariant of these small carbon snowflakes\nand when those carbon snowflakes go into\na liquid state into the aqueous state of\nyour bloodstream or into that\nsemi-aqueous state of the gel within\nyour cells they're able to transmit\ninformation long distances and so we\nstarted extracting these from fossil\nsoils before the last Extinction 60\nmillion years ago again 30 foot top soil\nlevels the healthiest microbiome the\nplanet has ever seen and so we tap back\ninto the fossil layer of soil and start\nextracting that communication Network\nand the first time we put this on human\ncells was 2012 and I got to see in my\nlab which was rudimentary at the time\nsome of the most ridiculous things\nhappen in a Petri dish that I just\ndidn't even believe possible\nand it was a journey from style opinion\nasking questions about the cancer cells\nwe were talking and are asking questions\nand studying too\nhealthy biology is that are we\nwitnessing Health in a Petri dish is\nthat's what's really happening because\nso many things we're fixing and\nrepairing at such a rate I never\nimagined before\nand so it's been a very exciting journey\nto realize that the Earth has coded into\nher deep fossil soils\na communication Network that can help us\nout of our crisis that can help us\nBeyond this isolation of the single\nhuman cell and ultimately the isolation\nof a single human species back into an\ninterpretive dance with life itself this\nvast biology within us and around us is\nready to re-engage we just need those\ncell phone phone towers up and running\nbut in our bodies and that's what\nhappened to you when you started ion\nyeah no thank you for explaining that\nit's it's incredible how\nlittle we know I mean when I'm listening\nto you I'm just thinking to myself I'm\nlike we just we just don't know enough\nand individually and collectively as\nwell but\none of the things you talked about water\nwe talked about a bit about microbiome\nwhich I want to get back into but\na big area that you're focusing on is\nsoil regeneration I think that's been\nsomething that's\nbeen more recently talked about as\nopposed to something that we've thrown\naround as you were saying about the\nmicrobiome but\ntalk us through that very key element of\nthe environment and again if you can\ngive us that sort of synopsis version as\nyou did with water for us to just\nunderstand the value of that because I\nwant people to go and follow you and\nfigure out through your work the depths\nof everything we're discussing today but\nI think at least for the benefit of this\nconversation If people could get a sense\nof\njust the breadth of\nareas that we may not be considering a\nnegatively impacting our health just as\nyou said I had no idea when I was taking\nion\nyou know what was really going on behind\nthe scenes I want to step in that first\npoint for you too you made the statement\nthat we don't know enough and that's how\nI felt most My Life as a doctor that's\nwhat led to seven years of higher\neducation and chasing that proverbial\nknowledge that I'd feel less afraid I\nfeel like my whole world has just\nflipped on its head in the last 15 years\nto the point where I now realize I know\neverything\nbut I don't know it up in my head\nI have access to information throughout\nthe cosmos through something deeper than\nmy mind and that's again where you are\nacting from in your career and not just\nin your career with your interaction\nwith humans in general your recent book\non human relationships\nnot just relationship between two human\ncells to human beings how do we start to\nrelate differently than we have in the\npast\nand that journey I think is really\nexciting to realize we actually know\neverything if we listen inside and this\nis the experience I'm sure you had in\nthose few years living as a monk and\neverything else when you spend more time\nin silence than you do talking you find\nyou know so much and it's not something\nup in your head it's not an intelligence\nit's a connection\nthe real truth within you will be\nremembered rather than discovered\nand so that is an exciting journey into\nlet's take a deep breath and realize\nnobody knows about Crystal water and\nnobody knows about all this stuff and it\ndoesn't matter because ultimately it\nshows the layers that I can show you in\nour laboratory will give you a glimpse\nof beauty that you may not have been\nrealizing in but how you get to that\nbeauty is something you all innately\nknow your relationship to your water to\nyour food and ultimately to your soil an\nultimate to your planet is something\nthat precedes human intellect human\nconsciousness and so we are now in a\nstate of being where we can actually\nrealize okay if everything existed our\ncapacity to become human existed before\nthe moment we were human what does that\nmean for our connection to the Future\nit's already here it's already connected\nit's already manifesting through the\nGenome of the viruses through the\ngenetic potential of the planet itself\nit's already here so not only do I know\nmyself right now I have access to\ninformation of the future because it's\nalready coded foreign that hasn't quite\nyet appeared but the information is\nalready there the same way I can\nremember the past because it's coded for\nin my genes than all the trauma all the\nremembrances all the experience of my\nancestors it coded for my genetic code\nit's not in my head it's within every\nsingle cell of my body resonating in a\ncrystalline structure that we would call\nthe fourth phase of water and we\nresonate in that Liquid Crystal state\nto no self and then to express self\nwithin that Matrix so deep breath for\nall of us right now this part of the\npodcast of like you know what we're\nconnected to all of it we don't need to\nknow it in our heads because we already\nhave access to it beautiful yeah then\nthe soil so how does the soil come into\nimportance a soil is a living life form\nthe most complex living life form on the\nplanet and in life itself as we\nunderstand and we've never measured a\nmore beautiful system of than the soil a\nteaspoon of soil has more organisms than\nour humans on the entire planet a\nteaspoon and so that there's a\ncomplexity and a Brilliance and a beauty\nof that living ecosystem of soil that\ndwarfs our current understanding of Cell\nBiology we don't we can't actually\nmeasure in a Petri dish the behavior\neight billion different species and a\nteaspoon of soil because we haven't\ndeveloped good enough scientific\nmeasures and fast enough computers to\ncompute that much information so fast so\nwe tend to study one species of bacteria\nand make a whole bunch of conclusions\nthat maybe it's bad for us\nwell this whole concept of bad bacteria\nand good bacteria of the probiotics is\nreally dissolved now we realize there is\nno such thing as a good bacteria or a\nbad bacteria there's only a healthy\necosystem or a monoculture\nmonoculture or the death of biodiversity\nis is the demise of life\nthey push towards biodiversity is the\nMatrix of health and it is unfortunate\nthat over the last hundred years we've\ndeveloped a deep economic and you know\nphysical labor dependence on chemicals\nfor our farming and agriculture these\nchemicals destroy the biodiversity of\nevery ounce of soil we put these\nchemicals on they function as\nantibiotics glyphosate that most common\nof herbicides has been patented as an\nantibiotic anti-fungal antiparasite it\nliterally demolishes life within the\nsoil that it touches and yet this is\nwhat farmers are trained to use we\ngenetically modified all of our seeds so\nthat the food would be sprayed\nrepeatedly through its lifespan with\nthat chemical and so Roundup Ready seeds\nmeans poison tolerant food system\nbut when as a microbiome you're not\nprepared for that poison or as a\nconsumer as an animal Upstream you're\nnot prepared for that injury you become\npoisoned in a way in which you are right\nnot Roundup Ready neither was your\nmicrobiome in your gut which is your\nsoil system\nand so all this focus on gut health of\nthe last 10 years is simply a\ndescription of soil is important it's\nwhere life comes from Life comes out of\nbiodiversity and relationship\ncooperation of biodiverse inputs region\nof Agriculture is a description of this\nrevolution that is afoot that we are\nparticipating in our non-profit Farmer's\nfootprint has been part of this effort\nto increase awareness and learning and\nimpact and Innovation around the\nopportunity for Farmers to shift away\nfrom the belief that they're there to\ngrow bushels of corn and instead they're\nthere to grow life within their soil\nsystems and when every day they wake up\nasking how can I create more life and\ndiversity within my soils instead of\nwhat can I kill today which is what\nchemical farming is which invasive weeds\nare now attacking what you know I ICU\nlife support do I need to put my farm on\noh gosh I'm out of all these nutrients\nso I need to intravenously inject all\nthese nutrients with all these chemical\ninputs it's an ICU condition in The Firm\njust as an ICU condition in my Hospital\nand so this is a journey really into\nrealizing that we are doing ICU care\nbecause we lost the Matrix of life which\nis biodiversity which is the soil within\nyour gut soil beneath your feet and it's\nexciting to realize that we can\nparticipate this at every level\nif we walk out in your yard right now\nyou have an American lawn and an\nAmerican lawn is the third largest crop\ngrown in the United States there are 40\nmillion Acres of lawn Kentucky Bluegrass\ngrown in this country there's only 120\nmillion Acres of Farmland 40 million\nAcres of grass so that it looks nice or\nwhatever it is we have lots of reasons\nconvenient you can just mow it whatever\nif we were to take that 40 million Acres\nof lawn and convert that to food forests\nin our backyards front yards and the\nrest we would never go hungry in in the\nnext 70 Generations there could not be\nhunger because we would have so much\nfood bursting from every yard\nin World War II we came close we had\nlost the food system we had lost Supply\nchains we lost economics and so we were\ngrowing our food in our backyards Again\nby 1945 Americans and the British and\nLondon and the rest were growing 45\npercent of their food system in their\nbackyard Victory Gardens we called them\nVictory Gardens because the campaign was\nif we don't grow your own food we're all\ngoing to lose the war\nif you grow your own food we will be\nvictorious Russians long knew this\nRussians had really built really complex\nsystems of what we call today peasant\nfarming systems where there's a lot of\nredundancy and a lot of hyper local\nmarketplaces for Food Systems Russians\nsurvived some of the worst fast\nstarvation events in in history during\nWorld War II and they won the war\nagainst the Third Reich for their\nresilience and a lot of that resilience\nwas their Connection in nature their\nproximity to their food system the\nGermans ultimately failed because they\nhad 3 000 miles Supply chains and their\nfood couldn't get to them today the\nUnited States of America is failing\nbecause we have 3 000 mile Supply chains\nthe food that's not grown here in this\ncountry anymore because all of our soil\nis dead the cost of putting seed in the\nground now exceeds the cost that they\ncan be sold for\nand so we have all these governed\nsubsidies to keep telling Farmers to\nplant genetically modified crops and put\nthem under dollar expensive you know\nhigh intensity inputs which is bankrupt\nroutine basically every farm and they're\nall on life support economically getting\nthese subsidies that we call USDA crop\ninsurance and all these fake things\nboosting up dead soil dead dirt\nand so if there is a belief of Homeland\nSecurity if there's really a belief of\nnations are you know capable of of\nsafety you have to begin at the soil and\npresidents long back have recognized\nthis Franklin Delano Roosevelt said the\nfuture of every country is in their soil\nand he said that because we were in the\nDust Bowl which was a Devastation of our\ntop soils due to poor farming practices\nand we were starving as a nation my\ngrandfather worked in the white house\nwith the Roosevelts and his he was the\nhead of philanthropy in the New Deal in\ngetting this soup kitchens rebuilt and\nso traveling around with Eleanor\nRoosevelt serving suit lines that were\nmiles long of people starving in this\ncountry because their topsoil had died\nso twice in a single Century we've\ndestroyed our top soils through poor\nunderstanding of biology originally and\nnow a codependence on chemical farming\nand antibiotics as a mechanism for\ngrowing food and so for that we have 3\n000 miles Supply chains and every city\nhas now become a really vulnerable\nIsland and we saw that in the pandemic\nsuddenly grocery store shelves empty\nbecause the ships couldn't get into the\nports the trucks had stopped driving and\nthere was no food on shelves is a very\ndesperate situation we're in the United\nStates but unfortunately we have\nexported that behavior of Food Systems\nto the entire developed World London is\nnow as vulnerable as the United States\nand the rest Paris as vulnerable Los\nAngeles where we sit today has a\nthree-day food supply\nto millions and millions of people and\nso if an earthquake happens and disrupts\nthe one highway system that comes into\nLos Angeles\nwe will lose our food supply in three\ndays and we will have a massive riot in\nhumanitarian crisis on our hands we are\nan island unto ourselves and our food is\n3000 miles away and we're not realizing\nit\ninstead we have 40 million Acres of\ngrass that we can't eat and we're\nspraying that with Roundup in our\nbackyards to kill the few dandelions\nwhich are the only edible and\nanti-cancer compound that's in your\nbackyard right now and so we need to\nstart realizing we need to eat that\ndandelion green not the dandelion flower\neven before it flowers you're eating\nthat green and you're getting the\nnutrients and you're getting life back\nin and and you go beyond that and you\nsay let's get some beets and turnips and\nall the rest let's get some other root\nvegetables in there and suddenly your\nyour backyard could turn into a bounty\nof safety for your family for your\ncommunity and the rest and so this is\nthe paradigm shift that farmers\nfootprint is really working on is can we\nrealize how vulnerable we've made\nourselves as individuals not just to the\nbiological of our chronic disease but\nalso the societal level as we have\ndivorced ourselves from soil is there\nany way I mean hearing that is there any\nway\nto have an optimal life still eating\nfrom a supermarket like the idea that\nyou know I'm I'm assuming that the\nmajority of people listening are not\ngoing to rush to\nstart growing something in their\nbackyard not that they should not and\nnot that we're not encouraging it I\nthink it's incredible when people can\nbut\nagain going back to that conditioning\nhabit formation all the challenges that\ncome with that what can we eat or how do\nwe eat in order to protect ourselves\nwell we learned it in Spades during the\npandemic you might remember there was a\nmoment where we every place in the in\nthe country sold out of seeds and so we\nstarted growing again and we're seeing a\nvery exciting movement in young people\nright now A lot of people are leaving\nthe cities to go start farming they've\nnever farmed before they have absolutely\nno idea but they have this deep\nknowingness inside of them that I'm\nsupposed to get not just to a farm but\nI'm supposed to build community around\nthat farm so I'm going to take me and my\nbest 10 friends and we're gonna move out\ninto the country and we're gonna start\nfarming and the regenerative\nagricultural movement has been LED\nmostly by women and mostly by youth in\nthis country and so there's a real\nmovement not just here but now as we've\nspawned Farmers footprint in UK Farmers\nfootprint Australia the Western world is\nstarting to reimagine its relationship\nto food and soil and it's really the\nwomen and and the youth that are finding\nthis path forward for us and it's\nbecause I think deep inside of that\nfeminine archetype that we all have\naccess to male female arrest that\nfeminine archetype is about nurture and\nit is about connection and that's\nultimately what I believe the\nregenerative agriculture movement is in\none word it is a reconnect it is a\nreconnect to Nature and there's many\nways to do it and there's not a\nprescription for here's a regenerative\nFarm it's about listening into your\nnature listening into the reality that's\ntrying to express itself on that piece\nof land and then being in support of\nthat rather than trying to micromanage\nthat thing\nand so that's a very much a feminine\narchetype we can all connect to is how\ndo we let life start coming into our\nlives in a biodiverse fashion\nit doesn't necessarily have to happen\njust at the food and the soil can happen\nwith your community and the inputs\nyou're taking on if you're input every\nday is CNN or Fox News you're gonna\nbecome a mono crop almost immediately\nyou're going to lose all biodiversity of\ninformation you're going to become very\nmonotonous in your belief systems you're\ngoing to be very easy to push into a\nsmall box of fear guilt and shame\nif you go out in nature and spend hours\na day hiking and walking through nature\nand smelling real soil and touching\nFerns and being in awe of the Wildflower\nand bathing in a waterfall\nyou can't be put in the same box because\nyou are seeing the complexity and beauty\nof nature that predated our existence\nlet alone the existence of a television\nor a News Channel or whatever it is and\nso the excitement is for me is as far as\nway as this might sound to you right now\nto be growing your own food all this\ntime you're just a few seconds away from\nyour introduction to that universe\nget out to a park\nforget a park even lay down in in\nsomebody's yard that has a tree if you\nlay down on your back and look up\nthrough the branches of a tree at a blue\nsky that has clouds passing over your\nbrain will start to rewire just with\nthat light pattern that's coming through\nthat tree because in that it's like\nlooking into a fire if you can't do the\ntree stare into a fire at night if you\ncan't do a fire stare into a candle\nbecause in the frequencies of those\ninputs into our neurology we we put in\ninformation in the form of Storytelling\na recent study demonstrated that if we\nlook down at a fire picture of fireplace\nbetween us here if we look down at a\nfire around a campfire the like all the\nstem cells in our bodies turned on they\ntry to figure out like how is how are\nstem cells being activated by the fire\nand turned out that it had it had to do\nwith not just the fire and its presence\nbut our our eye trajectory too if I\nlooked past the fire and didn't look\ninto the fire my stem cells didn't turn\non but if I dropped my gaze away from\nthe Horizon and looked down at the fire\nmy stem cells turned on\nand I believe it's a story of instead of\nchasing the future on the horizon we\nneed to look down into\nthe energy that is between us this fire\nthat sits between us we look down for a\nmoment become present instead of future\nlooking to that Horizon we can become\npresent enough to sit in Stillness and\nwatch that that vibrational experience\nof a red coal glowing and pulsing in the\nnight there's something in that that\nremembers ourselves\nand it was around those fires that we\nsang our first songs danced our first\ndances and told our first stories as\nhumanity and that runs all the way to\nthat today the place I have felt as an\nEarthling for the first time in my\nhalf a century it's in the African bush\naround fire listening to African drums\nhearing the vibration of voices and\ntongues that I have forgotten existed\nand remembering that I find my Humanity\nagain I realize I am from here I do\nbelong here and I am of this place\nthat is remembered around a fire looking\ndown and so gather around a candle or\nfire whatever it is and start to tell\nstories again of Things Remembered or of\nyesterday if you need to but start\ntelling story around flame and that is\nmaybe your journey back into growing a\npiece of food yourself in your backyard\nthere's going to be a deep remembrance\nof you of this is what peace feels like\nthis is what that pause does staring\ninto the flame you can find the silence\nnecessary to find that guiding\nsense within you that we call intuition\nthat guiding sense that you have\nfollowed in your career to bring you to\nthe success you've had and so we all\nhave that immediately available before\nwe've even grown our own food before\nwe've grown anything all of that is\nintact\nand I have again and again seen people\non the deathbed as a hospice doctor I\nwas admitting 80 patients a week to die\nso I've seen a lot of things that we\ncall death and even when biology is\ncompletely failing and they have a few\nheartbeat breeds left a few breaths yet\nto take\nthey can get into that fire moment\nand they are crossing the veil on their\nback again they're crossing the veil and\nthey're coming back and then they open\ntheir eyes and it happens so so often\nsomebody who's been kind of in this\ncomatose you know milieu have barely\nhere suddenly comes Crystal Clear looks\nyou in the face and says a deep truth\nthat may or may not make sense as you\nthe receiver but in saying it you can\nsee them reconnect to their original\nSelf and they are more true to\nthemselves in that moment of death than\nthey ever were in our state of living in\nin a\nstate of disconnect\nand so it it doesn't matter how close\nyou are to death that fire light is\nburning inside of you if not in front of\nyou and in the silence in front of that\nfire you can remember why you came here\nand why you did what you did on purpose\nis your show\nand it turns out purpose is not outside\nof you it's not something to go find\nit's not something to go discover that\npurpose is you being you\nthat original math that vibrates to\nanimate your biology into a living life\nform for a moment\nthat we would call a human lifespan\nyou're vibrating there and the purpose\nis to be you in this form to take in the\nlight energy of the cosmos of the food\nyou eat and express it in Vitality\nwithin that Liquid Crystal of your body\nto vibrate it's the vibration that makes\nyou alive\nand that vibration can be shaped by your\nthoughts your beliefs the words you\ncarry and the feelings that you have\ntowards one another\nand so this is our moment right now is\nwe can burn bright at our death moment\non our death bed 60 years 80 years left\nhowever long is there on our margin of\nthat we can rebirth now to come off of\nhospice and become a new species become\na new Humanity become a new expression\nas we lose fear guilt and shame because\nwe look past the death that we all fear\nand realize that life is abundant and\nit's infinite and it's always in its\nnext transformation next expression\nwhich is always chasing more Beauty and\nmore intelligence than the rest and so\nwe sit here around a fire now talking\nabout the demise of all things\nto realize the birth of everything I\nfind your response is so refreshing\nthere is such a Rejuvenation and rebirth\nhearing the ideas that you're sharing\nwith the world because I can definitely\npersonally attest to so many of the\nthings that you're mentioning whether\nit's lying down under the tree looking\nthrough the branches whether it's\ndeeply Excavating and looking at the\nroots of a plant whether it's looking\nout into the sky or Cloud gazing which\nis probably one of my favorite things to\ndo which is why I live where I live or\nwhether it may be just feeling\nreconnected one of my favorite things\nwas when my wife and I went to Hawaii a\nfew years ago\nand we fell in love with it because we\nfelt the people there had their own\nlanguage for a culture that we've\nlearned differently so having studied\nThe Vedas\nthe worship of the Sun and the Moon are\nsuch big parts of The Vedas and when we\nwere in Hawaii we would go out on a\nkayak every morning and pay our respects\nto the sun and it always felt beautiful\nto do it in the Hawaiian culture and\nthrough their traditions and I\nremembered\nwe walked around where they were showing\nus the paragraphs and the writings and\nthe stories on the Rock and\nthere was this one particular one which\nrepeated itself which was a expanding\nCircle and it was said that\nwhenever a child is born in Hawaii it's\numbilical cord is placed on the earth\nand a circle is drawn around it in that\nvery spot so they can always come back\nto that and remember that they're always\nconnected to the Earth and that's where\nthey belong it's incredible how these\nvery simple ideas can be so sacred and\nso powerful as you said internally if\nyou feel these things don't necessarily\nmake sense in your head or\nyou can't compute them in a logical\nreasoning point of view but but you can\nfeel them even when we were there you\ncould you could see it and you could\nfeel it\nyou mentioned twice there you mentioned\nat the beginning breath as one of the\nelements you then mentioned it again\nwhen people are in their last breath\ncould you walk us through the same kind\nof refreshing\nInsight on breath the mechanism of\nbreathing is the the allowance to create\nnew life and we exhale so that we can\nbreathe back in and if you've ever been\ntold suddenly in an audience like okay\neverybody inhale\nit's very hard to inhale because they\ndidn't tell you to Exhale and so to\nreally take a good inhalation you got to\ntell the whole audience all right\neverybody exhale blow it all out blow it\nI'll upload it now you can inhale\nand in that exhalation you're basically\nexchanging the the life force with the\nenvironment around you when I exhale I\npush out\nmillions of different little tiny\nvariants of my genetics through\nsomething called micro RNA it's\nbasically my my version of expressing a\nviral message the world of here here's\nwho I am right now here's what I'm\nexpressing genetically here's what's\nhappening so I have a genetic signal\nthat I breathe out and I have a new\npotential for life that I breathe out in\nthe form of carbon dioxide that I just\nderived from all the glucose and fatty\nacids that I'm deriving all of that\nsunlight from so I'm releasing sunlight\nand then I give back the CO2 to the\natmosphere so I can breathe it back in\nand turns out I need CO2 exchange I need\nto breathe it as much as I need to\nExhale in because it's really the the\npulse of life and it's the way in which\nI use oxygen at the cellular level so I\ncan't use oxygen unless I've got CO2 so\nI breathe out a big gift of CO2 and the\natmosphere gives me back CO2 in an in a\nratio that allows me to use oxygen more\neffectively and so CO2 is really the\ncoercing bloodstream of of life itself\nit's the the currency of life\nand so that currency of energy is\npulsing with every breath and when I\nstart to develop a an addiction to\nbreathing I don't take that deep breath\nand instead I have all these short\nlittle breasts that I take all the time\nbecause I'm in a fight or flight State\nand I don't slow that respiration down\nmy neurology is reading all the time\npanic\nand so in the same way that we're\naddicted to water that can never turn\ninto a liquid Crystal and therefore\nwe're always thirsty in the same way I\nalways taking all you know 16 to 20\nbreaths a minute because I'm afraid I'm\ngoing to run out of air because I\nhaven't been taught to actually breathe\nand so the planet is now doing this as\nwell as humans\nthe planet can't take a deep breath\nright now because its lungs are the soil\nsystem\nwe've now killed 97 percent of the soil\nsystems the planet 97 of arable soils on\nthe planet are now depleted or severely\ndepleted of their metabolism their\nability to breathe\nyou know ideal State this planet\nbreathes in a deep breath at night and\nthen exhales in the morning\nand you can watch this happen especially\nin humid areas I live in Virginia and\nalong the Blue Ridge Mountains at night\nif you stand up high on the mountains\nyou get to see that the The Forest of\nVirginia breathe in and these it looks\nlike Banks of of clouds suddenly get\nsucked down onto the surface of the\ntrees and then down into the canopy and\ndown into the Earth\nand so the trees are returning the\nbreath to the soil and with it all the\nwater\nin the morning it exhales and all that\nwater appears on the surface as Dew on\nthe grass and in the canopy and\neverywhere well that Dew is now very\ncold because it was breathed out by a\ndeep geothermal cooling thing that we\ncall the planet\nthe warming of the planet is not being\ncaused by CO2 or greenhouse gases we've\nbeen given a very half Truth by our\npolitical systems that with Al Gore and\nthe rest of co2s are crisis and we've\nnow pledged 40 trillion dollars by 2050\nto suck CO2 out of the asmares\natmosphere and all that because we've\nbeen told it's the problem\nbut in fact where there's a dying\npatient on the bedside you can no longer\nbreathe or me addicted to my short\nbreathing or the planet that's lost its\nlungs and now has emphysema CO2 starts\nRising the atmosphere and the heat goes\nup because we're not bringing that into\nthe Earth and out of the earth into the\nEarth out of the Earth on a daily basis\nto cool the planet\nwe lost the lungs therefore we lost the\nexchange of life through CO2 and we lost\nthe geothermal cooling that comes with\nbreath\nand so the planet has a fever not for\nCO2 but for a lack of breath\nand so this is the transit that we need\nto do as a planetary you know\nparticipant is we need to be part of the\nsolution we need to allow the Earth To\nBreathe Again\nI find it interesting that you know we\nalways find the micro story in the\nmacrocosm and you find it fractally\nwhich means that every single level of\nexpression of nature you'll find the\nsame truth and here we were in the\nmiddle of the pandemic where people were\ngoing blue because the oxygen could not\nexchange from their blood cells into\ntheir cells perhaps in part due to a\nvirus but deeper than that we had uh\ncovered our planet in the highest levels\nof carbon contamination in history\nbecause of the largest fires that had\nraged for for the year and a half before\nthe pandemic and then all the way\nthrough the pandemic we had the largest\nfires all over the world that ever\nhappened so for all the poisoning in the\natmosphere we had cyanide in the air\nlevels unprecedented we were breathing\nin Sinai which causes this respiratory\nfailure we were ascribing it again just\nto the virus but I think it was a lot of\ndifferent factors happening at that time\nwe were losing our ability to breathe\nmeanwhile the planet's warming up\nwarming up warming up and clgs going up\nin the atmosphere we can't breathe the\nplant can't breathe we couldn't breathe\nthe species and then we get this\nextraordinarily tragic moment where we\nwatch a police officer with his knee on\nthe neck of an African-American man and\nhe dies in the streets screaming I\ncannot breathe\nhad every one of those fractal levels we\ngot to witness the Suffocation of life\nand it was suffocating in that moment\nwith the police officer is too afraid to\nmove\nand maybe angry maybe lots of other\nnegative emotions in there but\nultimately it's fear fear of death fear\nof different being different fear of\neverything other than self\nso that knee stays on and right now we\nhave our proverbial knee on the neck of\nthis planet we are not letting this\nplanet breathe because we're afraid we\nmight go hungry so we're waiting for\ntechnology to save us so we have more\nand more genetic Technologies we have\nrobots trying to mine food out of the\nearth we're waiting for more and more\ntechnology and we just will not let the\nknee off the neck of the planet because\nwe're afraid she won't provide for us\nwe need to let the knee up we need to be\nconfident that we are one species that\nis the compilation of hundreds of\nthousands of species that has made life\npossible we need to start to breathe\ntogether we need to move to a point\nwhere there is Grace rather than fear\nwhere there is Joy rather than guilt\nthere is love rather than shame and to\nget there we're going to have to trust\nthat we are supposed to be here\nwe are not the cancer of the planet we\nare the potential energy of the planet\nwe are the highest expression that the\nplanet has made so far and we can stay\nto play if we choose and so we need to\ntake the neck off the planet we needed\nto take the take the knee off the neck\nof the planet take the knee off the neck\nof one another\nand start to move in a state of\nabundance and we will do this as we find\nthose quiet spikes around the flame\nbreathe slower breathe deeper\nas individuals as a planet\nand in so doing start to feel the future\nand this is the mystery that we see\nbaking all over the world I'm very\ngifted in my career right now that I get\nto travel all over the place all the\ntime\nand so that in there more than one and a\nhalf million miles I've flown over the\nlast 10 years I've gotten to meet nearly\nevery people group on the planet and\nI've spent time in so many continents\nover the last couple years\nand for all of the fear and guilt and\nshame that we just exercised as a plan\nthat I have never seen more optimism\nmore excitement more of that bubbling\nenergy of oh my gosh it's about to\narrive we are about to arrive something\nis about to happen this is so exciting\nto be alive right now I hear that all\nthe time it's so exciting to be alive\nright now\nso what is the light that's shining so\nbright in humanity as our biologic light\ndims\nI think it's the original math I think\nit's the soul\nthe energy that animates life is burning\nbright right now because it is not\ndiminished by the energies that it was\nputting into the biologic expression of\nhumanity it is burning brighter because\nit says look beyond the flesh to find\nthe truth and in that energy field you\nwill find the new life that will code\nfor your new future and so we have to\nget to that hospice moment we have to\nlet the lights almost die out so we can\ncross the veil and see the truth and\nthen come back and change everything\nIncredible Dr Zach Bush if anyone's\nlistening right now and they want to\nfind that optimism maybe during your\neight day program like to learn more\nabout the solution aspect of everything\nyou've been sharing today where should\nthey go how can they connect with you\nand connect with your work the easiest\nplace for all the work is Zach\nbushmd.com the Journey of intrinsic\nhealth.com is the eight week program the\nintelligence of nature.com is is all of\nthe deep soil science and the\nsupplements and everything else that\nhave come out of that soil science and\nthen the study of glyphosate and the\nsolutions to it\num there's an opportunity for you guys\nto engage also just in in community with\nus because uh it's one thing to take a\nsupplement or take a class but\nultimately if we don't come into\nconnected Community we're not going to\ncreate that future that we have and so\nthere's an opportunity for you to engage\nin the community platforms that we've\nbeen creating across many of these\nproducts going deeper than the product\nto to really start to create the\nsolutions for the future that are that\nwe can all feel is already here and\nthat's my greatest excitement is\nwatching people come together there's\nsomething called Quorum sensing that I\nfind really beautiful when you get\nenough biodiversity into a living\nenvironment suddenly the whole thing\ndoes something more intelligent than any\nconstituent can do and so we need to do\na quorum sensing moment as not just\nHumanity but as a planet and so we need\nto connect to our ecosystems and\ndiversity and cultures and for their\ndiversity the Arts and their diversity\nthe dance and the storytelling and the\nflames in a million different iterations\nthen we need to bring that in together\nfor a very bright flame to burn and for\nus to connect to that Quorum sensing\nmoment where we do Quantum intelligence\nnot from the mind but from that\nknowingness within you and it's in that\nCommunity connect that we've we hope to\nmeet you beautiful thank you so much I\nhope that everyone has been listening\nand watching I hope you go and check it\nout and Zach we end every episode of on\npurpose with a final five or a Fast Five\nand these questions have to be answered\nin one word to one sentence maximum and\nZach Burch these are your final fives so\nthe first is what is the best advice\nyou've ever heard given or received slow\ndown\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nheard or received stop moving stop\nmoving\nquestion number three what's something\nthat you used to value that you no\nlonger value anymore marriage\ninteresting\nin what sense you said one word yeah and\nnow I'm I'm digressing\nit was my most important value system uh\nthrough most of my life and uh it's not\nto say that marriage is not important on\nour human Journey\num but uh it was the course of Miracles\nthat really unveiled what was happening\nin my effort towards marriage and I\nenjoyed my marriage at a 20-year\nmarriage with my wife and two amazing\nkids\nand then she found a new path and there\nwas a decision whether to see that as a\nfailure or to actually for the first\ntime in our 20 years together\npractice the UN part of unconditional\nlove and I realized during our journey\ntowards divorce when I realized that she\nwas definitely gonna take this other\npass it was a realization of\nI really do love this person and I'm\nsitting here telling her how much I love\nher and therefore she shouldn't leave me\noh my gosh what what is that that is the\ndeepest condition I could possibly I\nlove you but only if you stay right next\nto me and I own this thing and so that\nwas my journey personally into deep\nheartbreak that led to the deepest joy\nthat a person can have is the exercise\nof unconditional love\nand I certainly didn't do it perfectly I\ndidn't do a whelm oh my gosh did I live\ndifferently after that moment where I\nrealized I can love her on this path\nthat she knows she's Chosen and we've\ngotten to watch both of us Bloom into\npeople we could have never become in\nthat marriage because it was a box that\nwas an agreement of no change\nand as we back up I think we're going to\nrealize that we put love and\nrelationship into a box of ownership\njust in the last couple hundred years it\nnever existed before we developed this\nownership model so we could pass wealth\nfrom generation to generation not\nrealizing when we built the Box we would\ncrush love which is ultimately the\ncapacity to see Beauty in another\nand if for a moment you think you can\nown another's Beauty you have stolen it\nfrom them ultimately and they will\nbecome miserable and you will forget why\nyou fell in love with them because you\ncan't see their beauty anymore and so in\na radical way we're going to have to\nrelease each other from the box as we\nput each other in\nit doesn't mean the end of relationship\nis probably the birth of human\nrelationship maybe for the first time\nbut certainly in in recent modern times\nwe're gonna have to release ourselves\nfrom the box and we have to do\npartnership relationships and much much\nradically different ways and they're\ngoing to have to come out of the fear of\nnot having enough love and start to come\nfrom an abundance model where everything\nis love beautiful thank you for sharing\nthat thank you for opening up and that's\nreally really beautiful to hear I'm glad\nI'm glad I asked us to go off peace all\nright question number four what's\nsomething you're trying to learn right\nnow or skill you're trying to learn\nBeauty\nthe witness of Beauty and the fifth and\nfinal question is if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow what would it be biodiversity\ncould you expand so that we can\ncontextualize it there's a a known\nphenomenon of blue zones around the\nplanet where people tend to live with\npast 100 years and so here we are on the\nnumber one Health podcast in the world\nwhat makes people live longer than 100\nyears and we've tried to boil it down to\nnutrition and we found that almost\neveryone will make completely\ndifferently and some of them ate only\ncooked food only meat only veggies the\nwhole thing only raw we saw it all in\nthe end what we have found is that those\nthat will live under 100 years live in a\nculture and communities that hold at\ntheir highest value the opportunity for\na new connection to to biodiverse ideas\nand peoples and this was taught to me by\na couple out of icaria Greece a Grecian\nIsland that that is an incredible Blue\nZone there and they came and prepared a\ntraditional five-course Greek meal for a\ngroup of us and I gave this toast at the\nend that said you know this is the\nmicropylene being nourished and we'll\nlive forever it will be like a Blue Zone\nbecause the nourishment is so deep the\nnutrients are so rich it was often\nso this beautiful thing I was crying\neverybody's crying because it's a\nbeautiful toast and then guy from a\nKorea stands up and says doctor that was\nvery interesting but you're completely\nwrong and he said that the only reason\nwe live past 100 years is not for what\nwe eat but it's because every night\nthere's a chair set at our table hoping\nthat somebody we don't know shows up\nand shares that meal with us in a career\nwe never ask each other what did you eat\nlast night but we always ask who did you\neat with last night and that's what\nwe're missing from society today and so\nwhen we talk about biodiversity it's\ncertainly true at the soil level if we\ndon't start living for the soil beneath\nour feet and enriching that with every\naction we take whether it be a political\nmove a social move an industrial move an\neconomic move if it's not supporting the\nsoil we would destroy ourselves in the\nsame way if we continue to listen in the\nEcho chamber of our minds and those\npeople we are married to and we create\nthese nuclear families and we listen to\nthe same box every day whether it be a\nTV or our own brain we will diminish our\nbiodiverse ideas and our biodiverse\ncapacity for creativity and therefore we\nwill lose the opportunity to stay and\nplay Dr Zach Bush thank you for such a\nfascinating and unique conversation one\nthat was full of refreshing insights and\nideas and I'm hoping that everyone who's\nlistening and watching wherever you are\nin the world I hope that you will go in\nfollow Dr Zach Bush learn more about his\nincredible work and I want you to tag us\nboth and share your insights your\ntakeaways the Nuggets that stood out to\nyou maybe there were messages or words\nthat are ones that you're going to hold\non to and it's going to shift the way\nthat you practice your health and\nwellness routines and regimes and so if\nyou've been listening or watching make\nsure you tag us and share what you\nlearned and what you gained from this\nepisode and Dr Zach Bush thank you so\nmuch for your time your energy your\npresence and everything that you've\nshared with us today thank you so much\npower be heard and seen by you very\ngrateful thank you if you love this\nepisode you'll enjoy my interview with\nDr Daniel Amen on how to change your\nlife by changing your brain if we want a\nhealthy mind it actually starts with a\nhealthy brain you know I've had the\nblessing or the curse to scan over a\nthousand convicted felons and over a\nhundred murderers and their brains are\nvery damaged"
