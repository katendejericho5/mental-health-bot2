    "transcript": "people are always going to say something\nalways they're going to try to have some\ntype of narrative but as long as you\nknow what's real I think that's what can\nhelp you keep your sanity the\nbest-selling authoring host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nI want to start off with just setting\ncontext for people\nseason's just finished yeah heading it\noff into the playoffs like how do you\nprepare\nat this time it's a big year huge start\nfor you you talk about hard work work\nethic in the book all the time but how\nis this different or how do you set\nyourself up yes wow though this is my\n18th season right in the NBA and it's\nbeen\na lot right a lot of good things have\nhappened but a lot of unfortunate bad\nthings have happened losses injuries and\nall of this and it's crazy I usually\nhave like this dead date right honestly\nlike we usually have this dead date with\neverybody that works with me where we'd\nbe like look Chris will be doing\nmeetings and all this stuff until this\ndate and then we just lock in you know\nwhat I mean but uh doing the book and\neverything\num it's been cool and getting a chance\nto do this is really cool and so when\nyou lose at something right like one\nlike group of athletes I've always\nthought about is Olympians right like\nthe Olympics happen once every four\nyears right and if you trip like in that\nrace\nthat's it yeah you got four years till\nyou can get ready for it again but see\nfor us like when we lost last year in\nthe playoffs you know you feel that\nheartache and it hurt and it's like\nI can't wait till next year and now\nfinally next year is here you know so we\ngot five six days to get ready for our\nfirst game but it's it's nothing like it\nyeah in the book you said you think the\ngame and when I read that that was\ninteresting to me I've sat down with so\nmany athletes on the show and behind the\nscenes as well but I'd never really\nheard anyone say it that way what does\nthat mean today what does that mean\nright now yeah that means\num do you do anything do you like play\ncards at all I I used to I mean I used\nto play soccer growing up that was my\nfavorite sport but like even if it's\nsoccer yeah if it's Connect Four right\nlike I play dominoes yeah yeah people\nplay ping pong I play I play any and\neverything and in everything you do you\nhave to have a strategy right whether\nit's a card game or anything and you\njust have to think different layers you\ncan always play right just play but if\nyou can think the game too and so me\nlike I was up this morning like as soon\nas I woke up this morning before I\ncalled my kids I was on YouTube like\nlooking at Clips like I go to YouTube\nand I'll look at\num or I go to this website that'll show\nme every shot I've missed or made since\nI've been in the NBA\nso like I'm literally always watching\ntrying to learn trying to see how I can\nget better so that's what I mean when I\nsay I think the game wow so you're\nliterally go on YouTube Type in Chris\nPaul misses and then watch and then this\nwebsite actually called second Spectrum\nokay that you can go do that but I can\ngo on YouTube and look uh at this\nparticular game so we're playing a\nClippers in the playoffs right so I can\ngo look on YouTube they got everything\non there I'm sure everybody know that\ntoo but you can go look at all of my\nshots that I played against the Clippers\nthis year\nstudy the game study who I might be\nguarding study your opponent and all\nthis stuff sewed in in the game of\ncourse talent and all that stuff but at\nsome point you still gotta be able to\nthink and sort of everybody has\nTendencies yeah we play 82 games right\nthere's certain things that guys do on a\nregular basis so if I can learn that and\nfigure that out the better yeah I love\nthat and I saw that in your book too\nit's like it's almost like you're\nobserving patterns right like there's\nall these patterns and that's what\nyou're saying like there's patterns over\n82 games when you start spotting the\npatterns it's hard for people to break\nthem and so they're going to keep\nrepeating that I can't imagine the\nthings that you learned and all the\nexperiences that you've had right but\nyou know there are certain things that\nare a staple for people that that are\nsuccessful yes right yeah you know what\nI mean like you've got to work hard you\ngotta have some type of discipline right\nor else\nwhatever you want to see\ncome into existence it's just not going\nto happen it's like they always say\num\nwhat is it I'd rather be lucky than good\nor something like that but you you still\ngotta have the work ethic to to see it\nthrough yeah what have been your do you\nhave like a set morning routine on game\ndays and prep days or do you kind of\nintuitively figure it out like what what\nare you like are you that disciplined\nbeast that's just set up to win or do\nyou feel you know what a good friend of\nmine JJ Redick uh he he does a podcast\nnow he talks he was my teammate but he's\nretired now uh earlier this year he was\ntalking about how sometimes a routine\ncan drive you nuts right and I sort of\ngot into that mode because I didn't play\nso long I didn't felt like if I don't do\nthis particular thing I'm not sure\nwhat's gonna happen tonight yeah you\nknow especially with how many games I've\nplayed like I I I'm serious I used to\nhave so much anxiety like\noh man if I didn't do this before I run\nout on the court got some injury might\nhappen I mean I used to have this crazy\nroutine for the past few years like I\nwould get up I would eat breakfast go to\nthe gym shoot around might be a 10 I\nmight get there at 8 15. do all this\nstretching workout shoot and go home I\nwould get Bodywork from like 11 15 11 30\nto like one o'clock and then I would lay\ndown had to be at one get up at three\nshower get dressed eat get in the car go\nto the game you know it just made for a\nlong day honestly on a game day it was a\nlong day and so I stopped doing\nnecessarily the body work from 11 15 to\n1 just to give me some time to live yeah\nhonestly to just be maybe like watch a\nshow for a little bit when my kids in\ntown chill with them or whatnot and it's\nactually been like liberating yeah but\nfor so long you just like I gotta do\nthis I gotta do that and it'll it'll\ndrive you nuts yeah and it sounds like\nthat's the way of it though right like\nthe the reason you can take that break\nnow watch that show or catch up with\nyour kids is because of that investment\nyou put in for like yeah 15 years 16\nyears for sure for sure but you also\nrealize that sometimes you gotta break\nup the monotony of that routine or\nwhatnot just to get yourself a break\nyeah that I think that's going to help a\nlot of people listening because I think\nthere's so many people listening right\nnow who are stuck in their routine and\ndon't realize how much it'll drive you\ncrazy especially in what we do now\nthat's certain things like there's\ncertain handshakes that's got to happen\nlike a few things not gonna change right\nlike uh when they call our name out for\nthe starting lineups I make sure I dap\nup all my teammates then I go to the\nlittle slant board I make sure I put my\nfoot on that three times I make sure I\nget the chalk rub my hands together clap\nthem together three times hit the back\nstanchion I got a lot of routine stuff\nthat I do I like hit my chest and I look\nup and you know say what up to Kobe you\nknow what I mean and then we do the jump\nball and some of that stuff's not gonna\nchange but some of the other things or\nwhatnot you have to look at your\nsituation and realize\nhow can you be oh no intentional what\nyou're doing yeah yeah and do you feel\nlike all of those things you just\nmentioned that aren't going to change\nthere were things you picked up along\nthe way because of wins like where did\nthose originate from yeah so it's funny\nit's funny you ask that and being on a\nteam for\nall of my life you know I've been on a\nteam since I was five years old and so\nwhen you find these little things they\nsort of just happen right so you're out\nthere with your teammates and you come\nup with a handshake and then somebody\nlike accidentally do something and you\nlike Oh I like that we're gonna keep\ndoing that we're gonna keep doing that\nso all these things just sort of get\nadded along the way you know what I mean\nso like before\nbefore I leave the locker room\nI also do uh like a one two three uh and\na bunch of our team trainers they they\nyell it with me I do one and they yell\ntwo three you know so that stuff just\nsort of picks up and you keep doing it\nthat's amazing man one of the things\nthat comes through your book is you talk\nso much about hard work confidence you\nknow seeing your own potential when no\none else sees it being able to bet on\nyourself having that confidence\nand even today I can tell this but at\nthe same time without confidence there's\nthis\nhumility in in your book too because you\ntalk so much about the teachers and the\ncoaches and the mentors and you talk\nabout this idea about how no one's\nreally self-made right and so you have\nthis great balance between this\nconfidence and this humility I wonder\nwhat was something that you were\ninsecure about as a kid was there\nanything in your life that you weren't\nconfident about or things that made you\ndoubt yourself at all types of things I\nmean\nI was small right well some people would\nstill say I am you know what I mean in\nmy profession I'm small yeah in my\nprofession but\nI mean I was a little brother right so I\nhad my older brother and all his friends\nwould pick on me you can't do this you\ncan't do that uh I played football\nI mean I was on my AAU basketball team I\nthink I'll talk about this in the book\nand everybody on my team was on Varsity\nexcept for me right and so I was a\nlittle bit slower right than some of the\nother guys I mean one of the most\nembarrassing things was back then our\nteam used to run out for warm-ups and\nback then like our parents had chance\nand all these songs they would sing and\nas my teammates we ran out to the court\neveryone would run and smack the\nbackboard right everybody Bop Bop\nEverybody smacking the backboard I\ncouldn't touch the backboard so I would\nhave to run by the backboard and just\nget back in line so I just had this\nconversation with my son the other day\nbecause I told my son he's gonna be\nvertically challenged just like me and\nso\none of his biggest goals is to be able\nto dunk right so\nhe asked me when did I dump for the\nfirst time I was a junior I think in\nhigh school when I dunked for the first\ntime so he was like I'm a dunk before\nthat I'm a dunk before that and I told\nhim I'm cool and fine with that but I\nalso want him to develop the actual\nskills of like playing the game I feel\nlike so many times now kids just want to\nbe able to dunk instead of learning\nactually how to play the game how did\nhow did you make that difference for\nyourself growing up because I feel like\nkids are always kids right right you\ngrew up watching Jordan and you want you\nknow so yeah I feel like everyone who\ngrows up watching anyone we all want to\nstand that way in the tape right and so\nhow did you stop yourself as an athlete\nwhen you were coming up to refocus just\nas you're encouraging little Chris to do\nit was just different and I say\ndifferent because\nand it may be because of my\ncircumstances in my situation right and\nseeing my grandfather right so I saw how\nmy grandfather provided for my family in\nso many different ways especially\nfinancially and\ngrowing up the way I grew up I always\nwanted more like I wanted more not just\nlike financially but I wanted to see\nthings and I wanted my family to see\nthings and\nI don't know I've just always been very\ncompetitive and my brother helped make\nme that way but I just uh I mean still\nto this day like I really don't take\nno for an answer right like there's got\nto be a way there's got to be a solution\nand if you tell me I can't do it then\nwe're gonna see about it you know and so\nit was a drive about it and it was a\ndrive to just want to be better in the\nCuriosity and\nI don't know like I said it was almost\nsubconscious watching my grandfather\nwork\nright so I played football my coaches\nwere hard on me you know and I just knew\nif I wanted to do something I had to\nwork yeah that work was just obvious\nthrough your grandfather who just\nlived it every day and I'm you know when\nyou took\nthe kids back to see the service station\nin the space that part of the book is is\nreally special because you reminded me\nso I was\nI was nine years old when my dad took me\nback to the home he grew up in and my\ndad's home was probably as big his home\nwas as big as this room like cut off\nthat part as well like none of that\nhallway so his whole house was this big\nand it was in India where he grew up and\nso he took me there and I remember like\nwalking outside there was a lot of like\ntrash on the floor there were like rats\nrunning around there were cockroaches\ninside this big bat flew on my face like\nhad my Batman moment like I was like I\nwas a nine-year-old kid and this bat\nflew my face and it was disgusting my\ndad put out my eyes and then we went in\nthis house and it was literally this big\nand I remember my dad was telling me how\nthey shared like a toilet with like 30\nfamilies like he grew up in like you\nknow immense poverty and it was just one\nof the best experiences of my life going\nthere it's nine-year-old so when I was\nreading about you taking your kids back\nto Grandpa's service station the\nspacecraft I was like I know how\nformative that's been for me walk us\nthrough what what their reaction was and\nyeah your reasoning actually everything\nthat you just said is so valid and if I\nbe if I'm gonna be very honest like\nwhen you're a kid\nyou only know what you know right and so\nthe times that something was going on\nand I seen my grandfather pull that wad\nof money out of his pocket\nI used to start tripping that's a lot of\nmoney to me to anybody and so like as a\nkid you want things I mean when we was\nin the car and we went to McDonald's or\nsomething right or say you went to\nWendy's I don't care where you went like\nif you went to Wendy's we want the\nbiggie size fries right like we want the\nextra large fries and the extra large\nsoda we couldn't do that you know what\nI'm saying like my parents just wasn't\ndoing it because we didn't have the the\nmoney to do it and as a kid I watched\nmovies too did you ever see Richie Rich\nyeah of course right you see Richie Rich\nyou see that movie uh what was it blank\ncheck yeah you know what I mean like as\na kid it's like dang I'm trying to see\nwhat that be like yeah right and so of\ncourse you want things you want uh\nthings but\nthe biggest thing that I learned is when\nI got to the NBA right and you can get\nthose things they don't complete you at\nall like they don't but what you start\nto realize is that with the money and\nthe finance at times you have an\nopportunity to change other people's\nlives so that's when the work really\njust sets in and it's like all right I\nwant to keep working because I want to\nkeep providing and helping others or\nwhatnot so when it came to my kids\nthey live a totally different life than\nme and my wife ever did right and so\nthis is so crazy like I'm I'm picturing\nthese real conversations that I have\nwith my kids because for me\nand my wife like\nI wanted something different from my\nparents right and the hardest thing is\ntrying to figure out how to get my kids\nmotivated because\nthey can't get me my wife a new house\nyeah you know what I mean they just\ncan't and so it's constantly just making\nsure that they have their own motivation\nwhat's going to motivate them so I\nwanted them to see why I am the way I am\nbecause sometimes they just see Mom and\nDad or they just see me but they got a\nchance to really go see why I get mad if\nthe trash ain't taken out you know\nbecause growing up I was having to cut\nthe grass we were having a\nuh fold clothes wash clothes do all\nthese different type things so that's\none of the challenges as a parent of how\ndo you instill some of these things in\nyour kids yeah throughout the book you\nsee just how conscious and intentional\nyou are about the kids and again I think\nthere's this healthy balance where like\nthere's a lot of love for them and you\nyou get that it's not their fault that\nthey correct they didn't have that\nexperience like yeah but at the same\ntime you want to help them and I think\nthat\nit's it's such a it's such a hard\nbalance to do but it sounds like because\nyou and Jada are taking it so\nthoughtfully and intentionally that I\nI just see it all the time like the\namount of celebrity kids who also feel\nthe pressure A to B like their parents\nin their field that's already a pressure\nsecond of all there's a feeling which I\ndon't think a lot of people realize but\nthere's a lot of feeling of guilt for\nkids to be like well I didn't deserve\nthis or my friends don't have this so\nlike I didn't do it and then on the\nother side which you get is the\nentitlement as well so so it's so much\nso much to deal with so much that goes\ninto it man and I think the the only\nthing for us\nthat we've always tried to do is at\nleast communicate with them and don't\nmake them guess or try to figure it out\non their own and even though I'm here\nsomewhat giving advice or whatnot or\ntalking about my Memoir I'm always\nlooking for advice some of the people\nthat I've looked to as mentors or\nwhatnot most of our conversations have\nbeen on parenting because this thing\ndon't come with a manual you know it\ndoesn't and I'm constantly learning\nadapting trying to adjust because kids\num for sure will will will like test you\nyou know and I think it's been the best\ntest that I've ever had because they\nshow you how to love unconditionally and\nuh\nit's the it's the it's the best ride\nyeah the part in the book that that\nreally got me was when you're because I\ndon't have kids yet and me and my wife\nhave been together for around 10 years\nnow and we moved from London to New York\nto LA and now we live in LA but the last\nseven years have been yeah I've been\naround and you know in our own way\nobviously I'm not moving how you are but\nbut still kind of that feeling of not\nhaving a home right now we know we live\nin L.A and we we're happy there but\nI often think about like how my kids\nwill have a different life to the life I\nhad even in\nso that the person I'm picking out of\nyour book is when you're leaving La\nand you're talking to little Chris about\nand he's really upset about it like\nbecause he's made his friends and he's\ngonna miss him and and and you can\nrelate to that as a kid it doesn't\nmatter who your dad is right it's like\nas a kid it's like your friends are\neverything you're scared about what it's\ngoing to be like going to a new school I\nthink that's when you're moving from LA\nto Houston yeah and and you're just\nyou're feeling this discomfort and I\nlove what you say to him where you're\nlike I need you yeah and I thought that\nwas amazing to hear a dad say like I\nneed you it wasn't like you need to do\nthis for me or you gotta you know just\njust fix up and be be strong and man up\nand how did how did you recognize that\nthat was the conversation and Jay I'm\nvery visual so even as you're talking to\nme like I'm envisioning when it happened\nwe were in my office in my house in\nCalabasas and I'll never forget his face\never it was tough and like I said I grew\nup around the same friends right like me\nand my brother got a group chat with our\nhomies back home that we grew but with\nand that is\nprobably one of the coolest things about\nmy childhood whereas I know to each his\nown some people moved around a lot and\nthey gave them the ability to uh be\nflexible to different cultures and this\nand that but it was cool having a home\nbase and so\nwhen we left and Chris said that it was\nhard it was really hard which why which\nis why we ultimately made the decision\nwhen we went from Houston to OKC to let\nthem stay in LA and\nit's always going to be hard that's what\nyou understand is that there's no\nperfect life there's no perfect family\nbecause in trying to give them stability\nnow the last four years I've been\nwithout them you know so I think what\nalways ends up happening is somebody got\na sacrifice right and if anybody gonna\nsacrifice as far as my family go I'm\ngonna make sure it's me you know and\nthat's that's how we got to where we are\nnow yeah and how do you stay strong in\nthat time because\nI get that too like my wife and I end up\nspending a bit of time apart every year\nas well because\nuh family both of our families are from\nLondon and they live in London and our\nniece and nephew are there or sisters\nare there so my wife misses family a lot\nand her family's like her like fuel\nright and so we end up spending quite a\nfew months apart every year and I wonder\nhow do you stay strong how do you kind\nof like what do you work on to make sure\nthat you're filled up as well because\nlike you said it's a sacrifice but at\nthe same time you have to take you have\nto be the one I'm looking for tips and\nadvice every day I'm telling you it's\nyeah it's so hard and I and I tell you I\nthink the the\nthe biggest thing that I try to do is\nmake sure that I'm not a not too\nemotional in front of in front of my\nkids right because\num my kids are are special like my my\nson is\nso like thoughtful you know and my\ndaughter is the same way and\nit's so different right my childhood was\nmy dad was coach and all that my mom was\na teen mom so my parents never missed\nanything I think probably one of the\ncoolest interactions was we played in La\nmaybe like a week and a half two weeks\nago and my family came to the game and\nmy kids were standing outside the locker\nroom and I had no clue they did this but\nwhen a few of my teammates left they saw\nmy daughter and they was like cam we be\nwatching your baseball games we'd be\nwatching your basketball games because\nbecause I can't be there\nI'll literally be in the locker room\nbefore a game my iPad is set up my wife\nis videoing the game and I'm doing my\nstretches and exercises before the game\nand anybody is in the locker room they\ncan hear they can hear my daughter's\ngame going on so to see uh my wife told\nme how much my daughter like she just\nlit up knowing you know that I'm I'm not\nthere physically but I'm always you know\nat least watching and trying to when I\ncan I feel like kids feel that presence\nyou know I always felt like my parents\ndidn't have a lot of time for me they\nwere both immigrants working hard trying\nto put food on the table but I always\nfelt their presence because when I was\nwith them or when they did see me there\nwas a real connection there yeah and I\ndidn't need like eight hours a day ten\nhours I didn't have that luxury they\ndidn't have that luxury but even if it\nwas for those couple of hours every day\nI say that all the time man I'm so aware\nand conscious that like kids my my kid\nis now 13 and 10. they're very smart\nthey're very aware that if you was to\nget them a gift say you're a big time\nperson or something you get them a gift\nand somebody works for you got them to\ngive your kids you can't fool them you\nknow but they would much rather have\nthat time so when I'm in town or whatnot\nif I get a day off and I go home the\nbest time for me is taking my kids to\nschool right that 20 25 minute drive to\nschool and then even the fact that my\ndaughter still lets me walk her in those\nI think are the most priceless moments\nbecause one thing that I learned during\nquarantine\nwas that was the first year that I lived\naway from my family right I was in\nOklahoma and then uh the shutdown\nhappened and we all went home for a\nwhile and it was just crazy because even\nthough my kids might be doing their own\nthing\nthey felt comfort and I was like on Zoom\ntrying to set up the bubble right\nbecause I was the union president but\nthey felt comfort in doing their own\nthing but they knew if they looked out\nthe side of their eye that they could\nsee me in my office right so just the\nawareness you might not necessarily be\nright there next to them all the time\nbut just the fact that they know you're\nthere yeah yeah well said what's that\nand going back to one of your rituals I\nwas just thinking about this you said\nyou write can't give up now on your\nshoes before you before you got to play\na game and I was I was thinking like\nwhat is that you know 18 years is a long\ntime to dedicate professionally and then\nwant to speak of all the prep and and\neverything else that goes into it but\nwhat does it feel like to get traded to\nfeel down and out to feel like it's not\ngoing in the direction you want and then\nto can't give up now yeah like I find\nthat that kind of pivot\nfor some people it breaks them and for\nsome people it makes them and for you\nany sort of pivots have only taken you\nfurther and further and further for you\nto perform and pursue at a higher level\nwhat is that because I think people look\nat you and even when I read your book I\nwas just thinking\nyou're working really hard at basketball\nyou're really working hard at your\nfamily you're working out of being a dad\nI'm like this guy works hard on every\narea of his life like there's not so you\ntry to you're trying to yeah I respect\nthat you you don't come across as you're\nperfecting it but there's this energy of\nlike I'm thinking about how I'm raising\nmy kids and thinking about my\nrelationship\nbut then\nwhen the career part is having its\nhiccups and slip-ups and whatever else\nin the past what did you find when you\nget that can't give up now like where\ndoes that come from so I'll tell you\nwhere that came from was when I got\ntraded from Houston to OKC like to be on\nI was mad like really mad because I've\nbeen told one thing and another thing\nhappened and when I went to Houston I we\nmoved like 15 people to Houston right so\nto not know and to know that I was going\nto Oklahoma City I was hot I was in\nAugusta Georgia\nand I didn't know what that meant\nright I didn't know what that meant I\ndidn't know what was next it was the\nfirst time I've been blindsided with\nsomething like that it's a song by Mary\nMary right it's called Uh can't give up\nnow because like I said in the book I\ngrew up in church I was in church four\nor five days a week and I remember\nlistening to that song and like getting\nemotional and it was like look the trade\ndidn't happen ESPN everybody talking\nabout it or whatnot\nI learned this a while ago in the league\nis that ain't nobody gonna feel sorry\nfor you and like you said I've learned\nthat too in this business that there's\ntwo different type of people\npeople who gonna feel bad for themselves\nand just salt and then there's other\npeople who gonna get to work and so that\nwas my that was my mindset it was like\nall right I think I'm done all right\ncool I got I put my head down and do the\nwork and so that was\nyou know my whole energy going into that\nyeah how do you differentiate between\nwhat the media is building as a\nnarrative versus your narrative like how\ndo you I find like athletes that's what\nmakes The Athlete's job a million times\nharder than even playing the game\nbecause especially now with social media\nwhere there's so much chatter so much\nconversation how do you keep your focus\naround this is reality and that's just\ncrazy you said that because I learned\nsomething about myself\num even a few years ago I can't have\nthat clutter right and when I played\nback in La I think I said this in the\nbook too with the Clippers Doc Rivers he\nused to talk about uh getting rid of the\nClutter right so when you get home from\na game if your team lose everybody\nthat's with your family and all that\nwhat they gonna do\nif y'all lost the game what they gonna\nsay yeah uh it was everybody else's\nfault\nright like if you lose a game and you\nget home everybody in your family gonna\nthey're gonna be like uh this person\nwasn't doing that that person wasn't\ndoing that they ain't never gonna say\nnothing about you right and so that's\nliterally clutter right and the same\nthing I've learned years ago in the\nplayoffs like in the playoffs you got to\nwin four games out of seven right and I\ndon't care what anybody says about\nsocial media or whatnot but if you win a\ngame in the playoffs and you go on the\nsocial media and you had a great game\nand everybody talking about you like you\nthe best thing since pants with pockets\nthen you might let your guard down right\nand the same thing if you don't have a\ngood game and you go out there and\neverybody's talking about how sorry you\nare you might lose a little bit of\nconfidence so for me I try to block out\nall of that noise you know what I mean\nso that's like when the playoffs start I\ndon't want to see what ESPN talking\nabout I don't want to see what bleacher\nI want to see what none of them talking\nabout because you got to just stay\nlocked in and stay focused and as long\nas you know it's true\nyou know what I mean people are always\ngoing to say something always they're\ngonna try to have some type of narrative\nor whatnot but as long as you know\nwhat's real I think that's what can help\nyou keep your sanity yeah and I think\nthat's one of the hardest skills for\nanyone let alone someone who a lot of\npeople in the world are talking about\nlike that's\nyou know I can imagine that affects kids\ntoday I'm sure kids feel at school and\nyou see that with them at school and see\nthis is the thing I tell you and I'm not\na parent coach or anything like that I\ncan only tell you my experience but\nwhat I've learned with social media with\nkids right and having a 13 and a 10 year\nold is that\nwhen I was growing up if a girl didn't\nlike you or something like that you\ndealt with it at school\nright once you went home you didn't have\nto deal with it right you you just saw\nher at school the next day now with\nphones and\nsocial media and all that one thing I\nknow is that these kids are dealing with\nthings all day long right it could be on\nSnapchat it could be on Instagram or\nwhatnot and if I us as adults if we\ncan't handle that mental capacity like I\nsaid I can't handle that like I'm on\nInstagram but I'll go weeks without even\nlooking at it you know what I mean just\nbecause\nI feel like you know with our stories\nand stuff like that now we ask people\nhow they doing we already know what the\nhell they didn't did for the last three\nweeks you know what I mean so that's\njust me yeah yeah there's\nI I wanna I wanna shift here because\nthere's what I found was\nreally special as someone who was\nreading your book and and just again\nlike I said learning so much about you\nit was like you said that your grandpa\nyou know used to encourage you to listen\nto obituaries and when they came on and\nyou'd it'd tell you more about that\nperson too like yeah this amazing\nmemories\nit was it was weird and kind of strange\nbecause\nokay what no like iPhones where the\nalarm went off and he knew to do it it's\nlike everybody would be working and my\ngranddaddy would just be like cut on\nobituaries and soon as somebody hit the\nlittle radio player the song would be\nplaying\nit's like kind of morbid and they would\njust start naming off the people who had\ndied right and I mean everybody out\nthere working and you might hear Mr\nUlysses or Bo or somebody say oh such\nand such died you know they didn't know\nand my granddad might start talking\nabout one of them but because I talk\nabout my grandmother dying when I was\nseven that was my first time you know\nbeing faced with death and then it's\ncrazy it was a funeral home in our\nhometown called Russell's funeral home\nlike once every like two weeks or\nwhatnot they would bring their fleet of\ncars up to the service station because\nthey had like a it's crazy to think\nabout now they had a business account\nright with my granddad service station\nand so just it was a lot man I that's\nwhy I still don't deal with death well\nyou know I mean to see the the hearse is\npulling there and oh no it was it was\ndifferent yeah it's it's you said that\nwith your grandmother's passing you were\nlike I never really got over that like\nand I think that's\nthat's so real for for so many people\nbut like you said like people often say\nlike I know how you feel but no one can\nknow how you feel because they didn't\nknow that person they didn't know your\nconnection to them that experience like\nyou you dealt with that so early on at\nseven and like you said you didn't you\nnever really gotta got over it now when\nyou look back on it is it something you\neven want to get over or is it something\nthat just stays with you and it's okay I\nthink it just stays with me because\num\nI tell you like writing this book was\nalso like therapeutic because some of\nthe stuff I never talked about and so\nmight have been a week or two ago I was\ntalking to my parents and was just\nasking them like I was like Dad I was\nlike when was the first time you dealt\nwith death right because my kids are 13\nand 10 and they haven't right the only\nperson I think that they've seen pass\naway\nis uh\nmy my wife's grandmother right and so\nobviously the less you have to deal with\nthat the better but\nI mean as soon as I go to a funeral\nright\nall those emotions from when I was seven\nyou know they they come right back they\ncome right back and it's something about\nthe closure aspect of it and somebody\nnot being there anymore I'll tell you\nsomething really cool my dad when I grew\nup as a kid videoed everything every one\nof my games was VHS all of that my dad\nuh\nfound a bunch of those tapes and he had\nthem converted into DVDs and so recently\nmaybe like three weeks ago\nhe sent the DVDs to me he hadn't even\nwatched him and I put one of the DVDs in\nand I was watching it and we used to\nhave events all the time at this place\nup the street from our house and I was\nlooking at the video and I was like what\nis this and I kept watching it for a\nwhile and my granddad walked in it was\nactually a video from his 60th birthday\nright literally just three weeks ago\ncame across this wow and uh it was like\nemotional watching it and I started\nfilming some of it because uh I hadn't\nheard my granddad's voice and\nover 20 years since since he passed away\nI took a video of it and I put in our\nfamily group chat my mom called me she\npulled over to the side of the road and\nshe was crying because you you don't\nthink about stuff like that you know\nwhat I mean my kids they know the story\nof my grandfather they know all of that\nbut they never heard his voice my wife I\ndidn't know she had never heard his\nvoice right so to to have this footage\nnow and my brother talked wishing him\nhappy birthday and I'm\nanxiously watching I'm like man where am\nI where am I because you see everybody\nsetting up and then you see somebody say\nall right everybody be quiet uh he about\nto walk in because it was like a\nsurprise and so when I heard somebody\nsay that I was like oh I must be\nbringing him in to surprise because we\nused to be together all the time and\nthen he walks in and out I don't see\nmyself and I'm like where am I in this\nvideo and that's my brother's giving his\nuh Happy Birthday speech to my granddad\nhe says if Chris was here he would have\nsaid the same thing\nand then I I like just this whole\nfeeling came over me because I wasn't\nthere and I called my mom I was like Mom\nwhere was I where where was I and she\nwas like you had to be at an au\ntournament and so it was crazy like I\nwas getting emotional again because I\nwas like damn that sort of been a story\nof my life it's missing stuff you know\nwhat I mean but it's it's crazy like I\nsaid death and all this stuff you just\nyou never get over it and you're not\nreminded of it until you you face with\nit again yeah thank you for sharing that\nstory man I mean that's like the\nwho I mean to be to be reminded of being\nabsent because you're pursuing your\ndream but then you know the stuff like\nyou said sacrifice you said some\nsomething has to be sacrificed but I\ncan't imagine what it felt like to you\nknow reconnect back with that memory\nthrough finding an amazing tape but then\nright feeling like you're not there at\nthis time with the book coming out to to\nfinally see that that was uh that was\nreally cool and I think I mean I got my\nlittle cousin AJ and takoyu who like 29\nand 27 they had never heard AJ had but\nthey were kids or whatever when he died\nso they hadn't heard anything yeah yeah\nwhat what do you think was a lesson\nthere's so many lessons in the book that\nyou learned from your grandpa and that\nthat are you know I think people should\nread the book for the to learn the depth\nof it but what's the lesson that you\nthink you carry in your heart the most\nthat stays with you right now till this\nday that you feel lives with you man it\nsounds so generic but I say the work\nethic right but it's crazy because I\ncould sit here and say you gotta work\nyou gotta work it's the work ethic but\nI'll also say it's the balance because\nit's the one thing that I also learned\nabout my family and my mom said this and\nI never even thought about this aspect\nof it was that my grandfather worked so\nhard and I think I said this in the book\nthat that was all he knew so he never\nactually\nI want to say enjoyed our family but he\nnever like went on vacation you know\nwhat I mean and I'm not saying you gotta\ngo to another country or something like\nthat but just try to make sure that\nthere's balance and make sure that\ncourse you got to work work work to\nprovide but make sure at some point you\ntake some time to enjoy the people\naround you and your family because my\nmom said that the the one time that my\ngranddad actually went on vacation was\nwhen my grandmother was about to pass\naway and so it wasn't until\nhe seen that he was going to lose my\ngrandmother that he was like okay I need\nto to do something with her yeah and you\ntalk about how like he used to finish\nwork at like 7 A.M to 7 30 and then he\nstarted ending at six yep and he was\nsaying like for some people that may not\nbe a big thing but if you're into a\nfamily that was huge that was huge\nbecause all you saw him do his work I\nalways I always saw him do his work and\nwhen my grandmother died is when\nanywhere he went I tried to go with him\nI tried to go with him and it's it's\ntough man like I\nI keep saying my mom is unbelievable\nbecause\nI mean I'll be 38 in a few weeks and I\nstill got Mom and Dad and it's not till\nI got older and I started like I was\nlike man mom you lost mom\nand that you know so I I can't imagine\nthat yeah yeah and how did they process\nit because you say in the book like how\nyou know we don't always do therapy we\ndon't always talk about it like have you\nhelped them with their grief while you\nhelp yours do you find it useful as a\nfamily to connect or is it you know it's\ncrazy I don't think my parents have read\nthe book yet I'm so excited for them to\nread it I want them to read the book but\nI also want them to listen to the\naudiobook because I did the audiobook so\nthey can actually hear my voice and I\nthink when they read it\nthey probably gonna learn some stuff\nabout me that they probably don't know\nand I know my my family is extremely\nemotional and a lot of times we're all\nworking we're all on the Move we're all\non the go but uh I think it's gonna be\nsomething cool to talk about once they\nread it yeah what do you think is going\nto shock them the most and surprise them\nthe most or or something you think that\nthey're gonna be maybe even\nis there anything that would make the\nmoney easy what do you think I don't\nthink anything's gonna be uneasy some of\nit would probably be funny\nbecause I talk about some of me and my\nbrothers like childhood growing up my\nparents never talking to us about sex\nall this different type stuff but uh\nit's\num it's gonna be real cool and I think\nthey'll probably I mean I try to tell my\nparents how much I appreciate them all\nthe time but hopefully they get more of\na feeling of that through the book too\nyeah do you think you were talking about\nthe hard work and the balance and it's\nsuch a\nit's something that I think all of us\nwho are ambitious or obsessed with\nfiguring out right you want to put\neverything into the thing you love the\nthing you were born to do and at the\nsame time you realize it's meaningless\nif\nthe family the relationship the\nfriendships aren't there right we always\nhear that I'm like no one wants to Be\nLonely at the Top or it is lonely at the\ntime right and so do you think that that\nmakes you sacrifice success or do you\nthink that is success is to be able to\nhave birth it depends it depends if you\ncan have both then\nthat's probably the ultimate goal right\nto have both to have that success and\nhave that balance but the thing that I'm\nalways battling with right is that 18\nyears of my life I've been\nin the NBA and that is a blessing right\nI want to be there I want to be there\nfor my kids events I want to be a dad\njust like my dad was to me because I'm\nnot where I'm at without my dad sort of\ncultivating that and and being there and\nthen there's this other side of it too\nwhereas if I was to retire right and\nstop playing knowing that I still got a\nlot left in the tank and still got the\npassion and whatnot\nwould I be this amazing dad that I want\nto be\nif I gave up my own passion right so\nthat's the the hard decision that's the\nhard decision that\neveryone has to make all the time and I\nconstantly have those conversations with\nmy kids and my wife about it and you\nknow we ultimately sort of decided that\nthey wouldn't like the person that's at\nhome if I stopped playing prematurely\nyeah that's so real man I think that's\nlike the\nthat's that's the biggest realization is\nlike how if you're not living your\npurpose\nthe person you become is like a figment\nlike a little tiny piece of who you\nreally are right and then everyone's\ngetting that leftover version of you\nexactly and so it's it's crazy you just\nnever know is\nyou know that time you know you you\nwon't get that time back it ain't like\nyou can stop playing and then call the\nNBA in four or five years be like yo\npick me back up yeah you know but also\nyou don't get that time back with the\nkids so you it's what we are trying to\nfigure out yeah if you were in that tape\nif you were there at that birthday\nwhat would you have said oh man\nI'm sure it's a tape somewhere from one\nof those other birthdays but I know I\nwould have just talked about how my\ngranddad was my best friend you know and\nhow I was happy for him to be there and\nI probably would have said something\nabout him not having his teeth in you\nknow in that video in the video that I\nseen of him he didn't have his teeth in\nhis mouth so as soon as I seen him walk\nin and his whole face was closed up I\nwas like oh where's my granddaddy teeth\nat but um I don't know and it was crazy\nfor me because like I said I'm watching\nthis video not knowing what it is and\nthen when I see it's his 60th birthday\nknowing that he died literally the next\nyear at 61. it was uh it was crazy so I\nwould have definitely just told him you\nknow how much I love and appreciate him\nand probably try to get him to move in\nwith us again what what do you think's\nthe lesson that if he was here with us\ntoday that he'd still want you to learn\nor something he'd be poking at you at\nfour or oh man what do you think he'd be\ncoaching you on right now probably all\nthe texts that I get my temper\nbut um I don't know I think the biggest\nthing that my granddad would be proud of\nif he was still here was just that our\nfamily is still together\nyou know I mean I think that's the\nbiggest thing that he'd be proud of\nbecause he had uh he had my mom and he\nhad my aunt Rhonda right and so\nthe fact that even in La that's where my\nwife and kids lives where my brother\nlives that's where my Rhonda's kids AJ\nand Coy live like all the holidays we\nall still get together even after all\nthis time and uh I think that's what\nhe'd be most proud of yeah I mean you\nknow it's like you're when I'm reading\nthe book I had the\nthe bird's eye view note of what had\nhappened in your experience but then to\nread it and to get the the real context\nof the depth of your relationship with\nyour grandpa which then when you read\nabout what happens you like\nyou know that that like it gets it gets\nyou right like it gets me I wasn't close\nwith my granddad at all\num I never I barely met my dad's dad and\nI was never really that close to my\nmom's dad and so I didn't I don't have I\ncan't even say I know how you feel\nbecause I don't even have that context\nbut I fall close to your relationship\nwith your granddad because of how you\ndescribe them\nand then I mean there's no words to\ndescribe it for it to happen just in the\nmost tragic way that you could lose\nsomeone you love and the way you find\nout the way you rush over there like\nyeah that that whole moment when I'm\nreading it was like\nI can't imagine how tough it is to\nrelive that\nfor you as you're writing it out and why\nwas it\nso important to share that piece and why\ndid it mean so much to you to share that\npiece yeah I think it was important for\nme to share it just\num\nselfishly it was for me too you know to\nto talk about it and also to show why I\nam sort of the way I am and why I'm\nwired the way I am\nand I don't know keep learning little\nthings like throughout the book\nthroughout the process of writing a book\nI was having to call and ask like my mom\nsome questions right like that's how I\nfound out my granddad's name was uh\nchilly like we called him Papa chili but\ncall my mom luckily my granddad still\nhas a few siblings that's still alive\nand that's why it's so important I ask\nour grandparents and things like that\nquestion so we know our history and\noh no I think it was just great for me\num obviously I want a lot of people to\nread it but sometimes I was almost in\nthe book just talking to my family\nbecause even being away from home right\nI haven't lived in Winston-Salem in 18\nyears and that's where all my family is\nlike you were saying your wife like\nLondon or whatever I grew up around all\nmy family so in some parts of this\nMemoirs me talking to my family back\nhome that I've been away from from a\nlong time and just letting them know how\nmuch I appreciate them how much I miss\nhim\num through a lot of these experiences\ntoo it's taught me\nI really treasure the relationship that\nmy kids have with my parents and my\nwife's parents right because my dad my\nmom and dad they are not the same people\nthat raised me right they are not the\nway they be so nice to my kids and you\nknow my son in the backyard shooting\nbasketball when he was younger and he\nbreaking left and right and my mama just\nyelling good job baby no that is that is\nnot what you're supposed to be doing but\nthere are times when my kids will do\nsomething and I get on them and I see my\ndad them like be easy on him and I like\nyou wasn't easy on me but because of my\ngrandfather in that relationship I get\nit\nlike I get it when my parents would get\nmad at me or I get my butt whooped the\nfirst person I called was my granddad so\nI'm I'm grateful\nfor that because those relationships are\nreally important and I want to make sure\nthat my kids uh have that bond that I\nhad too with my granddad yeah yeah for\nsure and and that's I'm so happy to hear\nthat I'm so happy to hear you feel that\nyour kids have that yes with your\nparents and Jada's parents because yes\nbecause when they wake up when my\nparents are in town and my kids wake up\nin the morning they run in there first\nyeah they're running out first and I see\nthe way that my parents light up and it\nseriously like I literally look at my\nparents and I think back to my granddad\nand how he must have felt yeah\nit's it's so crazy what's this 2023 my\ndad is 62 now and so when my grand I\nmean when my dad turned 61 last year it\nwas like crazy emotional for me because\nI was like man this is how old my\ngranddad was when I lost them and\nit's crazy to see like my dad yeah yeah\nabsolutely and for them to to have him\nin the house and yeah and greatness it's\nuh I think the part that really blew my\nmind is you saying how you found a way\nto have uh empathy and uh you know some\nsort of like forgiveness for the four\nindividuals that assaulted your\ngrandfather and I think having to relive\nit again when the case gets opened up\nagain and you know you know to deal with\nit up until 2021 I think it was like you\nknow it's like that having to go through\nit is the worst thing anyway and then to\nhave to leave relive it again and for it\nto be opened up and for innocence to to\nbe the topical conversation and for then\nagain for it to close like but for you\nto be in a place where you said it's\ntaken you a long time but you feel like\nthere's a certain level of empathy I'm\nlike that is\nI mean walk us through the Journey not\nthe end because the end is the hard part\nbut yeah the journey is tough because\nin the immediate reaction oh yeah like I\nsaid in the book I had some family\nmembers who was gonna handle it handle\nit themselves\nbut it was uh\nI don't know it took a while but then\nyou start to realize\nno matter what happens he's not coming\nback right I couldn't get him back and\nI don't know if it was just getting\nolder or the way that I like watch shows\nyou start learning about the prison\nsystem and all this different type stuff\nand you just start realizing that\npeople make mistakes sometimes bigger\nthan others but being\nincarcerated for that long of a time you\nknow what I mean if you can show that\nyou're remorseful and everything that\neverything has happened that's\nwhen I definitely think you need a\nsecond chance at this day did you ever\nreceive any remorse or apology or any\nsort of thing from them or that never\nhappened no no never and what's crazy is\nlike I said when that case got reopened\nthat was one of the first times it was\nthe first time that I actually started\nfinding out details about the case yeah\nbecause you think about like I said I\nwas in college and my parents wouldn't\nlet me go they wouldn't let me go to any\nother court hearings or anything like\nthat and uh over the years I tell you my\naunt Rhonda she the one to be on top of\neverything and\nit was a few times that I used to ask\nher I used to be like Auntie show me\nshow me what the boys look like\nyou know and she would like pull up a\npicture or whatnot and that was like\nhard to even look at because\nyou start questioning asking why like\nhell why would you do this but\nas time goes on\nyou just you just try to heal and that's\nthat's huge man to to never hear\nthe apology and remorse and to almost to\naccept an apology you never received\nin order to rise above I mean that\nthat's like I mean that's I mean I was\ngoing to ask you what do you think is\nthe toughest thing you've ever done I'm\nlike that sounds like the toughest thing\nanyone's ever had to do yeah for sure\nit's definitely one of them like I said\nI think it was the unexpected situation\nas far as my granddad and in the book\nlike I really like detail you know when\ntraumatic things happen you sort of tend\nto remember everything downtown I\nremember scuffing my Jordans yeah you\nknow I mean uh right there by the by the\ngym\nand\nit was crazy it was just a whirlwind how\neverything happened that went from the\nbest day on the 14th seriously like a\nmovie the 14 signing my letter of intent\nto the 15th that happening you start to\nrealize that\nI don't know like I I'm right here\nthinking about it yeah I love that when\npeople when people call you sometimes\nnow or whatnot like you always hope for\nthe best but expect the worst you know\nwhen somebody says yo does this happen\nyou know what I mean even though that\none situation happened it's sort of\nalmost gets you on edge when it whenever\nsomething happens yeah well well I think\nthat the book is genuinely like it's a\nbeautiful dedication to your grandpa\nlike it is like\nI can't imagine anyone in the world who\nwouldn't be super proud to be on it in\nthat way like it's such a beautiful\nhonoring of a person that you loved and\nI've never I don't think I've ever read\na memoir that felt like an honoring of\nsomeone else man I appreciate it I\nreally mean that it's like I was reading\nI was like you you know obviously you\nshare do you do share so much about\nyourself but so much about yourself is\nin him for sure and from him and so\nyou know to to read something where\nsomeone honors like almost offering your\nlife as an honoring to him is to do that\nin a memoir it's very very special it's\nlike very special how many books have\nyou written written that too so I'm on\nmy third yeah oh yeah this is one yeah\nand that was that took a while because\nlike you said I wanted you to be able to\nfeel like what I was experiencing and\nwhat I was going through and it's cool\nit's really cool it's really cool to\nhear that you you read it all that sort\nof made me nervous when you said that\ntoo because because it's probably not\nalways going to be\num\nthe best or whatnot but if somebody can\ndraw any experience from it right any\nexperience from it and I think then that\nwas a win yeah and I didn't mean to\nscare you I just wanted you to know you\nknow I just I feel like when I when I\nstarted to dive into you and it I was\njust like\nI just needed to feel like I had a real\ngrasp of what you'd gone through to to\nhonor you in this way as well like sure\nwhen I sit down with someone I feel like\nI'm trying to to some degree appreciate\nand honor their life because it's my\nability to also capture your you as a\nhuman\nand even even the name like I remember\nwhen the book first came on my desk and\nI was trying to figure out like I didn't\nget the physical version but the digital\nversion when it first came to me I was\nlike oh 61 interesting and I started\ndiving into everything around it\nand what it what did it feel like when\nin that game you\nyou know when you talk about all the\nfeelings that rush through your head of\nlike oh that's the record of Jordan at\n67 and you know I feel like when you're\nin that place so many things are\nflashing in between your eyes like we'll\njust\nwalk us through that it was crazy\nbecause like I said the high school that\nwe played against was my mom's old high\nschool Parkland and the most I scored in\nthe game up to them might have been like\n34 or 36.\nand I know that when death happens or\nthings happen for me A lot of times I\nget quiet right and a lot of times\nthat's because I'm just trying to\ncollect my thoughts or\ntrying to breathe or I don't necessarily\nknow what I'm always thinking but I knew\nthat I wanted to try to honor my\ngranddad somehow some way and I didn't\nwant\neverybody to know you know I'm one of\nthose people that just like try to get\nit done right get it done and\nwhen it happened and I had 59 and I\ndrove and I I scored the 61st point\nI think about that was\n20 years ago right 20 years ago so\nI had I couldn't foresee that I would be\nin the NBA all this different type stuff\nbut um\nthat was the highlight right and I just\nnever forget being so tired and\nexhausted because emotionally I've been\ndrained right had literally been drained\nand seeing my dad over there on the\nbench and my brother what not just made\nit that much more emotional and I knew\nlike right then that all my family was\nin town or whatnot and that's something\nthat would always connect us for the\nrest of our lives yeah I think I think\nfor so many people who went through\nsomething like that 20 years ago\nit's easy to for all of us on the\noutside to look back now and see\nhow incredible it is but uh for so many\npeople that would have been a very valid\nreason to give up on their dream or for\nit to\nnot happen because it you know it\nderails you and it can derail your life\nand that would be completely valid but\nto actually look back at it now and go\nthis career is dedicated to this person\nthrough your lens\nit's it's remarkable to think that you\ncan find the courage to step up again\nand go from there yeah I think what's\neven crazier for me probably at this\npoint in my life is that I've actually\nbeen without my grandfather longer than\nI was with him right and I never think\nabout that you sort of just live or\nwhatnot but there is literally almost\nnothing that I can do on a daily basis\nthat I don't think about him you know\nand what's crazy is in the book\num\nI think I said something about uh one of\nhis favorite scriptures being\nPhilippians 4 13 I can do all things\nthrough Christ who strengthens me and\nthat video I just found when he's\nstanding up thanking everybody for\ncoming to\num his birthday thing he says that wow\nand he gave me goosebumps he says that\nin the video so one thing about it I'm\ngonna tell my daddy to keep keep finding\nvideos because it's uh it's it's really\nnice to have yeah and that's not the\nwatch though that's a different one no\nno no this isn't the watch but uh\nvasharon right this is a 2-2-2 yeah I\nliterally got this watch because it\nlooks looks like the one yeah the way\nyou describe down it's like yeah yeah\nthis watch looks like it and I mean I\nthink I talk about how\nstrict my parents were growing up there\nwas no earrings no nothing like this or\nwhatnot no tattoos or whatnot but last\nsummer I got this this tattoo right here\nwhich is Chevron logos right yeah uh for\nmy granddad yeah I love getting to do\nthis because I even even just sitting\nwith you right now I'm like I'm thinking\nmind I'm so grateful that I came out\ntoday to sit with you to have this\nopportunity because\nyou know it takes a lot of courage to\nsit with someone and for them to open up\nin this way and obviously you have a\nbook to do it and I was really fortunate\nto have the same experience to sit down\nwith Kobe in\n2019 2019 2019 yeah 2019 it would have\nbeen it was it was literally like two\nmonths before his tragic accident so I\ngot to interview him and we didn't we\ndidn't know each other in the same way\nwe don't know each other but I felt like\nthere was a real connection it was such\na such a gravitas in such a presence\nwhen he spoke and just his demeanor with\nthe team and just everything and and\neven today like you know I think when\nwhen you talk about not being able to\nplay with someone but knowing what could\nhave been but you again even today you\nwere like you look up and you know honor\nhim in that way like\nhow how do you navigate what ifs in your\ncareer I feel like that again as an\nathlete is such a skill because there's\nso many what-ifs like what if I did that\nplayed it that way played with this but\nlike you know and so talk us through\nthat because I think even in life like\nthat's what your whole book about just\nfor everyone who's listening\nChris's whole book is about what his\ngranddad told him off the court which\napplies on the court and then on the\ncourt lessons that are play off the\ncourt right and there's this beautiful\nSynergy but I think there are so many\npeople listening and watching right now\nwho live their life and what ifs yeah\nand you've had a lot of what ifs that's\nthe big one you call out in the book How\ndo you how do you breathe and live\nthrough that you know what it's 24\nchapters in my book you know what I mean\nas a tribute to Kobe you know what I\nmean and I was actually on the phone\nwith Adam Silver yesterday and I brought\nup a Kobe quote talking to him and I\nactually talked to Vanessa every now and\nthen too\num that's probably one of the coolest if\nnot the best award that I've gotten\nsince I've been in the NBA was uh uh\nyear before last they started a Kobe and\nGigi award and I was able to get the uh\nthe first one that they did and so code\nwas just different right in the way he\napproached things but the way we\ncompeted against each other and I think\nin the book what I keep talking about\nwhen you say\num the what ifs right\nI always say if there was one thing that\nI could change in my entire career it\nwouldn't be wins and losses it would be\nhow I rehabbed after my very first\nsurgery\nright so I had surgery on my Meniscus\nback in 2009 right and I was so young\n2009 2010 and I was so young at the time\nthat it was like\nall right they did the surgery okay I'm\ngonna be fine right didn't really take\nrehab that serious because I was just so\nyoung it was like okay they fixed it I'm\ngonna be fine\num but because of that I've had so many\ndifferent things over my career\ndifferent hamstring things or whatnot\nand\nme and my agent was talking about it the\nother day but sort of the story of my\ncareer has been the different situations\nthat have happened over my career how\nI've learned from them right so an\ninjury that I had right it taught me\nsomething and I was like okay I'm gonna\nfigure out how to how this gonna make me\nbetter right I get traded or whatnot\nokay they feel like I ain't performing\nwell enough I'm not playing enough games\nhow is this gonna make me better so\nevery time something has happened\nright you know I gotta talk about in the\nbook the craziest thing probably one of\nthe crazy things in my career was that\ninjury in Houston when I got hurt and we\nwere\na game away from going to the NBA finals\nand so\nhad that not happen had I not hurt my\nhamstring that year and then heard it\nagain the next year I don't think I\nstill would be playing in the league\nright now\nbecause all of that stuff was a wake-up\ncall to me it was like I gotta change\nsomething I got to change something I\ngot to figure this out and once all that\nstuff happens\nall right so if you if you if you sit\naround and I'll tell you this if you sit\naround and dwell on that whatever too\nlong somebody gonna pass you by you know\nso if you sitting over there trying to\nfigure out what if\nsomebody else over here gonna take your\njob yeah yeah yeah definitely and then\nthat's and I love that idea if this\nhappened what can I do better this\nhappened what can I do better that that\nmentality is like continuous Improvement\nand rededication as opposed to exactly\ninstead of what if it might be what's\nnext you know what I mean because\nyeah you can sit back and chill and me\nand Cove every now and then be like man\nwe play together we play together yeah\nwhat not but\neverybody can't do it but I can\ncompartmentalize that I can talk about\nthis what if but I'm still you know I\nstill got my eye on what's what what the\ngoal is yeah yeah I think I think a lot\nof us live in what if but we all have to\nlearn to live in what is yeah and then\nwhat's next as you said because that\nthat's what we have yep and and I love\nhearing it's great but what I appreciate\nis it's a Nuance it's really subtle what\nyou just said there and I want people to\nappreciate it because what you're saying\nis I can feel this way I can\ncompartmentalize it and I can move on\nand I think that's super healthy because\nI think a lot of us pretend like we\ndon't have what-ifs right like it's\nreasonable and I love what you just well\nwe do injury it's a lot it's very easy\nto walk around I've got no regrets I\nhave no what ifs in my life but the\ntruth is we all have them yeah and if\nyou don't address them they're gonna\ncome up somewhere exactly but but you're\nsaying no you have it compartmentalize\nit and then focus on one next because\nyou're gonna be sitting around telling\nthem High School stories or whatnot that\ndon't know about care about no more\nyeah and that and that happens to all of\nus we can all live in Nostalgia and\nright walk down memory lane uh Chris\nthis has been such a such an honor to\nsit with you is there something that I\nhaven't asked you or something that's in\nyour heart and mind right now before I\nhave a couple more questions but is\nthere anything that I haven't asked you\nor something that's on your heart and\nmind right now that you really want to\nshare that oh you feel I haven't touched\non no just the the appreciation for this\nand being able to talk and tell my story\nthrough the book and I hope people can\nreally feel that it was it was really\nabout that it was about letting people\nunderstand and know about me and make\nsure that people understand that look my\nfamily like anybody else has got their\nissues everybody\nisn't all like loving and all this stuff\non each other at all times I mean\nextended family or whatnot but at the\nend of the day it's my family you know\nand as long as you you know try to work\nthrough different things with you and\nyours I promise you\num you know you'll appreciate it in\nthere yeah I love that well Chris we end\nevery on-purpose episode with the final\nfive and these ones have to be answered\nin one word to one sentence maximum but\nI always change the rules so we'll we'll\ntry uh Chris what's the best advice and\nI'm guessing it's gonna be from Grandpa\nbut what's the best advice you've ever\nheard or received ah never delay\ngratitude I was actually from my college\ncoach good process walk us through that\nactually I want to hear more yeah never\ndelay gratitude and that means you know\nif you're grateful or thankful for\nanything be sure and tell people you\nknow be sure and tell people like I\ndon't care where I'm at what's going on\nwhenever I get off the phone with my\nparents my wife my kids or whatnot as\nalways I love you you know those times\nwhen you say you're gonna tell somebody\nsomething in the morning or something\nlike that like you just never you\nabsolutely never know what's gonna\nhappen so never delay gratitude and that\nwas a coach you said that to you how did\nhow did that apply to Sport and why how\ndid why did he introduce because that's\nso interesting to get from a like a\nbasketball coach yeah so I talk about\nCoach process a lot yeah of course yes\nhe's he's one of the most three most\ninfluential men in my life and he just\nhad all of these sayings right never\ndelay gratitude if you can't be on time\nbe early uh don't be a two to four guy\nbe a four to two guy and it was just all\nthese different things and the reason\nthat never delay gratitude thing how it\nrelated to sports was it's hard to win a\ngame\nright it's hard to win one game let\nalone make it to the playoffs like our\ncoach the other night when we clinched\nto make it to the playoffs in the locker\nroom he just told everybody he said\nlisten I'm grateful for you guys we\nalways talk about gratitude it's a lot\nof teams that's going home and going on\nvacation but you know don't take it for\ngranted that you get a chance to play in\nthe playoffs yeah that's awesome man I\nlove that I think a lot of young\nathletes who are listening or if you\nhave kids who are young athletes like\nthat's great advice because often that\nkind of softer touch is is missed like\nyou don't think it's this yeah but when\nI say never delay gratitude I also mean\nfor like kids to your parents like when\nI'm at my basketball camps I always make\nall the kids stand up and turn around\nand tell their parents thanks because\nlike I said in the book my dad spent his\nentire 401K on me and my brother playing\ntribal basketball so that's where these\nkids they get to go do all these camps\nand all this stuff and don't delay\ngratitude tell your parents thank you\nbecause every kid is not getting that\nopportunity yeah actually I want to I\nwant to take a side note on that because\none of the things I was blown away by a\nNew Journey is just how much purpose and\ngiving back and service is such a big\npart of how your your foundation the way\nit's set up your when you walk through\nthe you know the the murder of and the\ndeath of George Floyd and black lives\nmatter and then how you're dealing with\nit in the bubble and of course with your\nrole at the time and you talk about how\nlike you changed the messaging three\ntimes I went from peace yeah to to I\nforgot what the other one say her name\nyeah I think it was equality equality\nyeah correct yeah yeah exactly and and\nyou shift through it and I was just\nthinking like there's just so much\nintention in your life with all the work\nthat you've chosen to do uh what What's\nbeen kind of like a meaningful fruit or\nresult that you've seen that has really\nit's a it's a lot of different things\nand I'm fortunate to have an amazing\nteam that works with me or whatnot\nbecause obviously I'm dealing with a lot\nof different things on a given given day\nand trying to be the best athlete that I\ncan be but they're constantly bringing\ndifferent things uh saying hey would you\nlike to support this or could you do\nthis and uh I'm always trying to as much\nas I can and I think the most valuable\nthing that I have is time so even if\nit's before a game or after a game given\na young kid an opportunity to watch me\nwarm up or taking a picture with him and\njust giving them your undivided\nattention for for five minutes is one of\nthe most valuable things that you can do\nwith anybody yeah absolutely and I just\nI want to read this out because it's so\nit's so powerful so last March Chris was\nthe only athlete appointed to President\nBiden's Advisory board on historically\nblack colleges and universities and and\nthat's been I mean that that's\nincredible that you've become a a\nspokesperson and a champion for for that\nis there some of the work there that's\nresonated or some stories that you think\noh man\num it's probably so many yeah well we\ngot a lot of different things what we've\ndone is uh me and my brother a few years\nago and then Carmen actually did it too\nwe went to this business class at\nHarvard with uh Anita Albers\num a Benz class business education\nmanagement Sports I think and\nafter going to that class at Harvard we\nwere like why isn't this\ncurriculum or course offered at hbcus\nand\nwe got to work and Anita helped with it\nand now we have that course at a few\ndifferent hbcus wow right so just always\ntrying to figure out how we can make\nsome type of impact equality again\nexactly equal action yeah equal access\nto education it's incredible I'm glad\nI'm glad we went there actually uh\nsecond question what is the worst advice\nyou've ever heard or received worst\nadvice uh that cheese tastes good\ncheese is disgusting\nlike seriously I've never had a\ncheeseburger macaroni and cheese none of\nthat it's disgusting I thought you do my\ncheeses and money\nliteral yeah yeah literally okay so you\ndon't like cheese at all at all no no\nnot even on Pizza no no no no I'm cool\nno cheesy fries\nmy brother when we used to get home from\nschool he used to go in the refrigerator\nand get the block achieved what is that\nI don't even know us that string cheese\nkind of like I think I know what you\ndoing yeah I don't know I used to have\nto take plastic off the side yeah I'm\ndoing nothing but put mucus all in his\nbody nasty\nalso uh question number three how would\nyou define your current purpose you know\nbasketball and athlete that's that's\nwhat I do not necessarily all of who I\nam but just just trying to help make a\ndifference in in different aspects of\nlife whether it be hbcus whether it be\nhealth and wellness I think that's been\na big thing that I've become passionate\nabout the past four or five years is\ntrying to figure out how to make some of\nthese health things more accessible\nright and make people more aware like\nI'm always curious about\nthis\num that whatever it may be I'm so\ncurious about water and the things that\npeople are eating and all these\ndifferent type things and trying to make\nsure that other people become aware like\nI am and the other biggest purpose is\nwhatever I have to do for my family\nright whatever I have to do do for my\nfamily especially my wife and kids is\njust trying to figure out how I can\ncontinue to pour into them question\nnumber four uh what What's your reaction\nto the title point guard oh man uh the\nthe point guard thing has been\nit's crazy I don't even know when it\nstarted I don't even know when I when it\nstarted but uh it's a privilege right\nlike a honor basically that people see\nyou playing the game the right way now\nit ain't something like worshiping thing\nor whatnot but uh I get really like kind\nof shy and bashful when people say that\nor whatnot but uh it's it's cool to be\neven in that consideration and playing\nfor as long as I played still uh Fifth\nand final question if you could create\nwe asked this to every guest who's ever\nbeen on the show if you could create one\nlaw that everyone in the world had to\nfollow what would it be take your time\nno way one law yeah everybody in the\nworld everyone in the world had to\nfollow what would it be and take your\ntime there's no reason oh that is\neverybody got to get them guns up man\neverybody everybody come turn them in\neverybody come turn them in everybody so\nwe got some beef or something like that\nor somebody got to do something you got\nto fight it out you got to fight it out\nI don't know that was the first thing\nyeah yeah that's awesome thank you Chris\nPaul everyone Chris incredible Memoir 61\nmake sure you don't grab it we're going\nto put the link in the comments and the\ncaptions across the board I wanted to go\nread this book if you're already a fan\nof Chris you're gonna love it if you're\nlearning about Chris through this you're\ngonna love it even more because it's\nit's truly a remarkable story of love of\nsacrifice of connection of generations\npassing on beautiful lessons uh you've\ngot like four or five generations in the\nbook being talked about so I hope you go\nand grab a copy of 61 Chris Paul it's\nbeen a pleasure and honesty\nyou're a real one

and to watch you\nvisualize it and to watch you telling it\nfrom memory and then for you to share\nthat story about finding that tape or\nyour father finding that tape I mean\njust really grateful man thank you for\nthis man I appreciate you Jay thank you\nthank you thank you man if you love this\nepisode you'll love my interview with\nKobe Bryant on how to be strategic and\nobsessive to find your purpose our\nchildren have become less imaginative\nabout how to problem solve and parents\nand coaches have become more directive\nin trying to tell them how they behave\nversus teaching them how to be"
