    "transcript": "how do you feel you have the number one\nalbum in the country and I remember\nsaying I've never been more unhappy in\nmy life let's say you spend 20 years of\nyour life working towards a goal that's\ngoing to solve everything and nothing\nchanges that's when you get hopeless the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nwho have you created like who are you\nlike at the core of it how do you see\nyourself I think we live in a world\ntoday where\npeople create who we are to us in our\nown minds our families and friends\ncreate us our the media we consume\ncreates us and I think everyone will\nagree that we have so many influences\nbut who's the you you're trying to\ncreate or have tried to create over the\nlast few decades I don't know if trying\nwould be the word I would use I would\nsay um I'm true to whoever's inside\nthere I don't look at the outside\nvery much I look Inward and try to focus\non\nwhat do I feel\nwhat am I seeing in the hopes that by\nsharing what's going on in me it maybe\nresonates with someone else I can't\npredict what someone else would like\nand I don't think anybody can so if I'm\ntrue authentically true to myself that's\nthe best chance of someone else liking\nsomething so I would say tuning into\nmyself\nand being honest with myself and\nanything I can do to get closer to\nunderstanding what I like and why I like\nit and what I don't like and why I don't\nlike it is helpful in in the work that I\ndo yeah I I love that idea of almost\nlike a personal check-in or a sense\ncheck and it's interesting we do it\nafter we eat food like you know whether\nyou like the restaurant or you didn't\nlike a restaurant or it's it's\nautomatically it's funny because I've\nbeen asked about like how can you be so\nconfident in your opinion it's like if\nyou taste food\nhow confident can you be if you like it\nor you don't like it it's so clear it's\nso face value yeah and I think we tend\nto overthink and put layers on top of\nsomething as simple as it tastes really\ngood I like it or you know what this\none's not for me yeah it's as simple as\nthat absolutely and and why do you think\nit is though that over the years we've\nall as humans from your perspective your\nopinion I'd be fascinated to know you've\nworked with so many people who also make\nthings that are fascinating to billions\nof people on the planet right there's we\nall experience what it feels like to get\n5 10 people to laugh at a joke or listen\nto something we do but when you're\ncreating at that scale what in your\nopinion has made us so addicted to\nwanting\nto become someone that people like and\noften go against who we truly are you\njust said you you like to sense that\nauthenticity and feel how you feel\na lot of people are scared of that a lot\nof people would rather mold and become\nmalleable and evolve and become who\npeople want them to be why are we why do\nyou think that is people like to be\naccepted people want to be accepted and\nI'm suggesting in the book that the the\nbest way to be accepted is to be\nyourself it's not it's not to change\nyourself to what someone else thinks\nfirst of all you don't really know what\nsomeone else thinks\nand if you're not genuine to yourself\nthere's there's like nothing nothing is\nthere\nit's just a projection or a mask it's\nnot true and there's something about\nauthenticity like I get to work with\nartists\nsome of whom have very different ways of\nseeing the world than me\nand I support their Vision a million\npercent even though whatever they're\ntalking about maybe I may be\ndiametrically opposed to what they're\ntalking about but I support them a\nmillion percent and anything I can do to\nsupport them getting their message\nacross the clearest they can I support\nthat\nthe only way we can um learn anything is\nthrough the reality of seeing what's\naround us and learning there are these\ndifferent points of view around us if\nwe're all thinking the same thing it's\nboring why would we make anything if\neveryone thinks the same thing what\nmakes us interesting are the differences\nand even even the imperfections the\nimperfections are what makes us humans\nwhat makes us what we are it's like\nthere's so much talk today about chat\nGPT and AI it's like it's a different\nthing\nthan a human sharing their own\nexperience\nwarts and all that's what we love we\nlove you know you may hear a song about\num someone who has terrible heartbreak\nand you may not be experiencing terrible\nheartbreak but hearing them\nhonestly talk about a human experience\neven one that we're not having can make\nus cry can make us resonate with them\ncan give us a better understanding of\nthe world absolutely and we're not all\neverything you know we're all only us\neach of us is ourselves\nyeah one thing when I was reading your\nbook it reminded me of\nsomething else I read a while ago and\nwhat I read said that the Japanese say\nwe have three faces one face that we\nshow the entire world\nthe second phase is the face that we\nonly show our family and friends\nand the third face they say we show no\none at all maybe not even ourselves\nsometimes we don't even but what you're\nsaying is almost like when we tap into\nthat Essence and become that self that's\nwhere all this beauty and Imagination\nand creativity stems from yeah it's the\nmost in it seems to be the most\ninteresting and the most particular you\nknow um in a sea of information\nthe more yours is personal the more it's\nnot like hers or his or theirs\nit's it's yours yeah and\nfor all of us we get more of a sense of\nreality\neven if our views are different than\neveryone else's it's still helps us\nunderstand this is this place that we're\nin where there are these there are these\ndifferent views it's interesting when I\nspeak someone who has a different view\non anything I always want to learn more\nhow did you get there what can I learn\nfrom you\nyou know I never assume that I know\nanything were you always like that or\nwhether experiences in your childhood\nthat informed that because I feel like\nthere are a lot of people more generally\nspeaking and I don't like to stereotype\nbut just as an overall sense\na lot of the reasons why we struggle\nwith doing what you just said is\ndefending our Viewpoint gives us a sense\nof Safety and Security and we feel\nvulnerable if someone else's Viewpoint\nthat seems opposite to us could be true\nso that's one reason the second is we\ngenerally struggle as humans to\nentertain two opposing ideas we struggle\nto understand the Nuance that someone\ncan be kind but also be assertive or\nsomeone can be complex yet really\ncompassionate like they can be these\nparadoxes that exist I was reading\nrecently about how black and white TVs\nare not really black and white they're\nShades of Gray there is no black and\nwhite pixel it's really really minute\nshades of Shades of Gray that are\nchanging so\nwere you always that way always that\ncurious did that start somewhere does\nthat come from parent where did that\ncome for you I'm intrigued I would say\nI've always been open-minded earlier in\nmy career I probably had more of a view\nof I know how to do it like I know my\nway and my way was fine\nbut over the years I've realized that my\nway isn't necessarily the best way it's\njust one way and there are many other\nways that are great\nI was a vegan for 22 years and now I'm\nmainly carnivore\nwhen you've really committed to a vegan\nlifestyle it's very difficult to break\nout of it and for about a year I was a\nI believe that eating meat was the\nhealthiest thing I could do but I\ncouldn't do it because I was a vegan I\nwas committed to\nbeing a vegan so it's a perfect example\nbecause it was something I was dedicated\nto for a long period of time I had new\ninformation it was hard to change it was\nhard to break out of it but as we get\nnew information\nwe have to evolve how can we how can we\nlive in an old belief if you believe the\nsame thing that you believed 20 years\nago about everything I don't know that\nyou're living and so we've we've got to\nhave that openness and the ability to\nmy curiosity a curiosity about what's it\nlike if if my view is my view of the\nworld is wrong what does someone else\nknow what can I learn from not to\ndisregard what someone else thinks like\nwhy do they think that what\nI know there's something I can learn\nfrom someone who sees it differently\nthan me and I want to understand it yeah\nand that's exactly why I asked you about\nyour past because I feel that\nI always try and study someone's past in\norder to understand how they came to a\nconclusion because or even their\nbehavior is often the people that I feel\nact in ways that seem unreasonable or\nways that I don't\nagree with when I track back and look at\ntheir past I can often be like oh there\nare the dots and and they can probably\nsee them too of why they've chosen that\npath not that that path is right or\nwrong\num it takes a lot to go beyond right and\nwrong because these constructs are so\nand that's what I feel this book does\nthis book in itself\nbreaks the construct of what a book is\nright like that when I picked it up I I\nwas assuming that I was going to read a\nmemoir or like stories and tell I I\nassume that's what it would be in my\nbelief system of what a book is by a\nprominent figure who's had a life such\nas yours and then I opened it up and I\nwas like wait a minute this is like this\nis not what I was expecting and I'm\nseeing like poetry and I'm seeing like\nRhymes and I'm seeing just short\nReflections and some really beautiful\neven exercises and activities that you\nsuggest and I thought even in this book\nyou're breaking down what someone sees\nas a book I mean the cover does that\nit's stunning and it's like that's\nsomething I would love to help people\ndevelop because I think it's a skill\nit's a habit and you talk about habits\nin the book and we're only as creative\nas the habits we keep you say\nhow do we develop that mindset is there\na step-by-step system or is it something\nthat you just start tomorrow and you now\nare more Curious when something\nconflicting comes your way it's\nsomething you get better at the more you\npractice and meditation is a great tool\nto\nquiet ourselves enough to get in touch\nwith how we see the world the closer we\ncan get to what we see that's a starting\nposition to be able to\nthen understand how someone else sees it\nand it's interesting to be able to learn\nto argue\nthe points opposite what you believe you\nknow if you don't understand all sides\nof of the story you don't really\nunderstand the story\nso it's helpful to understand the whole\npicture and be hold all of the beliefs\nsoftly enough to\nbe surprised and learn something new and\nchange everything you know the book is\ncalled the creative act and it is about\nbeing creative\nmore than even doing things that are\ncreative but have you ever sacrificed\ncreativity for anything on any project\nor in any personal Endeavor in life\nwhere creativity\nhad to be sacrificed or you felt pushed\nto sacrifice the way you felt it was\nbeing\nwhere there was a bit of a part of it I\nwas like I might have to let go in the\nworld of Art\nI feel Fearless I feel like\nwhatever strikes me as this is what's\ninteresting to me\nI'm good with that it doesn't extend as\nstrongly into life\nI know people who are completely\nFearless in life I'm I'm not there yet I\nit's very impressive I love it but\nwithin the confines of creativity and\nmaking things I know\num and only I know it through experience\nI started only making things I liked\nluckily people like them otherwise I'd\nhave a different job I would still be\nmaking things because it was always my\npassion I never thought it would be my\nwork\nI I always knew I would make things\nbecause that's what I love to do I\nthought I would have a regular straight\njob to support my habit of making things\nand then miraculously\num the universe allowed me to make\nthings as a as a full-time thing in life\nit's crazy yeah it's amazing how we\nalways talk about how like life imitates\nour or imitates life and why has it been\nharder to translate\nfrom art to life that idea of\nfearlessness what are the things that\nyou find yourself\nfearing in life that that you find so\neffortless here there's a life and death\ncommitment in art\nthat's different than the life and death\ncommitment in life jumping out of an\nairplane is different than you know\ntelling a controversial joke I can\nremember recently four or five years ago\nI had open heart surgery and I was\nreally afraid and I was with a an artist\nfriend who's a Fearless artist\nand and I told me I'm going into the\nsurgery I'm really nervous he's like oh\nyou're gonna be fine no why are you even\nthinking about that like that's that's a\ncrazy thought because he's confident\nhe's Fearless in life\nstill the the normal fears of Life get\nme but in art I know the real power in\nit\nis going to The Fringe edges of where\nyou can go that's what it the purpose of\ndoing it is to see how far you can take\nit so I feel in a way obligated to do\nthat it's like no that's what's that's\nwhat's most interesting to me\nyou know there's so much middle of the\nroad\nand it doesn't interest me I want it\nbecause it's louder\nquieter\nsofter\nharder it's pushing some boundary that's\nwhy I take notice it's not more of the\nsame it's not just another\nit's the one that makes use like you\nstopping did I really hear that did I\nreally see that\nwhat's going on here you know what you\nsee a movie where you have to lean\nforward and pay attention like what's\nhappening\nit's not just the audience's hand is\nbeing held and walked through a story\nsimply\nI like the um the complexity and\ndifficulty\nthat forces me as the viewer to\nparticipate in what's going on\nI'm not just being carried along I'm\nintrigued if you'd be happy to go there\nhow do you\nuse some of the creativity that you\nfound in art in order to navigate some\nof the fears in life\nis it helpful it is helpful and and one\nof the things is\nrealizing the attitude we bring to\nthings changes it completely so the same\nevent could be terrifying or we can\ndecide it's okay and it's the same exact\nevent it's just a mentality I had an\nexperience\nyears ago I grew up in a place where\nthere were no insects\nuh wow yeah where I grew up was just a\nvery uh contained protected environment\nso I was and my mom was afraid of\ninsects so I grew up with this feeling\nof insects as foreign and scary and I\nwas in Hawaii about\nseven years ago\nand there are centipedes that can sting\nyou they don't kill you but they're very\npainful\nand I'd always and I've been going to\nKauai for a long time and was aware of\nthem and in the back of my mind afraid\nof them\nand one night I woke up my head was\nitchy I brushed my head and I felt\nsomething extremely painful\nand I said to my wife\nI think I was just stung by a centipede\nand I have one of two choices\ncan Panic which is what my entire life\nhas led me up to\nor I can decide it's okay and go back to\nsleep\nand she said the second one sounds\nbetter\nI'll do that 20 years ago I don't know\nif I could have done that 30 years ago I\ndon't I'm sure I couldn't have done that\nthe Panic is what I've been trained for\nmy whole life that's that conditioning\nwhere we're all as you said trained\nconditioned prepared for in a certain\nway yeah even even things that we don't\nknow about like we may be afraid did you\nknow that people were not afraid of\nsharks before the movie Jaws no I did\nnot know that the reason everyone's\nafraid of sharks is because of the movie\nJaws wow that I mean that makes a lot of\nsense that makes the world yeah change\nthe world yeah and it's unbelievable how\nyeah what we seek or what we shun comes\nfrom a movie or a song or a visual\ndemonstration of what whatever it may be\nand\nI I find\nthey had so many fears are not real and\nas we're talking about fear only so\noften exists mainly in the mind and and\nthat's what we're talking about is a\nconstruct of the Mind\nwhen we're talking about creativity you\naddress this fear head-on in the\nbeginning because it is a fear\neveryone has somewhat of a fear just as\nwe say things like oh I can't sing we\nsay things like oh well I'm not creative\nor I'm not artistic or I've never really\nbeen a creative I'm more academic or\nwhatever it may be we have these again\nconstructs right and wrong academic\ncreative mostly Polar Opposites\nand\nyou're actually saying no no this is\nsomething everyone can access and has\naccess to and do and do access and do\naccess yeah we just don't all\nacknowledge it but deciding to take a\ndifferent route home because there's a\ntraffic jam in front of you and figuring\nout the way to go that's a creative\ndecision cooking food and it tasting a\ncertain way and you think oh maybe it'll\ntaste better if I add this to it that's\na creative decision we all do them every\nday we make creative choices anytime we\ndo something that's not exactly the same\nas the way we did it yesterday the\nreason it's different is because we made\na creative Choice yeah absolutely as\nsimple as that as simple as this\nsprinkle of this or that yeah so we're\nall doing it and the book is uh an\ninvitation to open that channel\nas far and freely as you can it really\ndoes that I really believe it does that\nI I what I love about it is\nyou can truly turn to any page and I\nknow they say this about a lot of books\nand I I don't think it's true for most\nbooks to be honest because if you pick a\nrandom book a random page of a book it\nthe context is completely out whereas\nwith this there truly is that sense of\nif you're looking for that creativity if\nyou're trying to seek it within yourself\nthere's something that will inspire you\nwhat have you found over the years\nworking with artists working with\nyourself what have been the biggest\nblocks\nto creativity or to accessing that what\nare the biggest blocks is it I know and\nand I'll touch on a few that I'm\nintrigued by and curious about but what\nwould you say are the biggest blocks\nthat people have to being truly creative\nand imaginative one big block is\nconcerns about what other people think\nthat's a big one I I made this thing\nthat I love but I think other people\nwould like it more if I made it\ndifferent for them\nwe don't know what they would like it's\na it's a really it's all in our head it\ncomes back to this thing of what I think\nisn't good enough\nyou know if I like it that doesn't mean\nanything\nthat's what people think it's like just\nbecause I like it that doesn't give it\nany value it's like as an artist if you\nlike it that's all of the value that's\nthe success comes when you say I like\nthis enough for other people to see it\nnot other people like it so it's\nsuccessful that doesn't mean anything\nbecause that's other people liking it is\nout of your control\nall that's in your control is making the\nthing to the best of your ability I talk\nabout it usually the way I talk about it\nis greatness and that's the way I\nthought of it my whole life was\nmy interest is in making something great\ngreatness lasting greatness Timeless and\nI came to realize recently it's all an\noffering to God and if you're making an\noffering to God you're not thinking\nabout oh what's the budget or I hope I\nhope these this segment of the audience\nis gonna like it we don't we don't think\nlike that it's a higher vibration\nwe're making the best we can make to the\nbest of our ability\nout of love and devotion that's what it\nis and there is no\nI'm changing it for someone else because\nit can't be better than this devotional\nact that we're doing\nthere is no higher no higher form and\nthat's what you see so much in in nature\naround us I've always found like the sun\nis just selflessly serving and giving\nand you see a bush of flowers or you see\na tree that's growing fruits and again\nit's providing shade and fruit and it's\njust serving and it's interesting how\nwhen you call it a devotional act the\nidea that it's it's a service it's an\noffering as you said absolutely in that\nlanguage and even an offensive song is\nthat to someone to someone it's like\num I worked with Van Slayer and Slayer\nwere a very controversial aggressive\nband and the people who came to see them\ndidn't come to see them in filled with\nhate they came they came to see them\nfilled with love and for many of the\npeople in the audience maybe the only\nexperience of Love they had was\nconnecting over Slayer you know there\nwere there were people in the audience\nwho seemed like other than this thing to\ndevote themselves passionately to\nseemed like\noften hopeless people\nand for them to have something that they\nlove\nwas beautiful to witness and that that\nsounds like one I think you're spot on\nthat that fear of what will people think\nwhat will people say art versus audience\nalmost and I feel that that has become\nsuch a big challenge in today's world\nbecause there's so much data available\nsocial media available and you get\ninstant feedback right so I think in the\npast a band would lock themselves in a\nshed or whatever it may be and then work\non stuff and maybe their friends would\nlisten or they would listen and but it\nwould take months before the audience\nheard it today you could literally\nrecord something in three seconds put it\nup and get instant feedback and so the\nfeedback loop has got shorter the time\nto create something has got shorter it's\neasier to publish and it's easier to get\ncriticism or feedback and so\nin that world I find us looking so much\nat like what's the data saying of the\ntrends of the pace of music or the\nfrequency of music or whatever and\nthat's obviously only music but you\ncould apply that to anything else do you\nthink that that obsession\nin social media music movies of looking\nat it from a date of even in movies now\nI find like we're just taking old IP and\nremaking stuff there's there's very\nlittle new IP you just keep seeing old\nIP finding its way back into TV and\nmovies do you say that that's creativity\nbeing stifled and and is hampering\ncreativity absolutely and the beauty of\nit is because so much of what's being\nmade is being made that way\nthat if\nwe choose to make something not like\nthat it really stands out this book for\nexample it goes against all of the rules\nof publishing\nfrom the beginning I started the book\neight years ago and I met with\nPublishers eight years ago told them\nthis is my vision for this book and all\nof them said that's not the book anybody\nwants from you that's not the book and I\nsaid well it's that's the book I want to\nwrite yeah and like but surely you'll\ntell personal stories and you'll talk\nabout Johnny Cash you'll talk about it's\nlike no that's not what this is yeah\nit's a different book yeah and then I\ndecided not to make a publishing deal\nthen because even the ones who said they\nwould go along with what my vision was I\ncould see that they really were\nfantasizing a different book than this\nbook yeah I waited till the book was\nwritten and then said do you want to\npublish this book not the book you\nthink is the book that you want me to\nwrite but this is the book that I that I\nwrote that I wanted to write and wrote\ndo you want to publish this book and\nthen when they read it they're like oh\nyes watch this that's brilliant the\nreason I'm laughing so much is because I\nwith my first book I had I thought of\nthe title when I was writing it because\nit resonated to me because it was\nplayful but also curious and and it felt\ntrue to me it was the biggest reason why\nI chose an entirely just it felt like it\nwas truth and so the tile I'd I was\nproposing for my first book was think\nlike a monk and I'd lived as a monk for\nthree years I'd studied under these\nincredible monks and I wanted to share\nwhat I'd learned from these Masters\nwho'd spent 40 50 years living as monks\nand so the book was almost an offering\nto them in the way you're saying it a\ndevotional act back to my teachers and\nguides and every publisher is like Jay\nyou should just write a book about like\nhow to find your passion or like you\nknow like what you love in life and I\nwas just like that's there's Beauty in\nthat there's nothing wrong with the book\nabout how to find your passion that's\ngreat but that's not me like it's not my\nexperience it's not my book and I\nremember 15 out 14 out of 17 imprints\nsaid no to that title yeah and we still\nwent with it yes and I couldn't be more\nhappier because of that but you're right\nyou can't control what the audience\nwants even if you played every perfect\nmetric and game no but we think we can\nwe we think there's a part of us and\nthat's what I was going to ask you that\nalmost one end is saying I am too\nworried about what people think but the\nopposite almost is the ego of I can\neither control everything perfectly so\nthat this becomes the number one chart\ntopping song or I'm right and I know\neverything\nis that do you see that as a block to\ncreativity and how and and how do you\npurify that I think that the goal is to\nget to this this is how I see it I don't\nknow what other people are gonna think I\ncan't know what other people are gonna\nthink\nbut this is how I see it and I want to\nshow you how I see it that's my purpose\nhere on the planet is to show you how I\nsee it and then I want to see how you\nsee it and where do they line up and\nwhere are they different\nand that's how we make sense of the\nworld it's not one story yeah we all\nhave a story we all have something to\nsay and we can all learn from each other\nand it's it's fascinating it's like\nthere's\nthere are the same set of chords used in\nall the songs yet new songs keep coming\nyou know there's someone who say all the\nsongs have been written they're they've\nit keeps happening\nhow how do new jokes come up they're all\nit's like they're all the same but then\nthey're all different yeah and how how\nwe interpret it and are each and it\ncomes from each of our life experiences\nwhich are different we we each have our\nown family origin story we each have our\nown places that we grew up the things\nthat we saw we could go uh and do the\nsame thing together and then get back\nand discuss what we saw and see two\ncompletely different things and it's not\nlike one of us is right and one of us is\nwrong we're just noticing different\nthings there's so many data points to\ntake in and we each take in the ones\nthat\nspeak to us so true yeah you remind me\nof the famous words of Mark Twain of\nHistory never repeats itself but it\nalways Rhymes and that right that the\nidea of like yeah like the same song\ndoesn't come back but there's a rhyme\nthere's a there's the chord there's that\nbut but it's still different and and\nthere's some beautiful I want to point\nout to everyone because I I really do\nwant you to get this book everyone is\nlistening and watching right now uh and\nthere's I've like dog-eared some pages\nthat that have some really beautiful\nmoments I really like this because\none thing I really aim to do here on on\nthe podcast but also in life is to try\nand give people really practical Tiny\nSteps that they could take and you you\ndo that artfully in this book and there\nwas this section here uh which\nidentifies why I brought up now because\nexactly what you said breaking the\nsameness right and we think there's\nthe sameness will completeness and you\ngive these beautiful examples of things\npeople can do in order to do that and I\njust want to touch on a couple of them\nplease and would love to hear some\nexamples from you that where it worked\nso I really like this one change the\ncontext so you say there are times when\na singer doesn't connect with a song\nlike an actor whose line reading Falls\nflat it can be helpful to create a new\nmeaning or an additional backstory to a\nsong's lyrics A Love Song might sound\ndifferent if sung to a long lost soul\nmate a partner of 30 years that you\ndon't get along with a person you saw on\nthe street but never spoke to or your\nmother have you I was intrigued have you\never asked an artist to\nsing to someone real in their life\npotentially to get an emotion out yes\nthere's uh the first example that comes\nto mind is we were doing a cover of the\nsong the first time ever I saw your face\nwith Johnny Cash and he read the lyrics\nand he said I don't know if I could sing\nthis song I don't really feel these\nwords\nand I said well how about if it's a\ndevotional song to God\nIsaac I could sing that song\nand when he changed it to being\nnot singing it to a woman but singing it\nto God\nhe was able to tap into the energy of\nthe song and\nhe felt the vibration he felt he he felt\nthe trueness to him in singing it wow\nyeah and so he\nbut everyone still thought the song was\nabout a woman it is yeah it is\nyeah but there's there's a long history\nof songs that are\nlove songs that could be to a woman or\ncould be devotional yeah it's\ninteresting when songs walk this line or\nwhen we think we know what a song's\nabout yeah yeah and we think it's about\na romantic relationship when it's really\nabout their child you know these\ndevotional songs so and I'm sharing this\nwith all of you listening and watching\nbecause I know you I know where you're\nsitting there thinking Jay I\nprocrastinate I overthink I don't know\nhow to focus which we'll get into all of\nthat but I want to share these with you\nbecause I want you to try them out in\nyour own\narea in the world the work you do to\nchange the environment if we're looking\nfor a performance of a different nature\nit can help to change an element of the\nenvironment turning off the lights and\nplaying in the dark can create shift in\nConsciousness and break the chain of\nsameness from performance to Performance\nother shifts we've experimented with\ninclude having a singer hold the\nmicrophone instead of standing in front\nof it and recording early in the morning\ninstead of at night to access a greater\ndegree of variation one vocalist chose\nto hang upside down while singing could\nyou tell us some examples of those\nbecause I find that again these are just\nthey're so simple but we don't do it we\nwill sit at the same desk every day\nbanging our head against the wall with\nthe same tabs open on Google going why\ncan't I be creative and it's often these\nphysical tangible changes around us yeah\nyeah and so it happened in the studio\nit's not uncommon if we've played a song\nthree or four or five or six times and\nit just feels like it's not getting\nbetter or we've reached a certain Peak\nand it's really not all it could be but\nthen it starts not being as good usually\nwhen that happens as soon as you reach\nwhatever Peak you're at and it starts\ncoming down we usually stop playing the\nsong um but one thing we've done in the\npast also would be again changing the\ncontest turning the lights off in the\nstudio is it changes everything it's not\ntake seven it's the first take in the\ndark and it changes it changes the first\nalbum I recorded with the Red Hot Chili\nPeppers was their I think it was their\nfifth album and the albums that they had\ndone before they had all done in\ntraditional recording studios and them\nthey told me that none of those were\ngood experiences\nso he thought about what could we do for\nthis experience to make it the first\ndifferent one instead of the fifth if\nthe first four were bad could have been\nthe first good one in in the same\nenvironment or we could change the\nenvironment and it would be the first of\nany kind so we chose to rent this big\nhouse not far from here and record in\nthis mansion and that was very different\nthan showing up to recording studio with\npeople working in an office and other\nmusicians and other other places we had\nour whole own world that we created and\nand some of the members of the band\ndidn't leave during the entire I don't\nknow six weeks or two months they never\nleft the premises they just stayed there\nslept there\nate there worked there and um never left\nuntil it was done well yeah I love that\none uh invite an audience this one makes\nsense but but I think people need to do\nmore when an artist thrives on being in\nfront of a crowd we may bring in several\npeople to watch a session being observed\nchanges how an artist acts even if the\naudience consists only of on one person\nwho isn't part of the project that can\nbe enough while some artists May overdo\na performance for an audience and Others\nMay hold back most tend to be more\nfocused with someone else present even\nif your art is non-performative such as\nwriting or cooking it will still likely\nchange with an observer present the goal\nis to find the specific parameters in\neach case that bring out your best I I\nlove the idea I had a few friends a few\nyears ago one of their buddies wanted to\nbecome a stand-up comic but he had no\nexperience in stand-up comedy so they\nthrew him a stand-up show in their\nbackyard God and there were like 15 of\nus present in the audience he got\nannounced onto stage in front of an\naudience that wasn't gonna Heckle or be\nthe meanest to him and he got to\npractice and it was it was just such a\nbeautiful way a to do that for your\nfriends but to experience that and I'm\nI'm on tour at the moment this is my\nbreak period but for my test we were\npracticing rehearsing in a small theater\nin Thousand Oaks and so what does the\ntheater said to us is they could throw\nit out to their local\naudience members who would have no clue\nwho I was or what I was doing and they'd\ncome along little did I know that we'd\nhave like 50 to 100 people that weekend\nwatching the show just as a rehearsal\nyeah and it was so useful to me before I\nwent out and it was huge like absolutely\nhuge so I loved that one I was listening\nto a story on the way here I was\nlistening to a podcast in the car and it\ntold a story about The Beatles\num that when the Beatles were\ninterviewed individually\nthey were all these thoughtful\ninteresting Soulful people wow but when\nthey were interviewed even two together\nthey became sarcastic and never said\nmuch about about anything real\nand was much more of a performative cool\nlike to look cool in front of the other\none wow that just be being with each\nother changed the way that they appeared\nin the world\nwell yeah that that group aspect is so\ninteresting you've just sparked another\nthought for me that I think it would be\nreally interesting for people to hear\nyou going back to this it's interesting\nagain then being on their own\nallowed them to be more of their\nauthentic Deeper Self to some degree I\nguess I think it was in Bob iger's book\nwhere he talked about how he was saying\nthat George Lucas Spielberg\nTarantino and a bunch of others used to\nalmost have a movie Mastermind where\nthey'd play their movies to each other\nbefore they went out\nand he was saying that that's how\nconfident they felt about their own work\nbecause they were showing their\ncompetitors their movies yes but they\nweren't scared of anyone stealing an\nidea or taking a concept because they\nwere so confident who they were and all\ntheir friends were so confident in their\nStyles and we know that a Tarantino\nmovie versus a Spielberg movie has no\nsimilarities yeah and in some ways that\nCommunity we talk about that in the book\ntoo having a community of it doesn't\nhave to be people who do the same kind\nof art as you but people who just taste\nyou you respect you like what they do\nthey like what you do and being able to\nshare your work back and forth is a\nreally great feeling yeah how have you\nthat's that's a really nice segue how is\nthat how has that affected how you've\nlearned to filter criticism and feedback\nbecause again going back to the world we\nlive in today because of that instant\nfeedback loop you can have a hundred\ncomments that are negative on social\nmedia your song didn't make it it's not\nas big as the next album you have the\ntop 10 shot you didn't make it I think\nthe way everything's measured and\nbroadcasted now can make criticism and\nfeedback in one sense seem louder before\nyou went into a room and someone told\nyou you weren't getting a new deal and\nno one knew today you didn't get a new\ndeal and the whole world knows and your\nfans know and the opposing fans you know\nit's messy it's like how have you\nworked on that for yourself and the work\nyou've done and even the artists that\nyou work with who I'm guessing may be\nmore sensitive to it may not have that\nnatural confidence or groundedness in\nwhat it is\nhow do you how and even people are\nlistening today how do we think about\nfeedback and criticism most of the\nartists I work with don't read any any\ncriticism or reviews that they work good\nor bad most\nsome some do and I would say the ones\nwho are the strongest in who they are\ncan even read a terrible review and\nlaugh at it and that makes sense because\nwhen someone gives you criticism it's\ntelling you as much about who they are\nas what you've made\nit's like we make things and then we\nmake it with one\nthrough our filter our perspective and\nthen you receive it through your filter\nwith your perspective so even if we both\nlike it we probably don't like it the\nsame way for the same reasons we all\nhave our own relationship to it everyone\nhas their own relationship to it so any\nof these metrics of which is better like\nthe idea of the Oscars or uh the Grammys\nwhere we're saying which which album is\nbetter than another it doesn't make any\nsense to me because it's always apples\nand oranges if you have a Drake and\nBeyonce and you're deciding which\nalbum's better well Drake's album is\nclearly a better Drake album than\nBeyonce's album is and Beyonce's album\nI'm sure is a much better Beyonce album\nout than Drake's album is but the idea\nthat one's better than the other it\nmakes no sense so who has a better diary\nentry it's like it's it's if we are\nactually making these personal things\nyou you can't\ncompare them or um compete in any way\nwith anyone else the only people who we\ncan honestly compete with is ourselves\nis like is this the best I can make\ntoday have I gone further than I've gone\nbefore\nthat's all we can do that's the only\ncompetition that makes sense is\ncontinuing to evolve and push ourselves\nartistically and not get complacent\nespecially in success it's easy to get\ncomplacent once something works it's\nlike I'll just keep doing more of that\nit ends up maybe one more time you can\nget away with it but once three are\nsimilar it stops being interesting yeah\nyeah that's so true and it comes that\ncomes back to that sameness point that\nwe always and I'm just addressing things\nthat I know all of you are thinking and\nfeeling right now like or I'm assuming\nyou are the idea of oh Jay there's\nalready you know when I started making\npodcasts I think there were like 700 000\npodcasts in the world and today there's\nlike two million plus maybe even more\nnow and that's in three years it's\ntripled since I started four years ago\nit's tripled and so when I started\neveryone's like Jay the 700 podcasts you\ndon't need another podcast too late\nexactly you're too late uh and then now\neveryone's like oh my God there's two\nmillion podcasts like this too late and\nwe do that we we start again using a\nmetric to say and you'll only feel that\nway if you're planning to repeat what's\nalready been done uh because if if\nyou're not planning to repeat it then\nyou're one of one you're not one of two\nmillion or one of seven hundred thousand\nit's one of one because you're only\nbringing your own Essence out right like\nyes just because every other podcast you\ncould be like there's so many interview\npodcasts there are so many interview\npodcasts that's true and they're all\ndifferent and they're all different\nexactly like you know and we we've got\nintroduced through\num your long-term friend and uh my new\nmutual friend Andrew huberman who's also\nbeen a guest on this podcast is a\nphenomenal podcast I love his podcast\num but so different to who I am so\ndifferent to what we do and and then\nthere's a million other friends that we\nhave that I've showed so the most common\nthing I hear\nwhen it comes to creativity or it comes\nto tapping into your Essences\ndistraction overthinking and\nprocrastination like those words come up\nfrom my community again and again and\nagain and that's the kind of community\nlistening I do like to do where I'm like\nwell what are people struggling with\nbecause we're trying to help what are\npeople's challenges I I have to know\nfrom them what they think it is and then\nI'll also share in the way I do\nhave you or anyone you've ever worked\nwith ever dealt with\nbig bout to procrastination yeah\nabsolutely and how do you define it\nbecause I almost think I would say\nthere's two the distraction and\nprocrastination are related and\ndifferent\nprocrastination is not a good one\ndistraction can be distraction can be\nhelpful you can use distraction if you\nhold a question to be solved\nand\ndon't sit and think and try to solve it\nbut go do something else and go you know\ntake a walk or go for a swim you'll find\nthat it changes it changes and the\ndistraction of when you go for a walk\nand seeing oh look at that tree over\nthere look at those birds or whoa that\ncard came kind of close to me all of\nthose things that that living in the\nworld\neven though it's not\num challenging in any real way\nit's a distraction that's using some\npart of your brain some part of your\nbrain is occupied with do I turn left or\ndo I turn right\noh look at that thing over there oh is\nit going to rain these other things are\nhappening that's different than just\nsitting in a room looking at your laptop\njust those\noutside\ncues can give you a way in to solve a\nproblem that you wouldn't solve if you\nwere sitting and working on it for\nexample if we were now doing this\npodcast together on a walk it would be a\nvery different podcast than us sitting\nhere staring into each other's eyes and\nit's a beautiful idea I've had there was\na period of time where um where I lost a\nwhole bunch of weight\nand one of the things that I did as part\nof that was I only did walking meetings\nbefore I used to only do lunch meetings\nso I switched the lunch meetings to\nwalking meetings\nand I would meet people in Santa Monica\nand we would walk and the meetings were\nso much better than the meetings either\nin a restaurant or at uh in an office\neverything shifted just because we were\nmoving we're doing something there were\nexternal stimuli even though the\nexternal stimuli had nothing to do with\nwhat we were doing yeah it it changed it\nwas a change in context that really did\num make the conversation much more\ninteresting and there's also something\nabout when you're walking you're not\nlooking at each other\nso it's easier to go into your own\nthoughts when you're not looking at\nsomeone so it was very interesting a\ngreat experiment lost a lot of weight\nand and the meetings were the best\nthey've ever been yeah yeah that makes a\nlot of sense there's a lot of work in\ncouples psychology that suggests that\nwhen couples argue they're usually\nsitting on opposite sides of a dining\ntable and when you're sitting with\nsomething in between you first of all I\nmean here we don't have anything but you\nhave something in between you it's\nalready creating a distance and now\nyou're working against each other yes\nrather than what you're saying is you're\nwalking with each other yes and you're\nlooking off into the same direction so\nyou're almost creating a future uh the\nidea that you're forward your your\nfuture forward your future facing it's\nfunny my wife and I whenever we get to a\nnew table and we're sitting to to eat\nwe always say we look at where the\nchairs are and one of us will say cheek\nto cheek and we tend to sit next to each\nother instead of across yeah\nI love that and that makes so much sense\nwith leadership meetings creative\nmeetings and and I I love that I love\nlove love and this is why this book is\nso beautiful because it has so many\nreally subtle points and the idea of the\ndifference between distraction and\nprocrastination yes and how distraction\ncan actually be healthy and especially\nas you said when you hold a question or\nyou you hold an idea and you're just\nkind of toying with it but you might\npick up a book you might go for a walk\nyou might whatever you can do all these\nthings but it's almost like you're using\nthat time wisely to to come back and\nabsolutely going for a drive is a great\none yeah and just just paying attention\nto\nnot crashing even though we can drive\nessentially on autopilot yeah we're not\nthinking about driving once we've been\ndriving for a while yeah but just\ndriving ideas come I know many musicians\nuh singers who who listen to the\ninstrumental music in a car in the car\nand then sing along when they're driving\nyeah because they're more free than when\nthey're sitting with a recorder yeah\nabsolutely absolutely that makes perfect\nsense yeah no and it's it's so\ninteresting how we have so many we've\nalso built up again going back to our\nconditioned beliefs we've built up a\nnegative relationship with the word\ndistraction we've built up a negative\nconnotation around if I don't solve it\nright now sitting in this one place then\nI'm never gonna figure it out yeah and\nthe idea that actually going on a walk\npicking up something else that's that's\none of the reasons why I like having in\nmy office here in the studio back in my\nhome everything's quite minimalist but I\nhave a lot of like little artifacts and\nlittle things and because I enjoy the\nkind of like stimulation and the\ncreative juices that start flowing if I\nget a moment to just observe and then\nsometimes I just want to observe nature\noutside where I can just sit and bask\nand almost bathe in nature which I find\nto be so useful because there was this\nincredible study from MIT a few years\nago where they tried to look for who\nwere their most creative Innovative\nemployees inside the organized inside\ncorporate organizations and MIT was\ndoing the study they found two sets of\ncharts of types of employees employee\nand employee B employee a knew lots of\npeople that knew each other an employee\nB knew lots of people that didn't know\neach other\nand they were looking at which one's\nmore creative Innovative and hence more\nimaginative inside a company and they\nfound it was Employee B Because employee\na knew people who knew people who knew\nthem back small circle closed Circle\nclosed circles that created these Echo\nChambers and you asked the same 10\npeople for advice and employee B knew\nlots of random people who had no\nconnection to each other and the point\nwas being made that if your circle and\nthat I think applies to environment as\nmuch as it applies to people absolutely\nis more random and disconnected you have\nmore chance of having a original\nauthentic tour idea spark as opposed to\nyou're surrounded by the four same\npeople and you talk about the same\nthings absolutely and and that to me has\nalways been how what I'm trying to do\nit's like I want to know what the monks\nthink and I want to know what Silicon\nValley thinks and I want to know what\nmusic Geniuses think because that's\nthere's something there absolutely a\nword you in this book that I want to\ntouch on and that's why this came up for\nme was submerge and I loved it when I\nsaw that word I was just like\nit's like I love that I I've thought\nabout that for so long submerging\nyourself\nwe've we've lost that ability to\nsubmerge we don't submerge ourselves\nmuch because we have so much of a little\nhow have you\nin this hyper-connected world working\nwith the most connected artists in the\nworld how are you encouraged\nyourself and others to continue to\nsubmerge when everyone's asking us to\nswim shallow I think so many of the\ngreat artists do it naturally can't you\ncan't help it it's the obsessive nature\nof being really into something that\num\nonce you start down a a thread you just\nkeep pulling forever if you're\ninterested many of the artists that that\nare great at what they do are great at\nwhat they do for that very reason they\nfall in love with this thing and then\nthey just want to know everything they\ncould possibly learn about it\num and there are no distractions I'm\nworking on a project now a documentary\nproject with Comedians and\none of the things that they talk about\nis their commitment like when other\npeople are doing things on the weekend\ngoing out with their friends they're\ngoing to perform every you know every\nnight that they can possibly go out and\nperform until they can get good at their\ncraft and this could be for a period of\nyou know 10 years of just having bad\nperformances you know having people not\nlike what you do\nlike banging your head against the wall\nbut that obsession with breaking through\nand when I say breaking through I don't\nmean breaking through to the audience I\nmean breaking through with themselves to\nwhere they get past\nall of the uh blocks\nand to be free in this moment in a way\nwhere they can\nreally Express their views and be heard\nand people can react\nit's a fascinating thing\nI just want to ask about being uh being\na monk tell me about your experience uh\nwhat would you like to know\num how did you choose to do this first I\nwas born and raised in London and when I\nwas around 18 years old I started going\nto events in the city where\nspeakers were invited to come and share\ntheir stories or Journeys or successes\nor whatever it may have been and this is\nobviously before podcasting and before\nYouTube and so you actually went to\nevents to hear people like yourself or\nanyone speaking so\nI would go and listen and they'd be\nfounders of companies they'd be athletes\nthey'd be you know musicians people like\nthat that would come to universities and\ncolleges in in London and so I'd go and\none of the nights I went I was invited\nto hear a monks Peak and I was 18 years\nold and my I didn't really have a\nperception of monks like I didn't really\nhave any I I'd seen saintly people and\nholy people coming from an Indian\nbackground but I never really knew what\nmonks were or what they did and so I\nsaid to my friends I didn't really want\nto go but I said I'd only go if we went\nto a bar afterwards that was my that was\nmy state of consciousness age 18 and my\nfriends were very persuasive and\nconvincing they said yeah yeah we'll go\nand so I went to this event kind of like\nnot expecting anything wanting to leave\nand I was just completely like flawed\nthis monk was from India he was born and\nraised in indeed a thick Indian accent\nhe was wearing uh saffron robes\nand\nthere was nothing externally that I\nshould or should have found it\nattractive about him as an 18 year old\nguy but his whole message and it's\nthat's why I smiled when you said it\nearlier like his whole message was that\nthe greatest thing you can do in the\nworld or greatness is to use your gifts\nin the service of God and use your gifts\nin the service of humanity as a\ndevotional act and he was talking about\nhow living in devotion and my 18 year\nold self was just completely like\nmesmerized by that idea I was just like\nI've never heard this like everyone's\nbeen telling us how to be successful and\nhow to start a business and how to\nlaunch a company and how to become\nnumber one or and it was like this this\nguy was just saying that that wasn't it\nand so I went up to him as you do after\nan event when you're Blown Away by a\nspeaker and I just said to him I was\nlike I just want to follow you around\nlike I just want to spend time with you\nand learn from you and sit at your you\nknow sit at your feet and just take\nobserve and and he said well I'm doing\nall these events in London this week you\ncan come so I would go along and then\nthat turned into my during college that\nturned into my summer and Christmas\nvacations being with him and then when I\ngraduated I turned down my corporate job\noffers and actually went and lived there\nfor three years fantastic and so it was\nlike all these little steps up to like\nthis very big decision and so that's why\nit was just one person who\nI've just always been fascinated by\npeople that you meet that can change the\ntrajectory of your life and the reason\nwhy I do this show is because I want to\nintroduce people to people and thoughts\nthat I think will change the trajectory\nof their life because I didn't\never want to be a monk I didn't think\nI'd become a monk I didn't crave to like\nit wasn't a path I saw for myself but it\nbecame the best thing that ever happened\nto me at that time and now I live in\ngratitude but I also realize I always\nask people who's your monk like who's\nthe person you need to meet that you\nhaven't met yet that could change your\nlife it's a example in the book of\npeople say you know I'm not a good\nartist or you're either living as an I\nsay you're either living as an artist or\nyou're not living as an artist there's\nnot you're not good at it or bad at it\nit's like being a monk you're either\nliving as a monk or you're not living as\nsomebody you can't be a bad monk if\nyou're living as a monk you're a monk\nyeah I love that yeah it's beautiful I\nmean you've you've had so much even\ntoday you know and that's why I was\nexcited to meet you in person because\nyou have such a spiritual journey in\nessence and just in spirit even in just\nyour presence and what you talk about\nthe vocabulary you have that where where\ndid that get infused with the work you\ndo like or is again has that always been\nthere or what was your journey I I\nlearned to meditate when I was 14 and\nthat's turned into a big part of my life\nI stopped meditating when I went to\ncollege and then when I moved to\nCalifornia I started again and when I\nstarted again I realized oh even though\nI hadn't done it for the last five years\na big part of who I am is because I did\nit when I did it had I not stopped I\nwouldn't have recognized that so the\nstopping and starting was a very clear\nwow this is this is a big part of how I\nsee the world already even with not\ndoing it for the last five years what\ntype of meditation is it\num okay got it got it yeah I learned TM\num changed my life but since then I've\nlearned vipassana and I do many\ndifferent many different practices and\nbreathing practices and Tai Chi and many\ndifferent meditative practices\num I often come back to TM maybe because\nit was first yeah yeah and it's\nbeautiful yes absolutely simple and\nbeautiful yeah absolutely and it's\ninteresting to me meditation just seems\nto be but there was definitely an a\ngeneration where meditation became\nreally prominent in the lives of so many\nespecially so many people today that you\nthat you meet that are doing you know\nRay Daly who's been on the podcast a\nmillion times and again he he talks\nabout TM as being such a big part of his\nfinancial success in terms of making\nwise Financial investment decisions and\nhe is a special human as well I feel\nlike that Resurgence is back now where\nwhere there's so much more talk about\nbreath work and meditation and if if you\nhad any\nwords of wisdom or insight for anyone\nwho's trying you experimenting what\nwould you suggest them as someone who's\ndone it for so long had breaks found\nusefulness in it we are there any things\nthat come to your heart or Forefront of\nyou the first thing that comes up\nthere's a beautiful book called wherever\nyou go there you are I love that book I\nhad meditated a long period of time\nbefore I read it but I remember reading\nit feeling like this is the best both\nintroduction to meditation and reminder\nof the power of meditation regardless of\nwhere you are in your meditative Journey\nso I would recommend that book as a as a\nway in and find the practice that works\nfor you and I I've also used like Yoga\nNidra or different guided meditations\nwhich also are beautiful and helpful\nyeah absolutely I used a lot of Yoga\nNidra when I had my hernia surgery I was\nlike I couldn't get a sleep because of\nthe pain and so yoga Nida is beautiful\nif you if you have trouble sleeping\neveryone you're gonna just like really\nspecial\num you strike me as someone who\nappreciates growth and inner work and\nself-work through through at least what\nwhat you've said today and shared today\nand the thoughts in the book and and I\nwas wondering what what do you feel as\nbeing the hardest thing that you've\nworked on internally or the most\nchallenging thing that you've worked on\ninternally you said you can only compete\nwith ourselves artistically but\ninternally what has been the greatest\nchallenge that you've worked on or are\nworking on now no I would say losing\nweight was the biggest challenge of my\nlife I weighed 318 pounds at one point\nand I was overweight my entire life\nand and I tried everything from the\nbeginning I went to Weight Watchers\nmeetings with my mom you know like my\nwhole life was dealing with weight\nissues\nand\nfinally just honestly getting the right\ninformation because I would do whatever\nwas recommended and nothing worked at\none point in time I had a performance\ncoach living at my house for two years\nwho watched everything I ate and got me\nto exercise and change changed my life\nfor the I got so much healthier with his\nhelp and he said in the last two years\nI've watched everything you've done 99\nout of 100 people would have shed 100\npounds and for some reason it just the\nweight just doesn't come off Zach he's\njust scratching his head I don't\nunderstand it must be you know\nmust be something else and then finally\nuh I saw a nutritionist at UCLA and and\nI had by this point I believe nothing\nwould change the situation my mom was\nobese my mom was in a wheelchair I just\nassumed that that was the way it was it\nwas a genetic thing I assumed\nand I went to see a guy at UCLA based on\na mentor friend of mine saying I really\nwant you to see this guy\nand um and I was sure it wouldn't work\nbecause I tried everything and nothing\nworked so um but I loved this person who\nrecommended me to go he was one of my\ngreat mentors recently passed away his\nname was Mo Austin great great man he\nworked for Frank Sinatra and oh wow\nsigned Jimi Hendrix and signed the sex\npistols and uh unbelievable person\nunbelievable human being\num and he he was the one who got me to\nsee this nutritionist at UCLA he said\njust go to see this guy go to see the\nguy that I send you to and do whatever\nhe said and and I did and um I lost like\n140 pounds 135 pounds in 14 months wow\nbut that was probably the most radical\njust because it was a lifelong issue and\nI believed it couldn't change eventually\nI believed it couldn't change because I\ntried everything\nand it was in some ways this is an\ninteresting the moral of the story is\nthrough giving up\nI turned myself over to this\nnutritionist I didn't do what I thought\nwas right I did what he thought was\nright and what he suggested sounded\ncrazy to me\nbut I did what he said what he thought\nwas right and it worked in the same like\nI was I've uh never exercised in my life\nand then I started hanging out with\nLaird Hamilton and these incredible\nathletes because when I lost a bunch of\nweight they invited me to start training\nwith them and I just wanted to be around\nthem because they're such interesting\npeople like I like being around people\nwho are good at what they're good at\nespecially when what they're good at is\ndifferent than what I'm good at it's\njust interesting yes the way they see\nthe world so I got to hang out with\nthese incredible athletes and um and\nthrough giving myself to them of doing\nwhat they said you know I first day I\nwent I couldn't do one push-up and then\nand I said I can't do it it's like don't\nsay you can't do it so you haven't done\nit yet and then they you know trained me\nwhere I could do a hundred consecutive\npush-ups like crazy things yeah yeah you\nreminded me of um Thomas Edison's\nstatement of uh when you feel you've\nexhausted all options remember this you\nhaven't and I I think it's so\ninteresting with health specifically\nit's it's\nfascinating that you chose that but I\nthink that's so true where you think\nyou're doing everything right and I've\nexperienced that with myself as well\nespecially with my with my gut and\ninflammation where I was like I was\ndoing everything right I'm really living\na healthy life and still having this and\nthen again passing myself over yeah to\nan amazing coach who's just told me\nexactly what I need to eat and what and\nall of a sudden you feel better and it's\nalmost like magic when it happens yes\nand but it's also fighting the right\ncoach because you could see 10 other\ncoaches and do what they say and it\ndoesn't work yeah it's we're so\ndifferent that's another thing the idea\nthat one size fits all yeah it's like\nthere is no one answer for anyone we\nhave to find our path you could have\nseen probably many different monks and\nnot have the experience you had it was\nthat monk spoke to you I remember the\nfirst time I saw ramdas speak I felt\nlike this is the first spiritual teacher\nthat really speaks to me the next one\nwas tick not Han when I saw Han speak\nI was so I felt so much peace in my body\nhearing him speak that I couldn't even\nhear what he was saying I I uh went into\na trance in his presence and this is\nwith 2 000 people you know in a room of\n2 000 people he stepped out on stage and\nI felt like I was gonna pass out yeah\nthat's how much PC carried so being\nseeing these things seeing these\nincredible teachers and these deep souls\nand getting inspired and learning from\nthem all is um that's the work yeah\nabsolutely and and you're right that\nfinding our mentors our guides our\nteachers is such a\nor people that inspire you is such a\nsuch a big part of life and I found\nstudying their stories and studying\ntheir their life it gives so much\ntexture to your own as well and\nyou know when when you look at\npassing these things on when you look at\npassing you know as you start this book\nby talking about how you're like these\naren't facts then my thoughts and\nhopefully they they help and support you\nwhen you think about giving this I can\nimagine a lot of young parents who are\nlistening thinking well how do I help my\nchild tap into their creativity how do I\nhave help even if it's not your child\nbut my friend my family member\nwhat uh what have you found helpful ways\nin being a proponent of ideas that you\nbelieve in have you found specific\nthings to be more authentic and useful\nand\nhence\ntranslate better well I think in general\npeople don't like to be told what to do\nso the best way that you could Inspire\nsomeone to do something is through the\nway that you carry yourself and if you\nif you act in a creative way in the\nworld\nand you do it to the best of your\nability and if someone else recognizes\nit it might Inspire them to do the same\nso I think it's hard to teach someone\nsomething that we don't practice we live\nto practice it yeah that's the hardest\npart yeah yeah but it's also the most\nfun it's like yeah yeah and it's our\npurpose it's the reason we're on this\nplanet is to do this work to do our work\nwhatever that is whatever our part is to\nplay our part in this giant Symphony\nwhen when you're trying to find your\npart that's the part I think that\nconfuses or\nconcerns so many people because so many\nparts today have become\nbarcodes or\nconveyor belts and there's so many of\nyou doing your part it may feel\nsometimes where it's like well I work in\na company where we all do the same thing\nlike what is my part I think there's\nsuch a\nwe've been talking about originality the\nwhole time but I think so many people\nfeel like what they do is so so much of\na commodity it's not original when\nsomeone's searching for that purpose as\nyou said your purpose is to Play Your\nPart which I think is beautiful and I\ncouldn't agree more a few years ago I\nreally came to the conclusion I realized\nthat what I do is not better than anyone\nor worse than anyone it's not early\nthan anyone or later than anyone it's\nnot\nfor anyone or not for anyone it's it is\njust what I meant to do it's just my\nrole and that's such a liberating place\nto live from absolutely but it's it's it\nalmost feels like today there's so much\npressure for people to pursue that or\nfind that yes that they either don't\nfind it or they get scared to look for\nit what have you found to be useful on\nthat well I want to say that given the\nexample you gave of the cookie cutter\nwork that's right\num maybe your purpose in life isn't\nrelated to your job\nmaybe your job is your job and the job\nis the thing that supports you\nand then the rest of your waking hours\nare devoted to your purpose whatever\nthat is yeah and a lot of us are trying\nto make it the same thing yeah and and\nit's beautiful when it happens but it\ndoesn't always happen and it's out of\nour control also yeah we can decide I\nwould say\nif you need to have a job to support\nyourself that's great that's a noble\nthing to do\nand follow your dreams but I'm not\nsaying they're one thing they don't have\nto be one thing and don't let following\nyour dreams undermine your ability to\nsupport yourself\nit could do it could actually do the\nopposite if you decide\nI want to be a comedian and I'm putting\nall my eggs in the comedian basket and\nI'm going to be a comedian the pressure\nof having a support support yourself\nwill change you as a comedian not for\nthe better you you want the stability of\nbeing able to take care of yourself in\nthe world to be free to do whatever your\npassion is whatever it is fishing you\nknow whatever it is yeah and and that's\nso true that I think the scarcity ruins\nthe art right it's the abundance of I\ndid my day job I'm now safe and secure I\ncan be autistic as opposed to sometimes\nand actually I'm going to debate my own\nstatement there because sometimes it\nalso feels like the pain is the pain of\ntrying to do something is is what\ncreates good art as well but yeah I mean\nI'm but but it could be there's pain in\nit anyway there's pain anyway there's\npain in you know getting up in front of\npeople and them not laughing is painful\nif that means you also can eat I don't\nknow if that makes it less more or less\npainful yeah yeah definitely it's almost\nlike giving ourselves permission to make\nart like I feel like there's a moment\nwhere you go now I'm worthy almost but\nwhat you're saying is you are always\nworthy because it's who you are yes\nyou're always Worthy is who you are yeah\nwhy do you think we don't feel worthy of\nanything not just make it up but so many\nof us I think feel a sense of like we're\nnot worthy to do what we love we're not\nworthy to share our purpose or our\npassion there's a sense of we don't want\nto give us I think there's a mythology\nthat the people who make things that we\nlove are special people\nand that we think that they're you know\nthe people on Mount Olympus and they're\nthese magic people who are geniuses and\nthen there's the rest of us and that's\nnot the case it's like we're all just\npeople we're all doing our best we all\nare good at some things not good at\nother things we're humans and sometimes\nwe find a way to make something\nbeautiful but that's it so do you know\nwhat I mean there's no there are no\nspecial people really we're all special\nyeah yeah yeah and I I everyone please\nlisten to that again and again and again\nbecause it's that's the mess of like\nthat person's gifted they're special\nThey did something unique and I promise\nyou if you knew them 20 years ago you\nwouldn't think that no but you just met\nthem at this precipice of their life\nthey don't think so they don't think\nthat yeah or if they do think so their\nart will suffer yeah the ones who\nbelieve the hype yeah yeah how did you\nrespond what was your first\ntime you felt and even if maybe you\ndidn't even allow yourself to feel it\nbut what was the first time you\nexperienced success\nand how did you respond to it because I\nhear so many people say I just wanted to\nrepeat it right and that again getting\ncoined that same when was the first time\nyou experienced maybe even felt\nsuccessful and how did you respond to it\nmy first memory of outward success came\nwhen\num the first Beastie Boys album Licensed\nto Ill was the number one album in the\ncountry and I got a call from a person\nwho I worked with saying\nyou have the number one album I only\nknow this because I remember the phone\ncall had the call not happen I wouldn't\nI would have no idea how I felt and and\nthe call came how do you feel you have\nthe number one album in the country and\nI remember saying I've never been more\nunhappy in my life\nand uh and I think\nwe\nmistakenly think\nsome kind of outward success is gonna\nchange something in us and it does not\nit may make life more comfortable but it\ndoesn't change Who We Are and any uh\nhole in ourselves that we're hoping to\nfill does not get filled and if\nyou spend let's say you spend 20 years\nof your life working towards a goal\nthat's going to solve everything\nand then you finally achieve what you've\nbeen trying to do for 20 years toiling\naway I I won't have any fun in because\nI'm working for 20 years for this end\nand then you get that end and nothing\nchanges\nthat's when you get hopeless\nso it's not uncommon to see very\nsuccessful artists who were very unhappy\nin life because they're working towards\nthis the thing that's going to make them\nfeel better\nand it does not make them feel better\nI'm sure you've got to meet many very\nsuccessful business people billionaire\npeople\nvery few of them are happy very few\nand they've reached their they've\naccomplished their dreams and are\nunhappy because we don't know what we\nwant\nyou know we don't know what's going to\nmake us happy we're trying to fill\nsomething that maybe can't be filled\nthrough\nmaterial or uh cultural success public\nsuccess it's something else it's some\ninternal thing what was it that at that\ntime that put you I don't know I don't\nknow I think it was more I think it was\nmore just the reality of\nwell that doesn't matter at all and it's\nalways been I'll say I like when people\nlike the things I make of course and it\nchanges nothing yeah it changes nothing\nyeah yeah I I found that there were only\na few things through my monk experience\nthat helped me realize what what made a\ndifference one was something we're\nexperiencing today which I really feel\nfrom you in Homer who's always been his\nhe's filmed every episode pretty much\nwe've done for the past continents how\nlong now but that there was a Stillness\nand a quiet and a presence and so the\nfirst thing was presence the the idea\nthat\npresence is a big part of joy and\nhappiness and just being able to\nactually be here right now in the way\nyou said you're one of your favorite\nbooks was\num\nwhere you go there you are wherever you\ngo there wherever you go there yeah yeah\nwherever you go there you are\num presence the other one is learning\nand growth the idea that we're growing\nwe're evolving we're learning there is\nsome\nsome kind of stimulation of\nEvolution we all need to evolve the\nthird one was achievement there was a\nsense of achievement but I think today's\nsense of achievement has become about an\nexternal metric as opposed to do we even\nthink that's worthy of achieving or\npursuing and then the fourth which to me\nit sometimes is the most important is\nthe service element the the act the\noffering that we were working always in\ndevotion and those were like four really\nsimple things that I think have always a\nformed part of the the mocktail of joy\nhappiness success when you you said\nsomething really beautiful there you\nsaid the first time you fell outward\nsuccess when was the first time you\nexperienced inward success or or felt\nthat or is that something that's\nconstantly important no that's something\nprobably making something as it would\nhave been one of the very first records\nI ever made the experience in the studio\nof hearing something that I haven't\nheard before getting excited by it and\nthen maybe going out and hearing it in\nthe club you know like even getting the\nclub to play it just so I could hear it\nin the club that experience of like wow\nthere it is or the first time you hear\nsomething that you make on the radio\nit's very exciting not because of what\nit means but just I spent my whole life\nlistening to music on the radio and now\nthere's something I made on the radio I\nstill have this experience\non a semi-regular basis just out in the\nworld I'll be somewhere and\nin a coffee shop and a song come on that\nI produced and the feeling is like wow\ncan you believe it's just out there like\nthat I remember I remember I I could\nchoke myself up I can remember being in\nthe room what we were doing like and now\nit's playing here how crazy is the world\nI went to WrestleMania yesterday and a\nsong I produced was played at\nWrestleMania I wasn't expecting it I\nwasn't expecting it I was like Wow\nWrestleMania it's crazy yeah and you\nstill feel that today that's what says\nit's just so wild yeah you can't believe\nit yeah it's crazy it's magic that I I\nlove I love that seeing like how long\nhave you done this now like how long\nhave you done what you did 35 years yeah\nlike there was I I got to go to uh I've\nbeen a Manchester United Support my\nwhole life and I got to go again\nrecently I have a really wonderful\nrelationship with the club and\nI I went to watch a game recently when I\nwas back in England and it was the first\ntime I got to meet uh legendary manager\nSir Alex Ferguson and he's he's the most\ndecorated manager in premier league\nhistory and United's longest standing\nmanager and you know worked with the\ngreats and I got to meet him for the\nfirst time and we were just hanging out\nand talking and having lunch before the\nbefore the game and what I loved what\nyou were saying about you love watching\npeople with greatness what I loved about\nhim was\nhe was talking about football like a\nsoccer for those who do but he was\ntalking about football like a fan yeah\nstill yes like I was like I was like Sir\nAlex you gave me the best memories of my\nchildhood I was naming all these games\nthat they'd won and I I knew he knew\nthat it's like me telling you my\nfavorite songs you've worked on I know\nyou know them but I had to tell him for\nmy sake and he was like living each game\nwith me this is the first and I was like\nhow are you still you know how is it\nthat it's still so fresh and I guess\nsame question to you like how is it\nstill so fresh that at WrestleMania a\nsong surprises you and you still get\nthat child like like because it doesn't\nmake sense none of it makes sense I\nremember the ordinary situation that it\ncame out of I remember the studio in um\nit was the one of the first times I ever\ncame to California I remember it's not a\nstudio now it's a flower shop where the\nstudio used to be uh off of La Cienega\nBoulevard it was this tiny little studio\nand I remember being in this tiny little\nroom and one of the first times in\nCalifornia and what a fun experience it\nwas making the record and how cool it\nwas and that now however many years\nlater 25 years later\nseeing a stadium of 80 000 people and\nthe song comes on unexpectedly it's just\nbizarre it's bizarre because I know the\nmodest beginnings of all of these and\nit's just regular people like you and me\nshowing up somewhere and making\nsomething that we think is cool it's\nunbelievable that it has some life that\ngoes on yeah it's crazy but I love that\nbecause\nwhat I'm hearing you say that it's like\nyou took notes like there were mental\nnotes of like that moment we went in\nthat like there's a gratitude and\nthere's a perspective of\nit wasn't just as you've just laid out\nit wasn't just about having a record on\nthe radio\nit was all those minute small moments of\nDiscovery and of intrigue and curiosity\nwhich which you made a note of\nsomewhere in your subconscious that you\nthen recall and live through when you\nhear that song in that moment you're not\nliving there just listening to a song at\nWrestleMania or on the radio or number\none it's like you're living through all\nthose miniature moments that that\ncreated it yeah and I never listen back\nto music that I work on so when I do\nhear it out in the wild it's it's funny\nit's like wow look it's still there\ncrazy is there a reason you don't listen\nto it is that because I'm always making\nsomething new I've had no reason to go\nback yeah you never even feel a sense of\nnostalgia like uh no unless unless I'm\nworking with an artist and there's an\nexample that comes up where I think oh\nwe did something like this a long time\nago this might listen to this and see if\nthis gives you any inspiration yeah so\nmore more as a tool but I would do the\nsame for something I didn't make you\nknow be let's listen to this Stevie\nWonder song because we maybe we'll learn\nsomething same yeah yeah that makes\nsense there's there's a beautiful\nchapter in this book that I want to talk\nabout which is all about memories and\nsubconscious\num and I felt that you talk about this\nidea of larger intelligence\nand and tapping into and even making\nalmost journaling about dreams which I\nfound was something that I'm definitely\ngoing to practically take on so I've\nnever journaled about dreams I know I\ndream and there's times when I forget\nand there's times when I remember and\nsometimes I'll tell someone sometimes I\nwon't and I I when I read you say that\nyou actually wrote about dreams and\njournaled about dreams I was like I'm\ngoing to start doing that now so that's\nsomething you've directly impacted me to\ndo as a practical thing because I feel\nlike I've had fascinating dreams in the\npast I've forgotten it's it's too messy\nand they go and they dissipate very\nquickly so quickly very quickly so\nquickly and that's when I was reading\nthat I was like okay I need to hold on\nto these so some of the tricks I I yes\ntalked to some degree in the book but\nnot so I just touch on it in the book\nthere's so much to talk about\num but when you wake up you don't move\nat all because the the way the Dream\nworks it's a chemical reaction in your\nbrain so it's also good to know if you\nwake up from a scary dream and you don't\nwant to think of about it if you just\nshake your head around it'll be gone so\nyou keep pen and paper right next to\nyour bed and the minute you wake up\nyou grab the pen and paper moving as\nlittle as possible and just start\nwriting and even if you only remember I\nremember there's a part in the dream\nwhere this happens write the part you\nremember and you'll see through the\nprocess of writing more of the dream\nwill appear\nit's you don't even when you wake up you\ndon't you won't remember as much of it\nas you know but once you start writing\nyou can start tapping into more Oh and\nbefore that this happened and then this\nhappened after that and you'll start\nnoticing more details and the more you\npractice it the better you get at it\nso I did that for a period of time and\nat the time the dreams made no sense\nthey were just these abstract you know\nSalvador Dolly paintings and yeah and\njust went on abstract I have no idea\nstrange strange dreams no idea what they\nare and then years later I found that\njournal and and I read it and\nwhen they were happening I thought every\ndream every night was completely\ndifferent and none of them more about\nanything I understood and years later\nwhen I look back at it\nall the dreams were about the same thing\nand they all were it was so clear what\nmy subconscious was telling me uh I\ndon't remember what it was because it's\nprobably 20 20 some odd years ago but I\nremember being shocked by oh this didn't\nmake I was too close to it to understand\nit I was too close and with a little bit\nof distance you can see what it is yeah\nyeah and it's also interesting to see\nhow your subconscious Works how it\nhow your subconscious\nabstracts reality to show it to us in a\nway that's intriguing\nand interesting but not obvious\nit's very beautiful the reason why I\nlove that so much is I even had to\nretract\nthe\nimmediate question that came into my\nmind and I retracted it because and I'll\ntell everyone what it is but I retracted\nit because\nI just love the act of observing and\nbeing present with your dream is as\nyou're showing us how to do and the\nmodern day question is well what's the\nbenefit of that like why would you do\nthat and and when I was asking in my\nhead I was like if I just listen to you\nand I'm listening to you and I'm\nremember reading what I read and I'm\nthinking\nthe benefit is just the act of observing\nand just being there and and being and\nthen like you said being able to then\nlook back\npotentially the potential in the future\nMaybe not maybe it is to see if there\nare connections and the subconscious\nyou're so right is is speaking to us in\nalmost such a compassionate Artful way\nyes without telling you on the nose but\nit's an important Point don't do things\njust because you think you're gonna get\nsomething for it that's not why we do\nthings do what's interesting to you\nfollow what's interesting don't worry\nabout the outcome yeah we don't know we\ncan't predict the outcome we can never\npredict the outcome follow your own\ninner guide it directs us it might not\nmake sense it might not make sense to us\nmight not make sense to anyone else\ncertainly won't make sense to anyone\nelse but it might not even make sense to\nus and that's okay it's it's fine yeah\nlisten to yourself why is it telling you\nthis why is it telling you this I told I\nmentioned my heart surgery earlier my\nson was born\n18 months before the heart surgery I\ndidn't know about the heart issue I knew\nabout the heart issue and that it was\nsomething I was born with but I didn't\nknow that it was anything I would need\nto deal with Wow and a friend of mine\nsaid when my son was born\nyou're going to have a whole lot of\nenergy\nand your son is gonna want his mom\nso you're going to have all this energy\nand nothing to do with it so pick\nsomething interesting to you or that you\nwant to do or something you want to\naccomplish because you're going to have\nall this extra energy with nowhere to\nput it because you're going to want it\nto go to your son but he's not going to\nwant that he's he's going to be taken so\nI decided I want to learn uh deadlifts\nheavy deadlifts I I the only exercise\nexperience I had was with Leonard\nHamilton and we didn't do any any formal\nexercises like that we did a lot of\nweight training but it was more balance\nand coordination oriented and super fun\nreally interesting and challenging as\nchallenging mentally as it was\nphysically usually you'd cognitively not\nbe able to do it before you physically\ncouldn't do it which was fascinating to\nme too it was never like sitting on a\ntreadmill looking at the TV it was\nalways if you were not paying\nfull attention to everything you were\ndoing you'd probably get hurt yeah so\nreally you're focused and I like\nfocusing on things so it was fun\num so then I thought okay learning like\nproper form Olympic deadlifting I'm\ndoing the Olympic dead lifting and\nas the weights got heavier I realized I\nwas I had this anxiety before a lift\nthat didn't make sense to me\nand even to the point where I talked to\nthe trainer and I said\nsomething doesn't make sense I'm gonna\npick up this weight and one of two\nthings is gonna happen the weight will\ngo off the ground\nor the weight will not go off the ground\nif the weight doesn't go off the ground\nwe'll take off five pounds and then I'll\ntry it again what if it goes off the\nground or doesn't go off the ground I\ndon't care\nI don't care at all\nwhy would I have anxiety if I don't care\num\nturns out the wisdom of the body knowing\nthat when I finally found out what was\ngoing on in my heart and I talked to the\nheart surgeon and yes what kind of\nexercise I do and I said oh I'm doing\nthis you know heavy Olympic dead lifting\nhe just he put his hand his head in his\nhands\nand he said every time you lifted the\nweight you're playing Russian roulette\nevery time wow he's like there was no\nworse thing you could have done with\nwhat was going on in your heart so and\nagain I didn't know that but something\nin my body had all this anxiety around\nsomething that I didn't care about at\nall yeah so there there are levels of\nwisdom that we don't know\nwe don't understand\nso when you have an intuition to take\nthe stairs instead of the elevator or\nI always go home this way but today for\nsome reason I feel like going this other\nway yeah or maybe I'm going to cross\nstreet and walk on that side of the\nstreet whatever it is whatever little\nintuitions in your body that come listen\nto them see what happens be open to\nthere's more going on than we know\nthere's a lot more than our conscious\nmind can\ncan pick up going on yeah we often do so\nmany things because we think they're\nright we think they're healthy they're\nthe thing you're meant to do and it but\nit doesn't sit with you somewhere yeah\nand and I think so many people have\nI know for a fact that I feel like I\nstarted following my intuition when I\nwas probably around 14.\nand so that voice is very loud but I\nknow a lot of people that I've worked\nwith and coached and also worked with in\nin my life that started stop listening\nto their inner voice at 14. yeah and so\nit's very quiet now and so it becomes\nharder to really hear it yes because\nwe've suppressed it for so long and then\nthe the ego or the outside noise is so\nloud that we're Guided by that we're not\nmisguided by that\nit's hard to tap into it again have you\nfound anything that helps you tap into\nit when you feel like you're losing it\nor have you met someone and you've\nworked with and you've said hey just try\nthis to tap into it again and the\nexamples you just gave right now kind of\nfeel real too where it can be something\nas simple as take that route do that\nbecause I find like people lose touch\nwith it absolutely I would say when\nwhen you're getting advice of any kind\nexpert advice from whoever it is\nno maybe that's maybe that applies to me\nmaybe that maybe it doesn't\nbut it's okay it's okay no there's no um\nbad intention on the wisdom that's being\nshared with us people are offering their\nbest information yeah but they're the\ninformation that they're offering is\nbased on their experience so no even\nwhen it's someone you really respect\nwhen they're suggesting something maybe\nthat would work maybe I'll try it maybe\nnot\nbut listen to what's going on in inside\nyourself and I would say getting to\nwherever it is that you've gotten we've\nusually gotten there through listening\nto something going on inside of\nourselves I I have many successful\nmusician friends\nwho have gotten there through listening\nto what's going on inside themselves and\nthen in success think it's time to start\ntaking direction from the outside world\nmakes no sense it's hard you eat yeah\nlike you either do it at the beginning\nor you do at the end and it's almost\nlike that they're the same as in the\nsense of what you were saying earlier\nthe idea of\nthere's this beginner's mindset where\nyou're always open to\nhear people's thoughts so you don't know\nthere's that idea of I don't know we\nhave to feel yes and see but that's\ndifferent to I don't know that for\nsomeone else must know or I've known up\ntill now and now no one knows I don't\nknow and nobody knows no one knows and\nand everyone's intentions are good\nthey're not out to get us yeah but\nnobody knows they think they know\nthe the wisest thing we can do is know\nenough to know we don't know yeah if you\nstart from\nmaybe maybe that's true\nit could work who knows yeah not hold\nanything so firm is this is the way it\nis I know how it is\nanytime you know how it is your world\njust got a lot smaller yeah tiny yeah\nthere's yeah it's this this idea is\ncrystallizing for me as we're talking\nthis idea that you could be thinking you\ncan be doing you can be feeling or you\ncan be knowing and a lot of us try and\nplay so much emphasis on knowing but no\none actually knows and so it's better to\neither change our thoughts change our\nBehavior or focus on our feelings and\nsense as you've been saying all along\nit's like you've got to feel how it yeah\nand a mad thing will always be right no\nno no no no no no there is no well there\nis no yeah and there isn't even there\nisn't even on all right yeah pay\nattention to what's going on inside\nyourself there's so much information\ngoing on inside of ourselves intuitive\ninformation Rick this has been such a uh\nbeautiful and fascinating conversation\nfor so many reasons we we end
