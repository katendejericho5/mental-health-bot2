    "transcript": "most people lose their free will to\nthose programs and it's that\nuncompromising will where you keep\ntraining the animal to stay to get\nbeyond all the Cravings the feelings the\nhabits of the body and catch yourself\nthe best-selling author and host the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast\non purpose with Jay Shetty\nI think the most beautiful and powerful\nthing in the world is a repetitive\nthought\nbut sometimes the most dangerous thing\nin the world is a repetitive thought\nabsolutely and we think about the most\nbeautiful things we create is because\nwe're obsessed with this new idea and\nthis new thought that we want to build\nsomething but at the same time we know\ncountless people who they have a thought\nevery day that says I'm unlovable I'm\nunworthy I don't deserve love in my life\nif someone's having a negative\nrepetitive thought specifically around\nself-worth what they believe they\ndeserve in love where do they start with\nthat thought well we think primarily uh\n90 of the time we think the same\nthoughts as we thought the day before\nthe challenge with that is the thought\nthat you keep thinking over and over\nagain becomes a belief and nerve cells\nthat fire together wire together so the\nmore nerve cells fire the more they\ndevelop long-term relationships and the\nmore hardwired they become the more\nhardwired they become the more automatic\nthey are the more automatic they are the\nmore unconscious they become\nso the process of change really requires\nbecoming conscious of your unconscious\nthoughts which means just because you\nhave that thought doesn't necessarily\nmean it's the truth\nif you have that thought and you accept\nit you believe it you surrender to it\nwithout analyzing it that thought will\nlead to the same Choice which will lead\nto the same behavior which will create\nthe same experience which then will\nproduce the same emotion same emotions\nthen drive our very same thoughts\nin time our biology our circuitry our\nchemistry our hormones and even our gene\nexpression stays the same because we're\nthe same\nso in the process of change when you\ncome up against that unconscious belief\nand you make it conscious most people\nget uncomfortable uh when they confront\nthat thought and they're stopping an\nautomatic process and the body which has\nbeen conditioned to be the mind because\nit's doing something over and over again\nthat's a habit\nis craving the experience because it\nwants the emotion associated with it\nright so the thought of being unworthy\nproduces the feeling of being unworthy\nthat feeling that when the person feels\nunworthy tends to cause the person to\nthink more unworthy thoughts it only\ntakes a thought and a Feeling\nan image of yourself and an emotion a\nstimulus in response\nyou can condition the body to memorize\nthat behavior and that emotional state\nbetter than the conscious mind so the\nmoment we inhibit that thought or the\nmoment become conscious of and we no\nlonger accept it there's a biological\ncraving that takes place in the body\nbecause the body has been conditioned to\nbe the mind so the body starts\ninfluencing the mind to think more\ncorresponding thoughts equal to that\nfeeling so here comes the assault then\nyou're not only unworthy you're you're\neverything else that goes along with\nthat feeling\nand this is where uh people have to make\nup their mind if they truly want to\nchange because if you decide to confront\nthat thought and make a different Choice\nget ready because you're going to feel\nuncomfortable it's going to feel\nunfamiliar and it's going there's going\nto be some uncertainty because you're\nstepping out of familiar territory\nnow you're stepping out of the known and\nyou're stepping into the unknown now\nthis is really when you leave the\nbleachers and you get on the playing\nfield because\nthe brain immediately looks around in\nits environment to see if anything's\nchanging because you're changing and you\nsee that nothing in your world is\nchanging because you actually haven't\nfully changed yet so the moment we look\nfor evidence in our life and we don't\nsee it\nsooner or later most people accept that\nthought which leads to the same Choice\nwhich creates the same behavior which\ncreates the same experience that\nproduces the same feeling then they say\noh this feels right to me you know that\nfeels familiar because you've just\nreturned back to the known self\nI think that when people truly want to\nmake up their mind to change and they\nbecome so conscious\nof those unconscious thoughts they would\nnever go unconscious to them again\nthat's the moment the body is being\nreconditioned to a new mind\nif you inhibit that choice that leads to\nthat habit or that behavior\na habit is when you've done something so\nmany times the body knows how to do it\nbetter than the brain now you're\nstopping the body from being on its\nautomation on autopilot\nand if the body's craving the feeling of\nunworthiness and you're stopping the\nbody from feeling that way and you're\naware\nin your life how you speak\nyou're aware in your life how you're\nfeeling and you're checking in you're\nsaying do I really want to feel this way\nthis is that River of change where\nyou're going from the old self to the\nnew cell so it makes sense then if those\nprinciples and biology work in that way\nthey could actually work in our favor so\nif you said okay I'm going to sit down\nfor a few minutes I'm going to come so\nconscious of my unconscious self my\nunconscious personality that Victory\ntoday\nwould not be going unconscious to those\nthoughts behaviors and emotions okay let\nme get so familiar with them that I\ndon't go unconscious okay I got that\ndown\nI know what what thoughts do I want to\nfire and wire in my brain and if a\nbelief is a thought that you keep\nthinking over and over again with\nintention\nand with attention you'll switch on that\nprefrontal cortex and assign meaning to\nthe ACT and start installing new\ncircuits in your brain\nif you keep doing it over and over again\nit becomes more hardwired it becomes\nmore automatic and now you're installing\na new belief that you are worthy of love\nyou are worthy of abundance you are\nworthy to heal whatever that is that's\nthe thought you do want to believe in\nand when it matters the most is when\nit's the hardest because if you don't\nhave the circuitry in place you'll\ndefault back to the old programs right\nso then if you said how am I going to be\nin my zoom calls today how am I going to\nbe in traffic today how am I going to be\nwith my ex my co-workers\nand you started thinking about and\nrehearsing\nhow you were going to act in certain\nsituations\nthe brain actually doesn't know the\ndifference between the real life\nexperience and what you're Imagining the\nresearch on mental rehearsal shows that\nthe brain will look like in time that\nit's already had the experience and it's\nvacant of the experience now keep firing\nand wiring those circuits and you're\ngoing to begin to behave that way so now\nyou're installing circuitry now to use\nin your life to get your behaviors to\nmatch your intentions if you said how\nwould it feel to feel worthy of love how\nwould it feel to be grateful for Life\nhow would it feel to be worthy of\nabundance\nand you said I'm going to teach my body\nemotionally\nwhat this feels like before the\nmanifestation of the event you're not\nwaiting for your life to change to feel\nworthy you're actually changing your\nlife by becoming worthy you're\ngenerating abundance you're generating\nlove you're creating an elevated emotion\nnow our data is so compelling because\nwhen you truly begin to elevate your\nemotional state and you could really\nlock in you know to those elevated\nemotions\nyour body is so objective\nthat it actually believes that it's\nliving in a whole new environment\nbefore the environment changes in other\nwords the body's believing it's in that\nnew future\nand if the environment signals the Gene\nand it does\nand the end product of an experience in\nthe environment is an emotion\nyou're actually signaling genes ahead of\nthe environment and your body will begin\nto become conditioned to a new mind now\nthink about this\nif you did that every day the word\nmeditation literally means become\nfamiliar with you become familiar with\nyour old self you become familiar with\nyour new self and you say I'm not\ngetting up until I feel this feeling\nand then you'd say I want to be able to\nbring this feeling up whenever I want\nI'm going to keep remembering this\nfeeling over and over again it only\ntakes a thought and a Feeling\nan image of the future under motion is\nstimulus in response you can condition\nyour body\nto believe it's living in a whole new\nlife and when you feel the emotions of\nyour future something amazing happens\nyou're no longer in lack or separation\nso you're no longer looking for the\nevent to take away that feeling of lack\nor separation your body's actually\nbelieving it's in the event and so then\nyou're not looking for it you feel like\nit's already happened get ready because\nthat's when your life begins to change\nand so we've discovered that if you're\nactually practicing this and you immerse\nyourself in that experience fully for\nseven days\nthe amount of metabolic and biological\nchanges that will take place in your\nbody\nwill be so significant that your body\nwill actually believe it's living in\nthat future and yet most of the people\nthat come to our workshops are literally\nin a ballroom there's nothing really\nexciting happening in the environment\nbut their bodies believing they're\nliving in a whole new life\nand so one thought leads to a choice\nwhich leads to behavior which creates an\nexperience that produces an emotion so\nthen new information new knowledge\nbegins to cause you to think differently\nif you can remember that knowledge and\nbegin to make a different choice because\nyou want to experience the truth of that\ninformation\nyou'll have to behave differently and\nwhen the experience occurs and you feel\nthe feeling of your abundance or wealth\nI guarantee you you're going to continue\nwanting to make the process of change\nsomething consistent in your life this\nis why I love talking to you I mean that\nliterally you could just well you just\nsaid there I hope everyone listens to it\nagain and again and again and partly I\nthink there's something to be said for\nthat the best things that have rewired\nmy brain and my mind were things that I\nrepeated daily I took something that I\nlove listening to or loved learning or\nreading a paragraph of a book and I\nwould literally just reprogram Myself by\ngiving that to my mind every single day\nyeah and as I'm listening to you talk I\nI think there's a few really powerful\nthings I wanted to pull out\nuh when I lived as a monk and studied\nThe Vedas they would talk about thoughts\nin different modes and there are three\nmodes the mode of ignorance the mode of\npassion and the mode of goodness and\nthere's a hierarchy to those thoughts\nand so the mode of ignorance would be an\nunfulfilling thought or a completely\nferal and Security based thought which\nwould be I am not worthy or I am unlucky\nand I can't do that I can't be in love\nno one can be in love with me that's\nlike a mode of ignorance thought about a\npassion thought would be I can be in\nlove with anyone I want and I can find\nanything and uh it's it's almost like\nyou know you're lying to yourself and\nyou haven't really\nyou haven't really applied what you're\nsaying and it's just this big bold\nstatement but it doesn't quite sit and\nresonate\nand the more goodness though is I can\ntake steps daily\nto create love in my life right now\nand and you start to see how people\nwould often look at what we're saying\nand they think oh it's just positive\nthinking it isn't it's not it's not just\na false statement what you're saying is\nwhat you two words you used intention\nand attention you're actually being\nconscious about where that intention and\nthe attention is being placed you're\nintending that if I do something every\nday and I place my attention on XYZ then\nI can create this new reality for myself\nwhenever I have a tough conversation\ncoming up a tough meeting something\ndifficult I'll rehearse it in my head\nand you're so right that you can prepare\nfor the future even when I do skydiving\nor if I'm sitting in a cold plunge I'm\npreparing my mind before I even do it\nthere's no point of just jumping in and\ndiving in\nI think what's really interesting is\nthat partly a lot of the anxiety and\nstress we feel is because we kind of\nhope that we'll never feel anxiety and\nstress again\nso there's a sense of like okay I can\nget to a place where I never experience\nanxiety I I almost think that that sets\nus up to be more hurt by the anxiety and\ninevitable uncertainty will feel I would\nlove to hear your thoughts gosh without\nme I'd love to respond I got three\nthoughts going on at the same time do it\nso so to fulfill the first part of that\nquestion it's an experiment\nright it's an experiment life is an\nexperiment\nso if your personality creates your\npersonal reality\nand your personality is made up of how\nyou think how you act and how you feel\nif you keep thinking the same way you\nkeep acting the same way you keep\nfeeling the same way your life is going\nto stay the same because you're the same\nso the experiment is okay let me begin\nto think differently so I got to remind\nmyself how I do want to think and I have\nto remind myself of how I no longer want\nto think so I don't default and go\nunconscious let me remind myself how I'm\ngoing to behave so that I could actually\nget my behaviors to match my intentions\nand let me remind myself of how I'm\ngoing to feel if I'm able to succeed in\nthat day then there should be some\nchange in my life this experiment the\nthe and and if it doesn't change that\ndoesn't mean the law doesn't work for\nyou it's just you're not that good yet\nit's just you just got to keep\npracticing right so the act of\ndisconnecting from your life long enough\nto remind yourself of who you do want to\nbe and who you no longer want to be that\nexperiment then is the experiment called\nlife now\nit's not that you react\nthe question is how long are you going\nto react that's the real question\nbecause I mean I react all the time\neverybody does but if you're going to\nstay there and you're going to live in\nthat emotional state you will see life\nthrough that lens of that emotion right\nso now it gets complicated because the\nstronger the emotion you feel towards\ncertain people or problems in your life\nthe more you pay attention to them and\nwhere you place your attention is where\nyou place your energy so from a purely\nbiological as well as Quantum State we\ncould say then\nyou're using that person\nor that circumstance to reaffirm your\ndependence on feeling that emotion so\nyou have to hate your enemy and if your\nenemy dies you'll find another person to\nhate because that is that is the\nresponse right so the body is is the\nanimal it's been conditioned a certain\nway and it's and if it's been doing\nsomething and feeling something for an\nextended period of time there's a\nmodification of its receptor sites it's\nit's needing those emotional states\nso in the process of change\njust be ready because you're going to\nfeel uncomfortable a lot of the time now\nthe question is\ndo you want to stay there so then most\npeople think that they don't have any\ncontrol over their emotional state they\nthink I'm just this way and I feel this\nway well we we actually can show people\nthat that's not the truth that\nwhen it's the hardest it matters the\nmost and if you're able to really work\nand train your body like you're training\nan animal\nto stop feeling one way and start\nfeeling another way if you believe that\nyou're an eternal being let's just say\nthat I mean just most religions talk\nabout we're Eternal and most sex of\nthought only a few that don't whether\nyou're going to heaven or hell or\nNirvana or on the wheel you're pretty\nmuch going to be around for a long time\nthat that moment matters so much in the\nlight of Eternity because that's the\nmoment you make up your mind to no\nlonger be defined by your past why are\nyou being defined by your past because\nemotions are a record of the past and so\nthen if you're feeling that emotion your\nbody is believing it's back in that same\nexperience of the past so the more\nknowledge that we have and understanding\nthat justified\nvalid or not those emotions are hurting\nno other person but you because the\nlong-term effects of living by those\nemotional states those survival states\nare actually down regulating genes and\ncreating diseases sooner or later you're\ngoing to have to ask yourself is this\nloving to myself\nand forgiveness is just when you\novercome the emotion you take your\nattention off that person or that\nproblem you're you're freeing yourself\nand you're freeing them\nso people do the best with what they\nthink is available that's my belief and\nif you're unaware that you can control\nyour emotional states you'll rely on\nsomething outside of you to do that\nwhether it's a computer game whether\nit's a Netflix show or whether it's a\ndrug whatever whatever it is that you\nneed to make that feeling Go away You're\ndependent on your outer world and I\nthink that's a hypnosis that's a\nconditioning teach people that you can\nactually regulate and change your\nemotional states you give them the tools\nto literally step into a new future so\nthat process of course is extremely\nuncomfortable and it's the question is\nhow long\nare you going to stay in that emotional\nstate and 50 percent of the story\nthat most people tell about that past\nexperience isn't even the truth because\nthey're making things up and they're\ndoing that so that they can justify why\nthey haven't changed since some past\nevent\nmost people reach a point in their life\nwhere they reach crisis or disease or\ndiagnosis or loss or betrayal where they\nfinally go gosh it's time to change I\nthink change is an ongoing process and\nthe more we change the more we should\nsee evidence in our life that makes it\nexciting yeah and I I think you're right\nthat\nI've thought about this for a while that\nI feel\nmost people know that they want to\nchange\nand most people know what they want to\nchange but they still struggle to make a\nchange and so I found that we don't\noften have a values crisis we have a\nhabits crisis because people don't know\nhow to reprogram their habits and\nthey've started to assume that the way\nthey feel is who they are and\nI wonder how you think about this\nbecause I think we're living at a time\nwhere what you just said is like you\neither kind of find a way to numb your\nfeelings so you're turning towards\nsomething external to numb how you feel\nor today we're being told well feel\nevery feeling and emotion completely\nand then often we don't kind of get to\nthe reprogramming phase so I guess how\ndo you know how how long to take a\nfeeling seriously effectively and\nassessing it before you kind of take\naction on it a feelings and emotions are\nthe end product of past experiences and\nwe can remember experiences better\nbecause we can remember how they feel\nthe stronger the emotion we have to some\nexperience in our life the more altered\nwe are inside of us\nthe more the brain freezes a frame and\ntakes a snapshot\nand that's called a long-term memory\nthat that image is being bossed\nneurologically in the brain so then\nwhat most people don't know is that\nevery time they remember that event that\ntrauma that betrayal that loss whatever\nit is they're producing the same\nchemistry in their brain and body as if\nthe event is occurring so what happens\nover time is that condition process\nconditions the body to literally live in\nthe past\nso if a person is living by the same\nfamiliar feeling every single day\nwhether it's guilt or unworthiness or\npain or suffering or victimization or\ndepression or whatever it is it's so\nimportant for them to come right up\nagainst\nthat emotional state because they're\ncoming up against the known the question\nfundamentally becomes for that person is\nit possible then to feel a different\nfeeling now if you cannot\nfeel a different feeling other than the\nfeeling that you're used to feeling\nit should tell you volumes about that\nfeeling because it's going to influence\nyour very same thoughts so the research\nthat we've done over and over again is\nthat the only way you're actually going\nto reprogram your brain to work in your\nfavor\nis you've got to learn how to regulate\nyour brain waves and you know this of\ncourse beta brainwave patterns or\nthinking brainwave patterns it's the\nanalytical mind it's our critical\nfacilities the we're in beta right now\nwe're aware of our bodies we're aware of\nthe environment we're aware of time the\nneocortex is switched on it's what plugs\nus into three-dimensional reality it's\nthe seat of the autobiographical self\nthere's a lot of circuits in there from\nthings you've learned intellectually and\nthings you've experienced in your life\nso for the most part it's a repository\nof the past right and so ninety percent\nof those thoughts that we think being\nthe same thoughts as the day before tend\nto become like automatic programs and\nthey become more subconscious and more\nunconscious so in order for us to begin\nto change those programs we got to get\ninto the operating system\nthe only way we do that is we've got to\nslow our brain waves down\nin that thinking neocortex the challenge\nfor most people is they have so many\ndemands in their life\nthey have so many emotional responses to\ncircumstances in their life that they're\nliving in a state of stress and living a\nstate of survival and state of stress\nand survival You Don't Close Your Eyes\nyou got to keep your eye on the ball you\ngot to keep your attention on the outer\nenvironment so uh their brains tend to\nwork in a higher brain wave pattern a\nmid-range or high level beta brainwave\npattern that's like driving your sports\ncar on first gear it's it's a lot of\nenergy for the brain so so learning how\nto regulate and slow your brain waves\ndown is something that we've been very\nvery interested in when you teach people\nhow to do that it could become a skill\nand when the brain starts to relax and\nit moves into less of that chatter that\ntakes place in your brain and more of\nkind of an imaginary State the brain\nsees in pictures and images it's more\ncreative we're moving into that Alpha\nstate so now the door between the\nconscious mind\nin the subconscious mind opens up as we\nget beyond our analytical mind and our\nanalytical mind is actually what\nseparates the conscious mind from the\nsubconscious mind sometimes you slow\nyour brain waves down you get into Alpha\nyou're entering the operating system\nand that's where you can rewrite a new\nprogram that's where you can rehearse a\nnew script\nthat's where you can begin to plan your\nbehaviors in an intentional way\nif you if you can't change your brain\nwaves then it's like your computer\nrunning amok with all of those programs\nand you yelling at it telling it to stop\nyou're not in the operating system\nsome people can get to the point where\nthey're so relaxed\nthat the body's in a light sleep\nand yet they're conscious and awake and\nnow they're in this Theta brain life\npattern and in Theta that's a hypnotic\nState we're very suggestible to our\nthoughts we're very suggestible to\ninformation in that state and that state\nthen is where we see the most change\ntake place and so the person can\nliterally change from the inside out\nwhen they learn how to get into the\noperating system you've just hit the net\non the head with the constant experience\neveryone has I think again going back to\nwhat I was saying that when we're trying\nto make a change the thing that blocks\nus from making the change is usually\nstress if I'm trying to be a kind loving\ncompassionate person but I'm stressed\nout I'm likely to be Snappy and rude and\ncondescending if I'm trying to be\nhealthier in my diet but I'm stressed\nout or burnt out I'm going to reach for\nthe sugary food or the carbs and the fat\nlike that doesn't come from anything\nelse but stress to take away the feeling\nto take away the feeling take away the\nfeeling right yeah so let's get real\nclear because I think it's important for\npeople to understand what we're talking\nplease stress and we're talking about\nliving in survival is so important to\nname those emotions\nbecause anger and frustration and\ncontrol\nand hatred and envy and jealousy and\ninsecurity and unworthiness and guilt\nand shame and suffering and depression\nthose are all derived those are emotions\nthat are derived from the hormones of\nstress and psychology calls those normal\nstates of Consciousness those are\nAltered States Of Consciousness because\nin stress the physiology is that we're\nknocked out of homeostasis we're an act\nout of balance because we perceiving\nsome threat some danger some emergency\nand so the stronger the emotion you feel\nto\nwhatever stressor there is in your life\nthe more you pay attention to it and so\nin time then you have to keep your\nattention on all the important elements\nin your life so you sit down to do a\nmeditation and when you're living in\nstress and you're living in survival\nthere's only three things that are\nimportant in that moment your attention\nis on your body because you got to\npreserve it your attention is on\nsomething in your environment and what's\nin your environment people objects\nthings places and you're very\npreoccupied with time and when you're in\nstress and you're in survival\nthe brain goes onto a default mode and\nit's naturally trying to predict the\nnext moment based on what it's learned\nin the past and so as you'd always try\nto forecast the future based on your\nmemory of the past you can't be in the\npresent moment right so and yet our our\nmodel of change what we discovered is\nthat the only way a person can change is\nwhen they get beyond their body\nthey get beyond all the elements of\ntheir environment and they get beyond\nthat predictable Fusion of familiar past\nand they sink into the present moment\nwhich is the unknown\nso\nif you can't do that because of the\nhormones of stress most people will sit\ndown and they'll say okay I'm going to\nclose my eyes I'm going to start this\nprocess where I'm going to rehearse how\nI'm going to be today and they start\nthinking about their cell phone they\nstart thinking about all their emails\nand they start thinking I can't meditate\nthere's something wrong with me it's my\nmother's fault you know and they\nactually believe that thought to be the\ntruth and then they get up and they they\nactually reaffirm it and they say I\ncan't meditate now\nI can tell you that if you are willing\nto see that thought is just the thought\nin your brain and you're curious what's\non the other side of that thought\nyeah you're going to feel uncomfortable\nbut if you had some tools and skills to\napply and you were able to take your\nattention off your cell phone and settle\nyour body back down into the present\nmoment that would be a victory\nand then your body would say come on\nyou've got to feel a little frustration\nnow you got to be impatient you got to\nbe judgmental come on that's not what\nyou always think that's how you always\nfeel and you like an animal\nyou settle the body back down into the\npresent moment and you tell it it's no\nlonger the mind that you're the mind\nthat's a victory\nthen the body says uh hey dude you're\nsuper busy you got a lot of things to do\nyou got a lot of people to see you got a\nlot of places to go you got a lot of\nthings to do and you've been doing the\nsame thing every day your body's going\nto want to get up\nand do something\nyou don't want to quit because your\nbrain's telling you that you can't do\nthis if you had the awareness to settle\nthe body back down into the present\nmoment you would be executing a will\nthat's greater than the program because\nmost people lose their free will to\nthose programs and it's that tedium\nin the beginning that is an\nuncompromising will\nwhere you keep training the animal\nto stay\nto take all of its attention off the\nenvironment\nto get beyond all the Cravings the\nfeelings the habits of the body the\ndrives of the body\nand catch yourself defaulting to that\npredictable future bringing your body\nback into the present moment siphoning\nenergy back your attention into the past\nbased on those familiar emotions of the\npast we've discovered that if you're\nwilling to do that\nfor just a few days you could actually\nliberate an enormous amount of energy\nfrom your body you go from particle to\nwave from matter to energy and you're\nliterally transmuting those limited\nemotions into elevated emotions and\nsomething really beautiful happens if\nyou're willing to fire The Crucible\nand sit through that long enough all of\nthese emotions move that energy moves\nright up into the heart and the person\nstarts falling in love with life they\nstart feeling this\nstate of gratitude this gratefulness to\nbe alive of this inevitable word of\nrelaxed and awake and something really\nmagical happens when we've discovered\nthis little simple thing\nand that energy makes it to the heart\nthere's only one place it wants to go\nand it goes straight to the brain\nso the person starts relaxing into their\nheart when they feel this feeling and\nthe more they relax into the heart the\nmore their brain all of a sudden starts\nbecoming aroused\nand they start going into these elevated\ngamma brainwave patterns now gamma is\nnot unconscious gamma is actually super\nconscious it's actually super aware\nyou're outside the program now\nso when that occurs and the Brain goes\ninto gamma brainwave patterns what we\ndiscovered is not it's not a little\ngamma\nit's not a lot of gamma\nit's not a whole lot of gamma it's a\nsupernatural amount of gamma and we\nstart seeing these brain waves where we\nsee Theta\nstart carrying Alpha and Alpha starts\nresonating with beta and beta starts\ncreating High beta and high beta starts\ncreating gamma and you see these\nstanding waves of brain coherence\nhappening and the person feels so\namazing that they don't want the moment\nto end and so we see when they put their\nattention on their heart like\nlike filling a gas tank we see on the\ngauge of the on the scan this very low\nfrequency start rising in the heart the\nthe energy that's the heart uses to to\nfunction actually goes up because\nthey're placing their attention there\nand where they Place their attention is\nwhere they Place their energy and then\nyou see the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem come up with it that's the\nnervous system of relaxation\nand then we see it kind of drop\nand we see the sympathetic nervous\nsystem starting to go up and now\nsympathetic regulation is an arousal\nright but the arousal is in fear\nthe arousal isn't hatred or aggression\nthe arousal is in pain that's the\narousal created from survival there's\nonly one other arousal and that's\necstasy that's Bliss and the person all\nof a sudden feels connected\nto something greater now here's the\nbeauty we we could see people do this in\n15 minutes\nthe most important takeaway around all\nof this is that feeling that they're\nfeeling\nis not coming from anywhere outside of\nthem no person's doing that no wardrobe\nchange is doing that no sports car don't\nfootball game nothing is doing it to\nthem it's actually coming from within\nthat is the moment they stop looking for\nit\noutside of them and the love affair\nbegins and so\nwhen we start feeling these elevated\nemotions these more selfless emotions\nit's not like you have to try to forgive\nit actually is the side effect of you\nchanging your emotional state you no\nlonger want because you feel so whole\nhow could you want anything so we we\nstarted interviewing people when they\nhave these moments and and they had such\nan incredible amount of love that they\nfelt or we measure their oxytocin levels\nthey're a love chemicals very elevated\nthe amount of gamma in terms of\ncoherence was 200 300 400 standard\ndeviations outside of normal in coherent\ngamma now three standard deviations\noutside of normal in gamma is about two\npercent of the population 200 300 400 a\nlot of energy in the brain so the brain\nall of a sudden\nis receiving an enormous amount of\nenergy so we've discovered relaxed in\nthe heart\nand awaken the brain and that process of\ntransformation is your willingness to\nsit\npass that thought pass that emotion and\nkeep training the animal and sooner or\nlater you can recondition it to a new\nmind and the system for this new mind\nand this journey that you're talking\nabout is meditation like this is coming\nthrough a meditative practice is that\nsimilar to the breath work meditation\npractice that you just did research on\nor is that totally separate these wow\nokay yeah yes so um our week-long events\nare uh a full immersion experience we've\ndone the largest studies on meditation\nthan have ever been done just because we\nhave a community of 1800 people that\ncome to an event that are going to be\ngetting up at the same time doing the\nsame thing pretty much eating making the\nsame food choices and pretty much\na big laboratory right and so our\ndiscoveries in working with 1800 people\nin in measuring brain waves\ntheir brain function before and after\nthe event\nmeasuring their gene expression before\nand after the event we're measuring\nuh\n2882 metabolites in their blood we're\nmeasuring DNA expression we're measuring\nurine we're measuring saliva we're\nmeasuring the energy of the room we're\nmeasuring everything and meditation in a\nsense that it's not in the traditional\nway\num\nwhat we do is we look at what really\nworks you know we're actually looking to\nsay well that's something that we can\nactually see it change in so we teach\nmeditation three ways to become familiar\nwith your old self and to become\nfamiliar with your new self that's what\nthe word meditation means\nfamiliarization to become familiar with\nso we use that model for change so slow\nyour brain waves down and get beyond\nyour analytical mind this meditation and\nyou teach your body how to do that and\nwe've discovered a formula that that\nsimply makes it very easy for people to\ndo it you practice it you'll get good at\nit just like anything else you practice\nso so to get beyond the analytical mind\nthere's another way to reprogram\nourselves and then meditation is really\nabout getting beyond your body\nor disconnecting from your body\ndisconnecting from your environment and\nforgetting about time and that is that\neye of the needle where we begin to make\nthe most significant changes so we're\ndata driven you know we're really\nlooking to see what it is and and when\nwe see brains respond in the same way it\nhelps me\nenormously to teach the material better\nand so the more people understand what\nthey're doing\nand the more they understand why they're\ndoing it the more naturally the how\nbecomes easier and nothing has left the\nconjecture if nothing is left\nSuperstition or Dogma or even in\nspiritual\nyou know traditional words\nyou know science as the Contemporary\nlanguage to demystify that process and\nyou give new people numerous times to\novercome themselves and numerous times\nto connect sooner or later you'll start\nwatching transformation right before\nyour eyes and so one of the cool things\nthat we've discovered is that we have\nso much compelling data to suggest that\nyou're greater than you think more\npowerful than you no more unlimited than\nyou could ever dream we have compelling\ndata that suggests that your nervous\nsystem\nis the greatest pharmacist in the world\nthat it makes drugs that work better\nthan any drug in a drugstore a drug\nstudy is about 18 to 25 cause and effect\ncausality\nour data is between 75 and 85 percent\ncause and effect this is a person\ncreating their own Pharmacy of\nanti-inflammatories their own Pharmacy\nof anti-carcinogenic chemicals their own\nPharmacy of pain relievers who are\nseeing this over and over again\nso we have this incredible data that\nsays that this is no longer\npseudoscience this is the real this is\nreally science the side effect of a\nperson's transformation\nis has changed my belief\nin what's possible I have seen people\nstand on the stage with stage four\ncancers that were in every single organ\nin their body and that metastasized and\nand they have no sign of cancer in their\nbody and we have data that suggests that\nyou put the blood of an advanced\nmeditator and a uterine cancer cell a\npancreatic cancer cell\n70 of the mitochondrial function in the\ncancer cells diminish the mitochondria\nis the energy packets of the cell it's\ntaking energy out of the cancer cell\nworks perfect with what we're seeing\nwith uh the testimonials uh that that\npeople are telling around the world\nwe've seen blind people see we've seen\ndeaf people here we've seen people with\nspinal cord injuries walk again we've\nseen\nALS change we've seen all kinds of\nunbelievable health conditions Changed\nby a person simply changing the way they\nthink the way they act and the way they\nfeel how long have you seen certain\nthings lost like how much does the\npractice have to continue daily\nto sustain impact because I feel that\nyou know this isn't as you know isn't a\none-off thing and that isn't what you're\nencouraging like this is the experience\nof when someone's coming to a retreat or\nan event they're having this\nincredible experience but then do you\nmeasure how people continue to practice\nYeah it's important yeah it's super\nimportant for us um\nuh and of course we have mounds of data\nbut let's see if I can say this uh as as\nclear as I possibly can\nwhen a person has that arousal where\nthey're feeling that elevated emotion\nand their their eyes are closed\nthey're in a room with 1800 people\nthere's music playing in the background\nthey're not eating they're not smelling\nthey're not tasting they're not moving\nabout and feeling\non some level they're having an inner\nexperience right and the body is so\nobjective that it's literally believing\nit's living in a new environment and so\nthat elevated emotion somehow tends to\ndrag the body\nright out of the past into the present\nmoment so many people with\neverything from eczema to muscular\ndystrophy when they have those events\nthere's a biological change that takes\nplace in their body where they feel\ncompletely differently now some people\nheal all the way\nsome people are out of their wheelchair\nand they're walking again but they're\nlimping\nand that doesn't mean it's over it just\nmeans they made contact where they\nthey hit gold and so there's varying\ndegrees that we see we've seen people\nfor seven years work on a terminal\nhealth condition to them seven years to\nheal that health condition some people\nit takes two years three years some\npeople they do it in three months we\nthere's no predictable menu that we can\nsay it's this way now\nwhen people have those\nmore profoundly aroused States it seems\nlike their change is much more immediate\nand much more permanent\nbut for the most part we see people's\nresponse pretty dramatic now it's also\nimportant to say that we have seen\npeople heal\nfrom from terminal cancers\nstop\nfeeling those elevated emotions and\nreturned to responding to the\ncircumstances and conditions in their\nlife and return back to the same\npersonality the same personality is the\nsame personal reality and their bodies\nbelieving it's living in that same\nenvironment and they're feeling the same\nway and they're in the habit of acting\nthe same way and thinking the same way\nand lo and behold the condition returns\nwe've seen people heal themselves of\nParkinson's disease more than once\nhave one response\nto some very serious event in their life\nthat produced a very strong emotion and\nin one hour their condition returned\nbecause they literally went back to\ntheir old self and we've seen that\nperson turn around and reverse the\ncondition again again people do the best\nwith what they think is available the\nperson standing on the stage\nwho's we've had numerous Physicians and\nresearchers stand on the stage they're\nthe four minute mile they're telling the\ncommunity I'm the example of Truth\nnow this is no longer philosophy this is\nno longer Theory here's my scans I we\nhad someone with bilateral breast cancer\njust recently no evidence of cancer in\nher breasts or any lymph nodes no longer\non our liver\nI'm looking out at the audience\nand everybody's leaning in\nthere's the form in a mile and that\nperson's telling the truth and they're\nthey're telling a story and it's not\npretty it's not always Rosy they they\nwent through a lot of Dark Nights they\nwent through a lot of their condition\ngetting worse but every day they had to\nshow up for themselves if they stopped\nshowing up\nand doing the work they would really not\nbelieve it was possible\nbut if they showed up and did the work\nit means that they believe it's possible\nand I think when you believe in\npossibility you got to believe in\nyourself you believe in yourself you got\nto believe in possibilities so it used\nto be a few examples of of that now we\nhave so many great testimonials so many\ngreat stories that now people it's\nbecoming infectious just like a virus or\nany bacteria becomes infectious now\nhealth and wellness becomes as\ninfectious as disease and you get a\ncommunity of people\nstarting to break through when you start\nseeing these changes where people stand\non the stage invariably you're going to\nsee a very strong shift in Consciousness\nand Consciousness is awareness and if\nyou're unaware that you could actually\nheal yourself you'll make the same\nChoice once you see it\nI think it starts creating a brush fire\nand and that's really the exciting part\nso we've seen so many great testimonials\nthat are undeniably uh great stories of\ntransformation and many many of those\npeople still no longer have their eczema\nstill no longer have their Parkinson's\nstill no longer have their cancer yeah\nsince since the last time we spoke I\nknow your team of researchers went and\ndid some work I wanted to ask you some\nquestions about this you did some\nresearch on the impact of one minute\nbreath work how does this impact our\nheart rate variability and how does HRV\nimpact our anxiety let's talk about uh\nheart rate variability because it's\nimportant thing so so your brain is\ntrying to control and predict everything\nthat's taking place in your life because\nstress is actually created when you can\npredict something you can't control\nsomething or you have the perception\nthat something's going to get worse okay\nso you switch on that primitive nervous\nsystem the fight-or-flight nervous\nsystem and as you shift your attention\nfrom one person to another person to\nanother thing to another place to\nanother problem every one of those\ndifferent elements has a neurological\nNetwork in your brain so the arousal of\nthe hormones to say pay attention\nthere's danger as you start shifting\nyour attention to each one of these\nelements that have neurological networks\nin your brain your brain starts firing\nvery incoherently\nand in fact you could actually by\nthinking about your problems turn on the\nstress response just by thought alone\nand that's what most people do\nso now there you are you're sitting in\ntraffic the heart is pumping because\nit's trying to get blood to the\nextremities because A Primitive system\nswitching on saying that there's there's\na predator there's danger\nand the heart is beating against closed\narteries\nand the Heart starts beating out of\nrhythm it starts beating out of order\nand it starts beating very incoherently\nso when you have incoherence in the\nbrain and you have incoherence in the\nheart when waves are incoherent when\nthey intersect with each other they\ncancel each other out and when they\ncancel each other out that's less energy\nin the brain there's less energy in the\nbrain you're going to default to some of\nthose reflexive systems\nIf energy is diminished in the heart\nyou're not going to trust you're not\ngoing to be vulnerable\nyou're not going to want to commune\nyou're not not going to want to connect\nyou're not going to want to feel\ngrateful it's not a time to feel any of\nthose things it's time to run fight and\nhide\nokay so most people say okay well I had\na stressful day I was stressed out the\nentire day at the end of the day they\nturn on the TV and they they relax\nthe important thing to write realize is\nthat if you're relying on something\noutside of you to change that emotional\nstate you'll become dependent on it so\nis it possible then to begin to create\nmore coherence in the brain and the\nanswer is yes because when you're under\nthe gun of those chemicals of survival\nyou're narrowing your focus on the cost\nyou hear something moving in the bushes\nyou freeze and you narrow your focus and\nit's that narrowing Focus that tends to\nbe obsessive when we're in stress we\noverthink things we over analyze that\nactually we've discovered makes the\nbrain worse and it actually makes the\nheart regulate more out of order\nso then we said okay if the brain\nis narrowing its focus and it's becoming\nover attentive\nwhat if we teach it how to do something\nelse what if we teach it how to broaden\nits focus and instead of focusing on\nsomething material or something known\njust open up and focus on nothing\nin the act of broadening Focus actually\ncause a person to stop thinking and\ndoing and start sensing and feeling is\nactually what starts to slow their brain\nwaves down\nthe redundancy of Shifting your\nattention from one person to another\nperson to another problem to another\nthing\ncauses the brain to fire like a\nlightning storm and the clouds very\nincoherently so as you start to open\nyour awareness and sense nothing we've\nseen this thousands of times\nthose different networks that are firing\nout of order start to synchronize\nand what sinks in the brain links in the\nbrain and the Brain becomes more orderly\nit starts to become more coherent\nif you could learn how to rest your\nattention in your heart and where you\nplace your attention is where you place\nyour energy\nregulate your breath start slowing your\nbreathing down even if you did it for\none minute\nyou could actually begin to change your\nbrain waves and you could actually cause\nyour heart to start functioning more\nregulation in more order\nif you said okay\nI'm going to work with my body\nand I'm going to start breathing and I'm\ngoing to start feeling emotions that I\ndo want to feel\nyes it may take you a few minutes to get\nthere but if you keep practicing it over\nand over again\nthe heart starts producing a very\nprofound signal it starts to produce an\nexternal magnetic field it's it's it's\nmeasurable\nso now you have a coherent brain which\nmeans you can get very intentional\nand you have a coherent heart which\nmeans you can feel the emotions of your\nfuture before it happens\nsomehow you have this broadcasting of\nthis wi-fi signal and the Brain tends to\nbe electrical in nature so it's sends\nout an electrical charge into the field\nthe heart is the magnetic charge it's\nwhat draws things to us\nit's the it's the magnetic field and now\nyou actually by changing the way you\nthink and the way you feel you're\nchanging the signal in the field then if\nyou're able to maintain that state\nfor an extended period of time I say\nsomething magical is going to happen in\nyour life\nsomething unusual some unknown\nexperience is going to occur if you keep\nthinking the same way and feeling the\nsame way your life should stay the same\nso we do one minute practices we do five\nminute practices we do 30 minute\npractices we want to get so good at\ndoing it with our eyes closed that we\ncan do with our eyes open yeah no I when\nI hear that like I've had personal\ngenuine experience of that where I've\ndone that when I've had when I'm having\na moment where I'm feeling anxious or\nI'm feeling stressed or\nyou know something unpredictable has\nhappened and I feel that change in my\nheart rate and I notice my breathing\nchange I notice it become more shallow I\nnoticed it become more random I know\nthat when I'm practicing breath work I'm\nable to come back to Stillness I'm able\nto come back to that sense of balance\nand then I'm able to actually approach\nthe issue at hand with more clarity with\nmore connectedness and a feeling of\nconfidence\nbut when someone else who may not have\nhad that experience here or may not be\ntrained in that they're just thinking\nwell how do I solve the problem right\nlike they're they're listening to me and\nyou're going well but I can't because I\njust I need to solve this problem like\nyou're saying like I'm gonna be 30\nminutes late for a job interview or I\njust had an argument with my partner\nthis morning and I've got a big\npresentation this morning as well at\nwork now I'm stressed about it because\nI'm thinking about that or my kid just\nhad got yeah I had to rush him to\nhospital and I'm like like I guess when\nyou're looking at it from a very human\npoint of view it's really hard to\nunderstand the value in this what do you\nsay to anyone who's thinking and feeling\nthat way uh no I think it's I think it's\na reasonable conversation I mean um uh\nsometimes we have to be super aroused\nyeah and sometimes we really have to pay\nattention and sometimes there are\nthreats and dangers where that primitive\nnervous system actually works in our\nfavor and and that's the emergency\nsystem but you gotta also realize that\nyou only have a certain amount of energy\nand if if you're living in emergency\nmode for an extended period of time\nthere's no energy for growth and repair\nthere's no energy for long-term building\nprojects and so when it's needed\nand you have to outrun the Predator you\ngo you don't sit and try to make friends\nwith a predator we're not that good\nyou run right the problem is if you keep\nthat alarm system switched on all the\ntime it gets very addictive it's a great\nanswer it gets very addictive right and\nso\nI've looked at people's brain scans\nand watch their brain get worse in the\nearly days and tap them on the head and\nsay what were you doing in there 100 of\nthe time they were analyzing the\nproblems in their life within that\ndisturbing emotion and if an emotion is\na record of the past and they can't\nthink greater than how they feel they're\nthinking in the past there's no solution\nthere across the river get beyond the\nemotion and you'll see possibility\nbecause you're no longer in the box of\nthat emotional state now that's so much\neasier said than done because you're\ngoing against\nthousands of years of programming of\nliving and survival I mean 200 years ago\nit wasn't easy being human I mean we're\nin survival all the time and famine you\nknow every disease I mean it was it was\nhard to be human\nand so we have to lay down the very\nthing\nwe used our whole life to get what we\nwant for something greater to occur and\nit goes against thousands of years of\nprogramming it's not something\nthat you get good at doing once you got\nto keep practicing so so so you really\nhave two ways to look at it if you're if\nyou're living in stress and you're\nliving in survival and that system is\nswitched on then everything will be a\nthreat everything will be a danger\neverything will be a reason to rush to\nbe impatient to be frustrated to be\njudgmental because that's that's the\nConsciousness that's the emotion we're\nliving by so now you you have a problem\nwith a co-worker you have a problem with\nyour partner whatever it is that you use\nas an example and you have to give a\npresentation now now you really have one\nof two choices either be victimized\nby those conditions in your life and you\nstay in that emotional state and I'll\nsay to you Jay worry that way while I'm\nthis way because of this person the\ncircumstance the person or circumstance\nis controlling the way I feel in the way\nI think anything that controls the way I\nfeel and the way I think I'm victim to\nright okay or I actually can be a\nCreator now okay so when it's the\nhardest that matters the most okay so\nthere's gonna be a story a valid story\nthat's going to go along with those\nemotions that you're gonna have to give\nup that you can address at another time\nfrom a different state\nif you're altered in that state and you\nsay something you do something you write\nthe email you send the text you'll\nalways regret it you'll always say I\nshould have never said that I should\nhave never done that we've got to learn\nthat we're in an altered state at that\ntime so there's only one of two choices\nyou either stay there the whole day and\ntell everybody that story\nor you say okay let me take a moment\nremember that this is the experiment\ncalled life okay let me practice getting\nrelaxed in my Army slow the animal down\nlet me practice I will take a few\nminutes now let me breathe let me get my\nstate back let me change everything okay\nlet me remember who I am who I want to\nbe when I open my eyes and let me\npractice that again now even if you had\nto do that 10 times in one day I would\nsay it was a day worth living I would\nsay it was a day worth living and when\nwe do walking meditations\nuh in our our Retreats we're doing\nwalking meditations so you can practice\ndoing it with your eyes open yeah like\nif you're going to be relaxed in your\nheart and awake in your brain and you\ncan do it with your eyes closed okay\nlet's take it out for a test drive yeah\nlet me open my eyes let me pay a little\nbit more attention to my inner World let\nme practice feeling this feeling and we\npractice feeling this way and let my\nbrain do what it does let me get to\nfinally change my physiology let me\nchange my state let me walk as the\nhealed personally walk as the Abundant\nperson let me walk as if my prayers are\nanswering me walk in the state if I keep\npracticing that over and over it's going\nto become a habit right yes so so we hit\nit as many ways as we can we have at\nleast\nseven or eight different breaths that we\ndo because we see how they all work in\nthe brain\nwe have all kinds of meditations we have\nSitting meditations we have standing and\nwalking meditation laying down\nmeditations because we want you to be\nable to do it because your eyes open\nwith your eyes go standing walking any\nway you can so that you don't default\nand return back to that person now if\nyou do default you didn't fail that's a\nprogram you just went unconscious and\nhow many times\ndo we have to forget\nuntil we stop forgetting and start\nremembering that's the moment of change\nno one no one cares how many times you\nfell off the bicycle if you ride the\nbicycle now you ride the bike so is it's\nthe constant process uh every single day\nand I think that sometimes we look for\nevidence in our life and it hasn't\nhappened and I think it's so important\nthat we still show up yeah yeah because\nthat's the that's where you're changing\nthe most and when you get to that point\nwhere you could care less\nif it happens or not because you feel so\nhappy so grateful for who you are get\nready because your life is going to\nbegin to change in magical ways I'm so\nproud of our community not because they\ndo the work every day not because\nthey're trying to be good or please\nanybody they do it because they don't\nwant the magic yeah to really and I know\nthe experiment is too good is they don't\nthey're going to continue to be a\nCreator in their life so then when they\nchange the way they feel and the way\nthey think and they start seeing\nevidence in their life\nthey're gonna remember what they did\ninside of them to produce that outcome\nand they're going to believe they're\ncreator of their life unless they're the\nvictim of their life and that's\nempowerment yeah and you can take that\naway from anybody you can't tell me now\nyou're too sick to do that you can't\ntell me you're too old to do that you\ncan't tell me you had a horrible past\nyou're too out of shape you can't even\ntell me that you never meditated before\nbecause of people that come\nthey know nothing they get dragged by\nsomebody and they have the most profound\nexperience because they're not expecting\nanything and we have data to suggest\nthat when you don't expect anything\nyou're going to have a profound moment\nso\neverybody can do it there's nobody\nthat's so special to be excluded from\nthis process and we have had people that\nhave had brutal pasts\nwith abuse with trauma we we've seen the\nNavy Seals and prisoners with horrible\nhorrible memories uh literally\ntransformed literally transform uh in\nseven days and I could say right now\nthat you make the time\nevery single day to decide who you're\ngoing to present to the world and you\nget up as that person you're going to\nfall a lot of times but sooner or later\nonce you start to change it's pretty\nhard to go back yeah I think we so\neasily forget that anything that we've\nachieved today any place we've got to\nwas a commitment to refining the process\nit was a disciplined effort to make a\ntiny Improvement on something else when\nyou give the cycle example the bike\nexample the idea that you got back up\nand you maybe changed one thing you knew\nto shift your balance differently you\nknew to Pedal at a different pace like\nyou tried these different things and\nit's what you're saying that it's an\nexperiment if we keep trying the same\nthing we get the same result but the\npoint that I love that you brought up to\nthat answer\nwas the idea that sometimes you do need\nto be an emergency but don't make\nemergency a habit exactly and I think\nthat's where most of us Veer off on the\nwrong path I was asked recently anyone\nwho knows me today knows that I'm a\nhard-working productive high performance\ntype of individual I live a very\nscheduled life and a and a disciplined\nlife and the biggest question I get\naround the holidays is Jay are you able\nto switch off\nand I always go back and give the credit\nto my to my monk training and say I\nswitch off immediately uh as soon as I'm\non the flight home I was I remember\nbefore Christmas I was I was getting on\na flight home back to London and I was\noff the moment I stepped onto the flight\nand it was because I was it's not\nbecause I'm special though because I'm\nunique or I have superpowers it's\nbecause I've simply done what you said\nwhere it's I've trained myself to always\nbe present and so if I'm really present\nin my work like I am with you now then\nwhen I'm on the plane I'm just present\nand I know that it's time to switch off\nand so I I think the idea that our\npresence bleeds and our lack of presence\nbleeds and it's not that you can\nselectively be in emergency here and not\nin emergency here the state you're\nfeeling is going to spread across your\nwhole life like I know a lot of people\nwho are high performance and and I've\nhad to be mindful of this as well it's\nlike they're high performance at work\nbut then they take that high performance\nand they give it to their family and now\nthat family is getting a high\nperformance dad and they don't want that\nthey just want their dad or they want\ntheir mom and so how do we develop that\nI guess that's a highly trained ability\nis is what you're saying is we get the\nability then to say okay I know when to\nuse this and when not to that's that's a\nmore heightened State yeah I mean look\nthere's not there's there's nothing\nwrong with with the hormones of stress I\nmean that's the only way we could\nactually survive or we're part human\npart animal part Divine I mean we have\ntwo things at work here I think the\nbiggest challenge for a lot of people\nand 70 of the time uh people are living\nin that state of survival living in that\nstate of stress the more you understand\nwhat that actually does to you the more\nyou can make better choices on how long\nyou actually do want to stay there\nhere's an example many people who are\nchanging a health condition in our work\nthey start to do the work they start\nnoticing I'm sleeping better I have less\npain I got my appetite back I feel like\nI have more energy they start noticing\nthese subtle subjective changes that go\nto their doctor and their their scans\nstill show that they have their health\nconditions so they're noticing a change\nbut they're not healed all the way no\nthey don't say it didn't work\nthey say what is it about me that I\nstill have to change in order to heal\nwhat thought what Behavior what emotions\nso they're work in progress right\nmany of those people discover that they\nhave one really good hour of meditation\nwhere they feel connected they feel like\ntheir heart is opening up they feel like\ntheir brain is coherent they feel really\ngreat they don't want the moment to end\nand then they spend 15 or 16 hours of\ntheir day back in a program rushing\naround back in their emotional states\nresponding and reacting\nand they realize that how could one hour\nof an elevated State way against 15 or\n16 hours of my response to everyone\neverything in my life emotionally is\nderived from those familiar emotions of\nfear or anger or hatred or or pain or\nsuffering whatever okay so\nnow this is where the practicum actually\ngoes to the next level because they're\nno longer just sitting down and\nrehearsing who they want to be they're\nactually rehearsing for their life\nthey're saying okay when I see that\nperson when I'm in that circumstance I\ncan't go unconscious and feel this\nemotion and I can't go unconscious and\nsay these things or act this way how am\nI going to act what would love do what\nwould greatness look like they don't\nknow they read about it they get more\ninformation and they're building this\nmodel and now all of a sudden the\nresponse\nto people\nto circumstances to problems in their\nlife are changing that's because they're\nchanging then they notice that their\nhealth condition starts to improve a\nlittle bit more now now they don't say\nhow come my Alzheimer's or my\nParkinson's or my ALS has been healed\nthey're saying how much more can I open\nmy heart\nin my day and feel this with my eyes\nopen all day long if I understand that\nif I live by these emotions I'm\nsignaling genes ahead of the environment\noh I'm going to stay in this state\nbecause it's this emotional state that\nis actually going to heal me so I\nremember this feeling I remember this\nfeeling I remember this feeling and now\nthey're no longer trying to remember the\nFeeling Just for any other reason but\nbecause I want to remember the feeling\nwhen they're with their eyes open now\nit's their understanding that the more\nthat they change\nthe more that their health changes and\nand you can have the best diet and you\ncould do the best exercise and you could\nbe really rigid when the food choices\nand vitamins and minerals and keep your\nbody chemically balanced and physically\nbalanced but if you're not emotionally\nbalanced\nand you're constantly in that\nfight-or-flight system stress is when\nyour body's knocked out of homeostasis\nthe stress is when your brain and body\nare knocked out of balance\nso so you you could have all those\nthings working for you but if you are\nliving in fear or you're controlling and\nyou're rigid and you're perfectionist\nand you're hard on yourself it's going\nto make sense that that is going to have\nto change in order for you to change\nright and so yeah people start getting\nthey start getting it that's the only\nway I'm going to change if I don't\nchange it's not going to change yeah one\nof my favorite things as a practical\nexercise I ever did was I literally had\nscript and I mean handwritten like I\nwrote scripts for how I wanted to feel\nwhen I experienced ego or envy and so\nfor for every emotional\nchallenge I had something that I thought\nwas an unhealthy thought I literally had\nlike pages and pages and pages of\nscripts that were built up from research\nthat were built up from spiritual\nliterature that were built up from\nscience whatever it may be of what did I\nwant to be able to say to myself when\nthis thought or that thought came up and\nit sounds so basic but it really does\nrewire your thoughts when now all I can\nthink of is that script sure and I need\nto update that script regularly sure\nthat's a good point I mean I mean I'm\nconstantly yeah it's constantly yeah\nit's not once I'm constantly I mean I\nmean 95 of Who We Are by the time Middle\nAges a set of unconscious thoughts\nbehaviors and emotions I mean those are\nbeliefs and perceptions that we have\nabout ourselves in our lives so I mean\nthis is a never-ending process of\nself-discovery I mean there's always\nchallenges that you'll have in your life\nthat are going to initiate you into\nbecoming conscious of what you're\nunconscious to yeah and you got to meet\nthose challenges from a great level of\nConsciousness and the Consciousness\nthat's created and you can't if you\ndon't your response in the way you feel\nand the way you think being the same and\nif you believe that how you think and\nhow you feel creates your life if you\ndon't change the way you think and the\nway you feel your life is going to stay\nthe same because you're the same I mean\nthat's the way it works so fundamentally\nit's so important for people to\nunderstand that it is actually possible\nto change it really is possible it is\nyeah it is I love that you keep\nrepeating that because it's\nI think that's the hardest part where\nyou've just again the the broken record\nis I can't change nothing will change\nand not realizing that it's just a set\nof habits it's just a set of routines\nthat you've adopted as your reality and\nyou're going to be uncomfortable so get\nused to it so you could either stay\nuncomfortable or you could actually say\nhow do I want to feel let me instead of\nmemorizing this emotion let me memorize\nthis emotion let me open my heart when\nit goes against\neverything that I've been taught and\nprogrammed to do I mean and that's\nreally when it really begins to matter\nthe most so it's it's really an exciting\ntime and and I'm so happy to see that\npeople are wrapping their minds around\nall of this and doing it you know doing\nit for themselves absolutely absolutely\nhave you found a difference and I want\nto get a bit more technical yeah have\nyou found a difference between\nmeditation with breath work and without\nbreath work because I know you do both\nand and what do you find is the\nusefulness and benefits of either so we\ndo so many different types of breath\nbreath for so many different types of\nreasons the breath that we were talking\nabout with Inspire pulling the mind out\nof the body we do that breath to take\nthat creative life force that sits at\nthe base of the spine that that energy\nthat can create another another life\nform the energy we use to digest a meal\nthe energy that we use to run from a\npredator\nwe're taking all that energy that's\nstored in the body emotionally and we're\npulling that energy back up into the\nbrain If you practice this breath\nrepeatedly\nthere will be a release of energy into\nthe brain we have the data to show that\nyou're going to have a lot more energy\nin your brain\nyou're going to be way more coherent in\nyour brain and you're going to be more\nconscious right and so why is that\nimportant why because when you regulate\nyour brain waves we don't want you to\nfall asleep\nwe want you to actually be really\nrelaxed and awake at the same time so we\ndo this one breath called pulling the\nmind out of the body that's the Inspire\nSeries where we're taking all that\nCreative Energy and we're with the\nbreath pulling that energy right up to a\nspecific area of the brain\nwhen you do that properly your brain\nwill go into an altered state that's the\nreason why we do it then we do all kinds\nof other breathing like breathing to\nchange the heart rhythm uh sometimes\nwhen we're doing a laying down breath\nwhen we're practicing getting into that\nmystical state\nuh just when the audience is just\nstarting to move into a slower brainwave\nState we'll do a very forced inhalation\nexhalation inhalation over and over\nagain like a hiker's breath only so that\nthe person feels euphoric and so\neuphoric that they don't want to fall\nasleep and they'll move into a slower\nbrainwave pattern in the door between\nthe conscious mind and the subconscious\nmind opens and many times there's a\nmystical experience waiting for that\nperson that's transcendental so so we do\nall kinds of different breathing\ntechniques because we have different\nintentions behind each one of them if\npeople want to dive into those where\nwhere should they go if they want to\nkind of grab some of those techniques or\nget access are they only at the events\nthere's an online course that we offer\ncalled the progressive Workshop in the\nProgressive Workshop we teach a few of\nthose breaths and if you come to a\nweek-long event you'll have an\nopportunity to do all of them and we\nstart at six in the morning we finish it\nI don't know Cancun the last one we did\nI think we finished at 8 or 8 30 every\nnight it was just a great group of\npeople and we go seven days Jason and\nsome mornings a little earlier but uh\nyou got a lot of practice you got a lot\nof tools so by the time you leave you\ncan you can use them in your life yeah\nthat's amazing yeah for anyone who can't\nobviously get to the Live Events then\nthe online course will be helpful but if\nyou can go yeah and I think I think\nthere's some good descriptions also in\nin becoming Supernatural my last book\nwhere we break it all down uh yeah and\nthen there's some tutorials that we have\non our website to help you with some of\nthe breathing here I love that Joe is\nthere anything I haven't asked you about\ntoday or anything that's on your mind\nand heart that you really want to share\nwith everyone or something you've been\nworking on or or anything you feel\ncompelled to share gosh we uh we covered\na lot we've covered a lot we're doing\nsome really cool research with random\nevent generators and random event\ngenerators are sophisticated coin tosses\nyou know if you the more you toss a coin\nthe more you're going to get 50 50 heads\nheads or tails right so this machine\ngenerates program machine generates um\nabout a thousand tosses in a second so\nyou're looking at a very very\nsophisticated machine and if you run for\n30 minutes you're going to see in time\nan equal number of ones or zeros or\nheads or tails and you're gonna see the\nstraight line\nwhen you get a group of people together\nwith brain coherence and hard coherence\nthey're emitting a field and when we do\nhealings in our events a hundred percent\nof the time when we do those healings\nthose random event generators have\ndramatic skews to show that random\nevents become less random and more\nintentional and it's Collective networks\nof observers that determine reality and\nit's not the number of people it's not\nthe amount of energy because it could be\nentropic\nit's the most coherent energy and\ncausing a machine that's programmed to\nbehave in a very very different way and\nI think that idea of community\nof people coming together when everybody\nelse is in fear to show courage when\neverybody else is in pain to show\ncompassion when everybody else is in\nanger or hatred that to show love I mean\nI think by Nature as human beings I\nthink we are wired to give to connect to\ncommune to take care of one another to\nheal one another to shine for one\nanother and our data is so exciting to\nactually support that theorem yeah I\nlove that you brought that up and I'm\nthat's you know that's very macro and\nbig as well but also micro in that\nyou're you're measuring people's daily\nexperience I think you know when I think\nabout families who live together or\ncouples or Partners or whoever you may\nbe you know when you're sleeping\ntogether when you're waking up together\nat the same time when you're sitting for\nmeals together when you know we realize\nand we know that the sign shows that\nyour heart rate sync up like your\nheartbeats sync up when you're with\nsomeone and I think think it's really\ninteresting because I think today in our\nindividualistic world there's a big\ndesire to do things at our own time when\nwe want how we want\nbut if you're truly trying to build a\nrelationship with someone else or build\ncommunity there's so much to be said for\ndoing these basic practices at the same\ntime together right it's really hard to\nbe in community when you're in survival\nuh because survival makes us put our\nattention on ourselves right uh and I\nthink that when people are not living in\nsurvival when they're out of survival\nour nature really is community is is\nculture is connection and it starts with\nthe self\nthen it starts with our closest\nrelationships and builds out from there\nand I think that's a a healthy model you\nknow for for the world I mean when\nyou're working on yourself and I'm\nworking on myself and I'm okay with me\nand you're okay with you we're going to\nbe okay with everybody you know and I\nthink when we're not okay with ourselves\nuh that's when it gets complicated\nit's amazing everyone who's listening\nand watching make sure you go and follow\nJoe across social media we'll put the\nlinks to everything uh in the sections\nthere so you can follow along but I want\nto make sure that you share with me your\ngreatest insights tag me and Joe on\nInstagram on Twitter on Tick Tock\nwhatever platform you're using let us\nknow what you'll be practicing I hope\nthat there's parts of this conversation\nthat you'll listen to again and again\nand again because you have to realize\nthat the first time you hear it there\nmay be some inspiration there may be\nsome insight but the second time that\nrepetition is going to help you actually\napply rewire and reconfigure so make\nsure you repeat listen and make sure you\nshare this with a friend as well so you\ncan discuss it talk about it put it into\nyour own language and your vocabulary\nthat's such an important part of putting\nthis into practice as well uh Joe as\never thank you so much for making the\ntime and effort I know that you've\nalways got unpredictable things\nhappening in your life like this morning\nbut you chose to be here and uh thank\nyou so much for being here I really\nappreciate it thank you Jay thank you\nfor having me thank you if you love this\nepisode you'll enjoy my interview with\nDr Daniel Amen on how to change your\nlife by changing your brain you want to\ndrip dopamine don't dump it because when\nyou dump it with the fries and the\nalcohol the porn you don't have much\nleft and so then you have to"
