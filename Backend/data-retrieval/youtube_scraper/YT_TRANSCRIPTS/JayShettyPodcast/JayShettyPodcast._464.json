    "transcript": "wait a minute I'm trying to make\neveryone happy I'm doing all this stuff\nfor everyone else but myself let me just\nlike\npull back a second focus on myself and\nthen it seemed like everyone else was\nhappier the best-selling author and host\nthe number one Health and Wellness\npodcast on purpose with Jay Shetty\nwhen was the last time you went\nsomewhere where someone didn't know who\nyou were or actually was there a moment\nwhere someone said to you who are you\nwhat do you do like when was the last\ntime you had an interaction like that\nyou know what in Japan it's like that\nyou know everyone's really respectful\neven if they might recognize you they\ndon't ask for photos and it's a really\namazing experience I think it's\nimportant you know just to listen I love\nmy life I love everything that comes\nalong with it I am not complaining but\num a little glimpse of that I think\nespecially for the little ones is so\ngood yeah no that's that's that's\ndefinitely a beautiful experience I\nthink it's nice for everyone to feel\nwanted and loved and then also feel\nunseen yeah like we almost crave both of\nthose I was thinking about it today\nyou're always surrounded by film Crews\nand you know you have like 352 million\npeople that follow you on Instagram I\nwonder do you ever do you prioritize\ntime alone do you get time alone and\nwhat does that look like I do I get up\nreally early my morning workout really\nis my I don't want to say therapy\nsession because it's not like I'm really\ncommunicating things but even if I'm\nquiet and I'm in my zone that's my\nmental health check every morning I love\nmy workout it keeps me sane I can't say\nthat enough that's my time in the\nmorning then\nas soon as everyone starts to get up for\nschool the madness happens and it's\nabout two hours of Madness from getting\nfour kids ready in the morning fed out\nthe door\nAunt to school I drop off school every\nday and then I have a little bit of time\nI'd say about 20 minutes driving back\nwhere I just blast my music I don't take\nany calls that's my alone time I love it\nand then I get to the house and I start\nmy full work day and I'm committed and\nfocused and then The Madness of bath\ntime bedtime dinner time\nand once four babies are asleep and I\njust cherish that time at night when\neveryone's asleep and I can watch\nwhatever show I want and just have some\nalone time so I do take the time for\nmyself I think it's really important\nyeah absolutely you said something\nbeautiful before we started recording\nand I I definitely want to go in that\ndirection because you were talking about\nthe different platforms and how you can\nshow different parts of yourself but you\ncame here because there was something\nspecific and I'd love to hear that\nbecause I want to go in that direction\nwith you I love your podcast I've seen\nit and I've seen I think I just love\nseeing the the reels that pop up with\njust a quick message that'll get you\nthrough the day that'll remind you who\nyou are remind you what you need to come\nacross and see at that moment and that\nday and carry you through the day yeah\nso I think it's important for people to\nexpress like how they feel and who they\nare a little bit deeper and what's in\ntheir heart\nand I think that's kind of what this\npodcast is about yeah and I think thank\nyou for trusting me I really do value\nthat and I don't take it for granted uh\nbut the interesting thing there is I\nfeel like\nthere's a beautiful statement in\nJapanese culture says that we have three\nfaces one face we show to the world\nthe second phase we show to our friends\nand family and the third face no one\nsees and I wonder when you're talking\nabout your values and who you are\nwhat's the part of you that you think no\none gets to see in all these other\nplaces that you want to share today\num\nall my faces but I do think that people\npick and choose what they want to take\nfrom you I do share journeys of mine\nthat have been challenges whether it's\nlike law school and different projects\nand how starting a business and all of\nthat I definitely weave that in\nthroughout but I think that anytime you\nhave the opportunity to express yourself\nin a more meaningful way I think it's\nalways a good thing to do especially\nsince I'm just a big fan of you and what\nyou represent and who you are so I\nalways love to share my tips and\nanything that I've learned along the way\nbecause God knows it is not easy yeah\nlike parenting is so hard family\nDynamics relationships it is so hard\nit's really interesting you say that\nbecause when I was speaking to your mom\nshe was saying that about you she was\nsaying that you're the person that for\nanyone in your family no matter how busy\nyou are you'll go completely out of your\nway she was telling me about a\nparticular incident but she was just\nsaying that you will just\ndive in book everyone on the flight get\neveryone there get to that person help\nthem support them and and even when it's\nsomeone who's not directly connected to\nyou but is indirectly connected and yeah\nI'm sure you know what I'm talking about\nbut the idea of just you you reached\nthat far out and when I was hearing that\nabout you from her\nI was thinking that that takes so much\ncompassion and care\nfrom your side and those are not two\nwords that on some of the other\nplatforms that people may hear about you\nbut but that's what I'm getting talking\nto your mother about you and I wonder\nhow have you I feel families the cause\nfor so much stress for people it's the\ncause for so much anxiety for people and\nas you said it's hard how have you\ncontinued to lean in to compassion and\ncare\neven when it's easier to compare and\ncriticize and complain well with family\nI mean I was always raised like no\nmatter what blood is thicker than water\nthere's no other options so we\ndefinitely go through our things as\nsisters there's no other options like we\nwill work it out like We are family we\nare sisters we will figure it out and I\nthink you just have to I think also more\ncompassion comes with age and the more\nthings that you've been through and\nespecially I think my heart has opened\nup so much in that space just spending\ntime even with people behind bars that\nI'm fighting for and I might not have\neven had the slightest idea\nof what someone's gone through or even\nunderstood taking the time to listen to\npeople\nmore than maybe speaking and making it\nabout yourself and my compassion has\njust grown and my empathy has grown on\nanother level you can't really judge\npeople for their Pace on when they\nchoose to really want to dig deep into\ntheir own compassion and empathy and\nwhen people choose to grow and evolve\nbut it's so nice to have people that\nsupport that journey and grow with you\nbecause once you realize that this life\nreally isn't about you and it's about\nhelping as many people as you can all\nthese like doors open up for you and\nyour mind just opens up and it's a\nreally great place to be when you feel\nlike you have enough\nwhen you would Chase things for so long\nand when you just feel content\nit's such a good place to be and it's\nsuch an\nlike allows for so much more compassion\nI think and I want everyone to go back\nand listen to that but I feel like you\njust beautifully defined compassion and\nI'm gonna try and reiterate what you\njust said yeah it was just it was so\nwell said because I think people think\nabout compassion as care and you just\nDefine it by pace and I think when\nyou're patient for the pace at which\npeople grow and evolve that actually is\ncompassion there's nothing worse when\nsomeone is like so woke and they've\nthey're on this therapy journey and they\nexpect you to be right there with them\nbut it's a beautiful thing to sit back\nand watch people\nmake mistakes learn from their mistakes\ngrow and evolve and just be there to\nhold their hand and support them I think\nthat's what anyone would want I've seen\nso many people\non these like self-help Journeys that\njust\naren't as happy\nyou know and I think you just have to\nlike sit back and do what works for you\nand move at your own pace and understand\nthat it's okay that you're not at the\nsame level as someone else yeah I mean\nI'm just such a like everything happens\nthe way it's supposed to I love just\npeople in their own Journeys and I I\nnever try to be so preachy or to think\nthat someone has to be in my place\nand at the level where I've evolved to\nit's great when your friends have the\nsame kind of epiphanies as you and you\nwant the same things but then sometimes\nit's just not like that yeah yeah\ndefinitely there's you brought two\nthings to my mind one was what real love\nis like when you really love your family\nyou don't love them because they change\nyeah you're patient with them as they\ntry to change that's what love is\nbecause they may or may never get to the\nother side and the other thing that came\nto mind is something my teachers would\noften tell me my monk teaches they would\noften repeat to me that you're never\ntrying to get someone to the next step\nin your journey you're trying to get\nthem to the next step in their Journey\nyeah and I think you're so right that\nwhen we're doing self-work we are\nconstantly preaching to other people\nabout the things we want to hear yeah\nand the things we want to do yeah and\nlike self-work can just be so different\nfor so many people you know like my\nmorning workouts I swear that's my\nself-work my drive in the car every day\nblasting whatever music I want to like\nthat is my meditation that's my zone\nand that works for me you know when I\nneed help and I need\nhelp figuring out different parenting\nthings and different methods that I can\nuse I will reach out and get the help\nthat I need when I need it for sure but\nI also think there's just\nthere's no like right method of what\nworks\nfor\neveryone you know it's like whatever\nworks for you\ngood for you yeah yeah absolutely\nabsolutely I feel like when when people\nsee you and even even now you're talking\nyou have so much trust in yourself or\ntrust in your inner voice that doesn't\nmean you I don't believe you're saying I\nalways get it right or this is the only\nway what you're actually saying is I've\nlearned to trust my voice and I wonder\nwas there a time when you didn't trust\nthat voice and or can you remember the\nfirst time where you started to hear it\nlike I remember the first time I really\nstarted to hear my voice deeply was\nprobably when I was 14 years old and\nthat's when I could hear this voice\ninside of myself that was like Jay this\nis who you are this is what you care\nabout this is what matters to you you\ndon't need to be this or be that or do\nit this way and I remember I started\nlistening to it then and now that inner\nvoice is really loud yeah it's always\nthere but I wish I listened to my inner\nvoice said 14. well do you remember when\nyou first started like because when I'm\nhearing you now you're just like yeah\nlike I'm very comfortable with people\nbeing themselves and I'm comfortable who\nI am which is beautiful but when that I\nfeel so many people want to live that\nway but that's the thing we all struggle\nwith it definitely didn't come right\naway you know I was a people pleaser and\nI would make decisions based off of\nother people's happiness for so long and\nI would say honestly in the last few\nyears\ndefinitely at 40 you know I figured it\nout of just following my happiness which\nwas really I think an important place\nfor me to get to because I always put\nother people's happiness over my own\nand it doesn't mean you disregard other\npeople's feelings and it doesn't mean\nyou don't care and you don't love them\nbut it is a great place to be when you\nfinally put yourself first and I will\nsay that took a long time and that was\nlike relying on other people for\nconfidence in business decisions and\nit's great to have your team and to\nalways like bounce ideas and make sure\nthat you're collectively picking the\nright choice and and work thing for you\nbut true confidence where you feel\nyou're making the right decisions\nyou know you got it you are thinking\nabout yourself first and not just in a\nselfish way but like in a\nprotecting your heart way it feels\nreally good and I might not have gotten\nthere until I was\nliterally 40.\nand what do you think it was about the\nlast few years where you had to turn\ntowards that that pushed you there I've\nnever been an unhappy person I'm always\nreally happy with my surroundings I\ndon't need people to make me happy I'm\nnot really ever searching for something\nI'm really content my babies make me\nhappy my family my life you know\nexperiences make me happy but when you\njust look around and when there's like\ntension and stress that is just not\nnecessary\nfrom work from relationships from\nfriendships\nand you just decide to be still\nand\nnot try to please everyone\nit becomes just really clear\nand you realize that you just want to be\nhappy and you want to share this life\nand these experiences with your group of\npeople that you trust and you love and\nwho are super loyal like life is always\ngoing to be stressful and you can't\ncontrol half of it but if you can\ncontrol what you put out and how you\nreact to all of life's stresses and your\nresponse to all of that and realizing\nthat you could eliminate a lot of those\nstresses with making yourself happy\nfirst and choosing yourself then you\nknow you're on the right path and once I\ndid that and once I chose\nto choose myself and be happy\nso many opportunities just opened up\nthings that I never thought in a million\nyears would come my way\nit seemed like\nclear as day that the Universe was\nrewarding me for choosing myself and\nlike elevating\nlike getting to the next level in the\nvideo game like I had to get here and I\nwas always like here just in my growth\nprocess and once I chose myself it was\nlike oh my God the whole the universe is\nopening up for you and all these\nopportunities are coming my way and\nthose were the confirmations that I was\nheading in the right direction I\nremember saying that to one of my\nsisters I was like oh my God it is so\ncrazy I got this opportunity this\nopportunity this is changing this is\nchanging and it seemed like all these\namazing things started to happen in my\nlife\nwhen I just took a second\nwas still realized wait a minute I'm\ntrying to make everyone happy I'm doing\nall this stuff for everyone else but\nmyself let me just like\npull back a second\nfocus on myself and then it seemed like\neveryone else was happier because\neverything was just falling into place\nand that was like I saw it clear as day\nand that would like push me and motivate\nme to continue to just\nbe happy and do what I wanted to do\ninstead of what other people wanted to\ndo and that was like it was like a good\nfeeling\nit really like\nshowed me that I was making the right\ndecisions\nI'm so happy for you thank you genuinely\nand it's a good place to be when you're\ngenuinely a happy person you know like\nno complaints yeah like not taking\nthings too seriously\nnot taking yourself too seriously is\nalso a little key to happiness yeah I\nthink the energy that gets lost in\nworrying about something versus working\ntowards fixing it or solving it yeah can\njust worrying the worrying if you worry\nabout something it's not going to change\nthe outcome\nlet's just come up with a solution\nlike let's say what the problem is not\ncomplain I'm not a complainer so it's\nlike let's just get to the solution\nlet's figure it out and let's move on\nabsolutely nothing worse when you\ncomplain every step of the way\nyeah and and it's and it's natural and\nit's easy but it we all know it doesn't\nget you to where you want to go yeah and\nand I think that's that's a big reason\nwhat's the uh\nI wonder with what you were saying one\nof the big things that comes out as you\nwere talking about family and people in\nyour life and you talked about your life\nas chat like there's this loyalty is\nsuch a big value for you yeah across\nyour life it seems yeah what have you\nlearned about people that you wish you\nlearned sooner was there something that\nyou started to learn and recognize\npatterns in people and that has made you\nbetter now but you wish like ah if I\nlearned this a couple of years sooner\nthan it could have saved me a lot of the\nstress and challenges that came up don't\ntake anything personally I've been\nreally blessed to have really great\nsolid relationships I have the same\ngroup of best friends we went to\npreschool together we talk every single\nday my best friend is my best friend\nsince the day I grow up you know when I\nwas born the people I work with my\nfamily\nmy sisters but my best friends sisters\nalso you know and everyone I trust\na hundred percent\neveryone is so loyal a hundred percent\nyou can't come up to me and tell me\nsomething about one of my friends\nif like someone were to say oh this\nperson said this about you and they're\nin my circle I would be absolutely not\nlike I would trust that a hundred\npercent\nand I think that's so rare or what I've\nseen is so rare and I just feel so lucky\nto just love everyone around you trust\neveryone around you they trust you my\nfriends know they can call me any hour\nI'll be the first one to pick up and\nhelp all of my friends would drop\neverything to help me in a situation and\nto have that real support and love I\nthink is everything in life to have\nloyal supportive people around you and I\nthink you can also tell so much about a\nperson that has really long-standing\nrelationships that stability\nWhen I Look to hire people I look at\ntheir previous jobs and how long they've\nhad those relationships for and think\nabout it if there's someone that's\nbouncing from job to job obviously there\ncould be other situations that come into\nplace but I value people that have these\nlong-standing relationships with people\nwhether it's their employer or family\nand that's super important to me to have\nall my friends have really\nimportant relationships in their life I\nthink that says a lot about you and the\nfamily because I wonder what it takes to\nhold on to a relationship like that when\nyou're on a rocket ship right I feel\nlike all of us deal with shifts in our\nlife Transitions and family and friends\nthat we want to hold on to but it gets\nharder and harder especially when\nthere's success when there's Envy when\nthere's competition and sometimes it's\nnot because someone doesn't love you or\ndoesn't care about you it's so natural\nin the world we live in and so what does\nit really take because I think this will\nhelp a lot of people what does it\nactually take to hold on to someone you\nlove and continue with all the noise and\nall the challenges and all the stress\nthat comes with it what does it actually\ntake because but then there's those\nfriends that you don't have to talk to\nevery day I mean thank God for group\nchats where you can chime in and heart\nsomething really quick you know but like\nyour real best friends will also support\nyou and it takes but it's it takes that\nmutual respect because what my friends\nare doing if they have something that's\nimportant to them it's just as important\nfor me to show up for them as it is for\nthem to show up for me I might have a\nmore colorful life and a bigger event\nthat I'm asking them to show up to but\nit doesn't mean that theirs isn't just\nas important so I think just having that\nmutual respect treating people with\nrespect is just a given I truly think\nsomeone is such a solid person when they\nhave really grounded relationships\ngrounded in love and and relationships\ncan be different things you know\nsometimes you have your group of\ngirlfriends that you love to go on\nvacation with and then sometimes you\nhave you know your other friends that\nyou work really well with every\nrelationship can be different if you\nhave just a mutual respect around the\nacross the board that's I think the\nnumber one thing yeah it takes two yeah\nit takes two that's the point it's\nyou're not going to be able to create it\nor falsely hold on to it someone who\ndoesn't totally want to give you that\nrespect yeah it's not going to happen\nyeah you talked about earlier about\nparenting and you brought up a few times\nand I wonder how you you don't have kids\ndo you I'm not yet not yet okay we'll\nhave this conversation again yes\nabsolutely that's what I'm asking that's\nwhat I'm asking parenting questions what\nwas your vision like for what you\nthought parenting was going to be like\nversus what it actually is everyone says\nthe days are long and the years are\nshort and that couldn't be like a more\ntrue statement so like when you're in it\nI mean\nespecially when they're babies and\nyou're feeding and you're there's\nMadness going on it's like\nfull Madness it's the best chaos though\nlike my mornings you have no idea what's\ngoing on it's like I always have to do\none of my daughter's hair and it has to\nbe perfect and it has to be a certain\nway and then this one needs me to put\nhis shoes on and that they all need you\nand they all it's like full crazy\nMadness cooking running around like it's\nit's wild that's why I need my workout\nin the morning just to like prepare for\nthe two hours of craziness\nI'd say parenting is the thing that has\ntaught me the most about myself\nit has been the most challenging thing\nthere are nights I cried myself to sleep\nlike what just happened you know with\nall the moods and the personalities and\nsometimes they're fighting and there's\nno one there like it's it's me to play\ngood cop and bad cop so like that is\ndefinitely a challenge when you know\nsomething I'm working on is being a\nlittle bit firmer you know there's\nnothing that can prepare you anyone any\nperson that says oh we're waiting to\nhave X amount of money in the bank oh\nwe're waiting to have a home before we\nhave kids oh I'm waiting for this job to\ncome in before we have kids\nI don't care how long you wait I don't\ncare what you're waiting for you are\nnever prepared but you will figure it\nout\nand it will make you so proud of\nyourself that you figured it out and\nthat you got through the day and\nsometimes it's nights where it's just we\nare going hour by hour to see if we're\ngoing to survive\nNight by night\nif a tantrum comes in oh my God your\nlife is completely upside down\nbut\nit teaches you so much more about\nyourself\nthan I think anyone any parent could\nhave ever anticipated I mean there is\nnights when you don't wash your hair for\ndays as a mom and you have sped up all\nover you and you're wearing the same\npajamas you know and there's just\nnothing that can prepare you for this\nexperience\nit is the most challenging rewarding job\non this planet when was the moment when\nyou were looking into your baby's faces\nand said I want to run away I'm\nI need to hide for a night every night\nI'm just kidding no no yeah no thank you\nit's I mean it's honest I think there's\na there's a little bit of Truth in that\nfeeling that a lot of parents have\nwhat's what's the hardest when you've\nbeen looking when you look into their\nfaces and you had one of these moments\nwhere you were learning these lessons\nwhat was the hardest lesson you had to\nlearn about yourself that made you go\nwhoa I didn't\nI didn't see that before if it wasn't\nfor that kid I wouldn't have seen that\nyeah it happens all the time I always\nthink everything in life comes our way\nto really teach us something\nand it's a really hard task when you\nhave four kids and you know they all\nwant to be put to bed at the same time\nby the same person and they all want to\ndo it individually and have that\nexperience and no one wants to wait and\nI'm locked in a room with kids banging\noutside of the door because they want me\nto put them to bed and I'm like I can't\ncut myself in four pieces so we're gonna\nhave to schedule this out and we're\ncoming up with a schedule and none of\nthem want to listen to the schedule and\nthen they all start crying\nand that's like a typical night you know\nand so I like sit them outside of my one\ndaughter's door and I'm like I'll pick\nyou up next we're doing this for 15\nminutes and they can't be patient and\nthey're banging on the door come on it's\nbeen five minutes you know it's like\nthose nights are every single night big\nschool projects big things that are\nhappening and they don't understand that\nI work or I have a school schedule too\nor you know stuff kids will never\nunderstand so I think it's just those\nnights when you can't divide yourself\nand you have to just work with what we\nhave and try to bribe two of them to get\nput to bed at the same time you know I\nthink unless you're a pain like so much\nrespect to parents\nso much respect to people also that\naren't parents that want to live their\nfree life\nenjoy it while you can\nI was at Easter on Palm Springs and I\nlooked at my mom's house and she had her\ntable set for all of her kids all of her\ngrandkids\nand we're all staying in her house\nand I was like\nit's it's a forever thing it's not like\nhey okay you're 18 and you're on your\nown it's a forever thing and we're in\nour 40s and we're still coming at her\nand fighting and asking my mom to\nresolve everything and I look at her and\nI'm like how did you do it I personally\ncan't wait for my kids to get a little\nbit older everyone like is so afraid of\nthe teenage phase I'm so excited for it\nplay this back for me when they're\nteenagers but I see the relationship I\nhave with my mom and I knew the\nrelationship I had with my dad and how\ncomfortable we were talking to them\nabout all of our problems and all of our\nfriends stuff and all of the drama and\nall of the high school stuff and even\nthe stuff I talked to my mom about now\nand how open I am about life and\nrelationships and how close we are even\nif we didn't get it as a kid I can look\nat her now and say\nI get it as a mom now as an adult now I\nknow why you made those decisions and I\nlove having that relationship and that\nis why I wanted to have four kids I saw\nmy mom you know and my dad had four\ntogether before she had my two little\nsisters and I loved the big family and I\nalways knew I wanted to have four kids\nand I I just love so much our\nrelationship with her and my grandma and\nI just can't wait to have that with my\nkids I can't wait till they're old\nenough to understand so much that I can\nnever explain to them now that they'll\nget one day and we can laugh about it\nthat's so beautiful yeah you reminded me\nof uh a beautiful old saying that says\nthe day you realize your parents were\nright your kids are telling you that\nyou're wrong\n[Music]\nso true yeah and it's like that idea of\njust your when you're a little boy you\nlike adore your mom at least I did them\nuntil like 13 years old then you become\na teenager and you think you're too cool\nfor your mom yeah and then in my time\nyeah I have like contracts with myself\nI'm like you're Never Gonna Leave me we\nalways have to be besties you're never\ngonna be too cool for me and they always\nsay yes yeah I'm like you can live with\nme in your 20s your 30s never move out\nthey said okay they've signed the\ncontract yeah yeah and they have no idea\nthey'll breach it yeah it'll it'll be\nokay yeah you won't sue them yeah but\nthe I wonder how in your position like\nyou know what you just described is what\nso many people go through and like you\nsaid it's so hard for them to experience\nthat but when you're expanding things\nlike the paparazzi or like you're saying\nthat when you're in Japan like you\ndidn't have that experience and that was\nso nice for the kids like how do you\nwalk them through the nuances of the\nlife that you lead and I'm guessing a\nlot of their friends also have similar\nlives but I'm sure they have some\nfriends who who don't have parents like\nyourselves and so how how do you help\nthem reconcile or what are the kind of\nthings that you talk about with them or\nwhat can they understand at this age and\nwhat are you like well that's just gonna\nhave to wait I'll talk to my kids about\nanything they want to ask me about I am\nso open and honest with my kids I think\nthat's the only way to be and it could\nbe things that they might not understand\nand I'll wait to find the appropriate\ntime to talk about it I think they grew\nup seeing the cameras and they grew up\nseeing that even as babies you know we'd\nwalk out and there'd be Paparazzi so\nit's not really something that they\nacknowledge a lot but you know my\ndaughter's really vocal she'll tell them\nwhen she doesn't want them around and to\nleave her alone and to stop and I love\nthat they use their little voices but\nthey also have such a normal life in\nsuch a different life away from all of\nthat too and that's why I love that my\nsisters and I all had babies at the same\ntime so they can be with each other and\nhave these experiences together\nabsolutely I when I'm\nyou know there's all the words that come\nout from you are like togetherness\nloyalty it's it's incredible to see it\nin family but I think what you've then\ndone which when I saw you do this it it\nreally moved me when I saw you kind of\nmove into that direction of Justice\nReform and using your voice and training\nto be a lawyer to make this these\nchanges in the world out there because I\nfind that you know there's there's a\nnatural sense of survival as a family\nbut then when you start taking into\naccount the survival of others there's\nan extension of love and you know what\ngoes out to the world and yeah I think\nit was really special to see then this\npodcast has got on purpose for a reason\nbecause I think everyone's searching for\ntheir purpose would you say that that\nwas a expression of purpose or\nabsolutely\nI mean I think that's one of those\nmoments like by chance I happen to be\nlooking on social media and seeing a\ncase that I just didn't understand and\nI'm always a really curious person so\nI'll never let something go if it's\nWeighing on my heart to not at least try\nto figure out how it happened I've\nalways been really interested in crime\nstuff and solving things and figuring\nthings out\nso when I saw a case of a woman that\njust didn't make sense to me I was\nreally curious and I sent this little\nvideo that popped up on my Twitter to\nattorneys that I knew really well that\ncould answer questions for me and then\nwhen it seemed like I couldn't just sit\nthere it was really Weighing on my heart\nwhen I felt like it was so unfair I\ndidn't know that there was like\nthousands of cases that were so unfair I\njust thought oh wow like I have to help\nthis person and then when I was\nsuccessful in doing that on my journey I\nrealized like wait there's so many more\npeople like this like I can't not do\nsomething\nand I think that that also goes with\nwhatever is meant to come to you at your\nown pace for your own learning levels is\nwhat's meant to be because that came to\nme I wasn't like searching for that and\nthat changed my life and it changed who\nI am I just can't sit around and see\nthis happen to other people that aren't\ndeserving\nof\num their freedom I think just everyone's\non their own path and things will come\nto you when you need to be like elevated\nto that growth level and I'm really\ngrateful for those experiences because I\ndefinitely think that that's my purpose\nwhat internal changes did you see in\nyourself that that maybe you didn't see\nbefore when you started doing this work\nlike what did you have to Grapple with\ninternally was there anything that you\nhad to break through inside yeah what\nwere those things I would say I always\nfelt like I was a compassionate person\nand a caring person and I always cared\nabout people's feelings but my level of\nempathy was at a completely different\nlevel when I started I might have been\nway more judgmental and I would think\nthat someone that was behind bars\nespecially for a really lengthy or a\nserious crime that they probably were\nabsolutely guilty I had no compassion I\nwas just really judgmental\nand then when I started to hear about\nthese cases and people's backstories and\ntheir histories and realized that so\nmany people really didn't have the\nopportunities to be better and didn't\nknow better it really changed my whole\nlife and like my level of empathy is\njust so different than what it was years\nago and I think that's why I fight so\nhard for people to get Second Chances\nbecause\npeople make really bad choices and\nreally bad mistakes some way way worse\nthan other people but if you're never\ngiven the chance to change that's really\nsad especially if you make a really bad\ndecision as a teenager and then you're\nin your 40s and you're given no shot to\nchange when you really already maybe\nhave so much\nit was really important to me to express\nthat and help people that have made\nthose changes and I love how I'm I'm\nassuming that when you do something like\nthat in the outside space it kind of\napplies to your whole life where all of\na sudden you're so right that I think we\nall not even people behind bars I think\nwe all judge people all the time yeah\nand when you're almost doing it in such\nan extreme way and raising your empathy\nin such an extreme environment you can\nnow extend that and express that to so\nmany more people yeah because you've had\nto do it in a way where you were like oh\ndefinitely that person deserves it yeah\nand all of a sudden you start realizing\nmaybe they didn't deserve that yeah so\nmaybe we don't deserve this I think you\nknow but in all levels of Life of\njudgment I used to judge people and like\ntheir relationships and how people lived\ntheir lives and now I'm like whatever\nmakes you happy why should we judge who\nare we to say how people should live\ntheir lives my my judgment is just I\ndon't know if it comes with age or\nexperience or just going through so many\nthings but\njust be happy you know isn't that what\nlife is about\nexperiences making people feel heard and\nseen and appreciated and just having\ngratitude for the things in life that\nwe're so blessed to have and work for\nand for surrounded by the people we love\nwe are that's real success yeah you know\nI agree and and I feel that a lot of\npeople start getting better at that with\nthe Judgment outside but one of the\nthings that people struggle to deal with\nthe most is the Judgment in their head\nand I wonder do you find that you ever\ncatch yourself judging yourself and\nbeing hard on yourself and being heavy\nand harsh on yourself yeah you've been\nable to give that up I'll be like\ncompetitive with myself\nI think I'm a really competitive person\nbut I'm pretty I'm pretty easy on myself\nwow that's incredible I was always like\nreally calm really easy going that's a\nreal achievement yeah and I'm sure you\nsee people judging themselves all the\ntime yeah I was grabbing\nsome coffees for my team a couple of\nmonths back or something and uh I\nremember like I was paying the cashier\nand she gave me the change and I was\ngrabbing the change of walking off and\nshe was like wait wait I'm so stupid I'm\nso stupid I got the change wrong\nand I was like I didn't even notice and\nI looked and I was like oh okay like I\nwas like you're not stupid like easy\nmistaken you could see the look on her\nface like she was judging herself so\nharshly for something so small\nand I guess when you see people judge\nthemselves then how do you how do you\nrespond to that or how do you support\nthem\nhonestly I really haven't experienced\nthat much that's fantastic yeah that's\namazing and I love hearing that because\nI think it is so true that you can\ncurate and create a community around you\nthat has similar values yeah and then\nalmost you don't even I see a lot of\nlike determination and a lot of like\ncreativity a lot of hard work like if I\nwere to go on vacation with my\ngirlfriends we'd all be getting up\nprobably at six a.m all want to go on a\nworkout I don't think there's that one\ngirl that would be like I'm sleeping\ntill 10 and I'm not working out you know\nso I think that obviously everyone\naround you is different and has\ndifferent personalities but I think a\nlot of my core friends are really\nlike-minded yeah and sometimes that\npositive positive peer pressure can be\nreally healthy too like yeah even if you\nhave that one friend who's struggling as\nsoon as you're added to that group\ntotally you see the melody I've seen\nthat with so many of my friends that\ntotally even if there's one person who's\nstruggling with something as soon as\nthey're in that pack yeah all of a\nsudden you start to see them break\nthrough their ceiling yeah and and it\nchanges for them yeah I think something\nthat I've learned\nmaybe the Hard Way\nbecause I feel like I'm at a really good\nplace now where the people in my life I\nfeel really solid I think this is the\nfirst time in my life obviously I've had\nreally long relationships with my\ngirlfriends and friends since elementary\nschool but something I learned is that\nyou cannot help people that don't want\nthe help and don't\nyou can't force your beliefs and project\nthat on someone that thinks something\ntotally different and it's okay to have\nthose different views that's why the\nworld goes around you know but if you\ndon't align in the same values and\nmorals and things at your core then it's\nokay to realize that this life is so\nshort\nand you should go and find the people\nthat do a line\nwith what you really believe in\nand I think sometimes there's so much\ngoing on that you can be blinded by so\nmany other things\nthat if you don't stop and think about\nwhat someone's true values and morals\nare and how they want to live their life\nso much other things are going on so I\ndon't blame people that don't really\nstop and think about those things\nI mean those are some of the lessons\nthat I would teach my kids when they're\nlooking for friends and partners and\nrelationships yeah you can't really\nForce things upon other people you can't\nexpect them to be where you're at at\nyour level\nand sometimes that could really coexist\nreally well\nbut then sometimes it really can't you\nhave to let go of the idea of molding\npeople into what you want think about if\nthere's something about yourself that\nyou really want to change the\nexpectations of going into something and\nthinking you're going to get a different\nresult or thinking you have the power to\nchange someone is so\nselfish and so crazy and everyone does\nit\nand everyone has to learn on their own\nand that's something that I've always\nlike sat back helped friends given them\nadvice but never really pushed because\neven if I were to say hey\ndon't walk down that path trust me I've\nbeen there you don't want to go there\nand they say okay and they follow you\nand they go on a different path they'll\nnever learn that lesson\nthey have no clue what I'm talking about\nyou know I could say parenting stuff to\nyou all day long with all due respect\nyou have no clue until you've been\nthrough it I welcome people's Journeys\nand their lessons and I'll always be\nthere to the people that I love to help\nthem through that but they got to go\nthrough that in order to grow on their\nown what's the biggest lesson you\nlearned from your mom that you're trying\nto pass on to the kids I think just how\nshe makes people feel really heard and\nwelcomed she really is the most warm\nwelcoming person and it's just like her\noverall it seems superficial but it's\nnot like her party planning skills it's\nnot even that it's just the\nwelcomingness of I don't even know if\nthese are words I'm saying but like just\nher ability to be so warm and to make\neveryone feel like they were invited\nhere I'm gonna create this like special\nEaster dinner with like the things on\nthe table you know that she had when we\nwere growing up at my dad's house like\nshe just has all this like really\nspecial nostalgic stuff around all the\ntime and always tries to make everyone\nfeel so special but with like a\ngathering so that everyone feels\ncomfortable and can hang around like she\njust loves people in her space\nand loves to create these memories and I\nthink that we all got that from her and\nwe will all if I can just pass that on\nto my kids\njust the the experiences that we have as\na family whether we're just sitting in\nour pajamas and hanging out we make the\ntime to be together and I hope that my\nkids want to make the time to be\ntogether when they grow up with their\ncousins and their aunts and just the\nwhole family I'm sure they will yeah I\nthink they will too yeah I think I think\nyou've managed to hold on to it in your\nentire generation and so yeah they see\nthat I think kids mirror so much of yeah\nwhat they see around them and I remember\nwhen I met my wife her grandma is her\nfavorite human on the planet and it's\nreally interesting how when someone you\nlove you know who their favorite human\nis yeah you automatically start loving\nthem yeah and I wasn't really close to\nmy grandparents but I'm closer to\nRiley's Grandpa like Grandma and to my\nown grandparents because you see your\nlove for the person that you love and so\nI think when your kids see the love that\nyou have for your sisters and your\ncousins and your aunts and uncles now if\nonly all my kids can love their siblings\nthat would be amazing they're in a\nfighting phase yeah yeah did you and you\nguys went through that phase\nbut yeah it's still going on\nnever ending that's never going to stop\nKim I feel like you travel so much you\nhave so many businesses you're now going\nto be on a TV show like you another TV\nshow I mean you've got so much things\nhappening in your life and I'm sure\nthere's moments where whether the kids\nsay something or don't I know a lot of\npeople in my life feel a lot of mom\nguilt yeah and moms carry it with them\nhave you experienced that with your\nfriends your family absolutely mom guilt\nis probably the hardest thing I think\nthat you have to also separate though\nand understand that you need your own\nbit of Sanity so you have to do what\nmakes you happy you have to if working\nfor me I love working so that makes me\nhappy anytime I think something's really\nhard I dive into work and or if there's\nchallenges like I love to dive into my\nwork and that's like a bit of my therapy\nand my routine to keep me going but I\nthink you know I have chats with my\ngirlfriends when our kids are having\ntantrums and there could be things going\non that we don't even know about and you\nfeel like you're the worst mom if\nsomething's going on and you can't fix\nit you have no idea how to change it\nyour kids are fighting whatever it is\nand my friends and I will text each\nother and be like in tears literally\nlocking ourselves in the room like away\nfrom a kid having a tantrum when that's\nnot what you should do you should go and\nlean into them and but sometimes it's so\noverwhelming that was probably the only\ntime I'd be hard on myself is am I a\ngood mom\nI try to do everything and I think how\nto balance work with that is when you're\nhome being really present kids all they\nwant is time\nthey just want your time yeah you can\ngive them all these amazing big\nexperiences and they'll remember them\nand they're great but they'll always\nremember you being present and I think\nthat's just the most important thing in\nall of your relationships think about\nwhat a kid wants a kid just wants your\ntime so why wouldn't\neveryone else\nyou have to kind of treat everyone like\nthat if you want these like meaningful\nrelationships in your life and you have\nto be present and it's okay to feel like\nyou are not\n100 percent\nat\nbeing the best mom\nI say this all the time we there's no\nmanual they do not come with the manual\neveryone's doing the best that they can\nand I just feel so lucky that I have a\ngood group of girlfriends and all of our\nkids are experiencing different things\nfrom I mean imagine all the things that\nthey\na divorce everything that they have to\ngo through we're okay they will be okay\nand they will feel the love and support\nand that's all you can do it'll be okay\nand I'm sure that's hard for you because\nyou were saying that you're so\ncompetitive with yourself you want to be\nthe best at everything yeah but I feel\nlike being the best mom must be the\nhardest hardest thing to ever live up to\nabsolutely\nand I'm very confident so every year I\nwrite each one of my kids about a four\nor five Page Letter about on their\nbirthday about what the year was like\nwho their friends are silly words\nthey're saying their favorite foods all\nthe silly things that they do\nand a little journey of what the year is\nlike and it's so fun to see from the\nfirst year now you know\none of them almost 10 years old and just\nto I know that they'll appreciate this I\nknow that they'll\nappreciate everything that they might\nhave thought I was being a little harsh\non me protecting them I know that\nthey'll they'll get it because I got it\nwith my mom and I know they'll get it\nwith me you've reminded me of something\nbeautiful that I want to share that so\nmy mom and dad were both immigrants in\nLondon which is where I was born and\nraised and both my parents worked ever\nsince I was a kid and so I'd get dropped\nto daycare get picked up in the evening\nbut what I remember is something you\nsaid my mom would come and pick me up\nand I still remembered the look on her\nface when she'd pick me up she'd have\nthis big smile she'd give me the biggest\nhug she'd take me home and we'd sit down\ntogether while she was cooking and we'd\njust talk to each other and it's almost\nlike I never had a lot of time with my\nparents growing up but I felt so much\npresence and I honestly believe today\nthat I have so much love to give because\nmy mom infused me with love like my mom\njust like yeah you know bathed me in so\nmuch love totally that it's it's so easy\nfor me to be loving because I've always\nhad infinite amounts of it from my mom\nyeah I couldn't imagine I love on my\nkids so hard they are so annoyed with me\nand I love it what I find genuinely\ninspiring about you and the way you\nthink and focus is that you want to be\nthis incredible mom but you also want to\nshow the kids\nwhat a passionate Purpose Driven person\nlooks like yeah and I think we forget\nthat that's also parenting like I'm not\na parent but I can honestly say it that\nwhen I saw my mum working late at night\nand waking up early in the morning I\nlook back at my mom and I think my mom\nis a superwoman yeah and I look back at\nthat as Instagram my kids think that of\nme one day they will they will because\nthey'll see that and I think same with\nmy dad like I saw my dad and how much he\nhad to work on yeah and and there was\nsomething powerful about that I think I\nalways like to show them like I drop my\nkids off at school and then I have two\nor three hours of law school so I gotta\ngo I'm on time because\nI have my school and they have been on\nthe journey with me they saw me take the\nbar exam they saw me open my results and\nnot pass\nmultiple times they saw me open up the\nresults and pass and I was crying and\nthey felt my hard work and it paid off\nI want to show them that finding a\npassion and working to me is something I\nlove to do and there's so much joy in\nthat for me and I want them to feel that\npositive experience and I I encourage\nthat from them like I want to just show\nthem as many positive experiences as I\ncan and show them that\nyou know you can work hard and you can\nlove it and I just try to live my life\nand be a good example for them I think\nit comes through and and I do believe\nthat like when I look back at my parents\nall I can do is appreciate my mom that's\nall I can do I hope they do sometimes\nthey tell me I'm the meanest mom in the\nworld because I won't buy them Roblox\nevery day you know it's like I'm like\nit's okay I can be the meanest mom in\nthe world yeah you know well I think\nthat's what moms do mom's willing to be\nanything their kids need them to be even\nif it's that for a short period of time\nyeah Kim you've been so uh gracious and\nkind with your time today we end every\non-purpose episode with a final five the\nfirst question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever received or had\nsomething that I've learned about time\nis just that we never have enough of\ntime\nso really be present and make the most\nof your relationships\nbecause we're not here very long and we\nhave one life\nwas there a moment that made you realize\nthat or something that happened that\nmade you realize that I mean I think\nwhen you lose a parent you're always\nreally mindful of time and my mom talks\nabout it all the time I think she's like\nprobably the one thing in life she's\nscared about you know and and keeps her\nup at night sometimes\nso just making sure that you make the\nmost of everything\nbecause it'll go by so fast\nsecond question what is the worst life\nadvice you've ever received or had\nI think maybe the worst advice\ncould be almost too much advice or too\nmany opinions\nif you really trust your gut and you do\nwhat you want to do and if you're in\nyour bubble and when the world gets to\nthat little piece of your bubble and\nthere can be so many opinions I think\nsometimes all of the conflicting advice\ncan just be bad advice that even if\nyou're supposed to make your mistake and\nmaybe do what you want to do with any\nbad piece of advice that's still a part\nof your journey\nso sometimes just do what you want to do\nand not take in all of the advice is\nreally healthy I think that's great and\ndon't ask for in the first place yeah\nyeah I know we all have that one friend\nwho told us messages like 25 people with\nthe same question totally yeah\ndefinitely good answer all right uh\nquestion number three if tomorrow not\nwishing this no intentions no energy\ntowards this but if if tomorrow you had\nto restart\nwhat would you do if tomorrow everything\nwent away and you had to restart what\nwould you do business-wise like how\nwould that shift I think I would\nprobably be a lawyer and just focus on\nthat and go to law school and focus on\nbeing an attorney full-time because I\njust think the feeling of being able to\nhelp people is really powerful\nand necessary and I would just focus on\nthat that's such a heartfelt answer I\nlove that that's beautiful I'm glad I'm\nglad I asked you I was like yeah I just\nfeel like it's really interesting I was\nhaving a conversation last night with a\nmutual friends of us uh School abroad\nand oh yeah we were together last night\nand we were talking about this idea\nabout how we often think that our\nexperiences\nmake us who we are or is it that you are\njust going to be who you are anyway\nbecause that's who you were meant to be\nI think it's both yeah think about it\nyou can be the most talented person but\nif you don't have that determination and\ndrive then what will become of it you\nknow it's not just gonna magically\nhappen because you're talented of course\nso I think so much of it is the effort\nand what you do with that and figuring\nthat out and who you are and what you\nwant to put out in the world I guess my\npoint is that I think you have that\nenergy of wanting to be the best of\nwanting to do things really well of\nwanting to do things with that quality\nand whatever you ended up doing with it\nyeah it would have been that and it is\nthat already and you're doing that\nanyway you have to no matter even if\nthis isn't the job that you want no\nmatter what it is that you're doing you\nhave to be fully your best you have to\nput in 200 you have no idea who's paying\nattention you're at that place exactly\nwhere you're supposed to be at that time\nthere's nothing worse than someone that\ndoesn't want to give it their all no\nmatter what it is and it could be that's\nlike you know business advice that I\nheard that always stuck with me and\nalways was even when I was working at a\nclothing store\nI was so happy to be there I did my yeah\nI did my absolute best that I could\nselling everything and steaming\neverything and hanging everything and I\nthink those experiences just show you\nwhat you want to do in your life\nshow other people really What You're\nMade Of I'm just like a I'm a really\ncompetitive person so no matter what it\nis that I'm doing I want to be the best\nat that I want to learn everything about\nit and I'm just a super curious person\nbeautiful uh question number four since\nwe've been talking about values what's\nsomething that you used to value that\nyou no longer feel your value anymore\ndefinitely material designer things\nI used to Value I mean\nstuff\nI live in an area where there would be\nfires a lot and there was probably four\ntimes we had to fully pack up the house\neverything out houses catching on fire\nproperty caught on fire like really\nclose to losing everything first time\npacked up my entire shoe and bag closet\nand a lot of them because they were\nmemory stuff from my dad stuff in high\nschool but all designer stuff also\nvideos photos whatever digitized\neverything put everything important\nsomewhere else here\nsecond pack up\nthe designer stuff but leave some leave\nsome of the clothes you know I don't\nreally need all the clothes but I packed\na hotel for months bags about every\ndesigner thing that I had had to come\nthird time leave all the bags and shoes\nI don't I don't need them we got all the\nwe got all the photos we got all the my\nlittle blankie when I was little you\nknow the kids stuff fourth time leave\neverything me and my babies that's all I\nneed you know I have all my photos\ndigitized I have everything digital\nwe got our passports we're good\nyeah and that like evolution of like\nthey had to go in and get all my\ndesigner stuff or I'm not leaving my\nhouse you know it's gonna catch on fire\nyeah and now I'm like\nnothing is worth it nothing is important\nand I think that comes from Life\nExperiences\nscary experiences things shaking you to\nyour core to make you realize that\nnothing is important you can't I know\neveryone says this but like you can't\ntake it with you none of it is important\nyeah there's a beautiful Islamic proverb\nthat says Detachment doesn't mean that\nyou owe nothing it means that nothing\nowns you and I feel so often we become\nowned by I love that dreams our desires\nour Pursuits our things yeah it doesn't\nmean that we have to give them all away\nor we don't have those things it's just\nif and when we have to let go totally\nare we willing are we able to let\ntotally even with work stuff I mean it\ndoesn't just have to be the material\nthings like you said like your dreams\nand it's okay to be able to let go but\nwork so hard to like the Opposites are\nokay contradicting yourself a little bit\nin those ways yeah you know it's like in\nin relationships you can love a person\nmiss a person so much but still have the\nwisdom to know they're not your person\nand you're better off not together\nthat like opposite connection with\neverything I think is really important\nto have that awareness\nin everything in life relationships\nmaterial things\nall of that yeah I I\nofficiate a wedding a few years ago and\nsomeone came up to me\nfrom the audience and\nand said to me\nJay I realized from what you were saying\nthat they'd just gone through a breakup\nrecently and they were saying Jay I\nrealized that I love that person but we\ndidn't like each other anymore and it\nwas that essence of like they'll always\nbe that deep love for each other yeah\nbut we just don't like family you know\nlike you love people and\nbut it's okay to to feel a protection of\na person but then also protecting\nyourself and realizing when you have to\nand when it's time and it's okay to feel\nall of the opposite emotions you know I\nthink as long as you're really well\naware and go through the motions and\nfeel things and don't hold things in\nit's so important whether it's you know\nbreakups deaths I've always been a\nreally clear-headed\nand like gone through the feelings gone\nthrough the emotions more in those\nrelationships more in those lifelong\nrelationships that you hope for\nand then also be okay and calm and\nrealizing I've always been someone like\nokay\nmy dad died what why is this happening\nwhat was his purpose here and how are we\ngoing to grow and learn from this\nexperience\nand I always said that like right when\nhe passed and I was felt it and super\nemotional about it and you know cry all\nthe time when great things happen that I\nwish she was here but also\nI had a wisdom at like a younger age to\nunderstand that this is like a part of\nour journey and a part of our like\nEvolution and this happens and this is\nwhy you have to hold on to relationships\neven more precious\nbut\ndon't let things destroy you at the same\ntime\nif that makes sense yeah it does make\nsense I can tell just from your energy\nlike I just want everyone to know who's\nlistening and watching often people can\nsay something but\nthe time I've spent with you even today\nI can tell from your energy that you are\ncontent and you are at peace and you are\nI can feel that just don't worry just be\nat peace like that's what I'm with you I\nI sense peace and I think doing an\ninterview with someone just it's a\ndifferent environment that you I\nremember when I interviewed Kobe Bryant\nand I almost felt like time Stood Still\nand his word that I saw with his energy\nwas gravity like it just felt like\neverything was just and then when I'm\nsitting with you I'm feeling peace and a\nlot of the time people try to find\npeople when they're not at peace hoping\nthat someone else will put their pieces\nback together you are at peace do you\never feel like you want to be in love\nagain do you do you long for that or or\nare you so at peace that that isn't a\nconsideration I think I'll always be a\nhopeless romantic and always want to be\nin love\nand\ndefinitely love sharing my life with\nsomeone and love creating a life with\nsomeone\nI definitely
