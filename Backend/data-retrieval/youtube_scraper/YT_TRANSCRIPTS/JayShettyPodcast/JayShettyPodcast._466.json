    "transcript": "if success is this lagging indicator of\ncommitment now how can you be sure that\nyou are paying your dues the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nSociety has gone in the direction of\nbecoming addicted to pleasure yes or\npleasure seeking\nwhere\nfrom the stoics perspective\nwhy did we even ever go down that road\nlike why did we leave wisdom and\nself-control or did we never have it at\nall and we've always been trying to\nbalance it yeah I mean I guess that's\nthe big question is like why do we take\nsomething that we like too far yeah\nright so the epicureans would say like\nlook drinking is great but if you have a\nhangover the next day was it actually so\ngreat and so you know if you if you push\nthe or the pleasure too far it becomes\nnot pleasurable but in the moment that\nfeels very far away right like in the\nmoment you want the thing now obviously\nsex is this thing for people it's like\nthe thing you're attracted to In This\nMoment you're not thinking about the\nshame or the regret or the consequences\nor the pain or the loss or the gr you're\nnot thinking of all those things you're\njust thinking of right now so I think a\nbig part of this this where the wisdom\ncomes in the ability to step back and go\nwhat am I going to think about this\nafter I get it what am I going to think\nabout this later and realizing that your\nmind is very good at tricking you just\nas your mind often tells you like stop\nyou're too tired you can't go any\nfurther you actually have a lot less\nleft in the tank\nyour mind also tells you you need this\nthing you won't regret it it's amazing\nyou know whatever yeah and it's it's\nreally good at putting those blinders on\nand so part of I think any meditative\npractice in a philosophical practice any\njournaling practice\nis is being able to argue with yourself\na little bit to step back and have that\nconversation about well is what I think\nabout this true is the story I'm telling\nmyself about this true I think nowhere\nis this more important than for like\nambitious people who have told\nthemselves I will be happy when I\naccomplish X right like of all the\nthings we need to be most disciplined\nabout ambition is one of them because it\ntells you this live after I become a New\nYork Times the seller after I make a\nmillion dollars after I get a gold medal\nthen I'll be good my parents will be\nproud of me I'll be happy then I can\nrelax and you have to have the\nperspective the wisdom to go was that\never been true ever in my life before\nhas that ever been true in history yeah\nand then go oh okay no I can't tell\nmyself that lie that doesn't mean you\ndon't work really hard to do stuff but\nyou're not doing it under the false\npretenses that it's going to\nbe conditional to your happiness yeah\nbut there's a part of us that and I and\nI love what you're saying but there's a\npart of us that always believes that we\nare the exception that we will know how\nto spend money better yeah that we'll\nknow how to have love in our life better\nlike we won't be the one who fumbles off\nthe edge of a cliff like we're smarter\nthan all our friends even if we don't\nsay that we're wiser than the people who\ncame before us and that's the and that's\nego is the enemy but of course like that\nthat idea I think is what misleads us so\nmuch yes yeah it's it's like okay you're\non the metal stand you've just won the\ngold medal and you're not feeling happy\nfor yourself you're thinking well I\ncould have done it faster you're\nthinking oh I got to do it again right\neven in that moment you're not able to\nthink I'm doing it to myself right now\nwhat I will be doing to myself in the\nfuture and that's this sort of Insidious\nthing and you can understand why from an\nevolutionary perspective it drives the\nspecies forward you can also see the\nimmense personal cost that it inflicts\non us because it never allows us to be\npresent or content or happy with what we\nhave in that moment and so I think again\npeople think discipline is the I always\npush myself to do better do more\ndiscipline can also be curbing that very\nimpulse right like\nand Ordinary People when we're talking\nabout discipline what we're talking\nabout is getting off your butt working\nout resisting eating candy and needing\nnutritious food instead it's you know\nmanaging your screen time but I think\nfor a lot of more disciplined people or\nfor people who have tasted the rewards\nof discipline you have to learn how to\nbe disciplined about discipline which is\nmaybe the highest level of\nof the whole thing yeah yeah exactly now\nwe're I guess now we've started talking\nabout discipline as a tool to achieve\ndaily or weekly monthly early tasks but\nyou're actually saying that\nwe need to go back a bit like how would\nyou unpack that for how you're defining\ndiscipline there well it's it's like uh\nwhat's the number one cause of injury\nfor athletes it's over training right so\nlike yeah your ordinary person it's like\nyou're not training enough you're not\nworking hard enough yeah but then at a\nmore Elite level at a more accomplished\nlevel actually the trouble is hey the\nthe racism for six weeks like you do you\nwant to Peak now or do you want to peek\nat the right moment right\num or this is just a practice session\nyou don't have to go all out or you know\nit's a long season are you prepared for\nthat and so you know discipline has to\nbe balanced with sustainability with\nrest relaxation recuperation recovery\nall these other things and that requires\nkind of a spiritual discipline on not\njust hey I can run an hour without\ngetting tired but like can I stop myself\nfrom doing that that's not what I should\nbe doing in this moment yeah and and\nwhat I like about that is that I feel\nthere's different phases and stages like\nin the first two years of my career\nwhere we would have met New York and we\nwent on a walk once as well I think and\nwe were walking around the city and I\nremember talking about a few of these\nthemes but it was at that time in my\nlife I was working probably 18-hour days\nsure because I I had to in order to kind\nof break through that first level yeah I\nwas still disciplined in the sense that\nI would make time to eat to some degree\nand and meditate and I would make some\ntime to do a few things of rest but\ngenerally I was working seven days a\nweek 18 hours a day and I'm very\ngrateful I did that I don't look back\nand go oh I wasted two years it was\nbrilliant\nbut then in the last couple of years\nI've taken my evenings back and so I\ndon't work after 6 p.m it's just a rule\nI don't want to work I don't want to be\non the phone and I'm talking to a friend\nand it's exactly what you said he was\nsaying to me he was just like well don't\nyou get less done and I was like no I\nget more done sure because I know how\nmuch I have to get done I'm far more\nattentive and focused and then I'm not\nworking at 9pm when I can rest and\nrecuperate and now the next day I'm I'm\nbetter for it and so I I hear that idea\nthat that is also a discipline yes all\nthat could be seen as you're being lazy\nin the evening and I think it's the\nquestion of well is it easy for you to\ndo that yes or no right it's hard it's\nactually harder for you I imagine to say\nI'm stopping at six yeah than it is to\nsay I'm gonna work all night till I fall\nasleep at my desk right like yeah I\ncould do that yeah if my wife's not\naround I could work every weekend and\nevening and also it's realizing that you\nhave multiple things that you're trying\nto do simultaneously so yeah sure\nworking continuing to work 18 hour days\nmay help you continue to advance in your\ncareer but if one of the also the other\nthings you're trying to work on is to\nstay married or to period have a happy\nmarriage uh or if children or you have\nyour health or whatever like you you\nwere telling me before we recorded that\nyou're like you got in at 3am last night\nlet's say you're a person who always\nwakes up very early like I'm a person\nwho wakes up early yes but then I also\nhave to understand that sleep is a\ndiscipline and so if some changes\noutside my control mean that I didn't go\nto bed to a certain time the fact that I\nwake up at five that's a bad idea and it\nactually requires it you wouldn't think\nthat sleep discipline would be a thing\nbut in the military they talk about that\nsleep discipline you got to get your\nhours because you make bad decisions\nwhen you're not rested and other people\nbear the consequences of those decisions\nand so deciding hey\nI'm going to skip this thing that feels\ncomfortable to me to do that feels\nnatural for me to do that I feel like\nI'm letting some part of myself down by\nnot doing I actually have to be the\nbigger more self-controlled person and\nsay in this moment I'm not going to do\nthat right and and I think at the end of\nthe day self-discipline is the ability\nto have an emotion an instant a feeling\nto do a thing and then to catch yourself\nand go is that actually the right thing\nto do yes or no and sometimes it is\nsometimes it's hey it's cold outside and\nit's 5 a.m and it's still dark and I\ndon't want to get up but I have to get\nup because I've made these commitments\nI'm behind blah blah blah and other\ntimes it is to stay in bed right just\nlike you know sometimes you feel that\nsurge of temper coming on and you have\nto go no that's not a good like it's\nalways the ability to step back put the\nemotion the Instinct the opinion to the\ntest and I think you learn this in\nmeditation I think you learn this for\nstoicism in the journaling of going like\nhere's the thing and I can choose it or\nnot I can choose to identify it or not\nit is not me the Stokes have this word\nAscent right not like Ascent up a\nmountain but\na-s-s-e-n-t do you ascend to the feeling\nor not do you agree to it rubber stamp\nit approve it go along with it or not do\nsubscribe yeah yeah that's what\ndiscipline is is about what do you\nassent to and what you not Ascend it to\nyeah I I wonder I want to go to\npotential I want to come back to that\nbecause I actually really like that\npoint but a few words ago there was\nsomething that you sparked for me\nsometimes I feel like with work it's\ndoable sometimes with even a partner\nwith friends it's possible to say no to\nbe disciplined I find like and I want to\nask you this from your perspective what\nabout a sense of dad guilt like we talk\na lot about Mom Gill and and you know if\nit was speaking to Mom I'd ask about Mom\nguilt in this scenario but from a dad\nguilt point of view like you're a dad I\nI you know and I I see you wanting to be\na good dad and and you're very involved\nwith your kids but at the same time\nyou're a writer and you're in a\nbookstore and you're doing activists\nlike there's so many things that you do\ndo you ever feel like that's like the\nhardest place where discipline because\nit's like even if a dad comes home at\n3am yeah and the kid wants him at 4am\nlike does the dad stay up like what does\nthat do how does it work well it's so\nInsidious what we do is we go like I'm\ndoing this for my family right and it's\nlike are you or are you doing it for you\nare you doing it for the money how can\nyou be doing it for your family if you\ndon't see those people as a result of\nwhat you're doing someone told me many\nyears ago they said love is spelled\nt-i-m-e and\nI think about that all the time I mean\nobviously I always have things that take\nme away more than I would like them to\nbe and I suppose I could do nothing but\nthat would also leave me unfulfilled\nthat would not be me setting the example\nI want to set for my kids but at the end\nof the day realizing that everything I\nsaid yes to also means saying no to\nsomeone or something else\nand in some ways I try to use that Dad\ngo a little constructively I try to go\nokay this person's asking me to do this\nthing or this person's offering me money\nto do this thing like this is some cool\nopportunity they want me to go hella\nskiing in British Columbia or something\nand I go I'm I don't want to say no to\nthis cool opportunity I don't want to\nmiss this memory I don't want to hurt\nthis person's feelings then I go but I\nam hurting a person's feelings I am\nsaying no to a memory like I am taking\nsomething away from someone and that\nperson is a five-year-old and they're\ngonna feel it far more deeply someone\nelse will take my spot on that plane to\nBritish Columbia no one will spend that\ntime with my kids and so I try to use\nthat guilt constructively in the sense\nthat I'm I'm reminding myself always\nthat saying yes to one thing means\nsaying no to something else and that\nconversely saying no means saying yes\nright and then I always as much as I can\nI want to be saying yes to the things\nthat actually matter to me and I want to\nbe putting my money where my mouth is\nit's like if if someone looked at your\naccount you say you put your family\nfirst you say family is important blah\nblah but then if I looked at your\ncalendar what would it show right if\nthere was a custody hearing or you know\nif you were being investigated if you\nwere being audited what would the\nreceipts show do you actually value them\ndo you put them first and like it should\nbe pretty pretty obvious whether that's\ntrue or not yeah no I I have an exercise\nin Think Like a monk where I ask people\nto do their time audit for the week and\nit's literally that at where it's like\nand it's against your values because\nsomeone's values may be different but\nthe idea that your bank statement and\nyour schedule show your values more than\nwhat you say yes right the words that\ncome out of our mouth are not actually\nour values there are aspirations yeah\nthose are the values you wish you had\nbut the values that actually go what do\nyou spend your money on and what do you\nspend your time on like that's far more\nwhat your real values are yeah I think\nabout that I saw this interview with\nJimmy Carter many years ago and he he\nhas this sort of crisis of faith and he\ngoes like if I was put on trial for\nbeing a Christian would I be convicted\nright so it's not what you say not what\nyou think not what you wish but like\nwhat are the action show and I think\nabout that with Mark surrealis who I\nwrite a lot about the The Stoke Emperor\nlike he never identifies explicitly as a\nstoic and one of his translators says\nyou know\nhe never even says the word stoicism\nlike in his writings but he's considered\nthis philosopher Emperor and he probably\nstill would have been even if his\nwritings had never survived because the\nDeeds are there there's a Latin\nexpression ACTA non-verbal like Deeds\nnot words and so you have to always\nthink not what do I write about what do\nI think about what do I want to be true\nbut what are the action show and no one\nis perfect and I think anyone auditing\nthemselves uh is going to be there's\ngoing to be some disappointments but you\nwant like the big\nstatements of priority to be there and\nto go back to the idea of guilt when\nyou're looking at it you shouldn't like\nwhip yourself and feel but you should be\nlike okay this is not the pain in the\npicture that I want to paint and that\nyou're lucky enough in that moment to\ncatch it now not when you're 80 you know\nnot under death bed you're you're you've\ncaught it now and so what changes are\nyou going to make yeah to to get closer\nbetween the ideal and the reality yeah\nyeah absolutely and and something that's\ninteresting that's coming out for me\nhere is that pretty much everything we\ndo every day can be defined by thinking\nfeeling undoing but I think we're living\nat a time where we're stuck in the\nfeeling generation so we do things\nbecause we want to feel a certain way\nbut then when we feel things we don't\nknow what to do with it so I'll give an\nexample of what I mean by that if you if\nwe feel guilt most of us don't know how\nto shift from that feeling into thinking\nand doing something different in order\nto not feel that guilt again yes and if\nwe want to feel happy we just try and\nfeel happy not realizing that you have\nto change your thoughts and what you do\nin order to feel happiness or whatever\nit may be what I'm trying to get at\nthere is like that to me sounds like a\ndiscipline too like but we've gone so\ninto feeling because I think for so long\nthinking and doing what the only thing\nis talked about and we didn't feel\nenough I think realizing that almost all\nthe things you want in life are\naccidental byproducts of habits\nprocesses systems routines right so\nVictor Frankel famously said that\nhappiness can't be pursued it must ensue\nit's the result of getting those big\nthings right and then you just feel this\nkind of feeling of Happiness as a\nbyproduct you don't as you said you\ndon't go today I must feel happy right\nit's it's the result of having meaning\nand purpose and and taking the right\nactions and so people sometimes look at\nthe books that I've written and they're\nlike what like how did you publish so\nmany books and I like publishing is not\nwhat I think about I think about writing\nI wake up every day and write and The\nAccidental byproduct of that is the\npublishing right and so good habits good\nroutines like if you want a happier home\nlife it's like are you spending more\ntime there you know how are you setting\nup systems or processes that the result\nis that outcome right you control what\nyou put in the outcome happens or it\ndoesn't happen and I think so often we\nwe just you're right we just want the\nfeeling so we try to cheat it or steal\nit or we feel guilty that we don't have\nit when really you could start small\nright now and and just get yourself\ncloser to it what do you think is the\nbest discipline you've built like over\ntime like is it writing obviously that\nwould be the obvious one but is there\nanother one that you think underpins\nthat success is there a discipline\nyou've worked on the longest well I\nthink writing is such a sedentary sort\nof uh intellectual cerebral thing that I\ntry to balance out with like a physical\npractice so I try to do something hard\nevery single day running swimming biking\nI do a walk once a day like I do\nsomething hard every day and part of\nwhat that is is transferable back to the\npractice right because again it comes\ndown to the you don't want to do it it's\nhard it's not going the way you want it\nbut you've cultivated the muscle of\nbeing able to push through that like\nthere's lots of claims about the health\nbenefits of cold plunges and they may or\nmay not exist that's not why I do it\nright the muscle for me is is the\ncranking of the knob of the looking at\nthe coal punch at my house and going it\nis going to be unpleasant to get in\nthere but I I have the ability to force\nmyself to do that that's the muscle that\nyou want to cultivate yeah\num and I I think you know people want to\nbe the person on the other side of that\nbut they don't realize that the way you\ndo it is by just starting it just\nstarting it yeah it's so true I\nI I can relate to so much of that in my\nown life and when you're saying that\nit's I feel like today most of what I do\nI'd say I spend a lot I'd say I spend\nlike 75 of my life outside of my comfort\nzone I am constantly doing things that\ndemand more from me than I believe I'm\nskilled and able to accomplish yeah yeah\nand in a healthy way in a good sense\nbecause I feel challenged and I feel\nthat challenge forces me to grow my\nskills which then meet a new challenge\nand then that keeps growing but then I\nfind myself in my personal life often\nresorting to comfort uh because I need\nto kind of cushion the amount of like\nsure sure and stress and so it's like\nthis for me I'm at that that place in my\nlife where I'm like okay I'm pushing so\nmuch and in my personal life to be super\nlike you know Christian to some degree\nit is interesting right we will take and\nSeneca points us out on one of his\nletters we'll push ourselves we'll take\nrisks uh to to succeed financially to\nsucceed in business to succeed in our\ncareers to buttress our rep meditations\nbut then we don't want to do it in the\nother places where most of us would\nadmit it actually matters right my\nfavorite passages in meditations Mark\nzurios is like a better wrestler but not\na better forgiver of fall it's a better\nfriend in tight places he's pointing out\nhow we'll go like yeah I'm trying like\nyou'll talk to someone to have this well\nlaid out plan for how they're trying to\nincrease their back squad or their mild\ntime or how they're trying to to they've\ngot they've they've got these aggressive\ngoals for their stock price or or you\nknow how many copies they want to sell\nthis thing or they have we have really\nclear Financial and Professional goals\nand then in our personal life we just\nwing it yeah and I'm not saying yeah I\ndidn't mean that but I know what you\nmean yeah I have that point and I think\nthe point is like you have to be\nchallenging yourself\nin your personal life also getting\nvulnerable you know getting outside your\ncomfort zone having the conversations\nthat you like I think it's because our\nprofessional stuff is so much more\nquantifiable and then there's other\npeople are looking at it whereas the\nother stuff is private and so we we just\nwe hold ourselves to different standards\nand you think about what that costs us\nin terms of a place you get to in your\nmarriage in 10 years that had you\nthought more consciously about or put\none tenth of the focus on maybe you\ncould have got there in one year and\nthen had nine years of enjoying it yeah\nno that I fully agree with and maybe I\ndidn't clarify when I said Comfort I\nmean more apart from like my sleep\nschedule I have so many routines that\nare already set up that I try and make\nmy personal life more comfortable\nbecause as in my individual life of my\nown self-care because I find I'm pushing\nmyself in so many areas but I love where\nyou took it to because I think that's\nthe critical one right it's like well\nyou're kind of leaning towards is most\npeople will become people they don't\nwant to be in order to achieve something\nand that external Pursuit often does\nthat by the end of building a billion\ndollar company or whatever it may be you\nend up going well I don't even like the\nperson I am anymore or I've lost the\nperson who I thought I was whereas the\npursuit of doing it inwardly with your\nfamily with your friendships the the\nopenness that's required chances are\nyou'll become the person you want to be\nlike chances are you'll become someone\nthat you're proud of being and I think\nthat's such I want to dive into that\nthat is such a powerful way of looking\nat it and you're saying it's because\nit's the quantifiability which which I\nthink there's truth in I also think it's\nthe uh\nit's harder it's harder because like\nyou're saying there's no external reward\nthere's no number that proves you did it\nand it's fluctuating way more because\npeople's emotions like anyone in your\nfamily and friends you can't control it\nyou could you can control or Master an\nalgorithm or the stock market to some\ndegree but with a person you can't do\nany of that because you can't set\nsomething up and then be like you're\ngonna stay this way well it's like you\nget so used to the control and the power\nthat you have from the Mastery of your\nprofessional domain right like when I\nsit down to write I'm in control I'm\ncomfortable this is a place that I have\ncarved out for myself\nwhen I am arguing with my wife or I am\ndealing with a three-year-old who's\nhaving a meltdown I'm not in control and\nI'm humbled by it and I'm struggling\nwith it and I don't feel like I've got\nit because I have so much less I've\nliterally never done that before and\nI'll and I'll have such a short window\nwhere I'll ever have to do it right it's\nnot it's not like oh I've been to this\nplace in a book 12 times right like I've\nonly had one five-year-old yeah and so\nyou know it's just so much more\nchallenging it's just a much more\nmulti-dimensional you know n of one like\ndifficult thing and so it it's going to\ndemand more of you and I think I think\nit's like look optimizing your\nprofessional life or maximizing your\nprofessional life very unlikely to\nimprove your personal life but if you\nhave optimized and maximized and\nimproved your personal life got in your\nhouse in order you're gonna be better at\nwhat you do what you're going to care\nless in some degrees about things that\nused to bother you so much and so which\none are you going to focus on right\nbecause you can get you can be a Titan\nin your industry and then be a total\namateur at home right and I think I'm\ngonna go where it's easy and that's and\nthat's the thing I think discipline\noften gets applied to the Titan in the\nindustry not the amateur at home yeah\nand that's how we think about discipline\nwe think about discipline is what can I\nachieve through this yeah in in an\nexternal sense yeah at least today\nthat's the language and you can get away\nwith so much more if you're really\ntalented you know you can be a jerk\nright you can demand a lot of people\nbecause you're paying these people right\nlike not saying you should I'm just\nsaying that there's accommodations that\nare made for you and and sort of\ninsidiously the more successful you are\nthe more needed you are the more\naccommodations you are\nbut there's none of that in the other\narea and so you have to there's some\nhumility required right you you're\nmeeting equals on an equal playing field\nand the discipline to say yeah I'm I'm\ngonna wrestle with that I'm going to try\nto get better I'm I'm not gonna allow\nmyself to to do these following bad\nhabits that that takes a a certain\namount of self-control and focus and\ndiscipline yeah I guess I guess one of\nthe biggest challenges with discipline\nis that we're trying to destroy a habit\nthat we hate like there's this idea that\nit just has to break and go right if you\nhave a habit that you don't like about\nyourself whatever that may be it's like\nyou're just well at least I found when\nI'm coaching clients or working with\npeople is that they have this\nlike bitter feeling towards this thing\nthat they have yeah and they want it to\ngo at all costs but that almost makes\nyou hold on to it harder like that makes\nyou grip onto it sure and wrestle with\nit more and I remember when when I lived\nin India a lot of the time the analogy\nthat was given or the metaphor that was\ngiven to to meditate on because we'd see\nall the time was like snake skin and the\nidea was that when snakes shed their\nskin they just Slither out they don't it\ndoesn't like they don't one they just go\nI mean they don't even have it's not\nlike a hole yeah yeah they're not like\nthe Hulk where it's like like snakes\njust Slither out and then their skin\ngets left behind and then it you know\nthey'll grow more and so the idea that\nit's it's such a natural organic process\nof if you just slid there if you just\nmove forward you naturally shed\num yeah that's the beauty of process\nright you don't sit down anymore I have\nto do this right now what do I have to\ndo today what are the small steps and\nand you get great by minor improvements\ncompounded on top of each other day in\nand day showing up day in and day out\nand that's the same hey we were fighting\nlike crazy six months ago and now things\nare awesome why is that they made a\nchange and you made a change and you\nmade a response and it changed in\nresponse to their change and it\ncompounded and now you're here that work\ncan fall away at any moment you have to\nrebuild it but I think you know the\nBuddhists talk about willful will like\nalmost the more intentional you are\nabout that's the irony too as we're\ntalking about how you know being\nintentional in your professional life\noften pays off being intentional having\nclear expectations wants desires in your\npersonal life is harder because it\ndepends on other people uh people who\nare not like you people who did not sign\nup for that and I think one of the\nthings you learn having kids and then\nalso being married is that like Ascent\nin that same sense of like acquiescing\nto things adjusting to things like I'm a\nroutine person kids don't care about\nyour routine they fall asleep when they\nfell asleep and you have to you have to\nadjust like you're no longer the center\nof the universe yeah and that is such an\nimportant thing that you have to figure\nout and adjust and accommodate towards\nyou're the master of the universe here\nbut that you leave that behind when you\nwalk through the front door yeah\nabsolutely I was talking to a a ma from\nyes Theory I don't know if you know the\nguys at yes Theory yeah they're awesome\nand we've had them on the show before\nbut Ahmad the other day and they just\nreleased their um project Iceman I think\ntheir documentary first time like the\nfeature documentary but he was talking\nabout this and he was saying that when\nthey built yes Theory the goal was like\nhow can we say yes to things we would\nusually say no to right like that was\nthe obvious point and now he's learned\nthat it's equally important to say no\nbut the part that really hit me when he\nwas explaining it I think we'd we both\nVibe with the idea he was saying that\nand it's something you said earlier he\nsaid\nhave to start saying yes to the things I\nfind hardest and so he was saying that\ntoday no matter how many marathons he's\ndone no matter how many crazy\nExpeditions they've gone on no matter\nhow many countries they survive with no\nmoney he said the hardest thing for him\nto do is sit with his thoughts for 15\nminutes yeah and he was like that's the\nhardest thing he goes I don't look\nforward to doing that he said if someone\ntold me to train for something he goes I\nlook forward to that but if someone told\nme to sit down with my thoughts for 15\nminutes because I don't look forward to\nit so that's what I'm doing and he was\nsaying that's why he's trying to build\nthat and he was like that's his new\ndefinition of seeking discomfort because\nhe said when people come into and say Do\nyou want to build like a million dollar\ncompany a billion dollar he's like I can\nget excited about that but he goes I\ndon't get excited about it is that a\ngood sense of people finding what\ndiscipline is for them or how do you see\nthat and I think restraint is the\nhardest thing right uh please Pascal in\nthe 1500s said all of Humanity's\nproblems stem from her inability to sit\nquietly in a room alone it was hard 500\nyears ago it's harder now when you have\na cell phone in your pocket when you\ncould get on a flight and travel\nanywhere you want in the world and\nthere's unlimited distractions\nopportunities things to get excited\nabout like it's hard to hold the Mind\nstill to be physically still or or maybe\nnot to be physically still but have the\nMind still while the body is in motion\nthis requires like so much discipline so\nmuch uh self-control so much\nself-awareness right even to to\nunderstand that it's hard for you that\nit's something that you uh are naturally\naverse to or avoid is a step in that\njourney to getting better at it because\na lot of people are just doing doing\ndoing and they're not even aware they're\nrunning away from something they're not\neven aware that it makes them\nuncomfortable to be still so I think we\nhave to understand it's this journey and\nhopefully as you go you get more and\nmore comfortable because at the end of\nthe day that's that's the one constant\nin life wherever you go there you are\nthere you are as the expression goes\nlike you're there and if you can't get\ncomfortable with that can't get in touch\nwith that you can't see what's there\nand you're gonna wake up one day and\nrealize\nI did all of this stuff to get away from\nsomething that's been inside me the\nwhole time\nand that's very very sad that is that's\na yeah that's\nwell that's that's the Inconvenient\nTruth of it right like that's the hard\npart that you chased pleasure for so\nlong that you completely missed what was\nit what was already there but I I think\nis it that we don't what is your take\nfrom studying you're like is it that we\ndon't know the benefits enough is it\nthat we don't like processes enough it\nis is it that we're just addicted and\nthere isn't a because I look at and I do\nthink looking at very daily habit\nchanges is the easiest way to build the\nmuscle to go I can do this so I always\ngive the example of when I met my wife I\nwas addicted to Sugar like I I genuinely\nwas and I didn't even know it I had a\nSprite and a chocolate bar every day\nwithout thinking about it it's how I got\nthrough college it was life when I was a\nmonk I didn't have either of those\nthings but that was more of a\nsuppression and there was lots of other\ninteresting things to do or I didn't\nneed that kind of energy when I came\nback I feel like the convict who's sober\nin prison yeah you don't have access\nexactly I didn't have access to it and I\ndidn't I definitely built a discipline\nwhere I didn't feel like I needed it but\nthen when I came back to the real world\nall I wanted was chocolate and sugar and\nso when I met my wife it's like you know\nwe've been married for six years now\ntogether for ten and she like At first\nshe would just educate me and like she\nwould just tell because she's a\ndietitian nutritionist this is their job\nshe's laying out all the all the dangers\nof sugar then she's like taking it out\nof the like home like it's not around\nanymore it's not accessible and then\nalmost like it's taken six years and I\nwould say now I'm at a place where the\nHabit is really transformed and it's\nlike a six year Journey yeah yeah and\nobviously it probably happened like\nhalfway through I'd say like probably\nhappened three years ago where I really\nstarted cutting out sugar but he needed\na coach my wife was the coach it needed\na uh obedient or submissive student I I\ntrust my wife on this area it wasn't\nlike I was I didn't have an ego about it\nshe knows more than me about the body\nand then on top of that\nhe needed a focus in the sense that in\nmy health we kind of did it one at a\ntime without even trying whereas like we\ntook our sugar first we started working\nout next like she was she kind of did\nthat even unconsciously it just took so\nmuch and I go and I know obviously with\nthe story because we talk about\nmentoring and coaching and there's\nalways this cross-learning but I feel\nlike now we're all trying to do it on\nour own we are and we're also expecting\nthat it just happens that it's this like\nEpiphany if knowing what to do was\nenough everyone would be in great shape\nno one would have any of these illnesses\nor problems that we have it's so much\nmore complicated than that and I I do\ntry to remind people that it's a it's a\njourney that you're on your whole life\nthere's passages in meditations where\nMarx to realize is going you're an old\nman and you're still losing your temper\nyou're still worried about what other\npeople think he's like you're still\nafraid of death and it's almost here\nand and realizing that if the wisest\npeople in the world struggled their\nwhole life with this thing the idea that\nyou who were lucky enough to hear about\nit in your 20s or 30s or 40s that you're\njust gonna get it it's naive and it's\nalso unfair to yourself the question is\nare you getting better at it as you go\nright Seneca says how do I know I'm\nmaking progress and My Philosophy says\nI've begun to become a better friend to\nmyself so discipline is not just\nsqueezing blood from the stone it's not\njust whipping yourself it's\nhiring a coach it's you know setting\nreachable goals as you go it's it's\nstepping back and giving yourself credit\nand saying look how far we've come man\nlike we're doing great right it's not\nit's not just this sort of like in your\nface like how are you not there yetness\nright it's it's a journey and you're not\nsupposed to really ever get there that\nit's like the Horizon it's always a\nlittle bit further away and so you know\nI think\nwhen we hear discipline I think we think\nof like the Marine drill sergeant yeah\nthis is kind of transformative you\ndidn't have discipline and now you do we\nshould also think about the like having\na discipline it is a thing you do your\nwhole life and realizing that that's how\nwe should measure this progress I think\nthough that that's what we're banging\nour head against is that the mind\nhas been so far removed from the idea\nthat things take time that patience is\nrequired that one step at a time like we\nhear those things all the time but\nthere's literally nothing we do in our\nlives that requires us to move one step\nat a time anymore like it just doesn't\nwork and we know these examples like\nwhether you're ordering food to your\nhouse or whether you're getting this\ndelivered or whether you jump into an\nUber or Lyft we know that but I found it\nreally interesting recently like I just\nwent through a double hernia surgery\nand it's not life-threatening and it's\nmeant to be routine but it's far worse\nthan the doctors make it out to be and\nthe journey back to feeling like I can\noperate normally it's been two months\nnow and I'd say I'm 75 there I would say\nthat the first four weeks were like\nlearning how to walk again yeah and I\nhave never ever moved that slow in life\nin a good way as in that every movement\nof the body or the Mind had to be slow\nbecause if I moved fast I could\npotentially relapse yeah so I couldn't I\ncan't I still can't pick anything above\nlike 15 pounds if not allowed uh I I\ncouldn't for that first month like walk\nfor the first week and then I had a\nshimmy for the rest of it and I had to\nlike when I sat down on a chair I had to\nbe so mindful I was like wow I thought I\nwas mindful yeah and having this surgery\nhas made me the most mindful person ever\nI've I've never eaten that slow because\nthe digestion was harder and there was\npain in this area and so\nit was the first time in a long time I\nfelt that present and I consider myself\nto be a present person I think that the\nroot of it is this illusion we have that\nwe're in control right that we're\ndeciding how things go and then we have\nan injury or a problem or something that\ndisrupts it and we are rudely but also\nuh kindly reminded how little control we\nhave I remember I was I moved across the\ncountry I was writing my first book the\ntwo days before I was supposed to start\nriding my bike New Orleans I got stuck\nin the streetcar tracks like over the\nhandlebars and I break my left elbow and\nI'm left-handed and so like all of the\nway that I was thinking about writing\nthis book goes out the window for like\nsix weeks I couldn't get like the\nadrenaline or the endorphins that I\nneeded just to function as a person I\nhad to go in these like long walks so\nyou know I get the news and it's like\nokay I'm not going to be able to work or\nthink for like six weeks this is a total\ndead loss for me but then I started\ntaking these Walks Like hour two hour\nthree hour walks just around\nand what do you know I start writing the\nbook in my head on these walks if I had\ngotten things the way I wanted them to\ngo it would have been far less\nadvantageous to me than me having to\nrespond to the way they did end up going\nso at the core of stoicism is this idea\nthat we don't control what happens we\ncontrol how we respond to what happens\nit seems like it's this curse this human\nfrail to your weakness that like we're\nnot in control but our superpowers our\nability to respond to that to find good\nin it to be made better for it and you\nyou go through this thing and you\nrealize oh this is an opportunity to\npractice\nall of the things that I ordinarily take\nfor granted I assume I have there's this\none Japanese zen master actually the the\nZen master from Zen In The Art of\narchery and he's at the end of his life\nhe's he's dying and he he goes to\nurinate in the snow and it's red he's\nlike bleeding he's dying the students\nare alarmed he goes this too is practice\nall of these things that we experienced\nthat we didn't want or we thought they\nshould go a different way they're\nactually the opportunity to practice the\nway or the logo says the Stokes would\ncall it in the way it's actually meant\nto do if we choose to be present\nrecognize it and take that opportunity\ninstead of fighting it or resenting it\nor wishing it were otherwise even I love\nthat point that you may do that that\neven that was practice yeah that is\nbeautiful like that's that's magical\nlike that idea that even in that worst\nscenario at the end of all of it was\nstill practice and if we could only wrap\nour hand around that because I think we\nstill think of practice and Performing\npractice and arrival practice in the end\nwe still see it as separate and and\nthere is nothing that separate like that\ntree outside that's huge is still\ngrowing and being nourished it's just\nyou don't see it anymore yeah and I\nalmost sometimes what I do with clients\nis I'll give everyone a seed and I'll\nask them to plant it and take care of it\nand that's like an old way of just\nlearning growth because it's so painful\nto be watering something every day and\nnot seeing it grow only to realize it is\ngrowing or I remember something they\ngave us and the monastery was like they\ngave us this rope it was like this\nreally old rope and it was already tied\nand we were asked to untie it and it's\nlike most of us spent the whole of the\nfirst day we got it trying to untie it\nand failing yeah only by like day 21 to\nrealize all we had to do is pull it a\nlittle bit every day and hopefully it\nwould unravel because it was so tight\nand so even if you sat there all day you\nwould just you'd go mental and you\nwouldn't achieve anything else right\nyeah it was the willful will right it's\nlike wanting it a certain way needing it\na certain way trying to force it as\nopposed to stepping back and letting it\nbe what it is it's like the way our mind\nworks whatever is happening now you will\nlook back on sometime in the future as\nformative to who you become right and\nyet in this moment all we're doing is\ntrying to make it something other than\nit is right like we will look back on\ncovet and see the the good in it the\nlessons that came from it the reminders\nit gave us the weird experiences we had\nthe connections all of that will look at\nthat but in that moment all we're\nthinking about is when this will be over\nwhose fault it is you know what it's\ncost us right Freud says in in\nretrospect the struggle will strike you\nas most beautiful\nbut it seemed it's such a it's such a\nshame so unnecessary to deprive yourself\nof understanding the beauty of it now\ncertainly perspective adds to it it\nallows you to see it differently but\nwhat if you could just not feel guilty\nworried anxious resentful like you know\nin the future this will be a story right\nyou'll you'll learn but you could give\nyourself the gift of at least some of\nthat now by accepting it and just seeing\nit as what it is in front of you that\nit's practice Yeah Yeah and the\nchallenge I guess is that because we've\nnot had an experience maybe an early\nchildhood or in our teens where we saw\nthat where it was like we went through a\ndifficulty we built discipline and we\ngot over it or we learned from as you're\nsaying I find that a lot of people have\nexperienced difficulty but then they\nwere given Comfort or shelter or the\ndifficulty Were Somehow removed or left\nso you never got the opportunity to\nbuild the discipline muscle if that\nmakes sense like my my wife will have to\ntalk about like for her she went through\na difficulty like her parents would come\nand save the day yeah right someone\nwould swoop in and solve the issue her\nsister would do her homework for her and\nso as that happened more and more and\nmore it created this behavior of someone\nwill save the day that I don't need to\nbuild a discipline around this obviously\nsaving is coming from a good place the\nother thing we do is we tell it's so bad\nthat that happened to you I'm so sorry\nyou're this victim right like uh the\nfirst year of covert they would describe\nfor kids that this was like a lost year\nand I just remember thinking like how\nthat language yeah patronizing but also\nself-fulfilling that was for kids like\nuh when I would talk to my grandparents\nor old people that lived through the\ndepression or the second world war which\nwere by the way a lot longer than covet\nthey weren't like oh it was a lost time\nit was a transformative formative\nexperience that in retrospect made them\nwho they were that maybe even if you'd\nasked them if they would have wanted\nthings to be different they would have\nsaid no and we have the power to to\ntransform whatever we're going through\ninto that thing so yeah by rescuing\nsomeone you're depriving them of that\nthing but also by telling them that\nthere's no there's nothing in this thing\nthat it's indisputably inarguably bad is\nto deprive them of the agency the\nperspective the gift that they have in\nfront of them if they choose to see it\nthat way and we should emerge from this\nperiod the very least as you said like\nif you haven't been through stuff like\nthis before you just lived through an\nevent of historic proportions like you\njust live through event that your kids\nand your grandchildren future\nGenerations will Marvel at and you\nemerged unscathed maybe even improved in\nsome ways like you you should emerge\nfrom this with a real sense of what\nyou're capable of enduring and survive\ngiving and adjusting towards and that\nshould give you a lot of confidence as\nyou wake up and you experience things\nthat are so microscopic compared to that\nthing yeah right and and you should feel\narmed with a certain set of weapons or\ntools that maybe you didn't have before\nlike you've been knocked around and you\ndidn't get knocked down that's that's\npowerful yeah yeah absolutely and and in\nmy own little way it's like in while I\nwas going through my surgery it was\nexactly that was like I can either sit\nhere and think this the worst because it\ndid feel like there was for someone\nwho's active always on planes and always\ntraveling always working\nto to be completely off and it wasn't\neven restful because it was painful like\nit wasn't restful time everyone's like\nwe didn't work for a month it must have\nbeen amazing I was like well no I was in\npain yeah but the idea that my mind at\nthe time was like this is the worst I\nhate this and when's it gonna be over\nright which is the same as covid yeah\nwhich is the same as anything like those\nare the three thoughts that go through\nour head pretty much whether it's\nsurgery covered or anything else that's\ngoing on and having to reframe those\nthoughts in the moment yeah made it\nbecome a really beautiful process at the\ntime and now a sense of gratitude for it\nhaving moved on but that's what I'm\nhearing from you is like you will\nreflect well hopefully you'll reflect\nafterwards but there is a bit of\nreconfiguration that has to happen at\nthe time yeah there's a story about Phil\nJackson when he's a coach of the Lakers\nhe gets this back surgery it's super bad\nback surgery and he can't stand on the\nsideline he has to sit in a chair and\nthe way they had him sit it's like a row\nback and so suddenly all the the things\nthat he's comfortable with as a coach\nare not possible he's not able to Pace\nthe sidelines get up in people's faces\nintervene direct people he just has to\nsit back and he has to watch it's like\nthe antithesis of his coaching style and\nyet and he's a sort of a Zen Buddhist\nguy he realizes that this is practice\nthat he realizes that now the team's\nhaving to come to him now the team's\nhaving to solve some of the problems\nhe's having to explore a different way\nof communicating he's having to\ncommunicate verbally better than\nphysically it's a way to change adjust\nhe's forced to do it differently and\nthus learns some things he wants to\ncontinue doing differently now realizes\nhe was taking for granted certain things\nthat are actually super important right\nand so you can always take from this\nlike it's this forced lifestyle\nexperiment just see it as that right\nlike covet the biggest Force lifestyle\nexperiment in human history things that\npeople said were impossible had to\nbecome possible remote work you know\ne-commerce all these things\nand then you want to throw that away by\nsaying I can't wait for things to go\nback to normal right it's like normal is\nwhat caused this right normal was you\nbefore you learned the things that you\nlearned in that intervening time and for\ncovid for for Phil Jackson's back\nsurgery insert whatever disruptive event\nyou're undergoing in your life yeah you\ndon't want things to go back to how they\nwere you want them to go to a new place\nwhere you have the old perspective and\nthe New Perspective fused into something\nnew when Marx really says the impediment\nto action advances action which stands\nin the way becomes the way the Zen\nexpression is the obstacle is the path\nsame East West coming to the same idea\nit's like this thing has opportunities\ninside it to make you better should you\nchoose to accept them yeah and and\nthat's what I like it's not the\nsimplistic idea of and and I'm always\ntrying to address this it's not the\nsimplistic idea of look for the positive\nand the negative right like that's not\nwhat we're saying here this isn't the\nidea of like oh there's a\na beautiful side to this that's not the\npoint let's let's get into that a bit\nbecause I feel like people kind of\nsimplify and go oh no that just yeah\nwe'll just look for the Silver Lining\nwhich is not what we're saying well do\nyou know the Stockdale Paradox no so\nJames Stockdale he studies stoic\nphilosophy and then he's shot down over\nVietnam and he's taken prisoners it's\nbeen seven years horribly tortured in\nthis Vietnamese prison camp afterwards\nhe's speaking to Jim Collins who wrote\nwho writes good to great and and he\nformulates what becomes known as the\nStockdale Paradox Jim Khan says who has\nthe worst trouble in the prison camp and\nStockdale says oh that's easy the\noptimists right the people who thought\nI'm going to be out by Christmas I'm\ngoing to be out by the spring this isn't\ngoing to be hard when stockdale's\nparachuting into this Camp he says I am\nleaving the world of technology and\nentering the world of Epictetus he says\nit's going to be seven years at least\nbut he said he said the first step is I\nhad to unflinchingly accept the reality\nof my situation which is that I might\nnot get out which is that I'm probably\ngoing to be tortured which is that I'm\nnot in control which is that there's so\nmuch unknown pain and suffering ahead I\nhave to accept that this is not going to\nbe fun this is not going to be easy he\nsays but simultaneously I said to myself\nif I get out\nI want to have transformed this into\nsomething that in retrospect I would not\nhave traded away that's the Paradox of\nwhat we're talking about stuff happens\nlife gets in the way you lose someone\nyour company goes bankrupt the market\nshifts you know a natural disaster your\nlife can get flipped upside down\nat a moment's notice you have to\nunflinchingly accept the reality of that\nsituation the unfairness the\nunexpectedness of it your blamelessness\nor your blame worthiness for it and then\nsimultaneously go okay\nI'm not saying this is wonderful that\nI'm glad it happened but I can make\nchoices now that derive positive\nbenefits from this that make me better\nfor having gone through this and I I was\nat the beginning of the pandemic in the\nmiddle of opening this bookstore it sent\nmy life savings into opening this\nbookstore that by the time it was ready\nit was impossible to open it was looking\nlike this enormous failure mistake you\nknow like albatross around my neck and I\nI wrote this note card to myself and I\nhave a picture of it because I took I\nwrote it to myself I was thinking about\nevery day and I took the picture in\nfront of the bookstore uh and I just\nwrote to myself I said 2020 is a test\nwill make you a better person or a worse\none right I have no idea whether the\nbookstore will work I have no idea where\nthings are going I have no idea what\nlife is going to look like what I\ncontrol inside that is do I emerge from\nit a better person right more community\nreminded a better spouse a better\nthinker a better writer more patient\nmore self-aware those are the things I\ncontrol within it and so when we say the\nobstacle is the way we're not like oh\nit's great this terrible thing happened\nto me but you're saying what I took from\nthis terrible thing or maybe you're\ntrying to strip the labels all together\nbut you're saying what I took from this\nwas positive I made from it that's the\nparadoxical yeah yeah that's a great\nbreakdown I'm so glad you went into that\nbecause yeah I've heard the example in\nthe same way of when there were soldiers\nwho said we'll be home by Christmas they\ntheir Hope was shattered yeah because\nthey weren't home by Christmas and\nwhereas the people who said we'll figure\nout a way to get home and if we get home\nwe'll see our family and that person was\nmore likely to be able to deal with the\nfact that it didn't happen by this time\nand I think I think that's become our\nobsession with controlling time yeah is\npartly where that comes from where it's\nlike we want this done by this time yeah\nand then whether it's Paul positive or\ndifficult when it doesn't happen we're\ncompletely demoralized right like it's\nalmost like it's all over just because\nit didn't have happen by an arbitrary\ndate where you're setting yourself up\nfor disappointment or frustration or\nresentment or despair by attaching to an\noutcome that's not yours if you get\nlucky sure you'll feel wonderful but if\nyou work for years on a book and success\nor failure of it was did It win awards\ndid it sell lots of copies did your\nparents read it you know those are\nthings that are not in your control but\nif it was I understand this better than\nwhen I started I am more confident than\nI was when I started you know like I\nsaid something I got on the page what I\nthought only in my head at the beginning\nright like when when when you move the\noutcome or the goal to something that's\nup to you you'll always win and I think\nthat's what wise people do there it's\nnot that they're not ambitious they are\nambitious but their ambition is things\nthat are up to them and and so when\nMarcus is saying better wrestler as\nopposed to better philosopher better\nfriend whatever she's shifting from like\nthis external societal driven thing to\nthis internal thing that he controls\nthat he gets to judge the success or\nfailure on and it's not so quantifiable\neither it's something deeper more human\nmore connected and so as you shift that\nnot only do I actually think you do\nbetter work but you are increasing your\nchances of feeling good about yourself\nat the end of that yeah and I think the\nchallenge Ryan though is that today we\nwant both right we want the we want the\nfeeling of I did something that was true\nto me yeah and it resonated with a lot\nof people or whatever that means right\nlike and I feel like that's where where\neveryone kind of gets stuck because it's\nlike\nyou know especially when people watch\npeople do what they love and it gets\nreceived well it's like oh well I want\nto do that too where do you think people\ngo wrong in that Journey because like\nwhat are the mistakes we make on that\npath because I feel like that's pretty\nmuch where where people are headed well\nyeah I mean I think we're sometimes not\nhonest with you like I'm just I want\nthis album to be true to who I want to\nbe my artistic expression blah blah\nthat's why you made all these sort of\nindividualistic decisions but deep down\nyou have this sort of secret lie which\nis that you're actually judging yourself\non where it lands on the billboard yes\nright so that's the worst of both right\nbecause you're not going well what do I\nneed to do to be commercially successful\nand I'm consistently judging myself on\nwhether it was commercially successful\nor not you've set yourself up for\nmaximum disappointment but if you can\nsay look\nhere my goal is to do my absolute best\nmy goal here is to get to the truth of\nwhat I'm saying to express my in what\nwhat's true inside here and that's what\nI'm going to focus on and I'm not going\nto waste any time on these other things\nI actually do think I'm sure you found\nthis is that that does make better work\nit makes truer work it makes more\nauthentic work more relatable work it\nactually does make a better product but\nonly if you are fully and honestly and\ndeeply committed to doing it it can't be\nlike I'm making the charitable donation\nI'm doing it anonymously\nbut I still hope everyone sees how\nwonderful I am you know what I mean it's\nyou can't have your cake and eat it too\nyes exactly and and I think it goes back\nto what you were saying a few moments\nago where it's like you have to accept\nthe reality which includes your own\nintention like I know that I like\ncreating things that are true to me but\nall commercially successful that is\nimportant to me is a value of mine and\nI'm okay with that yeah uh because I\ndon't want to lie about those things to\nmyself at all because I enjoy the idea\nof creating thoughts and ideas that can\naffect lots of people like that that is\nsomething that gives me a sense of uh\nfeeling that I've understood an idea and\nbeen able to communicate it well enough\nI I guess what I'm saying is that it\ncomes back to what you were saying at\nthe beginning that I don't set out to\nwrite a commercially successful book or\nlaunch something commercially like that\nisn't what are you set out to do set out\nto understand articulate communicate\nwith myself and write an incredible book\nand then and that leads to that but at\nsome part of that process you have to\nthink about the sharing of it yeah of\ncourse and I've learned a lot from you\nin this regard like you're not helping\nyourself or your ideas by rejecting what\nmakes them accessible or shareable or\nturning your nose up at this tool or\nthat tool like look like when I want to\nlearn about an idea I want to read\nlong-form books about it that's the\nmedium that I'm comfortable in I don't\nthink Tick Tock but millions of people\ndo think Tick Tock or Instagram and to\nturn your nose up or close your heart\noff to those people because they're not\nlike you it's not just snobbish but if\nyou actually care about the ideas it's\nselfish and and so I don't think they're\nmutually exclusive but I also think if\nyou're on those platforms and you're\nletting the algorithm decide what you do\nand don't do correct you are sacrificing\nthe whole reason you became a Creator in\nthe first place correct abs absolutely\nand I think that's the that's the\nbalance right it's like there's there's\npeople who just completely sell out for\nthe algorithm and then there's the\nselfish Creator or the snobbish Creator\non the other end who thinks they're too\ncool yeah like it's kind of like this\nbadge of honor where it's like oh yeah I\ndon't need to do that like I don't care\nabout and I'm like that that defeats the\nwhole point because I'm hoping this book\nwas a compassionate expression of\nservice hopefully and maybe it wasn't\nmaybe it just wasn't selfish arrogant\nmove of professing your ideas and that's\nlike the best thing about it and so you\nhave sellouts on one and you have\nselfish on the other end and to me like\nservice is kind of in the Middle where\nit's like service means I understand\npeople's needs and interests and\nconcerns and where they're at but I also\nhave to serve them what's most\nbeneficial once like you meet people\nwhere they are yeah and and like\nit there's almost agreed to it's like\nwell I wrote in a book if you want to\nhear it you can buy it right well what\nif they're not ready for that what if\nthey're too busy for that what if they\nalready did buy it but they just need a\nreminder of it right and so there's\ndifferent just in the way that like look\nI also read in English that's the only\nlanguage that I speak but I don't turn\nup my nose at all these different\ntranslations I go oh yeah there's a\nprocess these ideas get translated into\nthose languages and they reach people\nwho otherwise wouldn't have consumed it\nyeah and understanding that different\npeople have different Native languages\nsome people like audiobooks some people\nlike podcasts some people like this\nsocial network or that social network\nand that by thinking that you know one\nis superior to the other in fact you\nshould be translating your work in all\nthese different areas long form short\nform audio video text what you should be\neverywhere that's that's possible and\nunderstanding that the win is that the\nideas are reaching people and helping\nthem in their life if some of those\nthings translate to sales or followers\ngreat but like I I always think about\nlike again what is success at the end of\nthe day like if your thing sold zero\ncopies but it changed the world you'd be\nlike that was that that was a win so why\ndon't you just do the stuff that changes\nthe world and Trust again trust the\nprocess that you'll probably be able to\nmake a living absolutely absolutely and\nmost things that do change the world or\nhave an impact started non-commercially\nright like in that sense of especially\ncreational ideas I mean uh maybe not\nbusinesses but but ideas like when I\nstarted creating content even the first\nfew interviews I did with you like I did\nI mean that NASDAQ that I never got paid\nfor that whole series I was interviewing\nauthors every week because I was\nfascinated by the idea that I get to sit\ndown with people that I find interesting\nyou're also putting in your hours you're\ngetting good at it yeah yeah exactly and\nyou're getting good at it you're\nenjoying it you get to meet awesome\npeople uh and even even when we did the\nshow at HuffPost it was like it was I\nwas leading the show of what kind of\nshow we wanted it to be it wasn't like\nyeah it was already set up and so yeah I\nlook back and I think like all stuff\nthat had an impact and grew was always\nfrom that deep intention pure intention\nof I want to create something that will\nhopefully help people have these\nconversations and that was what it was\nfor me I felt when I started creating\ncontent there weren't there were so many\npeople who had deep thoughtful\nconversations offline but there was no\nspaces online really to have those or\nthere wasn't a piece of content you'd\nsend to your friend and be like did you\nsee this like have we talked about this\nand I wanted to create an excuse for\npeople to have more meaningful\nthoughtful conversations based on ideas\nI mean look I think at the end of the\nday it's like you create a lot of value\nand if you can capture a small\npercentage of it you're good right like\nI think about Craigslist like the vast\nmajority of stuff on Craigslist has been\nfree since the very beginning Craigslist\nstill makes a billion dollars a year in\nRevenue like when you create a lot of\nvalue I create so much content and like\nthe only part that is not free are the\nbooks yeah right and the books fund that\nwork and then that work also funds the\nbooks it's you you're creating kind of a\nflywheel of stuff I was thinking about\none of my books that hasn't sold as well\nas the other books which one is it uh\nlives of the stoics is different than my\nother books but I personally use and\nthen also have reused stuff that I\nlearned while writing that book almost\nevery single day so like the\nmonetization you know to use that word\nthe value creation there was a personal\none and the book is done extremely well\nby like any sort of standard but like\nthe primary beneficiary was me yes and\nagain if you whatever you're doing you\ncan say look the primary beneficiary of\nthis is me having gone through it\nchanging developing learning and then\nthe byproduct is that I paid my rent or\nthat like you know this happened that\nthen you've You've Won and all the stuff\nthat's out of your control is the extra\nyes that's where you want to be yeah\nyeah I can agree more and and that\nrequires just so much I think that\nrequires refining of the intention it\nrequires having a\nsense of belief and confidence I think I\nthink for me is the other and for you\ntoo I from from your journey that we've\ntalked about before like\nI spent 10 years doing this without any\nfollowers or without any commerciality\nto it anyway because it was all offline\nyeah and it was speaking to rooms of\nfive to ten people if they showed up and\nso it was like for so long I was doing\nit without any care of how far it went\nbecause it was just so powerful it was\nso beautiful to live in that world of\neven if I had one meaningful\nconversation with someone after an event\nthat would make my day like I'd talk\nabout it for weeks let me ask you this\nI've been thinking about it lately yeah\nthe work that you're doing now or that\nI'm doing now is the result of work you\ndid a long time ago it's a lagging\nindicator of sacrifice and commitment\nand study and practice from however long\nago sometimes what keeps me up at night\nis I go\nbut 10 years from now 15 years from now\nam I putting in the work doing this\nstuff now that will pay off then and how\ndo you know how do you know if success\nis this lagging indicator or growth is\nthis lagging indicator of commitment now\nhow can you be sure that you are paying\nyour dues yes I'm so glad you said that\nbecause I literally just I've been\ntalking to my team about a few things\nthat we're doing I've literally asked us\nto find three new coaches like I've\nliterally gone I've always learned\nthrough one-to-one coaching or\nmentorship like that's my favorite apart\nfrom books that is my favorite way of\nlearning uh and especially when it comes\nto self-transformation so I love ideas\nthrough books but when it comes to me\nactually changing I'm better when I'm\nworking with one person and getting\nmentorship or coaching so you're\nthinking about who are who are your\nteachers to get you to the next level\nlevel you might not even know exists yet\ncorrect and so I'm trying to identify\nthose people right now so when I was a\nteen I was reading Malcolm X Martin\nLuther King Steve Jobs right like well\nSteve Jobs a bit later actually but my\nLuther King Malcolm X like that's who I\nwas reading at 16 years old they were\nhugely uh formative in my ideology in so\nmany ways and then in my 20s obviously I\nlived with the monk so that was hugely\nthat and then when a public speaking\nschool when I was 11 years old so that\nhas that has lasted far too long and\nneeds to be refined again uh and and so\nyeah I completely agree with you I look\nat all the skills I have today and I go\nwhere do they need to be refined yeah\nand then I look at what are the things\nI'm missing out on because I'm not\nexposing myself now I do think that I do\nfind having the podcast very fortunate\nbecause I do get to sit down with a lot\nof people that I seek mentorship from in\nan informal sense and then I could be\nlike Oh I'm really going to do a deep\ndive on that person's book or yeah like\nGabon mate was just on yeah he's amazing\nlike you know and and people have known\nabout him for a long long time this was\nthe first time I interviewed him but I'm\nlike now doing a backwards reading of\nall of his books sure and so I love that\nyou know yeah it's like what rabbit\nholes are you falling down what sort of\nnew it's like a great athlete it's like\nwhat am I adding to my game this off\nseason totally and like how do you not\nget complacent and Coast because you\ncould be coasting for a long time\nthat your skills or your speed is slowly\ndecreasing before it and then it's it's\ntoo late yeah that's such a good point\nand I think the thing that hit me there\nwhat you just said is just it's also\nwhat skills do I need that I'm not\ntrying to see the results now yes like\nwhat is something I'm happy to let kind\nof simmer and build and just organically\ngrow rather than like I'm gonna learn\nthis skill because next week we're going\nto launch this thing like that's not\nwhat I'm talking about well the things\nyou were talking about that made you who\nyou were those were never means to an\nend because the end was inconceivable\nright no it didn't even exist but\nsomehow it was the perfect like training\nmontage for who you became and how do\nyou make sure the Montage is continuing\nas opposed to\nthis once in a formative thing and then\nyou know every once in a while do a talk\nand like it's the person before me like\noh you've been doing this a long time\nthe exact same way and you you stopped\nyou stopped and you don't yeah you don't\nwant that yeah exactly and I think\npartly that's also me allowing myself at\nleast for me and I'm only talking about\nmyself but I think this is helpful for\npeople\nI think you have to allow yourself to\nbecome different things and giving\nyourself permission to follow that Bliss\nas Joseph Campbell would say because\nright for example when I when I wrote\nThink like a monk that was uh the kind\nof end and beginning of a new journey in\nmy life like I was kind of encapsulating\nwhat I've learned over the last 15 years\nand then it was like well now I'm in a\nnew space like I'm a married man now I'm\nI'm a business person I'm I'm so many\nmore things and so it was almost like me\nsaying okay well I'm gonna put this\nwrapper on this right now and now my\nnext book's all about love and there's\nloads of people going J like why are you\nwriting about love like why and I was\nlike because I'm fascinated by love like\nand I'm okay with answering that\nquestion yeah of why love I don't want\nto continue to write books I mean by the\nway the love book is full of wisdom I\nlearned during my times among of course\nit is but the point is that I don't want\nto be defined by that and I don't want\nto limit myself to Any Human Experience\nbecause then I'm basically saying I have\nto be this and that's what performers do\nyeah I have to play this character for\nthe rest of my life and then you get\nTypecast in your own life and you don't\nlet yourself and I'm like maybe my next\nbook will definitely not be about love I\nknow that for a fact my next book's not\nabout love but I'm okay with that like I\nlike the idea of I'm letting myself go\nin the direction of whatever I want to\nbecome because why why would I limit it\nnow we talked about like you know\ncranking the shower handle but that's a\nmuscle right my first book was about\nmarketing yeah I could have sold my next\nbook about marketing my next book about\nMarket I'd be still doing that I could\nstill be speaking about that first book\nand when I went to my publisher and I\nwas like you know I want to write about\nthis obscure School of ancient\nphilosophy they were like what you know\nthey were like how's half sound you know\nthey're gonna be half what I got for my\nfirst book but that's that muscle I was\nlike I don't care this is what I want to\ndo and so when you cultivate the ability\nto to do that hard thing the challenging\nthing the different thing the investing\nin like being bad at something to get\ngood at something you think about Tiger\nWoods he's changed his swing three or\nfour times from the ground up that's the\nreal muscle that prevents you from sort\nof ossifying or declining it's the\nability to go like just because I'm here\ndoesn't mean I'm gonna stay here I want\nto try and do something radically new or\ndifferent that I I hope will work\ncommercially but I know personally I\nwill emerge BET right like like let's\nsay that the the book doesn't work I'm\nsure it will let's say it doesn't work\nbut you're like hey my my marriage is\nbetter as having done it that's a win\nfrom top to bottom right and then you\nknow you take that with you as you go\nfor me writing it I wrote a completely\ndifferent book than the one I thought I\nwas going to write and I wrote it three\ntimes and the first time it was 2 raw\nand probably two like it was it was\nprobably too tougher read and the second\ntime it was too shallow like it was\ntotally like not what I would want to do\nand then the third time we got the\nbalance right yeah it's funny what you\nsaid about earlier like the discipline\nof trying to get out of doing things\nwrong but the discipline of ambition\nonce you've had one success in anything\nmost people grip onto it because now\nyou've had a taste of it yeah and now\nyou're scared that if you don't be that\nperson you will lose it and I just\nwouldn't want to live that way because\nthen you are just acting well and not\nbeing it's like what you think that\nhaving the success proving yourself\nshould make you more courageous less\nrisk-averse because now you've done it\nbut in fact the opposite is true right\nthis is where courage and discipline are\nrelated uh it's the opposite now you\nhave something to lose now you don't\nwant to change go in a different\ndirection because the expectation is set\nwith the first one\nso you imagine how scary this Tiger\nWoods you're like you're the best swing\nin golf and you're like but I think it\ncould be better but I'm gonna have to go\nhave a bad swing for months to get to\nthe other side of that and so the\nability to say I decide whether I'm\nsuccessful or not not the external\nresults and that's why I'm willing to go\ndown this detour try things differently\ndo this that is that sort of key skill\nencourage and discipline have to be\nrelated they complement each other and\nyeah look it was come from my first book\ncame out it debuted on the bestseller\nlist it was controversial but if who I\nwould be today if I continue down that\nroad would be a caricature of that first\nperson because I would have been it\nwould have been a copy of a copy of a\ncopy of a copy instead I went towards\nsomething that was interesting to me\nwhich opened up another thing that was\ninterested and and that like I wouldn't\nbe who I am had I done the safe thing\nand so all they say all growth is a leap\nin the dark right you have to\ncontinually take that leap and one of\nthe things I I hope you learn and when\nyou do that is first off it's not as\nscary as you thought\nbut then sometimes like it doesn't work\nand you go oh but I feel great about it\nand then it decouples external\nrecognition from the internal process\nand then you go yeah I just do what I\nwant I do where it takes me and a lot of\ntimes it works out sometimes it doesn't\nbut it's called being a creator for a\nreason you're making something you're\nthe leader you're not a follower once\nsaid run this has been so much fun uh\nabout diving in with you we've been\ntalking for ages I had no idea where the\ntime went uh but it's been such a joy\njust always like just getting into with\nyou and I hope that everyone who's been\nlistening I hope you go and grab a copy\nof discipline is Destiny the power of\nself-control uh by Ryan holiday and of\ncourse any of the other books that we've\nrecommended before on the show if you\nlove this episode you can go back and\nlisten to a ton of other episodes with\nRyan uh and again I hope today's episode\nI tried not to do for everyone who's\nlistening and you know I've been trying\nthis more recently I tried not to do uh\nsystematic conversation of breaking down\nhow to build discipline and which you\nknow I I've been avoiding that kind of\nhack kind of conversation recently which\nI think you've been really resonating\nwith because I think sometimes the penny\nthat needs to drop isn't the how-to it's\nkind of like the the churning of the\nidea in your own self of of coming\ncloser to what it truly means for you\nand making sense of it so that's been my\nattempt at least uh and I hope that's\ncoming through I hope you enjoyed this\nplease do give me feedback on on Twitter\nInstagram tag Ryan and I both with your\ngreatest insights the nuggets of wisdom\nuh and we'll see you on another episode\nof on purpose thank you everyone if you\nlove this episode you'll enjoy my\ninterview with Dr Daniel Layman on how\nto change your life by changing your\nbrain everything in moderation\nwhich is the Gateway thought to hell\nit's the Gateway thought to cheating as\nsoon as you hear someone say everything\nin moderation they're going to do\nsomething bad for their brain"
