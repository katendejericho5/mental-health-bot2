    "transcript": "there really is a tension between being\nand becoming on some level being isn't\nenough because you know that life is\nalso an unending series of problems to\nbe solved we're all going to die right\nso we have to find some mode of being at\npeace with impermanence the best-selling\nauthor and host the number one Health\nand Wellness podcast on purpose with Jay\nShetty\nmy question is what's worth pursuing or\nwhat is worthy of pursuit in life yeah\nwell there really is a tension between\nbeing and becoming right I think we we\nlive with this tension\nevery moment of our lives and\nI think I think the domain of our\nspiritual concerns really focuses on the\nbeing part where they could just say\njust spirituality\nfor lack of a better word is whatever\nyou put in the space provided it is an\nanswer to the question of how is it\npossible to be fulfilled in the present\nmoment in the midst of whatever's\nhappening you know knowing that\nexperience is always changing knowing\nthat you can't possibly\ncreate an experience that doesn't change\nhow is it possible to be at peace with\nthe flux right so that's it's an and\nreally\nfinding a mode of being that wherein you\nyou you can recognize a type of\nfulfillment that isn't predicated on the\nnext good thing happening right the\nstory you're telling yourself about the\nfuture that may in fact never arrive on\nsome level being isn't enough because\nthey're all the ways in the ways the\nworld might be right I mean there's the\npossibility space of of what we can\ncreate and and what we want to create\ntakes effort and so there's all these\nthings that are not actualized now even\nif we're content now and I think the\ndomain of our\nbecoming I mean there's all kinds of\nhealthy ways of unhealthy ways of\nbecoming but the healthy\nmode of becoming\nat least one part of it is\nit really subsumes our ethical lives\nright it's like just what what is it\nwhat would be good to do what is\npositive what is pro-social how can we\nmake the world a better place how can we\nraise our kids to be wise and honest and\nand content and I mean all of these are\nprojects that take work and so it's not\njust a matter of of just chilling out\nperfectly and watching what happens we\nwe do have to do things so the the\ntension really is in\nbeing\nat peace in the meditative sense in the\ncontemplative sense in the spiritual\nsense even while you make great effort\nto accomplish things and I I think the\npeace part comes\nwhen you recognize that your happiness\nis not actually predicated on getting\nany of those things done I mean that you\nhave to learn to love the process you\nhave to learn to recognize the goals\nthemselves as valid as they might be to\nachieve the experience of achieving them\nis very brief and it has this Mirage\nlike quality where it just it recedes I\nmean you've been thinking about this\nthing for a year and you finally get to\nthat landmark\nand what is it well it's just another\nmoment of being alive and now you've got\nyour thoughts about the past and the\nfuture still and the question is can you\nactually make\nfull contact with the present moment and\nso in the quote you read my main point\nwas most people if you don't know how to\nmeditate you're you're basically trying\nto arrange the world to give you a good\nenough reason to recognize at the\npresent moment is enough right and once\nyou actually know how to meditate you\ncan sink into the present moment\nregardless of what else you're\nstruggling to accomplish and so you can\nbe\nyou can sort of take the goal as\nas the path right I mean kind of\nemotionally and cognitively you sort of\nyou've already arrived in terms of your\nown concerns about your own well-being\nand yet you know that life is also an\nunending series of problems to be solved\nright but you're we're all going to die\nright it's not there's there's no\nsolution to the the the the massive\nproblem of impermanence right so we have\nwe have to find some mode of being at\npeace with impermanence and that and\nthat's really that's where the\ncontemplative life comes in so we're\ntalking about pursuing peace we're\ntalking about pursuing this ability to\nnavigate between as you were saying\nbeing at peace with where you are now\nbut at the same time growing and\nprogressing and and loving the process\nas well how do you define just for\neveryone who's listening because I know\nyou do this a lot in the book and in\nyour work as well how do you define\nspirituality and how do you define\nreligion so that people can just make\nsense of those terms as we use them\nthroughout this yeah conversation yeah\nwhy is it so attentive as you probably\nknow I tend to be a Critic of organized\nreligion because it just forget about\nthe the tribalism that religion\nso often engenders and the conflict born\nof that tribalism I just think we need a\n21st century conversation about human\nwisdom and human happiness and and you\nknow spirituality is a word I use\nalthough I use it somewhat in scare\nquotes because people have associations\nwith it that I think are just not\nhelpful so my argument is really you can\nhave a 21st century conversation about\nreality and you and how to live within\nit or you can have a seventh century\nconversation January 5th Century BC\nconversation you can you can locate\nyourself at any point in human history\nor you can at this moment decide to\nAvail yourself of all of the best ideas\nand and just recognize that we have\nreally a common inheritance of wisdom\nand insight and it's we can we can use\nwhatever works right and ultimately we\nhave to be the best judges of what works\ngiven the needs of the moment given\ntechnological changes that could never\nhave been foreseen by our ancestors\nright so whether we do this with the U.S\nConstitution or we do it with the Bible\nor we do it with with the\nthe polycanon you know the Buddhist\nscripture is just you can\nthere's no question that our ancestors\nhave created documents and ways of\nthinking and methodologies you know\nscience being one the contemplative\npractice being another that are\nincredibly valuable to us but we we have\nto recognize that you know in this\nmoment in time all we have is human\nconversation and human intuition and\nhuman Insight by which to navigate and\nso I just for the religion piece\nto be dogmatically attached to a\nspecific religion as though it were the\none true way of seeing everything that\njust doesn't make any sense to me at\nthis moment I mean it's analogous to\nwanting to say that you know the physics\nis a Christian\nphenomenon because the Christians for\nthe most part were the first people to\nactually make real breakthroughs in\nphysics well it's just\nthere's no reason to speak of of\nChristian physics or Muslim algebra and\nand ultimately I think there'll be no\nreason to speak of Christian or Buddhist\nor Hindu spirituality I think we have a\ncommon human project and whatever is\ntrue of the human mind\nand as possibilities there has to be a a\nway of talking about that that truly\ntranscends culture and and certainly it\nisn't sectarian in any usual sense right\nin the same way that science when it's\nworking\ntranscends culture and isn't sectarian I\nmean there's no Japanese science versus\nAmerican Science versus you know there's\njust there's just science\nspirituality For Better or Worse is a\nword that I think we still need to use\nbecause I might tend to I also talk\nabout the contemplative life or you know\nwisdom traditions and and specific\npractices like meditation but it names a\nan approach to well-being that isn't\npredicated on all of the usual seeking\nto become happy right so it's not about\ngetting wealthy or it's not a it's not\nabout getting healthier and fitter and\nthose are all worthwhile projects uh and\nthey're not in conflict with\nspirituality but the the the the the\nspiritual piece in spirituality is what\nhow is it possible to pay attention in\nthis moment so as to not suffer\nunnecessarily right and and what are the\nactual mechanics of our psychological\nsuffering such that we do\nsuffer unnecessarily so much of the time\nand when you look closely at all that it\nreally is a matter of being lost in\nthought almost all of the time and\nthere's there's kind of this living this\nwaking Dreamscape of thought where we're\ntalking to ourselves moment to moment\nwe're not aware of it and so much of\nthat conversation\nis an unhappy one and meditation is\nreally a way of breaking that spell and\nwaking up from the dream of discursivity\nand identification with thought\nespecially you can recognize that that\nConsciousness that you know that by\nwhich\neverything is seen and known and\nexperienced and felt right just the the\nthe qualitative character of your own\nbeing in this moment\nConsciousness has certain qualities that\nare intrinsically peaceful and and\ngratifying and not and and free of\nproblems right and to and and it's it's\nreally the layer of thought that we fail\nto recognize all that and feel that our\nyou know every waking moment is some\nform of emergency that has to be\nresponded to or reacted to yeah and I\nthink the way you define\nspirituality and the way you talk about\nit I feel like it's definitely more and\nmore\nappealing today I think it's definitely\nsomething that as you said we need a\n21st century version of what we're\npursuing and how we think about reality\nand I think those conversations\nare happening more often and and more\nstrongly and in more important circles I\nI have this question because I've I've\noften thought about this you've well\ndocumented the pitfalls of organized\nreligion and the challenges that come\nwith that what do you think of the\npitfalls or challenges of spirituality\nin the fact that we move away from\nsomething as you said earlier was like\nyou know this very defined structured\nway of living that we've now come to\nlook at it and gone okay that doesn't\nmake sense all the time and at the other\nend we have a complete kind of open\nParadigm of spirituality which can often\nbe confusing lacking structure lacking\nsomewhat of a map like do you see\ncertain pitfalls as to how we practice\nand\nuh become contemplative about\nspirituality yeah well so I should say\nthat much that goes by the name of\nspirituality is also something that that\nis worth\nbeing skeptical of right there are many\nbeliefs that people form and many of\nthese are are imported from religion\nthey just can't be squared with a\nsophisticated scientific view of just\nwhat reality is like you know it's not\nto say we've figured everything out and\nwe we certainly haven't but we just know\nthat that certain superstitious magical\nof the worldly beliefs are just not\nlikely to be true and and yet the most\nimportant spiritual claims traditionally\nlike the fact that\nunconditional love is a possible state\nof mind right or\num that the self as is normally felt and\nconceived is actually illusory right\nthey were taken in by a powerful\nillusion of separateness and that's that\nfeeling of separateness can be inspected\nand ultimately penetrated and felt\nthrough and felt Beyond\num and those are really those are the\nthe babies in the bathwater of religion\nand spirituality that I think everyone\nis if they think about it long enough\nwants to conserve and yeah and though\nand those are you know fully supported\nby a modern discussion of of the human\nmind and even a a neural anatomical\ndiscussion of the human mind there's no\nam I as you know my PhD is in\nNeuroscience that I can tell you there's\nno place in the brain for a a an\nunchanging ego to be hiding right I mean\nthe sense that we have a self that is\nunchanging that's carried through from\nmoment to moment that is the place from\nwhich we appropriate experience that is\nseparate from experience that is just\ngranted it's a powerful illusion for\nmany people but it's an illusion that it\ncan be dispelled and once dispelled you\nit actually brings your your experience\ninto closer register with what we have\nevery reason to believe\nneuroscientifically about just the way\nthe Mind should be based on what on the\nway the brain is if you wander into the\nspiritual side of a bookstore if you can\neven find a physical bookstore these\ndays it's been it's been a while since\nI've been in one I've been going through\nquite a few over Christmas yeah but uh\nthey're few and far between at the\nmoment definitely but if you so in that\nsection of the bookstore there's a lot\non the shelves that is bogus or semi\nbogus or you know filled with wishful\nthinking and and not so interesting\nintellectually or ethically frankly but\nthere's there's a lot that is truly\nvalid and you and I think we just have\nto become wiser curators of the totality\nof human conversation and the world's\nliterature\nto find what is worthy of of our\nCredence at this point and this is what\nwe do we do this naturally and I think\nwe just need\nto be honest that we are the ones like\nwhen you go to an ancient text when you\ngo to the\num if you take your your favorite\nspiritual or religious book in almost\nall of them there are passages that are\nobviously anachronistic and and just not\nsuited to a 21st century view of of just\nhow we should live right so there's a\nlot about how to sacrifice goats you\nknow in the in the Old Testament then\nand it's just if it was ever useful it's\nnot not especially useful now people\neffortlessly ignore those passages and\nthat's fine so you're you're performing\nediting on the Fly and then you then you\nfind\nyou know a passage in Ecclesiastes or\nJesus giving The Sermon on the Mount and\nyou know either the Golden Rule and you\nsay okay this is this is really\nencapsulates a lot of wisdom and it's\nvery hard to improve on the Golden Rule\nGolden Rule is a fantastic heuristic for\njust living ethically with people so\ngreat there's nothing we need to believe\non insufficient evidence to use the\nGolden Rule as a as a a\num a great the kind of navigation tool\nethically and when you think about\nethics and morality it really is a\nquestion\nof what to do next and we're always\nfaced with this this navigation problem\nessentially because there's this Total\nSpace of at of possible experience\nindividually and collectively and we're\ntrying to figure out how to navigate in\nthis space given that the the possible\nexperiences on offer and the truth is\nthere are Horizons here which we can't\nsee beyond and we don't know how good\nlife could get for us individually and\ncollectively there's so many things that\nare that are in play now I mean we we\nare living in a time where\nit was possible for us to change our own\ngenomes ultimately right I mean there's\nnot not many people doing that at the\nmoment but that is just a few short\nyears away where we're going to be\nconfronted with the question of I mean\ndo you actually want to modify the the\ngenes that are that are expressed in\nyour body and brain uh and even in the\ngerm line you know so we're talking\nabout the inheritance of your your you\nknow future children so we can do in a\nfew short moments what evolution has\nbeen doing for hundreds of thousands of\nyears in our case and millions of\nmillions and millions of years before\nthat so these are choices that that we\nhave always had to make but now we're\nmaking them in the presence of\nincreasingly powerful technology and our\nengagement with with the internet and\ninformation I mean we we have we're\nfinding it hard to even have a\nconversation about the most basic facts\nnow at scale because there's so much\nmisinformation and we much of our\nconversation is being piped through\nthe social media platforms which are\nessentially outraged machines right\nthey're amp preferentially amplifying\nthe the most agitating and uh and um\ndivisive content because that's what\nspreads faster and their employing their\namplifying misinformation more than than\nthe debunking of misinformation right so\nthere's a kind of an asymmetric war of\ninformation here and so we're we're\nsuddenly we've got these\nfunctionally we we have the genes we had\nyou know with it with a few tweaks we\nhad that we have the genes we have maybe\n75 000 years ago right so we are we are\nthese ancient primates now armed with\nnuclear weapons and an internet and\nincreasing and AI technology now and and\nso and we're we're\nfaced with the continually faced with\nthe conundrum of what to do with all of\nthis and how do we solve these massive\ncoordination problems where we get now 8\nbillion strangers essentially to\ncooperate peacefully the landscape of\npossibility here is always shifting\nand so again we have human conversation\nas a as a means by which to navigate\nthis and so yeah I mean to come back\nthis was a very long way of getting back\nto your original question which is\nonce you recognize that our Legacy\nthought structures are not well suited\nto this right so to be a fundamentalist\nChristian or a fundamentalist Buddhist\nor a fundamentalist Hindu in the face of\nthese new opportunities and new\nchallenges is not the best operating\nsystem for your mind\nand you're forced to be\nfar more eclectic and non-sectarian and\nnot non-dogmatic and just open to the\nbest evidence and the best arguments\nreally perpetually open to the best and\nnew evidence and better arguments where\nthe guard rails right there's no longer\nit's no longer simple right I can't I\ncan no longer just consult a single book\nor a single list of do's and don'ts to\nguide to guide me ultimately it's a far\nmore flexible and intelligent way to\nproceed because we want me to just ask\nyourself do you want your next decision\nor your your decision 10 years from now\nto be do you want to be available to the\nbest evidence and the best arguments at\nthat moment when making that decision or\nnot do you want some\nbelief system that guarantees your\nunavailability right do you want some\nkind of cognitive and emotional closure\nthat that that walls you off from better\narguments and better information I think\nI think almost no one would sign up for\nthat kind of uh you know that's\nIgnorance by another name right\nso I think we want to be persuadable we\nwant to be open to better arguments and\nand new evidence we also want to be\nskeptical and and conservative in in how\nwe revise our map of the world because\nwe know that most new you know published\nStudies have sent a very good chance of\nnot being true or you know or not not\nbeing replicatable\neven in science\num we have a legacy we have an\ninheritance of Institutions that have\nproved themselves over generations and\nso we shouldn't be eager to tear\neverything down to the studs and and\nbuild again right but I think we I think\nthere's a there's a reason to be\nconservative with respect to\ninstitutions and norms and I mean things\nthat have worked for\ncenturies there tend to be a reason why\nthey've worked for centuries and so it's\nit's there's a sort of a tinkering and\nan iterative process here that I think\nmakes sense but ultimately yet we want a\nmodern uh wisdom wisdom tradition to be\nthe common property of a non-sectarian\nnon-parochial non-provincial Humanity at\nthis point\nand that but that nicely comes back to\nthe waking up part of your work right\nthe idea that\nwe can't create something or use\nsomething fully aligned with human\nvalues because we as humans aren't fully\naligned with human values in the in the\ncollective sense and the idea that\nI've always felt that the reason why we\nshould be scared of technology is\nbecause\nI guess we're scared of Some Humans so\nif humans have the ability to create\nsomething\nit will have all the imperfections that\nwe have internally in the creator of it\nand so it will inherit all the same\nmanipulative Tendencies exploitative\nTendencies the you know it it's hard to\nfree something of that if you inherently\nbuild something with that yeah and you\nsee that with any sort of media social\nmedia technology today that even if it\nwas built with the best intentions of\ntrying to create good in the world\neither it amplifies negative or\ninherently has some questionable morals\nand ethics to it as well yeah and so it\ncomes back to the waking up part of your\nwork which is this\nself-reflective contemplative idea of\nyou know who am I becoming who do I want\nto be who am I I mean at the very\ndeepest level as you said one one word\nthat I've always loved from my studies\nwas this idea of the word purifying like\nthere was always this there was a\nneeding there was a need for\npurification of\nsome of these elements and you talk\nabout this in the beginning of your book\nwhen you I believe it was one of the\nfirst times you did MDMA and then\nyou you had this feeling of like\ncomplete love for your friend free of\nenvy\nand\nwhen I was reading that I was thinking\nabout how much this word purification is\noften not talked about but\nit's probably my favorite word that I've\nI've learned through my study of the\nwisdom traditions because to me I was\nthinking yeah what's what's really\nrequired as you said is that Love's\nalready there it's already there it's\nnot like you're finding or discovering\nsomething but there's almost like a\ndetoxing a cleansing a letting go of\nthese other things that cloud our\nability to be there is that part of what\nyou're doing what you feel meditation\nachieves or no that's that's a\ncompletely different thing as well\nthe thing you want to accomplish is\nalready accomplished so they're\ndualistic and non-dual ways of\nconceiving this whole the whole path of\npractice\nand that the dualistic way is\nvery much a purification model which is\nthere's something that's like current\ncurrently dirty right and you can clean\nit and you can it's gonna take effort to\nclean it right and so this is and\nI would argue that most spiritual\nTraditions are framed in that way\nand there's definitely a place for that\nbut the mature approach to meditation\npractice is\nand then the one frankly that is just\nfree of of the of the stress of seeking\nis to recognize that that Consciousness\nas it is ordinary consciousness\nregardless of what\nits current contents are regardless of\nwhat you're currently experiencing you\ncould be feeling a classically negative\nemotion I mean you could have just\ngotten angry right and then you remember\noh wait a minute I'm I'm supposed to be\nmeditating okay what it was what I'm\nwhat's true now right and the physiology\nof anger hasn't even had time to\ndissipate yet right so that that'll\nhappen over you know tens of seconds\nright but still in the in this if you\nknow how to recognize\nyou know what what I call over and\nwaking up into Consciousness without\nwithout a center\nin that first moment of just just\nrecognizing that you are the condition\nin which anger and everything else is\nappearing\nthere's already no Center to that\ncondition there's already no ego in the\nmiddle of it and it doesn't actually get\nemptier of self than that ever and it's\nand even if you have a very different\nexperience I mean you take MDMA and you\nfeel unconditional love or you go on a\nlong Meditation Retreat and you get\nreally concentrated and you're having\nyou know just regularly having\nexperiences of bliss say so it can be\nvery you know drug-like all of the those\nchanges in the contents of Consciousness\nare transitory I mean you take a drug\nand it's going to wear off you get very\nconcentrated and you feel Bliss but when\nyou're you know watching Netflix two\nweeks later you're not you're not\nconcentrated in that way and you're\ndoing you're doing something else with\nyour attention and presumably you're not\ngoing to be blissed out in the same way\nso all of those changes in the contents\nare temporary what's not temporary is\nthe availability of this recognition\nthat there's just this open condition\nwhich everything is spontaneously\nappearing thoughts and sights and sounds\nand Sensations and emotions and moods\nand the energetics of experience\nis always occurring in a condition that\nis is fundamentally mysterious really I\nmean it's not because if you engage it\nprior to Concepts I mean you there's a\nlayer at which you can just think about\nit and describe it in psychological\nterms there's a lot to understand to you\nknow correlating changes in our minds\nwith changes in the brain right so\nthere's a there's a there's a possible\nNeuroscience of of contemplative\nexperience and people are doing that\nwork but as a matter of your own\nexperience\nthere's this ever present mystery that\nanything is any way at all I mean like\nyou don't know what you're going to\nthink next until the thought itself\narises right it's just because you'd\nhave to think it before you thought it\nin order to to know what it is right so\nit's just on some level you are a\nwitness\nto everything that's appearing and\nin the beginning it feels like the\nwitness has the structure of a self of a\nsubject\nbut as you look into that more and more\nthat structure goes away and there's\njust this condition in which everything\nis appearing and it does it and that\ndoesn't feel like I it doesn't feel like\nme and whatever feels like I or me is\nyet more appearance you know it's it can\nbe a just a pattern of energy on your\nface or a contraction in the body so as\nyou keep dropping back and witnessing\nthat\nit has you know the purification model\nmakes less and less sense because\nwhat is there to purify right there's\nnot like even even I mean even anger is\nno longer anger right in the moment of\nwreck of recognition\nit's just this it's just a feeling of of\nheat on your face right it's just a\nfeeling it's just it's a feeling of\ntension in your chest and there's no one\nto whom those feelings refer right and\nand so the moment you recognize that you\nhave by definition broken the connection\nto whatever thoughts we're telling you\nwhy you were angry and why you should be\nangry and why you every every right to\nbe angry and what you're going to say to\nthat person next time you see them\nyou've broken that spell of thinking and\nso the the emotion is dissipating uh and\nso it's um\nanger is no longer anger right but it's\nin purification mode\nit is still possible to do that\ndualistically I mean in the beginning\nwhen you're practicing that what I tend\nto teach in over a waking up is is a\ntechnique called mindfulness which most\npeople engage dualistically in the\nbeginning where they're strategically\nbeing aware of sights and sounds and\nSensations and the breath and and um and\nthoughts and emotions and so even do\neven dualistically\nyou can learn\nthe difference between being lost and\nthought and identified with an emotional\nlike anger and\njust witnessing it from the point that\nseems to be outside of that thought and\nthat that emotion\nand even if it feels like a subject\nthat's paying attention strategically to\nto the physiology of anger or or the\nHorizon cessation of thought\nthat's fine I mean that's a that's a\nstarting point that's\nand a necessary one for virtually\neveryone\num\nand that does accomplish this\nde-identification from the whole process\nthat's giving you this negative emotion\nso there is a freedom even in the\ndualistic awareness of\nof you know the flow of thought and\nemotion But ultimately and and that very\nmuch has this character of purifying the\nmind it's like you're like this is this\nis a\nanger is a classically negative thing to\nbe stuck in and identified with and\nacting out of and it's divisive it's\nyou're going to say the thing you regret\nand that for what you have to apologize\nfor and you see this is just you know\nyou're and the normal person who doesn't\nknow how to be mindful and doesn't\ndoesn't know the difference between\nbeing lost and thought and and not is is\nreally the mere hostage of that process\nthey're going to stay as angry as\nthey're going to stay for as long as\nthey're going to stay that way and\nthey're going to do all of the things\nthat are life deranging and and\nreputation harming they might do on the\nbasis of that emotion for as long as\nthey're going to do those things and\nthen they're going to have all the\nreaction to what they did and said and\nit's that's the the complication of Life\nBorn of that you know one moment where\nyou got angry even dualistic mindfulness\ngives you a degree of Freedom that most\npeople don't have and it is a kind of\nsuperpower to be able to say oh well I\njust got angry\nhow long do I want to stay angry for for\nme an emotion like anger or fear\nis useful insofar as it is it is a\nsalience cue it's telling you that\nsomething just happened that's worth\npaying attention to right so there's\nsomebody just walked into the room who\nyou know doesn't have your your\nwell-being uh at heart you know at heart\nright and they've got some intention\nthat is that is um\nin conflict with\nuh was something that you were trying to\naccomplish today or um it's telling at\nminimum is telling you something about\nyourself and about your own priorities\nand about about what you were trying to\ndo in the world and you know for better\nor worse uh so it's worth paying\nattention to but\nit's almost never the state of mind you\nwant to be in to then solve the problem\nyou that just you just noticed so I'm\nnot saying that we the goal is to be\ncompletely without\nany capacity for anger or fear or any\nany of these emotions but it's I I do\nthink psychological health and just the\nhealth of one's relationships and and\njust the whole project of living wisely\nin the world is more and more\nthe result of being able to get off to\nunhook from that negative emotion more\nand more quickly I mean I think you want\nto stay angry and fearful and even sad\nfor in a much shorter periods of time\nand and then you can you then there's\nthere's just more to recognize about the\ncircumstance it gives you a degree of\nFreedom by which to navigate yeah no I I\nfully agree with that I I've\nI've whenever I get asked that question\nwhich I'm sure you get asked a lot is\nlike well don't you ever get angry or\ndon't you ever you know\nget upset or sad and and what you just\nsaid has always been my response that I\nstill feel anger I still feel sadness I\nstill feel Envy I still and always\nbelieve I always will\nfeel all of these things just for less\nand less time yeah and that I don't\nthink I'll ever get to zero just as you\ncould never run a mile in zero right\nseconds I won't ever get to a point\nwhere I'm able to deal with it in zero\nseconds it's just not going to be\npossible right because it needs to live\nI think there are\nmore impersonal\nand ethically necessary\nmodes for these emotions that that I\ndon't think we want to get rid of them I\nthink I think\noutrage moral outrage has its place\nand it is the basis from which we would\nwe would react to grave Injustice in the\nworld but it's not it doesn't have to be\nit's not a personal anger right but it\ncan it just you see so you see something\nsome unnecessary harm being created\ndeliberately by you know deeply unwise\npeople in the world and and you just\nthink all right this is\nthis is an emergency this is worth\nresponding to right and and it's and\nthat can feel the energy of anger can be\nbehind that and you know so I mean I\nwould tend to call that outrage rather\nthan anger but they I think moral\noutrage is is useful but it's just the\nquestion is\nwhen does it tip over into\npersonal psychological suffering that\nactually diminishes Your Capacity to do\nsomething useful and that's that's where\nthat's the the line that I think we want\nto be more aware of yeah let's use that\nas an example and take it through that\nprocess because I think that's that's\nexactly it like I was gonna bring that\nup earlier the idea that\njust as the outrage or the emotional\nexperience can stop us from being\npractical so too not to go down this\nroad again but so too can the skeptical\nlike if you know you can be overly\nskeptical and overly analytical and\nnever practically apply anything because\nyou can constantly find flaws in pretty\nmuch most ideas in the world if you keep\nlooking for them yeah so let's take the\noutrage idea like how do you what does\nsomeone do they feel their outrage the\nmoral outrage where they feel pain for\nthe suffering of another\nwhere do you go from there through your\nprocess like what's step two three four\nwell I think it's important to\nbe again\ncautious and and and skeptical of One's\nOwn\nemotional hijacking right so it's like\nyou want to know you want to know that\nthis isn't a personal Petty you know\negocentric reaction yes and it actually\nis born of what it purports to be you\nknow a compassionate engagement with the\nworld like you actually want the best\nfor other people perhaps including\nyourself but also I mean it's like we're\nall on the same team that's that's the\nthe mode that you're you're in and so\nit's not\nan expression of your own greed and\nnarcissism and and you know kind of the\nA self-focused and and divisive\num emotion\nbut it probably will start at that right\nwell I think it can have\nsomething of that character in that it's\nit can have the character of contraction\nI mean outrage feels like anger it's\nlike you you know you it is the same\nthing that would get you to raise your\nvoice if you were angry right it's like\nit's like you're going to raise your\nvoice if you're going to raise your\nvoice in defense of humanity right\num well you're still raising your voice\nyeah and so it's just that there's\nenergy behind it and I think that energy\nat times is is necessary or to take\nanother somewhat adjacent situation but\nanalogous\nit's like you know if you're in a\na situation in which you have to to\ndefend yourself from from actual\nphysical violence or defend someone\nclose to you you know someone's attacked\nyou and your child so what should you do\nthey're just gonna lie down and and and\noffer yourself up as a human sacrifice\nno I like I think pacifism is not\nactually the morally the wisest position\nethically so I think the energy that\nwould allow you to to violently defend\nyourself against an aggressor\num should be available right but the\nquote is but it is you know it's not\nnecessarily anger\nbut it could look a lot like anger and\nfeel a lot like anger it's certainly not\nnecessarily hatred and and here I would\nI would ask you to consider how you\nwould feel like I mean defending\nyourself against a person\nyou know you think of somebody is there\nsome you know malicious psychopath who's\nwho's broken into your house and is now\nwanting to harm you and your family\nbecause that's you know what he likes to\ndo right that's like the quintessential\ncircumstance where one you'd feel you'd\nfeel fear you'd feel a lot of things but\nyou'd probably also feel hatred for this\nperson right like what there's a few\ncircumstances where hatred feels more\napropos than that but\nI do view hatred as always being\nsomehow extra even in extremists like\nthat because imagine just how you would\nfeel very superficially similar\nsituation you know you're still\nyou have an attacker in your house and\nyou have to defend yourself violently\nbut that attacker now is not a person\nit's a it's a wild animal you know a\ngrizzly bear is has broken into your\nhouse or you know a mountain lion right\nhow you still it's still a an absolute\nemergency right you're still gonna have\nto fight for your life you're still\nlooking for a weapon to defend yourself\nwith right you still contemplating\nkilling a living being to defend\nyourself right and your kids\nbut there's an emotional shading there\nlike you as energized as you would be\nin the presence of a mountain lion or in\nthe presence of a grizzly bear\nthere's this layer of the layer of\nhatred doesn't quite fit you know\nbecause you feel they have less Choice\nyes of course a mountain lion is going\nto be a mountain lion you know it's like\nlike a mountain lion can't be other than\na mountain lion\non some level a malicious psychopath\ncan't be other than a malicious\npsychopath right so I think it's I think\nwe do have to view people\non some level as\nequivalent to forces of nature right you\nknow we don't we don't get angry at\nhurricanes but and we certainly don't\nhate hurricanes in in the same way that\nwe could hate another human being\nbut if we could lock hurricanes in\nprison we would right they're immensely\ndestructive you know we're still trying\nto figure out what to do about them but\nit never gets we never take this extra\nstep of actually hating them and I do\nthink we could have we ethically\nspeaking and psychologically speaking\nwe can we can have a similar\nrelationship to even the worst human\nbeings while doing all the things we\nneed to do to defend ourselves against\nthem we can put people in prison we can\nyou know we can\nI'm not in favor of the death penalty\nfor for\nactually these reasons but um because I\ndon't think anyone creates themselves I\nthink I don't think anyone is truly at\nbottom responsible responsible for being\nwho they are I mean if you had the same\ngenes and the same life experience of\nwhoever Jeffrey Dahmer you'd be Jeffrey\nDahmer right it's like there's no\nthere's no mystery there but\num\nso I think so I think at bottom\nwhen you're when you're looking at these\nthese just very Stark differences in\nlife outcomes you're looking at\ndifferences in luck right I mean there's\nthere's biological luck there's\ncircumstantial luck there's all kinds of\nluck\nand there's and there's what we do with\nthe luck but your capacity to do good\nthings with even your bad luck is yet\nmore good luck right I mean something is\ngiving you there's some genetic and\nenvironmental reason why you are set up\nto pick yourselves up pick yourself up\nby your bootstraps when somebody else in\nthe similar situation wasn't right and\nso on some level there's we have an\nethical imperative to acknowledge\nthe the massive role that luck plays in\nour lives and I think we should want to\ncancel the the most egregious\ndifferences in good and bad luck between\npeople like so when we look at a a whole\nsociety that is suffering from immense\nbad luck because it didn't have the\nnatural resources that some other\nSociety did or it had those resources\nbut even those resources created\nperverse incentives and so it's got some\nterrible terrible political outcome\nbased on all the level of corruption\nthis layered on top of the resources I\nmean there's just terrible disparities\nin luck there right and so I think we as\na as a global civilization more and more\nas we grow grow wealthier and wealthier\nand and and can take advantage of of\ngood luck over here we should want to\nengineer a tide that raises the the upon\nwhich most or all boats Rise\num more and more it's not to say that\ncapitalism is wrong it's not to say that\nwe're ever going to completely nullify\ndifferences in luck and and I think some\nasymmetries may in fact be the optimal\nway to to encourage people's creativity\nand Innovation right so it's like it's\nit's I'm not I'm agnostic as to on some\nof the questions of how to organize a\nsociety and an economy there but I do\nthink more and more we need to recognize\nthat\nso many of us I mean certainly anyone\nhas got the free time to to listen to\nthis conversation right now stands a\npretty good chance of being in the top\n10 or even one percent of humanity with\nrespect to luck you know all the\nvariables whether it's respect to health\nand wealth and education and just just\nhaving the free time and attention to\nlisten to this and be interested in this\nand to be to be asking the kinds of\nquestions we're trying to address in a\nconversation like this\nwe're immensely lucky and with that\ncomes a a certain\nresponsibility but also opportunity to\nto spread the the luck around yeah yeah\nto create love for others yeah yeah yeah\nyeah absolutely yeah I loved where we\nwere going with that and loved where we\nwent but going back to the\nthe outrage piece the understanding of\nyou know almost differentiating our\nhate from outraged almost extracting\nsome piece of the ego from it being\npetty and individualistic but that it's\nfor a greater cause\nthen yeah how do you go forward with\nthat like what do you do with that\nthought that idea that feeling so you\nyou feel pain when someone else is in\npain you feel stressed you feel\noutrageous you said there may be a petty\npersonal anger to it that triggered Us\nin the first place but we were able to\ncarve that out and understand that that\nwasn't the basis of our real outrage\nthat there was something bigger yeah\nwell it just then it really just depends\non what the the problem is and what the\nsituation is and whether you can\ninfluence it right I mean if you can't\ndo anything about it well then it's not\nuseful to be just grinding your gears\nwithout rage I mean that your outrage\nneeds some kind of Outlet you know so if\nyou have some kind of platform upon\nwhich to to try to make sense on these\nimportant topics well then do that but\nyeah it's it's it's never useful to just\nbe privately seething with with outrage\nthat has no Outlet right so you have to\nfigure out one what what pragmatically\ncan you do to accomplish anything useful\non the basis of this emotion uh and if\nthere's nothing to do it's great to have\nthe tools by which you can just let go\nof it right it's like and that's um\nand again that's where meditation or it\ncomes into me that really is a kind of\nsuperpower you can just decide okay\nthere's nothing to do here with this\nnegative emotion\nso now I can just let go of it and\nthat's um and that's it's true for\npublic-facing emotion like outrage but\nit's true for a\nand inwardly facing one like just\nanxiety about something that is coming\nup in the future right so like you've\ngot some medical condition\nnow you need to get an MRI to see if\nyou've got something scary\nand you can't get the MRI until next\nTuesday right so now you've got this\ntime to wait so the question is in the\ninterview intervening days\nhow captured are you going to be by this\nfeeling of anxiety is is there any\nutility in feeling anxious between now\nand Tuesday and if there's not wouldn't\nit be great to actually just let go of\nit right and most people feel like\nthat's\nthat's pretty hard to do right I mean\nmost people don't have tools apart from\njust diverting themselves getting\ndistracting themselves with something\nelse to take their mind off the thing\nthat they're really sort of thinking\nabout in the background that they don't\nwant to think about but they're\nhelplessly you know perseverating on it\nbut as far as you know as far as as far\nas acting in the world so as to make the\nworld a better place I I think you know\nbased on outrage or or some other\nemotion you know I'm impressed more and\nmore by\nhow much that's a story of changing\nincentives at the system level\nmore than it is a story of improv\ngetting individuals to improve\nthemselves I think I think individuals\nshould want to improve themselves and I\nyou know I want to improve myself and I\nyou know in so far as I can share wisdom\nabout how to do that I I do that you\nknow more or less full time\nbut there's a there's another level of\nanalysis and another level of discussion\nthat needs to be applied to the to the\nsystems in which we're all functioning\nand we need to recognize that in so many\nplaces we have systems of incentives\nthat are aligned\nso as to make it actually hard to be a\ngood person right like you need you need\nto be some kind of moral hero to be\ntruly ethical given how the system is\ntuned and conversely\ntotally normal people can be lured into\nbehaving more and more like psychopaths\nin a badly tuned system where the\nincentives are all wrong right and I\nthink more and more we need to be alert\nto that and we need to want to Design\nSystems\nwhere it just becomes easier and easier\nfor ordinary conflicted you know\nmediocre people people who are not even\nthinking about ethics all that much\nright don't don't want to they just want\nwhat they want\nit's easier for them\nto behave more and more like Saints\nbecause the incentives are aligned that\nway to take a um example that's\nrecently top of mind so like we have a\nproblem with the problem of climate\nchange you know we will well-intentioned\npeople want to do something about it we\ndon't want to create the most\nprofligate harms for ourselves\nunnecessarily right so it'd be great to\nhave a system of incentives and economic\nopportunities and technologies that just\nmade it easier and easier to be wise\nwith respect to carbon or carbon\nfootprint and\nthere are a lot of great ideas in this\nspace and you know one of them is let's\nbuy electric cars right let's transition\nfrom a a fossil fuel economy of\ntransportation to an electric one well\nthat sounds wonderful and I've you know\nI've just I've had an electric car and\nI've I just had to get a new car and I\nwas poised to buy an electric another\nelectric car but then I hear on Joe\nRogan's podcast from this guy who's just\npublished a book it's coming out um\nif I forgive me I've forgotten his name\nI think it's uh\nI think it's sriram Krishnan but I could\nhave that wrong but he he's put his book\ncoming out called Cobalt red but he just\ndid a two-hour uh podcast with Rogan\nwhich was just this Litany of Horrors\nthat attend\nwhat it the the extraction of cobalt\nfrom Congo right it's like 70 two\npercent of the world's Cobalt is in\nCongo we use Cobalt in all of our\nbatteries basically our supply chain for\nCobalt is on top of just slave labor and\nand child labor and just you know kids\ngetting buried alive I mean it's just it\nwas just as bad as you could imagine uh\nand so how here we have a system where\nwe all we just we all want to buy the\nnext electric car because it's the good\nthing that the the this was The Virtuous\nthing to do but now we find out that the\nbatteries are are soaked in blood\nthere's no good option right and now we\nhave to we and we have to pretend that\nthat we didn't hear that podcast or the\nthe and the people you know Bill\ndesigning the batteries or pretending\nthat I don't know where the Cobalt comes\nfrom and there's like we need to figure\nout I mean this is this this itself it\nshould be a simple problem to solve and\nit would just it's probably\na few percentage points of profit margin\nthat would make the extraction of cobalt\na an ethically\ndefensible practice right and that's\nprobably there's probably some Cobalt\nfree technology uh that we could design\nin the future but it's just to get these\nthings right\nreally matters and if you don't get them\nright you've got people who are deeply\nconflicted about what they're doing or\nnot or just not completely unaware of\nwhat they're doing and creating these\nthese massive negative externalities\nthat they might not even know about like\nlike I could I literally was I was 24\nhours from buying another EV right so\nit's like it's not that it's not that my\nloan purchase or not or or not of a\nsingle car is going to matter that much\nin the scheme of things but it's like I\nwould have had I not heard this\nparticular episode of Joe's podcast I\nwould have bought that EV thinking I was\ndoing an unimpeachably virtuous thing\nright and now I have a much more\nconflicted decision to make around you\nknow what's the right car to drive in\nlight of my climate change concerns this\nis just to say that\nthe individual\ncan't solve the Cobalt supply chain\nproblem right so like we need we need\nthese solutions to come at the system\nlevel and at the institution level and\nand that's and that's where\nbeing a good person\nis is\nsort of beyond the scope of anyone's\nindividual choices like like you need to\nwe need to collectively solve\na massive coordination problem together\nwhere\nin the act of getting gratifying our\ndesires we are we are are\ncreating less and less harm and doing\nmore and more good more or less\neffortlessly and that's and that really\nis you can have people who are just not\nthinking about\npurifying anything\nbehaving and really impeccable ways\ngiven good incentives and that's that's\nuh some more and more I'm thinking about\nthat yeah I love that you're thinking\nabout that and I think it's uh an idea\nto perform though is that it's also that\nthe people that are setting up the\ninstitutions and the systems are also\nindividuals so it's like a vicious cycle\nit's like the lead is at the top the\npeople have made all these decisions to\ngo out and you know take all this Cobalt\nand make sure that it was picked by\nchild slaves or child labor or whatever\nit may be I haven't listened to the\npodcast so I don't have the context\nbut someone made that decision and some\nsystem never thought to correct that\nbecause that was led by some people so I\nthink I mean I I agree with you but I\nthink it's both it's like you know\nI think even where systems have been\nmade tight you still see people trying\nto find a loophole I mean that's how the\nhuman mind is set up\nand so you've got the the loophole\nmindset of like okay well let me find a\nway to exploit this or manipulate this\ntowards my benefit anyway right and so\nyou've got both I I think both are\nimportant I think like if you were the\ndecision maker yeah if you were building\nEVS you would be able to make that\nsystem in your company and you'd set it\nout but that would come back to you yeah\nyeah but it could like if we taxed\ncarbon\ninstead of taxing incomes yeah yeah I\ndon't know how that works out in terms\nof the balance sheet but something like\nthat so we're we're dis we're using a\ntax to disincentivize something we\nwanted disincentivize pollution and\nwe're not penalizing something that's\nintrinsically good just you know\ncreating value and being paid for that\nvalue which is you know what income in\nthe best cases coming from\nso there's that and like all of a sudden\npeople all right if if it's costing me\nmoney to be polluting well then I'm\ngoing to figure out how to not do that\nand\nuh that's just going to be my our\ninterests are going to be a line there\nright yeah and so there's probably you\nknow 100 or a thousand cases like that\nbut where I was going was um I've been\nthinking a lot about uh\nwhat has come to be called the effect of\naltruism movement I mean just how to do\ngood yeah more reliably more\nsystematically yeah many of us have been\ndisillusioned with with how philanthropy\nhas been done traditionally as like\nthere's a\nthere's a distinction between this\nactually comes back to um some of what\nwe've been talking about with the the\ndifference between\nbeing led by one's emotions and actually\nunderstanding what the outcomes are in\nthe in the world that one is\naccomplishing when you're trying to do\ngood in the world when you're let's say\nyou're giving to a you know a a\nchildren's hospital say I mean that just\nseems an intrinsically good thing to do\nbut so much we know that so much of our\nimpulse to do good or impulse toward\naltruism or impulse toward effective\ncompassion\nis driven by the the com the single\ncompelling story The Single you know the\nsingle identifiable protagonist you know\nthe one little girl who's you know got\ncancer and we can help her right and\nthat we sort of go to sleep\nwhen we're told statistics right so like\nwe don't we we perversely we care more\nabout the one little girl than we care\nabout the tens of thousands of little\ngirls just like her maybe even the tens\nof thousands of little girls including\nher right it's like you you can run\npsychological experiments where you you\nshow people one little girl and you ask\nthem how how much they're inclined to\nhelp and how much money they'd give they\ngive the maximum amount you know under\nthose conditions if you show them the\nsame little girl and you layer on a\nstory of just how many of their other\ngirls there are like her they're the\npeople's compassionate impulse reliably\ndiminishes right so this is this is\nclearly a moral bug of our operating\nsystem so we know that the the the good\nfeels we get from giving are separable\nfrom the from the actual effects of of\nour of our given in the world\nso anyway I thought you know more about\nthis I've brought on you know various\nmoral philosophers to to speak about\nthis on but both on the app and on my\npodcast and\none change I made in response to one of\nthese conversations with I just decided\nthat waking up as a company would give a\nminimum of 10 of his profits to to the\nmost effective Charities each year and I\npersonally would give a minimum of 10 of\nmy pre-tax income to charity each year\nnow I was I was already giving money\naway to charity and that felt good but\nonce I decided all right here's the\nformula I have to give this minimum\namount this this minimum amount is\nalready allocated to these ends and\nwhat's more of these ends have to be not\njust Charities and causes that I feel\nreally personally engaged by or just\nthings that I want to support like you\nknow some and I want to give money to\ncollege or Symphony or if that's like\nsomething that I or or I see somebody's\nGoFundMe page and it tugs at my\nheartstrings I want to give money to\nthat no that's that's all separate here\nhere's 10 percent that's going to\nCharities that I uh in the kind of sober\nrational analysis have decided are going\nto do the most good irrespective of how\nI feel about these things because there\nare certain causes that\nI just don't find especially sexy you\nknow they're just not like I just can't\nI have to continually rethink my my\ninterest in them you know but they are\nobjectively\nif you want to want to save a life you\nknow per unit per dollar put into the\nsystem this is the best use of your your\ndollars right so if one has been you\nknow malaria mitigation in sub-Saharan\nAfrica just just malarial bed nets right\nlike that's I just can't get too excited\nabout handing out bed nets right but\nthat's something that's worth supporting\nso I just decided that okay the you know\ngivewell.org has done run this analysis\nthey're a great uh uh source of\ninformation about effective charities\nhere are their top 10 Charities whether\nI find these sexy or not I know I can\nOutsource the cognitive labor to these\npeople because I've spoken to them\nenough I've analyzed what they've done\nthey're doing enough this is their\nfull-time job all right until I hear\notherwise I'm going to take their advice\nit doesn't matter how I feel about these\nCharities right I'm going to get my good\nfeels elsewhere but what's happened is\nonce I decided that\nI'm going to give this amount of money\nto charity each year and it's happening\nby default whether I'm thinking about it\nor not whether I'm gratified by it or\nnot a very interesting thing flipped one\nis when I confront all these other\nopportunities to give money away that\nare are tugging on my Heartstrings\nthey almost show up as a as a kind of\nguilty pleasure like I literally have\nhad the feeling of giving money to a\nchildren's hospital or giving money to\nto somebody's GoFundMe page and it's\nit's almost\nleveraging the same greedy circuits in\nthe brain as you'd get if you're like\nopening a catalog if and you want\neverything on you know both Pages it's\nlike it's like like it is a it's it's a\nvery visceral experience of\nselfishness and selflessness totally\nmerging and it's like it's like why is\nselfishness is the same thing as\nselflessness but it has the energy of\nlike I really I want to do this and\nbecause I sort of know I'm I've I've\nrationally allocated to this a certain\namount to doing this good kind of\nautomatically sort of even out of sight\nand out of mind I'm not spending a lot\nof time thinking about where that money\nis going it sort of changed my\nrelationship to all these other\noccasions where I'm having to decide on\nthe basis of my intuitions moment to\nmoment whether I want to give and how\nmuch to give and it's it's really just\nkind of flipped everything upside down\nin a way that's interesting and again\nit's it's all based on having made a\nsort of system level default change that\nis\na sort of hidden structure in which I'm\nnow moving right I'm not it's because\nagain I'm not\nuntil you make a decision like that\nyou're constantly rethinking what you\nwant to do it's almost like going on a\ndiet like if you decide I don't need\nDairy anymore right so once you don't\neat dinner anymore I eat a lot of dairy\nbut but if one it didn't eat dairy\nanymore you just it's just a bright line\nand then you you not you're not\nconstantly rethinking whether you're\ngoing to have ice cream and if so how\nmuch and and so it's massively\nclarifying that's that's a great example\nthat really hit true yeah the the\nclarity of constraints right having\nhaving borders and boundaries and\nconstraints uh allowing you to not waste\nas much time and energy\non\non figuring that out Moment by moment\nyeah I've got I've got two more\nquestions for you Sam that I I want to\nmake sure I ask you today how does\nsomeone like you as a meditator for so\nmany years as someone who's so\nthoughtful about these topics there's\nsomeone who wants to see change in the\nsystems and institutions as well how do\nyou interact with the news because I\nfind that to be such a source of anxiety\nand stress for so many people who are\nprobably listening to us right now and\nso I'd love to hear how you've built a\nhealthier hopefully systematic logical\nrelationship with the news Well it\nchanged recently for me because I uh\ndeleted my Twitter account which is\nwhere I was getting a lot of my news I\nwas not getting the news from Twitter\nper se but I was just seeing I was\nfollowing lots of smart people and\nseeing what articles they were\nrecommending and social going through\nthat as a it was it was kind of like my\nnews feed\nuh so I still you know I read the New\nYork Times I read the Atlantic there's\nso many things I read and I and uh so I\nI see the news in various channels but\nI was using Twitter as the first filter\non that and that for a variety of\nreasons became\num\nreally toxic for me and and toxic in a\nway that\nI was convinced was misleading I mean\nthat was the thing that got me to\nfinally just rip the Band-Aid off\nbecause I it wasn't just that I was\nseeing the worst of people and that was\nhaving a certain effect\nI was convinced I was seeing people at\ntheir worst who are actually not as bad\nas they were seeming to me on Twitter\nlike what Twitter was calling out of\nthem was just a misleading picture of\nwho they actually are because in some\ncases I would knew I knew the people in\nreal life and then I'm seeing them\nbehave in abominable ways on Twitter and\nI just think all right this is\nthis is an all this is just a fun house\nmirror that isn't psychological\npsychologically healthy to keep staring\ninto day after day after day and also\njust so many of the things that I was it\nwas it was amplifying stories that I was\nyou know as a podcaster I was tempted to\nreact to and I felt like I was getting a\nmisleading signal as to just how Salient\nor representative those stories are of\nthe way the world is right so like it's\njust it was just the phenomenon being\ntoo online ultimately right\nyeah so my real so insofar as Twitter\nwas news or or a simulacrum of news that\nhas really changed for me I just I just\nam not seeing it and\nnow I just um yeah I mean I have a few\nsources of of news that I I go to as uh\nyou know more or less reflexively\nbut again it's it's um\nmore and more I'm asking the question\nyou know what do I want my moment to\nmoment life to be like you know and who\ndo I want to be at the end of the day\nwhen I'm hanging out with my wife and\nkids right and and what are the\nconsequences of having spent\nmy attentional budget over the previous\nhours in one way versus another and I\nmean Twitter for me honestly was it was\na big change because it was like getting\nout of an unhealthy relationship the\nmatter was just yeah but for all my talk\nabout meditation and being able to\nunhook from anger and other states\nI mean I could unhook and I could let go\nof of negative motion and Etc and it's\nnot that the tools don't work but\nI was spending a lot of time looking\ninto this very deranging space and it's\nnot arranging for everybody but for me\nbecause what's unique about my job and\nabout or my approach to my job is that\nyou know I criticize the right and left\npolitically you know a lot and you know\nwith sort of equal ferocity and so I get\nso I'm not I'm not tribally aligned with\nanyone and I get a lot of pain from both\nsides and it's it's a lot of it's It's\nnot honest pain it's not like it's it's\nnot like honest criticism of views I\nactually hold it's like lots of lying\nabout views that I don't hold and you\nknow it's just it's just\nmisrepresentations and people take you\nknow Clips out of context and I mean\npeople people cut together clips of my\npodcast that where I am seeming to say\nthe opposite of what I in fact said in\ncontext and they release those and\npeople with big platforms you know\nretweet them so it's a it's a it was a\npervasive experience for me\nof seeing myself\nlied about and then wondering whether\nthere's anything I should do about that\nright and so it was this very sticky\ninvitation to getting sucked in because\nlike okay that's not what I said that's\nnot what I meant now I'm seeing the\nevidence of lots of people being misled\nby this misrepresentation and it bothers\nme and I'm pretty sure it should bother\nme because I like this is not the\noutcome I want right and it's not why I\nhave a podcast it's not why I went on\nthat other person's podcast and so\nthere's some burden on me to try to\nclarify the misunderstanding and I was\ncontinually getting sucked into the\nillusion that clarification was possible\nright so I would try because I really\nwanted to use Twitter as a Channel of\ncommunication was the only social media\nplatform I ever used I never used\nFacebook or I may have Facebook and\nInstagram accounts but those are just\nmarketing you know channels for my team\nI'm never on those so I was on Twitter\nit really was me and I was\nyou know as much as I could step away\nfrom it because it seemed unhealthy for\na time I kept seeing the evidence of\nconfusion and misrepresentation I\nthought I was just I'm just going to try\nagain to clarify things right and that\nwas that was such an unrewarding\nexperience that it was just it was it\nwas creating a residue of of\num Despair and contempt I mean I just I\njust felt I just felt polluted by I just\nfelt like I had met\nlike all the psychopaths in the world on\na daily basis like there can't be as\nmany psychopaths in the world as I was\nseen to be meeting online as much as I\ncould step away from it and just and and\nput it down I kept picking it up again\nand so I just thought this is crazy so\nso I I just ripped it off\num and that's been an immense change I\nmean it's really it's so sometimes you\nneed to actually do the thing that is\nyou can't just keep yeah putting\nyourself in this dysfunctional situation\nand then processing your reaction it's\nlike you have to ask yourself why are\nyou doing this why are you spending your\ntime and attention this way in the first\nplace yeah and so for me it was Twitter\nI mean I understand other people you\nknow depending on what they could just\nbe put if they're sharing cat videos on\nTwitter they're just getting nothing but\nlove right they have no idea what I'm\ntalking about but trust me it's possible\nto have a truly lousy experience on\nTwitter what if anything would bring you\nback because I love what you're saying\nthere that you know if if you're doing\nthe same thing it's giving you the same\nresult you've tried a new thing with it\nit's giving you the same result\nsometimes you have to cut it off to\ncreate a healthier balance to\nreconfigure to to do the work you want\nto do what if anything would allow you\nto go back to it or how would you see\nyourself if you were to go back to in a\nhealthier way I'm thinking of all the\npeople who cut things out their lives\nbecause they need to feel that distance\nfrom it because it's taken a hold of\nthem but then they know that in reality\nthey might have to go back at one point\nyeah well I'm not planning to go back I\ndon't I don't really see that I don't I\ndon't think I made for marketing I don't\nneed it yeah well I miss it I miss the\ngood parts of it yeah that's what I mean\nyeah because I was following a lot of\nsmart funny people and that was\nentertaining but the truth is even the\ngood parts\nwere\nultimately\ndiverting in a way that in retrospect\nfeels like a bit of a just a waste of\ntime you know it's just like I'm getting\num I didn't have to spend as much time\neven with the good parts of it you know\nit's just it was kind of like\nyou know just like too many carbs in\nthat part of my information diet you\nknow that's what Twitter was it was all\ncarbs I mean if I went back I would just\nyeah I would probably use it much more\nlike I I use or don't even use my other\nsocial media channels I would just use\nit as I would have someone pose for me\nor I would post without ever looking\nabout it was coming back at me and\nthey're people there are people who get\na lot of negative stuff coming back at\nthem and they just never see it because\nthey just never look and that's\num I could have been one of those people\nand I was that sort of person for you\nknow some periods of time but I just\nkept\ngetting lured by the technology by the\npromise of clarifying confusion you know\nbecause here are the like the the person\njust said something to me and I can say\nsomething back you know why not you know\nand for strangely it did none of the\nother social media platforms have ever\nhooked hooked me in that way I've never\nbeen tempted to get on Facebook or\nInstagram and use it in that way and I'm\nnot looking for a substitute for Twitter\nso that that is interesting there's many\nand people are recommending substitutes\nwhere they're you know building their a\nnew platform you know they got off\nTwitter for whatever reason\num but it's not I'm just not tempted to\nfill that the Twitter shaped hole in my\nlife with anything else so that's good I\nlove that all right and then one last\nquestion before we dive into the final\nfive uh is we spoke about this right at\nthe beginning and you mentioned the you\nknow\nthe problem the impermanence problem\nlike how do you see yourself thinking\nabout or meditating on or preparing for\ndeath or the the impermanence of life\nlike how how does that\ncome into your consciousness\nwell there are really two sides to it I\nmean there's there's your own death and\nthen there's the deaths of everyone you\ncare about and that's those are really\ndifferent problems in a way and it's um\nyeah so when I when I think of the the\nexperience of having those close to me\ndie that's\num I mean I know I mean it's already\nhappened I've gone through that with in\nthe cases of certain people and\nyou know if if I'm lucky enough to live\na long time well then it's gonna it's\ngonna happen so I'm sure many times\nagain and\nI mean it's fundamentally mysterious\nthing I mean the the fact that we drop\nout the bottom of this place is just\nit's it's truly imponderable you know\nand\nyet I know that it's possible\nto be happy\nin the absence of everyone right I mean\nthere's some paradoxes here like you and\nI are having this conversation now\nbasically everyone we love is not here\nyou know like you and I just met you\nknow so it's like so we're just we're\njust getting to know each other you know\nmy mom's not here my wife's not here my\nkids are not here you've got your list\nof people you love who are not here it's\nokay to not be with the people we love\nso we know that right and to take the\nother side like what it's like to to\npersonally die say\nyou know we we go to sleep each night\nand we we not always not only is it okay\nto completely relinquish our hold on\nthis world I mean we we we we yearn for\nit like if you're if you've got insomnia\nif you can't fall asleep that becomes a\nproblem you're desperate to lose your\nyour scene and hearing and smelling and\ntasting and touching and thinking of you\nyou just want to you want to completely\nget zeroed out every night and\nthat's you know if if nothing happens\nafter death I mean people we can leave\naside the possibility that that they're\nyou know the death is on in sometimes an\nillusion but if Dad if you really just\nget a dial tone after you die right\nreally there's just nothing it's\nsomewhat analogous to sleep I mean it's\nlike your the lights go out right\nevery night we do that and we do it\nhappily and it's not as there's no you\nknow I guess some people have sleep\nissues where they're afraid to fall\nasleep but that's certainly not the\ncommon case right and so\nto the contrary we yearn for it so\nit is somewhat paradoxical that these\nlike the the worst thing about life the\nthe thing that that people are terrified\nto experience themselves and they're\nterrified to experience in the case of\nof losing the the people they love\nwe in in the most routine way we have\nreally analogous experiences that are\nfine right so like you know you're fine\nalone in a room\nand you're fine to go to sleep and these\nare there's a there's a bit of death in\nboth of these things because you're\neveryone you love really is absent and\nwhen you fall asleep you really forget\neverything about your life in this world\nyou know until you start dreaming and\nthen you're completely confused about\nyour life in some other circumstance\nunless it's a lucid dream which is to\nsay that it's actually it's it's\npossible to be okay\nultimately even\nwith the with the reality of death from\nboth from either side you know I'm not\nI'm so I'm certainly expecting to\nto grieve would the next time someone\nclose to me dies you know I'm not\nexpecting points but but that is a I\nunderstand that as an expression of Love\nfirst of all\nask yourself if you'd even want to be\nwithout the experience of grief I mean I\ncould ask yourself for instance what you\nwould want to do in the event that we\nhad designed\na a perfect cure for grief right like\nI'll say a pill like like the perfect\nit's not an antidepressant but it's an\nanti-sadness pill you know and that's\nnot conceptually incoherent I mean we\nmight one day have that pill you know it\nmight be a pill that you would\ncompassionately wanted like they're\npeople who\nwho are suffering some just intractable\nunendurable bereavement that just never\nlifts and they're just you know they\ncan't get their life back together and\nyou know they're\nyou'd want to give that pill to that\nperson but the question is how soon\nwould you want to take that pill and\nwould you want to take that pill\n15 minutes after your closest Connection\nin this life died you know it's like\nthat's the body is still warm and it\nwould you be popping this pill I don't\nthink so I think I mean there's\nsomething like how Carefree\ndo you want to feel\nin the in the immediate aftermath of a\nperson you love dying you know you want\nit you want the gravity of that to land\nyou know you want to feel you want to\nfeel that loss because that's in some\nsense the only\nappropriate\nregister of\nwhat they meant to you you know and just\nhow and the life you live together right\nyou know you like so if you if you pop\nthe grief Bill and then you're saying\nokay what's on Netflix right that would\nbe a kind of a desecration of all that\nyou had shared with this person so I\ndon't know it's very interesting\nquestion where you would because I think\nultimately you would want\nto be able to give that pill to someone\nwhose life had become completely\nderailed by grief but just where it just\nwears the line I mean that's that's an\ninteresting question yeah that's a great\nanswer no but yeah um all right so we we\nend every episode with a final five okay\nuh which have to be answered in one\nsentence maximum each each one it's a\nchallenge for me so this is a challenge\nfor you for sure I'm excited to hear\nsome of your answers the fifth question\nwhich we've asked to every guest on the\nshow is perfectly designed for you after\ntoday's conversation so uh and I and I\njust want to say on camera uh we just\ncut because the cameras were getting\nreset because we've been taping for so\nlong but I was just saying that the\nconversation I've had with Sam today has\nbeen so different from the one I thought\nI'd have with him after reading his book\nand that to me is a sign of a good\nconversation because it was true\ncuriosity mystery and and uh Creation in\nthe moment and and presence in the\nmoment from both of us yeah nice I I\nlove that question number one what is\nthe best meditation advice you've ever\nheard received or given you are not this\nnext thought\nuh second question is what is the worst\nmeditation advice you've ever heard\nreceived or given\nwell I practiced for a long time in a\nvery goal-oriented tradition where it\nwas just you know I spent months and\nmonths on Retreats with with the\nuh Burmese meditation Masters who who um\nhad a very dualistic goal-oriented\nseeking kind of model it's not it's not\nto say you couldn't benefit from that\nbut I will get to a sentence this out of\nthis but the set up to the sentence the\nthe primary analogy being used was\num you're kind of rubbing two sticks to\nget fire and the moment you stop they\ncool off right so it's just so whatever\nthe sentence is it's just like\nmeditation is like rubbing two sticks\ntogether to get fired you have to\ncontinuously do it and the moment you\nbreak you're back to zero right you've\nmade nope yeah yeah wow that's yeah\nthat's a painful one that's that's\nreally painful advice yeah okay question\nnumber three uh what's the biggest\nlesson you learned in the last 12 months\nhonestly it's humbling to\nto admit it but it really was getting\noff Twitter just we're just the\nrecognition\nthat the the whole superset of\npreoccupation here\nwas not worth it and not healthy uh even\nthe good stuff I mean just every side of\nthis\ndiabolical Jewel was sort of ugly when I\nreally looked at it and yeah so that was\nthat was it great uh question number\nfour what's something you think people\nvalue highly but you don't value anymore\nidentity in what sense I mean it really\nin every sense let me just just uh\ntribal identity you know your you know\nreligious identity your ethnic identity\nyour I don't even think you need to\nidentify with the face you see in the\nmirror each day right so I said how much\nless should you have to identify with\npeople who just superficially resemble\nyou and in any way so but even just the\nidentity of feeling like\nlike in my career or in any mode in\nwhich I'm showing up in the world it's\nless and like\nwho I feel I am while doing that is less\nand less substantial it's like I don't I\ndon't really it's not really graspable\nyou know and so I don't\nlike you know I spend a lot of time\nteaching meditation in\non waking up\nbut because it's because of the\ntechnology because it's an app\nI don't actually feel like a meditation\nteacher yeah you know I'm not showing up\nin the world as a meditation teacher I\ndon't have there's no place you can go\nsit with me in a in a hall you know so I\ndon't have students in the ordinary\nmeditation teacher way but the reality\nis that through waking up you know it\nseems strange to say it but I could be\nteaching\nnon-dual mindfulness to more people than\nanyone on Earth at this moment I mean\nit's just it's really quite crazy how it\nhas scaled but yet I don't I never think\nof myself in that role so like the the\nrole-based identity you know I'm a\nwriter I've got a bunch of books but you\nknow I'm not I don't really think of\nmyself as a writer as much as I used to\nI mean there's just no I I just don't\nfeel like uh there's no anything that I\nwould anyway in which I would label what\nI'm doing the label really does feel\nlike it's it it's barely adhesive to the\nto the project you know it's just it's\nit's there just for the for the um\nthe utility of just summarizing you know\njust like what do you put on this form\nyou know what's what's your what's your\noccupation right but it's like it just\ndoesn't get at what I'm actually doing\nand it it doesn't get it how I see\nmyself so the identity is something that\nI mean people think about yes I'm sure\nthere's some stage in life where you\nwant a healthy identity like I've got\ntwo daughters I want them to have\nhealthy identities I want them to have\nhealthy egos\nBut ultimately\nuh it's not about being someone in any\nkind of sense that feels it's like\nidentity feels like a fist you know and\nI really want an open hand in life and\nthat's and so it's not that it's not\nthat I never make a fist but it's like\nyou want to you want to relax that as as\nsoon as you notice it it's it's really\ninteresting from a personal practice\npoint of view and from a\nhuman scale practice point of view\nbecause what you just said is\nthe the Perfection of the idea almost\nthe way I see it is like with your\ndaughters I don't know how old they are\nbut you know I'm guessing they're not\nnine and fourteen yeah right and so it's\nlike you want them to have a healthy\nsense of identity because at that stage\nof life that's such an important thing\nyeah and it's almost like the evolution\nof the idea is like well there's a stage\nof life where that isn't yeah you know\nthat the directive thing and I think\nthat's what's so hard because you find\neveryone who's listening watching\nexperiencing life it's such different\nyeah levels and it's almost like someone\nbeing able it's the same as what I was\nsaying earlier with the identity from a\nsystematic point of view it's like some\npeople that's where they are that that's\njust where they are where their identity\nis what gives their life meaning yeah\nand then you see as someone's so yeah\nit's just it's fascinating to me how a\ndifferent stages of Life identity can\nmean different things and yeah it's\nreally the emotion of Pride really\ncrystallizes it for me it's like yeah\nfor my daughter is\nit's it's totally appropriate for them\nto feel PRI I want them to feel pride in\nthe right moments and I feel proud it's\nsome it's not quite the right framing\nbut something like Pride for them it's\nlike I want to play that that healthy\nPride game with them\nbut I don't feel pride in my life at all\nlike my project just Pride just does not\nmap I just have the right shape to map\non yeah to my sense of what it is to be\na person really you know it's like I'm\nnot responsible for any of my gifts such\nas they are it's like I just I I'm here\nagain it comes back to luck in so many\nways and what you do with that luck but\nagain even the doing with the luck is\nmore more good luck you know so\num I just feel immensely grateful for\neverything that has gone well in my life\nand I just I mean it's just my gratitude\nis is overwhelmingly\nand my primary positive emotion now it's\njust that so much to be grateful for\nand pride just like Pride just does not\nfit it's a puzzle piece that you maybe\nonce fit and maybe and you know\ngranted if you're if you're a kid yes\nyeah it's it's it's it's it's a game\nit's a it's a totally appropriate game\nat a certain stage of life but later on\nit's a game that you just really you\nhave to outgrow yeah I get I can relate\nto that completely in a fully fully love\nthat I loved hearing that uh Fifth and\nfinal question if you could create one\nlaw this is the one that I said we've\nasked to every guest but I feel like\nit's perfectly designed for you if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\nthe price we pay for for dishonesty into\nat every level of society is so enormous\nand there's so little price paid for a\nlion I mean they're like when a when a\npolitician is found to be lying right or\nthe person who has immense\nresponsibility is found to be lying\nyou know but for like specific cases of\nfraud that are actionable like like Lion\nis just under the purview of free speech\nreally it's like it's not illegal to lie\nright\nI I think um I mean it's not so much a\nlot I think if we had lie detection\ntechnology that was that we could rely\non which is there\nvarious interesting reasons why we we\ndon't have that and may never have that\nbut if we had that if if a lie detection\ntechnology was like you know DNA\nanalysis in a court of law like you just\nput someone on the witness stand and you\ncould tell whether they were lying right\nI think that would be the overnight that\nwould be the biggest ethical change we\ncould ever imagine in society so I think\nso anything that that\nbrought the appropriate level of a\nprogram to Lion right so especially line\nwhen it matters\num\nthat would be I some version of that law\nthe the you can't lie when it matters\nLoa whatever that is you know so but I\ndo it would be a technological solution\nif we just could more and more if people\nknew that they were in a situation where\nthey actually can't get away with Lion\nright because the the technology is such\nor the information space is such that\nit's but the the the added piece is that\nthe norm the the the norm violation\nneeds to be just more urgent you know\nbecause people most people are walking\naround with a sense oh everybody lies\nall politicians lies there's like this\nnormal lie what do you expect you know\nit's like and so it's not but the just\nthe amount of harm and the amount the\namount of good that would be\naccomplished if you just knew\npeople were being honest and you know\nyou're not going to be unpleasantly\nsurprised by yeah\num so there's a lot of growth cultural\ngrowth in that direction but yeah I I\nSam I hope you uh get involved in\nchanging some systems\nfrom some of the stuff you've said today\nof like it would be great if you were\ninfluencing the influences and well we\ntry with our humble podcasts yeah that's\nwhat we do everyone has been listening\nand watching the podcast is called\nmaking sense the app is called waking up\nuh the book is also called by the same\ntitle uh we'll put the links in the\ncaptions in the notes so that you have\naccess to all of Sam's work uh go make\nsure you grab a copy of the book uh\nmeditate with him on the waking up app\nand of course uh subscribe to the\npodcast making sense Sam I hope this is\nthe first of many conversations we get\nto have yeah really a pleasure yeah it's\nreally really been uh it's it's really\nbeen a phenomenal conversation I hope we\nhave many offline too nice and uh anyone\nwho's been listening and watching make\nsure you grab your favorite segments\npoints insights that really stood out to\nyou share them with a friend start a\nconversation based on it tag me and Sam\nand let me know what really stood out to\nyou what resonated with you maybe some\nthings that are making you question or\nthink differently like I'd love to see\nwhat came out of it for you this has\nbeen a very different type of\nconversation on on purpose and I know\nyou're going to appreciate it but a big\nthank
