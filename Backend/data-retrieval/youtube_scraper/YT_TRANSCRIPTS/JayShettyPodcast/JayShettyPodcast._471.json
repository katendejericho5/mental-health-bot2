    "transcript": "worry belongs to tomorrow regret belongs\nto yesterday happiness is here right now\nI learned during the war how to think I\nlearned to quantify the worst thing and\nquite often the worst thing it's not so\nbad the best-selling author and host the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast\non purpose with Jay Shetty\nBob I want to dive straight in to your\njourney and to really dive into your\nwork that you're doing today and I think\nI was really Blown Away to hear about\nyour time as a marine and and I'd like\nto start there well you know when I\nenlisted in the Marine Corps I did so\nmostly because I had two friends of mine\nasking me to join them they were we were\nin our senior year of high school and\nthey were going to visit with the Marine\nCorps recruiter and ask me if I'd go\nalong with them and I did you know as we\nspent time with the Marine Corps\nrecruiter he eventually had us at a palm\nof his hands I mean this was during the\nthe height of the Vietnam War in 1968. I\nlasted one month\nand walking through a village at night I\nwas on the point team\nand uh the point man he uh stepped over\na tripwire missed it and I hit it and\nthat thing blew and I got shrapnel both\nof my legs and my left elbow and I was\nmedeviked out I left on a stretcher\nso uh you know the the thoughts that\nthat I took back from that is uh I think\nI learned to think one day at a time\nand I looked to quantify the worst thing\nthat could possibly happen that's got me\nthrough a number of businesses I've\nbuilt three businesses now and I'm\nworking on the third all from scratch\nand uh you know when you do a startup a\nstartup you have a lot of good days and\na lot of bad days and uh sometimes you\nknow the good days are euphoric and the\nbad days look like Armageddon uh so you\nknow how you think really matters and I\nlearned during the war how to think I\nlearned to quantify the worst thing and\nquite often the worst thing when you sit\ndown and you quantify it's not so bad\nbut if you you know if you look at the\nworst thing is this big dark room full\nof uh bad things that could happen then\nit looks like far worse than it actually\nis and and then it becomes debilitating\nyeah I mean that's such a\npowerful reflection hearing that from\nyou based on the experiences that you\nwent through often we hear that idea but\nsitting with you here today listening to\nin person I can feel just how real that\nidea is for you\nI love what you said about facing one\nday at a time I think a lot of our\nanxiety a lot of our pain a lot of our\nstress is based on what could happen in\n12 months or exactly yeah or what\nhappened 12 months ago yeah and what\nyou're saying is Well actually when you\ntake one day at a time that feels\nmanageable and solvable even in such\nextreme situations well you know one day\nat a time is something you can do\nsomething about right because it's there\nyou know to be worried about a year from\nnow there's not much you can do until\nit's a year from now and then it becomes\none day at a time yeah I often thought\nthat worry belongs to tomorrow\nregret belongs to yesterday Happiness Is\nHere and Now\nthat's so powerful wow and then when you\ncame back and you come back and you're\nexperiencing depression you're\nexperiencing of course all the stress\nthe trauma that comes from\nliving in that way for a month I mean\nhow did your parents react to that\nbefore we get on to how you reacted to\nit I mean I mean what how did your\nparents feel I grew up in a in a\ndifferent kind of house\num I grew up in a in a blue-collar\nneighborhood in East Baltimore and Mom\nand Dad were both compulsive gamblers\nand they weren't very good at it no I I\nwouldn't trade my mom and dad for any\ntwo on the planet I loved them to Pieces\nbut didn't pay a lot of attention to me\nand I wasn't actually home that much\nthat I never noticed they never noticed\nand a lot of it which a lot of veterans\nI just kept them myself you know my my\nsymptoms were and as I was home they got\nworse and they got worse and they got\nworse and when I say that I mean over 49\nyears this is the symptoms with me was I\ndidn't want to go places I didn't want\nto be with groups you know no matter who\nthe group was I never felt like I\nbelonged because I'd be there and I'd\nhave these just this picture of the\nstuff that we did I mean and it just\nnever leaves you and of course nobody\nelse is dealing with that kind of stuff\nso you definitely are different right so\nso that's the you know one of the things\na quick temper is is another thing\npeople would describe me as being one of\nthe most intense people they've ever met\nnow they're crying when I got into that\nit was always by myself nobody be around\nbut there was good things too\nand the the good things were when I went\nto college\nI when I came back I worked as a laborer\nin a steel mill in Bethlehem Steel and I\ndid that for a year and then the\nUniversity of Baltimore had a special\ndeal for veterans where my high school\ngrades didn't matter thank goodness I\ndidn't have to take the entrance exams\nright and I could go on the GI bill\nwhich I did I went studied accounting\nliterally I mean as fate would have it\nit was the first major in the book\nwhat is this they said you go with math\nI said yeah as good as anything are you\ninterested in business yeah you should\ntry accounting and I did and uh I wound\nup graduating with a Bachelor of Science\nin accountancy magna laude wow\ncongratulations I'd have never done that\nwithout the Marine Corps never ever ever\ntook the CPA exam passed it the first\ntime got a job where I would travel I\nmean my life is Fuller just see\ncoincidences you know where I uh I was\nworking for commercial credit leasing\nCorp and this is back in 1975 they sent\nme to Redwood City to uh schedule the\nassets to this leasing company they want\nto buy I finish I I have 12 hours until\nthe flight I wind up on Stanford campus\nat the bookstore because I always like\nto like to read and so forth and I buy a\nbook on programming in the basic\nlanguage and uh I read enough of that\nduring The Layover and on the flight\nwrote my first programs and then got\ngood at it bought an and the company\nthat I worked for had a dumb terminal\nthat happened to run the basic computer\nlanguage wow and then I I taught myself\nuh Pascal and then C and then C plus\nplus and I started my first business\nwhich was Parsons technology and I wrote\nall the code for that and when I when I\nwas working there I\nI worked uh\n40 hours no 60 hour stats 60 hours at a\ntime I come to work Monday morning\nworked through Tuesday Morning work\nthrough Wednesday morning and then about\neight o'clock at night I'd start to\nhallucinate after about 60 hours I'd\nhear stuff the one there maybe see\nsomething move that I know didn't and\nI'd go back go to sleep come back you\nknow after eight hours in a shower and a\nlittle actually a little workout do it\nagain\nand uh that's how that company got off\nthe ground I put forty thousand dollars\ninto that company and I sold it into it\nfor 64 million that was my first\nbusiness wow yeah you know most people\nlike just reintegrating into society\nlike just kind of surviving seems to be\na natural challenge because of the\nextreme events that people go through\nhow did you navigate that when you were\ntalking about some of the challenges you\nhad when you came back like how did you\neven just start finding your way again\nbecause it can be so disassociating it\ncan be so disconnected well you know\nusing using that term\ndisassociate disassociating there was a\ntime where I'd seen a psychiatrist for a\ngood while and she said told me one of\nthe things that that has helped me get\nthrough to war and also helped me in\nbusiness she says you have a remarkable\nability to to disassociate and where I\ndeveloped that I don't know one of the\nthe blessings that I have is I don't\nworry about anything\nat all I just don't worry\nand that has been one of the things that\nto me is just helped bring out the joy\nof my life you know what Joy there was I\nmean that's beautiful to hear that's\nwhat an Incredible Gift to have to not\nworry that's very special uh when you\nstarted learning and teaching yourself\nthese coding languages and you started\nbuilding this company\nwhat was your level of business\nexperience at the time or technology\nexperience at the time and how did you\neven figure out what you wanted to build\nI think there's so many people today I\njust I literally was just at uh the Tech\nUniversity in Monterey Mexico 50 of the\npeople from that University go on to\nbecome entrepreneurs and so it's a\nreally uh phenomenal institution but one\nof the biggest questions I saw that\nyoung people have is Jay how do I know\nif I'm doing the right thing or I don't\nknow what I'm building or what should I\nfocus on I feel like now there's so much\nchoice that people feel Paralyzed by the\namount of options they have I had a\ndegree in accountancy so I understood\nthe record keeping of business right all\nright I started a little business which\nwas a more of a bookkeeping business and\nanything where I'd work with these small\nbusinesses some some were taverns one\nwas a flower shop uh one of my favorites\nwas a pest control film Pest Control the\nguy's name was fat Willy I learned a lot\nfrom him uh he keep track of the way he\nwould keep track of things and and and I\nyou know and it got to the point where\nover you know over you know a few years\nI could you know start doing the records\nof a business and I could tell you if\nthey'd succeed or not and anyhow using\nthose little things that I learned there\nyou know that's what I did when I\nlaunched my business and then plus I\nlearned you know I learned like for\nexample I read during the Civil War\nright during the Civil War in the union\nthere was uh General McClellan who\nreally trained and organized the uh\nUnion Army but he could not move them\ninto battle just couldn't do it right\nand then uh so so Lincoln fired him and\nput grant there and Grant didn't care\nhow they were organized the enemies over\nthere go there right that's that's\nthat's what he did and actually the the\nright way is a mixture of the two right\nso I learned that from them I learned\nfrom John D Rockefeller that the guy who\nknows the most about his business he\nkept exceptional records they were all\nmanual but he knew everything about his\nbusiness at a time when very few people\ndid the guy who knows the most about his\nbusiness quite often is the guy that\nthat wins because as you know now it's\ntruly is power and especially specific\nand pertinent knowledge so I mean I I\nlearned from from people in history\nright and um and then beyond that I just\npowered through yeah I love those\nexamples I think\nwhat I love about them is I often say to\npeople that you can be mentored by\npeople you've never met when we study\nhistory when we look at patterns when we\nlook at connections and start connecting\nthe dots between events that have\nhappened before us\nyou can actually Garner so much wisdom\nand so much Insight even if you never\nasked Rockefeller the question yourself\nexactly I mean you know and somebody get\na Julius Caesar's another one yeah you\nknow what he was able to do and go and\nhow he was able to uh uh you know lead\nhis armies and and one time he was\nattacked by a vastly larger force and\nthe battlements that he built was just\nbrilliant right nobody showed him how to\ndo that he figured it out so I mean we\nhave that ability as long as you believe\nin yourself\nand you give yourself a chance if\nthere's someone right now who's\nlistening who's thinking about starting\na business what would be the top three\nthings you think they should think about\nif they're starting if they're thinking\nabout starting something well the first\nthing is they should do something\nthat they love\nthat is fun\nthat is something that they're really\ninterested in and and the reason for\nthat my father used to tell me he used\nto say Robert when you love something it\ntells you all with secrets and\num that's beautiful and basically if you\nknow if you love what you're doing it's\ngoing to um well you're going to work\nharder and that that all translates to\nsuccess\num and then let's see here what would be\nthe\nthe second you you have to not be doing\nit for the money\nif if you start a business and you're\ndoing it just to turn a buck I don't\nthink you'll be successful you got to\nstart it to be special and the\nbusinesses that I started and none of\nthem even go daddy that I do it to to\nmake money I did it to make a difference\nyou know when you you work to make a\ndifference you know you do things that\non the surface from a business uh\nstandpoint it doesn't make sense\nbut when it comes to really doing\nsomething special and getting your idea\nacross and taking care of your customers\nand so forth that's that's what you need\nto do and you will never do that if\nyou're just doing it for a dollar\nthe third thing is there's uh there's\ntwo groups of people that you have to\nyou you have to energize the first group\nis your employees\nand uh your employees you know they need\nto believe in what you're doing and uh\nyou need to structure it so they can\nbelieve in what you're doing that that\nit's special and again if you're doing\nit for money it's they're going to have\ndifficult time doing that but if you you\nknow if you have a higher purpose right\npeople always do want to Aspire to a\nhigher purpose I believe so what happens\nis when you do that with them it creates\nenthusiasm and what do we know about\nenthusiasm it's contagious yeah and\nthose the employees then fire up the\ncustomers and then the customers fire up\neach other so it'll be those three\nthings yeah those are great answers I\nlove those three things there's such\ngreat points what was something that you\nwere passionate about with GoDaddy like\nwhen you said that I fully agree with\nyou that we should never stop business\nto make money there has to be a greater\ngoal with that what was that goal with\nGoDaddy when it started out like the\npart we don't see well when I started\nGoDaddy I had it had been after I sold\nparts of technology which was the name\nof my first business and I signed a\nnon-compete with uh into it not that I\ncouldn't compete with them I couldn't\nwork for money yeah right for a few\nyears and and uh they they held back a\nfew few million dollars and when it was\nup I just wanted to be back in Action\nagain but I didn't know what I wanted to\ndo this was back when the internet was\njust getting going like 97. so I named\nthis Business jomax Technologies I had\nlike 36 million dollars I had gotten\ndivorced I mean I don't blame her for\nthe PTSD I'm lucky she kept me around\nthat long so I wanted to do something\nin the internet so what I did was I\nthought I would hire some pretty short\npeople and we would start trying things\non the internet and when we and when we\ndid you know if it worked we would\ncontinue and if it didn't we'd move on\nand uh so my name to jomax Technologies\nafter a dirt road that I drove by on the\nway to work I mean it didn't matter I\nmean we didn't do anything so our\nemployees would go to Chamber of\nCommerce meetings and people would ask\nthem what are you doing they go well we\ndon't know you know he says I've never\nhad a business tell me that\nand then eventually as time went on we\ndecided to to start uh doing websites\nfor people and these are way early\nreally fundamental websites and we\nnoticed that the website's business\nwould would generate cash but it\ncouldn't scale because you know it was\njust your efforts there that you were\nyou were tied to I have a rule that if\nyou got the right business you can make\nmoney while you're sleeping your\nbusiness can be successful while you're\nsleeping so we then wrote software that\nwould build a website for people they\ncould do it theirself we had so many\nrequirements and then eventually in uh\nin 99\nuh or 99 and 2000 we became a domain\nname registrar renamed the company\nGoDaddy uh just as and and uh I I did\nthat at first as a joke but it stuck and\num and never did we dream that we'd make\nour our Bread on domain names yeah and\nthen there's there's a further story\ngoing back okay I would keep track of\nhow much money I had and and and then as\nand tie that to how successful the\nbusiness is doing now that you remember\nthat were the days of cash burn\nright and so I would start it and when I\nfirst started I said I'm not going to\nworry about this business until I get\ndown to 30 million and then 25 and then\n2020 and then 18 14 12 10. 8 6. you know\nwe get down to six million dollars and\nthis is about so you never raised it was\nall your own money you put into it yeah\nexactly exactly it was always only my\nown money I've never really borrowed\nmuch and from the first business none\nwow and GoDaddy none and no Partners oh\nincredible yeah so I get the other six\nmillion and uh one of the things I\nlearned from reading about General Grant\nhe kept his own Council I cut my own\ncounsel so I decided to shut GoDaddy\ndown while I still had some uh some\nmoney and the reason I had to is\nthat.com Boom was so loud that you\ncouldn't buy advertising I mean people\nwere paying a hundred dollars for a you\nknow a customer and the customer might\ngenerate two bucks well you can burn up\na lot of cash yeah absolutely and I\ndon't care how big your truck is you're\nnot gonna you know you're not gonna be\nable to make wages yeah that's what I\ndid so I go to Hawaii\nand I went there to First pay my bills\npay my employees and sell the assets\nfigured out how I'm going to do that and\nthen so I'm there by myself for a week\nand I as I started thinking about I\ndon't want to shut it down I just had\nthis feeling I just didn't want to shut\nit down the Epiphany for me happened\nwith this guy is parking cars and he\ncomes up to me and he goes hey don't Mr\nParsons this guy's a little older than\nme throwing his keys up in the air happy\nis a lark right I'm thinking what's\nwrong with this picture this guy has\nprobably got nothing he's parking cars\nfor a living look how happy and free he\nis I got six million dollars and I'm\nmiserable right and so I decided then\nthat I would go back and not shut the\ncompany down\nand uh I just would ride it out and if\nthe company sunk I'd go down with the\nship so that was probably in February\nMarch\nand later that later then the.com crash\nhappened and the.com crash GoDaddy was\nborn out of that because I was one of\nthe few guys that was paying my bills\nand all these companies just went away I\nmean I would we would have checks\nreturned every week from different\ncompanies that just weren't there\nanymore right and so so we would take\nand uh uh you know we'd go ahead and I\nwent from not being able to buy\nadvertising at any price to having\npeople standing in line to give it to me\nI had more friends than I thought I had\nand then all of a sudden things turned\naround for us and that October we became\nprofitable for the very first time and\nnever missed a month since wow that's\nunbelievable I mean it sounds like\nyou've been guided so much by your\nintuition as well as data you talked\nabout the numbers you talked about\nknowing your business you talked about\nknowing your numbers but it sounds like\nlike you're also guided intuitively\nwould you agree with that was that is\nthat true is that fair or not really you\nknow you sometimes you hear this saying\nbetter lucky than good and things just\njust happen and you know you'd like to\nbelieve they happen for a reason I\nbelieve the universe just guiding you\num and I believe there's there's an\nintelligence to it you know however you\ndefine that intelligence uh whether it's\nyou know a particular form of God or or\njust just the the the way of the\nuniverse\nbut I believe it sir yeah that's\nincredible what what an unbelievable\nStory I mean as I'm listening to you I'm\nthinking you know you have this really\npositive mindset you have this really\nincredible ability to find the good even\nin challenging times what's been one of\nthe biggest failures in your life for\nyou know something that's gone wrong\nthat maybe in business or on another\nfield that you learned a lot from or you\ntook a lot of Insight from I would say\none of the the regrets I have is you\nknow when I came back and I got married\nand I had kids is I miss their childhood\nbecause I was working working so hard\nyou know back then I had PTSD so bad I\nhad a flash temper so it was probably\nsome ways you know the hard thing is\nit's a good thing that uh I wasn't\naround\nbut I I have a great relationship with\nall three of them now I love them dearly\nand I look forward to treasure our time\ntogether that's incredible yeah thank\nyou for sharing that I can it's\ninteresting to hear about your\nexperience that you weren't there but\nyou're saying it was actually good I\nwasn't there because I had PTSD and I\nwas dealing with that and I've I've\nheard in your journey you talk about how\npsychedelics were like a huge part of\nyour coming home a 100 yeah could you\ncould you walk us through how you got\nintroduced to that and how you were open\nto that in 2018 I read Michael powin's\nbook how to change your mind I I went\nthrough it like a bag of peanuts and I\nand and I just told my wife uh Renee who\nis the love of my life I never did\npsychedelics before in my life never did\nthem anything like that but I said to\nher if this can do it for me\nI\nI mean I I want to try them and I mean I\nI got to the point Jay where somebody\ncould come up to me and say like I'm at\nthe golf course and say you're in\nVietnam weren't you I start crying\nyeah I mean it just it just it gets\nworse you know so she had me hooked up\nin two weeks with uh two individuals\nthat again would uh see me in Hawaii and\nuh on the first day I did Ayahuasca and\nit's it's guided you know you mean a lot\nof talk and the therapy that does the\nhealing psychedelics make it possible\nbecause they make you receptive and to\nmake you willing to change so on the\nfirst day it was Ayahuasca on the second\nday it was um uh magic mushrooms uh\npsilocybin and and you know a little\ninteresting aside when uh the guide made\nthe he made a teapot and he said and he\nsays I made this teapot holds\nthree cups and I made them strong so\nyou'll only need one I drank all three\ncups and I ate the tea bags\noh man I was sailing and then uh you\nknow then a lot and then on the on the\nthird day I took a break and on the\nfourth day it was LSD and uh afterwards\nI was a different guy I was totally a\ndifferent guy I um uh the people that\nworked with me were like what happened\nto him he's so nice he doesn't have a\ntemper he's not that intense\nscary dude anymore you know he uh uh my\nson said uh told his wife he said man\nI'm worried my dad's going to die soon\nand she goes why and he goes well I\nthink he found that he's going to die\nsoon because he keeps calling and he's\nso nice and so forth but I mean and it\nwas that type of thing and of course\nRenee my wife noticed it instantly and\nthe best way I can describe it is after\nbeing treated with psychedelics it had\nbeen 49 years since the War I finally\ncame home\nthat's unbelievable\ndo you feel do you feel that you went\nback to being who you were before the\nwar exactly you know and Rich by\neverything I learned since and\num you know I I still had the memories\nof the war there's times when you know\nwhen I when I talk about it I choke up\nand so forth but I'm not debilitated by\nit anymore\nbut it's still very much there of course\nof course yeah it sounds like it sounds\nlike that you've kept the the pots that\nhave made you who you are and left the\nparts that defined who it forced you to\nbe if that feels right yeah for sure to\nbe honest just sitting with you today\nlike you have such a joyful Spirit you\nyou have such a like positive outlook on\nlife you're fun to be around like that's\nall I'm experiencing that's how I\nexperienced you at pxg when I was there\na couple of years ago and\nfor me to know it feels like this is who\nyou are this is who you always were but\nnaturally the challenge is just clouded\nover and the experience is clouded over\nthat yeah yeah one of the windows have\nbeen opened yeah it's it's unbelievable\nand is that a practice that you have to\nkeep up do you go back uh to Hawaii or\nto the centers to continue that practice\nor no it was once you know I've went\nthrough the process twice right I've\nwent through the process once myself and\nthen once with two other guys that\nserved with and um\nthey both came home well they both came\nhome that's something that must be\nbeautiful for you to see that for other\npeople there oh 100 now one of the\nthings that I spend time and and money\nand help out as best I can is\num to get psychedelics uh made legal for\ntherapeutic use uh we're very close with\nMDMA thank God\nto uh Rick doblin and maps and you know\nthe rest I I think it's not too far\nbehind I tell you when we do it's going\nto be a renaissance\nand we deserve that as a people and our\nveterans deserve it every veteran should\nbe treated with it when they come back\nbecause the Veterans Administration says\n30 percent of the combat veterans have\nPTSD\nI'd be willing to say 100 do but 30\npercent are really good at\npushing it down\nthat's what I think yeah yeah no I mean\nand it's it's not surprising I mean like\nyou said like no one else can relate to\nwhat that experience is like no one else\ncan understand it and I mean that's\nthat's a lot to carry for the human mind\noh the human brain absolutely for sure\nuh when uh those those two were treated\nand somebody should have seen the tears\nI mean the tears I mean and it's like oh\nthey were carrying some they were you\nknow they they were there much longer\nthan I was but uh\nyou know to carry a lot of crosses yeah\nwhat what are some of the uh\nyou know from all your experiences in\nlife you've lived so many different\nlives it seems as well what are some of\nthe mindsets or approaches you think\nlessons that you think\npeople should carry with them what what\nare some of the mistakes people make or\nwhat are some of the shifts in our\nmindset we could make to live happier\nand healthier lives you need to believe\nin yourself\ndefinitely you need to believe in\nyourself because uh you know while\nthere's many books there's no manual you\nknow what we talked about looking too\nfar into the future day at a time and uh\nand also when you're doing stuff the\nbest you can have fun have fun you know\nwe're more productive when we have fun\nyeah yeah yeah a lot of people today\nhave a lot of self-doubt when you said\nbelieve in yourself\nwhen I'm traveling and speaking and\ncoaching people and meeting people I\nnotice self-doubt to be just such a big\nchallenge when you say believe in\nyourself and I think so many people\neven if they act confident and they act\nsecure inside there's such a\nlow self-esteem situation that we have\nin the country right now and in the\nworld right now like if someone has\nself-doubt or their\ntheir feeling like they don't have\npotential or they don't believe in\nthemselves what would you say to them I\nwould say there's a couple things they\nneed to do that uh usually they have\nsoft out for a reason usually they were\nnot encouraged they were discouraged\nonce they were raised I would think and\nthat that being the case I would I would\nsay this uh this uh therapy with\npsychedelics when it's available would\nbe perfect because it would free them\nfrom a lot of those shackles\num and and there's there's something\nthat works just as good and it is legal\nit's got an sgb block uh do you know\nabout it no I don't please okay what an\nsgb block is it's uh as S and G is\nstands for stellia ganglion and then b\nstands for block and and what it is is\nPTSD and all that stuff is cause from\nthe uh the amygdala in the front of the\nmine okay and the amygdala managers uh\nfight or flight and emotions well what\nhappens is as we go through all these\nunpleasant events and so forth it gets\nout of tilt and and the individual stays\nin a close to a fight or flight type\nsituation which is what PTSD is and and\nit's debilitating but the problem is\nwith the human mind the Mind hides its\nflaws from the person in which it\nresides they don't know it they feel\nlike they're just perfect except they\nhave self-doubt or or they have anxiety\nor they're on edge or that sort of thing\nit's the amygdala all right and but so\nthe amygdala communicates with the rest\nof the body through the Stella ganglion\nnerves in the neck and when there's a\nfight or flight\nuh response necessary or be it a real or\nemotional it releases adrenaline and\nepinephrine it speeds the heart up it\ndilates the lungs it tightens the\narteries and extremities to move blood\nto the core all those things to get us\nto survive that have been developed over\nMillennia right it does it does all that\nwell what what is happening is the\npeople that are suffering from this\nthey're in that state very close and any\ntrigger just pushes them right into it\nand they have no control over it they\nhave no physical control over it even\nthough they say you hear people say I\ndon't know what's wrong with me
