many first week\nsales it does and YouTube numbers all of\nthat is not happiness it is completely\nthe best-selling author and host the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast\non purpose with Jay Shetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thank you so much for coming back\nevery week to become happier healthier\nand more healed something that I'm\nalways working on for myself and one of\nthe things I love about this community\nthat we've built here is I love talking\nto people who are using their platforms\nfor a greater purpose who Find autistic\nand creative ways to talk about the\nthings we care about here whether that's\nmental health personal growth addiction\npersonal challenges that we go through\ninternally and externally and today's\nguest is someone who has used their\nplatform through and through to talk\nabout really important interesting\nfascinating topics I'm talking about\nmulti-platinum and Grammy award-winning\nartist Macklemore who's made history\nwith a combination of Commercial Success\ncritical Acclaim and international\nappeal with a total of 12.8 billion\ncombined streams today and Macklemore is\none of the most successful Independent\nArtists of the 21st century and he's\nconsistently used his art and platform\nto raise awareness around issues of\naddiction and recovery and now the two\nnew singles are out chant and Maniac\nmake sure you go and stream and listen\nuh Macklemore Ben you could tell me how\nhow you want me to go\nBen thank you so much uh for making the\ntrip to be here thank you so much for\nthis opportunity for having me man yeah\nfantastic amazing let's get an intro one\ntake oh yeah well we have to cut it down\nI mean there was so many achievements I\nwas like I need to get back you know\neveryone knows you are right I grew up\nlistening to music when I was back in\nLondon and so for me to be sitting with\nyou today is awesome and and you'll see\nthat for a few of the questions I'll ask\nbut I wanted to pick out I love this\nlyric here that I wanted to share with\nyou it's obviously one of yours uh and I\nwanted to start with this your new song\nchant says they told me that I vanished\nthey told me that I had it they told me\nthat I'm gone I told him don't panic\nyeah and when I was listening to that\nthere's a lot of what they're thinking\nabout where you are right and my\nquestion was where do you feel you are\ntoday oh\nlet's just get into it okay you said you\nlike to get in yeah absolutely\nyou know I think there is a constant\nnarrative when you're in the public eye\nthere's a constant narrative about who\nyou are and that ranges between people\nthat love you people that hate you\npeople that you know have maybe heard a\nsong or two\nand what I like to get back to is\ncutting out the noise\nof any sort of outside influence in\nterms of who I am as a person that when\nyou put yourself out there when you put\nout art in any capacity can I do it in a\nway where regardless of its success or\nlack thereof or critical Acclaim or\nNothing at All\nI know who I am and I think that that is\nthe most important part about being an\nartist because it's very easy to start\nlooking and I was actually I was I was\nlistening to something that you said\nand you can correct me because I will be\nwrong but about seeing yourself through\nhow you think other people see you and\nhow how false that is and we get this\nvery precious light this finite amount\nof time on this Earth and we waste it\nwondering what other people think of us\nand also inheriting how we how we\nbelieve that they might be seeing and\nit's a waste of time and I got to a\npoint years ago and granted this is a\ndaily process to like completely shed\nthis so I I have by no means arrived but\nI stopped reading what people were\nwriting I stopped reading reviews and I\nmake art because I love it and when you\ndo that and you come from a pure genuine\nplace that is where happiness lies and\nfulfillment lies in the creative process\nso that's what I'm getting to with those\nlyrics the chant is just getting back to\nthe core of who I am as a person as a\nand as an artist regardless of the\noutside yeah I love that and I love what\nyou're saying about how it's a daily\npractice it's something we have to\nrecommit to that ritual of getting back\nthere and blocking out the noise I\nwonder when was the first time you felt\nyou lost that did you feel you had that\nand then you started to lose that as\ncertain point or was it something that\nyou've always been able to like grasp on\nto even when it's been tough I think\nthat at the height of our success\nand I look back to coming off of\num you know number one Thrift Shop was\nnumber one Can't Hold This was number\none\nall of a sudden this music that you feel\nlike is yours becomes the world and it\nbecomes open you know to public\ninterpretation I think I lost it then I\nthink that\num there was a point where it wasn't\njust a relapse anymore I went back into\nactive addiction around that time period\nI didn't know how to maneuver the\nsuccess I had been an underground rapper\nforever\nand as long as like that like you know\nmy entire career was just like this and\nthen all of a sudden there was this\nSkyrocket moment and when that Skyrocket\nmoment happened\nand you're at the mercy of the critics\nand the think pieces and like the people\nthat are out there just to write\nscathing reviews or whatever I lost it\nand when and I compounded that by then\nturning to to drugs to escape it right\nlike there's no escaping that there's\nfiguring out healthy ways to to cope or\neven better to heal or to just you know\ntune it out but I tried to put drugs on\ntop of that to escape which made it that\nmuch worse and for me\num you know with my history of addiction\nit is a progressive disease so I'm I'm\nputting drugs on top of it and I turn to\na place of fear and I think that that\nfear really\nwas a paralyzing force in that time\nperiod where I was scared\nI didn't know how to deal with the\noutside world yeah so around that time\nkind of and it's crazy because it\nhappened at the height of the success\nright so I had on one side all these you\nknow Awards and acclaim and millions of\npeople and millions of dollars and all\nthis money and and all these things that\nin is society's eyes that's what you're\nworking towards and on the other side I\nhad completely lost track of who I was\nand the things that actually really\nmattered and when when did drugs first\ncome into your life like when was your\nfirst connection with that because you\ntalk about your history of addiction\nright but I'm intrigued by that I I feel\nlike we always talk and I do want to\ntalk about recovery but I feel like it's\nreally interesting watching like when we\nas young people or as adults get\ninvolved with anything of this sort to\nthen go back the other way so when was\nyour first kind of foray into that space\nthe first time that I ever drank alcohol\nand I consider alcohol a drug I was 14\nyears old and my parents drank and I had\na liquor cabinet in my house above the\nfridge and I went into that liquor\ncabinet and I took one shot of vodka I\nwas 14 years old\nand I had on my undershirt I had Tupac\nin the background I poured one shot I\ntook the shot and uh and I was like oh\nmy God I love the way that I feel right\nnow like I finally am turning this off\nI took two more I wonder what three\nfeels like another one wonder what four\nI ended up I probably weighed 130 pounds\nand I took 12 shots of vodka in maybe a\n30 minute time period and um you know\nended up stumbling I got on the bus to\ngo downtown Seattle I ended up throwing\nup all over myself in a McDonald's the\ncops came I had to run from the cops\nthat was the beginning of my drinking\ncareer which turned out to be a very\npainful one\num in the moment and in hindsight and\nyeah you know drugs came along with that\nmarijuana and you know\nsome pills and a bunch of other things\nbut you know that was the beginning of\num a very unhealthy relationship from\nthe very jump and for different people\nit's different things like for some\npeople it's confidence for some people\nit's\nsounds like numbing the noise like\nswitching this off you said was was that\nthe goal was that the intention like\nwhere where was that coming from and\nwhere did it escalate to like what was\nthe the reasoning behind it for you the\neasiest way for me to describe it is\nthat it was like an allergy\nit was\nonce I had\na sip or a hit or a sniff or whatever it\nwas I wanted more and I couldn't turn\nthat off and I never could it was like\nfrom the very first time I didn't take\ntwo shots and say you know what I don't\nwant to get busted by my parents like\nI'm done this was like I took one and\nand went to 12 in a really short period\nof time and the longer that I've been in\nrecovery and examining my own life and\nmaybe what led me to that point because\nI mean maybe you know it I don't know\nwhat the science is in terms of genetics\nor being predisposed I had some things\nthat um happened at an early age that I\nthink I wanted to turn off and it wasn't\nuntil\nrelatively recently\nthat I've kind of examined those and\nseen other men in the recovery Community\nopen up about sexual Trauma from an\nearly age and be open and willing to\ntalk about things that happen to them\nthings that like definitely growing up I\nnever heard about and up until\nrelatively recently finding a community\nof men in recovery I never heard people\ntalk about openly in meetings so I'm\nlike maybe that was the reason why I\ndon't know exactly yeah yeah no that's\nthat's fair I mean I think it's always a\ncollection of things rather than it\nbeing one thing but when you're talking\nabout recovery now and you know\ncongratulations on just you know an\nincredible journey to recovery when it\nwas at its lowest plane which sounds\nlike it was when you were at your\nhighest point externally you're at your\nlowest point internally and it's it's\nactually not as surprising like that\nhappens so often right like you hear\nthat so often that people had their best\nmoments accidentally in their way\nmoments internally what was it that did\ngive you reassurance or redirection to\nsay I want to find a way out because I\ncan imagine that's so dark and anyone\nwho's listening and watching maybe they\nhave a family member who's in that\nposition or maybe they have a loved one\nor maybe they're in that position\nthemselves and they're listening to us\nright now and they're like but it is so\ndark it is so hard it is such a strong\naddiction that it always looks easy on\nthe other side from the outside but the\nperson who's been through it knows what\nit's taken right what was it at that low\npoint that dark point that you said no I\nI see another side to this\nlife and death\nwhat do I choose\nit came down to that and I knew the\ntruth I had been lucky enough that I had\nalready been to rehab\nI had already understood that this is\nthe disease of addiction this is an\nuncurable disease this is something that\nI don't graduate from this is something\nthat I don't go into remission like this\nwill be with me forever and as a daily\nuh reprieve and a daily practice what am\nI doing for my recovery I went back to\nthe origin the roots of what wrote the\nmusic that ended up being the heist that\nended up getting all the awards and all\nthe love and all of that I went back to\nthat place of okay where were you when\nyou felt fulfilled and what did you have\nand I had a home group where I where I\nwent and I had a service position and I\nmade coffee for a bunch of other\nalcoholics and addicts and on Tuesdays\nin order for the meeting to happen I\nneeded to show up an hour early and put\nout the chairs in the meeting and I\nneeded to make the coffee and the coffee\nwas trash it was horrible but I needed\nto do it and I had that accountability I\nhad that sense of community I didn't\nfeel alone I felt something that I think\nall human beings want which is to feel a\npart of\nand the disease of addiction leads you\nto isolation at least for for a lot of\nus\num you know right before I went to\ntreatment I would you know the only\nperson I would pick up the phone for a\ncall was the drug dealer the the blinds\nwere drawn I was in a super dark place\nnow granted after the height of of\neverything I couldn't hide I couldn't\nhide from the world I had a full\ncalendar I just wore sunglasses inside\nand kept going\num but I remember my wife and I and it\nwas after the Grammys and my wife and I\nwe went to India and\num you know I was actually detoxing from\nfrom drugs during the Grammys like I was\nlike you know maybe three or four days\noff of opiates and definitely was not\nout of my system whatsoever so that\nplace of fear was very still there I\nnever talked about this before and I\nremember winning the four Grammys\nand at the after party\ngot a pill from somebody again at the\nafter party and that was the beginning\nof another attempt to escape everything\nthat was happening my wife and I went to\nIndia and I and I really detoxed and\nrealized that I needed to find my\ncommunity again\nthat all of this other\nexternal\npats on the back all these strangers all\nthese people that are are with you for\nthe for the moment but they don't really\nknow me I need to find the people that\nreally know me that really love me and\nthe people that share this commonality\nof the disease of addiction because\nthose are the people that speak my same\nlanguage That Make Me Feel Again a part\nof and not distant and disconnected and\nwhy India What specifically about India\nI'm fascinated it's my favorite place on\nEarth there's something about this\nspiritual undertone it's not even really\nundertone you can just feel it\nenergetically moving throughout India\num you know we were we were traveling\naround from from Varanasi to dharmasala\nto you know Delhi to all over wow and um\nno one knew who I was no one cared\nI was back to just being Ben and there\nwas something so simple about that in\nthat moment and I think that you you\ntravel throughout India and you see\nextreme extreme poverty and people that\nare\num still\nhappy and fulfilled in that and you\nrealize that to actually be fulfilled\nand happy in this world all what we have\nbeen taught in the western world that we\nneed these benchmarks in terms of\nsuccess and square footage of a house\nand what type of car all of these things\ndo not lead to happiness and I was\nreminded of all of that and I just I\njust love this I just love India that's\namazing was that your first time there\nor you no I've been there before yeah oh\nwow that's incredible yeah obviously I\nI've spent so much time in India and\nthat's been such a I feel the same way\nas you do about it in the sense of it's\nIt's spiritual energy that's just\nemanating right constantly yes and I I\nfind it's even easier to develop\nspiritual practices there and habits\nthere and and things like that what have\nbecome some of the\nhabits or practices or rituals that you\nfeel you've formed that have aided this\nprocess of recovery Community seems to\nbe a big one of them you keep referring\nto being around those people\nreconnecting with who you were before\nwhat what are some other things that\nyou've really worked on that you think\nof being pillars of supporting you at\nthis time I think service is a massive\npillar in terms of getting outside of\nself you know it talks about in in some\nof the literature that I that I work\nfrom the disease of addiction is rooted\nin in self-centeredness and in order to\nget outside of self the quickest way to\ndo that is to think about other people\nit's like the the thing that's under all\nof our noses it's right there in plain\nsight and yet we keep going on our this\njourney of like what do I want right now\nhow can I serve myself what are my needs\nwhat are my immediate family's needs but\nto really actually you know to find like\nconnection with other people it is to\nserve and that's something in the\nrecovery community that is one of the\nyou know pillars wow that's a massive\npart of it and it's looking inward it's\ndoing the step work it is uh figuring\nout my Character defects really\nstripping down figuring out who I am and\nhow can I improve and there's so much\nwork to be done you know I mean and I'm\nat a very I've been in and out of the\nrooms of recovery for 14 years now\nand I relapsed at the beginning of coven\nso I have a couple years but I still\nfeel like a newcomer I still feel like\nthis is brand new and um I'm just on the\nprecipice of figuring out something\nthat's uh gonna open a new door yeah\nservice is such a\nunderestimated habit and ritual and\nhearing you speak about it in that way\nis\nso life-giving because I think it's one\nof those things as you said we've just\ncompletely taken out of society it\ndoesn't really exist in our vocabulary\nit doesn't really exist in our\nrecommendation to people or as an\nantidote to anything but as you're\nsaying in in the recovery Community it\nseems to be a big pillar and a big part\nof that\ndo you do you remember an opportunity\nwhere you got to serve or something\nwhere you tried to do something like\nthat where you felt the benefits that\nyou just described was there a\nparticular example I mean I don't know\nif there's a particular one that sticks\nout but I think even to piggyback off\nwhat you were just saying in terms of\nsociety even with this culture of like\nokay now we are working on our mental\nhealth now I'm in therapy now I'm you\nknow eating healthy now I'm working out\nnow I'm doing Bikram Yoga like whatever\nlike all of those things are fantastic\nright like those are all great things of\nof the self-care model that we have now\nbut they can still without the balance\nof service you're still thinking about\nme me me me right like what do I need\nright now how how can I get my life you\nknow I need to talk about my trauma and\nall of that and that's again\nfantastic it's still easy to be thinking\nabout self in all of those practices and\ncan you actually have all of that in\nthat still balance am I thinking and\nshowing up for other people and that can\nbe as simple as you know picking up a\nphone call that you feel like you're too\nbusy to take that can be as easy as\nlistening to to a story of someone\num when you feel like you know you're\nrunning and gunning and you're trying to\nkeep up with everything in life and just\nslowing down and showing up for for\nothers when you don't want to that's the\nthing is like because services\nin a way there's still a selfish\ncomponent of service because you are\nstill\nyou know this feels good there's\nsomething that feels good about it but\nyou're actually you know benefiting\nothers at the same time yeah and it's so\ncounter-intuitive right like we\nconstantly feel like we have to focus on\nourselves to solve things but the\nstudy's actually back up what you're\nsaying as well there's so many studies\non depression that show that even people\nwho are depressed who support other\npeople are going through depression are\nhappier than those who are not\nsupporting that community and so right\neven about supporting that same\nCommunity makes such a huge difference\nand I I know that for sure in my own\nlife that that was the Insight that\nsaved me too was because for me the\nchange happened that I worked harder on\nmyself in order to serve people better\nso what you're saying by the balance it\nwas like the more I try to serve others\nthe more I realized that I needed to be\npurified yeah that's real and so then I\nworked on my purification in cleansing\nso that I could yes try and give back\nbetter and again this is a daily process\nI haven't arrived either but that cycle\nbecame a really beautiful cycle where\nit's like let me work on myself so I can\ngive my best to others yes now that I've\ngiven my best I need to refuel and then\nthat becomes this beautiful Journey that\nyou go on as a human and I feel like for\nme I'm I'm there today too where I'm\ntrying to pour out\ninto people and then I'm trying to pour\nin so that I have more Purity to pour\nout that's a really good observation and\nI think that\nyeah it is a cycle it's a constant you\nknow evolution of like oh my god I've\nbeen giving so much like now I need to\nrefill the tank you know the spiritual\ntanker or whatever it is\num that that does get depleted and that\nthere is this balance that needs to be\nfound it's much easier said than done\nyeah of course absolutely how have your\nlyrics and music changed at that time\nbecause I feel like you know a lot of\nmusicians feel they often write their\nbest stuff in the worst times in the\ndarkest times because it's raw it's real\nlike you can connect to people's\nemotions and people also feel that way\nso they can see themselves in your music\nright how have you felt as You observe\nyour music evolving and with the two new\nsingles like\nhas that has that impacted the music or\ndo you feel you're writing from a place\nof always working on yourself and that's\nwhat connects with people I think that\nI'm always working on myself you know I\nwas you know just in the coffee shop an\nhour hour and a half ago and I get the\ncoffee and I go to the bathroom and I'm\nlike you know I just felt this wave of\ndepression and I'm like huh like where\nwhere is that coming from I didn't find\nan answer the darkness is always there I\ndon't have clinical depression by any\nmeans I'm you know someone that I would\nlike to think is like relatively happy\nbut I do go through lows I'm a human I'm\ngoing through this this spiritual\nexperience in this human form but I I\nfelt this wave and I was like I wonder\nif if Jay ever feels this wave of\ndepression which I do want to hear if\nyou do but like but I also had this this\nthought of like you know this is what\ncreates art right if we were always just\nlike this or if it was just kept going\nup and it just got better and better\nuntil we died and then we're out here uh\nit wouldn't be interesting like I need\nto feel those you know moments of\nelation and translate that to music I\nneed to feel those moments of of\nDarkness uh you know sometimes it's\nself-inflicted sometimes it's just that\nway that you don't know where it's\ncoming from but it's like this blanket\nof Darkness over you and you're like man\nI gotta fight through this right now\num but it all makes great music yeah it\nall makes great art if you Channel it\nyeah but do you feel that yeah I think I\nI want to answer your question there's\nsome things I could relate to when I was\nin my teens and I first started hearing\nabout depression and that time it wasn't\nthe norm to talk about those things like\ntoday as you said we're we're trying to\ntalk more about these things but when I\nwas in my teens when I first had someone\nwas depressed in my head I was like how\ncan you be depressed you have everything\nlike that was I was one of those people\nwho looked at a friend who seemed like\nthey had it all together and couldn't\nfathom or understand\nhow they could be depressed right it's\nlike you make good money well you know\nyou you have a good situation you know\nyou're a good looking dude like what's\nwhat's your you get women like right I\nhad that very basic view as a teenager\nand then I felt it for the first time\nwhen I left the monastery so I lived as\na monk for three years majority of it in\nIndia and when I left that's the first\ntime I felt depressed and I was around\n25 going on 26 and that was the first\ntime it hit me in my entire life and\nthat was because I had a plan and I had\na direction I was going in and it didn't\nwork out yeah and all of a sudden I had\nI wouldn't even say a wave I would say a\nvery strong sense of depression and I\ndidn't even let myself admit it to\nmyself at the time because I was so\nscared about what would happen if I\nadmitted it and so if you asked me\nduring that time I would have said I'm\nfine and it was only years later that I\nwas able to locate and say actually I\nwas depressed during that time I just\nwas scared to even say it out loud\nbecause I didn't know who to say it to\nand it was then where my monk skills and\ntools that I'd learned actually came to\nhelp me\nand give me that direction now today\nthat was\nthat was nearly 10 years ago since I\nleft so it's been a long time and I'd\nsay today that\nI get sad thoughts I get depressive\nthoughts but it's two things one is they\ndon't last as long anymore because I\nfound a process and tools of what to do\nwith them and the second thing is I see\nthem as useful yeah as you said as\ninsight into what can be changed\ntransformed grown what work needs to\nhappen right so now they're not things\nthey're trying to avoid or things I'm\nsaying are bad or labeling them as\nnegative I accept that as a human you\nwill always have thoughts but it's your\nchoice what you want to do with them and\nI've now learned skills and tools that\nallow me to process them differently\nthan I would have 10 years ago right and\nso it's not that you will never I don't\nthink there's anyone on the in the world\nwho could never have a negative thought\nor a tough thought or a difficult\nthought\nbecause the world is put in such a way\nthat there's constantly conflict there's\nconstantly uncertainty right\nso unless you're numb from it all\nthere's going to be something that gets\nbeneath your skin or something that gets\ninto you but it's what you do with that\nit's kind of like saying\nwishing for a day where it stops raining\nand stops being cold it's like that's\nnever going to happen the weather's\ngonna be the weather yeah it's gonna\nrain it's gonna get cold it's gonna snow\nand you either have your umbrella and\nyour snow boots ready to go or you're\ngoing to be cold and wet yeah and so I\nthink for me it's like I'm focusing on\nwhat's my umbrella what's my snow boots\nwhat's my raincoat you know what are\nthose tools and habits and practices\nthat help me through that does that make\nsense 100 yeah I love it yeah I'd be\nlying if I said I don't have sad\nthoughts or and I think we have to get\nout of that because I think we all deep\ndown believe\nthat we will one day get to a place\nwhere you don't feel that way and that\nkind of I feel stops us from getting\nthere I don't know if you've ever sensed\nthat yeah I you kind of think about\ngetting over something we both talked a\nlot about getting through stuff yes and\nwith it but I feel like in society we\nhave this idea of you you're an addict\nand now you've recovered right and you\nsaid I'm in recovery and yes I'm\nguessing that's language that lost yes\ncompletely yeah it's interesting you\nsaid that because I the first time that\nI went to India I was 19 years old and I\ndid a three days silent meditation and\non the third day I remember like I\ncouldn't meditate I never had really\nmeditated I'm trying to calm the Mind\nfollow the breath I have no idea what\nI'm doing and my business is never going\nto work for me on the third day\nI was like up in the hills I was looking\nout over you know a mountainous terrain\nand you know I'm watching the trees and\nI'm closing my eyes and and the trees\nare still and you know I'm seeing it\nthrough my eyelids and the the breeze\ncame through and I had this moment of\nmeditation where I I didn't have any\nthoughts you know or whatever version\nthat was I thought that I was having\nthis experience and\num\nand I felt this wave of just like this\nwarm peace this sustained whether it was\nthree or ten seconds or whatever and\num\nit was this contentment that I don't\nknow that I'd ever really felt\nand it was interrupted with the\nthought of\nbut you're gonna lose this but you're\ngonna go back\nand I think that there was a that part\nof that was like but you're gonna go\nback to drugs but you're gonna go back\nto depression but you'll never be able\nto sustain this\nand part of I think what the compulsion\naround using for me is is like you know\nyou get that moment of ah you know like\nI've turned off the thoughts or like you\nknow the the drink hits or the drug hits\nand now I'm you know equanimous in my in\nmy you know being and you know I feel\nI'm high\nI I like the effects of this drug and um\nand then you go down and then you're\ntrying to find that high again when\nreally for me what I've experienced is\nthe most sustained period of happiness\nthat can be achieved is through a\npractice of clearing the mind\num now do I meditate presently not at\nall not at all as I'm saying all this\nI'm like bro why why aren't you\nmeditating man you got to get back\num but yeah I just you know I I remember\nthat feeling of peace and and\nimmediately being like but you're not\ngoing to be able to hold on to this it's\na lack of a practice Yeah and and that's\nthat challenge right it's like\nconstantly wanting to hold on to\nanything yeah and constantly want to go\nback to anything both of those thoughts\nI think is what I'm referring to and it\nseems like we're aligned it's that\nyeah I feel like those are the two\nthoughts that actually keep us the most\ntrashed completely so I want to hold on\nto this and I want to go back to that\nand those two things keep you trapped\nfor forever and ever and ever because\nnow you can't experience and you can't\npresent and you can't be yeah and and it\ntakes you everywhere and you know\ntowards more the beginning you were\ntalking about you're like you know life\nand death like that's you you've had\nnear-death experiences yeah and\nthat's\none of the most challenging emotions and\nobviously no one ever wants to go back\nto feeling that way\ntalk us through that of having a\nnear-death experience and how that\nimpacts you when you reflect on\nsomething like that the near-death\nexperiences they're not linear in terms\nof the\num you know I kept going down down down\nit was rock bottom and then I almost\ndied it wasn't that necessarily you know\nit can you know just be like\nyes I wasn't in a great place I was in\nactive addiction and I use this drug and\nthat drug and I ended up in the hospital\nand my heart was beating out of my chest\nthat type of thing but I think\nof\nthis moment where\num I was withdrawing off of Oxycontin I\nwas just crying\nI was crying I was in the middle of the\nstreet it was summertime in Seattle\nwhich is like the most beautiful place\nin the world I'm biased but it was the\nmost it's the most beautiful place in\nthe world in the summer time and I'm\nthere and I can't stop crying and I see\nno future for happiness\nall my serotonin was completely depleted\nI was 100\nreliant on this drug for any sort of\ncrane to pull me out of a place of\nwanting to die and I think that these\nnear-death experiences yes I have had\nactual like you know you were close\nmoments\num and you know ended up in the hospital\nmoments close to you know death but\neven more scary than those\nare those moments where you don't care\nit can even go a step further than you\ndon't care it goes to a place of I don't\nwant to be here those are super super\nscary in hindsight in the moment it's\nlike\ntake me well yeah take me I'm not\nfighting anymore I'm not fighting for\nlife anymore I I've I've gone down the\ntrail deep enough into the forest of\nthis that I am fine to just\nleave this physical space that's scary\nyeah it definitely is I I you're\nreminding me of I had a conversation\nwith Dennis Rodman like three years ago\nnow on the podcast\nand I asked him what his purpose in life\nwas and he said to survive another day\nlike to live another day and to have\nsomeone say that in front of you like in\nan interview I was like it really took\nme aback because you're not expecting\nthat Aid that much honesty but but in\nthat moment that much yeah you know\nvulnerability as well and I know he's\nsurrounded by a good group of people who\nare supporting him and helping him but\nit was scary even to experience and you\nknow you've had your partner your wife\nwho's been such a big part of your\njourney you know you've spoken about her\nmusic like she's been such a supporting\nfigure obviously she loves you that's\nthat's without a doubt and you love her\nbut what do you think has allowed her to\nbe a supportive and helpful partner\nduring this time\nand how have you tried to help her help\nyou sometimes you may have got it wrong\nsometimes you know but tell me a bit\nabout what she's done exceptionally well\nyeah and then when you've helped her\nhelp you in an exceptional way but then\nsometimes when maybe you haven't helped\nthe situation yeah oh it's a good\nquestion you know my wife is is a is\namazing she's a big fan of of you she's\nsuper excited she to come today all\nright she's she's not here she's she's\ndirecting a music video actually so\nshe's in the midst of planning for that\ntell her I said my love I I definitely\nI'll send a gift we'll have to send\nsomething with you yeah she's she's a\nmassive fan so\num it's cool to talk about her she's\num yeah she's my best friend she's\namazing she um I think first and\nforemost you know I was in I was in\nrehab in 2008.\nand I had been with her for you know\nsince 2006.\nso we're you know a couple years into a\nrelationship\nand she was supposed to come up and\nvisit me in rehab and all the families\nshow up you know the the commencement of\ngroup therapy starts my at the time\ngirlfriend wasn't there and she had\nended up getting arrested on the way up\nshe was still drunk from the night\nbefore after that she never went to\ntreatment\nshe did some some 12-step work but she\nhas never used sense and she was\ndefinitely you know one of us like one\nof me an addict and an alcoholic and\num never had that off switch but the way\nthat she has shown up for me is that she\nhas stayed clean\nand for herself first and foremost\nfoundational level and we just\ncelebrated last Friday her uh 14 years\nof of sobriety and I got to watch her\ntake her take her coin go up to the\nfront of the meeting in front of you\nknow 100 people and take her coin and\nshe's all nervous and you know I have\ntears in my eyes and I'm just like this\nis my person I'm rooting for her more\nthan anything\num to be clean and to be healthy and\nit's something and she has done\nsomething that I haven't been able to do\nwhich is continuously stay clean and\num it's a complex question you know like\nhow do I help her help me the one thing\nabout the disease of addiction is that\nit is Insidious and that when I am an\nactive addiction it starts before I\nactually pick up the first drink or drug\nit starts slowly and it creeps and it\nescalates and it starts telling me you\nknow what no one's around No One's Gonna\nknow you can do that all of a sudden I'm\nin self-will I'm not in God's will\nanymore I'm in self-will what do I want\nand that selfishness Rises and Rises and\nRises and it can start with simple\nthings you know just like you deserve\nthat like go ahead buy that hmm omit\nthat these these little ways that it\njust starts creeping creeping creeping\ngetting louder and for me all of a\nsudden it leads me to this place of none\nof that works like material possession\nto feel happy does not work for me you\nknow like go ahead get another watch go\nahead get that jacket get those shoes\nyou know do that have that experience\nyou deserve it it doesn't spiritually\nfulfill me so now I'm like I'm on empty\nin the spiritual tank and I'm reaching\nfor anything come on more more more how\ndo I fulfill how do I fill this void\nthis this God's eyes hole what how what\ndo I do with this\nand eventually I start to think\nuh a drink or a drug sounds like the\nbest idea because I hate myself now\nhow can I help my wife help me in those\nmoments it's counterintuitive because\nwhen I'm in active addiction and the\ndisease is talking to me I don't want to\ntell anybody the disease is like don't\ntell her\nno she doesn't care you know the lies\nthe lies that I'm telling to myself in\norder to act out\nare getting increasingly loud it's a\nvery you know I probably sound crazy\nright now but it's um you're educating\nthat's how the disease works for me and\nI think unless you have the disease and\nmaybe it sounds crazy but that's\nactually the narrative that's slowly\nhappening whether I'm conscious or\nunconscious in my head to get me to the\npoint of hating myself enough that a\ndrink or a drug sounds like the best\nsolution so\nI have to tell her I have to be honest\nand she has seen enough relapses at this\npoint that she's like dude what are you\ndoing you're in self-will right now\nwhere when was the last time that you\ncalled your sponsor one of you got\noutside of self when have you done\nsomething in your recovery Community why\ndon't you go to a meeting she holds me\naccountable even when I don't want to be\nheld accountable and usually I can tell\nbecause she she'll say something and if\nI'm naturally defensive\nif I'm like no you don't know what I'm\ndoing you know\nusually I'm like okay she's got she's\ngot a pulse she knows me very well and\nshe's trying to help you dude like you\nknow if she says you know sometimes she\ncan miss misread the room\nand I can completely hold that space and\nlisten to her and be like I I understand\nthat I could be doing better and these\nthese categories but I'm actually\nfeeling pretty good right now and I\nwelcome that from people in my life like\nI think part of\naddiction is that\nit's it has to be secret you know even\nyou talk about 10 years ago with like\nyou know this depression that you're\nlike I feel like I I had to be okay I\nhad to be fine I had to tell people I\nwas fine\nand there's the secrecy with addiction\nthat we can't talk about it that when\nthose thoughts come in or in recovery\nand I'm like I'm a person in recovery I\nhave to be like you know holding up\nthese pillars and now I'm a public\nfigure in recovery and I need to be it's\nlike dude I am still I am just like\neveryone else completely fallible and so\nfar from who I want to be yeah but the\nmore people that I can talk about that I\ncan talk to where I'm not a secret that\nis when I share my truth\nand it opens up a platform for other\npeople to or when they share their truth\nall of a sudden I feel comfortable in\nthe space to tell mine yeah the disease\ndissipates and by the way you don't in\nyour words don't sound crazy at all\nactually I feel like you're educating us\nand enlightening us on what's going on\ninside and so actually I'm learning a\nlot and I appreciate it a lot because I\ndon't think we\nwe only watch these if it doesn't happen\nto us you only watch it from the outside\nright and you have no idea what the\ndialogue in someone's mind is and so\nhearing what dialogue you've had in your\nmind right is massively Illuminating\nbecause like you referred to mine I I\nagree with that on so many levels and\nthat's that wasn't even addiction that\nwas that was a form of depression that I\nwas experiencing and couldn't vocalize\nit what to speak of something when\nyou're going through addiction yeah and\nand I couldn't agree with you more that\nwhether it's something tiny or whether\nit's something huge if we don't talk\nabout it you actually never learn like I\nI had a very non-life-threatening\nsurgery recently like it's pretty\nroutine it's inconvenient but it's not\nlike you know it's not I'm not gonna\nyou know die from it like that's not\nwhat kind of surgery it is and me even\njust telling some of my friends about\nthat I found out a quarter of my friends\nhave had that surgery but never told me\nlike no one ever talks about it and I\nknow it's not a big deal but the point\nis that knowing that they'd had it and\nknowing that they'd been through the\nsurgery and knowing that they'd\nrecovered or knowing where they'd had\nstruggles was useful yep what to speak\nof addiction or something that's far\nmore detrimental to your health and\nwell-being yeah you know I can totally\nunderstand why being able to share that\nand and I really love the point you're\nmaking about\nand and this is partly societal and\nourselves is you just explained a lot of\nroles like I'm a public figure in\nrecovery I'm uh I'm uh this in this I'm\na music artist who was addicted whatever\nso we we create all these titles and\nroles and designations that are not the\nreal us and Society forces us to play\nthem and we force it there was a lyric\nthat I I love this is probably one of my\nfavorite songs that you've done I was\ntalking to my uh I have a meditation\nprogram that I've created for com and we\nwere just there recording before this\nand so we I'm recording for like four\nhours just teaching meditations and I\nwas speaking to my producer I'm really\ngood friends with his name is Ben too uh\nsaying that you were coming on the show\nhe loves rap too and so I was sharing\nthat you were coming on and we've then\nstarted talking about some of our\nfavorite songs he was saying this one\nwas his and I was like oh me too it's a\nlight tunnels uh and and there was this\nlyric that um that I thought was really\npowerful for what we're talking about\nright now you say uh they want the\ngossip they want the drama they want\nBritney Spears to make out with Madonna\nthey want Kanye to run and go on longer\nbecause that equates to more dollars\nthey want talking topics they want\ntrending topics you know etc etc and so\nyou know it's it's that idea that we're\ntrying to create Society is trying to\ncreate these identities right for us and\nthen we kind of try and live up to those\nidentities how do you in this moment\ndisconnect from that and go well\nactually yes people may say I'm a public\nfigure going through recovery I'm a\nmusic artist doing this how have you\nfound a way over time to not subscribe\nto that identity and be like no I'm Ben\nI'm you know who who are you today like\nhow do you create that disconnect things\nthat help my kids\ngetting off of social media\nagain not to be redundant but my my\ncommunity in recovery\nI think we're all trying to get back to\nthat place whether you're in the public\nyou know space or not it's\nthe idea of who am I really at the core\nand\nI've always used used art as a medium to\nfind out my own truth and to find out\nwho I am as a person but it's all the\nthings that we're kind of discussing\nit's like and that you were talking\nabout in terms of service too like you\nknow doing your own work and then\nputting it back and then going back and\nforth in this cycle I think it's getting\nexercise I think it's clearing the mind\nI think that it's um picking up the\nphone I think that it's like I I think\nit's these small little acts throughout\nthe course of a day that that you\nrealize that all of this is so fleeting\nand then it that it's not real it's not\nall of that world that's in light\ntunnels that we're speaking about it's\nas real as we make it and I think that\nit's really challenging to divorce\nyourself from media when you are a part\nof the media when you are a part of a a\ntopic or you know you can I could throw\nout 10 celebrities names in like the\nfirst you know you'll have thoughts and\njudgments right away when you hear\nsomeone's name\nand we've put people we've\ncompartmentalized people we put them\ninto boxes we don't really get to know\nwho they are and I think that that's why\nlong-form podcasts or you know\nconversations are have helped to kind of\nreshape how we view certain people\num and are actually really beneficial to\nget to know individuals outside of uh a\nheadline now the unfortunate part is and\nalso for how short our attention spans\nare\nand now you know we you know five second\nincrements 15 second increments we're\nscrolling we're moving on we can't\nretain information we're on to the next\nit's really dope to see that like\nlong-form podcast there's a lane for\nthis where either it's super fast or\nlike I'm gonna listen to Joe Rogan for\nthree hours yeah you know what I mean\nand like\nand I think that that's because people\nare longing for something\ndeeper they want to hear\nconversation\nthey want to see the evolution of of\ndialogue start here and go here you know\nlike that is what actually is real we\nare not\nwe we are not creatures that operate in\nin three to five second increments\num there is a flow in an evolution and I\nthink that explaining who who we really\nare you know our Character defects our\nflaws our shortcomings to the things\nthat make us brilliant and unique\num\nto really examine those yeah is is what\nthis life really is all about yeah and\nthat the rest of it\num is something is a hurdle to get over\nI I love that analysis of it I really do\nbecause you said earlier you you said\nwe're Spiritual Beings having this Human\nExperience\nand I think a lot of people on their\nspiritual Journeys or their inner\nJourneys at one point you get caught\nin the evolution of it where it's hard\nbeing a spiritual being having a human\nexperience like you're like how do I\nmake music\nin this world but then not feel of this\nworld right like that becomes a really\ntough thing and I've worked on that\npersonally I work on it personally I\nwork with so many people on it\npersonally and I find that the natural\nhuman instinct is to retreat yes it's\nlike to remove ourselves and when I\nbecame a monk I think subconsciously\nthat's exactly what I was doing where I\nwasn't escaping because I didn't have a\na bad experience with the material world\nI could just see from other people's\nexperiences that the material world\nwasn't satisfying to them yes I could\nsee people who were more successful than\nme more wealthy than me more you know\neverything than me I was 21 years old\nand I could see that they weren't happy\nand so I was like okay well I need to\nfigure out a different path and I gained\nthree years of getting time to figure\nout what my values were and who I was\nand why I wanted to do anything\nand then coming back like I find that\ntoo today where it's like I'm not a monk\nanymore I'm married I I have I have\nbusinesses we have we we have money like\nyou know things like that\nand it was like I had to make peace and\nsense of those ideas for what they meant\nto me and what their use was without\nthem defining me or me trying to\ndistance myself from them so I think\nwhen we first we Chase things yep and\nthen we run away from them until we\nfigure out how to use them properly yes\nno it's on your Instagram today\nand you know a massive way that we size\npeople up or that we gauge success is by\nnumbers right analytics and find our own\nvalue right like how did this Tick Tock\ndo why did this one work in this one\ndidn't it yeah you know I really liked\nwhat I said in in this one and yeah and\nno one really no one shared it yeah why\nyeah I mean that's part of your business\nyeah yet your platform is based around\nlike mental health which in a way our\nsociety and and yet the way that you\ntalk about this is via Tick Tock via\nInstagram via these social media things\nthat have got our societies stuck in\nthis place of comparison in this place\nof of ego in this place of I am lesser\nthan I am not enough look at all of\nthese other people's lives I am living\nscrolling these death Scrolls that we do\nI feel horrible about myself call\nculture that is really addictive how do\nyou balance the game that you have to\nplay yet with the spiritual mental\nhealth side that you have to live yeah\ndefinitely it's such a great question\nand\nI'd say that so I started doing what I\ndo today offline when I was 18 years old\nso after I met the monk for the first\ntime which I talk about my book think\nlike a monk I I met my first monk\nteacher at 18 years old and I started\nspending time with him and whatever he\nwould teach me I would share it right\nbecause I was so blown away by it so I\nstarted a club or a society as we called\nhim in England uh a society in at\nUniversity at College called think out\nloud and every single week I'd invite\nstudents over and we'd sit and we'd\ndissect a movie and talk about it\nphilosophically psychologically\nspiritually and I would facilitate these\nsessions and when I first started them\nlike zero people showed up because it's\nlike people at 18 want to get drunk and\ngo to the club they don't want to come\nto a society to think out loud yeah and\nso then I started handing out posters\nand flyers because I realized that I had\nto do a bit of marketing to make sure\npeople were interested\nand then people started coming and so by\nthe time I finished University we had\n100 people coming yeah and no one paid\nfor it it was absolutely free I did it\nbecause I loved it I did it because I\ngot the buzz of presenting what I was\nlearning to people and helping them and\nI built some of my best friendships that\nway because I met all these people at\nUniversity who were like oh yeah we we\nJay helps us understand the stuff he's\nlearning from the monks and the wisdom\nsame stuff I do today\nand then when I went to the monastery\nobviously I actually spent time studying\nand deepening my meditation and actually\ndeepening my skills and since I've come\nback I've done the same thing so I've\nbeen doing this offline when no one\ncared and no one viewed and no one\nwatched and there were no followers and\nthere was no money for 10 years before I\ndid it online so up until six years ago\nif you came to one of my events in\nLondon called conscious Living 10 people\nshowed up once a month to hear me talk\nabout these same things that I talk\nabout today it sounds like my\nunderground rap career right yeah\nexactly that's that's basically what it\nis it's like and I did it for 10 years\nnot thinking one day it would be big I\ndid it because I loved it I love this so\nyeah I went from it yeah I loved it I\ndid it for 10 years with no money no\nfollowers no nothing yeah and it was\namazing even when 10 people showed up I\nwas so grateful yeah so then when six\nyears ago this kind of took off and then\nthe last couple of years it's really\nblown up\nI live in gratitude every day and yes I\nam massively aware of what connects with\npeople and what resonates with people\nbut my intentions different my intention\nis How Deeply can I speak\nwhat I'm learning and what I've learned\nso that it scales and gives access to\neveryone so I'm not basing myself worth\non how many people like it I'm basing my\nability to simplify ideas on that and\nthat's just one part of me right my\nself-worth is based on how I feel about\nmyself how my wife thinks about me\nbecause she knows me really well right\nhow my monk teachers feel about what I\ndo and my best friends who've been my\nbest friends for like nearly 20 years\nlike those are the people whose opinion\nmatters deeply to me my community here\nmatters to me but at the same time my\nself-worth is not based on that my\nability to do my job well and the\npurpose I've chosen is based on that and\nI think like you're saying that isn't a\nperfected formula it's a Daily\nCommitment yes to can I improve my\nability to communicate but this isn't me\nimproving who I am this is me improving\nmy ability to communicate seemingly\ncomplexity ideas in a way that everyone\ncan understand and digest them but\nthat's just one percent of who I am\nthat's not that's not me an entirety if\nthat makes sense it does yeah do you\nlook at the numbers of course I do yeah\n100 I I think it's hard to do what I do\nwithout looking at the numbers it's just\nthat the numbers don't dictate like I\nwon't go to sleep upset at myself as a\nhuman being as a soul because of a\nnumber going badly I will just be like\nthere is a defect in my process of\ncommunicating or effectively\ntransferring this message that I can\nwork on but if I think this is a problem\nwith me yeah that's too heavy and that's\nwhere I think the disconnect is hey dude\nyou can always blame the algorithm yeah\nI always blame the algorithm I don't\nlike doing that that's when in doubt I'm\none of those people that I will sit down\nwith people I'll be like the issue is\nnever well yeah very rarely is the issue\nactually the algorithm from my six years\nof social media experience the issue is\nyour ability to understand\nwhat is going on but again that's not\nyou and so and I think that's what we've\nnot learned how to differentiate our\nalbum sales from our self-worth right or\nour social media following from our\nself-worth and identity so to me there\nare two things this I need to improve\nprofessionally but my professional\nfailure is not a personal failure and I\nthink that I'm always grappling with\nthat again I have not arrived this is a\ndaily conversation in my yeah but I feel\nhealthier that I want to figure out how\nto fix this for this but fixing that is\nnot fixing this these are two separate\nlike I meditate for me I don't meditate\nto improve my career\nand I don't focus on my career to\nimprove my feeling of me they're two\nseparate Lanes yeah if that makes sense\nit does I see success and happiness and\nI want to come to this to ask you I see\nsuccess and happiness as two separate\nLanes yes happiness is what I do for\nmyself and success is what my career\nbrings and what it can achieve but I\ndon't cross the two because uh that's\nwhen I think it gets messy for me and I\nwanted to ask that like as you've gone\nthrough so many highs and lows successes\nand losses\nhow have you how do you define success\nand happiness for yourself right now\nlike how do you look at those terms and\nwhat do they mean to you now compared to\nwhat they meant to you like 10 15 years\nago right and I hope I'll answer you a\nquestion yeah you did yeah beautifully\nhonestly it was just an honest answer\nyeah yeah no I I think about success\nvery different\nand I get caught up in The Matrix of\neverything of course but am I fulfilled\nhappiness is fleeting right the more we\ntry to grab onto it the further it gets\num do I have sustained fulfillment do I\nhave meaning do I have purpose do I have\na life that is worth living do I feel\nexcited to wake up most days am I\nengaged with my kids all of those things\nthat to me is what success feels like\ntoday now I also have a business I have\nmultiple businesses and I like to win\nI'm a competitive person me too I get\nthat I do like to win now winning I\nthink is a is a tricky thing right\nbecause oftentimes we don't know what we\nnever know what's in store I might drive\naway from here and you know crash down\nthe hill and that's it you you don't\nknow and I think about\nyou know what I want you know in the\nlast two singles that you've mentioned I\nthought that they're really great pieces\nof Art\nthought that they were you know\nhad potential for like you know Chan\nit's like it's got this endemic hook and\nyou know it's it's got a feature that\npeople know and I'm rapping really well\nand the beat gets really big\nhasn't performed well\ncommercially Maniac sounds like\nsomething that could be on the radio and\nyou know it kind of is but it's bubbling\nslowly but it's not really streaming\nwell all these things I have a team of\npeople that are trying to figure out\nthat we're trying to figure out why this\nworked why this didn't work and um I\nrealize that the universe is already\nit's already been written I believe that\nwhat's supposed to be will be and when I\ncan get in that place of acceptance that\nregardless of what happens with chance\nregardless of what happens with Maniac\nor the next single or my album and how\nmany first week sales it does on YouTube\nnumbers and if I grow my Tick Tock\naudience all of that is not happiness it\nis completely\nseparate and if I get too caught up in\nthat like you're saying if I get too\ncaught up in that world then I cannot\ntruly be fulfilled and have meaning in\nmy spiritual life which\nis where the true like\nI'm just okay I'm just okay with what is\nand I don't control it and some of the\nmost painful experiences where I was\nlike why is this happening to me like\nGod why would you do this to me were my\ngreatest blessings were the things that\nopened up the door for something and it\nsounds cliche it's like you know but you\nhave to go through those moments of pain\nyou have to walk through that fire to\nget to that place of oh I had no idea\nwhy I was doing that and now I am here\nand look at how beautiful this moment is\nand I think that the trick is\num\nremembering in those moments of of why\nwhy is this happening that there is a\ndeeper reasoning and that this will pass\nyeah totally yeah the way I was thinking\nabout what you were saying and well I\nwas sharing earlier and it's that\nimagine you just bought a brand new car\nyou love it you think it's beautiful\nit's great and you go driving and you\nsing when you drive out here and you're\ndriving your car\nand then someone knocks into it and it\ngets a dent and it's a really bad Dent\nthat means you can't drive it needs to\nget fixed it needs to get sorted out now\nwhen I get out of that car and I get\ninto bed that night\nif I'm thinking I'm dented\nthat's just inaccurate the truth is\nsomething I have something I care about\nis dented and that needs to be fixed\nright but I'm not dented because my\ncause dented I'm not damaged because my\ncar is damaged my cause damage needs to\ngo to the shop and needs to get fixed\nbut that doesn't damage me and I think\nthat's that disconnect where it's like\nyeah like when you're saying like the\nalbum sales isn't all right whatever it\nis it's like yeah that needs to be fixed\nthat needs to be sorted out but that\ndoesn't mean that I'm broken that just\nmeans that there is a system mechanism\nwhich somehow how we're creating how\nwe're building that can be improved yeah\nright and so to me and and I love the\npoint that you're saying that to me it's\nalso\nan alignment of\nhow much we're creating and what we're\ncreating I find that when I make\nsomething out of alignment it's more\nlikely to fail\nwhen I make something from a place of\nI'm making this because I really believe\nin it I care about it I've actually\nfocused on getting good at it and now\nI'm putting it out there it has a better\nchance of doing well yeah versus when I\nput something out because I'm like I can\ndo this I know I can do this because I\nhave this and so I think when people are\nlike oh I have followers so I can do\nthis right but you don't really want to\ndo that you're just doing that because\nyou have followers and I think there's a\nstudy that shows how\nafter someone sells a company in the\nnext two years they make their worst\ninvestment decisions why because now\nthey have money yeah so they make bad\ninvestment decisions when you didn't\nhave money you made better investment\ndecisions because you were so careful\nand so thoughtful about it yeah and so I\nfind like sometimes abundance leads to\nstupidity because\nabundance needs to be treated with love\nand respect\nas opposed to with abandon and and\nwastage yeah but you brought up a good\nyeah yeah in terms of you know the 10\npeople that would come out in London\nyeah to talk and what your intention was\nand I think that\nfor all of us but particularly being in\nin the public eye it's constantly moving\nthat needle back to what is my intention\nhere yes what is my intention yes and\nif you're in the studio and and or you\nknow I'm in the studio and I'm creating\na record if I'm going into it like this\nis the one that's going to be on the\nradio that song sucks yes thank you that\nsong is horrible yes no one wants to\nhear that and the public is smarter than\nwe give the public credit for they can\ntell when an artist doesn't know another\nartist and they just made a song because\nthe labels were like you know what one\nplus one equals three no it doesn't real\nart is felt yes authentic people yeah\nthat's that's what's contagious is when\npeople can actually feel and hear that\nauthenticity you can't manufacture that\nand again but with all the noise with\nall the white noise it's it's in the\nperiphery\nif I'm not centered if I'm not\nspiritually fit I am eventually going to\nfeel like guys we need a tick tock song\nwe need something that like is going to\nbe really catchy in a five second\nincrement and if we don't have that then\nI'm not going to be happy yeah and it\nhas been proven time and time again that\nthat's not how art Works yes and I think\nthat this fast food way of of of media\nright now in some ways can be great but\nin other ways it's it has my fear is\nthat it's killed the art it's it's\nkilled the overall Arc of an album or\nthe growth of an artist you know from\ntrack number one to song number 15 I've\nrealized in this in this album cycle\nthat I'm like in the beginning stages of\nputting out we don't take in media like\nthat anymore like the album is almost\nObsolete and um I don't ever want to get\nto a place of creating out of necessity\nto appease an algae Rhythm or a\nstructure that I don't believe in yeah I\ndon't believe in it now that's going to\nsay I'm not going to play the game with\nwhat I've created yeah but I don't want\nto create\nand then go play the game that is\nbrilliant I I love that if the intention\nin in The Vedas which is the the system\nthat I studied as a monk or The Vedic\ntradition it said that there's four\nmotivators or four intentions which were\nmy intention so the lowest form of\nintention is fear or insecurity we do\nsomething out of fear so it's like I'm\nnot relevant anymore right let's make\nsomething that makes me feel relevant\nright that's fear that's not from a\nplace of art so you make something from\na place of fear it might do well it\nmight blow up but you won't feel\nsatisfied because you know that you were\njust scared and now you're scared to do\nit again yeah so when you create a fear\nit just creates more fears for new\ncreativity because you don't know how\nyou got there the higher up from that is\nto have the intention of what you were\nsaying you have a Target or a goal but\nyou just plucked it out the air I want\nthat number one I want to build a\nbillion dollar company I wanna and now\nit's just about this goal because the\ngoal makes you feel good you don't\nactually feel good about what you're\nmaking but you like the idea of it might\nbecome a number one Whatever billboard\nor whatever it may be and so that's a\ngoal or Target higher than that\nintention is you're doing something\nbecause it feels true to you and then\nhigher than that is you're making\nsomething out of service\nor to improve people's lives or to\nimpact people so when you look at those\nfour intentions what I'm hearing is\nyou're like I want to try and make\nthings in those top two intentions yes\nand that way I'll be fulfilled and like\nyou said we can play the game with those\nthings too we'll still figure out a way\nto make those things relevant and\nimportant but we know that the art is\nsacred the art wasn't sold out and I\nthink that's what I Vibe with too like I\nI can totally get behind that because\nI always connect back to why I started\nand what connected and I love the joy of\nmaking something sacred go viral I get\nso much of a kick out of that rather\nthan making something sell out go viral\nbecause it would go viral anyway yeah\nthat's great dude like no you're\ninspiring this this is well I mean you\nthink about whenever I'm in the studio\nyou're trying to get to those top two\nand\nand it's almost an exercise\nwhen I'm in front of the page\nto work through those bottom two layers\nbecause they're there they're not always\nthere but they can pop up you know that\nlike can you do it again and then you\nsaid it like okay now you did it you're\nstill not fulfilled can you hold on to\nit and you watch people their entire\ncareers trying to hold on to that\nrelevancy yeah and it's just this game\nof like come on can we hold on to this\nthing that's like you know so we can be\nputting this Echelon and keep working\nand keep going and never take more than\na you know 14 months off of an album\ncycle we got to keep going what award\nshow are we showing it's exhausting it\nis exhausting and I couldn't keep up\nwith it and I realized that it really\num you know in the first couple months\nof being like really famous that this\nwas not sustainable for me that I needed\nto recharge that I needed to take take\ntime off to work on myself so when I go\ninto the studio I'm not operating out of\nthat place of fear of scarcity of you\nknow what if this doesn't happen it's\nlike dude\nand I think that that's easier said than\ndone when you had the success right when\nyou're like you know what I'm gonna be\ngood for Life yeah financially I'm\nstraight\njust be honest I'm gonna be okay but\nwhen you're you know when you're really\nyou know I'm trying to feed my family\nand I've been there too you know I'm\ntrying to you know make sure that I\ndon't overdraft that I'm that I you know\ncan pay this month's rent with my six\npeople I'm living with and you know I\nneed to get this show so there's there's\na privilege in being able to like be\nlike okay well like now I'm just working\non the spiritual side of myself\num and there's an actual real side of it\nyou know in terms of the the physical\nworld of I need to eat yeah I need to be\nable to pay for this roof over my head\nyeah but that's a great point but still\nI'm almost writing in that space to to\nget out the cobwebs of those first two\ntwo layers\nand get to a place of you know what bare\nminimum this does nothing at least we\nhad a great time\nin the studio at least I found out some\ntruth about myself at least this was an\nexercise where I got better at my craft\nand I enjoyed being creative and I got\ntogether with Community whoever was in\nthe studio and we made something that\nwill be around forever regardless of if\nit's viral or if it's a number one or\ntop 100 it doesn't matter we made\nsomething with pure intention and the\npeople that heard it were the people\nthat were supposed to and everything\nelse is outside of my control and if\nyou're a creative\nthen you just keep going yeah you just\nkeep going and I was like I was\nlistening to some old music that I had\nwritten in like you know 2004 or five or\nsomething the other day and there's this\nDennis Hopper sample and he's talking\nabout\num you know if you're an artist if you\nare really truly an artist\num your art is like breathing you have\nno choice but to create that that is the\nexercise\nand I want to be that person I am that\nperson I don't have to try to be that\nperson I just I am an artist and for\nthose of us that are there is no choice\nthe success is a bonus but at the end of\nthe day if I wasn't doing this for a\nliving sure I might have a different\nnine to five\nbut I can almost guarantee you that when\nI get home from work I'd be going right\nback to writing raps yeah and that and\nthat's what it is it's that love it's\nthat dedication and I love the clarity\nyou gave though of when you're on the\ncome up versus when you've created a\nplatform because\nI agree with you that sometimes fear and\nthe goal of survival are actually what\ngets you started and gets you going and\ngets you your first breakthrough it's\njust once you've had that please upgrade\nyeah right because if you don't upgrade\nat that point you're still driving in\ngear too yep and it's like but no no you\nwere meant to get to gear five by now\nand you're still going at gear two\nand it's like that's what takes you down\nthe other way and so I agree with you I\nthink you're right that I think it's\nsuch a great clarification I'm so glad\nyou brought that up that sometimes fear\nand the goal and the insecurity is what\ngets you moving yeah and there's nothing\nwrong with that it's just that it gets\nyou moving it's just not going to keep\nmomentum and\nI've just seen too many people just stay\non that gear too\nand and that's when you when it all\nbreaks down right so I I think that's\nthat's such a beautiful description\nwhere where are you\ntoday as you look to the Future as you\nlook to now as you look to to what\nyou're building and creating for\nyourself like what are the values that\ngovern your personal and professional\nlife today like what are some of the\nvalues that you're developing working on\nand and holding close to Your Heart\nRight Now honesty\nwith myself with my partner\nuh with my kids with my community I want\nto be\ntransparent in all facets of where I'm\nat I think that vulnerability honesty\ntelling the truth are constantly things\nthat I come back to that just make my\nlife more streamlined I don't want to\nhide anything I don't want this person\nto know this part of me and this person\nlike I want to be someone that can hold\nthat space of this is who I am and\num and I'm honest about it I want to\nhave integrity in that sense I want to\nkeep delving into the layers of my own\nCharacter defects of things that I need\nto work on of studying my past traumas\nin order to figure out my next step and\nto figure out where I'm at\num I want to I want to be a dad that\nlistens\nthat ask questions\nthat is there for the Beautiful Moments\nthe difficult ones that's super\nimportant to me and I realize that with\nmy lifestyle there's a frequency in our\nhouse right like my wife is working on a\nmillion things that have to do with all\nof our creative projects I am there's\npeople in and out of my house all the\ntime and I think that that frequency my\nkids I know they can feel it I know they\ncan feel the insanity of this creative\nlike you know home that we have that is\nbeautiful but it's also chaotic and I I\nwant to make sure that\num I'm taking time for those small\nmoments that is much of like this Rat\nRace that we're in to to do a media run\nand to you know go from here to the next\nthing to this and that I taking the time\nto really be present with my kids\nbecause it goes so quickly you know my\ndaughter's already you know my my eldest\nis seven and a half and it's like seems\nlike it's so cliche it seems like\nyesterday she was you know two months\nold and um I know that that's how life\nmoves and I just want to be someone that\nlike when I look back at it all through\nall the ups the Downs the triumphs the\nthe shortcomings that I can look back on\nit all and be like you know what\nI left something\nhere on this Earth I was I made some art\nthat impacted the world and that doesn't\nneed to be on a broad big broad brush\nstroke scale that can just be with a\ncouple individuals that I made some art\nthat resonated that changed some lives\nand not in a grandiose way but just like\nthe MCS that came before me underground\nrappers that changed the way I think\nabout life that you know I think about\nthere's this there's this rapper that\npassed\num from from the group Blackalicious his\nname's Gift of Gab\nand he passed last year and he had this\nthis era of of fantastic music and he\nand he passed away I didn't know he was\nsick and he passed away\num during covid\nand I remember just thinking like\nI never got to tell him what his music\nmeant to me and the spiritual\num the spirituality in his writing and\nhow that resonated with me when I was 18\nyears old that led me to delve into\nmyself via the pen and\num\nthat if it wasn't for him\nI might not have ever written other side\nI might not have ever written same love\nthat he actually gave me some tools that\nopened up this conduit that I was able\nto channel something bigger than myself\nin these moments that led to music that\nthen impacted others and that that music\ncould go on to to transfer in different\nways to a Next Generation that is what\nI'm seeking as a person and as an artist\nand I think that that you know when\nyou've had that platform you know or you\nhave a platform like I have there's this\ntendency to think that it has to be on\nthis massive scale and I don't want to\nthink about my life in this big you know\nopen canvas of a world like I need to\nyou know there needs to be millions and\nyou know a billion people that know who\nI am and lose what's right in front of\nme which is my seven-year-old my\nfour-year-old and my 14 month old or my\nwife and know that my family is there\nand that's\nat the very Forefront of what I care\nabout just as much as speaking to the\nrest of the world I don't want to miss\nthat man that's extremely powerful and\nuh I love that reflection coming through\nyou right now and channeling all those\nideas with us uh we end every episode\nwith two\nuh segments uh one's called the final\nfive which is uh every question has to\nbe answered in one word to one sentence\nmaximum so you have a sentence one word\ntwo one sentence you get you get

want\nthem to hear I never want my kids to\nbelieve that other people's opinion of\nthem\nis any of their business I agree that's\nbeautiful all right question number\nthree uh what is your current purpose in\nlife like how do you define your purpose\ntoday and the work you do and who you\nare my purpose is to create to explore\nand to show up for other people uh\nquestion number four if you could uh\nwhat's something you used to value that\nyou don't value anymore I used to Value\nsuperficial momentary escapism Fifth and\nfinal question we ask this to every\nguest on the show if you
