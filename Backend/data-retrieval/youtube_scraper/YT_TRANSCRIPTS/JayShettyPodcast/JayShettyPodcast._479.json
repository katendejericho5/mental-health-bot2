the\nrelease of that book was when we became\nfriends yeah the day it came out I went\non your show uh a NASDAQ a NASDAQ yeah\nin New York City I just started hearing\nabout you maybe a few months before and\nthen you'd reached out and I saw a\ncouple of your videos and I was like I\nreally like your style and we met I was\nlike let's just hang out all day I know\nit was amazing I didn't expect that\nbecause I was doing yeah so for anyone\nwho doesn't know I used to have a show\non NASDAQ reads which was called follow\nthe reader and I would try and sit down\nwith authors and talk to them and I was\nthankful enough that's where I met Ryan\nholiday and it's where I met a couple of\nother people in this space and I'd\nreached out to you because I'd always\nloved your work and usually an author\nwould come in you do the interview but\nyou'd promote the book and then they'd\nleave and this was the day your book\ncame out and you were like well why\ndon't we just spend the whole day\ntogether we're in a coffee shop together\nwe're in a Barnes and Noble together so\nfun and that's the beginning of our\nfriendship it was amazing man and now\nwe're here on another book launch yeah a\nand five years to write a book like five\nyears to be thinking about a book five\nyears to not it's so easy to just put\nfor you like with an amazing audience\namazing Community you could just put out\na book whenever you wanted to right what\nwere you working on what were you\nthinking about for five years I wanted\nto do this after the mask of masculinity\nand this was the thing that I was like\nthis is the thing that I wish I would\nhave had when I was you know 15 21 35\nthe book and the content that I wish I\ncould have had to understand the pain\nthat I was going through and now having\nbeen through a lot of different healing\nJourneys and healing a lot of different\nwounds that I had from my past I finally\nfelt like I was at a place of Peace\nwhere I could create abundantly as\nopposed to forcing something and when I\nwanted to start this five years ago\nwhich I've been kind of researching and\ntaking notes and having documents for a\nlong time in my interviews about this I\nhad the content but I didn't feel like I\nwas\nat a place where I felt like it was a\ngood coach to myself I felt like I was\nstill critical of a lot of things and\nstill beating myself up emotionally and\nmentally\nand I didn't feel like I would be\nauthentic in putting the content out\nuntil I was healing at a level of\nauthenticity internally wow so after two\nyears ago I felt like I finally\nkind of had a Tipping Point for a\nportion of my life that I was struggling\nwith my entire life 10 years ago I\nstarted opening up about healing sexual\nabuse and that type of trauma and that\nset me on a journey of healing for the\nnext five years many different things\nfrom my childhood from parent stuff\nthings like that and allowed me to\nevolve as a human be more courageous\nhave more authenticity all that stuff\nbe less triggered less reactional all\nthat stuff but I still kept repeating\ncertain patterns in relationships and\nyou've seen me in three different\nrelationships now since I've met you\nyeah and you probably were able to\nwitness a pattern from the previous two\nit's so hard to see the things\nuntil it gets really really bad\nsometimes when things are good and when\nthings are not so good it's hard to see\nit it's not until things get really\nchallenging or some big breakdown when\nwe start to wake up\nand it was the last relationship where I\nwas like man I keep repeating the\npatterns of something based on a wound I\nkeep choosing I keep staying I keep\nputting myself in these\nchallenging situations that I don't feel\nlike I need to but I haven't yet\nunlocked what that was whether I was\nafraid to face it or just not aware of\nit yet I hadn't fully embraced that\nhealing journey and so I started down a\nvery intensive you know coaching therapy\nexperience where I was doing five six\nseven hour weekend uh days on weekends\nevery week working with a coach to\nfigure out what is holding me back why\ndo I have this pain in my heart why do I\nfeel like there's something like choking\nme on a consistent basis why do I feel\nlike I can't catch my breath sometimes\nwhen on the outside I've got things\ngoing well for me you know it's like I'm\nable to accomplish things I can create\nmy goals and make them happen I'm\nbuilding a business you know all these\nthings I'm functional in a high level\nbut internally I didn't have Harmony wow\nI was kind of at the stage and we would\ntalk about it all the time I was like\ndude why am I struggling with this so\nmuch why am I going through this and I\nwas kind of at a stage where I was just\nlike I've got to figure out this part of\nmy life in Intimate Relationships\nbecause energetically it's holding me\nback from friendships family creating my\nwork my mission my health it's draining\nit's pulling from me and that's why I\nalways love being single because when I\nwas single I felt free but when I was in\nintimacy I felt like I was trapped so I\nhad to go down the Journey of of\nreally healing a lot of the different\nemotional wounds from childhood that\nput me in the programming of feeling\ntrapped and feeling really like I had to\nabandon myself for someone to love me\nand so I never truly loved my authentic\nself because I never felt like someone\nelse would love me for who I truly was\nand truly accepted who I was\nso that was just my personal Journey\nwhere other people might struggle in\ntrying to figure out how to get clear on\ntheir purpose or their mission or how to\nmake money or how to get in shape\nthat wasn't my problem my challenge was\nintimacy trusting myself and being a\nhundred percent authentic and courageous\nin intimacy\nand not changing who I was to please\nsomeone else but the need to please\nothers who I loved and Who Loved Me was\na big wound and it caused a lot of pain\nyeah it's I mean it's so powerful you're\nhearing you say that because I feel like\nit's not worth becoming someone you\ndon't know to please someone you think\nyou love one person yeah you just become\nsomeone you don't recognize you become\nsomeone who you don't know you don't\nunderstand just to hope that that person\nwill see that person and accept you and\naccept you yeah and it's exhausting it's\nexhausting yeah you're always performing\nyou're playing a role you're giving in\nyou're abandoning yourself it's mentally\nemotionally physically draining but what\nI love about all of that results in you\nbeing able to be creative like you start\nremoving all those blocks internally it\nresults in a book and a book as we know\nis like a lifetime's worth of work yeah\nput into pages to help people find their\ngreatness in their own lives and I\nwanted to start with I definitely want\nto dive into certain elements of the\nbook because I think what you do in this\nbook so well is you remove blocks for\npeople like I think the way you were\njust describing you having blocks in\nintimacy and relationships I think we\nknow that in my community feels this and\nI felt this in my life there were blocks\nin what I believed was true of my\npotential or blocks that I thought were\ntrue of what I could achieve within\nsuccess or blocks around how I felt\nabout judgment and failure and so I want\nto dive into all of that yeah I remember\nthe first year meeting you yeah you were\nlike I don't think I could make you know\nsix figures a year you know you're kind\nof like uh I don't even know if that's\npossible or if I'm worthy of that or\ndeserving of it or if the work I'm doing\nI'm supposed to be making that you know\nthat much money yeah and that was kind\nof a block of yours for I don't know\nwell probably a long time before then\nbut for a couple years until you really\nwere able to work your way through that\nwhat was the thing inside of you that\nallowed you to unblock the financial\nfear that you had it's exactly that\nright like I had grown up in a family\nwhere the language around money and the\npsychology around money was we have just\nenough\nand generally people who have money have\ndone something bad to get money so it's\nbeen like negative ways or like\nmanipulative ways or they must have done\nsomething Shady in order to have wealth\nyeah and so people who are good don't\nhave access to that kind of wealth\nbecause they're not shady people and so\nI think when I grew up with that I\nremember many days having zero in my\nbank account\nyou know just living off of the last\namount of money I had to pay off a bill\nor whatever it may have been and I think\nwhat it really hit me as time went on\nwas I was having all this impact like at\none point I still remember this I had\n150 million views and I was four months\naway from being broke it's crazy and and\nI was just like I can't make the stuff I\ncare about anymore because I don't have\nmoney like I got videos cost money to\nmake like this I always say to people\nlike this podcast this studio costs\nmoney to have like it costs money to\nhave teams and you know right now we\nhave producers behind the scenes and\neditors and and podcast leads and\nthere's a whole team of people that make\nthings possible and when you're\nfinancially scarce and I don't mean that\nin terms of how much money you have but\nin your mind when there's a scarcity\naround money or anything scarcity around\nlove or scarcity around energy or\nscarcity around Health yes it just\nlimits you and so for me what you just\nwent through I had to re-wire my\nrelationship with money yes and we have\na relationship with people we have\nrelationship with money we have\nrelationship with our body we have a\nrelationship with our mind exactly and\nso to me it was that I'm curious then\nwhat was the I want to tell this dude\nthis is not your interview\nI know you're an interviewer\ninto bringing it back to me I get it but\nI want to tell the story of the exact\nmoment when the block went away from me\nfrom having fear around being trapped in\nintimacy after a five-month journey of\nlike intensive therapy and what it did\nfor me I want to share that story in a\nmoment but I'm curious what was the\nmoment was there a moment where\nsomething like you're unlocked in your\nheart your body your mind your spirit\nwhere you're like oh I'm deserving of\nmoney I'm deserving of making more or\nhaving abundance or whatever it might\nhave been and being free of that feeling\nwas there a moment for you I mean I\nthink I'm still getting there as well\nthere's a part of it where you're always\nstill rewiring because when something's\nso deep rooted it kind of like never\nlike just leaves but I'd say that I got\nmore comfortable with it that's a great\nquestion when was that moment like was\nthere a breakthrough was it a\nnegotiation for a a speaking gig where\nyou're like oh I'm used to only making\nthis much but let me ask for more or\nsomething kind of unlocking inside of\nyou I actually think it was and this I\nhaven't talked about this before but I I\nthink it's you know and I'm sharing it\nbecause I'm with you and it is the\nanswer to your question I think it was\nthe first year that I could\ngive over six figures to a charity that\nI loved wow like that's what it was it\nwas that feeling of and and I knew that\nthat charity would have died if he\ndidn't have that much money interesting\nand they were doing really meaningful\nwork that I cared about and I realized\nthat\nI was like oh wait a minute and that's\nnot like oh look how great I am I saved\nthat's not the point the point was\nI could only do that and I could only be\na part of that because I'd rewired my\nmindset so if I wanted to create meaning\nand impact in the work and this is one\nway there are plenty of other ways to\ngive back through time and energy but to\nme I was like oh like I can trust myself\nthat if I have more I will give more and\nI want to trust myself that you know we\nalways hear that quote I don't know\nwhether it's from Grant or from Jordan\nBelfort but the idea of like money only\nmakes you more of who you are yes and\nexposes who of you it exposes more of\nwho you are and that idea that you're\nonly going to become more it's going to\nput a spotlight we were just talking\nabout that yesterday like the idea that\nyou don't change and I felt for me it\nwas that was me trusting myself and I\nthink when you rewire it like you trust\nyourself what you were saying earlier\nlike you get a trust of like oh yeah I\nwill do good with this yeah because\nthat's why I'm at the core that's\npowerful yeah but it sounds like it was\na reflection process it was you trying\nstuff it was you being like consistent\nand practicing and still today yeah\nexactly it never goes away yeah so what\nhad happened for me\num I was kind of just like I'm sick of\nfeeling this pain this stuckness this\nbreakdown pattern that I'd continue to\nrepeat and I was fully responsible for\nin choosing certain relationships out of\nintegrity and out of alignment of values\nand all these different things and then\nstaying\nand I I was finally like okay I need to\nfind a solution to this pain\nand so I I found a coach that does a lot\nof therapy and healing work\nand I just said I'm going to invest in\nsix months I'm going to pay in advance\nand I'm going to commit to my intention\nof finding the solution I'm gonna do the\nwork I think that's Step One is being\nlike clear of your intention that you\nwant to find a solution to whatever's\ncausing you any type of pain or\nstuckness in any area of your life\nthen I went all in on just being as real\nand authentic and vulnerable as possible\nand I remember there was a weekend after\nabout three and a half maybe four months\nwhere I went away and I was not with my\npartner at the time but I was with a\ndifferent group of friends and I felt\nfree in this weekend and I felt seen and\naccepted for who I was I felt celebrated\nfor who I was and I wasn't really\nfeeling that in the relationship and I\nremember being like man this is the type\nof life I want to experience\nconsistently where I can be myself\nauthentically around the people I care\nabout and I'm accepted but I wasn't\nfeeling accepted in this relationship\nand it's because I was willing to\nabandon myself over and over to try to\ncreate peace I was trying to buy peace\nyou can't buy peace you've got to own it\nyou've got to become it wow and the my\ncoach\nafter many many months of this in kind\nof unpacking a lot of different things\nand doing exercises with her and\nreflection and all these different\nthings there was a moment where I was\nfeeling this pain in my chest kind of on\nand off and I was telling you about this\nand other people I was like man I just\nfeel like this pain and like a clenching\nlike I can't like I don't know something\nwas holding me back\nand she'd said something\nthat finally clicked she was like Louis\nyou're not trapped you're free you can\nwalk away at any time you're not stuck\nin this relationship specifically now\nyou're not engaged you're not married\nyou got no kids but you are free you can\nchoose to walk away at any time and I\nalways was afraid of walking away\nbecause I didn't want to hurt one person\nand I didn't want that one person that I\ncared about to not love me to not like\nme to hate me to whatever that was the\nfear and I think when we can fully\nembrace it and say\nthis might happen and I may not like it\nbut if that's the price I need to pay to\ncreate peace in my life by stepping into\nthe fear by owning the fear by accepting\nthat it will happen potentially\nsomething happened in that moment I\ncan't remember if I told you the story\nbut it was like I literally felt the\nball of pain in my chest kind of unlock\nand like disintegrate throughout my\nwhole body I've never felt this\nsensation before\nand from that moment on I was really\nkind of like weirded out when I was\ntalking to the therapist I was like\nsomething just happened I was like\nsomething just happened it was kind of\nlike months of\npractice months of reflection months of\nthese exercises and working with this\ncoaching\ntaking action and trying to integrate\nthe lessons and then finally like\nunlocked in a moment it was a lifetime\nof practice but a moment that unlocked\nand I haven't felt that pain or\nfear of being trapped or being stuck or\nbeing not enough or needing to abandon\nmyself to please anyone else since then\nit doesn't mean I haven't had some like\nyou know challenges or stressful moments\nbut I haven't had that and I'm so aware\nof it because I keep practicing and\nintegrating the healing journey I think\nthat's been the key for me is the\nongoing integration of healing so that I\ncan keep expanding feeling happier\nhealthier and healed like you talk about\nfor this show and I think that's what\neveryone wants to feel happier to feel\nhealthier and feel like they're on the\nhealing Journey yeah I mean hearing you\nsay that you know as your friend I know\nhow much time and energy you put into\nworking on yourself man I know that any\nconversation we have turns into a q a\nwith both of us going back and forth\nright I know any conversation we have\nyou'll be talking about what work you're\ndoing and who you're working with and\nwho's in our teams to help us do that\nwork I'm talking about personal life\nwhat is the difference then because I\nwant to get into the greatness mindset\nbecause you are teaching people how to\nunlock the power of their mind and live\ntheir best life today which is what\nyou've been doing professionally and now\npersonally over the last few years what\nis the difference between motivation and\ndiscipline because I find that a lot of\nthe time people think like oh I'm so\nmotivated by that I'm so inspired by\nthat but what you just explained is far\nmore of a dedicated discipline to the\nself-work the inner work talk to me\nabout the difference between those two\nand and where do we find them I think\nmotivation is for people that don't have\na meaningful mission\ndiscipline is for people that are clear\non their identity of who they want to\nbecome and the mission that they have\nthat is Meaningful for them not only for\nthem but for those around them and you\nknow when I was growing up when I was\ngrowing up I wanted to be successful\nthat was kind of the goal and the\nmindset is how can I become successful\nhow can I accomplish my goals as an\nathlete how can I be a pro athlete how\ncan I make money how can I get\nyou know Awards and all these different\nthings for whatever reason\nthat's what I thought of is I wanted to\nbe successful when I when I turned 30\nand started realizing how big of an ego\nI actually had\nand how selfish I actually was in life\nthat was a fun-loving guy but my\nintentions were more for me to look good\nfor me to win for me to be successful\nfor me me\nthis is one of the reasons I love you so\nmuch because your mission is about\nservice\nI started to realize at 30 that success\nwas selfish and greatness was really\nabout service right greatness was not\nabout just me it was about having an\nintention of a dream that I might have\nbut including others in the dream where\nsuccess is more about accomplishing\ngoals and dreams for just you\nand not as much thinking about others\nmaybe others are included but the\nintentions really like how do I look\ngood how do I get this award and make\nthis money and get this credibility\nand that's why 10 years ago I said I\nhave to completely shift my identity\nand it was an unwinding of like 30 years\nof of programming so I had to shift the\nidentity from okay and I love that you\nalways talk about collaboration over\ncompetition I was all competition right\nand there's fun there's healthy\ncompetition in like sports and things\nlike that but\nin The Game of Life we've got to be\ncollaborators we've got to be thinking\nabout we instead of me if we want to go\nfar if we want to go fast that quote you\ncan you can\nwhat is the quote if you want to go fast\ngo alone if you want to go far go\ntogether yeah yeah and if you want to go\nfast you can do it on your own quickly\nbut you won't take you far and you\ntypically burn out\nmotivation I believe is for people that\nwant only success\nbut discipline is when you shift your\nidentity based on a meaningful Mission\nthat's why I start the book with\nmeaningful Mission because all the great\npeople that we've interviewed who have\nhealth happiness and are healed\nI think that's greatness they have a\nmeaningful Mission that's beyond them\nthey have something more and that is\nan identity\nthat are that has non-negotiables where\nthey are able to be disciplined because\nit's something bigger than them\nwhereas success by itself needs constant\nmotivation right I love that you just\nshifted that desire of like selfish\ngoals or like self-based goals to\nservice because\nthat for me was the\nthing that switched when I met the monk\nright so I heard that at 18 and that was\njust\nto my 18 year old mind I was like what\nwhat like wow like no one's ever said\nthat to me before and I would never have\nlearned it if it wasn't for meeting the\nMonk and you're saying you learned it at\n30 or that's when you realized that\nafter being successful to some degree\nthat you'd achieved then externally\nsuccessful internally suffering yeah wow\nand no one wants to suffer no one it's\ninteresting I was just interviewing a\nguy before this today and I said on a\nscale of one to ten of your inner peace\nand self-love scale ten being you love\nyourself you have a lot of inner peace\none being you hate yourself no love\nwhere are you he said I'm a five wow and\nI said and this is a guy with a massive\ncompany extremely fit shredded like\npeople around him but internally a five\nand it goes back to what you talked\nabout I love the intro which is hap is\nit happy healthy and healed yeah healing\nwhich is I said why do you think you're\na five\nand he said I haven't dealt with the\ninner stuff I've dealt with the mental\nside of discipline and structure and\norganization and and working hard and\ngrinding but the emotional side of\nhealing your heart I believe is the game\nyeah it doesn't matter how shredded you\nare how wealthy you are how successful\nyou are how many cars you have if your\ninner emotional state is suffering you\nare losing and when you're in your\nemotional state is at peace and focused\non service it doesn't have to be\nchanging the world but service to the\npeople in your life that's when you are\nsuccessful a lot of people that will say\nwell Luis I don't have anything to serve\nwith so shouldn't I want success first\nand then I'll find service because I\ndon't have my meaningful Mission I don't\nhave any money I don't have access I\ndon't have a platform shouldn't I aim to\nget a platform first and then serve\nthrough it how do you think about that\nand I mean you served for many years\nbefore you got your platform you know\nand then you built your platform after\nreally kind of figuring out who you were\nyour identity after leaving the the monk\nHood right you started to figure out\nwhat did you want and I think there's a\nperiod of time a season of life where we\nhave to try a lot of different things\nand figure out what do we really love\nwhat are our passions where our talents\nlion with our power and then what is the\nproblem we're looking to solve so it's\nthe three p's and you can ask yourself\nthree piece of passion the passion the\npower that you have right and the\nproblem you're looking to solve that so\nI give a lot of prompts and questions in\nthe book around the three p's where you\nkind of figure out your sweet spot of\nwhat could I be doing so the passions\nare and a lot of people say I've heard a\nlot of people say don't follow your\npassion I don't agree with that I think\nyou should be thinking about what are\nyou most curious about what excites you\nwhenever I ask people what are you most\nexcited about in your life right now you\nmostly see people like look up in the\nsky and they're like they take a deep\nbreath and they get really excited and\nthey're emotional about it they're like\njoyful about it you want to lean into\nthat feeling and do those things and be\nin that playground of experiences so I\nthink you really want to be thinking\nabout what is\nthe things that I am most passionate\nabout and maybe it doesn't mean for a\ntwo to four year window of life you're\ngoing to be able to work on it but you\ncan still be working towards it so\nfiguring out what interests you uh what\nwould you do if Money Was No Object what\nwould you just love to wake up and do in\ngeneral and what excites you think about\nthat the second thing is you know when I\nwas starting out I didn't feel like I\nhad any talents so I can relate to a lot\nof people when you left the monk Hood\nyou were like\nwell what does this transferable skills\nand you said you got rejected by like\n100 companies or something yeah\nand it's like I didn't think I had\ntransferable skills you didn't think you\nhad a lot of people probably don't think\nthat way and most people when they\nfinish University or college they don't\nuse that degree five to ten years later\nthey're moving on to different things\neventually right so even if you got a\ndegree in something you probably won't\nuse it in five to ten years fully in\nthat area\nand so I think you ought to figure out\nwhat are the how do I describe it kind\nof like invisible assets right the\ninvisible assets that you have acquired\nthroughout your entire life that maybe\nyou're not even aware of for me an\ninvisible asset was curiosity it's not\nlike I have this tangible currency that\nI can like use uh to to build an\nopportunity in my life but it was an\ninvisible currency an invisible asset I\nwas so curious about other people\nanother invisible asset I was a pretty\njoyful human being and anytime I entered\na room and everyone was always older\nthan me and more talented and more\nsuccessful I just said I'm going to\nbring so much joy and curiosity that\ndoesn't seem like a transferable skill\npeople would be like they just wanted to\nhelp me and I was this 24 year old punk\nthat was just like entering these\nnetworking events and these social media\nconferences in these rooms around all\nthese kind of thought leaders and and\nreally people I was like wow they're\nlike successful mentors of mine and\nthey're always like hey Lewis why don't\nyou come join us for dinner hey that's\npretty cool you're doing this let me\nhelp you here and I brought curiosity\nand joy I never talked about myself I\nwould just ask questions\nthat I was fascinated by and people\nloved to share these stories about\nthemselves that was a currency that was\nan invisible asset that I brought to the\ntable so you got to think about what are\nthe powers that you have that maybe you\ndon't think you have\nand also I'm a big fan of figuring out\nwhere you are most powerless and\ncreating a list of all your fears I call\nit the Fearless yeah I want to get into\nthat yes this is the place where you\nfeel the most powerless so for me at the\ntime I felt like my biggest fears and\nwhere I felt most power less was\nstanding in front of a room of peers\nI could not stand up and speak in front\nof five people without stuttering\nstumbling sweating and just forgetting\neverything that I wanted to say so I\nalways felt insecure when I had to stand\nup and present in front of people and I\nalways felt like man I'm just messing up\nand people are laughing at me and I'm\nnot good I'm not as smart as everyone\nelse I'm not as good as presenter as\neveryone else so I had this incredible\ncrippling fear and yet I knew one day I\nwanted to be able to impact people in\nsome way whether it was a career or\nsomething else\nand so I found a mentor who was a\nprofessional speaker I found a mentor\nwith a model that I wanted to mimic he\nwas a professional speaker\nand he said you gotta overcome this fear\na way to do that is go to Toastmasters a\nprofessional speaking class that you can\ngo to and he told me exactly what to do\nI want you to go every week for a whole\nyear it's gonna suck the first few\nmonths you're not going to feel good\nyou're not gonna like it it's gonna be\nembarrassing and you're not going to\nfeel good about yourself but I'm telling\nyou if you do this every week for a year\nyou will create unbelievable things in\nyour life and it was true never in my\nwildest dreams would I think I get paid\nwhat I get paid to speak publicly now\nso what was once something that made me\nfeel so powerless\nI made it a superpower\nbut the only way I could do that was\nfinding someone or some model or mentor\nto give me some guidance or that I could\nmimic\nand then taking action on the fear over\nand over again until I embraced it and\nbecame the Batman of public speaking you\nknow what I mean it's like you've got\nwhatever the fear is for your you you've\ngot to become Batman in that experience\nyeah you've got to live in the dark\nyou've got to wear a bat suit and\nembrace that fear a hundred percent\nuntil you can sit there peacefully\nfor me on a stage in front of an\naudience and that took years yes yeah\nyou want to develop more superpowers in\nyour tool belt you want to lean into\nthat and I had a ton of fears and a lot\nof insecurities so it took me many years\nto start practicing on this and\novercoming it and I still get to step in\nmore of them the work never ends so\nthat's the second thing you figure out\nwhat you're interested in your passions\nyour powers and overcoming your fears to\nmake them superpowers and the third one\nis figuring out what problem do you want\nto solve this is something you talk\nabout so much and one of the reasons why\nI love your work Jay is because you're\nalways asking people to think\ndifferently you don't have to be the one\nwho's the entrepreneur or creating the\nthing\nthere are so many great causes teams\nbusinesses and companies that have\nmissions that you can be a great team\nplayer and use your passion and your\npower to support that problem and I\nthink\nthat's what you got to be looking for\nand it may notice it may not always come\nto you you know in your 20s early 30s it\nmay evolve there are different seasons\nof life that you can use these passions\nand powers to solve problems so you\ndon't have to have it all figured out at\n25 or 31 you know just like give\nyourself a break and keep enjoying life\nalong the way yeah I love the three p's\nand I hope that everyone when you get\nthe book I want you to spend a really\nbig chunk of time figuring out those\nthree p's yeah and and I think what you\nsaid is true I've I've heard that\nrhetoric too of Don't Follow Your\nPassion it's a waste of time it's bad\nadvice and I think what people get\nconfused is your passion with doing what\nyou like all the time every day there\nare lots of things I have to do every\nday that I don't like but they help me\ndo what I'm passionate about exactly and\nI think it gets confusing when people\nare like well do your passion means\nevery day all the time you'll just be\ndoing what you love and I'm like well\nthat's not true because I've to do\nplenty of things I don't love in order\nto do what I do love and that's why\nyou've got to use discipline you know\nyou've got to use discipline to keep you\norganized and consistent on certain\nthings that maybe aren't as fun we'd all\nlove to sit around and play games all\nday yeah you know but it takes\ndiscipline to see a meaningful Mission\ncome to fruition yeah and I think that's\nthe key when you get clear a lot of\npeople that aren't clear on their\nmeaningful mission for this season of\nlife\nthey're confused they get depressed they\nhave stress they have overwhelmed they\nfeel lost they feel frustrated they feel\nlike something's off and it's because\nyou're not clear on the meaningful\nmission for this season of life and so\nthat's why it's just so important to get\nclear on what you want and how you want\nto include others in this season yeah\nand I love how you keep saying season of\nlife because it's not like you've got to\nfind your meaningful Mission the rest of\nyour entire life no and I think that is\ntoo much pressure how long is a season\nhow how long how much time do you think\nI mean there's different types of\nseasons and I look at it as Sports in\nsports in a year you're an athlete in a\nyear there's four seasons in the year of\nfall summer spring winter in sports\nthere is a preseason a season uh post\nseason and the playoffs right there's\nkind of these four seasonal moments and\nthere's always time to reflect on okay I\ndid this thing for nine months or a year\ndo I still want to keep doing this thing\nright take time to reflect you take a\nmonth off every year to reflect what\nworks it was amazing and you look\nrelaxed sometimes we're so in it all the\ntime that we don't have the moment to\nreflect on do I still am I still excited\nabout this is this still what I want to\ndo do I feel like there's a new season\ncoming for me like I am I shedding\nsomething and stepping into something\nthat I'm ready for now just like this\nbook it wasn't the right season five\nyears ago I didn't feel like I was\nhad figured out what I needed to figure\nout internally to be authentically\nsharing the message that I have now and\nI felt like I would have been a fake if\nit came out years ago I knew the\nconcepts but I didn't know it inside of\nme how did you know like that's a great\npoint right like I feel like there's a\nlot of people listening they want to\nlaunch a podcast they want to write a\nbook they want to build a new idea\ninside their company they want to take a\nnew idea to their boss they wanna they\nwanna start something fresh and new in\ntheir area they want to start a charity\nright whatever it may be and I think\nthere's always that period of not\nfeeling ready yeah and then doing it and\nI feel like that's the part where most\npeople are stuck we're like in their\nhead if you talk to them and I'll talk\nto lots of people they kind of know what\nthe logo looks like and they're kind of\nthinking about the website or they kind\nof put a bit of the presentation for\ntheir boss together and they're thinking\nabout it but what's the difference or or\nwhat is the right way to go about\nfeeling ready or getting ready even when\nyou do don't feel it right like because\nyou didn't want to wait 10 years exactly\nbut you didn't want to wait five days\nright like how did you yeah and\nobviously this is a book so it's a\nbigger thing it takes more time I think\nthere's this concept that we've all\nheard that is like uh face it until uh\nwhat is it no fake it till you make it\nright that's the concept fake it till\nyou make it it's what a lot of people\nhear and I really started to think about\nI don't really like that yeah and I\nthink it should be face it until you\nembrace it right or face it until you\nembody it and so when we take the\nconcept in the in the greatness mindset\nof okay writing it down writing down a\nlist of your fears you're Fearless\nthen you face the fear until you embody\nand overcome that fear until you embrace\nit you embody it and it doesn't have\npower over you anymore\nand really for me it's it's about having\nthe perception of like it just kind of\ndepends what you value in life so many\ntimes for me I think about how much I\ncould die at any moment you know I think\nthat my life could be over at any moment\nwill I be proud of who I am if I didn't\nlaunch this thing that's been inside of\nme for a while\nI knew on this I didn't have the fear of\nwriting a book right that wasn't a fear\nof mine where a lot of people they have\na book idea for 10 or 20 years and they\njust never launched the thing yeah that\nwasn't my fear my fear was being like\ninauthentic yes to who I was and and\nbeing I don't know is it a liar or just\nnot feeling like okay something was off\ninside of me I don't want to put\nsomething out there\nand so I knew okay I know this book is\ngoing to be my best work ever but I\ndon't feel like I'm the right messenger\nyet to put it out there so what do I\nneed to face\nuntil I can embrace the person I want to\nbe to be able to put this out there and\nthat to me was after two and a half\nyears of researching this book and\ntaking tons of notes and interviewing\nexperts and me being like me checking in\nwith me at the end of every year being\nlike why am I still talking about\nwanting to write this book but not\nhaving the courage that's when the\ntherapy and the coaching sessions and\ndiving in deep into my wounds and the\nemotional traumas I was like I need to\nface this part of me that I'm still\nafraid of that was the thing on my fear\nlist that I had resisted for decades and\nwhen I faced it and felt like wow I'm\nactually able to feel healing I'm\nactually able to feel calm around this\nsituation in my life in other areas I\nfelt calm but not this situation I've\nactually been facing it consistently\nevery week and doing the work\nemotionally revealing myself and\nexercise is in coaching and getting\nfeedback and all that stuff then when I\nfelt Freedom internally that's when I\nwas able to create and launch yeah\nthat's a great Insight I think a lot of\nus are hoping that our fear will just go\naway or like you said we just try and\nfake it and then it doesn't feel right\nor it doesn't align with us and really\nwhat you're saying is you have to face\nthe fear you have there's no other way\nalthough it's not like a different route\nor there's not a different pathway and\nyou can't and you can't out analyze the\nfear yes yes yes\nI understand the concept you've got to\nexperience it yeah internally scary\nhorrifying yeah it's horrifying yeah\nit's the you know it's something that\nheld me back for decades and it's what\ncauses us as human beings to repeat the\nsame patterns of familiarity yeah we get\nstuck in patterns that are familiar even\nwhen we know it's not right yeah this is\nwhy you hear so many people specifically\nwomen who say on my wedding day I knew\nit wasn't right like I knew something\nwas off when like three four or five\nyears later they got divorced and you\nasked them did you did I think something\nwas off they were like on my wedding day\nI had a feeling but I was afraid I was\nafraid to let people down\neveryone was already there the\ninvitations were sent we had already put\nthe down posit down I didn't want to\nruffle feathers and I thought maybe we\njust try to make it work a lot of us\nhave that fear of letting others down\nand that's the thing that holds a lot of\npeople back yeah and I love it in the\nbook because you break down the full\nFizz yes that we all experience so I\nwant to go I want to just give people a\nlist three main three minutes three\nminutes sorry three main fish sorry\nthree main fears yes yeah failure\nsuccess judgment sorry three main phase\nI want to just touch on them because I\nthink that these top three fears are\nreally well articulated and I and I've\nexperienced all of them so I want to\nreflect on them myself too so I remember\nwhen I was thinking about like you said\nso I've been doing what I do today I've\nbeen doing it now for 17 years seven\nyears online 10 years offline and the 10\nyears that it was offline there were no\nfollowers there was no courses there was\nno business aspect to it it was just\nservice and it was me learning and me\nsharing my passion with five to ten\npeople that 50 people that would show up\nand when I finally realized that I\nwanted it to reach more people and that\nwas a internal calling I had that I\ndidn't want to live in a world where\nonly five to ten people had access to\nthese ideas because these ideas changed\nmy life and I felt wait a minute I met a\nmonk that's a very specific experience\nnot everyone's going to go through\nsomething like that so how do we speed\nthat experience out for more people I\nwas scared of failure because I was\nlooking at why were you scared of\nfailure because I was looking at social\nmedia\nand I was looking at\ncontent and I was looking at things\npeople were doing and I was scared about\nwhat my friends would say yes I was\nscared about me uploading something and\nnot getting views it getting criticism\nor getting like people in the comment\nsection saying oh this is trash or\nwhatever\nand I was\nscared of failure I was scared of No\nOne's Gonna care No One's Gonna watch\nand it doesn't and it's not gonna matter\nand that probably lasted as I was\nresearching learning and thinking for\ntwo years where I felt like that before\nI actually you wanted to but you didn't\ndo it exactly I wanted to in my head and\noften at those times I find that's when\nyou start becoming critical too so\nyou're kind of looking at what everyone\nelse is doing and you're finding holes\nin it because you think you could do it\nbetter or you you know you get kind of\nlike that and you realize that's not how\nyou want to live either and so I find\noften when we're the most inactive or\nstagnant that's when we're the most\ncritical judgmental of others who are\ndoing something and trying their best no\nauthors are writing negative reviews on\nother authors books it's just that\npeople have never written a book who's\nlike this was the worst book ever right\nyeah and it's it's hard and so I\nremember feeling that way like where you\nknow I was starting to notice I remember\neven years ago when when my friends were\nreally into music and we'd be like\nlaughing at the rapper on screen or like\nwhoever it may be and be like oh look he\nthinks he's got Rhymes and we could do\nbetter and it's like but that guy's\nactually going\nthat person's doing it and so\nyeah talk to me about let's talk about\nthat first because I think the fear of\nfailure and I love the way you put it\ninto failure and we'll talk about\nsuccess and judgment fear of failure is\nthe number one thing that blocks us from\ntrying and that's the part right it's\nnot about stops us from succeeding it\nstops us from trying I was trying to\nfigure out what is the thing that holds\nus back what are these fears and it was\nand it became clear to me that it was\nfailure success and judgment\nand I started I didn't understand\nfailure and success personally but I\nstarted to ask people and kind of bring\nbrainstorm it and workshop with people\nbecause for me as an athlete growing up\nI was conditioned that failure is a part\nof success yeah yeah that makes sense so\nif I I wanted success\nand the pathway there is failure like\nevery day in practice you fail you make\na mistake you give the wrong pass you\nturn the ball over you drop the ball you\nmiss the shot so I would watch Michael\nJordan fail a hundred times a game but\nstill win the game you know or whatever\nit is you know it's like you miss a ton\nof shots\nand it was never like the worst thing it\nwas like I don't want to fail in my\nsport I want to be perfect in every play\nbut I know that this is the path towards\nsuccess and it's how I get feedback to\nget better so failure was feedback it\nwas information telling me what I needed\nto do to improve so I understand that\nconcept success I also did not\nunderstand why people were afraid of\nsuccess but as I started touring and\nspeaking and asking people who here is\nafraid of failure most of the room would\nwould raise their hand at some point in\ntheir life they're afraid of failure and\nI'd say how many of you are afraid of\nsuccess thinking everyone wants this\nso\nalmost half the room would also raise\ntheir hand for success and I go but this\nis the thing people want so if you want\nsomething you're afraid of why would it\ncome to you why would success come to\nyou if you're afraid of it why would\nmoney come to you if you're afraid of it\nwhy would love come to you if you're\nafraid of it\nso I never understood that concept but\nas I started to talk to people and\nrealized oh actually I get it because\nthe weight of gold can be so heavy for\nso many people there's actually a\ndocumentary called weight of gold that\nis about Olympic gold medalists who go\non to commit suicide afterwards who go\non to have extreme depression mental\nhealth challenges lose friendships go\nbankrupt all this stuff because the\npressure once you succeed to stay there\neveryone expecting you to be a certain\nway everyone expecting you to be perfect\nall the time the perfect role model\neveryone expecting you now to have money\nto just give to your friends and family\nand not knowing who really cares about\nyou for you versus your success so and\nalso\nit's just a weight that takes a lot of\ncourage to be able to lean into and\nmanage and I think it's a skill set to\nunderstand and manage success but that's\nsomething I always wanted so I was like\nbring it on you know I'll take it the\nfear for me that has been my kryptonite\nover the years was judgment\nand the need for other people to like me\nand specifically to matters of the heart\nand intimacy and that's why I kept\nrepeating the pattern because I wasn't\nafraid to enter a relationship you know\nI wasn't afraid of that I wasn't afraid\nof it doing well I wanted it to do well\nbut I kept abandoning myself to try to\nplease one person to accept and love me\nI was a terrified of the judgment\nand that crippled me it was a big you\nknow Kryptonite in my my entire\nexistence until a couple of years ago\nand that's the thing we've got to\nidentify which one of these fears holds\nus back the most and again in the book I\ntalked about kind of the process of\nuncovering and unpacking that so that\nyou can have Clarity and awareness you\ntalk about awareness is the key once you\nare aware and clear then you can create\na game plan on how to embrace it\novercome it and make that fear and\ninsecurity a superpower yeah and I and I\ntruly think we're just gonna be have\nsomething off inside of us we're going\nto be unfulfilled we're going to be\nfrustrated you know disconnected until\nwe figure out what the fear is for us\nand figuring out how to fully accept\nourselves at the center of all three of\nthese fears is I'm not enough I am not\nlovable enough I'm not smart enough I'm\nnot good enough I'm not talented enough\nI'm not enough\nand when we can finally get to a place\nwhere I say I am enough I can go back to\nall the different periods of my life\nthat I'm not proud of that I'm ashamed\nof that I'm insecure about that that I\nhurt people that other people hurt me\nthat I haven't forgiven if I can go back\nand reconnect with those broken elements\nof my my mindset from the past and\ncomplete create healing and wholeness\nthen I can accept and love myself today\nfor where I'm at and that's when\neverything changes yeah and and I can\nstill relate to all of those as you're\ntalking about them like I remember after\nI had my first viral video I didn't want\nto make any videos really why because\nbecause you're scared of success like\nyou're scared of but weren't you excited\nyou're like oh 50 million views you get\nwell that's the point right like it at\none point it has to become about more\nthan the Successful Failure and that's\nwhere the meaningful Mission it comes\nback to that right it always comes back\nto that and I was talking about this\nwith our friend and we talked about\nYouTube it's so funny I was talking to\nStephen Butler recently because I was in\nLondon and we talked about you too\nbecause we're talking about\nrelationships and\nhe was saying what he'd learned from you\nand the conversations you guys have had\nand and now I'm talking about him to you\nbut he I was I was talking to him about\nthe idea of just like getting\ncomfortable with the idea that at one\npoint we all have to embrace\ninsignificance and irrelevance\nin a public sense but that in an\ninternal sense the meaningful mission\nwas what was carrying you yes so if you\nstop because people stop following or if\nyou start only when people are following\nthen there isn't a meaningful Mission\nbecause the meaningful mission is what\nyou were doing whether people were\nfollowing or not because it's what you\nwanted to do and who you wanted to be\nand so I think it comes back to that\nthat if you only play when you're\nwinning and you stop when you're losing\nor you don't pivot and learn a new way\nto serve then there isn't a meaningful\nMission at the Bedrock of it and so I\nlove that the meaningful mission is at\nthe heart of everything\nbecause there will always be changes\nlike your the platforms will change the\nalgorithms will change people will come\nand go people will come and go and you\nsee the people that have lasted the test\nof time it's usually people who have a\nmeaningful Mission as you're saying you\nwant to keep serving keep giving they\nfeel they have that yeah and they're not\nthey're not worried about\nhow famous or relevant they are correct\nyou know what I think I I loved your\nconversation with uh Kevin Hart about\nhow like Fame is like this ultimate drug\nand if it's not used wisely or managed\nproperly it will ruin you yeah and I\nthink you know the idea of being\nrelevant or having followers or views or\nsomething like that\nif it's not managed properly it'll\nprobably stress you out and overwhelm\nyou yeah and make you go a little crazy\nunless there's some Foundation of hey\nyes I want to impact more people and yes\nI want this to do well but the mission\nis to serve\nand I remember when I wrote my last book\nspecifically about uh you know masculine\nvulnerability I remember thinking to\nmyself\nthis may not do that well no one's going\nto be yeah you know it's not at that\ntime in 2018 or 2017 Whenever there was\nI was like I don't know if men are ready\nto start talking about being vulnerable\nit was kind of just like barely\nhappening right and 90 days now everyone\nis talking about that not everyone but\nyou see that a lot yeah\nbut I remember being like I could I\nreally don't care if this sells a\nmillion copies or one if it sells one\nand that man is impacted and he has a\ndeeper relationship with himself where\nhe heals he has a deeper relationship\nwith his wife or his partner and his\nfamily he heals and mends some\nrelationships and he fries and he finds\nmore happiness health and he heals then\nI was like it's worth it it's worth the\ntwo years of research it's worth all the\npain that I went through it's worth the\nthe fear of opening up about sexual\nabuse that I was afraid of years before\nthat because I want another guy to feel\nthe same way yeah and so I think when we\ngo into it with yes we want things to do\nwell when we put effort and energy into\nlaunching a project a business\naccompanying a book a podcast of course\nyou want things to go well but if you\nhave the meaningful Mission as the\nBedrock where you're just like it's\nabout we it's about us it's about\nservice it's not about me getting more\nfamous or building doing something more\nfollowers that's when I think it's more\nsustainable energetically yeah yeah when\nwhen people are sitting with that and we\nkind of skip not skipped over but we we\nused it and moved forward like\nI think when I use the word purpose or\nwhen when you're using the word\nmeaningful Mission it's like it can feel\nquite heavy for certain people because\nthey're like I don't care about like\nthere's nothing that I even care about\nthat much like I don't know or I want to\nI wish I cared about Humanity or animals\nor whatever it may be that you care\nabout you got to know your season when I\nwas broke on my sister's couch I\ncouldn't think Beyond getting off the\ncouch\nso I was like my meaningful mission is\nto make enough money to live on my own\nyeah I remember that I remember that\nyeah paying rent and paying groceries\nlike right was that's where I started if\nthat's your season of life you got to\nfocus on that and you got to focus on\ngetting to a baseline where you can\nstart thinking Beyond yourself but\nyou're doing that with the hidden\nfeelings like I want to do service 100\nright now I just need to focus on this\nthat's it's kind of like I love that you\nsaid that because that's what I found\ntoo it's like I never stopped wanting to\ndo service there were just moments in\ntrying to do service with the immediate\nneed was it's kind of like saying you\nhave an apartment\nthere's a fire in the apartment but\nyou're trying to do your interior design\nright like or you want to have your\nfriends over right right you're like no\nbut my apartment's have my friends over\nit's like no no no yeah\nlike I want to serve with my house and\none of my friends over and it's like no\nno just solve the fire yeah and then and\nthen use it for that right yeah I think\nit's uh\nit's it's understanding where you're at\nand that's why I said like listen when I\nyou've gotta have a season of overcoming\nyour fears as well like for a few years\nI was just like I'm so crippled by\ninsecurity and fear yeah that all my\nenergy is going towards public speaking\nclass I'm doing salsa lessons because\nthis was a fear of mine and I wanted oh\nyou're such a good dancer yeah but I was\nlike there's so much and I was like and\nI was in research mode I know you love\nto read and research and teach I was in\njust research mode for hours every day I\nwas researching I was learning online I\nwas building relationships and I was\novercoming fears that was the season\nwhile I was on my sister's couch for a\nyear and a half trying to figure out who\nam I in this world what is the point of\nall this what is my identity now that\nI've lost my dream and my athletic\ndreams what am I going to do the rest of\nmy life I was in a season of researching\nof building relationships and overcoming\nfears\nand but I still I was being in service\nto the people I was working with I was\nbringing curiosity I was bringing Joy I\nwas bringing moments of fun and that's\njust as much Service as it is feeding\nthe homeless or changing the world or\ncuring cancer that's a great answer yeah\nit's the it's a greatness is not about\nchanging the world it's about changing\nthe world around you and changing the\nworld within you and being in that\nevolution of growth and transformation\nand saying how can I continue to level\nup myself and the people around me that\nmight be three people yeah but if you're\ndoing that it's making a ripple on so\nmany more you know when you live then\nthat's what I love about you there's a\ncouple of things that I want to point\nout no and I want to ask you how you've\ndone these things sometimes uh I was\ntalking to I remember I went to lunch\nwith Matthew Hussey who's a dear friend\nof ours and you know you've been friends\nwith him a lot longer but you always\ntold me I'd get along with him and we do\nuh and I went for lunch with him and you\nguys had just all been on red table talk\nfor an episode\nand it was you and Stefan Franklin and\nDevon Franklin and Matthew and\nMatthew was saying that the whole time\nbecause there were so many of you it was\nlike eight of us around the table on the\ntable and there are lots of questions\nand\nit was like everyone obviously had so\nmuch value to add everyone on that table\nhas as beautiful insights but you were\nkind of like doing layups for everyone\nelse so it's like everyone was sharing\ntheir insights but you were the guy who\nwas like passing it to everyone on that\nthing and you have loads of great\ninsights too but you were happy to play\nand I just want to say that that's and\nthat you know that's you practice what\nyou preach and that you do that even\nwhen you have an opportunity to shine\nyou're happy to pass the ball like you\nare happy to pass the ball and go no you\nslam dunk you take the three-pointer you\ntake that and people notice that right\nlike the right people who are aware they\nnotice that and they recognize that oh\nthis person actually is meaning what\nthey're saying yeah and that was just a\nprivate lunch I was having with a mutual\nfriend of ours it wasn't like a show or\nanything and I wanted to share that but\nbut the other part of what I see in you\nyou're so good and you talk about this\nin the book about enlisting support\nyou're so good at finding a coach going\nto a class getting a teacher doing a\ncourse I give give that advice all the\ntime and I think we give that advice all\nthe time we're like just start doing a\ncourse like do this right and because\nit's real because we've experienced in\nour own lives like by the way I only I'm\nonly a public speaker because my parents\nforced me to go to public speaking\nclasses so I've been to seven years of\nnine hours a week with exams of public\nspeaking training from age 11 to age 18.\nthat's great so it's courses right you\nsay anything in the world is trained is\nlearned is built and I think we live in\na world now where we think oh that\nthat's a god-given talent or that you\nknow it or you don't have it when you\nactually start to realize that oh the\nperson you think that can dance yeah\nthey might have had some cool skills I\ncould not tell you you could not dance\nat all but now like when I see you when\nI've seen video and stuff I'm like\nyou're a great dancer right and I think\npeople could say the same for speaking\nbusiness you've talked about it yeah\neverything yeah like so many things so\nlet's talk a bit about that because I do\nthink that Education and Training are\nthe pathway to transformation and growth\nreading a book is that crossing the line\nlike I was saying to someone yesterday\nthat I have this habit where I look at\nwhat my block is every season almost\nusing your language and I will go and\nfind books interviews and podcasts on\nthat problem yes and so I was in so many\nbookstores over Christmas because I love\nbookshops and I was just walking around\nand I would walk around just as like I\nwas given this example yesterday I was\nlike if you're out of milk at home you\ngo to buy milk right you don't just go\noh I'll just use washing up Liquid\ninstead right but if you're out of\ndiscipline what we do yeah go buy some\ndiscipline like what we do is we go all\nright I'll just watch Netflix then right\nand it doesn't solve the Gap like if\nyou're out of cereal at home you don't\njust go oh I'll just eat like chips for\nbreakfast all right you go and buy\ncereal and so I look at my life in that\nway like a grocery store and I go what\nis it that I need in my life okay maybe\nright now I need to become a better\nleader okay maybe right now I need to\nbecome a better husband right now I need\nto become a better interviewer whatever\nit may be and then I'll go and look for\nthat and it sounds like you do the same\nhow have you found the ability to a\ncouple of things the first thing is find\ngood classes and coaches and mentors\nbecause I think a lot of people struggle\nwith knowing like do I trust this do I\nnot good question for people to ask and\nsecond part is how do you commit and\nstay on top of it when naturally like\nit's easier to just sit at home and\nwatch TV two things yeah how do I commit\nand stay on top of it I pay in advance\nyeah\nright that's a great way yeah yeah you\nhave to pay my nutrition and fitness\ncoach in advance yeah I pay my my\ntherapist and emotional coach a year in\nadvance and we schedule it every two\nweeks for the year yeah so I've got\nmoney invested I've got time and\ncalendar organized committed yeah so\nit's not like I'll pay you every week\nwhen I come we'll see when the meeting\ngets set up it's not one class at a time\nit's a a block of time in advance It\nTakes Time Force discipline yeah Force\ndiscipline and when you're invested in\nit\num you pay more attention to it as our\nfriend Dean graciosi says he says uh you\npay attention to what you pay for right\nand you'll pay more attention when you\npay more money typically I'm not saying\nyou need to spend tons of money a lot of\nthings that I've gotten from free\nmentorship whether it be people just\ngiving me time me learning from podcasts\nbooks videos courses things like that\nthat were free and available online but\nI've always seen accelerated results\nresults when I invest in something when\nI invest in someone something and I know\nI've got to do a period of time to\ncomplete it\nthat's number one number two and how do\nI find them I how do you know who to\ntrust and how do you how do I know to\ntrust I I typically ask people that I\nrespect so I'll ask you hey hey do you\nknow someone who can help me on this so\nI trust and respect you if you have a\nreferral then then I'll probably trust\nthat person or at least I'll jump on a\ncall but otherwise it's you know you can\nfind a lot of people online and see what\nthey're creating how their energy is\ntheir Vibe and things like that you can\nconsume some of their information you\ncan see testimonials you can check in\nwith those testimonials or referrals so\nI just kind of Follow that process and\nI'll always do like an intro session\nwith someone if it's a coaching to see\nlike do we really connect before I\ncommit a year in advance or three months\nin advance so it's making sure that\nthey've got results that I respect and\nthey've worked with people and helped\nthem overcome challenges that I respect\nas well then it becomes more more of a\nthing that I that I trust diving into\nand to to go back to what you're saying\njust before that about kind of giving\npeople layups and stuff I wasn't like\nthat until 10 years ago I mean in some\nways I was but I wasn't it wasn't until\n10 years ago when I had this kind of\ninitial transformation of letting go of\nbig parts of my ego\nwhere I said that I have to be extreme\nin a sense the other way because I was\nso competitive I wanted to be right I\nwanted to win I wanted to be number one\nat everything I can't imagine you like\nthat I can imagine like I know you're\ncompetitive in sport and obviously as an\nenergy that's yeah I didn't know you\nthen maybe people didn't feel it but\ninternally that was driving me right in\na lot of ways and it was all based on a\nwound that I hadn't healed yet\nonce I started to heal I was like oh wow\nI've had this all wrong everything was\nwin lose to me as opposed to win-win so\n10 years ago I actually learned the\nconcept of win-win for the first time or\nat least I understood it for the first\ntime maybe I'd heard it as a kid but I\ndidn't embody it until I was able to\nface that and wake up to it\nand that's why I was like okay I'm gonna\nstart this show it's not going to be\nabout me it's going to shine the light\non everyone else I want to practice this\nI want to overcome this consistently\nand I was really inspired by Oprah where\nshe just always shined the light on\nothers right for 20 something years\nand she's talked about it before it's\nlike when you shine the light there's\nalways a reflection of light back on you\nand the more you do that for more people\nover time you become brighter in return\nand that's not the goal to become\nbrighter necessarily for selfish reasons\nbut it's true it naturally happens\nyou're reflected the light back on you\nand I think that's a beautiful thing you\nknow something that you do so well by\nlifting others up is something that I\ntry to do really well by lifting my\nfriends up like we did on red table talk\nwhen you know Jada is asking a question\nI'm like gosh I know Stefan has the\nperfect answer for this because I've\nheard him say this three times yeah so I\ngo Stefan you know what to say here you\nknow when Matthew had a different\nperspective on something else it's like\nMatthew man you said this amazing thing\nabout this before can you share what\nthis is Devon I've heard you say this so\nyou know I learned this early on because\nI didn't feel like I had the answers or\nI was smart in my early 20s so I\nwouldn't speak a lot from my perspective\nI would just ask curious questions\nand after a couple hours of meeting with\nsomeone I never really spoke about me I\nwould just ask about them at the end of\nthe conversation they were like man\nyou're the most interesting person I've\never met I was like I didn't share\nanything about my life I just asked you\nquestions yeah but people want to feel\nthat you're curious and interested in\nthem and then they'll think you're\nextremely interesting yeah yeah that's\nyeah I and I feel like it's also just\nsomething that you know you also\nnaturally listen and I think that\nyou know I think a lot of these things\nare often used as techniques yes and\nthey don't come across as genuine\nbecause you if you ask a question you\nactually have to listen and then you\nactually have to remember and then you'd\nask a follow-up question and I think\nsometimes you could you can tell when\nit's disingenuous or you know what it's\noff you can feed it from my life or\nsomething yeah when you feel like it's a\ntechnique where someone's coming at it\nlike you know whenever you know people\nused to give the advice of like I'll\nreach out and do something for free for\nsomeone yeah and then someone would do\nthat for you but then they come back\nwith like this and then you're like oh\nwait a minute I thought you were doing\nthis for free for free and you start\nrealizing just like it has to be done so\ngenuinely and people will respond to\nthat I had a you know I had a rule that\nand I and I still have it too like uh I\nnever took pictures with\ncelebrities unless they were on the show\nwere in a meaningful connection there\nwas never a clout grab like it wasn't\nlike I'm in this place I've seen this\nperson let's get a picture just to like\nshow off hanging around with like it was\nlike no if I have a relationship with\nthat person or they're on a podcast and\nthere's a meaningful interaction or\nwe're doing something together because\nit's just like when when people feel\nused and you're using people in that way\nand there's no genuineness it kind of\njust like it feels really cheap and and\nit comes across that way too and it\nactually blocks you having a real\nrelationship right and so when you're\nasking interesting questions and I know\nyou do that all the time but I also know\nyou're listening because then we'll\nbring it up again in another\nconversation or and so I think there's\nthere's a real truth to that I also my\nown personal coaching practice I I set a\nnew rule and this was something that\ntook me a while to understand but it but\nit really helped me so anyone that I\nprivately coach uh we have a fee of my\ntime but the entire fee goes to charity\nof their choice that's cool so I have a\nwe count up the hours like I would in\nany coaching practice but the the amount\ngoes to a charity of their choice that's\ncool and it became a way of that I could\nfeel I was serving and I could give\nmyself and I wanted the person to also\nfeel like they were getting the feeling\nof giving back rather than always paying\nfor stuff that's cool because I found\nthat a lot of people always felt that\nthey could pay for anything and they\ncould buy anything and I wanted them to\nfeel the opposite yeah that's cool where\nit's like they weren't buying anything\nthey were getting to give away that's\namazing and yeah so I've never talked\nabout it before but I wanted to share\nwith you because it was just something\nthat I was thinking about like I I\nwanted to find a method where I could\ngive my heart to someone\nand they could give their heart to me\nand I found sometimes that money got in\nthe way of the heart interesting and so\nlike in Friendship there's no money\nexchange hence there's a heart space and\nso in coaching I had to find a way yeah\nand that was that was my way and it's\nlike been a beautiful commitment and\nit's great of us it gets like\noverwhelming with coaching clients and\nyou have no time yeah of course and I\ndon't right like I'm very I don't have I\nhave like six seven people that I work\nwith so yeah it's it's not something\nthat I'm looking to grow in a business\nsense where are you looking to grow in\nyour life right now after a month of\nreflection of this end of year season of\nlast year of being your honestly your\nbiggest year ever in in so many ways\nfrom the business to success to speaking\nto the podcast growth to YouTube to\nvideo celebrity clients all the talk\nshows you've been on all these things\nthat have happened what was the big\nreflection for you and where do you see\nyourself moving in this next year so\nobviously this year the new book is out\na rules of love so my heart's in love\nthe tour is happening right I'm really\nexcited to like hug people and hold\ntheir hands and look into their eyes I\nthink I'm like I've always been a hugger\nwe just hugged for like and by the way\neveryone watching right now are\nlistening when you hug Jay in person\njust whisper in his ear and hug him long\nand say this was from Lewis\nbecause that's what I do\nwhat I did whispered is here I'm like I\nlove you\nbut but there's a there's a joy in that\nlike I love physical connection like I\nlove the idea that I'm actually gonna\nlike you know I I feel so grateful that\nfor six seven years I've been doing this\nI haven't met 99 of people you probably\nfeel the same way and I just like I feel\nso grateful and I want to kind of like\noutpour all of that on stage that\neveryone is going to be there because\nthere's so much gratitude built up in me\nthat I haven't been able to me saying it\nin a microphone doesn't do it justice\nand traveling around and doing a hectic\nschedule and doing all this craziness is\nreally an output it's totally from a\ngratitude point of view because there's\nthere's nothing else to it of why you'd\ngo on tour so I'm excited for that and\nthen if I'm completely honest I'm\nexcited for rest study and creativity\nI'm really looking forward into the next\nhalf of the Year where my plan is to go\nmore internal and learn and study again\nand research and read more I do that all\nthe time but I mean do it even in a more\nobsessive constructive way and and spend\nmore time just being creative and being\npresent because I feel like I've been\nreally going\nall out for like the last six seven\nyears now and it's been so meaningful\nand powerful and beautiful but at the\nsame time I'm conscious that to have the\nnext seven years be even better than\nit's been it's going to require this pit\nstop and my monk teacher would always\nsay if you want to go three steps\nforward you have to go three steps deep\nand so this is the time to go three\nsteps deep in order to go three steps\nforward again and so I feel after going\nall this forward that I've done it's\ntime to go deep again and and I feel\nthat internally it's recording me so\nwell you're about to spend the next what\nthree to six months going hard hard and\nforward and that's great and I'm ready\nfor that yeah and I'm ready for that\nafter this month off but after that I'm\nalready planning I'm curious I know this\ninterview is about me but but I can\nnever not ask you questions no matter\nwhen we're doing this stuff I'm curious\nif you could fast forward in your heart\nin your minds one year and just imagine\neverything that has happened you're\npouring your energy and everyone the\nGratitude you're gonna give to all this\ncommunity you know tens of thousands of\npeople that are going to be in person\nover the next few months supporting you\nseeing you uh and make sure you guys if\nyou haven't bought the book get his book\nright now as well what do you think is\ngoing to be the lesson you're going to\nlearn at the end of this year if you\ncould be in the future what do you think\nyour soul is going to tell you that it's\ngonna be the lesson and the thing for\nyou to step into or let go of into the\nnext year\nI think the lesson will be to and and\neveryone needs to do this and it comes\nback to your point of season\nis to live in the season that you have\nreached and what I mean by that is that\nthere was a different energy that it\ntook to get here and it will be a\ndifferent energy to move forward and I\nthink it's really interesting because I\nthink we often stay in the same energy\nState multiple years of our life because\nwe got used to it or we got familiar\nwith it and then years go by before you\nrealize you needed an energy shift and I\nthink when you see people who are burnt\nout lost or confused or feel like they\nwasted time it's because they never\nrealized that they stayed in the same\nenergy State uh that they were in when\nthey started and you have to accept that\ntime has changed and life has moved on\nand you've learned new things and you've\ngained new Clarity and so I think that\nwill be the lesson and letting go I\nthink will be I want to do I feel like\nto get to this point I had to do a lot\nof what\nI didn't love and I think that that\nshould always get less and less and less\nso I think a healthy life isn't one\nwhere you only do what you love but it's\na life where you do less and less of\nwhat you don't love and so I feel like\nmy life's always moving in that\ndirection and I think in a year from now\nI have all the clarity and all the\nopportunity\nto start afresh as opposed to continuing\nto just exist in the world of repeating\nwhat's been done yeah if that makes\nsense it's good Insight your future self\nis wise yeah yeah hopefully hopefully I\nnow got to live up to it well this is a\nbeautiful question it's could you make\nme make me vocalize and I hope\neveryone's getting to see how good Lewis\nis or what he does and what he does for\nhimself too no the question like that's\ngreat because it gives me something to\nlive up to that I that I Aspire for\nright and it reminds me of that Matthew\nMcConaughey speech yeah 10 years\nof my hero 10 years away yeah and it's\njust like it's the Oscar speech if\nanyone doesn't know Dallas Buyers Club\nhe won the Oscar for best actor and he\ngives one of the best features of all\ntime in my opinion and yeah it's that\nidea of just\nyeah it gives you something to chase\nwhich is yours it's you it's not chasing\nlike and I love that right like and I\nthink the question you just asked is the\nquestion you're asking yourself which is\nwhy your life is going in the right\ndirection because the question isn't\nwhere do you want to be in a year like\nwhat do you want to achieve because that\nstarts to like set you know there's\nthere's usefulness in that I'm not\nsaying it's not useful but the internal\nquestions far more gratifying so yeah\nyou're giving me something to Chase and\npursue it's awesome to have goals and\ndreams but I think what's more important\nis focusing on the person you become on\na consistent basis\nto create those dreams and also\nbeing so proud\nand at peace of who you've become even\nif the dreams don't come true\nand there's been a lot of things that\nI've chased after\nwhere the dreams didn't come true yeah\nbut the life was a dream come true\nwho I got to meet what I got to\nexperience what I overcame the lessons I\nlearned the the memories I created\ncertain dreams didn't come true but it\nwas a dream come true totally totally\nand oh I love that I love that so much\nthat's such a like that's such a\npowerful statement and and it's so true\nlike I I've so I have so many projects\nthat haven't worked out it didn't work\nout so many pitches even we went to some\npictures together that you set up for me\nthat didn't work out but the network I\nbuilt through that relationship building\nthe connection you became who I became\nthe skills I had to learn like there's\nso many you know there was there was a\nlot of things I'll give an example there\nwas a lot of goals that I accomplished\nas an athlete that I was extremely proud\nof and I was like man I set an intention\nfor this goal 10 years prior and I made\nit happen\nbut there are certain goals like I\nwanted to be an Olympic Athlete right\nand for eight and a half years I played\nwith the USA national team and I never\nmade the Olympics right and I haven't\nplayed with the team for about three\nyears since uh right before the pandemic\nand I could look back and say I spent\neight and a half years of my life\nsacrificing committing dedicated\ndisciplined traveling the world spending\ntime money energy money and energy\nplaying a game to represent the USA to\ntry to make the Olympics and I failed\nand I failed it and I fell short or I\ncan look at it as man\nwhat a life journey and experience I got\nto have for eight and a half years I\nhave so many great friends memories I\ntraveled the world wearing USA across my\nchest getting to play against Olympians\nas a you know 35 67 year old I was like\nI didn't accomplish the dream but it was\nstill a dream come true and I think when\nwe look back on things that didn't work\nout\nbut Find the meaning and the memory and\nthe magic in those experiences it's\nstill an incredibly beautiful life the\nmeaning the memory and the magic I love\nthat I love that because often we look\nfor meaning but you're so right the\nmemory and the magic\nLewis Hauser and Lewis that was that was\nspecial man that was really beautiful
