lot\nbetter so I hope you feel inspired to\ninterview your friends as well Mariana\nwelcome to on purpose thank you for\nhaving me no it's so great to have you\nI've been looking forward to this and I\nloved the interview we did for your\npodcast two years ago now yeah it was\none of my favorite episodes and people\nloved it so much and so I'm so happy\nyou're coming back again yes yes I'm\nexcited to come back again and you know\nyou've just been on this incredible\njourney with your Brands your work the\ncommunity you spend time with you're\nsuch a respected Voice such a well-known\nface in the industry which I think's\nreally hard to do when when you've done\nit from building a brand when you've\ndone it from building social media it's\nhard to maintain that but I want to go\nbackwards today because as we were\nresearching we also found that you don't\nalways share too much about yourself and\nthat's obviously what on purpose is\nbuilt upon and I wanted to ask you like\nand I ask this often what's your\nearliest strong memory as a child like\ncan you remember if you could go back\nwhat's one of your strongest earliest\nmemories and why is it so important to\nyou and I'll tell you mine as I as I let\nyou think on yours if I think about my\nearliest earliest memory\nI can probably remember holding my\nsister when she was born so I was around\nfour and a half going on five and I\nremember her being in my arms and like\nit was amazing to have that opportunity\nto actually hold this baby and I\nremember my parents had been like\npreparing me for this moment where they\nwere like you've got to pray for a new\nnew little friend to be in your life and\nso like for weeks on end and months I\nwas praying so I was prepped and then\nwhen my mom was going to hospital and\neverything I remember my dad like\nstaying at home with me and doing\npuzzles and like keeping me occupied and\nlike getting me ready and then finally\nwhen I held my sisters like such a\nmoment and the reason why and I think\nabout how that moment impacted me and I\nfeel my parents did a great job at me\nbeing excited and at the same time I\nfeel that's been a big part of why I\nfeel so close to my sister and I often\ncall my sister kid because I see her as\nmy little child and so there was a\nparental aspect I feel like I became\nquite fatherly early on so anyway that's\nmy earliest memory of four and a half\nyears old I want to know yours um we\nhave a mutual friend Audrey and she was\nasking me the other day like how far\nback do you remember and I'm like I\nremember my first day of kindergarten\nshe's like you do and I was like yeah I\ncan remember waiting in line I can\nremember my backpack I remember going\ninto school and it really was memories\nfrom six on one or I remember a lot at\nthe time my parents got divorced I was\nsick so this is very early 90s before a\nlot of families were getting divorced\nand I had grown up in Germany that's\nwhere I was born and after my parents\ndivorced my mom went back to Germany and\nthis is very modern of my parents at the\ntime but I ended up living with my dad\nfull-time so my dad was a full-time\nsingle parent they were\ncross-continental co-parenting which is\nlike it just seems very crazy like\nthinking back then but I think it's a\nlot to my Independence now because I\nstarted flying by myself to Germany to\nsee my mom when I was six so my dad used\nto take me to the airport this is before\nTSA pre-check this is this is how long\nago it was where your people could like\nwalk you to the gate so my dad would\nwalk me there and then someone would\ntake me on the plane I would fly to\nGermany I would meet my mom there on the\nother end and I'm an only child and a\nyoungest child so I have two older\nhalf-sisters but I was my parents only\nkid so from a really young age I had\nthis independence of okay I could fly to\nGermany by myself like I can do\neverything by myself and I think my\nparents always treated me as an adult at\na really young age and they instilled\nIndependence in me and they always\ntreated me like I was an adult so my\nparents are much older now my dad is 85\nmy mom is 72 and so I think they were at\na phase in their life where they were a\nlittle bit more grown up they had\nfigured things out themselves and they\nsaid this is the way I want a parent I'm\nnot going to smother you I'm going to\nlet you be your own person and figure\nthings out and I think that Independence\nhas really gotten me to where I am today\nand so when people are like how do you\ntravel all the time for work I'm like\nI've been traveling since I was a baby\nso it's something I'm so used to I love\nthat I was I did not know that and I\nthink it's really interesting I don't\nlive in my past that much and I you\ndon't strike me as someone who lives in\nyour past a lot but I do love going\nbackwards to kind of connect the dots\nwith those experiences and what you just\nsaid is a perfect example of how you\ntook that have you found sometimes that\nyou speak to people but we all react to\nthings differently like for someone else\nthat going back and forth would have\nmade travel really scary three and they\nwould have been like God my parents got\ndivorced like it was the worst and I had\nto go back and forth whereas your story\nis I'm independent and I travel do you\nthink you had to reflect or did you do\nany work to get there or was that just\nnatural for you where it was like I just\nfelt like it was a good thing because\nI'm always intrigued as to life\nhappening to US versus US choosing what\nlife does to us yeah I think there's two\nscenarios here so I have a friend who\nhas really bad flight anxiety like she\ncannot get on a plane without taking\nsomething first and we talked about it\nrecently and she's like I think because\nmy parents were divorced and I I thought\nevery time I got on a plane it was I was\nleaving one parent and going to another\none and so she has a really bad time\nflying now 30 years later because of\nthose experiences again my parents being\nmodern at the time which is more common\nnow my parents actually got me a\ntherapist when they were going through\ndivorce and this is 30 years ago so you\nhave to think I was six years old and my\nparents said okay we're gonna separate\nwe're going to give you someone to talk\nto and so at the time I could actually\nprocess my emotions not not really\nremembering like what was happening but\nthey were so cautious about how to\nhandle the situation that I think it\nmade me feel like oh it's not a bad\nthing that they're separated they're\ndoing these things because they love me\nand they want to be happy people\nindependently and so the way they\nhandled it then reflected on who I am as\nan adult today so I think as I think\nabout one day becoming a parent all\nthose things from someone being six\nreally does reflect on who they are as\nan adult that's incredible yes your\nparents are super mature this is like\nParagould yeah but you have to think\nthen people weren't getting divorced\npeople were not going to therapy parents\nweren't co-parenting there's not even\nreally cell phones at this time so they\nwere trying to co-parent in different\ncontinents without Wi-Fi without cell\nphones and the fact that they were able\nto do it it's like if you live in the\nsame city with someone else it's\ndefinitely possible if they could do it\nbetween countries wow wow and do you\nfeel that because of the way they\nhandled it you've continued to have a\ngood relationship with both of them yeah\nbecause of how they how did they what\nwere some of the others because I think\nthere are so many people today who have\nparents who got divorced or a lot of\npeople who actually have parents who\nnever got divorced but they feel that\ncould have benefited them and then of\ncourse their parents who stayed together\nand people are grateful for that but\nfrom your experience what else I'm just\nso intrigued by how incredible your\nparents are like what else do you think\nthey got right that despite being in\nseparate countries you felt like you had\na healthy relationship with both of them\nthey always made sure like no matter\nwhat this was the schedule I spent my\nSummers with my mom in Europe I would go\nsee her during holidays she would come\nback to see me and so my mom was always\nplanning work trips about coming back to\nwhere I was and so she would make sure\nshe was present at school even though\nshe didn't live in the same state as me\nshe would come to different things and\nso that time is really important and I\nremember more the days that she was\nthere than she wasn't there and so now\nI'm so close to both of them and they're\nreally like friends to me now at this\npoint it's not really like a parental\nrelationship if anything I probably\nparent them a little bit too much but\nthey're just so incredible and I think\nhindsight is that they're older and I\nhave the gift of age from them and I\nthink because they were fully mature\nadults by the time they got married and\nhad kids they realized how to be a\nparent more I think a lot of times when\nyou're still trying to figure yourself\nout in your 20s and 30s it might be a\nlittle bit too early but I think my mom\nwaited till she was 36 to have me my dad\nwas 49 and I think they were in a place\nwhere they were fully ready to become\nparents and I think that really\nreflected on the way they raised me\nversus feeling like I have to do this\nbecause of my age which I think a lot of\nwomen feel that way now like oh I'm 30.\nI have to do this thing now but they\ndon't feel ready because Society keeps\ntelling us we have to have kids by a\ncertain age but I think they waited and\nthat waiting made them better parents to\nme yeah well so not only were your\nparents open to the therapy yeah yeah\ngetting divorced moving country your dad\nbeing the primary caretaker and then\nyour parents were actually having kids\nlate which was so not normal then yes so\nit sounds like they were Breaking All\nthe Rules they were doing all the things\nthat I want to do now in life but a long\ntime ago before it was like normalized\nyeah tell me one of the ways that you\nfeel you parent your parents now that\nthey're older and of course you know\nwhat's been one of the most beautiful\nways that you've got to oh return that I\ndo everything I do so much for them now\nbut it's like such a blessing to be able\nto do that for them and so my parents\nare so grateful for anything if I buy\nthem a flight or book something for them\nbut now it's like travel I want to make\nsure that they're like very comfortable\nso it's just making sure that they have\neverything that they need so I have a\nhalf sister who's older she lives in\nConnecticut so my dad wanted to see them\nfor Thanksgiving so it's just he's like\noh thank you so much for this flight\nlike he has so much gratitude for a\nflight that I could book for him and\nit's like if I can work hard to make\nsure that you can go see your great\ngrandkids it makes me so happy or my mom\nto be able to go on a trip and do the\nthings that she wants to do so now\nthey're probably annoyed with me because\nI'm like don't do this don't do this\ndon't go here remember this like wear\nyour face mask like I'm telling them all\nof these things but\num I try to do it a little bit less but\nthey're like my dad even texted me that\nI think okay thanks Mom like so they're\ncute I love that that's so adorable and\nso beautiful I think for all of us who\nwho can support our parents in any way\nit is such a blessing one of the things\nthat you brought up there that that\nreally stuck with me was this idea that\nyou want to live your life in the way\nyour parents were living their life back\nthen do you feel like you didn't grow up\nwith a lot of limitations in your\nmindset or boundaries because I think\nwhat you were saying is that uh a lot of\nfor example you gave the example that a\nlot of women feel like Oh by the time\nI'm 30 I should have had kids by now\nwell by the time on this and I think\ntime and Society place a lot of these\nboundaries and barriers did you feel\nmore free from them because of how you\nwere parented or did at any point in\nyour life did these become a part of\nyour yeah education as well there's a\ncouple things so one my dad grew up\nreally poor he was born at the end of\nthe Great Depression and grew up my\ngrandpa was a preacher they had no money\nlike very very poor my dad only could go\nto college because he joined the Air\nForce and was able to go on a GI Bill my\nmom immigrated to the U.S during the\nVietnam war and came to the America with\nliterally nothing so between the two of\ntheir stories I thought if they come\nfrom nothing they come from war they\ncome from the Great Depression and they\ncould make this life for themselves I\ncan do anything possible because they've\ngiven me this great life that I could\nhave that anything is possible here so\nif I don't live my life to the fullest\nit's almost a disservice to the\nsacrifices that they made for me to be\nhere here my mom is also Vietnamese so I\ngrew up with a very much a tiger mom who\nwas like you have to do these things go\nto school you need to graduate you need\nto get a job but she also taught to me\nIndependence and what she told me was\nnever rely on anyone else for anything\nyou need to be able to fully support\nyourself so if you're in a relationship\nor a situation you can walk away and not\nfeel like you have to rely on another\nperson for something or be in a scenario\nyou don't want to be in because you need\nthis person for this thing and maybe I\ntook it a little far and it went overly\nindependent in my life and so\num growing up I told my parents I want\nto be a television host and then my mom\nwas like okay you need a realistic job\nlike being on TV is not realistic so I\nsaid okay my backup job is going to be\nPR so I went to school for journalism my\nbackup was PR I interned in PR in\ncollege it was my first job out of\ncollege I was taking celebrities to\ninterviews and I was like I still want\nto be the one interviewing them like\nthis is I don't want to be behind the\ncamera I want to be in front of the\ncamera and so I started working as a TV\nhost and then Instagram and YouTube who\ncame around in 2012 and I had a reel and\nto send my real places I needed to\nupload it somewhere so I uploaded it to\nYouTube and I had to send the link to\nplaces to go on interviews and so I\nwould send them this link that was my\nfirst YouTube video and then I had a\nchannel so I was like I may as well\nstart uploading makeup tutorials because\nI have this place this is very early\nYouTube Days 10 years ago and after two\nyears I was able to do it full time and\nI told my parents I'm going to quit to\ndo the internet and they were like quit\nto do the internet like what is this and\nso even though they support me now I\ndon't think they gave me they let me\nknow that all things were possible\nbecause of that their own stories but I\ndidn't know at the time that I could\nmake it a career for myself and they\nwere definitely a little bit skeptical\nnow they're like the most supportive\npeople but at the beginning you know\nit's like internet full-time like what\nis this parents always want us to be\nsafe like parents always want their kids\nto be safe\nbut it's almost like the safest thing\nparents can do is let kids take their\nown risks I feel the same with my\nparents like my mom moved to England\nwhen she was 16 and they built their\nlife her brothers were like 18 and 19\nand they built a life whereas when I was\nmoving to New York at 28 it was like no\nno no like are you okay my baby I'm like\nMom I'm 28 years old like you were 16\nbut they forget that they forget the\npain and the sacrifice and the risk they\ntook on and they want to shelter you\naway from it when you made that decision\nwere you so convinced that this is right\nfor me I know it's the thing or was it\nhard because I feel like when you did\nthat step it wasn't a thing to be a\nYouTuber yet it wasn't a career path\nthat someone could say I want to be a\nCreator mom and dad look at what XYZ are\ndoing there weren't any role models at\nthat time\nand so when you did that it was even a\nbigger risk than it is today but I find\nso many people who listen to this show\ntoday struggle to break out of what\ntheir parents think of them so when your\nparents you it sounds like you have such\na close relationship with your parents\nthey love you you love them was there a\npart of you that felt you were letting\nthem down by doing this or did you just\nyeah never letting them down I was never\nworried about letting them down I think\nI just had to prove them so like my my\ndad is very much like okay go do\nwhatever you want like this is great\nlike he grew up in a time there's not\neven phones so like to have a job on the\ninternet seems so insane to him but my\nmom is very much like show me what you\ncan do and then I'll support you and so\nI had to show her these opportunities\nand I think when I went on my first\nbrand trip and I could bring her on the\ntrip she was like oh you could travel\nfor work you could go places I went to\nThailand and I took her with me and she\ncouldn't believe that you could have\nthis job on the internet and create this\nfor yourself and so I was never worried\nabout disappointing them because I\nalways believed in myself like if I want\nto do something I know that it's\npossible and now we're in a really great\nplace where you can see people's careers\nthat you want to emulate or you look up\nto but at that time there was no one to\nwe were figuring it all out at the same\ntime and luckily it was very early days\nof like influencers having like managers\nand teams and I happened to get an\nagency and I think that helped\nlegitimize it to my family and then they\nsaw over time like okay you can actually\nlike make money doing this and here we\nare a decade later I love that that's\namazing congrats congrats on having the\nstrength at a time I I think that's\nundeplayed like how hard it is when\nsomething is brand new to kind of bet on\nit because you you didn't have the you\ndidn't have the benefit of hindsight of\nhow successful this thing was going to\nbe or how big it was going to be no idea\nat the beginning people were paypaling\nme fifty dollars suppose some things I\nwas like that's how early it was and I\nwas like you would pay me fifty dollars\nto post something let's go so excited\nyeah that's incredible and when you\nstarted doing makeup tutorials and\neverything was that somehow and what I\nlove about that story is you set out to\nbe a like a TV anchor right like that\nthat's what you want it to be then you\ngo into PR realize that being behind\ncamera doesn't work then you do makeup\ntutorials was doing makeup tutorials\nfulfilling somewhat of a passion of\nbeing in front of camera like that\nobviously wasn't being a news anchor but\nthere was something about it that was\nfeeling right yeah I always had a\npassion for sharing things that I loved\nwith an audience and so at the time I\nthought being a TV host was the only way\nto do this because I had to be on a show\nto talk about things that I love to\nshare it with people when YouTube came\naround and I'm like you can upload\nvideos and talk about whatever you want\nand people can watch it it was always\nthe things I felt I wanted to do in my\nheart when I grew up but when I grew up\nthere was no platform to do that and\nthen at the time when I was auditioning\nI was going to a lot of shows to be a\nhost and every time I would get towards\nthe end and they would be like we're\ngoing to give this job to the celebrity\nlike this celebrity host is going to do\nthis job I'm like well how am I ever\nsupposed to be known if I don't get the\nopportunity with the internet we're in\nsuch an amazing place where we can take\nour careers into our own hands there's\nno one to tell us no you can create the\ncontent and if the audience is there and\npeople want it they will show up they\nwill watch they will download they will\nfollow they will listen and so it was\neverything I wanted in this new platform\nand it finally gave me a place where I\nwasn't getting told no in an audition\nthat someone didn't have to say yes to\nme and I could I could prove and show\nthat I had this audience online and so I\nlove it so much and it was everything I\nwanted to do when I grew up I just\ndidn't know that's what it was and I\nalways had a love for beauty and my dad\nused to take me to Beauty count owners\nso growing up with my dad he didn't know\nhow to do my hair on my makeup so he\nwould take me to department stores and\nhe would take me to an Estee Lauder\ncounter and say okay here's my daughter\nlike can you show her how to use hair\nand makeup can you show her what\nproducts to buy because he had no idea\nwhat a great day\nand so that really was my love of Beauty\nfrom a really young age and so I started\nlearning about Beauty from the experts\nthese people at counters who were\ntelling me about products and that was\nin middle school and high school and\nthen I took that love into creating\ntutorials for myself and then starting\nyour own brand that's such a great story\nand and I'm so glad we're doing this\nlike background Journey because I feel\nlike I think about this all the time\nI went to public speaking school from 11\nto 17 public speaking drama school age\n11 to 8 7 age 18 sorry for seven years\nand I think about it all the time that\nbefore I'd even launched my Online\nCareer I probably had around like 20\nyears of public speaking experience\nbefore I ever did this professionally or\ngot paid to do it and I think that when\nI hear your story of like as a little\ngirl like going to a beauty counter\nlearning about not just how to put on\nmakeup but which brands were doing well\nand why and then skin tone and color and\nthen maybe looking for gaps in the\nmarket like you get such a real\nGrassroots experience that no one else\ncan get just by looking at what we have\ntoday I feel like I feel like Grassroots\nlearning there's nothing better than\nthat do you feel like there were things\nthen that you were like one day like\nyeah I think at the time I remember\nlearning how to Contour in high school\nbefore it became trendy like years later\nand I remember I was at a Mac counter\nand they were like this is what like\ndrag queens use on stage this is whether\nyou use in stage makeup this is called\ncontouring you use this brush you use\nthis powder you put it right here so\nwhen you're on stage your face really\nstands out and I can remember this\nperson telling me at a Mac store how to\ndo this step and it's something I still\ndo in my makeup every day today and here\nwe are like 15 years later from when\nthey taught me this and so I loved\nlearning from them and so it was so\ngreat but you don't know it at the time\nand I think in life every job and every\nexperience whether you end up doing that\njob long term or not you really do learn\nsomething from each of those things that\npile on to the next job like in high\nschool I used to work at restaurants I\nused to be a hostess at restaurants and\nbeing a Hostess maybe you don't think\nit's connected to the job I have now but\nI had to stand in front of a restaurant\nI had to talk to strangers I stood on my\nfeet for a long time I had to have\nconversations with people who were angry\nwaiting for their tables or wanted\nsomething really quickly or making\nconversation with them walking them to\ntheir tables and now I have no problem\nnetworking or meeting new people or\ngoing up to people when I see them at\nevents or places because I had these\nskills that I learned at a really young\nage of how to talk to anyone in these\nscenarios if you feel like you're not\nliving your passion right now or you're\nnot living your purpose or you know we\ntalk about these words a lot I really\nwant you to go back and look at every\njob you've ever done and reflect on what\nyou learned there because I promise you\nthat skill is going to be so useful for\nyour passion and your purpose when it\ncomes along I was saying to someone my\nfirst ever job was I I delivered\nnewspapers but then my second job was I\nworked at Morrisons which is our version\nof like Walmart or like a grocery store\nbut a big one and I remember just\nstacking shelves and everyone's like\nwell what did you learn then I'm like I\nlearned how to memorize what was in\nevery aisle if anyone asked me where\nanything was I knew exactly which islet\nwas in uh I learned how to turn up to\nwork on time and leave on time and I\nlearned that over time you got paid more\nlike you'd learn so many basic things\nand what you just said you learn how to\nwork with different people I was 15\nyears old and I learned how to have a\nboss and how to have a good relationship\nwith my boss and all of these techniques\nand skills that you would never learn in\na textbook you never learn at school\nwhen you were going through this journey\nyou take this decision to make YouTube\nvideos to make content did you ever get\nwrapped up in like views how beautiful\nam I makeup because I feel like that can\nget so toxic for people and I think now\nwhat we're seeing so much of his creator\nburnout so there's one side that I want\nto talk to you about which is like likes\nviews comments engagement like how do\nyou deal with the pressure of that like\nyou upload something and it doesn't get\nviews and the other side is when you\nactually get good at it and now you're\nlike knocking out videos you're getting\nviews everything's going well but we\nmeet so many creators today who just say\nI'm tired of putting stuff out like I'm\nburnt out of having to upload every day\nto three different platforms I never\nworry too much about views and I know\nthat that's a really hard thing to say\nin a world where our job is valued on\nfollowers views likes clicks and that\nreally is how we're valued but at the\ntime on YouTube I started my very first\nvideos with products I used today in my\nskincare routine and that's 10 years ago\nbecause I genuinely love these products\nI was shopping at Sephora I love\nPrestige Beauty I was a little bit older\nin the YouTube age a lot of the people\nwere in either high school or they were\nvery young and what they were sharing\nwas not genuinely the products that I\nloved and so I could have fell into this\ntrap of I care about virality I care\nabout what's trending and I'm going to\nuse these products but it wasn't genuine\nto who I was so I had a slower growth\nand I said I love these Brands and these\nproducts I'm going to create videos\naround this content and I'm not going to\nbe the fastest growing and that's okay\nbecause it's true to who I am and so if\nI thought about the longevity of my\ncareer it was more important to me to\ncreate content that I genuinely liked\nand products that I genuinely loved\nversus chasing views because virality\nmaybe people will click on it and watch\nit because they care about this trending\nproduct or this theme but they're not\ngetting to know you and it was more\nimportant for me to people to like me\nfor what I genuinely wanted to talk\nabout because I can't really create\ncontent if I don't love it and I just\nwon't do it it's just not something that\nI like and I think that was a problem I\nhad when Tick Tock first started was I\ndidn't want to create content just for\nlike the sake of virality and so on\nYouTube I grew a little bit slower but I\nstarted working with luxury Beauty\nBrands and at the very beginning they\nweren't really spending money with\npeople but they saw like there's only a\nhandful of girls on YouTube who are\ncreating content around Armani Beauty\nand Laura Mercier and these kind of\nBrands and then I ended up getting to\nwork with them because there wasn't a\nlot of people sharing it and so I\nstarted working with Sephora at that\ntime and creating videos for their brand\nPages because they wanted an organic\ntype of video that wasn't a sponsored\nbrand video and so\nit was a slower growth for me but I\nthink it's helped me be where I am today\nbecause what you don't want to do is\ncreate content that's just for the sake\nof being viral and then well what\nhappens then I have a friend who she\nused to be an editor and she left and\nshe's creating content full-time now and\nthere's this trend of people kind of\ntaking like editorial beauty news\ncontent and regurgitating it into tick\ntocks but then you're just retelling a\nnews story and there's nothing personal\nabout it with you and sure people are\ngonna watch it and might get millions of\nviews but you're not really building\nyour personal audience and so now that\nwe've created more things for ourselves\nI'm so happy that I always kind of stay\ntrue to the kind of content I wanted to\ncreate because if not then you're always\ngoing to be in this hamster wheel of\ncreating things for the views and you're\nnever going to really feel satisfied by\nthat\nit is frustrating when something doesn't\nperform well and you want it to do well\nand like it is our job and like you know\nBrands work with us because they want a\ncertain reach or number and so that\nstuff is important and that will come if\nyou create the content that your\nfollowers really want to see from you\num and then I think you know there's\nbeen phases of burnout for me because\nbeing a Creator there's no job security\nthere's no hours there's no health\nbenefits we have no teams a lot of times\nand so it is the scarcity mentality of\nevery time a job comes in you want to\nsay yes to it because you don't know\nwhen the next thing is coming and so you\nwant to do all the things that you can\num but I think in time I learned I have\nto take a step back and not say yes to\neverything because it's better for\nmyself long term and the things will\ncome and it's but I know it's difficult\nespecially if you're just starting out\nbecause you are really based and judged\non a number yeah I think that's so\nrefreshing to hear that from you like I\nhope that there's so many people\nlistening to this right now that are\ngoing Mariana thank you so much for\nsaying that because I think everyone\nfeels that pressure but you just explain\nsomething really beautifully that you\ncan have a lot of views\nbut people are not necessarily watching\nit for you or understanding who you are\nand therefore every video you post can\nget lots of views but it's not like\npeople are really interested in your\nViewpoint or your perspective or your\nthoughts and I think we get those two\nthings mixed up we think that virality\nand followers means influence and\nactually it doesn't make mean influence\nat all because if people only see you as\nentertainment they're not going to\nsuddenly listen to your perspective on\nsomething you should buy or something\nyou should use or your expert opinion\nand so that's what I'm hearing from you\nand I hope that gives people a lot of\nconfidence because I think it's very\neasy to chase the views I know\nthere's someone I'm thinking about right\nnow who makes amazing content and it\ndoesn't get a lot of views but it's\nbuilt him a really good business and\nhe's trying to get more views and\nvirality I'm like no like this is\nbuilding real value because your\ncontent's so awesome you're actually\nattracting real companies who want to\nwork with you privately because of the\nvalue that they see and that's what your\njourney says too when it gets to burnout\nand everything you just mentioned about\nno benefits no work hours like that's so\nreal I think burnout comes from doing\ntoo much of what you don't feel is true\nto your core it doesn't come from doing\ntoo much of what is very aligned with\nyou would you agree with that or uh yes\nand no because I think there is a\nbalance of having time off and so yes we\nwant to do all of these things and we\nwant to work really hard and create this\nlife for ourselves but I cannot do those\nthings I need to do if I don't also take\ntime to rest and one weekend I used to\nalways like work through the weekends\nI'm like oh it doesn't really bother me\nif I answer emails on the weekend it's\nnot a big deal but then one weekend I\nactually took that weekend off and\ndidn't answer my emails and Monday I\nfelt so much better and more refreshed\nand so now it's really important for me\nto take those breaks so\num I did go through periods of burnout\nof over creating and going to too many\nthings and in college I had a stomach\nulcer because I took on too much and I\nphysically was burnt out in my body\nbecause I was doing too much and so I\nknow that I need those periods of rest\nbut I know it's hard when you're\nfreelance I know it's hard when you're a\nCreator and there's so many jobs who are\nfreelance who don't have you know\ncertain hours set for themselves so it\nis important for them to you know want\nto make an income especially if you're\nsolely supporting yourself or a family\nand so I know those things are difficult\nyeah you've talked about energy drainage\nand the energy givers before walk us\nthrough that because I think everyone\nfeels that whether it's people places\nprojects we all feel that certain people\ndrain us and projects give us Energy\nwalk us through your version of that\nyeah my energy drainer are saying yes to\ntoo many things so saying no to me is\nwhat gives me energy and I know that\nsaying no might seem difficult at first\nespecially when you have opportunities\nthat come to you and you want to say yes\nto everything but saying yes to things I\nabsolutely want to do has been so\nhelpful I am in a place now where I can\nsay no because I feel like I worked hard\nin my 20s to get to where I am today\nthat I have the ability to say no to\nthings but those no's also are important\nbecause it's gotten me to the jobs I\nwant to do the brands I want to work\nwith I think if you say yes to too many\nthings you might dilute yourself doing\ntoo many things so saying yes to the\nthings that are in alignment with the\ncontent you want to create the brands\nyou want to work with the long-term\ngoals you have for yourself personally\nand professionally other energy drainers\nthat I have are not doing my morning\nroutine in my evening routine so really\nsetting myself up for the day sets me up\nfor success I get up in the morning I\nusually meditate a gratitude Journal I\ndo like a little stretch I drink my\nwater and even like just a few things in\nthe morning set me up because if I wake\nup and I just instantly start doing\nthings there's no time for me just like\nin myself to turn off\num and then I'm kind of just thinking\nall day long\num other energy drainers\num sometimes it's work and people\num and I know that that one's a really\ndifficult one to have boundaries around\nbecause you maybe cannot control who you\nhave to be around with work or people\nthat you have to spend your time with so\nit's creating boundaries around those\npeople and things to make you feel your\nbest so maybe it's at work you don't sit\nnext to that person or you you know\nfocus on working on yourself when you're\nat work so you don't have to be near\nthem too much because I know that we\ncan't always like eliminate energy\ndrainers in our life and if it's someone\nin our life personally it's difficult\nbut as I've gotten older I realize okay\nthis person and this friend is draining\nmy energy when I'm around them I don't\nfeel great I don't feel better after I\nleft them I almost feel more drained\njust being around them and so I can love\nyou from a distance I still love you I\nstill like you but I don't have to spend\na lot of time with you and that's okay I\ncan support you from afar but I know\nthat if I'm around you I don't feel my\nmy best and I want more of those energy\ngivers in my life like who do I hang out\nwith and I feel better after I leave\nthem like who makes me feel happier and\nwhole motivated energized and I always\nlove being around you because whenever I\nsee you you make us feel so great you're\nsuch a great friend our friend Audrey is\nanother one of them Audrey yeah the\nperson that came to my mind is Audrey I\nwas like Audrey she's amazing we love\nyou we love you Audrey and she really is\none of those people where you want to be\naround people who are good like that you\nwant people who make you feel your best\nand so as I've gotten older it's less\nabout quantity of friends it's quality\nof friends and I choose to spend time\nwith the people in my life who give me\nenergy and make me feel my best because\nif you notice that after you leave a\nfriend and maybe you're a little bit\ntired or drained or you're just like\nwhoa and you left them like it's okay to\nstart like phasing out people and love\nthem from afar yeah I couldn't agree\nmore with that I saw this tweet that\nsaid my circle is shrunk in size but\nincreased in value and and I think that\nthat's the mindset that you're sharing\nthen I think that's something people\nstruggle with I think we feel guilty\nbecause we feel like we're leaving\nfriends behind or we feel bad because we\nfeel people are going to think we're\nbetter than them like when you move on\nfrom a group you're often worried about\nthe perception that those group of\npeople are going to think oh Jay or\nMariana think that they're better and\nit's like well you're not leaving\nbecause you think you're better you're\nleaving because you want to be better\nand you want to grow I how do how have\nyou kind of outgrown groups or do you\nfeel you've generally had a group that's\ngrown with you but or have you had to\nlet go of yeah friendships relationships\nand things I have a core like five\npeople who have been with me for like\nover a decade that's impressive these\nare constants in my life like Audrey we\nmet in 2006 so that's like 16 years ago\nso we've been friends for a very long\ntime so it's like I have this core group\nof people who are very accorded who I am\nthey know me in my personal life this is\nwho I want to spend my time with like\nit's not about content or online or\nanything it's just like who do I want to\nsit on my couch with like scroll on my\nphone or watch TV or just hang out with\nand those people are really important to\nme I have a lot of acquaintances and\npeople that we know just from work and\nbeing around people and I just know like\nI don't have to be overly close with a\nlot of people and that's okay and I\nthink a lesson that I learned now in my\n30s was that a smaller circle is fine in\nmy 20s I think you moved to Los Angeles\nyou want to make all these friends you\nwant to be around all these people and\nthen I'm like wait I don't feel great\nwhen I'm around them I don't feel like\nmyself I feel like I'm trying to have to\nbe someone I'm not or prove to them that\nI'm something and I don't want to do\nthose things like I want to be truly who\nI am authentically and as I got into my\n30s I realized it's okay that my circle\nis smaller like it's okay to have these\npeople who I know love me and are there\nfor me no matter what and then everyone\nelse is a bonus yeah absolutely and I\nlove that you did that like I think if\nwe started seeing our relationships as\ndegrees of connection as opposed to like\nfriends and not friends yeah it becomes\na lot easier to know how much time and\nhow much energy to give someone when you\ndecide to make that transition from\ncreating content for amazing Brands\nprestige\nfriends and you're making the switch to\nbeing like I'm going to be a Founder I'm\ngoing to create summer Fridays\nwhen you're making that transition walk\nus through some of the things you\nthought about because today I find that\neveryone feels the pressure now just as\nwe felt the pressure when we were\ngrowing up to work at a big company or a\nwell-known organization today the\npressure is everyone should be an\nentrepreneur and found their own company\nI feel like that's kind of like the the\nenergy and everyone thinks like they\nhave to launch something or whatever\nwhen you're going from selling other\npeople's things to saying I'm actually\nbecoming a Founder what are the\nquestions you think people should be\nasking what are the insights they should\nbe considering because I think it's very\neasy for everyone today to think oh I've\ngot a few followers I should launch\nsomething or because I'm connected I\nshould do this and I don't think that\nthat always works out obviously it's\nworked out for you so I'm wondering what\nwere the things you had to think about I\nthink if I had to go back and tell\nmyself when we started the brand what do\nI wish that I knew and I wish that\nsomebody would have asked me which it's\nall the things that I love now but like\ndo you really want to run a company like\nthe days that we launch a product let's\nsay we launch fry products a year that's\nfive of 365. so the other 360 days you\nreally want to work on a business do you\nreally want to work on a company do you\nwant to be a manager of people do you\nwant to run the finances and operations\nlike it's all of those not fun things\nthat you do every day and so I would\njust ask yourself before starting a\nbusiness like do I really want a\nbusiness because I love running a\ncompany or do I just want to say I'm I\nhave my own company and that's fine if\nyou don't love some of the other stuff\nand so Lauren who's my co-founder of\nSummer Fridays we have no ego in saying\nthere's things we either don't want to\ndo or we don't know how to do and once\nwe grew a little bit after our first\ncouple years we were able to hire for\nthe things that we didn't know how to do\nbecause we really wanted to bring the\nbest people in to run the business who\nwe felt like could get us to the next\nlevel\num I think it's difficult when you're\nstarting a business because running a\ncompany is actually just so difficult\nthe day in day out of like production of\nthe company of the items like selling\nthe things getting them online those\nthings are not the sexy fun parts of the\njob and you have to really want to do\nthat because at the very beginning you\nhave very small teams it's basically\nyourself maybe a couple other people and\nyou're not making a lot of money for the\nfirst few years um I think there may be\na misconception of like oh you start a\nbrand and then all of a sudden you're\nrich and you have all this money and\nthat's definitely not the case it takes\na long time because whatever you\ninvested into the business and you sell\nstuff you're just recouping your money\nfor what you've already invested and\nthen as you grow you make a little bit\nof money you put it back into the\nbusiness you hire a person and then you\nhire someone else and so the first few\nyears of Summer Fridays we didn't pay\nourselves because we thought it was more\nimportant to invest back into the\ncompany so if you're thinking about\nstarting a business ask yourself do I\nactually want to run a company and if\nyou do great if you don't then maybe say\nlike what am I good at like what am I\npassionate about what do I love so much\nwhy do I maybe want to start a company\nis it because you love the creative\nthere's so many creative jobs you could\nbe a creative director you could work at\nan ad agency you could consult for\nBrands if you love creating product\nmaybe you help someone with product\ndevelopment there's so many skills that\nwe learn as creators find what you love\nbest and then offer that as a service to\nother brands so something I love is like\nbranding and marketing and I think in\nlife this is just one of the first\nthings that I will do of many and I hope\nin the future I can consult for Brands\nand work for them on branding and\nmarketing because that's something I'm\npassionate about so I would love to\ncontinue to do that over a portfolio of\nthem and I know like the actual starting\nof the business is difficult so I don't\nknow how many more times I could do that\npart of it now that we're here I'm so\ngrateful but I just wish I would have\nknown going into it how hard the actual\nstarting of the business and running of\nthe business day-to-day is yeah I think\nit's just a great way to look at it\nbecause often you you end up starting\nsomething you put a lot into and then\nyou realize it's not what you wanted\nlike you didn't want your 90 of your\nlife to be operations strategy\nmanagement HR and people don't realize\nthat often when we see entrepreneurs\nliving their greatest life we look at it\nand we go oh they just do what they love\nold day and and it's not true right we\nme included I there are so many things I\nhave to do and there are so many things\nI want to do and I've accepted that\nthat's how my life is split up and\nthere's also knowing what to start like\nwhen I look at my career there are\nthings like this podcast that we started\nmy genius community that we started but\nthen there were amazing Partnerships\nlike me being chief purpose officer at\ncom which was just a brilliant Synergy\nbecause I was friends with the founders\nfor four years they were already solving\na problem that I deeply believed in and\nI would rather join forces than go and\nbuild something yeah to compete with my\nfriends well it's already an existing\nincredible platform so it's like if I\ncan plug into what you already have\ncreated and I can make it even better by\ncoming on board we can make this really\ngreat instead of me having something\nthat I'm trying to build and takes time\nand so I think you can think about like\nwhat are you uniquely good at what\nskills can I offer someone else and go\nwork with a company go consult for\npeople and then see from there maybe I\ndo want to start my own thing or I can\ndo this with other people and so if\nthere's a brand you love maybe reach out\nto them like let me create a direct to\nshoot for you like let me help you with\nsocial and you never know what person\nwill say yes because as creators I think\nwe wear so many hats and we can be good\nat so many things and you can take what\nyou love as a Creator and then do that\non a larger scale with more budget\nworking for Brands and people that you\nlove exactly did you ever raise or did\nyou choose not to we raise money um so\nwe ended up raising to walk us through\nthe choice of that and then that process\nso summer Fridays was self-funded and\nthen we ended up raising money in 2019.\nso we had a really great first year but\nwe were running everything ourselves we\nhad the two of us an employee a couple\nconsultants and we were on the sales\ncalls we were running our retail\naccounts but we really didn't know best\nhow to do these things and it was almost\na disservice to ourselves by trying to\nfigure it out ourselves like we got us\nto a really great point but we saw we\nhave a bestseller it's working really\nwell what can we do to take our brand to\nthe next level and not lose the momentum\nthat we had so when we first launched\nthe brand people started reaching out to\nus and raising money is a bit like\ndating so you want to date and meet\neveryone and we met any and everyone and\nthen you kind of see like who do you\nlike who do you enjoy spending time with\nlike do I really want to talk to these\npeople every day and a business is like\na marriage and there's a contract like\nsometimes in marriages there are and so\nyou're getting into a marriage with now\nanother person into your business so you\nhave to ask yourselves like are these\npeople trustworthy do we have the same\nend goal do I really trust that they\nwant what's best for my brand and that\nif I really want something they're gonna\nlisten to like what I want and not\nbecause they're an investor and they're\ngoing to take control of something and\nso we ended up going with a group and\nthey have a minority investment which is\nvery small so it means like we still own\nthe majority of the business so we have\nthe majority of the sand things but it\nwas two females who founded it and\nthey're incredible and they almost serve\nlike an intermediate president for us\nand helped us with hiring our org chart\nwhat things to do next and it really was\nthe right fit for us and they weren't\nthe biggest place that we went out to\nthey didn't have the largest portfolio\nwith the biggest investment they were\nmaking into the brand but it was 2\npeople we trusted and a lot of our\nfriends are like you're the only people\nwe know that like your investors and we\nreally do and they're incredible so they\nhave a great portfolio Brands I'm\nincluding like Westman Atelier Sol de\nJaneiro in food they have on flyby Jing\nand bonds of pasta so they focus in like\ngood for you Brands and food and beauty\nand so we are so grateful to have them\nso then after that after we raise a\nlittle bit of money we were able to hire\nmore people and our first big hire was a\nCEO and I know a lot of people when they\nstart a business like they have a dream\nof becoming a CEO and running a brand\nand that was never what Lauren and I\nwanted for ourselves and we have no ego\nin saying like I don't want to be the\nCEO like I don't want to run the entire\nbusiness because one I've never done\nthis before and that's fine if you\nhaven't and you want to figure it out\nalong the way but we knew like what\nwe're good at as product development\nmarketing branding anything that's\nconsumer facing and bringing on someone\nwho could really run the business day to\nday so that I can create content I can\nbe on podcasts like I can do the other\nthings with my time was important to us\nand someone whose values really aligned\nwith the things that we wanted so our\ncompany culture is really important to\nus and as we interview for the CEO role\nit was someone who led with kindness who\npeople were excited to work for and so\nwe ended up bringing on a CEO in 2020\nright before the pandemic and so\ngrateful for our CEO and so between them\nit's been really incredible to get the\nbrand where it is today and I don't\nthink it's possible without them and so\nI think if you are if you have a\nbusiness and you're thinking about\neither Partners or raising money you\nreally want to make sure that you want\nthese people to be in your marriage with\nyou and that your baby which is your\nbusiness you guys all have the same\ngoals aligned for where you want it to\ngo because then all the decisions are\neasier because you're all on the same\npage versus a group wanting one thing\nand another group wanting something else\nit just sounds like you really know\nwhat's important to you and you're\nwilling to do what's important to you\nand what you're good at and what you\nvalue and then there's all this other\nstuff that you realize where we have to\nfind someone for that we have to figure\nthis out this needs to be shifted how do\nyou decipher between what's important to\nyou and what you think is important\nbecause I think a lot of people again\nwhen they start something they put the\npressure of I have to be CEO because\nit's my baby and if I'm not CEO then\nsomeone else will think I'm just this\nI'm just that you don't strike me as\nsomeone who worries about what other\npeople think of you or what you do where\nwhere does that come from and how do you\ndefine or decide what's important to you\nI live my life day to day me myself I'm\nnot living my life for other people so\nif I'm so concerned with being called\nCEO I'm going to take on a role because\nI care that other people think that this\nis my title but I have to do something\nevery day that I don't enjoy that makes\nno sense so why would I live my life for\nthis title for other people's opinions\nwhen this is what I want to do within\nthe business and this is what important\nto me and so I like to take inventory of\nmy life pretty frequently so I usually\ndo like my new year's goals and\nintentions I like to call them\nintentions not goals because it's what I\nintend on doing for the year and then\nI'm always talking with myself with like\nmy journal every day so it's like what's\nimportant to me how do I want to feel\ntoday\num what things do I love and so I'll go\nthrough and I'll make like a note on my\nphone of like what are my energy\ndrainers right now like what do I not\nlike doing what of these things can I\neliminate and if that's running the\nfinances of the business like I don't\nwant to do that so who can we hire\neventually to do this thing and so it's\neventually just like taking less of\nthose drainers off of my plate and so I\ncan really focus my time on the things\nthat I'm good at and I enjoy doing I\nthink it's difficult for people\nespecially women if you have been\ncalling yourself a CEO in the company\nthen you have to make this announcement\nlike oh I stepped down as CEO because we\nhired somebody we never intended to be\nthe CEOs of the business so we didn't\ncall ourselves that in the first place\nso if and when the time came we weren't\nlike it wasn't that we were stepping\ndown as CEOs it was that we just never\nhad CEOs we started the company and a\nCEO is somebody who can help run the\nbusiness when it gets to that like phase\nand so I think it's about taking your\nego out of it and like what do you\nreally want to spend your time doing\nevery day and just focus on that and not\nwhat other people think about what most\npeople probably don't even know what\npeople's titles are anyway like so it's\nlike whether you're the founder or the\nCEO or the whatever it is you are most\npeople don't know they just think of it\nas your business and so don't so much\nworry about that or you're going to\nspend your time every day doing\nsomething you don't actually want to do\nand you're not going to be happy and\nthen the business might suffer because\nof that yeah you've talked so much about\nhabits and routines like you have a\nmorning routine an evening routine you\njust talked about your journaling habit\nyour intentions for the uh\nwere these things that became a part of\nyour life over time and if you could\nwalk us through one of them or a couple\nof them in depth of your actual practice\nso I'd love to hear about what is your\npersonal meditation practice uh and then\nand then anyone other one that you pick\nthat just walk us through it because I\nthink we see this in successful CEOs\nsuccessful Founders entrepreneurs and\njust happier healthier people that\nroutine and a commitment to practices\nare really beneficial in their life what\nare some of yours that you can walk us\nthrough with a bit more yeah so on the\npodcast I kept interviewing people and\neveryone talked about a morning routine\nand meditation and I'm like if all of\nthese really successful people that I\nadmire do this there's got to be\nsomething to it so pre-pandemic I was\njust waking up working going to sleep\nworking on the weekends I had no routine\nin schedule that was not great for me\nbut during the pandemic I actually had\ntime for myself to pick up a meditation\nHabit to figure out how to journal to\nmake a morning routine for myself so I\nstarted doing a morning routine because\nI thought other people were doing it and\nI think think that's where I failed at\nfirst because I'm like oh these people\ndo these things in their morning routine\nI need to wake up and work out I need to\nwake up and do this but those things\ndidn't work for me so it was trying\nsomething for a week do I feel better\nyes or no what things should I eliminate\nand what things should I keep and I got\nit to a routine of the things that feel\nbest for me those five things might not\nwork for you but it's the things that\nwork best for me and so it's trial and\nerror figuring out how can I set myself\nup best for the day basically once I\nstart working in the day my mind is\ngoing at all times and I am always\nsomeone who's thinking of 50 different\nthings and so meditation is the only\ntime in my day where I'm actually just\nsitting and being and thinking of either\nthe meditation that's happening if it's\nguided or I do like a 13 to 20 minute\nmeditation where there's no music\nthere's no guiding I just have like a\nbell that goes\nand I'm just sitting and breathing and\nI'm never in Stillness all day I'm on my\nphone I'm on the computer and so having\nthat time for myself really just is like\na great way to start the day\num and then another thing is the\nintentions and I mentioned before I like\nto call them intentions instead of goals\nbecause I think we might feel like we\ndidn't meet our goals if we didn't do\nthis thing that we set out on a piece of\npaper to cross off but if it's my\nintention to do my morning routine every\nday I'm intending to do it but if I\ndon't I don't feel like a failure\nbecause I only did it five days this\nweek or if I intend to live a healthier\nlife and eat well and work out because I\nwant to fuel my body that's my intention\ninstead of being like Oh I have to be\nthis weight or I want to do this thing\nor be at this goal I think it's a lot\nKinder with yourself so then you feel\nmore motivated by actually doing them\nand checking them off versus I didn't\ncomplete this goal for myself\num I think it's also great to set actual\ntangible goals you can do but also know\nthat some goals are out of our\ncontrol so if you want to hit a certain\nnumber follower or a subscriber or a\ndownload count you cannot control that\nyou can create the best content you can\nbut you can't make someone watch the\ncontent you can't make them download or\nfollow so what you don't want to do is\nsay like I have to hit a million\nfollowers by the end of the year and if\nyou don't hit it be upset you can say I\nintend to create the best community this\nyear that I can I want the followers\nthat are there to love me and be happy\nwith the content I create and then you\ncan ask yourself are they happy am I\nfulfilled with the content I'm creating\nand then that intention can be crossed\noff versus being disappointed that you\ndidn't hit this number that was out of\nyour control to begin with so those\nintentions are really important for me\nand then within the business you we do\nset goals for ourselves of things that\nwe want to do and then set realistic\nexpectations for ourselves of like what\ndo we think we actually can do\num versus like insane goals that you\nmight not get to and then always feeling\nsad if you if you're not hitting them I\nlove the way you just described the\ndifference between intentions and goals\nI\nI hope everyone because you know\nwhenever you're setting New Year's\nresolutions you're setting goals you're\nsetting new quarterly goals like that\nlanguage needs to change because goals\nare what what you want out of something\nand intentions are what you put into\nsomething and you only get out what you\nput in and I love that it's so much\nbetter to measure yourself against your\nintentions measuring yourself against\nyour goals will always make you feel\nlike a failure yeah and I think\nsomething I've learned recently too is I\ncan have goals and intentions for myself\nof things that I'm working towards\nbecause I want great things in life like\nI'm doing all the things I want because\nI have these big things that I think I\ncan accomplish but I can do that while\nstill being present and happy with where\nI am today and that's come from really\nbeing in my 30s so before I was always\nyou know when you're younger you're like\nI have to be married and have kids by\n30. I have to do this like Forbes 30\nunder 30. I have to do all these things\nby this age but it's like why when life\nis long and one of the best exercises I\ndid for myself was I wrote down\neverything I wanted to accomplish in my\nlife and the age I thought it might\nhappen when I got to 45 I had nothing\nleft there was I had nothing left to\nreach and I'm like if I accomplish all\nthese things by 45 I'm gonna live for\ndecades longer what more do I have to\nlook forward to in the years to come\nthat gave me so much pause to enjoy the\njourney I'm on enjoy where I'm at today\nbe happy because these things we have\ntoday the things we get to do the jobs\nwe get to do the brands we get to work\nwith the opportunities we have we wished\nfor the things we have now so I don't\nwant to rush through them just trying to\nget to where I'm trying to go I want to\nbe happy where I am today I know it's\ngoing to come in time and if it's a\nlittle bit later than I thought it's\nfine because I have so many more years\nleft of my life to do all these things\nthat I hope to accomplish yeah that's\nsuch a great exercise that if you did\nwrite down everything you wanted to do\nmost people would put the end date as\nlike 30 or 40. it was like 1 45 and it's\nlike you should have achieved everything\nand life so much longer than that and\nthere's so many more gaps in between I\nhad a friend who recent recently\nFound Love and his business and his work\ntook a bit of a back burner but he found\nsomeone that he really wants to spend a\nlot of time with him that's what he was\ndoing and I was saying you just won\nright like he you could see that as like\ntwo years out in your business journey\nand so now his business is two years\nbehind but I was like you've just saved\nyourself years because you found a\npartner that you're really connected to\nand I think often we think of it as like\nthey're separate like there's work and\nthen there's life and it's like well no\nno they're so interrelated the way you\njust shared that is spectacular like I\nhope everyone writes that down takes\nthat away Marietta what are you working\non right now I feel like you're someone\nwho because you started therapy at six\nwhich is just like that that's another\nanother incredible thing but like what\nare you working on right now personally\nwhat's something that you're grappling\nwith what's something that you're\nwanting to be better at for yourself for\nyour friends your family whatever\nanything around you I think the presence\nis a big thing for me um I think because\nI used to focus so much on the future\nand the things I wanted for themselves\nthat exercise really did change my\nmindset so having a gratitude journal\nand writing down every day I think a lot\nof times we're busy in our days in our\ncareers like oh I have to go do this I\nhave to do this today but it's not I\nhave to do it's I get to do so I get to\ngo work here I get to go to this\nopportunity instead of I have to do\nthese things and that really changed my\nmindset of being grateful for what I get\nto do every single day and really\nfocusing on that and not being so\nstressed about things happening in a\ncertain year or age I'm 36 now and I\nkeep feeling like oh I'm still not ready\nto do all these things like I'm still so\nyoung I think the the older I get the\nyounger I still feel yeah where when I\nwas in my 20s I was like oh I'm getting\nso old or like oh 36 is so old but now\nthat I'm 36 so I'm like it's still so\nyoung so I think focusing on on the\npresent being happy with where I am\ntoday the things I have today and\npracticing that gratitude each and every\nday and then I think as I've gotten\nolder too because my parents are older\ntaking care of my health it's not about\nvanity it's about how do I feel my best\nhow do I stay active my parents are\nreally young and smart in their minds\nand their bodies they still travel by\nthemselves they're very independent\npeople and I think it's because they've\ntaken care of themselves and my dad does\nthe crossword every day he reads books\nmy mom's very independent I think\nkeeping your mind young and so doing\nthings for brain health now that we're\ngetting older I'm like okay brain health\nour health Mobility those things are all\nimportant of taking care of yourself not\njust for Vanity's sake but for the\nhealth of yourself so that you can be\nyour best self in decades to come\nbecause I hope when I'm 60 70 80 90 I'm\nstill able to do a lot of things that I\ndon't feel stagnant in my body because I\nlet my age catch up with me I'm in the\nsame boat as you I feel like if that is\nreally for that we're like your 20s you\nstill feel like a super person and then\nin your 30s you're like oh wait a minute\nthere is something known as getting\nolder physically I mean and you start\njust becoming aware of how much your\nbody has been through because you could\nand then you go why would I want to put\nmy body through that anymore like why\nwould I do that damage to my body and I\nI'm definitely with you on that I'm\nspending so much time reading about\nlongevity and learning about longevity\nand and because not because I want to\nlive longer or for vanity but I want to\nlive healthier for longer and I think\nthat's the difference right yeah I think\nhealth is so important to us and taking\ncare of ourselves what we eat what we\nput into our bodies how we spend our\ntime our brain our energy all of these\nthings because we do want to have lower\ncortisol levels for the rest of our\nlives and have quality sleep so that our\nbrain health is there so that we feel\nbest in our mind to function every\nsingle day and so um I do want to live a\nlong healthy youthful smart life where I\ncan do so many things for decades to\ncome and so those things are so\nimportant to me so it's like watching\ndocumentaries around blue zones and like\nwhat are they doing here and how do they\nhow do they live longer healthier\nhappier lives and so um those things are\nso important especially our health\nbecause we know like when you don't feel\ngood there's nothing you can do about it\nso it's like the second I I got sick\nrecently and like as soon as I was done\nI was like wow I'm so grateful for my\nbody I'm so grateful for my immune\nsystem and my good health because when\nyou feel bad you take for granted the\ndays that you feel good so it's really\nabout thinking about your gratitude each\nday of feeling good in your body and the\ndays that you feel good so one of the\nthings I write down in my journal is I\nam grateful for my body mind and soul\nI'm happy for my my physical and mental\nhealth and happiness because that's so\nimportant to me because it's not just\nlike my physical health but like how do\nI feel in my mind do I feel happy and\nyou know on the days when you don't feel\nso happy you have so much gratitude for\nthe days that you do feel good mentally\nabsolutely absolutely and I feel like\nyou're a high performer you're massively\nambitious you're like Optimal Peak\nPerformance individual and I can relate\nto them what that comes with is you\nnaturally have higher cortisol levels\nbecause you're doing more stressful\nthings right like when when Kobe\nBryant's playing in the final of a game\nit's like he's having to deal with more\nstress and then perform but then recover\nas fast right and that's what all the\nbest athletes the World Cups going on\nright now and it's the same thing all\nthe best soccer players in the world are\ndealing with more stress it's not that\nthey don't feel stressed when they play\nat that high level so what are what are\nsome of the things I mean you've given\nus so many habits but that's just\nsomething because it's on my mind too\nI'm I'm thinking that if I and I'm\nspeaking to anyone who's listening who\nthinks they're really ambitious they\nhave big goals or big intentions but\nthen at the same time then you have to\nbe even more on top of your cortisol\nlevels because you're naturally going to\nexperience more stress yeah this morning\nI was talking to someone and she was\nlike what workouts are you doing I was\nlike I love Pilates like I don't want to\ngo into a workout where I feel more\nstressed going through it because I want\nsomething that makes me feel good and\nrested um I always wear my aura ring\nwhich I'm obsessed I love it and I track\nmy sleep every night and like quality\nsleep really does make me feel my best\nthe next day I drink magnesium every\nnight before I go to bed taking like my\nvitamins and supplements\num and then really not like I don't\nwatch scary movies like I'm not doing\nthings that are gonna make me feel more\nexcited or like feelings that would make\nme feel more anxious so anything that's\ngoing to make me feel more anxious\nbecause I already have to feel anxious\nand stressed in like my job so I don't\nwant these added like books or shows\nthat are going to make me feel a little\nbit more stressed out and then I'm\nsomeone who it physically manifests in\nmy body and so one day I was really\nstressed out I was at the airport I\nmissed my flight I was so stressed\nbecause I had to get back for something\nthe next day there was no flights out\nand instead of just relaxing and like\ntaking a breath I woke up the next day I\nhad a rash on my body because when I get\nstressed I so I have to remember like\nokay I can't get stressed out about\nthings I can't control I need to take a\nbreath or else it's gonna physically\nshow up in my body when I'm like overly\nstressed about something especially\nsomething like that I made it home it\nwas fine\nit was all good but I stressed myself\nout for no reason so it's like doing all\nthese things that can control it because\nstress is going to happen in our lives\nwe are we're gonna have stressful days\nthings are out of our control our job\nour personal life those things will make\nus stressed out so it's like how can I\ncontrol all the other things in my day\nto feel my best yeah I love your Insight\non if you get to have a stressful day\nanyway you don't want your workout or\nyour meditation to be the thing that\nstresses you out more Mariana I've\nlearned so much about you today\nliterally you have I I'm so happy I got\nto do this with you and I recommend\nanyone who's listening or watching\nplease do this with your friends because\nwhen you interview your friend or you\ninterview a parent or you interview a\nfamily member\nyou realize just how much life\nexperience is stored within this human\nthat you know you call a friend or a\nfamily member uh you know this very well\nMariana we end every interview with a\nfinal five uh these are the Fast Five\nwhere you have to answer each question\nin one word to one sentence maximum uh\nbut before we do that I want to ask you\ndid I ask was there something I didn't\nask you that you wish I asked you or\nsomething you wanted to share that's on\nyour heart that you wanna that you feel\nwe didn't touch upon I think all good I\nthink I just this is like a love note to\nyou but like I love your content it\nmakes me feel so good and what I want to\nput out in the world is content that\nmakes people feel either motivated or\ninspired or something in their life that\nadds value and I feel like I always get\nthat from you and so thank you for your\ncontent because it makes me feel that\nway and that's the things that I want to\nconsume every day like did I take away\nsomething that made me feel better or\ninspired or motivated and I feel like\nyou always bring that out of your\nguesses no and honestly like you've\ngiven us such a unique perspective and\nthis is why I wanted to talk to you\nbecause I find you to be no not only are\nyou a successful business person but\nyou're you're committed to your\nself-care and I think that those two\nthings together are really inspiring to\nme and that's the kind of energy I want\nmy audience to feel that you can be\nsuccessful and do self-care you can be\nambitious and be affectionate and kind\nlike you can be courageous but be really\nsweet and I see that all in you and I\nreally I love people who can like blend\nthese opposites because I think for too\nlong people have been made to believe\nwell if you're bold and brave then\nyou're strong or you're weak and meek\nand I'm like well no there's this\nbeautiful Harmony in between and so\nthat's my love note back to you as well\nI love that I'm going to start saying\nthat I like that but these are your\nfinal five uh the first question is what\nis the best advice you've ever heard or\nreceived don't be afraid of being told\nno so just asking people for something\nif they say no don't be offended but you\nnever know who's gonna say yes that's a\ngreat piece of advice we've never had\nthat that is very good uh and I do that\na lot so I'm with you you okay second\nquestion what is the worst piece of\nadvice you've ever heard or received the\nworst piece of advice was people told us\nwhen we launched summer Fridays not to\nlaunch with jet lag mask and so I think\nthat was in in our gut and intuition the\nproduct we wanted to launch the brand\nwith I don't know if it would be what it\nis today without that so if you have a\ngut feeling about something you want to\ndo personally or professionally even if\nthe experts tell you something else go\nwith what you feel is best in your gut I\nlove that that's and and I love that\nexample for that as well because it's\nusually the thing I I remember I've\nnever done a lot of brand Partnerships\nor brand deals because my content was\nalways so open and wide that it didn't\nreally there weren't really industries\nthat crossed over as much in the\nbeginning and I remember one brand\nreached out to me\nand they said Jay we want you to do this\nvideo they didn't give me a an idea they\njust gave me a vision of like we want it\nto be about people uh living life on\ntheir own terms like that's the the\nspirit of the video and I was like I\nlove that I can totally Vibe with that\nand I can't even remember I had some\nlike made up fee at the time like well\nat this very early days I was like\nwhatever it wasn't that much and I went\nand made this video and I put my heart\nand soul into it because it was like one\nof my first brand deals and it was even\nthough the brand deal was Tiny it was\njust so important to me that I got to\nmake this piece of content\nand I shared it with them and they were\nlike Jay we don't yeah this is not gonna\nwork and I was like I put some I put\nmore money into the production than they\nwere paying me but I was so passionate\nabout and they're like yeah it's not\ngonna work I didn't have a contract I\nwasn't tuned in to what I needed they\nsaid no we don't want this we don't\nthink you're the right fit for this I\nuploaded the video anyway because I\nreally liked it to this day it's my most\nwatched video of all time it's got\n387 million views like it's on Facebook\nit's one of my biggest videos of all\ntime and I love the video it's it's\nawesome but they didn't get it and\nthat's the video that changed my entire\ncareer and I'm really happy that there's\nno brand attached to it because it's\ntrue and real and yeah I love that yeah\nyeah but really it's like going with\nyour gut like you know what's gonna work\nbest totally and so even if these\nexperts tell you it's the wrong thing or\ndon't do this but you know this is what\nyou want to create put it out into the\nworld because look your most watched\nvideo our best-selling yeah which and I\nlove those examples because I think we\ndo list to The Experts and so love that\nlove that love that question number\nthree what's something that you used to\nvalue that you don't value as much\nanymore\nsocial a bit which is weird because it's\nalso our jobs but I think I used to\nValue what it was on there so much and\nnow I understand it's a tool to do my\njob it's not my entire identity and so I\nhave a really good relationship I think\nwith it now what's the biggest lesson\nyou've learned in the last 12 months\nI would say just taking care of my\nhealth is really the most important like\nthere's no amount of money or anything\nin the world that you can do like your\nhealth is the most important thing you\ncan take care of things will come so do\neverything you can in your control to be\nyour best self and feel your best\nbecause that way if something were to\ncome you are in your best shape that you\ncan be yeah absolutely couldn't agree\nmore very true for my year this year too\nso I definitely take that to hot Fifth\nand final question if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow what would it be oh a one law\nit's kind of a little bit we talked\nabout earlier of like saying yes and no\nto things so if you want to say yes to\nsomething it should be an absolute full\nbody yes I really want to do this if you\nfeel any hesitation or any no there\nmight be something in your gut and\nintuition telling you why I want to say\nno to this or why I don't want to do\nthis and then you end up saying yes and\nyou don't really want to do it anyway so\nsay yes to the things you feel full body\nyes to and say no to the things that you\ndon't feel absolutely truly like aligns\nwith you and your gut and your intuition\nthat's great uh Mariana Hugh everyone\nthe podcast is called life with Mariana\nyou know the brand
