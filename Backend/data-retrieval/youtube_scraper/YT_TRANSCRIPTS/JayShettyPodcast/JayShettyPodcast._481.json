    "transcript": "let's start somewhere there's 11 sort of\npoints in the book that you go through\nbut I think in this time in this day and\nage with all the kind of current events\nthat are happening in the world one of\nthe things you talked about in there is\nways to find calm in the chaos could you\ntalk a little bit about that yeah\nabsolutely I think we're just living in\nuncertain times we're living in chaos as\nyou just said it we're living in times\nwhere we're constantly surprised by\nwhat's going to happen next and it's not\na good surprise like it's not like a\nbirthday surprise it's it's a negative\nsurprise sometimes and I think what's\nhappened is that we've started to\nrecognize and I really trust the people\nlistening and watching right now we've\nstarted to realize that the answer is\nnot going to come from outside of us we\ncan't just keep waiting for suddenly the\nstock market to be perfectly aligned we\ncan't keep waiting for the political\nclimate of the environment to be\nperfectly aligned what we need to do is\nfind and more importantly not just find\nbut create that peace and that come\nwithin us and that's why I talk about\nthinking like a monk because when you\nlook at the brains of monks across the\nworld they have the calmest happiest\nbrains on planet Earth and I want to\ngive people access to how to have that\nbecause when you start getting access to\nthat now you don't need the weather to\nbe perfect now you don't need to wait\nfor everyone to give you love every\nsingle day now you're not dependent on\nanything outside of you but you\nrecognize that you can create calm\nyou're not going to look for calm and so\nthat's the perspective that I want\npeople to do it's beautiful I was\nreading in the book where you're talking\nabout these monks they actually measure\ntheir gamma waves even at sleep yeah and\nthey are higher than everybody else\nright than everybody else and so you\ntapped into this ironically you graduate\nfrom college they just need to know the\nbackground on this as I understand it\nanyway it kind of in your family you say\nit's sort of like you're a doctor a\nlawyer or a failure right those are my\nthree options yeah and you end up\ngraduating but before even at graduation\nyou go away and go live with the monks\nright you literally how did you make\nthis decision and what overall would you\nsay was the impact that happened to you\nwhile you did that yeah absolutely so\nyeah a bit of background I grew up a\nteacher's pet until the age of 14. so I\nwas an obedient kid probably like the\nperfect son worked really hard at school\nand then at 14 I went the opposite way I\nstarted rebelling I started\nexperimenting with everything under the\nsun and at 18 I was at this interesting\npoint I think everyone is when if you\nthink back to being 18 and everyone was\nlistening and watching think about being\n18 years old again and how\nimpressionable you were and what kind of\ndecisions you were making I used to go\nand listen to CEOs entrepreneurs experts\ncelebrities speak and once I was invited\nto hear a monk speak and I thought to\nmyself what am I going to learn from a\nmonk like there's nothing to learn from\na monk like what's he going to teach me\nhow to be silent like who cares and I\nsaid to my friends I would only go if we\nwent to a bar afterwards like that was\nmy like I was like I want it in writing\nthat describes where you really were\nliterally that describes where I was\ngenuinely I'm not making this up and I\nend up going and this is what I love\nabout that moment the best moments in\nyour life are sometimes the most\nhumbling ones true I was humbled because\nI went into that environment expecting\nto get nothing and having my life\ntransformed so what ended up happening\nis I felt and you've probably felt this\nwhen you when you meet people when I was\n18 I'd met people who are beautiful I'd\nmet people who were powerful I'd met\npeople who were rich\nI'd met people who are famous I'd met\npeople who are successful but I don't\nthink I'd met anyone who was truly happy\nand even now if I asked you to count on\nyour hand how many people you know that\nare truly content satisfied and happy I\nthink we'd struggle absolutely and I\nfelt that from him at 18 and the great\nthing is I know him now I've known him\nfor the last 14 years this this\nparticular monk his name is I talk about\nin the book he's still the same\nand so he's maintained that so I started\ngetting fascinated with him so I spent\nevery summer vacation with him from age\n18 to 8 22 every summer vacation I would\nspend half of it\ninterning at Big finance companies\nsteakhouses bars fancy suits and I'd\nspend the other half living as a monk in\nIndia that's remarkable robes sleeping\non the floor and meditating oh my gosh\nand then when I graduated I decided that\nthe monk path was more fulfilling than\nthe banking path and so I chose it what\na remarkable young life it was it was my\nfirst like experiment you know it's like\nyou're literally testing it and I never\njudged myself and that's what I love\nabout being able to live life in that\nway like I didn't judge myself when I\nwas at the monastery I wasn't like oh no\nI was just drinking last week I can't do\nthis and then when I was out there with\nthe guys I wasn't like oh no I should be\nmeditating I was just like let me really\nexperience each life to its fullest and\nthen I can decide which one really fills\nme with joy it's amazing you're talking\nthe most because just this week I was on\na show they said what topic would you\nlike to cover above anyway they left it\nopen to me and I said I think I should\nbe happiness because it's so rare for\nmost people in the world there people\nhave asked me on the show when I started\nthe show I was fascinated because you\nyear shows had 54 million downloads the\nfirst year right and people say what do\nthe people that you interview have in\ncommon they're some of my best friends\nsome of your best friends are on your\nshow and I thought well I wonder when I\ndo it is it going to be their Drive\ntheir Ingenuity their Charisma their\nwork ethic their Brilliance and many of\nthem have all of those qualities but I\nthink you would agree with me that even\ntop performers that we work with some of\nthem have a touch of not so happy going\non in their life even the people that\nyou think have their whole world\ntogether they too seek happiness and\nI'll be honest with you because I'm such\na fan of yours I thought well what\nalmost like what you thought what do I\nhave to learn from you about happiness\nfrom the monk perspective I didn't think\nthe same and as I started to read the\nbook first there were many Revelations\nfor me secondly there were some things\nin the book that I think I do practice\npretty well but the way you phrase it\nand position it is beautiful as you as\nis your Norm so one of the things you\nsay early in the book you talk about\nselfless sacrifice and there's this\ngreat well that'll mess up in there that\none of the monks had shared with you\nabout that in the shade that you don't\nwant to sit in plant a tree right yeah\nyeah the statement this was the\nstatement that when I'm sitting in that\nroom as an 18 year old thinking about\ngoing to a bar this was that statement\nthat penetrated my heart and I was like\noh because so he was making the point\nthat if you have any gifts and if you\nhave any talents in the world if you're\nnot using them in the service of others\nthen worth nothing and that's a very\nbold point and the way he put it he was\nquoting another writer and he wrote that\nplant trees under whose shade you do not\nplan to sit and what that means is most\nof us plant trees or we do things for\npeople because we're expecting that one\nday they're going to reciprocate and do\nsomething bad for us and he was like\nreal service is when you do things for\npeople that can't do anything back for\nyou at that time and you're not\nexpecting anything and for me for my 18\nyear old mind I was like Oh I thought my\nskills were just to impress women and\nmake money and you know just do what\neveryone else does and when he was\ntalking about selfless sacrifice and\nservice I was like I want to test that\nbecause either this man is a genius or\nhe's completely crazy but if he's given\nup and he went to IIT so he went to the\nIndian Institute of Technology one of\nthe best universities in the world he\nwas like a number one student and he\ngave that all up to be a monk so I was\nlike there's something there because you\ndon't just give that up especially in\nIndia the pressure to perform and to be\na top grade student is so high that to\nwalk away from that like his family and\neveryone would have just completely so I\nwas like I want to follow that path wow\nbro I'm fascinated by you because I as\nnow that I'm in your presence everyone\nshould know that Jay and I have\ncommunicated for a very long time we\nhave tons of new friends but we have a\nrare on the show that I'm in the\npresence of somebody and I I feel your\nenergy speak about this I think I had\nthis impression that someone who's sort\nof Monk related is just sort of just\nthere's this feeling I get that's just\nit's strong peace but it's strong too\nthere's an energy about you and one of\nthe things that I think that you\neventually overcame that you talk about\nbeautifully in the book and I see every\nday people ask me often\nthere's all these memes out there we all\nhear hey you know what everyone's\nopinion about you is none of your\nbusiness but people really struggle with\nfinding a pathway to happiness because\nthey are borderline obsessed with the\nthoughts and opinions of other people\nand you discuss that a little bit too\nhow would you tell someone who's\nstruggling with this which is 99 of the\npeople who are listening to this how\nthey might deal with that or overcome it\nyeah I give this analogy in the book\nabout how we're all like method Act is\nso I'm a big movie fan like I'm a big\nmovie fan and so for me some of my\nfavorite actors are like Heath Ledger\nwho played the Joker in The Dark Knight\nyou've got Daniel Day Lewis who's an\nincredible method actor now I talk about\nin the book how Daniel Day Lewis at some\npoints he was wearing the clothes for\nGangs of New York in his normal life to\nthe point that he even got pneumonia in\nhis normal life because he's wearing\nthese old raggedy clothes and he goes at\none point he almost went crazy\npretending to be someone that he wasn't\nnow when I heard that I read that I\nthought wow isn't that all of us like\nyou wear a certain role to work you wear\na certain role at home you wear a\ncertain role with your friends and in\nplaying all those roles you end up\nmethod acting and forgetting who you are\noh my goodness that is beautiful and for\nme that's what I'm just seeing across\nand in and of myself me too and I see\nmyself do that I become you become who\nyou think other people want you to be\nand so for me the first step in that is\nwriting down everything you're chasing\nright now like this is a great strategy\nand a tool and if anyone's listening or\nwatching get a pen and paper if you're\nnot take a screenshot of this time code\nright now and come back to this because\nI want you to sit down and I want you to\nwrite down everything you're chasing\nright now whatever it is\nmake that list second question where did\nthat idea come from did that idea come\nfrom your mom your dad your friend your\nbrother did the idea come from me or Ed\ndid the idea come from I don't know some\nbook that you read like did the idea\ncome from your heart and your mind or\nwas it born because it was influenced by\nyour friend who just got promoted yes\nyour friend who just got proposed to\nyour friend who just sold their company\nfor a hundred million dollars like is\nthat was that the reason because then\nthat may not be your dream and then the\nthird question you have to ask yourself\nis is this my dream\nor this is the question is your dream\nreally your dream and when you go\nthrough that exercise you want to keep\nthe stuff that's yours and you want to\ndistance yourself from the stuff that's\nwhat incredible advice you know I'm a\nlittle bro I got to tell you there's\nsuch wisdom for such a young man I'm a\nlittle bit further down the road\nage-wise and wisdom-wise and wisdom-wise\nI'm excited to learn from you a lot man\nso certainly not but I appreciate you\nsaying that I mean but I can I can\nvalidate what you've just said I'm I\nthink dream catching in your life can\nbecome something that gains momentum as\nyou vibrate a little bit higher\nfrequency you can begin to attract\nthings and I'm a big believer in that\nand I have many times achieved a dream\nor two that when I got there was\ncompletely empty and every time that I\ngot to those dreams when they were empty\nthey were not my dreams they were\nsomething that I thought someone else\nwanted me to do or something that I saw\nsomeone else have that I thought I\nwanted a place a destination a home\nsomething and you're 100 right but the\ntimes when I've got clear on things that\nI really wanted that really mattered to\nme and when they were good enough that\nthey materialized in my life what great\njoy they've brought me and they're\nusually extremely simple things yeah as\nyou illustrate as well I love hearing\nyou say that it's nice to get validated\non that because I think you've achieved\nso much in your life and it's incredible\nto see what you've achieved and I think\nthat's what people forget is that the\nthings that bring you Joy and because\nyou achieved what you wanted to achieve\nlet's talk about that for a minute you\ntalk about Dharma a little bit how do\nyou figure that part out in your life\nyeah so Dharma is a fascinating concept\nI absolutely love it and the loose\nlanguage terminology for it is purpose\nor calling or your mission and vision in\nlife like what are you meant to do it's\nkind of like what you're meant to do and\nthe thing about Dharma is Dharma talks\nabout how we think we have to learn lots\nof stuff when actually Dharma is\nunlearning and bringing out what you\nalready have so one of the things I\nmentioned in the book is that you can't\nbe anything there's there's two lies\nwe've been told growing up the first lie\nis you're nothing\nyou're stupid you're worthless you're\nnot going to make it and I'm sure many\npeople are listening and watching have\nheard that from teachers parents Aunts\nUncles whoever it is and then the other\nlie that we're actually told and I don't\nthink it's a lie I think it's positive\nbut sometimes it's misconstrued is you\ncan be anything right\nand and we all know that's not true too\nand it's unfair because sometimes people\nget misled you're exactly right and the\nDharma point of view is you can't be\nanything you want but you can be\neverything you are\nand what I mean by that is you have a\ngenius a potential a power inside of you\nthat you don't know yet why because\nyou're inexperienced it's not that\nyou're unqualified it's your\ninexperience so people are saying I'm\nstuck I don't know where my life's going\nI don't know why purpose is so you're\nperceiving yourself to be unqualified or\nunder qualified actually you're just\ninexperienced you just haven't done\nenough things to let the magnet of your\nlife tell you what it's attracted to so\nfor me that's what dharma's encouraging\npeople to do in this beautiful verse\nfrom this Vedic text among text called\nthe Manu Smithy and it says that when\nyou protect your purpose your purpose\nprotects you and what I love about that\nand you will appreciate this because I\nknow you're someone that I feel is\nliving this\na purpose is like a rare gem and you\nhave to protect it people will tell you\nthat gem is worthless they'll tell you\nthat their gem is not going to make it\nthey'll tell you that that gem that\nJewel has no value and that's why you\nhave to protect your own purpose because\nthe world is going to constantly try and\npull you away from it so Dharma is a\nreal it's not a belief system it's a\nfact that you've got skills genius\npotential is sitting inside of you and\nyou have not seen it yet and I've seen\nthis across the board I literally just\ngot a call from the I got a call from\nthe CEO of Instagram probably about\nthree to six months ago it's been a\nwhile now and she called me up and she\nsaid Jay we just had I don't think I've\ntold this story anywhere so you've\nsparked it out of me but she goes we've\njust had this call uh sorry we've just\nhad this talk from this speaker that we\nbrought in\nand this speaker spent years in a\nrefugee camp and in this refugee camp\nnot only did he\nfigure out how to survive he actually\ngot his mother to save up for a computer\nand he coded a game he taught himself\nout of code and he coded a game that\nhelps people understand how not to be\nviolent in a refugee camp\nand then he used Facebook to promote it\noh my gosh and they said we were so\ninspired by him that we brought him in\nto speak to Instagram and Facebook and\nthen we asked him the question we asked\nhim what has had the impact on you like\nwhat kept you inspired\nand this guy goes he goes I used to\nwatch this guy called Jay Shetty on\nFacebook and and literally when she told\nme that she said literally the whole\naudience was in tears at his story\nand I said to her I said I need to talk\nto him right away because I need to tell\nhim I'm like dude you've just inspired\nme like my like I'm like dude your life\nis way harder than mine's ever been and\nif you can realize that you have the\npotential in a refugee camp to teach\nyourself how to code and to help people\nnot be violent I mean you're inspiring\nmore lives his name is luau Mayan I'm\nlike dude you're inspiring so many more\nlives than I ever like it's just\nbeautiful and to me that story I'm not\nsharing it to show my role in his life\nI'm sharing it because I'm like if he\ncan find a way to find his Dharma yes\nthen we haven't got any excuses brother\nthat's Mac it's funny but right before\nyou told the story about him yeah I was\ngoing to tell you that it's so obvious\nto me that you're in your home and\nthat's perfect evidence of it it's so\nobvious to me as I sit next to you and I\nthe book guys I want you to get this\nbook it has my full endorsement and the\nreason it does first off is because this\nman that you're hearing these incredible\nwords from wrote it but it's it's a\nunique book because it talks about these\nprinciples that are eternally true\nbut there's also like\nwhat I would call fundamental strategy I\nwas going to say basic but it's not\nbasic it's fundamental strategies I was\nsurprised in a book that talks so much\nabout happiness that you get as granular\nas a morning routine right which I'm a\nhuge believer of and I think sometimes\nbut you do it differently right and so I\nonly go through a few things because we\nwanted to read the book yeah right but\nlike just so you know guys we're at one\npercent less than one percent of the\nbook so far you're very good but it's\ntrue but so talk a little bit just\ntactically for a second about importance\nof it and and the way that you perceive\na morning routine yeah so the beautiful\nthing about monk life is half the day is\nself and half the day is service that's\nhow you're taught to live okay so the\nmorning hours are for you to fill\nyourself it's almost like putting on\nmental emotional and physical armor like\nthat's what a morning routine is odd\ndays are tiring our days are busy our\ndays are draining well guess what if you\ndidn't put your armor on in the morning\nand you're going out to battle\nhow many knives are going to cut you how\nmany swords are going to pierce you how\nmany wounds are you going to come home\nwith how many of you come back home\nfeeling wounded I come back home feeling\nwounded sometimes but guess what if you\nput your armor on in the morning a\nwarrior would never go out onto a\nBattlefield\nand life can be a battlefield work can\nbe full of conflict sometimes your\nrelationships can be damaging sometimes\nyour friendships can be toxic sometimes\nso we are warriors in one sense and so\nwithout wearing that so for me a morning\nroutine is putting on emotional armor\nwhich is meant to protect you for the\nrest of the day and that way even if you\ndo get pierced or you do get popped or\nyou do get cut you're protected and I\nknow that when I my morning routine is\nat its best I feel protected I know\nexactly whereas when my morning routine\nis weakened I feel weak and so for me\nthe morning routine as I get strategic\nabout it there's two principles you have\nto know\nlocation has energy and time has memory\nif you do something in the same place\nevery day that place now holds that\nenergy\nand this is huge like it's it's just so\nbig and I'm grateful for that reaction\nbecause people don't realize how how\npowerful this is like when I meditated\nin temples that were 5 000 years old in\nSouth India it was easier to meditate\nbecause people have been meditating\nthere for thousands of years and so when\nyou find a space in your home and even\nif you've got like I lived in a 500\nsquare foot apartment in New York four\nyears ago and I just had a tiny Corner\nwhich I dedicated to my sacred practices\nso if you you don't have to have a big\nhome to do this you don't have to be\nwealthy to do this you can find just a\ncorner in your home that you dedicate as\nyour meditation space or your reflection\nspace so first thing location has energy\nsecond thing time has memory and this is\nsomething that people underestimate when\nyou do something at the same time every\nday\nyou remember it\nand time remembers it that's why we\nstruggle to work out at different times\nevery day it's why we struggle like why\ndo we feel hungry at the same time every\nday generally we feel hungry at the same\ntime most people if you've got regulated\ndiet you're full hungry you'll feel\ntired at the same time every day you\nwill look towards that coke can or that\nsugar or that chocolate bar at the same\ntime every day\nand so when you're meditating at the\nsame time if you're exercising at the\nsame time so what I recommend to people\nwow is your morning routine needs four\naspects and it's simple and I call it\ntime it's about making time in the day\nokay so time stands for t-i-m-e T stands\nfor thankfulness there needs to be even\nif it's five minutes five minutes of\nthankfulness of gratitude every single\nmorning and that has to be gratitude\nthat's specific it can't be gratitude\nthat's generic so generic gratitude is\nsomething that anyone could be grateful\nfor oh I'm grateful for the sky I'm\ngrateful for air I'm grateful for water\nthat's cool but it's generic gratitude\nspecific gratitude is I'm grateful for\nthe fact that I have someone calling me\nthis morning I'm grateful for the fact\nthat I can still call my parents I'm\ngrateful for the fact that I have this\nperson in my business who is having such\nan impact I'm grateful you know it's\nspecificity yeah so thankfulness second\none is Insight I think this is one thing\nthat a lot of people are missing which I\nrecommend people listening to you it's\nlike podcast books and and make it\neasier for yourself if you get this book\nleave it open on your bedside table\nleave it open on your kitchen table\nleave it open on your dining table I\nguarantee you you will read more and\nwhat you read will speak to you and I\nthink people underestimate that that\nliterally like when you have it open and\nyou'll just flick to a chapter randomly\nand you pick up one line it will impact\nyou and it'll speak to you so Insight\nyou need Insight every day m is\nmeditation and I believe meditation is\ndifferent for different people as monks\nwe did walking meditations we did Beach\nmeditations we did visualizations we did\nbreath work find your meditation\npractice I give a ton in the book and\nfourth obviously exercise which you can\nspeak to even more than I can I exercise\nto keep fit you look amazing too though\nbut it's an exercise everyone needs to\nfind five minutes a day 15 minutes a day\nof exercise that can just get them\nmoving and guess what if you like sport\nplay sport with a friend if you want to\nshoot hoops go and shoot hoops you don't\nhave to sit on a treadmill no one's\ntelling you to do that make it fun and\nplayful\nbrother I'm you know I've been in\npersonal development and business\nEntrepreneur Space for a long time those\nare two gigantic Revelations that I've\nnever heard before I I'm telling you\nthat that for me in the book right I'm\nreading it and I I literally stopped the\nbook and I brought both my kids in and\nwe talked about this idea of that space\nhaving an energy to it and I want to\nvalidate it because I just think you're\nincredible I just everybody is why I\nwant you to get the book and it's why if\nyou're not you must be following Jay on\nthese different platforms not just one\neither you need to be honest YouTube you\nneed to be on his Instagram his Facebook\nbut I was I'll share this with you\nbecause I'm sure he's a hero of yours\nwhen I was very young well when I was\nyounger actually about your age\nironically I'm running on the beach in\nHawaii and um it's early in the morning\nso I did my morning run speaking about\nexercise and passing me by on the beach\nwas this man I saw him from a distance\nanyway he gets by me and he starts to go\nthe other way and it was Wayne Dyer oh\nwow and a lot of people listen to this\nprobably don't know oh wait guys you\nshould check I mean you can't he's not\nalive anymore you should check out Wayne\ndye's work his books he's one of the\nGodfathers of I mean he was somebody\nthat's really made an impact I ended up\ngetting a chance of long story short\nsitting on the beach with him for about\nan hour as the sun comes up talking\nabout life you talk about just the two\nof us right however one of the\nprinciples he taught me that day and you\narticulate it quite frankly more\nbeautifully and more specifically than\neven he did but I want to validate it\nagain because these are things that\nyou're not getting on any other podcast\nis what Jay and I are talking about\nright now and he asked me he said are\nyou going to write a book and do you\nprepare speeches I said I do and he says\none of the things I do is I have lots of\nthe greatest books in the world surround\nme when I write because these books have\nthat time and energy in them and he\nbelieved that it gave him the great\nwisdom of all of these people when he\njust surrounded himself in that familiar\nspace so for you to now put this in your\nbook about a morning routine is\nremarkable because I was just a passing\nthought that's really written nowhere so\nwow thank God for yourself man and you\njust sparked actually Phil Knight shoe\ndog you know Nike it's like he he he\ntalks about how he actually has a room\nwhere he keeps his books like a library\nbut he takes his shoes off when he\nenters that room because of the wisdom\nand the weight and the energy and the\ngravitas he believes books hold and so\neven as monks we would never wear shoes\naround books because it was considered\nshoes are dirty and you wear them\noutdoors and books are so pure that you\ndon't want to take dirt into that space\nand and supposedly Phil Knight he does\nthe same thing and I was like four\nnights thinking like a monkey\nbut it's just so interesting what you're\nsaying about like books holding energy\nright we believe that books are sacred\nyou don't kick books you don't keep\nbooks on the floor because they have\nknowledge and they're meant to raise you\nup wow wow wow yeah there's so much in\nthere I want to go through a couple more\nthings I want to have the book but I'm\nso fascinated by you I got a couple\npersonal things but one of the things\nyou say in the book I've said this\nbefore and again I just like the way you\napproach it with more depth than I've\ncovered it before I just said this this\nweek to somebody look at me like I was\ncrazy and I talked about I said some of\nyour low self-esteem and your lack of\nconfidence is actually an ego issue that\nyou have and the person stared back at\nme like how in the world is someone with\nno comp or low confidence or low\nself-esteem struggling from an ego issue\nand I don't know that I articulated it\nwell enough although it's in one of the\npodcasts that I've released one of my\nsolo podcasts but you articulate it\nright on so talk about that for a second\nyes it's an interesting concept and it's\ntalked about in the bhagavad-gita and\nnot the monk text and and in the book it\ntalks about how like ego is demonstrated\nin two ways so ego is either I am the\nbest in the world and I think I'm better\nthan everyone or ego says you're the\nworst in the world you're the worst than\neveryone you're you're much worse than\neveryone or you say my life is the best\nand the greatest my life is the worst\nright my life is far worse than anyone\nelse so the ego likes to push you to the\nextreme it doesn't like to give you\nbalance and honesty and reality it likes\nto it wants to make you feel like you've\ngot the worst life in the world and no\none else understands it no one gets that\nonly you get and you get the worst or\nyou're the best and no one else gets you\nyou're untouchable and and people miss\nthat yeah like how does that make sense\nexactly like you said but it does make\nsense because the ego wants to be the\ntop or the bottom but the top of the\nbottom yeah it doesn't just want to be\nat the bottom for the bottom yeah it's\ngoing to be the bottom of the bottom of\nthe bottom but the top of the bottom\nright well set yeah and so we get lost\nin that and we don't think of it as ego\nyeah and that's why the only antidote to\neither ego is self-honesty is being\nhonest and honesty is I'm good at these\nthings I'm great at these things and I\nsuck at these things right like that's\nhonestly like and we could all sit down\nme and you could sit down with a list of\nour skills and map out what we were\ngreat at what we were average at and\nwhat we knew we were terrible at yes and\nthat's honestly that keeps you so away\nfrom either ego do you think part of it\ntoo is that when you're suffering from\nmy life is the worst that you're\nfocusing on you and you're centering on\nyou and there's an ego connection to\nthat too and that this pathway you\ntalked about earlier about getting into\nthe service of other people yeah removes\nyou from you which begins to remove the\nego absolutely I mean that's a huge\npoint you just made right there like you\njust dropped some seriously like that's\nlike a you know please don't\nunderestimate that point everyone's\nlistening like the the challenge with\nall self-centeredness is that all you\nthen indulge yourself in is your own\npain well very good right you just\nindulge you're just submerge and like\nimmerse yourself in pain because it's\nall about you yeah and you know I think\nGandhi said it best is that you find\nyourself when you lose yourself in the\nservice of others and what I love about\nthat statement is that what he means by\nthat is and and empaths get this mixed\nup sometimes so I want to clarify\nbecause a lot of people who are empaths\nare listening like Jay I'm always trying\nto help people but then I get screwed\nover so here's here's the answer you're\nnot helping people so that they can\nthank you you're not helping people so\nthat they can be grateful to you you're\nhelping people because you know it's the\nright thing to do but more importantly\nyou're helping people because you get to\nunderstand and experiment and experience\ndifferent parts of yourself when I\nhelped kids growing up in India that\nwere that didn't have food and we were\ngiving them free food I learned so much\nabout myself when I was able to go and\ngive talks that help people or now I\nmake videos or podcasts you learn more\nabout yourself when you help people you\ndon't learn anything about yourself when\nyou're just sitting there filling out a\nquiz going who am I what am I like you\ndon't figure but you learn about\nyourself when you help people and and\nthis is what we don't realize I can't\nremember who said it recently it was\nsomeone saying about Jeff Bezos but they\nwere saying that you know the scale at\nwhich you succeed is the depth of the\nproblem you solve\nand so even if you look at someone like\nJeff Bezos who's extremely successful\nhe's successful because he solved a\nproblem that many people have Bill Gates\nis successful because he solved a\nproblem so even if you look at Monetary\nsuccess\neven if you look at financial success it\ncomes from service any success comes\nfrom service a musician is famous\nbecause they're serving they're serving\nYou by understanding your feelings\nmaking music you now feel comforted so\nyou follow them they have served you so\ndon't think of services just charity and\ngiving money which are beautiful things\nwhich we all should do but don't just\nlimit your life to thinking I serve on\nthe weekends or I serve once a year you\ncan serve every month this podcast is a\ncertain no question right it's your\nservice because you're serving people by\ngiving them an alternative to just\nwatching some trash show but they're\nactually here learning from you and\nlearning from the people that you bring\non the show I've watched you to that\npoint this is a personal thing because\nI'm I'm such a believer that you're you\nmove the needle in the world\nthat you can help change Consciousness\nI'm in my little way people say in my\nsmall way I would love to think I'm a\nlike in that ocean that you see out\nthere like a drop of water and altering\nthe consciousness of the world just just\na skosh not me but who I can share with\npeople and my own messages and I believe\nyou're one of those people and so I will\ntell you as I've watched this meteoric\nrise of yours I've actually privately a\nfew times not every day but a few times\nI've actually prayed for you that you\nthat you would keep this level of\nhumility and so this is an interesting\nthing I wanted to ask you but it'll\nserve everybody else there is this\nbalance isn't there of wanting this book\nto do well\nright you don't want to sell two copies\nyou want it to do very well when you put\na video out\nthere's probably of this there's got to\nbe a little part of you that's like how\nwell did it do and I think that line\nright there I'm not even sure if you or\nI know the answer entirely but do you\nstruggle with that balance of I'm doing\nthis in the service of people\nyet I'm sensitive to the response of\nwhat I'm doing because I think someone\nlistens right now who's going to have a\npresent sales presentation tomorrow they\nwant to be in the service of that person\nbut there's this part of them that is in\nthat balance we've talked about earlier\nabout what's the response going to be\nhow am I going to be received I want\npeople to like me I want to how do you\nnavigate that that's a great question\nman that's huge and and the answer let's\ntake that sales person\nthe more time that person spends\nin empathy\ntheir customers pain\nand what the customer is really looking\nfor\nthe better they're going to be received\nyes\nso that service mindset always helps\nbecause if you're thinking about and\nthis is what it comes and I said this to\nmy team when we were writing the book\nand everything I was working on I said\nif I sit here right now and all I'm\nthinking about while I'm writing the\nbook is being a best-selling book then\nguess what I'm now not writing the book\nI'm now living in the future and I'm not\nliving in the present and so the only\nway to make this a best-selling book is\nto do the process properly and I don't\nthink and this is what I do and this is\nthe only thing that's helping me and\nagain I go through all the time after my\nfirst video went viral three four years\nago\nI stopped creating because of the\npressure that I wouldn't be able to live\nup to it wow so I actually got scared\nbecause I was like oh well what if the\nnext video doesn't do as well everyone's\ngonna think I'm tanking like you get\ninto that self-doubt and that self and I\ngot into that space where I was just\nthank you for being honest about it yeah\nno really like genuinely I didn't want\nto make a video again because I was like\nthis video just got 40 million views\nlike how am I ever gonna beat that right\nand you get scared because I'm not\nputting anything out I'm just gonna stop\nand then I started to realize I was like\nwell now I'm not living in service\nanymore I'm living out of ego and I'm\nliving for feeling a certain way and\nguess what I'm not feeling better by not\nputting anything out yeah and actually\nif I just serve more I'll learn more so\nthe way I've made sense of it and\nthere's a verse in the Gita that\nexplains it too is that you have full\ncontrol over the preparation the process\nand the practice but you have no control\nover the potential result but all of\nthose three things are the result in and\nof themselves yes and so if you get\naddicted to the process of writing the\npractice of connecting with the right\npeople who can help share your work and\nyeah like you said I am focused on the\nprocess of making sure that the most\npeople in the world have the opportunity\nto buy this book but then if they choose\nnot to buy it I can't control that but I\ncan control making sure that it's in\nfront of everyone and that I believe in\nthe context wow and that to me is not\nattachment that to me is not uh ego that\nto me is trying to live your best life I\nmean like you know if you didn't just\ntry if you're like I wrote this book but\nwho cares yes I mean that's not service\neither because the way I explain it and\nI'm not I'm not claiming that this is it\nand I'm not trying to say I'm it I'm\ntrying to say that I think we all feel\nthis way\nif you or me see an amazing movie we\nwant to tell everyone about it if you\nread an amazing book you want to tell\neveryone about it if you found the cure\nto cancer you tell everyone about it for\nme I got to live an incredible life\nthanks to these amazing teachers I met I\njust want to tell everyone about it like\nthat's all I'm doing yes but I want to\ntell everyone because of how powerful it\nwas brother that's the best description\nI've ever heard of there's this line\nI've always tried to teach of you want\nto have outcomes but yet you need to\nseparate from them yeah and that's a\ndifficult thing when people are trying\nto achieve different things that was\nperfectly stated\nabsolutely being addicted to the process\nof it but actually separating from what\nyou can't control I absolutely yeah\nabsolutely love it I'm just curious I\ngot a couple more questions tell us\nsomething about being a monk and living\nwith them that would surprise us okay\ngive me something about that so so we\nhad we had that's a good question so we\nhad snoring and non-snoring rooms\nso they try and be compassionate right\nso we would so I'm a non-snorer I don't\nsnore I sleep and my wife agrees now too\nshe validates that yeah so I'm in the\nnon-snar room but the snoring room we\nwould always joke around with the snores\nbecause we'd always joke about how they\nall sound like different motorcycles so\nwe'd be like oh that guy's like a Harley\nDavidson\nyeah\nbecause you're human and we're playful\nand you know it's almost like monk life\nkind of makes you more childlike not\nchildish but childlike because you start\nseeing things for what they truly are\nand you don't get caught up in stuff so\nyou can laugh at each other you can mess\naround another thing is um we had these\nsacred sweets or sacred uh items that\nare prepared and and offered and\neveryone gets to share them and you\ndon't eat a lot of sugar as monks and\nyou don't eat sweet stuff but these\nthese kind of natural sweetened items\ncame out like once a week and and some\nmonks would wrestle over them like you\nknow like basically like grapple over\nwho's gonna get those so these are the\nbehind the scenes I love that it's\nhumanizes yes the entire\namongst the normal people and let's be\nhonest like most people haven't been\nmonks their whole lives so it's not like\nyeah great Point yeah it's like I became\namong when I was 22 and I'm not now my\nfriends some of them became amongst the\n22s some of them became Monks at 30 like\nit's not like there are monks that\nbecome Monks at five that does exist but\nthe majority of people now are not doing\nthat they may even have more time in\ntheir life not one than they were one\nexactly exactly and so for me yeah I'm\nglad you asked me that question because\nyeah like monks are humorous they're\nfunny that like my teachers are\nhilarious if I'm with them I'll just\nlaugh the whole time really yeah because\nthey just see that and I'd love to\nintroduce you to one of my teachers who\ntravels here a lot I would love that I'd\nlove to introduce you to him actually\nhe's around 70 years old now he's been a\nmonk for 40 years and and he grew up in\nChicago so he's an American man but he\nlives in India it's been a month for\nfree he's unbelievable but he is\nhilarious oh my goodness and anytime I'm\nwith him I don't stop laughing so well\npresent people are more joyous in and of\nitself right 100 yeah exactly but you\nare you're not dealing yeah and you're\nnot dealing with that you're not dealing\nwith the baggage of the past right or\nthe anxiety ID of the future so when you\nare present you can just laugh you can\nbe joyous and be entertained and enjoy\nthe Bliss of the moment yeah dude I want\nto keep going so I just want to one more\nthing let's give him one more gift\nbecause you're a treasure bro and uh\nokay I I wanna I uh I want you to know\nthat I I want you and I to spend some\nmore time together I would love after\nmeeting you today I knew already but\nafter meeting you today you have\nyour energy in in person surpasses all\nexpectations thank you which is very\nlike I mean that like people listen this\ngoing boy can these guys I know it's not\nthe romance yes right\nso okay so someone would pay a lot of\nmoney to do this but I'm going to let\nhim do it for free for a second sure\nsomeone says I'm watching this and I've\nI really have this energy about me after\nlistening to this or watching this and I\nwant to change my life and maybe I don't\nhave super high self-esteem right now\nand\npotentially I lack a little bit of\ndirection or maybe I know what I want to\ndo but I don't know that I have the\nconfidence to get there if you just I\nwant to turn my life around I want to\nhave some of these emotions that it\nseems as if you experience on a pretty\nregular basis what advice or counsel\njust in general would you give somebody\nwho wants to live a better life yeah so\none of my biggest things first of all\nwould be that\nwe we do this wrong because we do either\nor we do them in the wrong order so in\nlife there are two aspects that impact\neverything our thinking and our actions\nand I read a quote the other day that\nwas saying that the mistake we make is\nthat we either Act without thinking or\nwe think without acting and I think\nthat's where most people are if you're\nfeeling stuck or you're like I'm not\nsure what I'm doing right now you're\neither doing too much thinking or you're\ndoing too much acting so you're just\ndoing a lot of stuff but you don't know\nwhy you're doing it or you're just\nsitting there procrastinating every day\nand you're doing it so I'd say it's it's\nboth so the first thing I would say to\nyou\nis take a moment and speak to three\ndifferent people speak to a family\nmember a friend and a colleague and ask\nthem this one question what strengths do\nI have what do you think is my\nsuperpower what skills do you think I\nbring emotional strong soft hard\nwhatever it is do that first get that\nsense check second thing for the next\nmonth take off every weekend eight days\nbecause there's eight Saturdays and\nSundays all together in a month and book\na different course Workshop seminar\nonline offline go to an event Shadow a\nfriend go and spend time with an aunt\nUncle who's doing the career you want go\nand have eight new experiences\nand after each of them sit with yourself\nand ask yourself\ndid I like that yes or no\nwhether you like to or not ask yourself\nwhy did I like it or why did I not like\nit and then ask yourself would I like to\ndo it again\nand if the answer is yes yes yes guess\nwhat go do it again and if the answer is\nno no no don't do it again leave it out\nbut if you've had eight and this is the\nproblem we do that over a year we do\nthat over eight years and that's why\nlife feels slow and boring and lethargic\nand stuck but it just in the next eight\ndays in a weekend just test eight new\nthings and you'll have just a great\nexperiment and the worst thing that will\nhappen is you'll find eight things that\nyou don't like but I guarantee you that\neven if you have a sense of that\nreflection in the beginning and and what\nI don't get why we don't do this enough\nis wow we do it with food and movies all\nthe time like you just\nEd is such a kind man like I got here\nslightly late because of traffic and\nthen he let me eat my lunch because I\nwanted to be full of energy I I need to\nfind out where that place is because\nit's local to here my my team got it\nordered for me it was amazing good and\nand it's like you know when you eat\nsomething whether you like it or not you\nknow when you watch a movie whether you\nlike it or not you know when you read a\nbook whether you like it or not but why\ndon't we ask ourselves after meeting\npeople completing projects or going to\nplaces most of us keep meeting people\nthat take our energy most of us keep\ngoing to places that drain us of our\nenergy and most of us keep working on\nprojects\nthat just disturb our energy\nall you have to do is ask yourself\ndoes this bring me alive why does it\nbring me alive really important to know\nwhy it works and do I want to do it\nagain wow deep insight there that that\nbrother what do you described right\nthere everyone is like the ultimate\npattern interrupt what he's saying is\nyou're going to do this over eight years\nor ten years if you can just do this in\nthe next eight weekends or the next four\nweekends eight days"
