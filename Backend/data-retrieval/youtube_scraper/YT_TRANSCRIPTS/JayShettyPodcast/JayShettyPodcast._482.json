    "transcript": "literally if you turn any packet around\neverything is canola oil palm oil and\npalm oil aside from all the\nenvironmental effects right yeah which\nare terrible although the fatty acid\nprofile is okay most of the commercially\nproduced canola oil is heavily\ncontaminated with agrochemicals and it's\nextracted with heat and solvents and\nthat denatures the oil and creates\ncarcinogenic products the best-selling\nauthor and host the number one Health\nand Wellness podcast on purpose with Jay\nShetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health

Dr Andrew Wilde a world\nrenowned leader and Pioneer in the field\nof Integrative Medicine combining a\nHarvard Education and a lifetime of prac\npracticing natural and preventive\nMedicine Dr Weil is

Wild's\ncurrent project include matcha.com\nbringing the world's best matcha to the\nWest I am so excited to welcome Dr\nAndrew wild Andrew thank you for being\nhere I'm delighted to be here very\nexcited to learn from you about a\nsubject matter that has so much as we\nwere talking about briefly before has no\nInsight bad Insight uh you know I feel\npeople are underserved in this space and\nso so let's dive straight in the first\nthing I wanted to ask you uh dive into\nyou with was this um was this thought\naround what are the diet and lifestyle\nhabits people need to do every day to\nlive longer healthier and prevent\ncognitive decline well you know that's\nfairly simple uh the the first rule of\nhealthy eating is to avoid refined\nprocessed and manufactured food you know\nthat that's what's doing Us in and I'm\none of the first people to have begun\ntalking about the importance of\ncontaining inappropriate inflammation\nand I have developed an\nanti-inflammatory diet based on the\nMediterranean diet but I added Asian\ninfluences to that because I spent a lot\nof time in Asia and there are things\nthere like mushrooms and turmeric and\ntea that I find very useful but we it\nreally looks there's more and more\nevidence that chronic low level\ninappropriate inflammation is the root\ncause of most of the serious diseases\nthat do people in prematurely so\ncontaining inflammation is very\nimportant and diet has a major influence\nthere but again the first step of an\nanti-inflammatory diet try to eliminate\nrefined processed and manufactured Foods\nin terms of other lifestyle practices\nbasic ones maintain physical activity\nthroughout life\nget good rest and sleep learn and\npractice some methods of neutralizing\nthe harmful effects of stress on the\nmind and the body\nmaintaining good relationships\nespecially spending time with people and\nwhose company you feel more positive I\nmean those are very simple steps\nas for cognitive decline this is of\ngreat concern to many people you know\nbecause we all know people who have\nexperienced cognitive decline we want to\navoid that so I think two very practical\npieces of advice one is don't get hit in\nthe head and that may mean you know\ntaking precautions if you're doing\nhazardous activities and being you know\nI don't recommend that people play for\nAmerican football for example and\nanother of us don't smoke because\nnicotine constricts blood vessels\nreduces blood flow to the brain so those\nare two two simple steps I think also I\nrecommend practices like doing word\npuzzles to keep your mind Active\nLearning another language you don't have\nto master the language just the attempt\nto learn it is very useful\nso so those are so those are some pieces\nof practical information yeah I think\nyou've given us a beautiful spectrum of\nthings to focus on there and I think I\ndefinitely in my life try and Tackle one\nof those areas every year oh great\nbecause I feel that they're so big in\nand of themselves and my biggest mistake\nin the past was when I tried to change\neverything everything all at the same\ntime you're trying to improve your\nrelationship you're trying to improve\nyour gut you're trying to improve your\nworkout regime and so I I love what\nyou're saying that there's all these\nthings and I would list everyone who's\nlistening and watching please try to\nchoose one thing that you're going to\ntry to deeply improve this year that you\nfeel is the one you're struggling with\nthe most that may be having the most\nnegative impact on you because you'll\nstart to see how they all affect each\nother yeah it doesn't have you don't\nhave to wait a year however I have a\nbook called eight weeks stop some health\nthere we go program each week you know\nyou do something like you start by\nwalking 10 minutes a day and each week\nyou add you know five min to that there\nwe go but I think you're quite right\nthat a big mistake that people make is\nto try to do Global change and then they\ngive up so I think it's best to take it\nin small bites yeah let's dive into some\nof those because I think they're easier\nsaid than done so what you just spoke\nabout with diet that's something that\nI've genuinely been focusing on probably\nfor the past 12 months in terms of not\neating any packaged foods and refined\nsugars and processed foods and so I'm\neating Only Natural Foods I'm I'm\nalready plant-based in my diet but\nmaking sure that I'm eating vegetables\nand trying to avoid anything that's out\nof a packet it's easier said than done\nit took a lot of time for me to kind of\nmove in that direction I had to find a\nmeal prep service I have an amazing wife\nwho's an incredible cook and Chef and so\nthat helps you know a million times over\nfor people that are trying to make\nsimple steps to changing specifically\ntheir diet to an anti-inflammatory diet\nwhat are certain simple steps people can\ntell me the eight week version almost\nwell well you know I in the in the book\nI said learn how to be friendly with\nbroccoli broccoli is a very easy\nvegetable to cook but most many people\novercook it and it's not very appetizing\nand it's a very simple way of cooking it\nfor about two minutes uh so it's bright\ngreen and crunchy put some olive oil on\nit garlic if you want but that's a\nwonderful Powerhouse vegetable with\ncancer protective effects add some\nberries to your diet because they're\nfull of antioxidants we talked about I\nmentioned tea I think tea is a very\nhealthful beverage it's one of the main\nsources of protective antioxidants I\nthink it's good to learn different types\nof tea and and how to add that find\nwhich ones you like what specific teas\nhave you found to have those benefits\nwell I'm a big fan of green tea because\nI've spent a lot of time in Japan and\nparticularly matcha green tea which I\nthink is you know it has the highest\nlevels of some of these protective\nelements in them but I think all tea is\nbeneficial when I was doing research on\nhealthy aging I made a number of trips\nto Okinawa which at the time they that I\nwas doing it had the highest\nconcentration of centenarians in the\nworld and one of the things that I\nobserved there was that in very hot\nweather people were drinking cold\nunsweetened turmeric tea delicious and\nuh you know in North America people are\nreally unfamiliar with turmeric except\nas a as it occurs in yellow mustard and\nand Curry\nbut this form of turmeric and Okinawa\nwas fermented and which makes it more\nbioavailable and tastier it dissolves\nvery quickly in cold water it's really\ndelicious so that's one that that I\nrecommend you know learning how to get\nmore turmeric into your diet it's the\nmost powerful anti-inflammatory agent\nnatural anti-inflammatory agent that we\nknow wow yeah turmeric's a big part of\nthe Indian diet so\nIndians eat it at every meal yes and you\nknow one of the uh interesting\ncorrelations in the I think rural India\nespecially has the lowest rate of\nAlzheimer's disease in the world and\nmany researchers think that's related to\nthe the regular consumption of turmeric\nbecause Alzheimer's begins as\ninflammation in the brain and there's\nsome animal research showing that\nturmeric can protect\nrats that are genetically programmed to\ndevelop Alzheimer's from developing it\nso I think turmeric is a very good thing\nto become friendly with that's that's\ngreat Insight I love that story of going\nto Okinawa I went to uh Sardinia a few\nyears ago ah well that's one of the\nhealthy Creations one of the blue zones\nyeah and what's interesting I want to\nhear what you saw there but the uh you\nknow if you go to these areas around the\nworld where there are unusual\nconcentrations of very healthy old\npeople women outnumber Men by a long\nshot you know when you get up in the\nrange of upper 90s hundreds it's almost\nall women sardini is the one exception\nyeah that their men and women are\nequally in those ranks of the oldest old\nand we don't know why yeah yeah I was\nreally fascinated to see the\nfew things and it's and it's all on the\nspectrum of things you mentioned but\nwhat was really interesting is that\ntheir workouts were natural of course it\nwas farming they were walking they were\ntaking care of the land same in Okinawa\nthey were hauling fishing nets and\ngardening I saw a I think 102 year old\nwoman who was hoeing the the Garden in\nfront of her house so they're not going\nto gyms they're not working with\ntrainers it's just daily activity yeah\nand then the other thing was that they\nwere eating Foods only in season so\neverything was picked locally everything\nwas uh locally grown or locally found\nand they weren't eating things that were\njust artificially available and what\nabout social connectedness I mean that\nwas a big part of it I mean people were\nliving in bigger families or living\nCloser by to families with children so\nchildren weren't just being raised by\ntwo people but by 10 people and every\nevening and even during the middle of\nthe day they would get together and I\nthink that's very important uh the\nMacArthur Foundation some years ago did\na study of successful aging they\nidentified a population\nof people they considered successful\nagers and then they looked to see what\nwere the the outstanding commonalities\nand the two that stood out and this\ndwarfed everything else whether they\ntook supplements whether they you know\ndietary patterns the two were\nmaintenance of physical activity\nthroughout life and maintenance of\nSocial and intellectual connectedness I\nwant to dive into two things that you\nmentioned earlier and I want to dive\ninto them deeply because I think again\nthey're buzzwords people know about them\nbut I'd like people to really understand\nthe benefits so let's talk about matcha\nbecause that's your favorite daily plant\nyeah an ally which you say has this\nincredible mind-body benefit I think it\nhas already seeped its way to mainstream\nyeah it's quite amazing but yeah I went\nto Japan when I was 17 and lived with\nfamilies uh one family outside of Tokyo\nand this was 1959 Japan was a very\ndifferent place and the second night\nthat I was there my host mother we had\nno language in common took me next door\nto her neighbor who practiced tea\nceremony so the three of us sat around\nand the neighbor did a tea ceremony and\npresented me with a bowl of matcha and\ntwo things about it totally caught my\nattention what was the color yeah you\nknow this vibrant green and the other\nwas the bamboo whisk that you used to\nwhisk the the matcha tea into a froth in\na bowl of water it's carved from a\nsingle piece of bamboo just a miracle of\nJapanese craftsmanship so I I fell in\nlove with matcha when I got back to the\nStates nobody knew anything about it or\never heard of it over the years when I\nwas go to Japan I'd bring matcha back\nand I turn people on to it I tried\nstarting in the 1980s i partnered with a\nJapanese company to try to sell it on my\nwebsite there was no market for it I did\nthat again in the 1990s anyway it's\nquite amazing now to see this you know\npenetrating our culture matcha is\nprepared in a very unique way the the\ntea plants are heavily shaded for three\nweeks before Harvest\na 90 shade cloth so it cuts out almost\nall sunlight\nin response to that the leaves get\nbigger and thinner and produce more\nchlorophyll trying to take advantage of\nwhat light is there and they also\nproduce more antioxidants and flavor\ncompounds and this amino acid l-theanine\nthat has a calming effect and moderates\nthe action of caffeine so for that\nreason matcha I think is is more\nhealthful than other forms of tea and\nalso you consume the whole Leaf not just\nan infusion of it so that's one that I'm\nquite enthusiastic about and I started\nthe company we got the URL matcha.com\nwhich was a great tool when did you get\nthat URL I'm fascinated did you have to\nbuy it recently or you've had no this\none yeah no it's like six or six or\nseven years we tracked it down it was\nowned by a Japanese man who had no idea\nwhat he had he had if he went to the\nsite he had pictures of his cats and my\nbusiness partner Andre fasciola managed\nto negotiate with him and we got it at a\nquite reasonable price people in Japan\nwe've got we've got that anyway we\nimport very high quality matcha and by\nthe way if you're if your listeners use\na discount code J we'll give them a very\ngenerous discount oh I love products\nthere you go there you go so I'm a big\nfan of matcha I'm delighted to see that\ngetting traction however a lot of the\nmatcha here is not very good because\nit's such a fine powder that unless it's\ncarefully protected it oxidizes very\nquickly loses its brilliant green color\nbecomes bitter and many people have\ntried much and say they don't like it\nbut they've never tasted good matcha so\nI as I said I think a lot of research\nhas been done on green tea in particular\nbut all tea has beneficial effects and\nfrankly you know I don't want to bash\ncoffee but I would love to see more of a\ntea culture develop here me too I'm a\nbig fan yeah I know yeah so coffee you\nknow the the stimulant effects of coffee\nand tea are very different coffee is\nmuch more dangling uh it it is much more\nassociated with truly addictive behavior\nthere's a real crash coming down from\ncoffee you don't see any of that with\ntea and some of it is because of this\nmodifying effect of of l-theanine but\nalso I find it interesting that the\nhistorically and culturally the\nassociations with coffee coffee was\nalways associated with kind of\nargumentative Behavior loud raucous\nGatherings of people political activism\nwhereas T the historical associations\nare much more with contemplation\nmeditation I think would be very\nbeneficial to see a greater tea culture\ndevelop in North America you know that\ncould work its way into some of the\nCoffee Culture that's now so dominant\nyeah when me and my wife launched our\nTea Company we said we wanted to make\ntea as hot as coffee like that was the\ngoal because yeah we we grew up with tea\nculture boats from our British and\nIndian Heritage sure yeah I found it so\ntherapeutic I I like you love the color\nI love the scent yeah I love the\nexperience of having to drink it slow\nyou don't really have tea on it exactly\nexactly there's a meditative exactly\nprocess with any healing property too\nyeah and it's a big change when I was\ngrowing up uh tea was what old people\nand sick people Drank in this country\nand it's wonderful to see that change\nnow yeah absolutely and the other one\nthat I wanted to ask you about was that\nthe green Mediterranean diet yes this is\ninteresting it's just recently been in\nthe news you know we have so much\nscientific evidence for the benefits of\nthe Mediterranean diet in terms of of\nlongevity overall lowest risks of\ndisease and I think most of your\nlisteners are familiar with the\nMediterranean diet you know it's heavily\non fruits and vegetables and whole\ngrains olive oils I mean cooking fat and\nmeat used very occasionally oily fish\nrelatively low in sugar so forth so\nrecently a green Mediterranean diet is\nproposed as being even healthier and\nthis reduces animal products even\nfurther\nincreases for fruits and vegetables\nespecially sources of a class of\ncompounds called polyphenols and these\nare antioxidant compounds that are found\nin plants and fruits vegetables\nespecially berries tea and dark\nchocolate so the meta the screen of\nterrain that I had specifically\nrecommended green tea to add and they\nnoted chocolate but they mentioned all\ntea so I think this is fascinating you\nknow to see and these are researchers\nreally you know not really trying to\npromote any agenda yeah has your work\nled to any of the research that I'm\nrecently seeing around like canola oil\npalm oil and the negative harmful\neffects versus well now I'm only eating\nin is avocado oil and olive oil yep uh\nas my product there's one other that you\nshould check out is algae oil if you\ndon't know okay I didn't yeah this is a\nnew product that's out there uh and it's\nit's made through uh culture it's called\ncultured oil and it's\nmicroorganisms that have been been\naltered in order to produce oil which is\nalmost all monounsaturated fat is has a\nvery high smoke point neutral taste and\nalso has one of the omega-3 fatty acids\nin it so that's another choice but those\nare the ones I use also avocado and\nOlive and what are some of the harmful\neffects of the canola palm oil that\nbecause they're pretty much literally if\nyou turn any packet around\neverything is canola oil palm oil and\npalm oil aside from all the\nenvironmental effects which are terrible\nthere are two kinds of palm oils there's\nan oil extracted from the fruit of the\noil palm which is red and is used in\nAfrica as a cooking oil and is okay but\nwe rarely see that and then there's the\noil extracted from the kernel and that\nis very high in in unstable unsaturated\nfatty acids that oxidize quickly it's\nalso very high in saturated fat uh so\nthat's not a good one canola oil\nis a you know the word means Canadian\nOil and it was developed by Canadian\nscientists uh I think in the 1920s or\n1930s from a traditional cooking oil\nthat you know in India rapeseed oil yes\nand that's another right and uh rape has\na toxic fatty acid in it possibly the\nCanadian scientist uh worked with it to\ndevelop one that was low in that in that\nfatty acid problems with canola oil\nalthough the fatty acid profile is okay\nmost of the commercially produced canola\noil is heavily contaminated with\nagrochemicals and it's extracted with\nheat and solvents and that denatures the\noil and creates carcinogenic products so\nit's one I would stay away from now I\nrecommend it in the past but I don't\nanymore I'm a big fan of olive oil yeah\nyeah absolutely yeah absolutely no\neveryone cook with olive oil by the way\nI've taught you know I I've worked with\na number of Indian patients\nyou know who were very uh convinced that\nghee Can Do no harm you know and it's\npure butter fat and it's probably not\nhealthy and the rates of cardiovascular\ndisease in India are pretty high and\nI've taught people to use ghee as a\nflavoring you know cook with a healthy\noil like avocado and then at the end you\ncan drizzle some ghee over to get the\nflavor you want yeah and I've also\nsuggested I had a a student a physician\nfrom Kerala uh where coconut you know or\nit's the land of coconuts and they use\nuh coconut oil and coconut full fat\ncoconut milk and I taught her to use\ncashew milk which is very easy to make\nand this much healthier fat than than\ncoconut it's monounsaturated not\nsaturated and The Taste is delicious wow\nthat's good to know about ghee because\nyeah it's it's one of those things that\nmy mom never wants me to miss right I\nknow but then I always hear this like\nyeah in between but I like I like the uh\nyeah use it as a flavoring yeah at the\nend yeah yeah I like the happy medium\nthe happy balance that makes should be\nhappy to hear about the turmeric that's\nlike and saffron's the other one she's\nlike never telling me to miss and that's\na good one yeah but the turmeric you\nknow our company also sells that\nfermented turmeric from Okinawa and\nwe'll send you some to try please it's\ndelicious that sounds amazing really\ngood it's fascinating you you mentioned\nearlier uh limiting the smoking of\ncigarettes and the negative effects of\nnicotine what about when it comes to\nmarijuana I think that you know\nmarijuana is such an interesting topic\nfor so many people today there's there\nare so many perspectives most of them\nout there are like positive but I'd love\nto know from your perspective how are\nyou seeing marijuana affect the brain\nhow are you seeing marijuana affect the\nactual first of all I'm gonna call it\nI'm gonna call it cannabis because the\nword marijuana has negative connotations\nso uh let's talk about cannabis yeah\nsure so I I did the first controlled\nhuman experiments with cannabis in 19\ngeez\n1964.\nuh it was the first time anyone had\ngiven that to human subjects in a\ncontrolled fashion to see what it did so\nit's a plant that I've been involved\nwith for some time and let me say you\nknow this is also a plan very well known\nin India it's you know native to uh the\nto Asia\num the word uh it's kind of the main\nspecies Cannabis sativa the sativa means\nuseful and cannabis is hemp it's the\nsame rudis canvas because canvas always\nused to be made from hemp fiber but it\ndid this is a very useful plant it\nprovides an edible seed and edible oil a\nfiber a medicine and an intoxicant\nthat's a lot of ways for one plant you\nknow to serve us and it really only\nwants to serve us and I think we have\nreally not been wise in the way we've\ndealt with that plan so in terms of the\nintoxicating properties of cannabis\num this is a it's a difficult subject to\ntalk about because the chemistry of that\nplant is so complex there's so many\ndifferent strains and there's so much\nvariation in individual reaction to it\nyou know there are people who can smoke\ncannabis before bed and have a great\nnight's sleep other people smoke before\nbed and they can't sleep the entire\nnight so there's that kind of disparity\nin reactions to it first of all that it\nis one of the least toxic drugs that we\nknow you can't kill people with it and\nyou can't say that about any drug that\nwe use in medicine and every drug has a\nlethal dose and in some cases the lethal\ndose is relatively close to the useful\ndose you can't calculate it lethal dose\nfor cannabis so on a physical level it's\nextremely safe I mean there's concerns\nabout smoking it and whether that's how\nharmful that may be for lungs you know\nthat goes back and forth I don't think\nit's a great idea to smoke anything you\nknow and Inhale Smoke into the lungs\nprobably not a good idea okay but\ncertainly not as I think not as toxic as\ntobacco and it doesn't have anything in\nit as addictive as nicotine which is one\nof the most addictive drugs that we know\nI I think the medical usefulness list of\ncannabis there's a lot of potential\nthere\nand I think this is a subject that's\nopen at the moment there's a lot of\nresearch on ways it can reduce muscle\nspasticity it can help people with\num you know all sorts of of\nneuromuscular problems with digestive\nproblems but again a lot of individual\nreaction to it\nwe're seeing this plant you know being\nmade available to people uh and it's\nit's I think it's about time it gets out\nof that restrictive drug schedule and\nmade available for therapeutic use I was\njust talking yesterday our Center does a\npodcast and I was interviewing a nurse\nwho is a who was a member of the\nAmerican cannabis Nurses Association I\ndidn't know there was such a thing but\nthere is a large group of nurses who\nhave now become trained in using\ncannabis Therapeutics in what form yeah\nthey use all different forms and they\nface that on the individual patient but\nI think they're in a much better\nposition to do this than Physicians\nbecause there's no cannabis preparation\nout there that most doctors are going to\nfeel comfortable using and until we have\nsomething like that I don't think\ndoctors are going to go near it they\ndon't understand it but it's great that\nnurses are using a lot of them are using\nit for pain control they're also using\nit in in the hospice situations\nespecially with people with terminal\ncancer and they say they find it very\nuseful so I think it's you know I'm\nhappy to see this becoming used I think\nthere's a lot we don't know about it and\nI find it very difficult when people ask\nmy advice about it I don't know what\npreparations to recommend to people uh\nyou know that it's confusing what's your\ntake on the more social use of it well I\nwas you know I was part of that culture\nin my 20s and 30s and uh you know it was\nit was it was it was fun back then you\nknow it was a fun social uh experience\nyou know and and then I also found that\nit was very\num stimulated my imagination creativity\nhelped me write but at some point that\nchanged and I it the my reactions to it\nchanged I became more introspective\nwithdrawn and then eventually it became\nan unproductive habit that just made me\ngroggy and it was hard for me to\nseparate myself from it so what was that\nyeah what do you think that was because\nI think that's that's such a interesting\nArc of a journey with it I think a lot\nof people feel that way that's kind of\nlike a knock I had a lot of friends who\ninitially started for those reasons and\nthen ended up paranoid who ended up\nconfused or ended up lethargic I don't\nknow maybe you know what maybe it has\nsomething to do with with changes as we\nage possible but it was such a striking\nchange in in the effects for me you know\nso something that I thought of as an\nally that was helping me really it\nceased being that yeah yeah okay that's\nthat's really interesting to know\nbecause yeah I feel I had a lot of\nfriends in the same bucket I never\nreally um\nI never really dabbled with it deeply\nbut but in in my brief experiences it\nwas fun very brief experiences it was\nfar more the creative or the spark but\nit I never got deep into it but my\nfriends who did they they went on the\nsame Arc so that's interesting and I\ndon't know that I have not seen anyone\nwrite about that or talk about that or\ninvestigate what the cause of that is\nyeah yeah also you know today uh the\npreparations of cannabis that are out\nthere are much much stronger than those\nthat right they were available when I\nwas using it way back you mean the ones\nthat are available from a Leisure\nperspective yeah everywhere well I'll\ntell you a story for a uh uh physician\ncolleague of mine in San Francisco sent\nme three preparations of cannabis that\nhad come from a medical dispensary and\nhe wanted me to try them and I was you\nknow I'm a little leery about that since\nI'm you know haven't used it in so long\none of them was a a kind of oil that was\nin a tube a little syringe and it came\nwith a very professionally printed\nbrochure uh and it was recommending it\nfor pain control especially and it's set\nto start with a A an amount the size of\na grain of rice and work up from there\nso I took a piece half the size of a\ngrain of rice and my friend that said\ntake it at bedtime it took it to bedtime\nwent to sleep woke up about an hour\nlater in full-blown delirium with\nhallucinations as Vivid as those I've\nhad from using LSD I couldn't move I had\nno equilibrium had burning thirst I\ncouldn't reach for a glass of water I\ncouldn't call for help and it kept\ncoming on stronger and stronger and I\nhad no idea when this was going to end\nand I had to use all the tricks that\nI've learned in meditation and breath\ncontrol to keep myself centered and when\nwhen it finally subsided about eight\nhours later my equilibrium was off for\ntwo days I had very bad bounds and I was\nreally angry I mean and this brochure\nsaid work up from there and I'm thinking\nthere are people out there you know\ntaking this I mean that was like a very\nvery powerful thing and I thought fairly\ndangerous what what brought you into\nthis so early on because we're at a\npoint in culture I feel where these\nthings are now coming to the Forefront I\nmean of course I'm probably sure you're\nseeing cycles of that you probably saw\nit come well if I was you know I uh I'm\njust starting uh work on a book about\npsychedelics and I'm a lot of it I'm\ntelling my own history because I knew\neveryone involved in all of that but my\ninterest goes back to about I think it\nwas I can a specific day in 1960 right\nbefore I went to Harvard and there was\nan article in the newspaper in\nPhiladelphia about the supposedly the\ndeath of a student at a California\nUniversity who was taking mescaline for\ninspiration for a creative writing\ncourse and that said mescaline was a\nvision-inducing drug I'd never heard of\nit and and they made the mistake of\nquoting from his last paper and I just\nremember this phrase galaxies of\nexploding colors when I read that I knew\nI wanted to ask one so I I inquired\nabout I came across Aldous huxley's book\nThe Doors of perception which had been\nwritten a few years before\num and uh when I got to Harvard I had\nthe very good fortune to become\nassociated with Richard Evans schultes\nwho was the director of the Harvard\nbotanical museum and he had been one of\nthe great explorers of the Amazon and\ndiscovered a lot of hallucinogenic\nplants down there so he really through\nhim I became very interested in in\npsychedelic plants at the same time\nRichard Alpert and Timothy Leary were\njust starting their work with psilocybin\nat Harvard\num there were you know these drugs were\nnot controlled substances then I was\nable to obtain mescaline from a\nchemistry Chemical Company I took it a\nnumber of times had interesting\nexperience but I was very disappointed I\ndidn't have Vision I didn't see Galaxy\nvery disappointed anyway so that was\nbefore I'd ever tried cannabis but\nas a result of of being in that place at\nthat time I really got to meet and come\nacross all of the people who worked in\nthat field with Albert Hoffman who was\nthe discoverer of LSD Gordon Wasson\nwho rediscovered the mushroom Cults in\nMexico\nSasha Shogun who invented many of the\ndesigner drugs so I had a long period of\nexperimentation with psychedelics and I\nyou know have had a lot of benefit from\nthem I don't I really don't use them\nanymore\num my first book The Natural mind which\nwas about the importance of Altered\nStates Of Consciousness\nokay yeah making sure they see it but\nAlan Watts wrote a blurb Fort and which\nhe said when you get the message you\nhang up the telephone and so I think I\ngot I got what I had to learn from\npsychedelics and I didn't feel the need\nto continue to use them but I've learned\na lot of things from them and a lot of\nthat has formed my philosophy of\nIntegrative Medicine especially the the\nvery subtle complex interactions of mind\nand body and I have seen very powerfully\nthat you can change external Reality by\nchanging internal reality let's dive in\ninside cadelics because that was also\nwhat really intrigued me and Drew me to\nyour work because again I feel like my\ngeneration Generations off to me they're\nstarting to hear these terms in\nmainstream culture a lot more often and\nyou know I feel like my role is to try\nand find the experts in this space to\nhelp everyone have as much information\nthey can have in order to make better\ndecisions for themselves their friends\ntheir family and and anyone that's there\nand so I'm going to ask questions that\nmay seem really simple and and basic but\nby Design because I want people so what\nare psychedelics for someone who keeps\nhearing that term from their friends and\nthey keep nodding along pretending to\nknow what that is what does it mean and\nand what what comes under that you know\nthe word it was a coined word which\nmeans mind manifesting previously people\nhad called these psychotomimetic drugs\nmeaning they mimic psychosis which is\nyou know a very negative term uh they\nare psychedelics are are\na a lot A large group of compounds many\nof which are found in plants there's one\nwe know from an animal Source many are\nsynthetic or semi-synthetic drugs they\nfall into two chemical families with\nvery distinctive molecular structures\nhere ketamine is not a psychedelic even\nthough many people call it that cannabis\nis not a psychedelic doesn't have any\nchemical resemblance to that\nMDMA is part of that chemical family\nrelated to masculine but its effects are\nnot typical of psychedelics it has a\nunique effect that makes people\nemotionally open I think it is a very\nuseful substance I guess I would call it\na psychedelic but it's not a classic\npsychedelic in terms of the perceptual\nchanges that it causes one fact about\nthese this group of compounds is they\nare strikingly non-toxic physically much\nas with with cannabis you know that's\njust not an issue physical toxicity the\nmain dangers are psychological and those\nare almost entirely results of set and\nsetting that is the expectation of the\nperson taking them and the physical\nenvironment in which they're taken so\nyou know to put it in a very crude way\nif you if you take a very high dose of\nLSD on a New York subway on a day when\nyou're feeling anxious you're likely to\nhave a bad trip on the other hand if you\ntake the right sort of dose in nature\nwhen you are prepared for the experience\nand in the company of people who have\nwho can guide you in the right direction\nthe chances are you can have a positive\nexperience\nthe penetration of psychedelics into\nmainstream culture at the moment is\nquite astonishing uh you know it before\nthe pandemic I was traveling a lot and\nspeaking in various places and no matter\nwhat subject I was talking about whether\nit was nutrition healthy aging\nIntegrative Medicine I would get\nquestions about psychedelics you know\nwhere can we get them how can we use\nthem how do you find somebody who can\nguide you you know a few months ago\nVogue magazine had a cover story on\npsilocybin Town and Country magazine of\nall places had an article titled why is\neverybody smoking toad Venom I mean this\nis it is really going mainstream in a\nbig way and it is absolutely absurd to\nhave these in federal schedule one which\nis defined as drugs that are have high\npotential for abuse and no therapeutic\npotential the therapeutic potential of\nthese drugs is enormous now you know\nthere is currently a lot of research\ndocumenting benefits in mental emotional\nconditions things like MDMA for PTSD and\nOCD psilocybin for drug resistant\ndepression for example and treatment of\nof addictions of various kind I mean\nthere's a long growing list of\nconditions for which clearly there are\ngood results obtain but beyond that I\nthink there is a tremendous potential of\nthese to cause Spiritual Awakening some\nof that has been documented at the Johns\nHopkins Center for psychedelics which is\nreally good I mean a single experience\nwith psilocybin and people who had no\nsense of a spiritual Dimension to life\nsuddenly or aware of that in my own you\nknow experimentation with them I I have\nhad very\nprofound realizations that my\nConsciousness extends to everything you\nknow that everything out there is\nconscious not just animate objects but\nrocks and everything and that that same\nwhatever that is it's in me it's in\neverything it connects me with\neverything I think having that\nrealization is one of the things that\nguided me in my philosophy of medicine\nand my methods of treating patients I\nthink it's also changed my attitude\ntoward nature\nand you know I I really the title of the\nbook I'm working on as psychedelics can\nsave the world and I really believe that\nand I think it may be the only thing out\nthere that has that possibility because\nyou know we are clearly headed for\ndisaster and I think the only thing that\ncan save us is a collective\ntransformation of Consciousness I think\nthat can result from enough individuals\nhaving a transformation of conscience\nthat it catalyzes some general movement\nI mean for instance if you just look at\nthe issue of of the climate disaster\nthat we're facing I think if people\nrealize that they are part of nature\nthat they're continuous with it they\nchange their behavior that's just that's\njust one example and I saw some research\nrecently showing that people who had had\nexperience with I think it was\npsilocybin particularly become tend to\nbecome involved with the environmental\nmovement so that is the great hope that\nI have so I'm I'm\nyou know I think this could go a million\ndifferent ways in terms of whether you\nknow for-profit businesses get involved\nwhether people are going to be using\nthese to party but I think it doesn't\nmatter I think just having these out\nthere in the in the general culture and\nfreed from that restrictive way that\nthey've been placed I think that holds\ngreat positive potential you like the\nidea of these things becoming more\nmainstream and accessible and available\nbecause they have so many positive\nbenefits but there's a part of you that\nunderstands or is accepting of the\ndangers that come in with self-diagnosis\nand self-use where it isn't being\nadministered in a healthy dose or a\nhealthy way what are some of the because\nlike the example you gave of getting on\nthe train like I look at that and I go\nyou know as these things become more\navailable\nhow do we stop people going off the edge\nbecause they don't know how to\nadminister and monitor and actually well\nI would say by training as many people\nas we can to be guides who who will\nbehave in an ethical fashion and are\nexperienced and can structure\na psychedelic experience and way to\nminimize any harmful potential and\nmaximize positive potential so there are\na number of groups around the country\nthat have training programs for\npsychedelic guides we need a lot more of\nthem uh and you know my hope is that\nwe'll start to see that yeah because I\ndo I do worry that\nI I love the benefits of of so many\nincredible sources out there I do worry\nthat when people are untrained in in\nanything that has that much power uh it\ncan be it can be worrying too because\nyou know you could have a whole world of\npeople who could be saved and supported\nbut in the wrong way could you know\ncould end up in a much worse place\npsychologically as you said uh because\nthere isn't that responsibility around\nit if that makes sense would you agree\nyeah yeah so uh that's my hope is that\nwe see you know some large numbers of\nresponsibly trained people who can guide\npeople in the right direction yeah I\njust wanted to clarify that with you\nbecause it's it's kind of how I feel\nabout technology right like if you look\nat technology technology is like a drug\nin one sense in the in the way the\nchemicals that are released when we use\nthem it's it could really be likened to\na drug obviously it's not been talked\nabout that way that's not the language\nwhere only seeing those experiences now\nand we're seeing the challenges with\ntechnology addiction we're seeing the\nchallenges with tech technology\nObsession and the things that come from\nit whether it's Envy comparison fear of\nmissing out anxiety insecurity uh and\nyou think oh wait a minute well if we\nhad technology coaches and if people\nwere trained in how to use technology\neffectively before we were given a phone\nchances are we'd be better at handling\nit and we wouldn't be doing this\nbackwards job that we're in right now\nwhich is like oh gosh like my kids are\nall attacked you know yeah I think we\nhave no idea what this is doing to the\nkids brains you know I think it\nobviously is changing them uh but I\ndon't think we know the full\nramifications of that yeah so it's\ndefinitely a concern and you're saying\nthere's enough Insight on the effects of\npsychedelics on the brain for us to kind\nof be able to see the right amount of\ndoses yes exactly yeah yeah right let's\ndive into some of the more popular ones\nand how they use because again we hear\nthese names a lot and I think people are\nunaware of like well what is that used\nfor how is it administered\num who does it help so you were\nmentioning that and MDMA could you tell\nus what is MDMA what how is it used\ncurrently yeah so MDMA is a synthetic\npsychedelic\num and it it resembles the structure of\nmasculine that family of groups does not\ncause many visual changes like you know\na lot of the classic psychedelics it is\na stimulant but it has a very reliable\nuniform effect in most people which is\nto produce a state of uh\nnon-defensiveness calmness positive\nemotional feeling emotional openness\nit's the name that's been proposed for\nit is an empathogen something that\ncreates empathy uh I've used it a lot\nand actually it was it was invented by\nmy friend Sasha Shogun and he sent me\nsome and I think somewhere around 1975\nand said what do you think of this and I\nsaid send more you know you know and\nI've seen many many people use it with\nvery very good result adults I think it\ncan be incredibly healing for\nrelationships I've seen some remarkable\nphysical changes in people with\ndisappearance of allergies and chronic\npain and there's quite a lot of research\non its usefulness in dealing with PTSD\nyou know sometimes one\nstructured MDMA session can eliminate\nthat after people have tried all sorts\nof psychotherapy talk therapy that\nhasn't produced results so I think it's\nvery like that's going to be the first\none that's going to be made\ntherapeutically available and probably\nfor the treatment of PTSD yeah and and\nthat's PTSD obviously is such an extreme\nexperience and so it sounds like how uh\nI guess what are people experiencing\nwhen they do it so it sounds like\nthey're more vulnerable they're more oh\nthey're more empathetic to themselves as\nwell I'd say it's I'd say it is a\nheart-centered experience you know what\nstrong feelings of loving connection\nwith others uh calmness relaxation uh\nand and a strikingly uniform effect from\nperson to person whereas the others you\nknow a lot of the others the classic\npsychedelics there's tremendous\nvariation in in response depending on\nset and setting MDMA is pretty uniform\nyeah and again you don't see this as\nsomething it sounds like this is not\nsomething you do for the rest of your\nlife this is a right a medicinal almost\nof like there's a certain thing to treat\nand work through you're working with the\npractitioners yes you may not have to\nuse it that many times right right but I\nthink that that that's one that we we\nreally should have access to and use I\nlived as a monk for three years in India\nI was in a monastery where we spent\nhours every day uh deep in meditation in\nreflection in the study of spiritual\nattacks and literatures and\nhad very strict diets and but we were\ntrained in the development of a lot of\nthese uh almost like the purification\nand the detoxing to get to compassion\nand empathetic States and so when you\nwere describing some of your experiences\nI was like I had that experience through\nmeditation of that connectedness with\nnature and with uh the universe and with\neach individual soul whether it be\nanimate or inanimate so I remember those\nthrough meditation and so our journey\nwas very slow uh very step by step a lot\nof pain and a lot of like a lot of\nobstacles to clear the way uh\nI I'm intrigued by how does someone feel\nafter the doses run its course like are\nthey able to stay compassionate and\nempathetic with their partner what\nhappens I'm intrigued yeah well the\neffect of the drug wears off and it's\nbecause it's a stimulant you feel\nthere's a period of time when you feel\ntired and someone depleted of energy but\nthe feelings you can you remain and you\ncan reconnect with those and I think I\nsee permanent change in people uh by the\nway in the in the early days when uh\npeople were talking about the spiritual\npotential of psychedelics it really\nangered a lot of spiritual teachers you\nknow who said that this was artificial\nthat these experiences and I think they\nwere kind of resentful of people having\nthem without going through the time and\nwork that like you put in uh so I you\nknow I think there are many valid paths\nto achieve those kinds of of feelings\nbut psychedelics are fast and they offer\nthe possibility of giving many more\npeople access to them yeah I've seen in\nin my personal experience with the right\npeople around me and with people I know\nthat have experienced them I found them\nto be great window openers for people or\ndoor openers it's kind of what you\ndescribed like this idea that you got to\nhave a glimpse into a new reality that\nyou didn't know existed but but\nI think I'm always intrigued by how\npeople have that versus it becomes\naddictive where you're just constantly\nwanting to live in that new reality but\nI think psychedelics have a kind of\nself-protective quality to them which is\nif you try to take them frequently The\nExperience disappears right uh so I\nthink people quickly there's not a lot\nof motivation to use them with any sort\nof great frequency yeah got it and in\nterms of carryover effects I've told\nthis story a lot and you may have heard\nit but just as an example\num and this is on a physical level I had\na lifelong allergy to cats uh if a cat\ngot near me my eyes would itch if a cat\nlicked me I'd get hives where it licked\nme so I always avoided them and one day\nwhen I was 28 I was I was living in the\ncountry in Virginia it was a beautiful\nspring day I took LSD with a group of\nfriends Outdoors it was just I felt\nwonderful I mean I really felt\njust High connected with nature terrific\nand in the midst of this a cat jumped\ninto my lap and I had an immediate\ndefensive reaction and then I thought\nyou know this is silly and I just\nrelaxed and played with the cat I had no\nallergic reaction and I've never had one\nsince no instantaneous disappearance of\na lifelong allergic pattern is that a\ncommon path with that particular with\nLSD or no no I think it's not not\npeculiar to LSD I think it can happen\nwith any psychedelic right it doesn't\nhappen automatically necessarily yeah\nbut I could imagine you know Dr Weil's\nallergy clinic if these become available\nyeah you know where you give people\nstart with a full dose and expose them\nthe allergen and then like once a week\nyou'd reduce the dose till at some point\nthey were getting just a placebo yeah I\nthink you can allergies can be unlearned\nand that's a powerful tool for doing it\nyeah what it what are the other ones\nthat you think uh going to become more\naccessible\nso this is the main compound found in\nthe magic mushrooms which traditionally\nwere used by indigenous peoples in\nsouthern Mexico and Central America\nthere are many species of them some can\neasily be cultivated some grow wild\nespecially in the Pacific Northwest\nit's a very well-known compound now and\nit is being intensively studied and used\nand especially for mental health\nconditions for drug resistant depression\nfor obsessive-compulsive disorder for\nAddictive disorders it looks quite safe\nyou know it is what's quite safe well\nagain no physical issues with it at all\nno cognitive no nothing and in fact you\nknow there have been studies of people\nwho've used these compounds quite\nfrequently over a long Lifetime and\nthere's been studies of their brains and\nthey look perfectly healthy so I don't\nthink there's any issues there so this\nis one that that I think\nalso is going to be made therapeutically\navailable fairly specifically for for\nmental health conditions first but I\nthink it again one that has a lot of\npotential uses in medicine as well so\nthat you know the main difference\nbetween psilocybin and LSD is duration\nof action\nLSD lasts 10 to 12 hours which can be\ninconvenient and psilocybin is four to\nsix hours so that's much more much more\nmanageable and some people are using it\nrecreationally too and yeah they are\nyeah well again I'm not going to be\ncritical of people no no I think not\neither I'm just trying to yeah I think\nI'd rather have people use that than\nalcohol recreationally because yeah\nthat's because it's much safer on a\nphysical level and I'd probably safer on\na psychological level as well when you\nlook at the numbers of homicides\naccidental deaths that are related to\nalcohol it's tremendous you don't see\nanything like that with psilocybin can\nyou drive after well I you can I\nwouldn't recommend it probably but if\nsomebody's familiar with it you\ncertainly can I mean it doesn't impair\ncoordination on a physical level like\nalcohol does yeah yeah no no and I don't\nhave any side or any uh what's the right\nword any any Doug in the fight\nyeah I'm asking from I'm just being so\ncurious as to like yeah I know my\ncommunity would ask these questions and\nI'm thinking all right like I want I\nwant them to have such a real genuine\nunderstanding of of what this is because\nso let me talk about another compound\nthat is of great interest is DMT yes of\ncourse dimethyltryptamine so this is a\nit's a very simple chemical compound\nand it's related to serotonin the\nneurotransmitter and melatonin the\npineal hormone it's found in many plants\nespecially in South America and is used\nby indigenous people mostly as snuffs\nthey prepare powdered preparations from\nplants and inhale it and often this\noccurs with another compound called\n5-methoxy DMT which is the one that's\nfound in the toad that has been popped\nVenom at any rate DMT is if you smoke it\nuh it's a it's a very rapid effect you\nknow within seconds you are\noften another reality and it's extremely\nvisual you know incredible visual trips\nand then you after several minutes you\ncome back to ordinary reality the five\nmethoxy version is not visual people\ndescribe it as a rocket ship into the\nvoid your ego dissolves and when it\nreconstitutes it's very pleasant it is\nvery likely that DMT is our endogenous\npsychedelic that is made by the pineal\ngland and it may explain why\nsome people have psychedelic-like\nexperiences whether it's from meditation\nor fasting or other things it may be\nfrom release of endogenous DMT and and\nsome people think this may also mediate\nthe near-death experience you know that\nso many people report so I I do believe\nwe have an endogenous psychedelic and\nit's very likely to be you know DMT wow\nyeah and I we were talking about this\nearlier and I I love hearing about your\ntravels have you have you been to the\nAmazon yes yeah you know Schulte sent me\ndown there long ago I made a number of\ntrips I was investigating medicinal\nplants uh Ayahuasca mushrooms\nand work spend time with shamans to\nlearn what tricks I could learn from\nthem so yes so that was that was in the\n1970s 1980s I made a number of trips\ndown there wow and and why do the\namazonians have no problems with taking\ndrugs like DMT well this is an\ninteresting thing you know there are\nthere are so many uh psychedelic plants\nand preparations in South America\nAmerica and in in Mexico and Central\nAmerica and there are so few in the old\nworld you know there's one plant in\nAfrica called eboga the source of a drug\ncalled ibogaine which is using that yeah\nfor Addictive Behavior this is what's\nright there's a possibility of one from\nuh from Indian or there's been great\nspeculation as to what this preparation\nSoma was that's referred to in The Vedas\nso there's possibly there was some\npsychedelic preparation there and the uh\nthe ellessinian mysteries in ancient\nGreece involve drinking a potion that\nalmost certainly was made from ergot and\nit was a way of detoxifying that fungus\nand producing an LSD like drink but\notherwise you know you've got this huge\nabundance of psychedelic preparations in\nthe new world you know it doesn't make\nBotanical sense that there'd be that\ndisparity so it must be something about\nthe people you know in the old world in\nin African Asia people I think are as\ndrawn to Altered States Of Consciousness\nbut they get into them especially in\nAfrica through drumming\nprolonged wakefulness dancing rather\nthan taking substances yeah yeah so is\nthat the difference that you see in how\nwe take them and how how they take them\nand yeah absolutely right but in if you\nlook at the indigenous peoples in South\nAmerica and the Amazon especially the\nthese they are always used ritually uh\nthey're often you know under the\ndirection of shamans who are sacred\ntrained in their use yeah absolutely\num and uh you know I think their the\npotential for abuse in those populations\nis very minuscule right yeah that's\nreally fascinating yeah I feel like yeah\nit was always sacred it was part of a\nholy ritual of some kind it was always\nused medicinally and understood and it's\nkind of yeah it's rituals are very\npowerful tool for containing the harmful\npotential of substances yeah that's why\nthey were created in around those I\nguess yeah no that's and that's always\nreally interesting for me to hear\nbecause I feel like yeah there's a\nthere's a and I'm just reflecting on it\nas an individual I look at it and I\nthink I really trust things that can are\nvery focused on the intention in which\nthey're taken uh administered by someone\nwho understands what the power and\neffect of this is and it's in an\nenvironment that allows you to have a uh\nfulfilling powerful experience with a\ncertain goal or or place to reach to uh\nthat all of those things to me feel very\ncoherent uh with how I would do anything\nwhether it's getting an operation or you\nknow like I got an operation last year\nand I wish I did more research on the\ndoctor you know I felt the same way\nabout that I was like you know we\nblindly trust the doctor you got placed\nwith and someone told you that they were\ngreat and I wasn't happy with the doctor\nI had at all and so you know it's it it\napplies to all parts of our life I think\nthis idea of like am I intentional with\nthe doctor I chose the hospital I chose\nthe am I am I being thoughtful about\nthese things and in the same way I don't\nthink it's different I think it almost\nhas to be thought about in the same way\nif that you know even with uh alcohol\nthere's some very interesting lessons\nfrom history please when uh distilled\nalcohol became available and it was a\nsudden invention of the Dutch you know\nso it was in the 1600s uh in the wake of\nthat there was an epidemic of\ndrunkenness\nalcoholism unlike anything that we've\never seen wow and even in this country\nin America in the early 1800s 17 1800s\nevery store had a barrel of whiskey and\npeople went in you just have a ladle of\nwhiskey and people started drinking\nearly in the morning all day long drunks\nwere lying in the street you know it was\nit was an uncontrollable epidemic of\nalcoholism and gradually you know over\nseveral decades there was a social\nconsensus that grew up that it was\nunseemly to be drunk and that you know\nrituals grew up around the use of\ndistilled alcohol one of which is the\ncocktail party you know which is not\ngoing to happen at 10 in the morning you\nknow we're going to do this late in the\nday there'll be food present and Friends\npresidents for social as a social\nlubricant and that kind of conscious use\nand and ritual helped contain the\nnegative possibilities that could result\nfrom such a strong drug right right and\nand of course I mean with alcohol\nthere's so many proven negatives right\nand issues yeah even now whether it's\ngut brain\netc etc could you talk about some of\nthose just so that we well alcohol you\nknow it is extremely toxic to the nerve\nto the brain and to the liver uh and\nthere's a there's arguments go back and\nforth yeah that's all whether or alcohol\na moderate consumption of alcohol is\nbeneficial you know some people say no\neven one or two drinks is harmful for so\nthis goes back and forth I think many of\nthe the benefits ascribed to alcohol are\nbenefits of relaxation and for many\npeople that is a main method of\nrelaxation yeah but I think the fact is\nthat you know it is a strong toxin then\nyou have to be very careful about using\nit and there's some people\nlike women that have genetic risk for\nbreast cancer probably shouldn't use it\nat all right yeah I was uh this\nfascinated me when I was looking at your\nwork your book Chocolate to Morphine who\nis pivotal and often the most stolen\nbooks in colleges in the last 40 years\ncan you tell us a bit about the book\nyeah it's a very good book it's it's\nstill in print and the main point of it\nwhich enraged some people was that there\nare no good and bad drugs they're just\ngood and bad relationships with drugs\nand I very firmly believe that I mean\nthere's no there are no drugs that have\ninherent good or horrible qualities it's\nhow people use them and how they think\nof them yeah some obviously are more\ndifficult to form good relationships\nwith than others and some of them\nnaturally like chocolate as as a victim\nof chocolate uh have addictive traits\nlike you know it's it's I I was I've\ntalked about this many many times but I\nwas genuinely addicted to chocolate and\nit took my wife and me like you know\nwhen I say addicted in the sense of like\nI could eat like a full slab in a moment\nlike a family pack version like easily\non my own no issues I see and uh it took\na long time for me to take chocolate out\nof my diet because the amount of sugar I\nwas taking into it so well I I put\nchocolate at the very top of my\nanti-inflammatory diet pyramid how big\nbecause it's a it's taking it out no I\nput it back it's there it's the very top\nof the anti-inflammatory diet pyramid so\nsomething that I recommend in moderate\nmoderate consumption it has very useful\nantioxidant\nyeah yeah but a little bit on a regular\nbasis is fine yeah what's a little bit\non a regular basis not not a slab not a\nslab\nyou have this real love for for this\nplant medicine that can have such a big\nbenefit on people and and it must be\nhard because so much of it's been\ndemonized or or talked about in a\ncertain way and and I love what you just\nsaid now it's like you're arguing that\nit's about your relationship absolutely\nright and that's really fascinates me\nbecause I I feel like that it's almost\nlike that's how we would talk about it's\nour relationship with technology it's\nour relationship with money yeah there's\nnothing in Fame there is nothing\ninherently evil about technology you\nknow it's I think that's true of so many\nthings it's it's how we relate to it and\nthis is how we use it our relationship\nis with it yeah that's that's really\nfascinating I always wanted to dive into\nthe idea of what you mentioned earlier\naround the spiritual awakening piece\nbecause I I definitely am not I I'm I'm\nI would say even though I studied in\nsuch a traditional and rigorous way\npersonally which has led to so many\nbeautiful spiritual Awakenings and\nrealizations I'm very not I wouldn't\nconsider myself to be closed-minded as\nto how other people find their parts I I\nfind that I have my path and it was\nbeautiful but I'm very open to people\nfinding their parts and some people are\nat different stages in their Journey\nwhere they need different things could\nyou walk me through what specifically be\nused been used in a spiritual way and\nwhat have been some of the results well\nfirst of all let me say for me uh\nspirituality means being aware of and\nacknowledging the non-material aspect of\nexistence yes working in the medical\nfield I am so aware of and frustrated by\nthe power of the materialistic Paradigm\nyou know that many scientists and many\nPhysicians don't believe in anything\nthat's not physical so when you try to\ntalk about not let alone not Spirit but\neven if you try to talk about the mind\nand the influence of the mind on the\nbody they don't believe that I mean in\nthe materialistic Paradigm If You\nobserve a change in a physical system\nthe cause has to be physical\nnon-physical causation of physical\nevents is not allowed for in that\nParadigm so this is what you know\nthere's a whole range of mind-body\ninterventions that we make use of\nIntegrative Medicine hypnosis guided\nimagery visualization therapy but and\nthese methods are very cost effective\nvery effective and they're totally\nunderutilized because people don't\nbelieve in it and and that's why we\nhaven't really made sense of the placebo\nresponse you know all of that so I would\nlove to see that change know I'd really\nlove to see a paradigm shift and to me\nthat's for what Spiritual Awakening is\nabout you know it's becoming aware of\nthe non-physical Dimension and the\nreality of the non-physical and I make a\nvery sharp distinction between\nspirituality and religion you know\nreligion is about institutions and\ninstitutions are mostly concerned with\nperpetuating themselves you know\nspirituality is is this connection with\nacknowledging the non-physical and its\nimportance in interacting with the\nphysical Dimension I think there's lots\nof ways you can awaken to that I I said\nyou know for me and for many people I've\nseen psychedelic experience be become a\nvery powerful way of doing that yeah and\nhow does how have you and others sustain\nthat like you were saying yourself like\nyou you don't take them anymore but it's\nbecome a way of life for you it feels\nlike that yeah I meditate I do breath\nwork and you know I've always I've been\nfascinated by the fact that the words\nbreath and the word Spirit are the same\nin most in the European languages and\nthat I think when we when we focus our\nattention on our breath we're looking at\nthe movement of spirit in the body uh so\nthat's you know I think that is one very\npractical powerful way and most people\nignore it we have that right under our\nnoses and we don't make use of it I mean\nyou know for you to have been at Harvard\nto have done this research to have been\nin this space for so long it is\nbeautiful to hear you bring science and\nspirituality together yeah because I\nfeel for so long they've been seen as\nopposite opposite yeah and I've never\nunderstood that right as as considering\nmyself a spiritual scientist or a you\nknow it's in that sense of I've always\nbeen fascinated by Neuroscience I've\nalways been fascinated by the brain and\nat the same time I consider myself a\nspiritualist and so hearing you as like\na doctor doing all of its medical work\nbut then finding the spiritual part and\nthe functional part of certain parts of\nmedicine did you always have that when\nyou were studying because obviously you\nwent off to become a doctor like when\ndid I think I I think I did always have\nsomething I don't know I think I was\nborn with it right you know I can\nremember always being fascinated by the\nmind and and how it related to the body\nand from as far back as I can remember\nand I tried to study that at Harvard and\nI was very frustrated that I couldn't\nyou know I I started off majoring in\nPsychology but at that time psychology\nat Harvard was completely dominated by\nthe behaviorist it was running rats\nthrough mazes and they weren't\ninterested in Consciousness I wanted to\nknow about Consciousness wow and nobody\nwas interested in doing that and then\nalso in the scientific and medical world\nConsciousness is seen as a product of\nbrain chemistry or electrical\nconnections in the brain and you know I\ncame to feel that Consciousness is\nprimary I think Consciousness organizes\nmatter you know I think it organizes\nmatter into more and more complex forms\nyou know including the human brain but\nthat you know that enrages scientists\nwhen I try to talk that one do you think\nwe'll ever be able to prove the\nexistence of Consciousness yeah this in\na way that in a language in a way that I\nthink this is what I see is part of the\nPsychedelic Awakening because I think\nthat that this really has the potential\nto to chip away at that materialistic\nParadigm and the influence it now has on\nour way of thinking there is you know a\nname for uh this idea that Consciousness\nis primary it's called pan psychism and\nthat used to be you know no scientist\nwould you know look at that and now\nthat's become a respectable movement in\nphilosophy new idea that everything is\nconsciousness down to atoms and uh and I\nI look forward to seeing that grow and\nhave greater and greater influence yeah\nyeah absolutely yeah I've always\nconsidered Consciousness to be like the\nfirst self yeah absolutely yeah and and\nyou know obviously from a spiritual\nperspective but even the excellent\nexplanation behind so many near-death\nexperiences or outer body experiences or\nof of the sort and when I have read\nscientific studies or even research or\naccounts of those experiences there's a\nthere's a truth that's not been\nuncovered yet absolutely and as I said\nthis may be mediated by release of our\nown endogenous psychedelic which could\nvery well be DMT right right amazing uh\nwhat a faster what a fascinating\nDirection I'm excited for your book and\nI'm excited for the work uh Andrew is\nthere anything that we haven't touched\non that that was that was a pretty\nwide-ranging conversation there's lots\nmore I could talk about but yeah you\nknow I well I'm hoping this is gonna be\nthe first of many that would be great I\nthink this is a great conversation for\npeople to I mean I'm sure everyone\nalready knows about your work but for\nnew people to get introduced to your\nwork uh for people to really get a sense\nof who you are and you know your your\njourney and parts of your story and your\nexpertise and I'm hoping that we'll\ncontinue to go deeper and the books come\nout because this is this has honestly\nbeen one of those um it's been exactly\nwhat I wanted I I needed the the dummies\nguide uh and and that's really helpful\nbecause I think so often that steps like\nmissed I know and then the majority of\nthe world just doesn't know what's going\non and so I
