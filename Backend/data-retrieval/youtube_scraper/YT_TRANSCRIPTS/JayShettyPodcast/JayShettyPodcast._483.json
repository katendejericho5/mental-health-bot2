we've been friends for a while\ntoo so it kind of feels like sitting\nwith two close friends here having a\nconversation I was gonna say that I feel\nlike Raquel I met you\nvery early on when I moved to LA like\nprobably within the first six months I\nthink yep we met through our friend\nElena absolutely love Selena had dinner\nwith you and Roddy and Elena and I\nremember her texting me after being like\nyou're gonna love Jay and Roddy they're\nthe best and and so and we've been\nhanging out ever since there's so many\nwonderful people oh you've been nothing\nbut Sunshine uh in our life and and\nyou're one of those people that I always\ntalk about it's like there's very few\npeople I meet that are just genuine and\nwant genuine things for everyone in\ntheir life and one genuine people to\nconnect and then Tanya we met very\nrecently actually much more but we were\nmessaging for many years on like yeah\nDMS and like all of this I've been a fan\nof yours like I consume everything Jay\nShetty I just find you to be very\ninspirational aspirational role model\nand so I just I love you in general and\nthen I remember Raquel was like our\nCommon Thread and so we met very\nrecently yeah but I met your wife first\noh no way yeah yeah\nat a dinner that we had when was that\nthat was a while ago yeah it was\n2021. yeah okay yeah yeah a couple of\nyears but anyway I'm so excited because\nyou're both finally here uh both people\nthat I do believe bring a lot of\nsunshine into the world so the book is\nvery apt uh but I want to ask you so\nmany different questions today I want to\nlearn more about your friendship I want\nto learn about both of you uh and I I'm\nsure this chemistry is like amazing and\nyou you know which questions you want to\nanswer but I want to start with both of\nyou and say what makes a day a great day\nfor both of you that's a really great\nquestion I try to make every day a great\nday and I'm not saying that in a way of\nlike oh I just wake up happy every\nsingle day I think sometimes it's a\nchoice and so the things that make me\nmost happy are my friends and my family\nand the people that I do day-to-day life\nwith so naturally every day is a good\nday when I'm in communication with those\npeople and then also you know all of the\nwork that I do is committed to making a\ndifference and to helping people and so\nI feel like I'm living my life on\npurpose and to me that's a great day\nit's being in community with people it's\nchoosing to see the good even when times\nare a little bit hard and\num having fun as well yeah I love that\nTanya I'd say mine's similar in the\nsense that it's really just being at\npeace and being happy and for me a lot\nthat I put in the book tour like these\nlittle nuances that I do\num you know like we can get very into\nthe mundane of our you know the routine\nof Our Lives and I think it's like\nfinding joy and those like little things\nso in the morning you know I wake up\nbefore the sun and\num but when I walk into the studio every\nmorning I flicker the lights on and off\nand I say good morning\nI'm like literally bringing the sun in\nsometimes it could be a little annoying\nbut like I think it brings everybody's\nsmiles and it just kind of brings like a\nlevity and so I think to me just kind of\nbeing happy and at peace every day is\nyou know I don't I'm not a master at it\nI can kind of get overwhelmed and I\nthink your baby a master at it I'm\ntrying to be I have my moments and\nthat's when I like turn to Raquel and\nI'm like I have a lot going on help me\nand she'll usually send a scripture and\nI'm like okay thank you and and I love\nwhat you've done with this book and I\njust want to show it to everyone who's\nlistening or watching wherever you are\nin the world uh how this book is\nstructured because it's rare that two\nfriends to come together to write a book\ntogether yeah that doesn't happen very\noften I've interviewed so many authors\nover my years of interviewing and you\ndon't really see that but the way this\nbook is structured I just want to show\neveryone because I've been reading it\nthis week uh you get these beautiful\nscripture pieces here which are these\nfavorite verses I imagine yeah of both\nof yours but then you also get sections\num that are dedicated to whether did\neverything by Raquel or Tanya and so\nyou're getting two perspectives on so\nmany phenomenal phenomenal topics which\nI think is actually really rare when you\nread a book you're so used to getting\none person's Viewpoint or one person's\nresearch\nwhen it comes to you to writing this\nbook together\nI've already asked you about a good day\nwhat is a bad day look like for both of\nyou and how do you navigate those\nbecause we're writing a book called a\nsunshine mind but there's some cloudy\ndays in all of our lives and you talk\nabout a lot of that in the book so what\ndoes a bad day look like and how do you\nnavigate those you know what's\ninteresting is why I say that this book\nis such a reflection of our friendship\nbecause whenever I was having a bad day\nor I was going through something\nheartbreak or you know you don't get\nthat that career that job that you were\nreally wanting and working hard for\nRaquel is somebody that I would always\nturn to in those moments and she's that\nfriend that was she always met me where\nI was she had a scripture ready to like\nturn it around for me and so when in the\nearly phases when I was thinking about\nthis book Because I had written a\ndifferent book proposal it was like a\ndating book and it was you know when it\nwas just on The Cutting Room floor it\ndidn't end up going anywhere\num so I wanted to do a devotional and I\nwas like Raquel's the perfect person to\nto do this with because this is exactly\nlike what she is as a friend to me I go\nto her she shares wisdom she's there for\nme and so it was kind of a really nice\nyeah that's something Tanya's really\ngreat at on a bad day you do reach out\nyou do say hey I'm struggling and can\nyou pray for me or can you encourage me\nI'm having a hard time and I think\nsometimes it's hard to be vulnerable\nit's hard to say hey I'm having a bad\nday we want to pretend like everything's\nokay and you really do embody that um\nfor me if I'm having a bad day I do the\nsame thing I'll call a trusted friend um\nTanya or my friend Ashley cook is really\nsolid and great that way too you know\nAshley\num and then I also on my own I'll go\nvery grateful to live in LA I'll go and\nI'll drive down to the beach and I'll\nI'll take a long walk and I'll listen to\nmy music or meditations and just\nit might sound kind of simple and you\ncan do this actually wherever you're\nlistening you don't have to go to the\nbeach you can go for a neighborhood walk\nbut I find being in nature and just\ntaking time to be alone and be still and\nlet the Spirit come in and and bring me\npeace it works every single time and I'm\nnot just saying that it really does and\nso I think taking that time to be alone\nand really asking the spirit hey I'm\nstruggling today today's a tough one\nplease give me peace you can be that\nsimple and it works every time I don't\nshy away from the bad days too like I've\ncried multiple times on the air I have\ncried on Instagram\nlike I don't want people to think you\nknow that I'm just I'm always happy and\nthat like you know like I have moments\nand I cry and like can I say something\nabout Tanya too is she early on in her\ncareer she faced a lot with you know\ndifferent people saying you're to this\nyou're too that you're too positive\nyou're too not you're never gonna make\nit in this in this business yeah and\nyour personality is too much yeah and I\nhave watched her stay so uh true to who\nshe is she's never back down she she\nstayed positive she stayed bubbly she's\nyou know chosen to take the high road\nover and over again and her career has\njust grown and grown and grown and she's\nnever changed she's grown but she's\nnever changed she's always stayed true\nto her and I think that that is\nincredible thank you oh it's so\nbeautiful I love seeing a good\nfriendship because I think that in a\nworld uh where everyone's looking for a\npartner uh and someone to date it's\nalmost like friendships often get\ndevalued or oh yeah become less\nimportant or we find that when someone\nfinds the one or the person they want to\nbe with all of a sudden they don't talk\nto their friends anymore only when\nthey're heartbroken to come back to\ntheir friends to mend their you know\nhealing heart and so I love seeing good\nfriendships I have a lot of great male\nfriends in my life as well that I turn\nto that that are part of my support\nstructure what do you think Tanya it is\nabout your friendship with Raquel that\nmade you in those instances reach out to\nher like what is it because I think what\nyou just raised there Raquel is we\nstruggle with reaching out we struggle\nwith asking for help we struggle with\ncalling someone up and saying I'm having\na bad day like that is a very vulnerable\nchallenging thing for a lot of us to do\nand a lot of us will wait months maybe\neven years before we open up to our\nfriend and say this is what I've been\ngoing through so what was it about your\nfriendship that gave you a sense of\ntrust in Raquel and what can we learn\nfrom that and what can people listening\ntake away from that when they're\nstruggling to figure out who of my\nfriends should I tell them what can I\ntell them yeah I do think that trust is\nbuilt over time so I think I was able to\nkind of see over time that she was a\nvery trustworthy person I know if I\nwhatever I told her and also like I'm in\nin an industry that I need to keep\nthings to myself but I always knew that\nI could tell her and it was like a vault\nand that was she just proven time and\ntime again that I can trust her but\nsomething that is very unique to Raquel\nthat I don't think and I I'm not as good\nas it as good as she is but when you\ncome to her for something she doesn't\ngive you her opinion she listens to you\nshe doesn't judge you she doesn't you\nknow what I'm saying like I think a lot\nof times if somebody's going through\nsomething you know somebody comes back\nand they're like oh he broke my heart\nagain I'm like you know he was always\nawful he treated you bad like it's none\nof that stuff do you know what I mean\nlike we always just want to give our\nopinion or kind of share and she just\nlistens she's there for you she\nencourages you and I think that's\nsomething that I I try to take into my\nother friendships too because I I can\nall be the opposite sometimes and I\nreally want to be better about no\njudgment like I know I could tell her\nanything and she will just take it and\nlike\nit won't even affect you at times no\nit's it's really it's a gift there's\nthere's one word that you said that I\nwanted to point out to everyone which I\nloved because I've never heard a friend\ndescribe that way she's a vault\nlike that is it great the visuals\nyeah nothing getting through yeah\nthere's nothing yeah and there's the\nidea that like you know because we all\nhave a friend that you like tell a\nsecret please don't tell anyone but yeah\nno they're gonna let it lead because\nit's gonna get out whatever it is uh\neveryone has a friend like that and\nbut but when you know your friends are\nvote like I love that I love that\nthought because there's such a safety\nthere there's such a security there uh\nthat's that's such a great Visual and\nand Raquel with with you and Tanya as\nwell like what is it that I guess\nallowed you to be a friend who is able\nto listen and not judge like where does\nthat come from for you because I think a\nlot of us feel that if we're not\nimmediately reaffirming what our friends\nare saying then our friends are not\ngoing to like us right right so like\nmost people think if my friend came up\nto me and said yeah I just broke up and\nyou know he was like this whatever and\nthen if you don't say oh yeah he's a\njerk and of course yeah you're the best\nlike we feel like our friends\nyeah I'm supposed to be on my side yeah\nexactly and and if you're listening and\njust being patient a lot of people might\njust be like well Raquel doesn't care\nabout me or she doesn't really feel\nsorry for me or whatever what's given\nyou that ability to be more patient to\nsay hey you know what I'm actually gonna\nlisten and be more more honest with\npeople rather than just like tell them\nwhat they want to hear yeah well I think\nit comes from trying to fully understand\nand live out true unconditional love and\nwhen you love someone unconditionally\nyou're not always telling them what they\nwant to hear you're saying or listening\nto what hopefully will lead them to\npeace and what I found is that when\nyou're bashing someone maybe in a moment\nit feels good but it doesn't lead to\nreal peace even if that person did do\nsomething wrong it's like okay you know\nwhat they that's\nthat sucks that that happened that's not\nokay but we're not gonna waste our time\ndwelling on that or or bashing that\nperson we're gonna you know focus on the\nfuture we're going to focus on what\nleads ultimately to peace and so I love\nmy friends I love the people that are\nclose to me and so I try to give an\nhonest answer and then sometimes you\nknow the person gets back with that\nperson or they stay with them and so\nimagine Tanya is one of my close friends\nshe's broken up with the guy and I'm\nlike yeah he's this he's that whatever\nand then they're back together and I've\nsaid all these horrible things about the\nperson that really she was just venting\nto me in a moment of a hard time that\nthey were having and so that's the angle\nthat I tried to come at it from is is\nwhat is the most helpful what is the\nmost peaceful what is is going to um be\nencouraging encouraging the most to her\nyeah that's great I think I think that's\nthe kind of friend that everyone says\nthey want and then we're always not sure\nwhen we actually get them well how do we\ngrow I mean I welcome that from my\nfriends I hope people are telling me the\ntruth I hope people are being honest\nwith me and not just telling me what I\nwant to hear because then I can't I\ncan't grow if people aren't being\ntruthful with me absolutely I feel like\neven with marriage like I'm married to\nsomeone like I um yeah okay I I\nofficiated a wedding last year and I was\npracticing to my wife before I\nofficiated and Ravi literally told me\nthe day before that it sucked\ndon't you know who I am and and I listen\nbecause it's my wife and I trust her and\nand after my ego kind of like quietened\ndown a bit I was like listening to her\nand I was like she's saying this for my\nbenefit yeah she wants me to be awesome\ntomorrow and she's telling me in advance\nso that I can be awesome wow I changed\nthe whole thing wrote it it went great\neverything was fine everyone loved it\nbut it was just it was so interesting\nbecause it's so hard to hear that from\nthe people closest to us sometimes\nbecause we just want to hear them adore\nus and and validate us right so yeah and\nof course you you know if Tanya's coming\nto me and she's been really hurt by\nsomeone I'm not immediately gonna be\nlike\nwell you know what yeah\nno it's acknowledging it it's being like\nwow that's like that's not okay that's\nwrong but then you know not not feeding\nit yeah I guess but you know what's\ninteresting what I've learned in in\nfriendships and relationships is like\nthere is no right and wrong\num there you know there's there's two\npeople there's two different\nperspectives there we've all grown up\ndifferently we handle situations\ndifferently and I think that\nas an individual we just think our way\nis the right way and the way we do\nthings is the way that everybody should\ndo things when in reality that's not how\nlife is and so it's kind of just you\nknow learning how to to work in that\nspace of like okay this is how you see\nit this is how I see it now how can we\nwork together to like get to the Finish\nLine yeah yeah I love that I love that\nuh let's dive into the book\num you chose 100 days which I'm\nfascinated by why a hundred days and I'd\nlove for you to tell us because uh it's\nit's a it's a beautiful number I like I\nlike 100 days I'm like yeah you can\nachieve a lot in 100 days yeah but it\nfeels manageable why a hundred days I\nthink for exactly that reason I think\nyou do 365 it feels like oh wow that's\nreally overwhelming\nno I think 100 is is digestible and it's\nyou know we could have done 30 do people\nsay it takes 30 days to create a new\nhabit or we could have done 90 but I I\nthought 100 was like a good number\nyou've got the three digits but it's not\nlike what 365 that long to find Hope and\njoy I want maybe no yeah yeah I think\nhaving a something that you can go to\ndaily for an extended period of time is\ngood but also if you skip a day or two\nit's not the end of the world and you\nstill you know what I mean like I think\na hundred to spell yeah like a good\nnumber I'm gonna tell you that I I feel\nthe same way because my original book\nthe one that's coming out now as well\nwas meant to be 52 rules of love and my\nattitude was like yeah I think that's\nreally awful about me yeah so it came\ndown to eight and it was it was a\nsimilar sort of feeling of like how do\nyou make it feel manageable and\nactionable and Powerful but but it's not\nalways easy to do that with the number\nbut I think 100 days is great like you\nsaid it takes 30 to 90 days to form a\nhabit a hundred days is is a brilliant\ncommitment it feels like you achieved\nsomething one of the things you talk\nabout in the book is overcoming imposter\nsyndrome and I love that topic so much\nbecause I think that people are and I've\nonly picked my favorite days and things\nthat I think were really powerful from\nthe book overcoming imposter syndrome is\nsuch a big thing today because more\npeople have access to more opportunities\nmore people are seeing more things\nhappening in the world and knowing\nwhat's going on in the world I know that\nin my own life I've experienced imposter\nsyndrome multiple times because I'm\nconstantly in rooms that I never thought\nI'd be in I'm constantly surrounded by\npeople that I feel inadequate to in some\nway or weak to in some way over time or\nrooms that I didn't imagine being or\ndidn't expect to be in and so imposter\nsyndrome is something I experienced time\nand time and time again I have my own\nway of dealing with it I'd love to know\nwhere have both of you felt imposter\nsyndrome in your life and let's start\nthere where have you felt it first let's\nstart there this is a big one for me\num because like Raquel said when I was\nearly on in my career I was\nit wasn't like a beautiful welcoming for\nme it was very much\num my personalities too much people can\nonly handle me in small doses I'm a\ncartoon character and and you know in\nthis career it's all your personality so\nlike that was very damaging at a young\nage when I was starting out so in my\nmind I had I was like 21 22.\num so you hear all that and you believe\nit because it's coming from people who\nare way above you in this corporate\nworld you know and this is something\nthat I I am so grateful you know I work\nwith Ryan Seacrest and he from the very\nbeginning has been so encouraging to me\nand he saw something in me and I I would\nnot be where I am if it wasn't for him\nbelieving in me because I did have to\ndeal with a lot of adversity from other\npeople\num it was very damaging and so and it\nwas like every step of the way in my\ncareer like I remember when I got my\nfirst TV gig at e\nI had it all over again about like I was\nlike I'm too much and I need to you know\nlower lower myself and and be a little\nbit quieter and\num every step and every Milestone that I\nwas making in my career I felt really\nnervous at the start because I was just\nlike I'm not supposed to be here I don't\nthis isn't I don't deserve this\num and and there's also a part of it too\nwhere it comes from\nyou know I\nI never dreamed that this was possible\nyou know like I I always envisioned it\nbut I never thought that it was actually\ngoing to be be a reality and so when\nit's actually becoming a reality it's\njust this crazy kind of like I don't\ndeserve this type of thing\num and so overcoming it has been a\nprocess like a major major process\nbecause I've had to kind of unwind and\nlike unhear all of these things and it's\nso funny because it's like\nthe people who see potential in you and\nbelieve in you that number was\nfar more than the ones that didn't\nbelieve and that try to put me down but\nyet those ones are like the loudest\nvoices and they're the hardest that you\ncan't get them out of your head I think\nit took me a decade to like get them out\nof my head yeah that's really done the\nwork yeah yeah that that's so true I\nmean the noise of other people's\nopinions is always louder than all these\nvoices of support and encouragement and\nuh yeah Raquel how about you yeah so for\nme I think\num having and continuing to remind\nmyself of how big God is and whatever\nwhoever is listening you call it God the\nuniverse the higher higher power I think\nwhen we have a revelation of of just how\nbig that is it's extremely humbling and\nso for me maybe similar to you I found\nmyself in in my I found myself in a lot\nof rooms with people where I'm like wow\nhow did I end up here and a prayer that\nI've always prayed is God I don't want\nto love anything or anyone more than I\nlove you and so I think when you go into\na room you understand that I'm worthy to\nbe here because I am a human being and\nwe are all worthy and when you\nunderstand the bigness of God the higher\npower of the universe you understand\nthat we all play a small part in this\njourney of Being Human and I think\nthat's really allowed me to overcome\nimposter syndrome because I do feel\nworthy I feel worthy to be in the room\nwith people who maybe I admire maybe\nhave achieved more than me but like what\nan honor I get to learn from them and\nand um and I'm worthy to be there\nbecause I am human oh that's so\nbeautiful I love that that that that\nreally hit me I love that and uh yeah\nand I think for me also\nfrom a practical sense I've started to\nembrace imposter syndrome as a sign that\nI'm growing yeah and so I find that I've\nstarted to look at imposter syndrome is\nevery time I feel it it means I'm doing\nsomething that's uncomfortable and I\nwill say I make it a point to surround\nmyself with better I surround myself\nwith people who are further along than\nme who challenge me who help me to grow\nand I have always been that way because\nI want to be better and and I don't\nthink we ever arrive I wrote about it in\nthe book but I said Maya Angelou she did\nan interview with Oprah in her her later\nyears and and she said I'm still\nlearning yeah I don't know when I know\nenough I'm still I've I've learned you\nknow a lot where I try to live what I\nknow but I still am not there and she\nwas considered to be one of the wisest\npeople in the world it still is and so I\nI try to remember that yeah absolutely\nand Tanya what was yours when because\nRaquel looked at you and she was like\nyou did the work like what were those 10\nand you said it took 10 years which I\nfeel is a genuine real amount of time I\nthink a lot of the time today we're like\noh you can get over imposter syndrome\nlike tomorrow and it's like no it takes\nyears to craft your relationship with\nhow you feel about feeling like an\nimposter and I do have to say I feel\nlike it adds a little bit of fuel to the\nfire you know what I mean like I think\nit made me I would go into a carpet and\nI\nyou wouldn't the amount of prep I did\nbefore a carpet was\nwild like I would be I was doing\nresearch I would watch every single\nmovie every single TV show like do the\nwhole background I really wouldn't\nprepare because I had that imposter\nsyndrome like you're not good enough\nyou're not good enough so it made me\noverachieve which I think ultimately was\na good thing and a blessing and so I\nthink in a way I I tried to kind of Turn\nThe Narrative of imposter syndrome and\nit was I try to realize like oh this is\nthis is helping me it's like fueling me\na little bit so I feel like once I\nstarted to change the narrative and you\nknow I started to grow and I was like\nokay yeah\nlike I just had to like quiet that voice\nyeah yeah I I I really appreciate that\nand and I want you to know that I've\nalways appreciated your energy and being\naround it so it's all right yeah yeah\nexactly it's always been nice\nwonderful and like I remember years ago\nthat's when I remember connecting with\nyou first was when like I think you told\nRyan about think like a monk on one of\nyour episodes oh yeah and I was getting\nhit up with loads of messages about it\nsaying oh that they heard it yeah yeah\nand then I think that's I think that was\nlike how we first like at least\nconnected on Instagram and and to me it\nwas just I remember watching that clip\nback and it was just like you're you\nwere so like Iran had no idea what it\nwas right right and you were just so\npositive about what I was I'm very\npassionate yeah very passionate very\npassionate I'm also like I think we take\nourselves so seriously I think that it's\nokay to be silly and to be animated and\nto like you know I I find there's so\nmuch vulnerability in those moments of\nlife and yet nobody wants to talk about\nthese embarrassing things or you know\nlike I used to do when I was dating\nI would like set the dinner table for\nmyself and my future partner like he\nwasn't there but I would and I would\nclean out my closet so there was space\nfor him to come like I did all those\nweird things manifested her entire life\nbut I'm like I I don't take myself too\nseriously you know I'm like if somebody\nsays something works for them I'll try\nit you know try it and if it doesn't\nwork for you doesn't work share the\nembarrassing moments because we're all\nwe all have them yeah I can relate to\nthat I don't think I've ever talked\nabout this when I came back from being a\nmonk and I couldn't get a job anywhere I\nused to dress up as if I was going to\nwork and I'd go to my local library and\nsit there and read books and apply to\njobs but it was like me going to work\nlike that feeling of like I've got to\nshow up as if I already do and then I'm\nable to attract him able to behave\nbetter or able to be more professional\nand so I love that example that\neveryone's gonna be doing that now yeah\nI'm gonna see loads of videos Everyone's\nsetting up two times the setting up of\nthe table was like a little bit maybe\ntoo far but I love it I'm gonna try this\nlike create like give yourself drawer\nthat's just empty in your room and give\na big chunk of your closet that's just\nempty and I was like this is me creating\nspace like how am I supposed to bring a\nman into my life that I desire so much\nif there's no space for him in here like\nactually no space there is not an inch\nof space in this room for somebody to\ncome in so I created I left an entire\ndrawer like a big drawer I did not know\nthat oh yeah and now who takes up more\nspace I still take it more stuff but\nthere's a lot of space for Robbie and\nall of his eyes\nI'm the opposite I have a way bigger\nwardrobe than Rosie it's so bad yeah it\nwas so bad I love it yeah Roddy is so\nunderstanding\nso it's so supportive yeah yeah I love\nit all right the next the next one that\nI picked out that I loved and everyone\nwho's listening there are a hundred days\nto finding the hope and joy you want I'm\njust picking some of my favorite that\nstood out to me and talking to these\nincredible authors Tanya radd and Raquel\nStevens uh authors yes exactly uh and of\ncourse you can order the book in the\ncomments and caption\num all right this second one which I\nloved was be true to you\num I think this is something that is an\nidea that we really struggle with\nbecause I see this Meme and I'm sure you\nboth have seen it on like Instagram and\nTick Tock and everyone it's it's\nprobably my favorite thing and so it\nsays society says colon be yourself and\nthen society says colon no not like that\nright it's like we all live in this\nworld where it's like be yourself and\nthen when you be yourself I was like no\nno not like that please don't be that\nversion of yourself yeah and it's like\nthis really interesting idea that we're\nconstantly be told be true to you but\nthen when you really see someone in all\ntheir authenticity and all their flaws\nand all their genuineness we don't like\nit we consider it ugly when the truth is\nwe all have that inside of us like we we\nall are that so how have you both got\ncomfortable with looking at the parts of\nyourself that make you uncomfortable I\ndon't want to live my life not accepting\nthose things so I've had times in my\nlife where my flaws are my things that I\ndon't maybe love about myself have\nreally you know they've given me anxiety\nor they've made me feel badly about\nmyself you know when I especially during\nmy high school years I was like do you\nknow do I not look good enough am I not\nthis enough am I not that enough\nand it's like I'm either gonna live like\nthat live insecure\nconcerned with you know maybe more of\nthe external things or I'm gonna be so\nfilled up with who God created me to be\nwhich is loved valuable accepted just\nthe way I am and through doing that and\naccepting that and through being myself\nI feel like I've been able to cultivate\na life that is authentic to me I have\nrelationships that are real as a result\nof being myself of being true to me\nbecause if we're not the other path is\nnot it's not great you're gonna live\nconstantly anxious you're gonna have\nsurface relationships because you're\nhiding a part of who you are and so I\nthink that it takes courage to be\nvulnerable but what's on the other side\nof that is total freedom and real\nconnection and all the things that we\nreally want in life I think the what I\nhave found to be the the issue with this\nis social media and I love social media\nI have a really great relationship with\nit I have people that the people that\nfollow me on Instagram are so\nencouraging and so lovely yes there's a\ncouple here and there that are negative\nbut for the most part it's a really\nbeautiful Community for me but I have\nrealized that I think it's really\ndamaging in many ways because we're\nplaying the comparison game so it's like\nyes I'm gonna be true to myself but\neverybody is you know holding this bag\nand so I'm gonna spend all my money to\nget this bag so I have it in my social\nmedia because that's what everybody's\ndoing and I'm not sitting here to say\nyou know spend your money how you want\nbut I think that we've been wired to\nkind of uh chase this unattainable\nlifestyle that might not be within our\nmeans and we're like I wrote about in\nthe book being financially fit was\nreally important for me because in\nSaving and you kind of have to like take\nthat comparison and live your own life\nbecause you're going to go into debt\ntrying to keep up with the Joneses when\nthat's not in your means and so I think\nthe comparison game in that way I talk a\nlot about finances because I think it's\nnot talked about especially with younger\nwomen enough you know the importance of\nsaving and also with all these filters I\nremember I wrote a specific chapter\nabout this because it was very alarming\nI'm 30 years old and I was using this\nsupermodel filter and I like loved the\nway I I loved my face I was like wow\nshe's gorgeous and so I I would get I\nwould look in my in the mirror and I\nwould get kind of like how I I even went\nto the point where I took a screenshot\nof my face with the filter and a\nscreenshot on my face regular sent it to\nmy friend that's a plastic surgeon and\nsaid what do I need to do to look like\nthis and he responded with like\nI don't even know now it was a nose job\ncheek fillers you know some sort of\ntaking out the fat in my cheek and I was\njust like this is so wild I am a fully\ndeveloped woman and I'm having this\nconversation right now imagine how\ndamaging this is for somebody younger\nand insecure and figuring out who they\nare and so I kind of made a point right\nthen and there I stopped using filters\non Instagram because I was like I don't\nwant anybody to see me in a different\nway and I also don't want to mess with\nmy own head and like look in the mirror\nand think oh you know I want to look in\nthe mirror and see myself and so I made\na really big point to just like stop\nusing the filters and I put a challenge\nin the book for people to do the same\nfor even just like 24 hours just to like\npost without a filter it's okay and and\nkind of get used to that because I think\nthe more you the more you are accepting\nof yourself in every way social media\nand not on social media it just gives\nyou a different sense of confidence I\nthink yeah can you show me that filter\noff too\n[Applause]\nno that I love that challenge by the way\nI think that challenge is awesome I I\nlove the idea that\nit's obviously if anyone wants to change\nthe way they look or anything I you know\nI don't think anyone here is saying yeah\nI don't think I don't think anyone talks\nit's not like uh I'm not against any of\nit totally totally but I think that\nthere there's a fine line between you\nknow uh looking at yourself and just\nbeing sad on a regular basis and just\nand almost that distant that's created\nbetween when you start seeing yourself\nwith someone else on a screen right and\nthen when you start seeing yourself as\nsomeone else in the mirror and that\ndistance is wider and wider and wider\nthat's really hard yeah right and if I\nremember when so when we're in the\nmonastery there were no this is really\nphenomenal when we're in the monastery\nthere's no mirrors whoa so you lose the\nidea of identity and how you look now\nyou you shave your hair and stuff so you\ndon't even have hair to look at or\nwhatever but the point is that I would\ncatch myself looking at my reflection\nwhen I was like if I was on the streets\nand I was walking past the store or a\nwindow I would catch myself looking at\nmy reflection because I was so used to\nthat from before and it was so\ninteresting to me to not look in the\nmirror for like a big chunk of my life\nthat is just such a fascinating thing of\nlike you lose that sense of like that's\nimportant and you actually have time to\ngo in that's wild yeah and so so hearing\nyour idea in the same way of like hey\ndon't use filters you actually get more\ntime to get to know yourself you get\nmore time to love yourself appreciate\nyourself and and deal with the reality\nuh rather than a false reality that can\nreally mislead you and mess you up with\nwhen you do look in the mirror now\nyou're disappointed with with how you\nlook and face tune is is wild I mean you\ncan you can really do some wild things\non that yeah you have to be really\nskilled to use those things yeah but it\ndoes it does like morph it I don't even\ntry\njust imagine it's like no I'm not I'm\nterrible and that's dumb I'm like\nterrible at all that stuff but uh but no\nI I really love both your answers to\nthat and I love that challenge and the\nbook has more\nwhich I love uh challenges because I\nthink that they're the simple little\nhabit tricks and hacks that we need in\norder to learn these very deep profound\nlessons yeah um the other thing I was\njust saying uh on an interview that I\nwas doing was uh the idea of and I'd\nlove everyone to think about this and\nI'd love you to come up with a challenge\nfor this maybe live in real time maybe\nlet's do it uh I I just came up with\nthis so ignore me if it's really hard\nbut we'll try and and if it goes\nterribly we'll cut it out okay so I was\ntalking about so we talked about the\nmirror one about me and the monster and\nactually what you're coming up with is\nlike a brilliant challenge for that same\nprinciple uh another thing that I felt I\nlearned uh while living as a monk was we\nlost the concept of time because I\ndidn't have to be anything by 25 or if I\nwould have stayed longer as a monk it\nwasn't like by 30 you have to be married\nin this right like so when I lived as a\nmonk there was no timeline because once\nyou're a monk you're a monk and there\nwas nothing that you had to do at 30 40\n50 and obviously I didn't I wasn't there\nfor that long but you could see the 70\nyear old monks we're doing the same\nthing that the 25 year old monks were\ndoing like there was no big discrepancy\nin there and so you lose the sense of\nTime how do you think we can all let go\nof that sense of like well by 30 I need\nto be in a relationship by 40 I need to\nbe a millionaire by whatever it may be\nright the these timelines that Society\ncomes up with can we could we all\nco-create a challenge that helps people\nuh lose a sense of time it's funny that\nyou bring that up because I think that's\nsomething that I really struggle with\nright like very much so you know I\nthought I was gonna be married with kids\nat 25. and so and that didn't happen I\nwas like oh you know what and I have\nsome I want you to share an example that\nyou have told me before because I think\nit's really good I think that um there's\na scripture that I love and it says\ntalks about like content with little\ncontent with much you know it talks\nabout being content with whatever\ncircumstance you're in and I think\nwhat's interesting is that we can be\nlike I just really want to be married I\nreally want to partner and then you talk\nto your married friends and they're like\nenjoy your single life whatever you talk\nto people with kids you're like I want\nkids and they're like oh enjoy having no\nkids and you know I think that that each\nseason of life is so beautiful and\nunique in its own way and I think when\nwe make a choice to just be happy and\ngrateful for right now and it's like\nokay I'm single I don't have kids I have\nmy freedom I can pick up and do whatever\nI want at any time like that is a\nblessing for right now but Tanya got a\ndirect message from someone yeah yeah\ntell him the story because it's\neverybody the story it sounds beautiful\nby the way Raquel that that really\nthat's such a I love that content with\nlittle content with much with much yeah\nyeah that's beautiful and it is so\nimportant to appreciate the season that\nyou're in because I think I was never\nshy about the fact that I want like I\nwanted to be married I want to have kids\nand that's a desire of my heart so like\nI would pursue that like I pursued my\ncareer when I tell you I went on\nprobably 200 dates in seven years I went\non probably more wow and I really gave\nit my all like I pursued it just as hard\nas I pursued my career and it's funny\nbecause I think God did this in like he\npurposefully gave me a very long single\nseason because I would not have person\ndude my career the way that I did had I\nbeen in a romantic relationship and I\nknow that about myself because I go I'm\nall in you know like I'm all in on my\nrelationship right now and I love it\nit's the best season ever but had this\nbeen 10 years ago I wouldn't have been\nable to build what I did and so I know\nlike God was like I see you I know I'm\ngonna fulfill the desire of your heart\nmaybe not in the time that you think and\nit's interesting because I got this DM\nand I had spent the day\num I went on like a nine mile run and I\nwas cleaning out my apartment and I was\nsaging and I was you know I was on\nInstagram and just saying you know what\nI was doing for the day\nand I was going through a breakup so I\nwas heartbroken I was really sad and I\nwasn't shy about it and some woman\nresponded to me and she said\nI would give anything to trade lives\nwith you right now I am currently\nbreastfeeding one baby potty training\nanother that's peeing all over the floor\nwhile I'm making my husband breakfast\nI would give anything to be in your\nsituation right now and here she is with\nthe life that I desire and she's saying\nshe wants to switch places with me and\nso it was such like a direct message\nfrom God that like you're where you're\nsupposed to be enjoy this moment enjoy\nthe season it's not going to be like\nthis forever you know Seasons don't last\nforever they are seasons for a reason\nand so it was like very uh timely that\nmessage wow yeah I guess the challenge\ncould be think about your life today and\nwhere you're at and what you're grateful\nfor so maybe write it down I'm if I'm\nsingle I have my freedom I can go to bed\nwhen I want I can go to the store if I\nwant to I can go meet a friend\num if you have kids think about you know\nthings that you're grateful for with\nyour kids with your husband and so maybe\nthe challenge is you know I'm grateful\nfor this right now instead of focusing\non future I want more of this I want a\nbetter job I want you know\npartner boyfriend husband kit like just\nthink about it's it's gratitude right\nand I think gratitude eliminates angst\nabout the future but I also think I\nremember reading this in your first\nbooks it was about not attaching your\nhappiness to like things to to the title\nor the whatever you know what I mean\nit's like attaching your happiness to\nthis like state of mind and like\nrelationships and that stuff that is\nwhat life is about yeah I know I love\nwhat you're both saying I think the\nFreaky Friday moment's really\ninteresting like this idea of like\nswitching lives with someone that you\nthink has it all and if you were able to\ndo that\nmost of us you know maybe would\nbacktrack to some degree or there'd be\nsome more appreciation for our life even\nif and of course that's that's different\ndepending on how different those\nexamples are but I think also it's\ndifferent for women because we do have\nlike a biological clock so there is like\nthat little timeline and I've been kind\nof dealing with that a little bit lately\nbut I think now there's so many\nresources there's so much you can do I\nknow women that are having babies on\ntheir own you know they couldn't find a\npartner and so they're just doing it on\ntheir own and I think it's such a\nliberating time to be a woman and so I\nthink all of these things are slowly\nstarting to like become less of um\ntimeline yeah yeah definitely and and I\nagree with you I think that you know I\nthink the pressure to do something\nbecause of just time and you're right as\na woman definitely you you experience it\nfar more and it's I talked to radi about\nthis all the time and it's it's such a\nyeah it's a challenge but I like that\nchallenge Raquel of like\nfiguring out what you currently have\nthat you once dreamed of yeah like it's\nalmost like what do you currently have\nthat you really wanted yeah because\nthere was a time like you're saying that\nyou will have really pursued the career\nnow you have the career and you're\npursuing the next thing and it's like\nyeah but what do I have right now that I\nonce really wished for it could be as\nsmall as I get a bit of free time it\ncould be as big as I have the career I\nwant it could be as huge as I have the\npartner and the kids whatever it is or I\ncan run a mile today it can be so small\nexactly and I one more thing too that I\nwant to say is what which touches on all\nof this and helps with it and is\nactually the reason that we wrote the\nbook is that the best advice I could\ngive to anyone is to prioritize your\ninner life because when your inner life\nis strong you can handle anything that\ncomes your way so those Seasons where\nyou're like really wishing and hoping\nfor that thing and you don't have it yet\nyour inner life is what sustains you\nwhen you get the job when you have the\npartner that you've always wanted it\nhumbles you and it fills you with\nattitude as opposed to Ego and arrogance\nand everything in between when your\ninner life when your spirit's strong\neven in the mundane moments that's what\ngives you inspiration fills you with all\nand so I think just the best life advice\nfor anyone at any age is prioritize your\ninner life that will fill you up to be\nable to handle anything that comes your\nway absolutely absolutely I I have\nsomething that I often repeat to myself\nand others which is when things are bad\nwork hard but when things are good work\nharder yes and I mean that on your\ninternal self yeah when things are good\nexternally it's really easy to forget\nthat actually you're only able to have\nthis amazing external experience because\nof the inner work absolutely like years\nago or months ago and then when things\nare great you like stop doing the inner\nwork and then all of a sudden now you're\nin a cloudy season and that because you\ndidn't do the inner work in the last\nseason it's not protecting you and so I\nyeah I love that and if that's the heart\nof the book I think you know it it\nreally I I would I would love that I\nknow our community does that everyone\nwho listens to on purpose is such a\ninner work person and I'm glad that they\nnow have 100 new ways of of doing that\nuh one of the other ones I've got a few\nmore if you don't mind yeah\nall right I want to talk about this one\nbecause I think it's a big one be done\nwith shame right this one was like this\nthis one really stood out to me because\nI think shame and guilt are things all\nof us carry in so many different ways\nthey weigh us down they let us\npotentially push someone away that we\nlove they block us from receiving love\nYeah shame and guilt to just this\nhuge what looks like a shield but\nactually is just a barrier and keeping\nthings out and and not letting us be\nourselves and not letting people love us\ntalk to me about what shame and guilt\nhas blocked in your life and\nhow you've changed your relationship\nwith shaming Gill yeah so brene Brown uh\ntalks about shame as shame as I am bad\nand guilt is I've did I've done\nsomething bad and guilt can be a good\nthing right makes us not repeat the same\nmistakes but shame is a deep deep belief\nof so then again that's really powerful\nit's so good\nbrene Brown describes two things shame\nand guilt shame as I am bad guilt is\nI've done something bad guilt can be\ngood and healthy because it helps us to\nnot make the same mistakes again shame\nis extremely difficult and heartbreaking\nbecause it's a deep belief of I am bad\nI'm not good enough I'm not this enough\nI'm not that enough and when we live our\nlives from a place of shame we miss out\non on being our true authentic self and\nso I almost could cry talking about it\nbecause shame it you know in friends\nthat I've\nclose friends that I have that have\nexperienced shame it breaks my heart\nbecause you can see you know it's\ndebilitating and in my own life areas\nwhere I've felt some shame maybe I'll go\nback to high school maybe you know other\ngirls getting the boyfriend or this\nwithout me not feeling pretty enough for\nexample you have to do the inner work\nright because it's like that's not true\nit's like I am beautiful God's created\nme exactly the way that I am I'm meant\nto be and if I go on to carry that shame\nthen that's going to affect me it's\ngoing to affect me when I'm out on dates\nit's going to affect you know how I see\nmyself and that\num is extremely detrimental and so you\nget through shame through first\nacknowledging it\nbeing able to speak it aloud maybe to a\ntrusted friend and then you pray about\nit or you meditate on it and that's when\nyou do the inner work of like okay God\nthe universe help me to see myself as\nyou see me beautiful wonderful made\nexactly the way that I was created to be\nand it takes time and it takes work\nTanya's really big on visual like seeing\nthings visual so she you've told me\nbefore about your body you'll write on\nthe mirror I am this I am beautiful I am\nthis and and seeing it and speaking that\nover yourself so when negative thoughts\ncome I'm you know I'm I don't like my\nlove handles or whatever it's like I'm\nbeautiful the my love handles are\nbeautiful and speaking truth over\nyourself and that is how you come\nagainst shame wow that's a great\nexplanation thanks Raquel yeah\nI mean I could we could do a whole\npodcast on chain because it break I\nliterally I'm like getting emotional\nthinking about it right now you could\ncry it it breaks my heart it's like I\njust live in that they live I know I\ncan't believe I'm gonna start crying on\nJay shetty's podcast right now but I my\nfriends that I I and you can see it on\npeople and you can feel it off of them\nand it holds them back and that's why I\ncare a lot actually about we want to\ntake this book into schools and into\njunior highs and high schools because\nkids that are dealing with shame their\nbrains are still developing or is it's a\nlot harder when you're adult I think\nabout my friends that are adults and\nthey are are experiencing that shame\nit's a lot harder to move forward and\nand change those negative self beliefs\nbut when you're younger it's a it's\neasier because your your brains aren't\nfully developed so it is possible\neveryone can do the work everyone can\nheal and change but it absolutely breaks\nmy heart and I and for anybody who's\nlistening who feels Shame about\nsomething in their life maybe they\nhaven't ever shared with anybody it's\nlike it doesn't matter what it is you\nare you are enough nobody is ever too\nfar gone there's a mistake you've made\nthere's nothing you've done that can't\nbe\num healed and it's just yeah and the\ndifference that she expressed from brene\nBrown the difference between guilt and\nshame is so powerful because it is it's\nlike we've all we all make mistakes we\nall trip we all fall and being able to\nkind of like speak on that guilt pray\nabout it I made that mistake and I don't\nwant to live in that mistake and moving\nforward with my life like is so there's\nso much power in that I think a lot of\npeople don't know how to get to the\nother side yeah and and I think often we\nstop other people moving on with their\nguilt because we're still stopping\nourselves from moving on from argue yeah\nand it's like an insecurity when we see\nsomeone say I'm going to leave my shame\nbehind guilt help me grow and we we\ncan't deal with that because we haven't\ndone that for ourselves yeah\num so powerful and and I'm putting out\nthere too I think I think this book\nwould make a great book club book yeah I\ncould see a lot of people reading it\ntogether reflecting on a lot of these\nideas doing these challenges together\nlike it's a very practical book for sure\nand I'm a big fan of practical books\nbecause I think that it's not just a\nbook that you're going to read on your\nown hopefully there's a book that you\ngrab for your friends you're going to\nread it together you're going to discuss\nall these even in the way us three are\nlike this is really I am I I find this\nreally therapeutic like you know and I\nfeel like I'm in therapy right now yeah\nwell even me but even me like I feel\nlike I'm opening up because you guys are\nopening up and there's these beautiful\nthemes that you've selected in the book\nthat everyone can relate to like none of\nthis everything that everyone everything\nwe've all said is is stuff that we're\nall dealing with in very unique\ndifferent ways totally uh but it's still\nthere okay I've got a couple more that I\nwant to pick up right I really like this\none because it's obviously linked to my\nnew book um aprils of love yes and I\nlove that this comes up in your book so\nit's prioritized character over\nchemistry and I love this because\num you know I'm I'm a big romantic I'm a\nbig fan of chemistry and I'm also just a\nbig fan of love like I'm obsessed with\nit I'm I'm kind of like you in the sense\nof\nI always had this obsession with wanting\nto be madly in love wanting to be\nmarried\num wanting to have like this\namazing relationship like that was a big\npart of who I what I wanted when I was a\nkid and then I married someone who\ndoesn't like PDA who doesn't like who\nisn't a romantic it's been amazing like\nit's it's so much growth and a beautiful\ntotally totally but I love this idea of\ncharacter over chemistry and I wanted\nyou to describe uh maybe Tanya you can\nstart with this one but it's like what\nis the what is the difference and then\nwhat did you mean by this so I was at\nthis a friend's wedding\num this was a while ago and the the the\nthe guy that was officiating the the\nwedding the Pastor said it was a it was\na Bible verse and it was all about\nprioritizing character over chemistry\nand he said chemistry can lead to\nsome healthy you know couple good years\nof marriage character is what's going to\nlast you a lifetime in a marriage and I\nstarted thinking about that and it's so\ntrue when you're dating chemistry is the\nfirst thing that we all just we all\ncling to you know I want to make out\nwith you I like you know I'm very\nphysically attracted to you chemistry is\nwhat takes the dating world you know to\nThe Next Step but it's the character you\ncan have chemistry with somebody and\nthat kind of but that's gonna fizzle\nit's like a fire it's gonna burn out but\ncharacter is what lasts a lifetime and\nso that's what I found to be so\ninteresting when I was in my dating\nworld because it was I was prioritizing\nthe chemistry it was like oh no I don't\nwant to go out with him because like I\ndon't want to make out with him you know\nlike that was always my go-to was like\nwas I physically attracted to him and\nyes I think that is important obviously\nin a relationship but I don't think it\nis the number one thing and I think if\nyou meet someone or you know\nthe front's trying to set you up and\nthey're like this is a really quality\nperson they have a really great\ncharacter I think it's totally worth\ngoing out with because that's what's\ngoing to last the lifetime I think and\nthat's something that I always say about\nmy boyfriend right now his character is\nlike I met him too yes\nyes he is just his character is so\nstrong he's got great energy he's been\nthrough so much in his life and you\nwouldn't even know it because he puts it\nlike he just carries himself so well he\ndoesn't bring past experiences into his\nnew relationship he just has such a\nstrong character and I think that and we\nobviously have chemistry too but the\ncharacter is what trumps everything like\nit is just it's so important I think\nwhen you're dating remembering that is\nlike so crucial so I want to ask you in\nthose 200 dates you went on yeah\nwhich by the way is inspiring and I want\nto do I want you to talk about that\nbecause I have so many friends right now\nwho struggle with dating are scared of\ndating I was literally talking to a\nfriend you know who you are if you're\nlistening to this episode uh I sent a\nvoice note late last night to a friend\nsaying dude this guy I was like you just\nneed the answer I was like just\nterrifying I was like dude you literally\nneed to meet this person because I don't\nsee what's what you don't like about her\nlike as in and and if you don't go out\non a date you're not going to know\nanything yeah you can't decide based on\na picture in someone's bio of like who\nthey are like so I was just saying you\nneed to get out there and I think so\nmany people today and we have to be\nhonest like the pandemic set us back\nwith social interactions social anxiety\nwhy not people are scared of meeting\npeople people are uh forgotten how to\nhave conversation people may not be as\nconfident with who they are anymore like\nyeah we can't ignore that uh how did you\nfirst of all how did you find the\ncourage inspiration to go out in 200\ndates like every time because I think\npeople go out on one or five right and\nthen there's seven and they're tired\nlike it's exhausting yeah and it's very\ndisheartening yeah so so let's talk\nabout that first and then the second\npart I'm going to ask you is and I'll\nsave the second question and then Raquel\nI'm coming to you in a second all right\nI would love to talk to her about it\nyeah exactly\num I think the thing that uh I was like\nthe one hit wonder I'll go out with\nanybody once because I'm with you like\nyou don't know if you're gonna get along\nwith somebody you can only tell so much\non a photo in a bio so I would always\nsay yes to a first date\num but no matter what no even if you\ndidn't like their picture even if you\nweren't attractive yeah I would go out\num but I was I didn't go on very many\nsecond dates like I'm very quick to know\nand so I would know like it's not gonna\nhappen so when I say 200 it was just\nlike yeah I would just keep it moving\nyou know keep it moving there were a\ncouple in there that I would date you\nknow a couple months here and there and\nI think I did the longest I did somebody\nwas six months\num so they're like little heartbreaks\nthroughout the whole and it is it's\ndisheartening it's just like\nis he out there like I thought this was\ngonna be him and then it turns out you\nknow this guy like I dated when I tell\nyou the stories and that's why I wrote\nThe Dating book because I'm like it's it\nfeels like a movie some of these things\nI met a guy on Wilshire Boulevard roll\ndown his window asked me on a date went\nout with him he was totally yeah yeah\nyeah she really said yes yes I literally\nsaid yes but you know time after time it\ndoes get very disheartening but I always\nhave this journal it's called My Dear\nFuture Husband journal and after really\nbad dates I would come home and I would\njust write in it okay that's the book\nThat's My Dear Future Husband\nyeah but I would always look at I would\nwrite and like I would write about Hope\nand the hope that I had for this man I\nknew it was out there because\nwhen God puts a desire in your heart he\nfulfills it again it might not be on\nyour timetable but like it's such a\nstrong desire of my heart to have a\npartner to share a life to be married to\nhave a family and so I knew he was going\nto fulfill it so I would write to my\nfuture husband just I would just write\nto him in this journal after every bad\ndate and it kind of kept me out of that\nmindset of this sucks there's nobody out\nthere like uh our guys really like you\nknow I mean I it was everything under\nthe Sun so that journal really helped me\nkeep hope alive in my life\num so that's kind of how I navigated the\ndating cool all right Raquel I'm coming\nto you and then I'm coming back to you\nokay all right so no well I guess the\nquestion's about obviously this\ncharacter of a chemistry piece and you\nknow you've you know you've talked about\nthis before just about how like dating\nin relationships are sacred to you and\nit's hard like you you you're not you\ndon't just dive in no no no you know\nyou're very careful and composed and\nlike again it you know I think you're\nsuch an accomplished person internally\nand externally and and society and I\ntalk a lot about this in my book where\nSociety has made us believe that we're\ninadequate if we're not with something\nabsolutely yeah and I completely\ndisagree with that obviously\num you have another section in this book\nwhich is all about the power of finding\nSolitude yeah uh which I love which I'm\nsuch a big proponent of and even in\nTanya's case she was talking about how\nlike being single was so important for\nher now being together and she was able\nto achieve things so how do you how have\nyou made peace with that part in your\nlife where that's something you're\nfiguring it out it's not something\nthat's worked out you're not\ndisqualifying yourself because you're\nnot making a reflect on who you are and\nobviously as I'm saying I know who you\nare and\num anyone I'm just throwing out that\nwould be lucky to be with Raquel truly\ntruly and I mean that and I've always\nsaid that to you like off camera like\nyou know yeah and so but but you're\nsomeone who's patient and getting it\nright so like how do you deal with that\nas we're dealing with all this other\nnoise as well because great question so\nfirst of all character over chemistry\nevery day I completely agree with\neverything that Tanya said you can find\na lot of people that you have chemistry\nwith but you want to be with the person\nof character that's what's gonna lead to\na peaceful life\num I have not dated seriously in the\nlast 10 years which I think can be\nreally surprising to people because\nthey're like you're in your 20s it's you\nknow your Prime and and you're not\ndating and it is something that I take\nextremely seriously so I do go on dates\num and I'm open to it but unless\nsomething truly feels right and I see\nthe person as a person of Integrity a\nperson of character I time is too\npressure is and I will not invest my\ntime in someone that I don't feel is\nright for me and\num through not dating I've been able to\nhave an amazing time in my 20s with my\nfriends and building a career and\ntraveling and living a great very\nfulfilled Life as a single person and I\nfeel enough and whole on my own so for\nme to be with someone which I would love\nto be with someone I would like to find\na partner of characters someone that\ntogether we are stronger I love that\nsaying you know two are stronger than\none I I would absolutely love that but I\nam totally content and at peace in the\nmeantime and I'm open to it and I think\nthat you know you're right there is a\nlot of pressure on people to feel like\noh I'm not enough if I don't have a\npartner but of course we are we're\nindividuals and we are you know the\ntruth is you're born alone and you die\nalone and so your relationship with you\nis is the most important thing to\nprioritize and when you prioritize that\nthen you're going to be the best version\nof yourself for when that partner does\nbut I do think it's like so important\nfor people to hear that because I do\nthink that\num there are a lot of people myself\nincluded if I looked at myself at 21 I\ndidn't think I could function without a\nI was I was just jumping from a\nrelationship to relationship I didn't\nwant to be alone and when I was single I\nwas able like I I lived alone for the\nfirst time and I you know I started\ninvesting my money and like you know\nthings that I just never thought that I\nwould do or what I could do on my own\nyou know like I always say like I'm a\nmodern woman and I really feel like I\ndeveloped this strong sense of self and\nnow that I I do have a partner he it\ndoes it just it's like\num it is she's made me stronger as a\nperson and my life better but I feel\nlike it's so important because if you\njust attach yourself to somebody because\nyou don't want to be single yeah it can\nlead you down a bad path you know it's\nnot going to lead you to your potential\nif you're just dating somebody because\nyou don't want to be alone I think you\nneed to date someone\nto elevate you yeah yeah and I think I\nthink it's so right like I think when\nyou run from relationship to\nrelationship to relationship that's when\nyou fall in love instead of growing in\nlove and I think for anyone like I've\nbeen with radino for nearly 10 years and\nit's it's been more growth than falling\nlike I like that Fallen growth we fell\nin love sure like that statement has\nalways I've always wanted to fall in\nlove so that's that's like but that's\nbecause of Hollywood and that's because\nthe movies and music that's not because\nof me when now is someone who believes\nI'm in love with someone who's in love\nwith me we're growing every day we don't\nfall more deeply in love together like\nright we grow more deeply in love\nthere's so much more Evolution and\nlearning and it's really interesting I\nwas talking about this the other day\nthat so many people feel like enjoyment\nis the peak of a relationship and I'd\nactually say like the amount you've\ngrown together and evolved together is\nlike the peak of a relationship because\nit makes life easier yeah uh rather than\nyou know just pleasure not saying there\nisn't any kind of like the chemistry and\ncharacter point I want to go back to\nboth of you on that because I fully\nagree with you too how do you discern\ncharacter like how do you because I\nthink a lot of people say I know if I'm\nattracted to someone right I know if we\nhave a bit of a spark because we're\ngoing back and forth and there's you\nknow distress and excitement but\ncharacter it's like how do you know\nbecause characters such a big word uh\nyou know we always hear these scary\nstories about I was dating this guy and\nthen he had a whole nother family like\nin another state right like I I don't\nknow\nstuff like this all the time\npodcast starts out with like this Shady\nboyfriend I'm like\nno no or like or like you find out that\nyou know this person isn't everything\nthey said they were they didn't have\nthat much money or whatever it was or\nlike well they didn't look like whatever\nlike there's just so many and of course\nKendra swindler yeah yeah that's why\nthose are all extreme scenarios right so\nI don't want to put that out there yeah\nyeah make everyone feel like oh my God\neveryone you meet but you have to be\nskeptical and you have to get a private\ninvestigator or something like that\num but but I guess my point is how have\nyou learned to discern character when\nyou are meeting people and when you were\ndating and I would love to hear it from\nsomeone who's like gone through that\nprocess like more recently than me I\nthink um the way that they handle\nobviously the first meeting uh offering\nto pick you up or you know like offering\nto pick you up but also saying if you're\nmore comfortable to meet there but like\nthe gesture um seeing if they want to\ncome to you how do they treat the people\nat the restaurant you know how do they\ntreat the waiter how do they treat the\nhostess\num are they you know\num when they're speaking about their\nlife and their passions and other people\nare they talking badly about other\npeople do they have a a sense of spirit\nor you know what I mean like I think\nit's just being super like lasered in on\nhow they're pres you know like on a\nfirst date there's only so much you can\ntell but I feel like you can also still\ntell a lot one I think I'm really big on\nlooking at the fruit of people's life\nand I think what I mean by that is who\nare their friends who do they surround\nthemselves with\num are they generous it doesn't have to\nbe with money are they generous with\ntheir relationships are they generous\nwith their time\num but I think who people have around\nthem says a lot about a person so if you\nmeet someone and you meet the friends\nare not they're not really cutting it\nyou know what I mean it's or or there's\ncertain things that feel a little bit\noff then\num that's a sign yeah those are great I\nlove all of those everyone who's\nlistening and watching write those down\nyeah because they're so awesome take a\nscreenshot of where we are on the\nepisode right now because all of those\nare such great ways to know character uh\nmy some of mine that I love is I I want\nto see someone when they're tired\nstressed and irritated I feel like when\nI see someone and that doesn't make me\ndecide whether they're a good person or\nbad person because by the way I'm really\nnot nice when I'm irritated but it's\nlike I want to see someone with those\nemotions because that's like really\nseeing their character when you see\npeople in a date in an interview format\nthey're really tired stressed they're\nfatigued and when you see someone who's\nfeeling those things like I remember\nwhen I first saw Riley in those ways or\nRiley saw me in those ways it was\nhealthy for us to actually get to know\nthe kind of like the reality of certain\nemotions you are going to feel if you\nend up with someone yeah those don't\ncome out for a while\n[Applause]\nI think that character it's not tested\nin our good moments it is tested\nthat's a true sign of somebody but I\nthink you can figure that out on a date\nyou know what I mean I think also like\nlearning when you're learning about\nsomebody you can really kind of ask\nquestions and I feel like I remember\nwhen I was dating I was very aware of of\nmy mishaps and my patterns that were\ntoxic and in dating and you know what I\nmean like being able to share that with\nsomebody and like being vulnerable like\nyou know I used to do this a lot and I\nwould you know kind of being vulnerable\nnow way and then just kind of seeing how\nthey also dealt with you know adversity\nin their life I think is also a true\nTestament to care I agree before we get\nto the final five is there a question I\nhaven't asked you or something that's on\nyour heart both of you are such hot\ncentered\nuh deep people that like I want to make\nsure that if there's anything\nintuitively that's within you that you\nreally want to share with the on-purpose\ncommunity is that something that's on\nyour mind or heart that haven't asked\nyou or you really want to share that\nyou'd like to share our hope with right\nit's it's hard work to write a book you\nknow and tell me about it so our hope is\nreally that that people would read it\nand you know they would feel like\nthey're reading along with two friends\nand that they would know that they're\nnot alone and I'm not just saying that\nas something to say like whatever you're\nfacing in life you are not alone and so\num you know we welcome people sending us\nyou know direct messages or you want to\nsend an email if you you know you have\nquestions or even if you want prayer for\nsomething like you know I'm here and and\nwe're here and um we are all in this\njourney together on this journey\ntogether and I think that it can be easy\nto turn on the news or to look at our\nworld today and feel very discouraged\nand think this is not us the sunshine is\na dark world there's a lot of unrest but\nthe truth is there is way more good in\nthe world than there is bad and\nsometimes you have to fight a little bit\nfor it but it is possible to live life\nwith what we call the Sunshine mind and\nI hope that people through reading this\ncan can feel that from our writing yeah\nI really I do I hope that there are\ntangible things that people can take\naway you know and I we wrote in there\nlike live life through hope colored\nglasses because I think oftentimes it's\neasier to to look at the negative and go\ndown a dark path and I think that we\nchoose hope we choose joy and it's not\nto be little people that have you know\nstrong feelings and things that are\ngoing on in their lives but I think like\non the daily you can really you can kind\nof train your brain to to look at life\nin a different way and so yeah people\nfind that yeah so beautiful and and\nagain uh the book is called the Sunshine\nmind 100 days defining the hope and joy\nyou want uh Tanya rad and Raquel Stevens\nmake sure you follow them again if you\ndon't uh go and grab a copy of the book\nI have my final five that we ask every\nguest uh I've never been on the show on\ntheir first time on the show great uh so\nthis is a rapid fire Fast Five which\nmeans the questions can only be answered\nin one word to one sentence maximum well\nokay there are people who follow the\nrules and there's nothing too weird\napart from my validation but but there's\nsome people that do it perfectly and\nthere's some people that go off peace I\nwould prefer that we keep a type because\nit's it's part of it it makes them fun\nuh okay and and whoever goes first\ndoesn't matter we can do back and forth\non each question all right the first\nquestion is\num what is the best advice you ever\nyou've ever received heard or given\nthere's room for everyone Chelsea\nHandler told me that oh that's like one\nof my first days of work oh that's too\nmuch sorry no that's perfect\nthere's room for everyone that's cool\nprioritize the inner life my mom taught\nme that I love that both great answers\nvery tight and very precise makes a lot\nof sense all right uh second question\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nheard received her door received if he\nloved me he would because I'm gonna ask\nyou to complete that for me if he loved\nme he would we always say if somebody\nloves you enough they will do anything\nand everything and I think that that's\njust not it's such an unrealistic\nexpectation that we've been told for\nyears and years and years and I think\nit's it's it's problematic that's you'd\nlove that one got another episode on\nthat all right Raquel right before I\nmoved to LA 12 years ago I was living in\nChicago and someone said to me you're\nmeant to stay here you know the grass\nisn't greener on the other side it's\nGreener where you water which I think\nthat statement can be true in certain\ntimes but you know I disagreed with that\nperson who is a big voice in my life at\nthe time I wrote about it in the book\nand I thought no my piece is telling me\nthat I'm you know meant to go to La and\nI think a lot of times when people are\nclose to us we can\nlisten to their advice and actually go\nwith it but listen to people but then\ntrust your inner voice great great okay\nso yeah it was bad advice because they\nwere asking you to stay and I I thought\nfor a second I was like maybe I will\nstay but no uh question number three\nwhat's the biggest lesson you've learned\nin the last 12 months compromise is a\nbeautiful thing\num\noften hear that word and they think\nyou're selling yourself short I think it\ncan be a very beautiful thing all right\nRaquel when you're living a life of\nIntegrity you'll always sleep peacefully\nat night wow\nI think I had a lot of moments this past\nyear like career stuff different things\nthat happened or you know people say\nthis or they said that and it's like no\nI know who I am I had to say yeah I'm\nwatching you through that season of Life\nyeah as a friend it was I was she was so\nadmirable to just see anybody that was\nin that situation could have really\ncrumbled and really you know been\nshaken up by everything that was going\non and it did not Raquel she knows who\nshe is she knows the person she knows\nher character and she was not like it\nwas just it was really cool to see\nbecause you really do like I mean and\neverything that's in the book like you\nreally these are this is how we live our\nlife and it's in those moments when\nyou're faced with these situations that\nit comes into play and like you really\nstrong question number four what's your\nfavorite day each in this book that you\ncan't wait when they when people get it\nfor them to read is there a specific day\nthat like out of the hundred days that\nyou both like feel is one of your\nfavorites that you can't wait for people\nto get to I'm a big fan of catch a\nvision I love I make vision boards every\nsingle year\num so I think catch a vision is one of\nmy favorites I I can't remember exactly\nwhich day it was but um the one on\nforgiveness I wouldn't expect you to\nremember 100 days catch a vision is day\n54. yeah yeah the catch a vision is day\n54 and then which one was your one\nforgive I'll forgive someone 63 yeah\nyeah um so forgive someone on page 63\nthank you Jay for reminding or for\ntelling us page 63 day 63. um you can't\nlive a life of freedom without being\nable to forgive and so I forgive\neverybody and everything\num sometimes that's a little more of a\nprocess sometimes it's easy\num but it is essential to live a happy\nlife beautiful all right Fifth and final\nquestion for both of you we I we failed\non this fight we've been chatting away\nno no no no no no but I've been asking\nI've been asking no no no no you haven't\nfelt at all it's I always get intrigued\nby um\nand they I asked people to answer them\nin one word or one sentence because then\npeople get really thoughtful and then\nyou can really get into it uh okay Fifth\nand final question if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow what would it be I mean I\nalready thought of mine oh all right but\nit goes along with the book but I would\nwant either no filters or anything on\nsocial media or people it has to\num like say what was used on this photo\ndo you know what I mean because I think\nas a young girl you're looking at all\nthese photos and they've been\nphotoshopped and they've been put\nthrough so many filters and you don't\nyou don't see that so it's like if these\nplatforms would tell you how much work\nwas in put in this photo I think it\nwould relieve a lot of these\nexpectations that we put on ourselves so\nI think either removing all those or\nhaving like to disclose what you used on\nyour\nphotos and video that is great we've\nnever had down the show ever I love that\nyeah that's really good Tony yeah I\nthink because I do I think that there's\na lot that goes into our our psyche that\nwe from scrolling that you don't even\nrealize is going into your psyche that's\nvery problematic so if it's just all out\nthere you want to use your whatevers use\nthem but just tell tell people I love\nthat one um mine would be uh don't judge\nand I heard Maya Angelou to quote her\nagain she said something along the lines\nof if you're a human being you could\nnever say of another human being I'm I\nwould never do that because if you were\nliving their life circumstances if you\nwere in their shoes you would maybe be\ncapable of the same and so I think we\nhave to be very slow to judge each other\nand we need to give a lot more love a\nlot more compassion beautiful answers\never on the book's called the Sunshine\nmind hundred days defining the hope and\njoy you want uh Tanya rad and Raquel\nStevens let you go and grab a copy of\nthe book I'm so excited for my friend\nfriends one of my favorite things is to\nuse my platform and Community to support\nmy friends and people that I love people\nthat I think are bringing amazing energy\ninto the world and these two wonderful\nhumans are doing just that so I hope\nyou'll show them all your love all your\nsupport all your energy and excitement\nit would mean the world to me and thank\nyou both for your time and energy on on\npurpose thank you for your time Jay this\nmeans so much to us and this has been\nincredible yeah I could sit here forever\nall day literally by having too much fun\nyeah no really really appreciate it like\nhonestly can't say thank you enough\namazing I love thank you thank you Jay\nthank you if you love this episode\nyou'll really enjoy my episode with\nSelena Gomez on befriending your inner\ncritic and how to speak to yourself with\nmore compassion"
