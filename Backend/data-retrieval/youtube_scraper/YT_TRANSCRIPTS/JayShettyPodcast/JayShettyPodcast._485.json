    "transcript": "when we asked our original participants\nin our study you're 80 years old now\nwhen you look back on your life what do\nyou regret the most more than anything\nmany of them said I wish I hadn't spent\nso much time worrying about what other\npeople thought the best-selling author\nand host the number one Health and\nWellness podcast on purpose with Jay\nShetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou that come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now I know that you're\nhere because you want to improve your\nhappiness you want to improve your\nhealth and you want to improve your\nhealing and there are certain guests\nthat I always love having on the show\nthat I have on multiple times and\ntoday's guest this is their second\nappearance and I couldn't be more happy\nto speak to them because they also have\na new book that I have been eagerly\nwaiting for since I met them I'm talking\nabout the special Robert waldinger a\nprofessor of Psychiatry at Harvard\nMedical School director of the Harvard\nstudy of adult development and\nco-founder of the lifespan Research\nFoundation Dr waldinger received his a b\nfrom Harvard College and is MD from\nHarvard Medical School Dr waldinger is a\npracticing psychiatrist and\npsychoanalyst and he directs a\nPsychotherapy teaching program for\nHarvard Psychiatry residents he's also a\nzen master and teaches meditation in New\nEngland and around the world and Robert\nis the co-author of the book The Good\nLife Lessons From the world's longest\nscientific study of Happiness this is\nthe book that I want you to go and order\nthe good life lessons from the world's\nlongest scientific study of Happiness if\nyou've ever heard me talk about the\n75-year study of Happiness if you've\never read that article it's quoted\nabsolutely everywhere this is the man\nwho completed that 75-year study I\nbelieve the fourth of the researchers\ninvolved in that program I couldn't\nrecommend this book more Dr Robert\nwardinger or Bob and I met in Montana\ncourtesy of Arthur Blank who brought us\nall together at his beautiful Ranch in\nMontana introduced us to probably some\nof the most amazing people in the world\nin this space we instantly connected a\nbecause I geek out on research and\nscience but more importantly because we\nboth had this meditation and mindfulness\npractice that we both deeply love and\nbeyond that we just had a natural\nflowing conversation so Bob thank you\nfor coming back thank you for flying in\nfrom Boston to New York to do this\ninterview it's so good to see you again\nwell it's a treat to get to see you\nagain yeah uh I that that's the big\nincentive for me to get on a plane and\ncome here to see you no but I appreciate\nit I want you know my community\nappreciates it I was just saying to you\nearlier that we made this rule for on\npurpose again where we only wanted\ninterviews to be physical because I miss\nthis like I miss looking at someone I\nmiss being able to hug someone I miss\nbeing able to have even the before and\nafterwards when you do a zoom interview\nyou lose the before and afterwards\nyou're there for the interviewing you\nwhereas we've been talking for the last\nhalf an hour already and so I wanted to\nhear from you because you said something\ninteresting to me you said you know I'm\nsure someone's studying it you're not\nstudying it yet let's think about that a\nlittle bit what do you think is gained\nor what can be done meaningfully through\nZoom or virtually but then what is lost\nin your opinion in your thoughts and\nfrom your intuition on that yeah well\nsome of the most important things are\nabout accessibility like what we're\nfinding is that people who can't be\ntogether physically obviously can be\ntogether online or people who are\nfrightened so you know I'm a\npsychiatrist and many people are really\nscared to talk to someone about their\nproblems well what if you could be in\nyour own home and you could just dip a\ntoe in the Water by by trying a video\nchat with with someone who's a\nprofessional and I've seen people do\nthat with huge benefit so in that sense\nthe accessibility is wonderful that's\nsuch a great answer people in remote\nareas and all of that\nwhat's lost I think are just what you've\nbeen describing this the Casual\ninteractions that we have and that we\nlove that we take for granted I mean\nit's a reason why you know people talk\nabout the water cooler at the workplace\nor the coffee machine it's where people\nrun into each other and they have these\nlittle conversations that might turn out\nto be hugely important might turn out to\nspread ideas or give people a glimpse of\na person they find interesting who\nthey'd never met before and so those are\nthe things I'm afraid that we're losing\nyeah remotely yeah I think that's a\nbrilliant answer and I love the\nI love the perspective that there's\nactually a positive and a challenge to\nevery situation in life and if we lean\ninto the positives it can be more\nmeaningful it can be more powerful and\ninstead of obsessing on the negatives\nbut\nlet's let's talk about the 75-year study\nfor anyone who doesn't know about this\nstudy could you just give us a quick\nsynthesis or synopsis of what you're\nlooking at the types of things that\nyou're assessing the types of behaviors\nand then of course the more scientific\nresult that you gain from doing that\nstudy so what's wonderful for me about\nthis study is that it has followed the\nsame people for their entire adult lives\nthat's completely unheard of in the\nhistory of science it just doesn't\nhappen so we started with people who\nwere teenagers and followed them for now\nwe're about to enter our 85th year\nuh We've followed people for 85 years\nmost of the original people have passed\naway as you can imagine of course but\nwe've started studying their children\nwho are all Baby Boomers and what's\nunique about it is to be able to see how\nlives really unfold\nnot how we remember them because if you\nthink about it when we try to remember\nwhat happened to us\nthere's there are big holes in our\nmemories right and we get creative about\nyou know I'll make up stuff and then\nlike my my wife will correct me and say\nno it didn't happen that way and she's\nalways right yeah and so I think to to\nbe able to follow lives forward and not\nknow what the outcome is going to be is\njust amazing so so that's the the big\npicture we started it started in 1938\nwith two studies that didn't even know\nabout each other a group of Harvard\nCollege undergraduate students who were\nchosen by their Deans as fine upstanding\nyoung men and in a study of how people\nwere going to develop from adolescence\nto Young adulthood they thought maybe\nthis study would go for 10 years they\nnever dreamed I'd be talking to you\ntoday about the studies still going 85\nyears later the other was a study of\nboys from Boston's poorest and most\ntroubled families in the 1930s because a\ngroup of researchers were interested in\nwhy some children from really difficult\nbackgrounds stayed out of trouble how\ndid they stay on healthy developmental\npaths and so we studied a group of young\nmen who hadn't gotten into trouble even\nthough their families were plagued by\npoverty and illness and crime and all\nkinds of difficulty so those two we've\nstudied together two ends of the\nspectrum and now fortunately we've added\nwomen we started out with all white\nmales because that's what the city of\nBoston had in 1938 for research just to\nstudy and fortunately more than half\nwomen\nmore people from different backgrounds\nlots of immigrants so we're very excited\nabout this kind of diverse sample that\nwe've grown into tell us a bit about the\nfindings over the 75 years now obviously\n85 but tell us a bit about that core\nfinding because I think the most common\nfinding that stated is that in this\nHarvard 75-year study that when you look\nat the indicators of human happiness the\nquality of our relationships was seen as\nthe number one indicator was there a\nnumber two was there a number three or\nwas it just so far out like tell us a\nbit about the findings and then we'll\ndive into the number one finding right\nwell the biggest findings were about\nrelationships but also about taking care\nof our health taking care of our bodies\num one of our study members said take\ncare of your body\nas though you're gonna need it for a\nhundred years and so what we do find\nand many other studies find is that\ngetting regular exercise eating well\ngetting decent sleep getting regular\nmedical care if you can all of those\nthings not smoking not using alcohol or\ndrugs not abusing at least that all of\nthose turn out to have huge effects on\nhow long we live how healthy we stay but\nthe surprising thing was what you named\nwhich is this finding that the people\nwho stayed healthiest and lived longest\nhad the best and the warmest connections\nwith other human beings when we started\nseeing that in our data we didn't\nbelieve it because we thought well how\nyou know okay I mean if I have nice\nrelationships it'll keep me happy or\nsure but how could it actually keep me\nfrom getting arthritis or type 2\ndiabetes or how could that be and so we\nand other researchers have found over\nand over again that this is the case and\nthat it seems to have something to do\nwith stress and that\nrelationships help us manage stress and\nhelp us manage powerful negative\nfeelings\num one of the things we all know is that\nall of us have stress every day right\nand sometimes really bad things happen\nduring the day we come home and we're\nupset what we find is that if you have\nsomeone who you can talk to at home or\nsomeone you can call up who's a good\nlistener who's a sympathetic listener\nyou can literally feel your body calm\ndown and what that means is you can\nliterally feel your body a physiology\nand chemistry come back to normal and\nthat's the main thing that we think\nrelationships do for us understood so\nyou're actually saying that not only do\npositive relationships help us\nmonitor stress and maybe regulate stress\nbut challenging relationships can\nactually cause health issues too yeah\nthe other the opposite is also true very\nconflicting conflictual relationships\nyeah so challenging can be good right\nand that actually doesn't\nbreak down our health but relationships\nwhere there's abuse relationship where\nthere's constant\num unhappy arguing and relationships\nwhere difficulties never get resolved\nthose take a toll because they keep us\nin what we call a fight or flight\nresponse you know the fight-or-flight\nresponses are natural response where if\nyou get scared your body prepares to run\naway or to fight or meet with a\nchallenge that's meant to be temporary\nwe're meant to come back to Baseline to\nEquanimity if we can't do that\num then we're in trouble there's one\nthing I love about this book is that\nit's practical it's scientific it's\nthoughtful it helps us come back to our\nEssence it's also simple in the sense\nthat it\nkind of kindly nudges us and reminds us\nto go back to what we already know but\nthat we keep neglecting and there's this\none study that you call in the book and\nyou say in a 2000 survey Millennials\nwere asked about their most important\nlife goals 76 said that becoming rich\nwas their number one goal 50 said a\nmajor goal was to become famous now\nthat's in 2007 and I think if that study\nwas done now those things would still\nhold true to a greater degree\nand then you say more than a decade\nlater after Millennials spent more time\nas adults similar questions were asked\nagain in a pair of surveys Fame was now\nlower on the list\nbut the top goals included things like\nmaking money having a successful career\nand becoming debt free\nhow do we when we talk about the good\nlife which is such a\nelusive topic for so long you know I\nfeel like we've been studying the good\nlife through culture through\nspirituality through Philosophy for\nthousands of years but the amount of\nadvancement we've made in that Pursuit\nis very little compared to going to the\nmoon or going to space or\neven health care for that matter I think\neven Healthcare from a physical\nHealth perspective has had so much\nacceleration but our understanding of\nthe mind and the heart still seems to be\nfairly Limited\nand when you see those goals you see\nokay that's what people are aspiring for\nwhat is\nsomeone who's living the good life\naspiring for because I think we often\nthink of a good life as these habits but\nwhat is a good aspiration if the\naspiration is not money not fame not\na successful career well the aspiration\ncan be different for different people so\nthey've they've done research on this\nand and they they have these different\ntypes of well-being there's one called\nhedonic well-being which is\num what we all think of as as just\nenjoying a good party a good meal having\na good conversation I'm really enjoying\nthis conversation right now I'm having\nhedonic well-being right but other\npeople uh well all of us to some extent\nwant also a sense of purpose and a sense\nof meaning it's\ncalled you demonic well-being the best\nexample is you have a small child who\nyou read to at night before bed and\nyou're reading the book good night Moon\nand your child wants you to read that\nbook for the eighth time and you are\nexhausted right\nuh is it fun uh no but is it the most\nmeaningful thing you could imagine doing\nabsolutely and so this sense of I'm\ndoing this because I love it because I'm\non purpose because I care deeply about\nwhat I'm doing that's a different kind\nof well-being\nand then there's a third kind that\nthey've begun to identify witches\na psychologically rich life so many of\nus value just having interesting\nexperiences going to new places doing\nthings we've never done before so those\nthree things having a good time now\nfeeling like I'm doing meaningful\nactivity and feeling like I'm having\ninteresting experiences those are all\nflavors of Happiness right and I think\nthat each of us is a mix of all three\nbut some of us really want one more than\nthe others is it meant to be balanced or\nis it that is there a hierarchy of needs\nthere or how what have we learned about\nthose two areas well there's officially\nthere's no there's no right or wrong way\nbut what we know and I think we know\nthis from spiritual Traditions more than\nthan my science that when we do uh\ninvest in things outside of the self we\nare happier and we're happier for longer\nand we feel more of a sense that why\nlife is worth living so I would say that\nwe need to be sure we have some of that\nso we don't end up looking back and\nsaying gosh I wasted my life I feel like\none of the most difficult things for a\nlot of people today is self-awareness\nin being aware of what we think is good\nfor us what we think is right for us I\neven had a friend say to me yesterday\nthey said to me yeah I think I'm\nactually going to say no to that\nopportunity now because I realized I was\nonly going to say yes because of what\npeople thought\nand so you see that a lot where so many\nof our choices and our decisions are\nbased on what other people think is good\nfor us or what other people think is\nright for us I remember growing up and\nonly wanting to Aspire for things that\nother people rewarded so if the most\ncelebrated and respected person in my\ncommunity growing up was an actuary for\na career I wanted to be an actuary at 10\nyears old but if you ask me what an\nactuary did I had zero idea exactly and\nI think that this idea perpetuates so\nwhat can we do to get closer to knowing\nwhat is good for us so that we can truly\nlive a good life yes well and I just\nwant to I just want to emphasize what\nyou said because when we asked our\noriginal participants in our study\nhundreds of them we said when you know\nyou're 80 years old now when you look\nback on your life what do you regret the\nmost\nmore than anything many of them said I\nwish I hadn't spent so much time\nworrying about what other people thought\nand that's just what you're naming so\nthen the question is well what could we\ndo to change that and\nI think what I've learned more and more\nin my own life is simply to check in\nmore with myself about what are the\nthings that raise my energy\nwhen I engage in them and what are the\nthings that lower my energy so maybe\nlike doing Actuarial work might might\nlower your magic can you imagine oh I\ndon't like this oh my God so and and\nsome people actually embark on courses\nof study and then realize how did I get\nhere I don't like this and so I think\none of the things we can do every day is\nsimply to pay attention to that that\ninternal sense of being enlivened or\nbeing depleted by activities that we're\ndoing during our day and really pay\nattention to that and when you can turn\ntoward the activities that are\nenlivening yeah I often say to people\nit's like reflecting after you go to a\nrestaurant so what do you do when you\nleave a restaurant you talk about the\nfood you talk about the Ambiance you\ntalk about the service and you're like\noh I really like that dish but I didn't\nlove that one and oh the waiter was so\nwonderful he was so helpful all and I\nreally like the the design and the\naesthetic of that space right so you\ntalk about it uh when you order in you\ndo the same thing when you go to watch a\nmovie or a TV show you do the same thing\nwe go oh yeah that actor's performance\nwas amazing or the actress was\nincredible or or that scene I'll you\nknow that was brilliant like we analyze\nthings but I find that we don't analyze\nour lives in the same way like when you\ngo to a sports game you could spend the\nwhole day talking about it or if\nsomething happens to another couple in\nthe media or if something happens to a\nfamous person in the media we will\nanalyze it for days and weeks and months\nbut when it comes to our own lives we\nrarely pay that attention as a\npsychiatrist and why is that why is it\nthat we can obsess over these external\nbig or minute like we we either obsess\nover these tiny experiences of food and\nmovies and entertainment or we'll talk\nabout other people's problems for hours\nand hours and hours but when when it\ncomes to our own we've really struggled\nto say you know the argument we had last\nweek like let's just reflect on that for\na second right right maybe maybe it\ntakes us back to the actuary problem\nwhich is which is that we are we are so\ntrained from the time we're small to\nrespond to rewards to respond when\npeople say you know good girl good boy\nthat was a good thing you did right and\nso so we are trained to respond when\npeople praise us we're trained to\nrespond when people correct us\num and we're not trained to look inward\nyou know you have a deep meditative\npractice you have done a considerable\namount of training to look inward to\nnotice what arises in the moment I've\nspent a lot of my life on a meditation\ncushion as well doing that it's a\nradical practice but you don't have to\nmeditate to do this right we know you\ncan be walking along the street you can\nbe looking at a beautiful tree and just\nstart checking in with where you are and\nwhat's coming up for you but we have to\nlearn to do it and that's the thing that\nI think we don't learn enough as we're\nas we're growing up yeah what what are\nsome of the things that we should reward\nor not should but what are some\nhealthier things to reward in one\nanother to create a healthy relationship\nif we're trying to create these positive\nrelationships in our life what would be\nthe things that\nwe should encourage and reward and\nrespect\nI think we should reward people taking\nrisks with us you know if someone says\nto me\nI was upset when you said that my first\nreaction is to get defensive and say\nwell no no you know to to excuse myself\nbut I've learned that sometimes what\nreally helps is to say thank you for\nbeing willing to tell me that right so\nif someone will take a risk with me I\nbegin to say oh that's a gift and when\nthey do and when they take risks and\nwhen I take risks\nour relationships deepen you know\nbecause if if we trust each other and we\nrealize we can trust each other that\nthat you're not going to come back and\ncriticize me you're going to be curious\nand welcoming when I tell you about\nsomething difficult\nso I would say let's reward each other\nfor\ntake going out on a limb for for taking\nrisks with us\num let's reward each other for trying\nnew things\num instead of just doing the same old I\nmean most of the time\nwhen someone in our world tries\nsomething new we're like shocked like\nthat's not what I expect from you and so\nit takes a minute to reorient and say oh\nthat person is trying something\ndifferent that person is is taking a\nrisk is challenging themselves and so I\nwould say let's\nlet's applaud that when we can I mean\nunless they're doing something yeah yeah\nbut you know yeah let's applaud the\nthings that where people are trying to\ngrow yeah some of the things that other\npeople do that trigger us I feel us so\nmuch because\nwe are not allowing ourselves to do\nthose things\nlike I had a friend recently who's\nmoving country and he was telling his\nfriends how some of our friends that\nhe's moving country and everyone just\nhad negative things to say they're like\nwhy would you move now like kids are too\nold they're already in school like it's\na tough time for them like it's gonna go\nwrong or you're gonna come running back\nand and we were talking about this and\nit's exactly what you're saying that\ninstead of rewarding that he's trying to\ndo something finally after all these\nyears that's true to himself\nhe is receiving a lot of this backlash\nfrom around him and it discourages him\nit also I think what people don't\nrealize is that it not only discourages\nthe person it distances you from them\nbecause now you've not been a part of\nsomething that's significant to them in\ntheir life I I remember you know when I\nI've moved to Country I've moved State\nand every time I've done that when\npeople have not been able to\nbe a part of that decision with me it\nmakes me feel less understood by them if\nthat's accurate and I think this feeling\nof being understood is what you were\nspeaking about earlier that we're all\ncraving someone that you can pick up the\nphone to and have that meaningful\nconnection with how do we help\npeople understand us better\nand how do we learn to understand other\npeople better because if understanding I\nI mean when I look at relationships I've\nrealized that I think Jamie McGuire says\nthat she says love is an overused word\nand I've often added to that that I\nthink love is an underdefined word\nand as I've been on my journey to really\nunpack what is love between people\nI often come to words like it's not even\ngratitude or or care it really comes\ndown to things like safety and\nunderstanding when I think about love\nI'm like yes safety and understand if\nsomeone feels safe around someone that's\na sense of love and I mean emotionally\nsay physically safe mentally safe and\nthen if I feel understood by someone\nwhere I don't have to explain like you\ndidn't really have to explain to me that\nyou were talking about what kind of\nthings someone would be doing as a risk\nbecause I understand you and I think\nthere's safety in the understanding so\nhow can we understand people better and\nhow do we help people understand us\nbetter one of my meditation teachers\ngave me uh an instruction just to try as\nI meditated and he said especially when\nyou're sitting there and you've done\nthis meditation a thousand times or or\nyou're washing the dishes you know for\nthe 3 000th time right when you're doing\nsomething ordinary he said ask ask\nyourself the question what's here now\nthat I have never noticed before\nand what I find with relationships\nparticularly the relationships with\npeople we think we know so well right\nour partners or the old friend or my\nboss is to ask that question what's here\nthat I've never noticed before and then\nto share it you know I never realized\num that you enjoy this or you know I\nlove those sneakers and I I you must\nhave taken some care to pick them you\nknow anything but their birthday gift\nrecently absolutely yeah yeah they're\nvery cool yeah but just to notice right\nand so what I think what I'm what I'm\ngetting to is curiosity to let ourselves\nbe genuinely curious about people\nincluding the people we think we know so\nwell\num\nthey've actually done a study of this\nwhere they they looked at how tuned in\nwe are to each other when we first start\ndating someone and then after we've been\ntogether as a couple for four or five\nyears and what they find is that when we\nfirst start dating we are much more\ntuned into each other than we are when\nwe've been together for five years\nbecause we think we know create what for\nus when we're dating we're like oh\nwhat's this going to be like and is this\nperson into me and you know and so we or\nwhen we make a new friend and and so I\nthink really the question is can we\nMuster that interest and that Curiosity\neven when we've been together a while\nand we know this person that is such a\ngreat example that's that's a brilliant\nstudy I'd love to take more of a look at\nthat because I think that's such a great\nexample of exactly how that diminishing\ncuriosity creates diminishing results in\na relationship and I call that concept\nuh in in my reflection of a new old and\nold new so when I meet someone new I try\nto find out something old about them uh\nthat because we might have that in\ncommon maybe it's a city we lived in\nmaybe it's a country that we both love\nmaybe it's a Cuisine and like it's\nsomething that's inbuilt to us and then\nwhen I had known someone for a long time\nand I consider them an old friend let me\nlook for something new in them as you're\nsaying and so I call it new old old new\nand it's always been my way of thinking\nabout it because I you're so right there\nis always something new you can learn\nabout anyone even if you deeply think\nyou know them and I think that with my\nwife today we've been married for six\nyears and together for ten so it's it's\na long enough time of our entire life\nand I feel like I learned new things\nabout her every day and I think what's\nas important is learning new things\nabout my wife every day is unlearning\nmisconceptions I've had about her from\n10 years ago so there are things that I\nwas so sure about who my wife was a few\nyears ago\nand at the same time as I have to learn\nthe new things I have to say well wait I\nhave to unpack that old idea I had about\nher that's not why she thinks that way\nor lives that way this is the reason\ncurrently that she lives that way I\nthink we find a lot of it's challenging\nto feel that people are changing\nit's challenging to feel that we are\nchanging and it's challenging to feel\nthat people that we love are changing\nhow do we think about\nallowing ourselves to change and people\nto change because that seems to be the\nhardest thing in marriage and friendship\nlike I'll have friends who'll say to me\nlike Jay you've changed now I don't\nthink that I I think I've I think in my\ncore values and how I construct my life\nI just I think I'm actually pretty\nsimilar yes I don't think I've changed\nthat much\nmy external life has changed for sure\nobviously since living is a monk and\nthen after and then and then where How I\nLive Now but I I think I live with the\nsame purpose and the same intention but\nhow do we allow people to change and\nallow ourselves to change you know that\nis actually the core of my spiritual\npractice so as you know that if you\ndon't mind yeah no I want you to go\nwherever you want to go yeah core of\nBuddhism is this the truth that\neverything is always in the process of\nchanging right and that some some things\nwe can't see the rate of change because\nit's so slow and some things are\nchanging in an obvious way but\nwhat Buddhism teaches me is that one of\nthe great sources of suffering in my\nlife is when I try to hold on to things\nthat are changed when I try to fix them\nwhen I try to freeze them and what\nyou're describing you know with your\nwife when you're just what we're\ndescribing with a friend of I'm trying\nI'm trying to keep you in the same\ncategory I had you in 10 years ago yeah\nright so important to really let\nyourself notice what is what's evolving\nwhat's different and same same with\nourselves and that yes maybe our core\nvalues stay the same but even that we\nexpress them differently I mean\num we talked with some of our study\nparticipants when they were in their 30s\nabout how they were expressing say a\ndesire to take care of their family and\nof course what they did in their 30s to\ntake care of their families was very\ndifferent from what they did in their\n80s and so the values stay the same but\nthe behavior the expression can change\nand so all of these things are just can\nbe sources of endless interest and\ncuriosity yeah and I think it comes with\nthat expectation right that when you\nmeet someone\nyou'll hope\nsubconsciously is that they're going to\nstay this way forever yes it's almost\nlike when you meet\na two-year-old and they're just adorable\nand you're like I hope this child just\nstays this way forever because you find\nthem you know cute and fun and playful\nor whatever it may be and it's the same\nwith our partners when you meet your\npartner you're like God they're perfect\nthe way they are right and that idea\nthat someone is perfect right now is\noften the issue with progress because\nthey are going to change you're also\ngoing to realize how imperfect you both\nare\nand and I think letting go of that\nexpectation is what's so difficult it's\nalmost like when you when you buy a\nphone or you buy a physical item\nit may be perfect but you know it's\ngoing to get knocked it's going to get\ndropped it's gonna you know it's gonna\nneed an upgrade it's okay so we we\naccept that to some degree but with\npeople which are these Dynamic vibrant\nenergetic beings we almost like no no be\ntechnology like you know it's it's it's\na weird mindset and I I wonder how we\ncan really learn to let go of that like\nit's a constant I think it's a constant\nprocess right yeah because our minds do\nwant to hold on to expectation certain\nexpectations certain images we would go\ncrazy if everything were always up for\ngrabs yeah right like at least I knew\nroughly who I was going to find when I\ncame to see you today yeah thank\ngoodness but\nthe other side of that is just what\nyou're saying that we need to keep\nlooking and see well you know I haven't\nseen you in three years and and how are\nwe each different now and that's a hard\nthing to keep doing but yeah but just to\nremember I think as you're pointing out\nthat we want things to say stay the same\nand so it's going to take some effort to\npay attention to the changes that are\nhappening all the time yeah I think one\nof the biggest relationships speaking\nabout the good life\nand talking about relationships I think\nas as we know through research through\nstudies so much of our expectations as\nwe were talking about our beliefs about\nlove about relationships come from our\nfamily and often I find today that the\namount of people that say to me that\ntheir family is toxic or they experience\na really negative\nenergy from their family like I hear\nthat over and over and over again and\nI'm sure I'm sure you hear it more and\nmore and more and I find like families\nthat were meant to be people's places of\nRefuge of\nsacredness\noften people don't feel that way now I'm\nnot saying that it's all the families\nfault either I think there's\nresponsibility on both sides and it's\nit's a complex matter\nbut how does someone navigate what\nshould someone be thinking about if they\nhave family members or a family member\nthat causes them a great deal of stress\npressure and insecurity like how does\nsomeone not what is some what should\nsomeone be thinking about what what\ncould someone ask how do they reflect on\nthat perhaps first to reflect on the\npositive someone once told me you know\nno one will ever care about you as much\nas your family will care about your\nwell-being and and I know there are\nexceptions to that but basically these\nare the people who are your people and\nso if if there are ways to preserve\nthose ties it is worth it sometimes it's\nnot sometimes people need to walk away\nfrom their families of origin I totally\nget that but but to at least be sure\nthat what's there to be\ninvested in has been appreciated right\nbut then often what what gets families\ninto trouble is just what we're talking\nabout which is the problem of allowing\neach other to grow and change I mean I\nhave a son who's in his 30s and who gets\nangry at me when I ask him well you know\ndo you need a warmer coat when you go\nout today where and he says Dad I'm in\nmy 30s why do I you know and I and I\nstop and I say oh you know if you hadn't\nbeen so dependent on me when you were\ntwo years old if you hadn't trained me\nto worry about these things we'd be fine\nyeah he's he's saying to me dad\nrecognize that I'm grown up right yeah\nand often the difficulties we have in\nfamilies are the difficulties of people\nnot allowing each other to grow and\nchange into who they they are at this\nmoment I mean what if your family had\nsaid you have to be an actuary and if\nnot you are a failure so yeah so I think\nso I think what you're saying is is\nright that that yes many families are\nfilled with this kind of strife and\noften it comes from this difficulty\nrecognizing that we are all changing and\nthen allowing each other\nto to change and grow I find that a lot\nof generations today are obviously more\nopen to therapy more open to these types\nof reflection I find that\nwhen I speak to some people that I know\nthat they may find that certain older\nGenerations are like well what's the\nneed for therapy what's the need for\nthat like you know everything's okay\nlike we can figure this out it's a\nFamily Matter again there's truth on\nboth sides in different ways right but I\nguess I think one of the biggest\nchallenges is that a lot of people it's\nlike when you're young you always feel\nthe adults don't get it when you're an\nadult you feel like the kids don't get\nit right like that's like and everyone\nand the funny thing is we all experience\nit it's like there's that famous quote I\ndon't know who said it but it's um the\nday you realize your parents were right\nyour kids will be telling you that\nyou're wrong like I don't know yeah it's\nbrilliant yeah it's so good uh and I\ndon't know who said it but I always\nthink about that I'm like oh it was so\ninteresting when I was young I used to\nthink this of when I'm 35 years old and\nI was like oh that's what I used to\nthink of 35 year olds or someone with\nthat opinion now that I'm 35 I'm like oh\nI think this differently how do we it's\nlike I'm asking questions here that I\nknow there aren't any\nconclusive answers to but I think\nthey're important questions to ask it's\nlike how do we live a life where we've\nrealized that\nfrom a different Vantage Point you're\ngoing to have\ndifferent beliefs and almost opening\nyourself up and not stereotyping an 18\nyear old or stereotyping a 21 year old\nor stereotyping a 60 year old or a 70\nyear old like I think we have\nstereotypes about like oh well you know\nand I'm like well wait a minute when I\nwas this age you did the same thing and\nwe you know that kind of thing like when\nI moved it's like what you just said\nabout the\nyour son and the coat it's like my when\nI moved I moved country when I was 28 so\nI moved from the UK to the US when I was\n28 years old and my mom was so scared\nfor me and I was like Mom you moved to\nLondon when you were 16. like you left\nshe left like\na country where there was a war in Yemen\nbetween uh the yemeni and and the\nBritish and then she left and moved to\nEngland\nuh during that time and I'm like you\nleft a war-torn country at 16 years old\nleft to follow my purpose and passion\nand you know like at 28 like you did\nsomething way harder but you're so\nscared for me and I know that that's\nlove of course I know that that's love\nbut it's interesting how\nit's that you took the biggest risk and\nyou kind of don't even want me to take\nthis one right because hard to imagine\nto to reimagine ourselves at an earlier\nage in a way yeah let's talk about that\nit was quite capable as she must have\nbeen as a 16 year old and I'm sure it\nwas incredibly hard and she managed one\nof these so we uh in our lifespan\nResearch Foundation we developed this\nprogram that you were actually part of\nhelping us imagine oh I love this in\nMontana it was we call it road maps for\nLife transitions where we have five\nsessions where we bring some of these\ninsights from our Research into small\ngroup sessions that people can really\nlearn from and use and the first session\nwe asked people to bring a photograph of\nthemselves when they were half as old as\nthey are now\nand then they go into small groups and\nthey show each other their photograph\nand that the assignment is to tell each\nother okay what did life look like to\nyou when you were the person in this\nPhotograph and how has life changed how\nhas your view of Life changed now and it\nreally underscores that difference\nbetween well this is what it was like\nwhen I was 16 and leaving Yemen and this\nis what it's like for me now and then\nshe gets to think oh my 28 year old son\noh it I may have more of a sense now of\nwhat life is like for him but it's a a\nkind of active re-imagining of Life at a\ndifferent from a different vantage point\nfrom a different time I love that\nexample and I remember that exact\nconversation we had because I talked\nabout how like all my work is dedicated\nto helping people make life transitions\nyeah because I think that's where all\nthe pressure the stress like when you're\njust getting married or you're just\ngetting divorced when you're starting a\nnew job or leaving an old one when\nyou're moving country or moving home\nlike that's where could you share more\nabout that program and some of the\ninsights in the book that what are other\nways that people can reflect on life\ntransitions in a healthy way so we do\num a session where we ask people to\nclarify their values you know as you ask\npeople to think about all the time and\nwe ask well what are the two or three\nvalues that you couldn't imagine living\nyour life without\nand then we say map out a typical week\nin your life and and write down where\nyou can express these values and some\npeople are really shocked that they're\nnot able to bring their values into much\nof their daily life we do another\nsession where we ask people to map their\nrelationship universe and say well who\nare you close to who would you like to\nbe closer to who have you had troubles\nwith but you'd like to mend a\nrelationship we do another one where we\nsay actually it's the leaving Yemen it's\nthe we ask what are some of the biggest\nchallenges this the biggest transitions\nyou've had to make in your life so far\nand what were the strengths that you\nwere able to bring to managing those\nTransitions and then we ask you what do\nyou see coming down the road and how can\nyou use those strengths that you already\nhave to anticipate dissipate meeting\nthis next challenge that's coming along\nI love that question because I think I\ndo that subconsciously all the time\nwhenever I'm going through a new\nchallenge I automatically reflect on an\nold one yeah and think to myself how did\nI get through that when I got through\nthat like I was telling you about\neverything went through surgery I was\nthinking when was the last time I in\nthree surgery I was like okay when I was\nsix I dislocated my wrist I mean I can\nbarely remember it all I remember is I\nwas in the park I was swinging on the\nthe monkey bars or whatever they're\ncalled I fell on the last one because I\nwas going too fast and I fell on my\nwrist and I dislocated I was in agony\nparents had to rush me the hospital had\na cost on my arm for like three to six\nmonths everyone was writing on it in\nschool but I got through that when I was\nsix like and I was like well maybe I\nhealed faster at six so I was like okay\nand then when I was 25 26 I had polyps\nin my throat which had to be lasered out\nI had to eat through a straw I couldn't\ntalk for six months so I I practically\nlost the sound of my voice the texture\nof my voice had changed I'm now back to\nsounding how I used to before if not I'm\na little bit deeper which is great uh\nbut but that was pretty tough because I\nwas an adult already and yeah going\nthrough that was challenging and so I\nwas like okay when I was going through\nthe surgery I was like okay I've got\nthis like I've done hard things before\nand and that gave me more strength as\nopposed to like I'm going through a new\nsurgery it's brand new I've never been\nthrough anything you know so\nI I think that's a really really great\nactivity and and I love hearing about\nthese practical exercises uh because I I\nthink that that's what we need we need\nto make things tangible and visual yes\nand I think we need to remind ourselves\nof some of the things that we take for\ngranted like I didn't know what that\nsurgery was going to be like and I and I\nwas okay I calmed myself down I went\ninto it I came out fine you know it's\njust kind of like I did this I did this\nyeah and we need to remind ourselves of\nthe hard things we've already done yeah\nand this time there's one thing that\nwent the other way so whenever anyone\ntalks to me about anesthetic right or\nanesthesia whenever I have to do one of\nthese surgeries I've\nalways had a positive experience with it\nbecause I'll pray and meditate a lot\nbefore a surgery naturally and then when\nI come out I find that those few seconds\nI don't think I've ever talked about\nthis but the few seconds that I'm like\ncoming out of the the effect of\nanesthesia I have like really powerful\nspiritual experiences like some of my\nfavorite spiritual experiences that have\nhappened in those moments and this time\nthe the opposite happened I actually\ncame out of it with something called\natelectasis which is a partial collapse\nof the lung and I couldn't breathe for\nlike a week and so I was like gasping\nfor air and it was so funny because I\nwent into it so positive hoping that I\nwas going to have another amazingly\nspiritual experience and when I came out\nthe other side I was I was just about\njust about alive uh and and yeah it's\nit's but I like that idea of and I think\nI would love to ask that to my mama\nactually I would I would love to ask her\nto reflect on her strengths because I\ndon't think she's probably done that I\nthink she just sees it as that's what we\nhad to do or that was normal\nor what else could we do like they just\nsee it as they just see it as like well\nthat was the natural journey of life and\nI'm like no it wasn't mum you could have\njust stayed where you were but you did\nsomething very brave and\nI I think reminding our parents of that\nand reflecting with our parents on that\ncould be really powerful so yeah I love\nI love those activities right I I wanted\nto ask you going back a bit to the\nfamily piece what are the negative\neffects on our health when there's\nsomeone in our life\ncould be family could be a partner could\nbe a friend that's there but they're\ncausing continued issues or challenges\nor I think there was this beautiful\nquote you had in here from John\nSteinbeck you said a sad soul can kill\nyou quicker far quicker than a germ and\nand I know that that can be you know\nsometimes it can be your your own soul\nbut um the idea that there's someone in\nyour life that's like it's almost like\nif we were doing this interview and\nthere was like a constant tapping like a\nconstant tapping we could probably still\nget by because I'm focused right but\nthere's an irritation there's an\nagitation there's some sort of\ndistraction that's going on I think\nsometimes people feel that in their life\nthat I'm trying to get on with my life\nbut there's this like recurring thing\nthis person this individual what a talk\nto me about what that does to our health\nlike how does that what does that kind\nof impact her so when does it impact us\nwell what we know is that sources of\nirritation are stressors and so it has\nthat long-term chronic effect on our\nbodies we we assume I mean I don't know\nthat anyone's studied\num you know a tapping noise and what it\ndoes to us although actually noise\npollution is one of those yeah cognitive\nload as well so yeah cognitive load so\nwhat we do know is that\nbeing in a chronically stressful\nrelationship does break down the body\nand that there have been a couple of\nstudies that have shown for example with\nmarriages that leaving an a really\nacrimonious relationship is better for\nyou than staying even though there it's\nvery painful to break up a long-term\npartnership and all that\nso I think that the the question then\nbecomes how do we discern when a\nrelationship uh should be worked on and\nwhen it's important to step away and and\nI think it's always a matter of wisdom\nof bringing wisdom to this to say how\nmuch do I have invested you know if we\nhave children if we've built a life\ntogether I'm going to work really hard\nto make sure I don't throw that away\nuntil I find that there's just no saving\nit right and people do that but on the\nother hand sometimes there are\nfriendships there are relationships that\nare just chronically irritating and they\ncan be stepped away from\nand more uh nurturing relationships can\nbe cultivated instead so so it really is\na constant matter of discernment but but\nI will say that I I don't want to\nAdvocate just being done with a\nrelationship because there are\ndifficulties because there are conflicts\nin every relationship of any depth right\nthey're going to be disagreements many\nof those disagreements can be worked out\nand working them out is a source of\ngrowth and can often strengthen the\nrelationship so it's important to try\nwhere you can to work out difficulties\nbecause the potential for benefit is\nhuge and I think that's the challenge\nright I think we don't have the tools\nto figure out difficult relationships\nit's almost like no one ever went to\nthat class there wasn't that class at\nschool your family has its own\nmethodology of how to like some families\nevery family has their own way of\ndealing with conflict subconsciously or\nconsciously so some people go just put\nit under the rug we forget about it we'd\nbe civilized some people say well we\nfight it out and then we never talk\nagain some people say we pretend to be\nbest friends but then behind their back\nwe talk bad about them right like I\nthink we all subconsciously have a\nfamily methodology of how we deal with\nother family members that we don't enjoy\nbeing whether we do enjoy being with and\nso our tools are often scarred by how we\nwere raised in previous experiences like\nwhat are some healthy tools to actually\naddress conflict in a relationship\nbecause I think that most of us when\nwe're raised we're raised to avoid\nconflict we're raised to avoid having\nthe uncomfortable conversation we're\nraised to like well don't go there or\nyou put someone in their place the\nextreme opposite or you tell them how it\nis right now neither of those things\nlead to better relationships I it was so\nfunny I there's someone in my life\nyesterday that I wanted to send a very\nclear message to\nabout\nsomething that I think\nI didn't appreciate about what they did\nfor me and it came actually because so\nmany people were telling me so it wasn't\neven my own thought I didn't even have\nthat bitterness inside of me I didn't\neven care I'm so in love with what I do\nbut then I had like three people in the\nsame week point this thing out to me and\nsay did you see what this person did\nlike and I know them and they were like\nyou see what this person did like I\nthink you should tell them do you want\nme to tell them I think you should tell\nthem and so I was being egged on and\nwhenever I'm egged on by an idea that\ndoesn't come from within my own\nintuition I always have to check whether\nit's aligned with my intuition and I\nthat's like a practice that I've had for\na long time it's like is this idea mine\nor is this idea someone else's like do I\nreally believe this or am I being made\nto believe it because someone felt like\nstarting a little fire\nand I literally wrote out the text\nand then I pressed delete and I said\nthis is not my idea this is I don't\ngenuinely care I'm gonna let this go\nfunniest thing happened that evening I\ngot a message yesterday I got a message\nfrom this person\nit wasn't about them apologizing for\nanything but they came back with so many\nwonderful ideas they were coming at me\nwith so much good energy they were they\nwere out and they were they were\nsomewhere and they were like gee I saw\nthese things and I thought of you and I\nwas like wow like you know it's just I\nwas just about to send this message and\nthis person's thinking about me off\ntheir own accord they're not apologizing\nthey don't think they've made a mistake\nbut they're bringing good energy my way\nand so the reason I'm showing that whole\nexample is just I think we don't have\ntools one tool for me is always is this\nhow I genuinely feel yes or is this just\nhow someone in my life feels about this\nperson and I'm borrowing that emotion\nwhat are other tools that we can use to\ndeal with conflict and issues better in\nour in our important relationships well\nfirst of all I love what you just named\nbecause I think I I have been egged on\nby other people as well and then and I\nalways regret it and so taking that\npause do it delete is really important\num another tool for that I've found is\nso important for me\nis to take a Long View so what do I want\nwith this person in the long run right\nsix months from now three years from now\nwhat do I want do I do I not care if\nthey're out of my life and so it doesn't\nmatter how I handle this now or do I\ncare do I want to make sure that we're\nokay because this person brings energy\ninto my life because I care about this\nperson because it means that I will\nadjust my response depending on the long\ngame if you will what I really want out\nof this relationship and so\num and usually what that means for me is\nwhat you and I were talking about before\nwe started this interview which was\nideally everybody needs to win right\nthat there ideally there's no loser and\nno winner and so if I want to make my\npoint and score one uh so what and the\nother person ends up feeling bad or put\ndown it leaves us both uh disconnected\nand in a bad place so\nhow then to to create a scenario where\nwe talk about something that's a problem\nbecause if I just suppress the problems\nI'm gonna grow more resentful and that's\ngonna be its own difficulty and\nseparation and so how do how do we talk\nabout problems in a way that will allow\nus both to get to a place of feeling\nlike we've won we've gained something\nand and ideally we're closer yeah and so\nusually for me that means\nwriting the angry email and then\npressing delete and then sleeping on it\nmeditating on it and what one of my\nteachers once described as strike while\nthe iron is cold yeah wait till the hot\niron cools down that's great and then\nthink back okay now how do I feel about\nthis and how would I what would be the\nmost skillful way to talk to this person\nabout it yeah and so those are some of\nthe pointers that I have to keep using\nwith myself when I'm all riled up about\nsomething yeah is that is that kind of\naligned with your idea of being\nreflective versus reflexive like that\nlike exactly yeah exactly yeah no that I\nI love that long-term thinking I think\nthat is such a great question because\nwhat feels right right now\nmight not feel right then right and I\nthink that's how we often play it we go\nwell they need to understand this and\nthey need to learn this and they need to\nknow this\nand it's like yeah they could maybe\nappreciate and digest that if you strike\nwhile the iron is cold but when you\nstruggle iron is hot for a conversation\nlike that you actually end up completely\nalienating that person and pushing them\naway I had a client the other day who\ncalled me and said\nyou know my\nmy boyfriend's about to come back in you\nknow it was like it was 9 00 p.m and\nthey're like my boyfriend's about to\ncome back from work in half an hour and\nI just found this information out\nabout his previous relationships and I'm\ngonna ask him\nand I was just like okay wait first of\nall who did you get the information from\nand she said oh it's just someone that\nknows him you know someone that used to\nknow him a few years ago I was like okay\nthat doesn't sound like great\ninformation\nuh I said second what's he been doing\ntoday\nshe was like oh he's been at work he's\nbeen with his family he had like a event\nhe's been preparing for a wedding for a\nfriend's wedding this weekend like I was\nlike do you think now's the right time\nto have that conversation like he's had\na long stressful day\nlike is this the right time\nand I'm sure he'll be open to it but\ndoes it mean it's ideal\nand and they were like no I don't think\nso and I was like okay so we've got two\nno's so far and then I was like do you\nagain then there was the third question\nthat I asked like do you even believe\nthat this is true like is this even your\ninstinct from your\ncontact with this person they were like\nNo And I was like well then you were\njust about to go and create another huge\nargument that didn't need to happen and\nyou could talk about it later on in a\nbetter way I think the long term is\nbrilliant another thing that came to my\nmind when we were talking about this was\nthere's a great book called culture code\nby Daniel Coyle and he quotes Popovich\nwho I believe is a basketball coach a\nvery successful basketball coach so is\nmy basketball level of knowledge and\nwhen he would give feedback to his\nplayers he had a really fascinating way\nof giving feedback which would encourage\nthem to grow and then they looked at\nstudies and they found that when\nexaminers gave their students feedback\nin this way that the students performed\nbetter\nand so this type of feedback had three\nkey areas to it the first\nand and I tried and I really try and\npractice this in my life because I think\nthat not because it's a good technique\nbut because I actually believe it's true\nso the first was that\nyou make someone aware that you of your\nstandards like you make someone aware\nlike like this is the type of life I\nwant to live this is the type of company\nI want to build this is the type of\nrelationship I want to have so when I'm\ntalking to my wife I'll often say to her\nI'll say you know I want a relationship\nwhere we're both happy and joyful and\nsupporting each other that's the\nrelationship I want to have\nand it's like no one can argue with that\nand that's a long-term view right like\nwhat you're saying it's a long-term view\nof me saying I want to have a healthy\nrelationship that's the kind of\nrelationship I want to be in do you want\nto be in that relationship too and of\ncourse right or like I want to build a\ncompany with purpose\nthat is impacting the world where people\nare happy to be at work every day right\nand so do we all want to be in that so\nthat's one thing setting a standard the\nsecond thing is reminding the person\nthat you're speaking to that you trust\nand you believe that they can rise to\nthat standard\num\nI I know you want this too and I know\nyou can be there I I know that you can\nactually I know that if you want that I\nknow you can have that like I I know\nthat we can have that together so it's\nnot like a teacher it's it's together\nand then the third thing is saying you\nknow what are we both willing to do to\nget there now that we know we want to be\nthere right we trust we can both get\nthere what are we both willing to do to\nget there and I think when you think\nabout relationships that way you go oh\nwow things could be solved\num you know if you if you had a\neffective conversation and I often say\nto people use us and we not you and me\nyou know there's such a like you versus\nme whereas us and we brings us together\nso I'm glad I'm glad we went there\nbecause I just think that there were I\njust think we've never learned these\ntools and it and it upsets me because I\nagree with you that I think so many\nrelationships are lost too early yeah or\nor they've they die early even if we\nlive long in them yeah and that's even\nworse you know you know there's there's\na whole movement to provide what's\ncalled socio-emotional learning for\nchildren right where they they create\nyou know curricula they create classroom\nsessions where they talk about this is\nwhat feelings are this is what it's like\nwhen you have an argument with a friend\nwhat are the ways you can deal with your\nargument with your friend\num you know how do you manage these\ndifferent difficult things in your life\nand what they find is that when they\noffer these programs to children they do\nbetter in their academic subjects they\ndon't get into trouble as often in\nschool they don't get involved with\nalcohol and drugs as much I mean all\nthese things that flow from these\nemotional skills and social skills that\nare being taught and and many times when\nthey give teachers these programs to\nteach their children the teachers will\ncome back and say we need this for us\nplease yeah I mean it may makes sense\nlike you think about so much of your\nwork life is interpersonal skills as\nopposed to just functional things right\nlike and I often think like if you get\nalong with someone you can work with\nthem and Coach them and get it right but\nif you don't get along with someone it's\nvery hard to put in the time to get it\nright and and I find that more and more\nand more like\nI think for a long time I worked with\ncompanies where I worked in companies\nwhere people were hired for their\nproficiency or their skills\nand they weren't hired for their\nattitude\nand you could tell how that affected\ncompany culture where if someone had the\nright attitude they could learn the\nskill right but if someone had a poor\nattitude no matter how skilled they were\nit could be damaging to a work\nenvironment right and and when I was\ninside large organizations I could see\nthat very clearly you talk about in this\nbook something called Social Fitness and\nin keeping our relationships in shape I\nwas thinking what do we how do we know\nhow do we become aware of this first of\nall the Social Fitness of a relationship\nor our social Fitness and how do we keep\nour relationships in shape well this\nthis concept sort of came out of our\nfinding that many people felt that they\nweren't spending time with the people\nwho were most important to them and in\nfact that was one of the big regrets\nwhen people looked back on their whole\nlives they said I wish I had spent more\ntime with family and friends\num and so I started thinking about it\npersonally and because I can spend a lot\nof time working and I can spend a lot of\ntime just on email just you know as we\nall can right there are just so many\nthings we could do all day long\nand I began to realize that unless I\nactively exercise those social muscles\nand by that I mean if I actively keep in\ntouch with my closest Zen buddy who\nlives across town but I don't get to see\nenough\nif I don't make the decision to call him\nup and say let's go take a walk let's go\nhave a coffee if I don't do that the\npath of least resistance for me is to\nstay home is to do another piece of work\non a Saturday afternoon and so what\nwe're talking about is this idea of\nbeginning to prioritize uh nurture it\nkeeping up relationships rather than\nassuming that they'll take care of\nthemselves yes the idea being that you\nknow I used to think well my best\nfriends are my best friends and they'll\nalways be that way and and my\nrelationship with my partner is going to\nbe fine because it's good now it'll\nalways stay fine we know that's not true\nthat unless we really invest in having\nnew experiences in Long relationships in\nin reaching out and devoting\nsome of our time to keeping those\nrelationships alive it's not going to\nhappen on its own so rather the path of\nleast resistance unfortunately can be\nsocial isolation and and more screen\ntime and so we're talking about social\nFitness as a way to get people to think\nabout it like like going to the gym you\ndon't yeah you don't go to the gym one\nday and say good I'm I'm done I've done\nthat right you think okay I'm going to\ndo that over and over again and we would\nlike people to think about their\nrelationships\ntalking about introverts and extroverts\nin that social isolation sense it's like\nI think we've also made this\nvery clear as a society that we're\nsocial animals we need to be around\npeople Etc and then we meet people who\nare surrounded by people or appear to be\nvery popular but still feel alone and\nthen you meet people who are\nsingle and feel incomplete and then you\nmeet people who are happy and Solitude\nand they they enjoy spending time with\ntheir own like\nwe're all different we all need\ndifferent things but can introvert how\ndo introverts find a sense of healthy\nSocial Fitness and how do extroverts\nalso find a sense of healthy Social\nFitness because extroverts often appear\nvery socially fit but if you ask them\nthey may feel quite depleted and\nintroverts may like you said potentially\nrely on isolation because they don't\nwant to step out so how can we think\nabout that differently boy it's such a\nit's such an important question I mean I\nthink what we realize is that from our\nwork that everybody whether you're an\nintrovert who who wants just a small\nnumber of people in your life or an\nextrovert who loves lots of people that\neverybody needs a sense that somebody in\nthe world is there for them that there's\nsome emotional safety net\num we asked our original\nstudy participants\nat one point\nwho could you call in the middle of the\nnight if you were sick or scared and\nsome people couldn't list anyone and\nsome people could list quite a few\npeople\nwhat we know is that if you're an\nintrovert you might just need one person\nin the world like that but you need\nsomebody\nand if you're an extrovert you might\nhave more people but you might only need\none person\nthe extrovert who's lonely in a crowd\nprobably doesn't have that person\nand that's what we're really so I think\nwhat and this is this comes under the\nthe professional rubric of of security\nof attachment that everyone needs to\nfeel securely attached securely\nconnected to at least one other person\nkids need it but we need it all the way\nthrough lives all the way into old age\nand so I think if if someone can find\nthe way to make sure they have a nurture\nat least one of those relationships\nthe rest is probably much more easy to\ntake care of absolutely\neveryone I've been talking to the one\nand only Robert wardinger the book is\ncalled the good life lessons from the\nworld's longest scientific study of\nhappiness I hope you go and grab the\nbook as you can see one thing I love\nabout speaking with Bob is that he's\ngreat into weaving science and\nspirituality you know he has this\namazing Zen background but then also as\na psychiatrist I love meeting people who\nare at the juxtaposition of two\nseemingly opposite ideas but actually\ntwo things that flow beautifully\ntogether uh Bob is there anything that I\nhaven't asked you that you really want\nto share or something that's on your\nheart or mind or in your intuition that\nyou'd love to share with everyone I'd\nlove to give you that opportunity okay\nwell I'll just State something that's\nobvious but might not be obvious all the\ntime which is that in this quest for\nhappiness for the good life\nit's easy to imagine that it's possible\nto to be happy all the time nobody on\nthe planet is happy all the time and and\nthe reason I have to say that is because\nwhen we look around as we see you know\nadvertisements and social media where\npeople are smiling and and having look\nlike they've got life all figured out\nnobody has life figured out all the time\nevery day and I just want to name that\nso that you know that that life is\nfilled with Joys and sorrows and ups and\ndowns and that that you are not having a\nbad life if there's a mixture of joy and\nsorrow and boring days and and ordinary\ndays in your life I I love that reminder\nI think that's such a beautiful thing\nfor all of us to remember because you're\nso right our external projection is that\nsomeone else has it all together whoever\nthat may be and none of us do this uh I\nlove that thank you so much uh everyone\nwho's been watching back at home or if\nyou're traveling if you're on the move\nyou're at work wherever you are\nlistening and watching please do tag us\non Instagram on Twitter on Tick Tock let\nus know what you learned what you took\naway when you grabbed the book I want\nyou to take pictures of the book tag me\nto let me know what line you've read\nwhat moved you because I would honestly\nsay that the questions this conversation\nmade me ask were deeply personal you\ncould see I was reflecting like these\nare the things we need to spend more\ntime on and these are the things that we\nneed to\nfocus more deeply on because these are\nthe things that are so simple that we\nmight just miss them right they're\nthey're right there in front of us and\nso you might just ignore them so thank\nyou so much for listening thank you so\nmuch for watching a big thank you to Dr\nRobert warding as well Bob thank you for\nmaking the trip out always a pleasure\nthank you so much thank you if you love\nthis episode you will also love my\ninterview with Charles duhigg on how to\nhack your brain change any habit\neffortlessly and the secret to making\nbetter decisions"
