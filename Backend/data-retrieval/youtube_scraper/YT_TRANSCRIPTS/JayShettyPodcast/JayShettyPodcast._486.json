    "transcript": "I don't stay stuck and I don't stay\nthere I can tell that I'm almost like no\nyou got to get over that really fast\ndon't blame people for stuff don't stay\nstuck get on with it get out of bed put\none foot in front of the other start\ndoing dishes you'll start feeling better\nI promise the best-selling author and\nhost the number one Health and Wellness\npodcast on purpose with Jay Shetty\nJay I think you were one of the like\nvery first people who graced us with\nyour presence on our show you know like\nwe were such a new show and nobody\nwanted to talk it was\nthe height of the pandemic people really\ndidn't know what to say I get it I\ndidn't know what to say I was like I\nfeel like ironically isn't the world\ntelling us to be quiet and listen and I\nhave to go find my voice right now I\nknow it feels very cute\nbut you were kind enough\nand I you know I get it it's like I\nthink there was probably like what is\nthis show and why would we want to talk\nabout stuff you know right now\num but there was also such a need for\ncommunity at that time but I just thank\nyou for coming on so early and daring to\ncome on something that we ourselves were\nliterally in establishment mode we were\ntrying to set it up for success in the\nway that like we wanted it to be\nsomething we loved and believed in but\neverything was going to have to be done\ndifferently yeah definitely you know in\n2019 when we were making the show was\nnot going to be that show\nbut what did we keep what did we change\nhow do we pivot how do we move forward\nso thank you because oh no it makes a\ndifference when people see you coming on\nthe show then they think oh that's safe\nmaybe I'll try that well no I mean thank\nyou no I was actually so grateful that\nyou thought of me and invited me and the\nteam reached out to me I was so looking\nforward to connecting with you I think\nyou just have such a positive presence\nin everything you do and your energy\nready it's when I met you backstage I\nwas telling my team because Paul was\nhere with me last time when we came in\nperson Helena wasn't and I was saying to\nthem backstage I was like that\ninteraction we had had the lights been\non Backstage I would have shared it\nbecause it's such a special interaction\nlike the energy you greeted me with and\nthe warmth that you had for me I was\njust like wow I feel like I'm meeting a\nlong-lost friend and it was just such a\nspecial moment and no one got to see\nthat it was totally behind cameras but I\nwanted people to know because that's who\nyou are and that's how you appear to\neveryone and approach everyone whether\nyou go backstage on camera off camera\nwherever you are and so I saw that\nbefore and I'm so grateful I got to see\nin person I think it's also good to be\nwary of people who are different in\ndifferent places and rooms you know that\nwas always something like growing up in\nthe job that I did\num there was a lot of performative uh\npeople\num who were different in different rooms\nand then there were people who were\nattitudinally\num different in different rooms and it\nwas like a very interesting juggling act\nto see like why is this person different\nnow here as opposed to in the other room\nwhere they oh they were performing they\nwere doing a job that's why they're\ndifferent why is this person a little\ndifferent\nhere or there oh it's because of the\nperson oh that's interesting so they\ndon't treat everybody the same\nnoted where are you on where are you\nrelaxed where are you utterly yourself\nwhere it so human behavior was always\nlike so fascinating for me because I was\ntrying to gauge like what kind of human\ndo I want to be so I was always looking\nat everybody's you know actions to sort\nof put on the sifter\num of like what do I want to keep and\nwhat do I want to just go away and fall\nto the bottom how early do you think you\nstarted to do that because I think that\nthat's a skill that we develop over time\nand I like what you said that it's not\nas simplistic as saying oh well that's a\nbad person it's like no that's their job\nthey're performing they're working and\nthen sometimes it's the person sometimes\nit's the profession but how early did\nyou start noticing and observing very\nearly my mom also was like I started\nworking 11 months old but I I remember\nmy mom was part of this 11 months oh\nyeah in a diaper not a euphemism and\nliterally I started my job in a diaper\nIt was a commercial and people thought\nthat like E.T was maybe my first job but\nit wasn't by a long shot I had done a\nlot of TV films a lot of commercials and\neven a feature film so I felt\ncomfortable at that point when I went\ninto ET so I'm I feel lucky that I was\nblessed that I wasn't like a quivering\nlamb in the field like I was always very\nemboldened as a kid I I had\nso much like Moxie I feel like I'm\nprobably a lot more shy respectful and\ncautious now as an adult when I was a\nkid I was so Fearless\num but I remember my mom was a part of\nlike this theater group at uh the Lee\nStrasbourg Institute who's a very famous\nacting teacher he taught Paul Newman and\nMarilyn Monroe and Al Pacino they were\nall a part of like his\nyou know I wouldn't even know how to put\nit but group\num and she was doing a play there and I\nremember like this one woman who would\ngo in the back every night before her\nplay and she would just lay on this\nstage in a quiet room and like beat her\nchest and cry out so primal\nand that was such an interesting thing\nto witness as a kid I was like oh that's\nhow she does it like that's how she gets\nherself to be emotional and cry\num so I was always clocking like whether\nit was how to do this job or really I\nwas hyper aware ever since I can\nremember about how people treated each\nother a lot of cliches is like oh if\nsomeone's like rude to a waiter like\nthat was me as an like infant I was so\nupset and put off by people who weren't\nnice to everyone\num and there were plenty of people in\nthe job that I was in that were a little\ncoddled and you know but then I also saw\npeople who you thought wouldn't be shy\nbecause they were a performer but they\nwere\num so I was like well don't hold that\nagainst them that's just their real\npersonality like I'm thinking I'm gonna\nget this big flamboyant and gregarious\nyou know loud person and they're not on\nright now they're turned off and who\nthey are is actually this very gentle\nquiet Soul oh you're the world's\ngreatest comedian but you're kind of\ndark and Moody okay that wasn't what I\nwas expecting nor is it what I want but\nI have to accept that's who you are yeah\nokay interesting so you're observing\neverybody so you can make fun of it all\nbut if you let people in you won't be\nable to you keep a guard up on purpose\nunderstood so I guess I was just always\ntrying to figure out like why people did\nwhat they did but I still to this day\nlike cruelty arrogance rudeness\nshort-temperedness is just I don't have\ntime for it and even worse if I am ever\nguilty of those things oh my God I take\nmyself to task probably worse than I\nwould anyone else yeah that's it's hard\nisn't it you've reminded me of when I\nwas in the monastery there was one monk\nwho was known for being pretty negative\nand being that way so he had this\nreputation where he would always be\nnegative he'd be rude to people he'd be\nyou know he had what you're kind of\ndescribing like there was a bit of\narrogance there was a bit of Bravada\nthere was a bit of rudeness uh lack of\nsensitivity everything that you're\nmentioning and it's really interesting\nbecause I used to really annoy me\nbecause I kind of have a similar trade\nto you where I don't appreciate someone\ntreating anyone\nuh special or not special or good or bad\nyeah and and I think it's a hard thing\nto manage when you're a busy individual\nso I'm getting getting in your sense\nit's very difficult so I would often\ncomplain about him because he was always\ncriticizing complaining and comparing\nand so I would often complain about him\nto the other monks I'd be like this guy\nlike you know he's just always doing\nthis what's this Monk's deal literally\ncan you imagine like that's literally my\nquestion I know and it was really\ninteresting because there were two sides\nto this and I want to hear your thoughts\nto this\none thing one of the monks said to me he\nlooked he looked at me and he said what\ndon't you like about this individual and\nI said he's always comparing complaining\nand criticizing\nand he said to me what are you doing\nright now\nI said I'm comparing companies\nand there's like this like moment of\nlike I had become who I was Madison how\ndid you stop yourself is my question\nbecause you're very mindful you've\nalways I've seen you the few moments\nI've spent with you or whether we've\nmessaged it's always been wonderful how\ndid you stop yourself from letting that\npain get so make you cold or make you\nharsh to that person also I think it\nmade me more kind and empathetic and and\nyou know I also grew up in a job that's\nlike heavy on Gossip or can be and rumor\nand hearsay and stuff and I found that\nin my life everybody loves an\ninteresting story I mean where all of\nour ears perk up when we're like think\nwe're gonna hear something a little you\nknow salacious a little crazy a little\nsomething it's something to kind of\nMarvel at but I realized that I I am not\na gossiper you know like I'm more I'll\nkeep your secrets\num and it was sort of the same thing\nI've corrupt\num around a lot of people who also kind\nof talk trash about people and I was\nlike I do not want to be around that nor\nbe that person so it also made me\nlike gravitate towards people who didn't\ndo that\num and it's funny you said because you\nknow we get busy and we have a lot of\nresponsibilities so I can get sort of\nintense or it's seemingly short-tempered\nbecause I'm tired and I'm trying to kind\nof barrel through things like me too you\ndo absolutely yeah for sure okay that is\nso refreshing to hear 100 like I asked\nmy wife because I was gonna have my wife\non the show yeah I know I love your wife\nso much I mean you two were put on this\nplanet like you are Freud's Imago Theory\nlike two people who look alike are drawn\nto each other in a mirror-like sort of\nlook in the water you know and see your\nown reflection and not based in\nnarcissism it's based in like a\nfamiliarity no it really it's a\nbeautiful Theory\num and no so in those moments I I'm\ntired I'm exhausted I seem a little Curt\na little short-tempered a little intense\nI I would say 99.9 percent of the time\nI never think I'm right for being that\nway and I will find myself maybe\njustifying here or there and even as I'm\ndoing it I'm like you are so full of\ncrap right now I really hold myself so\ncritically accountable for\nwanting to go okay well then you can't\ntake this water back and put it in the\nbottle it spilled all over the floor so\nhow about next time try to remember\nsomething about this that can be like a\ntrigger so that you can handle it\ndifferently I think so much of my adult\nlife is becoming about the Mastery of\nreaction knowing it's beautiful and the\nonly thing I can control I cannot\ncontrol and I work really deeply with\nthis therapist who I I I just I respect\num he's honestly one of the smartest\nindividuals I've ever met wow like I'm\ntalking like one hand like a true voice\nand he quit me at one point like that's\nhow you know High Road this human being\nis he doesn't deal in toxicity if you're\nnot getting better he's not feeding off\nof that and thinking well this person's\ngonna stay with me for many years he's\nlike our work cannot not actually occur\nhere so I'm going to step away and I was\nlike God you're good I love you even\nmore I respect you so much and I fought\nto break a cycle and a pattern that he\njust after eight years was like I I\ncan't do this anymore and I it was\ndrinking and I when I was about two\nyears and I'm I'm not sober I don't work\na program I have I'll call in my house\nlike I party with my friends you know I\nso I'm not when I say I don't drink\nalcohol it's just like a one-lane choice\nof realizing something that didn't work\nfor me I thought I would Master my whole\nlife I don't I can't so after I had\nstopped for about two years because\ndrinking was like a symptom of many\nproblems but it was the thing that was\nnot allowing me to get to those next\nplaces I asked him will you please uh\nreconsider taking me back I've put in\ntwo years I'm not stopping I'm feeling\nreally good\num this isn't for anyone else it's not\nfor you it's for me I know that's what\nyou've always wanted it if you do things\nfor other people it's so dangerous they\ncan just take it away it's a burden it's\nyou know there's no ownership in doing\nthings for other people when it comes to\nthat really crucial work\num because you I love doing things for\nother people it's just a matter of and I\nthink I'm a total codependent like with\nmy kids like yeah they're my whole\nSource of Life joy happiness and you\nknow motivation so be it I'm a\ncodependent who cares like\nbut I'm also my own individual they're\ntheir own individuals and we've got to\ntake care of our side of the street so I\nasked could we go back to working\ntogether and uh we did and now we're\ndoing the best work we've done in 10\nyears and a lot of the work I do with\nBarry now so much of this word comes up\nwhich is inner\nand that's not something even though I\nthink I was really in touch with\nspirituality when I was a teenager it\nwas so much a part of like my salvation\nand raising myself and getting\nemancipated at 14 and living on my own\nand being an adult my whole life and not\nhaving any semblance of like what\nsociety says kids are supposed to do\nwith like go to bed on time go to school\nlike eat a balanced meal all that stuff\nlike I just didn't have that in my\nuniverse\num but I love when Barry uses the word\ninner this Rich inner life I'm trying to\nbuild that is the place in which I can\ntap into reaction\num processing control all of those\nthings it's like there's really kind of\nonly one place that that truly can take\nplace and it's the inner world and I\nhave spent my life being an extrovert\nand going outwards and and that can be\nbeing a love junkie or being someone who\nloves to be playful and call it perform\nor just put myself out there or\naffection or jokes and humor or my love\nof human beings like it's all out out\nout and this is the first time that I\nfeel like I'm really much more\nexcited and ready to do this inner work\nand it's cool because it is it is the\nplace where you can do so much more\nbecause a lot of those things you want\nto do with the outside world are not\nreally possible or not really attainable\nlike control\nlike you know changing the way things\nare or someone out there or a situation\nor the World At Large these things are\nnot controllable but inside your world\ninside your inner self there's much to\nbe done yeah but it sounds like with\nthis over analyzing reflective\nself\nMastery work that you're doing it sounds\nlike at the same time is that there's\nalso a sense of self-forgiveness\nto be able to move on especially from\nknowing that as a child a you wouldn't\nhave known about the inner in that depth\nyou wouldn't have had the tools you were\nexposed to things as a child that 99 of\nchildren wouldn't be exposed to so\nthey've also seems to be a sense of\nforgiveness for today and also\nforgiveness for that time is that how\ndid you see that you know it's funny\nbecause I do think a lot of kids go\nthrough just crazy stuff absolutely yeah\nwhen I was in an institution for two\nyears that my mom put me in it was it\nwas an adult word too but it was also a\nkid Ward so all these other kids I was\nin with I was like well they're going\nthrough it too whatever their roads you\nknow took them to you know\nself-destruction or abuse of a substance\nor hurting themselves or being out of\ncontrol to the point where their parents\ndidn't know what to do with them\num a lot of that is usually cries for\nhelp and probably not their fault always\nyes of course um but I was like well I\nguess I'm not alone and you know trying\nto\nyou know I'm I'm not the only one who\nare experiencing what we see as\nextraordinary circumstances especially\nat a young age they're heightened and\nthey seem Wilder to adults\nyou're 14 or 13 and you're doing these\nthings like oh if you were in your 20s I\nguess that'd be more normal wow that's\nsuch a good point yeah I've never\nthought about it like that yeah and then\nI think about kids who are you know\nchallenged economically or are trying to\nget you know in somewhere or they have\nto take care of their families or their\nlatchkey kids or they're trying to get\ninto this country or they're you know\ndoing things that like again once again\nwe're saying oh this is not what\nchildren are supposed to do so I'm like\nconvinced that I'm one of many that just\nkind of had stuff to deal with that we\nwish ideally kids didn't have to deal\nwith but a lot of them are yes I just\nwas never taught like what forgiveness\nwas of myself\nbut I've learned along the way far ahead\nof self-forgiveness because this is a\nvery New Concept for me so it's Super\nFresh it's like an open wound and it is\nnot sewed up shut yet by any means I\nneed stitches and some isopropyl like\nI'm working on it but I always was\nforgiving of other people I didn't I\ngrew up in a very unjudgmental landscape\nyou know like For Better or Worse\nHollywood is real open-minded it's real\nliberal and I don't mean politically I\njust mean like artistic people are kind\nof like a Live and Let Live Group which\nis super cool and that was great growing\nup I was like oh so we can just kind of\nlet people be oh okay like cool\num they're not wrong for being that way\nthey're just eccentric or that's their\nlifestyle choice or that's their\norientation or whatever it was great to\ngrow up that way I I was always\nforgiving of other people and like\nopen-minded for like whoever they are I\nrealized later in life that it turns out\nthat I thought forgiveness was a gift to\nsomeone else\nyou forgiving them was giving them a\ngift\nI suppose it is\nI never knew that there is a an irony of\nall ironies of that you are finally\nliberated and you can't forgive to get\nto The Liberation because it's fake and\nyou don't get the reward you have to\ntruly literally go yes I with every part\nof me authentically and without wanting\nanything in return I'm not even thinking\nabout myself I just forgive I forgive\nyou I forgive this then all of a sudden\nyou're like oh no and now I feel really\ngood how weird but if I've ever tried to\nforgive something to feel better it\ndoesn't work yeah it doesn't work no\nit's not a technique it's not a button\nyeah no it's not a technique it's this\ntrue I also found the ultimate form of\nLiberation is change when you like\nstopping drinking from me and again not\nsober like don't that's not it yeah I\njust don't drink it's the only thing\nthat's you would that's my lifestyle\nchoice I was so held back by this one\nthing my entire life that I swore I\nwould master that why wouldn't I be\nconvinced of that I'm I'm\nnot capable of change because I couldn't\nchange it so I'm just a failure in my\ninner voice and narrative my only\nevidence in front of me is you're not\ncapable of change because you haven't\nchanged this thing and then once I did\nit was like finally I believe that I'm\ncapable of change and that's you know\nthese things are symptoms they're not\nthe only problem you can't like stop\nsomething that isn't working for you and\neverything else falls into place there's\na lot of work around it that has to be\ndone and Barry's Point wasn't like if\nyou stop drinking all your problems are\ngoing to go away he's like we just can't\nget to the work because this shame and\nguilt and like pattern is just is going\nto prevent us from getting to the next\nlevel so I'm out and I was just like God\nI love this so much and I knew he was\nright yeah your therapist quitting on\nyou is pretty that's pretty inspiring I\nknow because most therapists are like oh\nyou're still broken fantastic I'll see\nyou next week I'm I still have a job and\nso I think if you're seeking guidance\nwisdom therapy\nspiritual leadership whatever you are\nseeking out in this world if you sense\nthat person continues to feed and not\nhelp you grow and it's fine with you\nstaying in the same place I don't think\nthat's a good sign yeah but I love that\nemphasis you're placing that\nit wasn't ever about the external change\nit wasn't just about oh if you stop\ndrinking alcohol then all your problems\nare solved it was going on this inner\nJourney for you and I I wonder when\nyou're doing this you've brought up two\nreally important things you brought up\nshame and guilt and I think shame and\nguilt\ndeep down whether you meet someone who\nseems confident or whether you meet\nsomeone who's insecure shame and guilt\nare right there right even when someone\nfeels confident or is is acting\nconfident often there's a shame and\nguilt of some part of them they're\ntrying to hide and if someone's feeling\ninsecure it's because they shame and\nguilt themselves walk us through a bit\nabout how those two were these bad\nfriends of yours for a while and then\nyou were eventually able to let them go\nI'm just letting them go especially\nwe stopped with my mom\num you know I just I think most people\nidealize this sort of nuclear family\nand I just have felt pain and guilt and\nshame my whole life that that wasn't our\nstory all right our life experience\num it hurts me to know that like\nthere is pain there for her for me it\njust destroys me so I'm I'm working on\nthat\num because I'm like I'm 47 I can't I\ndon't mean to be morbid but I don't want\nto die carrying this with me like I I\nwill shift this it's time it's been long\nenough yeah I put enough time in so I'm\nworking on that with Barry right now and\nI'm making some really good strides and\nit's really hard you know\nI think\nthese things are not easy I I felt a lot\nof guilt and shame around drinking\nbecause like a lot of my sort of least\ndesirable experiences had probably\nsomething to do with me being drunk you\nknow so I'm like amazing that you would\nkeep doing something that like doesn't\nserve you\num I felt pain and guilt and shame every\ntime I did feel like I acted in a way\nthat wasn't as gracious and patient as I\nwish I could always be\num these are really go-to overly\navailable\nemotions that I am just like I can't be\nnearing 50 and still function like this\nso like you know it's like kicking out\nbad roommates you're just like guess\nwhat you are a sloppy horrible person\nyou have bad energy you're negative\nyou're messy and like I can't live with\nyou anymore like I want to get my own\nplace and keep it tidy and Jesus like\nhow have I managed to put up with this\nfor so long yeah it's like that's how I\nfeel inside my body and shame and guilt\nare roommates I've had my whole life\nthat I totally resent and like wish I\ncould just give an eviction notice too\nand I'm starting to like grow a pair and\nactually really take charge because I\nthink I know like\nI'm running out of time like we don't\nlive forever and nobody wants to think\nabout death or dying but it's an\ninevitability that we all share in\ncommon and we really don't even know\nactually when it's coming so there's a\npart of me that's just like I can't do\nthis anymore I'm fatigued I'm exhausted\nI'm desperate to know what the other\nside of this feels like you know we used\nto love 45 records and always the\npopular hit song was on the a side and\nthen we would play the B-side and be\nlike this song's actually awesome yeah\nI'm like what is the B side of my life\nwhat is the life that isn't so corroded\nwith self-loathing guilt shame beating\nup on myself all the time people are\nlike you seem so positive I'm like you\nhave no idea what I'm dealing with on\nthe inside it's so hard and heavy some\ndays\num but one thing that's I do I'm I am\nglad is I don't stay stuck and I don't\nstay yeah I can tell that I get I can\nhear that in what you're saying and how\nyou're saying it I'm almost like no you\ngot to get over that really fast don't\nblame people for stuff don't stay stuck\nget on with it get out of bed put one\nfoot in front of the other start doing\ndishes you'll start feeling better I\npromise like cleaning is a very\nspiritual act and put on a song and like\nall of a sudden you'll be shaking your\nbutt and like moving your body or jump\nin the rain yeah the endorphins will\nstart to come so I've had these\nfantasies of being Greta Garbo in my bed\nand my friends tending to my bedside or\ntalking on the side on the phone like oh\nwe're really worried about her you know\nit just doesn't happen because it's just\nlike I I just am like oh God like except\nfor funny enough with my drinking my\nfriends did do that they were like we\ngotta we gotta get in there and be\nhonest with her and that's true friends\nfriends who kick your butt and hold up\nmirrors to you or tell you when they\ndon't like what they see or want you to\nsee your reflection and feel good about\nit that's true friendship I'm all in for\ntough love so I I've been you know when\nwhen I was in the institution when I was\n13 they assigned me a therapist Dr\nGeorge Blair I'll never forget\nand they had these groups a couple\nnights a week where they would invite\nall the families and and they would put\nsomeone in the circle and they would\ntalk to their family very openly about\nwhat led to this crazy place we were all\nin and it wasn't like a rehabilitation\ncenter it was a full-blown like\ninstitution it was very hardcore it was\nmuch more One Flew of the Cuckoo's Nest\nit wasn't like promises and Malibu this\nwas like real deal North Valley like two\nyears of you're locked in there this is\nnot a place you're allowed to leave if\nyou try to leave they will deal with you\naccordingly and it's not pretty so but\nwhat they would do is they would have\nthese families sit around in a circle\nand they would encourage\num there was no Force but it was sort of\nyou know it was mandatory\nthey would sit that person down and they\nwould sit them across from their family\nand then all the families would sit\naround and they would talk honestly\nabout what led to them being here what\nwas missing what wasn't working with\ntheir family there was sort of like you\nknow non-aggressive confrontation about\nlike you know the parents were just as\naccountable as the kids\num it was incredible wow and it it\nshaped my life forever it wasn't like\nyou know we're all performers and we put\nit all out there like that wasn't what\ndid it yeah I am witnessing when you\ndon't sweep things under the carpet when\nyou do not let them rot and start to\nstink when you are willing to be brave\nand put it out there and discuss it out\nin the open\nit wasn't even in front of others it was\njust to find your voice and talk\ndirectly to that person I forever formed\nme it's like that was such an important\nlife Journey that would color my path\nfor the rest of my life and weirdly when\nI found out this show might actually\nhappen in 2019 I was like not only of\nsomeone who's been sitting on the other\nside of an interview chair my whole life\nand you kind of get fatigue on those\nsame questions like I was like what if\nthis could weirdly be a little like that\ngroup night that we would have a couple\ntimes a week where we just sit in some\nchairs in a group of people and talk and\nwe keep it real and a lot of it was\nreally funny people laughed it was\nheart-wrenching it was emotional it was\nhumorous it was insightful it was raw\nand I think I'm really having an aha\nmoment or an epiphany right now because\nI'm like am I running this show the way\nwe did in those rooms like it just was\nreally cool to find out that talking it\nout\nand being brave to tell your truths was\na good thing those sound like some of\nthe most\nspecial skills and tools that every one\nof us could use\nso early on and the fact that you feel\nyou're still using them after all this\ntime\nis pretty remarkable I have not\nassociated the two until this moment but\nI wasn't necessarily getting it from my\njob growing up that wasn't as much as it\nwas a like have all your emotions\navailable it was very structured in the\nwork\num and it was very spontaneous and\ncreative and free but it was for a\npurpose and if anything you were kind of\npretending to be a different person but\nlike pulling on your real emotions I had\nnever experienced up until that point\nanything like it and I've definitely\nconducted myself\nmy whole life since I got out of there\nas if I still go to those group nights\nlike I want to put it out there I wanna\nI wanna encourage other people to not\nsit on things but discuss it\num be bold\num and not afraid of what other people\nare thinking and feeling when they're\ndigesting your sort of deepest stuff\nletting out Secrets can be really\nliberating and I still feel like I have\nplenty and I'm just now like willing to\neven look at some like secrets\nand and being afraid of what people are\ngoing to think is is not good it's not\ngood at all what do you think was what\nmade it safe because I feel like that's\nwhat it is we think that environments\nneed to be loving or they need to be\ncaring but really it's a sense of safety\nthat we're looking for what made it feel\nsafe the truth the truth and the honesty\nand the lack of judgment\nit that's what made it safe that people\nweren't gonna nobody alienated each\nother no one treated each other less\nthan we went on business as usual we\nfelt like we knew each other better we\nwere in an environment where people\nliterally like\nkind of if you wanted to talk about it\nyou could if you didn't you didn't have\nto but like\nnobody made each other feel bad so I\nthink truth and not feeling judged or is\nis what least leads to safety\num one of the things that Barry talked\nto me about and I'll apply it to this\nalso is if you're if you're not feeling\nsafe how can you make yourself feel safe\nif if you're not getting that from\nothers how do you make it okay for you\nand I went on a date with this guy I\nthought it was the best date I mean it\nreally was it was like so good and\nI we made a plan for that weekend and we\nwere texting back and forth and it was\nso cute and I was like and I really\nliked him I was like what a nice guy I\nwas attracted to him I loved his job\nbecause he was you know\num in the news business and like I love\nnews and I'm like oh my God this is so\ncool I never heard from him again like I\nguess that's what you call getting\nghosted I was like whoa that is so oh\nwow that's so weird\num okay and I was talking to Barry and\nthere's this sex in the city where\nthis boyfriend of hers named Jack Berger\nbreaks up with her on a Post-It note and\nit became this pop culture phenomenon\nand the Post-it note reads I'm sorry I\ncan't don't hate me now we all took that\nand ran with that the line was I this\ncannot be the day I get broken up with\non a Post-It so they have this whole\ncrazy adventure but all of like pop\nculture and Society was like this is the\nworst thing ever\nI'm like Barry that is the most giving\nthing that I could ever ask for in\nmodern society being a single girl I\nswear to God\nthat's I'm sorry okay great I can't\nthank you now I know where you're at I\nknow to move on this is so informative\nthat I appreciate the gracefulness and\nthe graciousness of you like just\ntelling me there's no there there and\ndon't hate me okay I get it you're being\nself-effacing you know this is maybe not\nKosher but that's okay because it's your\ntruth you cannot be we can't be mad at\npeople because they're not what we want\nthem to be\nand I was like I just wish I could get\nthat Jack Burger Post-It note Barry\nand he goes well you can write it to\nyourself yes and I literally was like\nBarry you just took out all the\nfrustration anxiety uncertainty\nunfinished business lack of control\nhelplessness I feel I feel good I feel\nempowered I feel like when I got on a\nbullhorn and shared this wisdom maybe\nthis is\nit's like oh my God it was the biggest\ngift I could have gotten so I think we\ncan apply that to a lot of things it's\nlike I'm not feeling safe right now\nbecause I just told my truth okay then\nmaybe you can tell yourself why it was a\ngood thing why you are safe that there\nwill not be consequences that are\nunsurvivable that come out of this\nscenario and help yourself off the ledge\nby giving and fulfilling for yourself\nwhat we normally just tend to\nautomatically look outward and to others\nfor I think what you just said right now\nis not only great for someone who's\nreceiving that type of note but it's\nalso important for someone who often\npostpones that note\nso we know so many people that are in a\nrelationship that don't want to be in it\nbut they don't want to be seen as the\nbad person so they'll let it stay on for\nanother six months another 12 months\nanother 18 months and those people are\nin a prison correct they're in horrible\njail that they have put themselves in by\nnot dealing with that I have a question\nfor you yeah okay\nhow do you tell people\nto receive love I think I'm really good\nat giving it I'm great\nat giving it to my daughters and to my\nfriends but I've noticed how much of\nlike my history with the Romantic space\nI am\nso\nstuck and I'm the person who doesn't\nwant to be stuck\nand\nI don't care necessarily what others do\nor what happens I want to know what work\nI could do\nto take my walls down believe and trust\nbecause I am really trying to figure\nthat out right now I've sort of told\nmyself I'm okay I'm fine I'm lucky I\nhave two kids so I if it comes to and I\nhave these amazing friends and I have\nthese beautiful co-workers my cup really\nrunneth over\nto the point where like\nI don't feel like I need love I I'm I'm\nabundant\nI swear to God I'm still\nscared or nervous or I don't have any\ninformation\nthat shows me that that's a safe space\nso how do I do that\nI want to give you some tissues no\npressure\nwell my first answer is going to be I\nhave two two things one thing was what\nwould Barry say\nBarry can we call you in and like dial\nyou in right now uh I want to meet you\nbut no genuinely like what would he say\nI think obviously I'm sure he's shared\nsome beautiful wisdom and insight with\nyou a few things come to mind the first\nthing is I think that we've placed\nromantic love and I'm probably people\nmay not agree with this but I just want\neveryone to sit with this for a second\nand I really do believe that this is\nsomething\nyou will appreciate you'll be able to\nreceive I really do believe that and if\nanyone else doesn't please sleep on it\nplease think about it I really do\nbelieve that we have placed romantic\nlove on the pedestal\nand the number one position Podium of\nlove\nand so since we were born and raised\nwe've been told that finding the one is\nthe ultimate expression and experience\nof love and what's really fascinating is\nthat if you look at any of the wisdom\nTraditions they don't feel that way\nall the wisdom Traditions would suggest\nthat the love that you have for your\nco-workers your friends your family\ntheir stranger on the street the person\ndriving the car the\nperson that you just bumped into at the\ngrocery store at the coffee shop like\nthe love that you can embody and\nexperience and share with that person\nand receive from that person\nthat love that you can share with anyone\nand everyone you meet that is actually\nthe ultimate expression of love and so\nwhat you just said that you're great at\ngiving love to everyone you have this\nbeautiful Full Cup around you but it's\nthe wiring that's been put into our\nminds that without this we are\nincomplete unfulfilled and undeserving\nand so I'm not saying that as a way of\nsaying to people you don't need to find\nsomeone to love I'm just saying that\ndon't ever let that be it uh there's\nthere's so much more to what love truly\nis and so\nwe've got to change our\norder of what's love you know you look\nat the wisdom traditions and they'll say\nthe closest thing to unconditional love\nis a mother's love for her child yeah\nlike that is like the closest thing to\nreal unconditional love like start\ntalking about a love between two people\nwho romantically got involved like\nthat's beautiful I'm not saying it's not\nbeautiful I'm just saying it's not it I\nI think it's okay first of all your\nanswer is exactly what I was meant to\nhear\nbecause they do feel that pressure like\nit's funny how\nI've been single for almost seven years\nand it's been some of the happiest years\nof my life I feel so fulfilled\nthat I'm almost like my walls are about\nfear of someone coming in and like\ntearing up the joint you know like I\ndon't know if I'm that's ready for\nsomeone to rock the boat of the goodness\nof the balance of the life I've ended up\ncreating with my daughters my friends my\nco-workers when it didn't work out with\ntheir dad that was a a thing that took\nme many years to recover from because I\nso wanted the nuclear family it turns\nout we are literally having the next\nbest thing or maybe even the plan that\nwas in place all along that we have\nwe're so close I love his wife so much\nmy children and I literally our\nstepmother Ali I call her our stepmother\nyou know like I love that she is the\ngreatest his mom and dad are Grammy and\nPoppy I'm so close to them his sister is\none of my best friends my children's\naunt and the mother of our three silly\ncousins like I never dreamed I'd have\nthis big and beautiful of family there's\njust not a legal marriage there but\nthere's every single thing else there\nand since that stopped I've just been\nokay and I think it is a lot of societal\npressure and the reason I got so\nemotional asking you is because\nyou're a monk and probably I'd set\nyourself up for the idea that you might\nnot experience that and I have probably\ngiven myself now and you have a\nbeautiful marriage\num I I have probably told myself a\nnarrative of you will not have that kind\nof love but it doesn't mean that I feel\nany less fulfilled but I'm in a mindset\nof oh that particular type of love is\nnot available to you yeah so I asked you\nof all people because you probably had\nthat narrative in your head yourself at\nsome point yeah definitely I mean that's\nand I couldn't agree more with you like\nthat needs to be on billboards and like\nreally a a much more common\nconfident understanding of Love Is Love\nwhich is the best kind or the most\nimportant kind or the one you think\nyou're supposed to have that is not the\npoint and boy I knew I should ask you\nand I just got the most satisfactory\nanswer I I've probably never verbalized\nthat answer to anyone else either in in\nthis sort of forum because I I genuinely\nbelieved when you asked me that question\nthat you know obviously knowing that all\ntypes of Love are available to everyone\nis an important thing that's that's a\nseparate thing to focus on but I think\nthe hierarchy that we've placed on love\nis what's distorting our vision of and\nit follows you forever forever I didn't\nhave a relationship with my dad he left\nbefore I was born\nthat that I accepted that you know but\nlike another woman will be like I'm 45\nand not married or this or that and it's\nlike this society allows that to really\nhaunt you in a different way than well\nwhen it comes to love and a man my\nfather and I didn't have that but we\nmove forward or maybe it holds us back\nspiritually or emotionally but not\nsocietally yeah you're right we have put\nthat romantic love on a pedestal that\nseems to like if you don't have that\nkind of love it diminishes the other\nkinds of loves which can be not only as\nequally fulfilling and satisfying gosh\nthat I really is well that's society's\nproblem not our problem yeah I know\npeople who love their work but feel\nincomplete without that I know people\nwho love their children but feeling\ncomplete without that I know people who\nhave the love of their entire tribe and\nCommunity but feeling complete without\nthat because of the way it's been\nportrayed and I think that\nwhen you also put something on a\npedestal like that your expectations of\nthat also go up and that's no reason why\nthat one causes us the most pain because\nwe also have more expectations of that\npartner than we do of our kids of our\nparents of our friends of our family\nbecause of that pedestal too I can't\nagree more out so like I think it's\nbananas the way that people are so\naffected by the person they're in a you\nknow romantic relationship with I always\ncompare it to well you wouldn't be so\nupset if your friend did that yeah like\nyou'd just be direct and you'd figure it\nout and you'd fix it and you wouldn't\ntake it so personally and flip out and\nhave built up all these resentments like\nfriends have a delicate relationship in\na garden you still have to tend to but\nabsolutely the reactions are way less\nheated\nwhy is it that the minute sexual stuff\nis involved we literally like flip out\nlike what is going on yeah oh my God\nthat's it that I've always been aware of\nyeah I'm like I really just wish I could\nhave a relationship like I do with my\nfriends because they're not so flipped\nout all the time yeah like we just deal\nlike we just do yeah\nI'm so glad you asked me then thank you\nfor opening up so much but I was\nwondering that well because I knew that\nyou had probably also believed that this\nwas not going to be available to you in\nlife and that is the place I've been in\nfor the last seven years but mine was\nelective and yours was elected yes\nabsolutely so I was like who better to\nask this question to yeah than someone\nwho had purposefully shut themselves off\nto this in service of you know for you\nit was your spirituality your religion\nfor me it was for my kids yes but again\nI'm not codependent on them like I'm so\naware of like how much that would screw\neverything up them me all of it but they\ndo inspire me to be my best self no\none's come along no romantic partner no\none ever my friends are the closest\nsecond but they are the people that have\ncome into my life that have truly\nencouraged forced and inspired the\ngreatest change I've done in my life yes\nand I think when it's elective and it's\nnot suppressed or repressed or it's not\ndone demanded when it's done in that way\nit can be really really powerful because\nyou get it's almost like if everyone had\na period of their life\nI mean I I often ask this question to\npeople that I work with or clients that\nI coach and it's that\nI mean I started dating when I was 14\nprobably like dating I don't know how\nold you were when you started dating my\nfirst boyfriend was when I was like in\nthe third or fourth grade wow um and he\nwas my first kid no one would have dated\nme in the third or fourth grade but that\nwas it like it ended there it was it it\nwas very puppy love it was very sweet\nand it was very innocent yeah so I\nprobably had my proper first girlfriend\nwhen I was 14 and I often asked people\nlike between your first girlfriend to\nwhere you are now your first boyfriend\nor whatever maybe till now like how many\ndays have you spent single and for most\npeople that answer isn't very long like\nI know people who could say three weeks\nmaybe six months maybe nine months like\nwhen you look at all life and you start\nrealizing that we haven't really spent\nmuch time having the opportunity to seek\nand experience all the other types of\nlove because we've been chasing this one\ntype of love to fulfill on our needs but\nit's so I'm so grateful you asked me\nthat question genuinely well and I\nreally am like I'm like I haven't\nprioritized myself what if I actually\nmade myself my partner absolutely like\nwhat if I invested in myself would I've\ninvested in so many other people yes in\nthe form of these big beautiful chapter\nadventurous great romantic Adventures\nthat I've had one of which led to the\ngreatest meaning of my life my kids and\nI even feel weird saying my because\nthey're their own people but our kids\num and it's been really great to\nprioritize myself and say you know what\nyou have a lot of work to do\nuh you got to figure out how to be a\nparent you've got to figure out how to\nraise your like inner child that like\nyou know did a lot of work back then but\nthere's some adult perspective you\ndidn't have so there's new work that\nneeds to be done\nyou need to work on you know maybe\nyou've done the same thing over and over\nin your life like occupationally\nspeaking like is there other stuff out\nthere or are you happy just doing things\nover and over again the same way maybe\nyou are but like give yourself the\nchance to explore that yeah\num and I've had such big life changes\nand I've been there to support myself\nrather than again outward towards\nsomebody else I'm really a caretaker and\nwe all imprint so much of what we're\ndealing with becomes a very 50 50 thing\nin a relationship which is a beautiful\ngift but you are taking in a lot of\nsomeone else's perspective and needs and\nstuff and this has been such a great\ntime for me and something I said to my\nfellow co-worker here Jen\num earlier today we were something about\nsome great guy came up and she was like\nUgh where are all those great guys and\nshe's such a marvelous woman and she's\nso rad and so awesome and I'm like you\nknow what Striker not only are you\nobviously gonna find someone or some\npeople maybe it's one maybe it's\nchapters I said but you know what\nI'm gonna be so mad at you and you're\ngonna be so mad at yourself if you waste\nthis time because it's coming he's\ncoming and you're not gonna get this\ntime back yeah so\nI always noticed too when I asked people\nin the audience how many of you guys are\nmarried people raise their hands and\nwhen I say how many of you are single\nthey all whoop it's like oh that's good\noh that's good there's like there is a\ncelebratory Pride that comes with being\nsingle yeah and I hope people hold this\ndearly that these things for better or\nworse don't last yeah you're gonna\nprobably end up with someone and so\ninstead of like boohooing through this\ntime love it like it because one day it\nmight be gone and you'll romanticize\nlooking back how great it was to be in a\nrelationship with yourself absolutely\ntrue I love that thank you for coming to\nmy TED Talk that's what you should have\nsaid\nit was brilliant I'd love to do it yeah\nwell I mean you need to on this on this\nexact topic I think it's unbelievable I\nhave one last question for you you said\nat the beginning of our interview you\nsaid that when you were a kid and you\nwere observing people in the industry I\nwas saying observing you and then you\nstarted talking about observing others\nyou said\nI was always looking at people and\ntrying to make sense of who I wanted to\nbe yes today who do you want to be who\nis it that you look or not even Who as a\nperson but who do you want to be the\nvalues the characters the qualities the\ninner that you're speaking about what\nare those things that you Aspire for\ntoday we heard a story about this couple\nuh we have a section on our show called\nDrew's news\num we had pulled up a story about the\ncouple who was in a hundred years of age\nI think they've been married for I don't\nknow 80 something years\nand\num they said when they were asked like\ncan you give a wisdom and their wisdom\nwas\nwhen you are getting in a row or a fight\nor something like take a time out there\ntoday who inspires me because again it\ndoes not have to be of the romantic kind\nbut when you see yourself Rising when\nthat Blood starts to boil when you start\nto like clench and freak and get spun\nout instead of spewing that reaction and\nlike Linda Blair Exorcist all over the\nroom\nI will have such regret for any type of\nmoment that I have like that and I I\nwant to become the master of the person\nwho knows how to excuse themselves\nwalk away take a deep breath I have\nbreathe written on my wrist in tattoo\nand I still forget to look at it like\nafter one rich deep breath after one\nremoval of yourself in a situation after\none time out after one walk away you are\nnot going to come back usually as spun\nout so I think that for me is probably\nlike the goal du jour in my life right\nnow is like Behavior mastery\nand funny enough as far as the people I\nfollow\nit's the same people for the last 30\nyears it's Nan and Chris and Peter and\nBrian and Steve it's like Cameron and my\noldest friend Mel we celebrate 40 years\nthis year wow I I stick with people\nbecause I'm still trying to become like\nthem but we have a hella good time like\nalong the way but I just am in love with\npeople who I think God darn it yeah when\nI get to be like you when I can learn to\nreact like you when I can\nlive the way I see you living because\nthey're not not fun they're not not\nfunny and spontaneous and cool and\ninteresting and have a wild side like\nyou don't have to be boring no\ndefinitely not but I think when you're a\nkid at least I did I thought you\nprobably were if you were An Almighty\nperson you were probably a crashing bar\nI wanted to hang out with all like the\nRuckus yeah like I wanted to be in the\nrumpus room with all the like\ncook-a-doodles just like me but everyone\nI admire they're just like really cool\npeople too they're fun and loving and\nand interesting and humorous so it turns\nout all the people you admire don't have\nto be boring they can be everything you\nwant to be of that true thank you so\nmuch oh my God opportunity I love you so\nmuch I love you too this was one of the\nmost beautiful human exchanges that I've\nhad it was such a special special memory\nbecause it's not interesting because I\nfeel like that's what you do and give to\npeople every day it is but it's I don't\nknow it's different when\nyou really get to hear from the heart\nand speak from the heart I was going to\nsay it feels so open-hearted yeah like\nyou and I just like you know my dad used\nto say about like the body it's just\nTupperware man it's just Tupperware\nthat's good and it's like it's true it's\nlike when do you sit down and sort of\nlike unzip your chest and like reveal\nyour organs and your heart and like for\nall those people who are romanticized\nthat had in the heart also please pay\nattention to the gut yeah it is for sure\nand Barry even says like so many ancient\nwisdoms yes are really about the gut\nthat's it it's all about the gut the\nhealth the Insight the the Instinct you\nknow the truth the alarm Bells yeah like\nGod pay attention one thing as a mom\nI've really hooked into in the last like\nyear is telling my girls I want you to\npay attention to what feels good or\nmakes you feel good that's fantastic\nlet's go with that but I want you to be\nas equally heightenedly aware of what\ndoesn't make you feel good absolutely\nand let's explore that I love that yeah\nit's so needed it's so needed I'm so\nglad you raised that about the guides so\neasily missed and I think we're just\ngetting there now well it's not sexy\nyeah exactly the heart and the head is\npoetry yeah yeah HH gut yeah\ntrust that because that's your little\nCompass inside your body I love it if\nyou love this episode you'll enjoy my\nconversation with Meghan Trainor on\nbreaking generational trauma and how to\nbe confident from the inside out"
