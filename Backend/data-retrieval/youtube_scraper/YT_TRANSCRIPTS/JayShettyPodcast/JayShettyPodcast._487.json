like we have to\ncontinue to hold on and I would imagine\nfor so many people out there that is\nprobably the most difficult thing the\nbest-selling author and host the number\none Health and Wellness

by\nyou look up to and someone who is truly\nthe definition of the word goat uh I'm\ntalking about the one and only sir Lewis\nHamilton seven time Formula One World\nChampion someone with over a hundred\nrace wins considered the most successful\nF1 driver of all time and Lewis's\nwillingness to embrace what makes him\ndifferent has defined his values and\noutlook on life and in 2014 those values\nsaw him win BBC's Sports personality of\nthe Year followed two years later by a\nposition in Time magazine's 100 most\ninfluential people list Lewis received\nboth accolades for a second time in 2020\nin a year that saw him become a leading\nvoice in the global fight for racial\nequality in doing so he was recognized\nas British gq's Game Changer of the year\nand Powerless most influential

is doing incredible work\nplease welcome to on purpose Lewis\nHamilton Lewis thank you for being here\nthank you so much for having me no this\nhonestly is a special one for me it's\nbeen one of those ones that you know\nwhen I first launched the podcast there\nwere a few names that I wanted to sit\ndown with and you were one of those\nnames so for me it's a very special\nmoment and for this to be your first\never podcast which you just told me I\ndidn't even know and you literally told\nme this like 10 minutes ago and in my\nhead I'm thinking wow thank I I'm so\ngrateful to have that honor honestly\nhonest mine I'm really so grateful for\neverything you do and so I've been\nfollowing and listening to you and you\nsent me the book a long time ago already\nso I really appreciate everything you're\ndoing today oh well thank you man thank\nyou and I'm excited to unpack your\njourney because as we said because it's\nyour first podcast people have heard\nparts of you\nbut but we don't really understand the\ndepth and the texture of of Lewis\nHamilton and so I guess I want to start\nin a in a different place and we'll\nwe'll kind of go through on this journey\nI wanted to ask you what do you feel\nis the hardest thing you've had to do in\norder to be who you are today I think\ncontinuing to have the belief in myself\nand not letting that Veer off since I\nwas young since I've been told from my\nteachers that I would never amount to\nnothing The Bullying or the things that\nyou face at the adversity you face the\ndiscrimination\nand just continue to keep your head up\ncontinuing to\nto march on ahead uh towards your dream\nand never lose inside now I think that's\ndefinitely for sure the most difficult\nthing is keeping keeping your goal and\nyour eyes set on that and not being\ndistracted\num not giving up\nI think the easiest thing in life is to\ngive up on whatever you know whatever\nyou're focused on or whatever you're\nhopeful for\nthe hardest thing is to continue to keep\ngoing but we have to like we have to\ncontinue to hold on\nand I would imagine for so many people\nout there that is that it that is\nprobably the most difficult thing yeah I\nthink that's a great answer because I\nthink people look at you and they assume\nthat you never have to make that choice\nright they see someone in your position\nsomeone who's achieved what you've\nachieved and the Assumption can be oh\nyeah but he's the greatest he was he was\njust always that way and he doesn't have\nto make that choice every day but as you\nsaid since the beginning of your life\nwhether it's childhood whether it's\nbreaking into a sport that wasn't set up\nfor you\nthere have been so many moments let's\nlet's go back to school let's talk about\nsome of that more in depth because I\nfeel like\na lot of people struggle at school but\nyou kind of went through a lot of\naltercations and adversities at that\ntime what were some of the things you\nwere hearing some of the bullying some\nof the racism the experiences that you\nhad that felt limiting or made it feel\nlike it was easier to give up I think\nfor me I mean school was the most\nprobably the most traumatizing and diff\nmost difficult part of my life wow\num I already was being bullied at the\nage of six\num I think at the time that particular\nschool I was probably one of three kids\nof color\nand\njust bigger stronger\nbullying kids were throwing me around a\nlot of the time\nI was always the last picked in the you\nknow when you're standing playground in\nyour uh in the line of when they're\npicking teams for football I was always\nthe last one chosen or not even chosen\neven if I was better than somebody else\num and then\nthe the constant Jabs the\nthings that are either thrown at you\nlike bananas or people that would use\nthe m word just so relaxed\num people calling you half cast and you\nknow just really not knowing where you\nfit in that for me was difficult when\nyou then go into like history class and\neverything you learn in history there\nare no people of color in the history\nthat they were teaching us so I was\nthinking oh well where are the people\nthat look like me\nand\nI mean for me in my school there was\nonly around I think there was around\nseven maybe six seven black kids out of\n1200 kids and three of us were else put\noutside the headmaster's office all the\ntime the Headmaster just had it out for\nfor us and particularly for me I would\nsay so like just juggling all these\ndifferent emotions that you're feeling\nplus I struggled at school I didn't find\nout till I was 16 that I was dyslexic\nfortunately I came across a teacher that\nwas actually caring and\num took me down that road and helped me\ndiscover a little bit more about myself\nand how I can better myself through\neducation but\num\nI think that for me was\nthat was tough also because I was racing\nevery weekend I would leave on the\nThursday night we would travel you know\npack up the motorhome we'll travel\naround the country to race on the\nweekends\nand no one else knew when I'd got back\nto school every all the kids have done\nnormal things on the weekend and\nI'll come back and say I'm I was racing\nand people would be like oh I've done\nthat before you know like at this at the\ntheme park or something\nbut no one really knew what my goal was\nand could really they thought we would\nmaybe it was a joke you missed a lot of\nthat social interaction also I was\nputting all the lowest sets at school\nand told that if you do well you can\nprogress and then never ever let me\nprogress no matter how hard I tried\num so I really felt that the system was\nreally up against me and I was kind of\nswimming against the tide but I'm so\ngrateful for that that Journey because\nthat's what built me to the person that\nI am today but there were a lot of\nthings that I suppressed because I I\ncouldn't go home\nand say hey to my I didn't feel I could\ngo home and talk to my parents that you\nknow these kids kept calling me them\nwhere today I got bullied I got beaten\nup at school today or I you know I\nwasn't able to defend myself I didn't\nwant my dad to think I was not strong\nand so I'll you know if I had tears I\nwould hold them back if I had emotions\nit would be in a quiet place\nand\num\nit wasn't really till I started racing\nthat I was able to channel this emotion\nthat I had into my driving and it's like\nwhen I put this helmet on\nSuperman was my favorite I loved how he\nfought for the people and I loved how he\ndid the right things and he was a really\ninspiring character for me but again no\nsuperhero was of color so you know but\nyou can still aspire to be someone\nthat's if they don't look like you you\nknow um\nand so I remember going to karate I\nremember putting this helmet on in\nracing and it felt like it was my cloak\nyou know my superpowers had come out\nwhen I was driving and I was battling\nwith these kids and I was doing able to\ndo things that they\nseemed to not be able to do as well\nand that was my love wow yeah I mean\nit's\nmy mind was opposite I was bullied a lot\nat school as well I was one of five\npeople of color in my primary school and\nI was also overweight and so I was\nbullied for that\nand obviously you know my parents are\nfrom Indian backgrounds and so they'd\ngone through it much worse than I did\nwhen when they'd moved to England\nbut the difference was that I would go\ncry to my mum and then my mum would come\ntry and save the day in school and that\nwas the worst that was so embarrassing\nlike your mum's they're telling the\nteacher what happened and then I'm like\noh no Mom don't do this and then it's\neven more embarrassing because the kids\npick on you going oh mum came to say oh\nyeah yeah Mommy's right yeah so that\nthat was my version of it I wasn't\nscared of crying to my mum but then it\nhad it had different things but yeah\nthat that's so hard as a kid when you're\ngoing through that and you're trying to\nfind yourself you're trying to figure\nout what confidence is you don't even\nknow what that means you feel like not\ngoing to school but then even though\nyou're saying you found it in racing I\nmean racing was similar because you were\nworking class you're still to this day\nthe only working-class black driver to\ndo as successfully as you have so not\nonly do you have it at school you also\nhave it in your passion like in the\nthing that is your cloak is your\nSuperman so how does it feel when you're\nalso dealing with it in that area where\nyou've discovered what your passion or\nyour interest is at that age what does\nit feel like when you're getting in that\nspace it's inescapable\nyou know you use that as an escape but\nthen you're confronted with it also and\nso I was just grateful that I had this\namazing figure in my dad you know I got\na you know my best one of my best\nfriends like his dad was never there I\nknow there's not many people that have\nseparated parents and and being shared\nbetween parents is not an easy thing\num you know some days with your mom and\nsome days we did that my my mum was the\nsoft loving\nparent so\nthat's where I really I feel like I\nlearned a lot of compassion and empathy\nthat's where I feel like I get it from\nher and my dad was at that strong like\nkind of stronger Rock and also just\nsomeone that looked like me on and just\nhe would say do you talking on the track\ndon't be distracted by it don't listen\nto what they're saying do your driving\non track and show let's just be quiet\nand walk away as well as you know\num\nso but you know again like your parents\nmy parents went through well\nparticularly my dad was someone that\nalso face adversity through his life and\nhe's like I want to do everything in my\npower to create a better life for my kid\nso that I don't feel or experience the\nthings that I have encountered and\nthrough my through my journey and so but\nI think for me it was also difficult\nhaving biracial you know I'm biracial so\nhaving a white mother mother for example\nand a black dad\nI knew my dad would understand the\nracial slurs that I surrounded me my mum\ncouldn't understand it so I couldn't\nreally speak to my mum about it she was\nloving but\nshe's never been educated within it she\ndidn't know anything about black history\nand slavery and so it was a very\ndifficult but but I had love there which\nwas the most important thing yeah\num but in the racing it was like you\nknow like kids you just want to enjoy\nyourself you want to be included and you\nknow when you're kind of outcast a\nlittle bit it's um\nit's difficult for kids you know and so\nthat's why today like I'm like if I'm\nposting something I hope that when I do\nclick that button\nI hope that it is a positive wave for\nsome of the kids out there that are\nbeing distracted by all the stuff that's\ngoing on around the world yeah I mean I\nwas I was telling you earlier I was so\ngrateful\ncame out to watch you in Austin a couple\nof weeks ago and got to meet your dad\nand I heard you talk about your dad in\nthat way before and so when I met him I\nwas it was I was just you know it's nice\nto share that with him and I was just\nsaying how beautiful it is to see your\nrelationship and and how it's evolved\nit's always been that way yeah yeah\nthat's what I thought yeah yeah to walk\nus through whatever you feel my dad has\nbeen like the leader in getting me you\nknow he had four jobs at one stage just\nto keep us go-karting because when we\nall started gokind most of the people\nwere majority of the people were from\nworking class families\num so but then there are of course a few\nwealthier kids\nthat have slightly better access to\nequipment and\num mechanics and all those sorts of\nthings and my dad was my mechanic so it\nwas just me and him on the road and and\nmy stepmom Linda\num she would be there supporting\num making sure that we're fully clothed\nmaking sure that we we've eaten and\nwe're hydrated all those sorts of things\nfor the weekend prepare my kid\num so it was very much a family outing\nit was a family kind of\num family weekend we did it as a family\num we've traveled together my little\nbrother would be on the road with us as\nwell who's a major inspiration you've\ndefinitely got to speak to me one day\num born with Cerebral Palsy\num when I was seven and is a speaker\ntoday so he's and racing he's done he's\ndefined all the odds and wow uh even\nthough he's seven years younger than me\nstill very much an inspiration but the\nthing with my dad was he was maybe he\nwas my manager all the way till I was\nlike 20 I got to we got to phone one and\nhe was he worked so hard his work ethic\nfor me was that that's was inspiring for\nme seeing how hard he worked the time he\ngets up in the morning the little sleep\nthat he would have end of his day in the\ngarage working on the go-kart preparing\nfor the weekend packing up the track and\ngetting us to where we are mechanicing\nlearning to be a better mechanic and and\nstill weighing all these different\nthings it was quite phenomenal to see\num but I think it was difficult for him\nto then show me love and sometimes you\njust want to hug from your dad you know\nor when you're facing these things you\nwant to be able to be embraced but\num when I think I got to when I was 22\n23 it got really intense when I got to\nform one because all of a sudden you're\nthrown into you go through karting and\ncars you don't go to school to to learn\nto speak to the media you're literally\nthrown into the pit\nand at the time I didn't have management\nother than my dad my stepmom were booked\nflights and trips but\num I didn't have PR I didn't have\nanybody to help protect me or prepare me\nfor things\ndriving I was good I would say but in\nthese things is where a lot of mistakes\nhappened\num you've got the\nthe kind of all the media attention and\nyou have to so you're just learning on\nthe go which was very difficult for a\nyoungster I think yeah absolutely and\nand also I just you wanted to try and\nlive some sort of normal normal life but\nnothing's normal for you at the time\nand the thing for me and my dad were\njust we're really bumping his at one\nstage it's like I really just want you\nto be my dad so we can let's go and have\nfun let's go and have a laugh but we\nhadn't had that for a long time and so\num eventually I decided to sit part ways\nfor my dad and I was like I'm gonna\nstart making some of the decisions for\nmyself and the mistakes that I'm gonna\nneed to make and there was definitely a\nperiod of time where we spoke less\num but we both have worked so hard to\ncome back together\nand we have one of the greatest you know\nhe's the first person I want to call\nwhen I finish a race\num because I know he knows what it's\nlike he was there from day one and so\nyou know he's been to the last two races\nwith me he's probably gonna come to the\nnext one there's days where I do feel\nlike I'm not enough there's days where I\ndon't feel like I'm good enough and\npeople be like yeah but you've won seven\nWorld titles anyway yeah but still\nthere's days where I question no you\nstill got it you still\nare you can you still be the best yes\nyou can and so I have to just always I'm\nhaving that conversation with myself\noften but my dad's also there sometimes\nI'll say something that's maybe not the\nmost positive and he'll be the one there\njust reaffirming no you've got this\nbelieve in yourself and it's so\nimportant for people to have people like\nthat around them and I support myself I\nsurround myself with other positive\npeople as well and we continue I think\nit's all our job to lift every as many\nyou know everyone up right I want\neveryone around me to win and yeah\num and to become the best versions of\nthemselves so no thank you for sharing\nthat as well thank you for opening up\nabout that because\nyeah I think the relationships we have\nwith our parents are just\nso significant when it comes to\nachievement and success and when you\nstart doing sport at your level even at\nan early age\nwins and losses starts becoming so\nimportant so win and loss is important\nin everyone's life in the sense that\neveryone has it in exams in school and\nthings like that which we'll talk about\nin a second as well but for you you're\nhaving a\nin a very over way like you have one two\nthree and then you have everyone else\nand and how have you kind of worked with\nthat since you're young because I can\nimagine that your psychology can become\nvery much like if you win things are\ngreat if you lose things are bad how\nhave you kind of processed that as\ntime's gone on and was there a time when\nit was unhealthy and difficult and has\nit got better or is it something you're\nalways working on so on one side of\nthings you know I struggled at school as\nI said so the teachers would write these\nreports\nthat I was\nnot focused or I wasn't doing well and\nand I remember the fear of that report\nevery year and I try so hard to do well\nand then these teachers I don't know if\nteachers out there realize when they\nwrite those reports what's happening\nback at home whether you have an abusive\nuh household or\nyou know the the stress of that was was\ndifficult I feel embracing if I if I\nwould win I could see a smile on my\ndad's face and it was really like okay\nif I do well at this I know that I'll be\naccepted you know\num but I go to work double hard to be\nI've got to always be first I always\nlaugh about the whole if you're not\nfirst you last because I'm literally\nwhilst that's obviously I've not been\nfresh my whole life\nfirst was everything yeah\num in order to be accepted in order to\nfit in and maybe to be appreciated\num not only in within my relationship\nperhaps with my dad but then also\naround my friends\nand it was until I got older I realized\nit's about the bigger picture but when\nyou have success it's so short-lived\nit's like it really is really\nshort-lived you win a race then you go\nback home and you have big as a racing\ndriver you know the weekend's so intense\nyou've seen it\nthere's so much energy so much it's\nreally really in a stressful environment\nfor everyone that's working within it\nthen you go home and there's a huge come\ndown like one or two days later and\nyou're trying to balance those emotions\nthat emotional rollercoaster\num and learning to kind of channel that\nand figure out ways to keep it balanced\nwhether with your routine and those\nsorts of things has been really key for\nme\nbut I think during the last couple of\nlast few years really understanding that\nit's about the bigger picture\num I'm fighting for something far\ngreater than winning a race I'm really\nfighting for\nchanging the world you know we're more\ndivided than ever I would say it's\ndevastating I can't watch the news it's\ndevastating every there's so much\nhappening\nbut there are so many great people out\nthere that are doing really great things\nand\nI want to be one of I want to be a part\nof that\n[Music]\ninspirational energy bubble that people\nlike yourselves are a part of\num because we want to we need to create\na brighter future we need to create\nbetter Future Leaders look how many look\nhow bad our leaders are\nthat are in governments you know like we\nneed to be as part of the next\ngeneration of thought leaders\num that are positive and\num yeah so that's what I'm trying to be\na part of every day I'm so I'm really\ntrying to focus on\nmy intentions as you're talking about\nlike setting your intentions each day\num I'm trying to learn new tools that I\ndidn't have when I was a kid I didn't I\ndidn't know about yoga I didn't know\nabout meditation\num I didn't have podcasts to listen to\ngood people to listen to and aspire to\nkind of help me put on the right path so\nyeah\num yeah we've got a lot of work to do\nthere's almost not enough time here on\nthis planet right we're here for such a\nshort time really in the Scale of the\nUniverse yeah but I think you're one of\nthose people that you know and that's\nwhen we first connected that was one of\nthe biggest reasons for me that I saw\nyou using your platform for a bigger\npurpose I was like oh that's fascinating\nlike that's so interesting to me because\nthat's a choice too I think today we\nkind of assume that if someone has a\nplatform or if someone's you know number\none in their field or if someone's got\nfollowers that they should talk about\nstuff we kind of assume that anyone who\nhas followers should talk about stuff\nfirst of all I don't think that's the\ncase I think a lot of people choose not\nto\nuh but but you were someone that stood\nout to me massively where I was just\nlike wow this person's really not\njust winning on\non the track but it's thinking about how\nwinning on the track transfers to what\nyou can do off the track because of the\ninfluence because of your network\nbecause of your impact\nand I find that to be really\nThe Missing Link for so many people\nbecause\nI always say that your purpose is\nsomething not just that makes you happy\nit's when you use what makes you happy\nto serve other people like when you use\nit to impact other people's lives when\ndid that drop for you like when did that\nclick for you like were you ever\nI guess what I'm trying to say is\nthere's a transition when you're saying\nthat well you know winning like maybe\nget the nod from my dad and obviously I\nwas bullied and then I'm winning but\nthen I'm number one at something like\nwas there a point at which number one\ndidn't satisfy you or was there a point\nat which\nthe success that came from it or or you\ndidn't actually have to get dissatisfied\nyou just found that there was a better\nway to be successful does that make\nsense the parv that was striking when\nyou're just saying that for me it was\nlike I feel like we often live in fear\nof what people think\num how you're going to be judged how\nyou're going to be received if you\nyou're free outspoken you're going to\nlose your job you're going to be fired\nI've always been\na outspoken person I think that's just\nbeen a quality I've never been a\nfollower\num I don't like to conform to how people\nexpect\nwhat people of what people expect from\nyou as I said I was having a success and\nI was like okay now I'm on I'm at the\ntop what can I do with it yeah and there\nare so many causes there's so many\nproblems out there and there's so many\nso many amazing causes and which one you\nknow there's only one of you so like\nwhat where do you put the focus and\nthat's take it took a long long time to\nreally find what that was for me I think\nfor me education was something that I\nfelt extremely passionate about because\nI\nI've been out to India I'd been out into\nsome of the really\npoorest places like Manila and seeing\nyoung kids\nwho are like us but begging for food and\nnot having the same opportunities and\nfor me that was that broke my heart\nand realized how privileged we are and\nhow fortunate we are it was like I want\nto be working with people out there that\nare trying to create more you know\nthere's over 100 million kids that don't\nhave access to school or education so\nhow can I get involved in that so align\nyourself with people that do\nbut I think I was I was winning and it\nwas giving me that tip of happiness but\nthen I would kind of drop back down to\nnormality and\nthere was something missing\nand it was that purpose really or\nunderstanding what that purpose was and\nunderstanding what\nwhy you've been put here why are you\nbeginning the platform\nthat you've that you've been given why\nwere the only you know only people of\ncolor this whole time through it all and\nwhen I started speaking about\num diversity people like oh you want to\nget more people of coloring as as racing\ndrivers only 20 of us so as I know it's\nthis forty thousand forty fifty thousand\njobs there's thousands of engineering\njobs in the background and there's such\na lack of diversity coming through I\nwant to be a part of Shifting that\nnarrative and shifting that conversation\nand having people be\nquestion themselves and have those\ndifficult conversations with with people\nso I first I just started by having\nthose difficult conversations with my\nboss\nand one of the things he brings up that\nhe said that hit him hard I said have\nyou ever thought of as a white person\nwalking into the paddock into the race\nweekend Paddock and being the only white\nperson there he's like he's like I\nhadn't even thought of that I said well\nthat's what it's like for someone like\nme when I'm in the room you noticed you\nnoticed that out of 50 people in a\nmeeting you're the only person the black\nperson there\nand it's not because we are less is\nbecause there are these barriers within\nSociety through education that are\nlimiting people to be the best they can\nbe so my job is to be empowering and\nimproving representation I'm really\nreally passionate like black Equity as\nwell so that's why I got involved with\nthe Denver Broncos Denver Broncos yeah\nyeah and usually when I'm in\nconversation with sponsors or companies\nI'm like hey so what it how diverse is\nyour team what are you doing about\ndiversity inclusion how are you creating\na better work workspace for people\nthat's what I want to be a part of I the\nsuccess can come later and that's that\nwould be along the way but if you're not\nasking those questions or you're not\ntackling those issues\nthen we're not blind yeah and so all\nthem pretty much every partner that we\nhave we have a lot of Partners within\nour team I've asked these really\ndifficult questions and they're like oh\nyou know what but we can do more I'm\nlike well let's do it\nyou know yeah so I think I've grown very\nclose with my like Mercedes-Benz and\nGamma they've\nbeen so open that we changed the car\nfrom Silver to Black in 2020.\nand as again I said to them like the\ncar's been silver forever it's always\nbeen silver arrows and I was like\nimagine if we change the card to Black\nwell that could you know us turning up\nand arriving is how you show up and it's\nhow you know imagine the message we can\nsend and we had the black car for the\nwhole year and we didn't even really\ntalk much about it we just let it be\nand we went with it and that's when I\nwon myself with that car so that's\nbeautiful\nnow that must have felt special\nit was honestly my whole life flashed by\nmy not that last lap in Turkey\nmy whole life like all the struggles the\nquestioning whether you were going to\nmake it or not just all those doubts all\nthose fears kind of flash by Me by you\nknow through my eyes and came across the\nline\nand I was like I did it\nand I wanted the kids out there to know\nthat you can do it too\nyou know\num so that's what I try and like every\nday just try to be encouraging of\nkitchen yeah yeah do you sometimes feel\nthat we were talking about this a bit\nearlier that\nyou know in other sports we get to see\nthe emotions and the expressions of\nplayers that we love or\nyou know anyone who's on the court or\nthe field of the pitch whereas with you\nbecause we don't get to see that in your\neyes in your last lap like that we can\nonly hear it today which is why I'm so\ngrateful to have this moment because\nI obviously whenever whenever I'm sit\ndown with someone who's a high performer\nlike you it's obvious that there's so\nmuch emotion and preparation and power\nbut with racing specifically you just\ndon't get to see that do you sometimes\nfeel that the only people that can truly\nrelate to you\nare the people you compete with because\nI feel like it's like you said there's\nonly 20 of you that are racing anyway\nit's lonely anyway 99 of people in the\nworld have no idea what it feels like to\ndrive a car as fast as you do and the\nway you do in in any comparison\ndo you sometimes feel that the only\npeople you can relate to are the people\nthat are racing against you and then do\nyou kind of feel\nis there a loneliness in that experience\nor is that kind of like a power in that\nas well definitely the other drivers I\ndo feel that there's more we have a lot\nmore in common than we think but we're\nso competitive\nand a lot of us have our defense like\nyou want to beat the guy but then you\nlike the guy you might like the person\noutside the car but you can't show that\nlike there's this whole psychological\nbattle you're having with yourself and\ngetting away of yourself a lot of the\ntime so I really feel like as an older\ndriver I'm trying to be more like\nreaching out to youngsters and\num because they're the future you know\num and I'm excited to see some of these\nyoung drivers are coming through are so\nso talented I don't know if they've got\nthe best structure around them like I\nmean like I didn't necessarily have the\nultimate structure that I perhaps have\nnow\nso just try to be a kind of a positive\nlight to them but naturally none of them\nare black and none of them have\nnecessarily faced the same as me but\nthey've faced their own challenges and\nand things about respecting that with\nwithin everybody and I've tried to be\ncreate allies necessarily like in having\nthe difficult conversations with some of\nthem I mean I'm so grateful for I've had\na couple of them it really took the knee\nwith me in 2020\num just on that you know\nmy dad was going back to the house with\nmy dad my dad like never let me cry as a\nkid he said there's a sign of weakness\nlike don't let me ever see you shed a\ntear so I remember just holding back\nthrough those difficult times as a kid\nholding back most of that stuff in 2020\nI cried I hadn't cried for at least I\nthink at least 10 years maybe more\nit was there was a lot of bottled up\nstuff that came up that I had not\nrealized that didn't even know about\nsuppressing a pain or a feeling so I\nremember kind of bending on my knees\nthinking no what has happened in the\nworld I've got to I've got to be\noutspoken I've got to take that chance\nbecause if I don't do it then no one's\ngonna do it if I don't\nif I don't take the knee if I don't let\npeople like me know that I care and I\nhear you and I'm I'm with you and I'm\ngoing to do something about it I'm going\nto risk it all\nI don't care if\nmy partners want to drop me because I\nwant to be associated with this\nnarrative I don't I'm like and I\nliterally let go of all the fear and\nthat's why I went came so forward with\nit\nand I know it's not easy for everyone to\ndo that\num but I just want to really and try to\nencourage people out there too\nto be themselves to speak out if they've\ngot a problem if they're seeing\nsomething within the work working\nenvironment or experiencing something\nyou gotta be outspoken about it and\nthere's a right way to do it the first\nday I was going to take the knee I\nremember I didn't feel like I could tell\nmy team\nI was like because I know I felt that\nthey wouldn't understand how important\nit is for me to do this this day so I\nremember I had my black lives matter a\nshirt hidden and\nI just wore it out there and I I went\nahead within so no one knew no one knew\nbut every uh the sport had built and\nmade all these t-shirts like um we race\nas one yeah slogan and they gave these\nt-shirts to all the to everybody I was\nlike I'm not wearing that that's not\nwhat this is about and so this is what\nI'm doing and this was around George\nFloyd right yeah and afterwards my team\nwere like well why don't you if you just\ntold us we could have prepared a bit\nover I had this fear that they would try\nand stop me perhaps but that was just a\nfear\num they've been massively supportive\nthrough the whole thing My Hope was that\nyou know kids would be watching me like\nwhat it what it what is that why is he\ntaking me what what does that shirt mean\nwhat is going on Dad Mom\nand then the parents being in an awkward\nposition having to explain it maybe but\nI think what was really encouraging for\nme I think when we started really\ngetting into the whole diversity\ninclusion we did the research there was\nonly three percent out of two thousand\npeople in the team as three percent\ndiversity so\nsince then we've been on this Mission\nthe team have started new projects we've\ndiscovered that the the sport generally\nhires from one group of universities\nwhich is not diverse and if there are\nany young black students that go there\nthey're twice as unlikely to be hired\nwhen they come out compared to their\ncounterparts and also paid less\nexercises all these things that perhaps\npeople didn't know that's the Hamilton\ncommission right yeah yeah and that just\nwas interesting to to experience that\nand now now we're working on like a\ndiversity Charter that all the teams\nhave to be a part of and it's not mine\nit's for the sport and it's to encourage\nthose teams because there's still not\nany diversity within you know if you\nlook at Ferrari they don't have hardly\nany there's most teams don't\num but when I go back to my team to the\nfactory normally in our marketing\ndepartment wasn't very diverse initially\nand I walked in after the pandemic and I\nstarted seeing such a more diverse group\nof people I was really quite emotional\nbecause I was like oh my God there's I'm\nstarting to see change\nbut you don't see that on TV yeah so\nwhen I talk to the to the bosses of the\nsport I'm like hey you know there's all\nwhite men facing oh and and me facing\nthe camera at the start of the race\nwhere are the women\nwhere are the people of color we've got\nto be showing some young kids are\nwatching and they're like oh there's a\nplace for me there I can be there I can\nbe an engineer I can be a mechanic or\nwhatever it may be and even for young\ngirls oh I can be a racing driver or an\nengineer a strategist or whatever you\nknow so representation's so so key to\ninspiring the young youth especially in\nthese industries that they already have\nless access to right like that's the\npoint that it's not just it's not just\nrepresentation because you want them to\neven\nhave the opportunity it's the fact that\nthere's just no access point which is\nwhat you're trying to create I think\nwhat's what I find really\nbeautiful about you doing it is you're\ndoing it though when you're like I'm\nhaving all my emotions come up at the\nsame time as trying to be a voice for\nother people and when you're saying like\nI'm I'm taking a knee because I know I\nhave to make a stand\nexternally but internally you're taking\na knee because so much of your own stuff\nfrom\nyears ago is coming back up like that\nmust be quite hard when you're\nthat's that strikes me as something\nthat's really inspiring about what you\ndid is that you were going through your\nown healing at the same time as trying\nto do healing for the world there is so\nmuch healing to do right and I was\ncompletely oblivious to that I needed\nhealing I needed to really peel back\nsome of those layers\num I think for people that turn into\ntune into a race and you mentioned\nearlier on but when you\nwe arrive everything's set up We There\nis work that we're doing in the\nbackground naturally people don't see\nthey just see a show\nbut there is an unbelievable amount of\nwork that goes on in the background\num when I talk to people that talk about\nhow much weight you lose they're like\nyeah you just sit in the car and you\ndrive\num there's this huge psychological and\nemotional roller coaster that you're\ngoing through that it would be really\nhard for people to\ncomprehend and you would mention about\nall these other athletes you see their\nfaces in other sports you can't see\nbecause we've got helmet on but you go\nthrough this roller coaster ride in the\nrace and then you get out and they the\ncamera's right in your face you're not\nprepared for that your emotions are shot\nparticularly if you failed or feel like\nyou failed\nand you don't always answer the right\nway if you wear your your heart on your\nsleeve\npeople that don't necessarily like that\nnecessary always people take advantage\nof that so then you build up all these\nprotection mechanisms and mechanisms\nthat's not necessarily\nyou and at the core\nbut won't be the safest thing for you\nyou know what I mean like I read\nsomething the other day about\nit's like three steps of you and there's\none the one of which you present your uh\nwho you present there's you and your who\nyou are to you and your family and\nfriends\nand then there's one the part of you the\nreal you that no one ever gets to see\nand I think just today in today's world\nit's so vicious on social media it's the\nmedia can be you know can really tell\nyou apart\nand you build up you know like you you\nmake a mistake in something you say in\nthe media and your ridicule Feud you\nnever do it again so you build up and\nyou go more and more in your shell\nand you become harder for people to\nreally relate to but I think for me what\nI've realized in these last few years is\nreally peeling back those layers\nand you know letting people know that I\ngrew up in a council state I you know\nI've lived on the sofa with my uh my my\nparents we've had those struggles\num the successful people out there you\nsee they too have had those things where\nwe need to show that young kids who are\ngoing through that same thing that oh I\ncan if he can get there or they can get\nthere then it must be possible for me\ntoo yeah\num and like being showing you about\nvulnerability that's something that I\nreally struggled to to\nto do for a long long time and\num\nlike today that's something I think I'm\na lot more open than I've ever ever been\nyeah I'm not living in fear every day\nand that's like the most\nthat's the most important thing I think\nfor me personally I'm living a much\nhappier life because I'm\nI'm a lot more open yeah it's liberating\nyeah absolutely yeah it's liberating\nwhen you finally feel like you're not\ntrapped or you're hiding held or yeah or\nhiding yeah or hiding my favorite quotes\nis from my Angelo when she says we are\nall powerful beyond measure and that\nreally hit home also for me that that's\nmy favorite quote because and I have a\ntattooed\nbecause really we are so we do limit\nourselves we get in our own way right\nalong with the other things that get in\nour way but\na lot of our fear stops us from driving\nforwards from progressing and that's why\nlike I do the craziest things I jump out\nof planes yeah you've done what 80 jumps\nyeah like just just I love challenging\nmyself and doing things even though\nthere's maybe fear there but overcoming\nthat fear is like it's the best feeling\nwhen you overcome it and you realize\nthat she was all just a bunch of\nnonsense in your head I want to\nencourage so all my friends I'm like\nlet's go and do this today they're like\nare you crazy\nmy dad don't even think as a kid my dad\nwas like is he really my son because I\nwouldn't do any of these things and even\nstill today\num I still find that he's actually done\nskydiving with my Dad yeah he said he\nwould never do it but he did it so but\ndriving 200 miles per hour is probably\none of the scariest things that you do\nall the time like that's not for you\nanymore whatever things I've never had\nthat fear yeah uh as a kid and I was\njust never you know I think if you go on\na ski slope and you see these kids\ncoming by the kids are generally\nFearless right yeah but think as you go\nget older yes you start you hurt\nyourself a little bit you start\nprotecting yourself more and more but I\njust don't have that I think\nI feel like that was something that just\nwasn't necessarily put in me I'm\nterrified of spiders yeah that's the\nonly thing but I'm doing 200 miles an\nhour that's actually when I'm most at\npeace I would say yeah it's like I'm\nlike flowing it's like my that's my\nelement and that's why I like I love\ndoing what I do it could be really\nreally hard when I start racing I've\nbeen doing for 30 years I'm 37 I've been\nracing 30 years and when you stop like\nwhat what's gonna match that nothing's\ngonna have a probably a match being in\nthe stadium or being at the race and\nbeing at the Pinnacle the sport being at\nthe front of the greater or coming\nthrough the grid that motion that I get\nthere when I do stop\nthat will be a there'll be a big hole\nYeah so I'm trying to generally focus on\nthings find things that are going to\nreplace that that will also be just as\nrewarding and that's like Mission 44 for\nme meeting kids at schools having these\nconversations with families and parents\nwho clearly you're going through\ndifficult times and want to create the\nbest opportunity for their kids\nencouraging them they're like okay I've\nbeen there too look where I got so you\ncan get there it's just got to work\nthrough it that's for me the that's way\nmore rewarding than winning the race\nyeah so much more yeah that's I'm so\ngrateful and I'm so happy that\neveryone's gonna getting to hear this I\nfelt you're the only and I know you know\nyou're talking about when that happens\nbut it's brilliant that you're planning\nalready because you can see how\nso many athletes mentally\nwhen they know their career has somewhat\nof a shelf life or a somewhat of a time\nspan like it's so hot it's it just\ncompletely wrote but I remember you're\nreminding me of when I had the fortune\nof sitting down with Kobe Bryant and I\nsaid sat down with him when he'd already\nretired wow and I interviewed him oh so\ngreat I'm so jealous he was one of those\npeople that was not upset being retired\nhe loved it because he knew that his\nmission for him was to make these short\nmovies and make all these uh Sports\nbased content to inspire kids to tell\ntheir stories and to help them find\nbetter stories and so it's exactly what\nyou're saying where he wasn't he's one\nof those people that I've met he was not\nsad about he was so happy he was so\npumped that's what I'm working towards\nyeah because he he knew that he had a\nmission and he had a purpose and he'd\ngone and won an Oscar for a short movie\nthat he'd made and you know he was\ncreating content to inspire kids and\nthat's where his heart was and of course\nwatching his daughters play and so I'm\nsuper inspired by him yeah I know but\nyeah like when you said that that's what\nI remembered and and he was in the same\nboat he was like I always wanted to\nscript right and never had time to\nscript right he said I was always\nplaying basketball and he goes but then\nI started script writing and I got a\ncoach and then I was writing and getting\nbetter as a writer that's what I think\nwhen I've spoken to other athletes we\nfocused so much on that being the best\nyou can be and that one thing that the\nother things that you also love like if\nit's playing an instrument or if it's\nwriting scripts like it all falls\neverything falls away and yeah\num how can you come compartmentalize\nstaying in the in the zone in the focus\nLane but also building up some of those\nother skills and discovering other\npassions you know people's\nwe've heard people tell LeBron shut up\nand dribble like yeah that's there\nthere's a lot of people put you in the\nbox and say this you can only do one\nthing but as I've seen and spoken to\nsome people\nthat are active and retired a lot of\nthem say when particularly when they\nretire that they\neverything kind of fell apart like\neverything fell to the ground they had\nnothing to back it up with and they\nhadn't discovered what they're doing\nnext so then they go through this\nemotional Journey\num of of Discovery but it takes time\nso I'm like trying to learn from those\nthings and applying them and find the\nother things that I'm passionate about\nso I generally feel today that I have\nlots of things in the pipeline\nthat when I do stop it's gonna be like\nso grateful but I have something better\nthat I'm moving on to yeah\num but I I have no doubts that I oh me\nand my dad will always have to go to the\ngo-kart track or something you know I'm\nalways going to be competitive yeah I\ncan't that's literally a strain in My\nDNA that's just never gonna gonna shift\nI'm competitive at everything I'm happy\nto hear that it's it's it's I'm sure\nthat's refreshing it's great for people\nto also hear that even to inspire young\npeople or Inspire anyone who's gone to a\nplace in their career where they know\nthat there's a certain moment where\nthings are going to wind down but then\nthey're going to transition I think I\ndon't think we celebrate the transitions\nenough in life and life is made up of\ntransition absolutely and people think\nthat it's maybe less or something but\nit's yeah it's it's not about that yeah\nexactly so it's fascinating you found\nthat what are some of these like you\nsaid like um you know I've been doing\njumps I've been doing this with my\nfriends what are some of the routines\nthat you put into place to help you\nmanage your mindset because I feel like\nyou're you said that being at 200 miles\nper hour for the duration of a race is\nlike being in flow for you that means\nyou're extremely comfortable with your\nown thoughts extremely comfortable with\nbeing in a high stress high pressure\nenvironment but being just with your own\nself\ntalk to us about how you I mean it\nsounds like that's always been the case\nbut what have you done to become more\nand more comfortable with that yeah I\nthink naturally this is the natural\nability right but\num I've been out of focus for an hour\nand 45 minutes without making mistakes\nand that's that's literally insane it's\nunbelievable dealing with the pressures\num a friend actually asked me last night\nbecause I talk about\nwe lose a lot of race a lot of weight in\nthe race yes\nlike sometimes you can lose up to 10\npounds like four kilos and people like\nwhoa I need to be particularly in\nAmerica they're like oh I need to be a\nracing driver\num for the weight loss but this question\nis my friend asked me the other day\nthat's like where does the where does\nthe weight go like yeah because my suit\ndoesn't because afterwards I weigh less\nbut the I'm like so it must evaporate\nyou somewhere so I've never got to\nfigure out where all that weight\nactually truly goes because it obviously\nisn't in sweat but that's like messed my\nmind about\num but the suit definitely is obviously\na little bit heavier but um it's about\ngaining tools and I think as when I was\nyounger I didn't have I knew how to\narrive at the race I channeled the so\nthis emotion that I had through whatever\nthose difficulties were into my driving\nso it's laser focused like if you watch\na video for me when I was five years old\non Blue Pizza you'll see I'm just laser\nfocused but\num being able to control emotions being\nout to be calm and present\nstaying centered there are loads of\nobviously different methods that people\ncan use so things that I try to that\nI've started to incorporate over the\nyears more in my life is things like\nstretching things like yoga and\nmeditation has been a real\nthat for me was something that I never\nthought that that I kind of turned a\nblind eye to it when I was younger\nI thought that's not gonna be helpful\nbut being able to be sit still for a\nsecond\nand listen to the noises around you\num and understand you want to tap into\nthat kind of\nin a child or whatever it may be\nthat's for me been taking that moment\nfor yourself each day treating yourself\nwith love and being kind to yourself you\nknow because I think for a long time I\nwasn't kind to myself\nand\nthat's been a process uh doing things\nthat being purposeful and and having\nreal certain intentions each day\nno matter how big or small\nand you know I wake up I'm looking in\nthe mirror brushing your teeth then stop\nfor a second sake this today's gonna be\nthe day today's gonna be great\num and no matter what you're faced with\nyou know just\nwhatever you come out with yeah yeah\ntalking to yourself also speaking to\npeople I think is very important I think\nas a kid as I said I didn't feel like I\ncould speak to people I didn't feel like\nI could tell my mom about these\nexperiences I felt embarrassed I\ncouldn't tell my dad so I thought he\nwould fulfill think less of me I\ncouldn't talk to any of the teachers\ncouldn't tell my most my friends most of\nthem\nuh weren't particularly of color so\nbut finding\nlearning to be open and speak to people\nor find someone to speak to whether it's\na therapist or whatever that's\nthat's been a huge um help\num I don't not necessarily have a\ntherapist especially someone that I'm\nable to then just have shoot a with\nbasically yeah\num and confide in and Trust like trust\nhas been something that I've never had\ndone didn't trust anybody through those\nexperiments I had as a kid\nand it's been very very hard to build\ntrust with people but creating allies\nfinding things that are that you have in\ncommon with people like my boss for\nexample\nhim and I just\nbreaking each other down and then just\nhaving realizing that was similar in\nmany many ways but also very different\nbut that's not what should divide us we\ncan then be allies and so that's why\nwe're working on\nbeing the most diverse team we're\nworking on\npushing we have we've studied ignite\nwhich is about getting\nyou know improving that pipeline of into\nmotorsport for people\num from underserved communities and\nthere's so much work to do you're doing\nit though man I'm trying to I'm trying\nto and you know to the point you were\nasking earlier like has has enough been\ndone absolutely not in the industry yes\nand like you don't feel that yeah and\nit's not only in either industry it's\neverywhere and is that your goal to sort\nin the industry and then expand out or\nyou're starting you're starting across\nthe board anyway yeah yeah that well\nwith the team with where it's we started\nan organization which called ignite\nwhich we both fund and that is focused\non the sport Motorsport in general\nbut Mission 44 is focused on a much you\nknow societal challenges and barriers\nand and education\nand\num that's a focused in the UK at the\nmoment but I want to bring that over to\nthe states absolutely man\num you know hopefully by at least 2024\num also just been to Africa and there is\nso much Beauty there and I really really\nwant to have an imp you know really want\nto help there as well so yeah\num we will continue to expand but we're\none of the one of the few black founding\nnon-profit organizations in UK and with\num black CEO for example a very diverse\ngroup of people\num and just having those conversations\nwith people of just what a diverse\nWorkforce means and how that bet can\nbenefit you when you have people from\ndifferent backgrounds all coming up with\na diverse diverse thought and creation\nit's that's how you have more success\nyeah it's a no it's a no-brainer when\nyou hear it and you're just like wow\nthat makes so much sense and creativity\nis better and you you'd be able to come\nup with far more innovative ideas and\nyou've got so many more cultures now\nbeing celebrated involved and I I feel\nlike\nit's\nit's interesting to me that the world\nhasn't caught on with that yet like it's\nit's interesting that even despite there\nbeing progress there's not enough\nprogress but\nwhat what is the block like what is the\nstop is it a mindset is it just habits\nand laziness like what is the actual\nlike if you got to the core of it from\neveryone you've been speaking to like\nwhat are you what is the issue is the\nissue that\nyeah is the issue just laziness and just\noh this is the way things have always\nbeen or is it or is there actually like\na setup I don't have the answer to it I\nI ask that question all the time and\nI come up with lots of different\ntheories in my mind\num sometimes I'm like maybe people don't\njust don't care maybe people's problems\nare so big that they don't have time to\nfocus on other things and it's hard\nenough just to do the thing that you're\nfocused on or just overcoming the issue\nthat you're overcoming so how am I gonna\nhave more time to yeah\nto speak about these things why should I\ntake the risk and risk my next step and\nso I feel like it's about learning to be\nselfless right and\num which is difficult to do if you're\nnot being loving yourself and not in a\ngood place yeah so I think it all comes\nto us at hopefully a time at a certain\npoint in our lives\num but also you know we live in a time\nwhere like social media is so it's such\na dangerous it's such a powerful tool\nbut it's also can be so dangerous and so\ndividing\nand I see people out there today and\nthere's people that I admire that I'm\nthat that I would follow and I'd be like\nhow they\nprojecting something that's not\nnecessarily healthy for you for people\nout there how are they projecting\nthey're not using this platform to be\nmore inspirational or be more positive\nand there's others that are but then I\ndon't you can't judge because that's\ntheir Journey\nwell you can continue to do is try to\nyou know with that Maya Angelou quote\nit's about being shining your light as\nbright as you can possibly get it and\nhope that by doing it\nyou I think you automatically uh\nencourage the people around you to want\nto do the same\nand I never truly understood that until\nI see the team that I work with how we\nall Inspire each other how with this\nyear for example we've had the you know\n2022 has been one of the hardest years\nfor us as a team\num as we didn't build a great car and we\nhad our struggles as many people do and\nhow we've had to all come closer and the\nrelationship I've had with people that\nI've worked with this team for 10 years\nand there's conversations we've had this\nyear people have opened up like they've\nnever opened up before people have cried\nlike it's been\nit's been beautiful to see yeah I feel\nlike with some a far better team than\nwe've ever been before because we're\nliving with intention we're actually\ntalking about impact\nthat everyone in the team's gone and had\ndiversity inclusion training no one's\nbeen kind of like I'm not I'm not going\nthrough that class why do I have to go\nand learn with diversity and inclusions\nabout it I'm and why it doesn't impact\nme you know people like I understand it\ndoesn't I wouldn't necessarily notice it\nbut I want to understand it more so I\ncan be better in my working environment\nit's been unbelievable that's amazing\nalso leaders within our sport are now\nnow where we are on a road to being a\nmore diverse and more inclusive sport\nbut I think my job is to continuously\nmake sure that it that that same the\neffort that we're putting in now doesn't\nkind of fall away and become kind of\nyou know just because it was\num trending yeah yeah yeah that is\nactually something that's on the top of\nthe list sustainability is on the top of\nour list and that real true core values\nwe don't go out of our way well you know\nbecause a lot of people it's very easy\nto kind of be led by the money\nsuccess\nbut making sure you stick to your core\nvalues it's so true so important it goes\nback to what you said though that that's\nwhat real leaders do like leaders don't\nfollow what's trending like leaders have\nfocused on transformation and then\nthey're dedicated to transformation and\nthey're going to keep doing it until\nthey see a change whereas followers\nfollow Trends and oh it's not trending\nnow it doesn't matter we'll focus on\nsomething else but you know obviously\nit's so clear just listening to you\ntoday and it's amazing Because unless\nI'm so glad I've had this opportunity to\ntalk to you because\nI can hear just how\ndeeply dedicated you are to this and how\nit's at your core it's like it's\neverything that comes out of your pores\ntoday is just you know which is which is\nreally special to see a value being\nembodied like to empower other people\nyou have to embody the value first it\ndoesn't just you don't just go around\nempowering people and so to hear how\nyour soul and heart is like completely a\nsponge for this stuff and then to\nwanting to go and share it with the\nworld it's really remarkable man ah\nthank you yeah well I mean it's I've I'm\nby far perfect no yeah I know and I\nthink that's like it's not about being\nperfect it's about just every day one\nstep at a time trying to be better\ntrying to do more yeah and\num learning a lot about myself I've had\nto break myself down\nin order to be able to be better and\nwhat do you mean by breaking yourself\ndown uh well just when you when I told\nyou about like all those barriers you\nput up over time to protect yourself and\nthen kind of like knocking those\nbarriers down yes\nand it's enabled me to connect with more\npeople it's enabled me to realize my\nplace in the world and I don't feel like\nI don't belong anymore I feel like uh\nyou know I've got a place and I've got a\npurpose and that's and I think a lot of\npeople are struggling to find that\npurpose but it's okay you'll you will\nfind it do not give up keep getting up\nyou know like just keep saying those\nthings to yourself and you will\neventually find it and you know you're\nalready living in your purpose and\nhaving such a huge impact on so many\npeople you know telling stories which uh\nis it's amazing to see\num I started this production company\ninspired by like Kobe and so many out\nthere but stories for me storytelling I\nwatch a lot of movies I don't know about\nyou but yeah I love movies especially\nSports movies yeah like when I go home\nI'll like I you know order takeaway or\nmake myself some pasta or something like\nthat\nand then I put the plate in front of me\nand I can't eat till I found something\nto watch like my my Escape is watching a\nmovie and I always like to find\nsomething hopefully inspiring yes\nbut what the reason I created this um\nproduction company is because\nyou know until recently we didn't have\nany people of color are superheroes We I\nthink these stories storytelling is so\nso important for people out there for\ninspiring people and and I want to make\nsure that in and everything that I do\nevery project that I work on is with a\ndiverse Workforce like I'm doing this\nfrom one movie with um Brad Pitt and Joe\nkazinski and\num but my job is to make sure that it's\ndiverse behind the camera as it is on\nscreen the story is empowering and\nuplifting\num it's not there's no BS in terms of\nthe racing and\nhopefully one kid will watch it and yeah\nor more and feel empowered to go and do\nsomething great absolutely I love that\nman I'm so glad you're doing that\nbecause when you said do I like movies\nthe movie that came to my mind was uh\nrace have you seen race because yeah so\nlike that the story is unbelievable but\nwhen you watch the movie as well it's\nunbelievable to see what Jesse Owens did\nlike to think that he had to go I can't\neven imagine I can't you know you just\ncan't imagine if everyone's not seen the\nmovie you have to go see them yeah it's\njust one of those movies that's like how\ndo you do that like how do you go and\nrace\nin Nazi Germany like I have like I must\nhave been terrified terrifying and you\nknow there's been so many great stories\nlike that that are out there that need\ntelling yeah\num continuously telling yeah 42 is\nanother one yeah 42 is awesome\num but yeah there is these really unique\npeople out there I think for me being in\nthis sport being the only one and being\nthe first is that is that has been\nlonely yeah and that has been really\nreally a difficult thing to kind of\nunderstand and and\num through my life I know many many\npeople like Jesse for example being the\nfirst and only\nat the time you know I've taken huge\ninspiration from him Nelson Mandela was\nlike ah he's just one of my biggest\nbiggest Inspirations\num I was so so fortunate to get to meet\nhim when I was I was like 23 or\nsomething oh wow what was that like yeah\nah it was mind-blowing I mean when you\nwhen you then I got to form one and you\nhave the success all these things come\nand you don't even you've dreamed of\nbeing a racing driver but you didn't\ndream that all the other things of all\nthe other things that come along like\nmeeting other unbelievable people I went\nto Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday in\nLondon\nand I was sat on his table in this huge\nroom full of like\nBill Clinton was there like uh\nDenzel Washington was there open Winfrey\nsat right next to me like all these\npeople that you would never ever in the\nmillion years dream of think you would\never get to meet yeah and then you\ndiscover and they're also just human\nbeings with feelings and with emotions\nand with their own challenges but I was\nso young at the time it was it was\nI don't even recognize myself when I\nlook back at me seven years ago\nI see a shell of me and I think I look\ntoday and see myself and know myself so\nmuch more\num\nand that's again that's an empowering\nexperience to be in but yeah I went into\nthe room and met him and he sat at his\nchair\nand it was like walking into I was like\nGod or like a king you know and his silk\nshirt was\nhis Aura was something you could see his\nAura his smile he was beaming\nthat was the most probably the most\nimpactful day for me\num as a youngster wow Lewis it's\nunbelievable talking to you I mean what\nyou've achieved on the track off the\ntrack and now I'm even more excited to\nsee you continue to achieve uh as your\njourney continues because I'm going to\nsay this and I don't say this often and\nI genuinely my team can vouch for and\neveryone else can listen back to any\nepisode\nI think you're one of the most\non-purpose people I've ever interviewed\nand I appreciate that no and I genuinely\nlike it just there's nothing else that\ncomes from your being apart from what\nyour purpose currently is with Mission\n44 and and it's it's really remarkable\nto meet someone who's so on purpose I\ndon't I genuinely don't have that\nexperience and the only person you\nreminded me of was Kobe he had it too\nwhen I was around him there was no\nthere's nothing else it wasn't like he\nmissed anything he was at peace he was\nit was peace with purpose you know and\nyou have that same Aura and spirit from\nfrom at least my experience thank you so\nmuch it's so kind of you yeah and I\nreally mean that I really mean that it's\nincredible so uh we we end every episode\nwith a Fast Five which means every\nquestion has to be answered in one word\nto one sentence maximum okay and we ask\nthese same questions to every guest\nthat's ever been on the show I should be\nprepared for that because I've seen you\nso well no the the first question is\nwhat's the best advice you've ever heard\nor received I think it was the achieve\nmy dad uh never give up that's been like\nthe slogan in the back of my mind every\nsingle day the other one would be um\njust that you'll always be learning and\nthat's what I learned from Nelson\nMandela he was like I'm 19 and I'm still\nlearning today and like I was like what\ncan you tell me it's like I'm still\nlearning today and it's okay to be\nlearning you're always going to be\nlearning something new and growing\nyourself wow that's beautiful very like\nwow but like guys that was pretty basic\nbut no but it's not it's it's powerful\nknowing he said that yeah as in the fact\nthat he said that on his 90th birthday\nthat is powerful because it's a long way\nto go yeah and it's like a lot of people\nI feel like a lot of people feel by 90\nespecially him he has so much wisdom to\nshare yeah but the fact that his wisdom\nwas I'm just learning that yeah I'm\nstill learning that's pretty cool all\nright second question uh what's the\nworst advice you ever heard or received\ngive up it's just the opposite yeah yeah\nliterally the worst bit of advice and it\nwasn't I mean it wasn't necessarily\nadvice but I when I was younger there\nwas other parents of other racing\ndrivers I was racing against\nI remember this one guy and he's like\nshe just you just don't have it you\nshould just give up their parents were\nsaying their parents the grown man in\nthese 40s or 50s told me that and I was\neight told you told me yeah to my face\nand I remember just being so like what\nam I supposed to do with that what do\nyou mean give up what was the reason I\nwould imagine because I was beating his\nkid\nmaybe I don't know I never really\nthought of what the reason would be and\nthe same with teachers you know yeah\nwhat is this crap you know you're\nterrible at this you'll never know go to\nthe next set you're never gonna amount\nto anything why are you even here I had\na parent I had a teacher tell me that\nand wow it broke me down so much\nquestion number three uh\nhow do you deal with loss and how do you\ndeal with the win I think success is as\nI mentioned earlier short-lived success\nis there's a lot less learn in success\nit's like the tip of the iceberg it's\nthe losses and it's the failures and\nit's the continuously just the\nperseverance that you needed that you\nneed to do like I love that image of the\niceberg where you see the sea level and\nthe iceberg on the top that everyone\nsees but below is what people don't get\nto see and it's it's relevant for every\nsingle person out there it's finding\nyour core it's letting yourself know\nit's okay to feel the pain it's okay to\naccept that your failures\nand you know put it on you it's like\nit's just another another notch on your\nbelt that is going to make you stronger\nand just knowing that that is the case\nI've failed so many more times and I've\nsucceeded so many more\nand that people don't even know maybe\nnecessarily about or see\nand still today I'm making those\nfailures those mistakes and or making\nmistakes\nbut I know that that's straight that's a\npart of the journey that's that's what\nI'm then harnessing and that's what's\nmaking me stronger all right question\nnumber four out of five uh what's\nsomething that you thought you valued\nbut you don't value anymore immaterial\nstuff at some stage and you actually\nrealize they're not important and we\nlive in such a materialistic world so\nlearning to detach yourself from that\nand know that it's moments with special\npeople it's moments with your with your\nfamily with your loved ones with your\nfriends that are what you get to take\nwith you when you stop you know when\nlife comes to an end right I truly\nbelieve that it's those memories that\nare what yeah memories of you also which\nlingers not what you had or what you're\nable to attain\num so I think that was something that\ntook me a long time to to to learn and\nyeah whilst I still have things I don't\nhave\nI've actually tried to unclutter my life\nbecause we\nnow I remember my dad used to call me\ninto the garage and we used to go\nthrough all the crap that he would keep\nI don't know if your dad your parents do\nthe same thing yeah geez we just used to\ncall me and it was the worst day ever\nwhen I had to help him clean out the\ngarage but we hold on to so many things\nright\num so just decluttering your life yeah\nmaking it more simple\num so that's why I like I love to go and\nsurfing that's like the most tranquil\nkind of thing that I get to do sit in\nthe ocean and sometimes just sit and\nponder about life what I'm gonna do next\nand that's my getaway I think people\nhave to find that balance of work\nbecause if you just work work work work\nand you don't replenish your energy with\npositive things then you will just\ncontinue to be breaking yourself down so\nI try and find that balance I think\neveryone needs to do that yeah that's\nbeautiful surfing skydiving those are\nyours uh Fifth and final question if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\nholy crap uh the one of the things that\nI'm like I struggle with every day is\nand it's just how life is and it's been\nthe way for thousands of years that\nthere is such a disparity between\nwealthy and and the poor and you know\nyou still when you drive around L.A\nthere's still so many people living on\nthe streets\nthis should you shouldn't be able to\nhave billions\nright I think this there should be a\nlimit to how much you can have because\nthere's enough to go around to everyone\nso somehow create a lore that creates\nmore equality\nyeah and equal access to every for\neveryone you know um\nI don't know how to deal with implant\nImplement that law that's all good but\nlike geez man I've met kids that are\nstarving yeah same\nand you think oh God like\nhow we we are so so lucky so many of us\num and knowing that and not taking\nadvantage of of your everyday\num is so so important it does what law\nwould you change it does no I think\nthat's beautiful that's I mean we've\nyeah I mean now now yeah I see I see who\nyou did there if I had to create a law\nin the world that everyone had to follow\nthis is at least my today answer and\nmaybe it would change as well is\nit kind of and it's inspired by what\nwe're talking about I think I I wish at\nschool the law was that every child had\nto learn about emotional mastery\nto understand how to understand other\npeople's emotions and understand their\nemotions and take that into\nconsideration when making decisions and\nif every child was given that exposure\nto emotional Mastery then\npeople would just have tools of how to\ndeal with their own pain and someone\nelse's pain and\nand how to deal with when your parents\nare going through pain because I feel\nlike pain is the issue we have any pain\ntoday that's so good man I told you not\nto come out\nyou're so right Satisfied by you it's\ngoing back to education that's why I\nlike when you go to school you don't\nlearn all the they don't prepare you\nenough for what's to come not at all and\nand that's tapping into mental health as\nyou mentioned exactly that's exactly\nyeah and that's kind of where my purpose\nis right like my purpose is that feeling\nof\nyou know when I went on lived as a monk\nthat's where I got exposed to emotional\nMastery like that was the goal of what\nmonk training was about and I was 21 22\nwhen I did that wow that's still young\nsays a lot about that shows a lot about\nyou yeah yeah but it was it was kind of\nlike a Fascination that I had I was just\nlike well if I can't understand my mind\nthen how can you live life like that\nthat so so anyway it comes from but it\ncomes from what you're saying that the\neducation that needs to happen at a\nyounger level so Louis it has been such\na honor and a pleasure talking today my\nman it's a huge responsibility that\nyou've taken on\nfor yourself for the world and\nI don't think there could be anyone\nbetter doing it and I really really hope\nthat any help that I can offer any help\nthat my community can offer please know\nthat we're right here with you thank you\nright behind you so thank you so much on\npurpose Community I know would love to\nget behind anything that we can yeah\ndude I'm so uh I'm so so grateful for\nthe time you give me today yeah and and\nagain for like what you what you do\num because you're having such a positive\nimpact on some so many people including\nme you know so when you perhaps don't\nrealize it you're yeah you know you're\nhaving such a big impact\num and I'm so grateful to you for that\nmate thank you man it means the world\ncoming from you honestly thank you\neveryone who's been uh listening and\nwatching today make sure you go get\neducated about Mission 44 about the\nHamilton commission really incredible\ninitiatives that Lewis started that are\nleading the way to make sure that\ndiversity and inclusion are taken more\nseriously across all Industries which I\nthink we would all agree with and to\nanyone else who's watching or listening\nmake sure you tag Lewis and I on social\nmedia with your biggest insights there\nwere so many words of wisdom that Lewis\nshared I want to know which things stuck\nout to you which things made a\ndifference in your mind and the biggest\nthing is I want you to pass this on to\nsomeone right there's someone who needs\nto hear Lewis's story that's going to\ntransform their life and I want you to\npass it on he shared so many people that\ninspired him we know he's a huge\ninspiration to so many make sure you\nshare this with someone because you have\nno idea whose life you might change\nthank you so much if you love this\nepisode you'll love my interview with\nKobe Bryant on how to be strategic and\nobsessive to find your purpose"
