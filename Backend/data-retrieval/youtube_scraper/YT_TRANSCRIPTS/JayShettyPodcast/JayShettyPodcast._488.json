lives it all she is the\nsame off screen as she is on screen uh\nplease welcome to my welcome to the show\nmy dear friend uh an incredible thinker\nMel Robbins oh my God can I just hug you\nyeah of course you can you oh God oh my\ngosh I just love you too I love you too\nI I just you know we've the best I think\nwe've you know whenever we've connected\nthe first time we met I was thinking\nabout that last week in Montreal the\nfirst time we met we were also both\nspeaking and we spent an evening\ntogether then and just hit it off and I\nappreciate it that was like four years\nago now yeah you know I think we've all\nhad this experience\nwhere you've been at a bar or you've\nbeen at a big party\nand you look across a room\nand your eyes meet somebody and it's\nlike\nimmediate like uh tractor beam electric\npull I felt that way about you for a\nlong time just by watching what you're\nputting out on social media and so I had\nhad a brain and soul crush on you for a\nlong time and so when we met it was like\noh my God so and you know what else I\nlove is that I love like I get both you\nand your amazing wife I love that you\nare decades younger than me and very\ncreative and here's what else I love\nabout you I consider you not only a very\ndear friend but my own personal monk\nthere you have it\nI love it I love it just put me in your\npocket right there right there\nto talk to you today literally the last\ntime you came on it was unbelievable and\nI've genuinely been wanting wanting to\nhave you back on like as much as you\nwant to come back uh but I know there's\na few things we want to talk about today\nand I wanted to start off with this idea\nthat you've always talked about how you\nlearned about things the hard way there\nwere always challenges and even now when\nwe talk offline we shared that even last\nweek we were talking about challenges we\nwere both going through in in building\nthis opportunity to serve others and and\nI wanted to ask you like what do you\nthink is the hardest thing you're\nworking on right now like what's the\nmost challenging thing you're working on\ninternally or externally could be\ncreatively it could be\nhabit wise what is what is something\nthat you're struggling with or grappling\nwith that you're working through\nhappiness wow okay yeah happiness it's\ninteresting I was\num getting ready to come over here this\nmorning and so I my daughter goes to\nschool here at the Thornton school for\nmusic she's a senior and she spent the\nnight with me last night I'm going to\ntell you the story because it's relevant\nabout both learning things the hard way\nand about happiness\nso she slept in my bed with me last\nnight and it was so awesome and I just\nlove her and she's 22 and she's about to\nlike burst into the next chapter of her\nlife it is so exciting and I miss her\nterribly\nterribly and I oh I'm gonna get like\ntotally choked up when I think about it\nbecause I live on the other side of the\ncountry and I think one of the hardest\nthings that you have to do in life if\nyou really love somebody is to encourage\nthem to leave to encourage them to grow\nand\num I can't believe I choked up I'm\ngetting about this because I mean this\njust happened this morning and I was\nlaying in bed and she's sound asleep you\nknow like sprawled out like those 22\nyear olds sleep and sweating and you\nknow just like this and I thought oh I\nwant to take a picture of this moment\nand then I thought no she's going to\nkill me because she looks terrible and\nyou know how that rolls when you're 20\nyears old and so I closed my eyes to\njust capture the memory and I thought\nwhy is it that I am always\ngripping onto the thing\nthat makes me unhappy\nwhat is it about this campaign I call it\nthe campaign of misery\nlike instead of focusing on the fact\nthat here I am first of all lucky enough\nto be in Los Angeles to be able to have\nthe means to go see her for parents\nweekend that I have a relationship with\nher where she would want to come and\njust snuggle up and spend the night that\nshe is pursuing her passion and dream of\nbeing a singer-songwriter that she is\njust killing it she's happy\nwhy am I always defaulting to the loss\nand so when I say that I'm working on\nhappiness\nwhat I've realized about myself Jay is\nthat I have done a lot of things in life\nbut I've spent the vast majority of my\nlife being so busy\nand keeping myself so busy\nas a means to outrun I think a\ndeep-seated unhappiness and that when\nthe pandemic hit and I had to slow down\nand I had to truly say to myself okay\nyou can't go anywhere you cannot\nregulate your anxiety by running to\nTarget you can't catch a plane you can't\nyou like it's you and your like you and\nyourself right now Mel and all the\ncoping mechanisms that you used to have\nthat distracted you from the fact that\nyou're just not that happy\nthey're not there anymore and unless I\nwant to drink myself into the ground\nwhich I don't and numb it or hit the\nvape pen or take a gut like unless I\nwant to numb it I got to deal with it\nand so I've spent the last two years and\nI continue\nto focus right now on the number one\ngoal that I have which is to learn how\nto be happy and content wherever I am\nand so this morning is the perfect\nexample of catching this profound\nsadness which is part of The Human\nExperience deeply missing somebody is\nalso about loving them right and\nnoticing that I was going into the\nnegative and part of being content and\nbeing happy wherever I am is not trying\nto fix things it's being okay with\nthings it's allowing the emotion to rise\nup and then noticing that there's a\ndifferent way to feel and so in that\nmoment I just am doing what I'm doing a\nlot of which is just breathing through\nthose deep moments where I'm like why am\nI complaining about this it's so stupid\nwhy am I obsessing about this thing\ntomorrow and I'm not even here right now\nand reframing things in a more positive\nway and this might surprise people\nbecause I I am a very positive person I\nam a very optimistic person\nbut when I really slow down\nmy mind runs a million miles an hour and\nnormally it's 15 steps ahead which means\nI'm never content where I am and so I've\nbeen doing a ton of work like in my\nnervous system in my body instead of\ngoing right up here and trying to\nwrestle with my thoughts I've been going\ndown into here to just anchor in my body\nand slow things down and be physically\nwhere I am where my feet are and so then\nthere was a second thing that happened\nso again I'm working on happiness that's\nthe thing I'm really like working on\nit's like a muscle right\num I'm in the bathroom and I am terrible\nat doing my hair I know it looks really\ndecent today but normally I look like a\nfreaking Labradoodle on a human day like\nthat's just me I just have never figured\nout the hair situation and so I finally\nsaid that's it I have got to figure out\nhow to make my hair look halfway okay\nlike I'm not even looking for amazing\nI'm just looking for okay and so I was\nwatching YouTube I'm learning the\ntutorials I've got the right sprays and\nso Kendall comes rolling in after she\nwakes up and I am sitting there trying\nto curl my hair right with this big fat\ncurl and I'm terrible at it Jay and all\nof a sudden I hit my freaking ear and\nI'm like\noh and I'm like oh my god I've just\nburned my ear and Kendall casually goes\nwell you gotta learn somehow\nand she walks out of the room I think\nthere is so much wisdom in that\nbecause that is how you learn\nthat is how you learn how close to hold\na curling iron to your ear you burn\nyourself\nand then your whole body absorbs the\nlesson and you don't go that close to\nthe fire next time\nand I'm doing that dance with happiness\nand contentment\nthat when I Feel the Fire of discontent\nor friction or complaining or looking\nfor what's wrong\nI pull the curling iron a little\naway from the ear\nand I go back into a safer calmer place\nthat was a beautiful answer I I didn't\nknow what to expect when I asked that\nquestion I really appreciate you\nyou know going that inward with it\nbecause you could have gone a number of\nways I I fully understand and empathize\nwhat you're saying because my mom and my\nfamily do something similar so and I\nlove my mum I have a great relation with\nmy mum she's amazing and anything that's\ngood about me is because of her but\nevery time I go back to London the day I\nland my family will say well you're only\nhere for 21 days\nam I 21 days like that's three weeks\neven if you add up all the hours weekly\nthat you spend with time with someone it\nprobably won't account for 21 full days\nyeah with full presence and then a week\nwe'll go and be like oh you've only got\n40 14 days left or you've only got seven\ndays left oh you're leaving today and\nand that mindset just keeps forcing you\nto think that day 21 is day one right as\nin that day 21 days left is the same as\none day left and you're living all 21\ndays as there's only one day left and\nI've I've taken time and I've sat with\nmy mom so many times to have that\nconversation with her and I said Mom if\nyou celebrate that we have 21 days I'm\ngonna make the most of it and we're\ngoing to create new memories and create\nnew experiences then you're going to be\nhappier for these 21 days and yes you're\ngoing to miss me the same it's not going\nto change that and I'm gonna miss you so\nI I have personal experience of that on\nthe other end of it with having that\nconversation with my mom\nwhere she's really grown in\nunderstanding how that thought hasn't\nserved her right and she's so much\nhappier for it now when I go back so\nyeah that I definitely identify with\nthat what you touched on at the end\nthere though was really interesting to\nme when you talk about happiness\nit sounds like you believe you deserve\nit and you sound like you believe it's\nyours for the taking like it's like it\nis a clear goal Direction it's there\nyeah and I think what's happened is\nsubconsciously all consciously so many\nof us don't feel we deserve happiness or\nwe don't feel we're worthy of happiness\nor we actually think mediocrity is a\nsafer place to live because then we\ndon't have our expectations being unmet\nwe don't have the fall of I wanted this\nbut I got this right and so I've been I\nhad a friend the other day who sent me a\nmessage and he said take a look at this\nand it was all about how really we\nshouldn't strive for happiness We should\nstrive for mediocrity because mediocrity\nis where most people will end up so that\nwas like literally this is the message\nso my friend message me he goes what do\nyou think of this I think it sucks I\nthink it's the worst advice I've ever\nfreaking heard how about that it's the\ndumbest thing I've ever heard here\nhere's the thing Jay\nso one of the things I also want to say\nis that I'm 54 and\nit's taken me a long time to figure out\nthat I was actually not a happy person\nand I don't think I I really truly\nunderstood\nWhat happiness is and maybe I'm using\nthe wrong word maybe the word is the\nproblem because I always Associated\nhappiness with like parties and laughter\nand like I'm just like full of joy and\nI'm and I just you know it's like this\nvery positive thing and again I am a\npositive person I'm a very optimistic\nperson but if you were to put a speaker\non my head and broadcast the things I\nsaid to myself you would literally check\nme in to the seventh floor at Mass\nGeneral Hospital in Boston Massachusetts\nbecause it was a constant drum beat of\nnegativity and as I one by one by one J\nstarted to fix the problems in my\nmarriage and my finances with my anxiety\nas I built a business you know a lot of\npeople are surprised to learn that most\nof what you see that I've built has been\nbuilt in the last six years\nliterally and so I as I started fixing\nthings outside\nthat default drum beat\ndid not go away\nit just was a situation where I no\nlonger had anything outside of me that\nwas rationally wrong so I turned it back\non me\nand just started hammering me\nin in crazy ways I'll give you an\nexample so this is where I started to\nhave this breakthrough so I was sitting\nmy my husband and I have just uh bought\na house in Vermont and I know you guys\nyou know are in your new home it's an\nincredible thing to do it is our dream\nhouse it's the house that his parents\nbuilt it's the family house we not only\nwere able to purchase this thing we have\nbeen able to completely renovate it make\nit our own this place is the closest\nplace to God that I have ever been we\nsit nestled between mountains with a 140\nmile view straight down a valley with\ncascading like it is\njust spectacular when I would sit in\ntherapy sessions eight years ago and my\ntherapist would ask me to come up with\nlike a um you know like a totem or a\nspiritual guide or Vision whatever for\ntruth or God or whatever it's always\nthis View and so lo and behold eight\nyears later we freaking live there\nand I'm sitting on this covered deck\nlooking down the valley my daughter is\nsitting next to me her other daughter\nwho lives in Boston who's 23 and it's\nSunday\nand normally on Sundays\nI'm not even present on Sundays because\nI'm now got the Sunday scaries I'm now\nthinking about the week ahead she is\nstarting\nto now do that okay I gotta get going I\ngot I gotta pack the car I gotta get\ngoing I got I got a big week at work\nthis week and and it's 7 30 in the\nmorning\non a spectacular day\nand the energy is starting and I\nrecognize the energy because that is the\ncampaign of misery\nthat I have lived with\nfor 50 years\nand I'm sitting there and I'm thinking\noh this is interesting\nthat's me\nand then I stopped in that moment Jay\nand I thought\nI don't feel that right now\nI just feel\nthat exactly where I am looking at this\nView\nis exactly\nwhere I'm supposed to be and it was so\nprofound it's almost like that moment\nwhere Eckhart Tolle\nhas on the bench\nin the beginning of the Power of Now\nwhere I have this profound experience\nwhere I think wait a minute\nis this\nWhat happiness is\nthat I'm not 15 steps ahead\nI'm just able to be right here\nwithout the anxiety without the stress I\nmean that is like a revolutionary\nexperience for me I don't think I had\never not felt the default of a revved up\nnervous system an anxious mind or a\nto-do list that was a mile long\nand I don't want to go back to that sort\nof frenetic busyness that creates\nchronic stress and you know the\nchallenge for me right now is how do I\nstay in a space that's that's happy\nbecause I love the game of building a\nbusiness I love pushing myself I love\nlike and I realized oh wait you actually\nneed both\nyou need deep spiritual quiet time\nand you need the busyness of Los Angeles\nor Boston or New York in small Sprints\nbut that can't be your default anymore\nwoman and that's uh that's such a great\nrealization and reflection I think when\nyou come to that and it it takes a lot\nof self-acceptance to come to that\nbecause\nI think we think of life as binary like\nyou have to make a choice you're either\ngoing to be a hustler or you're going to\nbe peaceful you're either going to be a\nwinner or you're going to be a loser\nyou're either going to be\nwisdom and Zen or you're going to be\nmoney and materialistic right and it's\nalmost like you feel you have to make\nthose choices early in life\nand I think when you came in here we\nwere talking about something and\nI really really think it's something\nthat a lot of our listeners\nwill resonate with the idea that so many\nof us\nexperience pain of not going after what\nwe want or what we need or what we feel\nis our calling because of the pain that\ncomes with that yeah and so we settle\nfor the pain of where we are yeah and I\nthink those two ideas are related\nbecause again we think there's this\nchoice you have to make at any point in\ntime where it's like I'm either going to\nlive the life of my dreams or I'm gonna\nbe stuck forever and then we're like\nokay well I'll be stuck forever because\nmy dream seems so far away I remember\nbeing there and it's always hard\nto help everyone who's listening realize\nhow much I felt that way so how old were\nyou I was this was six years ago for me\nyeah oh my God that's right you guys\nhave this crazy parallel yeah six years\nago so six years ago I was working a\nsafe corporate job\nsix months from now I was about to be\nmarried to Riley and I was making\n31 500 pounds a year and that was my\nsalary at this company and I was doing\nextremely well at the company so I had a\ngood track to to progress there\nand I'm sitting there going I've been\nthere for two years and I'm like I don't\nthink this is where I'm meant to be I\nwas looking at people who'd been at the\ncompany for decades I was I've always\nsaid to people look 10 20 years ahead of\nyou and look at that person in the\ncompany and go is that where I want to\nbe and I was like well even if they paid\nme as much as that person's paid even if\nI got all the benefits that person got I\ndon't think I want to do that in my 50s\nand so I thought to myself okay well\nthen I have to take a risk so and\nobviously that was like a two-year\njourney of even convincing myself let's\ntalk about that if someone's sitting\nthere right now passionate about\nsomething wanting to get inspired\nwanting to do something but they're\nsettling for the pain of where they are\nand that's why I asked that mediocrity\nand happiness question yeah it is really\nthat dance between I'm gonna settle\nfor where I'm at where I'm going to be\nwhere I want to be how do you think\nabout that Journey how do you you know\nwhat just popped into my mind yeah weird\ngrade cancer if you got diagnosed with a\ncancer\nthat was treatable would you try to\ntreat your cancer yes of course you\nwould\nbecause otherwise it would kill you when\nyou feel this call or this this burning\ndesire and I feel like we all have this\nflame inside of us we are not like a\nboiler where the pilot light can blow\nout that is not how a human being is\nwired you whether you're stuck whether\nyou're in pain whether you're suffering\nyou still have this this flame inside\nyou that is burning\nand when you actively engage in your own\ncampaign of misery\nand you actively tell yourself the\nreasons why it's not going to work or\nthe reasons why you can't do it or the\nreasons why now is not the time or\nyou're never going to make it happen or\nit was great for Jay or great for for\nMel but nothing ever works out for when\nyou engage in your own campaign of\nmisery you are creating literally a\ncancer inside of you that eats at you\nand we don't realize that by engaging in\nthis campaign of misery because it's\nactive\nthat flame is burning inside you and you\nare actively convincing yourself not to\ndo anything\nit is an active engagement that's why I\ncall it a campaign\nbecause that flame is going to keep on\nburning which is why the campaign has to\nget louder and the excuses have to get\nlouder and you know what starts to\nhappen\nis you start to listen to that campaign\nand you start to feel pain\nbecause there's something burning inside\nof you\nand the only cure for this\nis to stop listening to that campaign\nand simply start taking small steps just\none every day toward the thing that you\nwant I talked to my daughter about this\nall the time so she dreams absolutely\ndreams of being a singer-songwriter solo\nartist with a a successful career\nliterally Stadium tours and if I'm being\nperfectly honest this kid has all of the\ntalent and all of the like she's one of\nthose five tool players and she is a\ngreat person kind and just awesome\nand she's even on a program for it the\nbest in the country she has everything\nshe just has to do the work\nwhat is the work\nwell the work\nis simply writing crappy songs every day\nthe work is not listening to the\ncampaign of misery because all around\nyou you're going to see evidence of this\nperson's better that person this or this\none's that or that uh\nwhen you listen to that campaign in your\nhead it is like a cancer inside it\ncauses pain because you can feel\nwhen you are giving up on your own\npotential and that is the worst kind of\nLife to Live and we're we're all I've\nremembered I was the president of that\ncampaign in my own life like you know I\nwas like when when you and and I want\npeople to understand this is that\neveryone you think is doing something\ngood with their life at one point they\nwere the president presidents of this\ncampaign of misery in their own life I\nremember saying well that never is going\nto happen for me those things only\nhappen to those people I remember also\nwatching things and this was the key one\nthat I realized had to go me and my\nfriends and and my dream when I was\nyoung was to be a spoken word rap artist\nlike that was my goal like I've always\nloved words I've always loved having a\nlarge vocabulary I've always loved\nbending words and making them rhyme and\nand I think that's why I love words\ntoday and what we do so much is that and\nI we would sit there and we would watch\nrappers or artists that were up and\ncoming and we would critique them and we\nwould almost talk badly about them we\nwould criticize them and we talk about\nhow rubbish they were and how untalented\nthey were and or if we had those\nopportunities how good we'd be and I\nrealized that today's culture is\npropagating that even more because now\nwe're just scrolling through Tick Tock\nor Instagram and you'll see someone\nwho's doing what you want to do and you\nmay think you can do it better\nbut instead of doing it we're spending\nour time watching someone else doing it\nand going well that sucks that's rubbish\nright I actually have friends who\nmessage me stuff like that sometimes and\nthey'll be like look you know I've been\nwanting to make videos for a while and\nthey'll send me someone who's made a bad\nvideo in their opinion and I said you\nknow what's really interesting when\nyou're on social media you look at\neveryone who's doing worse than you I\nsaid when I'm on social media I look at\neveryone's doing better than me and\nlearn right it's like there's there's\ntwo mindsets you're either criticizing\nsomeone or you're creating and learning\nand growing and so\nI I just feel what you're saying is so\ntrue and I think I spent so much time\nthinking I had something but then not\ndoing anything with it yeah so a couple\nthings yeah I want to give everybody a\nvisual yes because I find J's into words\nI gotta have a picture like my mind is\nthat the words mind you are either in\nthe stands\ncommenting about the game or you're on\nthe court playing it and right now I\nwant you to think about that flame\ninside you that dream that you have\nand I'm gonna go back to my daughter who\nis on the court but she will be the\nfirst to say that for many years she was\nengaged in her own campaign of misery\nsitting in the stands telling herself\nwhy she can't get on the court right now\nand so I like that visual because at any\nmoment it literally like Cuts right to\nthe truth are you in the stands\ncriticizing who the people who are\nplaying the game or being jealous of\nthem or in the stands telling yourself\nit's not time to jump in or are you on\nthe freaking Court there's only two\nplaces to be in life that's it there is\nno middle ground here and so what I want\nto say also is that being in the stands\nit is loud it is an active thing that\nyou're doing this is not a passive thing\nthat we do to ourselves we actively\nargue against our dream and our\npotential\nand that is a thousand percent tied to\nyour happiness to your confidence\nbecause if you are arguing against your\nown god-given potential\nyou are actively destroying your\nconfidence you're actively destroying\npossibility in your life and here's the\nthing you've heard\npeople know when they have imposter\nsyndrome\nthey know it they talk about it openly\nand I also hate the term fake it till\nyou make it and here's why when you say\nI'm just going to fake it till you make\nit you are calling yourself a fake\nit amplifies your self-doubt instead say\nthis I'm going to get on the court and\ntry until I make it because the pain of\nsitting in the stands and never getting\ndown there is way greater\nthan tripping on the court\nway greater you're causing your and this\nis the thing I want people to understand\nyou are causing yourself so much pain\nby laughing off and making jokes about\nhow it's never going to happen you're\ncausing yourself so much pain by\nthinking about it\nget out of the freaking stands and get\nback on the court in your life I did\nthis to myself for years about the\npodcast you know I'll tell you some\ninsane stories so here I am crazy\nsuccessful in the audiobook world the\nthe most successful self-published\naudiobook in the history of audiobooks\nis the five second rule that leads to a\nseven book audible original deals with\naudible because of the success of that\nand I kept telling myself Jay I'd look\nat you you know and I'd look at a ton of\nour other friends who you know have\nthese amazing podcasts you Rich Roll\nlike you know just everybody and I'd be\nlike I missed the vote I'm too late\nthere's two million podcasts out there\nnow I I can't do this I don't have\nanything different to say than Jay Jay's\nalready got you know it covered like why\nwould I jump in there now and then I\nwould like I in the stands for six years\nand you know what else I would tell\nmyself well you're just successful\nbecause audible's your partner and if\nyou were to try this you're going to\nfall flat on your face\nand you don't have time and here's\nanother thing that I tell myself well\nwho on Earth is going to come to Boston\nto sit in a studio with you Mel\neverybody's remote now Boston is not a\nmedia Place nobody travels there like\njust in the freaking stands telling\nmyself no no no now here's the thing\nabout campaigns of misery it does not\nactually mute\nthe heartache and the pull that you have\nbecause your dreams actually can't leave\nyou they're meant for you and so all\nthat campaigning or the drinking or the\nnumbing out or the avoiding the thing\nthat is inside you\nit doesn't make the dream go away\nit just creates more pain\nand so finally you know it was two years\nago that I'm like I have to like take my\nown advice\nand I gotta make some major changes\nbecause I knew when I was going to step\ninto the podcast phase that I was going\nto make it the only thing that I was\ndoing that I needed to complete all the\nspeaking engagements that I had I needed\nto create different boundaries around\nlike I had to get serious about taking\nthe steps and getting on that court and\nthat's what I've been doing for the last\ntwo years and a lot of people don't know\nthat I actually got my start in 2007\nhosting a local radio show\nand I have wanted to get back to radio\nfor almost 12 years because I love the\nintimacy of it and so and I can't like\nyou know this you can't share your life\nin real time in an audiobook no I\ndefinitely you can't do it in a\n60-second reel but I too sat there in\nthe stands\nactively engaged in my campaign of\nmisery here's another area of my life\nwhere I engaged in campaign of misery\nloneliness\nI have been profoundly lonely\nfor a while now\nand by lonely I don't mean alone because\nthere's people around me but I have and\nI think a lot of people feel this way\nand I know a lot of women do\nparticularly when your kids get older\nand the social you know like things\nchange and I think a lot of us are\nstruggling with adult friendship\nand especially coming out of quarantine\npeople are now kind of I don't want to\nleave my house not because of anything\ngoing on but because I like being home\nyeah and so I started to get serious\nabout the fact that I was really in the\nstands in my life complaining to myself\nthat I didn't see my friends that I\ndon't have friends that I'm I'm really\nlonely but I wasn't on the court\nwhat are you going to do about it\nbecause it's easy to actually start\nmaking friends if you send texts every\nday to people and you make plans yeah oh\nJay's in Montreal why don't I text him\noh he's in the same Hotel why don't I go\nup Seven floors and go see him\nbecause my monk is in the penthouse you\nknow what I'm saying\nI love what you're saying I can resonate\nwith it so much and there's a journey\nfrom where is your campaign of misery\nright now oh that's a great question\nwhere is my current campaign where are\nyou in the stands in your life Jay mine\nis actually I grew up\nloving uh I went to public speaking in\ndrama school and public speaking became\na huge part of my life and drama stopped\nand drama is something I'd love to get\nback into really oh yeah I loved acting\ngrowing up I loved the idea of getting\ninto someone else's emotions and I love\nthe idea of learning about new\ncharacters and understanding and I keep\nwanting to do it and two years ago three\nyears ago\nwhen the Bad Boys movie came out I was\nasked by Sony to be in their theatrical\ntrailer for TV and so I played the role\nof a therapist with Will Smith and mine\nLawrence and I had so much it was so\nuncomfortable because I hadn't done it\nfor so long I went to drama school for\nseven years it was so uncomfortable\ndoing it and I got an acting coach that\nweek and I and I practiced and I learned\nall my lines and then I got there on the\nday and they gave me a new script they\nsaid all the scripts changed and I'm\ngoing guys I had five days I knew about\nthis five days ago I had an acting coach\nevery day friend two hours a day and\nthey give me a new script then they come\nin 10 minutes before I've been waiting\naround for two hours learning this new\nscript we get there and they say oh by\nthe way will and Martin have scrapped\nthis script there's no more script\nthey're just gonna freestyle and you're\ngonna have to Freestyle I'm like you\nwant me to Freestyle we're two of the\ngreatest to ever do it and I'm not a\ncomedian now were you friends with Will\nat this point not uh not in the way we\nare today okay so so like because I\nthink people might be like yeah but you\nguys are friends\nnot a friend of mine\nyeah and I didn't know Martin at all I'd\nnever met him in my life and so I am\nfully\nfeeling impossible I'm fully in my\ndiscomfort zone I'm and I had the most\nfun\nyeah I was on the corn had fun but then\nsince that day I retreated and so and so\nthat's been if I'm completely honest\nthat's where my heart is I love the idea\nof\ngetting to be I've always loved\nbiographies and I've always loved\nautobiographies I've always loved true\nstories and so if I had the opportunity\nto learn or play or be in a true story\nthat would fill my heart with a lot of\njoy is there somebody that you would I\ndream of a thing no no I don't have that\nthat answer I don't have clear\num but yeah that would be my honest\nanswer to that question of that's\nsomething I'm in the stands on there's\nso many excuses I'm like well Jay if you\ndid that then it discredits all the work\nyou've done up till now well Jay if you\ndid that that and it doesn't work out\nthen then what about the people that you\ncoach in that industry like if if you uh\nif you did it and you did it really well\nthen people will call you a sellout\nbecause you just did you chose to do\nsomething completely different and it's\nnot saying I want to do that and stop\ndoing what I do today it's just that\nthere's a part of that expression that\nI'm so creatively inspired by that I'd\nlike to try yeah and again it's try\nright yeah and I wanted to get so that's\nwhat I want to talk to you about it's\nwhat was the heart of my question before\nI'm so glad you asked me that thank you\nI've never publicly talked about that\nI've never shared that really with\nanyone beyond my wife is what is the\ndifference because I think this is where\nit goes wrong I meet a lot of people who\ntalk to me about their dreams and even\nmine and I want to clarify mine in a\nsecond the one I just shared with you\nwhat is the difference between a dream\nand delusion big and and I I'm going to\nshare what I my initial thoughts before\nI hear yours when I say I would like to\ndo more drama or acting or experiment\nwith that\nphase in my life my dream is not at this\npoint in time to win an Oscar my dream\nis to try to creatively express myself\nand see whether this vehicle is a form\nthat brings me joy happiness and meaning\nin my life yeah that to me is not\ndelusional because it is giving myself\nthe opportunity to put my uh using\nvisuals like put my uh you know what are\nthey called uh stabilizers onto my bike\nand see if this is real right I I often\nfind people whose first Dream is I want\nto build a billion dollar company or and\nthey've never built a business at all or\nhave business experience or I hear I\nwant this to be the number one thing in\nthe world and while those are nice\naspirations I'm not sure that I actually\nthink and this is just my personal take\nI never had those when I started and I\nfeel that sometimes without the skills\nwithout doing the learning without doing\nthe experimenting those things can\nactually stop you from doing it because\nit's so hard it's so far away and\nthere's such a big way to fall so I want\nto understand how do you decipher\nbetween dream and delusion when you talk\nabout delusion\nwhat I hear is like arrogance and\nconceitedness now and and let me explain\nthe difference here because I think\nconfidence\nis this willingness to try\nand this belief in yourself and what\nyou're trying to do right I think\narrogance and\num conceitedness is thinking you're\nbetter than everybody else yeah and so I\nwhen you frame the delusion as this\ngrandiose thing it feels like it's\ncoming from insecurity right it feels\nlike it's coming from wanting to be\nbetter than versus coming from a place\nwhere you're willing to take the risks\nand try and get on the court of life in\na way that's aligned with this thing\ninside you and so\nthat's what I process in my own brain\nwhen you ask me the question what's the\ndifference between dreams and delusions\nyeah now\nif you have a true dream\nis it ever delusional and my answer to\nthat is never\nand here's why\nI believe that dreams are not meant to\nbe achieved\nI believe that your dreams are a\ndirectional signal that the dream is out\nthere\nin a different chapter of your life\ncalling you from this moment toward that\ndirection\nand that the reason why you still have\nthis Burning Flame inside you that\nrelates all the way back to something\nthat you did when you were younger that\nyou freaking loved is because when you\nwalk toward acting and what that\nrequires of you to get on the court and\nwalk toward that dream and look the\ndream could be an Oscar the dream could\nbe something like that's an award it\ndoesn't matter it's in the lane of\nacting\nwhat I believe about dreams is that the\ndreams are deeply personal they are\nconnected to that flame inside you you\nare hardwired with them when you were\nborn it is absolutely part of why you're\ncurious about things why you're\ninterested in things naturally this is\npart of your natural intelligence and\nthat when you get on the court and you\nstart walking toward them\nthat is what's supposed to happen\nbecause if you allow yourself to take on\nsome roles in acting it's going to make\nsomething come alive inside of you\nthat's the purpose of your dreams it's\nto make that flame burn brighter inside\nof you it's about you Awakening\nsomething and your dreams are the\ndirectional signal that are trying to\npoint you in what way to move forward\ngoing back to my daughter will she ever\nhave a stadium tour I don't freaking\nknow\nshe might she might that's not the point\nthe point is to have something come\nalive inside herself by getting on the\ncourt of her life and writing music and\nputting it out there yeah whatever\nhappens happens the reason why I wanted\nto launch the Mel Robbins podcast is not\nso that it could become the number one\npodcast in the world of course I have\nthose goals of course I want to be the\nnumber one female podcast host in the\nworld of course that's what I want but\nthe reason why I am pursuing this is\nbecause I wanted to connect with people\nat a deeper level I knew that I would\ncome creatively alive I knew that I\nwanted to build an ongoing conversation\nthat was deeper and I also knew I wanted\nto learn more because when you're\nconstantly putting out content or you're\nstanding on stages or you're writing\nbooks it's kind of a one-way\nconversation yeah and so part of my\nsolve for loneliness was to stop griping\nabout it to myself and to go well what\nwould actually make me feel more\nconnected what would be of more service\nto people what would create a deeper\nimpact that's why I'm doing this thing\nyeah that's that's what I'm getting at\nthat the clarity and the reason why I\nreally want to get this really clear for\npeople is that I had a friend last night\nI was talking to and they want to start\na podcast and it was the most beautiful\nintention right everyone wants to start\na podcast that everyone wants to start\nanything today sure it's very nice and\nthey should but what I've learned is\nthat anything I've started intentionally\nhas not only more likely brought out the\nconsistency and cre creativity for me\nit's not only been successful it's also\nmade me happy and so what I'm trying to\nget to is how do you plant a seed that\ngoes all the way from not only growing\nconsistently to giving you Joy as it\ngrows to then giving you that flower to\nthen giving you that fruit then giving\nyou the seed to do more rather than like\nI got the flour we then cut it it then\nbroke and you know so when I look at it\nI go\nI think a lot of people are so obsessed\nwith the result\nthat all they get might be the result\nand then you have nothing else and then\nthat result feels dissatisfying it's\nlike when we had Gwyneth Paltrow on the\npodcast she talked about how like\nwinning an Oscar in her teens\nlike removed all aspiration because she\ngoes well what do you do next right like\nwhen you've done that you've done the\nepitome the peak of that career in your\nteens and now it's like well what do you\ndo next and it's like well when it was\nalways when it was if it was only about\nthe result not speaking about her but if\nit was only about the result then you\nstop and so I I just want to clarify\nthat what you just said is you started\nit not to be number one you started it\nbecause of the impact you wanted to make\nthe stories you wanted to totally the\nconnection with your audience and I\nthink if people leaned more into that to\nme that's the real dream yeah and you\nknow it's interesting I keep bringing up\nmy daughter because she's an artist yeah\nand when she leans into the fact that\nshe's not trying to impress her friends\nand and her pop music program\nshe's not trying to impress anybody yeah\nshe wants to tell stories yeah with her\nmusic that inspire people yeah and when\nyou really get into the reason why\nyou're doing something so I'm going to\ngive everybody another visual because\nthere are two visuals that I think about\na lot in life\nfor me one of the most powerful things\nthat I use to coach myself is that when\nI'm in the middle of something\nI always remind myself I'm on the bridge\nso in launching this podcast something\nI've been thinking about for more than\neight years\nsomething I've talked myself out of for\na long time something that I finally\nstepped on the court and started working\nfor about two years ago\nand now we are here\nI know that this is literally step one\non a long suspension bridge that is\nleading me somewhere\nand when you remind yourself that you're\njust on the bridge\nyou stop focusing on how long is it\ngoing to take and what's it going to\nfeel like and I'm not there yet you are\non the bridge\nand you are going to be on the bridge\nuntil you get to this other side and\nthen guess what happens when you get to\nthe other side there's another freaking\nBridge\nevery single episode is like its own\nBridge yeah the other visual that I use\na lot is uh a trail leading up a\nmountain because the research is so\nconclusive and Jay and I can try to beat\nit into your head that meaning comes\nfrom working on something\nI'm gonna say it again meaning comes\nfrom working on something\nwith intention that has importance to\nyou it's that simple you can create\nmeaning in your life by planting a\ngarden\nif it's important to you\nand for me\nI think a lot about you know the act of\ngoing for a hike the purpose of going\nfor a hike ironically is not to get to\nthe top\nit's to be on the trail\nand if you constantly stare at the top\nyou're going to be out of breath you're\ngoing to tell yourself you have so much\nlonger when we're going to get there and\nyou're going to miss the entire point of\nyour freaking life\nwhich is the ride the trail the bridge\nthe mile markers all of it\nand so part of my desire to be happier\nis to continually remind myself it is\nnot about getting on that mountain\nbecause when you get to the top of that\nmountain the top of one mountains just\nthe bottom of another one\nand if you're going up eventually you\ngot to come back down like that is just\nlife if you focus on the freaking Trail\nwhatever step you're on and you keep\nreminding yourself this is going to lead\nme somewhere that is where the meaning\ncomes in your life because Jay and I\nwill both tell you guys that you put all\nthis effort into writing a book it\npublishes you're like okay\nnow what\nyeah it's true yeah and we want it to be\nsomething else we want to think that\nthere is this Silver Bullet that if you\nget to the mountain if you launch the\npodcast if you meet the person of your\ndreams then you'll be happy and the\ntruth is for me personally\nhappiness was really about ending\ncampaigns of misery in my mind it was\nabout identifying where I was arguing\nagainst myself and my potential\nand it was allowing myself to get back\non the trail or start walking across\nthat bridge yeah that's that's I love\nthose visuals they're so powerful and so\nbeautiful and there's\nI mean when you said the bridge one it\nreminded me of I believe this is from\nuh the Christian tradition I believe\nit's from the Bible but this statement\nsays the world is like a bridge don't\nbuild your house on it cross over it and\nI've always spiritually gravitated\ntowards that statement very deeply so\nwhen you said Brits that was the first\nthing that came to my mind the the world\nis like a bridge you know I also like\nthat term a couple reasons so yeah you\nknow I was telling everybody earlier\nabout how I woke up this morning and I'm\nhere visiting my daughter who's 22 and a\nsenior in college and I felt this\nprofound sadness\nand I noticed it and I allowed myself to\nfeel it because I wouldn't feel that if\nI didn't love her so deeply right and\nthen I visualize this bridge\nthat this is just one step on a very\nlong bridge that I'm crossing and a\nbridge that as a parent like the most\nimportant thing that I need to do as a\nparent is to encourage my children\nto fly into this world and to leave and\nto become who they're meant to become\nwhich means they're going to leave and\nthere are a lot of goodbyes and it sucks\nbut it's also beautiful\nand I also love this idea of a bridge\nbecause when it comes to\num anxiety\nwhen it comes to separation\nthere is this concept uh when you say\ngoodbye to somebody or when you're about\nto leave somebody who's going to do\nsomething anxious is you bridge that\nmoment\nto the next moment you're going to see\nthem so I'm sure you do this when you\nsay goodbye to your parents in the UK\nyou hug and say I can't you know for me\nI just said I can't wait to see you on\nThanksgiving break I can't wait to hear\nhow this thing goes tomorrow so that you\nare staying connected and bridging and\nclosing that kind of loop of Something's\nending because things are not\ntruly really ending yeah they're always\nBeginnings to something else yeah one of\nthe questions we get in my DMs a lot and\ncomments and everything is and and I\nthink people subconsciously or\nconsciously have this as well the idea\nthat and you just brought a brought it\nabout is\nyour parents expectations\nso either some people had parents who\nhad very high expectations or different\nexpectations to what the kids wanted\nlike you're very aware that what your\ndaughter wants to be and your happy to\nsupport it as long as she wants to be it\nsome people have the experience of well\nmy parents had very high expectations\nbut they're not the expectations I want\nor my parents actually didn't have any\nexpectations of me and they were\nactually more negative and they actually\ndidn't believe in me at all and didn't\nreally think I'd get anywhere anyway or\nwhen I want to try something I get the\ntoxic feedback of well you're not going\nto make it anyway so I think we we deal\nwith parenting and a feeling of not\nbelieving Us in ourselves in two ways\none is your parents saw the path they\ngave you it but you're like that's not\nmy path this is and then your parents\ndon't believe in it all your parents\nnever believed in any path you were to\ntake and I think a lot of people I'm\nhearing right now are feeling like Jay\nI'm just surrounded by family and\nfriends friends who don't believe in me\ndon't believe in my ideas\ndon't believe in the partner I want to\nbe with like I just don't feel like\npeople\nsupport my decisions yeah Chris and I\nhave been married 26 years we have three\nkids they're 23 22 and 17. there is no\ndoubt in my mind I've screwed them up\nyeah how could you not yeah I mean we're\ntalking about\nmillions of moments where somebody needs\nemotional support\nand you are a mismatch in that moment\nright and I love this term of Parental\nmismatch because it allows those of us\nthat still have a good relationship with\nour parents to acknowledge a fact and\nthe fact is there are things that went\ndown in your childhood that you may not\neven remember\nthat left you with negative or toxic\nthinking patterns that you struggle to\nget rid of as an adult it is a fact\nperiod and so I want to start off by\nsaying that because we all deal with\nthis and it is a result of childhood in\nfact Dr Russell Kennedy who is amazing\nyou should have him on your podcast says\nthat all anxiety results from a feeling\nof separation from your parents when\nyou're a kid probably before you were\nfive a moment where you felt separate\nthere was a mismatch maybe you were\nsitting on the floor you don't even\nremember this you're quietly playing\nyou're in a happy space and mom or dad\ncomes home and they're frustrated and\nall of a sudden they lie you know like\neverybody does at some point because\neverybody has a volcano moment it's a\nfact\nand it startles you as a kid\nyour body remembers that and there's\nthis concept in research called ghosts\nin the nursery that a lot of us struggle\nas adults\nwith behavior that we're like where did\nthat come from\nand where it comes from is the fact that\nif you're now an adult and you had an\nexperience growing up in a household\nwhere your parents raged or your parents\nwere abusive or your parents just\nignored you and you just felt separate\nor on edge when you get into those same\nsituations as an adult\nyour body has a feeling first we think\nwe think first we don't your body has\nthe feeling first and then your body\nrepeats the behavior that you actually\nobserved as a kid\nI speak English because I observed and\nabsorbed the language my parents spoke\nand so there are patterns that you're\nstruggling with that do not serve you as\nan adult that are not your own and so I\nwant to say that first and foremost okay\nthat one of the greatest Gifts of being\nan adult is separating from your parents\nand deciding how you want to talk to\nyourself how you want to change the way\nthat you think how you speak how you\nsupport so that's number one number two\nit is so common and natural\nto feel this kind of complex mix of\nguilt\nand of pressure to want to please your\nparents why because you needed them to\nsurvive as a kid it's not like you could\nleave\nand what we learn as kids is that there\nis a give and a take and that oftentimes\nthat love that you need and that support\nthat you need is very transactional\nthat Mom and Dad are in a great mood and\nyou get a lot of attention when you're\ndoing law and sports or doing well in\nschool or you're doing what they want\nthem to do and what we women learn in\nparticular is that if you're not doing\nwhat I want you to do that's bad because\nguilt by definition is feeling bad about\nwhat you just did we learned that\nfeeling during childhood and it happens\nto everybody and so I want to just say\nthis because I want to normalize it\nthese are things that don't mean that\nyou're damaged it's stuff that we have\nto heal for ourselves as adults and so\nhere's rule number one\nif your parents or your family are not\npaying your bills\nthey have no vote if your parents are\npaying for your bills\nthere is going to be power in what\nthey're saying there is a transaction\nthere because they're paying your\ntuition or they're paying whatever and\nnot all parents are transformed\nand so I'm saying that because one of\nthe fastest ways to Free Yourself is to\npay your own way and when you pay your\nown way you start to feel very empowered\nto pave your own way I happen to believe\nas a parent that my job is to help my\nkids figure out who they are\nand you do that by listening you do that\nby validating their experiences you do\nthat by not seeing them as an extension\nof you that what school they get into\nsomehow means that you're a good parent\nor a bad parent the best thing that you\ncould do for your kids is figure out\nwhat's going to make them happy and\nsupport them in doing that and the other\nthing that you can do is help them make\ndecisions by helping them figure out\nwhat decisions are right for them\nso I'm saying all of this because\nzero to 18 so let's use another metaphor\nbecause I again love metaphors life's\none big road trip okay\nevery year of your life is a mile marker\nfrom 0 to 18 you're not even driving the\ndamn car\nsomebody else's you're in somebody\nelse's car they're telling you what to\ndo they're controlling what's happening\nthe second you get to University or you\nleave home you get to navigate your own\nlife\nbut not if somebody else is paying for\nit yeah I think that\nperspective is empowering if you're\nwilling to take that risk but what we've\nfound\nyou know the the research shows this as\nwell there was a study a few years ago\nthat I looked up which talked about how\nyou know with men and women when when\nmen see a job description and they can\ndo like 50 to 60 right that's an HP\nstudy don't say I can do it right and\nthen when a woman sees a job description\nand even if she can do 80 of it she'll\nbe like I can't apply because I can't do\n20 and so I find that there's a we do it\nin dating too by the way right so yeah\nso so that that disproportionate\nself-doubt that comes in there or that\nlack of self-confidence as as someone\nwho's a mum of girls like does that\ndo you see that playing out differently\nfor you and for them and so I there's a\ntremendous amount of research on this\nwith girls and confidence and I have a\ntheory as to what happens\nand I know what age it happens at\ntypically for girls because girls\nstruggle with crippling perfectionism in\nnumbers that far outweigh uh what\nhappens to boys and I believe there is a\nspecific reason why\nso at the age of 12 boys and girls have\nthe exact same levels of confidence Jay\nat the age of 13 girls confidence fall\noff a cliff according to the research\nand I think I know why\nthe reason why in my personal opinion is\nbecause that is the average age that a\ngirl goes through puberty and she starts\nmenstruating now here's the interesting\nthing about girls when they go through\npuberty\nit's like a public conversation\nand what's the first thing that somebody\nsays to a little girl when they get\ntheir period you're a woman now\nand it's also something that happens to\nyour body so there's this like implied\nmaturing this implied notion of sex\nthere's also the fact that your boobs\nare growing and you're butting and\npeople are self-conscious and so now\nyou're wearing a sweatshirt you also\nknow who's got their period somehow\neverybody knows when this is happening\neverybody's talking about it and so you\nin that moment\nlose the control of the conversation\nabout your body\nand for most girls it's incredibly\nuncomfortable like I remember one of my\ndaughters wore like a gigantic\nsweatshirt for two years just to hide\nher developing body other girls might\nshow it off because you get more\nattention but it becomes this public\nconversation about where you are in\nrelation to everybody else and most\ngirls in addition to the socialization\nthat you get from the media and from\nculture you start then wishing you\nlooked different you start to obsess\nabout yourself if I could just get a\nperfect if I wear the perfect sweatshirt\nthen nobody's going to notice and you\nstart micromanaging as a defense\nmechanism to public judgment\nthat's what I think happens because the\nperfectionism is off the church too when\nyou dudes get hit puberty it's typically\nwhen you're 15. and it benefits you I\nmean because if we're not talking about\nwhat's happening with your balls right\nit's not like some conversation about\nthat we're talking about the fact that\nyour voice is deeper you've gotten\ntaller it benefits you in high school\nsports and so it doesn't impact your\nguys's confidence it actually helps you\nand that's where it begins in my\npersonal opinion along with the fact\nthat there's so much that happens\ngenerally generationally where boys are\nencouraged to take risks boys are in\nsports where they're knocked around boys\nare picked up and shoved back in the\ngame girls are coddled a little bit more\nand told to be a good girl be a nice\nsister go hug your uncle all those\nthings that send a message that leads to\nwomen struggling with confidence what do\nyou think then are some of the things\nthat you did later on and you want for\nyour daughters to do to develop better\nconfidence like what are some of those\nsteps towards better confidence because\nI think\nit's it's so difficult right to\nconfidence requires you to do so many\nthings you don't want to do to develop\nit yeah like I think the problem with\nthe word confidence when I look it up in\nthe dictionary it's one of my favorite\ndefinitions of a word one of the\ndefinitions is acknowledgment and\nself-assurance in one's own abilities\nright like you're acknowledging and you\nare aware of and you're reassured of\nyour own abilities and your qualities\nand so when I look at that definition I\ngo okay that requires you to do things\nthat like you you don't build your\nself-respect when you sat out on the\nbeach\nbut you do build your self-respect when\nyou went and hiked up a hill and then\nwalked back down right like your\nself-confidence doesn't grow because you\nsat out in your garden and didn't do\nanything your self-confidence grew\nbecause you learned how to garden or do\nsomething right your self-respect\nself-esteem and self-confidence grow\nwhen you do things yeah that are not\nobvious or easy or simple right but like\nyou're saying we're not trained in that\nway so what are some of the steps that\npeople could take towards self-conscious\nyeah first here's what I want to tell\nyou and then I'll give you some steps so\nconfidence is one of those topics Jay\nthat we have backwards\neverybody hears the word confidence and\nthey think it's belief like up here yeah\nI agree confidence my definition of\nconfidence that I want everyone to walk\naway with is confidence is the\nwillingness to try\nin research there is something called\nThe Confidence competency Loop\nand what that means is that as you try\nsomething for the first time like I was\ncurling my hair this morning and I\nfreaking burned my ear\nand my daughter casually says gotta\nlearn somehow\nby trying and by the way screwing it up\nand burning my ear I still am gaining a\nlittle bit of confidence I know to hold\nthis thing a little bit further away\nfrom my ear Now by gaining confidence by\nburning my ear\nI now am going to try again and I'm\ngonna be a little bit better\nand I'm going to gain a little bit more\nconfidence and then I'm going to try\nagain and I'm going to learn even more\nand so confidence at the heart of\nconfidence is action\nit's the willingness to try and all you\nneed is to know that if you try you're\nnot going to die you're just going to\nlearn something and when you learn\nsomething it removes a little bit of the\ninsecurity so that it makes it slightly\neasier to try again and so I would\nfollow the 60 rule okay and I use sixty\npercent because that is the figure that\nwas in the HP study about men applying\nfor jobs when they feel sixty percent\nqualified if you look at something that\nyou want to do or try or apply for and\nyou feel whether it's sixty percent\nqualified okay I got sixty percent of\nthe stuff because the truth is a job\ndescription everybody a dating profile\nthat is not requirements that's a wish\nlist okay if you got sixty percent of\nthis stuff freaking go for it that's\nrule number one the sixty percent rule\nthe other thing is is that if you're\nlooking at doing something that you're\nscared to do maybe it's signing up for\nan improv class maybe it is ordering the\npodcast equipment maybe it's signing up\nfor genius like even thinking about even\nthinking about it you're thinking about\nit\nif you want to scale\nyou're on this teeter-totter if you tip\nmore toward I'd really like to so about\n60 right weight versus 40 I'm kind of\nnervous freaking do it\nthat's how you build confidence\nbecause back to the original thing that\nwe're talking about\nself-doubt grows when you engage\nin negative talk to talk yourself out of\nthe things you want to be trying there\nis so much pain Jay\nin talking yourself out of trying things\nand it just makes me so sad and\nfrustrated to see so many of you that\nare listening wasting years of your life\nreally feeling this desire to try\nsomething and putting all your energy\nall your energy into talking yourself\nout of it here's something that I just\nrecorded an episode about this and it's\nthe fall so I'm thinking a lot about the\nfact that you know in the fall season at\nleast in New England and I realize in\nother areas of the world it's not the\nfall right now\nthe leaves fall off the tree right\nhere's an interesting fact\nthis is not a beautiful graceful thing\nthat happens\nthe tree pushes those frickers off its\nbranches as an act of survival\nbecause leaves have a huge surface area\nand they require a lot of water to be\nable to capture the Sun and convert it\ninto energy for the tree and over winter\nthere ain't no water\nand if those trees are there that the\nleaves are there the tree's gonna die\nand it's an energy conserver it is an\nenergy issue you are putting so much\nnegative energy\ninto things that you won't let go of\ninto complaining into relationships that\ndon't work into your excuses do you know\nhow much energy it takes to walk into a\njob you can't stand\nand yet you do it every day\nimagine if instead of sitting at your\ndesk resisting complaining gossiping and\ncoming up with excuses imagine if you\njust redirected some of that energy\ntoward looking for something else\nthat like the leaves get pushed off a\ntree you make a decision that today I am\nactually going to let go of the\ngossiping and complaining about this\nbecause that is zapping my energy and\nI'm going to direct my energy\nat something positive because once I get\nrid of that\nI got room for something positive to\ngrow\nand complaining to yourself and robbing\nyourself of just trying something yeah\nand we don't think about it that way it\ntakes the same amount of energy I think\nmore yeah more potentially it definitely\nyeah it's more draining but it is if\nanyone wants to think about it yeah it's\nit's that same energy just put in a\ndifferent direction could could change\nthe course it does change the course\nyeah and it just needs to try I love\nthat willingness to try so the 60 rule\nthere's one takeaway in confidence okay\nthe second thing that you can do with\nconfidence because it's action based\nthis is where the five second rule is a\ngame changer just use my five second\nrule literally in those moments where\nyou feel self-doubt kick in you gotta be\ncareful because you have a habit of\nhesitating you have a habit of doing\nwhat psychologists say you have a bias\ntowards thinking and so a second\ntakeaway is use my five second rule and\nwhen you catch yourself hesitating when\nyou catch the self-doubt coming in when\nyou catch the feelings and the excuses\nrise up count backwards five four three\ntwo one\nand by the time you get to one the\nprefrontal cortex will have focused on\nthe counting and you've got literally a\nsplit second to move and the trick about\nthis is when you start counting\nyou've made a decision to try\nand the counting itself is like a trojan\nhorse because it's the first action yeah\nI love that rule and the book's there\ntoo in case anyone needs all the added\ninformation I think our last interview\nis all about that so I want to ask you\nabout one final area of thought because\nwe were talking about it before\nand I think a lot of our community does\nI have to ask you because I just wrote a\nbook called Eight rules of love which is\nout next year and\nI I talk about this in one of the\nchapters so I'd love to hear your\nperspective on it but the idea where\nyou've been married for 26 years right\ncongratulations that's incredible and\nthat's beautiful\nin that time you and your partner are\ngoing to go through different stages of\npersonal growth personal Evolution\ncollect collective growth Collective\nEvolution sometimes you're going to feel\nahead they're going to feel behind\nsometimes they're going to feel ahead\nyou're going to feel behind sometimes\nit's not even about ahead of behind the\nquestion I have is if someone's\nlistening and their partner or even if\nthey're not in a relationship their\nfriend\nI was just mean to someone the other day\nand they were saying yeah my friend is a\nbit envious that I just landed my dream\njob where I'm just meeting the guy that\nI you know we always feel ahead of\nbehind of the people that were closest\nto even if we loved them and we want\nthem to win there's that feeling if\nsomeone's in a relationship someone's\ngot a friend that's feeling behind or\nmaybe they're the person who's feeling\nbehind someone else\nwhat do we do in that scenario how do we\nsupport ourselves support others how can\nwe think through that because I think\nfeeling ahead or behind is never fun\neven feeling ahead is not fun yeah\num when you feel behind that's your\ninsecurity\nputting a lid on what you believe is\npossible for you so that's number one\nrecognize that it is that's in security\nblocking you and you can use that as a\nsign that oh I all I have to do is start\nwalking toward things the second thing I\nwant to share with everybody is that it\nis normal\nto feel envious\nor even be somewhat of a jerk\nwhen somebody that you care about\nchanges and I want to tell a story\nto explain why and the story I'm the\nvillain okay\nwell I've played in my marriage poor\nChris\nis wonderful yes Chris is amazing so\nChris uh a couple years ago decided he\nwas going to completely stop drinking\nand he went on this deep spiritual\njourney and he was going to stop\ndrinking for a couple years and he\nbecame a Buddhist Meditation instructor\nand a yoga instructor and started his\nmen's Retreat business\nand I'll never forget\nthe first night\nthat he was not drinking I open up a\nbottle of Rose I'm pouring a glass of\nrose\neverything's great because I'm cooking\ngreat the second night\nas I'm opening up a bottle of Rose and\nChris is like cracking open like I don't\nknow like a Saint Croix I'm starting to\nfeel agitation\nI'm starting to feel the campaign the\ncomplaining the this and the that and I\nnotice it and I'm like don't say\nanything\nthe third day is when Mel the villain\nshowed up\nand I'm not proud to admit this but I\nwant everybody to hear this so you\nunderstand what's actually happening\ninside of your relationship\nI crack open the rose\nI'm pouring my glass of wine\nand I turned to Chris and I'm like\ncome on\nyou want to have glass rose with me and\nhe says no I'm good and I said it's like\njuice\nsmell\nI do not want a glass of wine\nstop asking me\nand I said okay I'm sorry it's just that\nit makes me feel bad and this is when he\nsaid something that just\nhe said\nnobody cares\nwhat's in your glass but you\nand if what I'm putting in my glass\nmakes you question what you're putting\nin yours\nthen maybe you have some work to do and\nit is easier everybody\nto question somebody else's change and\neven sabotage it because their change in\ngrowth\ncreates a change in energy and ripples\nand changes in patterns that make you\nwake up and start realizing that maybe\nsome of the things you do\ndon't work for you\nso when that friend of yours stays in to\nwrite a business plan how many of us on\na Saturday night we're like oh come on\nyou work on it tomorrow\ndo you have to go to the gym today stay\nin bed with me\nthat's that same behavior\nof dragging somebody to join in with you\nand pour what's in your cup\nand so I want you to understand this is\nnormal and it's a really good sign\nbecause it means that your behavior is\nnot only changing you but is sending\nwaves at somebody else that has just\ngiven them a wake-up call and most of us\npush against those wake-up calls and\nthat's what they're doing because you're\nvery safe to do it with\nand so that's something that's really\nimportant to understand\nand I find that the best way to support\nsomebody because we all know we can't\nchange somebody else is you keep\na laser focus on what you're doing\nbecause the bigger the change becomes\nand the happier you become\nthe more difficult it's going to be for\nyour friend or your family to ignore it\nand the more it's going to\nstir up more things and eventually\ninspiration and the best thing that you\ncan do is ask leading questions do not\ntell somebody what to do that is the\nworst thing you can do in a relationship\nor friendship or as a parent\ninstead like literally hey you don't\nseem happy is there anything that I can\ndo to help you don't seem like yourself\nis something going on do you need\nsupport in something\nand you know my my favorite sentence on\nthe planet as a parent and as a wife is\ndo you need me to listen\nor would you like to know what I'm\nthinking um\nand nine times out of ten my kids my\nhusband the folks that work for me they\njust want me to listen\nand so I think when you create an\nopening\nfor somebody to stop engaging in their\nown self-doubt and their own very active\nand painful kind of\nreasons why they can't join you at the\ngym or reasons why they're not going to\nmeditate or reasons why they're not\ngoing to join you in dry January or\nwhatever it may be\nor the reasons why they can't can't we\nall have a friend can't look for a job\nnever gonna find anybody that's not true\nand you know it so create the space you\nbe the light on the path ahead and when\nyou hold your light higher\neventually that jealousy and those\nexcuses\nit actually allows it to disappear and\nyou part you become part of the force\nthat pulls them forward and the other\nthing you have to understand is that\nthere are going to be legs of your\njourney in life and this is one of the\nhardest things where people are going to\npull off and take a different route\nthat's okay\nthey may come back at another time\nthat's okay and you know the final thing\nthat\nI wanted to say about this is it's a\nvery simple exercise that you can do\nwith somebody\nand this helps somebody\nwho is either struggling with happiness\nand doesn't know how to get started or\nis struggling with confidence\nand\nis not able to take action or who is\nresisting the changes that you are doing\nand you would love to see them do\nwe did this with our daughter who is now\n23 and last summer when she graduated\nfrom college really unhappy I mean two\nyears of college had been imploded and\nshe was extremely depressed and\nbasically just drank her way through it\nand graduated and was not happy\nbig life change nothing was going\naccording to plan she had planned this\nhuge trip to go to Cambodia and do a big\nservice trip for four months that wasn't\ngoing to happen just lost\nand so Chris and I sat with her for a\ncouple hours and then I said and she's\nlike I don't know what to do I'm 22. I'm\nstuck I'm miserable I don't even know\nhow to start I said I actually think you\ndo\nI think you're just scared take out a\nblank piece of paper draw a line down\nthe center\non the left hand side I want you to\nwrite happy me\nnow close your eyes\nand think about a time\nthat you remember being happy\nor more confident\nor Alive it could be any word you want\nright\nand you might have to go back to\nchildhood\nour daughter closed her eyes and she\nsaid it was senior year in high school\nand I said okay so write down\nall of the things\nthat you were doing in a week of your\nlife senior year in high school just\ndescribe your life for me oh I got up\nand do it in detail everybody\nI got up at seven a.m or 6 30 I was\nleaving the house by seven I was with my\nfriends all day I was looking forward to\ngoing to college I was playing varsity\nlacrosse I was exercising six days a\nweek I was only partying with friends\ntwice a week I you know was in a healthy\ndating relationship I ate four dinners a\nnight at home like just\ngreat write down what your life looks\nlike now I sleep till one I drink every\nday I feel like I don't see my friends\nbecause everybody's scattered now that\nwe graduate I don't have anything to\nlook forward to my my trip to Cambodia\nis canceled I'm not exercising\nokay\ncompare the two\nyour own life experience\noffers the map\nand we want to over complicate these big\nwords like happiness I know I did for\ndecades or confidence\nit's actually\nfound in the little things\nif you do this simple exercise of\ndrawing a line down a piece of paper\nand you write down what life looked like\nin great detail when did you wake up\nwhen did you go to bed how are from your\nfriends family what were you doing for\nwork exercise what were you eating\nif you then compare that to what life\nlooks like now\nyou now know what to do\nand the fact is your whole life\nis Little Things\nit's when you wake up it's the first\nthing you look at it's what you\ndo with your body it's how you greet\nyour spouse it's how you talk to\nyourself it's what you say to yourself\nwhen you look in the mirror it's the\nmood that you walk in to work with\nintentionally\nit's how you greet your animals or your\nroommate when you end the day it's the\ntone of voice that you use\nthat's your whole life\nand if you were to just take the time\nand intentionally write down a few\nsimple things that you do when you're\nhappy in life and you were to focus for\nthe next seven days on just adding one\nof those in a day you would be very\nsurprised how getting some of the little\nthings right actually starts to turn\nyour life in a completely different\ndirection so powerful no it's been an\nabsolute pleasure having you back on the\nshow The miles Robin's podcast is out\nright now you can go and listen\nsubscribe share please please please go\nand do that Mel I love sitting down with\nyou I love today was that perfect\nbalance as I was talking about before of\nplaying tennis going back and forth and\nat the same time just getting some\nreally practical insightful advice from\nyou on step-by-step strategic systematic\nbreakdown of how to do things I want to\nthank you from the bottom of my heart\nfor being a dear friend to me and Robbie\nI hope me you Chris all of us get to\nspend lots more time together uh\ngenuinely or even if it's Lots not lots\nmore time but it's deep time together\nthat would make me very happy and I wish\nyou all the best on defeating the\ncampaigns of misery for yourself and\neveryone else in the world through your\nshow through your books on Audible\nthrough through your book in the five\nsecond rule and also for helping me\nstart working on my campaigns of misery\nas well so thank you so much Malay\ndeeply appreciate you very grateful to\nyou I love you Jay and I can't wait to\nsee you you acting yeah no no I have to\nnow I have accountability so I want to\noffer another mistake I've made and I've\nmade this with both Chris and with our\ndaughter Kendall so Chris as he is\nrunning Seoul degree which is men's\nRetreat and our daughter Kendall as\nshe's writing music\none of the best things that you can do\nto help create momentum is to call out\nthe Teeny steps are taking\nI made a mistake with our daughter for a\nlong time where I kept talking about the\nbig stuff\nor I kept saying but you're not writing\nsongs or this would make a great song or\nyou know play me something new and she\nwould go stop talking about this\nstop telling me what to do\nbecause\nwhen somebody loves you they respect\nyour opinion and trust me they know when\nthey're not doing what they need to do\nevery day\nso you will support somebody more when\nyou say you know I'm really proud of you\nfor the fact that you're very relaxed\nabout this\nI'm really proud of you for the fact\nthat you're not beating yourself up uh\nthat it's not happen sooner I'm really\nproud of you for marching to your own\ndrone I'm really proud of you for\nwriting a song today and playing it\nthat's freaking awesome\nacknowledging the little stuff\nis incredibly powerful yeah because the\nperson has\nto push through so much of their own\nstuff\nthat if you go oh and you should do it\nthis way or oh have you tried that or oh\nit'd be great if you do this you're not\nactually building momentum\nyou're pointing out what wasn't done and\nthat was something I was guilty of for a\nlong time catching myself and trying to\nlook for oh what are they doing and\ngiving them that pat on the back that\nhug that high five that verbal\nacknowledgment of the effort done or\neven the fact that the fact that they\nhaven't done anything but they're\nthinking about it that is worth it too\nand the reason we do that you know this\nis because we don't give ourselves a pat\non the back for doing something small so\nwe don't even acknowledge when we do\nsomething small we're waiting and we're\nsaying to ourselves over all you did\ntoday was go to the gym all you did this\nweek was go to the gym twice that's not\nenough yep and because we talked to\nourselves like that when someone in our\nlife does it triggers us about going\nyeah they only went to the gym twice a\nweek too like that's terrible yeah and\nso I I couldn't agree with you more and\nI've\nyeah I I think I've had to be my own\ncheerleader for so much of my life and\nnotice the little things that I've done\nand the little progress that with radi\nI've definitely seen then she\nappreciates it where I'll just you know\nnotice those smaller things but I\nrealized that anytime I get triggered by\nsomeone's lack of growth it's because\nI'm triggered by my own lack of growth\nand I'm just reflecting that back onto\nthem I'm upset with myself for not going\nto the gym more times this week and\nbecause they haven't I'm now releasing\nthat on them and that's been such a\ngreat way of going okay well I need to\nbe kinder to myself too for the little\nwins yes it took you two years to launch\nthis podcast but there were things in\nthose two years that you learned about\ngetting to where you are now that you\nmade so many steps of progress and\nthat's why you know and also there are\nso many little steps about completing\nthings so that you can create room yes\nand so one of the other things I want to\noffer too is yes that tendency for us to\njump in and be like oh did you try this\nor do this or do oh and like kind of\ncreate the snowball\nit does come from the fact that a lot of\nus are not encouraging ourselves but it\nalso comes from a really altruistic\nloving space yes because you love this\nperson so much you want it so much for\nthem\nthat as soon as you see a tiny step\nforward you're like ah let's do this and\nyou want to jump in with them and so it\ncan come from both a place of your own\nlack of support for yourself as a\ndefault yes unintentionally but it also\ncomes from a really good place because\nyou're just so excited and you then\namplify things and then they feel\ncrushed yeah because what they did do\ndoesn't now feel like enough absolutely\nI love that clarification I agree this\nboth everyone who's been listening and\nwatching today make sure you tag Melanie\non Instagram on tick tock on Twitter\nwhatever social media platform you use\nwith all your greatest insights nuggets\nof wisdom from this episode there was so\nmany scattered across the entire time\nwe've been talking make sure you grab\nthe screenshot of the episode share it\nwith a friend maybe there's someone in\nyour life that would benefit from\nlistening to this with you and then\nhaving a conversation about it\nafterwards I think that's something I'm\nreally encouraging I find that when\nwe're collectively having an experience\nit's even better than saying Hey I just\nheard this amazing thing listen to it\nfriends listen to it family and then\ndiscuss it amongst yourselves I hope\nwe've given you enough tools and insight\nand thoughts to start a conversation to\nask a powerful question and I hope that\nyou're leaving here today feeling\nhappier healthier and more healed thank\nyou so much on purpose Community I love\nyou deeply and thank you to Mel for\njoining us again today and I'll see you\non the next one thanks everyone if you\nwant even more videos
