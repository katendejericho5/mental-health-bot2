    "transcript": "when do most of us go to a diary when\nwe're having problems I think I need to\nstart writing stuff down to make sure I\ntake the time to write stuff down when\nthings are going well so I can dissect\nmy successes when you won the Oscar in\nthe in 2014 and you gave that speech I\nhad a ritual at that time in my life\nwhere I listened to your speech every\nday for 30 days and maybe even a bit\nlonger and it was so powerful and\nprofound and when I read your book it\nwas exactly what I was looking for\nbecause I wanted that speech to never\nend I wanted it to kind of like go in so\nmany different directions so anyone who\nhasn't heard that speech go listen to it\nif you have heard it you know what I'm\ntalking about and the book literally\nfeels like a never-ending version of\nthat speech which is beautiful Bravo\ngreat I love hearing that translation\nit's it's very true so I wanted to start\nthere uh and and before we dive into the\nbook in chronological order I was going\nto pick this out uh because on page 17\nE3 you say I started to believe my\nlife's calling was to become a monk now\nnow I don't know if you know this but I\nlived as a monk for three years in India\nand so when you s when I read that I was\njust like I have to find out about this\nand so I wanted to hear why was that\nyou're calling or why did you feel that\nwas your life's calling at one point and\nand have you ever thought about it again\nyes uh well that came to me at a time\nwhen I was having a very introspective\nforced winter of a year in Australia as\nI was exchange student\num and it was a very unsettling year for\nme\num I was alone in a foreign Place uh I\nwas you know struggling with my own\nidentity I didn't have all the crutches\nor things I could rely on around me\nfriends car cash a job Mom Dad I didn't\nhave any of those things so I was forced\nto rely on myself\num\nand forced inward it was it was a real\nyear of resistance now in that\num and I was going to tad bit and saying\nI think it's fair to say I started to\ncreate daily disciplines for myself\num and as you as you know when we're\nsort of lost creating daily discipline\nto give you a a tangible measurement of\nokay I I ran six miles today\num you know for me I was a runner I went\nvegetarian I didn't know how to do it\nand was looking for my calling and at\nthe time I was like oh I'm going to go\nover to South South Africa and help\nfreeze Nelson Mandela I'm going to\nbecome a monk I think that's my calling\nand I talked to a very good friend of\nmine a story brother Christian who's a\nmonk about that and he was like well do\nyou have really great communication\nskills Matthew I think that I I admire\nwhat you you're calling to go do that\nbut maybe your way is to be in in what\nyou're doing in life to communicate more\nand not become a Hermit or a monk and as\nyour last question it is something that\nI still consider and remind myself that\nI still have time to try and do it\nthat's that's my goal I love that I love\nthat man that's that's beautiful and I'm\nglad you stayed on the path you did as\nyou've gone on to definitely use those\ncommunication skills extremely\neffectively and and with the book so the\nbook's called green lights uh like I\nsaid it was a joy of reading it and this\nanalogy that you create of green lights\nuh 12 talk to us about what is a green\nlight but more deeply for me what I'm\nfascinated by is how do you know when\nsomething's a green light and sometimes\ndo we miss them like do we miss green\nlights as well absolutely we miss them\nall the time\num\nsometimes they're right in front of us\nwe don't see them daily because we're\nnot in a place to receive them to\nrecognize them to be aware of them to\nsee a certain situation we that\nsometimes we see red and yellow lights\nwhere they're actually\ngreen light sometimes we slow down and\nstop or feel like we're getting stopped\nwhen it's actually no it was it was free\nthere was no glass on the on the on the\nfloor you could pass through that dark\nhallway it was it was it was a free ride\nwhatever that may be a lot of times I\nthink I know that we can create Green\nLife engineer them for our future by the\nchoices we make daily\num I call it since it's a version of\ndelayed gratification uh it's a version\nof rli return on our investments it's\nlike teeing ourself up being kind to our\nfuture self teeing up more green lights\nin our future\num they're based on a mix of\nresponsibility and Freedom the choices\nwe make compounding assets of our future\num if we for instance because sad to say\nI'm gonna lie cheat still get it get a\nshort money green light right now for me\nwell you're actually teeing up yellow\nand red lights in the future because\neverywhere you go you got to look over\nyour shoulder and go oh is someone here\nthat a lot cheap stole from and the cop\ntraffic or whatever that may be as a\nmetaphor if we take care of our business\ntoday it can be simple simple thing\nhere's a simple green light thing put\nyour coffee in the coffee field to the\nnight before you go to bed you're so\nhappy the next morning just to press\nthat button because sometimes it's hard\nto make a coffee when you hadn't had\nyour coffee so there's there can be\nsimple little green lights where you tee\nyourself up for for\num be more success and ease in the\nfuture and then like I said sometimes\nyou can engineer them sometimes they\nwill just fall in our lap\num and how do we how do how do we find\nthem I've found that we find them by\neither enduring through something\nor pivoting and having on having another\nlook at something a different way or\nraising the white flag and saying I give\nI'm going to live to fight another day\nbecause I'm going to fight another\nbattle here the tool for getting that to\nthem that I bring up in the book is when\nfaced with the inevitable get relative\nso when do we deem something inevitable\na situation like now we're in coveted\nit's inevitable\nso you and I can sit here and go oh my\nGod when's this going to end I wish this\nwas over I wish we were back in the good\nold days nothing constructive than\nanything I just said nothing leading\ntowards the green line but can we say\nand recognize like you did offline\nbefore we got on this hey I've really\nit's really been a still quiet time for\nme right now I've been taking inventory\nthat's recognizing a green light in the\nred light we're in right now\nand setting yourself up for more for\nthat to remain a green light to make\nthis useful time in whatever way you can\nyou're already cultivating and building\na green light for your future in this\nred light time\nso in that version the another truth\nthat I believe is that every red neon\nlight does reveal itself to be green\nsomewhere in the rear view mirror of\nlife sometimes we notice it today\nsometimes next week next month next year\nsometimes on our deathbed sometimes\nmaybe our great great great great\ngrandkids will actually be the first\nrecipients of the green light of some\nred light we had in our own life that's\nbeautiful I love that I love the fact\nthat it may outlive us like we may not\neven get to see it like I think that's\nthat's some real power in that because I\nthink we have such an obsession with\nseeing feeling holding experiencing\ngrabbing having and and what you're\nactually saying is that if you're\nplanting that seed right now for that\ngreen light you may never actually\nexperience it as the green light but\nsomeone in that Legacy or lineage will\nget to experience it my father died in\n1992. major red light in my life\nred light for all quite a while\nI read in going through writing the book\nI looked at the Diaries I was like\noh with him passing away\nthe values that he had you kind of had\nlearned from him that you were doing you\nknow a decent job of living by but not\nreally why wasn't I really\ndoing a good job because I had him to\nrely on he was alive he was my safety\nnet he was above government and law to\nme so dad's there I'll be I'll be okay I\ndon't have to really commit I don't\nreally have to man up to this situation\nI don't really have to cut the courage\nto do this because my dad's here he's\ngot my back oh lost him oh he's not here\nuh oh\num and all of a sudden everything that I\nrevered all the Mortal things in life\nthat I revered came down to eye level\nall the things that I was condescending\nand patronizing looking down upon rose\nup to eye level the world was flat I\ncould see further wider and clearer I\ngained courage confidence uh kindness uh\num became more of my true self and was\nmore truthful I don't believe I would\nhave done that\nI know I wouldn't have if my dad was\nstill alive at that point maybe I would\nhave done it another time in life but\nhis passing that red light passing\nrevealed early green lights for me and\nnow in hindsight I'm like I don't know\nif I'd be here\nI don't know if it had the family I have\nI don't know if I'd be who I was if my\ndad would not have passed so it's not\nabout denying the red light it's not\nabout covering up and saying oh it\ndidn't happen no it happened and it's a\nred light but even the one we're in now\nthere's a great chance we have the\nopportunity to look back at 2020 the\nmost awkward and tragic year that we can\nremember has a banner year of rebirth\nand change in a year that really moved\nour floor\nit's not a guarantee that we we use it\nbut we have an opportunity to and\nsecedes of those green lights we're\nliving in them right now we may not know\nwhat they are yeah no that's a really\nit's it's the most empowering\nperspective that we can live with and\nand it's not even just and you know and\nI know you consider yourself an optimist\nI wouldn't even say that that\nperspective is just being optimistic\nit's actually being the most\nintrospecting and like you saying going\ninward to try and change that experience\nbut tell us about you talked about your\nfather and your relationship there tell\nus about how that was like in your\nchildhood when obviously you wanted to\nmake him proud you wanted to you know\nmake him feel something and he had these\nexpectations how did you align with\nthose expectations or or was it\ndifferent I don't think it aligned with\nthose expectations for a while\num so I've got two older brothers yeah\num my older brother rooster who's 16\nyears older than me my dad was a you\nknow he's trying to raise his young boys\ninto men and he\ndid a good job of that he had\nexpectations of that he also believed to\nwrite a passage and initiations\num\nand\nsometimes those were physical\num and and physical encounters with him\nor at least he always told us hey you\nwant to Buck you don't like how things\nare being run under this household you\nknow where to find the boss I'm right\nhere ready whenever you are my older\nbrother took him up on that\nat about young 20s and from that day on\nthey were best friends and my Dad loved\nhe was looking for his boys to just it\nwas more that we would accept the\nchallenge have the courage to accept the\nchallenge that was it that would have\nmade him I failed to do that a couple of\ntimes early in my life I chickened out\nand\nyou know in Heinz decided I kind of\nregret that that I did because\nhe would have probably hugged me as soon\nas I said all right pop I'm taking you\non he'd about me like that's my boy and\ngave me a great hug and then it would\nhave been over and we'd have moved on\nso I was raised more by My Mother My dad\nbecame more successful at work so I had\nto be on the road more\num he and I kind of got to know each\nother for the first time\num well it was one summer\nin the middle of my Mom and Dad's second\ndivorce where he and I lived in a\ntrailer park together and I kind of got\nto know him pretty good them and I was\nvery young man\nthe first time I really got to know him\nis somewhat of an adult was around\n18 or 19.\num and we we had to spend some time\ntogether and I was of age to go have a\nbeer with him at the bar or hang around\nhis friends and be a part of the stories\nI was hearing instead of just\nhearing about the stories the next day\num and one night we were walking out of\nthis this bar and I remember he was\nrocking right behind me and that as I\npassed out the door frame\nand head into the parking lot uh this\nbouncer stepped behind me and put his\nhand on my dad's chest and said you pay\nyour tab sir my dad was a big man and I\nsaw my dad kind of look down at his hand\nand kind of Slough it off and go yeah\nbud because we had paid the tab we did\npay the tab but as he moved that hand I\nI and and and the image\nI had looking over my shoulder of\nanother man putting his hand on my dad's\nchest as my dad was about to go tell\nthat to tell this guy hey Bud don't put\nyour hands on me before that could even\nhappen I pounced this guy I pounced this\nbouncer next thing I knew\nI was being pulled off of him and he was\ndown on the floor 20 feet back in the\nbar over a table on his back what and it\nall just happened and I remember that\nnight I got pulled off and I'm kicking\nand screaming and groveling and I hear\nthis voice in my ear that's enough son\nthat's enough\nand it was my dad\nwell\nthat was a bit of a rite of passage for\nme in his eyes I remember him calling\nall of his friends oh hey the youngest\none he's gonna be okay I was well\nworried about him he's gonna be okay you\ngot to watch him he's got a bit of a\nBerserker switch and I remember that\nbeing like that act of of taking that\nchance and that risk physically\num was a rite of passage for him and and\nthat's when he and I really became more\nbuddies and he was less my father to son\nbut then the you know sad thing is he\nmoved on quite soon after that\num um\nafter I went to college but yeah he's in\na few other great stories where he gave\nme some real privilege and freedom and\napproval of what I was trying to be in\nlife\nyeah that's beautiful man thank you for\nsharing that with us yeah it's uh it's\nit's interesting because you speak about\nin the book so many almost challenging\nsituations that you went through early\non whether it was you know being\nblackmailed for sex uh you know uh\nmolested like you know but but one of\nthe things you said after that was like\nyou were like I've never felt like a\nvictim in my life and and I was\nintrigued by that juxtaposition because\none could look at a lot of those\nsituations and feel that it was valid\nwhere were you able to not see yourself\nas a victim or what was that and how\nhave you done that in a healthy way yeah\nI mean\nwe could argue you know and it's worth\nits worth the world right now it's in\nthe conversation defining victimhood\nyeah\ncould you say in those situations I was\na victim\nsure\nI said I chose I never felt I was a\nvictim I never chose to say oh I've been\nvictimized\nthat may mean in your book or someone\nelse's book legitimately I was a victim\nso I'm not trying to illegitimate the\nthe word victim no I didn't think it was\nnot to feel like I was a victim and I\ndid not I understood\nwhen I got molested that time that that\nwas a bad thing that that was not how\nlife worked I was old enough to not be\nsuper confused about it I was old enough\nto be pissed off because I had just come\nconscious and this person was in this\nsituation I was old enough to go whoa\nwhoa whoa I was also old enough to know\nthat's not how the most of the world\nworks you know so it wasn't a confusing\nthing for me so I was able to go oh glad\nI came too you know uh when I did and\ngot the hell out of there you know\nanother what was the other one the uh\nthe black metal yeah\nah geez it wasn't ideal man and and I\nwrite a really interesting thing after\nthat do you remember the line after that\nI said at the time\nI was sure I was going to hell\nyeah\nI only hope that that isn't the case yes\nyes yes yes yeah that was yeah that was\nfunny that was the worst part about it\nis I was I thought I was going to be you\nknow I thought I was raised to be a\nvirgin until you're married yeah and not\nonly did I was I no longer a virgin\nuntil I was married I had been\nblackmailed into it and I felt guilt and\nshame and and and and and and all this\nstuff and ah it was not it was not ideal\nbut I chose not to say\nwell that's my lot that's that's what my\nrelationship with sexual intercourse\nwill always be uh I chose not to do you\nknow to just feel victimized in that and\nchose to try to turn the page found\nhealthy relationships healthy sexual\nrelationships\num and you know\nenough my mom was like oh no we were\njust trying to make sure you weren't\ngonna you know we were preaching that\nbut I figured you might do it before you\ngot married\nand so and that's another thing right\nthere what we're doing right here I\nthink a part of why I never felt like a\nvictim is\nyou and I just laughed at that\nand on paper you go wait a minute\nwhere's the joke there's nothing funny\nabout that but let's recognize what we\njust did did you and I just deny the\nseverity of what happened not at all if\nanything we dealt with it and I can see\nit more clearly\nhumor is such a revealer of Truth and\nand and it's uh I think it's good for us\nall to remember and I gotta remind\nmyself all the time and if you laugh at\nsomething does it you find humor in the\nsituation\nit can be incredibly great truth now\nsome of the best truth comes out it\ndoesn't deny the crisis\nit doesn't erase it it doesn't wax over\nit and say oh I'm just living in the\nclouds I'm a foolish Optimist no it's\nmore than a survival technique it's\nactually a way of understanding\num anyway that happened right there\nthat's that's another thing that's been\nreal\na real good uh\num intrinsic value that I've had and\nbeen raised around and which is in\nhaving a sense of humor to reveal the\ntruth in situations and the book has\nthat the book has that moment as you as\nyou're reflecting or recalibrating on a\nlot of the themes that are there in the\nbook and I I was thinking about that the\nother day that I I feel I was talking to\nsomeone about it I was like I feel that\nway about both laughter and Tears like\nthat there are almost two things we try\nand hold back like we're like oh you\ncan't cry about that or you can't laugh\nabout that and and actually sometimes\nthose are the two best things to do\nabout most of those scenarios in life\nand why not do it more and more you know\nI know we're trying to raise our kids to\nsay Hey you know I tell them a story and\nthis is part of why I got into it went\ninto finally went to film School in\ncollege\nI started keeping a diary because\nI would go to the\ntheater and it'd be a packed house\nand I would laugh at the joke that\nnobody else in the theater laughed at\nthe whole theater would laugh at the\njoke that I was like I didn't think that\nwas funny\nI was fine and I was not crying when\npeople\nsomeone close died I was crying when\nsomeone was born and I was going is this\nokay am I weird am I often I was like no\nthat would lean into that it's okay and\nlet's start writing these things down\nabout how you feel about particular\nsituations Matthew and and started to\nwrite those down and then find some\nconfidence to go that's okay talk to my\nparents talk to friends about them they\nwere like no that's different but that's\nyou know keep writing down those unique\nsides of yourself and that that's a good\npoint we try to raise our because hey\nlaugh cry whenever he said come on let\nit out let's be part of the conversation\nit goes along with people say oh don't\nyou know that old adage don't talk to\nyourself yeah what no do talk to\nyourself just remember to answer talk to\nyourself all you want just answer I love\nthat just answer that's true that's a\ngreat way of putting it yeah it's and\nactually that's that's half the off the\nchallenge right like all of these like\nold kind of rules or statements or\nwhatever it may be kind of block that\nthinking but what you were doing by\nwriting it down and I love that and I\nlove how much of the book is like\nliterally looks like scribbles of your\nwriting and your journals and your\nannotation which which I get fascinated\nby but that was you when you when you\ntalk about the concept of knowing who\nyou are is hard and eliminating who\nyou're not first it's when you start\nwriting these things down that you start\nconstructing who you are and\ndeconstructing who you're not yes that\nthat was it and it was look I look at my\nearly Diaries\nI was writing when I first started like\n15 right before I started writing those\nthings down like a you know a theater of\nhow my personal response was the\nsituation\nwhen do most of us go to a diary when\nwe're having problems\ndear diary I so I'm so broke up with me\nit broke my heart the stuff I won't say\nto anybody else is just between me and\nyou hard times\nearly 20s I started to notice that\nwhen I would find my groove and get\nrolling on something and was successful\nand was waking up in the morning looking\nforward to heading out into the day and\nhaving good human interactions with\npeople and was succeeding at schools\nI was like you hadn't written in your\ndiary in a while\njust like when do when do we pray\nusually when we're in trouble right and\nyou've got to say well all right I've\nbeen dissecting my failures\nI think I need to start writing stuff\ndown to make sure I take the time to\nwrite stuff down when things are going\nwell so I can dissect my successes in\nthe hopes that when I get into another\nrut again in the future which I will I\ncan go back to my Diaries and go what\nwere my habits back then when I felt\nlike I was rolling yeah and you can find\na bit of science to that satisfaction it\ncan be who you're hanging out with where\nyou were going how late you were staying\nup\num what you were eating yeah you know\nwhat I mean it can be all kinds of\nthings you can find a science too I'm\ngonna get back in that Groove again and\nit can help nudge you back it's never\nthe same but it can help get you back in\nyour lane\nso you know this identity who are you\nit's a tough question to answer\nwhat is easier and and more fun is to go\nall right if I'm not sure who I am let\nme answer who I'm not\nwhat are those people places and things\nthat are giving me a hangover or not\nfeeding me back or not bringing out my\ntruest self well you know what I'm going\nto eliminate those from my life I don't\nknow where I'm going but I'm getting rid\nof where I don't want to go be anymore\nand by process of elimination you end up\nwith more things that will feed you and\nfeed your good wolf right in front of\nyou because you've eliminated the things\nthat were feeding the bad wolf yeah\nthat's that's brilliant you've reminded\nme I believe I came across it when I was\nlooking at Christianity and I'd heard it\nand it was a statement of like you know\ndon't make god of the Bible your spare\ntire make it your steering wheel right\nlike that kind of right way of thinking\nabout it like you know it's not just for\na bad time and I love what you're saying\nthere because you're spot on that we\nstruggle to get into a Groove again\nbecause we fight we forget what we did\nwhen things were good because we never\nthought when you're going good you think\nyou're never going to forget them\nbecause you think oh this is it this is\nthe mean this is how it will always be\ntrust it that Hill's coming yeah and we\nwe remember the bad times more than the\ngood times because when something good\nis happening we celebrate for a day and\nwhen something bad's happening we cry\nfor a month and we get so immersed in\nthat pain that you remember that pain\nyou have a good memory for pain but we\ndon't necessarily have a memory for for\nmovement and joy and growth\npleasure and success and those things\nyeah and I know I'd have to watch this\nwith me when things are going really\nwell I'm like aha this as I said this is\nthe mean this is as it should be and and\nyou can just sustain this and if it goes\nbelow this that's a debit but it it\nshould always be the size and it's just\nnot fair to ourselves or anyone else\nbecause either we're going to create our\nown crisis for ourselves or the world's\ngoing to give us one yeah that we didn't\nask for and we're going to have to adapt\nto something and be beneath that mean\nagain and it's good to have a little map\nif you can of wait where was I where's\nmy head where's my heart how aligned\nwere they\nin the decisions and choices I was\nmaking when I felt like life was one big\ngreen light and you can go back and you\ncan see how you can engineer them by our\nhabits yeah it's it's like I mean using\nyour beautiful metaphor it's like\nremembering a route or a path to\nsomewhere like when you knew you found\nthat really cool path up that really\nbeautiful road and it was quicker and\nfaster and if you never wrote it down\nyou just forget it but tell us you you\nsaid like we all have three choices you\nwere like persist pivot or concede how\nhave you how have you decided in your\nlife when to persist when to Pivot and\nwhen to concede because and tell us\nshare some examples for those that you\nthink would help people understand well\nlet's bring up a situation and if you\ncan think I want to shoot it at me we\ncan we can deconstruct these three on\nthat yeah look well maybe growing up to\nbecome a lawyer like you know you\nthought you wanted to become a lawyer\nthat may be one yeah so I started I want\nto become a lawyer that was that was the\nin-house in family\nCredo that was it I was a great debater\nI would win arguments I I was tireless\nin them I was in school debate in high\nschool this is it family business is\ngoing well shoot the joke was you go\nbecome that you'll defend the family's\nbusiness Matthew go ahead great I'm\nheading off great idea\nI go to University of Texas headed\ntowards law school well the first two\nyears in school what are you taking\nyou're taking liberal arts filling out\nsome credits after that sophomore year\nyou better start knowing where you want\nto go because you those credits you have\nto they have to fill fulfill the\ndirection you're heading and if you\nswitch your Majors junior senior you can\nlose credits\nwell I was not sleeping well with the\nidea that I got to finish school here\nthen I got to go to law school then I\ngot to try to get a job and then if I'm\na practicing lawyer I'm really not\nmaking a Mark or experiencing anything\nuntil in my 30s I said I really don't\nI'm not excited about the idea of\nspending my 30s getting educated in a\nclassroom about something before I can\nactually practically experience it so\nI had been writing as you know and I\nstarted sharing those writings with a\nfriend of mine who was at NYU Film\nSchool those names Rob bindler he said\nhe the writings were good and he also\nsaid you know what you got great\ncharacter and confidence you should\nthink about in front of the camera too\nwell that part I kind of was too didn't\nhave the courage to even embrace the\nidea of being in front of the camera it\nwas too avant-garde I came from a blue\ncollar worked your way up you had to be\nan actor I mean that's like that's so\nEuropean you know what I mean or\nwhatever and so oh what is that that'll\nnever fly but I could grasp the idea\nthat I'll go I want to go be a\nstoryteller\nbehind the camera now I gotta call dad\nmom who are paying my schooling for this\num I gotta pivot all right now I could\nhave kept my head down and just gone no\nthis is just a pipe dream you got right\nnow lawyer of work just follow it\nthrough you'll be a damn good lawyer\nwhich I believe I would have been I\ncould have persisted but I said no I I\ngot I gotta pivot here\nnow how do I pivot here I got to get the\napproval of mom and dad especially dad\nand I don't think this is gonna go over\nwell with him so let me make a plan how\nto reapproach this situation\nI'm gonna call him Tuesday night 7 30.\nhe'll be home from work he'll have had\ndinner he'll be having a beer on the\ncouch with Mom he'll be in a great mood\nhe'll be able to digest this and from\nthis this question better I call him up\nand I said Papa I said uh he goes hey\nlittle buddy I said dad I don't want to\ngo to law school more I want to go to\nfilm School I'm gonna hear this pause\nfive seconds then I hear this voice\nI'll sign you sure that's what you want\nto do\nI said yes sir\nanother pause for five seconds and then\nI heard three words that were a launch\npad for me coming from my dad at that\ntime\nI couldn't have said anything better and\nI did not expect this three words were\nhuh\ndon't half-ass it\noh thank you not only did you approve\ngot me out of a shotgun and said this is\nmore than privilege you got your freedom\nhere and you better do a damn good job\nat it whoa it was freedom and I was off\nwent to film school got confidence in\ntelling stories started working in front\nof the camera and here I sit whatever 20\n30 years later\nso I made a pivot at that time because\nthe idea of continuing on to go down the\npath of being a lawyer just it wasn't I\nwasn't sleeping well it's always a good\nway for me to explain to me how you\nsleeping with it what's waking you up at\nnight the idea of doing it or the idea\nof losing or missing it it's a good way\nto measure kind of choices we got we\nwant to make in life well you know I do\nit with scripts all the time or I really\nwant to do this well let me sleep with\nthe fact that I am going to do it for\ntwo weeks and I'm going to see what\nwakes me up at night am I waking up\nbecause I'm going oh man I'm not sure if\nI trust that director of that script now\nI'm going to sleep with the fact that\nI'm not doing this now what keeps me up\nat night waking up going no I've got to\ndo that project I can't go without it\nit's a good measuring stick for going\nwell I think I'm gonna do it you know\nwhat I mean so what I wasn't sleeping\nwell with the idea of being a lawyer it\nwould have things would have worked out\nin another way and probably okay if I\nwould have done that but my soul was\nitching and I was uncomfortable and I\nmade a pivot at that time yeah that's\nthat's a great one everyone's listening\nand watching right now I literally want\nyou to write these two things down\nbecause these are practical things that\nyou can do and I know that my community\nloves stuff that they can actually do\nthe first one here was write down your\nwins write down those grooves write down\nwhen things are going in the right\ndirection uh the green lights and what's\ngoing right and how you're doing it who\nyou're around what's happening and the\nsecond one here I love this piece of\nadvice like sleep with it as if you are\ngoing to do it right or sleep with it as\nif you're not going to do it like both\nof those are great yeah great ways of\ntesting which one you woke up feeling\nmore excited about or nervous about or\nanxious about and what part of it like\nthat's such a I love that like that's so\npractical I've never I've never thought\nabout it like that and I think I'm gonna\nI'm gonna play with that one too it's a\ncool decision making Paradigm if you can\ngive yourself enough time to really\ncommit your mind like I'm doing this and\nyou'll start to realize well what does\nthat mean for the next six months of my\nlife the next year what am I going to\nmiss out on uh or God or are you are you\nthinking about everything you're going\nto do with that I mean it's more of a\nreason it's waking up at night because\nyou just can't wait to get up and work\non it that's another thing that's saying\nyeah you probably I'll do it there's\nthere's good scared and there's bad\nscared you know yeah it's nice on any\nsituation and be scared but you let your\nSpider Sense to say wait a minute am I\nscared because\nthis is a great Challenge and I'm not\nsure what I'm going to do but I'm got\nthe courage to dive in or am I scared\nbecause\nthe pedigree around it isn't maybe up to\nthe Excellence that I want and that's\nanother kind of scared you're like I\nneed to listen to that maybe that's a\nreason not to do it yes yes yeah I love\nthat distinction between the two and\nthat links nicely to one of the other\nquotes that stuck out to me in the book\nwhere you were like you know when you\ncan ask yourself if you want to before\nyou do and I thought I was like yeah\nthat's that's real right there because\nthere's a lot of things and and actually\nit's one of the biggest things I hear a\nlot of is I'm always encouraging people\nto move towards their their purpose and\nthings that fulfill them and and moving\nin that direction and pivoting as you\ndid and and a big part of that question\nis but I can do so many things right and\nthat's a common thing with people like\noh but I could do every I could do this\nI could do that I could do this but you\nhave this really distinction ask\nyourself if you want to walk us through\nthat and why that was such an important\none to write down and push out well it\nworked its way into a nice little\nLimerick riddle as it laid out and it's\ngot you know there's different ways to\nlook at the the line\num\nlook too many options can make tyrants\nof all of us you know yeah the the\ndevil's in the yeses\nmore than the nose you know what I mean\nyeah I mean I've been there where let's\nsay me you know after I got famous in\nthe Time to Kill\nmy life\nto the 180. the Friday before time to\nkill came out there were a hundred\nscripts I wanted to do and would have\ndone anything to do\nbut 99 or no you cannot do them and one\nof them was yes well over one weekend I\ngot a movie that does well time to kill\nthat Monday out of those 100 scripts all\nof a sudden it was 99 or yes they're\nyours go for it please they're all green\nlights please do them one of them's no\nand I'm going oh wait a minute in a\nmatter of 72 hours\nI three days ago would have done any of\nthis and couldn't do any and now you\ntell me I can do all of them\nwell all of them look great I mean you\nasked me to be Discerning right now and\nto ask inside my soul when my head is\njust spinning going wait a minute two\ndays ago I would have done any of these\nhow do I\nknow what I want to do I want to do all\nof them but wait Matthew's only 2 24\nhours in the day I know but I need 90\nhours in a day anybody given that nope\nthey're not giving that still 24 hours a\nday uh what I gotta do well for me I had\nto get the hell out of Dodge get out of\nnow Hollywood and go hear myself think\nlet me let my let my memories catch up\nlet my brain get reconnected to my heart\nand soul and get an autobond in there\nbecause at the moment at that time there\nwas a there was a one lane Gravel Road\nand it was bumpy driving you know\nbetween the old head and The Head and\nthe Heart\nso I took off and had to go listen to\ntry to listen to myself and get some\njust you know some sort of demarcations\nbetween all this frequency of options\nthat were now on top of me\num\nI don't know if that answers your\nquestion\nit does it does it does I was going to\nfollow it up with um what's the hardest\nno you think you've ever had to say like\nwhat was like the one which you like\nthis was like this challenged me where I\nI wanted to say yes but but I had to\nfollow my own advice and say no well the\nheart is no for me and I'll base this on\nCareer yeah was about 14 years ago and\nthe stories in the book of when I was\nrom-com King yeah yeah okay yeah\num they were fun they were easy I love\ndoing them I was getting paid big bank\nfor doing them we missed them my wife\ndoes for sure you know I mean I hope\nmaybe I still got another good one in me\nin me out there\num they were making money for the\nstudios I was the go-to rom-com guy and\nlike I said they were Saturday\ncharacters they were easy there was\nnothing wrong with that but\nI was feeling very vital in my life I\njust had a newborn son I'd met the woman\nthat I'm now married to and I I loved\nharder I I I had I was could get angrier\nharder I laughed louder I my life was\nlike vital\nand I was like boy my my life's so much\nmore vital than my work I wish I could\nfind some characters that would\nchallenge the Vitality of my own life\nthe man I'm in the man I am in the life\nI'm living\nso I learned dramas I was looking for\nthese dramas well those dramas weren't\ncoming\nso this goes back to the process of\nelimination\nif I can't get what it is I want to do\nI'm going to stop doing what it is I've\nbeen doing that's not filling me up\nright so I made a staunch stance and\nsaid I'm not going to do the rom-coms\nanymore I'm not doing the action\nAdventures\nwell guess what if you're not going to\ndo those I'm kind of you may not be\nworking for a while and that was true\nfor 20 months I didn't work\nfor 15 of those 20 months I got offered\nzero not a zilch I was gone I thought\nHollywood may have forgot about me\nso it was a big no\nthe hardest to know because I'm sitting\nthere this time getting offered 15\nmillion dollar offers for well-written\ncool romantic comedies I'm like pretty\ndamn good and by the way it's even\nbetter the version of 50 million dollars\nis a better script than the the one that\nwas offered at eight million dollars\neven though they were the same words I\nwas like you know so I I looked at those\nthings but I said no I I made this\nChoice with myself I made this Choice\nwith God I made this Choice with my wife\nCamilla uh my family knows about it uh I\nreally need to go through this dry\nperiod I don't know how long it's going\nto last I gotta hang on to the belief\nthat if it's to be something will come\nup the work I want to find will come up\nand find me and sure as heck 20 months\ninto it all of a sudden I was a new good\nidea so I had an unbranding two-year\nphase I didn't Rebrand I unbranded I was\ngone I wasn't in the rom-coms you didn't\nsee me on the beach without a shirt\nwhere's McConaughey I don't know he's\nforgotten forget it don't even send\nanother subscript because he's not going\nto do it it's wrong con all of a sudden\nsomeone's going you know what would be\ngood for Killer Joe Magic Mike mud True\nDetective the house Buyers Club Makai be\na good idea it's kind of an interesting\nit's a novel idea now it wasn't novel\ntwo years before\nyou know so that was a big time where I\nI dug my heels in and said no\nthat's eliminated what it was I was\ndoing to then\nfind and be found and offered what it is\nI wanted to do and who I wanted to\nbecome that's a great connection to that\nonset like I wasn't thinking of that\nwhen I said that that's uh that's that's\na great connection to that because\nalmost unbranding or unlearning or\nalmost like you said disappearing is is\nthe hardest way of refining your\nidentity because you don't know what the\nnext step is so there's a leap in that\nDarkness there's that you're you're\nyou've thr you're\nconsciously and deliberately and\nintentionally throwing yourself into\nlimbo yeah which is the worst thing\nwe're all in a certain limbo right now\nit's the most uncomfortable part it's\npart of the reason our country's divided\nso wide right now because people need\npurpose identity and something to cling\non to so they're clinging onto the\nfringes just to have a sense of\nokay at least I'm about something I\ndon't know if I agree what it's about\nbut at least I'm about something yeah\nyeah and it's it's it's you're throwing\nyourself into a limbo and then look I\nhad help I had I had a great wife next\nto me helping me out I had a newborn son\nwhich was my North Star Compass every\nday every time I get antsy what am I\ndoing I have no significance in my life\nI don't know what I'm gonna do I was\nlike well look at look at your family\nlook at that young look at that young\nman right there that you were part of\ncreating and that you can raise as a\nfather it's a brand new day for him\nevery single day let's try and see what\nhe's seeing or put things in front of\nhim that are going to make him go ah I\nlike this next day so that was that was\nthat gave me an anchor during that time\nwhen I was getting what I was had\nsometimes being quite wobbly yeah no\nthat's that's beautiful man I I think\nthat that is is a great lesson for all\nof us and it's so funny that you know\nwhen I was reading your book and\nliterally in the last couple of weeks\nI've been talking to my team because\nI've been coming off like I was saying\nto you earlier my my book space and and\nI was looking at 2021 and and I was kind\nof having this moment where I was like\nand it's it literally timed when I was\nreading your book I was like I need to\nstart saying no next year like that's my\nnext challenge like my challenge next\nyear is to go deeper in what I've\ncommitted to and do it better\nand and go into just immersing myself\ninto it rather than trying to do ever\nyou know trying to do all these things\nwhere at one point in my life it was\nreally important that I was trying to do\na lot of things and and now well you're\nprobably being offered to do things\nyou've never been able to offered to do\nbefore totally and and it's like yeah\nplease thank you I'd love to yeah yeah\nand I'm literally in that I'm in that\nphase of my life right now in this phase\nof it where I'm like okay well actually\nI need to stop that so it just came so\nperfectly timed and it was so\ninteresting I was saying to someone the\nother day I was like there's all these\nopportunities but you know it's not\ngonna work if I if I just keep chasing\nthem and I loved how you brought that\nback to relationships because this this\npart of it I think and you know the\nrelationship you have with your your\nkids your wife is beautiful but it's\nlike it's it's really interesting the\nway you explain it like The Arrow\ndoesn't seek the target the target draws\nthe arrow and and you said that you\nweren't even in a space where you were\nseeking partnership you weren't even you\nweren't even looking for it and I think\nthis is you know when you just said that\nlike even though I didn't know what was\nnext and I unbranded myself but I had my\nson and I could look at what I've\ncreated I think for a lot of people\nthey're struggling because even their\nrelationship world is in limbo whether\nthey don't have the right partner or\nthey they don't have a partner and and\nyou know their work life's kind of going\nbut they don't have that where was it\nfor you where you felt you attracted\nyour wife like where did that come from\nso\nI am\nyou know we all have our biological\nclock and our idea when we're younger\nwhen do we see ourselves\nhaving a meeting that that woman or that\nman and then having a family you know\nand then those years come up on us I I\nI've never really been a time clock\nkeeper\num but subconsciously I I I I I was at a\ntime in my life where\nI assure as heck didn't want to date\nanybody unless I thought it had\npossibilities of becoming a full true\nlong-term relationship yeah I didn't\nwant to I wasn't wanting to Waste My\nTime dating someone unless that\npotential is there\num and if there wasn't\nyou know it's time for us to move on and\nwe had some amiable breakups with some\nwonderful women that we just both saw\nhey this is not gonna\nwe both we both want to find the one\nthat we have more potential we've gotten\nto a point as far as I think we can go\nso you know\num\nbut I did find myself\nlooking I found myself\nin the produce section at the store\nlooking down I wonder if she's gonna\nbring Murphy I want to maybe I'll say hi\nto her I was I was looking you know at\nthe red light at the at a club or a bar\nor a friend would introduce and what I\ndid in my own thoughts and meditation\nand prayers on what came to me was\nit's okay\nMatthew don't try so hard to find the\nright woman to start a family I know\neverything you've always the one thing\nyou've only known you ever wanted to be\nwas a father but you don't don't try so\nhard to find the right woman to get\nmarried you might end up an 80 year old\n88 you're a bachelor with a bunch of\nkids and I'm not going to judge you on\nthat but quit trying to make it happen\nas soon as I quit trying to make it\nhappen and what I was out and not sort\nof\nmeasuring women like maybe it's a\npossibility maybe not objectifying well\nI don't know I was more present I was\nmore fun I was more me\nand as soon as I quit looking that's\nwhen she came\nthe same way I did but when she showed\nup and I saw her now by now I put on\nmoving across the room\nuh right to left in my eye line and I\nremember I saw this woman and and under\nmy breath to myself I said what is that\nand say who was I said what is that I\ngot up introduce myself\nspoke the best Spanish I've ever spoke\nI've never spoken I go to Spanish since\none and since that night I met her\nthere's never been another woman I\nwanted to to go on a date with uh spend\nthe night with uh anything and she's now\nmother of three of our children and and\nwe've been married now for\nshoot what are we coming on um\neight nine years and that's when I was\nable to found it find her that's when I\nwas able enough it goes back to a little\none of those earlier lessons with my\nfather moving on be less impressed more\ninvolved yes yes that's when I was I was\ncomfortable to be myself and and give\nher her space because I wasn't like\ntrying to dissect wait are you the one I\nwasn't playing I wasn't measuring her I\nwas able to be myself hold my own\nConstitution she was able to be herself\nand we naturally came together so it\ndrew the I the the uh the target drew\nthe arrow yeah when I quit looking I\nthen that's when I found the one for me\nI have to ask do you dream a lot Matthew\ndo you remember your dreams a lot when\nyou dream like well I remember ones like\nthat\num I do dream a lot\num and like most people most streams I\nforget most of them\nbut\nI have had a few that are consistent\nthat have that that have\nbeen recurring dreams and when I have a\nrecurring dream that is note for note\nshot for shot exactly the same dream I\ntake that as a sign Celestial suggestion\nat least that my subconscious is trying\nto tell me something or my God is trying\nto tell me something\num and and I try to back up and go okay\nI need to listen to this and you can't\ngo to someone else for advice about it\nbecause it's only your dream and it was\na dream so you have to really go how\nmuch Merit do I give this yeah you know\nand you were talking about it earlier\nthe truth sometimes we don't we miss the\ngreen lights around yes\nthey're there yeah are we in a place to\nreceive them are we in a place to be\npatient enough to make them personal and\nsee why they came to us then are we\ncourageous enough to act on them\nand preserve them and make them part of\nour daily habits and inner being yeah\nthey come around all the time and as you\nknow you can't listen to every sign no\nor you're running Miracles you know I've\ndone that before yeah and everything you\nknow you've seen art everywhere oh my\ngosh I got that quote in there about a\nman full of ideas needs to be need some\nstarvation a man full of Truth needs to\nbe fed well I've had those times where\nI'm full of so many ideas ever I'm\ninspired everywhere and I'm going I\ngotta cut some of this out because\nthere's too much inspiration yeah I\ncan't focus there it's a shotgun spread\nand I need a little rifle here\num and at the same time\nwe don't want to be so closed up that\nyou're missing them or you let them pass\nand you don't give them credit when they\nwhen they come yeah you know yeah yeah\nyou're one of your dreams obviously not\nnot a dream while you were asleep was to\nbecome a father like that was always\nbeen a big thing for you what was it\nthat you dreamed of about being a father\nthat you look forward to so much and how\nis it being on like how has that been\ncompletely surpassed in reality yeah so\nbecause I'm not a father yet so so I'm\nnot I'm not yet not yet yeah exactly\nwell so I remember when I was eight\nyears old just having this romantic\nrealization that the reason my dad\nwanted me to call the men that he would\nintroduce me to sir and shake their hand\nand look him in the eye which I was\nlooking up at their eye as a young\neight-year-old boy it came to me that\nwhat's the one consistency in all these\nmen that I am giving them the respect of\nyes sir why am I call him sir\nbecause they're fathers um\nand I remember eight years old going\noh that's it\nthat's when you've made it\nsuccess\nas a male on Earth to become a father so\nto me that was like one day\nthen you've made it Matthew it was\nalways very clear to me since I was\neight years old and the one thing I\nalways knew I wanted to be\nnow I have children you have the first\nif and when you do have\nI write about in the book the first six\nmonths after you have your firstborn\ndon't double down triple down on any\nInstinct you have man is never more\nmasculine and clear the man's heart and\nhead and spirit are never more aligned\nthan right after he has firstborn triple\ndown on any Instinct you got career-wise\nrelationship-wise everything you're in\nthe zone good to know\num and so then you have them the the\nthing that one of the surprising things\nin all parents I think know this is that\nbefore having children I thought it was\nmore about environment than it was DNA\nyou know you have children and you\nrealize we're early no it's more about\nbiology than I thought they kind of are\nwho they are I can nudge them and\nShepherd them and move them their way\nand put in front of them what turns them\non and try to keep them from from\ndangerous harm but they are who they are\num\nbest thing that I didn't notice about\nhaving children before I had children is\nthat now I'm immortal\nno moral hopefully they have kids and\nthat's the lineage so now when whatever\nperceivable Shadow we leave when we're\ngone\nthat's my that's the shadow I want\nto leave that's the shadow that will\nkeep me alive forever that's to just\nkeep living Shadow right there you\nbecome immortal when you become a father\nor a parent a mother becomes Immortal\num\nthat's great advice that's that's\nbeautiful what's a skill or uh what's\nwhat's a skill or a quality that you\nthink you're most wanting to see them\ndevelop or or or and and vice versa\nwhat's something that you think they've\ntaught you about yourself that yeah you\ndidn't expect\num\nI Camille and I are trying hoping to\nraise them\nso whatever they individually\nuh known individual ways\nto be uh\nconscientious autonomous and confident\npeople\num\nwe value\n[Music]\nfamily we also value self-reliance\num I wanna you know and you'll see if\nwhen you become a parent you you have to\nmeasure kids aren't afraid to fall fall\noff out of a tree until they fall\nso\nhow high on that limb do you let them go\nbefore tell him no no no no no no no no\ncome down yeah because for the first\ntime when you do that they're like what\nwhat's the big announce and they get\nnervous yeah so you measure in life and\nit's a metaphor the treatment but you\nmeasure well I'm going to be cool\nbecause if they fought from that one\nthey may just scrape their arm and\nBruise himself and that'll be worth it I\ndon't want to I don't want to ruin the\nInnocence impurity that they have then\nall of a sudden they get up to let them\ntall and feel like dude if they sell\nfrom that that's we're going to hospital\nI think I may need to tell them to come\non down but for the first time you're\ngoing to make them conscious yeah\nthey're gonna have to put on the Fig\nLeaf yeah you know what I mean\num so to measure that and let them\nnegotiate situations on themselves for\nthemselves let them the three of them\ndon't interrupt every time the three of\nthem are arguing or they're arguing with\ntheir friends let them negotiate that's\nreal life they're going to get out the\nworld's not just going to lay out a\ncarpet for them yeah in my life we're an\naffluent family I want to give my\nchildren a lot of them to own up to\nwhere the affluence that we have but\ndamn sure not rely on it yeah and then\nalso how do we define success\nit's a very interesting thing look up\nthe earliest web search dictionary\nversion of success to today's version of\nsuccess\ntoday is about it it mentions like Fame\nand money and all these things and the\noriginal version talks about integrity\nand and so so what is success what do we\nwhat do they want to be relevant for\nthey're all three very kind\nchildren some more one of them's more\nconscious than the other two one of them\nis the the the the the the the\nthe comedic relief in the family but\nsmart as well the other one is very\ncreative but dog on it doesn't know\nwhere\nshe put her glasses in there on her face\nthe other one when you're looking for\nyour glasses she reminds you on he\nreminds you they're on your face you\nknow what I mean so yeah there are\ndifferent they're just some of them are\nvery practical times some of them are\nvery Whimsical they're all very very\nkind\num and uh I hope them be that they're\nconscientious autonomous and confident\nwith who they are and have the ability\nto\nyou know we still say we never we never\nsay don't talk to strangers no we travel\nthe world we're like yes go introduce\nyourself go ask don't I'm gonna I'm not\ngonna do it for you go I'll be over here\nwatching Engage The World's a good place\nthere's evil in it we have to but but I\ndon't wanna\ndon't want to get you gun shy about the\nHarms in the world before\nyou know you realize some of them\nyourself and let them engage in some way\nthey may have the bruise or the scrape I\ndon't want to engage them the ones that\nsend them to the hospital but engaging\nthe ones that you come away going ow\nthat didn't feel like what I thought as\nI said don't now you know\nyou know so\nselfish you know\nwell that's another thing I can get into\nwhat I feel about that word selfish and\nunpack that because I'm a fan of that\nword because yeah go for it most selfish\nis actually being the most selfless\num\npeople you know look at what we're in\nnow and all the change we're going\nthrough I don't know how to make\nsystemic change I don't know how to\nwrite policy\nbut each one of us know how to look\nourselves in the mirror and say how can\nI do a little bit better yeah how can I\nvalue values a little bit more for\nmyself and if I do that you do that\nand another person listening does that\nwell all of a sudden\nwe start forming a collective and that\nCollective will be better it will be\nmore valuable Society yeah so what is\nthat spot where the choice I call it the\negotistical utilitarian where's that\nspot where the choices we make for us\nyes I'm doing this for me my ego wants\nto do this where does that eye meet the\nwe yes where does the want meet the need\nand the need meet the want yeah where do\nwe look as good as we feel and feel as\ngood as we look you know where do those\noverlap and that seems to me to be the\nhoney hole yeah I'm trying to unpack and\ncontinually Chase knowing\nI'm never gonna get there hmm\nbut I think that's what it's about\ntotally chasing yet\nthat's what our lives are about\nthat's what America is about\nyou know it's an aspiration and if we\nhave the will and to want to go you know\nwhat I want to incrementally I\nincrementally believe life is can have\nan evolutionary small Ascension but\nthings can improve just a little bit\nor what the hell are we growing older\nfor what's Experience for if we're not\nyou know if there's not at least a\nlittle Ascension\num and keep chasing it stay in the race\ncommit to the chase of that\nand that is as close the destination has\na kid you know again maybe it'll be\nrealized two generations later\nyou know yeah yeah there's a few things\nin that the uh there's a Sanskrit word\ncalled Dharma which which has lots of\ntranslations but one of them is is\npurpose and and purpose is seen as the\nmeshing of passion and compassion and so\nwhat you were saying there of like that\nunderstanding of like you know that\negotistic utilitarian of like you know\nwhere is it that I feel like I'm winning\nand we're winning like and it's and it's\nhaving an impact because you're not\ngonna find it in either or like if you\nget obsessed with just your egotistical\nPursuits we all know where that goes and\nif you just get obsessed with trying to\nmake a difference and trying to serve\nbut you don't feel like you're playing\nyour part in a way that fulfills you\nit's you know you it's unsustainable too\nand the point you're saying about yeah\nthe point you were saying about you yeah\nthe point you were saying about children\ntrue I I found that really interesting\nbecause something I always kind of\nwonder about before I have kids is like\nfragility and like what is my fragility\nuh\nbarrier or limit for my kids because\nwhat you're saying there is like we\nreflect our fragilities and insecurities\nonto them and and I remember I had a I\nhad a couple of friends who I remember\nthey their daughter probably I don't\nknow like two years old was like on the\nother side of the room and there were\ncandles then she was just playing with\nthe candles like her hands were over the\nfire and my and I don't have kids but my\ninstinctual response was like guys she's\ngonna burn herself like we need to go\nsave her and they're like no no like\nthat was their limit like they were like\nnope let her play with the fire it's\nonly a tiny candle if she hurts herself\nshe'll know she'll and I was like wow\nlike you know I'm not recommending that\nI'm just saying\nyeah I mean\nshe'll go out she'll remove her hand\nfrom the fire before she's actually\nreally burned and she'll know from now\non that that glowing thing is hot\nand it won't you know we'll do it again\nusually won't do it again yeah and you\nknow we don't we don't we can be told\nwhat to do we can be taught people can\ngive us advice but really we don't like\nto be told what to do no nobody does\nkids don't even like to be told what to\ndo no one does if you go experience\nsomething and you have a parent you have\nfriends that let you go give it a shot\nmaybe you can pull it off I didn't pull\nit I wasn't able to pull up sometimes\nyou'll see him pull-offs if you're like\noh you just changed my reality yeah I\ncouldn't pull that off but you did yeah\nyou can jump further I didn't think you\ncould make it over that Creek and you\ndid\nwhoa Bravo okay you've read redefined uh\nmy measuring Paradigm for the situation\nnow um so sometimes they can surprise us\nyeah because they have a more they have\na talent true more of a talent for\nsomething than we ourselves do yeah um\nthe other thing to answer that question\nabout what they taught me\num\nyou know when we first had kids before\nwe had kids\nCamilla said to me\none condition\nso what's that she goes Hugo we go\nwhich means my work takes me all over\nthe world and up to that point I had\nalways gone off on my own lived in my\nAirstream trailer with my dog\nI don't go out on school nights I go to\nwork in the morning I come home fix my\nmeal have a drink study tomorrow's work\ngo to bed over and over and over I don't\nsee anybody nothing also my family there\nwait I can't be an artist with my family\nand but of course the The Good the good\nvoice the smart voice my other ear said\nyou better say yes ma'am right now yes\nma'am anyway it turned out to be the\nmost wonderful thing\nfor creativity as well yeah when I'm\ndoing as you know I've done a lot of\nHardcore dramas that happen to be like\nR-rated that my kids cannot see but how\nit's been great for me when I come home\nwith my kids five-year-old so what's\nthis what's this movie about\nand I've got to tell them in the version\nthat can make it sound fibelic or make\nit sound we're there with it and they\nthink it sounds really really cool and\ninteresting in a G-rated way\nso that's been really good for my\ncreativity to answer those simple\nquestions from my kids when I get home\nfrom work or why are you doing this job\nwhy why are you taking this role\nuh great thank you for asking that let\nme see if I can give you a satisfactory\nanswer and if I can't it's another\nmeasurement that we see earlier well\nmaybe I don't have this down yet yeah\nyou know yeah I love that that's\nbeautiful because I think especially as\nsomeone as as successful and artists as\nyou it's so easy to get wrapped up in\nlike this is how I get the most creative\nor this is my Optimal Performance level\nor I know how to get in the zone and and\nthat can sometimes be our greatest block\nto actually getting into the Zone in a\ncompletely different way yeah I'm very\nmuch I had a great mentor of mine who\nwould tell me\nMatthew you you work so hard and prepare\nso hard for scene you love to go in any\nsituation\nbalanced both feet balanced you'd love\nto go in like this she goes I'm going to\ntell you this I dare you to start\nlooking at life and your work right\nbefore you go into it get on one leg and\nsee if you can find your balance because\nin finding your balance\nbalance is when you're most alive and\nfinding the balance the the stable\nposition is when life's a verb and you\nsee Life come and it's life really\nhappens you know um and it was a great\nnote not just in work but in life\ngo into a situation and instead of\ncoming in set locked in\ndo the work that you know how to be\nsturdy and balanced but go into it\nintentionally off balance and find your\nbalance that's beautiful that's\nbeautiful I love that again in my head's\nlike applying that to a million things\nright now that is so beautiful I love\nthat I love the fact that when we're off\nbalance that's when we're most alive\nit's one of my most animated searching\nseeking like looking like as soon as you\nfeel like you've got it you know it just\nAh that's beautiful that's really\nbeautiful I love that and you're in your\nin your book in the last chapter you\ntalk about the 10 goals you set out to\nachieve and we were just talking about\nyour kids achieving things that you\ndidn't see yourself achieving you had\nyour life goals written out\nhave you surprised yourself have you uh\ndid you always feel convinced it was\ngonna happen uh which ones have been the\nones that uh surprise you and which ones\nare the ones who are like yeah I I saw\nthat well it's it's a funny thing\nhere's why I didn't surprise myself\nbecause when I wrote those 10 goals down\nin 1989\nI forgot about him the next day I never\nlooked at him again God I had written\nthem\nbut obviously I didn't forget I wrote\nthem because I accomplished all ten\nalthough I consciously never looked at\nhim again or remembered them even in a\nmentalist in my mind wow\nso\nI guess the best I can tell is that oh\nyou wrote down some really true goals\nfor yourself McConnell hey because you\ndidn't even have to write about they\nwere written inside you with the\nunwritten word\nbecause you accomplished them now look\nthere's some in there that I pulled off\nI'm like what in 1989 you didn't even\nknow you were going to be an actor you\nwouldn't even admit you wanted to be an\nactor and you wrote down you wanted to\nwin an Academy Award for best actor what\ndidn't look at that for 28 29 years and\nfound it writing this book and I went\nuh okay\nwant to be a father keep God in my life\nfamily look live a life I could look\nforward looking back\nI had some pretty cool aspirations that\nfor the most part I've I've have\nsucceeded in some way in achieving\nyeah it's special to see that and I love\nthat that it was again planted as a seed\nbut you weren't obsessed about it in in\na in a in a practical way because it's\nthat it's that Obsession that almost\nmakes you feel so far away from it uh\nyou know if you're constantly like\nlooking at every day going oh where is\nthat where is that and you're only\nlooking at the Oscar whereas actually\nfor you it was that you know that pivot\nof like I've been doing these types of\nmovies and I feel like I need to unbrown\nmy you know all of that was what got you\nthe Oscar it wasn't obsessing over the\nOscar you're exactly right and look your\nword purpose\nit's let's deconstruct that in this way\nfor myself as well as everyone else\nbecause\nthat Clarity of purpose to see something\nand go accomplished I love that yeah I\nneed that it gives me significance\nachievement oh I can measure it I wanted\nto do that today and I got that done\nthis is what I wanted and I got that but\nit's a dance because not everything is\nlike that and I don't if if\nif you have a for instance in my work I\nwouldn't of\ngone and done work that was deemed\nexcellent I'll win an Academy order done\nwhatever work I've done that anyone May\ndeem excellent I wouldn't have been as\ngood at it\nI wasn't as good at it until\nI had a family\nthat came first\nwhen it was my top goal I was more\nresult in a it was more about the result\nwhen I had family and I was like ah well\nthere we go now I've made it acting was\nnumber two\ndidn't mean I worked any less hard at if\nanything I worked hard at but I was all\nabout the process I've gotten so many\nmore results when I didn't give a damn\nabout the result\nit's like that uh um you know best\nrounds of golf\nyou know when you walk off the 18th\nthough and you're headed to the next Tee\nBox and they go no you finished the\nround you're like oh I didn't even know\nit was over the Run oh yeah you said 63.\nwhat yeah you know my best work is when\nwe rap and I'm like okay everyone I'll\nsee you tomorrow morning they're like no\nthere is no tomorrow morning the show's\nover I'm like oh that's it\nyou know it's the Bo Jackson he didn't\nrun across the goal line\nhe ran across the goal line through the\nend zone up the tunnel yeah you know\nwhat I mean it's like extend your Finish\nLine\nto or to to a place that you're like oh\nit's like now dealing with coven I think\nit's very good for us to think\nwhat if this is going on for another\nthree years\num\nwe'll probably be able to gauge engage\nsomewhat normally before then yeah but\nif I\nI think that moment I'm already starting\nto get my my purpose and survival skills\nare coming to the Forefront I'm\npreparing if I'm thinking I hope it\ncomes over tomorrow\nI'm wasting 30 of my energy thinking is\ntomorrow the day and then I wake up oh\nnot today yeah okay maybe tomorrow\nno not tomorrow you're wasting energy so\nit's a good practice I think to put\nthings way out in front of you that are\nbeyond your reach yeah so then they\ndon't they don't stay in that first\nplace you can't quite grasp them you\ncan't they're not tangible and you'll\nactually probably achieve them have a\nbetter chance of achieving them if you\njust put your head down and stay in the\nprocess I love that I love that man\neveryone that is green lights uh by\nMatthew McConaughey make sure you grab\nthe book we're putting the link in the\ncomments I highly recommend it if you\nwant to be entertained enlightened and\nhave an experience at the same time it's\nuh it's a perfect journey in that and if\nyou want to learn more about someone\nthat you've been watching for so many\nyears and loving and appreciating then\nuh this is the book to go to uh Matthew\nwe end every episode with a Fast Five\nthese uh the final five questions and\nthey have to be answered in one word to\none sentence maximum so that that's the\ndeal and you've always been already been\nvery generous with your time so this is\nthis is the last thing so your first\nquestion is what was your biggest lesson\nfrom the last 12 months\nmake sense of humor your default emotion\nnice I like it awesome all right\nquestion number two what's something you\nknow to be true but other people would\ndisagree with you on what's something\nthat you're like very confident about\nbut people may may not agree with you\nspending time alone and not enjoying the\ncompany\nis a\nhealthy constructive practice because\nthere's only one person we're stuck with\nin this life\nspending time alone and not enjoying the\ncompany is a constructive\nstick with it don't pull the parachute\nin the discomfort\nyou will work it out the monkeys on your\nback will finally start playing and then\nthen swinging from the trees in a right\nway and you it will get organized don't\npull the parachute in the discomfort\nstick through it because if you pull out\ntoo early\nwhen you're not getting along with\nyourself it's gonna Bubble Up in awkward\nways later on and you're going to be\nforced to go through the pendant so\nstick with it you'll come out the other\nside you'll shake hands with yourself\nand you'll realize there's only one\nperson I can't get rid of and that's me\nwe better get along\nI love that that's great advice I had\nmany moments like that in my monk life\nso I I could definitely relate to\nsticking through that okay question\nnumber three uh if you could have one\nsuperpower what would it be\ninvisible that's the one yeah I gotta I\ngotta just take the the easy low-hanging\nfruit and go and then and then just say\nokay now that you're invisible let's see\nif you can handle this great free yeah\nthat's a real tester there that's one\nthat'll challenge somebody the most but\nwhat can you do with that power it is\ntrue it is true can you be trusted with\nthat power\nyeah can you trust yourself with it and\ncan you deal with what it exposes you to\nyep yeah those are the challenges\nabsolutely all right question number\nfour when does a risk not make sense\nbecause as you were saying your father\nwhen you take risks you started to take\nyou've taken loads of risks in your life\nyou know there's there's plenty of\nexamples in the book when does a risk\nnot make sense when it's for risk's sake\num\nit's like\nyou know\nan eccentricity for eccentricity's sake\nyeah like what the hell is that for yeah\nI I like to see is there is there\nconstruction is there is this a\nconstructive risk yeah is taking this\nrisk what can it pay what can I get from\nit yeah what will be the green light in\nthis what is my Roi return on investment\nof taking this risk and\nlike I said it's not a risk unless you\ncan lose a fight um\nit's not really a risk unless you can\nlose a fight yeah\nwell I said all right Fifth and final\nquestion if you could create a law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be\nit's not a law but I'll say this great\nquestion for for all of us to ask\nourselves\nevery day\nand it will change this answer changes\ngreat question to ask ourselves is this\ntwo words\nI value\nquestion mark\nyeah because we all you know I I bring\nthis up in the book about we all want to\nbe relevant damn right we do but let's\nnot forget to ask relevant for what what\nreally matters what's going to think\nlong money not short money\nwhat's the long Roi what's the big\nEternal green light you know\num tee yourself up\nfor the future you know as much as you\ncan\nyou know\num yeah I value is a great question that\nuh\nI think it's prudent for all of us to\nask ourselves I didn't know it'll change\nit'll change the answer will change\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo If you enjoyed it you\nPick Your Love\ndo you talk us more on the past\nthe present or the future we all do all\nthree but we tend to have one we focus\nmore on or do you think more people\nFocus cost that's right and Achievers\nfocus on the future and happy people on\nthe present"
