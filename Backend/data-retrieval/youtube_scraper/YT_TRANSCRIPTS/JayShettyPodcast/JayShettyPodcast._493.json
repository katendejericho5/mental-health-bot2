go there\nI mean the only official game we've had\nI won and that's why this thing fall in\nfront of me you won you won that pair of\nvery old headphones that was the prize\nit was a birthday party and our friend\nuh found a pair of headphones and made\nthat the prize and then in the first\nround you knocked me out no it was so\nwhen we play unofficially humble beats\nme in ping pong all the time like I\ndon't think I've ever beaten you when\nwe've been hanging out ever yeah well it\ndoesn't count you haven't beat me it\ndoesn't count yeah but then the official\ngame and then I gave the headphones away\nuh to someone who I thought deserved\nthem more I was lucky that day I can't\nbelieve it I was on some lucky streak\nwell yeah it was a party yeah it was a\nparty I party harder than you so you're\na little bit tipsy so I don't drink so\nI'm gonna wear it yeah you have a few\ncompetitive advantages\nI love it but humble man we've been\nfriends for like I'm like four years now\nI feel like longer since we started\nhaving our conversations yeah completely\nand it's been beautiful to like just you\nknow I think as two people in an\nindustry where it's busy and we're doing\nso much somehow I think we found a way\nto have these really meaningful\nconversations yeah I remember I was at\nyour house earlier this year at your\napartment earlier this year and we were\nhanging out and then the next day\neveryone was like what time did Jay\nleave or what happened because everyone\nI always leave early to go to sleep\nearly generally is is what I do and I\nwas at your house till like 2 A.M yeah\nand it was like how did you get Jay to\nstay out till 2am and we weren't all we\ndid was have deep meaningful thoughtful\nconversation completely it was so you're\none of the few people that I can\nactually do that with so I cherish our\nfriendship very deeply I mean likewise\nas I said this is the first conversation\nI'm not holding a notepad I just sit\nhere and try to pick your brain as much\nas I can and try to learn as much as I\ncan and I appreciate you always make\ntime for me always man always but I'm so\nglad you wrote this book bro because you\nknow I'm obsessed with love yes my new\nbooks about love yes but I think when\nyou're obsessed with something and you\nget deep into it it's really interesting\nto hear from someone else who's obsessed\nwith it and gotten really deep into it\nyeah and I want to talk to you about\nwhat we said in the intro about the idea\nof how you used to do spoken word to\nimpress girls and I think the idea of\nimpressing someone yeah is such a big\npart of how love starts like I can\nrelate to that so much like the the\nextent I've gone through to impress\nwomen in my previous life\nit's insane and walk me through why do\nwe try to impress people that we may be\nattracted to or maybe not even attracted\nto yeah I think you know I think for\nthousands of years we lived in smaller\ncommunities and we only understand\nourselves in relation to everybody else\nyou know you walk into your family you\nknow where you are in that hierarchy and\nthen we you know many of us including\nonly two generations ago came from\nfamilies in small villages so it's like\nyou find your definition and your value\nin relation to others and in Modern Life\nin these big Metropolis cities it's not\nas relevant but that need to be seen\nthat need to be validated is completely\nthere and I think that's why we have a\nlot of challenges in realizing love is\nbecause we so we spend so much time\ntrying to feed our self-esteem not\nrealizing that love comes from\nself-respect which is way more internal\nand it's completely you know you're\nabsolutely right like even me doing\npoetry back then it was like I was\nwriting about things as an artist that\nmattered to me and I was exploring\nConcepts but my only motivation to share\nit was to get attention and you start to\nfeed off of that and it gets really\ninteresting now because we live in a\nworld where that attention there's a\nmetric beside it you can count your\nlikes you can count your comments you\ncan count your followers so now it's\nlike the world subtly tells you who to\nbe if that attention matters like oh I\ndid a post it didn't get enough\nengagement so let's go ahead and post\nsomething else and then oh this really\ndid got a lot of Engagement let me make\nfive more things like that and it's\nkilling our ability to discover\nourselves and our authentic selves and\ninstead it's making us live for display\npurposes which is going to continually\nclose Pathways to love this is what I\nlove talking to you I'm loving this\nalready there's so many things that you\nsaid that I'm like yes I want to talk\nabout this let's I love what you just\ntalked about and I assure you post about\nthis a few months ago about the\ndifference between self-esteem and\nself-respect and that really hit a nerve\nwith me when you first posted about it\nwalk us through how you define them\ndifferently and why that's useful in\nthis journey of to love so for me\nself-esteem is external self-respect is\ninternal and I feel like the ways we go\nabout it don't have to be much different\num when you keep your promises to\nyourself you know you build self-respect\nand I think either you're chasing one or\nthe other the more self-respect you\ndevelop the less self-esteem you're\ngonna chase the more self-esteem you\nchase the less self-respect is going to\nbe in the room they kind of can't hold\nhands so for me you start to realize\nthat it's a relationship it just depends\non how you're going to spend and devote\nthat energy the challenge with\nself-esteem and it being external is\nthere's just way too many people with\nway too many opinions on who you can be\nyou know like the Adida volunteers uh\nquote you can be the juiciest peach in\nthe world they're just some people who\ndon't like peaches you know and that can\nhave an impact on people and a lot of\npeople are negatively impacted by the\ncomments on their social media\num by how well they received when people\nare looking at them or what have you so\nwhat I'm realizing is as we focus on\nself-respect to me which as I said\nhonoring your commitments doing hard\nthings\nfocusing on progress and not Perfection\nthat's a really big one I think when we\nhave these ideas of what we think love\nis it's oftentimes not love attention\ncontrol Power admiration Beauty success\nthese things are all external things\nthat we can receive from the world and\nthey feel like love and and they give us\na lot of immediate gratification I refer\nto them as bootleg love like when you go\nto you go to the outlet mall get a fake\nGucci belt\nand you know you get a little rush from\nit immediately but you keep thirsting\nfor more yeah you know it puts you in\nfurther scarcity so when we focus on\nthat it's a never-ending Journey whereas\nwhen we develop more self-respect we\nfeel a level of Peace it's not instead\nof getting everything you want you start\nto want less yeah and I think for me\nthat's the really big difference and\nself-respect can be literally developed\nthrough anything that you commit to do\nand the more difficult the better let's\nsay don't do hard things for me it's a\ncold shower in the morning and when we\nfocus on progress especially as we're\nentering a new year it's really\nimportant to set intentions instead of\nexpectations because oftentimes we say\noh I want to lose 10 pounds now you\nsuddenly have told yourself I'm not good\nenough as I am and when I lose 10 pounds\nmagically I'm going to feel better\ninstead of doing that because you're\nyou're harming your relationship with\nyourself\nfocus on progress I want to have a\nhealthier breakfast and maybe my\nbreakfast has 10 different elements to\nit I'm going to switch out one at a time\nor I want to wake up earlier let's say\nI'm waking up at noon every day and I\nwant to get to 6 a.m you can't just jump\nfrom noon to six let's focus on progress\nlet's start with 11 45 slowly work our\nway down progress can be endless you\nknow whereas I think Society especially\nin capitalism they need to sell us stuff\nto make us feel like we matter and the\nmessage they keep sending us is Chase\nPerfection and perfect doesn't exist and\nperfect is the last place love would\nexist because the only way to develop a\ndeep connection with somebody is through\nyour vulnerabilities if you were perfect\nyou can't be vulnerable so for me\nvulnerability comes through self-respect\nbeing brave enough to admit you know\nwhere you're difficult to be with what\nyou struggle with what your challenges\nare and then that opens up someone else\nan opportunity to do the same and then\nyou connect on a deeper level yeah I\nwant to reflect on some of the things\nthat came to my mind mind as you were\ntalking\nit's interesting isn't it like we say we\nwant love but actually we want attention\nwe say we want love but actually we want\nvalidation we say we want love but\nactually we just want compliments so we\ndon't actually know what love is or want\nlove because we're chasing it through\nthese other forms of\ncheap adoration or cheap affection one\nof the things that hit me about what you\njust said about vulnerability and this\npursuit of perfection when actually\nimperfection is at the core of love and\nrelationships\nis I was coaching a CEO recently and we\nwere working through some of their\nmental health challenges it was really\ninteresting to me because I was\nencouraging them to share that with\ntheir team I was saying you should share\nthe challenges you're going through\nbecause it will be a healthy thing to do\nand they said to me they said Jay how\ncan I share my challenges I'm the strong\none I'm The Brave One I'm the one who\nhas it all together\nand I said to them I said what's\nstronger than you telling them your\ntruth like what's braver than you being\nvulnerable with that person like there's\nnothing more strong there's no greater\nAct of courage and when they went and\ntold their team they followed through on\nthe advice\nthe team's unanimous response was\nus too like they were going through the\nsame stuff and all of a sudden they felt\nconnected so I guess what what I love\nabout what you're saying when you talk\nabout like not chasing Perfection when\nyou talk about doing hard things there\nwas one more thing you said honor your\ncommitments honoring your commitments so\nthose three things that you mentioned to\nme that's actually what self-love is\nlike we keep hearing self-love and\nyou've talked about self-respect which I\nthink is a really great pathway and\npathway but those three habits are\nreally deeply important when we're alone\nand when we're single\nand when we're not in a relationship\nlet's talk about why\ndoing hard things is so important\nin the pursuit of love because I don't\nthink those things a lot of what you\njust mentioned I'm like is this a habits\nbook like you're like helping people\nwith their day-to-day habits but there's\na connection there that I don't think\npeople see yeah one of my favorite\nmantras for myself is an easy day at the\ngym was not a good day at the gym and I\nstart to apply that to life an easy day\nof life is not a good day I think\nwhat we have in in this Society is we\nsell convenience uh and we sell comfort\nand both of those\ndon't\nInspire growth or Evolution or for us to\nunlock a better version of ourselves\num so voluntarily doing hard things you\nknow prepares us when hard things find\nus you know I I think for example you\nknow\nwhen you know as an entrepreneur it's a\nvery challenging job but then when\nyou're an entrepreneur you understand\nthat hey money's not guaranteed I don't\nget a salary every two weeks nothing's\npromised to me so then when you come\nacross a situation where things shut\ndown layoffs recession what have you\nyou're better prepared you know life's\ngonna throw curveballs what we can do\nwhen things are good is practice our\nswing so for me doing hard things is\npicking a challenge and\nmy personal equation is one foot and\nwhat I know one foot and what's familiar\nand one foot and what's unfamiliar and\nwhat's uncomfortable so I'm not\noverdoing if I want to learn to swim I\ndon't jump into the ocean the first day\nwe started in the kiddie pool and then\nwe work our way up and picking things\nvoluntarily that are difficult whatever\nit is and understanding that even for us\nyou know it took 10 years to learn how\nto read it was a systematic program put\nin school for us to do it they forget\nthat we forget that wow and we didn't\nhave we didn't have self-esteem issues\nor confidence issues back then being\nlike I don't know the alphabet I\nshouldn't even bother or when we were\nbabies trying to learn how to walk you\nknow we got up and we fell back down we\ndidn't give up it's not for me but as\nadults because we don't have somebody\nkind of Lottery over us we we may start\nsomething we're not okay with sucking at\nit in the beginning we don't see it as\nfun but you know I play a lot of video\ngames if I drop 90 bucks on a video game\nand it's too easy then it wasn't worth\nit for me you know we need challenges we\nneed to we need resistance we need to\npush and pull we need that tug of war\nbecause that's going to make us stronger\nit's going to make us more resilient\nsitting in the ice makes you resilient\nhelps you recalibrate your fight or\nflight so now your fight or flight isn't\ntriggered through an awkward\nconversation or an email or a text\nmessage or a bill that comes you know it\ngets back to where it needs to be which\nis important so I think for me it's\nrecognizing that it's not chasing\nComfort it's not chasing just simple\nstability and it's not chasing\nconvenience it's being like okay there\nis a harder way of doing things let's do\nthat for the sake of doing it because\nwhen the difficulties of Life find us\nwe're much more resilient and much more\nprepared and I think for me that allows\nme to realize my value as an individual\nwhat I'm capable of and how I can spread\nthat and be of service to other people\nwhich to me is a massive language of\nlove wow yeah and I mean\nwhat I'm hearing you speak it's like\nthat getting comfortable in discomfort\nis almost like the number one skill\nneeded in life because I feel like most\nof\nas you said what Society is trying to\nteach us in your words convenience and\ncomfort\nand it's trying to avoid discomfort yeah\nlike we're trying to avoid it we're\ntrying to dodge it we're trying to hope\nthat how can I avoid any sort of pain\nstruggle discomfort\nand while I'm while you're not saying to\ninvite it but we've got to get\ncomfortable in that uncertainty and\ncomfortable with that pain\nand\nthat applies to anything from dating\nthrough the breakups through to\nloving ourselves of course through the\nJourney we're on\none of the things you said in the book\nthat I wanted to pick out was\nfeeling left out and rejected brings up\nthose ancient anxieties of danger yeah\nand I think that's one of the biggest\ndiscomforts is feeling left out and\nrejected like when you talk about being\nuncomfortable yeah when you go to an\nevent and you feel like you'd rather\nlock yourself into a bathroom because\nyou don't want to be around anyone or\nforget that you didn't even get invited\nin the first place and sometimes you get\nupset because you didn't get invited\neven if you didn't want to go there yeah\nso talk to me through that sentence\nfeeling left out and rejected brings up\nthose ancient anxieties of danger\nagain if we were ostracized from our\ncommunities back you know\nGenerations ago it actually meant our\ndeath you know and that's in our\nprogramming now\num which makes us in Modern Life\nprioritize likability over everything\nand the challenge with that is there's\nso many things that create Pathways of\nlove and allow us to realize love won't\nnecessarily make us likable to everybody\num if you want to establish boundaries\nfor example establishing boundaries will\nreduce the amount of people that want to\nbe around you because so many people\nenjoy crossing boundaries or you know\nfind power in that or find significance\nin that but it's important to establish\nboundaries it's important to show your\nteeth I have a chapter in the book\ncalled love is showing your teeth it's\nimportant to let people know if they've\ncrossed the line it's important to let\npeople know if they've made if they've\nheard you it's important to let people\nknow if they're doing things that you're\nnot okay with because if you don't you\nabsorb it inside instead and then you\nyou fall into this world of resentment\nwhich to me I think is one of the\ndarkest places we can be and you can't\nexpress or realize love in this place of\nresentment so our fears of not being\nlikable you know as I said in the\nsubtitles book is going easy on yourself\nthis is in our programming we want to be\nliked we want to be accepted and we are\nin a modern society which has given us\nscores for our likability and acceptance\nbut that will not necessarily help us\nrealize more love and we have to see the\ndifference not everybody is going to\nlike you and that's okay and focusing on\nthat will allow us to build deeper\nconnections with people that do matter\nyou know going back to this idea of the\nCEO and the vulnerability you know I was\nraised in a household that subtly told\nme to suck it up be self-regulated so\nnow I also viewed vulnerability as a\nweakness I viewed having a romantic\npartner that complained as just being\nNaggy and we week not realizing that my\ninability to have empathy you know was\nbecause of the fortresses I made I made\na fortress to protect myself but really\nit was a prison and then when somebody\ncame to me that I cared about with their\nproblems I wanted to instantly solve it\nI thought that's what men do men solve\nproblems were solution oriented but the\ntruth what I realized for myself was no\nthey were sharing their pain it was\ntriggering my pain I didn't want to feel\nmy pain so I want to shut them up and\nthe three ways I was trying to shut them\nup was either not speaking to them\ntrying to solve their problems or saying\nsomething really stupid like well\nthere's other people going through way\nworse than you like have some\nperspective and then slowly realizing\nthrough this journey that empathy is\nfeeling their pain not saying anything\njust giving them a hug and being in that\npain together and for me like this these\nare very recent realizations for me as\nI'm trying to figure out how to deepen\nmy connection with human beings as well\nand I don't hold it against anybody for\nbeing raised to think that vulnerability\nis a weakness but you are absolutely\nright the strongest thing you can do is\nbe vulnerable and admit where you're\nhaving trouble\num that's ultimate strength and um you\nknow I'm glad to hear that that story\nworked out for him yeah yeah absolutely\nbut I mean you just said something again\ninteresting which I actually had note\ndown was\nuh uh where is this oh yeah you\nreferenced the need to sit with your\npain in order to experience love yes I\ndon't think we naturally put those\nthoughts together and that's what I've\nalways loved about what you do with\nideas is I don't think we kind of like\nwhen you hear that you're like well I\nneed to unpack that no because you\nwouldn't necessarily think those two\nthings correlate the inspiration behind\nthis entire Journey was a you know a\nrelationship that I was in that that\ndidn't run the course and all I would do\nin in isolation especially during the\npandemic was beat myself up over it as\nif I had somehow failed so there was a\nlot of reflecting and thinking about you\nknow the what it could have shoulders\nand City not realizing the subconscious\nbecause whether we're aware of a trauma\nwhether we're aware of a discomfort we\nfeel it and we're gonna feel and then\nmost often going back to modern society\nthere are so many convenient options to\nsuppress that temporarily so for me I\nwas living that life I was if I felt\nanxious I would go and have a slice of\npizza or I would go and and you know\nwatch television or go on my phone and\nthen you start to realize that so often\nthe only reason we get involved with\nsomebody is because we're Outsourcing\nthe antidote to our loneliness not\nrealizing that loneliness isn't having\npeople around loneliness is a lack of\nconnection and and that could contribute\nto why we have such a high divorce rate\nbecause people are getting together but\nthey're not getting together uh as two\nindividuals getting together with these\nkind of romanticized ideas of you're my\nbetter half you complete me humans don't\nneed completing humans aren't half a\nperson and I think but these are ideas\nthat are sold to us they're sold to us\nin media they're sold you know every\nsingle famous couple the Ross and\nRachel's they have to be people with\nvery unhealthy attachment styles to be\nentertaining because the most healthy\nrelationships we know are not very\neventful they wouldn't make for\nentertaining television I don't think\nit's a conspiracy that these television\nshows exist they're just entertaining us\nyeah and I think realizing that for me\nhaving a relationship with yourself is\nbeing alone being alone isn't sitting in\nbed on your phone being alone is being\nabsolutely alone doing absolutely\nnothing which for me is also a form of\nmeditation and\num for me it's my favorite form of\nmeditation because it's it's a form that\ndoesn't require you to ask am I doing\nthis right because there's no right way\nof doing nothing\ninstantly you start to feel anxiety\nbecause you're not stimulated you know\nthe dopamine is not coming and but the\nlonger you do that the more grounded you\nbecome with yourself yeah and now you're\nin a position to be in a relationship\nwhere you can serve the book has love\nstories and there's one love story\nabout somebody I connected with wanted\nto pursue\nthey explain to me they don't have time\nand and and I was upset and I was like\nlook if you don't make time for people\nthen you're never going to have anybody\ndon't you get lonely and she goes I do\nget lonely\nand then I said so what do you what are\nyou gonna do when you're lonely because\nI dance\nbecause when I'm lonely I dance and then\nI connect with myself wow that's super\nmature yeah yeah I was on the phone like\nI guess I got it I guess I better go\ndance too you're like I like dancing too\nlet's dance together yeah but and I I\nleft her alone after that because you\nknow she was very clear with her\nboundaries and what have you and what\nyou realize is we want connection the\nyou know the fast food version of\nconnection self-connection would be\nself-pity nobody understands what I'm\ngoing through except for me nobody's\never had their heart broken I'm all by\nmyself I just want to be able to\ncomplain about it but something deep to\nactually create an authentic connection\nwith just yourself can be dancing to\nfeel your body how many of us when is\nthe last time we've looked at ourselves\nin the mirror and looked at our body and\nwere not critical and looked at our body\nfrom a perspective of gratitude like how\nmany of us have already chosen our\nfavorite body part even though our body\nhas been with us since day Zero and even\nwhen we make poor choices our body tries\nhis best to adjust we have bad posture\nour body tries to adjust we don't put\ngood things inside our body it tries his\nbed to adjust this relationship with\nourselves our physical body can be the\nfirst step to creating an authentic\npathway of Love which can then inform\nthe relationships we can have with\neverybody else you know this\nconversation is just in a beautiful way\nas always just I'm connecting so many\ndots that are coming up and I want to\ntalk about a few things\none thing that came up was this idea of\nvoicing setting boundaries\nand\nI think one of the challenges that we\nhave with setting boundaries is we want\nto be perceived as nice and when we set\na boundary we think we're going to be\nperceived as unkind and so we'd rather\nnot set the boundaries so that again\nsomeone likes me and thinks that I'm a\nnice person but inside I'm going God I\nwish I wasn't around this person I wish\nI wasn't here I wish I wasn't doing that\nwhy do you think so often or what are\nyour thoughts about how we compromise\nour own values and our own boundaries in\norder to appear more nice and likable\nlike that seems to be the biggest\ndisassociation from ourselves yeah I I\nthink it's the short-term gratification\nversus the long term right I think the\nshort-term gratification for me\nspecifically I can say I became someone\nthat people came to with their problems\nand I felt value that I was needed and\nit took a therapist to help point out\nwhere she said listen the reason you\nactually want people that you you are\nreceiving people is because it's such a\none-sided conversation that it gives you\nthe impression that you have a\nrelationship but you're never vulnerable\nbecause they're just telling you their\nproblems they don't even notice that\nthey're not asking you about yours and\nyou like that because that helps helps\nyou avoid being vulnerable which feels\nuncomfortable for you\nbut she goes in the long run which you\ndon't realize and you said it it builds\nresentment and there can't be love if\nthere's resentment so what happens is\nthis feeling of I need to be needed\nwhich again if we think about how we\nwere raised a lot of us were raised to\nfind our value when we're needed a lot\nof us made these decisions and and\ndecided our pathway of life when we were\nkids when we were thinking very binary\nit was either this or that black and\nwhite and as we became adults and we can\nsee life a lot more complex we never\nupdated our policies and so what happens\nis life is more complex but we're\nlooking at it through such a simple\nshade and this idea is like okay and\nwhen we're kids too whenever something\nnegative happened we absorbed it as if\nit was our fault you know I have a story\nin the book my I once got sick and I\nvomited\num all over my bathroom as a little\nchild and my mother was always awake in\nfrom that she had work she got upset\nwith me and I blamed myself\nfor that not having contacts as an adult\nrealizing wait you know she works a\nnight shift\nhe's not a horrible person you didn't\nmess up it's just everybody can be\ncranky and what have you and now you\nknow making jokes about my mom because\nthe grandmother version of my mom is\ncompletely sweet she has time she's not\nworking anymore no more survival mode\nbut me internalizing that story that\nnarrative stuck with me up until today\nwe've had conversations about gratitude\nversus guilt you know and my journey as\nan artist crashing on people's couches\npeople giving places to stay hearing my\nmother's voice don't be a mooch fill up\ntheir fridge full of groceries make sure\nthey know even for you know the help\nthat you've done with me in this journey\nwhat can I give Jay what can I give Jay\nand then questioning is that authentic\ngratitude or am I just operating from a\nplace of guilt and it's not authentic\ngratitude then it's not being done with\nlove and then if it comes from a place\nof guilt that's usually related to fear\nwhich is definitely not from a place of\nLove yeah and I think going through that\njourney I think is extremely important\nso when we fear being unlikable we're\nclosing off an option and a pathway to\nrealize love love for some short-term\npeace from our anxiety you know it's\nlike pleasure like we're chasing\npleasure to medicate our lack of peace\nyeah when the peace would come from\nestablishing boundaries is going to be\nan uncomfortable transition period but\nyou'll get to a point where the people\nwho love you view your boundaries as an\ninstruction manual on how to be with you\nand how to have a healthy relationship\nwith you because what happens is for the\npeople who have boundaries and you\nrespect their boundaries they will stay\nin your lives yeah you know instead of\nyou just trying to avoid somebody who\nalways tries to overstep your boundaries\nyeah I mean what you just said that was\nso powerful I was interviewing someone\nthe other day\nand they asked me the question they said\nwell what's your working style so\nthey're like What's you how do you like\nto be communicated with and how do you\nlike to be informed of updates and\nthings like that I don't know this is a\ngreat interview question like for\nsomeone to ask me I'm interviewing them\ncompletely but they're asking me that\nand I got to tell them and they're like\nwhat are your pet peeves when it comes\nto communicating yeah and so like I got\nto walk them through\nwhat I realized was they made me feel\nreally comfortable and confident with\nthem because I was like wow this person\nis really mature and knows that I'm not\nperfect I'm not always going to be\navailable they need to understand a few\nthings about me to work well with me\nwhat what was demanded of me though was\nself-awareness in order to infer that to\nthem yeah and so what I find here is\nthat what happens in relationships or in\nlove is that we don't feel that way we\nfeel that person should be perfect they\nshould already understand me I should\nunderstand them and we're going to do\nwhatever it takes to love each other and\nthe other problem is even if you ask\nthat question chances are a lot of\npeople don't have the self-awareness to\nshare what their pet peeves are so the\ngirl who says to you hey I dance when\nI'm lonely that's high self-awareness\nright like that's uh the fact that there\nwas an answer there that was\nsatisfying to you and that almost left\nyou speechless to some degree even\nhighly left yes it's like oh wow so I\nfind that there's two sides one is our\nopenness that I'm going to get into a\nrelationship where we're both not\nperfect the other is the other person\nhaving the knowledge of themselves yes\nand it feels like we're lacking in both\nright now I think definitely and I think\none of the reasons is because of ideas\naround love\nwe don't have to teach somebody that\nimperfection is is okay in the world of\nlove every single person we currently\nlove we could probably list out their\nimperfections yeah and then the second\nquestion is does do any of those\nimperfections disqualify them from your\nlove you know also you know the analogy\nthat I always think about too is like\nthe first time I held my baby niece\nI had never met her before I had never\nhad an interaction before but just\nholding her filled me up with love so\nyou don't even need history you don't\neven need interaction so oftentimes we\nhave this skewed idea that love is\nsomething you earn love is something you\nwin love is something you qualify for\nlove is at the end of the rainbow and I\nthink these ideas motivate these types\nof actions we're like I have to appear\nperfect another thing I realize about\nmyself recently and I think this is for\na lot of men who are often seen as\ndistant or avoidant is we spend so much\ntime on a date trying to win over the\nother person\ncharm them make them make them feel like\nwe're we're really worth it that we\nspend no time looking at the other\nperson to see is this a good fit for me\ntotally we get over their wall we\npenetrate their Fortress we we make them\nfeel safe then once they they\ncommunicate to us that they like us then\nwe begin this process I'm like wait it's\nso true are they for me and then also we\nare viewing a human being and then also\nwe we get this realization\nsubconsciously or consciously that\nfurther connect with this person I'm\ngonna have to be vulnerable and then\nthat raises anxiety and then we pull\naway\nand I think often women women find that\nconfusing like I thought he was into me\nhe was into the idea of you liking him\nwithout asking himself if you're a good\nfit and I think before we enter any of\nthese situations we have to do that and\nI know the activities and the practices\nfor that will build self-awareness and\nit really is going deeper than what we\nnormally do oh that is so well explained\nall right so that is\nso well explained because love bombing\nis such a big thing right now yes and I\ndid that in my teens massively like\nthat's how I spent the majority of my\nteens where I I would be interested in a\ngirl only to win her over to then\nRetreat as exactly like you said so I\ncan relate to that so deeply\nhow does and generally I don't know I've\nI've heard a lot of men admit to that or\nat least men that I have open\nrelationships with where people will say\nthat I don't know how much women do that\nlike I I just haven't heard that and I\ndon't want to build gender stereotypes\nor anything but I guess as the person in\nthe relationship on the receiving end of\nthat\nhow do you know because it's somewhat a\nmutual exchange right so I'll give an\nexample of what I mean and I want to\nunravel this with you because I think\nthat's very common the amount of friends\nI have that are girls recently that have\nsaid that's happened to them no numerous\nso what's happening is I'm trying to win\nyou over\nbut you're allowing me to win you over\nyou're also not doing the checking as to\nwhether I'm for real or questioning that\nno so I guess what I'm asking is if\nyou're on the receiving end of someone\nlove bombing you and trying to impress\nyou and trying to win you over what do\nyou do in order to make sure that you\nare actually taking things slower\nbecause what ends up happening is you\nfall in love too fast that person then\nwalks away and then you go oh but I\nthought we had something yeah so how do\nyou avoid that I think you have to be\nintentional with what you're looking for\nokay if I don't you know if I don't know\nyou I'm gonna love bomb you based off\nwhat I think your values are you know\nlet's say oh I think based on the fact\nthat she's wearing a pair of expensive\nshoes I need to seem like I have a lot\nof money so I'm going to pull out the\nRolex I'm gonna pull out the nice card\nthat's what I think matters to her I\ndon't know and maybe for her she you\nknow she's\nlooking for the spark you know which I\nthink is a whole other conversation in\nitself I think the best thing to do is\nabandon this idea of the spark and and\ninstead actually ask yourself what do\nyou want in a person so the activity\nthat that I required to do in my therapy\nwas I had to relive my entire love life\nI had to write it all down and then when\nI read it anytime I felt warm or I felt\nsome love I had to highlight it and\nthat's how I began to figure out what I\nspecifically want I think generically\neverybody kind of wants the same thing\nwell everyone goes like good looking\ngood sense of humor like everyone says\nthe same thing I literally went on the\nstreets a couple of weeks ago or a\ncouple maybe a month ago now and I was\nasking people what are the top three\nthings you're looking for look for\nsomeone and they were like a nice smile\ngood sense of humor and like I was like\nreally like literally everyone said the\nsame thing so yeah sorry carry on no no\ncompletely but and again I'm guilty of\nthat as well but the next question is\nyou're focused on the details and not\nthe feelings so the next question should\nbe\nwhat does a nice smile make you feel\nwhat do good looks make you feel what\ndoes knowing somebody is Rich make you\nfeel that's your that's your actual list\nthat's great you know no like oh I want\nhim to be rich why\nwell that's that's going to make me feel\nlike I'm secure you know let me feel I'm\ntaken care of so what you want is not\nsomeone who's rich you want someone that\nyou know what to take care of you now\nthere can be people who may not have the\njuiciest bank account but their energy\ntheir effort their determination you can\njust see it in their eyes you can see it\non their day-to-day activity you can\nalways put your money on that person\nthey're always going to show up that'll\ngive that'll that'll scratch that same\nitch and I think when we get very\nspecific with what we care about and and\nhow it makes us feel now that love\nbombing just won't work yeah you know\nbecause they're they're going based off\nof things that they think are kind of\ngeneric and as I said like we have this\ngeneric idea of what beauty is you know\nbut we beauty isn't that yeah you know\nfor some for one some person might be\nwatching me right now think I'm super\nhandsome somebody else may not and\nthat's completely okay everyone's\nallowed to have their own taste but the\nfeelings of what we're actually chasing\neven when we think about a person of the\npast an ex we don't miss them we miss\nthe way they made us feel we can carry\nthat feeling forward and require that as\nwe get to know somebody can you\nestablish all those feelings and and\nthose markers in a first date no and I\ndon't think you should you know I think\nit is important to be open to people\ngiven about give them that opportunity\nand see if they can elicit those\nfeelings and I don't think love bombing\nsomeone can be clever enough to love\nbomb you through those feelings yeah\nbecause love bombing is not going to tap\ninto a pathway of love it's going to tap\ninto this fast food version of it the\nattention the validation making you seem\nlike you matter\num you know I read one of these posts\nrecently that said listen stop bragging\nthat you were chosen over somebody else\nmost likely you were chosen because you\nhave less boundaries wow you know so\nthis isn't a brag worthy thing and again\nour media our songs all the things you\nknow making us seem like you know we\nshould be competing for each other all\nof this stuff it informs what we think\nmatters you know we have this idea of\nthe knight in shining armor and the\nDamsel in Distress like\nI went deep to try to figure out where\nthat that came from real life back in\nfeudal societies the only social\nMobility you know a man had to to\nincrease his chances of finding a a\npartner was to join the Army\num you know because if he grew up on a\nfarm you know there was an access to\neducation or anything he had to join the\nArmy potentially come back a hero and\nnow that he's a hero he will have more\nmore opportunities in an arranged\nmarriage society as well\nto choose from it so now it's like be\nchosen and be chased and I think that\nthat that dog and cat situation right\nnow is really making us focus on\nexternal things whereas if we are\ngrounded in who we are develop a\nhealthier relationship initially it's\ngoing to close us off to a lot of people\nwho aren't on this journey of\nself-awareness but in the long run it'll\nallow us to be that very minority now\nwho stay in healthy relationships\nthroughout their life wow man if you're\nlistening right now or watching I'm\ntalking to Humble the poet the book is\ncalled how to be loved uh by Humble poet\nsimple truths for going easier on\nyourself embracing imperfection and\nloving your way to a better life make\nsure you go and order a copy while\nyou're listening uh this conversation is\nblowing my mind it better be blowing\nyours too and I think there's just so\nmany you know huge insights that that\nI'm taking away from you listening to\nyou today\nbecause ultimately you're demanding a\nsense of vigilance from a person I think\nwe're all still living in that very\nbasic sense of I just want to be\nvalidated I want to be complimented I\nwant to be appreciated so as long as\nsomeone's doing that we must be in love\nthey must be kind they must be nice and\nthat's too shallow like it's too it's\nnot a healthy way of inferring whether\nsomeone feels good about you and it's\nfunny because it can be really\nintoxicating yes like it can be really\nintoxicating that you lose all sight of\nreality and you think well This Must Be\nLove or this must be the truth I guess\nhow do people slow down\nthe idea of falling in love when like\nyou said it's sold as so important and\nspecial\nand we're so desperate for it almost\nyeah right like we're wired to just want\nit now how do you kind of take your time\nas you're saying and I read a study that\nsaid it takes 200 hours to get to know\nsomeone\nand when I saw that number I thought\nwell how many people in my adult life\nhave I spent 200 hours with\nand I was thinking not many people have\nI spent 200 hours with I don't even\nthink we have 200 hours I don't think so\neither and so you know when you when you\nstart thinking about that you're like\nwow and and we're all trying to fall in\nlove in like two months I think the\nstudy said that men say I love you after\nlike three months and women take maybe\nfour to six months to say I love you but\nthat's quick yeah so how do you kind of\nslow this process down and what do you\ndo in that slowness because as me and\nyou know this isn't just about how many\nmonths you've been together yeah it's\nit's more than that completely I I think\nthe big realization that I have is\nchasing the delicious will will never\nbring you around the nutritious and I\nthink you know and that's really what\nthis is so when you when you say the you\nknow the validation is addicting it is\nit's it's salty french fries yeah and\nyou can't just have one but you you do\nthis long enough you're gonna feel like\ncrap you know and now if you've been\neating french fries all day and now\nsomeone goes here here's a plate full of\nbroccoli it's going to be an adjustment\nand and that's what I'm saying here you\nhave to establish a healthy relationship\nwith yourself or you will be incapable\nof having a healthy relationship with\nanybody else I had a friend yesterday\ntell me if I break up with my boyfriend\nand he doesn't call me nine times\npanicking then he doesn't love me\nbecause he's not fighting for me I was\nlike first off he's not fighting for you\nyou know the only reason he's calling\nyou nighttime because he is super\nanxious yeah that's he's trying to\nsuppress him anxiety there's not there's\nno love in this conversation at all and\nwhat we have to understand is we have\nagain the Bobbies and Whitney's the\nRoss's and Rachel's all of these things\nthat we see you know even including our\nparents you know our first models of\nLove were those who raised us and they\nwere imperfect beings you know and now\nwe often find ourselves attracted to\nwhat's familiar over what's actually\nhealthy you know and if your parents if\nyour mom or your father was hard to\nimpress you're going to find yourself\nbeing gravitated towards somebody who's\nhard to impress you know\nif you were a caregiver in the house and\nyou want someone that you can take care\nof and again it's building this\nawareness it's understanding that I can\nkeep doing this again I can keep eating\nfast food every single day and it'll\nfeel like sustenance but it will take a\ntoll on me and all of this stuff will\nexhaust us you know versus taking the\nlong route which is hey I need to\nestablish my relationship with myself I\nneed to actually have a clear definition\nof what I want in a partner and the\ndeeper I go with that the more unique it\nis I shouldn't be in a room full of five\npeople and we all have the exact same\nwish list for a dream partner it should\nbe very specific based off our\nexperiences based off what we care about\nand based off where we're headed in our\nlives one of the analogies I use\nespecially for my last relationship that\ndidn't work is I don't have a bad thing\nto say about that person but we weren't\ngoing where I needed to go in that\nrelationship and it's like if I got to\ngo to Boston and there's a beautiful\nprivate jet going to Hawaii I can't get\non that jet you know there's another\namazing limo going to Florida I can't\nget on that if the only the only vehicle\ngoing to Boston is a bike I have to get\non the bike but the first question is do\nI know where I'm going or where I want\nto go and I think for everybody right\nnow if you feel alone you cannot\nOutsource that you cannot address that\non the outside and now we do live in a\nworld where okay you make the decision\nto get someone else to make you feel\nless lonely you build a life together\nyou share a mortgage together you have a\nbunch of kids together and now you're\njust in that world and then you know\nyou're doing external things to medicate\nfrom that as well and the challenge with\nthat is as this Modern Life gets more\nand more convenient most of the things\nthat we use to medicate ourselves turn\ninto weapons against us as well you know\nit's a lot easier to get access to\nalcohol it's a lot easier to get access\nto any substances or junk food which are\nquick easy convenient and cheap so\ninstead let's focus on what's nutritious\nand we all everybody listening knows\nwhat's nutritious for them they know\nthat people when they're around that\nfill them up with energy instead of the\npeople that they're around that drain\nthem they know the places they know the\nactivities we're all aware of those it's\ntaking the long road because the long\nroute lasts longer you know it takes\nlonger to get there but it'll last\nlonger and these short bits of like I\njust need to feel like I matter to\nsomebody because my entire life I didn't\nfeel like it that has to get addressed\nand that has to get addressed through\nJournal writing potentially therapy\npotentially coaching but and all of that\nis getting us out of black and white\nthinking and encouraging us to be more\nself-aware what I'm hearing is like\nthere's a big difference between people\nthat feel good for us\nand then people that are good for us and\nwe're so addicted and obsessed with what\nfeels good that we're not able to focus\non what is good because we're almost\ncompelled\nto be like well this person feels great\nthey look great they sound great my\nfriends think they're great my parents\nthink they're awesome the world thinks\nreally highly of them they must be the\nright person rather than what you're\nsaying it and all I'm all I keep hearing\nand everything you're saying is like\nthere is just so much work to do\nindividually and personally and\nsimultaneously in being in a\nrelationship there's just so much\nreflection there's reflecting on the way\nyour parents loved you there's\nreflecting on your exes there's like\nwhich is what you've been doing through\nthis whole book journey there's\nreflecting on like how you got here\nthere's reflecting on where you're going\nlike there's just so much reflection and\nintrospection required and most people\njust want to throw the towel in because\nit's exhausting it can be hard but I\nguess what we both agree on is that it's\na lot harder to not do the work it's the\npain of the work or the pain of the\nregret you know it's one of the other\nand I think also you know the subtitle\nsays going easier on yourself\nlook nobody is weak you know if I open\nup a bag of salty potato chips and I\ngive you one and you want you're not\nweak from wanting another one you know\nand for people who eat really healthy\nthey understand that that's not having\nunhealthy food in the kitchen that's\nleaving it at the grocery store you know\nand you do that long enough you can\nstart to change your taste and you know\npersonal story you showed me your snack\ndrawer and you pointed to a bunch of\nthings that were delicious and after\ntrying I'm like oh this is all super\nhealthy it's definitely his definition\nof delicious is way healthier than mine\nis my wife yeah yeah and and I've seen\nthat before because we can actually\nchange our taste you know addiction we\nall have addictions you know and there's\nto go from a bad place to a better place\nwe have to travel through a worse place\nand the the multiple addictions we have\nwhether we're addicted to a person\nwhether we're addicted to social media\nall of it falls under the exact same\ncategory of unintended Rewards hmm I\nscroll through my phone see a bunch of\nstuff that makes me feel insecure see a\nbunch of news that heightens my anxiety\noh look a cute puppy uh it was all worth\nit you know that's no different than\ngambling on a slot machine you just keep\npulling it and then all of a sudden the\nreward comes that's no different than\nbeing in an abusive relationship the bad\ndays are really bad but the good days we\ndon't know when they're coming but they\nfeel euphoric and getting ourselves out\nof that I think is really important it's\nlike if I'm like oh I'm in the mood to\nhave to go to this fast food restaurant\nI'm I'm so in the mood I go I eat it how\nlong does the satisfaction from that\nactually last and also when things feel\ngood they're not you know our roller\ncoaster isn't going super high and super\nlow so it's hard to even pay attention\nto that how is you know we don't notice\nwhen we're not feeling anxiety because\nit's not a feeling yeah and I think we\nhave to really be mindful of that\nbecause we're not in a world that that\nis designed or encouraging us to make\nthese healthy decisions because this\nworld just needs us to to run on fumes\ncontribute to its economy work work work\nwork work keep up with everybody else if\nyou're sleepy have some caffeine if\nyou're too hyped up have a Xanax take\nthem both different times and it's like\njust contribute and being aware of\nourselves means we would find a lot of\nyou know we'll we'll realize and the\nreason the cover says how to be loved\nwith a D in parenthesis is the only way\nto realize love is to beat love is to\nrealize you are the source of love and\nwhen you're the source of love you're\nnot going to be going out and doing\nretail therapy when you're the source of\nlove you're not not going to be you know\ntraveling halfway across the city to\ntake an Instagram photo to count your\nlikes when you realize you're a source\nof love and that you can give it to\neverybody and it's a gift it's not a\nloan you're not giving it hoping it\ncomes back you're giving it because\nyou're overflowing with it the same way\nyou would give it to a baby it doesn't\nneed to be reciprocated the more we\nrealize that the less we need it from\nthe outside world and as I said nothing\nis designed around that we just have to\nagain keep this junk food out of our\nkitchen keep it out of our homes and not\nbe hard or critical on ourselves when\nwe falter or when we have a bad day the\nlast chapter of this book I specifically\nsay I am all I'm doing I Am Not a Love\nGuru I am I'm a kid who I am somebody\nwho's desperately trying to understand\nthis because I've made mistakes in my\nlife I'm the kid at the front of the\nclass taking notes and at the end of the\nday all I'm telling you is the\ndifference between\nfrench fries and broccoli and while I'm\ntelling you the difference I'm eating\nsome french fries and I'm eating some\nbroccoli you know yeah yeah and that's\nimportant I think and and for you and I\nwe both know this being in uh being\nembraced in the Wellness Community\nyou know over on this side of the ocean\neverything's very linear it's like hey I\nused to be really messed up and then I\nlearned all this stuff and now I'm\nawesome and for three payments of 1995\nyou could be awesome too and I think for\nguys like us we're more into cycle and\nlike hey I'm messed up I figured out\nwhat the problem was I learned some\nstuff I'm sharing what I'm learning\nstill struggling with stuff but I'm\ngoing to continue this journey and it's\njust like I'm gonna have my winter\nspring summer and fall yeah and that's\ngoing to be a constant thing and I'll be\nconstantly working on it join me on that\njourney and let's compare notes let's\ncompare best practices\num and let's realize that we're not\nalone because we're critical when we\nthink we're the only one unrelated to\nlove I remember finding you know finding\nan accountant\nand having so much anxiety because I was\nan artist for so long and didn't do any\ntaxes or anything you know he helped me\nout in an hour and he told someone that\nstory realizing that they had the same\nanxiety and told someone else and they\nhad that there's a lot of anxiety that\npeople have and they feel shame and\nguilt that they're the only ones going\nthrough it I think the more we reveal\nthis stuff the more we have these\nconversations openly you know it may not\nget us a lot of likes on Instagram\num and and it may scare away some people\nwho want who have an idea of who they\nthink we are and for me one of the\nbiggest lessons I learned in the last\nyear was more damaging than any\ncriticism I've ever received were the\ncompliments\nbecause the compliments put me in a cage\nit was one friend that said yo humble\nnothing ever bothers this guy this guy's\nalways cool he's always calm and then I\nwant to live up to that yeah and I\nalmost crumbled with that facade wow you\nknow and that became reputations\nthemselves can can become a prison so we\nneed to do our best to break out of\nthose knowing that half the time those\nreputations we create were there to\nprotect us and we don't realize now\nthey're imprisoning us I mean that's a\nwhole nother level of deep man like yeah\nno it's so true it's so true I you know\nI was just in the studio recording my\ncalm meditations and so we once a month\nI'm in the studio for like four or five\ndays a week four or five hours at a time\nto do a month of content for for my\ndaily meditations on calm and me and the\ncrew have a really good like uh banter\nyeah so there's a producer in the studio\nthere's a sound engineer in the studio\nand there's two sound Engineers uh\nremote but it's the same team we work\nwith every month and I've worked with\nthem for 12 months now nearly and\nit's we have such great Banton all we do\nis lay into each other we're joking\naround and then I'm teaching meditation\nat the same time and I kind of set that\nculture from the beginning where I was\njoking around with everyone messing\naround with everyone for that same\nreason that I don't want to be\nperceived as a guru and and I'll often\ngo out my way to talk about soccer or\nFIFA or whatever it may be just because\nand I love soccer on people like that's\na real genuine love for me but I'll do\nthat in order to get away from this kind\nof pedestal because what I've realized\nis everyone's a theist like everyone's\nlooking for God in their own way whether\nyour God is your football team or\nwhether your God is your favorite\nrestaurant or where your God is a person\nand so everyone's looking for God in\nsome way or the other and we keep\nprojecting god-like imagery onto people\nand then they let us down and everyone\nwill let you down there isn't anyone who\nlive up to that Godlike imagery\nand then we almost make it like it's a\nfault in them yeah as opposed to\nrealizing that it was a fault in a\nvision that that someone could be that\nway it's hard to feel that pressure on\nyourself\nlike what you're saying like if humble's\nalways the calm collected guy that's\nlike a god-like projection yeah none of\nus are always calm I'm definitely always\ncalm uh I'm definitely not always uh you\nknow thoughtful and reflective I can be\nirritated irritable and irritated\nuh so yeah I I love that idea of\nbreaking your own reputation for\nyourself and and I think just a reminder\nthat it will not disqualify you from\nlove\num there is a four minute compilation\nvideo on YouTube of Beyonce falling off\nstage and I challenge anyone to watch it\nand think if it changes their love for\nher in any capacity it doesn't\num if anything it increases it increases\nit and again going back to our our\nvillage small tribe days this was this\nis also a survival tactic it's you had\nto find the best hunter and start to\nemulate them and almost worship them\nbecause you would hunt like them and\nthat would be good for the whole tribe\nBut Not only would we start hunting like\nthem we would start dressing like them\nwalking like them talking like them you\nknow and that's built into our culture\nwhere it's like I love the way LeBron\nJames plays basketball I love the way\nSteph Curry plays basketball but now I'm\nalso going to drink whatever beverage he\ndrinks I'm also going to wear the shoes\nhe wears and then also they're\nencouraged to not film their practice\nand just let us see them become\nsuperhuman on stage in front of us we\ndon't watch them to be good we watch\nthem to get better so this also puts in\nthis message that Perfection is\nsomething that you want but again\nperfection\nis not real these people aren't perfect\nI'm not perfect you're not perfect and\nthat's important for us not to be\nperfect because that's the only way we\ncan actually be vulnerable and have\nthese meaningful connections and knowing\nyou know as and it's having these\nconversations especially having\nconversations with people who are on\nsocial media that\ndon't even have they're not even public\nfigures and they still refer to the\npeople like the people need the people\nwant to see where I'm going on vacation\nyou know like who is the people\nthe big and the big thing I've been\nthinking about you know recently is this\nconcept of again getting out of the\nblack and white thinking you know there\nare rewards and punishments society and\nsocial media and your friends groups\nwill reward certain behavior and it can\nbe subtle and you can see that your\nparents growing up they reward a certain\nBehavior we have to realize that not\nreceiving a reward is not the same as a\npunishment you know so when people say\nSociety expects me to be beautiful you\nmay be right I'm not going to argue with\nthat so I can't tell someone what\nsignals and cues they get but what I can\ntell you is if you decide not to play\nthe game you won't be punished if\nanything you'll be left alone you know\nif I don't play social media the way it\nneeds to get played I may not grow\nbut they're not going to blow up my\nphone you know and you know and and make\nit impossible for me to exist I just may\nnot get any more rewards and I think\nthat's important to understand that not\ngetting a reward is not a punishment\nlet's get out of that black and white\nthinking and then again we can be a\nlittle bit easier on ourselves a little\nbit more liberated because the\nmaintaining these expectations\nexpectations are going to only close\nmore Pathways to love expectations from\nother people expectations of ourselves\nwhat we have to do is just have\nintentions which is I want to get better\nevery day you know and that progress is\nsomething that we can celebrate each\nself-respect and we can also do that\nwith other people we can set intentions\nof what we want things to be and those\nintentions will also include our\nboundaries oh man so powerful I wanna I\nwanna talk about we've talked a lot\nabout like\nfinding love within yourself\nyou know being alone finding that inner\ngrowth that confidence we've talked a\nlot about meeting the right person how\ndo you know whether to figure out if\nsomeone's right for you knowing what you\nwant in someone\nI'm intrigued by you know when we have\nbeen in a relationship for a long time\nand you were in a long relationship that\ninspired you to write this book\nand you find as you said you're going\nthose separate ways like you want to go\nto Boston private jet going to Hawaii\nsometimes we spend longer in a\nrelationship trying to figure out\nwhether it's going to last then we do in\nactually building it making it last yeah\nso we're questioning a relationship for\nlonger than we're creating a\nrelationship\nso if someone's in that phase of their\nlife what are some of the things that\nyou thought about\nwhat are some of the things you\ndiscovered in the writing of this book\nthat you'd encourage them to reflect on\nor introspect on without playing the\nblame game Let's always focus on where\nwe can take responsibility because\nthat's where we'll have power in any\nsituation you know if somebody rear-ends\nmy car\nthat's not my fault but it's still my\nresponsibility I gotta go to the\nmechanic I got to go handle insurance\nand I think in our conflicts with people\nwe have to look at our responsibilities\nas well and I think that's super\nimportant in these situations when we\nlook at our responsibility what we can\nstart to focus on is love as the verb\nlove through service one of the simple\nthings that I realized was like okay\nwhen I feel enthusiastic about somebody\nI want to share my world with them that\ndoesn't build a connection as much as me\nenthusiastically diving into their world\nso true man yeah and this doesn't just\napply to romantic relationships this can\nbe you and your grandkid this can be you\nand your siblings this can be you and a\nco-worker you know these relationships\nis we make them about ourselves because\nwe want to find that value but we'll\ngain more value and build stronger\nconnections when we dive into the other\nperson's world and start to see that now\nfor some people communication I think\nyou know communication is key you know\neverything needs to be a conversation we\nneed to become more aware as a couple as\nwell about\nwhat we have expectations of because so\noften it's a template having a\nconversation with somebody yesterday\neven like the definition of things\nwhat's the definition of cheating\neveryone has different definitions you\nknow and if somebody's like okay well\nit's physical but then somebody else\nmight be emotional you know and that is\nsomething that you know these are\nuncomfortable conversations need to\nhappen for for folks like us we grew up\naround arranged marriages and I think\nthe one thing that I always thought was\ncool about arranged marriages is they\nask a lot of the inconvenient\nuncomfortable questions they ask those\nup from the jump you know family history\nmedical history finances all this type\nof stuff but I think all these\nuncomfortable conversations which we\nthink\nyou know we'll just kind of fall into\nplace uh Jordan Peterson talks about\nthis he goes have a definition of what a\nmade bed looks like have a definition of\nwhat you know the rules are at The\nBreakfast Table you know including\nyourself recognizing the micro issues\nthat can become bigger issues and you\naddress them you nip them at the butt\nyou know and I think those are really\ninteresting things to do\num I love the Shirley glass analogy too\nwhich is walls and windows which is when\nyou're in a romantic relationship with\nsomebody there's a window between you so\nfirst acknowledge there is a window so\nnow let's not look at that other person\nas our possession let's look at them as\nsomeone who's opened a window to us and\nwe have uh access to them and then we\nneed to create a wall around us because\nthe moment somebody outside gets a\nbetter view of what's happening on the\ninside that can be a really strong\ndefinition of infidelity you know\nwhether it's physical or not but I think\nthat's a really important thing to\nunderstand this is not your person this\nis somebody who's giving you access to\nthem and now you can continually\nstrengthen that relationship and I think\nthe other one is love is a game but the\ngoal of the game is not to win\nthe goal of the game is to keep it fun\nso everybody keeps wanting to play so\ntreat it like a game but treat it where\nthe goal is for every you want to keep\neverybody in the room wanting to play\nand I think that's important because\nwhen we get into battles or\ndisagreements the disagreements turn\ninto something else very quickly and\nthere's something called the The Bagel\nmethod or donut method depending on what\nyou like better yeah\nand you have the small circle and you\nhave the big circle whenever there's a\ndisagreement the small circle is where\nyou should identify and this is from The\ngodman Institute I'm not taking credit\nfor this one but the small circle is\nwhere you identify your non your actual\nnon-negotiables me and you're going to\ngo to dinner\nwhat are the actual non-negotiables\nyou're vegan that's an actual\nnon-negotiable now\nall the everything else becomes a lot\nclearer or there might be three four\nmore things that maybe had Mexican\nyesterday so today we're not we're not\ngoing for Mexican don't want to have\ncarbs so I don't want to do pasta or\nwhat have you\ndoing that for yourself first prepares\nyou to communicate to somebody else and\nI think that's really important so often\nwe expect people to just know us just\nunderstand us read our minds\nto all we've been talking about is\nself-awareness and it's an endless\nJourney we don't even know us I don't\nknow me how can I expect you to know me\nand then when you do know me through\nyour observations of me externally\nrecognize that you're on my team and\nyou're telling me these things for the\nbenefit of of us when there's a problem\nit should not be me versus the other\nperson it should be us versus the\nproblem and the big idea in explaining\nall of this is realizing that love is\nfuel not glue\nlove doesn't keep us together love is\nwhat we use to work at it and this\napplies to romantic relationships our\nrelationship with our co-workers our\nfriends our family we have to work at it\nwe sometimes feel like it's autopilot\nbecause especially\nI know brown boys and their moms we get\nthis unconditional love just for\nexisting that can't be what we're\nlooking for in our romantic\nrelationships there needs to be\nconditions and then we need to stay we\nneed to be on our toes putting in energy\nand effort you know and I think that's\nreally important where\nyou know back to what I've learned from\nyou through the Gita you were only\nentitled to the labor and that labor in\nitself should be the reward not the\noutcome of that labor and in these\nrelationships saying I\nI love you and I want to serve you and\nserving you is the point of review and\nthis is where the love is revealed you\nknow love is going back to the original\nyou don't win love you don't find love\nthe love is already there you're doing\nthe work so the analogy I like to use is\nlove is the breeze\nand the work that we're doing is to open\nour sails you know I struggled in my\nlast situation because I could not\nreceive love it wasn't that there wasn't\nlove there it was my inability to open\nmy sales because of the walls the lack\nof vulnerability my need to win in an\nargument my need to to be in control my\nsilly ideas there might be something\nbetter out there all these ideas I\nrealized that it was me I had my door\nclosed I had my sales closed to the\nbreeze that was always there when we do\nthat work and that by default will\ncreate a better relationship with\nourselves which will inform every single\nrelationship we have around us\nmasterclass man masterclass I want\neveryone to know uh when you open up\nthis book because you're going to order\nit straight off to this conversation if\nyou haven't already uh there are\nchapters in here that will blow your\nmind uh I want to share some of them\nwith you we've talked about a lot of\nthem today but there's a lot we have not\ntalked about so we have\nwe we discussed oh this one we did not\ntalk about love and ego won't hold hands\ndefinitely going to read that chapter uh\nchapter 18 Envy pulls us away from love\nuh definitely want you to go and check\nout that chapter uh this one is is one\nthat really struck out to me uh they can\nonly love us for yesterday uh love is\nsaying no there are some phenomenal\nchapters in this book uh I highly\nrecommend it the book is called how to\nbe loved\nuh simple truths for going easier on\nyourself embracing imperfection and\nloving your way to a better life humble\nthis has been I mean\nthat we should record our conversations\nmore often because I'm like this has\neven been one of those like it's been a\nreally fun like what I love doing with\nyou which we've done today which we do\nin real life all the time is we like\nreally unpack stuff yeah we kind of like\ncritically analyze stuff and we're kind\nof try and like break down as much as we\ncan to try and get to the core of what\nwe're talking about is there something\nthat I haven't asked you about today or\nthat you feel compelled to share with\nour community that's really on your\nheart that you want to uh pass forward I\nmean as we were reading all the chapters\nI want people to know every chapter is\nonly two pages that's why there's so\nmany chapters there's over 60 chapters\num and and the way we designed the book\nand I would love for you to do it you\ncan open to any page and you will find a\nquote that that stands out immediately\num that will give you that so what does\nit the more we keep our word and act on\nour commitments the more momentum we\ncreate and the better habits we can\nbuild and and that is talking about\nself-love so all it is is you can open\nthis book to any page you'll find\nsomething you love\num if you read that first chapter you\nknow you'll definitely be in tears as I\nwas in tears writing it and if you\nfinish this book you're going to walk\naway not considering love complicated\nyou know love is simple not easy I'm not\nsaying Love is Easy I'm saying love is\nsimple you
