    "transcript": "you cannot manifest things that are\ntotally out of your control manifesting\nis about becoming so empowered and so\nfull of self-belief that you make things\nhappen and in that it means that you\ncan't manifest things that have\nabsolutely nothing to do with you this\nisn't a game of luck the best-selling\nauthor and host the number one Health\nand Wellness podcast on purpose with Jay\nShetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nbecome happier healthier and more healed\nnow I love sitting down with a guest\nthat I've been chopping up with on\nmessages and getting to know and\nfollowing for some time and today's\nguess is someone that I've had a few\ninteractions with offline and I'm being\nhonest with you one of the sweetest\nwarmest kindest people that I've\nconnected with and when I first came\nacross her book and her work I was so\nhappy to see someone take this very big\nword take this very\nknown theme that we've kind of repeated\nover the years but then make it their\nown and really help us more deeply\nunderstand it unpack it and live it and\nI think that's the part that I'm most\nintrigued by is that I think this word's\nbeen thrown around for a long time and\nit's kind of been a bit ethereal and not\nas tangible and today's guest is someone\nwho I think is going to make it super\neasy super practical and super\napplicable for everyone who's listening\nand watching wherever you are in the\nworld I'm talking about Roxy nafusi the\nauthor of manifest seven steps to living\nyour best life if you don't already have\nthis book make sure you go and order a\ncopy right now we have the link uh in\nthe caption in all the details make sure\nyou go and grab a copy uh but Roxy I'm\nso excited to have you here today I've\ngenuinely loved whether it's been us\nemailing dming whatever it's been and\nit's so great to have you here finally\nso thanks for coming I am so excited\nI've been smiling throughout that whole\nintroduction and honestly I feel like\nI'm pinching myself so I have to tell\nyou at the beginning of this year on New\nYear's if I always do a vision board and\nI dream as big as possible and it was\nbefore the book had even been released\nand right in the middle I wrote Jay\nShetty really vague I was like I have to\nconnect with him obviously I wanted to\ngo on the podcast\num and it was like a huge dream for me\nso thank you so much for having me no of\ncourse and you have to say I want to see\nthat you've got to send that to me I\nwill I'll send you a picture yeah I love\nseeing people's vision boards I think\nit's such an important activity to\nmanifest yeah and I've done that in so\nmany ways when I first moved to LA as\nwell for me that was my kind of approach\nwhere I was like I need to know\nI want to connect with people I think I\ngenuinely connect with and I think\nthat's been a big part of my\nmanifestation is that it's always come\nfrom a really good intention it's come\nfrom a genuine place of I don't want\nsomething from someone I I want to\nconnect with them and I think we'll\nwe'll dive into that and we'll get into\nit but it's so awesome because I know\nyou were on the Today Show in New York\nuh you know in La it's it seems like\nyou're taking the book International\nwhich is which is amazing but I've loved\nseeing how you've been you know I've\nseen the Manifest events that you're\ndoing out in London as well and across\nthe UK like talk to me about I want to\nknow more about you and your journey\nwhen did you first start your spiritual\nself-discovery your personal Journey\nwhere did that begin so to kind of give\nyou some background before because I\nstarted when I was about 27 just about\nto turn 28 so I think it was probably my\nSaturn returns as well but up until then\nI was the opposite of spiritual\nI had been in an addiction to cocaine\nalcohol and cigarettes for almost 10\nyears and I was obviously suffering from\ndepression and it's one of those things\nwas the drugs causing the depression or\nthe depression fueling the drugs but it\nwas obviously a combination of both\num but even prior to that I had always\nbeen someone who was extremely negative\nI had more self-loathing than I could\never describe I truly hated who I was\num from my earliest years you know when\nI was growing up I was an Iraqi growing\nup in Oxford my name's Rowan the Iraqi\nwar broke out\num and you know there was this kind of\nmedia attack on Muslims and I grew up in\na very devout Muslim family\nand I was treated pretty horrifically at\nschool and I started to really reject\nwhere I was coming from and when you\nreject where you're coming from you are\njust rejecting yourself and who you are\nand I think that was stemming all this\nself-loathing and so when I was 12 I\ndecided to move schools\num after this incident where I'd been\nlocked in a phone box basically being\ncalled Saddam it was really I'd actually\nblocked out the memory for ages and I\ndecided to change my name from Rowan to\nRoxy\nand then it that kind of continued this\njourney of escaping for myself and who\nand who I was and it took me until this\nkind of major Rock Bottom in um May 2018\nwhen I'd been on a yoga teacher training\ncourse\nand I really thought this is going to\nchange my life I am going to you know do\n200 hours of yoga I'm meditating I've\ngot no access to these drugs and you\nknow all the cigarettes and everything\nthat I was using to escape\num and I felt that that was gonna be it\nand I remember there was a monk there\nand he read my poem and he said you've\ngot this Fork on your palm and you're\nhere to help lead\num with your wisdom and I was like okay\ngreat I'm gonna go home and be a yoga\nteacher and at the beginning of my\nclasses I will try and inspire people\nand that was kind of my goal then\nbut I got back to London and 24 hours\nlater a friend called me and she was\nlike do you want to come to this party\nand I was like yeah\nand within\nan hour of being with her I was back\ntaking drugs\nand I went on a 48-hour Bender basically\ndidn't go to bed\ndid some things I really regret and I\nwoke up feeling totally a rock bottom\nlike the shame the regret and I felt\nlike I was unchangeable I thought this\nis just who I am and I called my friend\nSophia and she is she is quite she is\nvery spiritual and I would say she's\nquite woo like she's quite out there and\nshe said oh you should listen to this\npodcast on manifesting and I thought oh\nokay well this is going to be something\nthat's really woo and out there but I'll\ngive it a listen because at this point\nI'll try anything\nand I listened to this podcast and I\nrealized that manifesting was all about\nself-worth\nand something in me just clicked you\nknow I think we all have those moments\nwhere we hear one thing and it kind of\njust changes everything and hearing\nabout manifesting was that Catalyst for\nmy change\nand from then I started immersing myself\nI would say it's like I brainwashed\nmyself with self-development in the best\nway I was listening to podcasts reading\nbooks like I love YouTube for\nmotivational videos\num and I was doing everything I could to\ntry and understand how to change my my\nmindset how to rewire my brain the way\nthat I was thinking the way I felt about\nmyself but all of it really was\nmanifestation so for me manifesting is\nthe umbrella and all of self-development\nand healing Falls underneath it wow I\nlove that definition and thank you for\ntelling us about your story a bit too\nlike how did you how did you first get\nintroduced to like cocaine and drugs and\nand all of that world because I totally\nunderstand what you're saying that you\nwere going through this bullying's an\nunderstatement because it it's it was a\nlot worse and it and it can be a lot\nworse but you're going through this kind\nof tension stress pressure that's coming\nfrom the outside because of where you're\nfrom and where your family's from and\nthings like that but then how did it go\nso far to that extreme where did you get\nintroduced to these things and how did\nthey become normality when I was at\nschool I remember trying it was called a\nwkd it was like yes\nand I remember trying it for the first\ntime and thinking gosh like something\nabout this feels quite good and I slowly\nslowly started drinking every now and\nthen it was not common like my mum\nobviously never like knew that I was\ndrinking you know she would be so upset\nif she did and but I was doing it kind\nof like casually and then when I left\nschool then I went to University I was\n18 and\nactually I've just remembered the first\ntime yeah I went to an after party and I\nremember taking cocaine for the first\ntime and just thinking it was great and\nI just loved it and\nas someone who had absolutely no\nconfidence what this drug was giving me\nwas this false confidence\nand so the youth started to become more\nregular but it I actually formed the\naddiction I would say really quite\nrapidly Because by the age of 22 I was\nin my first n a meeting I knew that\nsomething was not right that I was doing\nit to excess I would you know when I'd\nbe getting ready to go on a night out it\nwould be 4 P.M in the afternoon and I'd\nbe on my own taking having a line\nbecause it would give me this false\nconfidence as I was getting ready\nbut I obviously then didn't give up\nuntil I was 28 so there was this long\nperiod of time where I knew I had an\naddiction but trying to get out of it\nwas so so hard and the shame that comes\nwhen you're constantly trying to remove\nyourself from something is you know it\nis I did feel it was very traumatic time\neven now if I see people on TV doing\ndrugs or if I've been out and I see\npeople coming home from an after party I\nhave a physical response to it I feel so\nanxious\num so yeah it's it was a time yeah wow\nyeah I mean that dies in trauma that\njust disappears and yeah and just leaves\nyou and what you said earlier it can be\nso hard when manifesting in self-worth\nare so correlated yeah to manifest from\nthat kind of a place can be really\ndifficult because I'm guessing when\nyou're saying gee I don't feel confident\nand that's why I do this because it\nmakes me feel confident it means you're\ncoming from a place of I don't have\nself-worth but then to manifest I have\nto believe that there's more for me to\ndeserve and more for me to earn and more\nfor me to create and so\nlet's let's dive into that and keep kind\nof coming back to where you were too\nbecause\nhow did you learn to manifest for\nyourself from a place of a lack of\nconfidence and a lack of self-worth well\nfirstly now in reflection I was\nmanifesting but the wrong direction\nright so I was actually attracting I\nthink a lot of negativity to me and I\nwas constantly thinking you know I\nwasn't making any money like I had no\ncareer I was trying but at the last\nmoment they'd pull out or they wouldn't\nwant to work with me and I was for sure\nmanifesting that because I was kept\nsaying to myself I know it's not going\nto work I know this person's Gonna\nCancel I spent so much time on my own I\nwas so lonely like I truly know the\nmeaning of loneliness and it's like\ndeepest level\num but when I decided you know and I\ndiscovered manifesting and like you say\nI realized that it was so closely linked\nto self-worth\num how I started was to start my healing\njourney and I the first kind of\ntechnique I used was to fall asleep to\naffirmation playlists because I realized\nthat your subconscious was acceptable as\nyou're falling asleep\nbut there was but then there was an\nongoing journey and by the way I'm still\non it yeah of course like I'm still on\nthat self-worth Journey you know we\nspoke before you know there are still\nthings that are definitely kind of my\nblocks but I don't know if you had this\nand because I I said before I wish I was\nhere\nyou're not allowed to interview me today\nwe will save that for another time\ntoday's about you and your books yeah\nwhen I first\num heard about\nkind of self-development and I would\nlisten to speakers and people would say\noh it's a lifelong journey of healing I\nwas like what do you mean it's a\nlifelong journey that sounds hideous\nwhat's the point\nI was in this like\nself-development honeymoon so at the\nbeginning you know when you find healing\nand I've been in this real dark place\nand then I start to see changes I start\nto see the light I thought well this is\nit I'm Healed I'm never gonna feel bad\nagain like this is great and it's\nexactly like being in a relationship\nwhen you start I'm never going to argue\nwith this person we're going to be\ntogether forever and then you know time\ngoes on and you realize that's not the\ncase\nand now what I realize is that yes it is\na lifelong journey but with every single\nkind of layer you peel off you open up\nthis huge potential for growth and\nabundance and opportunity and you're\nconstantly up leveling so even when you\ntake a step back you're still never\ngoing back as far as you went and that\nfor me is really reassuring and I hope\nfor anyone listening who's also thinking\nwhat do you mean this is an ongoing\nJourney it's ongoing but in the best\npossible way yeah I I think it's\ninteresting when you say that because I\nthink\nI believe that everything's a lifelong\njourney there's literally nothing that\nyou could actually say has a beginning\nand an end because even when you look at\nsomething that you don't think grows\nanymore it is growing it's just growing\nslowly or it's growing differently or\nit's growing uniquely but everything's\neither growing or dying at any given\ntime and I think people forget that I\nlike the point you made that you can\nmanifest negatively and you can actually\nmanifest the other way can you give us\nan example of how we do that like how do\nwe almost manifest things not working\nout so I think like really simple\nexamples\nif you wake up on the wrong side of the\nbed you wake up in a really bad mood and\nthen you miss your train and you know\nyour meeting gets canceled and you stub\nyour toe or whatever it is we've all had\nthose experiences in those days where we\nkind of just operating at this low Vibe\nwe're in a bad mood and then that's\nwhat's happening but there's also I\nthink a deeper level where we you know\nso much is self-fulfilling prophecies so\nif we are constantly operating from this\nbelief system that we aren't worthy that\nwe aren't enough that we can't you know\nreceive abundance then we're going to\nchange the way that we interpret and the\nmeaning we attach to everything we\nexperience so we might have a\nconversation with someone which is a in\nin perspective someone else's\nperspective is just a like really normal\nconversation but to that person who's\ngot that low self-worth and and believes\neverybody's against them they might take\nthat conversation totally the wrong way\nand then sabotage the relationship and\nthen go see I told you I told you\nnobody's here for me or I told you I can\nyou know whatever it is and so I think\nin that sense we are absolutely\nmanifesting negativity into our lives\nbecause of how we're perceiving the\nworld through that lens of low\nself-worth or low self-esteem yeah no\nthat's such a great answer and I'm so\nglad you raised that point because\nI think people think they're like okay\nwell should I start manifesting should I\nnot does it work does it not and the\npoint is you're already doing it yes in\nin one way or another and I think a lot\nof people struggle with the idea of\nmanifesting for people who are kind of\nmore skeptical or cynical and things\nlike that and and you know you you said\nyou came from a non- kind of spiritual\nbackground too to some degree it sounds\nor not open to these ideas and and\nthat's the same with me if someone told\nme about manifesting years ago I would\nhave just been like that's weird like\nthat doesn't work it's just hard work\nit's just you've got to put in the time\nand now I realize\nI was subconsciously manifesting so many\nincredible things in my life not knowing\nthe term not knowing the process and\nthen I was like well actually if you\nknow the process you can use it better\nyes right like I think that's something\nthat we don't understand it's almost\nlike if everyone is listening or\nwatching if you think about something\nyou do actually ask your friends this\nask your friends what do I do well and\nwhatever answer they give you there\nmight be some things in that that\nsurprise you like your friends might say\noh you're actually a really good\ncommunicator and you're like thinking\nwell I never even knew that or your\nfriend's like oh you're really great at\nmediating between us when we're arguing\nand you didn't know that often when you\ndon't know you have a skill you actually\ndon't know how to use it well and that's\nwhat I find with manifesting whether\nyou're using manifestation to create\nnegativity in your life or positivity\nknowing how it works makes sense so how\ndid you start to piece together your you\nknow principles of manifestation how did\nyou start to gather and say this is an\nimportant part of the process I think by\nthe way I'll start by saying that\nthis conversation is so important these\nconversations and this one especially\nyou know so I'm so fortunate to have\nthis platform to talk about this and the\nreason it's so important to me is that\nbecause manifesting has become such a\ntrend I think it devalues it so much\nyeah and I'm so passionate about\nmanifesting that I I get almost a bit\nupset I'm like no it's so incredible\nit's such a full and fulfilling and\nmeaningful practice and within it there\nis science and philosophy and wisdom and\nI think it can get a bad rep you know\nfrom these like 30 second Tick Tock\nvideos which maybe just are me are\ngiving so many misconceptions around it\nbut this really is like it isn't woo it\nisn't mystical and actually my book in\nparticular is for the Skeptics so like\nanyone who's a skeptic I challenge them\nto pick up the book and not feel better\nabout their lives afterwards but how I\ncame up with the seven steps is honestly\na terrible story\nI love it that's great that's awesome I\num so when I had wolf I kind of really\nwas like I'm gonna who's my son I\nthought I'm gonna make this career for\nmyself in being of service to others\nothers I realized that that was my\npurpose it's what I'm here to do\num and so the first I did a workshop I\nused to watch like brene brown and I\njust love her and I and I saw her\num called courage on Netflix I was like\nI want to do that I want to be on stage\nI want to inspire people so I thought\nI'm just going to host my first workshop\nand it was a self-love workshop and 100\npeople came I couldn't believe it wow\nthat's amazing where did they come from\nI had a really small community on\nInstagram it was like I think like 20\n000 followers it was good but it was\nsmall and I was really connected to them\nbecause I'm very open and vulnerable and\nthey've kind of been on the journey with\nme and so I said like I'm gonna do this\nand anyway you know I can't imagine you\nknow what your first one was like but I\nremember just my legs like jelly before\nI stepped on stage but the moment I got\non that stage I was like this is what\nI'm here to do\num so I did that Workshop it went well\nand so I was like okay I'm gonna do\nanother one and so I said to my audience\nI said guys I've been following\nmanifestation I've been learning about\nit do you think I should do this and\nthis was Jan 2020. and they were like\nyeah\nso I was like no I have to do a workshop\nand manifestation how am I going to\nexplain this practice there is so much\nto it\nso I just thought right I'm gonna put it\nin a step-by-step process\nso I went on a walk and I got out the\nnotes on my phone and within five\nminutes I had my seven steps to\nmanifesting and I think it came so\ninstinctively to me but I made this\nclaim that I said everything you need to\nknow about manifestation is in these\nseven steps and then I panicked because\nI was like this is a big claim and what\nif people realize that things are not in\nthese seven steps and when I would\nlisten to people talk I was like on the\nedge of my seat thinking I hope there's\nnot something that's not in my seven\nsteps but I actually found everything\nslotted in to one of these steps yeah\num and 100 people came to that Workshop\nin Jan 2020 and then in the pandemic hit\nI took them online\n700 people were then on a webinar in Jan\n2021 and by Jan 2022 it was a Sunday\nTimes bestseller yeah so it was a really\nexciting journey and I still stand by\nthese seven steps I live and breathe\nthem they are so practical accessible\nand easy for anyone to follow yeah no\nthe reason I asked that was actually\nbecause when I looked through the seven\nsteps I really appreciated that you got\ninto things like uh my favorite ones and\nI want to talk about a few of these but\nmy favorite ones were step three align\nyour behavior uh step six is probably\nwithout my favorite one out of all the\nseven which is turn Envy into\ninspiration and even just the fact that\nyou were considering Envy when you talk\nabout manifestation I found that really\ninteresting I was like oh yeah I've\nnever heard someone to want\nmanifestation and go there and also\nyou know you obviously talk about\novercoming tests from the universe but\nit wasn't this it wasn't just about the\nuniverse there was just so many other\nelements to it so let's dive into a few\nof these because I think I want to give\npeople a sense of some of these steps\nand and we'll we'll dream and talk about\nit too but\nbefore we do that let's talk about some\nof the misconceptions you mentioned so\nwhat are some of the big misconceptions\nthat you are\nbreaking and debunking the myths of\nmanifesting in this book like what would\nyou say are your ones that stand out to\nyou so the first one is definitely that\nvision manifesting is visualization that\nyou can visualize your way to success or\nif you just think really hard about\nsomething or you have a positive mindset\nit'll come to you\num it's just simply not the case there's\nno such for hard work and you can think\nas hard as you want about something it\ndoesn't mean it's going to appear in\nyour hands because this isn't Magic okay\nI always say it feels magical like I\nfeel like this moment for me is magical\nlike this is incredible but it isn't I\nmade it happen you know I did manifest\nit through act taking action and\nfollowing the rest of the steps the\nother misconception I think is that it's\na ritual so I've done hundreds of\ninterviews on manifesting and in nearly\neveryone I'll get asked you know\num what can someone do every day to\nmanifest their partner as if there's one\nthing you can do like you can Journal\nbefore bed or you can do a visualization\nmeditation and\nwhat these are these are rituals that\nsupport your manifesting journey but\nmanifesting is the self-development\npractice you live and breathe it\neverything you do is part of your\nmanifestation practice like\nthe way you show up for yourself the\nboundaries you set the routines you have\nthe habits you have everything matters\nthese rituals are not manifestation\npractices they are just supporting the\nprocess\num and the other one is that you cannot\nmanifest things that are totally out of\nyour control so sometimes I get asked\nCan you manifest winning the lottery I'm\nlike no you can't because it's nothing\nto do with you yeah manifesting is about\nbecoming so empowered and so full of\nself-belief that you make things happen\nand in that it means that you can't\nmanifest things that have absolutely\nnothing to do with you this isn't a game\nof luck amazing I love those those are\nthree you could tell that you've spent a\nlot of time thinking about these because\nthose are three really great great\nanswers on some of the biggest\nchallenges with manifesting and I get\nasked all those questions all the time\ntoo yeah I'm happy that you've done all\nthe thinking in between for it uh being\nclear about our vision I think that's\nthe one that gets talked about the most\nwhen it comes to manifesting it was like\nbe really clear be really specific you\nhear the old examples of Jim Carrey\nwrote himself a 10 million dollar check\nand then you know then he got I think it\nwas Dumb and Dumber that he got a 10\nmillion dollar check for you hear those\nstories of people who are really clear\nlike specific about the amount specific\nabout the person specific talk to me\nabout your key tenets of being clear\nabout the vision and interestingly by\nthe way this is the shortest chapter in\nthe book yeah but it's the one that\npeople spend the most on yeah um but it\nof course is important I mean from a\nneuroscience point of view when we have\nthese really clear goals and when we do\nvisual rehearsal a lot we Prime the\nsubconscious parts of our brain to reach\nthat goal by filtering out unwanted\ninformation and seeking out\nopportunities that aligned with them\nso\nI like this step and\nfor its kind of ability to give us this\nkind of opportunity to actually figure\nout what it is we want from life like\nwho do we want to be what do we want our\nlives to look like but more importantly\nwhat do we want our lives to feel like\nyou know and I think that actually just\ngiving ourselves that space be really\nvulnerable and open and step back and go\ndo I want something different do I want\nto be in a totally different industry do\nI want a different kind of relationship\nyou know am I actually happy where I am\nnow or not so I think it's a really it's\nyou know creating a vision board I\nalways say which you know is just\ncreating a visual representation of what\nyou want your life to look like it's a\nreally sacred experience it's why I\nencourage people to put them away\num there's two camps on this some people\nlove having their vision boards out\nwhere you can see I think they should be\nput away because I think you have to be\nso vulnerable with your dreams you are\nnot going to be really honest about what\nyou want if you think your mom is going\nto walk in and see it on your wall or\nyour boyfriend's gonna see it on your\nscreensaver\num so having this kind of clarity\nforeign\nbravery and courage to actually be\nhonest about what you want is all really\nintegral to this step\num and I kind of practice a ritual that\nI like that supports this is a\nvisualization meditation for me I fall\nasleep every night to one every night\num but yeah it's it's a it's a really\nsimple first step and\nI just think it is about this kind of\nclarity for yourself yeah I think that's\na great answer I think so many times and\nthat's why I knew I wanted to talk to\nyou about manifesting because I feel so\noften in the manifestation World someone\nwill say yeah well pick your goal like\nwhat is it visualize it think and I'm\nlike well actually it's so much more\nabout what you said it's so much more\nabout who you want to be and how you\nwant to show up in the world and how you\nwant to feel because\nwhen you ask that question you then\nrealize oh wait a minute is that thing\ngonna make me feel that probably not and\nso I'm I'm gonna reflect on this back\nfor the audience with my journey and how\nit makes sense so when I was after I'd\nleft the monastery and I was working a\ncorporate job so that I could pay my\nbills and take care of everything around\n2015\nend of 2014 beginning of 2015 I felt\nlike that I felt\nI was doing good at a job that I didn't\nreally see a future in but I knew that\nmy purpose was to help people and serve\npeople and I was trying to do that on\nthe weekends and evenings but there was\nonly so many people I could connect with\nand there was only so many people I\ncould touch because I didn't have that\nmuch time and energy and there was a\npart of me that felt well I have to\nshare this with more people and so\nthat's when I started exactly what\nyou're saying where I started looking\ninto what will make me feel like I'm\nconnecting to people I've already helped\na few people very deeply what is it that\nI'm looking for I'd already worked and\ncoached a few people and gone all the\nway with them but I was like I want to\ntouch more people and I want to be able\nto reach people who their company can't\nafford this they're not doing this\nbecause they have to have a coach as a\nbusiness it's like this is for anyone\nand everyone on the planet who can\naccess it for free who's just like me as\nthe kid in London who grew up with no\naccess to any of this but got lucky that\nI met the monks how do I read to that\nperson and so I fully agree with you\nthat it was in that moment that I\ndecided what I wanted to feel and who I\nwanted to be even though I had no idea\nwhat it looked like so if you ask me to\ndescribe where I am today which is still\non the journey I would never have\ndescribed any of this in any specificity\nbecause I just didn't know and if\nanything my goal and my visualization\nwas far more basic and limited but it\nwas enough to get started does that feel\nFair yeah I love that and I think that's\nso important for people because one of\nmy most asked questions is what if I\ndon't know what I want and actually what\nyou're saying is hey I didn't know the\nexact things I wanted but I did know\nwhat I who I wanted to be and how I\nwanted to feel that is the best starting\nplace and I think so important for\nanyone listening it's also feeling\nreally lost and people often find this\npractice when they are feeling lost and\nwhen you are it is really hard to have\nthose specific goals yeah so you you\nknow I think that's just such an\nimportant example to share thank you\nyeah no no no it's just as soon as I\nheard you say that I was putting myself\nin this shoes and I I feel that I've\nnever I've actually never been specific\nabout\nnumbers things\nthose things have never been part of how\nI've manifested it I'm not saying that's\nbad too I'm saying that's not been my\nApproach and my Approach is constantly\nbeing how do I use the gifts I've been\ngiven in the service of others like\nthat's always been like the kind of\nintention but moving away from that we\nhave this idea of\nlike you're saying people are not always\nuh clear about their goals they're not\nalways clear about what they want but\nthen what usually hits is this fear and\nself-doubt and I remember going through\nthat as well so I want to ask an\ninteresting question about this when\nyou're thinking about fear and\nself-doubt I feel like this is the part\nwhere we spend a lot of time and most\npeople get stuck in fear and doubt that\nthey never start they never try\nsomething they never give it a go\nbecause they're worried about what their\nparents will think they're worried about\nwhat their family will think of them\nthey're worried about what their friends\nwill say\nwhen you think about figuring out what\nis the root of what we're really\nstruggling with in fear and doubt like\nif you really have to think about that\nand go what is that the core of why fear\nand doubt is such a hard thing to\novercome in the process of manifesting I\nalways take a breath when I think about\nfearing doubt because it's so\noverwhelming for so many of us and it\nwas the hardest chapter to write I\nbelieve that I believe that because how\ndo you even begin in one chapter to\ndescribe how to begin that healing\nJourney\nI think that you know we're born into\nthis world kind of full of confidence\nand self-love and you know I always look\nat Wolf and he comes home he's obsessed\nwith himself and I love it you know what\nI mean I mean he's adorable oh thank you\nfrom nurse you're like oh my God Mom\nlike you will never guess what I said to\nOliver today like you not got that kind\nof like self-consciousness he thinks he\nshould have everything he wants and\nrightly so I mean I am the biggest\npushover as well I'm like I'm definitely\nlike making that much worse but I love\nthat kind of like youthful confidence\nand belief that they are deserving of\neverything but what happens is life like\nlife happens to us and to varying\nextents we come to believe that we\naren't enough that we aren't good enough\nas we are and I mean my personal belief\naround this is that I think rarely do we\nactually get unconditional love from our\nparents and this isn't to blame our\nparents but the love we receive actually\nis very conditional it's if you are good\nif you behave I will love you if you\nmisbehave if you show anger if you are\nupset if you are crying I will punish\nyou and I will withdraw that love from\nyou\nand so of course we're forming these\nbeliefs so early on that we must mold\nourselves to please those around us our\nparents then our teachers and our peers\nand the people we grow up with and then\nour partners and so when you're\ncompounding those beliefs constantly\nthroughout our lives when we then have\nthis realization oh my gosh I have no\nself-worth anymore it's really there's a\nbig job ahead of you to start to undo\nall of that conditioning and come back\nto that bright\nconfident buoyance childlike self but I\nthink that the trick is just to begin is\nto begin with from a place of compassion\nwe can kind of Judge ourselves for\nhaving the fear and doubt in the first\nplace you know we can be like I wish I\nwasn't like this I wish I had more\nconfidence I wish this and I think even\nat that very first step it's being able\nto go hey I'm so sorry you know to you\nand your inner child I'm so sorry that\nyou don't feel like this yet what can we\ndo how can we heal this and then finding\nways that work for you to whether it's\nliterally reprogramming your neural\nPathways and reprogramming your belief\nsystem or\nI mean just it starts to come into\neverything that we're doing into to\nchanging how we feel about ourselves\num and for me it's the most been the\nmost profound Journey I've ever been on\nyou know for me to be able to sit here\nand say do you know what I really love\nwho I am is something I am so grateful\nfor and so grateful to manifestation for\num because I absolutely didn't think it\nwas possible like I know many people\nlistening or feel yeah we either put up\na facade of confidence or we hide our\ninsecurities or we try and find a way to\ndisguise\nthe anxiety that we feel about ourselves\nin order to cope with the world outside\nof us and I think for me\nI did that for many many years and\nwhen I started to feel like I wanted to\nwalk this path\nthe fear and doubt that came in was fear\nof failure there was a doubt around if I\nhad the skills or the ability\nand just overall I think my vision had\nshrunk and you're so right if someone\nasked me in my teens\nif this would have been possible I would\nhave said yes but if someone asked me my\ntwenties I would have said no and so\nit's really interesting to see that\nStark comparison if if you ask me as a\n15 year old if anything could be\npossible I would I would have been much\nmore broad-minded and at 24 I'd become\nmuch more small-minded because you start\nthinking as to what's real\nand what's possible and\nyou start also looking at the people\naround you and going well where have\nthey got to and and then you start kind\nof you know creating a little hierarchy\nyeah what we say the comparison the\ncomparison of where I am I love what\nyou're saying about getting back to that\nchildlike exuberance and Vibrance I\nthink that is the core I think that's a\ngreat answer because I feel like that\nnow too I'd say the happiest I think\nI feel now is that I think I still allow\nmyself to be a kid\nand that\na kid in thought\na kid in activity a kid in the idea of\nplay the idea of treating work and\nbusinesses play the idea of not taking\nit\ntoo overly seriously where it stops\nbeing an expression and starts to become\nyou know too structured and of course\nthere's there's times in which you have\nto be the opposite so I get that as well\nyou talk about self-care being a big\npart of that through that time when you\ntalk about self-care and self-love again\nwords that are so thrown around and just\nso overused that they've lost their\nvalue\nhow have you looked towards self-care\nand self-love through the process of\nfear and doubt and in a way that\nactually helps you through that\ntoughness so\nI started to realize early on that\nself-love was something that we could\nnurture in every decision we were making\nfrom the minute we wake up to the minute\nwe go to bed we have an opportunity to\neither boost our self-love and cultivate\nit all the opposite and so I started to\nbecome very Mindful and using a lot of\nself-awareness to really look at every\ndecision I was making\nwhat time I was waking up if I was\nsnoozing my alarm when I was saying no\nto things that I actually didn't want to\ndo and when I was just saying yes to\nplease others\num how I was eating how I was moving my\nbody and this kind of awareness started\nto change everything that I was doing\nand I realized that self-love was\nhonoring where I am today\nand where I wanted to be tomorrow\nand by that I mean that you know in\nmaking our decisions we need to be\nconsidering who we want to become where\nI wanted to be tomorrow what I wanted to\nmanifest you know who I wanted to become\nand if my decisions were aligned with\nthat but also making sure that my\ndecisions were honoring how I was\nfeeling each day and so having that\nability to kind of check in with myself\nso on days where I was feeling like\nsuperwoman you know when you wake up\nyou've got so much energy I knew on\nthose days I could really push myself\nharder at work I could you know go\nharder in the gym whatever it was and on\nthe days where I was waking up and I was\nbecause look life is still stressful you\nknow you're not going to learn to\nmanifest and everything is perfect but\non the days where I was waking up\nfeeling flat or lethargic or just a bit\ndown or sad\nhow could I honor that\nvia rest recharge\num getting an early night\nsaying no to social Arrangements because\nthat would cause me more stress or\nmaking sure I you know finish my to-do\nlist and so it was this constant balance\nof like checking in with how am I\nfeeling today emotionally physically\nmentally\nand\nwhere do I want to be tomorrow and what\nare my priorities for tomorrow and\nfinding that balance and that for me is\nself-love and then within that is\nself-care which is routines looking\nafter me like I have found I am someone\nthat\nyou know I I work very hard I'm very\nbusy\nbut I don't have like Boundless Energy I\nthink some people and Instagram probably\nI don't know if like I had a warped\nVision but I used to see people on\nInstagram that was so busy and they just\nseem to have all this energy for all the\ntime and I used to try and do that and I\nkept getting burnt out and ill and I\nwould get the flu and my back would\nspasm and I realized that my body just\ncan't handle that level of adrenaline\nand stress for long durations so for me\nself-love and self-care was going right\nI have to take breaks for\ndoing things that will really make my\nbody feel better that will calm down my\nnervous system meditation breath work\nice baths IV drips whatever it is for me\nthat really helps me and that's\nself-care yeah no I I love what you said\nthen I think the key word that that I\nwas taking away was priorities and\nprioritization I feel like that's one of\nthe challenges with not just manifesting\nbut life in general where it's like\nyou're saying if I have a sense of\npriorities and then I need to rest the\nnext day to get back to the priorities\nbut the problem is I think all of us\nhave a lot of priorities and we have a\nlot of things that we want to happen at\nthe same time and so it's like we want\nthe amazing career at the same time we\nwant the amazing social life at the same\ntime we want an incredible vacation at\nthe same time we want eight hours of\nsleep every night and it's like I don't\nknow anyone in the world like I you know\nwhen I met my wife and and even now in\nin my life like my purpose is my\npriority and my wife and my relationship\nwith there is a massive part of that but\nbut she knows that and and her purpose\nand her priority is her family and so we\nhave these what some people would think\nof as competing priorities and I don't\nsee them as competing I just see them as\npriorities that are different and she\nknows that if there's a weekend and she\nhas a choice to spend with her family or\nanyone else she'll choose her family and\nif I had the choice in a weekend to do\nmy purpose or anything else I would\nchoose my purpose that's just always the\nway it's going to be and I think what's\nreally interesting about that is when\npeople see amazing or exciting things\nhappening in your life it's like yeah\nbecause this is all I care about like I\ndon't I'm not prioritizing pretty much\nanything else and that's kind of like a\nscary mindset for people because people\nthat's an intimidating mindset a scary\nmindset because people go but I don't\nwant to live like that and the truth is\nyou don't have to live like that no one\ndoes\nbut I find that if you don't want to\nlive like that it's hard to create\nprogress in any area whether that's\nbeing a parent whether it's being a\npartner whether it's building a career\nwhatever it may be so how does\nmanifestation and priorities work\ntogether do you feel that people want to\nmanifest too many things are they too\ndifferent is it\ndo we need to be more focused how do you\nsee that when it comes to manifestation\nI think that you're right in that people\nkind of want to have it all at the same\ntime all together but something's got to\ngive we're not superhuman you know\nthere's only so much energy and time\nthat we have and I think that having\nthat Clarity on your purpose on your\npriorities\num is key it's also why doing something\nyou love is so important because if\npeople are going well I don't want to\nprioritize my work and have to give up\nmy social life you know or have to give\nup this it's probably because you're not\nreally that passionate about the work by\nthe way for some people they just want\nto have a job and that's totally fine\nwhich will pay them so that they can\nprioritize their social life that is a\ngood thing to know yes because then\nyou're not thinking right you know I\nneed to have a job that is this\nall-encompassing life purpose actually I\njust want to leave at five I don't want\nto stress\nactually that's pretty awesome you know\nbecause they want to prioritize other\nthings travel or whatever but I think\nit's also really important for people to\nknow that your priorities will change\nyou don't need to get intimidated by\nthis idea that you know if my priority\nnow is my career it has to be like that\nfor the rest of my life my priority this\nweek let's say right I'm here in America\nand I'm have these goals that I want to\nmanifest my priority right now is 100\ncommunicating my message and inspiring\nas many people as I want which means I\nhave not been out for dinner once right\nI'm not with my son right now that is my\nfocus I also know that as soon as I'm\nhome my priority is my son and I have to\ntake a step back from work to give that\nthe space it deserves and so I always\nsee your priority as being like your\nbest friend and what I mean is that you\nknow when you go to your best friend to\nanswer all your decisions so you'll go\nhey what should I eat tonight or should\nI break up with my partner or whatever\nyour priority is your decision maker\nit's your best friend so when you're\ntrying to make a decision of\nshould I go to this party or should I\nyou know let's say your priority is to\nfeel really energized and healthy should\nI eat this candy whatever it is your\npriority is that decision maker for you\nand that's really important with\nmanifestation because it's helping you\nto constantly align your behavior with\nwhere you want to go and who you want to\nbecome so having those priorities gives\nyou that focus it helps you to make\ndecisions but I think it's also really\nimportant to know that priorities are\nchanging like they will change day to\nday week to week\num and we should just be allowed to like\nget comfortable with that but know that\nthere needs to be some you can't\nprioritize Everything at Once yeah and\nI'm happy to hear that because I think\nsometimes people's vision boards or\nthey're manifesting is like every area\nat the same time and it can be\nchallenging but I wanted to ask you this\nand I feel like you're the perfect\nperson to ask this to\nthe idea of mom guilt with manifesting\nlike you're just talking about your son\nthere and like getting back to him and\nhe's young how old is he now three and a\nhalf yeah three and a half he's so young\nand it's like I'm sure you want to be\nback with him and I'm sure it's hard but\nyou also have this Mission and I feel\nlike that's it's such a wonderful thing\nto see someone trying to balance it and\ntrying to figure it out but I'm sure\nit's not easy and I'm sure you know I I\ngrew up with a Powerhouse mum who uh\nmade me breakfast and lunch and dinner\nevery day dropped me to school pick me\nback up did my homework with me and was\nthe breadwinner of the family wow yeah I\ndon't know how she did it and yeah she\nis a super one yeah she really is and\nit's unbelievable and you know I think\nI just wish she also found work that she\nloved she's good at and she's downgraded\nit but\nthere's a part of me that's also like\nwell if she loved her job too and it\nfulfilled her and she had time it would\nhave been amazing but having been the\nson of a a superwoman and seen an\nincredible mom and having such a great\nrole model in my life\nlike for you how do you balance do you\never experience mom guilt because you're\ntraveling you're on the road you're out\nthere\nand how do you manage it with but I'm\nalso manifesting the life I I want for\nmyself and my son like I just want to\nhear how that goes through in your head\ndo you know and I don't know if this is\ngoing to be a very popular answer but I\ndon't really experience mum girl I love\nthat how\num\nbecause I know I I really believe I'm a\nreally good mum and I believe I'm a good\nmom because I do give wolf unconditional\nlove and space to be whoever he wants to\nbe and as a parent that's all we can do\nis be as good as parents as we can be\nwe're not trying to be perfect parents\nlike I'm still\nI'm still Roxy I'm so many things I'm a\nmultifaceted human being a mom is one of\nthose I mean it of course is the most\nimportant thing but it's not all that I\nam and I know that I'm giving wolfy this\nunconditional love safety I'm trying to\ncreate you know a life not just for me\nbut for him as well and you know what he\nis the happiest little boy so I'm\nclearly doing something right and I'm\nvery lucky that Wade is an incredible\ndad I know that he you know wolf is\nnever apart from being in preschool he's\nnever with anyone other than Mia Wade so\nI know that he's like in safe hands and\nhe seems fine you know when I like\nhonestly before I was going to America\nso Wade's taken him to Australia for\nthree weeks\nand I did start feeling really panicky I\nwas feeling quite anxious like I can't\nbelieve I'm gonna leave him I'm not\ngoing to see him for three weeks like\nI'm missing this special time\nand you know I would say day to day I'm\nnot like a needy mom like I don't I'm\nnot like overly attached like in an\nunhealthy way because like you know wolf\nis not mine he's not my possession he's\nmy son I'm here to guide him\num but he's a very affectionate little\nboy just for context he's very\naffectionate loves cuddles loves kisses\nlike he's so cute anyway the day I was\nleaving he could obviously sense my\nneediness and anxiety and he refused to\nhug me I was like baby I'm not gonna see\nyou for three weeks and give your mommy\na hug he was just like it was almost\nlike he was like Mom you're making it\nmuch can you just back off and every\ntime I tried to FaceTime him for the\nlast two weeks he's like I am having too\nmuch fun like I'm fine and so he's happy\nI'm happy\num and at the end of the day\nI'm always going to be here for him and\nI'm thriving as much as I can he's\nthriving wherever he is and I think that\nI hope that in sharing that it will give\nother mums permission to be okay with\nnot feeling guilty because I almost\nthink that sometimes we have\nwe feel guilty if we don't feel guilty\nlike I felt that I thought is there\nsomething wrong with me that I don't\nhave this awful mom girl totally yeah I\nimagine that yeah but actually I'm\npleased that I don't and I hope that it\nwill encourage other mums to be okay\nwith prioritizing themselves you know\nour children are learning from what we\ndo not what we say and we know that and\nif we are showing them that we respect\nourselves that we honor ourselves that\nwe want the best for ourselves they are\ngoing to respond to that and learn from\nthat and it's a really important example\nto give yeah I think that's I love\nhearing that it's refreshing and\nthe part that I was extrapolating from\nthat was that it sounds like you've\ndefined\nat least internally what you believe it\nmeans to be a good mum for yourself for\nyou for Roxy who you are and if you have\nthat definition then you can live up to\nthat now I may have a definition of what\na good mum is and obviously I I I'm\nsaying this hypothetically but it's a if\nsomeone was to compare their definition\nto mine or mine to theirs or X to Y the\nproblem is\nyou can start adding a lot of pressure\nto your play and as you said often get\nthe pressure of well I have to be\neverything and and anything and when I\nwas reading your book you have this\nbeautiful uh dedication to Wolf which is\nfor my son wolf be whoever you want to\nbe and and I love that and I was\nthinking\nwhen you changed your name it sounds\nlike that was a moment where you were\nbecoming who you wanted to be how did\nyour parents respond to that like how\ndid they how did your family or extended\nfamily feel about you changing your name\nyou know I think I was so headstrong\neven as a child that my parent for me it\nwasn't like I was asking my parents I\nwas like this is what I'm doing and I\nhave to do it\num my I'm the youngest of four my\nbrothers and sisters just you know\nmocked me obviously that's what older\nbrother sisters do uh they thought it\nwas ridiculous that I was now Roxy and\nthey still don't call me Roxy they all\ncall me Rowan\num but I love that um but yeah they they\ndidn't try to stop me which I think was\nreally nice you know and I think that's\nimportant and I do feel like a Roxy and\nI love it when people say I love your\nname I'm like thank you I chose it but\nyeah why Roxy where did it come from oh\nI don't know I was with a friend and we\nwere like what should we what should we\nchoose and then it was that or rocky I'm\nglad I chose but we changed it to an ie\nbecause I didn't want to be like the\nsurf brand yeah the offense to the surf\nbrand but I wanted something unique yeah\nand I love I I think that's really\nimportant because so much of who we are\nis not chosen by us at the beginning of\nour lives\nand then it's important that we start\nchoosing so the beginning of your life\nso much is chosen for you and as we get\nolder\nwe only truly become who we are and who\nwe want to be if we start choosing that\nand choosing your name is is quite a big\nidentity shift it's not small yeah and\nchoosing it as a kid is really hard\nbecause like you said he could have\nended up as Rocky right yeah we should\nhave been here\ncan you imagine that it would have been\na very different life yeah isn't that\nweird yeah like if you and also I kind\nof for a time I felt you know in my line\nyour behavior I talk about kind of\nstepping into the character of yourself\nand I guess for some time Roxy gave me\nthis character of someone I wanted to be\nlike I wanted to be more confident I\nwanted to feel like I was included in\nschool and so it gave me this kind of\nspace to do that eventually it's just\nbecome who I am but you know there was\nalways in that time when I was in my\nteens it was like Roxy was the social me\nand Rowan was the me at home and I kind\nof liked that you know in a way but now\nit's merged into one for me my identity\nbecame class Rebel Class Clown you know\nthe bad the bad kid in school not\nimagine that it was really bad if you if\nyou speak to any of my friends from the\nage of 15 to 18 they would just be like\nthis is Jay's a totally different human\ntoday like not not in the sense of how I\nam with people just what I was into and\nthat was the part where I was struggling\nwhere in my heart I've always been the\nsame person I am today it's just I\ndidn't think that\nfor a long time I didn't believe that\nvulnerability was strength or I didn't\nfeel that love was good or that I didn't\nfeel that serving others was\naspirational because that wasn't\nrewarded around me so what was rewarded\naround me was who's a rebel who's a\nclown who's who can get away with stuff\nlike that was what was rewarded as or\npraised by your Social Circle and so\nthen I was just pretending to be someone\nthat I wasn't even though it felt so\nuncomfortable\nuh which when we come to aligning your\nbehavior I think that's half the issue\nwhere\nmy behavior when I was a teen was\naligned with a reality or a truth that I\nwould never have subscribed to like if\nyou said to me Jay this is what you're\nactually doing and I think we don't we\ndon't really look at what our Behavior\naligns with we kind of just go with it\nand we think it's us when you talk about\naligning your behavior where are the\ncommon mistakes that we make when\naligning our Behavior because and this\nis what I think ultimately goes back to\nthe first point you made\nwhere you said that we have to know who\nwe want to be and I think when we talk\nabout manifesting we don't I think\npeople talk about what their goal is\nyeah so someone wants to manifest making\na billion dollars right making this up\nsomeone's hypothetical example aligning\ntheir behavior means doing anything to\nbe able to make a billion dollars like\nyou're ready to do anything because the\ngoal wasn't set from a place of knowing\nwho you want to be so now it's about\ngetting something which means you're\npretty open to any Behavior yeah does\nthat make sense so talk to us about\ngoing back to who you want to be in\naligning your behavior with that I feel\nlike how does someone think about who\nthey want to be in a healthy way because\nI think Society is programmed us to say\nyou want to be a podcaster we want to be\nan author you want to be a billionaire\nlike the word that follows B is rarely\nwho that's what you want to do that's\nnot who you want to be so true so true\nyeah and I guess it is you know it's\nabout with who you want to be it's\nfor me that means kind of\nhow you want to show up to the world\nwhat values are important to you what\nrelationships you have\num how you want to feel within yourself\nhow much Integrity you have\num for me for example I really wanted to\nbe someone who was really confident in\nthemselves and confident in being a kind\nperson so it's really interesting that\nyou touched on that but being kind\nwasn't cool right at school the people\nthat were cool were the ones who were a\nbit nasty who mocked other people even\nwhen we would watch TV shows you know\nall the cool kids were kind of the mean\nones and even like if you would look at\nlike in the pr and fashion world like\nthe mean people were kind of glamorized\nand I've always been quite a gentle I\nthink really nice person and that was\nsomething that I used to be quite\nashamed of in a way and I used to think\nthat people would just look down on me\nbecause of that quality\nand so for me I wanted to be able to\njust really be authentic in my kindness\nand go hey I actually really like that\nI'm sweet to people and I'm not going to\njudge myself for it I want to be someone\nthat thrives in it that loves myself for\nthat quality and I know that the right\ntribe will come to me for that\nand I think it comes back to this point\nyou made earlier about\nwhen you were talking about fear and\ndoubt you said you know there is so much\nworry about external validation and in\nthe manifesting process one really\nimportant thing is that you have to be\nable to let go of the need for approval\nfrom others energy is directional you\ncannot be constantly focusing on what\nother people want from you while\nsimultaneously focusing on who you want\nto become you can't go both ways and I\ndescribe it like this I actually\ndescribe it like this in my next book\nbut\nimagine you're running a race and you\nwant to get to the Finish Line if you're\nrunning this race and you're looking\nover at the person next to you to see\nhow far they're going or you want to see\nif they're looking at you you're going\nto trip and fall\nyou have to stay completely razor sharp\nwith razor sharp focus on your own lane\non your own Journey on your own\nalignment on who you want to be and for\nthat we have to be able to live\nknowing that and being okay with the\nfact that not everybody is going to like\nus it has been the most liberating thing\nfor me to understand that I don't need\nto be liked by everyone you know as I'm\ngrowing and spreading my message some\npeople are gonna love me others are\ngoing to find me really annoying they're\nnot gonna like what I say they're not\ngonna like how I say it and that is okay\nand one thing that helped me be okay\nwith it and I hope will help some\nlisteners be okay with it is that nobody\non Earth is universally liked when I\nrealize that everything changed if I\nlook at my best friends uh people I\nInspire that inspire me in the media\ncelebrities I love as many people love\nthem there are others who can't stand\nthem absolutely and that was really\nreassuring for me I was like hey these\npeople that I love have people that\ndon't like them and hey it's the same\nfor me as well and that\nlet it like it Set Me Free it Set Me\nFree and it gave me the space to be\nmyself and in that I was able to let go\nof this need for external validation and\nthis constant desire to be what other\npeople wanted me to be and actually just\nbe who I am and as soon as I did that\neverything started aligning the universe\nthat is supporting me and\nI felt like you know I said in the\nbeginning this isn't Magic but it feels\nmagical I feel like my life is magical\nbecause not because there aren't\nstresses that I have to overcome but but\nbecause I'm living in true alignment\nwith who I am yeah I I love that phrase\nof it's not magic but it feels magical\nbecause\nI think that's the issue with\nmanifestation that's always been\npresented is magical and\nin that way\nand like you're saying that the actual\nmethod is not magical the method is\nstructured and there's a process and\nthere's a system and then the result is\nmagical and and that really aligns with\nme I I really really\nI've never heard anyone say that before\nand I really love that like it really\nresonates and and I can say the same for\nme like I feel like I live a miracle\nevery day but I know the process isn't\nthat and I want to talk a bit about that\nthat part of aligning the behavior\nis getting good at doing things when you\ndon't want to do them I'm getting good\nat things that you may not have wanted\nto get good at like I think people feel\nthat people who manifest their ideal\nlife they wake up and they do only what\nthey want for 24 hours in a day I don't\nthink that's fully true and I think I\nfelt misled for a long time where I was\nlike yeah I love what I do and I\nrealized I do love what I do but I also\ndo a lot of what I don't love doing in\norder to do more of what I love to do\nand and I feel like that's where a lot\nof people leave the journey because you\nstart doing what you love so I started\nmaking content which I loved and sharing\nthis message and speaking on stages and\nthen all of a sudden I had to think\nabout building teams and organizing and\ngrowing which wasn't stuff that I would\nsay I love doing compared to doing this\nbut I had to learn that in order to\nserve the greater Mission and I realized\nif I have to learn something in order to\nserve my mission in manifesting\nthen that's part of the manifesting that\nisn't excluded because I don't enjoy it\ndoes yeah where does that sit with you\non 100 and it's why because being clear\nand your vision is so important yeah\nbecause it's giving you that reason that\nwhy why you're doing the things that you\ndon't enjoy necessarily or that aren't\nyour favorite part of the process but\nyou're doing them anyway because of this\ngreater thing and you know I think that\nwe kind of I don't know if you agree but\nthere is an aversion to discomfort like\nwe are always trying to like avoid\nnot always and not everyone but we can\ntry to avoid things that feel\nuncomfortable hard work things that we\ndon't want to do because our brain is\nalways trying to keep us like as safe\nand happy as possible and it's also you\nknow a lot of that is also coming from a\nplace of fear as well like that can't go\nunsaid but and I know this kind of\nphrase is some people don't like it but\nI do believe that part of self-love is\nself-discipline it's be a there's a you\nknow there's a fine line between\ngiving yourself compassion and space to\nlike be gentle with yourself and give\nyourself space to like experience the\nwhole spectrum of emotions then\nsometimes we do need to just go hey you\nneed to finish doing your account even\nthough it's really boring and even\nthough it makes you feel like your\nbrain's going to explode but you need to\ndo them because it's part of this\ngreater picture and it's going to get\nyou closer to where you want to go and\nit's also the same with any time you\nhave an opportunity to step outside your\ncomfort zone you know to take risks to\ndo things despite the fear of being\nrejected or the fear of failure or\nwhatever it is and the more that we can\nwe train our brain to find\nthis motivation and commitment to going\nbeyond what we feel is comfortable you\nknow that's where we see the real growth\num I always say like there's a great\nquote which is nothing changes if\nnothing changes but I also love you know\nI say in my book is if you want to see\nand create change in your life you have\nto be the change like you are the\ndriving force behind everything you talk\nabout Envy in your book and I find Envy\nfascinating because The Vedas talk a lot\nabout it which are the books I studied\nas a monk I've I've found Envy to be one\nof the most interesting emotions it's\nit's fascinating as an emotion to me to\nhave to figure out where is it coming\nfrom what's it doing and you talk about\nin the book how you turn Envy into\ninspirational or that's what you\nrecommend in manifesting\nwhat is Envia representation of for you\nand and how have you made sense of it\nwhen you talk about turning into\ninspiration yeah so I think this is a\nreally important important step for all\nof us so Envy comes from this scarcity\nmindset that there's not enough to go\naround so if you have something it's\npotentially less for me and it's coming\nfrom this place of fear so I always say\nEnvy is fearing doubt in disguise\nwhat often happens is that we are\nconstantly trying to deny ourselves of\nour Envy we don't want to admit when\nwe're feeling it whenever I'm in a\nworkshop and I talk about Envy\nyou could hear a pin drop because nobody\nwants to like give away that they've\never felt Envy before you know there's\nso much shame around it you know it's\ndefinitely you know look at the Disney\nfilm that's like the green eyed monster\nyou know they're always the villains are\nthe envious ones\nand when we don't\nkind of admit our Envy we pass it on\noften as judgment or criticism of others\nso true so we see a confident person\nwalk through the door and we go oh\nthey're so full of themselves\nor we see a couple kind of you know\nkissing on the street oh get a room\nwe're constantly passing this judgment\nof other people and I think that it's\njust Envy coming out and so at the very\nfirst step what I really encourage\npeople to do is just start to take\nownership of it look out for any time\nyou're judging or criticizing others and\nseeing is this really a sign that I'm\nfeeling envious of something that they\nhave or something that they're doing\nalso when you know you know we there are\ntimes where the Envy is just blatant\nlike your friend gets a job promotion\nand you wanted that job promotion or you\nknow if you see someone getting engaged\nand you're really you know waiting for\nyour partner to propose then it's more\nobvious but either way when we notice\nthat Envy or we you know realize that\nwe've been judging someone and we've\nbeen disguising it yes I am feeling\nenvious that's okay there's nothing\nwrong with that it's not making me a bad\nperson but what is this showing me it's\nshowing me that something still needs\nhealing within me whether that's an\ninsecurity or just a real doubt that\nthere is enough for everybody to go\naround\nto then take it further we can turn that\nand transform it into inspiration\ninspiration is the antithesis of Envy it\nsays that there is enough for us all it\ncomes from a really abundant mindset\nwhat you have something and I can have\nit too and I truly believe there is an\nabundant of Love success happiness and\nmoney in the universe for us all\nand so what I encourage people to to do\nconstantly is try to get into this habit\nof turning that envious thought of\nfeeling first by owning it and being\ncompassionate around it and then\ntransforming it into inspiration so for\nexample if you see someone getting\nmarried and you're going oh my God\neverybody's getting married around me\nI'm so jealous you can transform it to\nisn't this another beautiful\nrepresentation of love I can't wait to\nhave that for myself when the time is\nright so we always have this opportunity\nto transform this very low vibrational\nfeeling of envy and turn it into\nsomething that is high vibrational that\nis more empowering that feels better and\nit's why you know supporting each other\ncelebrating each other is so important\nthat's awesome I'm so glad we talked\nabout that because\nyeah I find that Envy can also be the\nbiggest block to manifesting because if\nyou ultimately after doing all these\nsteps at step six are feeling envious of\nothers it it just takes all of that high\nvibrational energy back to low\nvibrational energy and it's Envy's one\nof those like\nI know there's there's all these new\nthoughts about you know Envy's a sign of\nwhat you really want and things like\nthat I'm I'm not fully in agreement of\nthat like I don't I don't think that I\noften think that our Envy just exists\nmuch more broadly uh if you have narrow\nEnvy in an industry or space you're\nprobably luckier generally we can feel\nenvious of lots of different people for\nlots of different things because we\ndon't know our own values when you know\nyour values you'll only be envious of\npeople in your value space and that's\nhelpful as a start but you're so right\nthat yeah if you if you find yourself\nfalling into the Envy it's not even what\nyou share with others it's holding that\nbitterness within your own heart and\nmind horrible it's horrible like it's\njust it's just so polluting and letting\ngo of it and for me what's really helped\nis again again getting really clear on\nwhat you said that if I'm doing my thing\nit really doesn't matter what anyone\nelse is doing and it won't have that\nsomeone else's moves don't influence\nmine and someone else's wins and losses\ndon't influence your mind and I think\nit's also this is what I wanted to get\nto it's also the other way around\nsometimes Envy is you can't enjoy\nsomeone else's wins but sometimes Envy\nis you deeply enjoy someone's losses\nyeah so when someone loses you take joy\nin it and someone wins you don't care\nbut when you take joy in someone's loss\nI I see this in the news every day like\nwhen people get divorced and we're like\noh we knew they'd get divorced we told\nyou so uh someone loses a game and we're\nlike oh you're the worst player of all\ntime like we take so much joy in other\npeople's loss or in other people's\nfailure or supposed failure and we don't\nrealize that when that same thing\nhappens to us we're gonna treat\nourselves the same way now God forbid\nyou go through something similar that\nyou condemned online you're going to\ncondemn yourself through that whole\nprocess rather than giving yourself\ncompassion in space it's so true I I\nsimilarly I always say that every time\nyou're judging someone else you are like\ncompounding and building this fear that\nother people are judging you yeah and\nthat you will then judge yourself more\nso actually the less we do it for other\npeople the less we find joy in other\npeople's losses and the less we find\nourselves judging and criticizing others\nactually the less we'll do it to\nourselves or fear that other people will\ndo it to us as well so I think it's a\nreally really important one to talk\nabout and I think you know\npersonally it's something that's really\nempowered me to manifest because like\nyou say of course it's a big block\nbecause if I was you know when my book\ncame out I'm going into this you know\ninto having a career in the self-help\nyou know industry let's call it if I was\nthinking oh my gosh no there's so many\nsuccesses the Jay Shetty is like he's\ngot millions of followers and I'm never\ngoing to be that big and if I started\nhaving that I would be totally blocking\nmyself right but we're all on the same\nMission we are all here to help people\nand inspire people and for every coach\nhealer author out there there are\nthousands of people wanting to learn yes\nand who listens and hears my message and\ntakes it in yeah is supposed to be in my\ntribe but I'm like I said I'm not for\neveryone and so for other people they'll\nhear you speak and that will resonate\nway more with them or they'll hear\nanother coach speak or another speaker\nanother author and that's great yeah\nbecause we're all we're all on the same\nMission and that's an abundant mindset\nand that's why I can look at you and\nbrene brown and Tony robbers and anyone\nin this world and go that is so\ninspiring I love seeing people help\nother people yeah exactly and I think\nyou identified it perfectly there it's\nthe real question is\nare we here for the healing are we here\nfor us and and that's really the\nquestion and if you're really in it for\nthe healing then anyone who's a Healer\nyou'll appreciate them even if their\nhealing style is different but that sign\nthat sign is so clear when you're like\noh yeah I don't like the way they're\ndoing it don't like the way I don't\nagree with them or they're not and\nthat's it just creates fractions and\nfractures internally as well so I'm so\nglad you brought that up too it's\nbeautiful and I think as you were\ntalking I was piecing a thought together\nand it's this idea of how Comfort\ncreates self-care\nbut discomfort creates self-respect\nI love that yeah and it just hit me\nwhile you were talking\nand I was thinking that\ndiscomfort has actually brought me so\nmuch more\nthan comfort and now I appreciate\ncomfort more because I know I can get\ninto discomfort when I need to and so\nthe self-respect that comes from\ndiscomfort\ncreate such a confidence and a Swagger\nand an energy that then you cradle with\nComfort when you need to yeah as opposed\nto when you've only cuddled and\ncomforted the whole time it's really\nhard to then have that feeling of\nself-respect so every time I go through\nsomething tough I'm like God I did that\nlike every time I break through\nsomething I'm like I can do hard things\nlike I can do really tough stuff and\nthat builds self-respect and\nself-respect is what I need in order to\nfunction in life to build self-worth in\norder to have self-belief does that yeah\noh I love that I love that and I think\nyou're absolutely right I mean there's\nno better feeling than doing something\nthat you thought you couldn't or being\nable to have that mindset you know even\nlittle things like little things like\nfor me in my ice bath yesterday six\nminutes I was like this is so hard\nyeah I was like I'm so cold ah and I\njust like tapped into that kind of\nmental strength I was like discomfort is\nokay and afterwards I felt so proud of\nmyself and it's quite similar to\nself-trust I always say like follow\nthrough with things that you say you're\ngonna do because that builds self-trust\nwhich again impacts that self-worth that\nself-esteem that self-confidence you\nknow the every time we say to ourselves\nI'm not gonna drink tonight and then you\ngo out and drink you're losing that\nself-trust or when you say I'm gonna\nfinish that you know assignment today\nand then you don't you're losing that\nself-trust but when you actually do\nthings like you know push through\ndiscomfort or you follow through with\nthings that you get you say you're going\nto do you're building self-discipline\nself-respect self-trust and all these\nthings combined is what is making you\nfeel more empowered more confident and\nin that empowerment you take steps that\nyou never thought were possible to live\na dream that you feel so proud of yeah\nabsolutely and it's doing what what's\nreally hitting me right now with with\nwhat you're saying is that it's doing\nhard things that are meaningful to you\nthe challenges a lot of us are doing\nhard things that are not meaningful for\nus so when you break through something\nhard that's not meaningful to you it\ndoesn't feel great and so I do believe\npeople are doing hard things every day I\ndo believe people are working hard every\nday I do believe that people are\nstruggling every day but often it's\ntowards something that isn't important\nto them and so if we can find a way to\ndo hard things that are meaningful to us\nthat can unlock a whole new mindset and\ntotally make it easy to manifest yeah\nBrett's I was talking to someone about\nit yesterday there is this kind of\nfeeling there that life is hard and it\nshould be hard but in the wrong ways yes\nright you know whereas this is like what\nwe're talking about something very\ndifferent it's a like and I just really\nresonated with that that it is about\nworking hard for these things are\nmeaningful yeah well it's what you said\nearlier and I love that that's where you\nstart with just being clear about your\nvalues and knowing what you want and not\nwanting something because someone else\nthinks it's cool like I do think that\nthere are there's a mindset in the world\nwhere it's like it's cool not to care\nand then right and then there's a\nmindset the other way where it's like\nit's cool to really care it's like and\nit's like both are fine but just choose\nwhich one you want to be like you know\nit doesn't like some people like oh it's\ncool not to care about what you wear\nyeah and some people like no it's cool\nto care about you what you wear neither\nis right or wrong yeah but most of us\nsubscribe to one because of what people\naround us think as opposed to that's how\nI want to be yeah and and I think that\nthat's the freeing element of all of\nthis it's like how many decisions can\nyou make in your day that were made\nbecause they were decisions you wanted\nto make not because someone wanted you\nto make them not because someone forced\nor influenced you but that you knew they\nwere right for you that that's really\nwhat we're talking about absolutely so I\ncouldn't agree more yeah yeah Roxy it\nhas been so fun talking to you you uh\nare you're definitely a kind warm\nwonderful person in person too so and\nthat we both found the courage to become\nourselves in public because when you\nsaid that too I can resonate with that\nso deeply where even for years I was\njust like yeah I you know you have to\nkind of play this role that you don't\nwant to play and I'm so glad I let go of\nthat I'm so glad you did too yeah but\nfor everyone who's been listening I want\nyou to go out and grab a copy of\nmanifest seven steps to living your best\nlife by Roxanna fousey please do not uh\nmiss out on grabbing this book the seven\nsteps we talked about a few of my\nfavorite ones today there's so many more\nand I'm hoping Roxy will come back uh\nfor her next book uh but please do grab\nthis please do use it use it practically\nuse it as a workbook not just a reading\nbook uh because that's what it's built\nto do and Roxy we end every on-purpose\nepisode with a final five yeah uh so I\nhope you haven't been practicing too\nmuch no I haven't I've Just In This\nMoment yeah you did did you do the first\nfilm with Alex Cooper no no we've done\nfinal five forever but that I'm gonna do\nit\nwhat was the thing okay good all right\nso Roxy these are your final five\nquestion number one what is the best\nmanifestation advice you've ever\nreceived or heard that we manifest what\nwe subconsciously believe we are worthy\nof receiving hmm great answer all right\nsecond question what is the worst\nmanifesting advice you've ever heard or\nreceived that if you think about\nsomething hard enough it will appear for\nyou number three is how would you define\nyour current purpose to help and Inspire\nothers to find The Light Within them\nbeautiful I love that uh so clear all\nthese answers\nuh question number four is I love that\nyou talked about keeping your uh vision\nboard like private and sacred and like\nmore internal like where do you keep it\ndo you do it on a on a board a pad a\njournal like what's what's your way I\nhave the most basic vision board like\nyou have ever seen for someone that\ntalks so much about manifesting is\nactually quite embarrassing I have\nreally terrible handwriting firstly I'll\nsay you'll see on your side book but um\nI get like an A4 piece of card and I\nwrite in felt it brilliant I love it and\nthat's it y'all show you because I'm\ngonna send you a picture it's just felt\ntip pen bullet points of everything I'm\nnot a very visual person in terms of\nlike I don't like using the magazines\nand stuff like that it's just bullet\npoints to the point all the words all\nthe things I want I kind of put some\nheaders on it that's it and then I tuck\nit on the floor under my wardrobe I love\nit that's brilliant that's fantastic\nthat's great uh Fifth and final question\nif you could create one law in the world\nthat everyone had to follow what would\nit be I would love if there was a ban on\nbitching about other people like I just\nthink it's so toxic for ourselves\nbecause if there wasn't that we wouldn't\nhave this constant fear of what other\npeople think and then we would all be\nliving in alignment so yeah that's a\ngreat answer yeah if we had the ability\nto evaluate and assess what people were\ndoing and saying as opposed to yeah\ndirectly going into that negativity yeah\nyeah I love that uh ever on the book\nagain it's called manifest seven steps\nto living your best life uh make sure\nyou go and order your coffee now
