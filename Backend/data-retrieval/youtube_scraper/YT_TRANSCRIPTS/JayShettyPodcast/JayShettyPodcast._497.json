    "transcript": "maybe you're not brought out because\nyou're doing too much maybe you feel\nburnt out because you're doing too\nlittle yeah of the things that make you\nfeel alive the things that really light\nyou up the best-selling author and host\nthe number one Health and Wellness\npodcast on purpose with Jay Shetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now I know that\nyou're here because you want to be happy\nyou want to be healthy and you want to\nheal I think that's why I'm here too\nwhen I sit down with the guest that's\nwhat I'm hoping to do I'm hoping to find\nmoments of Happiness moments of Health\nadvice and moments of healing but one of\nthe things I've been discovering lately\nthat I want to let you in on is when I'm\ndoing these interviews some of the\nguests that I'm speaking to have\nphenomenal Journeys and stories but some\nof them also I get the opportunity to\nco-create with I want to like discover\nnew ideas while we're in the podcast I\nwant to find new insights that we never\neven considered before I want to take a\nmoment to really see if we can let down\nour God let go of what we know and maybe\ngo into the unknown in a conversation\nand today's guest is someone who's going\nto allow us to do just that he is the\nforemost brain coach he's an incredible\nauthor and an amazing podcaster my dear\nfriend Jim quick the author of Limitless\nif you don't have this book it is a\nphenomenal read I highly recommend it\nand the first time Jim came on the\npodcast the book wasn't out yet so I\ncouldn't tell you about it but I really\nhope that you'll check it out Jim\nwelcome back to on purpose it's so great\nto have you here when we first did this\nand I want everyone to know this when we\nfirst launched the podcast you were I\nthink you were one of the guests within\nour first six months you were in my\napartment where we used to shoot and it\nwas so kind and gracious of you to come\non we were just starting out we were\njust figuring out what on purpose was\nand you supported us and it means the\nworld to me so I'll never forget that\nbut I love we were chatting offline\nbefore which I loved and we were talking\nabout how we wanted this conversation to\nbe special I mean that's what you asked\nme how do I make this conversation\nspecial how do we make it different and\nthat's where this idea came from is when\nwe're sitting with someone it's like how\ncan we like go back and forth and you\nknow spark something new but you you\nasked me something and that's where I\nkind of want to start because it's kind\nof going to lead us down a a random path\nwhich I love I and I'll tell you the\nstory so I called up someone the other\nday and it's someone in my world and I\nsaid to them I have this idea\nand I really want to do this I think it\nwould be amazing and the first thing\nthey said to me was Jade those things\ndon't usually happen\nright that's not really possible like\nthat's that's not like the most probable\nlikely thing that we can make happen for\nyou now when I hear those kind of things\nand we're talking about Limitless and\nlimitations when I hear a limitation\nlike that my mind goes to\nthe fact that it's never been done is\nwhy I want to do it like that's what\nattracted to me in the first place if it\nwas already done then why would I want\nto do it again\nand so I wanted to start there with you\nand go how do we know if a limitation is\nreal or not like how do you know because\nwe all have limitations I have I love\nthis conversation I think the majority\nof limits are are learned\nand and I could give you stories and\nanecdotes around that and some some\nresearch I think my purpose in life\nbecause I was labeled Limited in a way\nwe talked about this on when I was on\nyour show earlier about having my\ntraumatic brain injury and being labeled\nthe boy with the broken brain and my\nlearning difficulties I want to offer\nreal hope and real help to those who\nwere told they were limited in some way\nyou know and I really don't believe that\nthe sky's a limit I believe our our\nminds are the limit there are all kinds\nof examples every day that when we\nchange our mindset some kind of form of\nour motivation or the methods we're\nusing that we could do things that we\ncould redraw the borders and boundaries\nof what's possible yeah and then you you\nexemplify that you embody this this idea\nof becoming more Limitless well I think\nit was for me too and thank you for\nsaying that but I think it was the same\nthing for me where I had also subscribed\nto the limits I thought Society placed\non me right and when you start to break\none limit and you see this like light\nshining through a crack and you're like\noh like this limit can actually be\nbroken you then stop thinking well how\nmany limits can we break right like\nthat's where I'm at right now but I\nwasn't always like that I think it's\nimportant to talk about that there was a\ntime in my life where I was living in\nthe rules within the barriers and now\nI'm at a place in my life where I'm like\nwell which berries can we push\nand that Journey for me has been an\nexciting one and a fun one tell me now\nlike what do you think is the difference\nbetween\nopen-mindedness like believing in the\nLimitless\nversus delusion because there's also a\nfine line on that side as well like is\nthere a line of how have you thought\nabout that and even if we don't have an\nanswer I want to figure that out with\nyou yeah let's do it yeah I think behind\nyeah to any kind of results in our life\nwe need to do a Behavior new Behavior or\na new set of behaviors I think in order\nto be able to execute that behavior we\nneed a mindset or a belief that allows\nthat to be possible the one that's very\nfamous you know Roger Bannister in 1950s\nwho broke the form in a mile and what\nhappened after that right other people\nstarted breaking it and there weren't\nbig advancements in true technology\nnutritional support training\nmethodologies but there was a change in\nin belief about what was possible\nbecause it wasn't a real limit\num and so even when people are training\nhe wasn't necessarily delusional I don't\nthink just because if you believe it\ndoesn't mean it's going to happen but I\nfeel like if we don't believe it it\ndramatically recruits reduces happening\nyou know because yeah act accordingly\nyeah you know and so many people they're\nshrinking what's possible to fit their\nminds and I would always say what if we\ndid the opposite what if we expanded our\nminds in this situation to fit more of\nwhat's really possible yeah yeah I think\nthat's a great great answer you're so\nright it's\nit's fascinating how everything is just\na thought I was talking to\na couple of friends a couple of nights\nago\nand I was talking to him about the the\nhernia surgery that I just went through\nand he was saying to me like how tough\nwas it and I had a tough version of it\nwe were just talking about it some\npeople wake up and in the next 24 hours\nthey're fine it's taken me four weeks to\nfeel 50 again right like that that's how\nI feel maybe 50 60 again I know people\nhave gone through for 12 months right\nthey're still here yeah people are still\ngoing through it and so he said to me he\nwas just like do you like how did you\nnot let yourself get depressed because\nlike the first week I couldn't walk\nuh and I had something called\natelectasis which is like a partial\ncollapse of the lungs so I couldn't\nbreathe every three breaths almost and\nthen my wife rushed me to the hospital\nuh to ER like one morning at three a.m\nbecause they thought I might have blood\nclots and I didn't thankfully\nand then the second week when I started\nto walk it was still like on and off\npain it was very uncertain I then ended\nup getting back pain because I was on my\nback for so long I couldn't lie on\neither side because I had it on both\nsides and so then my back was like so I\nwas waking up at 3am every day for three\nweeks because I couldn't sleep anymore\nbecause my back was hurting so I was\nwalking around at 3am I couldn't sit to\nmeditate I was doing walking meditations\nand he was like how did you not get\ndepressed during that time and I said to\nhim that for me\nit was the power of my mind and it was a\nstory it was like I'd lost the strength\nin my body for sure\nbut I kept repeating to myself I'm happy\nI'm healthy I'm healing I'm happy I'm\nhealthy I'm healing and what I was\nsaying to me it's not that because I\nsaid that I was happy healthy and\nhealing it's that I had a choice of a\nthought which is what you're saying a\nbelief that I could have either believed\nI'm sad I'm hurting and it's all over or\nI'm happy I'm healthy and I'm healing\nand as just as you said it's not that\nthat belief or that thought made me\nbetter but it's just that if I didn't\nhave that thought it would have been way\nharder to get through that pain and so I\nlove that to see that in practice what\nyou just said for me was huge you know\nin Limitless I talk about seven lies to\nlearning because my my wheelhouse who's\nteaching celebrated learning teach me\nable to read faster learn languages\nremember people's names improve their\nmemory focus and uh lie for me is is\nstands for limited idea entertained\nlimited ID entertainment so good it's\ngetting us to self-reflect on you know\nis it really that you're too old or\nyou're not smart enough people come to\nme at events after they see me do these\nmemory demonstrations or maybe I'll\nremember people's names or do something\nand they'll say Jim I'm just not smart\nenough I have a horrible memory and I\nalways say stop if you fight for your\nlimitations you get to keep them oh yeah\nbreak your limits they're yours and\noften we don't know the you know the\npower of our mind uh you know it's I\nmentioned this last time but it's like\nyour brain is this incredible super\ncomputer and your self-talk your\nthoughts are the program that will run\nso tell yourself I'm not good at\nremembering people's names you all\nremember the name of the next person you\nmean because your program your super\ncomputer not to so how do you transcend\nthese lies how do you end the trance\nbecause these live these were learned\nright this idea that genius is born this\nuh this idea that we're only using you\nknow a small fraction of our our brain\nten percent or something like that and\nyou can unravel these lies there's and\nyou mentioned a very key word I put a\nquote in the book from a French\nphilosopher and he says like is the sea\nbetween B and D life is the letter c\nbetween b and d b stands for birth d\nstands for death life C and you set a\nchoice that I I really do believe that\nour lives are the sum total of all the\nchoices we've made up to this point you\nknow what are we going to what are we\ngoing to feed our minds yeah we're going\nto spend time with where are we going to\nlive you know what are we going to\nbelieve yeah what are we going to think\nand say to ourselves on a regular basis\nand I believe that these difficult times\nthey can diminish us these difficult\ntimes they could distract us which a lot\nof people feel distracted or these\ndifficult times they can develop us yeah\nultimately we always decide so the Power\nof Choice you made that choice in terms\nof what you choose to be able to believe\nand with that choice you know comes a\nlot of responsibility and without\nresponsibility comes a lot of power I I\nlove what you clarified there though\nbecause the choice can be harder like I\ndidn't go through a life-threatening\nsurgery if someone went through that\nit's the choice becomes harder and\nharder to make sure if your Stakes are\nhigh higher and higher but the choice\nbrings power with it and and so it's\nlike we need that power to come with it\nright like and that's where you're\nmaking clear for us I'm one of the\nthings that I'm thinking about when\nwe're talking about limitations\nlimitations almost make us feel safe I\nthink people don't often connect the two\nbut they do like if you aim low chances\nare you'll get there and so you won't\nexperience disappointment right if you\nplace a limitation on yourself and say\nwell I can't do that then when you can't\ndo it it does it makes you feel good\nlike oh at least I knew and you're\nvalidated and you're validated exactly\nso you're looking for that so how is a\nfeeling that makes us feel safe actually\nsometimes the thing that's blocking us\nfrom feeling great yeah I think a lot of\nus will want to you know where our\nnervous system is not necessarily set up\nfor growth I think in the beginning it\nis until we've had some kind of a pain\nor trauma then and we want to be able to\nsurvive and keep ourselves safe\num there's this idea that let's say\nnegativity or pessimists are accurate\nmore because they maybe they set that\nstandard or that belief a little bit\nmore achievable uh but optimists maybe\nall right succeed more because of it\nbecause they have that kind of moonshot\nidea or our thinking\num the brain really wants to keep you\nkeep you alive right and it doesn't want\nto change it takes effort it takes\nenergy to be able to achieve the goals\nyou know there's this thing I saw on\nTwitter the other day saying life is\nhard for one of two reasons either\nbecause you're leaving your comfort zone\nlife can be very hard or because you're\nstaying in your comfort zone if people\nthought about change which ultimately\nyou know most people want if they're\nhealthy some area of their life\nrelationships health career or something\nand they're looking outside and they\nwant to achieve something else it's a\nlot safer to be able to say to keep\nsomething realistic without a doubt and\nI'm like that way also yeah of course of\ncourse in terms of my book deadlines\nwhat would become realistic it's even\npossible to get it done in x amount of\ntime and I also find that part of\ngetting results is reaching and then you\nknow and then stable like you stretch\nand then you stabilize yeah and then you\nstretch and you stay you can't be I\ndon't feel like we could be stretching\nall the time agreed that you could reach\nreach reach but you have to recover you\nhave to replenish yeah you have to be\nable to rest yeah also as well yeah I'm\ntrying to I'm trying to add to that\nbecause I know we both like alliteration\nbut it's like stretch stabilize and then\nforego like there's also what's a\nsacrifice I guess like but in a positive\nsense yeah surrender surrender yeah\nbecause I I found that I definitely am\nshocked at my capacity\nwith the amount of things I do today\nthat I didn't know wherever possible so\nif someone told me 10 years ago Jay one\nday you're gonna do this this this this\nthis I would have said no way I can just\ndo one thing and we did exactly what you\nsaid so every year I would stretch\nmyself every year and you're right you\ncan't just stretch stretch stretch\nstretch stretch every month but every\nyear I'd add one thing so like first we\nstarted creating videos and then after\nwe started creating videos we did the\npodcast and then we did the podcast we\ndid our courses and programming and then\nwe did our then I wrote my book and then\nafter that you know so we stretched\nourselves a little and I stretched\nmyself a little every year but then we\nstabilized but I've also found that I've\nalso had to let go of something\nsacrifice some things that once upon a\ntime were really important to me but\ntoday they're not as important and in\norder to stretch and stabilize I had to\nlearn a sacrifice too and I think that's\nsomething we struggle with like I think\none of our biggest limitations\nis\nwanting to hold on to stuff yeah right\nlike it's like there's no space to\nshift away and hold on to something else\nif we're holding on to this if I'm like\nno no I want this to be there for the\nrest of my life I'm missing out like\nwhat about that kind of limitation where\nit's not a limitation that I think about\nmyself it's actually a limitation\nbecause I want something to be there if\nthat makes sense yeah there is yeah when\nwe're talking about change or or even\ntransformation the symbol for me is that\nof a like many people butterfly and\nwhile the beauty is in the butterfly the\ngrowth is happening usually in that\ncocoon and that Chrysalis and it's one\nof those things where there's this story\nwhere there's this kid playing in the\nbackyard and his parents are in the\nhouse and he comes across a caterpillar\nand he wasn't allowed any pets but he\nwanted to make this caterpillar his pet\nso he runs in talks to his parents\nsaying can I keep it can I keep it and\nthe mother says yes but you have to take\ncare of it you have to be able to feed\nit and everything and\nshe gives him a mason jar puts a little\nhole in it and then he goes there and he\nopens it up and he puts like leaves in\nthere for the for the caterpillar to eat\nand a little tree branch for it to climb\nand then and one day as you can imagine\nit spins this cocoon and you know the\nboy is enthralled is bewildered at this\nprocess of life and but he gets a little\nimpatient because he knows what's coming\nright that it's going to emerge as a\nbutterfly and uh and then one day lo and\nbehold there's you could see a little\ncrack open up and if he gets impatient\nbecause it's taking too long so he runs\ninside his house and he grabs scissors\nand he uh he walks back outside because\nhe knows how to run with those scissors\nbut he he Clips it that whole open to be\nable to allow it to be able to get free\nbut an interesting thing happened when\nthis creature came out it didn't look\nlike a butterfly it kind of looked like\na butterfly but didn't really\num the wings were very shriveled the the\nbody was very swollen and it didn't fly\nyou know this thing he was looking\nforward to and he cries to his parents\nand the parents asked what happened and\nhe was explaining how he cut it open and\num and they explained to him because he\nwas trying to make it easy for that\ncreature that that creature didn't have\nto develop the strength right and\nactually when it pushes through that\nhole is when it takes the the the fluids\ninside of its body and it nourishes and\ngoes out to the wings and then it can\nbecome that butterfly and sword in New\nHeights and I guess I bring this up\nbecause I feel like even the past few\nyears people feel like maybe they were\ncocooning you know and they're in this\nplace and they were alone alone with\ntheir thoughts along with um you know\ntheir fears it might be even feeling\nalone and you and I have talked to many\nconversations about mental health and uh\nhow it you know how our brain health is\naffecting our mental health and uh and I\nwould say that um through struggles\nsometimes there is their strength you\nknow my struggles growing up were\nlearning uh it was public speaking you\nknow you know life has a sense of humor\nbecause that's all I do is public speak\non this thing called learning but you\nknow disadvantage within the word\ndisadvantage there's that word advantage\nright and I always feel like there's\nsome kind of Advantage within within\nevery disadvantage yeah yeah and it's\nhard to it's hard to see that when\nyou're in it when you're inside the jar\nyeah inside the Cocoon it's so hard to\nsee it but I think looking back at\nprevious cocoons and seeing how you\nemerged is often the best bet you have\nit's almost like I know I remember when\nI was at school I'd always be like well\nlast year I did well in my exam so how\ndo I do well this year let me remember\nwhat I did last year and that's a very\nsmall example but even now it's like\nwhen I went through this surgery the\nlast surgery I had was when I lost my\nvoice and I had polyps in my throat\nwhich was around 10 years ago and so for\nlike I remember at that time for months\non end I was drinking out of a straw and\nlike I couldn't speak and I had a white\nboard where I would write things to my\nparents and my my sister and my mom who\nwere taking care of me and I was like\nokay well I got through that surgery\nlike what what mindset did I need like\nwhat can I do now or what did I not do\nthat time that I should get right now\nand so I find like reflection is such a\ngreat tool to overcome limitations and I\nthink reflecting on your own life and\nthis is the part that I think I want to\nI want to talk about this with you\nbecause I I don't know the answer and I\ndon't think we've talked about this\nbefore but we get so fascinated\nreflecting on other people's lives right\nwhat is the news what is pop culture\nnews what is mainstream media doing\nyou're spending your whole day\nreflecting on someone else's life so and\nso cheated on someone so and so messed\nup the world record like didn't make it\nuh so and so like you know they they\nfell off stage when they were performing\ntheir song or whatever it is right like\nthis there's like this negative\nreflection on everyone else's life\nbut rarely do we carve out the time to\nreflect on our own life\nwhy do you think that is and and where\ndoes that come from and I just want to\nhear your thoughts on that because\nreflection is something we all know how\nto do we just don't necessarily do it\ninward I think it could be an incredible\nAdvantage also reflection I mean when\nyou reflect on something you're\nharnessing the power of your memory and\nyou know as the memory coach you know I\nfeel like it's not just remembering\nfacts and figures in foreign languages\nuh her speeches are things that can make\nyou more productive in your performance\nit's also reflecting and remembering the\nthings that that give you confidence and\ncertainty moving moving forward that\nreflection can be a superpower that\nhindsight could lead to foresight so\nmany people forget about their wins you\nknow they forget sometimes of the things\nthat they overcame you know I always and\nso many people are scared of you know\nsomeone watching this or listening to\nright now could be afraid of making a\nmistake and looking bad you know I\nalways tell people well if you make a\nmistake you make it old whole LD and\neverything's an acronym oh is you you\nown it you know we don't put it outside\nof ourselves we don't become a victim uh\nwe apologize we hurt somebody we fix it\nif we can we take responsibility for it\nbecause that allows us to be able to\nmake it better the L is you learn from\nit and that's why we make mistakes right\nthere are Stepping Stones to make us a\nbetter person if we learn from it that\nthere's maybe there's no failure maybe\nthere's feedback or maybe there's no you\nknow you're not failing maybe just\nfailing to learn something and so you\nwant to be able to do that but then the\nD is is really where it lands the Diaz\ndon't repeat it because so many people\ncan learn in the moment but then they\nrepeated they they repeat that mistake\nin their relationships or in their\ndating life they repeat it they forget\nwhat that that junk food made them feel\nlike you know afterwards they're staying\nup late at night yeah you know in terms\nof ruining their sleep and hurting their\npeace of mind the next day so don't\nrepeat it because you know Insanity\ndoing the same thing over and over again\nexpecting a different result and\nsometimes it's not Insanity maybe\nsometimes it's just not managing our\nmemory you know and remembering that\nthose moments the hindsight where we've\nmade you know where like everyone right\nnow can imagine a time where they felt\nlike they couldn't survive yeah you know\nuh that they couldn't go any further and\nthe truth is if they're listening to\nthis they did they did survive it you\nknow and to be able to acknowledge it\npart of self-care is and self-love is\nlooking at that person in the mirror and\nyou know that person who's been through\nso much but but is still standing yeah\nyou know and and reflecting on that\num in terms how far we've come yeah\nmemory is such a tricky thing like in\nthe sense of not just like remembering\nsomething what I mean by that is we all\nknow that there's a song from our past\nthat it clicks on and almost all of a\nsudden you're feeling Nostalgia and\nyou're like remembering that moment when\nyou're at college or whatever it was or\nright you can go back to that place so\nmemory Works in that way\nbut memory also works in the opposite\nway like I was thinking to myself that\nyou know just a few weeks ago I couldn't\nwalk\nand I was walking really slowly I was\nlike really dealing with the pain I was\nlike okay I never you know I want to be\nso mindful and then as soon as you start\nto feel better it's so easy to just\nforget all of that yeah and just start\nwalking normally again and being not\nMindful and it's almost like that where\nit's like pain makes you really present\nand conscious and there and then all of\na sudden when pain goes away you're not\npresent anymore and you kind of just get\non with your life and so I find it weird\nthat sometimes our memory is so strong\nand sometimes it's so weak also when\npeople have had a really painful trauma\nin the past\nthat pain stays with us and that we\nalmost don't let go of enough but then\nsometimes when we've had certain pains\nwe let them go too quick it's it's\nalmost like how long pain stays with you\nis all pleasure stays with you it's such\na weird concept and I guess what you're\nsaying is that\nthere are certain types of pain that we\nhave to learn to let go there are\ncertain types of pain that we need to\nremember in order to not repeat right\nthe same mistake and it's like\nhow do you know which one's which right\nyou know or how do you process that and\neven in relationships a lot of we have a\nlot of emotional pain a mental anguish\nin relationships sometimes and you know\nit's even when you're thinking about\nforgiving someone you could forgive them\nand not forget in terms of the lesson\nthat they taught you and even adversity\nI mean do you feel part of it is in\nhindsight I think about what's the\nmeaning of this right that's a choice\nthat we can make at any given time do\nyou think that what you went through\nmost recently with your surgery do you\nthink it's do you look at it in any way\nas what is this teaching me yeah yeah\nalways I I think for me I mean there's a\nlot of lessons in it one thing is I I\nconsider myself to be quite a mindful\nhealthy individual I try to eat healthy\nI work out I sleep healthy I have good\nrhythms and routines I definitely push\nthe Optimal Performance button like I'm\nlike definitely always trying to figure\nthat out and I think things like this\nare very humbling uh and and that's how\nI that's the biggest meaning I take away\nfrom all of this stuff is you you're not\nthe control layer you're not Superman\nright you're not you haven't figured\neverything out like they're very\nhumbling they really they make you\nrealize you're still in a human body and\nyou have to deal with the ups and downs\nof it uh the second thing I think I took\naway from this whole journey was uh how\nmuch I've enjoyed being slow like it's I\nI consider myself like I want to say\nslow I mean like I consider myself to be\npresent mentally but I think I'm quite\nfast physically and I live a fast life\nphysically\nand mental presence is a beautiful thing\nwhen you live fast but having\nphysical presence also which their\nsurgery made me have for the first time\nin a long time probably since I was a\nkid like I can't remember I've literally\nfelt like there were times when I was\nteaching myself how to slowly walk again\nand like put pressure on my feet and I\nwas like wait a minute it's really nice\nliving life this slow like this is\nactually really special like I hope I\ncan hold on to elements of this and\nyesterday it was funny because I was\nwith my friends in New York City and we\nwere on a walk and usually we looked at\nit it was like 20 minutes to get some\nwhen the store was going to close in 30\nminutes and I know that if I was walking\nthat path like five months ago I'd be\nlike we can do that in 10. like that's\nwhat I would have said and I said to my\nfriend yesterday I was like look I think\nI'm going to do it in probably like 23\nminutes because I'm slower right now\nright and so we're only going to get\nseven minutes of the store so if you\nguys want to go ahead you guys go ahead\nand I'm gonna look at my pace and we\nwalked then we got there in 23 minutes\nand it was absolutely fine but it was\neven just me having that shift I was\nlike wow I'm really appreciating walking\nat this pace even though I could get\nmore done before there's there's a\ncertain joy in moving at this face so I\nfully agree with you I think there's so\nmuch meaning so many lessons and that is\nthe only way to live I mean you know if\nyou don't live that way it just ends up\nbeing another inconvenience well we\ncertainly all everybody could ask anyway\nwe had the shared adversity right it\ncomes in different forms you know I\nmentioned my challenges for learning\npublic speaking as an adult I had severe\nsleep issues from sleep apnea\nobstructive and how it's I would for\nfive years I slept 90 minutes a night\nand it was his review is just tearing my\nmind that's crazy yeah this is one of\nthe things and it wasn't straight it was\nvery interrupted I would stop breathing\nit was more of a genetic thing and I\nwould stop breathing 240 times a night\neach time was like 10 seconds and I did\na series of surgeries and I know how how\nhumbling that could be you know and\nsometimes being reminded\num that we aren't always the the super\nman or woman or a girl\num you know there's there's a great\nfoundation for for curiosity so what can\nI learn from this\num a great appreciation to cultivate\ngratitude you know I think what you\nappreciate tends to appreciate yeah you\nknow in our life for for sure and\ngratitude Reid wires our nervous system\nfor greater productivity for greater\nperformance and certainly greater peace\nyou know and I think peace of mind is\nhigh currency today totally without a\ndoubt um with my sleep though you know\nand that was a very painful surgery it\nwas different than when you're a kid\ntaking and they took a nice tonsils my\nuvula my soft palate and I I was you\nknow for for weeks couldn't breathe\ncouldn't eat couldn't do anything but I\nthink what I learned from my sleep\nissues you know there was a gift in it\nyou know when I'd be able to read and\nremember and focus and con you know so I\ngot to you know live what I teach and\npractice what I put that's what it is\nyeah that's what it is that's a big\nthing and then the other part of it is I\nfound out that in everything I did was\nyou know for a reason like there's\nnowhere else I'd rather be right now\nright I would always say you know heck\nyes or heck no because I think a lot of\npeople get tired and because they have\ntoo many tabs open or maybe some people\nare watching right now feel burnt out\nbecause they're doing too much maybe\nyou're not burnt out because you're\ndoing too much maybe you feel burnt out\nbecause you're doing too little yeah of\nthe things that make you feel alive the\nthings that really light you up and you\nknow being in that cocoon\npart of it is you could get clarity you\nknow I think Solitude when we choose to\nslow down and have you know gets based\nfrom noise and when you say yes to\nsomebody or something you're not saying\nno to yourself and I think Clarity using\ntime just even five ten minutes a day to\njust clarify what's sometimes when\nyou're going 100 miles an hour you're\nnot thinking about oh am I going the\nright direction yeah right and asking\nyourself a simple question like what's\nwhat's most important to me you know in\nmy life what's most important to me in\nthis moment in my relationships and my\ncareer and then asking yourself on the\nother side are my actions today aligned\nwith those values yes because sometimes\nuh you know we make doing something\nthat's it's not just about time\nmanagement for productivity it's about\nmind management and it's about priority\nmanagement you know the most important\nthing is to eat the most important thing\nthe most important thing and you know\nthat will allow you while you're\ncocooning you know that clarity as well\nas doing so during things like care and\ncontribution and I could alliterate all\nthe C's yeah yeah it makes a difference\nto come out of this stronger to be able\nto sort to new heights as we're going\nthrough this transformation yeah I think\nif someone's listening to this right now\nand like\nreally feeling Limited in\nyou know the sense of how they feel\nabout themselves they're limited by how\nmany options I think options is an\ninteresting thing like you know and it\nis different for different people I\nremembered that when I was\nin the corporate world and when I was\nemployed and yeah I didn't do what was\nmeaningful to me I wasn't passionate\nabout what I did it was just what I\nneeded to do to pay the bills and and\ntake care of things what gave me more\nconfidence was that I always would know\nif I had other options of what I could\ndo right and I would have to entertain\noptions in order to realize that I\nwasn't as limited as I thought I was\nbecause there was a part of me that\nbelieved I was like well this is all I\ncan do this is the only qualification I\nhave like no one else would give me a\njob yeah and then there was a part of me\nthat was like well that's not true\nactually I could change and shift and do\nthis and do that I think often we limit\nthe number of options we think we have\nit's it's almost like going back to that\nuh Edison quote of like I didn't fail 10\n000 times I just found 999 ways not to\ndo it and I think there's a there's a\ndeeper thought from him that I loved\nwhen he said\nand this is something I always hold on\nto and Edison said when you think you've\nexhausted all options remember this you\nhaven't right and and I've always loved\nthat because sometimes I feel like that\nsometimes I'm trying to make something\nhappen right maybe you're trying to get\na book deal maybe someone's trying to\nget a podcast deal maybe someone's\ntrying to raise a million dollars to to\nsave you know group of people from\nsomething that they're struggling with\nand you try everything and then none of\nthem work and you think oh well it's\njust not meant to happen but Edison's\ntake is well there's another how do you\nkind of\nlive for that one more yeah it doesn't\nmake sense yeah it does they say that\nthe problem is rarely the problem the\nproblem is our attitude about the\nproblem yeah you know with with options\nit's they've they've shown where it's\none of those things where if you're if\nyou're limited to one option or two\noptions you don't really have a whole\nlot of choice but also if you have too\nmany options you might not actually yeah\nanything because you struggle with\ndecision fatigue right you have you have\nthe menu is like 50 pages long and then\nit you have this overwhelm and our brain\nprimarily is more of a deletion device\nis trying to keep options out or\ninformation out otherwise we'd go become\noverloaded and also overwhelmed and so\nthat that's a big part of it you know\nsomething I teach in everything whenever\nI'm working with a client I just look\nthrough one framework and I call it the\nLimitless model and maybe this will shed\nlight and we can have a conversation\nabout this where I believe limits are\nlearned in one of three areas and so if\neverybody we could turn this into like a\nlittle exercise yeah if everybody can\nthink of an area where you feel limited\nall right so just think of any area\nwhere you feel like and Limitless is for\nme is not about like being perfect\nLimitless is about advancing or\nprogressing beyond what you currently\nbelieve or demonstrating is possible and\nso if everybody thinks about an area of\ntheir health or maybe it's a\nrelationship where do you feel like\nyou're stuck like you're not advancing\nwhere do you feel like you're in a box\nnow that box by definition is\nthree-dimensional right and there's\nthree forces that contain that box but\nthey're also three four these are the\nsame three forces that will liberate you\nout of that box and it'll become more\nLimitless so imagine there that they're\nbeing represented by three intersecting\ncircles some people are familiar with a\nVenn diagram it's kind of like Mickey\nMouse two ears two circles and then a\nface right and they and they overlap so\nthe first one is your mindset and so I\nbelieve that our mindset is something\nlike I wasn't born with this idea that I\nhad a broken brain it was imprinted on\nme right and our mindset comes from our\nexperience through external environment\nenvironment\nyou know through throughout other\npeople's expectations and mindset I'm\ndefining as the your attitudes and\nassumptions about something your\nattitudes assumptions about what's\npossible your attitudes and assumptions\nabout what you're capable of because you\ncould believe it's possible for somebody\nelse to have that loving relationship or\nbuild that big business or have a\nhundred thousand followers but you might\nnot believe it's possible for you and\nyou can still be stuck in that box\nbesides what is possible what you what\nyou're capable of what you believe you\ndeserve right A lot of people might be\nstuck in that box because they might\nknow the right methods and may be\nmotivated but they're they don't believe\nthat they deserve those things so those\nare the things that you know I talk\nabout uncovering and unlimiting those\nthose lies so if you believe you're not\nsmart enough if you believe you're a\nslow reader if you believe you're I am a\nprocrastinator whatever happens to be\nyou're stuck in that box the second\nCircle that you have to take into\naccount besides mindset and there are\nmany interventions by the way like if\nyou feel like you could identify a lie\nthat you know hey I'm not smart enough I\ndon't have a resource whatever it is you\nknow there are things that people have\ntalked about on your show whether it's\nuh emotional Freedom technique EMDR\nhypnosis there's a ways of of changing\nyour belief systems right the second\nCircle though is just as powerful the\nsecond M besides mindset is motivation\nyou know and motivation you could have a\nlimitless mindset but not be motivated\nto get out of that box you might think\neverything is possible I deserve it I'm\ncapable but you're not motivated to get\noff the couch and do those things you\nknow for me there's a simple formula for\nsustained motivation and it's P the\nletter P times e times S3 and so if we\nwere to do a thought experiment and say\nwhat do you want to be motivated for\nmaybe for some people it's to read every\nday you know leaders or readers somebody\nhas decades experience like you do you\nput into a book think like a monk and\nsomebody sit down a few days and read\nthat book they could download decades\nand days but they're not reading every\nday maybe they're really good at buying\na book but they're not good at reading\nthat book this is some people right\nthey're very good at adding to cart and\nit sits on their shelf and becomes shelf\nhelp not self-help right\num but but they're not motivated and so\nmaybe their mindset is yeah it's good to\ngrow but they're not motivated so P\nstands for purpose and what I mean by\npurpose is and you're an expert at this\nit's just not just cognitive\nreasons but how do you feel about\nsomething because we know we're not\nlogical we are more emotional right you\nmentioned that if there's a song that\ncan take you back to when you're a child\nit's it's that emotional feeling that\nmood that got linked to that information\nis this like a food or a fragrance that\ncould take you back to when you're a kid\nso purpose allowing yourself to feel the\nbenefits instead of just it has to go\nfrom your head to your heart and your\nhands right and so allow yourself to\nfeel that but even if someone has\npurpose they might not read because the\nE stands for energy right a lot of some\npeople if they if they haven't slept\nbecause they have a newborn child they\ncan't focus yeah right they can't have\nthe mental fortitude or maybe they ate\nsome junk food and I don't think there's\njunk food there's junk and there's food\nbut maybe they're they're they're in a\nfood coma and they don't have the energy\nto study right so yeah you know we talk\nabout the best brain foods how to reduce\nstress but it takes the blood energy\nyour pure group could take a lot of\nenergy out of you also as well but let's\nsay you have a limitless purpose and\nLimitless energy the S3 are those small\nall simple steps you know those tiny\nlittle actions you could take so maybe\nit's working out and that's too big or\ngoing back to reading maybe it's reading\na chapter is too big for someone who\ndoesn't do that maybe just opening the\nbook is a small simple step reading one\nline is a small simple step maybe\nworking out an hour a day is tough maybe\ngetting your running shoes on maybe\ngetting yourself to the gym is a small\nsimple step I think little by little a\nlittle becomes a lot you know and so\nthat's really the key is consistency\nbecause if you're persistent you could\nachieve it but if you're consistent you\nget to keep it yeah and it's the\ndifference between something being\nattainable and sustainable over time and\nthen finally the last demo are the\nmethods you know once you have a\nlimitless mindset you have a limitless\nmotivation you could be doing old\nmethods and still not get to where you\nneed to go all methods of sales all\nmethods of learning or methods of health\nand you wonder why you're still stuck in\nthat box and so when's the last time we\ntook time to upgrade our knowledge our\nskills our our abilities you know so\nthose are the three M's and people try\ndraw that out or even imagine that\nyou'll notice that the 3ms overlap and\nthey create three eyes too where mindset\nand motivation crossover the first eye\nis inspiration right because it changes\nwhat's inspiration something that\nchanges your mindset about what's\npossible and also you're a little bit\nmotivated you have some drive and\npurpose but you might not have the\nmethods you might not have the\ninstruction right so you're still stuck\nin that box or mindset and methods cross\nover you believe it's possible in your\nmind and you know what to do the methods\nthat's the second eye which is ideation\nit just stays an idea right but\nnothing's happening because you're not\nmotivated and then finally where\nmotivation and methods cross over you\nthe third eye which is implementation\nYou're motivated you have purpose you\nhave energy and you know what to do to\ndo the get out of that box but you can\nstill be stuck in that box because\nyou're limited by your mindset yeah you\nknow and so that's what I think and then\nwe're through all three connect you have\nthe fourth eye which is your identity\nwhich is integration it's just who who\nyou are and that's really the goal so my\nmy conversation with becoming more\nLimitless is about re-drawing like where\nwhere are we stuck and I think once you\ncould identify oh it's uh let's say\nsomeone can't remember names is it my\nmindset do I believe I'm just too old or\nI have a horrible memory or maybe that's\nnot the case maybe it's hey I don't have\na purpose I don't have a reason to\nremember their names yeah right or I'm\njust really tired or I don't have the\nmethods I was never taught there's no\nclass on how to remember names and then\nit gives you your your agency back it's\nsuch a phenomenon it gives you a power\nback also it's such a phenomenal\nframework it's such a fantastic\nframework and I know it's in the book\nLimitless it's\nsuch a great framework and I love the\nway you break things down because like\nyou said I think often we just spend too\nmuch time while we waste too much time\njust trying to figure out what the issue\nis right and it's one of those three and\nonce you know that then you can break it\ndown and I think you've just given\npeople a real map to say hey which area\nare you struggling with with whatever\nlimit they chose and it works for\nyourself and also it's a map you could\nuse with people around you yeah it's a\nlens when you're working with your kids\nand they're not doing something that\nthey know they should do you know is is\nit their mindset do they not believe in\nthemselves and I believe they're capable\ndo not believe they deserve it or maybe\nthey have no purpose to clean their room\nor to study these things you know if\nit's not relevant to them they're\nprobably not and so you know what to\naddress maybe they're just we have to\nwork on optimizing their energy because\nyou don't have energy you do it right\nyes this whole idea you take your nouns\nin your life and turn them into verbs\nyou don't have Focus people are thinking\nthat's my problem Jim I'm watching this\nbecause I don't know I'm focused but you\ndon't have Focus you do it there's a\nprocess for focusing you don't have a\nmemory there's a process of encoding\nstoring and retrieving you know you\ndon't even have energy there's a process\nfor generating energy and as our friend\nBrandon burchard talks a lot about you\nknow a lot that you know you generate\nthis kind of energy and they're also it\ncould be the methods sometimes it's\nsimply learning better tools also as\nwell so you could use it with your\nfriends you can work with your team and\nthis works micro and it also works macro\nthis works at a cultural level it works\nat the level of community works at the\nlevel of your country there's a set\nmindset about you know what maybe around\ncertain issues right and it's really\nhard to create change or becoming more\nLimitless you know based on certain\nmindset around maybe fairness and\nequality whatever it happens to be yeah\nor maybe these people maybe they don't\nhave purpose you know or maybe they're\nre-incentivized to keep things in a\ncertain way or maybe they lack energy or\nresources or maybe they're using old\nmethods for leadership or or making\nchange right so it can happen micro or\nmacro that's unbelievable yeah I love\nthat I love the framework even more\nhearing it from you it's just\nI'm trying to think of so many areas in\nmy life where I'm like okay which one am\nI struggling with right like which which\none is it where well we haven't got it\nright or or we haven't figured it out\nand I think if everyone just took a few\nmoments today to reflect on that one\narea of their life that they want to\nwork on and identify it with that\nprocess when we start to do it you know\nwho we're around we always have known\nthat like who we're around is such a big\ndeal\nuh our friends our family our community\nlike these things have a huge impact on\nus right like negativity's contagious\nlike so much\nso many people say that they feel\ndrained by the people around them or\ntheir family or that when they share a\nnew big idea right with someone that\nthey love they're often met with\nresistance like I hear this so often\nyeah uh and when you think about limits\nyou think about what you said like you\ndidn't you weren't born with limits you\nhad limits placed on you\nbut we either get to choose to accept or\nreject those limits\nbut it's really hard and it's really\nhard for people to reject a limit placed\non them by someone they love and Trust\nwalk us through that a little bit like\nlet's think out loud about that like\nwhen someone has their mother or their\nfather or someone they really respect\nplace a limit on them right they you\nwant that person to root for you you\nwant that person for you to win yeah we\nall need people to encourage us to be\nable to challenge us to be able to\ncheerlead for us to Believe in Us and if\nwe haven't found that person yet then\nyou know my my advice would be to be\nthat person yeah be that person for\nsomebody else especially be that person\nfor for yourself right you know we we\ntalked about last time in this\nconversation the difference between a\nthermostat and thermometer a thermometer\non the wall just it's only function it\nreacts to the environment and sometimes\nwe we as humans we react to the economy\nwe react to politics we react how people\ntreat us react to the weather but we\nknow through studies done on people who\nare most successful at least at least\nthe ones that are happiest and most\nfulfilled they don't react as much as\nthey respond right they're a thermostat\na thermostat doesn't react to the\nenvironment it gauges it knows the\ntemperature in this room but it also\nwhat it sets a temperature and the\nenvironment reacts to it so it's that\nagency\num you know last time you and I talked\nabout some of the people that I got to\nbe able to spend time with and coach and\nwhat I learn from those people and one\nof them I mentioned was Stan Lee and it\nwasn't just his playfulness you know and\nhis passion for what he did it was also\nresponsibility and I remember I picked\nhim up for dinner one day uh evening and\nI asked them like I need to know this\nbecause I remember I couldn't read and I\ntell myself how to read my reading comic\nbooks I tell them that whole story\nbecause it brought the words to life but\nI said who's your favorite who's your\nfavorite and he says Jim my favorite is\nIron Man and he says Jim who's your\nfavorite any of the Spider-Man tie and I\nwas like Spider-Man and he says without\na pause his iconic voice with great\npower comes great responsibility right\nand truthfully I I reverse a lot of\nthings I see I read I hear maybe because\nof my my brain injuries as a child and I\nheard something totally different I was\nlike Sam you're right with great power\ncomparative responsibility and the\nopposite is also true with great\nresponsibility comes great power when we\ntake responsibility for something we\nhave great power to make things better\nyou know and the thing is when we make\nexcuses or We complain it's probably all\nvalid we probably it's yeah it's\nprobably true right\num but it doesn't make anything better\nright so we use a lot of our focus our\nAttention our energy when it can be\nbetter well spent because we can't be\nupset by the results we didn't get from\nthe work we didn't do right and so when\nwe take personal responsibility we have\nthe power to make thing things better\nand I would say part of responsibility\nis is our peer group certainly affects\nthings I always say watch it affects W\nour words right the words we started\nadopting the same language patterns as\npeople around us started using the same\nphrases the a we are actions we start\ndoing the same behaviors as people\naround us also as well good and bad what\nwe eat so it's not just our neurological\nnetworks it's our social networks right\nand who we spend time with is who we\nbecome we start believing their same\nstandards and they're all their\nexpectations of for us right the tea and\nwatch is we start mirroring the thoughts\nof the people around us we start\nthinking the same way about ourselves as\nwhat people think about us the sea is a\nbig one it's our character right we know\nthat people if that breaks in integrity\nand they're around people that are\ndisingenuous you know that they're more\nlikely to pursue you know and have that\nsame kind of standard I saw recently a\nquote that said Integrity is measured by\nthe distance between someone's lips and\ntheir life and I just like wow that's a\nnice cut yeah it's powerful yeah I love\nthat called Truth bumps but yeah it's\nthe character and then finally the age\ncan watch our habits we start adopting\nthe same routines and the habits of the\npeople that we spend time with so we\nhave to stand guard to the doors of our\nmind right and we have these mirror\nneurons that's constantly emit in our\nnervous system that are constantly\nimitating the people around us and so we\ncan love our family and we can love our\nfriends but when our lives are fueled by\nthe expectations and beliefs and\nopinions of other people then we're\ngoing to run out of gas right good bad\nand and different part of it is owning\nthat agency saying that yeah it's yes\nit's hard you know when people don't\nbelieve in you and like that that's I\nwas very blessed I think you know I won\nthe lottery when it came to my parents\nthey they immigrated here they're not\nthe most spiritual they've never had a\ngreen juice you know they don't do yoga\nthey're not the most health conscious or\nyou know read personal development books\nbut they're just it's really good people\nthey do what they they're hard working\nthey're very very kind you know so I\nfeel like everything that's good that's\ncome out of you know that I've ever done\nis I credit to them anything that's fall\nshort and it's all on me you know so I\nwas very I'm very blessed and it's not\nso much about the resources you have\nbecause we don't have any education we'd\nhave any money and we live in the back\nof a laundromat that my mom you know\nworked at didn't have any connections or\nnetwork or anything you know back then\nand so I would say that if there's\nsomebody else that has survived and even\nthrived you know in those game kind of\nsituations that I do believe that genius\nin any of its forms I'll talk about IQ\nthat it's built that it's and it's not\nborn it's built around that we shouldn't\nbe shrinking our lives and our dreams to\nmeet this current situation instead\ndon't downgrade your dreams to meet this\ncurrent situation what if we upgraded\nour mindset what if we upgraded our\nmotivation what if we upgraded the\nmethods we're using to be able to meet\nour our destiny Tim that is so powerful\nI mean that one statement the reframe\nI've had that I'm a big Marvel fan as\nyou know and yeah to hear that reframe\nof that statement with great\nresponsibility comes great power that's\na universal principle it's almost like\nif you think about it that when you take\non a great responsibility everything in\nthe universe conspires to help you with\nit and so the amount of help you get is\nabout how much healing you're trying to\nbring\nand that's really beautiful and Powerful\nI mean that's going to stay with me for\na long time that's a really really\nspecial insight and uh I want to make\nsure that everyone goes out and grabs a\ncopy if you don't already of Limitless\nby Jim quick uh the 3M model is in this\nbook and broken down step by step as you\nsaw and heard Jim is a highly systematic\nlogical thinker and so if you want\nreally practical\nkey advice on all of these ideas and\ninsights to make sure you go and grab a\ncopy of this book uh Jim I want to thank\nyou for teaching us all how to be\nLimitless today and break through our\nlimitations I want to thank you for\ndoing it in your own life I thank your\nparents too for doing what they did that\nwas beautiful to hear that and I'm\nalways here to support and be right with\nyou whatever you're doing so thank you\nso much yeah I appreciate it and thank\nyou to your entire Community you know I\nbelieve the world right now so many\npeople\nfeel like they're dimming themselves\ntheir message to be able to because they\ndon't want their life to shine in other\npeople's eyes and I feel like we need to\nbe doing the opposite now more than ever\nyou know and we need a better brighter\nworld and I think that there's a version\nof ourselves and our family is our\npurpose everything that's patiently\nwaiting and the goal is we show up every\nsingle day until we're introduced well\nsad well said Jim quick everyone make\nsure that you uh tag me and Jim on\nInstagram on Twitter on Tick
