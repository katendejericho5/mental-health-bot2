cool and one day\nthose guys are gonna come to your\nconcert and then I wrote a letter to\nmyself as an adult but as an\neight-year-old self and I couldn't get\nthrough the I mean I'm bawling crying\nit's just such a great reminder to be a\nkid at heart and the best-selling author\nand host the number one Health and\nWellness podcast on purpose with Jay\nShetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou that come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now I know that you're\nlistening because you want to be happy\nyou want to be healthy and you want to\nbe healed and it's not always that I get\nto do this but I try and sit down with\nguests that I have really deep\nmeaningful relationships with and I like\nto share that with you because I find\nthat when these relationships develop\norganically offline then when we bring\nthem online usually after a couple of\nyears you get to experience something\nspecial you get to hear two friends\ntalking you get to hear people not not\nscared of being interviewed you get to\nhear me not being confused or flustered\nabout where I want to go and I really\nhope that this interview is going to do\nthat for you I'm speaking to someone who\nneeds no introduction I'm speaking to\nsomeone who I absolutely admire and\nrespect on so many levels you're going\nto see that throughout the interview and\nI'm speaking to someone who became one\nof my dearest friends with without\nmeeting him during the pandemic I'm\nspeaking about the one the only Joe\nJonas one of the kindest sweetest most\ndown-to-earth humans I know uh there is\nnot a bad bone in this guy's body uh\nhe's given me memories that will last a\nlifetime I'm so grateful that he's\nfinally on on purpose Joe wow thank you\nwelcome to this intro it was from the I\nneed you to introduce every show from\nnow on the nicest person I know I'll do\nit let me be the voice of God at your\nevents please we have a show tomorrow\nyou can do it\num I'm so thrilled to do this yeah\nhonestly your podcast has been on my top\nlessons every week\num life-changing and it's interesting\nhow I've quite I'm kind of late to the\ngame I discovered Jay Shetty a bit\nfurther along in my meditation Journey\nthan most when we first met was via Zoom\nactually the first one we met was in\nfront of like thousands of people online\nand then we didn't actually meet in\nperson until\nI probably a year and a half two years\nlater yeah my brother met you twice\nbefore yeah Nick met you twice yeah um\nso I was quite jealous and I was like\nmaybe he's not maybe he's not real this\nis an AI version of this person that was\ncreated but um I'm glad to say you're\nreal I'm glad that we've become so close\nand you've been\num so helpful for me I might on my\npersonal walk with whether if it's\nthe Jonas Brothers to\num personal things I'm going through\nthat I've expressed with you and on a\nbigger scale of just like the days that\nwe live our lives for everyone else and\nhow I'm able to function like a normal\nhuman being when I go home at the end of\nthe day so it's been really helpful so\nthank you no and I want to give you some\ncredit for this because I think a lot of\nthis stuff happens behind the scenes and\npeople are unaware especially with\nsomeone like you you've been popular and\nfamous for so much of your life and you\nknow there's so much written about\npeople and so much you hear about people\nand there's so much you don't hear and I\nthink in my line of work where I get to\nsee the behind the scenes of a lot of\npeople I I like to be able to share that\nbecause I think it's important so what\nJoe's talking about for anyone who's\nlistening or watching back at home is we\ndid this charity event thanks Dan I'll\ngive a big shout out to David Johnson\nright because David yeah David Johnson\nyeah because David knew that\nDavid felt that we would connect and we\ndid this event for we day and it was Joe\nLilly Collins and myself and Lily and\nJoe were hosting and I was asked to\nteach a meditation and literally seconds\nafter this meditation finishes live\nonline to thousands of people I get a\nmessage from Joe like probably literally\nin the next couple of hours saying hey\nI'd love to do a meditation like that\nfor my friends\nand I'm like cool that sounds great\nlet's do it and I and I thought nothing\nof it I was like yeah that makes sense\nhe obviously enjoyed it that's great\nlove that and so we did it so we set it\nup for that Sunday I think it was Sunday\nright and he set up a zoom link he sent\nme a zoom link and we started this thing\nand like maybe I can't remember how many\npeople joined the first one the first\none was probably close to like six or\nseven people oh is it really okay right\nit was pretty intimate yeah if I'm if\nI'm correct yeah yeah and then cut to\nyou know after the first few weeks\nmore people started to join and there\nwas always the same 10 but for sure\nsometimes it was like 30 people were on\nthe zoom yeah and all different walks of\nlife people from all over the world\nobviously when we're in proper lockdown\num and a lot of things were happening in\nthe world\nit was really the best thing to have at\nthe end of your week or the beginning of\nyour week to just get together and\nmeditate with people and then have a\ndiscussion whether people and you were\nso kind and you've all still we still do\nthis so you're still so kind to take\ntime out of your crazy schedule to\nanswer any questions or even give advice\nand sometimes it's just an open floor to\ntalk and express how everybody's feeling\nand it was so helpful for me but it's\nalso I think really been a wonderful\nexperience to give back to all my\nfriends and or at least to be able to\npresent a comfortable place where they\ncan just be themselves and talk about\ntheir emotions and not feel embarrassed\nabout it and it's been incredible yeah\nthe impressive part to me though was and\nobviously you gave me beautiful friends\nand family and people like Greg and you\nknow Vanessa Hudgens been on the show I\nmet her through the Zen Zone she talked\nabout she met cold\nher boyfriend her now boyfriend who\nplayed played for the Pittsburgh Pirates\nfor years and are my good friend Christo\nhe invited him one day on the zoom\nand then yeah then Vanessa met Cole\nthrough the zoo like and so there's been\nlike romance that's come from this but\nit's um it's really special and I'm glad\nwe we kept it up and and obviously\neveryone's life kind of got back to\nnormal but we still wanted to do it I\nI saw a few people last week and they\nwere like when are we doing it again we\nhave to do it again obviously uh it's\nbecome like a norm for us well that's\nwhat I was going to say that the\nimpressive part and now we'll put a bow\nin the Bromance and start getting to an\ninterview everyone has been listening\nbut the most impressive part is that we\ndid it for 75 weeks like I think when I\ncalculated it was like 75.85 maybe even\ndid a few more and I think it's that\nlevel of consistency that I admire in\nSomeone Like You uh you know anyone can\ndo one and anyone can be like inspired\nfor a week\nbut to be inspired and through our\nconversations I've continued to see that\nlike to be inspired and consistent with\nsomething for that long and then to\ninspire a community to do that it\nrequires someone really special so I I\nreally am so impressed by that and it\nbecame the model of how I work with so\nmany people where I realized that you\ntaught me that you were like hey just\ndon't make it a one-on-one like bring\npeople along for the journey and so you\nyou really inspired me in that way and\nanyone who ever asked for a meditation I\nstarted saying to them make sure you\ninvite your friends because Joe did this\nthing and it inspired me and and I\ngenuinely think it's changed the model\nof how I work with people well I feel\nlike as well you know what I miss so\ndearly was just that connection of being\naround my friends obviously everyone and\nfamily\nand I was also getting tired of these\nlike Zoom parties where you're playing\ngames and you're like all right this is\nnot happening this is not working for me\nanymore so the idea that you feel on an\nemotional level you can connect with\npeople\nand also there's a accountability of\nlike you kept your camera on and your\naudio on so everyone was able to be\nactually meditating with each other and\nfeel that difference oh because we know\nhow it usually goes when you're in a\nzoom meeting or party like half the time\nyou're hitting the mute button and\ncameras off you're doing something else\nor you're on a bicycle while you're\ndoing it so it was nice to be present\nand do it yeah let's let's uh get into\nit because I really wanna I really want\npeople to hear about your journey\nespecially your personal growth Journey\nthe journey you've been through of\ncourse as an amazing husband a father\nlike just you know this incredible\ngrowth Journey you've been on and I\nthink for people who've known you for\nsuch a long time I remember coming to\nevents last year and you've got all\nthese new Young audiences then you've\ngot audiences who've been with you for\nall these years when did you start\nrealizing you wanted to work on yourself\nlike when was that like a idea or a Thor\na seed when did it start there was a\nthere's been a few hurdles that I I felt\nlike I probably need to take care of\nmyself physically mentally\nI think the biggest one that comes to\nmind many years ago I released a solo\nalbum so I did a record alongside with\nmy brothers we kind of all started to\nfeel like we had separate personal\ninterests professionally\nand I made enough that I'm really proud\nof now I'd like it even more than I used\nto I think at the time there was a lot\nof cooks in the kitchen and when you're\nlike performing at the level that the\nJonas brothers were back when and you\nknow it was just\nchaos and craziness and and number one\nalbums and the song would break records\non YouTube and things were happening in\nreal time you kind of think like all\nright this is the norm like this is\ngonna happen for me too and I think\nthat's like obviously a really\nbizarre thing to even think about but\nthat started to become like okay\nanything we touch I think it's gonna\nreally take off\num and I had kind of a wake-up call when\nI released this album and it didn't\nperform as well as say the brother stuff\nand also forgot that the years and years\nof hard work that we put into the to the\nbrothers music to even get to a level\nwhere that many people are listening to\nour songs and I took it really hard but\nI didn't realize how I actually\nfelt in the moments I I figured\nokay well I'll just get back on the road\nand you know start promoting this and I\nhad like a bit of like a lifespan with\nthis album I knew that the next\nbrother's project or TV show or\nsomething was right around the corner so\nI had about a year and a half to really\nfocus in on this album called Fast Life\nand I was in I was here in New York\num after the album was\nout and it didn't really do much and\nstarted reading reviews started seeing\nthe reactions\nand it hit me like a ton of bricks\nand I started feeling like physically\nill and I really told myself and I\nbelieved that I was sick so I would go\nto the doctor\nI started going to the doctor like every\nother week and then it became like every\nweek and it was almost like a joke with\nmy friends we're like oh Sunday Funday\nJoe's going to the hospital again to get\na checkup I don't do like full body\ncheckups and look at the doctor and be\nlike Doc like you gotta like all right I\nwould do ultrasounds on my stomach I\nwould it became a thing where it was\ncomical because I'm like I'm I'm a\nhypochondriac I'm just I'm overthinking\nthese\nsymptoms or creating this in my mind and\none doctor finally just said to me\nthey're like have you\nthought or spoken to a therapist\nand I was like me no why would I why\nwould I ever need therapy life is great\nand um\nit kind of just hit me after I left and\nI was like oh my like oh my God maybe\nthey're right like the doctor's like I\nhave all of your results here from the\nlast like three visits and you have\nnothing wrong with you physically like\nyou're you're in great health\nbut obviously there's something going on\nand she's like I'm I would think I would\nthat's what I would suggest\nsure enough I started seeing somebody\nand I was like oh this is this is why\nbut right before that window where I\nstarted speaking to somebody I I would\nbe I was here in New York and I'd go on\nthese bike Journeys\nand I would ride my bike from like eight\nin the morning to eight at night and\nstop it along the way but\nit was like an escape for me and I and I\nwasn't able to look at my phone I wasn't\nable to think about\nuh the album I wasn't I was just a kind\nof\nchecking out so I was like still running\naway avoiding the problems but I thought\nthis was like oh this is what I needed\nyeah the minute I got the bike I'm\nfeeling sick again and so I started\ntalking to a therapist and really\ndove into all of that pain and Trauma\nthat I created for myself and and it it\nwas weird that it stemmed from something\nas simple as like oh the album didn't do\nas well as I thought what you think like\nit's not the biggest deal in the world\nbut I think in my brain I was pushing\nmyself so hard and I had these\nexpectations really set high that\nbrought me into the Walk of therapy and\nthen the Walk of\nmeditation with you and I mean that's\nyears and years later but um that's how\nI started kind of saying okay I think I\nneed to take care of myself and I'm not\nthis 15 year old kid anymore that can\njust\nrun run run run run and be fine yeah and\nit's it's amazing actually the other way\naround too I don't know if you've ever\nthought about it this way but it's like\nyou said like I shouldn't have maybe\nfelt that bad that this solo album\ndidn't do so well\nbut it's like how old were you when you\ndid the solo it's probably about 21 22\nyears old yeah yeah and so it's like\nyou're still a young adult yeah that's\nwhat I mean figuring it out you know\nexactly and you still and that's what I\nwonder it's almost like going away from\nsomething that was a Surefire win to try\nsomething new and potentially out there\nand risky and moving away from like a\nyou know tried and tested formula of the\nbrothers actually requires a lot of\ncourage and most people try and hang on\nto what's tried and true and would be\nscared to do what you did and so I think\nthere's also a lot of like yeah it took\na long time to come to that realization\nyeah yeah I those like Trend words\nflashing your brain like I saw a\nheadline like oh failure and I took that\nword and that was my identity with that\nalbum yeah and years later I was like\nwhat I I wouldn't even listen to the\nsongs as well and years later I started\nlistening to them again and obviously\ngoing through the work and realizing\nthat like you said yeah that Journey\nthat deep of Faith could actually do\nsomething else rather than just be\npigeon held to like this is the\ncomfortable place this is the\nbreadwinner I'm good here yeah I was\nlike all right I'm taking the leap of\nfaith on my own and that's a big enough\nit doesn't matter who how many people\nlisten to it if everybody loved it hated\nit whatever yeah yeah doing it for me\nand I lost touch with that yeah but that\ncommitment as well even at that early\nage when when was it you started to see\na therapist it was around that same time\nright about 21 22. yeah like that that\ncommitment to that\ntruly working on yourself in a\nreflective way like that's\nthat's a big deal even at even at that\nage like to accept that you need help\nthan to find help what was that like for\nthe rest of your family like how was\nother people reacting to it because I\nfeel like today when people try to seek\nhelp often it's in and I met your\nparents they're absolutely wonderful\nmany brothers they're they're wonderful\nlike you know I've met met all your\npartners I don't think I've met Kevin's\nuh wife but I've met you know both your\npartner yeah yeah I know I've interacted\nwith the family and so I'm like I can\nimagine that they were positive towards\nit but what was it like initially like\nhow does that feel like to your parents\nI think what you know our dad has been\nthe most incredible person to go to with\npretty much anything I mean he was a\nminister for many years then he was our\nmanager for a good amount of years\nthen around the same time he became like\nDad solely again which was actually\ngreat because we had I had like my dad\nto go to about stuff\num but you know when you start that\njourney of like seeking outside help\nit it is I I think as a parent it'd be a\nlittle bit it's going to take a a beat\nto realize like oh you're not the only\none that can give advice now but also I\nget it I you know I I think my parents\nare really mature in that sense where\nthey respect medical professionals so I\nthink if like the person has the the\ndegree to yeah to be able to uh give\nthat advice then I think that they're\ngoing to feel more comfortable I mean\nthat there's been people that I think\nI've gone to for advice that my dad was\nlike uh I'm gonna raise my hand and say\nthis is my opinion I don't know if this\nis the right person for you but let's\nfind somebody with like a couple\ndoctorates yeah yeah yeah that's right\nthat's bad that's good advice yeah I\nknow your parent your parents are so\nsweet when I met them because it's so\neasy to you know find anybody yeah like\nall right Google the closest therapist\nor person or life coach or whatever it\nmay be but to actually have somebody who\nknows is key yeah I love what you said\nthough about how like you're like you\nknow I had to realize that the brothers\nhad spent all these years building\nsomething and then obviously you're\ntrying to do something on your own like\nhow is your personal creative process\nchanged since then like how have you\nadapted since the first round of the\nbrothers to doing your own thing to now\ndoing yeah like how's how have you\nchanged that well it's changed quite a\nbit I feel like with dnce I had and for\nthose are listening or watching I'm in a\nband as well with my brothers called DNC\num we have a song cake by the ocean was\nour first song I wrote for the the band\nwith Justin tranner and great Tom thank\nyou great on stage and that\nsong and the way it took off actually\nwas the first bit of feeling of okay\nthis other style of music that I really\nlove to create\nI can also pursue and follow this\nbutterfly and see where it takes me\nbecause\nI can bring this back to the brother so\nI've been able to go on my own and I\ndidn't grow as a writer and a producer\nand and creator\nuh and have that time and then bring it\nback and it's really great now we have\nsuch respect for our individual ways of\nwriting and producing and and when Nick\nand I wrote Our most recent album\nwe had like two different rooms going so\nNick was writing something with\num somebody and I had another room going\nand we kind of like\nbrought the best doves and then came to\nthe table and said here's what I'm\nthinking here's what I'm thinking and we\nlike kind of work together we used to\njust argue our way through songwriting\nsessions or everybody wants the chorus\nyou know it's like I want the chorus my\nvoice sounds good on this and we're like\noh I really want to sing this because I\nkind of think it relates to something\nI'm going through more and as I was just\nlike now it's quite nice that we're\nmeeting each other\nreally at the same place yeah you know\nwe're all fathers we're all in this\ngreat place we're like not it's not like\none brother's like trying to find the\nnext yacht party and one's like tucking\na kid's into bed it's like we're really\nactually living the same place in our\nlives and that makes a huge difference\nwhen it comes to the music I think yeah\nyeah and the new music it feels that\nlyrically and we can actually tell this\ngrown-up story and and That's essential\nyeah that's so exciting to hear actually\nto hear about how if you're working in a\nteam when you're in a similar place in\nlife often there's a bit more empathy\nthere's a bit more understanding there's\na bit more I think it's it's comparable\nto like any career path yeah I mean if\nif you're writing a film with a a good\nfriend and\none wants to write a love story and the\nother's like no I want to write a war\nfilm and that's that's that there's\ngoing to be no love in it it's like\ndefinitely gonna be tough yeah and so I\nthink we felt that when we wrote songs\nit'd be like one person's going through\na heartbreak and the other is like well\nI just started seeing somebody yeah it's\nlike\nand I know that's really on the the\nromance front but that those heads\nbutted yeah also I've gotten the\nopportunity in the last couple years to\nwrite music for film and TV and I love\nputting a thinking cap on of somebody\nelse so playing I'm thinking as the\ncharacter yeah what would they feel and\nwhat Mo so everything during the\nlockdown I wrote up song for\num an animated film called Rumble about\nlike wrestling monsters\nputting on a thinking cap of like all\nright what would they sing about yeah\nand then um just recently wrote a song\nfor the film I shot last year devotion I\nthe director about six months later\nasked me if I would be interested in\nwriting the end credit song so I got to\nto write with Ryan Tedder and harv who\nwrote um he was a born of the original\npeaches for Justin Bieber and um I got\nmy buddy Khalid a part of the song\num and that was a really special\nexperience because I also got to think\nabout what it was like\nfor the main character in the film and\nhis relationship and how it was\ncomparison to my relationship\nand people that are just away from their\nfamilies and friends a lot and just what\nthat feeling of you don't have to feel\nlike you're alone I'm always there for\nyou whether if it's spiritual or\nmentally it takes that mindset yeah I\nmean that was a lot of the crew for\ndevotion they were the ones that were\npart of uh Zen zone right so it was cool\nexpensive it's really special yeah I\nmean uh actors at least the actors I've\nrun into meditation is so key on set I\nmean when you're having even if it's\nlike a split second where you have to\nget into character and\njust take a second and get it and be\nlike all right where am I where did I\njust come from and it may sometimes be a\nlittle conversation in your own head and\nI found it immensely helpful in scenes\nsome of the tools you've given me that\num I keep in my back pocket and uh I use\nwhether it fits on stage or I'm about to\nhit a terrible golf shot and I can think\nof all right breathe in four times hold\nfirst yeah I can't improve anyone's golf\ngame that I can't even prove my own so\nthat's yeah\nmy meditation doesn't someone told me\nmeditation and golf uh hey man there's a\nbook there yeah there's like that when I\nwhen I get good I go but tell me about\nthat transition because I think like you\nknow I've seen you on stage you're a\nnatural performer I always I always tell\nyou like I see these pictures come on\nlike dude you just remind me of Freddie\nMercury who I love right like who I I\nlove like Queen was my favorite bang up\nand and so any footage I've ever seen of\nwatching Freddie Mercury live is just\nunbelievable and so\nthat comes very naturally to you've done\nit for a long time what was it that even\ngave that shift when I heard you were\nacting and because you'd just for\neveryone to realize too you'd be on set\nlike you'd be in all these random\nlocations then like logging into zen\nZone on your phone and like but what was\nwhat brought that transition about like\nwhere where did that impetus come from\nor like where did that excitement come\nfrom yeah well when I was much younger I\nalways wanted to act I always wanted to\nI like I always put on a show in our\nbasement I had the Joe showed it was\nlike a talk show that I put on and\nimitated uh late night talk shows and\nthen there was a popular TV series on\nthat Nickelodeon called all that that\nwas like a kid's version of SNL and I\nwanted to be a part of that show I was\nlike these kids are allowed to be wacky\nand fun on TV this is amazing yeah um\nand then years later you know doing\nstuff with Disney we did Camp Rock and\nwe always like dabbled in in film and TV\nand I and I had opportunities along the\nway but music was always my main focus\nand that took up a lot of time and the\nlimited amount of weeks or months of the\nyear that I\nwas making an album or it was a little\nbit quiet season we're still like\nwe're still working\num and not until really the lockdown\nwhere I saw an opportunity of time and\num started auditioning and\nhaving conversations I had a\nconversation with JD the director of\ndevotion which I I just straight up told\nhim like look I know I'm not the first\nchoice\nI get that simply because I'm I don't\nhave the credits to prove that I could\ndo this but I will work so hard for you\nI will prove to you that I can do this\nand I send myself a tape in and it was a\nlife-changing experience I mean I'm\nlucky that I'm a part of a film like\nthat or I should say I'm very grateful\nthat I'm a part of film like that where\nI'm surrounded by such great talent and\njust soaking it up I knew day one's\nshowing up on set Jonathan Majors who\nplays Jesse Brown in the one of our\nleads of the film I mean he was in\ncharacter at the table read in his\nflight suit\nand I was like oh okay this is\nthis is real yeah and um I just felt so\nexcited to just learn and\num it's a bit addictive because\nwhen you have somebody that is that in\ncharacter all the time it rubs off on\nyou so like all the other guys we\nstarted dressing in 1950s clothes and\nthen we started\nlike afterwards I still was shaving\nevery day like they were in the Navy and\nI just like I loved that aspect of it\nwhere you really try to dive in yeah and\nyou were working out a lot too right\nlike I swear during that movie you're\nlike well all these I'll tell you what I\nshowed I showed uh the day the fitting\nwas I showed up to set\nand I saw all these photos\nmostly just like shirtless photos of\nthese actors and I was like\noh I need to get I need to get like I\nthought my two days was was enough yeah\nand he's like I gotta and they're like\nlooking at their ages and I was like man\nthis guy's like six yeah seven years\nyounger than me I was like all right I\ngotta keep up with these kids uh but\nyeah it inspired me to like work out and\nwe did a lot of military training where\nwe were like we were doing group runs\nand\num you know just working out on set a\nlot because we're just sitting around\nand and I think that's why\nmeditation really came in handy working\nout came in handy on set what they don't\ntell you about being in these\nbeautiful films is that there's a lot of\ndowntime yeah I love waiting around yeah\nand if you're not number one\nor two on the call sheet then you're\nprobably just hanging out and waiting\nfor them to be like we need you in the\nbackground so\num a lot of times spent and I was just\nlike built a little workout yeah I built\na gym in my back of my car essentially\nand I just would and I had a shower so\nif I got sweaty I would just shower in\nthe trailer and then get ready again and\nwow meditation I mean we do a Zen zones\non set we would do these zooms where we\ndid meditation on set and it was really\namazing where did that work have to come\nfrom for you because that's what I was\ntalking about earlier right like you're\ndiscipline your ability to apply your\nmind your consistency like those things\nare not always common because you know\nespecially when you're being autistic\nand creative sometimes you need\nspontaneity and you sometimes just have\nlike an autistic moment but you've been\nable to balance the two like where did\nthat work ethic develop like how early\nwas that when did that was that from\nparenting was that from my brother is\nlike where did that come from you know I\nI chopped some of it up to my hair my\nparents\num they worked really hard I mean I\nwatched I didn't really click I mean my\ndad you know he was very much in debt\nputting his energy focused money into\nthe brothers when we started I mean the\nguy was like three four jobs he was\ndriving\nevery day from New Jersey\nyou drive us to the city to record a\nsong drive us back means like an hour\neach way if you're lucky and there's no\ntraffic and then on weekends he's a\nminister it's just like wow jokingly a\nlot of hats and also catering to like an\nentire church yeah their stuff yeah um\nso some of that and also I think just\nwhen it comes down to it I just want to\nkeep pushing myself and I also I'm so\ngrateful that I get to do what I love\nfor living every day I wake up and write\na gratitude list and on that list it's\nusually one of the top four things is\nI'm grateful that I get to do what I\nlove for a living every single day\nespecially when there's so many people\nout there and there's so much music\nconstantly coming out and on the acting\nside there's so many great actors out\nthere that are constantly you're you're\nseeing and and to be a part of a film\nlike that or to have music pop up on\nSpotify new music Friday or wherever it\nmay be I'm like\nI am so immensely grateful that I get to\ndo this and continue to get to do this\nand that makes me want to work even much\nthat much harder because I I don't want\nto just say okay you know what the\nbrothers are big enough we're playing\nthese big venues\nI was like great this is a nice paycheck\nI'm I'm you'll see me every year guys\nit's like no I want to like how do we\nmake this I can't even make the music\nbetter how do we make or bigger a bigger\nmeaning like sonically and how do we um\nhow do we connect more with our fan base\nand where they're out in their life\nbecause\nthey're growing up with us and they have\nand it feels so great when we can listen\nto the music and say\nI'm so proud of this because it connects\non so many different points and I'm not\nbeing a part of a film like devotion\nemotionally a beautiful true story\num and other things that I'm working on\njust I try to make sure that I'm really\npassionate about it yeah yeah and that\ncomes across and I love that point you\nmade about your parents I mean I think\nabout that often when my parents who are\nboth immigrants now my mom moved to\nLondon when she was 16 years old which I\ncan't imagine what that feels like you\nknow English is not their first language\nand then you're starting out from\nscratch like nothing and then when I was\nshe was like making us breakfast me and\nmy sister dropping us to school going to\nwork\ngetting us picked up in the evening\nmaking us dinner like you know just like\ntaking care of us and I just I always\nlook at my mom's work ethic and I think\nthat's I can I feel that similarity\nwhere I'm like I work this hard because\nI saw my mom work that hard 100 yeah and\nlike the humble beginnings it really is\nlike\nI'm really\nglad the way we grew up like I mean\nthere was a moment where all four boys\nare in one bedroom and four boys meaning\nour youngest at the time was a the\nyoungest brother was yeah he's a baby\nand more like teenagers and we're\nstarting this band we'd be play these\nbig stages and go back and sleep in the\nsame bedroom\nand at the time I hated it because I was\nlike Ugh but it's also now I'm like\nthat's what made me who I am today and\nyeah I I think if it was a different\nsituation I don't know if I would be in\nthe same mindset yeah speaking about\nthat they're like one thing I've noticed\nwith you uh from the time we have spent\ntogether and even with everyone else\nwhether it's online or offline it's like\nyou're super grounded you make everyone\nfeel comfortable around you like I\nremember when we were like hanging out\nlast year in New York and you know I'm\nalways mindful I'm like are you sure you\nwant to go there like you know is you\ngonna be surrounded by people and like\nyou were so cool when people came up and\nyou know you'd always bump into groups\nof people who were just happy to say\nhello to you and you've always you seem\nvery comfortable with obviously you've\ndone it for a long time but you're very\ncomfortable with people you're very easy\nwith people you're very grounded I I\ndon't I don't notice ego and arrogance\nwhen I talk to you when I talk to see\nhow you deal with your team your friends\neveryone in your life and it's really\nbeautiful to watch and I I really\nappreciate that because when I was in\nthe monastery it was like the most we\nwere trained to believe that the most\nadmirable quality in someone was\nhumility like that was seen as like the\nthe crown jewel of all qualities was if\nsomeone could be extremely accomplished\nbut be humble and that doesn't mean that\nthey think they're worthless it just\nmeans that right they still treat\neveryone with respect and I I see that\nin you and so I wonder was arrogance and\nego ever a challenge was that ever or\nwas that just like obviously we all have\nit when we're young and it goes away or\nwas it something that you got more used\nto with Fame like how did I just want to\nhear your story with that because I feel\nlike\nyeah it's just special watching you\nwhere you are now and just how\neffortless it is it's it's interesting\nbecause there's been definitely times I\nfeel like I've been\num affected by the feeling of being on\nstage and feeling Larger than Life at\ntimes you know this feeling is like you\nknow you're I only way to put it is like\nthe quarterback that wins the high\nschool football game like we're doing it\nevery night on stage that that energy\nand people screaming your name yeah it's\njust a Trippy you know and it definitely\ncan affect you and also make you like\nfeel out of touch with reality at times\nI am really grateful that I've had two\nguys to do this with\num Brothers keep you pretty accountable\nand comfortable\nand we stopped each other around a lot I\nthink that\nhumble beginnings was also essential\nlike don't forget where you came from\nand all those things are so easy to just\nforget I just moved to LA and get a big\nhouse and like you're retired I'm like\nwhatever don't talk to me I'm I'm hiding\nout and to each their own I just\num I still don't know what the\ningredient was but I think the magic\ningredient was but I think it's a bunch\nof different things and I think also\njust getting older and like\nfinding my own like happiness outside of\nthe brothers outside of Music outside of\nfilm or TV just like on my own personal\nfront of being able to you know a bit of\nseparates church and state in that sense\nwhere it's it's nice to just have\nsomething for myself and soap and I am\nspeaking to her obviously we've my wife\nfor those who don't know what to talk\nabout um or who I'm talking about you\nknow we were very\nparticular with like sharing our\nrelationships so we we didn't really\npost anything about our relationship to\nlike we were engaged like\num and it was nice for the first time to\nactually just have something for us for\nme\num that I didn't feel like I needed to\nshare with the world and\num I think you know she is also keeps me\nhumble and accountable and it's um been\namazing to have a partner like her I\nwind up my wife all the time because\nshe's she does the same thing to me like\nmy wife keeps me so humble and so\ngrounded right and so I'll wind her up\nby saying really egotistic things around\nher all the time just to see how she\nreacts and she never takes it as a joke\nlike to her it's like oh so you can't\neven joke about being arrogant I can't\nlook in the mirror a certain way\nyeah well I can't look in selfies of\ncertain way if I look at it she's like\nwhy are you doing that part like what is\nwrong with you I mean she yeah she'll\nshe'll tell me straight up she'll be\nlike\nyou're not gonna wear it with those\nshoes right yeah quote like yesterday I\nwas like well I was planning on it but\nand there's like obviously a lot of\ngreat things that come from it yeah I'm\nsaying that's funny things but I think\nit's been really helpful to have outside\nof Brothers even like accountability\nwhen it comes to fame yeah having a\npartner who's like supportive and also\nuh trustworthy and\nand you you know has your back but also\nwill\nwe'll keep your head on straight yeah\ndefinitely I couldn't agree more I I\nthink about that all the time that I\ncan't imagine how hard it is to create\nthen obviously Sophie has an incredible\ncareer herself as well so it it makes it\nsomewhat more understanding but I I with\nmy life it's like I met radhi before\neverything happened\nand so it's been really wonderful to be\nunderstood in that way as well like\nthat's incredible yeah there's like a\nsense of challenge as well yeah like as\nyou're becoming this amazing influential\nperson and there's so much coming at you\nto have a support and obviously she also\nhas an amazing career yeah but it's also\nto see you both like do your thing and\nbe supportive and like you know\nthe days you can of the week that you\ndon't get to see your partner It's just\ntough and so I know in my life I just\nwork really hard so I can be home more\nyeah and um that's been\nso something I've learned you know that\nI I enjoy time off because I used to\njust be like I have a week off oh I'm\nwhere what city am I going to and now\nI'm like I actually understand why it's\nnice to just chill right you got\nadorable children too Ted thank you yeah\nI'd say I think just incredibly grateful\nto be a dad yeah that's an amazing\nfeeling yeah what do you think you've\nlearned by first we'll start with being\nin a relationship like what do you think\nyou learned\nabout yourself or something that you\ngrew by being with Sophie that you\ndidn't have before like a a skill and\nability a mindset an approach to life\nwhat what came through that relationship\nwith Sophie that it's not some like cute\nrelationship that you just\nyou have I've had my fun I've dated\nbefore plenty but what it's just so\ndifferent with soap is that I that blew\nme away it's just like\nthe Forgiveness the the partner the\nfriend that I have like we're each\nother's best friends and we grow\ntogether I mean so many different\namazing experiences that we've had and\njust five some years it's just trippy to\nus we're like oh we really have lived a\nlife and um\nuh it's just been\namazing to like at times save each other\nyou know we've gone through so many\nheavy things together as a couple and\nindividuals and to know you have that\nsupport no matter what it's just amazing\nyeah I love hearing that man it's\nbeautiful and yeah I agree with there's\nso many things\nthat you can go on and on about but\nyeah I feel the same way like when I met\nRobbie it's like\nI don't think I ever knew what\na genuine like understanding\nrelationship look like like yeah like I\nfeel understood yeah I remember there\nwas a big moment in our relationship\nwhere we were had a rocky\nphase and I like called it off and\nshe\nwas understanding and that blew my mind\nyeah that somebody could be and you\nbreak up with someone and they\nunderstand yeah and I panicked and got\nback with her like right away\nbut it was the best that's amazing\nobviously the best decision ever I was\nnot the breakup part that was the\ndumbest decision but I realizing like\nthe fact that she would be supportive\nand I'm not saying I was in the right in\nany way I realized that this person is\nloves me so much that they were willing\nto put aside their stuff for me and I'm\nlike what the like how how could I ever\nlose that yeah\num and especially yeah it's really\nspecial that's beautiful what about what\nabout with the kids like becoming a dad\nlike that's another these were major\nlife transitions right like going from\nbeing with the brothers to then\ndoing your solo thing then coming to\ntherapy figuring that out then you know\nthese all major life Transitions and I\nthink I'm not a dad yet so I'm always\nintrigued to get get Dad tips and uh I\nmean will I join many many meditations\nmany Zen zones which is very sweet but\nlike yeah what what would you say have\nbeen the greatest lessons and that for\nyou or like the biggest yeah the biggest\nthe simplest greatest I mean there's so\nmany I got\namazing advice before I became a father\njust before becoming a parent I I\nreached out to like my favorite people\nthat are parents\nand the ones that I really respect how\nthey raise their kids\nI had a lot of questions for them but\nthe biggest question was like if you can\ngive me one\nbig piece of advice and almost all of\nthem and this sounds just kind of cliche\nbut they're just like literally\nenjoy every moment because it moves by\nso fast and I think about my own father\nand I'm thinking I'm like you know he\nblinks and I'm like his sons are in his\n30s he's like most of his sons and it's\njust like and I'm a big kid at heart and\nI also like I I encourage other parents\nto just be a big kid another person\nmentioned you know\nthey watched their son\nthey watched us like somebody walked by\nwith their child over a puddle\nand that parent was like no no we don't\njump in puddles\nand he was like I never want to be that\nparent I want to be the parent that like\nexplores that because you know what\nthere's plenty of clothes at home you\ncan change into and like that\nimagination is so important for young\nkids and I had that growing up and I\nwant to be like that\num I understand if you're on your way\nsomewhere fancy whatever I get there's\nthere's obviously tons maybe jump into\nthe puddles not the always the best but\nlike\nthe message there is yeah imagination is\nso key and\nif if I was ever held back from like\nbeing wacky and silly and putting a show\non for my family or friends in my\nbasement\nI wouldn't be where I am today if I if I\ndidn't love the music if I didn't if I\nwasn't allowed to listen to music that I\nlistened to and there's a lot of things\nand I didn't get it that's a big\nquestion those are I mean it's a big\ncomment there are music there's certain\nmusic I didn't get to listen to it\ngrowing up but I will say like\nI it molded me to who I am today and I I\nthink the imagination thing is so key\nyeah no I I think that's a beautiful\npoint and it's it's interesting how\nthat's really coming out in child\npsychology now like everything you're\nsaying I think\nis true because we're seeing through the\nresearch that when kids are too limited\nor restricted or put into this like\nruled system of like this is right and\nthis is wrong and this is okay and this\nisn't like as a child it definitely\nlimits your understanding I mean I mean\nI've been actually interviewing a ton of\npeople who are like child trauma experts\nor people who've like deeply studied\nthat area and it aligns with what you're\nsaying and so it's it's beautiful to\nhear that and it's nice to hear that you\nhad it and you continue to pass it on oh\nyeah and I think one of the the most\namazing things I've done\nand I haven't framed at home\nthis is one of my first experiences in\ntherapy and the therapist asked me to\nwrite a letter to like essentially they\nasked me to think about what I see when\nI when I'm like when you say okay\nand I I'm no therapist so excuse me for\npresenting this and and you probably\nknow this method but I want you to write\na letter to yourself as a kid knowing to\nthink of that age so for me it was\nbetween ages a like seven and ten\num and they're like all right now like I\nwant you to like look at it there's an\nempty chair like I want you to look at\nthe empty chair\nand really visualize yourself like\nvisualize yourself like what are you\nwearing how's your hair look are you\nwhat are you playing with are you like\nsitting there are you are you nervous\nare you distracted I'm like I can see\nmyself essentially and then I wrote a\nletter to myself\nand like to my younger self like oh yeah\nyou know like maybe don't date this\nperson like whatever just like funny\nlittle things to even like personal\nthings\nlike it's okay to like be a weirdo like\nif you get picked on for that that's\ncool and one day those guys are gonna\ncome to your concert like whatever like\njust funny things and then I wrote a\nletter to myself as an adult but as an\neight-year-old self\nand I couldn't get through the I mean\nI'm bawling crying trying to write this\nletter and I wrote it with my the hand\nI'm not strong I'm not very strong with\nso I wrote my left hand so it's really\nsquibbly like squiggly\nand uh I have the letter framed in my\nhouse it was just such a great reminder\nto yeah to be a kid at heart and to like\nnot be too hard on ourselves yes we're\nall big kids at the end of the day\ntrying to figure this crazy thing called\nlife out yeah totally I love that\nexercise I think it's such an important\none and it's like everyone should\ndefinitely do that oh it's amazing I\nmean I found it to be an emotional thing\nsome people find it to be a fun and game\nbut uh whatever it is I I loved it and I\npassed it on yeah no I think it's so I\nthink it's so powerful what are other\nthings that like we've talked about\nmeditation of course and I'd love to\nknow more of you practice now as well\nbut what are some other habits that\nyou've picked up along the way it sounds\nlike you're a collector of like\ndefinitely yeah you know like yeah I I\nlike to think I'm a collector the\ngratitude list you talked about you talk\nabout this this letter to kids we talked\nabout meditation like what are some of\nthe others all collections from other\npeople that's good but uh I think the\nmost recent are direct the director of\ndevotion JD right above his monitors he\nhad what do you want them to feel and\nI just fell in love with that little\nquote and I wrote it\non a mirror in the dressing room\num that we traveled with so it wasn't\njust writing on some vaccine like left\nit for everyone some random bathroom\nthere and that really helps me before I\ngo onto stage like what do I want them\nto feel especially after like a long day\nlet's say your voice is tired you're\nmentally drained or you're like all\nright we're playing the same show like\ngotta find like like what about and then\nthat always reminds me I'm like there's\nsomebody out there that's their favorite\nsong or look for that person or if\nI'm tired like these people spend all\ntheir day getting ready for today like I\nwant them to like if I went to a concert\nand I it takes me a lot to go see a show\nbecause I I'm like all right this has\ngot to be somebody I really want to see\nyeah you want to see the what you think\nis like you want to leave going that was\namazing like how do I bring that for\nthem and same like for our directors of\nwhat do you want them to feel and\num it's really powerful so I I I've\ntaken that along the way\num my morning routine is I think pretty\nlocked in now\nmy streaks are pretty good on my\nmeditation app so like I pretty much\nwake up and the first thing I do is\nmeditate sometimes it's like a moving\nmeditation where I'm like I can be\nbrushing my teeth or doing something but\nI'm like in silence and I'm just kind of\nwalking through the steps\nand then I write a gratitude list and\nit's anywhere from\nI'm grateful for the beautiful morning\nI'm grateful for a cup of coffee this\nwill keep me going or to like a larger\nI'm grateful for my health like the fact\nthat I get to be able to walk on two\nfeet and and do this and and obviously\nthe list goes on and then I'm working on\nmy Italian so really don't quiz me but\nI'm gonna slowly slowly working on that\nwhat's the why are you telling\nspecifically the movie right we um we\nwent to Italy on our honeymoon\nand I just\ndid not like that I had to like be my\nhands were held by our translator the\nwhole trip so I'm on this romantic trip\nand then I'm like\ndo you mind asking if they have any more\nand I'm just like embarrassed but also\nlike I took that and it was like I want\nto go back here on our own yeah and like\nnot have to have anybody helping us out\nit was like that brought me and then\njust\nItaly's amazing yeah it is I'd love to\nlearn more I love that I love what you\nwere saying earlier because I think that\nmindset for anyone who's performing\nanyone who's done this for a long time\nlike you know I think a lot of people\nmost most people who don't know me well\ndon't know that I started speaking on\nstages and at events when I was 18 years\nold and so I'd done what I'd done for 10\nyears before anyone cared or knew what\nit was and\nwhen I when I hear what you're saying\nit's like when you've done it for that\nlong\nI I became more grateful when people\nactually cared because I was like I've\nbeen in this for 10 years and like five\npeople showed up and so you know when\nyou start doing it and more people care\nand more people are interested you\nbecome more grateful but there was\nsomething beautiful there was an\ninterview with\nVanessa Bryant uh Kobe's Brian's wife\nafter he passed away and she was telling\na story actually I think she was giving\na speech and she told this conversation\nthat she had with Kobe\nand she said that\nyou know people always ask Kobe\nwhy he played when he was injured or a\nlot of people didn't know that he played\nwhen he was injured but every time I'd\nask him why he played when he was\ninjured he'd said that I'd played\nbecause that person\nhas saved up\nto come and watch one game and they want\nme to play in that game they came to\nwatch me\nunbelievable and if I don't play then\nthey won't have got to see me and they\nmay not be able to afford to go to\nanother game ever again\nand so I'm gonna play even if I'm\ninjured\nand every time I think about that and\nit's exactly what I heard in the essence\nof what you were saying that it's like\npeople have come here to see us it's\nlike what do you want them to feel like\nwhen you live in that way it's like\nevery show becomes it's your first time\nright it feels that way because it's\nthat person's first time even if it's\nnot yours and I think that mindset is so\nbeautiful and so special and you see it\nacross all these amazing people who who\nperform for a living who are doing this\nweek and week out and the fact that you\nshare that it it speaks volumes for\nanyone out there who's wanting a career\nin this light whatever it may be any\ncareer that's on stage you've got to\nhave that in your heart because\notherwise it gets really boring really\nunfulfilling and really dry really\nquickly so anyway you reminded me of\nthat that's a beautiful story yeah and I\nhad to share it\nwhat a legend he had found strength even\nwhen he's injured it's amazing yeah it's\namazing but but I like that what do you\nwant to make people feel I think that\nthat's such a great way to live like you\njust given a mantra for life like even\nif you're not a performer I know I feel\nlike it's just in general being more\npresent with somebody I mean you know\nthere's there's times feel like you\ncan't really even bring a lot to the\ntable literally dinner table somebody\ncalls you say hey you want to get dinner\ntonight and you've been running running\nrunning you're like\nI don't think I can give you 100 of\nmyself mentally or physically even like\njust to be in your presence like I just\nuh it's okay to give either rain check\nsome past on the rain check sometimes\nyou're just like I I want you to be able\nto have my full attention and\num I try to put that into play more\noften how have you managed to keep so\nmany good relationships like during this\nbusy career or a hectic career like it's\nmost people end up becoming lonely and\nsuccessful\nright and when we did Zen Zone I got to\nmeet all these wonderful human beings\nyeah and it wasn't just people in the\nindustry like it wasn't like a I just\nsent a note out and whoever comes it was\nlike these are people that know you and\nyou know and like when we would talk and\nlike you know there'd be banter back and\nforth and you could tell that there was\na real relationship of course there's\nbandmates there there's people but it's\nlike how have you met I'm intrigued by\nthat idea because I think it's less\ncommon and I think it's fascinating that\nit's not just the amount first of all\nyou have a quantity of relationships as\nwell but they're also quality as well\nlike what did you do to do that\nI've had the same kind of friend crew\nfor a long time\num I think the older you get your your\nfriends gets tighter some of which like\nyou said I'm lucky that I get to work\nwith some of my friends I mean that's\nsometimes a dangerous game but I think\nyeah we've worked long enough where\nwe've like we're still friends even if\nwe've gone and done different career\npaths and come back together but\num I think it's been\nessential just to get I think I always\nneed face time and I don't mean by\nFaceTime on the phone I'm like literally\nFaceTime with that person\num or people and I\nI think it's really important for the\nrelationship and just checking in you\nknow I think it's so interesting how\nsomebody gave me this advice years ago\nwhen we see our friends like going\nthrough something\num\nwe know they're going through they've\nlost in the family or a situation that's\npretty heavy\nand we usually\nyou think like I don't want to bother\nthem right now\nand a lot of people are thinking that\nmore than you would think and how easy\nit is to pick up the phone or just shoot\na text\num I've been trying to implement\nImplement that a little bit more I'm\nstill not great at it but I definitely\nknow that like it's something that I\nhave felt on the other side when I'm\ngoing through something kind of heavy\nand like people might go like I just\nwant to give them space maybe they need\nmaybe I shouldn't pretend like I know\nit's like it's somewhat nice to to be\nreached out to or to reach out that's\nbeautiful man and I know you do that I\nthink that's the thing but I'm sitting\nin this interview and the whole time\nI've been thinking like this guy\nactually does everything he's saying he\ndoes and it's I genuinely respect it\nit's so hard to to really walk your talk\nit's so hard to like really emphasize\nevery you know I remember even you know\njust when when we were traveling\ntogether last year for that for a couple\nof the shows and it was just you know\nyou were going through so many family\nthings as well in between yeah and and\nso you were constantly there and\navailable and trying to make sure you\nknow trying to figure it out and like\nthat was what you guys were talking\nabout like you know so you could tell\njust how much love and how much\nconnection there was there with you know\nwith family and when you look at family\nfamily is obviously such a central\npillar to your life like in every sense\nof the word the brothers your parents\nyour your wife your kids you know like\nthe fact that the crew family the team\nfamily like if you had to give not\nadvice but your reflection on like\nwhat keeps family to get together\ndespite so many differences despite\ndoing business together just like what\nhave you what have you come up with\nbecause there has to be something that\nkeeps someone after all this time like\ninspired to keep family together when it\nand it's not just business right it's\nmore than that I think we learned\na while back that\nif it's just business 24 7 which it was\nlike it would implode which it did we\nbroke up as a band and we wanted pretty\nmuch nothing to do with each other for a\nwhile\nand when we decided to get back together\nas a band there was a lot of like all\nright we have a lot to work through and\nwe did but once we stepped back into\nthis crazy world of what we do\nwe made sure that we tried to take some\ntime just for us as brothers as a family\nlike\ngo on trips together like that's that's\nmidnight let's not talk about work and\nit's weird because work is also like\nwhat we love so music does come up but\nthere are moments where we're like let's\njust go ski together let's go play golf\nI mean golf is kind of our that's the\none thing I guess we all can relate on\nI'm not I mean we just went played golf\nfor next birthday I mean this guy can\nplays like 36 holes in one day and then\nhe's like all right cool we're gonna do\nthat seven a.m tomorrow I'm like buddy I\nneed a break\num so\nwe we have hobbies outside yeah yeah\nwork that I think that's essential for\nus and even like with our my parents and\nstuff like just hanging out you know\nlet's let's challenge each other without\ntalking about business because we're\nstill like in a business with our dad at\ntimes we're in and out always like it it\nalways we can't help ourselves because\nwe all love music we all love what we do\nwe love supporting each other but it is\nnice to to say you know what let's just\nnot talk about let's just do something\nas a family or as friends as brothers\nand keep that relationship healthy as\nmuch as we can yeah Joe you've been so\ngenerous with your time I want everyone\nwho's listening and watching to know\nthat it's currently Friday

excited to\nshow the stage with some of these\nlegendary acts I can always say that I I\nplayed a show with Metallica yeah never\nthought I'd be saying that yeah it's\nawesome but no I'm so grateful for your\ntime is there anything that I haven't\nasked you that you really wanted to\nshare or something that was on your\nheart or mind and you're like I really\nwant to talk about this but I didn't I\nfeel like you did it we kind of tapped\ninto it a little bit on like the daily\npractices but one thing I've recently\ndone I kind of stole from\nGreg over there\num which has been helpful actually I\nlike recently deleted social media off\nmy phone oh wow and it's been like and\nI'll still like download Instagram\noccasionally just to check in on\nmessages because it's like literally a\nnew email at this point but I it's been\nnice because I just needed the break and\nit's been really helpful to be present\nwith my friends and family and I know\nthere's other ways of doing it I'm not\nsaying it's bad for you I mean there's\nthere's other ways of of of like setting\nthe alarms and timers but for me to not\neven have it on my phone I'll tell you\nwhat I'm just like so much more aware\nand and goes the full circle like being\npresent with my friends I'm just like\nway more like in it which has been\nreally nice I love that man that's and\nthat's hard but the only thing I miss is\nlike a couple funny memes my friends\nwill send me other than that I feel like\nI'm pretty like aware which is nice yeah\nyeah I mean and I've been loving all\nthis spontaneous tick tocks oh yeah it's\nbeen a lot of fun yeah I can't yeah I'll\nget back on there eventually um I I love\nthat\nI can showcase that first my wacky\npersonality like I got more people\ncoming up to me on the street these days\nsaying I like your Tick Tock than your\nmusic and I'm like all right I was doing\nan interview the other day and I'm sat\noutside having coffee and this young\nlady came up and she's like excuse me\nand I was like this is perfect timing\nI'm about to do an interview and she's\nlike I love your tick tock not\nunexpected but I appreciate it I\nappreciate it and then like I was like I\nguess I should ask about your Tick Tock\nthat's awesome I love that man no and\nI'm glad you shared that I think it's so\nimportant to take these breaks to to\ndisconnect to be present but we end\nevery interview with the final five uh\nand these are Fast Five so one word to\none sentence maximum uh so you got to be\non your toes which you're very good at\nso here are your final five Joe Jonas uh\nthe first question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever received there's a\nlot I mean I think this has been\nessential for uh growing up my dad\nalways said live like you're at the\nbottom bottom even if you're at the top\nnot saying I'm at the top and I never\nwas but I I I think I've gotten\nto a place where I could be feeling\nmyself and that's been that brought back\nthat's great to go back to Humble\nbeginning conversation that's a great\npiece of advice all right we've never\nhad that on the show I love it uh\nquestion number two what's the worst\nadvice you've ever heard this isn't\ngonna hurt and then um I got my first\ntattoo\nthat's true yeah that was bad advice I\nlike that all right question number\nthree uh what's something you used to\nvalue that you don't value anymore and\nmaybe it's just for the time being but\nsocial media I mean I I've taken this\nbreak I realized it's really needed for\nmy life yeah yeah taking a little time\noff and just nice to be aware and\npresent and so I thought that was like\nyeah 40 minutes of my day in the day\njust\nscrolling myself to bit you know to bed\nbeing like now I'm dreaming about goats\nlaughing on a mountain why\num great but you know it's like I can\njust go to bed yeah no it's huge that's\na huge one or wake up and not feel like\nanxiety from seeing some craziness it's\njust nice to be like present and aware\nor be like jealous you're not\nsomewhere in the world with these people\nthat you that you sometimes see you're\nlike okay I'm with myself or my friends\npeople that I love it's quite nice\nthat's a beautiful answer beautiful\ndescription all right question number\nfour is how would you define your\ncurrent purpose I think to just be open\nto learning and growing I think I'm\nrealize that what I do is really\nincredible because I can make people\nfeel a certain way and conduct a crowd\nin a sense and I'm one of many but few\nthat get that opportunity and\num I know how how great of an\nopportunity that is and so yeah I think\nmy purpose is to make people feel yeah\nhopefully good\nmore emotional at times for the song\ndefinitely good definitely good uh Fifth\nand final question if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow what would it be be nicer to\neveryone be nice to people yeah we\ndefinitely need
