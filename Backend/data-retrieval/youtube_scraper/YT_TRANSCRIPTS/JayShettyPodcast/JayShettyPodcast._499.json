    "transcript": "and the path really to success in my\nopinion is to be able to align those\nokay what am I feeling and then to\nreflect intellectually is that the right\nthing if I'm going to the best-selling\nauthor and host the number one Health\nand Wellness podcast on purpose with Jay\nShetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now I know you're\nhere because you love learning about new\ninsights ideas principles that can\ntransform your life things that you can\nput into practice ideas that you can\nactually take into your life apply them\nand see changes in transformation happen\ntoday's guest is one of the few guests\nwho's been on not just once not just\ntwice but a third time I don't think\nthere's more than three guests out of\nour entire library that have been on as\nmany times as today's guest and I\ncouldn't be more excited to talk to him\nthe first time I spoke to him we're\nspeaking about his book principles an\nincredible book if you haven't read it\nhighly recommend that you get it uh next\ntime we spoke we spoke about a second\nbook changing World Order and the third\none this interview we're talking about\nhis new Journal called my principles\nI've been flicking through this over the\npast few days since I've had it and it\nhas given me so much self-awareness that\nI already believe I have but the\nopportunity to reflect on it again and\nagain consistently makes a huge\ndifference of course I'm talking about\nthe one and only Ray Dahlia Ray thank\nyou for being here thank you for doing\nthis Jay it's such a pleasure all of\nthese times I love it yeah it's a joy to\nsee you after three years we did one\ndigital interval maybe even two I think\nwe did in the middle of the pandemic\nmaybe this is your fourth time actually\nmaybe I'm completely wrong but either\nway I'm just always grateful to be in\nyour presence I learned so much from you\nI remember I want to share this because\nthe first time I met you I'd heard so\nmuch about you and you know your your\nreputation precedes you and you have\nthis you know huge brand Beyond just I'm\nnot talking about brand in terms of\nsocial media I think in the business\nworld and I had no idea what you're\ngoing to be like and I was I was nervous\nI was it was three years ago but that\nwas early in my career of doing this and\nI was thinking to myself I was like\nwhat's he gonna be like I have no idea\nlike\nhow should I behave around it and then\nyou came in and you were the most you\nknow Charming disarming individual that\nI'd met you're so comfortable to be\naround I was telling my whole team that\nI was like you you forget everything in\nyour presence you make everyone feel\nvery comfortable very respected very uh\nvery wanted and very valued and I think\nthat's a huge gift so I wanted to say\nthat because I probably have not told\nyou that but yes three years ago I was\nvery nervous well there are times where\nthere's um\nan Esprit de corps that there are\nsimilar values that you're going after\nsimilar things and you can also play\njazz together it's almost like when\nwe're right now it's almost like we can\nbe playing together yeah I love it and\nwe have that so I have the same respect\nand we could so let's go play some jazz\nyeah let's do it I was gonna ask you do\nyou remember the first time you ever\nfelt fear meeting someone because I know\nyou talk a lot about uh the truth and\nfearlessness but yeah was there ever a\ntime when you remember meeting a mentor\nor a business person a person in your\nworld where you felt a sense of fear and\nhow you dealt with that um my reactions\nare tend to be more like excitement\nthere's a nervous excitement yes nervous\nexcitement is probably the right word\nyeah yes because I'm I'm walking in and\nI'm thinking okay wow okay but it's a\nlittle bit like life you know the\nquestion at certain moments\nis is that excitement for some people\nit's excitement for some people it's\nfear and it's not just at those moments\nof meeting somebody like that it happens\na lot in life yes you know it's almost\nambiguity a taste for adventure I think\nI'm I'm more The Taste for adventure so\nI will nervously go in maybe with some\npalpitations and feeling more excitement\nat it like I feel excited about this I\nthink that's a great refinement I I\nwould say I I feel the same way it's a\nnervous excitement\nthat's something special you have you\nhave this ability to be really clear\nabout words be really clear about\nemotions when you read your work when\nyou're in your work was Clarity\nsomething that you always found easy or\nhow did you develop that ability to be\nso clear about the language you use even\njust what you did now it was like I used\na word and you're like actually I feel\nthis and I'm like yeah actually I feel\nthat too so tell me where that\nrefinement came from I honestly don't\nknow\num I have a lousy rope memory\nthat means I mean really rope memory\nmeans like if it doesn't have a reason\nfor being what it is like a phone number\nor name or anything like that like I'm\nterrible and if it and in school\nterrible you know memorize this one but\nif it's within a context and there's a\nstory where there's something I have a\nsuperb memory of how that transpires and\nI think I was born that way and so by\nbeing born that way I'm wondering does\nthat enter into this particular question\nand I um and then I think my job\nrequires me to be thinking in terms of\nthat sort of clarity but I really don't\ndon't know yeah yeah no I mean it's it's\nfascinating for us to at least learn\nthat and perceive that in you but it\nseems like you've done a lot of reverse\nengineering as well to create the\nprinciples in the first place like\nobserving success observing failure\nobserving wins it seems like there's\nbeen no you're putting your finger on it\nyou know what I did is I got in a habit\nin a very early age that whenever I\nwould make a decision\nI would pause and reflect particularly\nif it was a painful decision or a\npainful moment I pause and reflect I\nhave a principle pain plus reflection\nequals progress and then I would write\ndown my Reflections that's why the\njournal I would literally use a journal\nthis journal by the way is connected to\nuh an app that facilitates that but and\nthat's what one I want to pass along and\nI think that that helped my clarity\nbecause at that moment of stepping back\nwhen there is greater Clarity when\nthere's calmness After the Storm maybe\nor the excitement of the adventure\nwhatever it is that you're reflecting on\nthat reflection writing it down and\nthinking about it and thinking am I\nclear I think helps Mike I know helps my\nclarity a lot wow I remember a few years\nago when when you went to some through\nsomething you know extremely tragic I\nemailed you just just to know of love\nand\nsupport and you quoted that back to me\nthen in an email and I I was just blown\naway by that because I have quoted pain\nplus reflection equals progress by you\na million times I think I repeat that in\nevery keynote I give because I think\nit's such a powerful\nit's such a powerful principle because\nas soon as you remove the word\nreflection progress disappears and all\nyou're left with is pain and when you\nrepeated that back to me in that moment\nI thought wow like to remember that\nprinciple in this moment requires so\nmuch just just so much depth and I was\ntruly Blown Away by that because that's\none thing writing it and it's another\nthing living in the incident that you're\nreferring to is the worst thing that\ncould ever have happened to me whether\num I would rather die than have it\nhappen was the loss of my son\nyeah but you know meditation helps a lot\nright so meditation and reflection\nbecause whenever there's pain there's a\nreality it tells you something about\nreality and it tells you something about\nhow to deal with reality the reflections\nyeah life is life it comes at you it is\nreality you can't change it okay you can\ninfluence it based on your reactions\nyeah but you have to deal with it and\nyou have to deal with it in a calm way\nso meditation helps you be calm it helps\nyou see the clarity and then move beyond\nthat to deal with the circumstances well\nI think how did you come to accept that\nI think a lot of people struggle with\naccepting that life's going to come at\nyou it's going to do what it wants I\nthink we have a desire for control and\nwhen someone looks at someone as\nsuccessful as you they would infer that\noh Ray probably is good at controlling\nthings he's probably good at making\nthings happen and what is that balance\nor what have you discovered about the\nidea of like control and acceptance like\nwhere do you live in between that space\nwell I think you know keeps coming back\nuh the Serenity Prayer God give me the\nserenity to accept that which I can't\ncontrol\nand give me the power to control that\nwhich I can and the wisdom to tell the\ndifference and I think that that really\nguides it you know what is your best and\nso it is the combination of acceptance\nbut also the desire to influence yeah\nright and so yeah and if you're going to\ninfluence you have to have that\nEquanimity you know like a ninja you\nknow there are things coming at you and\nyou can't be hijacked by your emotions\nand the smartness of your move will\ndetermine the outcomes and how do you\nlearn that because it produces better\nresults and the other one produces bad\nresults and it's like you learn anything\nit's the same way you learn don't put\nyour hand on a hot stove yeah absolutely\nabsolutely I I love that because I think\nwe live in the world right now where\nit's like is it this way or that way\nit's always is it either or and you're\nsaying well no it's both right we need\nboth acceptance and control we need both\ndesires and I think often we get lost\nthinking well it's one or the other you\ncan only choose one and in all either of\nthose cases it's reality\nokay you're dealing with reality yeah so\nto go above of it is so important you\nknow here I am in this situation\nand what do I do what resources can I\nuse who might I speak with for help all\nof that helps you navigate because you\nstill have to deal with reality yes\nabsolutely absolutely when when did you\nwe'll do my my principles the journal\nand I know like you said there's an app\nattached to it and for anyone who's uh\nwondering why this gender is different\nthere's so many reasons why it's\ndifferent a because it has better\nprompts than most journals I've seen but\nit also has this QR code that kind of\nyou can scan on every page and so\nwhether it's doing the assessment or\nwhether in this case it's watch a case\nstudy of this principle in action it's\nit's an interactive Journal right which\nis very different I think we have lots\nof journals where we write with a pen\nand uh you're jotting down your thoughts\nbut here if you can see there's you know\nexercises included as well when did I'm\nintrigued when did your personal\njournaling practice start Ray or it's\nabout 25 years ago but I I want to say\nthat uh by being it gives you sort of an\noption do I want to have what I'm doing\nsaved online so then I can play around\nwith it in other words I got the data\nyeah so now once I've got the data\nonline rather than on piece of paper you\ncan do things with it\num but but sometimes that piece of paper\nbut I started about\num I guess about\n25 maybe 30 years ago I can't tell you\num I started when I started building my\ncompany I it was a point of having 67\npeople I remember it because every\nholiday season I would you know I\nstarted my company from nothing so I had\ntwo people four people well okay we got\nup to 67. I remember it was 67 because\nit was holiday season and every holiday\nI would um shop for their individual\ngifts and I'd write each individual long\nnotes and That Was Then long enough take\ntook me long enough to realize that I\nreally need to communicate better with\nthem um I also journaled because I\nneeded to write down my decision rules\nfor the markets so that I could go back\ntest them so I it's a very great power\nif you can know what your criteria would\nbe and then say how could I how would\nthey have worked in the past how would\nthey worked in this country or that\ncountry because then you're not just\nmaking decisions you have perspective on\nmaking the decisions so those two things\ntogether got me into journaling I wanted\nthe world my world my people I worked\nwith we went up to 1500 people how do\nyou communicate in a really good way and\nand it wasn't just journaling but then\nalso I would combine the journaling with\nuh videos and cases my culture was to\nhave meaningful work and meaningful\nrelationships through radical\ntruthfulness and radical transparency so\nwhat what we would do is video\neverything or tape everything for\neverybody to see so that way they can\nsee it and so by taking the principles\nand putting them together with the\nsituations it was fabulous exposure so\neverybody was always informed and they\nwere going through like this reality TV\ntype experience and that and then they\nwould give answers as they were going\nthrough the experience because that way\nthey would have that experience but\nimagine a reality TV experience uh but\nit's your reality around you and then\nyou're making these uh this input and\nthen that input would be able to know\nwhat people would think so we found all\nthat experience really well so we took\nthe journals the journaling of the\nprinciples I I did and put that together\nwith the videos and that's that's on\nthis app principles in action it's\ncalled principles in action it's uh it's\nfree and it's uh rated 4.9 people love\nit but that journaling experience that\nreflecting and reflecting together and\ncommunicating together helps the people\nbring people together and it also helps\npeople understand because too much stuff\nis stuck up here oh wow I mean just\nhearing that this so many levels of\njournaling there there's the journaling\nof like you're saying you writing down\nyour principles or the gifts and working\nwith people then there's the journaling\nof even videoing everything I mean\nthat's journaling right you're\ndocumenting it it's recorded it's there\nto reflect upon the the most brilliant\npart about that though is that I think\ntoday people have started to think\njournaling just means writing down your\nfeelings or writing down your thoughts\nwhich is yeah this is no no I mean I\nthink it's good to write down your\nfeelings of course yeah so to bring them\nforward to look up to up to and to look\nat them is that a good that's a good\nexercise religion is not ER is a way of\nlife as an approach to life I don't mean\num yes the god part of religion I mean\njust how do you how do you approach life\nand you get to make that decision and so\nit's really when you're in a situation\nwhat are you going to do in that\nsituation and why and of course it\nstarts with your deeper needs whatever\nthey may be what do I want out of life\nwho do I want to be with what are the\ndirections okay and then it comes down\nto the particulars and the particulars\ncan be\num aspirational I'm 73 years old I know\nthat at this particular point in life I\nwant to pass along the things that are\nvaluable for me it could be on how do\nyou fire a person how how do you treat\nthat person it could be what is your\nrelationship like and so those are the\nprinciples\num it's not just it's not journaling\nfeelings and I so that I found that very\nvery valuable but I'm in a new phase of\nmy life in which what I'm going to do is\nget the best principles from everyone\nI've been passing along my principles\nand so on and it's been people find it\nhelpful what a joy it is as you must\nexperience when people say I oh my God\nyou've changed my life but other people\ncan do it you're doing it and I say to\nso many people who are really very very\nsuccessful people who have never written\ndown their principles that they're going\nto die with them and if they instead\nwrite them down and make them clear then\nthey're teaching other people because\nthere's a life Arc right we have\nexperiences that things of decisions we\nmake that make us successful okay\nincluding how to deal with pain and so\nif we write those things down we can\nhelp other people and I think like I\nprobably won't be around\num to speak to my grandchildren in the\nway that I would like to then but they\nwill have those principles and so now my\naspiration is to get the the best\nprinciples from wherever it they come\nfrom so this journal will be accompanied\nby an ability for people to submit their\npins levels and I'm doing that also with\nthe most successful impactful people in\nthe world that's why I'm going to be\ngrabbing your principles and that'll be\nput online so that people can vote up\nthe what are the best principles they\ncould either go to Jay shetty's\nprinciples or they can say oh through\nthat vote and what's the best principle\nfor the thing I'm dealing with so that\nway they can look and they say I am\ndealing with this situation push the bus\nand then what are the best principles\nfor that situation wherever they come\nfrom and then they could choose their\nprinciples and that's I think\nfoundational for Life yeah that's\nfantastic and I know that's what you're\nfocusing with this is like you want\npeople to come up with their own yeah\nand that's going to mean being exposed\nto a lot of different ideas a lot of\ndifferent insights to\nfind what they can hold on to and then\ndevelop themselves did you always think\nyou've always said that to me since I've\nmet you and obviously that's been the\njourney that you're on right now that\nthis phase in your life is giving back\nand sharing the principles you've\nlearned have you always had a vision for\ndifferent stages of your life and I\ndon't mean a five-year 10-year plan I\nmean more of like this is the world I'm\nwalking into like is that how you I\nalways say I don't know how many years\nago I started to realize the Arc of life\nright there's actually an exercise in\nthe book on the Larkin life that's New\nYork in life yeah and these are all the\ndifferent things that happen to you at\nthat stage it's almost like a script and\nby going down this script one can see\nwhere one is and one could see the\nthings that are going to come at them I\nstarted to realize that in a big picture\npit I don't know maybe it was 25 30\nyears ago I can't say but then I began\nto research it and understand it a lot\ngreater and then I began to feel it\nyou feel it again when you can connect\nintellectually what's happening with\nsubliminally and emotionally what's\nhappening to you you gain perspective\nand so this like this phase\num it's not just an intellectual thing I\ndon't know maybe Nature has programmed\nus in our minds to have these needs and\nfeelings at certain age so I know that\nnow like the greatest joy that I can\nhave is to help people be successful\nwithout me I mean I know what my time\nHorizon is and I know that my greatest\njoy is not any longer in being\nsuccessful myself\num that was that that was great and it's\nfine and so on but I don't need more of\nthat and I really my greatest joy is in\nhelping other people and I can't say\nwhether that is a instinctual how much\nof it's instinctual how much it's\ncerebral by seeing that state age in\nlife but it's it's apparent yeah no\nabsolutely and you're doing it and I I\nremember even in even in other ways like\nnot just business success but I remember\nlast year my wife and I were doing a\ncharity event to raise funds for\ncovid-19 in India because we read a\nstatistic that one person was dying\nevery five minutes of covid-19 and I\nreached out to you and you just gave\nsuch a wonderfully generous donation and\nso in so many ways you're helping and\nsupporting and and it's been so\nbeautiful to see you're doing something\nwe were talking about this just before\nwe started filming but this idea of like\ncoaching and mentorship right like what\nyou're saying is you're trying to\npreserve this coaching and mentorship\nfor your grandkids great grandkids\neveryone else's grandkids and great\ngrandkids as well that will have access\nto this and journaling is someone that\nwe see so many greats did as well it's a\npractice that has stood the test of time\nthere are two schools of thought some\nEntre entrepreneurs believe that mentors\nand coaches are a huge integral part of\ntheir life I know that I've had\nspiritual mentors Financial mentors\ncareer mentors I've had mentors in every\narea of my life I see you as a mentor uh\non the other end there are entrepreneurs\nwho believe they're self-made that you\ndon't need mentors you don't need\ncoaches you don't need to listen to\nanyone's advice where do you sit on that\nand how do you help young people\nnavigate that today because I think a\nlot of people are stuck trying to figure\nit out or they're not doing either\nproperly as well the second group is\nstupid\nbut just be clear okay that was very\nradically uh I just want to be clear\nthey may confuse the\nfact that\num they may have good instincts they\nhave to make their own decisions they\ncan be\num independent thinkers that might do\ncontroversial things in order to be\nsuccessful that all is true okay that\nall is true\nbut\nthe perspectives gain the learning uh\nthe wisdom that is gained the\nopen-mindedness the power of stress\ntesting your ideas I say that I think\neverybody's uh to be successful should\nbe assertive and open-minded at the same\ntime people ask well what does that\nmerely mean it means the you have to\nbelieve you have to understand and at\nthe same time you have to doubt and pull\nout and get the questions so that you\nstress tested and you're learning yes\nyes and so there's a great power in\ngetting the other perspectives you know\na triangulation for me is the key to\nsuccess one of the keys to success\ntriangulation I mean get the three\nsmartest people that you know who will\ncare about you yeah and but will\ndisagree with you we'll stress test you\nand and and have those conversations and\nI like to have them disagree with each\nother yeah so I'll bring them into a\nroom and we'll have a conversation yeah\nand then okay do the back and forth you\nwant to learn about anything like I have\nbig initiatives and where I don't know\nanything and I have found that if I\nfollow that approach by getting the best\nexperts and I do that I can go into\nthings with the with the guidance so\nit's so obviously stupid I think or so\nobviously beneficial to be able to draw\nupon the best thinking and then not to\njust blindly believe so when I say it be\nassertive and open-minded at the same\ntime don't just follow okay do the back\nand forth here's the disagreements and\nthen resolve the disagreements it's an\nextremely powerful approach yeah I know\nthere's this amazing study I read a few\nyears ago in MIT where they said that\nthey did a study MIT did a study on the\nmost Innovative people inside an\norganization and they showed two graphs\nto people and they said who do you think\nis more Innovative and in graph number\none it was where one person is connected\nto lots of different people like this\nand then graph two was people connected\nto people and then the people they knew\nwere connected to each other and they\nasked who do you think is more\nInnovative and most people said the\nsecond I don't know if that's because\npeople don't know how to read graphs or\nwhether people really thought it was but\nthe answer was that if you know people\nwho all know each other chances are\nyou're going to be less Innovative and\nless effective because you live in an\necho chamber but if you know people who\ndon't know each other who have more\nrandom ideas disagreements are less\nlikely to\naffirm each other's beliefs which is\nwhat you're saying you're actually going\nto get to a better answer so they were\nsaying that if you know people from\ndifferent backgrounds different walks of\nlife different\nexpertise therefore they'll naturally be\ndebate you get healthier answers so I\nthink that study always stands out to me\nand this is a problem the biggest\nproblem of our society now\nthe biggest problem of our society now\nis individuals who are highly\nopinionated\nwho will not exchange open-mindedly the\ndifferent opinions about things and are\nin their Echo Chambers whether it's on\nthe particular media that they're\nconnected to and so on who are then\nhaving conflicts with each other this is\na threat to our society yeah and and\nlet's talk about that I think that's\nsuch a fascinating topic and idea\nbecause I I couldn't agree with you more\nif I had to say for myself I feel like I\nthink maybe it was from you know working\nI love both my parents but I I was\nmediating their marriage since I was a\nkid and so I was very good at being on\nboth sides I love them both individually\nand I would always like I'd know I could\nlisten to my mom and I could hear her\nside and I could empathize with her and\nI do the same with my dad and I'd be\nthere for both of them but it it became\na natural thing that I was able to do I\nthink because of that when I'm when I\nreflect on I think that's how I gain\nthat skill so I've always found it very\nnatural to be able to understand\ndifferent sides to really empathize and\nconnect with different people and see\nthat there's truth and challenges in\nboth but I think that's hard to do\nbecause I think today we feel ideology\nis our safety right and ideology is what\nmakes us feel secure in who we are and\nso right that's a serious mistake right\nso yeah let's let's dive into that how\ndo we let go of that in recognizing that\nactually knowledge and knowing is far\nmore a safety than holding on to one\nideology I think it's simple uh the fear\nof making bad mistakes or being wrong\nshould be a motivator to take in these\ndifferent perspectives and then weigh\nthings okay an ideology though let's say\nit's a political ideology I want my\nchildren to be educated in a certain way\nthat's a very particular important\nideology still means that there are\nchoices that you have and then the\nquestion is have you made those choices\nin the best way and then after you've\nmade those choices\nwhat are you going to do about it should\nyou move from one place to another\nshould you um what schools do you pick I\nmean you know those kinds of things life\nis just a matter of those particular\nchoices and there are win-win\nrelationships and they're a lose-lose\nrelationships and win-win relationships\nare a lot better than lose-lose\nrelationships so knowing the approach to\nthat knowing Live and Let Live I can\nmake my choices I can move here I can do\nthis or the mutual respect that you have\nfor uh it's okay you can have your point\nof view to be less judgmental is better\nI mean not it's better for everybody\nyeah is somebody doing you harm that's a\nwhole different thing but the all of\nthat I think is very very important the\nart of thoughtful disagreement is the\nbasis of a very\nuh Innovative and also harmonious\nSociety if you want to have an\nInnovative harmonious Society you have\nto have the art of thoughtful\ndisagreement and the mediator is a very\nuh important role so that you play\num because like I I wrote in my other\nbook principles one of the handy things\nis if you're having a disagreement one\nof you might be wrong and how do you\nknow and how do you get past that and so\nthe uh classic thing is to find to agree\non somebody who you mutually agree will\nuh be a fair judge and a fair mediator\nand if you mutually agree on that person\nthen you bring them then they can get\nyou they can help you along and the\nexercise of going above it and saying\nokay here is this disagreement and how\ndo we deal with disagreement on\neach other related to the disagreement\nthat is a good perspective to have yeah\nand so I think that as we look at all\nthose things I think that it's so clear\nthat approaches like that are and\nperspectives like that are very very\nhelpful yeah and I love how you call it\nan art because I remember when I was at\nin my high school I was part of my\ndebating team at school and I first got\ninto it because I I found public\nspeaking natural and I enjoyed it and\nyou know I guess as a young man I\nthought it was fun to argue with people\nand defeat them and things like that and\nI'd go up there and I'd I'd know how to\npick a part someone's argument and I'd\nknow how to bend it into twist it and\nthen I remember one of our teachers or\ncoaches he sat me down and he said Jay\ndo you think you're good at this and I\nhadn't had a Young Person's ego that\ngoes for 15 16 years old and I was like\nyeah I'm really great at this and he\nsaid well actually you you are just\nwinning because you're good at arguing\nbut he goes you don't actually know how\nto debate and I said what do you mean\nand he said well he said you're debating\nbased on why your point is better but he\ngoes you don't know the other person's\npoint well enough and so he said the\nonly way you become a great debater is\nif you also deeply study the opposing\nargument he goes you can't just win on\nthe mirror of your argument you have to\nactually understand where that person's\ncoming from it changed my whole view yes\nI'll take that and I'll go once please\noh I'd love for you to yeah but one step\nfurther is not to win your point of view\nyeah the one step further is to get a\ntruth\nthe real winner\num is somebody who learns something\nabsolutely okay so I'm talking about in\nlife yeah maybe on the stage you say ah\nyou won the debate because you ended up\nwith the position you started with yes\nand that and you won it we gave you the\nmost no points yes but the real winner\nin life is to try to find what the best\npath is and the one who comes out of it\nwho has improved their understanding and\nmakes a step forward is the real winner\nyeah so losing the debate in many cases\ncan make you a better winner I couldn't\nagree more I couldn't agree more and I\nthink I think that's a challenge I\nremember there's a famous phrase I don't\nknow where it comes from but there's\nthree sides to every story one's yours\none's mine and then the truth right like\nthere's we but we so often feel that our\nside is the truth I know it's such a\nterror we've been raised that way yeah\nyou know the educational system means\nokay you take a test I came up with the\nright answer I won okay it doesn't take\nyou through the Journey of saying I'm\nnow having experience and I was wrong\nand how do I go above that that's what\none of the big reasons why people often\nwho are very successful in school are\nnot very successful in life yeah it's so\ntrue yeah it's so true and I hope that\nthis podcast at least reminds people\nthat any argument you have this week\nthis doesn't just Supply with a debate\nin the workplace or a disagreement at\nhome with your friends with your family\nwherever you are if you can take a\nmoment to reflect on finding the truth\nas you rightly said and have a bad\nexperience can become a good experience\nin other words if you approach it as a\nfight\nit's going to produce a lot of anxiety\nif you uh approach it as a curiosity and\nan ex a game almost that you're playing\nwith each other okay to try to get at\ntruth yeah okay then that could be\nreally a wonderful experience yeah but\nsomehow we feel that admitting a mistake\nor admitting we were wrong or\ndiscovering the truth makes us weak and\nmakes us bad education system bad you\nknow because it it just looks at that\nparticular answer and it doesn't look at\nthe sequence of discovering truth and\nthat's that that's a that's a problem\nit's a it's a problem but I found in\npeople that um it's not a problem that\nthey can't get over\num I found that we have this culture in\nwhich that's the culture right it\nbecomes obvious if you're not doing it\nyes and when that you have in an\nenvironment like that then people's\nbehaviors change pretty quickly yeah I\nwould say and I don't know how many\nmonths it'll vary but maybe 18 months or\nso on uh that they would be curious what\ndo they what might they be missing and\nthey understand that it almost is so\nsilly yeah to be a Blocker of ideas\num and to be antagonistic when there's a\ndifferent point of view it's it's really\nstupid yeah to do that yeah and when\nthey start to see themselves doing that\nand asking why are they doing that that\nreflection and that then changing\nBehavior then produces uh changed\nbehavior that produces rewards better\ndecisions and better relationships when\nyou have better decisions and better\nrelationships you have a better life\nyeah and it does take time you said 18\nmonths there I think I was talking to my\nteam before we kicked off and I was just\nsaying that I feel like we finally in in\nmy company have a culture where everyone\nis so self-reflective and\nself-focused on what they can improve\nand how they can be better that it makes\nit easier to have conversations where\nthere's disagreement and debate and a\ndifference of opinion because everyone\nis reflecting on themselves they're not\ncoming into something going no my idea\nis the best and we're getting it wrong\nbut I think that takes a certain kind of\nperson and human who who has that\nability to do that with while not losing\ntheir self-esteem yes but that commit\nthat can be uh trained okay here's the\nway it works\nthere is an intellectual analytical part\nof our brains logical and so on and then\nthere's this subliminal which means we\ndon't even know what it's thinking\nemotional part of our brains that is\noperating that if you speak with\nsomebody and you have you put them in\nthe position of saying would you like\nthis or would you not like it and you\nthey start to experience the two uses I\ncall it then they start to see that they\nmay not\num make they may make a different choice\nfor example\nif I say\num Jay I have these thoughts about what\nyou're not doing well would you like me\nto discuss it with you\nor would you not like me to discuss it\nwith you yeah or I think you have I\ndon't know it could be\neven a fatal flaw yeah by the way fatal\nflaws are not fatal because you may not\nbe able to change yourself but you can\nwork with people who are strong where\nyou're weak to be able to be successful\nyes but when you ask that\num those things that they find a barrier\nit's quite often the case that\nintellectually they understand it yes\nobviously it's desirable for you to tell\nme maybe things I don't want to hear\nokay yeah but I know that of course I I\nfirst of all I want to know that you're\nhearing those things and secondly maybe\nthey're true and so that exercise of\nspeaking\num where the intellectual and the\nsubliminal are at odds\nand they see that it's at odds and then\nthey begin to pursue a way of being is a\ntraining process that can help them to\nsay I want that yes yes it's almost like\nthe debate that we're seeing externally\nis actually a debate going on internally\nbetween them already yes if that is it\nyes the biggest debates we have is that\ndebate the emotional us with the\nintellectual us and the path really to\nsuccess in my opinion is to be able to\nalign those okay what am I feeling and\nthen to reflect intellectually is that\nthe right thing if I'm going to I don't\nknow punch the person or if I'm going to\nmaybe eat what I shouldn't eat or\nsomething and then intellectually I can\nhave the reconciliation between that\nemotional and that intellectual to make\nthe decision and I get alignment and by\nthe way I find meditation helps a lot\num I can get alignment and then I can\ntake that view that I have and then\ntriangulate it with others the\nprobability of me making a much better\ndecision has increased immensely and\nit's and all success in life is is\nmaking the better decisions absolutely\nyeah absolutely you it's it's really\ninteresting the path that we've gone\ndown and I love it when you said Jazz\nit's like it's definitely been like that\nbecause we've gone down a completely\ndifferent direction which which I love\nbut you you said something you was like\nyou know this is one of the biggest\nchallenges in society today what are\nsome of the challenges you see in\nsociety that we should be addressing at\nthe core because this isn't just going\ninto like the current events it's really\nlooking at root challenges that we yeah\nI've been in uh Global macro investor\nfor about well over 50 years and one of\nthe things that I learned in my life is\nthat many of the things that surprised\nme just didn't happen to me before but\nthey happen many times in history\nso by studying history I I could then do\nwell so for example studying the Great\nDepression allowed me to do very well in\nthe 2008 financial crisis what's\nhappening now is allowing me to do very\nwell when others are having problems\nbecause of things that have happened in\nthe past the three big things and there\nare a couple more too but the three big\nthings that are happening to us is the\nfirst the financial that's happening at\na macro level which is the creation of a\nlot of debt and the printing of a lot of\nmoney to\num pay for that debt so you don't pay it\nback with hard dollars and so on that's\nputting a lot of money out there and\nthat's producing the stagflation that we\nhave and the magnitudes of that are\nunprecedented you have to go back to the\n1930s to see something like that and so\nthe value of money and what you do with\nmoney and its economic impact uh affects\neverybody\nuh the second big influence is the\namount of internal conflict that is\nexisting because of larger large wealth\ngaps the largest wealth Gap since the\n1930s the largest values gaps and then\nthis intransigent win at all cost type\nof mentality which is reflected in\npopulism in other words a populist is a\npolitical representative who says I will\nfight for you and win at all cost and\nthat means not compromising and that win\nat all cost is why you see the the\nJanuary 6th incidents and things like\nthat we may be in a position where\nneither side in the next presidential\nelection accepts losing in the next\npresidential election that conflict\nproduces the most irreconcilable\ndifferences and people who are in that\nmindset and that is what causes Civil\nWars types of Civil Wars you can easily\nimagine that that's the central\ngovernment might give directions to the\nlocal government or people and they say\nI'm not going to follow that law you\nmight see the Supreme Court you may not\nfind that where and that's a world\nproblem right now so that second problem\nis a problem it's particularly a problem\nwhen you have the first problem because\nthe first problem produces financial\nproblems which produces stress and\nantagonism and says on this wealth gap\nor whatever it values Gap I'm going to\nfight for you have the second that's\ndangerous and the third is the rise of\nuh prowers\num the United States is no longer the\ndominant power in other words if you\nlook at the percentage share of world\nGDP or military superiority and those\ntypes of things and so you have these\nRising powers and the United States and\nso you have bigger powers in bigger\nconflicts we see it obviously with\nRussia today but we see it with China\nand so on and so the whole Geographic\nworld order is changing all of these\nthings make for greater conflict right\nthe financial conflict the financial\npain how do I deal with inflation where\nshould I keep my money it's not the same\nhow do I deal with that together with\nthe internal conflict and that external\nconflict produces a very stressful and\nrisky period for the world we are in a\nrisky period in the world and so that\nthose are from the macro the perspective\nthe biggest influences I studied when I\nstudied this I studied last 500 years of\nhistory and to see the arcs because the\narcs typically take 100 or 150 years to\nhave an arc a big cycle and so I needed\nto study the 500 years and I put it out\nin a book changing World Order and\nthere's also a video free video online\nuh 24 million people seated it's easy to\nsee because I wanted to convey the\nmessage and you you see see those arcs\nrepeating over time for certain reasons\nI think it's very important that people\nunderstand those arcs and then again\nwith the Equanimity and the other things\nthat we're talking about approach that\nset of circumstances so that's the mix\nof circumstances that I would say\ncreates the environment that we're in\nand the key to any environment is uh to\nknow how to navigate it well so in that\nbook I wrote different principles of you\nknow how do you deal with that kind of\nan environment I'm not saying that\nenvironment there's nothing sure in what\nI'm saying yeah okay yeah but it does\ncome back to some Basics and those\nBasics means are how are people with\neach other\nhow am I going to be with you can we\nhave thoughtful disagreement can we have\ncompromise can we have a country in\nwhich we are more together that more\ninvite and to understand how that choice\nthat together figuring it out is going\nto be a whole lot better than fighting\nwith each other yeah and I think that's\nthe challenge we're seeing is this\nmassive disparity between the challenge\ngetting more and more extreme and our\nskills still being at the same level\nlike that ability to have that\nconversation or that debate or that\ndisagreement the skill level we have is\nso low that's right and um you see by\nstudying um the French Revolution\nChinese Revolution the Russian\nRevolution all of these Cuban\nrevolutions and so on when it starts to\nuh intensify you get past the point of\nlistening to each other and then you go\ninto the fighting mode\nand that's a cycle so like in the French\nRevolution there were many in the middle\nwho said this system is not working and\nfor both sides and there should be a\nreformation and making move but if you\nwere in the middle you were guillotined\nor anyone in the middle\num you have to pick a side and fight wow\nand that's the nature of that Dynamic\nit's all within us because if you take\nany measure of living standards the\nworld the world has more wealth than it\never has it com greater longevity\nbecause there's greater science so what\nwe have in totality the world has more\nthan it has ever had right so our\nopportunity is great if we could just\nwork it out right but we can destroy\neach other we can hurt each other very\nbadly because of human nature and it's\nthe same human nature that existed\nthrough time there are lessons just\ndon't do this yeah I mean when you you\nsay that I start thinking of when you're\nstudying history and you're studying\nthose 500 years and I'm going to ask you\nthis in a second but there's an example\nthat came to my mind I always think\nabout like where where did someone get\nit right or where is their progress as\nwell in history and I recently got to\nvisit Rwanda\nand I would never thought I would have\nvisited and it wasn't part of my plans I\nwent because\nuh one of my friends opened up a\nConservation Center for the environment\nfor gorillas and it's a beautiful space\nout there so I went there and we got to\ntrack with the gorillas every day and\nwalk with them and it's it's a really\nbeautiful thing because you're walking\nwith them in the wild they're not you\nknow kept in a zoo or anywhere like that\nthey're in their home and you get to go\nand observe them in their home but but\nmore importantly I went to the memorial\nthe genocide Memorial Museum there and\nthe genocide was just 20 years ago and\nyou learn about the two tribes that you\nknow completely I think one million\npeople died in the genocide of the 10\nmillion population that the country has\nso it's huge right like and what I was\nblown away by was I met with some of the\nsurvivors and I sat with them because I\nwas just curious and intrigued because\neveryone there now has let go of the\nnames of the tribes they've let go of\nyou know the the Heritage almost from\ntheir parents most of these people's\nparents would have\nkilled each other like it's a it's a\nvery like a violent environment but\nthere's such a healing there's such a\nforgiveness there's such a path to\nletting go now of course there's other\nchallenges that are going on in the\ncountry and poverty Etc but the\nleadership has spearheaded this journey\ntowards Collective conscience and like\nbringing people together and recognizing\nthat we're more alike than we are\ndifferent and I was just astounded at\nhow a country 20 years ago in that much\nturmoil is is rising from that I did you\nfind any examples in history where\npeople did have positive mediation well\num what you're describing is the uh is\nthe typical cycle so I'm just going to\nmake clear what the typical cycle is the\ntypical cycle is that you have a war a\ncivil war or an international war that\nyou have a fight for power and then you\nhave a horrendous experience okay\nand then out of that comes in new water\noh God comes a new system somebody is\ndominant like a Spanish Civil War is\nbrothers and fighting each other and so\non a horrendous experience and then some\nForce gains the power wins and it\nbecomes such a horrendous experience the\nFriendship award the all of these Civil\nWars they become such a horrendous\nexperience\num that nobody wants it again\nand so the pendulum swings\nso that you then don't have a war right\nso for example my father\num and that generation fought in a war\nokay in the beginning parts of these\nwars they're into the war you know\nthey're Brave and they're going to go\nthere and then the war is so horrendous\num and it goes on so long and by the way\nit's a great equalizer they destroy\nwealth so well the quality then becomes\ngreater and they go into that\nenvironment and then it just it it ends\nand then when it ends there's so much\nhurting and so much not wanting war that\nyou come to a period of peace and\nprosperity and the cycle goes for peace\nand prosperity and then a new generation\ncomes along okay who has not experienced\nuh the war and then comes into that and\nsays uh we will fight and so on like our\ngeneration has not experienced those\nthings and yet they're intransigent in\nterms of those fights and they've sort\nmany people could say hell yes I'm I'm\ngonna fight and then you go through that\ncycle so that's how the cycle normally\nworks how do we then make sure that\npeople understand the ramifications and\nconsequences um I think that's what I\nput out the book because I want people\nto worry about this I have a principle\nif you worry you don't have to worry and\nif you don't worry you need to worry\nokay if you worry\nthen you will\ntake care not to do the thing you're\nworrying about yeah\nif you don't worry about it you're\nprobably going to do it okay so when I\nlook at the set of circumstances I\nbelieve that we as a society are at a\njuncture we recognize that this conflict\nor can we have win-win relationships can\nwe compromise can we have this together\ncan we work well together or not okay\nwe're at that I think by seeing those\nalternatives\nand and having a middle I I you know I\npray for a strong middle I pray for\navoiding the extremes and the fighting\nbetween those extremes and maybe if\nthat's the case then we will get it and\nit's hard when the system's been set up\nfor the extremes right like it's\ndifficult when I think it's more human\nnature than the system like okay we've\nhad this democratic system over through\na period of time but we had one Civil\nWar and we've had others how are we\ngoing to be democracy worked very very\nwell for a lot of times for in a variety\nof ways I mean I don't have to recount\nthem but at the same time uh the history\nof democracy and Cycles Plato in his\nbook The Republic builds about these\nCycles over and over again yeah and and\nthe real risk to democracy is anarchy\nbecause you can't have strong leadership\nbecause everybody's fighting over\neverything and it produces a chaos and\nthat chaos becomes intolerable and\neverybody wants to fight and then you\nhave the fight so I think it's more\nhuman nature than a system yeah human\nnature just goes in that direction\nregardless it's also like\num people who went who didn't have\nanything and are broken or in the worst\npossible positions and a society that\nlikes that and then they come out and\nthen they work well together they make\nthings and then they can become decadent\nthe society can become decadent I think\nour society is decadent now I think this\nit's got a problem in that um the lower\nlevels of society I have intimate\ncontact through my wife particularly who\nis helping the what is called disengage\nand disconnected population of high\nschool students in Connecticut those are\nstudents who disconnected means they're\nno longer in school they're out they\ndon't know where they are\num and this engage means that they they\nhave an absentee rate of greater than 25\npercent they're failing classes 22\npercent of the high school students in\nConnecticut are one of those one out of\nfive education isn't working they're\nliving in poverty we have created a\nself-reinforcing cycle that in in\nchildren have uh we didn't create an\nacceptable bottom you create a situation\nwhere children\nguns and gangs and children can't walk\nto school safely shootings regularly in\nHartford Connecticut Bridgeport\nConnecticut just right up the road from\nus okay exists Pockets throughout this\nand then equal opportunity we do not\nhave equal opportunity and to\nsimultaneously have a situation in which\nwe are not taking care of the basics but\nwe are really over you know doing the\nluxuries is creating a set of\ncircumstances that's a problem I think\nand so um I think that's how man is with\neach other so you it's a cycle if you\nget spoiled like this is the thing I\nworry about you know our family does\nmake sure our family doesn't get spoiled\nif the kids don't get spoiled because\nwhat happens is then\num they're not strong\n[Music]\nthat's a cycle yeah you know it's like\nthree generations the classic three\ngeneration cycle you know somebody works\nhard they make it they have those sound\nvalues then what happens is then they\ninherited it and then they are in a\nposition where you know they don't have\nthe same and they're spoiled and they're\nand they say I don't have to work as\nhard I'm living off of what I've got and\nwhy don't I enjoy life and so on and\nthen while people around them maybe are\nsuffering and you know but I see it in I\nlive in British Connecticut it's\nBridgeport Connecticut people just don't\nhave contact they don't see it and so\nthere are these cycles that happen many\nof them they coincide the cycle that I'm\ntalking about about attitude about\nprotecting and how do we make a good\nSociety for the most like let's say the\nbasic idea that we should strive for\nEqual Opportunity yes I mean that's a\nfundamental thing equal opportunity\nright but that doesn't become the banner\nthat either is\npursuing so these cycles of conflict\nwealth gaps and all of those things\nexist yeah it seems like to me when I\nhear that it perpetuates and the cycle\ncontinues because it seems that not\nenough people have experience exactly\nright yeah the cycle lasts\nuh longer than a lifetime so you're only\ngoing to experience that piece of the\ncycle in your lifetime right Wars\ndepressions okay they happen throughout\nhistory are we not going to go into a\nwar again are we not going to have\nanother depression that's of course at\nsome point we're going to have those\nthings okay but we were lucky\n1945 was the end of the last war we\nbegan a new era we had this cycle in\nwhich things got better and better and\nand there was a quality better equality\nI know the world I went was born into I\nwas lucky I was born in 1949. I had two\nparents who could take care of me I went\nto a public school and I came out to a\nworld which for me was a world of equal\nopportunity okay you when you have those\ntypes of things and then things evolve\nand we're in a very different part of\nthe cycle now they mount the printing of\nmoney the internal conflict the external\nconflict those types of things we're in\na different environment now and we have\nto recognize that and why we never\nexperienced it yeah if we experienced it\nand had that that Terror for it or the\nchoice of what could be the joy of the\nalternative we would be in a different\nposition yeah it also sounds like we\nhaven't experienced that but we also\nhaven't experienced what it feels like\nto live in a culture of higher values\nright so like when you were talking\nabout early and I'm going a bit more\nmicro but to take it macro again when\nyou said in you know we create an\norganization where it's about meaningful\nwork meaningful relationships you know\nuh radical transparency if you've never\nworked in a culture like that you don't\nknow the value of it and therefore you\nnaturally have a culture of disagreement\narguments disconnection and so it's\nalmost like how do we get to a point\nwhere\neveryone does like you'll always go and\nI'm going very micro here but you'll\nalways go for the junk food unless\nyou've had healthy tasty food right it's\njust natural because we've been\nprogrammed to look for sugars carbs fats\nyou'll go for that unless you've had\nhealthy tasty food accessible yes and so\non a macro level the challenge again\ncomes that if you have junk values and\nyou have healthy values you naturally go\nfor the junk values because that's what\nserved you and so it's like how do you\ngive people at scale an experience of\nhow living with equal opportunity or\nother healthy values is actually better\nfor everyone right like it's how do we\ndo that is that is that possible is that\nthe goal I think it's uh the same as\ngood parenting good mentoring and the\ngood work that you're doing\nright there are people on this broadcast\nand you're helping a lot of people and\nI'm trying in my way to do the same and\nthen\num it's up here comes in here and then\nit has to be that visceral experience it\nso that you start to experience the\nrewards of it so that you're afraid of\nnot doing it right habit okay I talked\nabout 18 months okay you can change the\nbehavior in 18 months by and large\nbehavioral change is like an 18-month\nthing if you take\num somebody's alcohol it's Anonymous or\nif you take other things can you develop\nthe subliminal\num cue that you're working off of to\nproduce a reaction that becomes\ninstinctual so you do it that is the\npath and wherever it comes from whether\nit's coming from this that whatever\nwe're doing and then action that's taken\nto change one's habit and then\nexperience the rewards of it that you\nknow that's the cycle I'm just answering\nyou scientifically right I'm\npsychologically scientifically that's\nwhat it is it's not a philosophical\nanswer it's just the way it is yeah no\nbut that's what it is it's it's building\na new culture and the culture starts\nwith each individual building it within\nthemselves right and so you're making\nanother good point it's those things\nthat I just said\nin a reinforcing environment in which\nothers share those things and then it\nmakes it the better because that group\nreinforcing it which is a culture it has\na great great power over what's going to\nhappen culture is Destiny\nculture's Destiny well what are some of\nthe things that you think are after all\nthese years after all this study After\nAll This research have become healthy\nthings to Aspire for I think to be a\nhuman means to Aspire like we're always\nseeking aspiring wanting something\nwhat do you think uh healthy things or\nhow can people discover because I think\nwe all you know everyone could go down\nthe path and think okay there was a time\nit's where you said like there was a\ntime when all I wanted was money or\nsuccess and then often when people get\nthat they go well that was good but that\nwasn't it is the goal to just seek and\nAspire for what you feel at the time and\nthen change it when you get there\nbecause you've realized that wasn't it\nor are there certain healthy\ncharacteristics or values that you think\npeople can Aspire for I do uh agree on\nthe journey and the evolutionary process\nof in other words you go after something\nyou experience it you learn and you\nevolve and you're so I believe it's an\nevolutionary process okay so I think it\nis evolve well\nand contribute to Evolution if I was to\nsay for me what my aspiration is is\nevolve well and contribute to Evolution\nto know yourself that's why um to know\nyourself means know your nature\nI put out a free test for everybody at\nonce it's called principles you yes it's\nit's the universally determined like the\nmost effective test principles you it's\nfree online you can go online and and\nunderstand yourself and it helps you\nunderstand other types of people so\nknowing one's nature\nand then finding the path for that\nnature is a very important thing and\nnumber three I would say\nis Meaningful work and meaningful\nrelationships yeah for most people yes\nif you have something you're into and\nit's a passion and you have wonderful\nrelationships it's from almost all\npeople wonderfully rewarding so I would\nsay it's you know those those three\nthings right there's a beautiful answer\nthere's always such a joy and pleasure\nto talk to you I always learn so much\nand and you you set the tone when you\nsaid jazz\nyou you gave us full permission to just\ngo off peace and and really co-create\nand I I love where we got to I you know\nwhen we spoke last week and we were\nsaying what should we talk about and I\nnever thought it would go in this\ndirection but I'm So Satisfied by this\nmeaningful conversation because I think\nwe went somewhere we didn't plan to and\nthat always feels like a better end than\nwhat you did plan to as well well this\nwas like playing good jazz yeah but this\nis in the end no no no please like what\nI'm telling you is that I'm coming back\nat you man right oh okay so I am going\nto you asked me a lot of questions okay\nbut what I'm going to do is I'm coming\nat you for your principles okay I want\nyou uh articulate and I'm gonna give you\nthose things because I want that to be\nput out okay and distributed and I want\npeople to vote them up for the best\nsituation how do you deal with a divorce\na death in the family whatever I'm gonna\ngive you a bunch of those types of\nquestions what's your formula for\nSuccess okay so imagine now there's Jay\nchetty's and there's other people there\nthat they can vote those things up to\nget whatever they think is the best\nwhich is essentially creating the\nprinciples for themselves or almost the\nway of life the religion for themselves\nthat they think is going to be best so I\nthink that's a Paramount importance I\ncan't wait for that I'm so excited I'm\nso excited to contribute more excited to\nuse uh it sounds like a fantastic\nresource are you you're developing that\nright now yeah and and the goal is that\nit will be every area of Life\nbusiness family that's right I want\nanybody on anything that's on the\nprinciples right that's how you just\npush the button you say I need help with\nI've got a I don't know a add\nfour-year-old yeah yeah okay yeah push\nthe button what's the best principle\nI'll be amazing okay that's what I'd\nlike to do so uh tell me in terms of the\nJourney of of Life what are you going\nafter\nand why how do you look at your journey\nof Life what are you going after why and\nthat's you\nand then what do you think other people\nshould do for their journey of life\nbecause they may go after different\nthings so give me the more General\nanswer that may not be\nuh just yours so there's a few steps to\nthis\nthe first thing I'd say as a general is\nthat there are\nfour really important decisions that I\nbelieve we have to make in life\nand the first principle is how do I feel\nabout myself\nI think that's a really important\ndecision and choice we get to make every\nday is who am I and how do I feel about\nwho I am and who I want to be how do I\nfeel about myself now when we get there\nI'm going to go to a principal that's\ngoing to help please I'm going to pull I\nlove it pull it out of you okay yeah\nso what do you do do you then\num as you're making these choices say\nI'm experiencing this and therefore I\nfeel better and then therefore that\nhelps guide me on what I should do yeah\nso I think with that one it I think\nwe're very aligned on the aspect of\nnature I think we're very aligned on\nthat it's why I love the principles you\nassessment like the idea of knowing that\nthere is a wiring in the way that we've\nbeen created and evolved that allows us\nto be effective and so for me I have a I\nhave a short formula for that and it's\npassion plus strength plus service so I\nbelieve that your passion is what makes\nyou happy and when you use your passion\nin the service of others it makes other\npeople happy and so when you add your\npassion to your strengths and you add it\nto service or contribution it equals\nwhat it equals purpose okay purpose\npurpose yeah okay so people have have to\nhave a purpose okay and that equals the\npassion plus the strength strength plus\ncontribution or service the ability to\nuse that in the service okay there we go\nyeah there's a formula there right\nthere's a principle yes okay yeah that's\nthe general that's the general like\nthat's the that's only the first\ndecision and that's the formula for the\nfirst decision overarching overarching\nyeah like that for me has been my my\ndedication is to help people figure out\ntheir purpose because I believe that if\nwe have people of purpose they'll be\nbetter people they'll be better Partners\nthere'll be better parents they'll be\nbetter professionals because I think\nwhat's missing in the world is a feeling\nof individual and Collective value I see\nand then we they know that they're\ngetting it because of how they feel\nabout themselves yes I think yeah when\nyou have purpose you I whatever what's\nfascinating about purpose is I think one\nof the the and this is probably quite a\nNuance but\none of the signs of a lack of purpose is\nthat we Envy everyone we want to be like\neveryone we look at what someone does\nand we're like I wish I could do that I\nwish I could do that when one finds a\nsense of purpose one can actually\nappreciate someone else for what they do\nreally well because you realize that's\ntheir nature and that's what they were\nborn to do and this is mine and this is\nwhat I was born to do and so there's a\nlack of Envy I think is a great\nindicator to a sense of purpose like I I\nlove what you do I admire what you do I\ncould never do what you did over all\nthese years not because I'm\ninsignificant or invaluable or I'm not\nsmart it's just because my spots are\ndifferent and I'm meant to be following\na different path and we so agree um\nknowing what your nature is and getting\nthat feedback yeah and by the way I I\nand we both like principles you as a way\nas a step toward that what about the\nlife art yes the second most important\ndecision applies to the first is what do\nI do for money I think that's one of the\nthat's the same and that applies to what\nwe said right so that that applies to\nthe two things those first two things\nare solved by the equation we just\ndiscussed like what do I do for money\nthat's an important decision we have to\nmake in life everyone needs to make\nmoney everyone needs to pay bills so\nthat's already there the third most\nimportant decision we make in life I\ndon't want to skip over that can we\ndrill into that or should we go to the\nnext one no so we can drill into that I\nthink yeah we can drill into that\nabsolutely how do you approach that\nquestion I think that's what I'm saying\nsome parts of it apply to the nature\naspect and I think the part that is\nmissed mostly in that and I love the\nauthor of flow who talks about the\nbeautiful Synergy between our Challenge\nand our skills so he said that we\nexperience flow when our challenge meets\nour skills when our skills are high and\nour challenge is low we feel bored we\nfeel disconnected we feel disengaged but\nwhen our challenges high and our skills\nare low we feel depressed we feel lost\nwe feel confused and so if we want to\nfeel experience flow in life we have to\nfind where our skills meet our Challenge\nand to me that's where how what we do\nfor money I think one of the biggest\nmistakes we make is today people are\nonly focusing on passion and not\nbuilding their skills and their\nstrengths and so to me when you're\nfiguring out what you want to do for\nmoney you have to figure out what skill\nam I willing to get really good at what\nam I genuinely willing to discipline\nmyself to become phenomenal at right and\nif I can do that then that's a good\nthing you're saying and which I I agree\nwith and as we covered know your nature\nand and Discover it along the way but\nalso for me it's if I can make my work\nand passion the same thing and not\nforget about the money part yes\num and then I am going to probably be\nsuccessful because I'll be happy I'll\nalso be good at what I'm doing yes and\nthe money part is an important part that\nyou can't forget about absolutely\nabsolutely I think another principle\nideally is\num to be self-sufficient plus what I\nmean by self-sufficient plus is that\nyou're not dependent on any on the money\ncoming from anybody else if you can yes\nright yes that because you then have if\nit doesn't come from anyone else in that\nway first you're raising yourself to the\nlevel to be self-sufficient and I don't\nreally care whether that's a at a high\nlevel of income or a low level of income\nthe important thing is that you're happy\nthat you pursue goals um yes and that\nhappiness and and that particular thing\nbut if you're self-sufficient process it\nmeans you're Free Yourself sufficient\nand it means also that you can help\nothers if you because you got some plus\num what are your thoughts about\num where that's one of mine yeah what\nabout yours in terms of that measurement\nabout money how do you approach money\nwhat is the right amount of money yeah I\nwould say that we're very aligned I\nthink the right amount of money is\nwhat's right for you and what you're\ncreating but I love the self-sufficient\nplus because I I had this conversation I\nI had to really rewire my relationship\nwith money As I Grew Older because I was\nkind of trained to believe that I always\nneeded just enough I always grew up with\njust enough I saw Zero in my bank I\nstarted working when I was 14 and so\nzero in my bank account for many many\nyears and that was fine it was like okay\nI had just enough I paid for that thing\nokay if I have zero that's good like I\nlived like that from 14 to 21 and then\nwhen I went back into the world of work\nI just realized how that was not the way\nto live and it wasn't I I lived that way\nbecause I had luxury series it was just\nwhat I had it wasn't that I was wasting\nmoney it was just that I never knew how\nto make it keep it save it invest it\nand so when I rewired my relationship\nwith money I love self-sufficiency plus\nbecause to me I also realized that being\nable to contribute being able to give\nback being able to pass on was such a\nhealthy part of it but so often we're\ntrained that Simplicity is having enough\nfor yourself but having enough should\ninclude being able to also give whatever\nthat may be same experience happened to\nme and we're talking about the life Arc\nlike for me up until I I guess it was\nprobably it was certainly my early\ntwenties I was exactly like you like I\nlike to do the things I like to do if\nI've got enough money to do them I'm\nhaving a blast I don't need any more\nthan that yes and then I got to a point\nwhere I started to calculate\nhow many weeks I could live if not a\ndollar came in\nokay if I could live Can I Live a month\ncan I live 12 months yes\num I would calculate if I'm spending at\nthis and I have this and I wanted to\nlive uh have enough freedom of that\nworry that I could have that amount\num and I and I got to the point where uh\nit was about three years if if I could\nhave three years that I knew like I'm\ndowntime and that gives me enough wiggle\nroom and so I started to realize that if\nI took the amount of money I had by the\nrate at which I spent it and I\ncalculated how long it would last yeah\nthat that gave me that kind of\nperspective yes and that and that and\nthen I have a family yeah and then as I\nstart to think of the family that number\nchanges and of course what like you say\neverybody then is an investor correct\nbecause everybody's how has that has to\nput it somewhere got to know about it\nbut I had the same experience I think\nthat experience is part of the life Arc\nyes you know and you're only a part of\nyour life and reassuring to hear that\nyeah it's normal then you get to a\ncertain other part of your life yeah and\nand I think the other thing for me and\nthe measure that I give people is that\nlet's say when you start your working\nlife hopefully it is in this case but I\nthink for the majority of people it will\nbe when you first start your career a\nhundred percent of your time at work is\npotentially doing something you don't\nlove and I think it's good for you yeah\nthat's good for you it's important it\nbuilds resilience it builds character\nit's great but I think success and\nhappiness to me is that as life goes on\nthat percentage starts to get lower and\nlower well I think it is I I think it's\njust that you do things for me anyway\nyeah it's that I do things that I don't\nlove because I get things that I love\nmore yes I I couldn't agree more I I say\nthat about my life today when everyone's\nlike oh Jay you must love your life and\nI'm like I do plenty of things that I\ndon't love to do in order to make time\nand space to do what I love to do and do\nmore of I fully agree but I think that\npercentage needs to shift because you\ndon't want 100 of your time at work to\nbe doing something you don't love\nanother principle I would say and I want\nto get your thoughts I'm going to pull\nout your principle is uh own it and\ndon't be the victim\nwhat what I mean yes yes yes that person\nwho describes\nyou know this terrible thing and also\ntends to blame others I didn't this\nthing happened and that thing happened\nis probably not looking at it as what do\nI do in this chest lit Game of Life yeah\nthat is now having these things come at\nme where if you own it and you say\nlisten this is your game this is your\nlife and these things come at you yeah\nand now it's your move and you've got to\nmake those moves right so you're\nthinking not woe is me but you're\nthinking okay now I've got to do that\nyes I think that's an important approach\nto life what do you think and what is or\nyour version of something like that feel\nfree to totally disagree no no I I wish\nI mean I I'm nothing I wish I disagreed\nwith you I I don't because I I think\nthere's a lot of similarities I've\nalways got it changed the situation\nchange yourself and it's like I think a\nlot of us those are two choices and I\nthink a lot of the time we put a lot of\nenergy into changing a situation\nand to me that's a lot of the time\nthat's out of our control what we were\ndiscussing like I can't decide the\nweather today I can't decide whether\nsomeone's going to like me because of\nhow I behave with them I can't change\nsomeone's complete energy or Aura\ntowards me I can't always change the\nsituation but I can change how I view it\nI can change myself and Wayne Dyer had a\nbeautiful statement where he said that\nwhen we change the way we look at things\nthe things we look at change and I think\nthat's always been very important to me\nis that if I can't change the situation\nhow can I look at it differently how can\nI change the lens through which I'm\nperceiving this so I hear that connected\nto the thing that you said earlier about\nwhether you're feeling good for yourself\nyeah and it brings up another is don't\nworry so much about the approval of\nothers yes yeah that's a great one I\nmean that's that's a huge one I mean\nthat's at the core of so much of this\nit's I I talk about in in my book think\nlike a monk I talk about the four c's\nfor the four types of people you'll meet\nin your life and the problem is which\ntrying to find one person to do all four\nof them so some people in life are going\nto have character you go to them because\nyou know they have High character that's\nwhy you trust them they may not always\nbe around they may not always be\navailable they may not be you know they\nmay not be next to you every day but you\ngo to them because you know if you want\nto make a decision with high integrity\nthat person is a person of High\ncharacter then you have someone in your\nlife who's consistently there you have\nsomeone who's always been your friend\nthey've always been around they don't\nnecessarily give the best advice or the\nworst advice but they're consistent\nthey're there they're with you they they\nwill go through the trenches with you\nand they're consistent they don't always\nhave the best next move or the best idea\nor Insight but they have value in the\nfact that they're loyal they're\nconsistent but that is their value in\nknowing that the third is care someone\nwho cares about you always give the idea\nof my my mother like if I called my mom\nright now I said Mom I was just with Ray\nI just interviewed Ray dalio Orlando\nshe'll just be like have you eaten today\nlike that's what my mom would ask me she\nsaid what did you have for breakfast\nI'll be like Mom like I just spoke to\nrain she'll be like no no what did you\nhave for breakfast what are you having\nfor lunch right that's it's someone who\ncares for me I'm not necessarily going\nto go to my mum to ask her for advice\nfor my podcast but I know she's the\nperson that cares for me like I know\nshe'll be there for me no matter what\nand the final one is competence there\nare people in our life who are high\ncompetence they may not care about us\nthey may not have High character but\nthey're very competent in what they do\nand they may take advice from them in\nthat so to me knowing who to get\napproval of in different areas if I try\nand get career approval from my mom she\nmay never give it to me because she's\nnot happy for me to be on a plane and\nshe's not happy for me to be running\naround and missing meals she she doesn't\napprove of that at the same time I don't\nneed my spiritual teacher for example I\ngo to him because he's of High character\nbut if I asked him for business advice\nhe'd say to me well this is my Integrity\nprinciple but he's not necessarily going\nto give me investment advice so I think\nbecoming very clear about who I went to\napproval for what became very useful you\nsee um these are coming out nice and uh\nquickly it's like playing jazz you know\nyes there's something that happens\nreally quickly and it happens but very\nimportant to slow that down because I'm\ngoing to be able to take this okay yes\nno no this is\nsaying then to convert it to principles\nyeah so that somebody can look it up yes\nokay is going to be this is why it's so\ngreat yeah because I can take what\nyou've done and we can put it there and\nthen somebody says when I go for that\nmonth how do I push the button yeah and\nget the answer yeah right it's going to\nbe brilliant okay that that's this is a\nthis is an important thing it's going to\nbe fantastic right so I want to just\nkeep pulling these I love that I love\nthings from you right yeah I love it I\ncan't wait to do more and and you know I\nwouldn't we won't go into depth on these\ndecision three and decision four the\nthird most important decision we make in\nlife is who do we give our love to and\nwho do we receive love from I think it's\na huge decision the most it may be the\nmost maybe one of the most important one\nof the most important decisions the most\nimportant decision I I just just at my\nuh so I'm sorry for that no I want to\nhear from you I was just at my uh uh one\nof my son's weddings and I was just\ndescribing what it is and the peace that\nI have and I was making the point which\nI truly believe is who you pick as your\nlife partner the person you wake up with\nin the morning uh and who is in that\nlife partner yeah is the most important\ndecision you can make probably it's it's\ncertainly right up there so you're\ntouching on that so go I didn't mean to\nno no I wouldn't I mean no hearing about\nyour son's ready I fully agree that's\nwhat I hear you saying yeah yeah so\nexactly that and and I think for me I\nbroke that down from from research from\ncoaches from working with clients in\nthat space who have been married for a\nlot longer than I have and of course it\nwould be wonderful to get your feedback\nand and wonderful Jim who's both of our\nbook agents as well who's had a very\nlong marriage himself and so I'm always\nstress testing my ideas with Jim I'm\nsaying Jim what do you think of this but\nI came with three things uh the first\nthing is this is the obvious one it's\nlike liking someone's personality you\nhave to like them they have to like you\nthat's obvious we know that there's a\nsense of compatibility more than just\nchemistry I think people often I was\nlikening recently an analogy of like\nchemistry is like a spark like you light\na match there's like the spark you hear\nthe sound you see the fire but then the\nFlame's gonna burn out the match is\ngoing to last like this long but if you\nuse that match to burn a candle that\ncandle is going to give scent forever\nit's going to last it's gonna burn and\nbe beautiful for so many people to\nexperience so that's that compatibility\npiece the second piece which I think is\nrare is like a deep awareness and\nrespect for each other's values so I\nthink if you really love someone they\ndon't necessarily have the exact same\nvalue use I don't think they have they\nmay have similar versions but they're\nnever exactly the same and I think\nrespecting and being aware and\nencouraging the other person towards\ntheir values is really healthy so I\nalways give the example of me and my\nwife my wife her first value is family\nthat's her number one value and my\nnumber one value is purpose they're very\ndifferent and they can be conflicting\noften I want to be on a plane when we\nhave a family event I'm I'm at an event\nwhen we're doing this but we found a way\nof respecting each other's values and\nthen showing each other that we respect\nit but we're not forcing each other to\nhave the same value because we're\ndifferent people and then the third and\nfinal one I found is uh a dedication to\nhelping that person get to their goals\nfor them to reach their potential that I\nlove you so much that I'm going to help\nyou get to your goal not my projection\nof who you should be or who I wish for\nyou to be but who you want to be I'm\ngoing to help you because I think that's\nthe greatest act of Love is that if you\nreally love someone you want to see them\nbecome the best well I'm very excited\nabout taking these and putting them in\nthe writing and pushing the buttons so\neverybody I'm excited and they're all in\nmy new book eight rules of love so that\ncomes out next year 31st what is it\ncalled Eight rules of Love okay it's\ninteresting have you uh taken the test\nof five types of love I have yes yes\nvery good it's a great test yeah it was\nso interesting to see if we did it at uh\nfamily you know yes my son's\ndaughter-in-laws what are yours I'm\ninterested what are Your Love Languages\nwell um I'm um\nacts of Love okay active service yeah I\nam not the compliments yes yeah not\nwords of affirmation words\nright right yeah don't give me the word\nokay good to know and it's so\ninteresting because\num I S I see it all the time in our\nrelationship yes so being able to\narticulate that yes I forgot what the\nother ones are there's uh there's uh\nwords of affirmation\ngifts touch and Time and Time quality\ntime yeah yeah quality time that's\nimportant too but I see it when we did\nthe little test yeah and we did it we\ncould see where sometimes it was going\nlike that yes yeah oh yeah completely it\ncan be totally opposite yeah in other\nwords I'm I'm giving you something yeah\nand you're not appreciating it because\nyou're looking for the other type\nexactly and it's so handy to do and\nthese personality profile tests are\nvaluable in finding out our nature and\noperating that way so I'm looking\nforward to your book no thank you I I\nthink what you're doing in extratic\nprinciples and putting them in one place\nI think that's really special because\nyeah if I went through my first book and\nnow my second book there's so many\nprinciples in there but like you said\nyou know you have to flick pages to find\nthem to be able to just search into an\nengine is is a brilliant I created a uh\nwhat I call a coach and it's in this uh\nthis app principles for action and the\nway it works is because I was thinking\nwhat do I need an answer to and then it\ngets you to the right principle yeah\nyeah because if you have a book of\nprinciples you don't have that access so\nthe app is needed to be able to say okay\nhere I am I'm in this situation\npoem button get the right ones because\nyou'll never find them you'll never\nraise that book again yeah why not use\nit yeah absolutely much quicker and and\neasily accessible and I think the the\nfourth one to finish it off to finish\noff my my piece at least was um the\nfourth most important decision in the\nworld is that we make in our lives is uh\nhow do we serve the world how do we how\ndo we help the world and it's\ninteresting to hear you because those\nfour decisions that I talked about they\nmoved through the four stages of life as\ndefined by The Vedas which is what I\nstudied as a monk and so the four stages\nwhich I've reconfigured into my language\nare love yourself love hot others heal\nfrom Pain and then love the world and I\nfeel like that's the journey that we're\nbeing encouraged to go on in life is we\nfirst have to learn to love ourselves\nsecond we learn to love others our wives\nkids families uh third we have to\nactually heal from the pain of love\nbecause sometimes love can uh you know\nthere's a few Thorns along the way\nthere's a few challenges and I feel\nsometimes we hold on to that bitterness\nand when you cure that bitterness you\nactually get the ability to love\neveryone love everyone you meet and love\nthe world so the fourth stage is how do\nwe learn to serve the world how do we\ncontribute to the world which you're\ndemonstrating at this stage in your life\nwhere you're like I want to give back I\nwant to I want to help and so\nthat's the fourth one and it's so wise I\nthink that I didn't really appreciate\nin the middle part of my life The Power\nof Love I think that there's\naccomplishment in your focus and\naccomplishment yeah and sometimes that\nhas conflict and you do the conflict\num but you don't realize\nhow enjoyable love is how enjoyable\ngiving love is yes and receiving love is\nyes or being in a loving Community which\nis also one of the reasons that the\nenvironment that that I perceive now is\nso repugnant to me because it has so\nmuch the opposite of love it has so much\nhate it has so much anger it has so much\nfighting in it that's so destructive\nthat's so toxic so that love and a\nsociety that has that oh it is true that\nthe greatest joy you get is that\nexperience of helping others and them\nand the connections and all of that and\nit produces a an environment that you\nwant to be in absolutely absolutely and\nI think that for those who are listening\nand love feels\nethereal or elusive I think as a basic\nfor me love is like safety plus\nunderstanding right if someone feels\nsafe and someone feels understood that\nis the beginning of Love It Isn't Love\nin itself but people need to feel a\nsense like I feel safe with you and I\nfeel understood by you you know that's\nthe beginnings of that feeling and in a\nworkplace safety and understanding are\nvery core aspects that could easily be\nimplemented and even in a relationship\nmy view of what love is\nis that I\nfeel what you feel\nso that it brings me happiness yeah\nbecause you have a relationship that ah\nyou're well yes ah you're happy yes and\nand that brings me happiness yes that's\nwhat yeah that's beautiful yeah yeah\nfeeling other people's pain feeling\nother people's love like being able to\nhave that ability it hurts me yeah if it\nbrings me joy yeah yeah that is love\nyeah that is really beautiful and and\nyeah I think that's what it's so great\nwe've talked about so many\ndifferent topics today and it's amazing\nhow how love is that one unifying force\nthat we're all seeking for but it's\nalmost like\nthere's just so many we've created so\nmany barriers to love\nbecause we think love makes us weaker to\nsome degree we feel that feeling someone\nelse's pain or feeling someone else's\nJoy somehow takes it away from us and\nand think like a monk I call it the um I\nsay that there are there are unlimited\nseats in the theater of happiness\nbut we're living in a world that has\nmade us believe there are a finite\nnumber of seats because now if you want\nto go see a big sports game they're a\nfinite number of seats there are finite\nnumber of VIP tickets and so that\nmindset has made us believe that even in\nthe theater of Happiness there are a\nfinite number of seats but the be\nreassured that your name is on a seat\nand and you can claim it no one else can\nhave that seat it's there waiting for\nyou and well for me love works in that\nit reinforces my well-being and it\nreinforces my joy because that's part of\nthat evolutionary process because I also\nget what your happiness is and that's\nthe sense because it's interesting\npsychologists uh in terms of what is\nproduced happiness they show that uh\npast a certain basic level of income or\nmoney\num there's not a correlation between\nhappiness and Ma and money yes\num the highest is community across\nsocieties if you have a sense of\ncommunity yeah you have a higher level\nof happiness you live longer all of\nthose things that is love that is\nconnectivity I think that's a real power\nyeah it's almost like saying like it's\nnot about the journey it's not about the\ndestination it's about Community like\nthat's the key thing meaningful work and\nmeaningful relationships is a powerful\ncombination yeah yeah well I could do\nthis with oh so could I I mean we could\nliterally I'm so glad you did this yes\nright yeah this is beautiful I'm so\nhappy that you flipped him back on me I\ngot to share some things that I haven't\nreally talked about in that way yet so\nyou can expect more yes I I'm gonna\norganize it I want to help me organized\nyeah I know that we put those principles\nin a good way I think that is such a\ngenius idea honestly I'm all in any any\nhelp and support I can give to\nformatting sharing amplifying I'm in\ngreat it sounds incredible great\nhonestly the world will be a better\nplace yeah I'm looking forward to that\nwhat is it called This is the app this\nis on the Apple this is separate to the\napp well this is going to be built out\non the app perfect we have the means by\nwhich we can collect them now we haven't\nbuilt the voting them up yet got it so\nthere's going to be aren't connected to\nthis yeah all people will input their\nprinciples and we're going to have all\nof these things and they can go on and\nthey say Jay shetty's principles yeah\num that'll exist that's so cool\num and take a clip of this tape and put\nit on or whatever it is so that people\ncan see it uh but the voting upwards\nbuilding so that has to be built that's\nbrilliant and we have a a tool called\nthe coach that will help to get them to\nthe right principles but that's got to\nbe built up more that's amazing well we\nto figure out the coach as well there\nwill be some synergies
