a huge Splash in\nthe fashion industry Victoria Secret\nAngel Taylor Hill let's talk about the\ngrief of losing a friend I'm looking at\nhim and I'm asking him like if you if\nyou need to go like

Wellness\npodcast Jett J shett the one the only\nJett what would you say is your earliest\nchildhood memory that you feel has\ndefined who you are today my first\nmemory ever is my I think it was my\nthird birthday party I so I was born in\nChicago and I lived there until I was\nwas probably about 5 years old and then\nI moved to Colorado and that's like my\nhome and where I am from in my head cuz\nI don't really remember Chicago but I\nremember being in our backyard there and\nwe had this little red house\nand it was my birthday party and all of\nthe kids in our neighborhood were over\nand we were having a party and I had a\npink Barbie cake and I specifically\nremember the candle was Barbie like it\nwas a very intricate candle and\neveryone's singing happy birthday and\nthen I'm supposed to blow up the candles\nand then my friend he blew the candles\nout before I could and I got so upset\nand I was very emotional and I was like\nkind of crying and I got so mad and I\nwas like why would you do that oh my\ngosh like I was supposed to do that and\nthen my mom's like it's okay we can you\nknow we'll light the candle again and\nthen you can blow out the candle and I\nwas like well it's not the same he took\nmy wish like I was heartbroken and I\nthink if that says anything about me\nit's just that I'm I'm very\nemotional and I I just sometimes when\npeople do things that aren't so nice to\nothers I sometimes don't understand I'm\nlike why why did you do that so that's\none of my very first first memories um\nbut I think something that kind of\nhelped like maybe Define who I was when\nfrom a child I would say um is Sports um\nI I was um a gymnast from I from when I\nwas nine I did ballet from when I was\nsix and then I grew up snowboarding and\num I think for me being athletic and\nbeing active really help shape who I am\nbecause um I've been you know I've been\nmodeling for 14 years I was scouted at\n14 and I love my job and I love working\nand I I have such a passion and a drive\nfor it and I think I have such a drive\nbecause of being in sports my whole life\nand honestly being a gymnast not a not a\nvery good gymnast but I loved it I had\nso much fun doing it even though I\nwasn't my mom was like this girl a she's\nnot going to the Olympics that was\nunderstood but you know she encouraged\nme to do it anyway and she knew I had\nfun and you know it gives you sort of\nthis sense of structure and you know\nhealthy competition is always a little\nbit nice and um I love the of gymnastics\nbecause it's very um demanding in a\nsense and it challenges you to always be\nbetter you know the sort of motto of\ngymnastics or what um my uh perception\nof it was from doing is you know strive\nto be better strive for Perfection\nPerfect 10 all that stuff you'll never\nget there you'll never well some people\ndo but I I was never going to be a\nperfect 10 let's be honest um but you\nknow having the drive to like always do\nbetter always you know perfect this\ntrick perfect that flip do do this do\nthat and you know push myself it was and\nand push myself in something I enjoyed\ndoing um kind of gave me the I have a\nsimilar head space and my modeling\ncareer just because I love doing it and\nI I love my job and I just want to like\nI just want to keep doing it you know so\nI I think that's two things about me\nyeah those are great answers are you do\nyou still know the person who blew that\ncandle out I do yes I do I I hadn't seen\nI haven't seen him in forever but I did\ngo back home to my where I was born a\ncouple times like throughout my\nchildhood my my god parents and my my\nmom and dad's best friends um they still\nlived there and their children were our\nuh childhood best friends so we would\nspend Summers together and everything\nand um some Summers I would go back to\nuh Chicago and like see them and all\nthat and see the kids in the\nneighborhood so I did see this boy\nmultiple times and he was a really good\nfriend it was very innocent you know we\nwere only maybe 3 years old so he didn't\nknow was doing either but I just didn't\nunderstand I was like does he realize\nnow what a big moment he probably\ndoesn't even remember that he did that\nbut I do yeah and he he probably doesn't\neven know I'm talking about him but I'm\nnot going to say his name but we know\nwell how was that like when the Bobby\nmovie came out was that like has Barbie\nalways remained an idol in your life\nsince that day or not really you know I\nloved I loved Barbie I have um two\nsisters and I I actually have three\nsiblings so I have an older sister a\nyounger sister and a younger brother and\nwe're all very close in and age we're\nall about you know roughly one year\napart from each other so growing up we\nloved playing dress up we loved Barbie\nwe loved toys we loved you know Polly\nPockets we loved little My Little Pet\nShop you know we had all of those things\nwe loved all of that um and I loved the\nBarbie movie I thought it was great and\nI thought it was really profound and it\ntouched on a lot of things and a really\ninteresting and kind of a light-hearted\nway so yeah I had a I had a childhood\nconnection to Barbie for sure so I loved\nher and then when the candle was blown\nout I was I was like how could you do\nthat to me I can see it still affects\nyou tell day still that here what was it\nlike you you said of course you got\nscouted at 14 what was it like you have\nsiblings I'm assuming they weren't all\nworking at 14 and so when you start\nworking at 14 which is a very young age\nfirst of all what does working at 14 as\na model look like like what are the\nhours what are the commitments do you\ndrop out of school and how do your\nsiblings react to it how do your parents\nreact to it like what does it look like\nbecause I feel yeah they're they're not\nworking they're not getting paid they're\nnot traveling yeah it was interesting I\nmean so my mom uh was a hairdresser so\nshe worked in a salon and cut hair and\nuh you know after having all four of us\nshe obviously was like I can't stand on\nmy feet all day and take care of four\nyoung children under the age of five so\nwe're not going to do that anymore and\nshe became stay-at home mother with\nwhich um I'm I'm so grateful to have had\nmy mom and that's a that's a job it's\nwork and she was amazing at it and you\nknow when I was scouted and I started\ntraveling and you know working as a\nmodel it it meant that you know I went\nto New York I signed with IMG when I was\n14 and from there I went everywhere you\nknow I I traveled the world at you know\n14 years old and my mom came with me\neverywhere I went you know I did Paris\nfashion weeks I did New York Fashion\nWeek I went to Australia and I lived\nthere for a month or two you know Milan\nall those places and she came with me\neverywhere and um I definitely wouldn't\nbe where I am if it wasn't for my mom\nand her support and I know it was a\ndifficult thing for even her to navigate\nshe had three other children at home and\nyou know we were all trying to figure\nout how we were going to do this um my\ngrandpa was a huge help he you know\nwould come with me places as well and he\nwould live with me places he lived with\nme in LA for a bit he traveled with me\nand then when my older sister was 18 she\nwould travel with me and she would live\nwith me which wasn't much help she was\n18 and I was 17 so you can imagine how\nfun that was for us to do but you know\nmy mom always wanted to make sure I had\nsomebody with me who was just like\nanother set of eyes making sure I was\ngood and I you know I I could take care\nof myself and she made sure to teach me\nhow to you know read signs in an airport\nand this is what this means this is how\nyou get to your gate and this is what\nyou how you do this and you know don't\ntake a car ride from a stranger you know\nso um she was really really good at\nmaking sure I was able to do all that um\nand then my siblings you know I think it\nwas really we we just didn't know you\nknow you don't know what you don't know\nand I think we didn't really know any\nbetter better and it was like oh well\nthis is Taylor's doing this so this is\nwhat she does now um and they were you\nknow nothing changed I think for them\ncuz they didn't never see me differently\nthey were just like well Taylor goes to\nwork instead of goes to school so\nwhatever you know and I think because we\nwere all a similar age they did have an\nunderstanding of what I was doing you\nknow it's not like they were you know\nreally young and didn't get it or much\nolder than me and didn't understand why\nI didn't want to go to school or didn't\ngo back to college and stuff they were\nkind of you know accepting of it and my\nolder sister now is a photographer and a\ncontent creator herself so she really\ngot it you know she gets it and she she\nsaw what I wanted to do and you know\nthat I loved what I was doing so she was\nreally helpful and supportive of that so\nyeah it was it was definitely\ninteresting I look back on it and I'm\nlike oh wow how did we do that I don't\nknow we just kind of did it you know\nyeah um at the time was it exciting or\nwas it scary or what parts were exciting\nand what parts were scary I was really\nexcited just because I I wasn't very\ngood at school and I didn't love being\nin school I was really\num distracted daydreaming kind of didn't\npay attention very well I didn't learn\nthings very easily not very good at\nmath um and I remember the first time\nbeing on a set and feeling so excited\nbecause I was like oh my God I can do\nthis instead and once I started booking\nmore and more jobs and school became\nmore and more difficult to keep up with\nyou know we looked into so many\ndifferent options like did do\nhomeschooling for a little bit and\nultimately that was still really\ndifficult based off of how much I was\nworking because you know you have to put\nin at least 5 to six hours a day even on\nonline school you know because you have\nto commit an hour or so for each class I\nwas in different time zones getting\none-on-one time with my teachers to\nexplain something to me was very\ndifficult um so you know I tried to go\nback to regular high school but you know\nin Colorado they don't have these child\nentertainment laws like they do in\nCalifornia there was no structure for me\nto be able to do both so ultimately I\ndropped out of high school and I got my\nGED instead and I just I left school\ntotally at 15 and started full-time\nmodeling at 15 and to me it was really\nexciting cuz I felt like I all I would\nthink about while I was in school was I\ncan't wait to get out of here\nuh stay in school you know what I mean\ndon't do what I do no I'm just kidding\num I do value school I think education\nis really important but I do think that\nit's not always for everyone and people\nlearn differently and I feel like I went\nto sort of a school of life I guess you\ncould say I kind of learned by doing and\nby seeing the world so I have a\ndifferent education than what Academia\nmaybe teaches you so um I am grateful\nthat I got to experience some school\nobviously like and a normal childhood to\nan extent until about 15 but I'm\ngrateful I started I left and I was done\nand doing what I was doing by 15 I felt\nlike okay this is it this is what I'm\nsupposed to be doing so I was just\necstatic I was just I was where I was\nmeant to be you know yeah yeah it's\namazing hearing your passion and drive\nlike after all these years you said\nyou've been modeling for 14 years and I\ncan feel like it's still this energizing\nfeeling what was that transition like\nfrom that to becoming a Victoria Secret\nmodel like what is that Journey like\nlike what is that Arc like like how hard\nis it to move from Paris fashion week\nand New York Fashion Week and doing\nrunways and then going to actually be a\nVictoria Secret model at the time it was\nreally interesting because you know at\nthat time Victoria's Secret was the end\nall be all you know what I mean it was\nnot to everyone but to a lot of models\nit was oh my gosh you know the Victoria\nSecret fashion show it gave you more of\na mainstream name I guess you were more\nI guess in the the stream the the pulse\nof Pop Culture I guess if you were a\nVictoria Secret model some of the most\nfamous models in the world were Victoria\nSecret models you know you know jaelle\nbnin is like one of my favorites and I\nlove her and look up to her she's why I\nwent to IMG because I was like jelle is\nthat IMG at the time she was I don't\nthink she still is but when I signed\nwith them she was still with them so I\nwas like I want to be where she is and\nCarly Claus is with IMG and I wanted to\nbe where she was so um I I just I feel\nlike when I went from doing you know\nfashion and\num more commercial Brands like I did\nshoot a lot of for for H&M and Forever\n21 and some like some of these younger\nmaybe fashion lines that were more for\nyou know teenagers like myself so I did\nwork a lot with Brands like that and\nthen kind of when I turned 18 I was\nswitching into more of you know adult\nmodeling which is so crazy cuz I was\nstill so young 18 years old um and I\ntried out for the Victoria Secret\nfashion show just because you know cuz\nwhy not everybody wants to do it I\nwanted to try out and I wanted to do\nthis so I went and I auditioned for it\nand when I booked it I was shocked\nbecause I really didn't think that I\nwould get it on the first time and the\non the first audition because so many\npeople go back multiple multiple\nmultiple times but probably because I'd\nhad you know a fashion career and had\nbeen on runways since I was 14 I was\nable to sort of be in the room and kind\nof maybe know a little bit more about\nwhat was happening whereas I feel like\nsome girls start modeling at 18 16 18\nyou know so they're still new and newer\nand I even though I was still really\nyoung I had been working for 4 years so\num I I felt ready for it and I was\nexcited for it and when I booked it I\nwas shocked and I I I was like I can't\nbelieve I'm here right now no way this\nis happening I what so that was really\nscary was scary thing was booking it I\nwas like oh oh God okay all right this\nis happening um but it was an amazing\nthing for my career and I'm really\ngrateful for it and I'm grateful you\nknow that I got to do that because I I I\nwouldn't be sitting here if I hadn't you\nknow so I'm I'm grateful for it for sure\nI keep saying that but I am no I believe\nit how many steps was that audition\nprocess like what does that look like in\nterms of getting there it's well and\nwhat is it like like what are you doing\nI mean it was like 10 years ago now so I\nhave to try and remember what I did but\nI'm pretty sure what happened was I so I\nknew the casting director who was\ncasting for the Victoria Secret fashion\nshow he was casting some of the other\nshows that I'd walked in before like\nMichael Kors and you know a couple of\nthe other New York shows as well as\nshows in in Milan and Paris so I was\nfamiliar with him and for the Victoria\nSecret fashion show you go to a pre-c\ncasting with him and his casting team\nand you know you do the walk they record\nyou they film you they ask you questions\nwhere are you from how old are you what\nagency are you with so it's just a\nlittle bit of your personality or the\nway you talk on on video and then they\ntake your picture and then I guess they\nprobably take it back to the Victoria\nSecret internal casting team that also\ndoes Show casting cuz when you get into\nthe main room at the Victoria Secret\nheadquarters there's five or six people\nat a table in front of you and then five\nor six people behind them sitting in\nchairs and they all have notepads and\nyou know there's a big camera and\nthey're filming you and um you know you\ndo the whole like walk thing and they\nask you to do it again do that so I did\na pre-c casting with the casting\ndirector directly and then I went back\nin for a call back which was the main\ncasting so they had probably seen my\ntape and seen my pre-c casting video and\nthought okay let's request her for our\nmain casting so I went into that and\nthen you know sometimes there's another\none and there's another call back and\nyou know another casting you have to do\nbut I was working in La so I went to my\ncasting and got on a flight and landed\nin LA and got a call that I booked the\nVictoria Secret fashion show so that's\nwhat I did that's how happened to me\nuseful to know I I feel like we it's\nit's like we need a picture in right\nlike because if you've never done it you\njust don't know what the process looks\nlike and you mentioned something that\nI've heard a lot of models talk about\nhow they went from like teen modeling to\nadult modeling and also when you're\nstill a teen and like how was that\nprocess for you because I've heard other\npeople describe it as like it was\nuncomfortable where certain poses or\ncertain clothes or whatever it was like\nI've never worn something like this or\ndid you feel that or was it not like\nthat for you was it just kind of like\nyou enjoyed it it was fun no I didn't I\ndidn't feel like that because I I was\njust happy to be there I was like I'm\njust happy to be here also I love it\nlike I love I loved playing dress up\nwhen I was a kid and i' do it for a\nliving so like how can I not be just\nhaving the best time ever you know\ntrying on all these clothes doing all\nthese things also I did dance wasn't\nvery good at it but I loved it and I\nloved dancing and I loved gymnastics and\nI love moving and you know if you're on\nthe right set and you have the right\nteam around you and you know a lot of\nthe the Victoria Secret team from that\ntime I've known them for a really long\ntime and I have worked with a lot of the\nphotographers in the past and you know\nit felt like a safe space and my memory\nand my interpretation of that\nenvironment was that I was safe so I\nfelt comfortable and I was just like oh\nthis is what we're doing now and um I I\nhad the best time doing it so for me I I\nnever felt afraid to do anything so I\njust was so excited I guess or maybe I\nwas just young and was like whoa I don't\nknow maybe bit of both you know so I I\ndon't I don't know no I love I love I\nnever felt I never I know some people do\nfeel that and that's some I have felt\nlike that for sure definitely but not\nmaybe not in those instances and maybe\nnot at that time just because a\ncombination of you know excitement you\nknow youth never having that experience\nbefore being excited to be there so it\nkind of wiped away the fear a little bit\nmaybe I was a little delusional and kind\nof was like wa this is so cool you know\nit's like rose-colored glasses a little\nbit but I've I've been in some scenarios\nwhere I'm like n maybe not so you know\nyeah no I I I think I mean I love\nhearing that I think for me I mean I\nmoved to LA much later uh in life but\neven for me like as soon as I came to\nthe United States to me being in the US\nis like living in a movie because we\ngrew up watching American television in\nLondon Y and so when I first landed in\nNew York I I visited maybe once or twice\nin my teens with family but I remember\nmoving and like even when I saw like a\nyellow school bus or I saw like a cop\ncar or NYPD or whatever like to me it's\nlike I've only ever seen that in a TV\nshow or a movie and so it's really\nfascinating and then you see the Empire\nState and then when I moved to LA it was\nthe same thing it was wait a minute even\nnow when I'm driving down the streets\nand there's palm trees on either side\nI'm like I'm on vacation because yeah in\nmy head like that's such a it's such a\nalien experience having grown up in\nLondon that you know living in La so I\nkind of have some of that youthful\nenthusiasm around some of these things\ntoo because it reminds me of a time when\nI used to watch TV religiously and and\nwhat I grew up on so I I can resonate\nwith that feeling whereas someone will\nalways be like oh don't you think La is\nlike this or New York's like this I'm\nlike to me it just reminds me of what I\nsaw in the movies like wow I can't\nbelieve I get to be here yeah exactly I\ncan't believe I never imagined in a\nmillion years that my life would look\nthis way and so I'm just taking it all\nin as opposed to seeing gaps and holes\nin it or whatever else it may be yeah\nthere's days where I see gaps and holes\nbut my overarching goal and perspective\nis to\nbe I'm in awe you know and I'm still in\nawe and I can't believe I'm even sitting\nhere right now like this is crazy so you\nknow it's just I definitely that's just\nI think my natural sort of energy and\nwhere I sit with things is just w I'm\nhere whoa how'd I get here and you know\nlike all humans do every day is\ndifferent so there's definitely times\nwhere I'm just like oh whoa this is you\nknow I don't like this I don't like this\nfeeling or what's happening here and\nwhat's going on there so there's\ndefinitely both like I I don't want you\nknow the perception of me to feel like\nshe just whatever she has no idea what's\ngoing on she's in a bubble like and I'm\njust no I just feel I just feel grateful\nand I think the most important emotion\nfor me to feel daily is is is gratitude\nso just I try to remind myself where I'm\nat and where I came from and just be\ngrateful to be here so that's the my\ngenuine consensus on things yeah you\nobviously have a hard work ethic and a\ndrive which is what you were talking\nabout with sports and that discipline\nwalk us through the discipline of being\na Victoria Secret model like the diet\nthe workout the plan the day like the\nhour what does that look like because I\nthink often you again that's another\nthing you don't ever see so you don't\nreally know yeah it's so when I first\nstarted doing Victoria's Secret I was\nvery young and I was very lucky because\nI didn't have to work out that hard and\nI you know didn't have to diee it\nbecause I was 18 and you know 6 feet\ntall so you know you can imagine how um\nlucky I was in terms of that sort of\nstuff but then obviously as I was\nstarting to grow up and mature as a\nwoman in that Arena I I did have to\nstart working out you know there was an\nair there was a time where I was like\nokay well if I want to be in the best\nshape of my life for this one really\nimportant day then I'm going to take it\nI'm going to step it up a notch so there\nwas some preparation probably when I was\nlike 21 to 22 I started you know amping\nit up in terms of like the exercise and\ndiet and stuff like that when we we were\ntraining for the show but you know there\nwas such a sometimes there's such a\nnegative connotation in terms of talking\nabout those things um because I think a\nlot of people have maybe an healthy\nperspective of it because Victoria\nSecret wasn't inclusive and it wasn't a\nwelcome space for everybody you know it\nwas welcome for you know women who were\n6 feet tall and naturally slim and you\nknow and then they were really fit on\ntop of that so if you're an outsider\nlooking in it looks like a really well\nnot everybody looks like that and I\ndon't see myself there yeah fair enough\nlike sometimes even I didn't see myself\nthere you know so I had to train hard to\nget there um but you know I always Tred\nto be um as healthy as I could with it\nand you know keep a positive outlook on\nit for me personally in my journey and\nlike how I went about training for the\nVictoria Secret fashion show I sort of\nlooked at it like maybe an athlete would\nI'm not an athlete obviously but you\nknow the level of training that I would\ndo and the the diets I would be on if a\nfootballer came in and you know started\ntalking about his diet people would\naccept it I think because he is an\nathlete\num but you know if I come in and say how\nI was working out and what I was eating\nbecause I'm a six tall naturally slim\nwoman I think it could be you know taken\nnegatively and misconstrued but I just\nwant to assure people that you know I\ndid do it healthy like I was very\nhealthy when I was doing it this is my\nnatural physique I know that everybody\ndoesn't look like this and not everybody\ncan relate to that and that's I I I hear\nyou and I see you and I hope you you\nknow don't take anything that I say and\nmisinterpret it and say like to look\nlike her I have to do this no don't do\nthat you know do what you need to do and\nfor you and your body um and when I was\ntraining for that I I did what I needed\nto do for my body so I can get into that\num I I did a lot of like hit cardio\ntraining so I had a personal trainer\nwho's amazing um Christina she's she's\nnear and dear to my heart she's so\nintelligent she has you know a nutrition\nbackground as well so she was making\nsure that I was eating eting the amount\nof food I should be eating for the\nexercise that I was doing um and so we\nsort of did like a mix of things it was\nweightlifting I I love weightlifting\nit's really fun I also I'm a crazy\nperson like I love exercise I love\nFitness I like working out it's like\nit's really it's good for my mental\nhealth when I work out I work out\nbecause I want to do it for my mind not\nfor how my body looks um so but for the\nVictoria Secret fashion show obviously I\nwas training for a reason so I I did\ncare about you know muscle definition\nand all that fun stuff um so we did like\nyou know weight training weightlifting\num you know it would be like interval\nlike we would you know Sprint on a\ntreadmill and then hold a plank kind of\nstuff like that and I really liked that\ntype of workout because it was it was\nyou know high energy and going from one\nthing to the next thing and it was\nchallenging and it kind of sort of\nreminded me of maybe my gymnastics\nbackground and the sports I done before\nwhere they're a little bit more Dynamic\nand you're moving around a lot um and\nthen you know for diet I would eat\npretty healthy just um I would eat like\nI would make sure I was gluten-free\nthough just because I think sometimes\ngluten can respond in your body in a\nnegative way so some I know some people\nare gluten-free around the vs show be\ngluten-free for about a month no alcohol\nfor about a month and a half or so up\nleading up to the show day just because\nalcohol is never going to help you if\nyou're trying to like you know gain\nmuscle weight so that was my sort of\ngoal was muscle not never managing or\nwashing my weight um it was more just\nabout you know making sure I was eating\nlean proteins I had like protein shakes\nin the morning I would have a\ngluten-free bagel I would have eggs\nvegetables I ate chicken breast I ate\nsweet potato I ate sushi rice fish I ate\nall kinds of things like that and making\nsure that it was enough based off of\nwhat the kind of exercise I was doing so\nthe trainer that would work with me on\nmy fitness routine she also worked with\nme on the food I was consuming hey you\nneed to make sure you're consuming\nbefore you see me you need to eat this\namount and then we come and we're going\nto work out and we're going to do this\nand then you go home and you have this\nprotein shake so we know you're getting\nthe right nutrients that you need to\nfuel your body so yeah hopefully very\nyeah that was very in depth I love it\nyeah no and I asked Taylor I genuinely\nasked because I I do think it's an\ninteresting thing around the discipline\nand that's why I asked it from that\nperspective because to me the discipline\nthe work ethic the you know the focus\nand and I'm so happy that it was a\nhealthy Journey for you and I think\nwe're taking into account the fact that\nit may not be a healthy Journey for\neveryone and we recognized that that it\ncan cause challenges for others yeah and\nI mean I know that time too it was\ndifficult for so many for women watching\nand I know like the expectation that was\nput on women to look look a certain way\nto I never want to feel like maybe I was\na part of it and perpetuating that just\nbecause of the way it was being\npresented maybe that I was just a like I\nwas just happy to be there again I'm was\njust like w I'm so excited I get to be\nhere um but I know what it meant to to\nsociety I know what it what people\nperceived it as for sure so I do take\nthat into account and I know it's it's a\nlot and I hope people are can maybe\nlisten to to me in my perspective and\nknow like I was trying to be I was\nreally healthy in the way that I was\ntrying to do this and go about this and\nI never want to like perpetuate that\nsomebody should do something or you know\nwork out a certain way to to look like a\nVictoria Secret model because you know\nit's that's not fair and not everybody\nlooks like needs to look like that\nthat's not what's beautiful you know\nbeauty is so much more than what people\nwere trying to make us believe it was at\nthat time so just wanted to put that out\nno I'm glad you clarified that I\nactually think you made a really\ninteresting point though I think what's\ninteresting for example like I love\nwatching basketball I am I have nowhere\nnear the physique of any basketball\nplayer on the planet there's no one my\nsize who plays basketball in height\nphysique whatever else it may be\nand if you saw I don't play basketball\nbut if I was to try and play basketball\nwhen I was younger I was great a\nthree-pointer because I didn't need to\nlike beat anyone or whatever but it's I\nwould never be expected to do what\nsomeone does on the court it's really\ninteresting how the industry is then\nprojected onto people thinking they have\nto be there whereas I can watch\nbasketball knowing I never have to be\nthere and I think that's the part which\nis so interesting that it's almost like\na interesting pressure that if it\nbecomes about beauty yeah it it sets an\nunfair standard but if it's about sports\nlike you just said in one sense you were\ntraining yourself like an athlete but we\nknow we I know I can't be Tom Brady or I\nknow I can't be LeBron James me neither\nyeah yeah and and I'm okay I also can't\nbe Adriana Lima and because that woman\nwas amazing and Jazelle I mean they they\ntrained so much harder than even me I I\ndid my best but but you know I I I did\nwhat I knew I was comfortable and able\nand capable of doing but they are them\nand they're their own person and they\ntrained in their own way and I did it my\nway too so yeah no no no and and I hope\nuh anyone who's listening like the\nreason why I wanted to open up that\nconversation is because it's also\ninteresting to hear from someone who\njust loves what they do is excited about\nit and then naturally there's this\nbigger thing going on uh in society and\nculture and Industry and it's like you\nmight just be doing your thing and not\nknow at a time when you know you don't\nrealize it how did you feel about when\nit stopped and now of course we know\nit's coming back the plan is to be more\ninclusive I'm really glad that it's\ncoming back in a different way and from\na different lens and a different\nperspective because I think you know I'm\nI'm so happy I still work with Victoria\nSecret and I'm you know been a part of\nthe brand for 10 years and I've seen the\nshift that they've made and the changes\nthat they're trying to make and it's to\nme\nit's a little relaxing you know a bit of\na breath of fresh air because now I am\nat a different phase in my life where\nyou know maybe I don't want to work out\nlike that anymore you know know what I\nmean when I was younger and you know it\nwas exciting to do so then sure I could\ndefinitely I was let's do this but you\nknow 10 years later and also I haven't\ndone that show in how many years now how\nlong has it been since the last one you\nknow so five years maybe maybe four\nmaybe more I don't know um you know I I\nI feel when it comes back I I'm excited\nthat it's going to be so so different\nbut also I I hope that we can still\nmaintain some of the the fun some of the\nglamour some of the beauty because I\nthink reclaiming it for ourselves as\nwomen is really important because you\nknow if you want to feel sexy and you\nwant to be sexy I don't think there's\nanything wrong with that but you want to\ndo it for yourself not for in not for\nthe objectification of what men want you\nknow so and I think that's the\ndifference now and I think you know\nthat's definitely the goal with the\nVictoria Secret fashion show\ncoming back is to make sure that women\nare doing it you know we're comfortable\nthey ask me you know what Wings would\nyou want to wear and are you excited\nabout doing this and you know what do\nyou want to see when the show comes back\nand I really appreciate that you know I\nvalue that they're asking how I feel and\nyou know what I would like to see as a\nwoman doing it as a woman who's done it\nbefore and you know will probably do it\nagain so um I'm just I'm excited that\nit's going to be very different and I\nhope that it can be perceived in a way\nthat's you know not setting an\nunrealistic Beauty standard because\nthat's what it 100% what it was and you\nknow maybe I was maybe some of that like\nexpectation was put on me but I didn't\nrealize it at the time because I was so\nyoung you know I didn't you don't again\nyou don't know what you don't know and\nnow that I'm 28 you know 10 years later\nfrom my first show if I look back on my\nfirst show it's kind of like I'm sure so\nmany women who were at that show felt\nsuch an intense pressure to look a\ncertain way and work out a certain way\nand that's probably why some people had\nan unhealthy relationship with it and\nmaybe just the timing of my age and\nwhere I was at and where my heads space\nwas at I got really lucky that I didn't\nfeel any of those things but that\ndoesn't mean it still wasn't happening\nfor other people and that doesn't mean\nthat it didn't make Society or other\nwomen watching it feel that way so like\nyou know I just I hope that well said\nyeah there's definitely both they both\nsit with sit with me so yeah everyone\nwho's listening or watching I can\ndefinitely I I definitely hear what\nyou're saying and and I can see how much\nof a it's such a complicated complex\nlayered topic when it's personal but\nCollective and it's hard to kind of\nverbalize and talk about something\nbecause it is very complex so how do I\nput that into words but I I I do see\nboth and and they it's weird two things\ncan be true at the same time you know\nwhat I mean sometimes emotions are\nparallel and they're really just\nhappening one's happening here and one\nit's also happening and you're going on\nthe same path and you're going to the\nsame place and you're feeling two\ndifferent things at the exact same time\nso I I look back on it and I have new\nemotions that sit alongside the old ones\nand the joy and like the wow that I felt\nthere but then I can see how everything\nhappened and I can see the heaviness and\nI can understand like I see where Maybe\nby me talking so positively about it\nmakes other people feel a negative way\nlike I I would never want to make\nsomebody feel like that so I have to\nacknowledge that and be like okay I I\nknow I see now we like we've we were in\nlike we were the early 2000s we were in\nthis bubble of this thing and it popped\nand now we can see clearly and I see it\nso I get it but you know also if I'm\ngoing to talk about my personal\nexperience while I was in it it was I\ndid have a great time and I I personally\nwent about it and what I feel like was\nas healthy as I could possibly be like\ntrust me I was eating I was working out\nI was doing I was doing all the things\nlike I should be doing to make sure that\nI'm not you know being unhealthy and\nhaving a a negative thing that was\nhappening in my mind and my body so well\nI really appreciate that kind of the way\nyou've presented that because I think\nthere's so much truth to it and I think\nif anything it helps us become more\naware of hey let's try and be aware of\nbubbles but by the nature of a bubble\nyou're not aware of it until it pops and\nso when it pops then we all become aware\nof it and then all of a sudden so it's\nalmost like we've got to give we've got\nto give ourselves Grace we've got to\ngive others Grace we've got to give\neveryone time and space to kind of\nunderstand and grow and Rise together\nyeah because and and this doesn't just\napply to the beauty industry or the\nmodeling industry this applies to so\nmany Industries across the world where I\nthink there's a need for Collective\nGrace on both sides and then and then\nRising together and and I love and I\ncompletely agree with you I think you're\nallowed to have your own experience I I\nalmost think about it sometimes to do\nwith entrepreneurship too like a lot of\npeople will be like entrepreneurship is\nreally tough it's really hard work and\nthere's the hustle culture of you have\nto work 18 hours a day and you have to\ndo this and you have to do that and I\nalways say to people like if I'm\ncompletely honest for the first two\nyears of my career three years of my\ncareer I did work 18 hours a day and I'm\nreally happy I did like it was amazing\nand I'm really grateful and yes some\nparts of it were unhealthy but it it\nallowed me to get to where I wanted to\nget to in order to put things in place\nto be more healthy and that's my\npersonal experience of it and that's not\nright or wrong or the best way or the\nworst way it's just how it's worked for\nme uh and and you could look at that and\nbe like oh well 18 hours is a hustle\nculture and there's no balance and I'm\nlike but it's it's each of us have got\nto find what's comfortable and natural\nfor us and you're allowed to have your\nown experience and also recognize that\nthere's negatives within it yeah cuz you\nyou know you working those 18 hour days\nand when you realize well maybe I\nshouldn't be doing that or you have\nmaybe this realization of maybe I should\nhave more balance in my life maybe I\nshould do this\noh okay like then you can maybe fix it\nand grow from it and change and not do\nthat anymore but doesn't mean that when\nyou were doing it you were you know\nhaving a terrible time maybe you were\nhaving fun and you were just excited\nthat you get to do this work and all\nthat stuff and then you can look back on\nand be like w I was actually some more\noverwhelmed than I thought I was oh okay\nlike that's I that's what that was cuz\nsometimes you feel these things and some\nnew emotions that you've never felt\nbefore and you can't pinpoint what it is\nexactly until you hear somebody say it\nor there's a new topic of discussion\nwhere people are like do you guys ever\nfeel this and then you're like I do feel\nthat what is that and then you discover\noh it's burnout like oh see I there was\nnever a word for it before that's what\nthat is so it's just like acknowledging\nand and recognizing something and then\nbeing like okay well we're not going to\ndo that anymore but I did do it so you\nknow we're not going to do that yeah\nit's so true I mean I I think about that\nwhen I was young I used to have certain\num physical Sensations or experiences in\nmy in my heart space in my chest space\nand I would go to the doctors I would\ntell my mom and we'd go get checked out\nthe doctors had no clue they were like\nyou're absolutely fine yeah and now I\nlook back and I'm like oh I had anxiety\noh I had panic attacks I had no idea and\nno one in my no one ever used that\nlanguage I saw multiple doctors no one\never said it to me Y and so I just moved\non with life and got on with it and\nbecame better at dealing with it and now\nI look back and I'm like oh now there's\na word for it and now we can label it\nand talk about it but I didn't know then\nand there's been definitely times in my\nlife where I've been in denial that I've\nbeen in stress or burnout and then I\nlook back and I'm like oh now I can\nnotice it but at that time I just needed\nto push through or whatever it may be\nbut I mean talking about this and\ntalking about relate relevant emotional\nexperiences uh I was talking about my\nfriend earlier and you were talking to\nme about the experience you went through\nyou shared this on social media you\ntalked about the loss of Tate and the\ngrief you've experienced which is What's\nled to Tate and Taylor which is this\nincredible new platform and Company\nthat's supporting so many people walk I\nwant to talk about what you've built and\nthe passion and the purpose behind it\nbut let's talk about the grief of losing\na friend uh because that's really what\nthis is a really dear friend uh walk me\nthrough those nine years and and the\namazing relationship you built with Tate\nyeah Tate Oh My Angel um I got Tate when\nI was 18 so it was really kind of\nin the mix of all the My Life Changing\nyou know I I booked the Victoria Secret\nfashion show not very long after I I tap\ncame into my life and we went we walked\nthrough life together for 9 years and he\nwas my best friend\nand oh gosh it's so hard to put it into\nwords because it's\num it's so it's such a unique thing to\nhave a deep relationship with an animal\nand it sounds I hope I don't sound crazy\nI'm going to sound a little crazy but\nlike I just feel like the love that you\nknow dogs and animals in general have\nfor humans is\nso unconditional you know and they have\nno judgment they don't want anything\nfrom you but your love back and it's so\npure and it's so innocent it's almost\nchildlike in a way you know when I I I\ncan only imagine you know when you hold\na newborn baby for the first time that\nimmediate connection that you feel to\nthis thing that can't even talk yet and\nis just a part of you it's um it's\nreally special to have such a a deep\nconnection to something that literally\nwants nothing from you except for also\nthe like unconditional love so to have\ntap come into my life at that time was\nso special just because so much was\nchanging you know I was growing up I was\nyou know becoming a young woman from a\ngirl to a woman and he was there for\nthat and you know I was traveling all\nthe time and I was away from family and\nI just had this little tiny innocent\nsoul with me that just always looked at\nme like you're the best and I love you\nand Tate taught me so much I mean he\ntaught me you know responsibility caring\nfor something other than myself you know\ntaking care of him you know pouring love\ninto him and making sure that he was\ngood and you know even well behaved and\ntraining him and doing all those things\nis is showing him an act of love and\nmaking sure that he's a confident\ncomfortable dog he he could be in any\nscenario and he was the best boy and I\nthink he also kind of knew that I was\njust kind of out there winging it a bit\nand he was like oh God this girl this\ngirl has no idea what she's doing so I'm\ngoing to have to be a good boy now and\nhe just I really sometimes feel like he\ndid teach himself um how to just be\neverywhere with me all the time and I\nthink that he was meant for me and he\nwas meant to be in my life and I think\nthat we were sort of made to for each\nother and we belonged to each other um\nand you know he was he was\nso it sounds crazy to say this about a\ndog but he was so emotional like his\neyes were so human he could look at me\nand I knew what he was saying or what he\nwas thinking or I felt that could feel\nwhat I was thinking or what I was\nfeeling and I definitely think that he\nalso taught me a lot about you know\nemotion and you\nknow being you know what's that saying\nyou know be the person your dog thinks\nyou are they think you're great you know\nthey're like I love you no matter what\nyes Mom yes so that's the energy they\ngive you right is like you're the best\nand it's just like am I the best but to\nhousing you know this little creature\njust look at you and think you're the\nbest it kind of makes you want to be the\nbest right you know constantly trying to\ngrow and be better and change and you\nknow nobody's perfect and no one will\never be perfect and we're always\nlearning and we're always growing and um\nwe're always changing but having\nsomething to do that for and having some\nsomeone to do that with is is really is\nit's different you know like it's more\nintentional right so\ntrying to be better because Tate thinks\nI'm the best is it's a different\nmotivation so he definitely um was there\nfor me through you know so much of my\nlife and so much of my life changing I\nthink from you know 18 to 27 are pretty\nformative years I don't I'm not a doctor\nbut I someone told me once that your\nbrain stops developing a 25 or something\nso you know he was there oh sorry I hit\nthe mic I talk with my hands um he was\nthere he was there from when I had a\nundeveloped brain to a developed brain\nyou know he kind of just saw me through\nand he was he was just the best I mean\nthe love of my life I mean my soulmate\nreally\nbecause he just knew you know and I've\nnever had a connection with any anyone\nlike that that I've had with Tate so um\nI'm just I'm really grateful that he was\nin my life he's the inspiration behind\nme even wanting to start a pet company\njust\nbecause I love him so much and I know\nother people have felt that before\npeople who've had you know what I like\nto call a soul dog they know what I'm\ntalking about you know they know that\nfeeling and when I share that I lost\ntape people who who' you know been on my\njourney with me and been maybe following\nme for a bit know the day I got him and\nmaybe saw saw him on my Instagram all\nthe time I mean he was probably in every\nsingle picture on my Instagram for nine\nyears so I feel like people felt like\nthey knew him and when I said when I you\nknow shared that he was sick and then\nwhen I ultimately shared that he had\npassed the overwhelming amount of\nsupport and you know messages that I got\nand also shared experiences that I\nreceived from I lost my soul dog 10\nyears ago and I still think about them\nevery single day it made me feel it made\nme feel less alone and less maybe kind\nof strange for feeling this way about a\ndog because I you know you both you get\nI got amazing overwhelming comments that\nwere just overwhelmingly positive I mean\njust I you know I know what you've what\nyou're going through I went through this\nyou know just remember he's always with\nyou you know I got messages like that\nthat touched me so deeply and positively\nand I just felt so grateful that I got\nthose messages but then of course you\nget the flip side where people don't\nunderstand they're like oh it's a dog\nwhat's the big deal you know oh it's a\ndog move on oh never move on from Tate's\ndeath my grief will change for sure um\nmy perspective of his death will change\num and it and it has even since I lost\nhim you know\nI it's it's devastating and it's\nheartbreaking\nand you know to anyone who's felt that I\nknow that feels like and don't let\nanybody rush you you know some people\ndon't understand that it's just because\nthis is a dog and you know not a person\nit doesn't mean\nthat they don't deserve the same amount\nof time and space and energy you would\ngive to grieving anything else so I\nwould just say you know take your time\nand you're not alone and it's it's a not\na fun thing to go through at all\nso um I think I'll always mate you know\nI don't see how I can't you know and I\nthink to say to to get over something is\nsuch a harsh way of saying it because\nI'll probably never get over it I'll\nnever really get over losing\nTate I can heal from it and I can find\nyou know peace with it but those are two\ncompletely different things getting over\nit you can't how do you get over that\nyou know it does it's not something that\nit's not a object in my way it's he's a\npart of me and he's no longer here\nso yeah I definitely think um losing a\npet is is tough and you know losing one\nthat you have such a deep strong\nconnection with that's been with you for\nso many things with no expectation from\nyou other than just they want to be\nthere with you is that's a tough loss\nand a tough thing to to um work through\nso thank you for sharing that I mean I\nlike I was saying to you I've had two\nfriends recently who've both lost pets\nthat they were dogs that they were close\nto for many many years and I've been\ntalking to them and when this\nopportunity came up to talk to you I was\nthinking about you and then thinking\nabout them and I can't wait to share\nthis conversation with them because it's\nI I don't think there's anyone who has a\npet that they're deeply close to that\nsees it as a loss that's different of\nany kind and and why would you when that\nperson has been there with you through\nall these experiences walk through like\nwhat is it like when you get that call\nor you have that meeting with the vet or\nthe doctor that goes this is the\ncondition that Tate hasn't please tell\nus a bit about the condition and that\nexperience because I feel like to me\nwhen I think about grief and loss it's\nlike that point in the journey is so\npivotal to everything that comes after\nit because it's like the first time it\nreally hits you that this may not last\nyeah and also it can dictate your your\njourney and how you grieve and why\nyou're grieving so Tate was diagnosed\nwith te- cell lymphoma and you know he\nwas acting strangely\nprobably less than a month before his\ndiagnosis it was little things very\nsubtle things and almost things that\nwere already kind of things that he had\nbeen doing before but they were just a\nlittle bit more frequent or a little bit\nmore extreme and I was like that's\nreally weird so Tate had a very\nsensitive stomach he would always\nsometimes\nI don't want to say the word throw up\nbut sorry guys if you're triggered by\nthat um he would throw up his food\nsometimes and he like it didn't always\nlike sit well with him and he he had\nlike you know already had like digest\ndigestion problems from when he was a\npuppy but probably a couple weeks before\nhis cancer diagnosis he was still\nthrowing up food he was like drinking\nwater excessively like drinking a lot of\nwater like he seemed very very thirsty\nand then when I ultimately was like okay\nsomething is really really wrong um it\nwas incontinence so he was peeing in the\nbed at night which was he never did that\nhe was such a good boy I was like he\nwould never do this intentionally so um\nI took him to the doctor and I was like\nsomething is wrong he's you know it's\nnot strange or abnormal that he's\nthrowing up his food but it's strange\nthat he threw up water yesterday and\nit's strange that he peed in the bed and\nI don't think that those are normal\nthings so you know they're doing blood\ntests his calcium levels are off I don't\nremember in what way just because\nhonestly it's all a bit of a blur\nbecause it's it was a very emotional\ntime so but I do remember his calcium\nlevels there was something wrong there\nso they did another test that was a bit\nmore of a deep dive into that they were\nlike okay yeah this is a problem we\nshould probably do an exray so you know\nthat was a week ago so now it's a week\nlater and you know getting these\nappointments and like seeing the doctors\nyou know it's just sometimes not always\neasy even in dogs even you know in in\nveterinar um circumstances it's weirdly\nsometimes similar to human doctors you\nknow it's just getting these\nappointments and getting into SE it's\nlike well something is wrong can we just\ndo this now like why are we sitting here\nand waiting um he doesn't feel good so\nwe go in for the X-ray and um you know\nsure enough they they find a mass in his\nshoulder in his lymph node near his\nshoulder and they're like okay well we\nthink it's lymphoma so you know you need\nto take him to an\noncologist and you know these are the\noncologists that we recommend I'm\ncalling every Hospital in New York that\nI possibly can to see you know who can I\ntake him to right away everyone was you\nknow this was maybe May everyone was\nlike our next appointment isn't until\nJune 16th our next appointment isn't\nuntil July 16th I'm like okay well my\ndog was just diagnosed with cancer or\nwhat they think to be is cancer I can't\ncan't imagine that he can wait until\nJune or July um and I don't really know\nwhat to do next so he starts getting\nworse and he's not eating anymore and he\nhas no appetite and he can't keep even\nwater down so my husband actually takes\nhim to the vet um I'm out of town this\nwhen this is happening and she says he's\nin a really bad State he's severely\ndehydrated you need to take him to the\nemergency room right now and and they'll\ncheck him into the ICU and then maybe\nthen he'll be seen by an oncologist and\nI was like why didn't you tell me that\nbefore Oh my God I would have done that\na week ago even though he wasn't in a\nstate of emergency he has we we think he\nhas cancer we think he has t- cell te-\ncell lymphoma that's very aggressive so\nwe um we my husband takes him to the\nemergency room and sure enough they do\nthey check him into the ICU he's you\nknow very severely dehydrated he's very\nweak he hasn't eaten in like 2 days and\nhe's on a weight list to see an\noncologist that day\nand wow remembering all this is hard cuz\nI wasn't in town when this was happening\nand I get these calls that Tate's in the\nemergency room Tate's in the ICU I'm not\nthere I'm petrified I'm going to lose\nhim I'm not going to be\nthere\nand he's seen by the oncologist they do\nall the tests they do all the scans yes\nhe does have t- cell\nlymphoma it's throughout his entire body\nhe has multiple you know masses on\nmultiple lymph nodes\nand he he definitely doesn't have much\nmuch more time\nleft so I get home as soon as I can I'm\nin the ICU with him and you know all\nthis is happening days before our\nwedding actually um I was in the\nhospital with him on a Monday and on\nThursday I was meant to fly back home to\nColorado to get married and I'm in New\nYork in the hospital in the ICU with\nTate and you know I'm looking at him and\nI'm asking him like if you if you need\nto go like please let me know like I\nwill let you go you know like I don't\nwant to make him do anything that he\ndoesn't want to do because sometimes I\nfeel like when you're dealing with a\nsick animal we can be quite selfish and\nI want him to be there and I want him to\nbe okay and I want him to be at my\nwedding and all these things that I want\nbut what about him him he doesn't feel\ngood he's sick he's in the\nhospital so Tate was at the Animal\nMedical Center in New York the shorman\nAnimal Medical Center and a lot of what\nwe do at Tate and Taylor is I have a\nwhole cancer like a [ __ ] cancer merch\ncollection line where 100% of the profit\nthat we make goes back back to um a a\nfund that they have at the Animal\nMedical Center called the Buddy fund and\nwhat the Buddy fund does is help\nsubsidize the cost or cover the cost and\ntotal of chemotherapy and Cancer\nTreatments and pets amazing it's an\nincredible program and it's an\nincredible hospital and a part of my\njourney and story with Tate so much of\nit has to do with the amazing the\noncology department at the Animal\nMedical Center is amazing they're the\nlargest nonprofit Hospital in the world\nand they they're they have so many\namazing programs there they're teaching\nhospital so it's a really it's a great\nplace Tate was in the best hands when he\nwas there and while even though I was\ngoing through something quite emotional\nand a turbulent time of is he going to\nmake it to one of the spe most special\ndays of my life and or is he not I I had\nan amazing doctor there she was so\nsupportive she was about to get married\nshe was you know getting married a week\nafter me so she was I I have a dog and\nshe was like I can't she's like I can't\nimagine what you're feeling right now I\nmean she's she's like I can't imagine\nwhat you're feeling right now you know\ngetting married your dog in the hospital\nthis is your baby and you know you're he\nmight not be there so the the team that\nthe oncology team was so amazing with\nTate and with me they did everything in\ntheir power they're like well we think\nwe should start you know the chop\nprotocol which is what he started and um\num he started responding to it really\npositively so I I'm you know those a\nsmall segue cut back to you know I'm\nlooking at Tate I'm like please tell me\nlike do you want to fight this like are\nyou going to stick it out I you don't\nhave to do the you don't have to come I\nknow I want you to but I need to do\nwhat's best for you and after I you know\nsaid this to him he it's you know he's\ngoing in to have a feeding tube put in\nbecause he's not eating and he's about\nto start the chop protocol they want to\nmake sure he has nutrients in his body\nso they put a feeding tube in so that\nthey can start giving administering you\nknow nutrients to him and immediately\nflipped he went from looking like he was\non death's doorstep to Tate he was\nwagging his tail he was energetic he was\nyou know you doing it he was him I was\nlike it was the next day and this is\nWednesday I'm supposed to leave Thursday\nfor the\nwedding I was my mind was blown I was\nlike oh my God I can't believe it I was\nlike T are you lying to me right now\nwhat are you doing what is this all of a\nsudden he knew he knew he wanted to be\nthere I asked him I was like do you what\ndo you need what do you want they they\nyou know put the feeding T they're\nadministering the his first dose of the\nchop protocol and you know he's able to\nput get some nutrients in his body he's\na different dog I'm like okay this dog\nwants to fight this for me he wants to\npull through right now so he does make\nit to the wedding it was an amazing\nbeautiful experience be able to share\nthat with him because literally every\nperson who he's ever loved and who has\never loved Tate was there and they got\nto they got to say goodbye to him you\nknow as not to sound morbid but it is it\nwas a it's in a way sort of cancer and\ndogs is it's not curable they don't live\nmuch longer than maybe a year you know\nsometimes in some cases to like it's\ndifferent you know you they treat dogs\nto live the best quality of life if they\ncan for the rest of their lives until\nthey get to a point where it's okay well\nit's it's their time so it was a way for\npeople to say goodbye to him because we\nknew he wouldn't be around for much\nlonger we didn't know how much longer\nbut it wasn't going to be much longer um\nand it was really special you know my my\nbest friend from my childhood someone\nI've known since I was 5 years old he\nwas was um um what did I call him oh my\nman of honor and uh he walked him down\nthe aisle and it was really special and\nyou know people were crying and everyone\nwas hugging Tate and kissing Tate and\njust it was so special for me to be able\nto see and feel the love for him knowing\nwhat he had gone through and what we\nwere going through and it felt like it\ntruly felt like a miracle that he made\nit there and that he was there that day\num so then you know we get back to New\nYork and he's you know he's on maybe\nnumber two or three of his\ndoses um it's a 16 we process and we\nwere probably only on like week two and\nso because he had te- cell lymphoma it's\na it's very aggressive and it adapts in\nthe body really quickly and you know\nsince Tate had tumors throughout his\nentire body um we didn't know how he was\nwould respond to it he he was 9 years\nold so he was older but he wasn't old\nold I guess so the doctors were like\nwell we're not really sure he's nine\nit's old but he's still energetic he's\nstill quite youthful like we're going to\nkind of play it by ear and see how this\ngoes um and then it was we were um we\nwere in New York for maybe about a week\n10 days or so and he started to get\nreally really bad again really bad we\ntake him back to the emergency room um\nthey you know he's back in the ICU and\nthey're doing all the blood work and the\ntests and you know checking on him and\nhe\num the cancer in his body had adapted to\nthe to the chemotherapy treatments and\nit was attacking his kidneys now and um\nessentially you know his doctor\nsaid if he doesn't pass from the cancer\nhe'll pass from kidney failure failure\nso right now we're in a position where\nthere's not much more we can do and he's\nnot comfortable he's in a lot of pain\nhe's very sick um he she said it's\ncompletely up to you and I can't tell\nyou what to do all I can tell you is\nwhere he's at what the health the the\ncondition of his health right now is not\ngood so you know we ultimately have to\ncome to the to the decision to let take\ngo because I don't want him to live like\nthat that's so selfish you know I think\nto try to keep treating him when\nhe's yeah he's\nnot he shouldn't he shouldn't be you\nknow so um we were able to um make an\nappointment with a doctor that that does\nhumane euthanization in home so that\nTate could be with me my husband and we\nwere in our home together and we got to\nhold him and you know he didn't have to\ngo back to the hospital because going\nthere was it was a scary thing for M\ncould tell it was stressful because\nthat's where they would take him away\nfrom me and I knew he wanted to be with\nme he was very attached to me so I\ndidn't want to have to take him back\nthere I didn't want him to have to pass\nin that\nenvironment not to speak neg it wasn't a\nnegative space at all it was actually\nvery happy it was a very beautiful space\nthe doctors were amazing there and it\nwas it was both it was tough because it\nwas what we were going through was so so\ndifficult but they were so they were so\namazing they they were so positive their\nenergy was so great so it wasn't that it\nwas a dark scary place it was just I\nwanted him to feel as comfortable as\npossible and I know that by him walking\nin there he was like he would be like oh\nno like I'm in this place again they're\ngoing to take me away from you mom so I\ndidn't want to bring him back there and\nhave to you know his last moments be in\na place where he didn't know what was\ngoing to happen to him so we did it at\nhome and um it was was really special\nthat I um got to hold him and you know\ncomfort him and be with him that was the\nmost important thing to me I was I\nabsolutely have to be there like I have\nto be there and I think he knew that and\nI think he wanted me to be there and he\nwaited so that we could do we could do\nit together and we could be\ntogether and it's\nit's a tough thing you\nknow like having to you know witness\nsomeone die is not fun\num especially him you know for me was he\nwas he was everything to\nme and\num just based off of that experience\nthat I have with him I know so many\npeople probably have felt that way have\nbeen in a similar situation and\nI know it's it's really\nhard going through that\nso\nI'm grateful for the way that everything\nhappened with me with Tate um it's so\ncrazy they know like they know\nthey're these Spiritual Beings I think\nanimals they're more spiritual than us\nthey have so much more they have\ndifferent types of Consciousness I think\nthan people do\nhe knew what I needed and he knew what\nhow I needed him to go and he he like he\nreally did that for\nme\nand it was really even though it was\nreally tough it was really also\nbeautiful at the same time to be able to\nhold him in his last moments and he was\nthere for me for every single moment and\nI got to be there for him in this moment\nI he didn't feel fear he didn't feel\npain he was I held him in my arms and I\nwas you know we were just I got to hold\nhim so he was very I know he was\ncomfortable and I I felt that with him\nand I that's why I wanted to be there so\nI just could make sure that he felt\nnothing but comfort and no pain and just\nhappiness and love like you could feel\nmy love\nso um that's sort of the you know the\nstory of Tate and his his illness and\nhis cancer and what you know sort of of\nwhat we went through um and you\nknow treating cancer is so expensive\neven with insurance and you know part of\nwhy the um the Buddy fund is something\nthat we're so passionate about and why I\nfeel like I want Tate and Taylor as a\nbrand to be really um cause-driven and\nhave an initiative and have a purpose\nand have a reason behind it is because\nof you know what I went through with\nTate I started building Tate and Taylor\nwith him not KN that any of this would\nhappen and then before we even got to\nlaunch and start the company publicly I\nlost him and it shifted sort of a lot of\nthe drive and some of the purpose that\nwe have um\nand being having to decide\nbetween\nbeing having a financial burden and\nbeing in a place where you may or may\nnot be able to financially care for your\npet and those last Precious Moments the\nones that even I know I got to have with\nTate those last few weeks with him were\nthe the best weeks ever in my memory of\nmy life with him because he got to come\nto my wedding he was back to himself for\na little bit these like special little\nthings and times that we Shar together\nthey were so important in how I was able\nto heal going forward once I did lose\nhim so I think being able to help\nsupport people who are going through\nthis with their pets and go through\ncancer and you know that that journey\nand that path and and what that looks\nlike is something I really I have such a\num a passion for and something I really\nwant to be able to help because I went\nthrough all of this with him and I know\nwhat that feels like and I know what\nthat pain is and what how what that\nweight feels like and what the grief\nfeels\nlike how can I be there for other people\nand how can I help other people who are\ngoing through this so they they never\nhave to think about that um and that's\nwhy we picked the Buddy fun just because\nof the experience that I have with Tate\nat AMC and so many people I know so many\npeople who've who've had that experience\nand you know I um spoke with Tate's\noncologist Dr Rachel lordal and um you\nknow we posted it on the Tate and Taylor\nInstagram and I got a couple of comments\nthat were like I love Dr Rachel she was\nthere for me with with my um with my dog\nand you know she's amazing and so people\nfeel people feel it from them from that\nplace and that fund is so imp act F\nbecause when you're going through\nsomething like that to have to worry\nabout whether or not you can afford care\nand whether or not you can even get\nthose extra that extra time and just see\nhow they're even going to respond to\ntreatment I mean I can't even I don't\neven want to we nobody wants to have to\ngo there and make that decision so I got\nso much support when I lost hate and I\njust want to do everything I can to\nsupport others because I know other\npeople go through this and there are\npeople in that position and it breaks my\nheart to even think that somebody would\nhave to go\nthrough yeah I just I\ncan't it's hard to um to verbalize that\npain and I cuz I I can I can so clearly\nvisualize what that feeling could be and\nhaving to make that decision and um I\ngot to make it when I did with tape and\nI'm I'm I'm so grateful that I I I was\nable to do that and I just want to be\nable to to share to like give that back\ngive that time give it to others like\nhow can I help give people more time\nwith their soulmates I guess Taylor\nthank you so much for opening up so\nintimately about that journey and I\nremember seeing the beautiful\nand amazing pictures and memories you\nshared with Tate on social media\nand but to hear the the actual Journey\nbehind it just thank you so much for\nbeing so open and and giving and I'm\nvery confident\nthat I mean I I haven't lost a pet or a\ndog and I don't know what that feels\nlike but even just sitting here\nlistening to you I know that anyone who\nhas or anyone who may do so in the\nfuture will have this to turn to as a\nway of connecting with and to humanize\ntheir experience and also validate their\nexperience of How Deeply they love yeah\nthis friend in their life and I wanted\nto ask you what would you two questions\nwhat would\nyou for anyone who is grieving the loss\nof a pet friend a dog like what would\nyou want them to know about the grieving\nprocess and the second question is if\nsomeone has a friend or family member\nthat's going through it what would you\nlike them to know in order to offer help\nor support to that person I would say if\nyou're going through if you're going\nthrough this loss and you're you know\ncoping with this type of\ngrief I think patience just be patient\nwith yourself feel it you know grief is\nlike an ocean sometimes it's Relentless\nsometimes it's calm sometimes the waves\nare huge and crashing sometimes it's\ncompletely still and beautiful and\npeaceful and you know you're you're able\nto just float so wherever you're at\nwhere whatever your ocean is doing just\nfeel it because\none moment it'll feel really calm and\nyou'll feel a sense of perspective maybe\na sense of peace and then there'll be a\nmemory or you'll be in a situation where\nit brings something back up and then the\nwaves come crashing in and you know\nthat's okay sometimes you know I'm I'm\nalmost a year uh to to the day that I\nlost hate and I'm not fully healed yet\nand I think that's going to take maybe a\ncouple more years to even feel like I\ncan say I'm Healed from that um I don't\nthink I can ever I don't think anyone\never necessarily moves on and I think if\nthey hear the words move on don't take\nthat let let that roll right off you\nbecause there that's not what maybe they\nmean to move on you may you may never\nmove on but to heal is different you\nknow to heal a wound that so it no\nlonger opens is a different thing and I\nwould say to make sure that you're doing\nthe steps and taking care of yourself in\nthe way you need to to heal cuz it is a\nwound you know how would you go about if\nyou broke your arm you know you would go\nto the doctor you would you know set it\nin a cast you would do all these steps\nto make sure your arm could work again\nso I think that losing someone is sort\nof it's It's a wound it's in it's an\ninternal wound it's some it's a part\nit's it breaks something in our spirit\nso it's not something you can see but\nit's something that needs addressing\nit's something that needs help it needs\ntime you know however you need to do\nthat and whatever your process looks\nlike to deal with\nhealing just and if you don't know how\nto do that I think talking to someone I\nthink anyone it doesn't even have to be\na therapist you know because I know a\nlot of people like to say go to therapy\nwell some people don't have access to\ntherapy yet and that's okay but talking\nabout it you know if there's someone you\ncan relate to if you can find anyone in\nyour life who will listen and help help\nyou grieve and you know talk it talk\nthrough it with you writing about it\ntalking to yourself about it if you if\nyou prefer writing or journaling or I\nthink there's a couple of different ways\nto get started in terms of well I don't\neven know how to heal what does that\nmean Taylor where do I start what's the\nprocess look like it's different for\neveryone but I think um you know\nknowledge is power and learning and if\nyou don't know where to start you can\ntalk to someone and maybe ask a couple\nof questions or ask yourself questions\nor write things out and start really\nsmall and start there and then hopefully\nyou know you can start growing on that\nand and expanding on okay well I this is\nwhat it means to heal this is this is my\nprocess this is how I'm going to do this\nand you know find the tools that work\nfor you and or create the tools that\nwork for you who who knows it's\ndifferent for everybody it's different\nfor everybody so however that looks like\nto you whatever that feels like to you\nas long as you're you're doing what you\nneed to do to ultimately heal from it I\nthink that's a really a really great\nplace to start is just to start thinking\nabout it from there don't worry about\nmoving on or getting over it or if the\nemotions are stronger sometimes than\nothers they can be really unexpected you\nknow it can it hits you like a wave some\ndays and and that's okay feel it sit\nthere write about it think about it I\nmean if you want to ignore it for a\nlittle bit you can but you know make\nsure you're always coming back to it and\nacknowledging it and addressing in it\nand then you can sort of like Let It Go\nand be like okay I see you I hear you I\nfeel you we're going to acknowledge that\nemotion and then we can let it go and\nthen I think that's like those are\nreally good ways to kind of\nstart healing thank you for sharing that\nyeah and I loved what you were saying\nabout people discovering their own tools\ndiscovering their own way not feeling\nlike there has to be a set formula and\nand even listening to this conversation\nand I do think\nI've been encouraging a lot of my\nfriends to reach out to other people\nwho've gone through similar experiences\nbecause not that your healing will look\nthe same but that it\nfeels necessary to sit with other people\nwho you feel see you hear you understand\nyou and my friend told me something\nbeautiful about grief that I don't think\nI'll ever forget they said to me that\ngrief is like a stone and you carry it\nin your pocket and you'll always notice\nit you'll feel it you know it's there\nbut as time goes on you get stronger and\nso as you get stronger it's not that the\nstone goes away it's just that it gets\nlighter wow and so it's lighter to carry\nbut it doesn't mean it's going away you\ndidn't move on you didn't have to get\nover it it doesn't disappear it doesn't\nget smaller it stays the same you just\ngets stronger so the stone gets lighter\nyeah and I and I really appreciated that\nidea\naround grief because it sat true with me\nthat it didn't have to go away I didn't\nhave to let go of it I didn't have to\nforget about it and that it would always\nbe there but just as I grow and as I\nstrengthen and as I become more\nresilient it becomes lighter and doesn't\nweigh on me in the same way as the heavy\nfeeling of grief can in the beginning\nyeah and so yeah thank you I mean it\nsounds like you know you shared with me\nbefore that there was something you\nwanted to share with our community here\nthat you hadn't shared before\nMH\nand when you mentioned it to me there's\nsomething beautiful you said and it was\nthis idea of how Tate has actually been\nwith you\nthrough another loss in your life\nand that's a journey that you haven't\nshared before could you walk us through\nhow Tate was your best friend through\nthat Journey too so about 3 years ago um\nI had a\nmiscarriage\nand I've I've never spoken about it\nbefore um except for obviously\nto people in my life and you know my\nfamily knows and my close friends know\nand I I've shared it with you know some\npeople and I do think you know talking\nabout it is an important thing but you\nknow I've never publicly spoken about it\nor said that I went through that um and\nyou know I kind of made the decision\nthat I since I'm you know talking about\nTate and I'm you know starting this\nbusiness based off of the love that we\nhave for each other and how I want to be\nthere for people he was there for me in\nso many ways and how can I you know\nshare that without sharing something I\nwent through that he was there for me\nfor and in grieving his loss I'm\ngrieving the shared experiences we've\nhad and learning how to cope some cope\nwith something without him when he was\nthere for me through that time in my\nlife um I had a it was a really strange\ncircumstance under which I um had my\nmiscarriage I um had an IUD I had it for\nabout 3 years so I obviously you know\nwasn't actively trying to get pregnant I\ndidn't want to get pregnant at all I was\nyou know engaged to my husband and you\nknow we were not planning on starting a\nfamily probably for you know for a while\nso I wasn't in the headp space at all to\nto be pregnant um and you know I'm not\nreally sure how it happens because I I\ndon't I I don't know how that works I'm\nnot a doctor and I I didn't understand\nit and sometimes I still don't\nunderstand it um because you know I'm\npretty sure I could be wrong on this I\nprobably should have looked it up before\nI came in here so I could say exactly\nbut um it's a really small percentage\nlike a small chance of getting pregnant\non an IUD it's like less than 1% or\nsomething like that which is still you\nknow still a chance like it can still\nhappen of course but you some crazy\nthings happen to someone and there it's\nlike that'll never happen to me it\nhappened to me I got pregnant on an IUD\nand I I was shocked and I was sad I\ndidn't want to be pregnant I wasn't\nready to be pregnant I didn't understand\nwhat it meant to be pregnant with an IUD\nI didn't know what that meant I didn't\nknow what my journey with this pregnancy\nwould look like I was so scared I was\nterrified um and also it was um still\nduring covid so my husband was in he\nwasn't able to be with me he was in\nLondon and um he was in you know kind of\nnot allowed to travel into the us so I I\nfound he was with me in the beginning of\num Co and the pandemic but because he's\nBritish you know he was on anesta and\nthey were getting people out on tourist\nvisas so his exception to fly out was so\nhe didn't overstay his esta cuz that's\nthe last thing we wanted we were you\nknow planning on getting married like we\ncan't get marks on you know all that\nstuff so um he left the country because\nhe had to and so then we were separated\nand we were no longer able to be\ntogether I I don't think I saw him for\nmaybe another couple months after that\nso um he he wasn't with me when I found\nout I was pregnant and um that was\nreally hard for both of us because all\nyou want to do when you're going through\nsomething like that as shocking and\nunexpected as it was for the both of us\nis to be there with each other you know\nI know he wanted more than anything in\nthe world to hold my hand like tell me\nit's going to be okay like hold me and\nyou know that's all I wanted too and I\ncouldn't be with him and um Tate was\nwith me though you know he was we were\ntogether and I'm so grateful that I I\nhad him physically to be there with me\nphysically you know my husband was there\nfor me in every way that he possibly\ncould be but I\nhad the physical connection that that\nholding that com you know that's\nsomething that you need in that space I\nit was breaking both of our hearts that\nwe didn't have that you know couldn't do\nthat and I think it both gave us like\ncomfort knowing that I had Tate with me\nfor that um you know I had to go to my\ndoctor's appointments alone I you know\nwent in to make sure that I didn't have\nan what's called an ectopic pregnancy\nwhich is when um it the embryo attaches\nitself in the fallopian tube my\npregnancy was in my uterus so it was\nviable it was technically healthy but\nthe circumstances in the environment on\nwhich I got which I conceived was a bit\nof a turbulent environment so you know\nmy doctor said we don't really know\nwhat's going to happen here because you\nknow you conceived in an environment\nwhere your body is telling you you\nshouldn't be pregnant because of the IUD\nbecause of the hormones the IUD is\nputting into your body um and also if we\nremove it then you know we're changing\nagain the environment on which you\nconceived so you know\nit's we don't know 50/50 of whether or\nnot you're going to you know carry this\nout so um it was really just a waiting\ngame to see if it would stick or not and\nI was given a couple of markers of you\nknow come back at about 6 and 1 half\nweeks and we can do internal ultrasound\nand you know check everything out and\nsee how it's going so you know I'm I'm\nwaiting another week or so I go back in\nthey do the internal ultrasound they're\nable to like hear a heartbeat um and you\nknow at this point I'm like oh my gosh\nlike I what is happening to me this is\nso crazy I'm going through all these\nthings I I have a photo I have the\npicture you know of the ultrasound like\nthat's so great it was like this big you\nknow what I mean and um so I'm at a\nplace in my life where okay maybe I\nwasn't planning to get pregnant and I\nwasn't I wasn't ultimately excited about\nit at first I was scared not excited I\nwas shocked I was confused I I I was\nfeeling fear I wasn't feeling Joy but at\nthe same time I'm going to marry this\nperson I'm in love with this person I\nwant to have a family with this person\nI'm\n20 was I 25 or was I 24 I think I was 25\nI'm 25 that's still young but you know\nit's I feel somewhat ready if I was to\nhave a child okay so I'm going to start\ngetting in the head space now of I think\nI'm going to if this pregnancy sticks\naround like I'm going to have a child\nokay oh gosh so it's like I'm coming to\nso many different so many terms of\nacceptance here where I'm just like okay\nbut I can't get too excited because we\ndon't know what's going to happen I have\nto pass all of these Milestones to make\nsure if this is going to be a healthy\npregnancy or not\num so I get to about roughly 9 weeks and\nyou know she's like okay well we're\ngetting closer you know she's optimistic\nthat this could be happening you know\nusually it's about 12 to 14 weeks when\nyou start telling people um so I'm like\noh my God it's getting closer like maybe\nthis is going to happen um and I'm\nstarting to accept that this is going to\nhappen um it's still really early though\nso of course not too excited I'm not at\nthat that check mark yet and then um I\nstart spotting but it was it was like um\nit wasn't bright red it wasn't blood yet\nand so then the doctor was like well\nthat's normal sometimes that happens you\nknow there is spotting with pregnancy\nit's just your body adjusting so oh\nwe'll just keep an eye on it um and\nabout a week goes by and and then I\nstart seeing what looks like fresh blood\num and that's this you know that's what\nshe told me to look out for and that's\nlike kind of the early signs and um of\nwhat ultimately will be a miscarriage so\nthat starts happening and you know I'm\nI'm alone in my house and you know at\nleast I have Tate with me and I call my\nhusband and you know I'm just devastated\nbecause I know that this is about to\nhappen to me and we're both crying and\nhe's I could just tell he was\nso\nheartbroken um that he couldn't be there\nI think that was really painful for him\ntoo you know for both of\nus and I've never spoken about it either\nso like to this extent so I um I have\nwith my family so this is also new for\nme to to do this it's like reprocessing\nagain\num I'm going\nthrough the physical reaction of having\nthe miscarriage um and it it takes some\ntime like you know it's happening while\nit's happening it doesn't just like\nhappen and then it's done like it it's\nit takes a long time it's it can be\npainful it feels like a period cramps\nbut like your worst period cramps you've\never had um and you know ultimately it\npasses and I have to make all these\ndoctor doctor's appointments I um I have\nto you know make sure everything's okay\nmake sure I'm healthy and all that so\nyou know right after dealing with with\nthis loss you have to click into this\nmode of I have to do all these things\nand I have to make sure I do this and I\ndo that and Logistics of getting to the\ndoctor and like making sure and checking\nand making sure it was clean and\neverything that needed to pass past um\nso you know I kind of went into take\ncare of it mode um and\nI just remember feeling so confused\nbecause it was really just like a a\nroller coaster of emotion\nof I didn't I didn't even know I I\ndidn't even want this I I wasn't\nexpecting this I I wasn't planning on\nhaving a child I was doing to the best\nof my ability you know the IUD is one of\nthe best forms of birth control one of\nthe most efficient forms of birth\ncontrol and and you\nknow\nI I was very confused I was like why is\nthis happening um this is so wild I\ncan't believe I can't believe this um I\nI\ndidn't I didn't want to necessarily be\npregnant um and then okay I I make pass\na couple of checkpoints and I'm starting\nto feel a little like oh gosh this is\ngoing to happen I'm starting to process\nemotions of coming to terms with this\nlike you do get excited I wasn't\nallowing myself to get fully excited or\nlike be too optimistic about it I tried\nto stay as neutral as I possibly could\nbut it's it's difficult you know you\ncan't you can't control some of these\nthings I mean the this is what I'm\nfeeling so you know I I was like okay\nwell oh my gosh like is this happening\nlike whoa so then there's a little bit\nof excitement and then you know some Joy\nbecause like I want a family I'm excited\nto have children um and and then I lose\nthe pregnancy\nyou know it was early still like when I\nlost it so um I wasn't luckily fully in\nthe head space of oh my God this is 100%\nhappening so in terms of the timeline I\nam really grateful that I hadn't fully\ncome to terms with it yet but I was\nstill really confused because I was like\nwhoa processing this emotion of feeling\nlike I don't even want this to maybe\nthis is happening and feeling some\nexcitement and maybe some joy and then\nand then loss it was so strange and it\nwas just all the things you know it was\nreally just two things can be true at\nonce kind of a thing where you feel\nthese emotions that are one\nis\nhonestly even with some time and some\nspace now and some perspective\nrelief wow the timing wasn't right you\nknow everything happens for a reason I\nwasn't ready to be a mother I wasn't\nready to have a child I'm absolutely\ndevastated I'm not a mother and I don't\nhave a child well that makes no sense\nhow can you feel both of those things I\ndon't know they both sit one sits on\nthis side of my brain and one sits on\nthis side of the brain and they fight\nwith each other and I don't and it took\nme a really long time to\nunderstand how to deal with that I don't\nknow how to talk about this how do I\nmake this make sense and I think in\nterms of you know\nmiscarriages sometimes they don't make\nsense none of it doesn't make any sense\nand I think a lot of women go through\nthat I think it's something like one in\nthree women experience miscarriage so\nand and some women multiple and some\nwomen who've never had one like myself\nyou know when I first got pregnant it's\nlike this you have this sort of we don't\nyou don't know that that's a possibility\nright so it's it's like oh it can be\nreally exciting and I think a lot of\nwomen when they get pregnant for the\nfirst time feel excited and optimistic\nand hopeful and oh my God I'm going to\nhave a child right away so the blow of a\nmiscarriage is so\ndevastating wait a minute what I didn't\nwhat what\nhappened I thought I was having a child\nall everyone has a baby how do people\nhave babies like this is crazy how is\nthis happening um to to be pregnant is\nsuch a complicated thing it's so wild\nthe fact that we can even get pregnant\nyou know um and and I\nthink it it really helped me feel less\nalone knowing that it was something that\nwas quite common um and that a lot of\nwomen do go through it um and it just\nit but then you know something that I I\nfelt that was difficult to hear in the\nvery beginning that being said um when I\ndid very first lose my pregnancy I was\nlike well you know don't worry this\nhappens to a lot of people you're not\nalone it was like you I didn't want to\nhear that I didn't want to hear this\nhappens all the time like you know I was\nso upset I was like what do you mean so\nso I shouldn't feel upset that this\nhappened to me because it happens to a\nlot of people so\nI I'm trying sorry I'm trying to\narticulate and it's a very difficult\nthing to articulate specifically because\nI think it is very intricate and it's it\ncan be very difficult and complicated to\nspeak about something like that um\nso because there's so many powerful\nreally you know strong emotions that are\nhappening in your physical body and in\nyour emotional self as well so I was\nalways torn with they're trying to help\nme by saying this but it didn't help me\nto hear that so if I'm saying that now 3\nyears later I do have perspective and it\nand it did eventually become helpful to\nhear I'm not alone one in three women\nhave have miscarriages this happens to\npeople it's going to be okay if\nsomeone's listening and they're not\nready to hear\nthat I feel that I've been there like no\nthis sucks it sucks that one in three\nwomen go through it it sucks that it's\nsomething that we have to deal with\nsometimes you need to hear that you know\nso I've I've been in a place and I've\nbeen in positions where I needed to feel\nboth like I'm mad I'm confused why is\nthis happening to me why is my body\ndoing this I felt a sense of failure i s\nfelt a sense of betrayal of my own body\nof my own self I felt like and I wanted\nto feel those things I didn't want to\nhear oh what happens to one in three\nwomen I'm\nlike I'm mad at myself like it's okay\nit's okay to be mad at yourself you\ndon't have to get over it right away and\naccept that it happens to one in three\nwomen\nso wherever you're at and you know your\njourney of of dealing with these\nemotions and processing you know\nI i' I felt those things I've been angry\nI felt confused I felt relief I felt\npain and none of it made any sense I was\nlike what how do I how do I deal with\nthis um and again you know it's it it\ngoes back to sort of something similar\nand when I lost Tate I just sort of\nstarted talking to people I spoke to one\nof my best friends in the whole world\nand I with the day it happened I just\nsobbed to her and she held me you\nknow and you know she experienced this\nloss as well not shortly after me\nand I think that when I knew she was\ngoing through what I had been through\nand she held me and I held her and we\nwere talking about it with each other I\nthink that's when I got to a place when\nI was starting ready to\nhear this happens to one in three women\nand then I wanted to learn about it more\nand understand the technical reasons why\nthis happens and you know it's not my\nfault my body didn't fail me you know it\nwasn't a viable pregnancy it wasn't\nhealthy it wasn't meant to happen I\ndon't I'll never really know why it\nhappened um it could be a multitude of\nthings I I got pregnant on an IUD you\nknow that's probably number one reason\nwhy I didn't come through come to\nfruition so you know I I did have some\nthings to ground me in my grief of okay\nwell this happened because of this\nreason some women don't get that answer\nand they don't know why and maybe it\nhappens them a lot later in their\npregnancies and there's so many\ndifferent levels and variations of what\nit means to have a miscarriage and so\nmany different variables and versions of\nwhat a miscarriage looks like and what a\nmiscarriage feels like to those people\num all I can say is my own personal\nexperience and all the things I was\nfeeling during that time and know that\nyou know 3 years\nlater I have so much more perspective\nand I've given myself so much time to\nheal from that and it no longer feels\nlike an open gaping wound it feels\nlike a a scar it's definitely still with\nme there's a mark there it happened to\nme it's it's more of a you know another\nmark on my Spirit maybe but um I\nhave perspective from it I I have\nhealing from it I really feel like I\ngave myself a lot of time to to to feel\neverything I know I needed to feel for\nmyself and I think it's important for\nother women to hear from others what\nthat it's something that we go\nthrough\nand I didn't know if I would ever\npublicly talk about it but I you know I\nlost hate and I'm talking about grief\nand he was such a huge part of my\njourney and my life and he helped me\ndeal with grief and he's been a huge\npart of you know my mental health and\nbeing there for me and I think there's\nsomething there with you know having\nthat connection to an animal and mental\nhealth and what they can do for our\nmental health I mean there's therapy\ndogs for a reason and horse therapy and\nthere's a reason why people connect to\nanimals so strongly and there's\nsomething there and there's something\nthat's healing and being around them you\nknow and he was such a huge part of that\nhealing and in losing him it did it did\nhurt me in that area that previous\ninjury in my spirit that I had from the\nmiscarriage it\nwas some someone that was with me so\nclosely and so deeply for something so\ndifficult is no longer here I can no\nlonger hold him and you know feel\ncomforted from the wave of emotions that\nmaybe come back from\nhaving this having the miscarriage um so\nyou know it's it's all connected and you\nknow sometimes it it can be painful and\nit can be hurtful and even though it's a\nit is a scar on on me now and it's what\nI feel healed and I feel optimistic and\nI've I've grown a lot from it and you\nknow I do feel like I've kind of come\nout on the other side of going through\nthat it's still a tender spot you know\nwhat I mean it's like if it's poked it\nkind of hurts it's like ow that that was\nthat's from that you know you I can only\nI I have I've never broken a bone crazy\nenough as it is so I I can imagine it's\nmaybe similar to if you break a bone in\nyour body it still hurts maybe later in\nlife and you feel aches and pains and\nall these things so um it's it's an\ninjury that I've feel like my spirit's\nendured and it's still there but um I've\nreally worked through it and worked\nthrough healing and um I think there's a\nlight at the end of the tunnel and and\nterms of if you're going through through\nthat um it takes time and who knows\nmaybe now I maybe I think I'm Healed and\nmaybe fully not I don't know I I feel\nconfident and comfortable enough to\nspeak about it so maybe that's a layer\nand a step towards like towards healing\nmaybe we're never fully done healing and\nand and growing from things I mean we're\nnever done growing we grow forever and\never and ever until the day we die so um\nit might evolve and it might change\ngoing forward and you know it might\ncontinue and shift and I can maybe look\nback on where I'm at today and think I\nstill had some work to do and I wasn't\naware of it yet so you know we'll kind\nof we'll see where it goes but you know\nkind of where I'm at now is this is the\nhead space that I'm in I feel\num comfortable and you know confident\nenough to sort of talk about it and talk\nabout you know what happened and and\nshare it and hope that others can maybe\nconnect with it and\nfeel Not Alone um I know it's it can\nfeel isolating especially if there is no\none in your life that's been through it\nand you don't feel like you have\nsomebody to connect to so hopefully it\nit just helps and I feel like that's\nkind of why I wanted to share that was\njust because you know the many layers of\ngrief and in my loss I've I've felt lost\nbefore and I lost someone that went\nthrough me through that loss with me so\nI I kind of just wanted to touch on both\nof those things just because I know they\ncan be it's something that a lot of\npeople go through losing a pet losing a\nloved one and then obviously you know\nlosing a pregnancy and going through a\nmiscarriage and and\nso thank you for the courage and bravery\nto share that with us here today for the\nfirst time publicly Beyond friends and\nfamily\nand when I was listening to you Taylor I\nwas just thinking like I appreciate just\nthe level\nof comp and layers that you're willing\nto kind of look at this from whether\nit's personally others everyone I mean I\nwas saying to you that I've had multiple\nfriends in the\nlast two to three years who've all\nexperienced a uh miscarriage and I talk\nto them and I'll hear from them and I\nsee so much\njust stress overwhelm pressure um self\ndegradation like you know just um\nnegative selft talk like there's it's\nit's it's one of the hardest things to\ngo through even if everyone goes through\nit as you or not everyone but so many\npeople go through it it doesn't make it\nany easier and often actually like you\nsaid it makes you so lonely that you\ndon't want to talk to anyone about it\nyeah and it's it's not comforting to\nknow other people have gone through it\nand I wonder in that lonely phase like\nwhat was it that did help you and even\nwhen your friend went through it what\nallowed you to be there for other in a\nway that was comforting and helpful\nrather than felt uncomfortable and\nunhealthy I needed to be\nalone um I needed to like I needed to\nfeel it I needed\nto yeah sit in it I didn't want to talk\nabout\nit um because I didn't want people want\nto be there for you and that's really\nspecial and that's really helpful but I\ndidn't want people to be there for yet I\nwasn't\nready for people to be like oh I'm so\nsorry or you know cuz people don't know\nwhat to say sometimes when it comes to\ngrief or loss sometimes I don't know\nwhat to say either I have no idea on how\nto react to some things\nstill having experienced my own version\nof grief\num H how do you be there for\nsomebody it's a difficult thing I mean I\ndidn't know how I\nneeded I didn't know what I needed from\npeople\num I didn't want to talk about it I\nwanted to be alone I didn't want anyone\nto know because I didn't want people to\ntalk to me about it or say things to me\nbecause I just wasn't ready to hear it\nyet um and the way that I\nthink I told people that were really\nreally close to me really my husband\nobviously knew because it happened to\nhim\ntoo um and my two best friends knew and\nthe way that I feel like they were there\nfor me because they didn't know what to\nsay they didn't say anything they were\nthere for me physically they held me\nthey let me cry I just sat there and I\ncried and said nothing and they just\nheld my hand and were like just sat\nthere with me and like let me cry they\ndidn't ask me questions they didn't ask\nme how I felt they didn't\nask they didn't say anything to me like\nthey didn't say everything happens for a\nreason don't worry like you'll feel one\nday D they didn't go into that I think\nbecause they know me so well they\nprobably knew that I didn't want to hear\nthat\nyet they just were there and they\nlistened when I was ready to talk and\nthen because I wasn't ready ready they\njust let me\nemote and they just let me cry\nand they cried and I could tell because\nI was hurt they were hurt you know my my\nwhen I finally got to my husband and we\nwere together he just held me we both\ncried and he just held me and you know I\nheld him too because I think that's\nanother thing is another layer on top of\nit\nis even though it physically happened to\nme and emotionally was something that I\nexperienced it was it was an individual\nexperience to myself emotionally it's\nsomething that it's a loss that happened\nto him as well he also thought\npotentially he would be having a child\nso we were both grieving something we\nwere both grieving the loss of of this\nwe were both feeling this weird sense of\nrelief at the same time and then\nimmediately guilty because we felt\nrelief and then\nimmediately anger because we felt guilt\nand you know what I mean it's just it's\nRelentless these emotions when it's\nfresh you know you feel literally every\nsingle one that's on the rainbow of all\nthe colors we felt we felt all of them\nand I think when it's when it was the\nvery beginning I think for me it was\njust holding PE people holding me you\nknow being in just being in the space\nwith me they didn't have to say anything\nif they didn't know what to say you\nknow and\nwhen we did sort of start talking about\nit I I we first started\nsaying this sucks I can't believe this\nis happening um you know it\nwas if I was feeling angry then they\nwould be angry with me if I was the if I\nwas sad then they were sad with me um so\nit was amaz they were amazing at being\nthere for me in those ways and you know\nI think it is difficult to know what to\nsay and how to be there for someone but\nI think following them and how they're\nreacting is also really good like taking\nthe cue from how they're responding is a\ngood way to respond back to someone and\nyou know checking in you know my my\nfriends that knew checked in with me how\nare you feeling today you know and then\nif I didn't want to talk about they were\nlike okay let me know when you are ready\nyou know yeah we're here mhm so just you\nknow they were checking in you know\nmaking sure and then you know my my best\nfriend she who she experienced this as\nwell\nshe continues to check in with me you\nknow this is 3 years later and we still\ntalk about it oh my gosh like can you\nbelieve it you would have a\nthree-year-old I'm like I know and it's\njust we we get to have these moments\ntogether of we would both have a\nthree-year-old right now that's and we\nwe think about that and we deal with\nthat and we grieve that and we grieve\nthe loss of that potential and that\ndirection in life you know that thread\nthat didn't happen in this path so um\nfemale friendships are incredible and\nthey're beautiful and I think it's\nreally important for women to have women\nin their life if they can they can go to\nand they can talk to about these things\nbecause we can relate to each other in\nother ways that I think you know you I\ncould get from my husband and being able\nto go to her was so special um and\nreally helpful\nso I just I think also have patience\nwith with yourself and if you know\nsomeone who's going through that have\npatience with them because it's a roller\ncoaster and you know she was my my\nfriend she was going through this too\nand I was feeling emotions and I was\nfeeling heartbroken because I know cuz\nshe was heartbroken so I was feeling\nemotions as well and I just have to be\npatient\nbecause the it it's happening to her so\nat her Pace at her time when she's ready\nwhen she wants to hear when she wants to\ntalk about it we\ncan and we both kind of just we both\nshare\nthat understanding with each other\nsomething powerful really powerful that\nyou said was I wasn't ready for someone\nto be there for me yet and I think\nthat's such a really remarkable insight\nas I was listening to you I was\nthinking often when we see people who\nare\nstruggling because their struggle causes\nus discomfort we want to solve it for\nthem and so if I'm speaking to a friend\nwho's like oh you know my friend's going\nthrough this or my partner's going\nthrough this and they're spiraling and\nwe're so uncomfortable with their\ndiscomfort that we want to fix to\nrelieve our own discomfort not realizing\nthat that person may need to feel and\nexperience all of it yeah and and to let\nit all out in their own way and I love\nwhat you just said\nof I just wasn't ready for someone to be\nthere for me yet and I\nthink that's a great note for all of us\nto ask ourselves like am I ready for\nsomeone to be there for me yet and if\nI'm trying to help someone are they\ntruly ready for me to be there for them\nyeah and one of the things that I've\nseen in and you mentioned as well when\nwe were talking this idea about how\nthere's so much pressure also on the\ncouple so there's you're both\nindividually dealing with loss and grief\nbut then there's like a dynamic that you\ngo through with each other yeah because\nyou're both at different spaces of\nhealing you're both at different\ntimelines the waves come differently\nit's affected both of you but then\nyou're both trying to be there for each\nother like it's quite a\nunique relation uh it's quite a unique\nsituation mhm walk us through how you\nnavigated that overwhelming pressure and\nfeeling together as well and what did it\ntake to to reconnect and I mean I don't\neven think it's finding normaly it's\nlike evolving but what does that look\nlike I mean my husband is so kind he's\nso he's very he's very gentle he's very\num he's very understanding he he knows\nI'm an emotional person he knows I feel\nthings deeply um he like heavily and he\nknows that I I was distraught you know I\nhe he could see that I\nwas I'm even I'm even feeling it now you\nknow\njust all these different things all at\nthe same time and um he's a supportive\npartner to me um and I think what was\nreally helpful for us\nwas you know I think he had a really\ngreat understanding and\nhe's he was\nso wonderful during those times for me\num\nhe I think for him he understood okay\nthis is something that he's like okay\nI'm I'm feeling I also can't speak for\nhim obviously because this these is this\nis his these are his feelings and and\nhis journey as well so I'm as I'm saying\nthis it's more just like collectively\nwhat you know we both went through it\nwas the shared experience that I'm I'm\ntouching\non um and things that he did say and\nexpress to me so you know I felt that he\nhad a really great understanding of you\nknow equal the equal amount of\nheartbreak of loss you know he was\nfeeling that too and we got we had a\nshared experience in that and I think he\nalso had a really great understanding of\nthis is physically happening to her as\nwell as it is emotionally happening to\nher he knew it would take me\nlonger\nto gain perspective to start my healing\nprocess to you know know be able to\nadjust or you know process my emotions\njust because I think you know he said to\nme you know whatever I feel like I'm\nfeeling I know you're feeling it\ntenfolds I know what you're going\nthrough is a physical reaction in your\nbody of change and then the change of\nbecoming pregnant the change of losing\nthat pregnancy the the emotional change\nfrom all of those things\nso for us it was really helpful that he\nwas super\nunderstanding and you know he's really\ngreat at navigating emotion as well um\nand I think it was helpful for me when\nhe talked about it with me when he would\nsay things\nlike today is the day it happened and\nhe's reminding me and he's the one\ntalking about it it makes me feel less\nalone that he still remembers it that he\nstill carries it with him because\nsometimes you\nknow we just because\nit's we've had some time and we've had\nsome some distance I know I carry this\nwith me forever you know I know I will\nbecause this happened to\nme in more ways than one and I worry\nsometimes you know or I did that well\nmaybe he won't feel that way like maybe\nhe'll move on faster maybe he'll forget\nabout it maybe all these things and and\nthen you feel sad and you\nknow different emotions around that and\nlike I know that that can be really\ncomplicated in a dynamic of loss of\nthey're moving on oh they're forgetting\nabout this they're not talking about\nthis anymore so for me what was really\nhelpful is because I know that he went\nthrough this too I love that he checks\nin with me I love that he talks about it\nwith me I love that he also says things\nlike can you believe we would maybe have\nhad a three-year-old\noh my God you think about that too it\nmade me\nfeel so seen like so heard and that he\nsees me all the time you know he\nsees when people we've been married for\nalmost a year now so he sees when people\nmake comments like oh when are you guys\ngoing to have kids or are you thinking\nabout having kids and people ask you\nknow it's a harmless question and I\nunderstand when people ask it and it's\nit's I'm not angry that people ask that\nquestion I think it's part of society\nyou know people want to talk about it\nyou know people are excited about having\nstarting families if we we want to start\na family which we do and we've spoken\nwith our friends that we would want to\nhave a family one day so I understand\nwhy they're asking us those questions\nbut not everybody knows that I went\nthrough this and at that time I mean now\nmaybe everybody everybody will know I\nwent through this but I wasn't ready for\neverybody to know that I was going\nthrough this and I had to deal with\nthose questions in Al and um it was\npainful to hear those questions you know\npeople would make comments because a lot\nof my friends had babies during covid\nand everyone was like oh you know\neveryone had all these babies you know\nduring Co and everyone was getting\npregnant and I did and I was pregnant\nand I didn't have a baby so I would hear\ncomments like that I would hear things\nlike that oh also people assume that\nmaybe I have had a kid and they just\ndon't know yet oh did did you have a kid\nwere you one of those girls during Co\nthat had a kid and I'm like oh God I\nknow what you mean when you're saying\nthat but uh you have no idea no I'm I'm\nnot I guess I'm not um so he would sort\nof see me and like see that I was\ndealing with that internally and trying\nto process socializing and you know\nnavigating these um comments because\nit's nobody's fault that they're asking\nit you know it's it's just normal it's\njust life right so I have to I do have\nto grow from this I have to be able to\nhandle this I have to be able to talk\nabout this again I do have to be able to\nbe okay and I I wasn't always okay and I\nthink he saw that I wasn't always okay\nand I could tell that he was hurt when I\nwas hurt I could tell that he he was\nfeeling what I was feeling you know and\nI also shared it with him too because\npeople can't read your mind you know\nthis is my partner this is my life\npartner um this is the person that I've\ndecided that I want to spend life with\nand do life with so I have to do life\nwith them right so I have to make a\npoint to share today I'm feeling extra\nbad because it's the week of my\nmiscarriage it's the anniversary week\nI'm not going to feel good this week you\nknow I say that I express that he cannot\nread my mind he has no idea what I'm\nfeeling unless I'm saying it\nso you know I it's a two-way street um\nthat I share with him and that he sees\nme and he understands me so and he does\nhe's really great at understanding how I\nemote you know my tells my you know\nphysical things that maybe I do he's\nlike she's nervous she's upset I could\ntell she's holding back tears right now\nhe helps remove me from said situation\nyou know so um learning each other and\nsharing with each other and he he knows\nthose things he he he's been able to\nlearn those things because I've shared\nthem with him and I've shown him and\ntold him and vice versa he's shared with\nme and told me and shown me um how I can\ncare and love and be there for him so um\nI think\njust for uh a couple in this scenario\nhowever you're dealing with the loss of\na pregnancy or a child because I know\npeople can see in many different ways\nand there's a lot of stress in in\nstarting a family on on multiple\ndifferent types of relationships and\npartners and spouses and how you're\ngoing about it and how you're dealing\nwith and what you're going through and\nand you know what you're doing with each\nother and how you're the your journey\nwith with that is um is unique to you to\nto your both of your situations and the\nway that you guys communicate with each\nother is is important and and learning\neach other\nand asking for something is there's no\nthere's nothing wrong with asking for\nsomething and then they're able to\nadjust and and do that for you so I feel\nlike that's something that I've learned\nas well is being open and making sure\nI'm sharing and you know he's really\ngreat at just innately because we've\nknown each other and we're we're we love\neach other he's he's good at you know\nknowing and figuring out those little\nthings that I do for himself and just\nseeing me but also I've shared a lot\nwith him and he listens and he adapts\nand he changes for those things for me\nand does those things for me so um I\nthink that communication is probably the\nnumber one most important thing and also\nthe most difficult thing I know\ncommunicating is so difficult how do you\nbe vulnerable how do you share these\nthings am I ready to talk about this do\nI want to say this and you know I don't\nknow I think just say it and and and ask\nfor it and communicate it because again\nyou know they may may have no idea that\nthat's even going on in your head and\nthey have something completely different\ngoing on in their\nhead yeah no it's it's so true and I\nappreciate you sharing that because I\nthink a lot of people are both dealing\nwith the grief and then they're dealing\nwith the loss of the relationship they\nhad and the one they thought they were\ngoing to have when they had a child\ntogether as well and so communication's\nat the core and the Heart of all of that\nbecause it's so multi-layer and so\ncomplex Taylor as I was listening to you\nand I asked this question very\nsensitively and I asked it in order to\nhopefully\nhelp people who are listening as well\nlike\nwhere where how do you refine the\nconfidence to want to think about a\nfamily again and try again because I and\nI ask it very sincerely and sens\nsensitively thinking about people\nlistening who are like I don't think I\ncan ever try again because it was so\npainful and that's generally a human\nreaction to pain if it was so painful I\ncan't go there again yet I have this\ndesire to have a family like how how for\nyou do you know when you're ready to\nthink about again even or open up to the\nidea I know I want one I I don't think\nI've I don't think I'm there yet I\nhaven't I don't know actually if I've\nconfronted that for myself you know I\ndon't think I've I've gone there where\none day I'm going to be trying to have a\nfamily and you know maybe that stick is\ngoing to say pregnant is it going to\nbring back all these emotions and how am\nI going to deal with that\nagain h gosh I have no idea because you\nknow I'm not there yet I'm I'm still not\nready for a child and I'm and I'm not\nready to think about it and I'm not\nready to start having a family and I\ndon't know when that is and you know a\nlot of people who've had children are\nlike you'll never know the timing's\nnever right all this stuff and\neveryone's journey is different and\nthat I I I have no plan I have no\ntimeline of when I'm going to start a\nfamily when I'm going to do that how I'm\ngoing to to do it I I don't know and I\nalso have no idea what I'm about to\nconfront when I start trying again you\nknow is it going to be really easy am I\ngoing to is it going to be fine did this\nscenario happen to me simply because of\nthe IUD or will I experience this again\nbecause you know a pregnancy is is a new\norganism in your body it's like a\ntechnically a I don't know it's I can\nonly I think of it maybe as almost like\na bacteria that's like it's introducing\nlike a new thing inside of your body and\na a miscarriage is a rejection of that\nyour body being like that shouldn't be\nhere what is this this is new and\nsometimes it it takes time to adjust\nyour body has to be like oh that's what\nthat is so maybe it takes a couple tries\nand you know that's why your body's\ndoing that I don't know why my body did\nthat probably the IUD most likely if\ndoctors are listening they'll probably\nbe like oh it's the IUD that's why I was\nlike okay okay fine that's why but um I\nI guess I'll sort of I maybe I'll be\nable to speak on that more when I'm in\nin the head space of actively trying or\nif and when I do have a child like to be\nable to touch on that again but I think\nI'm nervous you know I'm I do have fears\nabout getting to that stage in my life\nand I'm worried about what I'm going to\nstart feeling when um I am pregnant\nagain I want to enjoy the process I want\nto be you know excited I want to feel\nall of those things but unfortunately\nbecause of what i' I went through I know\nthat in the beginning I won't I'll feel\nfear I'm going to be afraid I know I'm\ngoing to be scared I know I'm going to\nhave like anxiety about it until who\nknows when maybe the entire pregnancy I\ndon't know but um I know I've been\nthrough this before I I know I can\nhandle this I'm stronger because of this\nif it happens to me again I'm going to\nbe okay um you know look at how far I've\ncome look at what I how I\nhandled this like what we went through\nlike I I have confidence in that at\nleast but I I also I I have no idea what\nwhat that is going to look like for me\nuntil I start doing that or until it\nhappens\nso you know I would I I would say for me\nwhat how I can rationalize it\nis I'm stronger because of this I've\nhandled I've I've been through this this\nthing and I've I've dealt with something\nthat was really difficult for me\npersonally to to go through and I came\nout the other side whether or not I'm\nfully done yet we don't know we'll we'll\nfigure it out when we get there but\nright now all I can say is I feel\nconfident that I'll I'm going to I know\nI'm going to be okay no matter what I'm\ngoing to be okay I can get through\nanything I can do this like I have a\ngreat support in my husband in my family\nin my friends they were all there for\nfor me they showed their love and\nsupport I was there for me I was there\nfor myself I showed up you know so I\nknow I can show up for myself I know I\ncan be there I know I can pick myself\nback up again and start walking and make\nit you know make those steps towards\nhealing again so we're resilient as\npeople as as humans and having faith in\nour resilience and in our strength and\nand in our ability to find healing and\nfind growth I think we forget and we\ndoubt ourselves sometimes that we can do\nthat we can do we can get through that\nthank you for such an honest answer I\nfeel like I feel like a lot of people\nwill be able to resonate and connect\nwith that this idea of I don't know see\nwhen I get there I don't even if I'm\nready to answer that question and I\nthink I think people listening to that\nwill feel a sense of relief because I\nthink that naturally again like you said\nwhen when you go through it you have to\nget into tactical mode of how do we make\nsure it's done and clean and\neverything's okay and then we get into\nokay how do I start and it's you almost\ndon't give yourself that space so thank\nyou so much for giving everyone Space by\neven having that answer it's it's really\nbeautiful and Powerful to hear Taylor\nYou've Been So uh gracious and kind with\nyour time today with your energy with\nyour soul like I really feel like you've\nled us in which is so kind I really hope\nyou feel we've honored Tay uh and given\na chance for you to express your love\nfor Tay and also uh honored your\nexperiences and you know I feel like\nlike\nwith your your whole career and\neverything it's almost like I find that\nyou know when you've been modeling from\nsuch a young age and you've been in the\npublic eye like so much of your career\nbecomes about um your looks your age\nyour you know those things become big\nand as you transform and evolve as a\nhuman too as you're starting you know T\nand tailor and you're starting a company\nor you started a company that's doing\nall this incredible purposeful work and\nyou built a Content platform and a\nplatform where people can find amazing\nproducts amazing Services amazing\nPartnerships for their pets and their\ndogs and everything else like walk us\nthrough how you see that Evolution for\nyourself of coming from an industry in a\nspace that is defined by these external\nthings of looks and age and fitness and\neverything and then finding your path\nthrough that now yeah I think you know\nthey really play such a big role with\neach other I think why I even wanted to\nstart T and Tor and start a business and\nbe in the pet space obviously I have a\nhuge passion for animals and dogs like\nthis is so much more to me than just a\ncompany I'm doing this because this is\nabsolutely 100% like the thing I love\nmost in the world is my dog Tate and my\ndog Salem I have now too and they're\njust so incredible and amazing and they\nchange they've changed my life in so\nmany ways and even Salem now has\nimpacted my life in so many different\nways than Tate did and I'm so excited\nabout the journey and the the life that\nI'm going to live with him and the\nthings he's about to teach me and show\nme and I don't think I would even be\nable\nto know how to do that and build\nsomething with intention and purpose if\nI hadn't had my career before you know I\nstarted um modeling when I was 14 I\ndon't have a traditional education in in\nthat sense but I've learned so much from\nfrom my job and from working at a young\nage and traveling the world and having\nso many experiences I feel like I\nlearned by by doing and you know by\nbeing able to see how things work and\nyou know people producing fashion\nCollections and watching them make the\nclothes on me to walking in the fashion\nshow and seeing how things are done is\nreally interesting and being a part of a\nof of a photo shoot and all the\ndifferent areas and everyone has a\ndifferent job and seeing how it all\ncomes together and how everybody works\nand all the puzzle pie is kind of like\nyou know as I'm sure you know it's just\nlike it's interesting and there's a lot\nof different um layers to what goes into\nsomething like a photo shoot or you know\na campaign or a video or a movie or you\nknow um a fashion show and it was really\nfun and exciting for me to witness and\nand see those things and do those things\nand you know I think modeling has been\nit is a lot about um it is about\nphysically what I look like 100% like\nI'm a model because of how I look I know\nthat so it's an interesting thing to go\nfrom you know I I'm here because of how\nI look but also I feel like after a\ncertain extent I'm still here because of\nwho I am and I'm still hearing people um\ncontinue hopefully to work with me\nbecause we have fun together and we\nbuild relationships and they get to know\nme and it becomes more than just this\nyou know surface transaction of she\nlooks a certain way she fits the bill\nphysically of what we're looking for so\nwe're going to book her I think after 14\nyears you know you start knowing people\nand establishing relationships and\nbecoming friends with people in the\nindustry and then people want to work\nwith you because they like you they like\nhanging out with you you're it's it's\nlike a lot of Industries you know what I\nmean the more you are in it the more you\ndo it the more friends you make the more\nconnections you feel like you have with\npeople and the less it becomes about how\nyou look and it becomes a lot about who\nyou are actually like the the my\nreputation of my career in modeling I\nfeel like it's been with people that I\nenjoy working with and I get to work\nwith them again and again and again and\nI love that I love that I now know so\nmany people in the industry and every\ntime I get a call sheet not every time\nbut I get these call sheets and I see\nwho's going to be on set and I'm like oh\nmy God I haven't seen this person in you\nknow however many years and I'm so\nexcited to work with them again and do\nthat so to me it's maybe it starts off\nthat way and and modeling is is about\nthe way that I look and and how I\nphysically am but then I think it\nbecomes a lot deeper than that so you\nknow people establishing those\nconnections with me has like taught me\nhow to to grow and and you know and\nchange\nand just they've taught me so much about\nlife and different different backgrounds\nand different people and different\nthings so um you know I learned so much\nfrom it and I've grown so much from it\nand um you know wanting to start my own\nbusiness I feel like I'm able to do that\nbecause of everything that I've done in\nin my modeling career and I really just\nI see them so much a part of each other\nand I want to be in the pet space and\nhave this this business because it's\nsomething that I also love to do like I\nlove my job I love modeling and I really\nbelieve in pursuing things that you love\nto do and you know maybe I won't be a\nmodel forever I have no idea because\nit's um it's not a very consistent\nlifestyle as much as I love it I'm you\nnever know I you know I just got a text\nmessage today that I'm going to Paris on\nThursday so you know maybe if when I do\nstart trying to have a family and if I\nhave a family and my family is growing\nand growing and growing or you know I\nhave all these hopes and dreams to have\na a big family it'll be more difficult\nto do my modeling career to the extent\nthat I'm doing it now and I I also love\ndogs and I love my dog and I love you\nknow animals and I love that people love\ntheir animals and I wanted to create\nsomething that I wish existed with my\nlife and my journey and path with Tate\nand I'm creating something that I really\nwant and need with Salem my my new dog\nnow that I've rescued and because we're\ngoing through so many different things\nand I'm so excited to you know have be\nable to build on the experience I've had\nfrom modeling and apply it to what I'm\ndoing now with t and Taylor and build\nsomething with purpose build something\nwith you know meaning something that I'm\npassionate about doing something that I\nlove it's it's my lifestyle it's you\nknow I'm that crazy dog lady that every\ntime I see a dog on the street I'm like\nhello how are you nice to meet you\nwhat's your name I just I love dogs and\nI love animals in general too so I I\nreally think that dogs are connectors\nand I've met a lot of people and had so\nmany amazing interesting convers ations\nbecause of our dogs if you're out\nwalking your dog and people stop you oh\nmy god what kind of dog is that oh my\nGod he's so beautiful you know are they\na boy or are they a girl what's their\nname and and the next thing you know\nyou're having a full-blown conversation\nwith the complete and total stranger but\nI feel like I'm in a safe space you know\nit's it's really interesting and I as um\na shy I started out really shy and kind\nof an introverted person having Tate\neverybody loved him people were like oh\nmy God that's the cutest dog I've ever\nseen\nand I I had to open up I had to have\nconversations with people and he helped\nme do that and he helped me connect with\npeople and you know someone that um\nworks with me on Tate and Taylor I met\nthrough Tate in my building you know\nbecause we had like a doggy play dat\ngroup chat in the building and she\ninvited us and you know our dogs were\nplaying and we connected and now she's\nhelping me you know build um Bill Tayon\nTaylor so I love dogs I think that\nthere's they're just amazing and and\ntheir connectors and it's something that\nI I love so much and find so much joy in\nand I hope that people you know receive\nthat and see that and um are excited\nabout it because you know I'm really\npassionate about how I take care of my\ndog and the the love I want to give him\nI want to give give him the best life\npossible because they're not with us\nforever as you know I I know very well\nand I want to cherish every single\nsecond I possibly can with them and I\nknow so many pet pet people people who\nhave pets want want that as well and you\nknow there's definitely a lack of uh\nCommunity I think in the pet industry\nthere is community but there's not like\na place I feel like there there wasn't a\nplace to go for information to connect\nto other people and I really hope to\nbuild that and grow Tate and tailor into\nsomething where people feel like this is\nhappening to me and I don't know what to\ndo maybe we can help you figure that out\nso that's sort of the intention in doing\nwhat we're doing you know we have the\nthe online store we're like curating\nproducts we're looking for amazing\nFounders and Brands and people who are\ndoing Innovative things in the pet space\nwith whether that's treats that are with\nreally great great quality we have\nwomen-owned businesses I love the idea\nof supporting women and um you know\nyoung cool entrepreneurs doing really\ninteresting things and maybe helping do\nthat together and giving them a a space\nand a platform to Showcase and talk\nabout their product and why it's great\nand and why it's different and you know\nhelp them sort of just like share what\nthey're doing with the world because\nthere's so many passionate you know\nentrepreneurs out there who are starting\nthese companies in the pet space and\nthey're so dedicated and they have just\nas much passion and love as I do for\ntheir dogs and and they've gone through\nsomething completely different than\nmaybe I've gone through with Tate you\nknow so it's really interesting to be\nable to um speak with businesses and\nspeak with you know Founders about why\nthey started their company what their\ngoal and what their mission their Drive\nis why they're doing what they're doing\nyou know challenges they've faced as\nwomen in the industry as you know um\njust an Entre being an entrepreneur in\ngeneral there's there's so many things\nthat you know we would we want to touch\non in in that space that I think there's\njust I felt like it wasn't there when I\nwas going through that with Tate you\nknow and I really want to create that\nfor people and and bring people together\nand have it be fun and you know really\neasy and exciting you know to care and\nlike find cool products and great and\nthings at work that that you know we\nlike for our pets\nso yeah that's a really powerful no it's\na really powerful intention and Powerful\nMission and it's it's so clear and\nevident and I feel like you're going to\nrevolutionize the pet space it's it's\nit's obvious that your your drive and\npassion is true and couple of lessons I\ntook away just listening to you one was\nthis idea I think we live in a world\nwhere when we discover something we're\npassionate about we like to Discount our\npast experience and make it seem like oh\nnow I found it whatever I did before was\nkind of like it was there but now I\nfound it and what I love hearing about\nfrom you and and I definitely resonate\nwith what you said it's like actually\nevery stage of your career unlocks the\nopportunity the ability the ideas the\nresources the connectivity to do the\nnext thing and I think if anyone out\nthere is right now you're listening and\nyou're going I hate my job I hate where\nI am I don't what I'm doing I promise\nyou there's some skill or some lesson or\nsome person or some contact that you met\nthrough that that could help you build\nthe next part of yourself and overall\nyour your business and your Venture and\nthis direction you've gone in is truly a\njourney of pain to purpose of passion to\npurpose of using your platform for a\npurpose and I think that it's such a\nbeautiful example that so many of us no\nmatter what our pains are what our\nstresses are what our challenges are\nthat we can transform them into an\noffering to help other people who are\ngoing through the same thing yeah\nbuilding a brand with um with intention\nI think and with a purpose to give back\nand help I think is really important and\nsomething that especially in the pet\nspace I felt was lacking because there's\nso many areas I would love to tap into\nout you know just beyond the um cancer\nfunding and um maybe even cancer\nresearch and getting into that and\nunderstanding why and how and you know\nand as well as rescue you know we work\nwith rescue organizations and my Salem\nmy my dog Salem is a rescue and and\nthat's an experience that he's been\nteaching me about and something that I\nwant I want to make a change and make an\nimpact in I think for me with Tate and\nTaylor the most important thing about\nthis business is using it to make make\nan impact and do good things with it and\nand use it to help people and help\nothers and help dogs you know help\npeople who have dogs or you know\nhopefully animals pets in general we're\nwe'll get there one day we if you have\nan iguana great maybe we'll be able to\nhelp you with that I don't know um who\nknows where it's going to go that's\nwhat's so exciting it's so new and it's\nso fresh and right now we're dogs right\nnow so I'm obviously talking about dogs\nbecause that's what we are doing\ncurrently um I do have the hope and the\noptimism and the intention to want to do\nas much as I possibly can um but you\nknow I'm going to focus on one thing and\nthen we can start growing from there and\nbuilding on top of that so um in the pet\nspace there's just so much that I want\nto do and so much I want to accomplish\nand I want to be able to build something\nthat that helps most importantly and\nthat does give back and that does have a\ndrive and does have a cause because\nthere is a drive there is a cause and\nthere is a reason behind everything that\nI'm doing and it's Tate it's dedicated\nto him it's dedicated to everything he\ntaught me the love I know he has for me\nthe love I have for him and it's for\neveryone who's ever felt that way about\na dog or a pet in their life it's a\ndedication to that it's a dedication to\nthat feeling and knowing you want to\ntake care of something you love\nsomething so deeply so do we we know\nthat feeling we understand that and we\nwant to make something and build\nsomething with you that is imp ful and\nand meaningful and helpful and\nconnective and hopefully we can you know\nbuild a great community and and have\nincredible resources for people so you\nknow we're this is just the beginning of\nour of our journey with with it and I'm\nreally really excited about it so well\ncongratulations Taylor and we end every\nepisode of on purpose with a Fast Five\nwhich have to be answered in one word to\none sentence maximum I talk a lot before\nyou might have noticed from that so\nTaylor Hill these are your final five uh\nquestion one is what is the best advice\nyou've ever heard or received best\nadvice is do what you love and the rest\nwill come my dad told me that great\nanswer all right question number two\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nheard or received maybe uh if you ignore\nit it'll go away or something that's a\ngood one yeah that's absolutely not true\ngood answer uh question number\nthree what's the first you do every\nmorning and the last thing you do every\nnight well I'm really not a morning\nperson so first thing in the morning I'm\nlike why am I awake what's that alarm\nwhy what's happening I'm very\ndisoriented first thing in the morning\num and I think\nI drink coffee I need I need to have a\ncup of coffee I'm not a morning person\nand then at night I love snuggling with\nmy dog kissing Salem and in the past I\nyou know kissing Tate having good night\ncuddles um you know with if I'm at home\nwith my husband this is more than one\nsentence I've already failed you know\nsaying good night and you know having\ntime like you know a connection with\nwith him yeah uh question number\nfour what's something you learned lately\nsomething a skill that you picked up a\nlesson that you learned recently not\nthat recent but lately I've been\nlearning how to cook and doing it better\ncool cooking more and being better at it\nbut that's taken time nice it does take\ntime uh Fifth and final question if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\nalways grow you know\nalways change like be be willing to grow\nand change I don't know how to apply\nthat as a law but I think growth is so\nimportant and you know acknowledging\npast mistakes and growing and changing\nfrom them is really important and\nsomething I'm still learning and trying\nto do but I think if we can all work on\nthat and do that maybe the world could\nbe a better place absolutely well said\nTaylor Hill everyone Taylor thank you so\nmuch for sharing your heart your soul\nyour uh beautiful experiences thank you\nfor being so open and honest with our\ncommunity and

difficult conversations\nand of course check out Tay and Taylor I\ncan't wait for you to uh give your dogs\nall the love that they deserve and uh\nwant to say a big thank you again to\nTaylor for her presence love and energy\nthank you very much happy to have been\nhere thank you if you love this episode\nyou will also love my interview with\nKendall Jenner on setting boundaries to\nincrease happiness and healing your\ninner child you could be reading\nsomething that someone is saying about\nyou and being like that is so unfair cuz\nthat's not who I am and that really gets\nto me sometimes but then looking at\nmyself in the mirror and being like but\nI know who I am why does anything else\nmatter"
