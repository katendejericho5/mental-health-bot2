host the number\none Health and Wellness podcast on\npurpose with Jay Shetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou

to\nunderstand more to help us not feel\nalone to help us feel connected in our\npain and in our purpose and to recognize\nthat we have so much more in common and\nthat when we work together we can truly\nfind the light in our lives now today's\nguest is someone who I believe does this\nwith every step every word and\neverything she takes on in her life I've\nhad the fortune of getting to know her\nover the last few years and I can\nhonestly say that not only is she one of\nthe most genuine and kind-hearted people\nI know she's also just one of the most\nloving and Soulful people who truly\nwants to change lives I have to start\nthe episode by saying this I believe\ntoday's game is someone who's extremely\non purpose I'm speaking about the one\nand only Selena Gomez one of the most\nglobally and culturally celebrated\nartists actors producers entrepreneurs\nand most importantly I know to her\nphilanthropists of her generation as a\nrecording artist Selena has sold more\nthan 210 million singles worldwide and\nhas over 45 billion Global streams her\nupcoming biographical documentary which\nI want you to go and see Selena Gomez my\nmind and me is out right now I got to\nsee it earlier I'll tell you all about\nit and in 2019 Selena launched her\nbeauty line rare Beauty exclusively with\nSephora as part of the partnership Gomez\nannounced the rare impact fund pledging\nto raise this is outstanding pledging to\nraise 100 million dollars for mental\nhealth services for individuals in\nunderserved communities philanthropy and\nactivism have been key pillars of\nSelena's career and she's used her\nplatform to advocate for many important\ncauses Selena has raised millions of\ndollars for charity including Global\nCitizen and the lupus reaches research\nAlliance please welcome to the show\nSelena Gomez Selena it is so wonderful\nto be with you that was so nice I felt\nvery like emotional and I felt so\nI felt so honored thank you for saying\nthose kind words I I meant every word I\nthink whenever I've sat with you\nwe've always had a conversation about\npurpose yeah or is that a conversation\nabout service always had a conversation\nthat's reflective but I wanted to start\nwith this because I we are going to talk\nabout lots of deep and meaningful things\ntoday yes but I also wanted to start\nwith this because\nit's my first memory of meeting you and\nyou've you've probably forgotten this\nbut at least for me here we go okay so\nuh you'd come over for dinner there's\nthe first time we met and I remember\nthat we were about to eat my wife had\nmade dinner for us and\nwe say a prayer before we eat but the\nprayer is chanted and sung somewhat in\nSanskrit which is a language yeah that\nthat a lot of prayers are in for for my\npractice and I remember having to do it\nin front of you and then afterwards\nopening my eyes and go I just had to\nsing in front of Selena Gomez\nand I actually do remember do you\nremember yes you were like I don't know\nif I should sing in front of you I was\nlike please I thought it was beautiful\nyeah I thought it was amazing and also\njust to say the food was incredible I\nremember that more than anything I love\nthat well I wanted to start off by just\nsaying to you that I truly believe that\nthis documentary is so special genuinely\nthank you it is it's powerful\nit's inspiring and it's the work that we\nso deeply need right now and your voice\nin the conversation the global\nconversation around well-being and\nmental health\nis the most powerful voice there is it\nreally is thank you and so when you put\nout a piece like this and you let us in\nit only strengthens the conversation\nacross the world and that's something\nthat you're doing so I want to just\nstart off by saying that from the bottom\nof my heart I'm so grateful to you thank\nyou for starting out I think that is\na huge part of why I decided to release\nit after having an internal battle\nI mean daily at one point maybe I\nshouldn't do this maybe I shouldn't\nrelease it and this is too honest this\nis too much of myself\nuntil I realized that ultimately it was\nmeant for something bigger it wasn't\njust about me it was about\nother people and it took a life of its\nown and became what it is now which I'm\nstill nervous about and I'm still\nanxious about but I think releasing it\nis a huge healing\num a healing process for me and it's me\nletting go of that version of myself wow\nyeah that's so powerful to hear that I\nmean\nwhen I hear you say that that I feel\nlike you're one of these people that you\nserve in order to heal and you give in\norder to let go and that's such a\nbeautiful cycle because I think often we\nthink when we're going through things\nthat the more insular we go right but\nyou're someone who opens up yeah and\nsays here it is I think you know being\nin moments in my life whether it was my\nhealth or personal life friendships\nrelationships I feel like giving myself\ncompletely to something is just the best\nway I can love\nbut I never wanted the pain that I\nendured to put some sort of guard on\nmyself and armor if you will and I'd\nnever I never let that happen because\nI still believe and I still hope I hope\nfor love and I hope for healing and I\nhope for change and I never want to lose\nthat of course there are days where I\nfeel so far away but I would rather\ncontinue to get my heart broken then to\nnot feel at all that's the greatest sign\nof strength I mean that is such a\npowerful statement and I think with a\nstatement like that you're encouraging\nso many people\nto feel heard I mean I think most of us\nfeel far away from those things right\nand we're scared to admit that I mean\nyou start the documentary with the\npromise of I'm gonna share my darkest\nsecrets and when I heard that I thought\nwow like\nI was thinking Selena what was why is it\nthat when we share our duck what happens\nwhen we share our darker Secrets not\njust for you but for any of us when\nyou're with your friends when you're\nwith your families like what what does\nthat do I think at first it's\nfrightening\nbut I feel like if you surround yourself\nwith people who\nsupport you and love you\nyou have to be careful with who you\nshare your story with I think that can\nbe dangerous I'm sharing something that\nmaybe was really hurtful or sharing a\nstory about your internal struggles to\nsomeone who may not be giving you the\nright advice or guiding you another way\nthat will only lead you to more pain is\nscary so first and foremost I would say\nmaking sure you surround yourself with\ngreat people and then I would say learn\neverything there is to learn once it's\nout once you say okay I'm dealing with\ndepression then find out every single\nthing you can about what that means and\nwhen you have a relationship with\ndepression as opposed to\nyou know allowing it to keep sinking and\ninside of you it's it's a little bit\nmore freeing I think to understand\nyourself better I want to know what\ntriggers me I want to know why I get\ndepressed and start asking yourself\nquestions to open up yourself instead of\nyou know it's easier said than done\nthough I should say but instead of you\nknow keeping it in I find that the\nbiggest reward is letting it go yeah I I\nthink there's that statement in the\ndocumentary that says you said your mom\nwould always say uh if you're afraid of\nsomething learn more about it and then\nyour fear will go away or something\naccording to this she definitely did\nthat when I was younger I lived in Texas\nand we were huge with um\nthe tornado scene that was what was\nhappening and I was terrified so I would\nbring like a cross and I'd bring like a\nbig pillow and I'd lay in my bathtub\nbecause that's what I Googled is\nsupposedly gonna help and my mom would\njust kind of smile at me and she the\nnext day I remember she got me a bunch\nof books and it was all about\nthunderstorms and different clouds and\nformations and all this stuff and she\njust she just told me and she's like\nit's not that scary you know it's\nespecially when you know that it's just\na part of the world and I I guess they\nare still scary but now I understand\nwhat happens and yeah but I love how\nyou're applying that to depression\nyou're applying that to different things\nin your life I completely agree with I\nmean my favorite thing that I say in the\ndocumentary is that I I have bipolar I\njust I learn how to live with it and I\njust have made it my friend because\nthat's truly what it can be to me now\nyeah and tell us about that process of\nwhen you first discover something like\nthat like you said it's easier said than\ndone the voices are so loud there's so\nmuch inner judgment yeah you know our\ninner critic is so painful to live with\nand now when you're saying I'm trying to\nwork on making it a friend which is a\nbeautiful transition tell us a bit about\nthat journey of inner critic to in a\nfriend well to be honest I've been to\nfour treatment centers and I have a lot\nof opinions on you know rehabs if you\nwill or you know places to go there's a\nlot that I don't agree with but\num what I will say is\nthroughout all of it learning lessons\nthrough dialectical behavior therapy or\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nthere's something that's always been\nembedded in me throughout all of those\ndifferent moments in my life and that\nwas always to\nrecognize when something was happening\nto me accepting it and I think once I\nrealized that this was something that\nwasn't going to go away this wasn't\nsomething that was going to be fixed by\ngoing to these places it was more so\nwhat can I know about myself okay if I\nif I kind of go down this road I'm gonna\nget triggered and I know that feeling\nand I know how to avoid it\nhowever I go to therapy I also have you\nknow medication that I fully I'm on that\nI believe in full heartedly\nand it helps me stay\nbalanced but I still have to deal with\nit you know I still have days that are\npretty low and moments that I'm just too\nover the top and I'm like I want to buy\neveryone a house and I want to save the\nworld\num\nbut I just have learned to kind of\nunderstand it and the best part about\nthat is also my family and friends\nlearning how to live with it too they\ncan be great friends to me in that way\nand that took a lot of time as well yeah\nI know these are such you know I I know\nthat you do so much work in this space\nbut today when I'm hearing you\nshare all these insights and they\ngenuinely are insights they're so\npowerful because\neven you just saying like I had to\nrealize that I don't have to fix it or\nthat it's not going to go away like\nthese things make difficult things\nlivable with right uh and when we look\nat the seasons or we look at the weather\nit's like you know it's gonna rain one\nday and you know it's going to be dark\none day you know it's going to be sunny\nanother day and when you know that you\nstop trying to fight it and change it\nyeah you can accept it which it sounds\nfrom what I'm hearing from you yeah I\nmean it's taken me a long time it's um\nthat's not six years that's probably 10\nyears in reality but it it really it's\nreally been interesting and I feel\nbetter and I feel great now that I can\ntalk about it yeah yeah the thing you\nkeep mentioning today is Letting Go and\nI think all of us are trying to know\nhow to let go of old selves old parts of\nourselves or or parts that don't serve\nus anymore and I remember when I when I\nlived as a monk some of the areas that\nwe'd live in there were often we'd come\nacross a lot of snakeskin uh and we'd\nalways use snakes as an analogy of how\nwe leave behind so snakes don't break\nout they don't rip their skin off they\nSlither out right and their skin just\nkind of like Falls away yes and then we\nwould naturally not find snakes\nthankfully and find skin but that\nanalogy was like really resonated with\nme the idea that when we're shedding\nwhen we're letting go it's not a\naggressive process right how did you\nlearn to become\ncompassion and Karma with yourself\nbecause at first we can really feel like\nwe're trying to break something off yeah\nI think I I tend to blame myself when I\ncan't let something go I feel maybe\nsomething is my fault or I should have\ndone more of this or less of that and it\nstarts to become you know just like a\nreally I kind of turned sad uh one thing\nI've noticed when I watched the\ndocumentary back for the first time I\ndidn't even recognize that girl anymore\nand it broke my heart because I was\ntalking about my body and my image and\nand I just hate that I ever felt those\nfeelings and I think because I have a\nyounger sister\nthere's been this huge responsibility\ngiven to me\nin a way that has helped me and I say\nthis about my fans as well or or people\nthat have you know grown with me\nI've almost had to get back up every\ntime more so for them than myself\nand that's something I've learned to\nreally understand it's it's healthy to\nwant to be strong for other people but I\nneeded to recognize I needed to be\nstrong for myself and that took a while\nand it took things like making myself\nuncomfortable and changing my\num my thought process changing the\nthings I watch on TV changing the music\nI'm listening to little things that I\ncan adjust that will perhaps change my\nmood or make me feel better instead of\nworse you know it is some of these small\nthings isn't it yeah oh my gosh I love\nscary movies but I can't watch them all\nthe time I'm like happy and I'm like\nguys let's watch a scary movie\neveryone's like why why on Earth do you\nwant to do that right now and you're\nkind of like yeah you're right do they\nmanage to persuade you yeah yeah most of\nthe time but it was Halloween so I got\nmy way for for a few weeks you did what\ndid you end up watching oh we watched\nHalloween we watched um Freddy Krueger\nNightmare on Elm Street which one ruins\nyour meat the worst like which one makes\noh my goodness probably like hereditary\nsomething really dark but it was it was\nfun it was Halloween we were just\ncelebrating yeah no there's I always\ncall it Cliffhanger chemicals oh yeah I\nfeel like when we watch things that put\nus into states of anxiety oh yeah or\nstress we release all these Cliffhanger\nchemicals and now you're like well why\ncan't I sleep yeah exactly why am I\nhaving bad dreams yeah Robbie's like\nthat so my wife's like that yeah she\ncan't I have to she always gets really\nexcited to watch things like that yeah\nI'm like Riley we can't do this because\nyou will not let me sleep for the rest\nof the night so funny yeah yeah but I I\nthink it's really beautiful to hear you\nsay there's these little changes because\nI think that's what people feel hard is\nto change and I think when I watch the\ndocumentary\nthe the greatest challenge you really\nempathize with is having to do this when\nevery time you're in a car and then\nevery time you get out the car this\ncameras there's people there's opinions\nthere's you know that's something very\nfew people can relate to but I think\nwhat's so brilliant about the how the\ndocumentaries made is that you really\nfeel like we're living that with you\nyeah and so you're like wow even though\nI can't relate to what Celine is going\nthrough I can understand how it must be\nreally challenging yeah and really\nstressful and so what's it like having\nto deal with all of this that all of us\nare dealing with too but you're dealing\nwith it with an added layer of you know\nexposure yeah to be honest I don't know\nany different yeah that's what's really\nscary sometimes I think that's really\nsad and other times I just think well\nthis is what I've been given and this is\nthe path that I I want to continue to\nwalk in and I know any moment I can you\nknow quit and walk away and you know\nthat's just not really how I was raised\nto be\nso maybe if it had happened to me later\nin life I would have had a different\noutcome but because I was raised in it I\nreally had to learn the hard way on how\nto deal with it on how to\nnot give if you will that click bait\nthat people want and I mean I think I do\nmy I do my best to try and eliminate\nthese negative stories or this or ill or\nother people illustrating my journey it\njust I interrupt them with my truth and\nthat's what I will always continue to do\nand that's what this documentary does as\nwell it's it's going it's going to be me\ntaking control of my story and no one\ncan change that or say any different I I\nactually I'm so glad you addressed that\nbecause I've always found out with you\nthat you always\nlead with love even in those areas and\nand I always am so\nin admiration of that and in awe of that\nbecause I see that whenever there's a\nnarrative that whenever there's any\nnarrative your your choice will always\nbe the lead with love and inject love\ninto that and to recalibrate when did\nyou find the strength to start taking\ncontrol of that narrative because I\nthink that's an amazing skill that today\npeople need it more than ever but when\nyeah when did you start developing the\nconfidence around that needing to do\nthat\num I would probably say\nI started beginning to gain that\nconfidence when I went through a breakup\nand\nthat's something that was super public\nbut all of those things that I'd felt so\nbad about myself and just so terrible\nevery day I wanted to debunk those\nfeelings I wanted to take control over\nthat narrative because I did feel that\nway\nbut the the greatest gift I got from all\nof that was\nme actually being honest with people\nsharing my story and gaining the\nconfidence to know I am enough and\nI actually work really hard at being a\ngood person and I know I'm a great\nperson and when people paint these\nunnecessary stories\nit actually gives me pleasure to to just\ncombat it with love like you said or\nkindness you know I think it's it's\nactually fun for me because it's\nit is who I am I don't I don't I can't\nwaste my time if I'm to be honest with\neveryone in this room I don't want to\nwaste my time being upset or\num taking in all of the negative things\nthat I hear online and I don't even hear\nit it's it's just what it gets really\nbad other people tell me and then I see\ninhumane things happening and people\ntalking negatively about other women and\nit just drives me absolutely crazy and I\nthink I'll just always be that kind of\nperson and I would say I'm grateful for\nmy past because it's made me a lot\nstronger yeah well I want you to know\nthat you know we we see you for that\nthank you like it is it is\nwhenever you do that I am\ncompletely mind blown because it it\nrequires so much self-assurance it\nrequires so much\nuh commitment to your truth and then\nalso for for everyone else so thank you\nso much for leading the way even in that\nlike another thing like no it's so hard\nto do it's so easy to\nit's so easy to be defensive uh and\nyou've found because it's your truth\nyou've found a way of\nsharing your truth without making it\ndefensive of course that's I mean thank\nyou I don't know if I intentionally do\nit but it works really well so I'm\nsticking to it yeah stick to it don't\ndon't change it don't you teach it teach\nit yeah exactly teach it the new\nmasterclass yeah no I I I genuinely mean\nI genuine that um one of the things that\ncomes through in the documentary is\nwe're just getting full access like\nthat's what it feels right like full\naccess at all times\num and we get to see all of your\nrelationships and you get to see the\nrelationships that are long term you get\nnewer relationships you get all these\ndifferent people who are interacting\nwith you and they're interacting with\nyou in every element like we get to see\nyou straight after an interview straight\nbefore an interview and and I could tell\nthere was a time when\nyou you\nfeel a bit of angst because you get\nasked\npoor questions or like you know and I\ncould see that in you\nand that really hit me because\nthe reason we set up this conversation\nthis this podcast in the first place was\nI was hoping that it would be a place\nwhere people like yourself could share\nyour true purpose right and seeing you\nshare on screen just how hard it can be\nto deal with just does it minimize the\nwork you're trying to do what what\nhappens tell me what what happens when\nyou're asked I actually just feel it\nlike insulted sometimes and like\nI I sit in what I worked I mean I work\nso hard I love what I do I love my job I\nlove talking about my job there's\ndifferent facets of my job that I love\ntalking about\nfor different reasons and when I\nsit down and I have to do press from you\nknow starting at 8 am until you know\nwhenever the night ends it's\nit's frustrating you want to spend that\ntime talking about meaningful\nmeaningful moments and I just I wanted\nthat to be in the documentary because I\nfelt like I know that a lot of artists\nmaybe not everyone but I know a lot of\nartists and people in my position feel\nthat way and I hope that it will only\nyou know maybe shift that a bit and\nmaybe stop asking people what word you\nassociate with marshmallow and maybe ask\nthem how they're doing\num you know maybe just having a bit of\nan inspiration to do more and be better\nand and yeah it actually is pretty crazy\nbecause that that happens it's weird\nyeah it is really weird yeah and it's a\nit's interesting because I feel like\nthere's such a trend that's been created\nabout asking people clickbaity Buzzy you\nknow moment questions and then you think\nwell but this is a human totally with\nemotions and ideas and Views and and I\nthink often people think oh well I've\nonly got them for 10 minutes so I better\njust ask them all this stuff but you you\nforget that\nthat there's a whole person behind that\nthe documents really humanizes you what\nparts of you did you really want people\nto understand better or see more that\nyou think they haven't been able to see\nover time just I guess where I was meant\nto be I\nin the beginning it really made me\nkind of sad I I wanted it to be a\ndocumentary that was really fun and\nabout me doing this big tour and instead\nI felt so bad because we were filming\nthese really intense moments and then I\nhad to stop filming and\nI think I really ultimately wanted\npeople to realize that I'm not really\nthat put together I I can be\nand I feel much better now but I don't\nwant people to ever look at me and think\nshe has it all and she's figured it out\nand she is you know perfect or whatever\nI hope no one thinks that but I I just\ndon't ever want to be that kind of\npublic figure I want to be someone that\nhopefully could be a friend that could\njust some D disarm you from the\ncelebrity-esque part of it I just want\nto be someone that people can\ngenuinely walk up to and say hey I kind\nof I understand what you walk through I\ndid too and have a conversation with\nyeah why is that important why do you\nthink it's important that\nI guess for a long time your people did\nconsider celebrity to be perfect or\nmaybe it was portrayed that way\nsometimes maybe it wasn't but why do you\nthink it's important for people to see\nthat no one in the world including me\nanyone we're talking about yeah there's\nno one who's perfect but why is that so\nimportant it's important to me because I\nfelt like I had to be when I was you\nknow when I was going through\nrelationships I felt like I had to be a\ncertain way that's why in 2016 I was\ntalking about\nmy body and talking about my appearance\nand and talking about how oh everyone's\ngonna see me as this Disney kid No One's\nGonna Take me seriously all of those\nmoments that's kind of where yeah that's\nwhere all the confusion came from for me\nyeah yeah no that does make sense that's\nthat's a really fascinating answer\nbecause yeah it's almost like you've had\nto live that way yeah and then you're\nkind of unpacking it for everyone and\nand breaking down that image that's\ncreated and I think that definitely\ncomes across one of the things that\nstood out to me in that unpacking of the\nPerfection element that you're talking\nabout we're so scared of imperfection\nbecause\nit reveals there's parts of us\nthat are not ideal by some external\ncomparison or\nby some\ninternal Trigger or some past experience\nwhere we we have that feeling how do you\nnow deal with your imperfections like\nhow do you feel about parts of you that\nthat are not perfect I'm okay with that\nI actually think a lot of who I am are\njust a few things that are not perfect\neven down to my laugh sometimes I used\nto be insecure about my laugh or you\nknow the fact that I'll always talk\nduring a movie or you know I always do\nsomething minuscule and\nI think little things like that\nmake me happy because\nI feel like everybody else in the world\nthey know for example a very small\nexample but if it's Halloween I was a\nbanana and I and I and I genuinely just\nlike got the cheapest outfit put it on\nand roam around Times Square with my\nfriends and have the best time and\neveryone kept sending me these memes\nbecause every everybody else kind of\nwent all out and maybe I could have\npainted my face and done a little more\nbut everyone looked really sexy and fun\nand and literally I was a banana\nthat's basically sums up who I am\num to a T and it was\num that to me means that I don't have to\nbe perfect all the time I'd rather be\nthat girl yeah and how does that apply\nto work like how does that perfectionist\nmindset work in terms of like music or\ncreation or acting like because that's\nbeautiful in your personal life it\nsounds like there's this acceptance of\nyou know we can be yeah we can be more\nin flow but then how does that apply to\nlike writing or creating or building\nlike well I think how I I don't I I well\nI always say this in any session there\nare no stupid questions I always have to\nsay that out loud because sometimes I\ngenuinely will think well what does this\nmean and how can I unpack this and\ncreate a um a song from this or how do I\nunpack this scene and do the best I can\nyou know there are mistakes that happen\nin the studio and on set that actually\nend up becoming a part of it you know me\nmessing up a line actually ended up\nbeing funny and we kept it in the show\nor you know there's something I said in\na lyric that was wrong and it ends up\nbeing the biggest hook that we've got\nand I and I look for those moments yeah\nI crave I crave those moments that's a\ngreat example I love all the those yeah\nand it just that's what feels like magic\nright like it's it's when the\nimperfection can somehow become a part\nof the process where you're just like\nwow this this this actually feels like\nwe got something and so I think when we\nstart I love that idea applied both\npersonally and professionally because\nI think even the parts of ourselves that\nwe consider to be imperfect the parts of\nourselves that we consider to be broken\nwhen you start seeing use in those when\nyou start seeing purpose in those it's I\nalways say that there's there's blessing\nin the breaking\nand every moment that you encounter in\nyour life even if it's just road rage\nit's as simple as that to maybe losing\nsomeone that you love\nthere there is no perfect way to heal\nthere's no perfect way of dealing with\nsomething it's more just\nhow am I going to be a better person how\nam I going to make the best choice for\nmyself so that I don't end up angry at\nthat person on the highway so that I\ndon't end up ruining my day because of\nwhat someone did to me on the 405. you\nknow I I want to also say that how can I\nturn something like losing someone I so\ndearly love into well how can I\ncelebrate that person and the great\nthings that they're\nupdate provided me or that they gave me\nthat takes a lot of work so I don't say\nthat lightly but I try my hardest to do\nthat and I try to have my friends hold\nme accountable to\nreminding me hey let's try to flip this\nand try to turn it into something else\nyeah yeah absolutely I think\nwhat I'm gathering from listening to you\nis that again it's you're not saying\nI've arrived and this is how I think now\nyou're saying this is what I'm trying to\npractice like this is the this is the\napproach that I'm mining in my own life\nand absolutely this is my practice every\nday is practice I I even said it last\nnight at the premiere I was saying I\ndon't I don't have anything figured out\nI'm definitely not like I'm sold I'm\ngood it's it's more just\nthis is a continuation yeah my story is\nnot done and I can't wait to find out\nwhat's going to happen next and doesn't\nmean it's going to be easy and sure\nthere's going to be bumps that happen\nbut I'm gonna learn how to live with\nthem yeah as someone who's so committed\nto moving forward what did it feel like\ngoing back to like your school and and\nall these old places I won't give away\ntoo many but in the documentary go and\nvisit\nyeah what does that do well going home\nis is like\nto me it's it's untainted territory\nright it is safe it is simple and kind\nwhere I'm from it is all about\nyou know being together loving each\nother I go home and people are like\nwelcome home miss Gomez they're not you\nknow treating me any differently and I\nenjoy and I enjoy visiting you know what\nmade me who I am and it always gives me\na good sense of of like oh I hope I can\ninspire people from where I'm from\nbecause there's not a lot to do where\nI'm from but I hope I can Inspire just\none person to do something bigger than\nthat yeah was there any particular place\nthat you went back that almost gave you\na a special feeling or or something\nsurprise you that you're like oh I\ndidn't think this was going to be yeah\nwell my snow cone place I really I loved\nthat place I would go with my dad all\nthe time and my cousin and we would get\nthe pickle snow cones with like you know\ngrape in it and it would just be so\nyummy and amazing and it just you know\nbrought me back to when it would be so\nhot in Texas and I was with my family\nand we would just stop there and sit\noutside for an hour and just talk and it\nwas just the best yeah I love that yeah\nthat's that's that's great to hear I\nthink there's always I I have this park\nin my hometown it's called Broomfield\nPark and it's it's still Charming to me\neven though I don't think if anyone else\nwent\nthere'd be like I know but when I go\nback I know where I used to go and buy\nmy my ice cream from and you know where\nthe truck would be in this there's all\nthese special moments that you\nthat almost but it sounds like again\nlike it sounds like it's not like you're\nlike oh I missed that it's almost like\nthat was a part of me and it's a\nbeautiful thing but now I'm happy to be\nnew and even today when we were just\nwalking over here and we were talking\nabout just you finding places that fuel\nyou yeah uh and you it seems like you've\nbecome open to saying okay it's okay\nthat life is changing and transitioning\nyeah and there's new places that feel\nmore like home than old places I hate\nchange I really do but I felt in the\npast year\nwhich is pretty just it's pretty new\nyeah I have really really embraced\non the uncomfortableness of change and I\nthink it's because I get so exhausted of\nthe same thing over and over again and\nit scares me but I did learn that my\nworld can be bigger by being in a\ndifferent destination I work on my show\nonly murders in the building it's in New\nYork where I shoot and I never I've\nnever spent more than a week or two in\nNew York and I'm there for months and\njust that alone was an uncomfortable you\nknow experience but I loved it and I\nloved the friendships I made and the\nknowledge that I was gaining the people\nI was around the park and walking and\njust how like Precious life is it's\ncelebrated there's culture it just\nbecomes addicting to to want to put\nyourself in these situations and see\nwhat happens so I will say in the past\nyear I've felt more comfortable with\nchange and I'm grateful for it and I\njust I'm going to continue to do that\nand I want that how did how did you get\ncomfortable with that discomfort I guess\nin the first place if you're someone who\nsaid you know like hey it changed didn't\nlike change yeah like what I guess\nobviously naturally work and everything\nlike that but yeah was there something\ninternally were you like okay now I need\nbecause you've done this you've done\nuncomfortable things your whole life\nright yeah definitely like you've had to\ndo so many difficult things whether it's\ngoing on tour when you're young or yeah\ntransitioning careers you've constantly\ndone uncomfortable things yeah but I\nthink I had always kind of returned to\nthe same behavior and the same pattern\nof maybe well I'm nervous of going out\nbecause I don't want to be seen today or\nI'm gonna just stay in because I feel\nanxious or I don't want to go out to\nthat event because I don't want to get\nseen I just I was I was finding myself\njust being terrified of the world and\nthat just isn't a way of living and it's\neasy to go do a job because well I I'm\nwith a bunch of people they help me look\ngood I do my job I smile and I'm done\nbut taking spontaneous trips or you know\ngetting out and going to the Balboa Park\nwhich is a very simple Park just doing\nthat kind of stuff is necessary and I I\nnoticed that New York really helped me\nit just really opened me up the show is\nreally great and I think\nbeing around a bunch of New Yorkers it\ndoes something to you man it's good yeah\nwell one of the biggest changes in\natmosphere that you talk about the\ndocumentaries you go to Africa right and\nthat's like a that's a big change you\nknow even if it's a shorter period of\ntime but you were still there for a\nconcert there for a week yes but I mean\nthat definitely wasn't the first time\nthat I had taken trips\num in in the in the vein of wanting to\ngo for a mission and it was one of the\nmost beautiful moments of the film for\nme because\nwe actually thought we were just going\nto make a quick little video about you\nknow what we were there to do and then\nwe fell in love with the people we fell\nin love with the story and we started\nnoticing\nthat everywhere in the world mental\nhealth is very very real it's very much\nsomething that's\naffecting everyone\num and then you kind of realize that the\nworld is\nit's it's a small place sometimes\nbecause you're all kind of walking\nthrough pain and you're all looking at\nthings in a different way but ultimately\nyou all want to be happy and\nwell I felt like they inspired me more\nthan I could have done anything for them\nit was a really beautiful trip and yeah\nit was one of my favorite moments of the\nfilm people don't always understand how\nmental health exists ever in the world\nwhen you said that they're also\nexperiencing mental health what was\ntheir experience of it compared to what\nwe would understand as our experience in\nthe US so yeah well I was I was talking\nto a woman named Betty and she was you\nknow basically kind of the person\ntouring or giving us the tour around the\nvillage and the schools and she was\nlovely but when we stopped to have a\nconversation we just were sitting down\nand she\nshe told me her story and how she was\ndealing with suicidal thoughts\nand then how she went to a lake and\nsat there for two weeks contemplating\nnot a day or an hour of moment it was\ntwo weeks\nand that was something that I felt\nfloored by because that's different\nobviously we can have those thoughts but\nshe dismissed herself from everyone and\nshe had to find it with herself when so\nmany people don't need to walk through\nthat alone but she did and she did it\nwell and she's proud of it and now she\nis in\nan incredible school and she's going to\ngrow up to be the best influence for her\nVillage for her sisters for everyone\nthat she's around that's so so special\nand I I'm just having those\nconversations with someone from across\nthe world it's mind-blowing you don't\nreally know what people are walking\nthrough until you do stop and have a\nconversation at two weeks that I can't\nimagine that feeling what you must be\nwalking through for two weeks to just be\nsitting there and did she feel the same\nfrom your deeper conversation with her\ndid she feel the same feeling that a lot\nof people do here where it's like I\ndon't know who to talk to and I don't\nknow who to open up to and who don't\nknow to trust she she thought that she\nneeded to be everything for her family\nand she felt like she was letting them\ndown same thing of not feeling good\nenough not feeling like her being there\nwould even be helpful and you do find\nthe similarities and\nin it and that's how I felt like I\nbonded with her it's incredible right\nlike cross-culture cross world to have a\nhuman moment like that with someone what\nwhat purpose of those missions played in\nyour life in terms of like you said\nthat's not the first time you've been\nout and I'm sure it's not the last as\nwell it's something that you want to\ncontinue to do I mean there was a moment\nin the documentary where you don't want\nto leave yeah I don't think I\nnecessarily will always be broadcasting\nwhen I'm taking these trips or wanting\nto do more and help and travel\nso I think that I will probably have\nthese quarterly or even just maybe once\na year I kind of have to set time apart\nfor that and I make it a priority just\nbecause I feel personally that everyone\nis my brother and sister we're all here\ntogether living being and\nyou know wanting to navigate life\ntogether and\nI want to continue to travel the world\nand and be able to spread some sort of\nmessage or bring change in some form I\ndon't know something you know I want to\nbe able to continue to always do\nsomething and eventually I do believe my\nlife will\nwill end up being something\nalong the lines of doing the things that\nyou do you know I got a few more things\nto do first but eventually yes well\nyou're already doing them you don't\nyou're already doing them and I yeah\nthere's that moment there's a moment in\nthe documentary I think you're asked\nthrough a mirror envelope question yeah\nuh what is the what is your greatest\ndream or your ultimate dream I think is\nthe word and this is exactly what you\nsay you say I want to find a way to\nchange lives and and I want to find a\nway to impact lives and I think when\npeople think of their ultimate dream\nthat's not the natural thing that comes\nto their mind right when did\nserving when did helping others become\nsuch a big understanding of this as well\nbecause it's not just I know you feel\nyou're growing from these experiences\nwhen did that become an ultimate dream\nlike when did that yeah what was your\ndream as a little girl and then you know\nhow did that evolve I think that I I was\njust I was just gonna say my mom I mean\nfrom a very young age we we didn't have\na lot but it didn't matter it was\nevery Thanksgiving we were going to you\nknow we would go and and help out in\nsoup kitchens and my mom would talk to\nme about you know why we were there and\nexplained to me The Way of the World and\nwe would you know see see really hard\nthings and Texas you know can be very\nyou know be very uh conservative and my\nmom would just break those barriers for\nme and explain to me how beautiful\npeople are and how complicated and\ncomplex things are about the world she\nnever protected me in in a way of not\nshowing me the bad things she showed me\neverything and that's what has always\nbeen a part of my life I mean down to\nI'd be on set and I'd be talking to the\ndirector and someone would come give me\na water and if my mom noticed that I\ndidn't say thank you she would just\nremind me gently in a way that was like\nHey next time be aware and be thankful\nand it's kind of like oh yeah you're\nright sorry Mom but you're right you're\nyou are you got to be aware of of people\nand you have to be aware of\nwhat people are walking through yeah I\nmean that's such right yeah yeah no and\nit's such a I think that's such a\nbeautiful message to anyone who\nis growing up with a little bit more in\nterms of anyone who's grown up even you\nknow everyone goes through so many\ndifficult things but I felt the same\nwhen I first went to India I was around\nnine years old when I first went to\nIndia and and I remember we didn't have\na lot growing up but we were still\ntraveling to India we were in a car and\nyou look out the window and and you see\nkids your age I remember you know just\nseeing tons of kids my age on the\nstreets and just it was just\nyeah it just made me aware that there\nwas a whole other world out there of\nexperience that I only learned about\nlater on yeah but I I couldn't agree\nwith you more that\nwhen you feel like you're part even a\nsmall part of the solution\nthe problem\nstarts to feel more Within Reach right\nand I feel like sometimes when we push\nthe problem away or we try and keep it\nout of sight yeah it just feels bigger\nand harder and more difficult absolutely\nignoring it is is not fun I've done that\nbefore it just you end up coping in ways\nthat you never thought that you would\nand you end up feeling disappointed\nbecause\nyou just you don't want to ever feel\nlike you're\ndoing the wrong thing I believe that\neveryone deep down knows what's right\nand what's wrong\nand when you're at your rock bottom if\nyou will because I believe that\neverybody\ndoes eventually have one of those\nmoments\nhopefully it's just going to get lighter\nand lighter because you can start to\nattack it in a way where how do I\napproach this and figure out how to get\nmyself out of this state of mind and\nI've learned how to do that in the past\nfew years and I'm really grateful for it\nit's a choice sometimes but then I also\nhate when people say that because\nsometimes they genuinely wake up in a\ndepressive state\nand I can't get out of bed but I allow\nmyself to have that day and just focus\non things that can make me feel better\ninstead of pushing it away and saying no\nit's fine I'm gonna go out I'm gonna go\ndo something I'm gonna go get my\nadrenaline up I'm gonna ignore it and\nignore it and ignore it it doesn't help\nat all yeah and it's you just said there\nthat everyone goes through a rock bottom\nMoment Like if everyone goes through\nthat in their life in different ways how\nhave you become more mindful of your\nfears and rock bottoms because I think\noften we ask people like would I look at\nyour life and I think you've gone\nthrough so many difficult things and\nyou know how do you deal with fears now\nbecause we all still have fears we all\nstill have worries but I feel like\nyou've found a way to become mindful of\nthose things and become a bit more\nprepared for them well thank you I I\nthink maybe you are seeing a good side\nof me because I have the hardest time\ndoing it I don't know my fears are\nrelatively you know they're quieter\nmaybe I should say you know like for\nexample this documentary coming out I am\nstill nervous I'm nervous for the\nreaction\num even though I know that I have good\nintentions behind it\nI think that I just have to understand\nthat my fears are only going to continue\nto\nshow me what I'm capable of the more\nthat I face my fears the more that I\nfeel I'm gaining strength I'm gaining\nwisdom and I just want to keep doing\nthat and I just hope to get better hope\nto get smarter I hope to become stronger\nand be a great person yeah that's I mean\nthat's a phenomenal answer and it's yeah\nI don't think I'm seeing the I don't\nthink it's a good side of you Celine I\nthink I'm I'm like what are you I guess\nso I think uh you know I\nI don't think it's a good site because I\ndon't believe you have a bad side and\nand but I but I think it's a\nit's your truth that we're seeing you\nknow it's it's this it's the uh it's the\nessence of us yeah that I'm trying to\nsee in you and myself and my anyone\naround me anyone I meet whoever you bump\ninto it's like when you see someone's\nEssence that Essence is pure and is\ngenuine it is like strong and powerful\nand capable and it's the everything else\nis not a side of us it's just stuff that\ncovers us up right right like doesn't it\nfeel that way like you're absolutely\nright yeah like I feel like I don't have\na we don't have a I don't have a side of\nme that I don't like I have stuff that's\ncovering over who I really am exactly\nand it's out of how do you navigate\ncontrolling those things and taking\ncontrol of your yourself yeah yeah and I\nlove what you just said about how\nconfronting your fears is what gives you\na sense of confidence and strength\nbecause when you get through something\ntough it does it feels incredible I mean\nwalking through all of those moments\nthat I'm you know sharing with everybody\nelse\nit is really great I mean it's so sad to\nwatch but I would not be who I am of\ncourse it's such a cliche if it wasn't\nfor that but facing your fears and and\ntackling them it's the only way to get\nthrough them I feel yeah you said\nintention is so important there and I\nthink that anyone who's in the public\neye sometimes all you have is your\nintention because you can't control\nanything else yeah what role is\nintention played in your life and then\nwith this work more clearly\nwhat is your intention for everyone\nwho's going to watch it like what is\nyour\nhope and wish for the different people\nthat will see it but first of all what\nrole is intention played in your life\nespecially as things have continue to\ngrow you know I I think maybe in the\npast five years\nI I felt like\nprojects I was a part of even\nendorsements something like that\nthe intention behind me being a part of\nanything needed to be good\nI if I did if I got a lot of money I'm\njust being super transparent from doing\nthis line for a T-shirt and I've been\njust making this up\nthere's a huge part of me that actually\nfeels uncomfortable with the whole idea\nand that's just me I I have to think\nokay this is thank you but I need to\nfigure out how this is also not going to\nbe just about me it's going to be about\neveryone that's involved in this how can\nI turn it into hey we're gonna do some\npercentages to this and this is how\nwe're gonna do the deal I then feel more\ncomfortable stepping into a situation\nand accepting it but I've never based my\ndecisions on what will get me to the top\nquicker what will\nwhat will um make me number one what\nwill I break records all of those things\nto me are just bonuses they're just\ngreat if it happens it happens that way\nbut that's never been my intention and\nsome people in my position would think\nthat's kind of stupid you know it's it's\nthe whole point of doing it is to break\nthese records is to do all that stuff\nbut for me and I think the reason why I\nam who I am is because just enough is\nwhat I am\nI think that I just want to be enough\nand that doesn't have to be me killing\nmyself trying to be number one on\nsomething\num or striving to be number one for\nsomething it it's exhausting yeah how do\nyou define being just enough now like\nwhat is what has that evolved and I'm\nsure it would change and I'm sure bro\nbut right now what is that I feel you\nknow I feel I feel open I feel ready for\nrelationships and\nchange\num I will be shooting season three so\nI'll be in New York for quite a bit and\nI can't wait to see what will happen and\nall the people I'll meet and all the\npeople I get to spend time with again\nlike Stephen Marty and it'll be fun yeah\nI love that well Selena this has been\nsuch a beautiful conversation and the\ngood thing is we don't have to end it\nhere but we get to invite we get a very\nspecial guest he's joining us today a\nvery special gift for my audience here\nand and our community and everyone who's\nlistening and watching we get to have\nyour mom on the show which is amazing\nit's really fun so I am so excited about\nthis because to be able to talk to you\nboth about the incredible work you're\ndoing together\nher incredible lessons that she shared\nwith you over time that you spoke about\nso beautifully today and I got to talk\nto her before we started recording as\nwell and just hearing about how\nInnovative and creative she is yeah I\nmean it's amazing so if you're okay with\nthat I'd love to I would love it bring\nout your moms please Mandy over in a\nsecond so we will go and grab her yeah\namazing\nso we're so excited to have you here\nManny this is amazing this is really\nspecial when when I heard that I was\ngoing to have this opportunity I I think\nit's always interesting hearing about\nsomeone's journey through someone else's\nlens especially your mom like you know\nwho else in the world and now now my\nmom's gonna be upset that I haven't had\nher on the book I've never had German I\nhaven't so now now I feel the pressure\nmake my podcast I'll just make one there\nwe go and have her on there I love it\nbut I was gonna say you know it was just\nso beautiful\nuh in the documentary and even just now\nhearing what Selena had to say about the\namazing impact you've had on her hearing\nabout you going to the soup kitchens\nwhen Selena was younger uh in the\ndocumentary as I said before hearing\nabout how he always encourage her to\nlearn about things that scared her yeah\nand and that would help her I mean these\nare really I hope you feel extremely\nproud of this incredible human being and\njust\nyou know from an outsider's point of\nview just how incredible it is to see\nsomeone sharing their truth with so much\nbravery so much courage and impacting\nthe lives and saving the lives of\nmillions of people across the world and\nand I'm sure you feel a big part of that\nsir I mean honestly I I always hope to\nbe a role model as in the sense that I\nwas honest about everything with her and\nand who I was and as a person because I\nfeel like sometimes if parents project\na Perfection then their kids feel like\nthey have to like live up to that or or\nachieve more you know and I I just\nwanted her to always know I'm a person\nI'm gonna mess up and at I was 16. so I\nwas even more of a lost person so I'm\nkind of surprised she came out as great\nas she did\nbut yes I'm very proud of her and\num you know I played a little role in it\nand then she's like navigated herself\ninto a wonderful adult and there's been\nups and downs but it's just been um it's\nbeen an honor to be her mother what is\nwhat does that feel like I mean that's a\nwhole another experience having a child\nat 16. I mean that's that that's a very\nyou know challenging stressful thing for\nyourself to go through you're obviously\nnot mentally in a space to be raising a\nchild because you are a child and you're\ntrying to figure out\num who you are and even in some of my\nreally hard times I feel Selena came\ninto this world at the perfect time\nbecause I was really lost myself and I\nwasn't going down the right path and\nthen when I found out I was pregnant I\nwas like oh I have someone who's going\ntoday I'm responsible for and they're\ngonna look up to me for guidance and\neven at a young age that hit me and I'm\nthankful that that hit me and that I\ndealt it I did allow that pressure to\nmake sure that I was trying to do\neverything right for her but that was a\nmoment that when you're 16 in that phase\nyou're trying to figure out your path in\nlife and I think I kind of lost a little\npath of my life because I had something\nmore important and to to like take over\nand I think that the delay adolescence\nis something that\num I felt like even now you know I still\nfeel like I'm a little bit youthful even\nthough I'm like creaking and popping\nwhen I walk you know I I still sometimes\nfeel like I have a little bit more\nAdolescence in me and still things to\nlearn and so as as a teen it was um it\nwas really challenging and it was really\none of those beautiful like vortexes of\nof\nbeing young and being able to keep up\nwith a child and having that energy so I\nwas able to go to school I went to a\nconservatory after so I would take her\nto school and when she started\nkindergarten and then I would go to\nschool and then I would go to work and\nthen I'd come home and do her homework\nand put her to bed then do my homework\nand do it all over and I think about\nthat now and I'm like no way\nno way I'm like I have a hard time\ngetting up for my my little one now so I\nwas like I was way too young then then\nI'm like way too old\nno but you know what I mean it was just\nlike where was The Sweet Spot I just\nkind of skimmed by it and you know\naccepted the challenge no that's\nincredible moms are amazing I know how\nmoms do it Mom's across the world my mom\nincluded just yeah unbelievable\nresilience and unbelievable found\ntolerance and you know that I mean that\nsounds like\nsuch an incredible journey and you know\nas you were telling me earlier you\nhaven't yet managed to watch the\ndocumentary right I've seen Parts but\nyou haven't been able to bring yourself\nto actually watch it tell us about what\nthat feels like and how hard that is\nwell first everyone's telling me how\nfabulous it is so it's like making me\nit's making me more and more eager to\nkind of put that guard down but the\nreason why is because like we lived some\nof that together we've went through that\nand we've found healing and we've moved\npast some of it and even if it's um\nsomething that she went through and I\ndidn't know she went through it it's as\na mother it's gonna affect me of like oh\nit's gonna hurt my stomach it's gonna\nput me in that mindset and I I'm gonna\nwish I could go and protect her and she\nyou know she was amazing and came\nthrough so much that I already feel like\nI protect you a lot yeah and I I was\nlike maybe I could just get through the\nholidays to not where I'm going up to\nher all the time going I'm sorry I\ndidn't know you know because mothers do\nlike you know you want to take away your\nkid's pain you don't want them to have\nto experience that even though that is\npart of developing who they're going to\nbe and you know who we all are is our\npain and our suffering and our growth so\nit's like I I either I'm gonna have to\nbe in that mood where it's that time\nwhere I'm just like I'm not getting out\nof bed today and I already know I'm\ngoing to be a little funky\num and then watch it and then just be\nalone and kind of cry and then call her\nand tell her I'm sorry that I wasn't\nthere in that moment but you know it you\njust can't helicopter parent so it just\nit just feels\nall right like her first breakup she\never had I cried yeah I was like oh\nenough to like the movies\nlike they didn't make it\nI love it so mum's hot though that's a\nmom's Heart Like unless you're a mom you\ncan't you don't you know talk to it it's\nhard to fully understand like yeah just\neverything you just said there of like\nwow look we've already lived through\nthat we've healed through that to\nrevisit that again that's painful to\nfeel a sense of guilt that I wasn't\nthere for someone in a certain way I\ndidn't know what they were going through\nthat carries a single I mean Selena\nhearing that from your mom like what\ndoes it feel like when she's like she\nhasn't been able to watch it because of\nall of this how does that feel well it's\nit's not far off I've only seen it twice\nwow\num and I I've premiered it a few times\nfor people and I've stepped away from\nwatching it I think I relate to my mom\nbecause\nsome of those moments were really hard\nand it's not so much if you don't mind\nme like saying this it's not you not\nbeing there it was me not\nletting you be there that was the\nhardest part and it was also not letting\nmost of my my people like my family in\nbecause I was in so much pain and I was\nwalking through all these things and\nand in a way I am glad that I walked\nthrough some of it alone because it made\nme who I am but at the same time it\nbreaks my heart to know that I had to\nwalk through that when I didn't need to\ndo it alone\num so it's very much\nit's I relate to her I understand why\nshe feels that way for sure and I get it\nso\nyeah it's wonderful hearing both your\nperspectives on it because I think it\nagain just just you being him Andy and\nI'm so grateful that you genuinely are\nhere because it\nit just grounds us back into we're not\nwatching a TV show right like I think\nAlec did such a great job with it\nbecause I I even though I'm not feeling\nhis mother it's like I I can feel what\nyou're saying through the way the\nstory's told but I think often when we\nwatch things like this we're like oh\nyeah that's a TV show it's not someone's\nlife and then when I'm sitting all of a\nsudden with you I'm like oh no no but\nthis is real life like this is someone's\nactual life and emotions and that you\nknow that\nhaving your voice in this conversation\nis so useful for that well I mean I look\nat at like kind of go when we're going\nto\num the premiere last night I I had a\nmoment before where I was crying I'm\nlike I'm gonna need to cry and just get\nit over with even though I was just\nthere to support her and I didn't watch\nthe film\num the power and the fear which I always\ncall fear the false existence appear in\nreal and so like the fear is like\neveryone is seeing you in your darkest\nmoment\nand that it's out there for the world to\njudge and and they will judge it however\nthey will because even you know again\nnot seeing the documentary I hear it's\nvery real and raw and honest and open to\ndo something like that it's it's for me\nI cry out of fear of like how you were\nfeeling and like how I could protect you\nand then I was like I know that the\nlittle bit I did in in the the interview\nI was down a week afterwards because it\ndid put me back in that place even\nthough we weren't there and I I blacked\nout the minute you know Alex said action\nand he was so nice about it and um my\nlovely friend dear friend Emily who does\nmy hair and makeup she was like she was\nlike they're going because she was all\ncrying and then she's like I didn't know\nI'm like well now everyone's gonna know\nand there's something beautiful to that\nbecause it's\nyou're exposing a lot and that can be\nfearful but you're also giving a lot if\nthat's how you look at it and so I think\nit can make those dark moments really\nbeautiful yeah yeah well I think that's\nsomething you as a family\nseem to have definitely embodied the\nidea of\nusing your pain to serve others figuring\nout a way to make sure that these\nstories are not just told in silos but\nthey help other people feel connected\nand you know with what you're doing with\nWonder mind like tell us a bit about the\nmission behind why you founded them why\nyou brought that to life because I feel\nit comes from the same place of like\nwe're going through these things\npersonally but we also know this is a\ncollective Global Challenge and so we\nwant to be a part of supporting those\ncommunities when I was really young uh\nand I was about seven years old I did\nhave my first and only suicide\nattempt wow however you say it and it it\nit didn't happen seven years old and I\nthink that traces back the time of\nalways not feeling like I like nothing\naround me made sense in my world and it\nwas just like I felt like I was and you\nknow nothing bad was happening it's just\nlike this seems wrong to me this seems\nwrong to me I seem wrong like how how do\nI fix this but from that moment I've\nalways carried I think that moment in my\nlife in my mind of like not wanting\nanyone to ever feel that way which is\nwhat led us to 13 Reasons Why and some\nof her fans opening up to us when I read\nthat I knew that needed to be a\nconversational piece and from the\nresponse of what it it did and opening\nthose conversations I inspired me to do\nmore but it was like about the timing of\nwhat what we wanted to do and how we're\ngoing to use it and so\ncollaborating and and figuring out\nwhat's missing out there uh as a support\nsystem was the ecosystem that we're\nwe're you know planning and working\ntirelessly to create where all of it is\ncohesive and you have one place to go to\nsee that you know we actually Target it\nreally a filter of fillings so everybody\nhas feelings that might not be a\ndiagnosed medical condition but also how\ncan we put out content every day that\nyou know keeps it light but keeps it\nreal and keeps it open for conversation\nand build a community where everyone\nwill feel safe and not ashamed of like a\nfeeling that they're having and not\nashamed\num I heard you guys talking about\nperfection it's like I I I don't like to\npretend there is perfection you know I I\nlike I think Perfection kind of puts a\nlittle bit of\npressure whenever you can just be like\njust be and like so I you know I'm not a\nbig social media fan but um definitely\ngo to wonder mine where we share\npositive messages but um I think what\nyou know inspired me was creating this\nfor everyone and content for people to\nhave access to that can't afford to get\ntreatment or don't need treatment but\nthey need someone to say hey check this\nout you know so it's really for\neverybody yeah thank you so much for\nsharing your personal experience though\nbecause I can imagine that\nyou know the fact that you've held that\nclose to you for this long and now\nthat's coming out in this beautiful way\nbut when you're holding on to it it\ndoesn't feel that\nbeautiful always I mean Selena how old\nwere you when you first learned about\nyour mind I don't think and this is\nprobably fair enough to say like she she\nnever really hid a lot of stuff\num when I was younger I never was aware\nthat we didn't have enough I was never\nshe did such a great job of I feel weird\ntalking about you were under right here\nbut you did Mama you did of of being\nwho's this woman you speak of\num I have like explaining situations to\nme that we would be in and\num and I feel around 18 I kind of\nstarted to realize more of her story and\nobviously it broke my heart and there\nare things that I never knew were going\non and she did such a great job of just\nletting me have\na really great childhood and\num then once I realized we could be open\nand honest with each other that's kind\nof how wondermind started as well we we\nreally you know ended up working\ntogether on an interview and we we\nshared such interest with you know the\nperson I was interviewing with us and we\nthought hey this is something we could\nprobably do together and it happened\nthat way and it was it's been really fun\nI I do want to I know this is like a\nLove Fest but like I do want to there's\na moment that um like you touched me\nduring that time that I don't even know\nif you remember I remember I was doing\nthat going to school going to work\ntrying to get her out of the the\nneighborhood I grew up in and try to\ngive her a better life and this was\npre-her doing anything besides directing\nfilms with kids on the street yep but\nshe he wasn't doing anything\nprofessionally I was sitting in front of\na mirror and I was trying to get ready\nand I just started crying I was crying I\nwas crying and she come up behind me and\nshe was so young and she like started\nplaying with my hair and and she's like\nwhat's wrong and I said I just don't\nknow why I'm doing what I'm doing and\nshe goes you'll figure it out just keep\ngoing and it was like I was like she's\nalready smarter than me\nso yeah it's like it was like a really\ngood like strong moment like you don't\never want to you know I I think being\nvulnerable in front of her allows you\nknow the vulnerability to you know be\nwelcomed yeah absolutely yeah I think\nthat's I think that's so true as we're\ngrowing up it's like we often look at\nour parents as perfect unless they let\nus in yeah or by the time you figure out\nthat they're not and and it's\ninteresting that you're saying that\nat least you thought you were just\nalways open and honest with what you\nwere going through and\nwith with your own challenges and your\nown struggles when you're when you're\ngoing through your own stuff and you're\nwatching your child go through their\nstuff like\nwhat's going through a mother's mind in\nthat situation like how are you dealing\nwith your own stresses and pains and\ntrying to be there and often as as\nSelena said and you said\nchildren don't want their parents\ninvolved at a certain time right like I\ncan relate to that completely like I\nthink you know I listen to everything my\nparents said up until I I was 13 years\nold and then from like 13 to 25 I didn't\nwant to hear from them and then after 25\nI was like oh you guys were the best\nyeah yeah you're right but everything\nand you go through that Journey so you\nknow when when your child doesn't want\nyour help when when your child is not\nallowing you in like what goes through a\nparent's mind especially when they're\ngoing through their own work themselves\nI just needed more therapy and and a\nfeeling\num and if you feel\nbecause\nI I want to use this term lightly like\nyou feel like you failed in some\ncapacity so then you're like I know I\ntook that opportunity to try to see\nmaybe where were the missteps I took as\na parent was I too open with her was I\ntoo liberal with her or you know should\nI not let her do Barney you know like\nit's just all these decisions that that\nyou know\nwhat you make you just reflect on and I\nthink\nI think um as parents we have\num this capacity to decompartmentalize\nyour feelings and then prioritizing\neveryone else's like I was telling you\nearlier when we were we were talking it\nwas it's easier to bury your stuff and\nthen kind of focus which then becomes\nunhealthy for the receiving party and\nfor yourself because you're not taking\ncare of yourself so\num I I was I went through it\num a lot of days didn't get out of bed\nthere was just like a lot of crying a\nlot of therapy and I had a therapist\nbecause I also I had a miscarriage\nduring the madness and you know I had\nthis therapist who gave me the best\nadvice ever she's like just I need you\nto leave your house once a day and go go\nto the movies buy a ticket I don't care\nif you watch it but every day you need\nreceipts that you left your house and so\nI would like walk through the mall just\nlike crying being lost and you know not\nknowing what to do and I would buy stuff\nand I'd have to go and take it to her in\neach session and I didn't I didn't even\nask her the purpose I was like she's\njust trying to get me to get out of the\nhouse and\num then I realized the whole like after\nabout six weeks of doing that I started\nfeeling more comfortable with being even\nmore vulnerable because I'm crying and I\nknow the world's gonna be okay and\nnobody's judging me people are asking me\nhey are you okay that kind of thing and\nyou know I'm just like no and then you\nknow you just keep walking but like that\njudgment that everybody's afraid of it\nshowed me that you know because I was\nmad that I failed as a mother and this\nis in my eyes not like you you know like\nI felt as Selena's mother and then I\nalso my body hurt my other baby so I was\nlike angry at myself completely and I\nneeded to see that oh the world's alive\nand there is forgiveness and I can still\nfind happiness for myself because I was\njust like being a mom with something and\nthe only thing I really knew to do since\nthe age of 15. so when that's gone\nyou're you're just like oh\nI'm supposed to have hobbies\nthat don't even tell my child I'm\nsupposed to do things you know so it was\num a lot of growing you know and\nit's hard when you're in it but when you\nget out of it it's fantastic it really\nis it's just you feel lighter and you\nfeel like more hopeful you know and that\nthen when you have that next opportunity\nor that next you know downtrodden moment\nyou know you're gonna get out of it it's\nlike all right I just gotta get through\nthis just gotta figure it out gotta Vibe\nthrough it and and then it'll it will\npass yeah so I think yeah you were\ntalking about Rock Bottom a little bit\nearlier yeah definitely hitting rock\nbottom it does it feels like you're\nbreaking through what's really\nrefreshing hearing both of you together\nis just I feel like this is gonna heal a\nlot of parent children relationships\nlike listening to you both today because\nI'm just thinking so often we think our\nthoughts to ourselves and we never share\nthem with the people that those thoughts\nare about yeah so you know I'm sure\nthere's so many children out there who\ntheir thoughts are like I wish my\nparents did this better and my parents\ncould have done this and those are valid\nthoughts and then there's parents out\nthere at the same time having the same\nthought of like I wish I didn't do that\nto them and I would you know and often\nwe just never find out we never know\nbecause we don't get to have these open\nhonest dialogues and so I really think\nthis on top of everything this is really\ngoing to inspire a lot of parents yeah\nit's because it's even even listening to\nyou I'm just I'm thinking of my parents\nand I'm thinking of my friend's parents\nand I'm thinking\nthat everyone needs to be able to open\ntheir heart because somewhere everyone's\npainting themselves the villain and\nsomeone's painting themselves as the\nperson who messed up and got everything\nwrong yeah and in our head we're\nthinking oh they got away with it or you\nknow they don't they're not aware of it\nso\nI find I mean did you were you always\nopen to therapy and always open to this\nself-work was that a part of who you\nwere as well always and that was or was\nthere something you kind of turned to at\na certain well I will tell you a\nhaunting little secret that\num when I was really young in junior\nhigh I wanted to be a criminal\npsychologist so\num that's why I always say that she's\nmaking fun of me in murders maybe that's\nthat one day I'm that person but um I I\nwas already reading on serial killers at\nthat age because I was fascinated with\nthe the mind and I didn't come from you\nknow an environment where therapy was\neven talked about but I just at a\ncertain age I really felt like super\ndepressed and so I had to go out and\nexplore it myself and go through tons of\ndoctors and you know you would say one\nthing and it was just like they go hey\nare you seeing things I'm like I saw a\nblack butterfly the other day and they\ngo oh so you're hallucinating and I'm\nlike am I so like I had to go and I\nwasn't but it was a real black butterfly\nso they I had to learn like how to\nunderstand myself and and my mind\num on my own and\num finally I also I I did I went away to\na facility and it was the first time I\ngot to really spend all that time it was\nbest uh 28 days that I I've spent and\nyou know on myself and\num yeah you just like you have to kind\nof build that relationship with your\nmind and and I think people are so\nafraid of being honest with themselves\nbecause then they have to face it but\nwhat like helped me is I realized like\nyou know in this relationship I was\nparenting her the way I needed to be\nparented not what she was needing and\nthat is how I feel like I made my\ncontribution to Healing this\nrelationship was like okay pull back I\nneed to know her and her needs not like\nbe the mama bear even though I still\nhaven't lost that completely but like\nyou know sometimes I just need to listen\nand not fix it and and so that was the\nbiggest thing I think\num I really went on a little tell spin\nthere but like that was the biggest\nthing that I I learned through you know\nthat whole time that we were separated\nit was like seeing who I was and how\nother people see me and I do that every\nday I'll say something I'm like okay how\ndid that come off to someone else you\nknow because I have ADHD so I'm quick to\nlike spurt out whatever's in my brain\nand then like they really didn't need to\nknow that\nbut it's out there in the world now the\nself the self work in this room is\nthe amount of like self-reflection and\nself-awareness in this room is really\nstrong this is yeah this is yeah this is\nvery powerful stuff no and and you did\nnot get lost on a tangential I I think\neverything you just shared with us even\nyou just coming to that conclusion of\nknowing that you're parenting someone\nthat you deeply love in a way that you\nwanted to be parented I think that is at\nthe core of so much of how we all live\nyeah right we're all loving people the\nway we wish we were loved and we're all\nhurting people the way we wish we\nweren't hurt and it's it's so\nit's it's just fascinating when we\nfinally you know look beneath the\nsurface and uncover why it's all there\nand yeah where it is and to do that\ntogether and separately I love this idea\nthat there were times when you had to do\nthis at a distance from each other as\nwell I think that's such a healthy\nmessage\nto be out there as well in the world I\nthink we're often all trying to solve\nall our issues in the same place yeah\ndefinitely I think there are moments\neven you know even in friendships where\nit wasn't necessary for me to take a\nstep back and\num figure out what is serving me what's\nnot serving me what makes me happy\nwhat's challenging me what's helping me\nmove forward versus what's not I think\nit's really important I think when we're\nlooking from the outside in we we limit\npeople to\ncertain experiences we remember them for\ncertain people we expect them to be with\npeople that they're meant to be around\nthe way\nfamilies are meant to be like there's\nall these meant to be yeah and and then\nit's like well no in reality there's\nspace there's distance there's\nreflection there's there's the need for\nall of these things with with the work\nthat you're talking about earlier with\nme as well in terms of how you're now\ntaking these messages on screen yeah you\nknow which you're sharing which I know\nis such a big part of the work and I I\nfeel so excited about that like that\nfills me with the greatest amount of Joy\nknowing that we're going to see better\nrepresentation of mental health on\nscreen I think that's that's huge uh\nwhere did you start to realize that from\n13 Reasons Why as we spoke about earlier\nlike where did you start to realize that\nwas so important for people to see that\nrepresentation on screen well I think it\ncomes back to not wanting people to feel\nlike I did at seven years old it's like\nI'm so open like with you know oh I'm\nbipolar or that I have ADHD you know I\nwas misdiagnosed for a while so like I\nwas always so open with it and you know\neven in a town where they're so\naccepting in certain capacities it it's\nstill like well she she's not stable and\nI even would joke and go yeah I'm crazy\nI'm crazy I'm crazy and and I was like\nnot supporting myself in that and I\ndidn't want anybody to feel that way so\nyou know during 13 reasons why we worked\ntirelessly the entire team to make sure\nwe were executing the the whole point of\nit and that you know we're losing teens\nevery day to suicide and it's it's\nhorrible and unnecessary and you know\nhow do we how can we as adults and\nthat's why it was so important I think\nfor me and Selena to go out and talk\nabout it so parents would watch it\ntogether you know and once that got the\nreaction it got you know I heard\ndifferent opinions and I wanted to hear\neveryone whether they thought it was a\nbad idea a great idea it touched them it\noffended them like I really like\nlistened to everything and all the you\nknow data and I've always been someone\nwho enjoyed storytelling and so I I like\nto tell stories and if I can you know\nshow and like I was telling you earlier\nI like using Silver Linings Playbook\nbecause they're bipolar but they're\nhaving a life they're having a\nrelationship and as it may come with\nchallenges every relationship comes with\nchallenges it's not just mental mental\nissue that someone has that causes those\nchallenges we're all people and if we\njust learn to understand each other\nthere'll be less fear of it and then\npeople will get more treatment and\nthey'll just be more happiness and I\nknow sometimes I feel like I'm being\nlike the world's gonna be happy you know\nkind of like that but you know and again\nlike my adolescence that's still there\nbut I I that's what inspires me is to\num I scared off people by talking about\nmyself in a negative way and by you know\nnot sharing enough so it's like or\nsharing too much so then it's like\nnavigating that and like you know like I\nI mentioned like one who Flew Over the\nCuckoo's Nest and growing erupted\nfavorite films loved them but that's not\nthe reality Selena or I live in every\nday you know I have been in a facility\nand but it was not like\nwhat's being portrayed it was it was a\nbeautiful experience and and made me a\nbetter person for it so it just like\nmedia loves to you know tell all of the\nbad stuff it's like we could use it as\nas like educational without preaching\nand so like let's just tell stories of\nreal people dealing with mental health\nissues in different capacities and show\nthat you can that you're all right\nyou're gonna make it it's like and you\njust need to give yourself\nthat that permission and then once you\ngive yourself that permission you're\ngonna come out a happier person I like I\nembrace my ADHD like I really do yeah we\nhave a lot of fun together\nwell I think this is painting a\nbeautiful picture of just how like we\nalways want growth to be this perfect\nline right you know we expect expect\ngrowth in families individually to just\nlook like oh we're just all growing at\nthe same time and isn't this beautiful\nand it's like well no growth is not that\nway yeah and growth is being patient\nwhen my daughter wants to grow this way\nand yeah I'm trying to figure this out\nor I'm going to be patient while my mom\npivots and shifts and that's what growth\nis growth is being patient with each\nother and growth is holding space and\nbeing okay when we're not being the\nnicest people to each other absolutely\nthere's so much more to growth and so I\nwant to thank you both for displaying\nthen sharing that with us today no thank\nyou because it's uh yeah it's it's\nspecial seeing it from this perspective\nfor sure\num rather than either or I we we end\nevery on-purpose episode with a final\nfive which I'm gonna ask to both of you\nokay um so you'll do one question at a\ntime each okay uh and these are one word\nto one sentence maximum great um they\nare not questions like what's your\nfavorite color okay uh they're all\nthoughtful questions okay as you would\nexpect okay so uh question number one is\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived or heard when it comes to\nMental Health I'm sure it's like in a\nbrene brown book man I'm feeling great\nright on my wrist yeah I think though\nthe best advice that had been given is\nis probably what I have thoroughly said\nthroughout my documentary and speaking\nwith you is is learning how to make it\na part of your life like that's why I\nsay make it your friend because I think\nyou have to understand why and\nsometimes you may not always know why\nbut if you can understand that it's a\nfeeling like my mom said where maybe\nthis will pass and and maybe you just\ngotta go through it and you have to have\nthe day in bed crying you have to do\nthose things in order to figure out\nwhat it is that's going to set you free\nfrom it\num maybe that would be my advice make\nyou a practice Yeah\num I think mine was uh take your time\nthat was what I was told when I went to\nthat's true yeah take your time it's\nreally good yeah yeah what's some of the\nsecond question what's some of the worst\nadvice you've ever heard or received\nwhen it comes to mental health that it's\nall in my head and I can just control it\nlike stop having bad thoughts yeah yeah\nI was gonna say somewhere along the\nlines of like\nyou're fine\nI mean yeah I had someone say to me\nliterally like you're so dramatic you\nmake up everything you know that was so\nhurtful the worst I felt in the worst\ncalmed down\nit's like has that ever worked\nall right question number three how\nwould you both Define your individually\nyour current purpose in life I fully\nfeel that I am exactly where I'm meant\nto be I am meant to share my story and\nin this season of my life I want to be\nloved the way I love people I want to\ngive the way people live so generously\ngiven to me and I want to continue to\nwork on become a becoming a better and a\nhappier person every day it's a\nbeautiful purpose I've received so now I\nwant to give oh wow this is this is\nreally beautiful answers our question\nnumber four uh what's something you used\nto value that you don't value that much\nanymore oh people's opinions\nI agree it's so exhausting I I would say\nit is nice to hear great things but I I\naccept\ncompliments in a in a manner where I can\nappreciate them but I\nI have to learn how to just know that\nI gotta keep a straight head I gotta\nlike understand that everything is a\ngift and not to let things get to my\nhead yeah because I always say\num\nif you accept all the compliments in\ninternally then you'll have to accept\nall the negative so\njust be careful just like be selective\nwith what you let in yeah yeah yeah\nthere's a beautiful quote I can't\nremember who said it but it says uh\nuh don't let compliments get to your\nhead and criticism get to your heart\nyeah I love that yeah I love that that\nwas very poetic with what yeah I was\ntrying to say it's been said Thank you\nthank you for just repeating it no no\nbut I think it's such a beautiful yeah\nit is and yeah and and I think that's\nalso when we're mindful of giving\ncompliments to others\nI think something that I've learned is\nthat I I enjoy and we've talked about\nthis today I I really enjoyed the art of\nlearning to see someone's Essence it's\nsomething that I try and live by because\nand then when you want to compliment\nsomeone it's like how do you give a\ncompliment that is an empty flattery or\nthat isn't just surface level and I\nthink when we get compliments like that\nthey don't go to our head they do go to\nour heart yeah you know it's different\nso I hope that we can also learn to\ncomplement each other and more yeah you\nknow beautiful and genuine ways Fifth\nand final question question number five\nis if you could create one law that\neveryone in the world had to follow what\nwould it be\npracticing forgiveness wow I I probably\nwould would say something super simple\nand cheesy but treat others the way you\nwant to be treated yeah and then we\nthrow in the Forgiveness yeah and\nhonestly that's the biggest thing yeah\nforgiveness yeah yeah I say we can't\npaint all right let's do it Mom\nforgiveness Cafe that's right wait can I\nask you a question yeah okay when is the\nlast time you did something for the\nfirst time oh wow where did that come\nfrom okay when was the last time I've\nbeen practicing this time\nthen the most interesting answer that\ncame to mind straight away even though\nit was a couple of months ago now I went\ntrekking with gorillas in Rwanda wow and\nit was that it was amazing it was yeah\nit was a few months ago and it was\nthe most\nincredible experience that sounds like\nwild yeah so they're mountain gorilla\nand they're not you don't they don't\nhave any technology on them or you know\nthey're not treated a certain way\nthey're not in a zoo or they're not\ntrapped you're in their home and you\nhave to set out early in the morning to\ngo and look for them and the people that\nare doing these tours they know where\nthey usually are so they take you in\nthat direction oh my God then you\nfinally discover like this family of\ngorillas and I thought I'd see one or\ntwo I was very I wasn't skeptical but I\nwas kind of like yeah who knows you know\nright we saw 18 gorillas like a family\nso no so you know I wish\nthey cuddle each other oh yeah but they\ndon't they the guides tell us that the\nonly thing you have to do is maintain\nyour distance you're not allowed to try\nand touch them or their kids because\nthey see that as violent but the\ngorillas are just so peaceful and\nthey're so calm and they have this sound\nthat they make this is my favorite part\nof the experience so we were told by our\nguide that if you make this sound it\nbasically tells the gorillas we come in\npeace and so this sound is\nso you have to make that sound and the\ngorillas make it back to you\nor they'll do it to you as they come\ncloser just to let you know hey we're\nnot trying to harm you we're just going\nto walk past you I love that it is\nreally special so that was the most\nrecent memory of something well that's a\nhell of a one I know I was like yeah\nhe's like yeah\nthat was beautiful yeah it was really it\nwas really truly special it was uh you\nknow it's just being with another\ncreature\nthat another form of life that is\nuninterested in you yeah it's it's very\nhumbling in a good way yeah yeah this\nform of life doesn't even care that I\nexists\ntaking pictures and the girl is just\nlike yeah whatever yeah I'm like okay\nthat's a good question I guess that's a\ngood question well Selena Amanda you\nhave both been so gracious with your\ntime today you've been so kind and\ngenerous with your energy and this\ndocumentary is going to change so many\nlives and it is going to
