vulnerability you\ngotta let go of those defenses such as\nthe best-selling author and host the\nnumber one Health and Wellness podcast\non purpose with Jay Shetty\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou that come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now I know that if you're\nlistening right now you're here because\nyou want to improve your mental\nemotional physical and spiritual\nwell-being I know that you're trying to\nheal from trauma from stress from\npressure you're trying to heal\nchallenges you

not just his\nonly time on the show I hope this starts\nto become a regular guest on the show\nI'm talking about none other than Dr\nGabor mate who's a cell rated speaker\nand best-selling author he's highly\nsought after for his expertise on a\nrange of topics such as addiction stress\nand childhood development Dr mate has\nwritten several best-selling books\nincluding the award-winning in the realm\nof hungry ghosts close encounters with\naddiction when the body says no the cost\nof hidden stress and Scattered Minds the\norigins and healing of attention deficit\ndisorder now today we're talking about\nhis new book called The Myth of normal\ntrauma illness and healing in a toxic\nculture and we have the link to this in\nthe notes I want you to go and order\nthis book right now it is going to blow\nyour mind the insights of this\nindividual about what we're going\nthrough as a culture and a society are\ngoing to be really powerful so the book\nis called the myth of normal trauma\nillness and healing in a toxic culture\nplease welcome to the show Dr Gabor mate\nthank you so much for being here\npleasure to be here thank you I love\nsitting down with people\nwho are deeply immersed and obsessed\nwith ideas\nand observing human behavior I\nadmire Obsession deeply in admiration\ndeeply and I admire\nthe ability to sit with something for a\nlong enough time but I want to start off\nBroad and I want to move in deeper\nand I think this is a question that me\nand my friends often talk about I think\nwe hear the word trauma more often these\ndays yes it's thrown around sometimes\nsometimes it's used effectively\nsometimes it's used in conversation\naround things that some people would\nperceive as small and insignificant\nsometimes it's used to describe\nlife-defining things\nin your words how would you describe\ntrauma\nand why is it so misunderstood even\nthough it's so widespread it's a deep\nquestion because on the one hand uh\npromise sometimes you somewhat Loosely\nand promiscuously\nto refer to things that are not\ntraumatic so people will have a\ndifficult experience to say I was\ntraumatized no they weren't they just\nhad a difficult experience\nand this is one of my colleagues points\nout all trauma is stressful but not\nevery stress is traumatic so sometimes\npeople use the word to refer to\ndifficult experiences which is not the\nsame as being traumatized and on the\nother hand where it really matters which\nis in the area of Health that you and I\nare both concerned in whether it's\nphysical or mental health trauma is not\nunderstood nearly enough or used nearly\nenough so that to my mind a lot of\nconditions of mind and body are actually\nvery much trauma related without the\nhealing profession particularly the\nmedical profession actually recognizing\nit so trombadan is it comes in a Greek\nword for wounding drum is a wound it's a\npsychic wound that leaves a scar it\nleaves an imprint in your nervous system\nin your body in your psyche and then\nshows up in multiple ways that are not\nhelpful to you later on so and it's in\nits basic sense trauma is a psychic\nwound and if you look at the nature of a\nwound\num on the one hand if it's raw and open\nit really hurts so when somebody touches\nthat wound that you sustained a long\ntime ago\nbut it hasn't healed yet you'll react\nlike you're just being tormented all\nover again this happens in relationships\nall the time on the other hand\nuh wounds scar over and the scar tissue\nhas certain features is very hard it's\nrigid so it's not flexible so people\ntend to be rigid when they traumatized\nit also doesn't grow so trauma very\noften stops emotional growth and\ndevelopment\nis very raw and painful on the other\nhand it's even lacks sensation because\nScar Tissue doesn't have nerve endings\nin it\nthe trauma then just to finish is not\nwhat happened to you so trauma is not\nthe difficult incidence like trauma is\nnot the war it's not the\nin my case the second world war when I\nwas born or what happened to me Brahma\nis not the abuse that people experienced\ndrama is not the\npain that they felt trauma is the\nwound that is sustained as a result\nso the term wasn't for example the\nsexual abuse Thomas was the wound that\nthe person sustained as a result of\nhaving been abused that's the good news\nJay because\nhe promised the wound that we sustained\nit can be healed at any time if trauma\nis what happened to me 75 years ago or\n78 years ago it happened it never not\nwill have happened\nyou know the the partition of India\nwounded a lot of people but it never\nwould it'll never not have happened but\nif the wound is what happened to people\ninside is the result that can be healed\nhmm that's probably the best\ndifferentiator that I've heard and\nyou're right it is good news because it\nmeans we can't heal it exactly what do\nyou think of the biggest going the\nopposite way we're talking about a wound\nand I want to come back to that but\ngoing the opposite way\nhow would you then Define healing\nbecause that's another word like trauma\nthat is also just everywhere now right\nself-healing healing from this healing\nfrom that I think healing is such a\ninteresting Concept in and of itself\nwhich again is rarely defined or made\nclear to us and from your studies I\nwould love to hear your thoughts in the\nsame ways you did for trauma what is\nwhat is healing sure so you mentioned to\nme that you spent some time in my\nhomeland of Hungary where I was born\nand the Hungarian word for health\nactually begins with the word for\nwholeness so\nHealth literally means wholeness and the\nEnglish word for healing and health also\ncome from an animal Saxon origin meaning\nwholeness\nso for some reason language is\ninternationally have intuited the\nessence of healing which is a sense of\ncompletion and wholeness now what trauma\ndoes is it disconnects us it splits us\noff from our true self and and\ndisconnect us from our emotions\neven from our bodies\nso that that if that disconnection is\nthe essence of trauma then the healing\nis that coming together of the self to\nbecome a whole again\nand uh healing is often used\nsynonymously with cure fair enough but\nstrangely enough\nin my view and not just in my view\npeople can be cured from an illness\nwithout becoming whole without healing\npeople sometimes also become healed\nwithout being cured so in essence\nhealing is not the absence of a physical\nillness but it's the Integrity of a\nperson who's no longer spit off on\nthemselves I think what we find is that\ntrauma is so as you said a wound that is\nlong lasting it can often be that way\nyeah but healing is a process that we\nwant to happen now yeah or today yeah or\ntomorrow yeah\nI'm intrigued by\nhow does time we've always heard time\nwill heal right like that's a whole\ncliche it won't yeah right so so let's\ngo back to the wound and talk about\nis there any relationship between time\nand wounds or unhealed wounds and what\nwhat is that relationship how is that\nwound being formed internally as you\nsaid trauma is not what happens to you\nit's what happens inside of you\nthat which is happening inside of you\nwhat is happening with that wound over\ntime when it's left what happens is that\nit may be lie dormant for a long time\nand then something occurs that touches\nit is when we talk about people being\ntriggered for example something touches\nthe none who will do one inside you and\nyou react you've just been wounded for\nthe first time\nand certainly I can tell you that's been\nthe case for me for example in my\nmarriage relationship is that the the\nunhealed wounds you may think you've\ngone past them but then something will\nhappen that touches that wound and you\nreact like\nyou're being tormented all over again\nfor the first time and time does not\nautomatically heal time maybe scars it\nover time maybe makes it less available\nto immediate memory but should something\nhappen\nto\nevoke it it's going to show up in its\nfull painful impact until you do some\nwork to heal time by itself does not\nheal not not spontaneously not\num automatically how do we uncover those\nbecause I feel that and and maybe this\nis something to address it's that at\nleast what I find is that a lot of our\nbeliefs\nthat we have about ourselves and about\nothers are wired to try and make us feel\nsafe to some degree so I believe and I'm\nhypothetically saying this I believe\nthat I am right\nin my opinion because that makes me feel\nsafe and and secure\nbut often to unearth a wound we have to\nbe okay with the vulnerability of saying\nwell maybe I'm not right maybe this\nresponse is coming from some wound that\nI gain in the past so for example when\nyou were speaking about your marriage\nyou sparked something for me I found\nthat a lot of the love I received when I\nwas younger\nWas Then followed by guilt\nso when I received love when I was\nyounger the idea was if I couldn't\nreciprocate with that level of Love I'd\nbe made to feel guilty that I didn't\nlove someone enough\nand I found that I would repeat that in\nmy own relationship with my wife where I\nwould over love\nand if she didn't match that level of\nlove I would then make her feel guilty\nand it took me years to really discover\nthat pattern and that's just one tiny\npattern and whether that's trauma or\ndifficult experiences a different\nconversation but the idea that spotting\nthat pattern only came from me saying\nwell maybe I'm wrong maybe me wanting to\nmake someone feel guilty is not the\nright thing\nhow do we assess that how do we gain the\nvulnerability in safety to to create\nthat future stability does that make\nsense well it makes sense of sense\nbecause vulnerability itself is\nabsolutely essential for growth so\nvulnerability the word itself comes from\nthe Latin word vulnerary to wound so\nvulnerability is our capacity to be\nwounded now the reality is that as human\nbeings we're all vulnerable from\nconception until death but\nwhen we're hurt in childhood and the\nvulnerability\nis too painful to Bear we will try and\nshut down our vulnerability and for\nexample by being right\nbecause if I'm right then I'm powerful\nand I can't be assailed anymore you know\nbut when we do that we stop growing\neverything in nature grows only where\nit's vulnerable so a crustacean animal\nlike a crab inside a hard shell it can't\nCrow it has to molt and make itself very\nvulnerable to be able to grow a tree\ndoesn't grow where it's hard and thick\ndoes it it goes where it's soft and\ngreen and vulnerable\nthe vulnerability is absolutely\nessential for growth and for\nvulnerability you gotta let go of those\ndefenses such as being right that you\ndeveloped as a child in order to protect\nyourself from the pain so that's why we\ntalk about growing pains because\nvulnerability is necessary for growth\nwithout vulnerability there is no growth\nwow that what you just said that is so\nbeautiful you just said vulnerability is\nour capacity to be wounded if that's\nwhat it means yeah that's I mean that's\nan incredible definition of the word I\nthink we hear so many definitions of\nvulnerability but that that\nvulnerability I'm just going to say that\nagain everyone write that down\nvulnerability is our capacity to be\nwounded\nhow do we develop our capacity so\nactually let's go back to Childhood\nwe'll come back to that so if we go to\nChildhood yeah what are the things\nhappening currently that you perceive\nand I know you talk about this in your\nnew book The Myth of normal by the way\neverything we're talking about is in\nthis incredible book The Myth of normal\ntrauma illness and healing in a toxic\nculture if you don't have it please go\nand order it now\nwhat is happening in our childhood in\nsociety I guess when you say things are\nnot happening to us there are still\nenvironmental impacts that are\nimprinting the potential for this wound\nto grow what are some of those things\nthat are distorting our development in\nunhealthy ways in childhood the two\nthings one is obvious like when the\nchildren are mistreated maltreated\nabused sexually physically emotionally\nwhen there's violence in the family or a\nparent is caught up in addiction or\nwhere there's a rancor's divorce and a\nlot of conflict in the home children are\njust wounded period but it's more\nInsidious and more ubiquitous than that\nbecause children have certain basic\nneeds now if we understand human if you\nwant to understand the zebra\nor a whale\nwhere would you study those creatures in\na zoo or an aquarium or out there in\nnature same with human beings so you\nhave to actually look at what are the\nevolutionary determined needs of human\nbeings as inculcated or instilled in us\nthrough our evolutionary history and so\nwe evolved with certain needs there used\nto be this belief that children or what\nare called the tabular rasa you know an\nempty slate you can just write whatever\nyou want on it program the child in any\nway you want that used to be the\nprevailing belief it's not the true\nchildren are born with not only just\ncertain needs but certain inherent\nexpectations\nso to give an example your lungs are an\ninherent expectation for oxygen because\nthey developed in response to oxygen if\nthere'd be no oxygen in the environment\nwe'd have no lungs\nin the same way with the human child it\nhas certain inherent expectations\nand you can wound kids not just by\nmaltreating them but by not meeting\nthose expectations when I asked the\nexpectation I don't mean a conscious\nexpectation I mean an expectation\ninherent in the organism so children\nneed unconditional living acceptance\nby multiple adult caregivers which is\nhow we evolved in hunter-gatherer groups\nand lived that way for millions and\nhundreds of thousands of years\nchildren have a need not to have to work\nto make the relationship with the\nparents work so a child didn't need rest\nfrom having to\nstruggle to make the relationship\nfunctional so they don't have to be\npretty or cute or compliant or clever or\nsuccessful or\nany of that stuff they just need to be\nand they don't have to work at getting\nthe parents to accept them that's an\nessential need of the child when I say\nessential I mean if it's not met that'll\ndistort child development\nthe third need is really crucial and in\nour society it's hardly ever met which\nis the child needs the freedom to\nexperience all the emotions that nature\nhas endowed her or him or they with so\nwe have certain brain circuits for anger\nfor love for play\nor Lust For seeking curiosity\nall these circuits are there for a\nreason we share them with other animals\nwe share them with Bear Cubs and puppies\nand little whales you know elephant they\nneed to develop because they're there\nfor a reason Evolution gave it to us in\nour society parents are often advised\nand taught to suppress certain emotional\nexperiences on the part of the child\nthat's a wound to the child which\ndistorts their development and has\nsignificant implications for health\nlater on the fourth need\nfourth essential need is fee play out in\nnature\nfree play spontaneous creative\nimaginative play but that's essential\nfor healthy brain development\nwe share that with other animals baby\nelephants play Bear Cubs play puppies\nplay lion cubs play\ncrucial for play for brain development\nwe know that now in our society we put\ncognitive development way ahead of play\nand I be deprived what children of play\nby giving them gadgets which deprives\nthem of your imagination\nso we're actually undermining their\nbrain development and their healthy\nunfolding as human beings so\nchildren can be wounded not just by bad\nthings happening to them but by their\nneeds not being met and in our society\nwhen you ask about the environmental\nconditions that are undermine health and\nand Child Development these\nenvironmental conditions in our society\nare inimical to a healthy human\nunfoldment no wonder we have so many\nchildren in trouble with anxiety and\nADHD and depression and the rate of a\nchildhood suicide is going up and\nthe number of kids being medicated with\nheavy duty medications multiplicity of\nmedications is going up why because the\nconditions for healthy development are\nless and less available to them not\nbecause parents don't love their kids\nnot because they're not trying to do\ntheir best but because of the conditions\nunder which parenting takes place\nin this Society yeah just to share some\nof those stats that are in the book that\nDr mate is referring to\nwe have in 2019 more than 50 million\nAmericans over 20 percent of the US\nadults suffered an episode of mental\nillness rates of obesity along with the\nmultiple health risks it possesses are\ngoing up in many countries including\nCanada Australia and notably the United\nStates where over 30 percent of the\nadult population reached the criteria\nand then this part millions of North\nAmerican children and youths are being\nmedicated with stimulants\nantidepressants and even antipsychotic\ndrugs whose long-term effects on the\ndeveloping brain are yet to be\nestablished so you know you share all\nthese insights and research and work\nwhat what I'm interested by is let's say\na child today is raised in that way I\nfind it fascinating that if you then\nmigrate that child into the\nreal world if everyone is listening I'm\ndoing my quotation marks like real world\nthey walk into this conditioned world\nthat we currently have if we almost\nraised a village of children in in a I\ndon't know what the right word is but I\nguess in a more natural way\nbut then they evolved and had to get a\njob and work in the world\nhow would they function what would be\nyour take on how they would do do I mean\nis there any research on that or what\nwould be your thoughts about how they\nwould deal with the then capitalist\nsociety that is drilled around results\nand performance and being beautiful or\nsmall or cute how would they react to\nthat that question is yeah she has been\nstudied to some degree and they would\nnot automatically buy into the values\nso they may um need to get a job but\nthey wouldn't identify their themselves\nwith the job and they wouldn't judge\nthemselves\nbased on the external values of success\nthey would also into the world with a\nsense of purpose\nand I know you\npurpose is very important to you\nso a sense of purpose can only arise\nfrom us if we're in touch with the real\ncells so they would be in the world but\nthey wouldn't be\nof the world in a sense they wouldn't\nidentify themselves with the values that\nsociety would push on them so I think\nthey would struggle but they would do\nreasonably well and they'd hold them to\nthemselves in the process they wouldn't\nlive a life that's based on what do\nother people think about me am I pretty\nenough do they find me attractive uh\nhave I\ncollected enough goods and objects to\nmake me feel okay about myself they\nwouldn't buy into all that and to the\nextent that this has been studied and it\nhas been those people that can be in\nthis Society without buying into its\nvalues tend to be healthier and more\ngrounded emotionally the reason why I\nlove hearing that is because\nit's the first time I've\nconnected these ideas together that when\nI was born and raised in London I was I\nwas born and raised with all the usual\nPursuits I have a good education\na good home a good financial situation\netc those were the ways I was raised and\nsuccess was a big part of my culture\nyeah and I chased the validation of my\nfamily and the external surroundings in\nmy community and what my aunts and\nuncles thought of me and when that\nvalidation was dissatisfying or didn't\nfeel like it was actually coming my way\nand when I was finally introduced to the\nmonks at 18 I then seeked the validation\nof the monks only for them to teach me\nthat the issue wasn't who you seek\nvalidation from this you were seeking\nvalidation in the first place and so\nwhat what you've just said to me is in\nthree years I got a crash course in what\nyou're saying where we spent more time\nin nature yeah we were trained in\nunlearning the behaviors and habits that\nI'd developed for 80 well 21 years at\nthe time yeah and then when I came back\ninto the world the way you just\ndescribed that is exactly how I felt\nlike I almost felt like a new\nperson coming back into the same world\nthat I left\nwith a completely different approach and\na different map of how to navigate it\nand you're spot on it's still hard it's\nnot that it's perfect and it's easy and\nit's not that I've got it right it's\njust that when I am challenged I have a\ntoolkit or I have some ideas as you said\nwith purpose that help me think about\nthe problem differently you're not\ngoverned by the same thing so when I\nwent into the world of work and I just\nwant to give people a practical example\nof what Dr mate is saying is spot on\nwhen I went into the world of work we\nwere all told that we had to be good at\na list of like 10 things in order to\nsucceed yeah and I looked at that list\nof 10 and I was like I can do one of\nthose things really well and I'm only\ngoing to focus on that one because these\nother nine are not not my nature they're\nnot my purpose\nand it's so strange because that one\nthing made me extremely successful at\nthe company I worked were worked at and\nthen has become how I built my career\nand and it's so true that had I had gone\nin and done what 90 of people did I\nwould have become what ninety percent of\npeople were doing that really deeply\nresonates what is the difference though\nwith and I can't wait to read some of\nthat research on on that I think that's\nfascinating\nwhen you have\na culture where I think most people who\nread this book today\nthe myth of normal\nwill say that they can relate to having\ntrauma illness and trying to be on the\npath of healing especially our community\nhere they they are absolutely going to\nlove this book this is exactly why we\nhave this show\nbut I find that we would all agree I\nthink if I asked everyone to put up\ntheir hands and say how many people feel\nthey experienced a traumatic environment\nat home\nI think most people would raise their\nhands if I asked how many people felt\nwhen they were children that they had\nunhealthy\nrelationships with their parents to some\ndegree I think most people would put\ntheir hand up yeah the challenge I find\nis that\nI I really feel with what you're saying\nwith the book there's a difference\nbetween what you're saying and then the\nother extreme which is Molly coddling so\nthere's neglect and then there's Molly\ncoddling and I find that as humans our\nbrains are wired for extremes so if\nwe've seen that being\nmistreated or neglected is really bad\nfor us we go the opposite way and we go\nokay now I'm going to make sure that\nthis kid has like 24 cushions around it\nI'd be curious to know I like to answer\nthat question this is a very important\none but I just want to know exactly what\nyou mean by Molly Carlin what I see and\nI'm talking about people that I know and\npeople that will speak to me is that\nanyone who had a tough childhood are\nthen trying to create a scenario for\ntheir child where that child experiences\nno pain they no longer respond to the\nchild needs they're coming from their\nown anxieties yes so monocuddling has\ngot nothing to do with the child it has\nto do with the anxieties of the parents\nthat kid is going to download the\nanxieties of their parents so\nmollycodile kids become very anxious and\nvery scared and very ungrounded in\nthemselves on the other hand it's not\npossible to love kids too much in fact\nit was a very interesting study\nwhere they looked at a large number of\nmothers and their infants very in the\nearly few months and most mothers in\nthis study were seen as\nreally good Mothers and some were a bit\ndistant and for their own because of\ntheir own traumas not as available in a\nsmall group we're seen as like super\nloving\nin how they doored over their infants\nokay\n30 years later they looked at these\ninfants when I was adults\nthe ones that were most emotionally\ngrounded and healthy were the ones who\nreceived the super loving\nso there's a difference between you\ncan't love a child too much\nwhat you can so the model calling that\nyou describe is not a child being loved\ntoo much it's a child who has to enjoy\nthe anxieties of the parents\nand you know there's a very famous\nexample in world history of someone\nwhose parents wanted to protect him from\nsuffering was the Buddha he never saw\ndeath he never saw illness and ever so\nold age until he goes out and sees a\ndying person sees a very poor person a\nvery ill person a very old person he\nrealizes there's suffering in the world\nso all the Molly coddling he received\ncould not ultimately\nprotect him from the awareness of pain\nand vulnerability although if I talk\nabout the Buddha I also have to say that\nhis own trauma is often not talked about\nbecause his mother died when he was a\nweek old or right after birth didn't he\ndidn't she so even they try to protect\nher him they couldn't\nyou know but so anyway Molly coding has\ngot nothing to do with the needs of the\nchild yeah that's a great\ndifferentiation it has to do with the\nunmet needs of the parents and as soon\nas parents project their needs onto the\nchild no longer see the child as they\nexist they see their own anxieties\nthey're on their fears and their own\nfantasies\nnaturally that's going to hurt the child\nyeah that's such a great differentiator\nthat's\nagain it's a trauma response it's a\ntrauma yeah it's a trauma response how\nand when should children young adults be\nexposed to pain in order to develop\ntheir vulnerability like as you said the\ncapacity to experience a wound like how\nand when do we allow ourselves how\nshould we what environment is required\nto allow ourselves\nto experience pain in a healthy way or\nor is it just gonna come anyway it's the\nnature of life there's no reason to\ndeliberately expose children to pain\nbecause they're going to experience it\nthe question is how do we support them\nand they do you know why because their\npuppy's gonna die\nbecause grandfather is going to die\nbecause some neighborhood friend won't\nwant to play with them\nbecause\nthey're not going to get the toy they\nwanted because\num\nsome disappointment will happen\nyou know\num so pain is inevitable\nbut it doesn't have to become traumatic\nIf the child is supported in\nexperiencing the pain and moving past it\nso we don't have to impose or bring pain\ninto kid's life to train them\nlife's gonna do that the question is how\nare we to interact with them while\nthey're enduring the pain yeah and what\nwould you say those are obviously\nthere's the love part which you spoke\nabout but\nwhen when a child is going through\nsomething like this let's talk about\nloss because I think that's a big one\nright like whether you're using a parent\nor losing a puppy as you said or\nuh or even if it's not losing a parent\nto death it's losing a parent to a\ndivorce it's you know for example\ncorrect yeah so grief and loss doesn't\nhave to be the end of life it can be\neverything what or a loss of a country\nwhat what are the steps that someone\nshould take in order to helps guide\nthrough anyone through law it's not just\na child well endlessly enough when I\nspoke about these brain circuits that we\nshare with those animals\nfor play and for loving and seeking we\nalso have a brain surgery for panic and\ngrief\nwhether we have that because life brings\nloss and so grief is essential for life\nbecause grief is\ncoming to terms with the fact that\nsomething is gone is not going to come\nback\nyou know so um I mean a child\nexperiences grief and you know I said\nthat the the need of the child is to be\nable to experience all the emotions\nthey need to be able to experience the\ngrief as well um\nand it doesn't matter whether from adult\neyes we see that loss as major or minor\nit's a question of how's the child\nexperiencing it\nand for a small child\neven what looks like small losses can be\nvery painful\nwell then we don't make the child wrong\nfor it we don't say get over it there's\nnothing wrong think of all the other\nchildren who are suffering all that kind\nof relativistic uh shaming\nstuff you say oh it really hurts doesn't\nit you really wish Grandpa would would\nbe here with you you really wish Mom and\nDad weren't leaving each other\nit hurts in other words you just\nvalidate their emotions\nby doing so you help them accept the\nloss and you have to move through and\nyou help them learn that they can endure\ndifficult emotions without having to\nbecome\nfalling to pieces so we have a circuitry\nfor grief in our brain for grief in our\nbrains it needs to be allowed to do its\nwork I find that a lot of us today are\nreflecting on that inner child right\nlike that language is\nagain more widespread today or is\ngrowing the idea of like oh we have this\ninner child who has this wound or this\ntrauma\nwhat what do you find is the difference\nbetween analyzing and over analyzing or\nthinking and overthinking these\nexperiences and how would you define the\ndifference because\nI I and I'm being very honest and\nvulnerable because it's the only way to\nhave this conversation really like I\noften think about events in my life that\nhappened\nthat would be considered\ngenerally as either difficult\nexperiences or as traumatic right they\ncould be seen as either or\nthere are some of them that I've worked\nthrough myself or with with people that\nI trust or with guides and\nand and obviously through my monk life\nthere were things that I looked at and\nworked on but there are certain things\nthat I don't feel a need\nlike I don't feel a desire to dive into\nthe question I'm asking is should I dive\ninto them or is that considered over\nanalyzing and overthinking and I ask\nthat for everyone else who's listening\nto this going gosh have I thought about\neverything that happened to me I could\nbe there for a while uh yeah what's your\ntake on that well first of all in my\nworld there's no should okay there's no\nthere are no shoulds there's no should\nyeah so um I would never see anybody you\nshould you know because\num that itself is intrusive\nso the question is whether it's helpful\nor not to delve into the past depends on\nwhat's happening with that individual\nand if some of the impacts effects of\ntrauma as we said earlier is that the\nthe wounds of the past keep showing up\nin the present\nso from my point of view it's not so\nmuch about delving into the past and\ndwelling on the past\nbut on dealing with how the past they\nshow up in the present what a\npsychologist friend of mine Peter Levine\ncalls the tyranny of the past where the\npast dominates my present reactions\nit doesn't matter how many times I go\nback and think about my childhood story\nthat's not going to help me what I have\nto deal with is\nwhat's happening in Mina right now at\nthis very second which is the shadow of\nthe past\nso\nthinking about it is not going to be of\nmuch help\num what's going to help is to deal with\nthe emotions that are arising now as a\nresult of what happened and how those\nemotions affect my life\nin the present moment so it's not about\nthe past it's about the present yeah so\nit's it's really about the choices we\nhave now exactly what's available to us\nnow yeah what's available to us now\nbecause I feel like we didn't have a\nchoice in the past because we were there\ntoo young or exactly too incapable of of\nmaking a choice exactly but the choices\nthat happen right now are can transform\neverything it is possible some people do\nmake themselves into victims they kind\nof identify with the victim rule all\nthis stuff happened to me and therefore\nI cannot do such and such or I'm keep or\nI'm heard and I'll never get over it\nit's possible to identify with the\nvictim wrong\nit's even possible to identify with the\nsurvival I'm a Survivor well no that's\nnot who you are you survived but who you\nare is much greater than that particular\nexperience and who you've always lost\nmuch always much greater than\nyour suffering you know and so it is\npossible for some people to identify\nwith the suffering and the past to such\na degree that they stop moving forward\nyes I think you've just raised really\nimportant component of all of this on a\ndeeper level is that\nwhat we identify with right even earlier\nyou were talking about people who would\nbe raised in this hypothetical Village\nwe were talking about but even through\nresearch they won't identify with the\nvalues of a capitalist Society yeah\nidentification you just said people\ncould identify as a victim they could\nidentify as a survivor\nwhat is a healthy identification\nthere isn't there isn't one right\nbecause I if you look at again the\nmeaning of words and I just find the\nwords fascinating yeah identification\ncomes from a Latin word uh edem which\nmeans the same and fechera to make\nas soon as I make myself the same as\nsomething like if I identify with my\nrole as a doctor\nI immediately limit myself\nif you identify with your experience as\na monk\nand I don't mean not to learn from it or\nto grow from it but if I identify with\nit that's what I am you've now narrowed\nyourself\nso there's no healthy identification if\nI identify\nmyself with a state\nor a nation I could be loyal to that\nstate or Nation I could love that state\nor Nation or any group but if you\nidentify with it such as new you have no\nindependent existence you've limited\nyourself already so when you say is\nthere a healthy identification not\nreally\nisn't the challenge though that we're I\nthink all of us are pursuing some sort\nof identification like that seems to be\na massive human need like I support this\nfootball club or I'm a fan of this band\nor I'm a member of the this car club or\nI go to this shopping grocery store or\nlike I feel like we're all wanting to be\nmembers like that seems to be like a\nhuman need of wanting to be a member of\na community wanting to identify with\nsomething\nit is a human need to belong and uh but\nbut can we belong without identifying to\nthe point that we have no independent\nperspective you know in other words can\nwe be authentic then and I talk a lot\nabout this tension between authenticity\nbeing ourselves and attachment which is\nbelonging ideally we can both be\nauthentic and belong\nyeah but but that kind of identification\noften leads to suffering I mean it's\nwhat the Buddhists call attachment isn't\nit and let me give you an example so you\nmentioned sports team so in in the night\nyou wouldn't know this but in the 1950s\nthe Hungarian soccer team was the best\nin the world we never lost that's I did\nnot I love soccer and I did not no no we\nwent to Britain and we beat Britain six\nto three in Wembley Stadium the first\nthe first time that it was a sorry Brit\nfans yeah sorry about but you know um\nand it was a huge national holiday in\nHungary and small country goes to Mighty\nBritain and beats them at their own game\nyou know\nand the next year every the whole\ncountry was joyful and there's still one\nof the great memories of my childhood\nthe next year when the world\nchampionships and were the heavy\nfavorites because we haven't lost for\nyears\nand we meet the Germans in the final and\nwe lose three to two yeah National\ntragedy\nuh I'm telling you it still hurts you\nknow\nit's just a football game played on the\npitch by 22 guys in 1954.\nso what you know but when you when this\nis over identification yeah then that\nitself brings suffering now you know yes\nyou can support your team\nin Vancouver British Columbia where I\nlive\nit's a very peaceful place but the\nVancouver connects which is a local\nhockey team made it to the Stanley Cup\nfinals and they lost they were riots in\nthe streets why because people had over\nidentified you can enjoy the team and be\na\na sports fan but the identification that\nyour joy or satisfaction depends on\nwhether your team loses or wins well why\nit doesn't matter yeah I I love that\nanswer for many reasons because\nI've had to go through the\ngrief of letting go of past selves\nadopting new selves and then having to\nrealize that none of those were me as my\nidentification so as you rightly said\nwhen I took off the garbs of a monk when\nI took off my robes\nit was really tough because there was a\npart of my identity especially at a\nyoung age that was attached even to the\nouter covering and had to realize that I\nhad to extract the inner beliefs and\nleave the outer covering behind and the\nouter name and the what that meant and\neven in my career today like I've had to\nlet go and and even now I don't even\nknow how to identify in one sense\nwhenever I'm sure I'm sure you feel this\nto some degree in your work as well it's\nlike whenever they say like oh when\nyou're on TV and they want to put like\nyour your title and they'll be like Jay\nwhat's your title I'm like I I'm more\ndefined by my purpose than my profession\nlike you know what I what I do for\npeople and the service I want to offer\nin the world is far more important to me\nthan author or podcaster or former monk\nor like those things don't really Define\nme well I get that totally I I am yeah\nwhat I'm thinking about is you're\ntelling me when you left those monks\nrobes we talked about the crab didn't we\nwith the heart shell to grow you have to\nlet go of the Shell at some point so\neach of those moldings represent the\npoint of growth but if the time is\ndifficult so when I left Family Practice\nto go and work with a highly addicted\npopulation in Vancouver\nand it was a loss of identity for a\nwhile I was a bit disoriented for a few\ndays because all these people these\nfamilies that had relied on me to be the\nkind of the linchpin of their linchpin\nof their health and all these people\nthat have come to me and trust me and\num who I would see in the office and all\nof a sudden I left that\nso I totally understand that no the\nreality is that I'm so grateful that I\ndid but then I got to experience in the\nnext realm of work helped to further\nDefine my purpose in life and taught me\nso much about myself and human beings\nand\nbut at the time it was difficult letting\ngo that identification was difficult and\nthere was really that sense of\nwell if I'm not that then what am I this\nis what happens when we identify with\nrules yeah if anyone's listening and\nwants to have go at figuring out what\nyour subconscious answer is ask one of\nyour friends ask them and then get them\nto ask you who are you yeah and and your\nanswer to that question not an episode\nof the time when you ask someone who are\nyou they'll say I'm a lawyer I'm an\naccountant I'm uh I'm a Brit I'm an\nAmerican I'm you know always the answer\nis on such a material Level well as one\nspiritual teacher said I think unless\nthey're making this up but I think he\nsaid they said that the problem is not\nnot knowing who you are the problem is\nthinking that you know who we are yeah\nyeah yeah it's incredible isn't it that\nthe things that a true safety feel\nunsafe to the mind yeah and I'm\nintrigued by that because you've studied\nthe mind you've studied addiction you've\nstudied healing you studied trauma why\nis it that we seek certainty and\nstability when you earlier also said\nthat the only time we experience growth\nis the opposite when we're vulnerable\nwhy is it that we're so addicted\nto things staying the same or things not\nchanging like that seems to be a core\nhuman addiction well a therapist once\nsaid to me that this has to do with the\nnature of the Mind\nthat you're referring to\num a therapist once said to me but if\nyour parents didn't know how to hold you\nyou develop the mind you hold yourself\nwith\nso you find safety in his mind that you\ncreated and so the human mind the\nordinary egoic human mind is basically a\ndefensive structure\nit's in significant ways it's a response\nto pain that's not all it is but in\nsignificant ways it's a response to pain\nit's a fate of pain and it's designed to\nkeep you from experiencing pain so it's\nworried and it's anxious and it's\ndefensive\nso when it comes to change and\nvulnerability the Mind wants to defend\nagainst it\nand so it's it comes out of fear which\ncomes out of childhood experience where\nthe pain that you had wasn't held\nand therefore we developed these mind\nstructures to keep you from experiencing\nit and I mean one of them clearly is\naddiction and you know Keith Richards\nthe world's most famous former heroin\naddict the Rolling Stone guitarist\nsaid about addiction for example\nhis heroine use\nthat the contortions you go through just\nnot to be yourself for a few hours\nnow why would somebody not want to be\nthemselves because it hurts so much at\nsome point to be yourself\nand then the Mind comes in and tries to\nprotect you on that pain of being\nyourself\nwith its ideas and his beliefs and its\ncertainties and its endless desires and\nits artificial needs\nand it's her faith to let go\nbecause if I let go\nI'll be helpless child again but the\nMind large is a defensive structure and\nthen often will react that way that\ndefensive structure\nobviously it sets us up for so much what\nis happening inside that makes two\npeople react completely differently to\nthe same thing right you could have a\nparent that's a drug addict and one of\nthe children goes I'm never gonna have\ndrugs ever again because I saw what I\ndid to my parents and the other person\nactually imitates the behavior and goes\ndown the same path what have you found\nor seen that at a young age creates that\ndifferent Journey well the first thing\nto say is that no two children have the\nsame two parents and no two children\nhave the same childhoods even even\nthough they grew up in the same\nbiological\na family because first of all one of\nthem came along at a different time\nso they had a different set of\nexperiences this is the birth order that\naffects how children experience the\nparents\nthen there's degrees of sensitivities\nso\nsome people are born more sensitive than\nothers sensitive a game comes on the\nLatin word sincere to feel so the more\nsensitive we are the more we feel\ngiven the right environment\nnourishing supportive\ngrounded environment that sensitive\nchild just becomes an intuitive a\nCreator an artist an actor a leader but\nin an environment where there's pain\nthat sensitive child suffers more pain\nthan a less sensitive one\nso you'll have more of a reason to\nescape from the pain\nit's not so much that he imitates the\nbehavior of the adult is that he takes\nthe same Escape Route\nand actions are always there in my view\nat least an escape route from pain\nso it has to do with birth order with\nfamily circumstances it degrees of\nsensitivity\nhaving said that the other child who\ndoesn't become an addict hasn't\nnecessarily escaped\nthey just may have developed different\ncoping mechanisms\nthere might have become one of these\npeople that are going to make a big\nsuccess in the world out of themselves\nand they're going to never going to fail\nand they have to be the best and they're\ngoing to suffer too they just might\nsuffer in a different way that\nsensitivity you're talking about is\nprobably one of the biggest\nquestions I get asked right now and I I\nwant to ask it to you because I feel\nyour experience could offer some real\nlight on it I feel people are\nexperiencing so much sensitivity\nand empathy that they just can't stand\nthe world we live in today there are\npeople like that and and I hear this\nagain and again where it's like whether\nit's the political climate or the\neconomic climate or their family have\naddictions or friends like everything\nthat you talk about in the book\nand people feel this can't be my home\nlike I this this is not the place I want\nto live in and so just as you were\nsaying earlier that someone may have the\nthought I don't want to be myself or\nfeel like myself for a few hours people\nsay well this doesn't feel like the\nworld I want to live in\nI'm sure you've met many people who've\nfelt that way seen that way or maybe\neven talked that way I haven't met\npeople let me tell you something I\nworked with you I I\nI had an experience with ketamine a few\nyears ago this is an academy and\ntraining for healers and I was injected\nwith ketamine it was taking me where I\nwas taking me and all of a sudden I\nfound myself screaming I hate the world\nthat was good that it would came out of\nme so I totally know what you're talking\nI'm just saying that that person I\npersonally know what you're talking\nabout okay so here's the thing\nI think a lot of that has to do with\nat first of all the world is getting\nmore stressed it's getting more splited\neverybody sees that it's getting more\nhostile in a lot of ways getting more\nless welcoming and more dangerous\nmore alienating\non the one at the other hand we're more\nand more alone with it I isolation and\nloneliness are rising\nso\nif people experience pain and change and\num stress or even Danger communally\nis bearable\nbut when we're alone with it it becomes\nless and less bearable and so one of the\nmajor factors driving I think the\nsensitivity that you're describing is\njust how alone people feel\nwhich is how not not how we're meant to\nbe so that the capitalist values of you\nknow aggressive individualistic uh uh\nruthless greed and competition\nagainst everybody else that doesn't\nreflect human needs or even human nature\nnot as we evolved\nbut the world the more the world gets\nthat way and the more isolated we become\nthe more vulnerable we are to be hurt by\nthe world that we live in and I think\nthat's what people are talking about um\nyeah I think one of the biggest things\nfor me I was really fortunate that the\nclient-side coach and the people that I\nwork with I got to experience a lot of\nindividuals who were vulnerable with me\nbut they experienced being\nlonely and successful\nand lonely success\ndidn't bring happiness\nand I know that one thing that me and my\nwife were always talking about\nespecially because we're in a country\nwhere we don't have any family we had to\nstart from scratch in our friendship\nwork and everything was I heard you say\nin a podcast of how important families\nto your wife for example for my wife\nit's huge like her personal family is\nlike everything to her like that's her\ngreatest value\nbut here we had to build our family yeah\nand I think one of the things we\nconstantly do is we try and make a\nconcerted effort in order to cultivate\nand curate our community in LA and it's\nfascinating to me because again\nperception comes in where most people\nsay to me well la is a very shallow\nplace like La is a very fake place and\nalso well I found some of my best\nfriends here and incredible human beings\nhow much does that perception of a place\nor a space or a person actually also\nmake us more lonely because I find\nsometimes that loneliness is created by\nperception like if we're scared of being\nvulnerable with someone it's hard that\nsomeone will be vulnerable with us right\nso what do we need to do in order to\nbuild deeper relationships for healing\nand in this path that you're suggesting\nwell first of all it occurs to me that\nloneliness is\nobvious perception there's a difference\nbetween being alone and being lonely\nalone is just a fact and that we can\nEmbrace and make decisions about\nloneliness\nit's got an emotional\ncharge to it\nand that's very much a matter of\nperception\nyou can be alone\nand not be lonely\nand you can be surrounded by all kinds\nof people and be completely lonely\nso that goes how open am I I'll\nvulnerable am I really really willing to\nbe\nwhat defenses have I erected around\nmyself to protect myself that keeps me\nfrom really contacting other people\nI think we unwittingly generate\nloneliness there's also something else\nthat happens and you referred to this\nearlier you talked about Elders so in\nour society we don't talk about Elders\nwe talk about the elderly it's not the\nsame in our society that defines people\nso much in terms of their economic value\nwe tend to discard people that are not\nperceived as having economic value\neither as producers or consumers\nso this Society generates a lot of\nloneliness just because it's\nmaterialistic values\nand in other functioning cultures Elders\nare not only they're respected but\nthey're also\nthey have a purpose\nthey have the wisdom they have the\nexperience they have the vision they\nhave let go of a lot of the attachments\nthat youth invariably engages with so\nthey have a lot to offer\nso loneliness is also created in a\nsociety that has a very rigid and\nlimited set of values yeah I love the\nchange in the language again of the\nelders and the elderly and it's\nI I always go back to that time in my\nlife because it it gave me so much but\ngrowing up around people that were the\nsame age younger older yeah and Elder\ngave you so many different visions of\nlife\nand when I look back at my childhood or\nmy young adulthood I was constantly\nsurrounded by people that were older\nthan me younger than me much older than\nme and wiser than me yeah and being able\nto have everyone's Vantage Point yes\ncreated a beautiful 360 degree picture\nof Life yes but most of today we're only\nseeing one degree if you spend time with\nonly people your age you're getting a\nvery limited Viewpoint of life versus if\nyou're spending time with a much wider\nage range and you tend to get a much\nless mature and rounded view of life one\nof the books I've helped to write core\nword is called hold on to your kids but\nparents need to matter more than peers\nand\nthe point made in that book is precisely\nwhat you just articulated which is that\nfor so many people their world begins\nand ends with their own age group\nwhich is a developmental disaster\nbecause again we evolved as creatures in\ntouch with multiple people of multiple\nages\nand we've spent our time around people\nwith multiple ages\nwhen you isolate people by age as this\nculture largely does I mean there's\nsubgroups within subgroups within\nsubcultures within subcultures in a\nsociety all based on\nvery shallow identification with age\nit just limits our development\nand limits our possibilities and and\nwith that development how do you see\nhuman nature do you see human nature as\nmuddied trying to become Pure or\nbeginning at pure and then getting\nmuddied and then trying to go back early\nhow do you see that well we do happen to\nhave a trap to a human nature in this\nbook and and pondering that same\nquestion that Jesus raised I'm always\ncome to the conclusion it's not that\nthere's a definable human nature not\nthat you can say because I mean look\nBuddha was a human being Hitler was a\nhuman being\none is full of compassion and love and\ngiving the others full of greed and\naggression and hatred they're both human\nbeings so how can you talk about the\ndefined human nature however what I\nthink we can say confidently\nthat is a certain human potential\nbased on human needs\nif those needs are met\ndevelopment would be healthy and those\npotential will be realized\nif those needs are frustrated\nwhich they severely were in the case of\nsay ahead there a terribly abused child\nthen what you get is the hatred and the\nrage and the murderous\nVenom\nthat characterize that personality now\nwhen you couple that with political\npower you see what happens\nbut that's not human nature it's just\nhuman nature thwarted because the needs\nof that child were not met in a society\nthat was completely incapable of meeting\npeople's needs in fact totally abused\nthem so\nhuman nature to me is not a given what\nbehaves a human potential based on human\nneeds of these needs are satisfied we\ncan be reasonably confident that people\nwill be connected and generous most\npeople want to be kind I mean it's\ninteresting in a society when somebody\ndoes something selfish\nor greedy you say that's just human\nnature hmm do we say that when\nsomebody's kind or generous\nyeah never the the educator Alfie Cohen\npoints that out and if you ask most\npeople when did your body feel more of\nthese when do you experience more peace\nwhen you've been kind and generous and\ngiving authentically not for not a sense\nof Duty but because\nthat was just the impulse or when you're\ngrasping and greedy when is there more\ntension and more discomfort inside so\nthat should tell us something about our\nnature that that our nature wants to be\naligned with connection and generosity\nand giving because our bodies will tell\nus that that is so true that is so true\nI mean there is no time in life when\nyou're bitter at someone or angry at\nsomeone that makes you feel good inside\nlike it does yeah gut wise too I'm not\njust meaning in the hot space but in in\nall areas of your body the tension the\nstress the the holding the tightening\nbut but like we were talking about\nearlier Society set up in a way for\nfalse identification and divisive\nidentification whether it be two sets of\nsoccer fans who now hate each other or\nrioting or whether it be you know\npolitical parties or whether it be\nbusinesses at war with each other right\nlike everything's set up in a way to get\nyou to identify with something in order\nfor you to be against something like\nthat's what naturally ends up happening\neven schools like I went to this school\nyou went to that school we competed\ncompetition seems to be something that\nhas been carefully crafted by capitalist\nsociety and then when you see the rise\nof and by the way I love competition so\nI Health competition is great uh so I'm\nnot talking bad about competition but\nit's interesting to see how again it's\nso hard to compete without identifying\nas that being your worth yeah and that\nrequires so much mental spiritual\nstrength in my opinion to be able to\ndifferentiate between identification and\nattachment well it's really interesting\nbecause\nlet's take the example of sports that\nyou just mentioned what do you call the\npeople who participate in those words\nthat we call them players\nwhat do we call the process that they're\nengaged in we call it a game\nbut we don't treat it like players we\ndon't treat it like a game because real\ngames and real play Has No Agenda\nthere's competition in the process and\nyou want to do your best\nbut in the end\nit doesn't matter if it's just it's for\nthe process and for the joy of it that's\ngenuine play\nwell when you think about these\nmulti-billion dollars Sports Industries\nand the\nstrategy and the hype\nthat goes into these are not players\nanymore these are warriors almost as if\ntheir engagements are kind of a battle\nand winning and losing becomes\neverything like the famous Vince\nLombardi Winning is not the only thing\nis the only thing well that's not true\npeople\nthat's true for the purposes of playing\nas long as you recognize that you're\nonly playing\nas long as you don't confuse the game\nwith life itself but once it becomes a\nbusiness and becomes cutthroat\nthat confusion\nis really prevalent and people take it\nso seriously so when you think think\nabout it like you have these terrible\nconflicts in the world like the war in\nthe Ukraine right now the average person\nhow much time are they induced to spend\nthinking about those large issues\nor say but\nclimate change that only the blindness\nof the blind\nor the wickedness the wickedest can at\nthis point deny as a reality\nbut how much of our life do we spend\nactually pondering and engaging with\nthese larger issues compared with\nanalyzing\nwhich quarterback should have played in\nwhich quarter of which particular NFL\ngame you know so that these so-called\ngames and these so-called players have\nassumed that far larger importance in\ntheir life in our lives whereas the real\nthings we we tend to ignore you've just\nsparked something for me that\nI was blown away by this experience I\nrecently went to Rwanda\nand I went there with Ellen DeGeneres in\ncollaboration with the dying Fosse\nfinders opened up a guerrilla sanctuary\nand a Conservation Center yes and we\nwent there to Trek with the gorillas\nlearn about gorillas learn about Rwanda\nand I had never been to Rwanda before I\nI didn't know if I would have visited if\nit wasn't for her\nand the biggest thing I took away\nobviously trekking with gorillas and\nbeing in nature with a form of life that\nhas no interest in us but we're totally\nfascinated by them was an incredible\nexperience and I'll talk about that\nseparately but the reason I brought it\nup here is I also took time to go to the\ngenocide Memorial Museum yes\nand it was fascinating for me to learn\nthat it's been around 20 years from what\nI remember a tenth of the population of\nthe country so like a million people\nhave like 10 million people died in the\ngenocide were killed in the genocide\nyeah and most of the people who lived\nthere today it was their parents it was\ntheir ancestors that that did this just\n20 years ago which is not a long time at\nall\nand I met some of the survivors I sat\nwith them in the museum I talked to them\nwe talked to the to the locals we talked\nto people that were helping us with our\ntravel and arrangements and the hotels\nwe stayed at\nand it fascinated me that the people\nwere so healed like there was such a\ngenuine sincere conversation that they\nhave now let go of this to tribe culture\nthey've let go of the names the\nidentification that they're living by a\nprinciple they call Ubuntu I am because\nyou are I believe or you are because I\nam like that's I'll get that right but\nUbuntu is the word that they use and it\nwas so special I was I was totally I'm\ncurious to ask did you delve into what\nallow them to do that they they said a\nlot of it came through the leadership\nlike they said that that was how they\nwere being it's what you're saying like\nwhen you said like they were asked to\nyou're saying we don't make time to\nfocus on these huge issues because we're\ntoo busy wondering which player played\nin which position yeah that's they\ndidn't say it in that way but that's\nwhat they were saying that our\nleadership encouraged us to think in\nthis way\nand I couldn't believe that in 20 years\nwhen your parents have probably killed\ntheir parents that you were standing\nnext to each other not worrying about\nthe lineage that this this culture was\nset out and it was the Europeans who who\nset up part of that anyway but I just\nwanted to understand from you like what\ndoes it take to get to that level of\nhealing because that's you know people\nwould say okay well that's a 10 million\npopulation to me that's still a\nhumongous win for the world yeah\num I was wondering if you've seen\ncultures if you've seen even smaller\ngroups or even living through the war\nwhere you've seen that kind of healing\nbefore I don't know how the hearing\nhappened in Rwanda um yeah\nreally encouraged to hear what you\ndescribe here I think at the very least\nof it the suffering had to be\nacknowledged and had to be heard\num and fully acknowledged and then the\nhearing can take place yeah\num without that it can't of course\nabsolutely which is why it's so\nimportant to understand trauma the\nsuffering has to be acknowledged now in\nmy country Canada like when you talked\nabout Rwanda of course that tribal\nhatred didn't just\nariser from nowhere nor is it\nnecessarily in the nature of those\npeople to be like that a lot of it was\nthe legacy of colonialism that quite\ndeliberately and\nyou would know something about British\ncolonialism\num it quite it quite deliberately said\none group against another the legacy of\nwhich was often tremendous struggle and\nhatred and violence in Canada as in the\nUnited States the legacy of colonism\nFalls far more particularly on our\nindigenous peoples\nso then to this day\nthey suffer so much the addiction made\nas much higher amongst them fifty\npercent of the women in jail in my\ncountry are indigenous people wow they\nmake up five percent of the population\nwow an indigenous woman is six times the\nrate of rheumatoid arthritis\nthey never used to rheumatoid arthritis\nprior to colonization there's been some\napologies in Canadian history\nbut there's been not sufficient\nacknowledgment of what actually happened\nand what continues to happen\nand I'm saying that an essential\ncondition for that healing would have to\nbe acknowledgment\nso the wolf came to Canada just maybe\nsix weeks ago because\nthe church cooperated with the state to\nabduct children from their homes\nindigenous children from their homes for\nover 100 years\ninto the 1990s into these residential\nschools where our native children were\nnot allowed to see their parents where\ntheir culture was extirpated they had\npins stuck in their tongue if they spoke\ntheir tribal language\nthey were sexually abused often they\ndied they were physically abused they\nwere starved and the pool came and\napologized\nand you know what the apology was I'm so\nsorry for what some Christians did to\nyour people\nwell that's\nhe means well as a person\nbut that wasn't that was an apology\nuttered by an institution\nbecause it wasn't\nor it should have been uttered by the\ninstitution but they said what some\nChristian wasn't some Christians it was\nthe state\nand it was the church and what I'm\nsaying is that was a good first step\nbut until there's full acknowledgment\nand and we are fully willing to hear the\nsuffering of the people that we hurt and\nthat's why in the 12 Steps whether they\ndo they lose moral inventory how did we\nhurt somebody and how can we without\nimposing on them\nhow can we acknowledge\nif that's appropriate so I think for\nhealing whether for myself or people\nthat I've heard\nthere has to be acknowledgment yeah of\nthe of the suffering itself I think\nthat's the First Essential step the\nchallenge we have though right in\nsociety is that\nI fully agree with you but from for most\npeople we will never get the apology we\ndeserve because again we live in an\nunhealed environment where people are\nnot coming out of the woodwork and\nsaying I'm so sorry for what happened\nand even if they do it's a bad apology\nor a incomplete apology or a 10 apology\nso how do we function in a world where\noften the closure\ndoesn't come from the person who hurt us\nor the person who created the wound or\nthat we received a wound through and it\nreally comes down to us like no that's\ntrue yeah so I work a lot with\nindigenous groups in Canada\num when they asked me to and first of\nall I often say about who the hell am I\nto offer your advice because in your\nTraditions there's so much healing\nwisdom so that the best advice I can\ngive you a store\nfollow your own Traditions but I often\nsay to them as well don't wait for the\nacknowledgment from the government or\nfrom society because it's going to take\na long time coming but you need to\nacknowledge your own suffering\nyou need to acknowledge your own pain\nand then\nthere's so many rituals there's so many\nTraditions the dance and the chanting\nand the drumming and the sweat lodges\nand the the sun dancing and the going\nback to the land and the wisdom circles\nand the and the restorative justice\nthere's so much wisdom so what I'm\nsaying to people is acknowledge your own\nsuffering but to look to the wisdom\nWithin\ntoward the healing and it's there that\nwisdom to heal is inside cultures and\nSociety peoples and inside individuals\nas well\nwe both have to acknowledge the\nsuffering and not get stuck on it yeah\nbut then to look for the healing\ncapacity within yeah and you certainly\ncan't wait for the world to\nit's nice but you can't wait for it\notherwise you're dependent on somebody\nelse for your healing yeah and I feel\nlike when you're healing\nmost apologies are dissatisfying like\nwhen you're healed or and we'll talk\nabout that what that means but I feel\nlike when you're more along the process\nof healing you can receive an apology\nyou can receive a a vulnerable piece of\ninformation from someone who may have\nhurt you or but when you're when you're\nin the thick of the healing process I\nfind that validation and apologies\nrarely really feel that good like you\nknow and I'm saying that for myself I\nknow that when I've worked when I've\nbeen in the thick of like working really\nhard in my life or trying to make\nsomething happen and someone says yeah\nyou're doing great it doesn't feel like\nanything because you almost feel you\ndon't feel fully understood it doesn't\nmake sense yeah\nseeing you yeah and you don't feel seen\nno you don't feel seen there's seen some\naspect of you yeah but we need to be\nseen that's that's a human need there's\na psychotherapist here in California\ncalled Eve yes absolutely yeah I know it\nis\nwas in the same train probably or quite\nlikely on the same train to Auschwitz\nthat my grandparents were along with her\nfamily\nshe's in her 90s now she describes\nbecause they came from the same town in\nsouthern Slovakia Northern Hungary\nher parents were killed in Auschwitz as\nwe were grandparents Edith\ndescribes in one of her books that she\ngoes back to the Burghoff which is in\nthe burway in Alps where Hitler lived to\nforgive Hitler wow\nwhich is not to say to make it okay what\nhe did\nbut to release him from the cage that\nshe kept inside her own heart because\nthat limited her so the Forgiveness\nwasn't it's okay what you did the\nforgiveness was I was gonna hold this\nhatred in this resentment in me anymore\nbecause this limiting me\nyou know so the work really is internal\nwhere do you see the connections between\nyou talked about the\nyou know the practices and the healing\nof the indigenous people Etc how much do\nyou see a connection between\nspirituality and healing and where has\nit gone right and where does it\nsometimes go wrong so first of all\nspirituality is one of these words that\nagain gets thrown around yeah it gets\nthrown around the who knows what\nsomebody means when they talk about it\nyeah\nso we can only talk about it in terms of\nwhat you mean by it yeah and what I mean\nby it so yeah I I liked what you said\nthat there are ancient Traditions yeah\nthat Focus heavily on inner healing yeah\nand that I'll explain my chance the\nchallenge I see is that often even these\nancient Timeless Traditions have now\nbecome externalized and\ninstitutionalized so they've lost their\npurity of the inner healing that's\nrequired and they become commodified\ncorrect right yeah which is what will\nhappen in a material Society yeah I\nspend time with some indigenous people\nearlier this year in a in a ceremony\nwhat I was struck by is uh the deep deep\ndeep connection with nature in fact even\nthe connection is inadequate a word I'm\ntalking about Unity\nlike they just felt so alive David blade\nof grass and every tree and\nthe mountain that overlooked our\nceremony and the Bison that were in the\nfield\nso for me spirituality if it means\nanything at all it means sense of\nconnection to something larger which is\ndifficult to Define\nand may be different for every person or\nfor every group but it's something\nBeyond The Limited\nconfines of both body and the egoic mind\nno I think that's our nature as human\nbeings I can't prove it\nbut that's my sense and I think and and\ncertainly when you talk about the\nindigenous Traditions they talk about\nthe medicine wheel which is\num the quadrants involve the uh our\nemotions and our physical bodies and our\nsocial relationships and our spiritual\nselves\nand we have to be sort of grounded in\nall four of those quadrants to be fully\nwhole\nso I think there's something in that\nspirituality that is really essential to\nus what that is I think each person has\nto discover for themselves if they don't\nhave a tradition that\nalready grounds them in it yeah yeah you\nreminded me of my time that I spent\nwith some groups in Hawaii and they had\na song for the sun and the Sea and they\nhad a beautiful ritual where when a\nchild is born the umbilical cord is\nplaced on the earth and then they carve\nalmost like a\na pattern There To Remind the child that\nthis is your connection to the Earth\nthat I always thought that was such a\nbeautiful ritual I I was wondering\nwhether you've seen or whether you've\nlooked at a tool any aspects of\nreincarnation or past lives or trauma\nacross lives or or seen any connections\nor study in that space I've had people\ntalk to me about their experiences and\nthere's a rabbi I met once who\ntold me that in ancient times he was a\npriest in Egypt well it was in no way\nLuna a lunatic you know or a psychotic\nhe was very grounded lovely man you know\nand he was convinced my mind doesn't go\nthere\nuh I've I've read something about these\nTraditions you know the Tibetan\ntradition of the Bardo and the you\nprobably know a lot more about it and I\ndo but I have not personal experienced\nit\nand my mind as I've experienced my mind\nso far\nhasn't found a space for knowing what\nthat really means I understand it\nintellectually yes yes but I\nI there's nothing in me resonates with\nit as far as I can recognize yeah now\nmaybe at some point I have some huge\nAwakening uh or maybe after I die\nthere'll be a huge joke on me you know\nyou didn't believe buddy well here it is\nbut frankly right now if you ask me I'd\nsay nothing in me goes there or even\nwants to that's my real that's my truth\nno I appreciate that yeah no no I always\nfind it fascinating for people who study\ntrauma especially when we when you as\nyou said that you know no no child\nstarts at a blank slate they start with\na makeup to some degree and so that's\nwhy I was intrigued but uh Dr Martin\nit's been it's been so beautiful talking\nto you because uh I feel like I get to\nask you questions that\nI wouldn't often receive the answers and\nthe quality of answers the depth of\nanswers that you can provide I I see you\nas a true um Elder as a wise person in\nour society and I I respect you a lot\nfor that and well thanks so much I I can\ntell you quite honestly that this is not\nan interview like I've ever had before\nthank you so much no well thank you and\nI hope this is the first of many uh and\nI want to make sure that everyone has\nbeen listening and watching I would love\nfor you to order a copy right now of the\nmyth of normal trauma illness and\nhealing in a toxic culture we touched on\nsubject matter from within the book we\ntouched on ideas from within

well we will put\nthe links in the show notes follow him\nand share all the insights that you got\nfrom this if there's something that\nstood out I mean there were so many\nbeautiful descriptions of words\ndefinitions Clarity between ideas that I\nthink have just just words that we use\nevery day and we don't know what they\nmean so if something stood out to you\ntag me and Dr Mateo on Instagram on\nTwitter on Tick Tock let us know what\nyou've learned and what you've taken\naway and I promise you that this will be\na great investment this year uh Dr Mata\nis there anything that I haven't asked\nyou before we ask you the final five\nwhich are our fast five questions uh is\nthere anything you'd like to share that\nI have given you an opportunity Yes to\nGod I can't think of anything that you\never knows I love it okay well these are\nfive questions that have to be answered\nin one word to one sentence maximum so\nyou have like a very tight like almost\nthink of like Twitter these are final\nfive the first question is what is the\nbest advice you've ever received on\nhealing or trauma authenticity expand\nI'm gonna ask you to expand because I\nwant to hear now be yourself you know\num when I was a very confused young man\nand I was acting out all over the place\nI had an ant\nwho herself as a very traumatized person\nshe was an ostrich Survivor and she came\nback weighing 80 pounds\nshe was an ophthalmologist\nand she saw me being authentic and she\nquoted she sent me this passage from\nHamlet that famous phrase unto yourself\nbe true and it follows his night today\nthat then thou can't be false to any man\nso be true to yourself without going to\nthe details that Oriental mind couldn't\nbe true to herself because of the nature\nof this culture but that advice has\nalways stayed with me yeah so\nauthenticity has been a major theme in\nmy life it's amazing I love that that's\na great answer okay question number two\nwhat's the worst advice you've ever\nheard or received around troll man\nhealing is it okay if nothing comes up\nfor me yeah if you've never had any bad\nadvice that's good uh what is something\nthat you once valued that you no longer\nvalue\nthis is almost true\nwhat other people think of me yeah I'd\nbe lying if I said but at the same time\nI can do without it\nit was still there but I'm not attached\nto it\nYeah question number four how would you\ndefine your current purpose in life my\npurpose is that people are free\nfrom limitations of culture and also the\nlimitations of their own past and of\ntheir own minds\nand also free politically so my purpose\nis that people are free it's beautiful\nand Fifth and final question if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\none rule one rule one law one principle\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nif it was coercing and creating the\nimpression that one had to do anything\nthat already would defeats his own\npurpose because as soon as somebody has\nto\nit's almost like just just lean forward\nfor a minute would you yeah and put out\nyour hand yeah what do you do as soon as\nI push on your hands use this so as soon\nas people sense that there's a had to\nthere's gonna be resistance so I'm going\nto decline answering that that's a great\nanswer we've never had that on the show\nI love that answer that's a brilliant\nanswer that's fantastic I love I love\nthe way you think the myth of normal is\nout right now trauma illness and healing\nin a toxic culture Dr gabo mate uh it's\nbeen an honor thank you so
