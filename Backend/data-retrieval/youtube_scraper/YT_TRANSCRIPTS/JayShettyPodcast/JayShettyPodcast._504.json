songwriting so John welcome\nto the show great to see you great to\nmeet you yeah I'm excited for our\nconversation yeah me too I usually know\npeople that are on the show and I was\nlike this is we've never met yeah and\nwe've never crossed paths you know and\nso it's always nice to I feel like this\nis the best way to get to know someone\ndeeply and intimately is doing a podcast\nwith them when else would you have a a\nsituation where you meet someone and you\nhave over an hour to talk to them and\nlearn about them yeah when was the last\ntime you did that is that when was the\nlast time you sat down I don't I don't\nknow that that ever happened\nyeah it's a blessing and it's it truly\nis but I I mean I remember being a kid\nin London I remember when we first heard\nyour music and we're like who is this\nperson at the time I was listening to r\nb and hip-hop and rap and then it was\nlike oh this is very different like this\nisn't you know it's hard to kind of pin\nit down into one of their genres but I\nwant to dive into your journey today as\nwell a little bit and I want to start\nwith you being homeschooled yeah when I\nwhen I was researching and reading I was\nlike wow I had no idea yeah I was\nhomeschooled by my parents uh\nparticularly my mother we grew up in a\nvery Christian home my parents sent us\nto a Christian school for a couple years\nbut it was a little expensive for them\nto send us to private school but they\nstill wanted us to have a very a kind of\nChristian education they decided that\ninstead of sending us to this Christian\nSchool they would basically take the\ncurriculum from the school use the books\nfrom the school and uh the school had\nthis homeschool liaison as well because\na lot of Evangelical Christian parents\nlike to use this uh this method we would\nwork with the school but my mom was our\nmain teacher and we were home a lot with\nher we had you know friends in the\nneighborhood relatives in the\nneighborhood but yeah we were with our\nparents and and at the house quite a bit\nwhen most of our friends were going to\npublic school and being around a bunch\nof other kids what's your strongest\nmemory from that time or something that\nyou took away that has kind of stayed\nwith you because I find that\nhomeschooling still a fairly small\npopulation yeah very big in the\nEvangelical Christian Community what I\nremember from it you know I was very\nprecocious so I I love to read I loved\nto independently do whatever you know I\nwould just want to advance past whatever\nI was supposed to be doing at the time I\nwas obsessed with like encyclopedias and\ndictionaries I ended up winning the city\nspelling bee during that time so I was\nvery precocious wanted to learn\neverything my mom had a typing textbook\nand I just decided I was going to learn\nhow to type I was taking piano lessons\nduring this time too so I just wanted to\nlearn everything and uh know how to do\neverything what's something that you've\nbeen trying to learn more recently or\nthe way that mindset's kind of like\ncarried through well I I don't what\nwould you like to then if if you had the\ntime I should do more master classes I\nshould uh be a consumer more massive but\nyeah I haven't done that recently I do\nlike to read a lot and I like to just\nread about how the world works I like to\nread about policy and I'm very\ninterested in you know how to\ncraft a better Society that's more\nloving and more generous and more just\nand more Equitable for more people and\nso I like to read books that kind of\ndiscuss some of these policy ideas and\nand ways of thinking about the world\nyeah no that's beautiful and it is true\nlike I feel like we all get so busy that\nit's hard to find time to keep learning\nyeah I mean I haven't recently taken up\nanything where I'm like I want to learn\nhow to do this that I don't know how to\ndo I try to do it with guitar for a\nwhile and then I just got so busy that I\nnever like stuck with it and I haven't\nhad something like that recently that\nI've done maybe I should learn another\nlanguage yeah my friend did some\nDuolingo no it works for her no I'm with\nyou too I I feel like but it's fun\nlooking back at like what was that in\nchildhood that we loved and kind of\nreconnected it'd be good you know now\nthat you brought it up I'm like why\nhaven't I you know picked something I\nwant to learn about I always thought\nabout should I go back to college didn't\nlike take classes and just just randomly\ntake classes where there's no pressure\nto get good grades but just you want to\nlearn something yeah\num that'd be fun well that's a beautiful\npoint that as an adult you actually get\nto go and learn something without the\npressure of it having to like be good\ngrades or like my mom she's going to\ncollege right now she never graduated\nand she decided she would just go and\nyou know she's like almost 70 years old\nthat's amazing what is what's her\nexperience been like uh she loves it she\nreally enjoys it I think it's very like\nstimulating for her and you know she\ndoesn't work so it's like something to\noccupy our mind and to stimulate our\nmind and she really is learning new\nthings that's amazing so you went from\nbeing homeschooled to then being like\nand obviously there's many years in\nbetween but being homecoming King yes\nand that's like yeah the prom King prom\ngame sorry we don't have problems in\nLondon so you know where I grew up so\nyes I always missed that I would watch\nHollywood movies and I'd be like why\ndon't we get to have prom yeah and so we\nnever did that but what was that\nexperience like if then moving from like\nthis very specific homeschooled culture\nreligious culture institutional culture\nand then transitioning like talk to me a\nbit about that transition as a young\nadult or as a child it was interesting\nbecause at the time the impetus for us\ntransitioning into public school was our\nparents getting divorced\num and that uh the impetus for that\nreally was it began with my grandmother\ndying so my grandmother was very\nimportant in our lives she was very\nimportant in my mother's life and they\nmade music together they ran the church\nchoir together and were very close and\nwhen she died it really sent my mom into\na spiral mental health-wise and and uh\nshe ended up abusing drugs and and just\nreally becoming distant from our family\nfor a while during that period my\nparents got divorced our world was being\nshaken in a lot of ways and one of the\nways it was being shaken is like oh now\nwe're going to public school after you\nknow an entire you know 10 years of my\nlife where I didn't spend any time in\npublic school and you know it was quite\nan adjustment\num coming from home school and I also\nbecause I was so precocious I ended up\nbeing skipped two grades ahead because I\ntested out of the grades I was supposed\nto be in and so I ended up starting\neighth grade at the age of a sixth\ngrader wow and starting high school at\nthe age of 12 and graduating at the age\nof 16. so all of it was a bit you know\ndifficult you know socially adjusting\nadjusting to my parents being divorced\nadjusting to being in a public school\nsetting when I had never been in one\nbefore there were a lot of adjustments\nto make that's why I'm always you know\nwary of the idea of homeschooling kids\nbecause the Social Development just\nisn't really there\num but I figured it out so yeah that's\nwhat I was gonna say I think music was\nalways my way of helping me find find\nways to connect to people because\neven though I was too shy to really\nstrike up a conversation in person I\nwasn't too shy to get up on stage and\nonce I got up on stage it was my way of\nintroducing myself to people it was like\noh and this is me this is who I am and\nI didn't have to break the ice with\npeople because my music was my way of\nbreaking the ice it was like my social\ncrutch I would say at the time it\nenabled me to make friends enabled me to\nfeel like some control over what I was\ndoing and I think when you feel like you\nhave something you're really good at it\nmakes you feel a bit more empowered to\ndo other things and to to connect with\nother people and to feel like you can\ntake up space because you feel like oh I\nhave something that I've shown everyone\nthat I'm really good at I think that is\nsuch a great point and I completely\nagree with you I was a really shy kid\ngrowing up and massively introverted and\nstill I'm to this day in many circles\nbut my parents forced me to go to public\nspeaking drama school and so I would go\nfor three hours a day three days a week\nso yeah nine hours a week it's a lot of\ntime and as I improved in both those\nareas of my life that's where I would\nfeel at home yeah and now I started to\nhave more confidence in different\ncircles and you can move that around and\nI was speaking to my friend recently one\nof my closest friends his son's like 10\nyears old and he was saying that he's\nstruggling with confidence and I said\nexactly what you just said I was like\nwell have you helped him get good at\nsomething yeah I was like you know what\nis he interested in what's he naturally\ngravitating towards that he could be\nencouraged in further because that would\nEmpower him as you said exactly and I\nthink that's such a beautiful thing\nbecause\nwe don't know what to validate ourselves\nthrough when we're kids uh but hearing\nyou reflect back on it makes sense but\nI'm guessing at that time\nthere was a lot of stress I mean being a\nyoung kid whose parents are divorcing\nlike like you said like your mother's\nalso experiencing mental health and drug\nabuse like how were you making sense of\nthat like what helped you it was hard to\nmake sense of it and uh I parted my way\nof uh dealing with what was going on\nwith my mother was to try to ignore it\nhonestly and and so I would uh\npour myself into school pour myself into\nmusic pour myself into these things that\nkept me busy so I didn't think about\neverything that was happening in my\nfamily uh and my dad did a great job of\nyou know helping us guiding us through\nit we had a lot of extended family in\nour community cousins Aunts Uncles who\nhelped fill in the gaps as well and then\nwe have people at school I had a\nguidance counselor he was one of the\nonly black men that worked at my school\nand he really like decided to take me\nand my older brother under his wing and\num just was really helpful and just\nfiguring out School figuring out how to\nget into college all these other things\nthat my parents didn't really know how\nto help us with we just were fortunate\nto have other people fill in the Gap you\nknow they say it takes a village yeah to\nraise a child and I think a lot of times\nwhen your parents aren't able to give\nyou everything that you need it's good\nto have other people in your life that\ncan do it yeah especially especially now\nI feel like\nI feel like they're so I'm not a parent\nyet and of course you are but it's a\nthere's so much pressure on two people\nyeah to be everything yeah to these new\nhuman beings and what you realize is\nthat you know you don't have to be\neverything it's great to have other\npeople around you a village or Community\nthat's one of the things that was so\ndifficult about the pandemic was that's\nfeeling that\num you didn't have that you know\nCommunity Support that most people\nnormally have that feeling of being\ndisconnected and separated from a lot of\npeople despite all the Techno\ntechnological ways that you can get in\ntouch with them it's nice to be in\npresence with people and I think when\npeople didn't have that we're seeing the\nresults of it with a lot of kids\nlearning loss and and falling behind in\nschool and there's a lot of things that\nyou just can't do remotely that you need\nthat Community Support to do yeah no\nabsolutely I want to give a shout out to\nour community for staying with us\nthrough the pandemic because for me\nsitting with someone like this face to\nface\neven for an interview it's like the\nconnection that you have with someone as\nopposed to through a screen yeah it's\njust incomparable it's it's different\nand uh we we made the most of what we\nhad to do during that time but clearly\nit's preferable to be in person and I\nthink particularly for kids as they're\ntrying to learn they need that yeah did\nyou have to you said then I think you're\nso right like as kids we we ignore stuff\nlike that we try and avoid it we try and\nyou know we have to we and I loved what\nyou said you poured yourself into your\nmusic you poured yourself in a school\nand that's why Outlets autistic Outlets\nare so fantastic to have as young people\ndid you ever have to revisit it did you\nfeel like it naturally just improved\nthere were changes or did you ever have\nto revisit that as an adult to be like\ndo I need did you ever feel the need for\nany healing or did you feel that just\nnaturally kind of\ncame to it well we needed to heal we\nneeded to forgive\num our mother because we felt abandoned\nby her well she eventually got sober\ncame back to her family she healed in a\nlot of ways as well and\num you know recovered in a lot of ways\nand\nwe still had to deal with forgiving her\nthough because I think when\nyou feel let down by your parent part of\nwhat you need to do for your own growth\nis figure out how to forgive them and\nhow to love them and not be held back by\nwhatever resentment or anger or\ndisappointment you might feel because if\nyou continue to hold on to it it\nactually hinders you uh as much or more\nthan it hinders anyone else uh the\nperson that maybe the object of your\nforgiveness that's great to forgive them\nbut it's just as important for you\num because that's the best way for you\nto go on and live the best life that you\ncan live is to get that weight off of\nyour shoulder\num that you're holding on to and it's\nalmost hardest doing that with our\nparents because when we're young you\nkind of see them as the person who's\ngoing to be the caregiver in the city\nyeah yeah I think the letdown is is\nbigger dramatic yeah it's dramatic\nbecause you expect them to you know\nthey're supposed to have all the answers\nthey're supposed to do the right things\nthey're supposed to show you the way to\ndo it and then when they when we realize\nthey're not infallible and and then they\nfall from grace in our eyes I think the\ndisappointment is even greater yeah but\nI love that point you're making that\nthere's there's two sides and you got to\nexperience the beauty of your mother's\ngrowth and transformation and change but\nit's like that person's like I'm back\nyeah and you're like you're like oh okay\nyou don't know like you've gotten used\nto dealing with not being with them and\nnot having them in your life and my\nparents got remarried during this time\nand that was weird\num so it was like a lot of dealing with\nall those feelings dealing with\nforgiveness wondering how to adjust to\nhaving that person back in your life\num all of that it was it was very\ninteresting yeah mine was kind of the\nthe opposite where like I was\nencouraging my parents as a 10 year old\nto get a divorce so I was seeing and\nexperiencing and they would both tell me\nabout what was going on and I'd be like\nI think you guys should separate because\nI want you both to be happy yeah and\nwe'll be happy and then they stay\ntogether until like three years ago okay\nthey never separated until now and I\nfeel like they're so much happier and\nfulfilled because of it but they were\nthinking they were staying together for\nthe kids yeah and and as a kid I was\nlike no no no no like I don't think\nthat's so interesting Yeah well yeah I I\nthink when my parents got divorced both\ntimes it was the right thing they got\ndivorced twice so they're not together\nnow yeah my dad's remarried and my mom\nhasn't but uh\nboth times I think it was the right\nthing to do I wasn't actively\nencouraging it when I was younger uh it\nwas traumatic for me when I was younger\num but\num it was the right thing to do yeah how\nare you finding that now being a parent\nyourself like what are the what are the\nparts of this journey that kind of\ninfluence your approach now because you\nare aware that we are not perfect any\none of us yeah I'm aware we're not\nperfect but I I do feel I think Chrissy\nand I both really believe in the idea of\ncreating like stability in our home for\nour kids showering them with love and\nencouragement teaching them about what\nit means to be kind what it means to be\nloving what it means to be generous what\nit means to be passionate about\nsomething and pursue it\num all of those things we want for them\nand we want them to see in us a loving\nrelationship\num that teaches them what love is\nsupposed to feel like and what it's\nsupposed to be like I want us to be the\na great example of what love means for\nthem and how they should expect a\npartner to treat them how they should\ntreat their partner I want to be a good\nexample for them and I think Chrissy\ndoes too and\num yeah I don't want to get divorced I\nknow that yeah yeah like I really truly\nyou know and\nyou've come from a situation where\nyou're like well they should have gotten\ndivorced this is the right thing for\nthem to do but but I also I'm like oh\nI really want a stable home for our kids\ntotally and I want them to\nbe surrounded by love and to see in us\nan example of what love means and\nhopefully we can maintain that for\ndecades and decades to come like I want\nus absolutely to be grandparents having\nthem over for Sunday dinner and like I\nwant that for us yeah I wish that for\nyou too definitely that's beautiful and\nand I I don't disagree with you I think\nthe point you made there is so clear\nthat you want what stability means and I\nthink what sometimes adults don't\nrecognize is staying together is\nunstable sometimes it is sometimes yeah\nbut there's always going to be some\nunstability instability of course but I\nthink that's the challenge like we\nusually see togetherness as stability\nand breaking up as instability but often\nif two people are together but it's\ncausing more stress for everyone else\nthat's true and there's definitely\ncircumstances like that yeah uh God\nforbid that happens to us no no no of\ncourse\ndefinitely no and and by the way it's so\ninteresting what you're saying because I\nliterally just spoke I just interviewed\nuh Dr Gabor mate and he's like a a\nhealing and Trauma expert and researcher\nhe's like in his 70s I think right like\nand so he's been doing this his whole\nlife like looking at trauma looking\naddiction looking at children and he\nliterally just said well you just said\nwas like you can't love your kids too\nmuch like you know giving them a safe\nloving environment and I think for a\nlong time I confused love and safety and\nand I realized like safety was really\nwhat you needed as a child yes you\nreally do yeah I really truly believe\nthat and we want to have them feel safe\nand surrounded by love and care\num it doesn't mean you don't want to\nallow them to make mistakes\num but you do want them to feel like\nthey can make mistakes in safety and I\nthink\num uh when people feel unsafe uh it\ncontributes to fear contributes to\ntrauma uh and a lot of things that make\nuh their responses unhealthy as they get\nolder because\num if they're dealing with so much fear\nand danger in their lives it affects uh\nthe way they respond to stimuli it\naffects the way they deal with fight or\nflight and all these things that kind of\nthese mechanisms that your body has to\ndeal with trauma and and fear like if\nthey get activated too much then it's\nhard for them to cope with life yeah\nabsolutely when when someone's as\nexceptional as you are of what you do\nI want to hear about like what was the\nhardest part about getting that good\nlike what was the CH when was it\nchallenging to pick up an instrument or\nor learn an element of music like what\nwas the was there ever or did it just\nwas it just so natural and effortless\nthat it's always been that way oh\nthere's always effort and I think um\npart of it is like figuring out what you\nwant to specialize in what you want to\ndo really well like I play the piano\npretty well but I'm not like an expert\nconcert pianist like I've seen what they\ncan do and I can't do it and and\num I got good enough at the piano to\naccompany myself to accompany others to\nwrite and to perform live but people\nthat focus on playing the piano are much\nbetter at playing the piano than I am\nwhat I've chosen to focus on is being\nthe best singer-songwriter that I can be\nso I spent a lot of time focusing on my\nvoice focusing on songwriting so those\nare the the two most important things\nfor me and those are the things that I\nspend the most time and energy on and\nit's not easy to write songs and it\ndoesn't come automatically but I've\ndeveloped ways of getting\ngetting to that point where I'm pretty\ngood at writing a song and\neven my worst songs are pretty good\num that didn't come automatically though\nit came through like just writing a lot\nlistening to a lot of music but also\nwriting a lot of music and trying\ndifferent ideas\nseeing them work\nand collaborating with other people who\npush me and bring out the best of me and\ngive me new ideas\nall of that made me a better writer but\nit wasn't easy and it wasn't automatic\nyeah there's often a perception that\npeople have\nthat the way you write songs or whatever\nis that when someone's going through\nemotional turmoil\ntheir artistic expression is heightened\nand then when their external\ncircumstances are less stressful it can\nbe harder to find creativity is that\ntrue is that accurate or have you found\nthat you can always or you have a method\nto always tap it because your songs are\nlike your lyrics are highly emotive your\nsongs are about real issues in your life\nit doesn't matter whether you're\nexternal life has changed how have you\ncontinued to be able to access that\nbecause I think some people think oh\nwell my life was hard I wrote my best\nmusic and now that my external life is\nsimpler because there's no easy life my\nexternal life is simple I kind of find\nit harder to access I've\ngotten so\num experienced at writing that I can\nturn it on pretty much at any point but\none of the ways I do that is by bringing\nother people in the room right and so\nthat way you're not always relying on\nyour own inspiration which may be hard\nto summon sometimes\num and I think because I've been such a\npromiscuous collaborator\num it enables me to stay refreshed as as\na creative person because\neven if I don't immediately have an idea\nI could be in a room with someone who\ndoes and then I can bounce off of that\nbuild on that and we can create\nsomething together and then also have\nquite a bit of methodology around my\nsongwriting that makes it easier for me\nto tap into my creativity and tap into\nthat inspiration so that when I have it\nI'm able to go from inspiration to\ncompletion in a way that's tried and\ntrue for me and that's why I spend a lot\nof time on in the master classes just\nexplaining you know like this is my\nmethodology for writing a song the\ninspiration is going to come from\ndifferent places sometimes it comes just\nfrom I dream about a song and I sing it\ninto my phone and uh and remember it\nthat way record it for later and then go\nto completion when I uh when I go back\nto the studio and like and sit down to\nwrite but either way the inspiration is\ngoing to come at some point sometimes\nit's just a riff that somebody else\nplays or a beat that someone else plays\nand then it leads me into a vocal Melody\nand a vocal Melody leads me into like a\nfeeling of like this is what this song\nfeels like to me this is what the story\nis that I want to tell and then I know\nhow to build a song pretty easily from\nthose kind of seeds of ideas and\num yeah that's what I spent a lot of\ntime on in master class is just teaching\nthat once you get this seed of an idea\nhere's how you take it to a complete\nsong and it works really well for me\nbecause\nit makes it so that I can write\nonce I have the idea right pretty\nquickly yeah and I think I want to\nunpack that for everyone because I think\nfrom anyone that I've sat down with who\nI believe is Extreme extremely high\nperforming in their space obviously\neveryone on masterclass is at that level\nin their field and then when I've sat\ndown with people like Kobe Bryant as\nwell or like Novak Djokovic or Jennifer\nLopez is like everyone always talks\nabout this balance with what you're\nsaying perfectly is like there's\ninspiration and then there's regulation\nthere's like actual methods processes\nstructure it's like we all think that\nthere's a Magic Moment which it sounds\nlike there is but then that magic needs\nto turn into a method yes in order to\nactually turn into something beautiful\nabsolutely and and the people that you\nwere referring to like Kobe he was so\nnaturally gifted so he he had this\ngod-given gift to be\nthis amazing athlete but\nhe took the gift which some people have\nand don't maximize it like he did he\ntook that gift and worked so hard\npractice so hard spend so much time in\nthe gym like\nthere needs to be more to your\nyour ability than this natural ability\nit needs to be cultivated needs to be\nhoned it needs to be practiced and with\nsongwriting I've gotten to that point\nwhere is not just oh I have a gift for\nmusic oh I can sing Oh I uh have a good\near it's oh I've spent a lot of time\nhoning my craft as a songwriter and it\nhelps me uh figure out how to take this\nidea and make it a song that works yeah\nand I love how everyone's different like\nI completely agree with you like when\nI'm doing this it's like even though I'm\nnot in the same field as you you could\nsay something I'm like oh that I need to\ndo more of that I think I mean and when\nyou when Kobe passed I spent a lot of\ntime just thinking about\njust like what it takes to be someone\nlike him and I think it really inspired\nme it's like you really like if you want\nto be great if you want to be like World\nchangingly great at something you got to\nput in the time and energy to do that\nand it can be inspiring to see examples\nof that in the world and then say yeah I\nwant to be more like that yeah well even\nwhen you're given the example of when\nyou're in the studio and you're bringing\npeople in like for me the podcast is\nlike that like I sit down with people\nthat I'm not in the field of a tool yes\nand I get to I'm like oh that's how they\ndo in their field how can I apply that\nyes to mine and I think that's what Moss\nclass does great but because we had Russ\non the rapper and he was talking about\nthe opposite where he was like I don't\nlike having anyone in the room with me\nbecause if people are in the room with\nme then I don't get to be silly or I\ndon't get to be totally expressive so he\nsaid to us he was like I get rid of\neveryone and then I make weird sounds\ninto the microphone to see what works\nfor me whereas if my boys were there he\nwas saying if my boys were there he was\nlike they'd all laugh at me yeah and so\nI'm wondering who who do you like having\naround you like could you give us an\nexample of some people that you've sat\nwith that you're like\nand they don't have to be even people\nthat we know they could be other people\nbehind the scenes but someone that\nyou're like oh yeah when they're in the\nroom they kind of sparked me this way or\nthat way well I I take his point yeah as\nsaying you don't want people around that\naren't\ntotally bought in creatively because you\nwant people in the room that are in\nthere to create something beautiful with\nyou and if they're there to be like\nyou're kind of\nwhat my sense is I don't know him yeah\nand and I don't know his friends but\nwhat I'm my sense is that he's saying\nlike\nhe might want to be too cool around them\nyes and if he's too cool around them he\nmay not come up with the best art yeah\nand um I think it's important to have I\ndon't have random people in the studio\nwhen we write like I have only writers\nin the studio and we just sit there and\nvibe off of each other and and see where\nthe vibe takes us and hopefully\neverybody's bought in to the idea that\nwe just want to make something amazing\nand something beautiful and something\ninteresting and something that's a great\nsong and they're not worried about being\ncool not worried about anything else\nother than let's make this great that\nidea of being around people that you're\nokay to make mistakes around be Fearless\naround like that's the kind of people\nyou want in the room and we just try\nthings and I try not to have an ego\nabout my ideas so that means if like I\nwell I do a thing called a Mumble track\nusually where I just Mumble a melody and\nsee if we like it and some of the other\nwriters in the room may do the same\nthing and I'm like oh I like their idea\nbetter\num than mine and I think you need to\nhave that openness to other people's\nideas that humility when you're a\ncollaborator\num and so I think part of what I'm\nreally good at is that Spirit of\ncollaboration so I understand that all\nthe great ideas don't need to come from\nme and that\num\nI can benefit from this other energy and\ncreativity in the room and be open to it\nyou know be humble enough to receive it\nand not think that it all has to come\nfrom me yeah egolessness is hard though\nlike that's like especially as you\nbecome more successful like I think\nthat's something people struggle with\nbecause you have to trust yourself to\nsome degree so how did you you think so\nwell the interesting thing about ego is\nlike the people that you think of that\nhave big egos also very insecure so it's\nlike\num it's very interesting thing about\nthat combination of\nthe inflated ego\nand\nthe heightened insecurities at the same\ntime and it can be very debilitating\nwhen that's the issue because a lot of\ntimes when you hear well this artist\nwhenever they come they won't let you\nlook at them they want this and that and\nwhat I hear when I hear that is not oh\nthey think so much so highly of\nthemselves I think oh they're pretty\ninsecure probably\num and so it's interesting thinking\nabout that and what that means and what\nthey kind of I don't know what this\npsychology is behind that but it's an\ninteresting combination that I've\nobserved in the world is that people\nthat are seen as having big Egos and\nbeing difficult to work with are also\nusually pretty insecure exactly I think\nyou spot on when I started the show when\nI started interviewing people I noticed\nthat too where there was natural social\nanxiety and a lot of people were just so\nused to being on when the camera was on\nthat that's when they came into full\nforce but then when the camera was off\nit's not that they didn't care it's that\nthey didn't even know how to connect\nbecause they've been so trained in that\nway and so you're right I think it's so\ninteresting that from the outside we can\nbe like oh that person has an ego or\nthey're being arrogant or they're you\nknow they have a\nthe braggadocious or they have a Lovato\nbut it's not that it's yeah my\nassumption is that they're probably\ninsecure that's usually my assumption\nyeah yeah no that's well said I'm going\nto give you a bit of context before this\nnext question because I I so my wife\nwe've been married for 10 years now uh\nsorry manifestics has been together for\n10 years and she my team was looking at\nthe other day and she was reading a book\nand they were like oh what are you\nreading because you're taking the cover\noff and they can tell and she's like oh\nI'm reading my husband's book like it's\nin my book which I wrote two years ago\nnow two and a half two years ago and\nthey're like what have you not read it\nlike most of my teams read the book and\nshe hadn't and they're like no no she\nwas like no I never got around to it you\nknow I read bits and like so my question\nis I had Chrissy said something similar\nwhere like she sees the name of a song\nand then she's like wondering like wait\na minute how did he call that the name\nof the song is she your number one fan\ndoes she listen everything or or do you\noften find that like she's catching up\nwith everyone else well she doesn't love\nhearing like demo versions of songs so\nuh she doesn't like to kind of be in the\nsausage making part of the album yeah uh\nand so she'd rather hear it once\neverything's done and so that ends up\nmeaning that she's like learning about\nthings when you know close to win a lot\nof other people are learning about them\ntoo\num and so yeah there are times when\nshe's like oh news to me yeah but she\njust doesn't like to be in early on the\nprocess because she's found I think from\nwhen we first started dating that when\nshe fell in love with demo versions that\nwe change them so much that she didn't\nlike you know\num kind of falling in love with the\nearly versions because it kind of almost\ndisappointed her when the finished\nversion was out because she felt like\nless connection to it so she decided she\njust didn't want to be involved early on\nin the sausage making well she has good\nreasoning my wife just didn't have time\nfor me but but I I find that's\ninteresting in couples right the idea of\nlike we were talking about being a good\nexample as a couple and trying to build\nthat loving relationship like I find\nthat in an immature stage in my\nrelationship I constantly wanted my wife\nto be my number one fan like I there was\na time where I was like I wanted to read\neverything and listen to everything and\nwatch everything and share everything\nand like this I'm talking about like\nmaybe like seven eight years ago and\nthen as time went on I just started to\nrealize I was like well she's not with\nme for those things right like she can\nsupport them and appreciate that sure\nbut she's living with the real me and is\nexperiencing that like I guess my\nquestion is like how do couples\nappreciate and admire each other in an\neffective way when often we just lean on\nour partner for validation and\nglorification often yeah I still really\nwant Chrissy to be into my work I love\nit and and I think more so because like\nit just feels good uh to know that she\nhas good taste and and she loves music\nand that she likes something I did like\nyou know I'm like that's awesome and I\nwant her to love it and I respect her a\nlot and I trust her a lot and I feel\nlike she has good taste so if she likes\nsomething I did and she especially likes\nit then that's a really good sign for me\nyeah\num so it feels good like it's not that\nI'm insecure about it is that like I\nreally want her to love it yeah I want\neveryone to love it but I want her to\nlove it more\nI know I'm the same I was doing\nsomething recently but but my wife's\nalso the person that will give you the\nmost honest feedback yes like I will\npractice a presentation or whatever I'm\ndoing in front of her and she will just\npick it apart but I know she's doing it\nout of love because she also wants me to\nbe incredible at what I do and we help\neach other so much uh and we believe in\neach each other and we support each\nother so much so you know when she's\nworking on a cookbook I'm you know\nhelping her I'm tasting stuff I'm doing\nwhatever I can to help and\num you know we collaborate on a lot of\nbusiness things together so there's a\nlot we do together but she doesn't like\nto be in in the weeds of my music\ncreating uh career but she goes a lot of\nmy shows she always has feedback for\num you know how we can put the show\ntogether better be more effective at um\nyou know the set list and arrangements\nand different things like that she has\nideas about how it should look and uh\nshe's giving me great feedback over the\nyears on that kind of stuff so I'm\nalways happy when she's proud of me and\nwhen she's excited that's when you know\nI feel very like okay yeah we're doing\nsomething right here yeah no I feel that\nI can relate to that too I'm like if I\ndo something and my wife's happy it's a\ndifferent it's a different format like\nmy Vegas show like I'm so proud of it\nbut\num it was especially\ngood for me to hear that she was so\nproud of it yeah and and so uh excited\nto show her friends and you know tell\npeople about it because that just it was\nlike\nit's an extra good feeling when when she\nsays that yeah definitely no I relate\nand I think the question came from I\nthink it was when she said something\nabout when she saw the song title uh I\ndon't love you like I used to I don't\nlove you like I used to it and that's an\ninteresting it's a great song it's for a\ncouple because it's like\num when you go through things together\nyou learn more about each other you grow\nand it's not the same kind of love you\nhad when you first met yeah\num when we first met we were like very\nattracted to each other it was it was uh\nour chemistry was great\num but that level of attraction is more\nlike infatuation at the beginning of a\nrelationship and love when it is able to\nstand the test of time it has to be\ndeeper and more like uh more real than\nthat we've been through enough together\nwhere it's like really fortified us and\nmade us stronger and those tests have\nmade us grow together and and\nyou know realize things about each other\nthat we didn't know and going through\nall of that makes you be able to write\nand sing a song called I don't love you\nlike I used to it's different now yeah\nbut it's better yeah yeah I love that\nsong because I I felt the same way I was\njust like that is such a great title\nbecause you're like oh no what's going\non and then you're like no actually it's\ntrue yeah and I think the challenge we\nlove is that we we've been programmed to\nbelieve that it should stay the same\nyeah we've been programmed to believe\nthat you should go recreate your first\ndate and everything should feel like\nyour first date and it's almost like\nwell what if it got better you know what\nif there's more what would you like when\nyou met Chrissy and how have you evolved\ndo you think as a as a man as a human as\na person like what what has evolved and\ngrown about you in a positive way well I\nthink I was more selfish then\num like I wasn't a great partner at the\nbeginning of our relationship even\nthough I was very into her and and\num very excited to be with her like I\nwas still selfish fish I was in my you\nknow mid-20s still like you know not\nready to fully be like the committed\npartner that I am now but you know once\nyou really figure out that you love\nsomeone and you're really like love so\nmuch about them and you really want to\nmake it work with that person like you\nhave to decide like I'm going to do the\nthings I need to do to be a good partner\nin this relationship and I've just grown\nuh as a person because of that too\nbecause when you stop being so selfish\nwhen you think about not only the joy\nyou get from a situation and the\npleasure you get from it but also think\nabout your responsibility and your\ncommitment in that situation I think you\njust grow and you mature and that's you\nknow I think part of it's just a matter\nof time you need time to become that\nperson that you want to be I think in\nyour mid-20s you're still dealing with\nimpulse control you're still dealing\nwith selfishness you're still figuring\nout what you want to do in your career\nall these things are happening but\num when you figure those things out you\ncan just be a better person in general\nand I think it makes you better at other\nthings too when you're when you're able\nto understand that balance between what\nyou're trying to get from a relationship\nbut also what you need to give to make\nit work yeah what did you think that you\ndidn't value about her in the beginning\nbut today like you're like oh I noticed\nthat more now like I I didn't even get\nthat at that time because of my\nimmaturity Holiness well I feel like\nI've just learned so much about her\npersonality how she reacts to stress how\nshe reacts to life how she can find a\njoke even in like the craziest even in\ngrief like she's able to find humor and\nlike I feel like you see\nso many things about your partner as you\ngrow together and as you experience\nadversity together and what I've seen\nfrom her just made me love her more and\nvalue her more uh like I think she's\ncooler now than I've ever thought she\nwas like I just really\nhave seen her in all kinds of situations\nI just value her more and and and all of\nher more than I ever have been that's\nbeautiful that's great I I wish the same\nfor my marriage too it's uh I wish it\nfor everyone honestly I I love love I\nwent to two weddings this weekend oh wow\nand like I truly like I can I when I'm\nat these weddings like I genuinely get\nemotional and I genuinely feel like joy\nfor this couple uh in in embarking on\nthis journey together and I love\ncelebrating that I love\num seeing it flourish and and seeing\npeople who are committed to each other\nmake it work like I love it yeah no me\ntoo I love love too I've just written a\nwhole new book about love yeah it comes\nout next year but it's like I I\nofficiated two weddings in the last 12\nmonths and the difference the pressure\nand the honor of doing that my whole\nthought person my head is don't cry\ndon't cry because I love love so much\nand all I want to do is like cry and\njust like appreciate the moment I\nhaven't had to officiate any weddings\nI've sung at quite a few yeah\nbut uh yeah I got emotional this weekend\nand I think part of it is being a dad\ntoo now because\nuh when I watch uh the bride's dad walk\nher down the aisle I got super emotional\nI was just thinking about my daughter\nand thinking about my son and just\nthinking about you know just what it\nmeans to pour all this love into these\nlittle people and and then to watch them\ngrow up and and experience life and find\nlove uh it was beautiful that's amazing\nI love that I love that I know you\nmentioned grief and then you uh the song\npieces in the new album yeah there's\nthere's the Beautiful lyric let your\nbroken heart learn to live in pieces and\nI just I literally just haven't stopped\nthinking about that because I think that\nthere's so much about us that's\nconstantly trying to get everything to\nfit and even with the heart we're trying\nto become whole again like there's\nalways that concept but you're like let\nyour broken heart learn to live in\npieces like where did that come from\nlike that well idea the idea of the song\nis that\nwe never completely shed or forget this\ntrauma that we may go through in life\nthis loss this heartbreak like we'll\nremember it there'll be times when we'll\nfeel those pangs of of memory that it'll\ncome back\num it doesn't mean you can't heal it\ndoesn't mean you can't recover but it\ndoes mean that that grief will will\nstill be a part of who you are a part of\nyour story\neffectively recovering from that means\nnot forgetting it not that it didn't\nhappen but learning to live with it and\nlearning to continue uh to live with it\nand and and experience life and Joy and\nPain and all the things that come in\nlife afterwards\num continue to like live on yeah\num despite the fact that this grief\nwon't ever leave you completely yeah\nit's almost it's almost like we're\nasking the wrong question where was like\nhow do I move on how do I get over this\nand you're saying well you're saying\nyou're gonna I'm saying you're gonna\ncarry it it's part of your life now it's\npart of your story part of who you are\nlike I said with Chrissy like I've seen\nso much growth\nthrough our grief and through our\ntragedy it's always going to be part of\nwho we are and I'm fine with that like\nit's part of who we are it's we carry it\nwith us and and it's okay yeah and that\nand I'm sorry for your loss and you know\nthat\nI mean I don't think there's pretty much\nanything harder to go through than than\nwhat yeah I've never been through\nanything harder but it just means you\nknow when you live long enough you're\ngoing to go through something like that\nuh and\nfiguring out how to continue to live as\nyou carry that with you yeah is um is\nwhat the song's really about yeah and\noften we find that those traumatic and\ndifficult experiences can break people\napart but you you focus on growing\ncloser together yeah what what do you\nthink is that difference like you your\nvalues are so clear I can tell in this\ninterview I'm like values of children a\nfamily of love of kindness of connection\nlike how do you in moments like that is\nit that your values just drive you\nforward or like how do you make sure\nbecause I think sometimes people just\nhave experiences that derail their\neverything else that's going right yeah\nand I don't know because like I think\npart of it is just we are we were\nalready on a great Foundation where we\nreally respected and loved and enjoyed\nbeing with each other respect each\nother's values and the ways you know\nwait well the things that we saw in each\nother's character that we fell in love\nwith were still there but I think you\nalso have to like commit to\nworking through pain you know\num and I think we both committed to\ndoing it like doing the work that we\nneeded to do to get through it yeah no\nI'm happy to hear that and you know my\nprayers and thank you yeah yeah\nand I think having already had two kids\ntogether was\num definitely helpful because\nthey just bring so much joy into our\nlives and and laughter and\nfun and they they're a great Focus for\nour energy yeah and so even when you're\ngoing through deep grief on losing a\npregnancy you still have these two\nbeautiful babies that you love yeah and\nI think that was certainly helpful yeah\nnow now the questions are moving into a\nselfish space where I'm asking just for\nme now uh so how have you managed like\nwhat if you know you've always had this\nbeautiful relationship you've got you've\ngot two beautiful children that you both\nlove and you know when I think about me\nand my wife like we also spend a lot of\ntime saying look let's stabilize our\nrelationship first before we think about\nhaving kids because we don't want to\ninvite beautiful new Souls into a\nrelationship where we're not sure where\nwe're going or how we're working\ntogether how have you managed to be\nso career focused and successful and\nkeep your relationship successful with\nthis because I find a lot of people\nhaving children can be the most\nstressful time of their life right it's\nstressful I mean first of all we're very\nfortunate we have lots of people around\nus to help us we can afford you know\nchild care we can afford a lot of things\nthat there are plenty of families that\ncan't afford having that is no small\nthing like those having help having my\nmother-in-law around having you know\ngrandparents around to help is like all\nthese things are very helpful and they\nalleviate some of the stress and make it\neasier for parents to balance it but\nyeah I do think you have to be ready uh\nto take on that responsibility I think\num a lot of times you know it's about\nfiguring out is it the right time in\nboth of your careers to do it\num particularly for the woman like it\ncan be very difficult to figure out when\nthat can be because uh particularly in\nAmerica we don't have a lot of leave\nthat's available for uh maternal or\npaternal relief that's available for a\nlot of families\num and there's all kinds of obstacles in\nthe way that make it harder for people\nto be working parents and so I think a\nlot of people are making decisions about\nwhen to have kids based on that and\nthat's a real like practical\nconsideration that needs to be figured\nout for you to be able to handle it\nbecause a lot of the stress around\nparenting is around having the resources\nand the child care that you need and\nwhen that's not right it can be\nstressful it can be stressful in your\nmarriage it can be stressful and so many\nother things and so\num yeah it and and my prescription that\nall those things need to be in order is\nlike a hard prescription to fill though\nbecause it's like it takes resources it\ntakes family it takes you know\neverything being aligned and\neverything's not going to be perfect for\nso many families and they're still going\nto want to bring a life into the world\nand and and yeah it's it's a challenge\nyeah no absolutely and I think those\nthings changing I mean yeah when I was I\nwas born and raised in London and so\nwhen I worked there like the maternity\nleave and the paternity was was\nfantastic I mean it could be even better\nbut it was great it was like at least\nsix months and then you could extend for\nanother six months if you needed it and\nnot to be nerdy but like these are\npolicy things that can affect people's\ndecisions you know we're having a lot of\num conversation around Reproductive\nRights and and whether the state can\nforce people to have kids and what I\nthink our conservative uh fellow\ncitizens should realize is that people\nsometimes would like to have kids but\nthey're not in a place to be able to\nafford it or take care of it and so if\ntheir policy\num Solutions like child tax credits uh\nfree child care\num that would make it more likely that\npeople would choose to have kids and\num uh I think there's so many families\nthat could use that kind of support\num and I feel like one way that we could\ncome together conservatives and\nprogressives is say if you really\nbelieve in this idea that families are\nimportant as like a foundation for our\nsociety and you want to do things to\nsupport people having children in their\nlives and and building families like one\nway to do that is make sure they have\nthe resources uh to uh to make that\nchoice in a way that they can handle it\nand their family can handle it yeah is\nthat one of the areas that you've been\nfocused on as you were speaking about\nearlier with has that been an area of\nfocus for you well this is something I\nthink about all the time so I think\nabout it when it comes to our schools\nmaking sure our schools have the\nresources that they need making sure our\ncommunities have the resources they need\nand it's it's kind of the impetus behind\nmy entire political kind of uh\ninclination is how do we make our\nsociety more livable more loving more\njust more\num Equitable and how do we support folks\nwho don't have the resources they need\nright now how do we make sure they get\nthose resources yeah and so a lot of\ntimes\nmy work has been about the criminal\njustice system but what I like to do is\npoint out the choices that we make\naround\ncriminal justice and\nhow they are resource choices as well\nthey're more interconnected yes they're\nmore connected because because when we\nspend so much of our societal energy and\nresources and budgets on policing and\nlocking people up that necessarily\nprecludes us from investing that money\nin other things and so\nmy advocacy work has really been around\nlet's invest in these things that are\nedifying that are building that are\nproductive that are loving that are just\nand\nnot invest as much as we have in the\nthings that are more destructive and\nmore about the state monopolizing force\nand violence\num through policing and jailing people\nyeah thank you so much for going nutty\non us it was good we we had to no it's\nimportant you know I think it's I think\nit is important to see the\ninterconnectedness of a value of you\nknow Family Man children and then how\nthat actually scales up to an economy\nand a society because we can have these\nin our small units yeah but it needs to\nchange it uh and I get into arguments\nyou know with with friends of mine who\nI'm close with and you know they they'll\nsee these news stories about crime going\nup and robberies going up and and and\nthey'll always kind of default to well\nwe just got to punish people more like\nmake them scared to do these kinds of\nthings and what I'm always thinking\nabout is well how do we create a society\nwhere just less of that is happening how\ndo we create a society where people are\nhealthier they have the resources they\nneed they're not\nhomeless they're not\naddicted to drugs and when they are\nthey're being treated and not punished\nlike how do we create Society like that\nand then a lot of these issues with\nviolence and with uh property crimes and\nall these other things they'll go down\nif we're investing in the kind of\npreventative measures that would uh make\nus healthier in general yeah absolutely\nyou were speaking about you know the\njourneys of people like from everyone\nthat you were homeschooled around or in\nyour community like the journey that\nyou've taken is that I'm guessing\nobviously that's very unique it's very\ndifferent uh when you when you look back\non your life now it's like hey what's\nthere like what keeps you going and when\nyou look back what do you look back at\nand go that was really special that was\nbeautiful and and that was something\nthat I always cherish what keeps me\ngoing well part of it is just the joy I\nget from creating new things\num it's a very like amazing sense of\ngratification\nuh that you get when you walk into a\nroom and nothing exists\nexcept you know loose ideas in your head\nand then a few hours later like you walk\nout with this new thing that exists it's\na song and like that song could be the\none that changes your life it could mean\nsomething to all kinds of other people I\nI just uh at the wedding I went to one\nof the weddings I went to this weekend\nsome guy said I went to your show and it\nactually saved my marriage and like I\ncould be writing that song and save\nsomeone's marriage uh tomorrow and the\nfact that I get to go to work and create\nsomething brand new that didn't exist\nbefore is such a joy and I truly\nlike I want to do it all the time that\nkeeps me going yeah and then\num being on stage is really exciting for\nme and fun I love the connection I feel\nwith the audience I love when the show\njust feels like everybody's clicking on\nall cylinders we're doing this together\nwe've got band members dancers singers\neverybody came together to put this show\non and we get it right and we feel the\nenergy from the crowd and we feel the\nlove from the crowd and we're giving it\nto them they're giving it back\nand we feel this connection and this\nchemistry this energy that we're all\ncreating together\nI love it I truly love it and I want to\ndo it as long as as long as people will\nlisten to me\nI think it is gonna be a long time\nwho's someone that you spoke about\ncollaborations who's someone that's no\nlonger with us that you would have loved\nto have collaborated with in person or\nthat you think could have like brought\nsomething out of you that Nina Simone\nI'm a big Nina Simone fan I named my\ndaughter Luna Simone after her and and I\num\nhave always loved her Artistry and\nI would just love to jam with her it\nwould be so fun she's such a great\nmusician and has such a cool approach to\narranging songs she always did such\ninteresting covers of songs too like she\nwould do like the definitive cover of so\nmany songs Just because her musicianship\nand her point of view was so interesting\nI would love to just soak in that for a\nlittle while yeah and what about someone\nwho's alive that you haven't\ncollaborated with yet or someone that\nyou find inspiring in any field of music\nor anything uh Kendrick Lamar I love it\nI was good to see his show it hasn't\nhappened yet no like I've worked with\nalmost every rapper in history yeah\nexactly but uh Kendrick I'm truly a fan\nof and I went to go see a show this\nweekend and uh love his new album love\nall of his albums I just think the level\nof artistry and care that he puts into\neverything is just so impressive he's\none of my favorite artists in any genre\nright now I think he's just incredible I\nlove that when you're working on an\nalbum like how much\nbecause you are someone who works\nconsistently on an album for a long\namount of time before it comes out right\nlike there's not always new music all\nthe time what kind of in that creative\nprocess like how do you stay inspired in\nthe ups and downs and the Ebbs and flows\nof a long creative process which is rare\nnowadays like when you've got something\nlike Kendrick right like everyone talks\nabout Kendrick is someone to work on an\nalbum for a couple of years which used\nto be the norm and it's uh it's still\nannoying for me like yeah that's what I\nmean yeah yeah I feel like making an\nalbum is about a two-year process for me\nand I try to put them out every two or\nthree years but you're not always going\nto be inspired every day yeah but\nthere's always another day and you know\nmost albums you know around an hour a\nlittle bit less a little bit more I did\na double album this time it's an hour 20\nminutes but like over a two year period\nI'm gonna have enough inspiration to\nmake an hour\nyeah yeah that's right uh so there will\nbe days when you know you don't feel it\nand\num like I said one of my best ways of\ncombating any kind of writer's block is\nhaving other energy around me and other\ncreative people in the room so that I\nfeel like okay I can get inspired by\nthings that are outside of my own head\nyeah um and so I think that's important\nscheduling the time to write I think is\nimportant rather than just kind of\nwaiting around for inspiration randomly\nto hit because you need I think you need\nto actively summon that uh rather than\njust kind of uh\nhoping it'll uh gonna knock you over the\nhead every once in a while yeah you need\nto actively summon it and so for me\nscheduling the time is important too\nyeah do you have any like weird quirks\nor habits to help someone that moment or\nlike some kind of things that you need\naround you or any items or things you\nneed to see or is it more like just\nscheduling planning structure and then\nyou you want the inspiration to come and\nlike it could come from a movie you saw\njust a line from the movie uh\ninspiration could come from a song you\nlisten to in the car on the way to the\nstudio\num inspiration could come from just a\nrandom conversation you had where just\nthis line like stuck out to you and then\nlike I said before a lot of us do\ncollaboration so a producer may come in\num and he have a track or she'll have a\ntrack and\nplay it for you and it's just music but\nit speaks to you and you'll feel\nsomething from it and then build a song\nfrom that\num and so those are different ways the\ninspiration comes yeah what's been the\ndifference about the first day when you\nstepped into Studio like to now when you\nstep in like what were the emotions and\nthe feelings then what's changed what\nstayed the same well I think I have a\nbetter understanding of\nwhat I want to do now when I go in the\nstudio I think\num before I just had less creative\nconfidence I think and I've earned it\nthrough just worked yeah like time work\nrepetition like I just written a lot and\nwhen I walk in the studio now I just\nfeel like I know how to write a song I\nknow how to write a really good song and\nI just need to like work on it I need to\nspend the time spend the energy\nand do all those things to get inspired\nlike I said before and then I'll figure\nit out yeah John you've been so uh\ngracious with your time and energy thank\nyou I have loved this conversation this\nis fun we've gone everywhere like we've\njust we're talking about relationships\nwe talk about children we talk about\nyour childhood like it's been so\nbeautiful we we end every episode with\ntwo segments uh one's a Fast Five quick\nquestion so one word to one sentence\nanswers okay and then I'll tell you\nabout the other one so John Legend these\nare your Fast Five all right uh question\nnumber one what's the best advice you've\never received I love Quincy Jones advice\nhe says still from the best nice that\nmeans you know be open to being\ninfluenced and like take some of that\nuh listen to different artists uh that\nyou love and like\nthink about how to incorporate their\nArtistry into what you do and I think\nthe more I know this is longer than a\nsentence it's good it's good I think the\nmore the more you do it yeah you just\nstart to develop Who You Are\nbut it's informed and inspired by all\nyour influences yeah love that answer\nyou're you're allowed it's good and\nyou're allowed to go uh question number\ntwo what's the worst advice you've ever\nheard or received\nI don't know I don't really catalog bad\nadvice one thing we laughed about was uh\nKanye didn't like the\ntitle Ordinary People for a song wow\nyeah yeah of course he changed his mind\nafter a while but yeah\nhe was like can you come up with a\nbetter uh but it went out that way it\nnever got changed no it never got\nchanged yes but it was his idea he was\nlike can you come up with something\nbetter to say than that but uh uh\neventually he fell in love with it and\nended up directing the video for it and\nuh and uh it became you know obviously\nand a very important song at the\nbeginning of my career but we always\nthought it was funny that he was like\nI'm not sold on this Ordinary People\nidea\nI love that question number three uh\nwhat's something that you used to value\nthat you don't value anymore oh I don't\nknow\nwell I mean we just go through different\nphases in life and I think I wanted you\nknow like a certain kind of Freedom uh\nwhen I was younger\num when I Was A Bachelor and you know\nyou like treasure this kind of freedom\nand living like without as many\ncommitments but then you fall in love\nand you have kids with someone and then\nlike the commitment and the and the\nresponsibility is like it's it's like is\nlife defining in so many ways and uh you\ndon't value that that kind of Freedom\nthat you thought you wanted before yeah\nthat's a beautiful one so we never never\nhad that answer before that's that's a\nspecial one all right question number\nfour the podcast is called on purpose so\nhow would you define your current\npurpose in life my purpose is to bring\nlove into the world\num it's so much the core of who I am\num artistically but also politically I\nthink love is like I'm not religious\nLove Is My Religion yeah that's\nbeautiful and Fifth and final question\nfor the Fast Five is if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow what would it be\nwoof one law we asked this to every\nguest so you're getting us the same\nquestions as every guest\noh\nwell what happened I want to go back to\nlove one another yes keep it simple yes\nyeah that's very Christian that's like\nthe part of our uh Jesus's uh two\nCommandments were that you would love\nGod and that you would love your\nneighbor as you loved yourself and if\nyou think about that idea of loving your\nneighbor as yourself\num it's a pretty powerful idea\nabsolutely and if that were to guide our\nbehaviors and our politics and and and\njust the way we treated each other it\nwould be you know pretty good world to\nlive in absolutely absolutely all right\nand these these ones are going to be\nshorter this is uh a segment called the\nmany sides to us and so again this can\nbe one word for each one literally one\nword so what is a word to describe what\nsomeone would say about you meeting you\nfor the first time calm definitely you\nwere very calm when you came in today I\nwould I would have to agree with that we\nwalked over you were very calmly yeah I\ndon't have a lot of like highs and lows\nuh I'm very even kill through life which\ncan be frustrating like as a partner\nlike Chrissy would like for me sometimes\nto be a little more Dynamic but but I\nthink you know it's also like it's a\ngift and a curse because when you're\ngoing through like tough times and you\nneed stability and you need a rock\naround you I can be a rock well that's\nwhy you need the humor in this one today\nexactly that's why we're good together\nyeah that's my wife too my wife's the\nspontaneous one I'm not even gilwell\nyeah that works for us all right\nquestion number two what's a word to\ndescribe what someone would describe you\nthat knows you very well I think\nhonestly so much much of how my friends\nwill describe me as that I'm an even\nkill person that I'm a calming presence\nand that I don't have a lot of highs and\nlows so I think people that first make\nme think that the people that know me\nfor a long time think that as well oh\nthat's good that's not a bad thing all\nright question number three what is the\nword this time you can't say the same\nanswer okay because we're gonna have the\nsame answer but the first two made sense\nwhat is the word you'd use to describe\nyourself\ncreative I love\nI love to create and I love\nputting new things out into the world\nyeah what's a word that someone that\nmaybe doesn't agree with you would say\nabout you well let me think let me go to\nmy Twitter mentions\nwell I think people that don't know me\nyeah you know they don't they know me\nyou know they know that I call myself\nJohn Legend that was an assumed stage\nname I wasn't born that so they probably\nthink I'm pretty arrogant\num you know I don't think I am but you\nknow I could give off that uh sense that\nyou know I'm pretty arrogant right okay\nall right and question number five the\nlast one what's a word that you're\ntrying to embody love love\nI love it John Legend everyone uh the\nmaster class on songwriting John Legend\nteaches songwriting is available right\nnow I hope you go and subscribe to\nmonster

can not wait I I can I become\na good songwriter John that is the\nquestion even though that's a good\nquestion I did great for the theory I\nfeel like there has to be some level of\num foundational musical understanding\nyeah\num to use my class but I think if you\nhave that it can be really helpful well\nI did grade five Theory I played piano\nup to grade four yes and I used to play\npercussion but I haven't done it since I\nwas 12. and you may need like a\ncollaborator like an instrumentalist\nlike a guitarist or a pianist with you\nto help you kind of have some music\ntheory because I can't in my class I\ndon't teach you a lot of like how to\nplay the instrument of course but I\nteach you how to take the knowledge that\nyou have and build a song from it\nabsolutely I love it John
