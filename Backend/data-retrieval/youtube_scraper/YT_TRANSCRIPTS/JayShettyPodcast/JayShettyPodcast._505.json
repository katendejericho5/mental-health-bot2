    "transcript": "i never want to be in the position of\nlife where things don't excite me or\nmake me nervous absolutely i never want\nto stop preparing if i'm not super\nnervous that means i don't care about\nthe outcome and i always want to care\nabout the outcome out of all your\nsuccesses all your achievements what's\nbeen the most meaningful thing for you\noh that's a tough question besides this\nmoment right here sitting with you\num this you know i used to be\nembarrassed with this answer but i've\ndecided i'm now deciding i'm not\nembarrassed by this answer this is my\nanswer okay my answer is\ncollaborating with the rock that is\nhonest and i know that seems kind of\nlike surface level basic but i'll tell\nyou why when i was younger he was my\nbiggest inspiration like i wish i could\ntake you back to little lily's bedroom\nwith posters of the rock all over my\nfirst email address was the rock\neighty-five at hotmail.com just obsessed\non the announcements when they'd call my\nname in elementary school they say lily\nthe rock sing like literally it was an\nobsession so they always say don't meet\nyour idols because they might not be who\nyou want them to be\nhe is so incredible and not only getting\nto work with him and meet him but just\nhaving him as a mentor who kind of like\nguides me and gives me advice it's been\na dream come true to know that this\nperson i looked up for so long is such a\ngreat human being yeah and that's really\nimportant and that's the i think that's\na beautiful answer i don't judge you for\nat all i think it's incredible when your\n15 year old self would high five you for\nsomething right like yeah it's like\nthat's not it's not only the vanity of\nlike he's so cool and famous in the rock\nand he's so hot he's very hot but it's\nalso just like\noh this person has proven to you that\nyou can work really hard and be really\nsuccessful really rich really famous\nreally nice and i think that's the\ngreatest lesson you taught me is you can\nstill be a good person even if you have\nall those things and you've built a real\nrelationship with like that's the most\nspecial thing too i feel like yeah my\ngoal is just to build enough of a\nrelationship with him where in our next\nlife we get married so i'm really trying\nto like pave that foundation\ni love it it seems to be going well i\nmean yeah yeah i'm i feel good about it\ni love it i used to be a huge rock fan\ntoo i remember reading his used to\nautobiography still is yeah it still is\ni mean like when i was 15 16 i remember\nreading his autobiography and just being\nblown away oh yeah i had it too i\nwrapped it in saran wrap you did okay i\ndidn't go that far but i remember it\nbeing one it was one of the first books\ni actually read yeah and it was just\nsame actually yeah and it was just and i\nonly read it because i was so into\nwrestling and i was like oh wow let me\nget this book and it was just\nmind-blowing i couldn't believe it that\nthere was so much to someone that i just\nsaw as a wrestler\namazing\nyeah this is why this podcast is\ndedicated to\nthat's right that's it right no i love\nit awesome no and that's a great answer\nthank you thank you for being honest\nthat's a great answer and it is\nbeautiful to see your childhood dreams\ncome true or dreams that's the best part\nof this whole journey truly nothing\nfulfills me like when i can hear the\nlittle lily inside me going oh my god i\ncan't believe you're doing that i never\nwant to be in the position of life where\nthings don't excite me or make me\nnervous people ask me all the time like\nare you still nervous before you go on\nstage or are you so nervous to shoot\nwith this person or meet with this\nperson i hope for as long as possible my\nanswer can be yes because if it's not\nthen like what's the point i want to be\nnervous and excited\nthere's the challenges of life disappear\nyou know yeah i love that i was so\nnervous when we came to film the collab\nover christmas\ni was so nervous yeah i was so nervous i\nwas like i've loved you for so long i've\nwatched all your videos for so long like\nyou're a pro oh my god and i was just\nlike literally jay came to my house and\nliterally did hundred times better than\nme and was 100 times more professional\nthat's what happened\nbut no i believe in that as well like\neven now when i'm speaking and i've\nkeynoting's been probably the biggest\npart of my life for the last 13 years\nand every time i'm on stage like someone\nsaid to me you know something like yes\ni'm nervous i totally get what you're\nsaying you care absolutely i never want\nto stop comparing if i'm not super\nnervous that means i don't care about\nthe outcome and i always want to care\nabout the outcome i love that and i\ncompletely agree with you totally\naligned i wanted to go back the same\nperson where i'm i was a monk\nyou are a monk oh my god i am\nwe're the same level of wokeness yeah\nthat's what i really want you to take\naway from this uh yeah i want everyone\nto talk now\ni agree but jay came to my house and did\na b2k move he kept doing this weird\nthing with his hands and like weird why\ndo you keep doing this\nsorry we went\nhe kept doing this cool thing with his\nhands and i was like what are you doing\ncan you just do it again for a second no\ni can't do it with a mic in front of me\nit's hard it's an excuse\nand then he's like it's a b2k move and\ni'm like\nwe're we're gonna we're best friends\nyeah yeah and the simpsons and so many\nothers anyways anyway anyway yeah back\nto you back to you i want to go back\nbecause i know you've talked about this\ni've heard you talk about it in\ndifferent places i think it's important\nfor us to do this thing is we both share\nasian parents i want to talk about your\nrelationship with your parents\nand how that has evolved over the years\nof seeing you start doing something that\nwas obviously not something that asian\nparents wish their kids to do oh yeah no\nthey were thrilled yeah to now them\nbeing famous from it right right well i\nmean when i first told my i always say\ni'm very fortunate because when i first\ntold my parents i want to make youtube\nvideos\nthey just didn't understand what i meant\nyou know they were like no there's no\nway you're not allowed they didn't give\nme the typical answer of what will\npeople think which is generally what\nasian people say sure they were just\nconfused like what do you mean and i\nsaid this is a site called youtube i'm\nmaking videos give me a year they said\nyou have a year to try this out if it\ndoesn't work we want you to go to\ngraduate school but you have a year so\nthat gave me a countdown to really just\nteach myself how to edit teach myself\nhow to use a camera i have a degree in\npsych so i don't know how to do any of\nthis stuff truly i researched figured\nout how to edit on imovie like it was\nmade a tripod out of books did all of\nthe things\nfortunately it went somewhere and so my\nparents are very supportive\nnow today because it went somewhere but\nboys said my parents never said no to me\ndoing this and that's a really big deal\nbecause it's scary and i always say\nparents just want to make sure you're\ngoing to be okay you know when i was\nyounger i was like my parents just don't\nwant me happy that's why they say no but\nno when you grow up you realize your\nparents\njust want you to be okay they want to\nknow that we came to this country i want\nto make sure she's going to have a good\nliving and be financially stable and\nthat's all they're concerned about\nreally yeah and once they saw that i\ncould be they were like okay we can stop\nstressing out about this yeah i love\nthat and we need more parents to be that\nway i guess yeah i love the idea of them\njust giving you away and i think it's i\nhonestly think it goes two ways though\nand i think this has come with age like\ni said really putting yourself in your\nparents shoes is something that i\nlearned especially when i moved to l.a\nyou know i was the first person in my\nfamily to move to another country for\nwork it's not because i got married it\nwas for work and so that was a really\nbig deal especially as an indian woman a\nhuge huge deal\nand the more i had to the more i grew up\nand the more i moved away from my family\ni realized why they do the things they\ndo why they say the things they do why\nthey think the way they think and it's\nthey're from a different time and place\nand they're honestly trying their best\nand they've done a great job so when\nevery time we do have a little bit of\nfriction i have to remember that\nthis is all very different from what you\nwere used to so i get why me making\nvideos on the internet is scary like i\nhave to accept that you know you're so\nwoke i try see here we go this is right\ni mean what you're saying is so\nbeautiful there's there's an amazing\nstatement that i remember i can't\nremember where it's from but it's uh the\nday you realize your parents are right\nyour kids are telling you that you're\nwrong\nso my mom always just said that to me\nuntil you have kids you're gonna see and\nyeah and now i have a dog so i get it\nbecause sometimes i'll be arguing with\nhim and he's telling me things and i'm\nlike oh my god my mom was right about\nthis so yeah yeah no but i love that\nrefreshing perspective i i think you're\nspot-on as well like i was very\nfortunate my parents have always been\nextremely open to every one of my\ndecisions even when i talk about\nbecoming a monk and then people were\nlike well your parents not just and i\nwas like actually they weren't they were\njust like make sure you take care of\nyour health and make sure you take care\nof yourself like it was so much more\nopen than you'd believe right and you're\nright when you grow up you you start\nvaluing that no 100 thank you for that\nlesson yeah of course\noh you're welcome yeah you're like\nyou're like dropping lessons here now\nand i think anytime i talk about my\nparents i always without a doubt get\npeople commenting being like well my\nparents just don't get it my parents\nwould never support it and i don't want\nto sit here and pretend like i know\neveryone's parents or i know your\nsituation there very well may be a\nsituation where\nthe reality of the situation is maybe\nyeah sometimes the people closest to you\ncan be toxic for your life i'm very\naware of that reality but i do think\nit's worth that effort and that genuine\neffort to really get to understand why\nyour parents are the way they are i\nthink it's it really helps you\nunderstand yourself as well i love you\nno i really do think that so i'm not\nencouraging anyone to be in a situation\nthat's like toxic to them but i just\nknow when i recall from my teenage years\ni used to write off things as toxic all\nthe time be like they just don't get it\nwithout actually even trying to\nunderstand put yourself in your in their\nshoes before exactly you write it off\nthat's great advice i love that i love\nthat and i guess it's so much more\nhealing and liberating too to do it that\nway around rather than just be like\neveryone hates me exactly like my\nparents hate me like exactly yeah\nwhatever you say is true i've always\nthought you can build your universe so\nif everyone hates me then yeah everyone\nhates you yeah you know that is what it\nis how do you get so wise\nyou know\ntumblr quotes\nno i've had i've had many\nopportunities in life to dive deep into\nmy soul so i think i've done that\nseveral times yeah yeah tell me about\nsome of that yeah i think\nyou know the reason i started making\nyoutube videos in 2010 was because i was\na very sad person i was at the end of my\nuniversity career i was getting a psych\ndegree i didn't like what i was doing in\nschool\nmy whole life i was believed like i was\ntaught to okay you're gonna go to\nuniversity then you're gonna get out of\nuniversity you might go to graduate\nschool you're making a job then you'll\nget married then you have kids and i\njust couldn't grasp that very linear way\nof living and so when i was at the end\nof my university career i was like oh\nwell i'm not ready to do any of those\nthings and i actually have no idea what\ni want to do and so i was in a very dark\njust sad place and so\nmy career on youtube was founded through\nme really digging inside myself and\ntrying to find something that made me\nhappy so the only reason i made youtube\nvideos because it made me happy not\nbecause of views or money that wasn't a\nthing do that it wasn't anything that\nwas the thing it was literally to make\nmyself happy yeah so and when i look at\nyou and you can see that it's like\nwhat's kept you going that long because\nthat's the beauty of it right like then\nyou did it to make you happy and i know\nthat that's still a big part of your\nlife today right but like what i admire\nabout you the most is like you're still\ndoing it and that's harder yeah i think\nyou know i've really analyzed what it is\nyeah because if i'm being really odd\ni think isn't good i've honestly learned\nthat i loved making youtube videos i\nstill do but then i got to a point in my\nlife where i made so many and it became\nsuch a business and such an overbearing\njob where i was like\nit's not as fun and i'm not enjoying it\nas much and i think that happens to\neveryone when your passion and your job\nkind of collide like that\nbut\ni forgot where i was going because i got\nstressed i was like oh my god my life is\nin chapels but i think what it is is\nthat why i've kept going for so long is\ni'm really obsessed with the idea of\ngrowth it's always been a thing i really\nlike challenging myself i like growing\nand so now that i've you know i did the\nimovie thing now my life is kind of like\ncan i build a team and you know how\npassionate i am about my team as well\nthis can i build a business now can i\nnow increase my social good efforts it's\nalways about just growing in some\ncapacity so i really think that\nthis desire to not waste time and not\nwaste opportunities and not waste\nthis life is honestly what drives me\nbecause i know what it feels like to not\nlike life yeah so i don't want to go\nback to that place i think it's\nimpossible that's awesome no it's so\ntrue if you're not moving forward you\nhave to move backwards yeah so it's that\nkind of experience\nwhat he said what you said is my answer\nyou gave a much better answer i love\nyour answers your answers are amazing\nthank you it's it's it's amazing because\nit's it's honest like when i'm hearing\nyou\nit's it's great to hear a creator say i\nstopped loving creating it so i shifted\nlike it's amazing here you being that\nvulnerable and honest and open and we\nare going to get into that about you\nknow the recent break you took from\nyoutube and everything like for me\ni fell in love with you more when you\nsaid that like i was just like that's so\nspecial for someone to say that like\neven even me sometimes like when i'm\nsaying no to things that i say no to now\nfor before i say no i have to just say\nwait a minute i would have died to get\nrid of tuning in one day yeah and i have\nto just be grateful before i say no\nbecause it's like if i just say no and\ni'm like oh yeah now now it doesn't\nmatter it's like you're losing that part\nof your life that one once upon a time\nthis is what you wanted right right and\nit's such human nature yeah i feel like\nso much of my job is recognizing human\nnature and then\ndeveloping habits that literally go\nagainst it\nthat's the prime example\nsame with me there's so many\nopportunities that come my way where i'm\nlike\noh i don't want to do this or i don't\nwant to try i don't i don't want to\ntravel to this place where before i\nwould be like dying the first person\nthat ever hired me international was\nactually london first place that ever\nhired me internationally i was over the\nmoon that someone would want me to\ntravel and now i hear myself being like\noh my god a trip to\nsome beautiful place that sounds\nexhausting so i had to like stop myself\nto be like whoa you're being ungrateful\nyou need to put yourself back get it\ngain a healthy perspective because human\nnature does allow us to get used to\neverything you'll get used to everything\nyou take a hundred trips to a vacation\ndestination you're gonna be like uh i'm\nsick of it something you would have\nreally died to do before so i really\nthink a lot of my job is just checking\nmyself in those moments and being like\ndon't do this don't go to this natural\npattern of just becoming ungrateful yeah\nand for anyone listening and watching\nright now that's an awesome tip like\nthat's an awesome tip awesome insight of\njust whenever you catch yourself getting\nused to something familiar to something\na person a place\nsomething happening in your life\nwhatever it may be just catch yourself\nyeah and just switch catching yourself\nis half the battle no one's perfect but\ncatching yourself that's that's where\nthe real honesty comes in yeah\nabsolutely yeah just being aware yeah\nabsolutely and you were talking about\nsocial good and i wanted to talk about\nthat for a bit because\nand and you've got to remember like for\nme this is an interesting interview\nbecause even though we only met last\nyear for me it's like yeah i've been\nwatching you for so long\nso it's it's a very\nthis is the best for me it's it's it's\nthat's an interesting point because\ni've kind of been watching from a big\ndistance like we didn't know anyone we\ndidn't have any friends in common we\nhaven't known each other\nand and i just i was like wow like she's\nusing what she's doing for social good\nand i i would love that i was like wow\nlike you're using your platform for a\nhigher purpose when you don't have to\nwhether it's girl love whether it's\nunicef like all the amazing work you've\ndone tell me where that started like\nwhere did that come about in the whole\nlilly singh journeying world and and how\ndid it become such an integral part yeah\nyou know i when i first started to\nrealize that people were calling me\ntheir role models i remember i sat down\nwith myself and i was like\ninteresting people are calling me their\nrole model how do i feel about this and\ni made a rule for myself that was you\nwill never do anything\nthat's not genuine to be perceived as a\nrole model that was a very big rule for\nmy sanity i was like you can't your job\nis so 24 7. you can't start being like i\nbelieve in this this this to be a role\nmodel if you actually don't so my rule\nhas always been to be myself having said\nthat when i garnered such a large\naudience and i understood that i had an\ninfluence i was like well\ni have the opportunity to also do\nsomething positive with this and i feel\nin my heart that if i don't do something\npositive with it it's just a wasted\nopportunity now add that with the grudge\non my shoulder from being an indian\nwoman\nand you have this really large desire to\nhelp issues around gender equality i\nthink that's where my heart lies the\nmost a lot of my work is around\ngirls being able to go to school and\ngirls having equal rights in parts of\nthe world and access to health care and\nall that stuff that comes from the fact\nthat you know when i was born a lot of\npeople were unhappy with having an\nindian girl especially because i have an\nolder sister so we're a family of two\nsisters and so many people were so sad\nat my birth literally um and so i've had\nthat grudge on my shoulder and i know\nthat quite transparent like i can say\nthat very honestly my whole life has\nkind of been a little bit of i'm going\nto prove you wrong and i'm going to and\ni always say don't work hard to prove\npeople wrong prove your lover's right\ninstead i always believe in that\nhaving said that there's a lot of people\nsuffering because girls are born and and\nso i do feel a strong passion in my\nheart to do something with the following\ni have\nyou know\ni think that's the the greatest when you\ngo back to one of my greatest\nachievements the one that's not as shiny\nas the rock\nis actually when i announced my world\ntour the first one a trip to unicorn\nisland i made sure i did it in india\nfirst that was important for me to\nannounce it in india my parents\nmotherland and i went to punjab\nto visit my dad's dad\num my grandfather and he\ngreeted me with like flower guns and he\nsaid something to me where i was like\nwhoa probably met him like three times\nin my life maybe and he goes\nyou know i was wrong you are the girl\nthe person and a girl in our family who\nhas had the most success\nand that was like a huge statement for\nhim to make because\ni remember what it was like for my mom\nwhen i was born and so well i don't know\nwhere she told me but yeah so that was a\nreally big achievement for me that's\nhuge yeah and it was also i like felt it\nfrom my mom my mom was like damn\nstraight oh you know and so like i have\nthat force where my mom like was like no\ni have a second daughter and like she's\ngonna be awesome and she believed in me\nand i just hope i've done justice to\nthat i think you've done so much more i\nthink it's amazing to see someone\ndefy cultural traditions and someone\nwho's especially i didn't realize that\nit was that like somewhat closed off\nwhen you were born as well around the\nbelief of having a girl etcetera you've\nlike blended no but even even me like\ni you know i was just working on writing\na script and that's when i really like\ndived into my childhood and i was like\nwell i had my wedding entrance song\npicked out before i knew what i wanted\nto do in life yeah like that's not who i\nam today but as a young girl that was\ntrue it just goes to show how much it\nwas better in my mind that my\noptimal achievement would be getting\nmarried yeah you know what i mean so and\nso i just don't want to continue that\npattern whatever i can do with my\nfollowing to teach young girls that\nyou can get married that's great\ncongratulations that's fine but that\ndoesn't have to be your defining big\ndefining moment you know what i mean i\nthink that's important i agree tell me\nabout some of the stories of\nthe girls you've worked with and amazing\nthings that have happened or oh my god\ni've you know what every time i meet a\nyoung girl i've had the opportunity to\ngo to so many parts of africa\nspecifically in south africa so many\nparts of india and i meet these young\ngirls and they tell me stories i'm like\nwhoa look you are way more\npowerful and cool than i will ever be\ntruly because they do some like\nawesome awesome stuff\ni just met a girl recently um who talked\nabout the fact that in the community she\nlived in in south africa\nthey didn't have a certain program in\nher school and so she walked to whoever\nwas in charge of this i mean forgive my\nlack of terminology or whoever was in\ncharge of whatever that school board was\nlike\n17 hours to go there and then when she\nwent there they're like yeah we'll look\ninto this case and we'll get back to you\nand they never did so she walked back\nof like there's girls doing amazing\nthings in the world that i'm just blown\naway by and it's even more inspiring to\nme when i hear these stories so i think\nif all of you had opportunities that we\nall have like think about the space the\nworld would be in right now yeah all of\nthese amazing people that don't have the\nresources and don't have the opportunity\nit's just they need it the world would\nthink about how many cures we would have\nhow many more inventions we would have\nhow many solutions we would have all\nthose people with brilliant ideas were\nempowered with resources especially\nbecause they've seen pain so fast\nright yeah i couldn't agree with you\nmore that's a beautiful point and and\nthat's it's great that you're using your\nvoice and platform and that they're\ngetting a voice from it too yeah that's\nhonestly what i want to do it's not even\nabout like girl love being lily is the\nchamp it's\nthe people who have the really good\nideas i want to just lift their voices\nbecause i have the platform to do it\nit's not about my ideas it's not about\nmy beliefs it's not about me it's really\nabout just lifting the voices that don't\nhave a platform absolutely yeah i\ninterviewed one girl recently\nwho actually doesn't even know her\nactual age because she escaped from a\nchild slavery\nlike space and we i interviewed her on\nthe podcast and i was just like blown\naway like you know being put into that\nterrible position from day one not\nknowing your age like never knowing who\nyour real family are like not even\nhaving people to trust and actually not\neven knowing that you're in a bad space\nand then running you know yeah that's\nreal not even knowing you're in a bad\nspace yeah and not even knowing that\nthat's bad because that has become your\nnormality right right it's crazy but\nyeah thank you for everything you're\ndoing though and i mean it's truly a\nteam effort it's true it's not only\nmyself and my team but it is very much\nso my following as well because i know\nthat there's so many\nfan bases online that\nreally want entertainment really want to\nlaugh my audiences like that but they\nreally care as well yeah they really\nanytime i do a campaign whether it's a\ngirl lover with unicef or with wii they\nare really behind it and so my following\nis a lot to think as well yeah yeah\nthank you for having attracting such an\namazing following yeah\nyeah it's awesome i absolutely love it\nso also my posture is horrible so if\nyou're watching this i apologize\nlily's ladies being comfortable i mean\ncomfortable\nyeah can you help me fix that what do\nyou want is there a way to meditate we\ncan't we can we can talk about it okay\nokay yeah we'll bring that in yeah i'm\ngonna try it you have great posture do i\nyeah oh thank you i think it's all the\nballet i did as a kid did you really no\nbut uh\ni was my mom tried to get me into it at\none point i feel she'd be really great\nat that for some reason that's worrying\nyeah yeah i don't think i'd be that good\nat it next video i did guys\nbut i want to talk to you about this you\nknow recent announcement that you made\naround taking a break from youtube i'm\ngoing to take an anxious gulp of my\ndrink do it\ndo it i i when i saw you do that and i\nthink i reached out to you and you did\nit i was like it was extremely brave i\nthought it was super sincere\nit was really genuine and i and i looked\nand i was just like again you're just\nbeing a real model like you know being\nsomeone that people can look up to to be\nable to do that i can't imagine how hard\nthat is to do\nlike it's it's so tough to be able to do\nthat and i want to acknowledge that\nthank you thank you it was yes yeah it's\nso tough to just turn around and tell\neveryone that you're doing this for that\nhey i'm taking a break because i want to\nmake content with better quality and\nstuff i'm really excited about like the\nway you explained it i was just like\nthis is so real\nand and i think it's we live in such a\nlike click bait world of like people can\nsay anything on social to get clicks and\nit's like when i watched that i was like\nwow this she's being so real thank you\nvery much it was just so real and i\nreally want to acknowledge that and\nrecognize it thank you i appreciate that\nit was really difficult you know\nespecially it was really difficult\nbecause of the obstacles and reasons i\ncreated in my own mind\ni my whole brand is also harder\nproductivity every day\ndo as many things as you can and i\nbelieve i believe in working really hard\nso for me to then turn around and be\nlike i'm gonna take a break and not work\nhard was very difficult not just from a\npublic standpoint but for even me\nbecause there was a voice inside me that\nwas like\nis this because you're lazy or is this\nbecause you're making excuses and i had\nto really learn as i talked to you\nearlier the word balance i had to\nunderstand i think it really hit me hard\nbefore that break was i'm not being the\nbest version of myself because i haven't\ngiven myself that little bit of balance\ni need and so actually if i want to\nhustle harder i need to take this break\nthat was the biggest moment of clarity\nfor me um and so it was really tough for\nmyself my fans were super supportive um\nbut in that break it was about a month\nit wasn't a super long break but in that\nmonth what i allowed myself to do was\nthink and i know that sounds very\nso can't you think any time but the\nanswer was no because my life was so\nwork work work come home work be so\ntired go to sleep without addressing any\nof the cloudiness i had in my brain\nthere were so many days where i got home\nand i was like this thing is really on\nmy mind but okay i'll do it later\nbecause i have to do this email i'll\ndeal with it later after write the\nscript and so there are so many of those\ni'll deal with it later that i never\ndealt with it later\nand so really during my break i just sat\nand i thought and i cleared some stuff\nin my brain and i started writing things\nin my journal\nand i came to the conclusion that yeah\ni could be happier if i took more time\nto create the art i'm so passionate\nabout and i've made a whole bunch of\nchanges in my life that were prompted\nfrom that one month break that i'm very\nhappy about tell me some of the personal\nlessons that you garnered in that month\nof things you wanted to change uh yeah i\nyou know so funny when people\nthis is interesting people you probably\ndo this all the time when people tell\nyou about their problems you give such a\ngood answer but you don't apply to\nyourself 100 all the time so people will\ntell me about like fatigue and i'll be\nlike it's okay it's okay to take a break\nit's okay to be balanced like it's okay\nto re-energize the best part of hustling\nnever did it never took time for\nanything to do\ni got my nails done during the break and\ni was like i am such a well-balanced\nhuman being right now i tweeted about it\nfour times while i was getting my nails\ndone ruined my nails it was a whole\nthing but i think the life lesson i\nlearned was it does not mean you're\nbeing\nunproductive if you're taking a break\nit actually helps to be more productive\nso that is something i've learned um\ni've also learned that\nif you i'm big on loving yourself i\nalways teach my audience that the most\nthe most difficult thing you can learn\nto do in life is love yourself but it's\nthe most important um loving yourself\nalso means it's okay to ask for help and\nso you're not okay so that was a big\nthing i tweeted all about finding a\ntherapist and all that stuff where\nbefore it's not that i thought it was\nwrong but i think you know we grew up in\na culture what's a little taboo 100 you\nknow what i mean you hear a lot of older\nasian people being like when we were\nyounger we nothing was ever wrong with\nus and we didn't eat so i think learning\nthat was was a big deal during my break\nand also just like\nputting priority into my relationships\nwith something i really and that's\nsomething i say and joke about in my\nvideos all the time like haha i'm single\nhuh i never know friends but\nthat's so sad\nnew friends funny\nbut i think in that break i also learned\nthat that takes effort and if i'm really\nhonest\ni am constantly surrounded by people i\npay to be near me and so\nit's also a reality of like you need to\nfoster relationships with people you\nalso do not pay to be around you your\nfamily my siblings my friends back home\nand you need to know that they don't\nwork for you so when they say\nlily shut up we're not doing what you\nwant to do like that's what friendship\nactually is you know what i mean and so\ni had to really work on that yeah i also\ncooked a few more times oh wow yeah\nthese are real life lessons yes\nthese are amazing thanks and and this\nand you're so right we're all so great\nadvising everyone else 100 we're all so\ngrateful people ask me for advice all\nthe time and i'm like okay here's what\nyou do but literally sometimes my life\nis in shambles true yeah yeah i can\nrelate i can relate it's so it's so true\nit happens all the time and i think just\nthe fact that you were brave enough to\ndo that to take that time out it's a\nit's a great lesson for everyone else\nout there who needs to do the same i\njust started this year without not doing\nany work in january at all which\neveryone was like how can you not work\nin january like that's like the yo you\ngot to get going and i was like yeah\nbecause i needed to go in i needed to\nmeditate and i needed to reflect and i\nneeded to just go and have space and i\nfelt it just coming back i was like oh\nmy god i've got so much more space to be\ncreative creative now and so many more\nideas are coming to me and all the rest\nof it and and like you said like it's\nit's not a substitute it's not like\nyou're being lazy right you actually\ncome get to come back to do better you\nknow what doj i have to tell you i don't\nread all of the comments i get one\nbecause there's a lot in two because my\nsanity but i did see a comment when i\nsaid this i was like oh being taking a\nbreak makes you more productive and then\nsomeone wrote a comment and it really\nlike made me think and their comment was\nthat's a really privileged thing to say\nbecause people can't take breaks and it\nmade me think and i was like i totally\nunderstand this perspective and so i\nthink you know for the people listening\nor watching this\nif you are because it is true we're\nprivileged sitting here like oh we got\nto take a month off work and cool but i\nthink it's also just about\nif you can't take a month off work even\njust taking\nsome more\nspace for your mind\nis what i'm trying to get at you know\nabsolutely\nwhere i came back to work and it's not\nlike i'm i'm much happier now because\nafter work i take time to myself and i'm\nmaking decisions that make me happier so\ni thought that was a really brave\ncomment to make of course my initial\nreaction was like later but then i was\nlike no let me actually think about this\nand that's really true like if you're\nnot in the position to be like oh let me\ngo away for a month or let me take a\nbreak from work i still think there's\nlittle ways you can balance your life\nand make yourself a priority there we go\nyeah i love it no you're so right thank\nyou for grounding that actually that's a\nbeautiful way of putting it and you're\nright and that's the truth of it like\nwhether it's one\nhour whether it's one day a week one\nhour a week whatever it is one day we\nhave it could be as simple as having a\nconversation with someone that you've\nbeen having tension with yeah you know\nit could be as simple as calling someone\nyou haven't talked to in a long time and\nlike grounding yourself with an old\nfriend it could be very very simple it's\njust making time for those little\nactions i think 100\ni love that advice i sound so smart\noh my god jeez\ngood job i wasn't expecting any less\noh yeah this is like no but it's great\nthis is what happens and for everyone\nlistening and watching this what happens\nwhen you do the work like when you're\nactually taking a break when you're\nactually thinking about this stuff when\nyou're being honest with yourself the\nnatural it's honestly if i had to pick\none it's being honest with yourself it\nreally is and i think i learned that the\nhardest with girl love you know girl\nlove for those of you that know is my\nsocial good campaign that's women\nsupporting women\nit was such a hard\nit was such a hard journey for me\nbecause i myself have caught myself\nvarious times\ncompeting with other girls i think it's\nnatural like all of us have this thing\ninside us every once in a while so for\nme now being like girl love i'm all\nabout girl love i'm wearing the pin\nright now but then inside being like oh\nthis girl is like i had to check myself\nso hard wow and really learn how to be\nhonest especially because i was pegged\nas like\nthe girl on youtube you know the colored\ngirl on youtube and\ni had to\nbelieve truly and i do believe now that\nit's not about being number one it's not\nabout it's about how many more girls can\nnow do this because i've done it yeah\nyou know what i mean and so girl love\nhas taught me to like really in the most\nhonest way check yourself i think that's\nwhat self-care is i think that's what\nself-love is it's about\nlooking those nasty habits and thoughts\nand beliefs you have right in the eye\nand being like i don't hate you for\nhaving this but we're going to work on\nthis you know and it's the hardest but\nthe best way it is the hardest thing to\ndo yeah 100 it's the toughest thing to\ndo\nhow do you how did you do it in a way\nthat it didn't bring you down like how\ndid you look at those\nnegative things\nand then not start judging yourself and\nbeating yourself up about it and take\nyourself down rather than use it as a\nway to lift yourself up how did you do\nthat i think i did it through\nquite simply changing it i think once\nyou identify the parts of yourself you\nwant to improve you then have a choice\nto say okay i'm going to continue to\nignore this or i'm going to make\npositive change so i i'm a very\npragmatic person i believe everything\ncan be like scientifically it can to-do\nlists broken down every part of me like\nyou should see me when i'm doing my\nreflection like to do to reflect on i'm\nlike very like that so when i recognize\nthese things i actually write them down\nyeah like this is a habit you have this\na thought you have now what are you\ngoing to do to change this step one two\nand three and then when i go back if i\nhaven't done step one two and three i\nknow who to blame i know what the issue\nis there's no mystery there it's laid\nout right in front of me and so when it\ncame to girl love specifically when i\nthought okay you are jealous of this\nsituation you don't feel adequate you're\ncomparing yourself to these girls i made\nactions one two and three one was reach\nout to the girl you're gonna have a\nconversation with this girl two would be\nfind out why you feel this way and\naddress that so there was very like\npragmatic steps on how to that's me as a\nperson\ni sound like a crazy person no you don't\nyou know i'm gonna i'm gonna share\nsomething with you right now when so\nwhen we were monks we we had to do a\nsimilar process in the sense of like\ngetting over so we would identify what\nwas wrong with us so things like ego\npride envy lust greed anger like the\ncommon things that we always wait greed\nis bad yeah\nyeah sorry\nyou gotta go to monk school to recognize\nthat one but we literally would write\ndown our\ninternal default dialogue like what do\nwe say to ourself when we feel envy for\nexample like oh why does he have that or\nshe has that better than me so we'd\nwrite down exactly what we say and then\nwe'd have to replace it with a new fresh\ninternal dialogue so we actually have to\nwrite out what we wanted to think so\nsame as your three actions like what do\ni want to think when i actually feel\nenvy like what do i want to choose to\nthink what do i want to select to think\nthat's so good it's the same thing\nthat's so good no it's exactly it's\nexactly the same thing and it works and\nit's just a natural monk you are there\nwe go we just keep coming back to this\nrealization\nthat the problem is beautiful that is\nreally awesome yeah but i love that\nbecause\ni feel so often when we talk about\nself-love and self-care and really\nanalyzing yourself internally people\nthink it is very abstract and they don't\nknow where to start and i know i felt\nlike that i don't know where to start\nhow do i fix this how do i even address\nthis stuff i think that's why my default\nis to go pragmatic is because it feels a\nlittle more um able to control and that\nway yeah\nwell it's good i think if you're not\npragmatic you then don't know what the\nsource of the problem is like you don't\nknow what to look at if you don't look\nat a process like you don't want to\nchange like a blanket solution it's like\ni feel envy okay i'm just gonna i'm just\ngonna try to be a better person what\ndoes that mean yeah what does that mean\nyou gotta really get in my book i call\nit send the gps deep nice i'll call this\ni believe we have like many layers when\nyou get to the real layer like why you\ndo something the way you do you have to\naddress it like that\nbeing pragmatic helps with that instead\nof just being be better be a better\nperson yeah be positive i just like\nquotes like that you know just just try\ntry believe i'm like no me believing is\nnot going to help these f issues i have\ndown here i've believed enough okay\ni have danced like no one's watching\nenough they're not fixing the problems\ndefinitely i'm glad i don't post quotes\nlike that just putting it out no your\nquotes are great actually jay's clothes\nare great no i'm just putting it no i\nagree with you i also formatted so\nnicely\nbut that's that's also the part of\nself-development and me being in that\nworld that was one of my biggest issues\nwith it and when i came into it was just\nlike i wanted to get away from saying\nthings that are easy to say right and\nthey sound good\nbut\nif if you give that to someone it's like\nwell they're like well how did it it's\nlike you're showing someone a picture of\nan amazing cake and say bake it from\nthis picture exactly no right so you\ncan't you need the recipe so you're\ngiving people recipes yeah that's 100\nalways my issue and especially in l.a i\nfeel like every time i'm on a red carpet\npeople go\nso how are you excited to be here and\ni'm always like yeah\nand i'm always like one day i just want\nto be like\nno you know what\ni feel like i don't i just genuinely\ndislike answers that have no substance\nor or ideas that have no substance i\nfeel like that's like a lot of the\nquotes you see online do that they have\nthis like\nshiny platter no substance and you don't\nknow how to apply it yeah yeah\nabsolutely well thank you for giving the\nreal trips be as pragmatic in this as\nyou like if you want to give steps you\nwant to give to do it it's my 99 stuff\nmy audience loves that like everyone\nwho's watching and listening will would\nlove for you to be as\nhack like no honestly i mean if they\nhave you leading them then there's\nreally nothing more i can provide i\npromise you i promise you i genuinely\ndon't believe that like genuinely others\ni won't be sitting here talking to you\ntell me about some other hacks and hit\ntrips and habits that you have daily\nweekly monthly anything you want to help\nme in my life yeah um\nokay this is again very pragmatic i\nthink i'm a nerd okay okay so i'm a big\nbeliever in removing as many obstacles\nas my days in my day as possible to be\nas optimal as possible right and so i\nevery time throughout my day something\ngoes even mildly wrong i write it down\nin my phone i have a little note and it\ncan be like really simple it can be like\ni'm driving in my car my lips are\nchapped i don't have chapstick i'm\nannoyed like it could be really really\nsmall or it could be like really really\nbig and then i actually dedicate time\nbefore i go to bed to solve those\nproblems\nfor tomorrow and so my goal is every day\nto have as\nlittle friction that i can control as\npossible because i know there will be so\nmany obstacles i can't control that will\ncome my way so whatever i can control\nwill be controlled and whatever i can't\ni'll be prepped\nthat is amazing yeah i love super small\nthings so you'll notice like i have\nobsessively have chapstick everywhere\nin my car in my desk um phone charger is\nanother thing i have them everywhere all\nthe time so i think it's just about\nunderstanding you can't control things\nbut things you can control to do i guess\nthat's one\nanother one i like that one a lot\nthank you another one is\nokay this is this is what i believe and\ni'm not admittedly not the best at\nputting it into practice i'll admit it's\na it is a quote actually i don't know\nwho said it but it's say what you mean\ndon't say it mean i'm a big believer in\nspeaking in straight lines so there's\nvery little room for assumption\nbut not being mean\nso i struggled with this because i i\nreally dislike confrontation\num and so when i have to tell someone\nsomething like you didn't do this so i\ndidn't like when you did this i'm\nhonestly like okay let me rehearse this\ni don't know what the hell to do here\nand so i find myself like really beating\naround the bush so what i've been trying\nto work at is\njust saying what i want to say but that\ndoes and in my mind that equals being me\nbut it doesn't yeah it's really just\ntalking to someone with respect still\nbut loving yourself enough to say what\nactually bothered you yeah so i'm\nworking on that still but that's that's\nan important one say what you mean don't\nsay me that's a great piece of it i\nthink\nour common friend humble is someone\nactually that if you guys don't know\nhumble poet he's super dope but i feel\nlike i communicate the best of everyone\nin the world with humble because we\nspeak in very straight lines yeah and\nneither of us\never get offended it's like i didn't\nlike when you did this yeah please don't\ndo it xyz he's like i understand i will\nnot and it's like done and i'm like\nwow that's like really great i just\ncan't seem to do it with other people i\ndon't know what it is\nwow yeah no i i think conflict\nresolution or like managing conflict or\ndifficult situations\nis probably one of the skills that\neveryone avoids learning\nbecause it's just so awkward or it can\nfeel awkward and it's like my feelings\nand their feelings and everything so i\nthink that's a great piece of advice\nyeah i think a lot of people benefit\nfrom that yeah i'm still working on it\nyeah yeah it's a hard thing but say what\nyou mean don't say mean i try to i try\nto say that in my mind before every\nlittle bit of confrontation also some\nthings that i consider confrontation\nthat really are not i'm like it's okay\nif you want extra glock they're not\ngoing to care\ni'm like i'm so so it's a canadian dude\ni'm so sorry\ndo you mind putting can i pay you to put\nextra guac this makes no sense why do i\nthink that's comfortable i'm a weirdo\nyeah no i think i think that's something\nthat we all commonly share yeah i used\nto do this weird thing where i'd say\nsomething really like straight to\nsomeone and then i'd follow up with\nsomebody saying something i'm not lol\nthat lol has honestly destroyed my\nability to confront people or emojis\nbecause i'd be like i really didn't like\nwhen you did this lol\nwhere really i shouldn't be doing that\nthat's my like buffer that's totally\nsame i used to do that all the time i\nthink i still do that sometimes i say\nsomething that i really mean and then\ni'm like trying to try to cover it for\nme it's like x you know x the little\nkiss there's like\nso x just want to say x there's like a\nwhole bunch i'm like stop doing this\njust stay with me\nyeah my sister is literally laughing at\nme right now because i probably have\ndone this multiple times\nbut i'm just so like i don't know i just\ni'm so scared of being mean yes but i\nhave to understand that it's not it's\nit's so like it's not saying what you\nmean with it's possible to say what\nthat'd be mean yeah and it's beautiful\nwhen like what you're saying about\nbetween you and humble like having a\nrelationship where you can have that and\ni think i'd want to encourage any anyone\nlistening to this with their friends etc\nlike build that relationship up where\nyou can give each other regular feedback\nright yes we're that relationship where\nyou can be honest with each other\nbecause wouldn't you want that and like\ni know all these things but it's hard to\nput into practice but wouldn't you want\na friend that like hey no one else is\ntelling you about this whack mother evan\nyou have so let me you know what i mean\ni feel like i would want that and so it\nreally makes no sense logically why i\nwouldn't do that for somebody but i just\nit's hard yeah no i definitely want and\nthat's one of the questions i wanted to\nask you actually is like how have you\nmanaged to continue to and you mentioned\nit earlier but to continue to keep and\nbuild meaningful relationships as your\nsuccess has grown as your business has\ngrown like how is that how are you\nmaking a priority in that and how hard\nis that\nyeah that's easy answer i don't yeah and\nit's hard it's really difficult i you\nknow i always say i i think i gave a\npercentage earlier and now i'm changing\nit 99 of my job is psychological one\npercent is actual work i always say that\nbecause once i start to get garner a\ncertain level of success my you know my\nfacebook inbox was full of\nso many old friends that are now really\nproud of me and you know and i'm sure\nyou were late as well it's a lot of\npeople your closest friends messaging\nyou because they need something or they\nwant something and so i've had to really\nlook at that and decide how i want to\nperceive that and for a long time it was\nnot positively it was i got a little\nbitter i was like oh well no you're\nyou're not my friend you're actually\njust someone that wants something right\nyeah but i've had to adjust my mentality\nto now think well\ndon't you want to be in the position to\nhelp people you know it's okay to love\nyourself enough to be like hey i have to\nrespectfully say no because i i'm not\nable to do this but\njust how i perceive it had to change for\nmy own sanity it had to change so now i\ni try to think of things of like\nwell why else would you want to have a\nsuccess if you can't help all these\npeople\nyou should think of it like that you\nshould want to help these people so\nsee it as a positive don't see it as\nsomething that sucks your soul that's it\nas a positive and so i've had to really\nwork on that trust is still a really\nhard thing you know people ask me all\nthe time when you meet someone new or\nlike how do you date doesn't it feel\nlike people just want to talk to you\nbecause you're super sometimes yes yeah\nsometimes yes it's true someone will\ntalk to me and then very quickly make it\ntransparent that it's because i'm\nsuperwoman you know um so it's been a\nit's been a delicate dance of figuring\nit all out but i am just now choosing\nto live my life\nbelieving\nand giving everyone the benefit of the\ndoubt of being like you know what\nit's okay if you're talking to me\nbecause i'm superwoman because i'm proud\nof superman i'm proud of lilly i'm proud\nof what i've built and i should want to\ntalk about it and it's fine\nthat's the only way and that might sound\nweird or unhealthy but that's the only\nway to really live my life without being\ncompletely bitter all the time that's\nnegative you know that is such a\nbrilliant answer that's amazing i don't\nknow someone watching this can be like\ngirl you stupid because you're gonna get\nused\nand i know that like trust me i'm well\naware that there will be people that\ntalk to me and have an ulterior motive\nbut but what's the alternative to then\nnot talk to know anyone yeah or to not\nyou know what i mean i'd rather just\nkeep people better for the dip well i\nloved what you said specifically about\nthe other option for you is to live in\nbitterness yeah exactly it's just being\nbitter like it's just being like oh\neveryone wants something for me so i'm\nnot going to talk to anyone and that\noption is\nso toxic yeah you and i i did that yeah\ni'm such an outgoing person i've always\nbeen very extroverted and i found myself\nlast year suddenly not wanting to go to\nsocial settings as much saying no to\ninvites all the time because i felt just\nexhausted being around people that's\nfair you know i was just like no\neveryone i go is going to be bugging me\nabout something and so i changed my\nmentality to be like and then so what go\nto these events ask other people about\ntheir lives and let them ask you for\nyour life it's okay it's only exhausting\nand so sucking because you're defining\nit to be that way yeah like this me\nbeing in the public eye is not changing\ni can't reverse it i can't stop it you\nknow i could start making videos today\nand still\nthere's going to be people coming up to\nme years from now being like hey i love\nyou you know what i mean i can't reverse\nit so i have to make an active choice to\ndefine it as something else yeah you\nknow absolutely yeah and i think\nprotecting your energy is important i do\nthink that too yeah what you're saying\nis spot on like no and i know you know\nthis i'm just throwing out if anyone is\nlistening it's just like that protecting\nyour energy is so important too right\nlike not going everywhere you think you\nhave to be etc which i know you already\nknow but that's that's an important part\nof it too because it can be exhausting\nto just turn up and have to be someone\nand the rest of it\nand then i've told myself if you do have\nto go somewhere or if you want to go\nsomewhere don't define it as being so\nsucking it's fine yes and so i found\nmyself when i go out to places now i\nactually like just find people and\nreally get into their stories yeah and i\nlike leave with many more friends mostly\nbecause i've like had like seven or 14\ndrinks but it's also because i like\npeople and i want to get to know them so\nyou know\ni love it this is this is uh you're\namazing i i love how\nwhen i'm listening to you all i can\nthink of is you're such an introspective\nsoul\nlike you're like you've like literally\nlike gone over things which i think are\nreally tough and when i'm hearing you\nthe only energy i'm sensing from it is\nthat it's real like it's it's like\nyou've just yeah it's it's\namazing it's definitely been a work in\nprogress i was not always like this i i\ndid not owe i was not always\nintrospective like that um\nand i think that's the biggest silver\nlining of any heartache i've had in my\nlife people always like what are you\nmost thankful for and i'm like uh being\ndepressed because literally it's given\nme so much silver lining of\njust how to\nhow to befriend my mind and how why i\nthink the way i think i had to be in a\nreally bad place to do those things and\nso yeah i wasn't always like this but i\ntried to make something out of bad times\ni guess\nit's amazing tell me tell me you said\n2019 was a year you wanted to take more\nrisks\ntell me about some of the risks yeah\nwhen i said 2019 was a year i want to\ntake more risks i was talking creatively\nfor sure i want to yeah not jumping off\na bill yeah not yet was it um but i\nwanted to\ncreate content that\nyou know i think when you're a youtube\ncreator you kind of get into this\nmentality of like i know it works on\nyoutube i know what kind of title i\ndon't kind of subject my mind would be\nlike okay let me do something with a boy\nlet me make it seem like a relationship\nlet me make the thumbnail list there's a\nformula that works to get people to\nclick a video\nfor me that feels very safe because it's\na tried true and tested formula i want\nto do things where the thumbnail might\nnot be enticing the title might not be\nindexed but it's a piece of content that\ni feel is really risky in terms of\nputting it on that platform because it\nmight not get any views and that's okay\nyeah the content i've been putting out\nthis year so far i'm super proud of yeah\ni'm probably the person that has watched\nthem the most\nmore than my fences i love them so much\nyeah and that's what i meant by taking\nmore risks i also might take more risks\nin terms of business\ni think business is art i am not trained\nformally in business i have a psychology\ndegree like i said so\ntake that for what you will but i own a\nbusiness and i\ni want to take more risks in terms of in\nterms of the production company i have\nyou know try to push stories that i know\ntraditional hollywood would be like no\nthat's like we're not putting that on a\nscreen that's the type of story i wanted\nto create i like you know i've gotten\nnotes like\na story about an immigrant girl from\nindia is not relatable i've gotten that\nnote i walk into rooms with\nold white men\nnot that there's anything wrong with old\nwomen but i've walked into many rooms\nwhere i'm trying to tell a story and\nthey're not understanding it and so i\nwant to take risks and still push those\nstories even though i know it's not\nthe safe\nway to get a deal or have someone buy\nsomething like i don't care i want to\npush those stories um and also in terms\nof like being edgy business in terms of\nlike requesting meetings with people\nthat are like completely absurd yeah you\nknow just a couple days ago i emailed my\nagency and i was like i want a meeting\nwith this person make it happen and then\ni just walked into this room with a gift\nfor the person i was like you know who i\nam you're going to know who i am now and\nyou know just kind of do those little\nrisky risky moves i love them make waves\nwow brilliant why not i always believe\nif you can't give up before you try and\neven once you try and there's a no like\nfigure it out everybody don't make it\nhappen absolutely and i love that you're\ntaking those risks because i think\ni think everyone who watches those\nthings eventually is going to benefit\nfrom them like anything that gets made\nwill benefit from them exactly and also\njust i mean i'm sure from your side like\nwhat you were saying about you earlier\nit's just more fun yeah right like to\ntake more risks to keep it exciting to\nbe nervous it also helps me hustle\nharder because\none of the biggest risks was my\nproduction company yeah i started it\nlast year it's only about nine months\nold but\na major financial investment like i'll\nbe super real with you as someone i'm\nsuper frugal i'm very cheap my last my\nsister-in-law she's like literally i'm\nso cheap but when i came to my company i\nwas like i'm going to put so much money\ni'm going to put so much resource into\nthis yeah and that's a huge risk\nbut because of that i'm like on my toes\nnow being like what are we gonna do to\nmake this work we need to work really\nhard and that's what makes it exciting\nright yeah absolutely i i wanna i don't\nknow if you've heard about this thing\ncalled flow state\nno no so when i when i'm hearing you it\nsounds like you enjoy flow state and i\nthink you've probably experienced it\nmultiple times so flow state is when\nyour challenge matches your skill so\nyour challenge level matches your skill\nso when your challenge is below your\nskill\nyou get bored because you're more\nskilled and your challenge is right and\nthen when your challenge is above your\nskill you get frustrated because your\nchallenge is so high and your skill\nlevel is low right and so if you're\nconstantly upping your skill and upping\nyour challenge you keep experiencing\nflow state which is like where you feel\nlike in the zone right moving like\nthings are happening like you have\nbreakthrough moments right and so when\ni'm hearing you speak so smart that's\nyeah yeah that's what i do yeah yeah\nthat's cool wow yeah where did you where\ndid you get where did the\nthe\nmindset of\nhustle harder come from into your life\nlike where did that even have come from\ni think innately it's because of my\nparents you know my parents are\nimmigrants from india my dad\nthe story my dad has told me many a time\nonce i\ncame to canada i had two jobs worked the\nnight shift you know my parents had to\nwork so hard to provide for me they did\na fabulous job for me my sister we have\nwe had a great upbringing because of\nthat so i think innately i have that\nimmigrant hustle in me but i think\notherwise um\nany job i've had growing up and i\nhonestly don't even know why my first\njob was fast food and i remember even at\nthat job someone came up to me and they\nwere like\nyou like work really hard i think i was\nlike refilling the forks like\nrelentlessly i was like just refill the\nforks and they were like i keep hitting\nthis like that's cool you're like you're\nfired um\nit's just something about not i feel\nlike if i'm not being productive\ni'm not taking advantage of everything\ni've been giving you know what i mean i\ndon't want to waste all the resources\nand opportunities i've been given i\nthink that's where it comes from wow\nyeah i love that yeah i can't be in my\nhouse in la\nin this wonderful life with these\nwonderful people around me and then be\nlike all right we'll just chill out like\nno like i need to do something with it\nor else\nwha\nwhat did i work hard for and also then\nwhat did my parents work hard for and\nthen\nwhy for what i need to no i need to give\nit this yeah purpose you know purpose\nand meaning and and and i want my dog to\nhave a better life\nyou know like honestly when i'm working\nreally hard i'm like\ni want to work hard so that you can have\nwhatever car you want and whatever else\nyou want and dog stuff is expensive\nexactly i've looked oh no 100 dog hotels\noh no anytime i go to the dog store\nthey're always trying to get me on that\norganic ramekin stop stop trying to make\nthe raw food a thing fetch is not going\nto be a thing stuff no it's just true no\nbut really it's just because i want my\ndog to have a better life yeah yeah it's\nthe most meaningful thing i think he can\nbe whatever he wants when he grows up\nand i want him to know that so do i\nmm-hmm am i going to get to see\nscarborough today\noh no he's not the office i didn't think\nhe should be there for the meditations\noh yeah i'd love to see him again yeah\nhe's super cute\nyeah that that story you put up recently\nof\nof uh him taking all your pictures\ninstead of you yeah\nyes yes this is about my dog you should\nfollow\ni love it i want to ask you about this\nbecause i think you've just been even in\nthis whole conversation you've been\nsuper honest super reflective\nwhat's been your biggest failure like\nwhat's been the thing that\nwent wrong for you or or at least felt\nlike it was going wrong for you\num if there has been maybe there hasn't\ni have two i have a professional one and\na personal one i think my biggest\nfailure professionally has been\nsubscribing to a system\nand putting that above making art that i\nbelieve i can honestly say that when i\nfirst started making youtube videos i\nwas very proud of everything and i\nenjoyed it and then i got a lot of\nsuccess and a lot of views and youtube\nbecame even bigger when i first started\nyoutube i could name every creator and i\nwas fr i could say like i know you you\nnow there's so many creators there's so\nmuch content so\ni told myself that no you need to just\ndo whatever it takes to make sure that\nthe algorithm likes you and people watch\nyour videos so i was very much so\nwriting a script very quickly and\nshooting a video\nand i think professionally that was a\nfailure because i think\nthat\nmy audience could probably see that um\nand i put quality above quantity i'm\nsorry i put quantity above quality and i\nthink that was a professional fail for\nsure um personally\nfor sure without a doubt my biggest\npersonal feel is\nthat\nduring this journey of superwoman and\nthis career i have placed very\nlittle importance on my self-care for\nsure and people would be shocked to know\nthat because in my vlogs i'm like very\nhappy and very energetic and that's not\na front no i i am that way\nbut you know some days when i am down or\ntired would i then feel obligated to\nlike be that person yes would i place\nwork over priorities with like\nrelationships with friends for sure\num i've been single for\nmy whole life so\ni mean you know so i think there was\ndefinitely moments where i convinced\nmyself that\nthe only success that matters is\nprofessional success\nwhereas no doing things that mean a lot\nto you personally that is also success\nand i had to redefine what success means\nto me because it did truly only mean\nprofessionalism yeah until recently well\nthe best thing is that both of those\nthings you're talking about you're\nworking on both i am i'm just deeply\nworking on them yes and i had to really\ncall them out to everyone like you've\nactually yeah you know every year what i\ndo at the end of every year\nnot only for myself but also i have a\nyear-end review video so i'm forced to\ngo through all of my achievements and i\nnoticed at the end of 2018\ni had\nso many personal achievements i had made\nbut professionally it was like a little\nbit less than previous years\ni remember looking at the list and being\nlike what a bad year like i felt like i\ndidn't have a successful year then i had\nto check myself and be like um actually\npersonally you had the most successful\nyear you're just not defining success\nthat way you know which is a huge issue\nyeah amazing yeah anyone listening make\nsure you define your own version of\nsuccess you're 100 it's so easy to get\ncarried away when things are working\nmm-hmm and things are happening and then\njust forget what's important exactly\nbeautiful to see you do it thanks it's\namazing i'll keep you posted yeah yeah\nexactly where you're better\nyou're better i want weekly updates i\nwill don't worry anytime i'm you know\nwhat honestly now that we're like good\ngood friends i'm gonna text you all the\ntime like jay i have this problem can\nyou help me\ni'm always yeah like but i have to say\njay is so sweet when i went on my break\nhe sent me the most lovely text and it\nwasn't even like\nproud of you fluffy fluffy it was like\nsubstance and like a text from someone\nthat genuinely thought about the text\nand cared about what they were saying\nand i really felt that i was like this\nperson is not just texting me for a\nconnection or for a network or like\nbecause they think they have to they\nactually care about what they're saying\nand they care about the outcome of this\nand that's what jay was and truly that\nwas like blown away by that so thank you\ni i thought a lot about that text i know\nit was like so well formatted it was\nspelled well it was it was great\nmaybe not that stuff at all i know i\nknow i just know because i just i really\nrespected you for it and on a genuine\nlevel like i was just like wow i\ngenuinely respected your friends i was\njust like i never wanted i just i didn't\nwant to belittle what you had done and\nat the same time i just yeah i just it\nwas from the heart it was from the heart\nyeah i appreciate it i'm glad it felt\nthat way that's always like my worst\nand that's one of the things i worry\nabout i don't know how much you have but\ni definitely worry about in this space\ni'm like when i reach out to someone i\nonly reach out to people i really want\nto connect with\nand so\nthe last thing i want them to do is get\na wrong impression for me that i'm\nreaching out to them from the wrong\nthing and i genuinely have that as an\ninsecurity as a questioning of like\ni don't want them to feel that way right\nand but i also want them to know me for\nwho i am i don't want them to like me\nbecause of the way i portrayed it right\ni\nhear that loud and clear and i think\nnothing but genuine i see nothing but\ngenuineness from me feelings mutual\nthanks when we collaborate together over\nchristmas it's so much fun\nand i was just like this that was that\nwas i was like it was so nice because so\nmany of people that i know back in\nlondon and i went back for christmas\nand they were just like oh we saw the\nvideo we did lily and like obviously\nthey're huge fans of yours\nand and they're just like what's she\nlike and i was like she's amazing it was\njust so nice to be able to say that\nafter having spent time with someone i\nlove that i feel like the number one\nquestion people ask everyone else yeah\nit was like what is she like in real\nlife and i kind of want people to like\ntell weird lies about me\ni kind of want someone to be like she\nhas a tail\nyeah like i really am into that yeah\nokay so next time i should do that she's\njust a little weird say something weird\nyeah she isn't weird about me\nlike she's she's not really punjabi yeah\nyeah yeah or like her hair is fake face\nyeah that'd be a good one yeah what else\ntell me something um\nabducted abducted\nyeah yeah yeah um you could say\nshe's actually married to scarborough\nshe's actually married to scarborough\nthat's a good one i like that one we can\nget pictures made too oh we have them\ni'm kidding\ni love that i love that awesome we uh i\nwant to ask you i always ask this to my\nguest because i think it's important i\nwant to actually you know before we do i\nwant to talk about your production\ncompany do you want to talk about some\nof the ideas that you've been coming\nwith it was polly who also was part of\nintroducing us and head of development\nof course but polly's wonderful by the\nway she's she's so so lovely like yeah\ni've enjoyed all the time i've spent\nwith her briefly too but\nshe's the head of development she's\ntalking about some of the cool ideas\nwhatever you can share yeah i'd love to\nknow like i don't want to you know no\nfor sure for sure um we\ni'll give you like the top line of a few\nthings yeah um we are working on a\narranged marriage thriller i love you\nwhen she told me that i was like which\ni'm very excited about because\nan arranged marriage it's the perfect\nenvironment for just a lot of cool\nfreaky stuff to happen and i feel like\nso often we see movies that are only one\ntype of relationship but\nhonestly the percentage of arranged\nmarriages in the world is very high it's\nnot only indian people it's many\ncultures across the world so that's an\nexample of like making stories that\npeople can relate to and be like oh this\nis like another perspective we haven't\nseen so i'm really excited about that\none yeah um we also are working on a few\nanimated projects\nso we're working on a kids animation\nbased off unicorn island which is this\nfantastical world in my mind and again i\nwant to be very like female voices\ndiverse cast it's going to be animated\nso i might voice one of the characters\nwe'll see amazing excited about that and\ni'll tell you about one more we are\nworking on um\na it's another animation adult animation\nand it is about a\nfeminist woman who\nagrees to get her parents to introduce\nher to a guy getting married so she goes\nvery traditional route and she's in this\nenvironment where she's super feminist\nbut has to like address all these like\ncultural things that are coming her way\nand so she's kind of\non on the edge of like what she should\ndo so it's super cool that's me trying\nto tell you without\nlike when i first heard the idea of the\narranged marriage i was just like that\nis so cool yeah like it's such a great\nidea and i loved it i also\nsomething i'm really passionate about\nwhich i don't know what we want to do\nwith this yet but there's this really\ncool book called once upon a time once\nupon a story that never happened uh\ndon't quote me on the title but\nessentially it's about it's a it's a\nkids book it's a kids animated book and\nit's about a princess trapped in a tower\nbut she doesn't want a prince to save\nher she wants a princess to save her and\nso i posted about this of course tons of\nbacklash about this but it's essentially\na story that's not so and i think it's\nbeautiful it's not so about like let's\ndiscuss sexuality and all it's just a\nprincess trapped in a tower and she just\ndescribes the princess she wants to save\nher yeah you know it's really fun\nbecause the dwarf at the end is like\nyeah i get it well i live with like 12\nguys so like i get it so it's like a\nreally fun story but i think those are\nthe types of like risk-taking boundary\npushing stories i want to tell because i\nthink it's so important for people to\ngrow up seeing people like them yeah you\nknow i didn't grow up seeing things like\nthat the only reference i have\nof people that looked like me was\nbollywood movies yes absolutely yes you\nknow what i mean so i think it's\nimportant for people to there's\nsomething really nice and that's the one\nthing i like about not the one thing one\nof the main things i like about the\nentertainment industry is that they tell\nstories that make people feel like\nthey're not alone that's the best way\nwhen you're watching a movie or reading\na book and you're like whoa like there's\nthis person that is like i suddenly feel\n100 times better about my life i think\nthat's the magic of story yeah and so it\njust makes no sense and it's\ncounterintuitive to me that so many\npeople in power\nthink they can decide which story should\nbe told and not told it just makes no\nsense to me because our job is to tell\nstories that relate to people yeah you\nknow absolutely and then it's not always\nit's not just diversity but it's\nrepresentation it's like that feeling of\nrepresenting representing the reality of\nthe world\nthat's what it is right it's like any\ntime i get a note about something i'm\nlike\nthis is what the world looks like yeah\nlike we're no longer living the\nsheltered like what you think no this is\nliterally what the world looks like and\nthat's what should be represented on tv\n100\n100\nyeah absolutely how much do you miss\ntoronto\ni don't miss the weather at all uh my\nmom i facetimed yesterday she said it's\nminus 30 degrees celsius\ncelsius mm-hmm\nso yeah you do celsius i do celsius yeah\nyeah it's really really cold um\nobviously you know my friends and family\nare there so i miss it a lot in terms of\nsome of the stronger relationships i\nhave but\nif i'm really honest i\nwas too in my comfort zone in toronto\nmoving to la was me stepping out of my\ncomfort zone and really challenged me to\nget to the places i am at now\ni could have stayed in toronto and i\nwould have been\na big fish in a small pond probably and\ni hope i i hope that doesn't come off\nthe wrong way but i really had to like\nthrust myself in a scenario where i was\nlike ugh\ntoday i moved to la i was\nfreaking out yeah i had like literally\nan anxiety attack not to pull over on\nthe side of the road truly because i\nmoved here i didn't really know anyone i\nremember i went to ralph's to buy\nlike a bottle of wine or something and\nthen they didn't accept my canadian id\nand i was like what have i done\nliterally so like there was just so many\nthings that i didn't know\num it was really really scary and so now\ni always think about that like that's\nfrom toronto to la imagine india to\ntoronto my parents you know i know it\nwas very scary and especially because\nlike as soon as i landed here i was like\nauditions meetings all this and i'm not\nfrom this world like i had to learn it\nall i had to sit in meetings and nod and\nlike kind of like fake it till you make\nit mentality and so it was a lot of that\nyou know yeah you've been on such a\nsteep learning curve truly yeah i've\nbeen in some situations where i'm like\ni'm gonna learn a lot of things very bad\nvery very fast exactly but you have like\nthat's the incredible thing you're up\nthere yeah like no but you have like\nyou've you've learned how to set up a\nbusiness you've learned how to even not\neven just now like taking care of\nyourself\nmy company always asks about like my\nemployees joke around like do we have an\nhr department i'm like shut up\ndo we have anything no i'm just saying\nno i'm definitely learning and it's\nsuper stressful i don't know if you can\nrelate but i can when you're running a\nbusiness\nit's like a whole thing\nit's the whole thing\nand there's so many times where i'm like\noh my god i'm not equipped to do any of\nthis stuff and i think one of the\nlessons i've learned is the smartest\nthing you can do is be the dumbest\nperson in the room yeah so i make sure\nthat when i hire people on my team i'm\nlike you are all better than me at the\nthing you do you know so that makes me\nreally smart because i chose you to be\nhere so like i make sure i have really\ngood lawyers because back in the day my\nmentality was like i will learn to edit\nvery well and i will learn how to do my\ntaxes lie i'll never learn yeah but i\nwill hire very smart people to do those\nthings so that i'm the dumbest person in\nthe room 100 yeah steve jobs used to say\nwe don't hire smart people to tell them\nwhat to do we hire smart people so they\ncan tell us yes exactly and it's like i\ni completely agree and i think everyone\nshould when they can and when you have\nthe ability as an entrepreneur to\noutsource the areas\nthat you don't have an expertise in\nwhich was in which was also a huge\nstruggle for me because as a creator\nonline\npeople kind of guilt you for doing that\ntotally a big hurdle for me was when i i\nhad to like\nhide the fact that an editor for so long\nand i can openly honestly say that that\ni was like no i have to make it seem\nlike i'm doing everything still because\nwhen i started yes i was doing\neverything of course i was editing i was\nshooting i was writing but then i got to\na point where i could and i was\ni could have more time to be more\ncreative and do other things\nbut i was made to feel so guilty about\nthat you know and i think a lot of\ncreators relate to this idea of you have\nto put off this assault like you do\neverything but you don't no wouldn't you\nwant what i want for everyone else is\nfor them to grow and i i genuinely\nbelieve people should want that for each\nother you should want that for each\nother i want you to go to a place where\nyou can have a team and and be mentally\nstable and good and so i was like it\ndoesn't matter if people are mad that i\nhave an editor i have an editor because\nhe's better than me\nexactly you know it used to take me 25\nhours to edit a five minute video oh no\n100\nsame with me no film background no media\nbackground i had to teach myself it was\njust so long and i did it for\na long long time and then when i could\nfinally have it i was so happy it was\nlike six years of me yeah shooting my\nall my videos myself editing all myself\nand they looked like trash so everyone\nshould be very happy that i don't do it\nanymore\nabsolutely yeah i love it is there\nanything we haven't talked about that\nyou're like jay i wish you asked me\nabout this i wish we talked about this\nbecause i'm happy to go there now\nyou were pretty thorough to be honest um\nno but i'm happy to as in if i miss\nstuff i want to know no i don't think so\nthis is me telling you you can tell me\nyeah no i definitely wouldn't but i\ndon't think so yeah yeah how fun was he\ndesigning your match\nwas very fun to design\num but i will say\nfor someone that's as big as a control\nfreak as me\num i have this bad habit of wanting very\nnice things but for very cheap i have\nthis thing in my heart and i swear to\ngod i'm not just saying this because it\nsounds good i'm genuinely meaning this\ni really don't want my merch to be\nexpensive because i know what it feels\nlike to be a young kid bugging your\nparents to buy you something and it\nbeing and then being like shut up you're\nnot getting this sweater for 80 dollars\nf out of here so that's something i'm\nstruggling with i'm struggling with i\nwant myself to look really cool yeah but\ni don't want it to be expensive\nthat doesn't exist right now i don't\nthink that exists anyway so\nit's a lot of fun but there's still a\nlot of work to be done\nbecause that's the hardest bit right\nwhen you buy something and it was cheap\nbut then in the first wash it goes bad\nor it bubbles up and then it's like then\nyou have a bad taste because of that\nbecause\nsome things i do some things i do\nbecause i like it and also because it's\nlike this is a smart business\nopportunity that's not how i view merch\ni'm fortunate enough to have a lot of\nother revenue streams where merch is\njust like a fun thing for me to do\nthat's exciting and i know for my fans\nit's exciting as well so it's not it's\ntruly not my\npriority to like make a lot of money off\nmerch yeah you know if i'm really honest\ni'd rather make money off a tour where i\ncould actually meet my family that makes\nmore sense to me sure it's not about\nit's not like a very big\nbusiness financial endeavor that i'm\ntrying to go on and i know i'm going to\nsay this people can look shut the f up\ntake it for what you will but i'm being\nsuper honest that the most frequent\nemail i get is like you're going to make\nzero dollars on your merch just want to\nknow that you're a horrible business\nperson never plugged it but it's so cute\nand i'm laughing at my poor fans huh\nyeah and i also like send a lot of the\nstuff to like india and that's like\nliterally send something to indian it\nwas like uh 900 to send there and i was\nlike\nthis is fine\nso you know i love it and lily did not\npay me to ask for merch just putting it\nno they paid me to talk about that sorry\ni did not i i'll give you somewhere\ntoday yeah i asked because i i missed\nyour pop-up when you had it here i was\ntraveling so that's why i asked because\ni knew it looked fun thank you and and i\nwas sad that i didn't know but that's\nthe thing like i had to pop up another\nit was fun but yeah what i really want\nto do is like a pop-up\nin like india you know but then again my\nmerge companies can be like oh so are\nyou gonna pay for these nine million\nboxes to go to india because we ain't\ngonna pay for it so then i run into\nissues like that see this is this is why\ni need someone telling me what to do i\nlove it no but i i think that's part of\nit i genuinely think that part of it is\ngoing with your intuition doing what\nmakes you happy doing what's like\nmeaningful to you and like you said like\nyou're smart enough to know where\nyou can take risks and make mistakes and\ngive sometimes we'll see yeah we'll see\ni love it all right so we end we end\nevery interview with my final five which\nare like my final fast five questions\nokay\nyeah speed right cool so one two three\nwords maximum one to three okay cool\nright okay so\nwhat's the hardest thing about being\nlily sing\nbalance nice second question the
