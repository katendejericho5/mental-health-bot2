Sardinia\nwhether we were in La where we did so\nmany events together I mean I think the\ncommunity that you've cultivated in mind\nValley is so special yeah and the people\nthat are so special and whenever I'm\nthere I feel so much love I feel so much\ngenuine sincerity to grow and and my\ncommunity here loves you too and can I\ncan I appreciate you for one thing and\nmany people don't know this about you\nand maybe you don't know this about you\nas well but when I first met you in 2018\nin Sardinia you were speaking at one of\nmy events I was not on Instagram I was\nnot on social media at all I felt I was\ntoo old\nI didn't know I felt imposter syndrome I\nfelt I don't know anything I felt I'm\ntoo old and you were the person who\nconvinced me to get on Instagram I\ndidn't know that you didn't know that\nbut before then I used Instagram just to\nshare I use Instagram as a gratitude\nwall I would share pictures of things I\nwas grateful for never for an audience\nand you showed me that it was possible\nmy Instagram blew up it's now like 800\n000 people at vision and now I use it to\nto curate this this this community and\nto talk about my discoveries and\npersonal growth but you were the person\nwho inspired me to get on well thank you\nman I had no idea that's that's\nbeautiful I'm I'm happier for the world\nthat you did get on so my first\ninspirational Instagram post happened\none week after we spoke and you don't\neven remember this but we spoke over\ndinner yeah I remember I've remembered\nall our meetings but I think what you've\ndone with mind value what you've done\nwith your work has been incredible today\nI want to dive into parts of this book\nbut I want to dive into it with your\nexperience because\nI think everyone can remember or has a\ndistinct memory of their first\nmeditation experience what was your\nfirst meditation experience ever do you\nremember it like the first time you were\never introduced to any form of\nmeditation so the first time it happened\nto me I was 14 years old I was a young\nkid in Malaysia and I decided to try a\nform of meditation that I learned from a\nbook called The Silva method a really\nold 1960s 1970s book back then I was 14\nso must have been like 1990 there was no\ninternet in Malaysia we had four\ntelevision channels so really to pass\nthe time by all I did was I would browse\nall of the books in my father's\nbookshelf and I discovered this book\ncalled The Silver method now the book\ncaptivated me because it spoke about how\nthe mind can heal the body what was\nhappening with me back then is I was\nhaving a really horrible skin problem my\nface was covered in acne I had very\nlittle confidence I considered myself\nugly I had difficulty making friends at\nschool you know even if I liked a girl I\nhad no confidence to even talk to her\nand so when I read in this book that the\nmind can heal the skin I was game on I\nwant to figure this out so I tried\npracticing nothing happened I continued\npracticing nothing happened and there\nwas very little results but I read and\nre-read and reread that book over and\nover and over and over again then I\nstarted picking other books from Bob\nProctor from a Wayne Dyer I started\nreading this books it became a passion\nand slowly things began to click and one\nday a applying the silver method at this\npoint I was 17 years old things had\nfinally started clicking I began to\nunderstand it's not just about hoping\nand wanting your skin to heal there was\na process there was a method there was a\npsychology when it clicked in five weeks\nI completely healed my skin five years\nof skin disease healed in five weeks\ntoday science talk about this as a thing\nit's called psychodymatology how your\nmind influences your skin but that was\nmy first evidence that we can use our\nminds to influence our bodies now the\nnext thing I did was I decided to see\ncan I use my mind to accomplish a really\nbig goal for me that was qualifying for\nthe US Open Taekwondo championships\nTaekwondo is Korean karate I was really\ninto it and I managed to qualify my\nfirst ever trip to the United States\nwhich was my Dreamland since I was like\na kid I wanted to go to America my first\never trip was to the US Open to\nrepresent my country it was in Colorado\nSprings in 1993 my first time I fell in\nlove with America but it became because\nI visualized that in my mind and that\nwas my beginning the beginning of my\nfascination with the human mind that\nwould later lead to me starting\nMindvalley and writing this book that's\namazing I I love that story for so many\nreasons a because\nwell let me just break this down for\neveryone you had an intention that was\nvery clear even if it was to save your\nskin or to impress a girl or whatever it\nwas you were clear of why you wanted to\nmeditate the second thing was you were\nhappy to read the book again and again\nand again and again and again and I\nthink that takes a lot of resilience\nbecause most of us when we try something\nonce and it doesn't work we give up and\nthe third thing is you didn't just test\non something small once you saw a small\nresult you're like well does this apply\nto something bigger and I think those\nthree lessons in and of themselves are\nso powerful what has changed in the\nbenefits to you of meditation today at\nthat time it was solving your skin it\nwas getting focused around the Taekwondo\nchampionships how do you view meditation\nlike what is its use in your life today\nbecause I feel like so many people keep\ntelling us to meditate and there's so\nmany benefits but for you personally\nwhat what's the reason so I grew up in a\nHindu family Malaysia meditation was\nnever what I was thought the style of\nHinduism I was thought was very dogmatic\nyou had prayers you had chance you had\nmantras and I found it oh God so boring\nand irritating I hated being dragged to\nTemple to listen to a pre-speak in\nSanskrit a language I didn't even\nunderstand so when I was 19 I gave up\nHinduism I decided the religion was not\nfor me I read a quote by Gandhi that\nsaid I'm a Hindu and I'm a Muslim and\nI'm a Christian and I'm a Jew and I'm a\nBuddhist and I thought that's it I want\nto study and unite ideas from all of\nthese different spiritual practices and\nso that was my beginning I got obsessed\nwith spirituality I started reading\nbooks by Esther Hicks by Neil Donald\nWalsh and I became particularly\ncaptivated by the spirituality that was\nemerging from the United States from\neveryone from paramahansa Yogananda who\nwas an Indian who crossed over here to\nNeil Donald walls to especially Jose\nSilva now a lot of them spoke about\nspirituality what made Jose Silva's work\ndifferent was that he broke it down into\nactionable steps and that's what\nfascinated me most so a lot of people\nspoke about meditation about sitting\nstill about going within Jose Silva\nwould teach the method you're going to\ndo this method to reduce your brainwave\nfrequency to the alpha level this method\nto gathered down to the Theta level this\nmethod of positioning your eyes to\nactivate Alpha frequency in your brain\nthis method to reprogram your\nsubconscious this method to manifest a\ngoal this method to do healing and that\nstructured approach captivated me now we\ncall that active meditation that's the\nword Jose Silva use also use the same\nword active meditation this means it's\ndifferent from passive meditation which\nwas more than meditation from Hinduism\nfrom Eastern cultures where you focus on\nyour breath or you go within and there's\na usefulness in that but what I loved\nabout active meditation is in the words\nof Jose Silva you use it to solve\nproblems you do not push your problems\naway you turn your problems into a\nproject you have skin disease you're\ngoing to heal it you need to achieve a\nbusiness goal you're going to make it\nhappen and you would apply different\ntools to solve these problems now when I\nwas in Silicon Valley I applied the\nSilva method and it completely\ntransformed my career I was able to hold\ndown two jobs I got promotion after\npromotion after promotion at the age of\n26 I was vice president of the\nbooming.com and I was meditating using\nthe silver method and other practices I\nwould combine with it and one day I\ncertainly had a calling I realized that\nmeditation was the most powerful thing\nI'd learned in life it was the reason\nwhy I was successful at my career yet my\nUniversity degree for which I paid\nalmost a quarter million dollars for\ntaught me Jack it wasn't really helping\nme so I decided I wanted to do something\nthat could help the world I decided to\nquit and become a meditation teacher now\nas I started becoming a meditation\nteacher as I started compiling all of\nthese methods I needed something for\nmyself and I look at meditation from as\na tool okay so a lot of people say all\nright meditation is a form of\nself-awareness of prayer yes yes yes but\nmeditation is also a tool the point of\nmeditation in the words of the great\nteacher Emily Fletcher is not to get\ngood at meditation it is to get good at\nlife and so I use two different types of\ntools now let's think about our home we\nhave coffee makers and we have electric\ndrills we use a coffee maker every\nsingle day or a tea kettle every single\nday to put ourselves in a good state to\nstart our morning an electric drill is a\npower tool you don't use it every day\nyou use it when you have a problem when\nyou have to drill a hole in a wall or\nthreaten someone I guess so in\nmeditation the style that I teach there\nare two types you would use a power tool\nlike the silver method which now sits on\nmind Valley for a really tactical\nproblem for example healing right the\nsilver method has been proven by Dr okal\nSimonton as a very effective form of\nimagery therapy for accelerating healing\nyou're sick you want to do it if you are\nsuddenly feeling like you have a\nmigraine you want to use it to help\nreduce your migraine the sixth phase is\nwhat I developed as not the electric\ndrill but the coffee maker something you\nuse every single day even if your life\nis amazing you use it every single day\nbecause it helps put you in a peak state\nfor work for happiness for human\nconnection and it puts you in this\nbeautiful state where it almost feels as\nif the universe has your back like you\nhave you know the Tinkerbell Fairy\nfollowing you around blessing everything\nyou do and making your life magical this\nis how I view meditation it's an active\napproach to tackle the most complex\nproblems in life but also as a daily\napproach to put you in Peak states of\nhumanness this is why I love talking to\nyou because I love that explanation and\nI think that that breakdown of how\nmeditation can be used differently for\ndifferent challenges is fantastic and I\nlove the analogy with the with the tea\nkettle will go with and and and the\ndrill because I I do think you're right\nthat we've made meditation what you just\nsaid is about becoming good at\nmeditation which is absolutely\nirrelevant to life and with the six\nphase method what I love about it is\nthat you have the same thing that you\nloved about how the silver mother taught\nit you've figured out your own method\nthat people can take now in this book\nwhen you talk about this is where I want\nto get into some of this and everyone\nwho's watching and listening back at\nhome or wherever you are I'm only going\nto be giving you a tip of the iceberg\nbut I want to give you this Insight\nbecause my hope and goal and intention\nis that you will go and order the book\nright now while we're having this\nconversation to really dive deep into it\nbut I want to give you just enough to\nrecognize how practical it is so you\ntalk about how we need to start with the\ncircle of love and compassion\nwhen I hear the word compassion and I\nthink when a lot of people do compassion\nfeels like a tall order because I feel\nlike it's been removed I think before\ncompassion we think of criticism we\nthink of complaining we think of\ncomparing like those are more natural\nthoughts can you talk to me about how\nyou had this Epiphany that compassion\nwas a beginning when often our beginning\nplaces criticism complaining or\ncomparison so compassion is not\nsomething you do for other people\nthat's a great side effect compassion is\nsomething you do for yourself it changes\nthe way you function\nand show up in the world\nso there's a lot of science right now on\ncompassion practices that derive from\nZen roshi Buddhism or even from the hot\nmat Institute for example the hot mat\nInstitute found that if you just close\nyour eyes and you see the face of\nsomeone you love you see the eyes you\nsee the unknowns you feel that love for\nthem you feel it in your heart area it\nchanges your heart resonance\nand your heart resonance is a biomarker\nof Health in short giving love to\nsomeone else instantly physiologically\nchanges the heartbeat that you're having\nand puts it in a better state that shows\nthat your body is in a healthy mode\nheart resonance correlates with health\nand I found this fascinating that is how\nwe start the sixth phase then we move to\na more advanced compassion practice\nwhere we extend love across the world\nnot we start with our family our\nneighborhood our city our country and\nthen globally now why is this important\ncompassion is like a muscle you can\ntrain it and when you train it you\nbecome more loving if you think about\nall the great Saints and sages and\nMystic compassion and love was a key\npart of who they are whether it's\nYogananda or Jesus it was compassion and\nlove but this is how it shows up in your\nworld right so I remember after depend\nendemic I went for breakfast with a\nfriend all the restaurants had been\nclosed for three months and finally that\nweekend everything opens and so we are\nwaiting in line for around 20 40 minutes\nto get in finally we get in it's really\nbusy so they can only see this at the\nbar and all I'm craving is coffee eggs\nand some and a side of avocado so I\norder my coffee and 20 minutes later the\nwaitress hasn't brought the coffee the\nwaitress is carrying around there's a\nlot of people over there she's wearing a\nmask and she left the coffee on the bar\nand I can see it and it's 20 minutes I\ncan't get her attention finally she\nbrings me the coffee just puts it down\ndoesn't even say anything and it's gone\ncold so I have to order another copy\nthat other coffee comes ten minutes\nlater then my omelet comes 40 minutes\nlater they forgot the avocado and all of\nthis chaos now at the end of that as I\nwas tipping the waitress I still had a\nsmile on my face and I gave a tip worth\n50 of the entire bill so my friend\nlooked at me and goes what are you doing\nlike the service here was horrible she\ndoesn't deserve fifty percent and I said\nreally well I thought she did and I\nexplained it to my friend that's that I\nsaid look it's all how we see it to me\nI'm just happy to be here\nto be able to eat outdoors again it\ndoesn't matter we have to wait 20\nminutes in line it was just nice being\nable to step into a restaurant after\nthree months that waitress she's been\nrunning around with a mask on herself\nfor gosh maybe 12 hours look at the\nlight she's not even getting a break and\nprobably for the last three months she\ndidn't have a job she was probably\nworried about how to put food on the\ntable and that's why I gave her a 50 tip\nI don't care if my coffee was cold or my\navocado came late that didn't even\nregister for me rather I was in the\nstate of appreciation of Love of ore at\nthe humanity around me even if it was a\nlittle bit messy\ncompassion had put me in that zone when\nyou see someone else even if it seems\nlike what they did is wrong to you you\nlook at them with a sense of empathy\nwith a sense of understanding and it is\nthat understanding that changes and\nreframes your definition of the world\nso I'm not saying do compassion so you\nbecome a better Tipper I'm saying do\ncompassion because the world becomes a\nmore beautiful alive connected place and\nyour life becomes more peaceful now the\nside effect is everyone you come in\ncontact with you bring happiness into\ntheir lives and the world needs that\ntoday what I love about that example is\nthat it shows something in a personal\nway that we all experience\nand it's so fascinating because I've\nbeen experimenting with something\nsimilar in a professional setting so a\nlot of people would say oh yeah you can\ndo that with a you know with a waiter or\na waitress at a at a store but then what\nabout someone in your workplace and I\nrealized that if you go\nhard on people and people experience\nthis I think we've all had experience\nwith it we've all had bosses who are\nhard on us\nand I found that when my bosses were\nhard with me\nit closed me off it didn't open me up\nwhereas if someone checked in with me\nand said hey Jay you look like you're\nstruggling a bit is everything okay at\nhome like is your family okay like is\nhow are things going you don't have to\ntell me but if you feel like telling me\nlet me know\nthat allowed me to have a safe space and\nwant to deliver more for that person as\nopposed to if that person came up to me\nand goes I'm not really happy with your\nperformance right now like hearing that\nfrom someone didn't open someone up and\nso even your same approach in a\nprofessional setting still works and\napplies that when you approach someone\nor someone approaches you and just says\nhey I can tell that you're dealing with\na few issues or something must be going\non do you feel like telling me I think\nthat compassion is such a superpower and\nit's so underestimated where did we lose\nthat where did we go wrong I I think we\nunderestimate it because for the longest\ntime in society we thought kindness is\nassociated with weakness strength power\neven to put power over someone else was\na sign of strength with today we know\nthat's not true there was a Gallop study\ndone on two 10 million employees and\nthey found that the employees who loved\ntheir jobs more who were most engaged\nwho were most productive were one of the\nhighest correlations with Revenue growth\nanswered yes to the following question\nmy supervisor or someone at work cared\nabout me as a person well and that's\ncompassion now I remember a funny story\nabout DJ so I remember me yeah yeah that\nshows how compassionate you are so so I\nwant to share this with the audience we\nwere having dinner at mindvalley's\nFestival afest this was that Festival in\nibita and you disappeared to use the\nrestroom oh yeah and then we never saw\nyou for two hours so imagine you're\nhaving dinner with someone there about\nsix people in the dinner table and that\nperson goes I have to go use the\nrestroom two hours later he hasn't come\nback and so you're thinking gosh what a\njerk if he was bored by my company he\nshould have just said Vision I'm gonna\ngo to sleep he had to make that restroom\nexcuse so I was mildly annoyed by you\nand then I realized what happened Jay\nwent to use the restroom and as you were\ncoming out of the restroom one by one\npeople were coming out to take photos\nwith you or ask you for advice and you\nstood there for almost two hours talking\nto everyone taking photos giving them\nthe advice they needed and then you were\nso tired you went to sleep that's\ncompassion and and see you you may have\ndone that almost just organically but I\nnever forget that and that put you at\nhero status in my mind no well I I\nhonestly have to say it's it's because\nyou attract the best people like that\nthe culture and community of the quality\nof individual that comes to mind valet\nevents is really special and you know I\nI know that I know so many a festers in\nmy personal life as well like Irvin\nwho's one of my closest friends over in\nValencia e and it's like he's been an a\nI think he's like I don't know how many\natheists he's been to maybe like nine or\nsomething I don't know he's been to a\nlot I think he's the health director for\nthe New York Knicks yeah absolutely\nabsolutely he's the director of training\nand conditioning at the Knicks and it's\njust like he's the embodiment of\neverything we're talking about in a\nbeautiful way and I think I did that\nbecause of the quality of the people you\nattract but I appreciate you remembering\nthese things obviously meditation gives\nyou a good memory so so I I say that\nbecause compassion today kindness is the\nultimate Flex yeah I remember years ago\nwhen people wanted to sell you stuff on\nthe internet do this to make money do\nthis to build a business they would post\nwith their Lamborghini or their car\ntoday nobody gives a damn today the\nstuff that we share on Instagram are\nvery often inspirational stories people\ndoing kind acts people saving animals\npeople doing great things for kids\ncompassion is the flex in today's\nsociety what is the difference between a\ntechnique\nand a pure intention in the sense of\nI I we know each other well and I know\nthat you've meditated for God knows how\nmany years now and I know how much study\nyou've done and how many incredible\npeople use this method like so many\ncelebrities and athletes use this method\nwhat have you found to be the difference\nbetween someone who uses compassion as a\ntechnique to get what they want or to\npresent themselves a certain way versus\nwhat is the difference in result and\npractice in someone who's doing it from\na pure place I'm just fascinated\nabsolutely okay so the technique is not\ncompassion the technique is the circle\nof compassion which is the specific\nexercise we do inspired by Zen roshi\nBuddhism and the hot mat Institute to\nexpand and open your heart right so that\nis the technique\nThe Compassion itself is a quality of\nbeing so the sixth base is six specific\ntechniques that layer on top of each\nother that open up six different aspects\nof your being which I believe are really\nimportant for you to show up in the\nworld not just as a good human being but\nto crush it at work to hit your goals to\nget things done and to do it from this\nstate of just absolute Bliss and\nEquanimity the point is you're making is\nthat you can't even use compassion for\nlower means or lower requirements\nbecause well that's very compassions\nfake kindness right you're doing\nsomething to get something yeah but the\ntechnique that we are doing actually\ntrains your brain to understand how\ndeeply connected you are if you do this\nyou automatically become nicer so yeah\nyou're talking about the actual change\nin your Consciousness and like exactly\ntransforming your character as opposed\nto like what we're saying like\nI'm talking about marketing versus\nmeaning yeah like the idea of like oh I\ncan Market this stuff versus this\nactually makes sense there was one thing\nspecific I wanted to ask you you talk\nabout happiness and gratitude\nI wanted to ask you your take on after\nall these years you've helped so many\nteachers share their work you've helped\nso many like that's one of the most\nspecial things about you that I\nappreciate about you is that you're not\njust presenting what you know you're\nsupporting the work of so many other\nincredible people and you've supported\nmine too you know you've supported me\ntoo in in such a deep and beautiful way\nand what I'm intrigued by though is out\nof all the reading you've done all the\nstudying you've done what is happiness\nis happiness in your eyes still a goal\nis it a Pursuit is it a byproduct what\nis happiness because I feel like we\nstill don't know we still hear people\ntalking about I just want to be happy\nwell my goal is to be happy\nwhat's Visions take on that so happiness\nis not the goal at all in fact happiness\nis not even what we care about what\nwe're looking at is\na concept called bliscipline\ndiscipline is not being happy it's not\nforcing yourself to be happy look I am a\nperson who can be prone to depression\nit's actually in My DNA wow right you\ncan measure these things now with DNA\nand I've been in depression in my life\nI'm also a person who is prone to\nMelancholy Melancholy is when I wanna\nwhen it typically it happens when it's\nraining I want to sit by the fire listen\nto\nsad music\nand just be by myself and I like that\nI'm not happy I'm neither am I sad or\ndepressed I'm just Melancholy and it's a\nbeautiful feeling and we all feel that\nsometimes if you've ever seen the Pixar\nmovie Inside Out it shows that sadness\ncan be a superpower you can be sad when\nyou miss someone you can be sad when\nyou're grieving there's a beautiful\nquote from the the Disney show Wanda\nvision\nwhat is grief that love persisting the\ngoal isn't to push away sadness rather\nthe goal is this is to remember this\nwhen we are showing up\nwith people when we are showing up at\nwork the thing that matters is the\nconcept of discipline and that is having\nthe discipline to ensure that you are\nyou are nurturing your positive emotions\nnow positive emotions doesn't mean\nyou're fake happy positive emotions mean\nthat even if you're sad you you can\nobserve it like I love that quote what\nis grief but love persisting because if\nyou're grieving someone that's a\nbeautiful emotion you can grieve someone\nwho has left your life but you're not\nbeating yourself out of it so you're\nstill in a way Blissful now why is this\nimportant there's a study called PQ and\nthere's a book about it by shamin and PQ\nmeans positivity quotient it's your\nratio of good thoughts versus overall\nthoughts now what they find is that the\nhigher your PQ the better you function\nat your job the better you function at\nyour work we spend 70 of our work on our\nwaking hours on our work and so if we\ncan practice discipline and Elevate our\nPQ we get more done we are happier as we\nwork the quality of our work is better\nbut you know the studies on PQ fascinate\nme they found that the number one thing\nthat determines how well a team\nfunctions is their PQ is what is the\nratio of positive emotions within the\nteam and between the members of this\nteam and so if we can train for\nbliscipline if we can put ourselves in\nthese Blissful States we simply do\nbetter now one of the most beautiful\nthings I read was in the book Titan it's\nthe biography of John D Rockefeller he\nwas the richest man who ever lived and\nat the age of 83 John D Rockefeller\nwrote a beautiful poem that illustrates\nthis idea of discipline he said I was\nonly taught to work as well as play my\nlife has been one long happy holiday\nfull of work full of play and I left the\nworry along the way and God was good to\nme every day\nand that's really what we're talking\nabout now the richest man in the world\ncould pen that imagine what this quality\nwhat this Essence can do for you it's\namazing isn't it how what we read or\nwhat we think about become the scripts\nof our life and and I feel just as you\naccording people that have inspired you\nI feel like for me half the thoughts in\nmy head I think of things I've absorbed\nright I'm like held on to that then\ncreate my story in my script\nI didn't know what you just said about\nyou that's actually such interesting\nnews to me I don't think we've ever\nspoken about that I loved how you talked\nabout how Melancholy isn't happiness or\nisn't sadness but you enjoy that feeling\nI feel the same way about Solitude of\nspending time alone like I often look\nforward to spending time alone I try and\nmake time to spend alone I'll often\nchoose being alone as opposed to doing\nsomething else and that's not because\nI'm happy or ecstatic about it or I'm\nnot sad about it it just brings me joy\nbut what I didn't know about you was\nthis Bend you said towards depression or\ndepressive thoughts and I want to go\nthere what has been\nthe most depressing state that you've\nbeen in that the six phase meditation\nmethod and other methods that you\npractice and even teach today have\nhelped you out of what has been that\npoint so so first you've got to\nunderstand phase one compassion phase\ntwo gratitude phase three forgiveness\nall of these qualities have been\nscientifically proven to lower risk of\ndepression and lower situations where\nyou're feeling anxious or panic but I\nhave gone through depression in my life\nI have gone moments where I was\nprofoundly sad that hasn't happened much\nin the past decade or so wow and part of\nthe reason is because of the six phase\nbut it doesn't mean that I don't get sad\nall of us are going to go through\ntroubles in life I miss people yesterday\nI was sad because it was my son's\nbirthday he turned 15 and I couldn't be\nwith him because I was doing a big event\nin LA and my son lives in Estonia in\nEurope\nand there's nothing wrong with being sad\nabout that right but through that\nsadness I left them I think one of the\nmost beautiful voicemails I've ever left\nmy son about how much I love him so you\ncan Channel sadness into love into\ncompassion into into vulnerability and\nhelp you connect with yourself and other\npeople yeah how do you stop sadness\nfrom developing into guilt because I\nfind that you could have easily gone the\nother way you could have been like all\nright I'm sad that I'm not with my son\non my birthday I'm a terrible dad which\nI know you're not but I mean you could\nsay I'm a terrible dad and people do\nfeel this way I'm a terrible dad I care\nmore about my work by my actions than I\ndo about my son someone could I'm saying\ncould think of this story they could\nthink I should have flown back I should\nhave been there so these are these are\nthe things that I hear from parents all\nthe time exactly right so this Mass this\npast four weeks I'm gonna I'm gonna four\nweek book tour right now this is the\nlongest I've been away from my kids but\nthe reason so I get that and I've never\nbeen traveled this much away from them\nbecause of that guilt but I realized\nthat was silly I know that I'm deeply\nconnected to my children I've learned\nsince then that it's not about being\nwith them all the time it's about when\nyou're with them how do you feel with\nthem and how do you make them feel but\nhow do I overcome that guilt well that's\nwhere phase three comes in guilt is one\nof the lowest human emotions guilt shame\nfrom a Consciousness vibration point of\nview if you look at the Hawking scale\nright at the bottom guilt and shame you\ndon't want to get there phase three is\nabout healing from guilt and shame so\nwhen you practice forgiveness and in the\nsixth phase we teach you a eight-step\nforgiveness protocol that you stick\nright in you forgive yourself for\nmistakes you've made in the past you\nforgive yourself for things that you may\nfeel shameful for or guilty for but you\nalso learn to heal and forgive the acts\nof others it turns out if you want to\ndevelop the brainwave of a monk so\nthey've actually measured the brainwave\nstates of monks and you're amongst so I\nbet you've Fallen there as well so monks\nhave high left right brain coherence\nthat means your left and right brain are\nkind of vibing at the same level and\nhigh alpha amplitude so they found this\nin Zen roshimongs who have spent 20 to\n40 years in meditation so at the\nbiocybernard institute in Vancouver\nwhere they map the brain wave states of\nmonks they found that these were the two\nqualities that you want to create but\nhow do you get that well for forgiveness\nforgiveness and forgiving people who\nhurt you as well as forgiving mistakes\nthat you made in the past is the number\none hack to get you in that level this\nis why forgiveness is phase three\nbecause I've seen miracles happen\nthrough the practice of forgiveness\nforgiveness has been proven to not just\nimprove back pain increase your heart\nhealth improve the quality of your sleep\nreduce depression and anxiousness a\nstudy showed that it improves your\nvertical jump another study in Israel\nshowed that it improves your endurance\nand for people who believe in\nmanifesting it's quite possible because\nI've heard this from many spiritual\nteachers it increases your rate of\nmanifesting that's why forgiveness is\nspace three because I practice\nforgiveness in a very rapid way every\nday\num so each phase takes about two minutes\nof practice I don't experience guilt I\ndon't experience shame it doesn't mean\nI've never made mistakes I just don't\nbeat myself up over it because you\nunderstand that we're all human I love\nthat principle and I'd say that that\napplies to marriage that applies to work\nit replies to ourselves like that idea I\nalways talk about how\none of the things that's helped me and\nmy wife massively in our marriage is\nthat we're both wired to forgive\novernight yes and I've never met many\npeople I'm like that with 99 of people\nlike me I've been like that for a long\ntime but my wife's like that too and\nthat's really helped because then I\ndon't wake up in the morning and look at\nher and go oh God she's still judging me\nfor the mistake I made last night we've\nboth moved on and so mirroring that\nhabit is really powerful but the the two\nends of the spectrum are narcissism of\nlike you know like letting go of all\nmistakes which I know that's not what\nyou're recommending and then the other\nthing like you're saying is\nself-sabotage and beating yourself up\nforever and you have these two Polar\nOpposites and I think people get so\nscared that they they're doing one or\nthe other that they kind of avoid it\nwhat is the process to get to the\nForgiveness you're talking about where\nyou can allow yourself to move on so\nnarcissism is self-love without love for\nothers\nthat's why we start with compassion when\nyou start with compassion you are\ntraining your love for others when we\ncome to gratitude and forgiveness you're\nactually training your love for yourself\nin the Gratitude phase you don't just\nExpress gratitude for three things in\nyour work or three things in your\npersonal life you Express gratitude for\nwhat you love about yourself and that's\nbecause why shouldn't we the world\ndoesn't tell us to love ourselves since\nwe are kids our education system the\npeople around us point out our flaws\nmost people don't have a problem with\nself-love they have a problem with\nself-pity self-loathing with not enough\nself-love now when you come to the\nForgiveness stage you further amplify\nyour love for yourself but remember\nyou're doing these phases after you\nexpress love for everyone else\ncompassion first then gratitude and\nforgiveness and this is how you avoid\nnarcissistic Tendencies I think it's\nbecome more and more challenging because\nI think the rise of\nnarcissistic personalities and the\nchallenge that people are experiencing\nin their relationships is just on such a\nhigh I feel like it's one of the most\ntalked about things right now and I\nguess that also stems from that feeling\nof like we never got a chance to love\neach other so almost now we're going in\nthat direction with step four a vision\nfor the future this step is\nfor some people a hard step because the\nfuture is usually a place of anxiety\nright for most people the future is the\nplace of uncertainty of anxiety\nobviously you've done these three steps\nto remove anxiety Etc that's where it's\na perfect build up I've heard so many\nversions of what a good vision for the\nfuture some people say you should know\nexactly what you want some people say\nyou should have an overall Vision what\nis the six phase version when you finish\nphase three and you move to phase four\nyou're moving to a different essence of\nbeing my last book was called the Buddha\nand the badass and that title came from\na essay by the great philosopher Ken\nWilbur and that essay was called\negolessness and it starts like this the\ngreat spiritual sages and Saints of the\nworld from Moses to Jesus to patma\nsambhava were not feeble-minded milk\ntoasts they were movers and shakers who\nrattled the world with the force of\ntheir ego from they instigated massive\nsocial revolutions that lasted\nGenerations from bullwhips in the temple\nto subduing entire continents now what\nKenwood was saying is that the great\nspiritual teachers were not just focused\non the now they were focused on the\nfuture Jesus wanted to build a legacy\nBuddha preached because Buddha wanted to\nchange the institutions of that time the\nway the rich and the poor were Moses\nwanted to free his people Muhammad\nwanted to conquer and spread Islam to\nthe world paramahansa Yogananda came to\nAmerica to spread the wisdom of India\nall of these people had a vision for a\nfuture they wanted to create and that's\nreally important Mother Teresa wanted to\nfeed millions of people so\nif you really want to practice your\nspiritualness you can't just be sitting\non your meditation cushion you got to\nhave a vision for the future that's what\nphase four is about now to answer your\nquestion how much should you be specific\nhow much should you be unspecific well\nit depends on what you're manifesting so\nnow we can get into a little bit deeper\nspiritual ideas my friend Marie Diamond\nwho's a brilliant spiritual teacher from\nBelgium and someone I train with Maurice\nsays that what we manifest in the world\ncomes from three different parts of our\nbeing there is Our intention which is\nwhat we desire but that's only one third\nthen there is a destiny which is what\nour soul wants to experience\nthat's one-third and then the third\npiece is the energy of the world around\nus our home you know the Chinese call\nthis feng shui the people group\nConsciousness our culture our society\nit's all three of these so if you think\nof manifesting\nyou're a car going down a highway okay\nthat's your life all of us have a\nDestiny and a spiritual teacher explain\nthis to me he said Vision you can't go\nfor the exit Ram you are on one Highway\nyour highway is to spread Consciousness\nthrough education you can go on that\nexit ramp and go into a different\ndirection that's your Highway and I've\nnoticed this about my life every\nAdventure I've tried outside this zone\nof spreading wisdom and Consciousness\nfails it just becomes unnecessarily hard\nif I stick on my highway I go super fast\nso that highway is the destiny within\nthat Highway you can change lanes that's\nyour intention\nyou can change lanes you can go faster\nyou can go slower you can go left you\ncan go right and then there's the\nquality of the traffic is it stuck is\nthe traffic moving easily is the traffic\ncongested that's the group Consciousness\naround you so that's just an analogy to\nunderstand this so when you're\nmanifesting all three of these pieces\nare coming together now in the sixth\nbase if you go deeper into the wisdom of\nhow it's designed the protocol is\ndesigned to take all three of these into\naccount but in phase four what you're\ndoing is you're playing with intention\nuh intention but also leaving things\nopen for the universe to bring you for\nexample if you want to meet your soul\nmate you don't want to get super\nspecific because what if your soulmate\nis in a different age or a different\nbody type than what you think you want\nMichael Beckwith the spiritual Teacher\nCalls this mature versus immature\nwanting immature wanting is oh I want I\nI only want to be with someone who is\ntall and blonde and\num a blue-eyed that's what maybe Society\nor what you read in a magazine\ninfluenced you mature wanting is knowing\nthat your soulmate may come to you in\nmany different forms and it's going to\nbe an Essence an energy that's going to\nspark that love in you likewise when it\ncomes to a mission a vision sometimes we\ndon't know what the universe has set\nforth for us and so when you are\npracticing phase four the important\nthing that we ask people to keep in mind\nis to focus on the what and the why but\nto Pakistan the how the when and The Who\nso that's advice from Esther Hicks yeah\nthe what and the why don't worry about\nthe when when is it going to come who is\ngoing to bring me or who's going to be\nmy soulmate or who's going to give me\nthat job and the how how am I going to\nget that how am I going to meet that\nperson Esther says all of that adds\nresistance to that which we seek to\nmanifest the what and the why add\nforward momentum so you focus on that\nI love that yeah I've I've always\nrealized that you'll get to where you\nwant in life just not in the way you\nimagined it yeah and the problem is we\nhave this projection and Imagination of\nhow the path should look right not why\nwe want it or where we're going right\nand our paths change we Pierce different\nCircles of purpose you were once a monk\nand then you became a Storyteller and\nthen now you have this incredible\npodcast and now you're launching a Tea\nCompany you've pierced different Circles\nof Purpose with your purpose to help the\nworld getting bigger and bigger each\ntime and all of us are going to go\nthrough that we are not one thing yeah\nand I and I love that idea because I\nthink for me\nwhen we create and associate with\nidentities early in our lives it becomes\nharder and harder to shake them so I\nbecame a monk from age round 21 22 for\nthree years\nand that was a young time to create a\nvery distinct specific identity\nand shaking it off took a lot of effort\nto allow myself to keep the parts that\nwere still me but then to accept the new\nparts that were parts that maybe I'd\nnegated or neglected and and to really\nbecome and to evolve took so much effort\nand even now like I find allowing\nyourself\nto become new things is probably one of\nthe biggest challenges in the world\nbecause most of us are like oh I've\nalways been an accountant I've always\nbeen a lawyer I've always been a doctor\nand usually we just use our job titles\nto Define it and I was actually having\nthis conversation with one of my team\nmembers earlier today she was saying\nthat before she worked with us she had\nnever worked on a book or a book tour or\nyou know and we work your mind right now\nand I was like that's what I love about\nit like I don't care that you haven't\ndone that I'm interested in how you\nthink and how you approach problems and\nI'm intrigued by the fact that you don't\nknow the rules of this industry like\nthat excites me how can people find the\ncourage and strength to become new\nthings and not feel held back by old\nthings one of the most practice uh most\npowerful practices I've found is the\nlifebook protocol and we talk about it\nin the book so lifebook is a goal\nsetting protocol by John and Missy\nbutcher in the spirit of openness\nMindvalley acquired the company uh the\nmajority stake in the company we're now\nmerging it with mine Valley because it's\namazing we wanted I found it's the best\ngoal setting system in the world and we\nwanted to integrate it with our\neducation platform\nnow in life book one of the exercises\nyou do is you look at your life from 12\ndifferent buckets right your emotional\nlife is one bucket your financial life\nis one bucket your character is one\nbucket and already if you think about\nthat you find that most people tend to\nfocus on just a few limiting buckets\nthey focus on goals for finance goals\nfor relationships goals for work but are\nwe setting goals for the emotions we\nwant to experience on a day-to-day basis\nyeah an emotional Mastery I'll be\nsetting goals for the character how we\nwant to show up as a man or woman in the\nworld lifebook makes you go deep you\nreally have to think about it and at the\nend you end up with a hundred page\nvision for your life now within that\nhundred page Vision there are going to\nbe things which are going to be unclear\nand that's when the magic happens so I\nremember when I was doing life book in\n2010 there was a particular category of\nthe 12 categories called quality of life\nand this is really where you put down\nyour lifestyle your home and so I put\ndown some really crazy things because\nthey push you to dream big I was on the\nspeaker then I said I want to be\nspeaking on stages around the world I\nwant to vacation and five-star Resorts\naround the world I want inspiring\nfriends I want to go on trips with\ninspiring friends I put down even some\nreally like bold things I want to win an\nEmmy or a Grammy or an Academy Award\nwhatever yeah what happened is 10 months\nafter doing live books I certainly had\nthis weird impulse it came from my soul\nback then I was running a.com I'd\nstarted the.com I'd raised two million\ndollars in Venture Capital Money it\nwasn't mine value it was more like an\ne-commerce play like a Groupon clone for\nSoutheast Asia and I was feeling so\ndissatisfied I realized I'd been chasing\nan immature wanting I'd been chasing all\nof that stuff I was reading about in\nTech Publications and thinking I wanted\nto be one of those entrepreneurs but it\nwasn't for me and so I gave up my shares\nI quit that.com and then I needed to do\nsomething this was 2010 and I thought I\nwant to learn surfing what if I could\nget 250 people to join me in a beach in\nCosta Rica put on a little Festival\nwhere we can all study surfing maybe\nhave some personal growth talks and\nmaybe really have some great bonding\nevents at night\nthat random idea became a festival\ncalled afes afest that first Festival\nsold out it blew up and then it\ncontinued growing and growing and\ngrowing and within two years everything\nI put in my lifebook came true all of a\nsudden I was speaking on stage all of a\nsudden I had all of these amazing people\nLisa Nichols chip Conley all coming and\nspeaking on stage with me I had the\ninspiring friends all of a sudden I was\nstaying in these five-star Resorts\naround the world hotels were giving me\nthe presidential suite because I was\nbringing 250 people to their their\nproperty in Costa Rica and Mexico and\nthe craziest thing was this I put down a\nwanted to win an Emmy well Nick Nanton a\nfilm producer came to one of our a-fest\nhe turned it into a documentary called\nlive your quest and it won an Emmy it\nwon an Emmy and I was the producer and\nso all of these crazy goals came true\nnowhere that I put I want to invent a\nfestival rather I described the life I\nwanted to lead the quality of life and\nthe idea came to me and this important\nlesson here\nsometimes you don't want to put down the\njob your business your job your career\nis nothing more than a vehicle for your\ngrowth and the life that you want to\nlead\nmost people get more clear on the job I\nwant to be a lawyer than they do on how\nthey want to grow and the quality of the\nlife they want to lead yeah flip it\naround you got to get really clear on\nthe lifestyle how many hours do you want\nto work what do you want to do first\nthing in the morning who do you want to\nbe with how much time do you want to be\nable to spend with your kids who are\nyour friends where do you want to live\nget clear on the quality of life get\nclear on\nthe values you want to have\nand the ideal job will follow yeah and I\nthink that that\ngetting clear on the quality of life and\nthen those steps that are there to make\nsure that you show that priority in a\nsmall way like I find that don't you\nfind that everything that happened in a\nbig way in your life was because at one\npoint it was a small priority like I\nworked at a big consulting firm and I\nwould use all my vacation that I got\nto spend time with my spiritual teachers\nthis is after I left the monastery I\nwould spend all of it like so I wouldn't\ntake a vacation because I was like my\npriority is to still learn to still grow\nto still think like a monk at this point\nin my life even though I'm not a monk\nanymore because I was so scared of\nlosing that deep important part of my\nlife that I was like all right all the\nvacation I get this one I'm gonna do\nwith it and now I'm so grateful that\nsome of them will come live with me here\nsome of them I'll get to travel to and\nbut it's like because at that time it\nwas hard to make that a priority I had\nto sacrifice in one sense that this is\nwhat I was using my vacation for so what\nI'm interested in mission is\nwhat defines for you now a good\nmeditation what is a satisfying\nmeditation because I think this is like\na recurring challenge that all\nmeditation and guidance guides have so\npeople are like well did I do well like\ndid I do good because we only know how\nto we don't we've forgotten how to\nexperience we only know how to evaluate\nthat's what I've realized the human mind\nhas diminished in its ability to\nexperience and increased in its ability\nto evaluate and our evaluation is this\nwas either good or this was bad rather\nthan this was my experience so how do\nyou define what a satisfying positive\nmeditation is today so I look at the six\nqualities of the six face and at the end\nof the day did these qualities expressed\nthemselves in my life was I kind and\ncompassionate today so at the end of the\nnight you can you can basically before\ngoing to sleep you can ask yourself\nthese six questions who did I help today\nthat relates to compassion the second\nquestion is what was something that\ntruly made me come alive that made me\nhappy today that relates to phase two\nwhich is on gratitude the third one is\nwhat have I\ncome to learn and come to learn often\nrelates to forgiveness true forgiveness\nwe often learn what is a new vision or a\nnew desire that I saw today that I want\nto bring into my life that comes from\nphase four which is vision for the\nfuture now phase five is commanding your\nperfect day so what you may ask at Phase\nfive is what was my favorite part of\ntoday and then the final one phase six\nis a blessing this is almost like a\nprayer and at the end of the day you\nmight you might ask did I truly feel\nconnected to God to a higher power did I\nfeel that the Universe had my back today\nand if you ask yourself those six\nquestions you know you had a good six\nphase meditation so again that's just\nthe lens I use yeah yeah no I like that\nand I think it's it's useful to have\nsome sort of measuring stick because we\nall need to evaluate but that's a\nhealthy evaluation yeah as opposed to I\nthink just saying was it good or bad\nright is like irrelevant you went in a\ndirection there which I was interested\nin you're saying that the goal of\nmeditation or the work that you've done\nyou found that life is about growth and\nthe experience and the quality of life\nthat you want I think a lot of people\nDefine their Destiny quite early on in\nlife how do you test the parameters of\nyour destiny so I think one of the\nthings that I think is a useful tool is\nto understand the difference between\nmean skulls and end goals right very\noften your destiny\nthe stuff that you're meant to be doing\nis something that you would do if you\nwere not even getting paid for it very\noften we we do the opposite\nthink about the standard American System\nright\nso you have people so that one of the\nmost common jobs that Americans go into\nis law is Law and I'm not dishing on\nlawyers I'm just using this as a really\ninteresting thing because I used to work\nin the legal industry I used to to sell\nsoftware to law firms 20 something years\nback so America's five percent of the\nworld's population 70 of the world's\nlawyers why well maybe it was show us\nlike Ellie or Ellie McBeal in 1990s that\nglamorized law and so so many Americans\ngo into crazy amounts of study crazy\namounts of debt to become a lawyer to\npass their lsats to join a good Law Firm\nthen they're working crazy hours but\nhere's the thing if you are a lawyer you\nhave a 50 statistical chance of\nsuffering from clinical depression wow\nit's crazy so this large number of\nAmericans are going into a job that can\nmake you depressed at an astonishing\nrate but they do it why because they are\nfollowing the herd this is a classic\nexample of immature wanted you're\nwanting what everybody else wants not\nwhat could truly resonate with your soul\nand so the important thing is to really\nlook at what would you do\nthat even if you're not being paid\nit's something that you would do anyway\nbecause it makes you come alive yeah and\noften that is the stepping stone to\nwhere your dream career could be I was\nmeditating\nand I was I wanted to teach meditation\nbut I wanted to teach it because I was\nteaching it to my friends I was teaching\nit to my cousins because I was so\nexcited about it I remember a teacher\ntelling me you're never going to make\nmoney with that you need to be an\nengineer and I tried becoming an\nengineer I was miserable but with\nmeditation I built a massive massive\nmassive company I wrote hopefully my\nthird New York Times bestseller because\nI was simply but I never did it for\nmoney I was doing it because it brought\nme joy and if you look at so many of the\nmost successful people in the world they\ntook what they did that brought them Joy\nand they turned it into an incredible\ncareer and that would be my advice to\npeople absolutely everyone
