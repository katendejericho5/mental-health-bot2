    "transcript": "you know you you can think of the human\nintestinal tract as a 30ft long conveyor\nbelt you put contents on it at one end\nand as it traverses to the other end\nfrom the stomach to the rectum there's a\nvery specific sequence of events that\nneeds to occur there's acidic bacteria\nin the proximal end of the small\nintestine there's there's alkaline\nbacteria and the distal end near the\nrectum what if you just changed the pace\nof that conveyor belt what if you went\ninto any factory in America that works\non a conveyor belt system and double the\nspeed of the conveyor belt the whole\nline would break down what if you went\ninto any factory in America and revers\nthe speed of conveyor belt the whole\nline would break down but there's\nnothing wrong with a conveyor Bel"
