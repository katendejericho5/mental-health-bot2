present with you and get to\nreally experience you and how great you\nare well first of all i want to\ncongratulate you on that transformation\nand transition i think that\nto acknowledge\nyou even just saying that and how much\nwork you've had to do to get there to\nfeel that way and like i said to you i\nhad a positive experience with you even\nthen thank you and so i'm very grateful\nto experience you as you said in what\nyou feel is\nthe best version of yourself at the\nmoment which is so beautiful and\ni loved a video i saw on your tick tock\nokay which was you and your dad okay and\nit was so beautiful and it was like i\nthink you said something like you know i\nwish these days never end yeah like tell\nme about what was so special about that\ni mean just watching it was it just it\nwas so joyful\nand it was so special honestly that's a\ncommon feeling i get whenever i'm with\nhim or with my family honestly with life\nin general i just wish the days were\nlonger oh you've caught me on like an\nemotional day so if i cry during this\npodcast guys this is like a normal thing\nfor me kind of but um\nthat's just a common feeling i get\nespecially when i'm home in nashville\njust wishing i had more time but that\ntrip was great i hadn't seen my dad\nin a long time and lately i've been able\nto since that\ntick tock actually which was posted last\nyear i think or was it or earlier that\nreally early this year it had to have\nbeen but it's an older tick tock i've\nbeen able to see him much more\nfrequently but\nwhen i had been writing for this album\nactually the album's out on september\n16th and i had written about that\nspecific feeling actually like a couple\nyears ago and it's actually the title\ntrack of my record hardest part and i\nwrote about that with my dad because i\njust you know growing up he would be in\nnashville i would be in la or\nback and forth and there was a lot of\nmissing him and i guess it's really\nno\nuh\nsecret that my family had been going\nthrough hard times and with in their\nmarriage and things like that and so\nthere was a lot\nthat was unsaid between us and i\nwanted to write about it in my music and\nmy music is really an outlet for me and\nmy emotions and i don't know we had a\nreally beautiful day a few years ago\nwhich wasn't when i made that tick tock\nbut i wrote about it in my in my record\njust because\ni wish i could get more of those days\nand there's just not enough time and\nyeah yeah no it was it was beautiful to\nsee and yeah now i think i think you\npinned it that's why\nyeah it's not very clear it's pinned at\nthe top yeah yeah\nthe yeah the tick tock's old but the\nsong is about an even older\nstory but that yeah there was a trends\nare cool like that would take talk i'll\nsee something on take talk and i'm like\noh that actually really means something\nlike we should do that and my friend\namari was like you have to do this with\nyour dad i love that no it was so\nspecial it was it was really\njoyful and special to watch and\nspeaking about what you're talking about\nyou were saying you've said that your\ngoal is really the current goal is to\nlike really heal your inner child\nand i think that's such a beautiful goal\nto have first of all and i think a lot\nof our community a lot of our listeners\nhave that same goal as well i think\nwe're all going through this experience\nof realizing that we've neglected our\ninner child we haven't listened to that\nin a child we haven't acknowledged it\nhow did you even\ndiscover that that was a goal you had\nlike how did you even come to that point\nof acknowledging that that was something\nyou wanted to pursue\nidentifying my emotions and what was\ncausing a lot of my problems and and\nthen making that connection to childhood\nwas first of all the start\num and with that i probably wouldn't\nhave even been able to make that\nconnection had it not been for my\ntherapist and\nreally really really trying with therapy\nbecause even i feel like when we spoke i\ni had a relationship with my therapist\nthat i would kind of\ntry to reschedule our sessions and i\nwouldn't keep up with it and i would\nfall behind it's actually a lot of work\nto keep up with it um because you know\nsome days you're going to feel really\ngood and for me it's hard for me on\nthose good days to\nwant to keep up or maybe i don't want to\nstart feeling sad feelings or bring\nanything up and but it's actually really\nimportant to keep working and so once i\nidentified that like\ni had a lot of sadness involved with my\ninner child and i had a lot i needed to\nheal\nbut i really really owe that to therapy\nand i and i\nreally highly suggest just an outlet of\nbeing able to get your emotions out\nsomewhere\nwhere regardless of what that outlet is\nfor you yeah i i think that's\nbeautifully said and what were some of\nthose emotions that you felt as a child\nor that you experienced that became so\nimportant for you to heal like what were\nsome of those experiences that stayed\nwith you one major one was\nself-love and and body image um love and\nand body dysmorphia i developed that at\nsuch a young age\nand it's been really hard for me to\nreframe my mind to to be able to even\nlook at my younger self and love\nthat version of me\nand now that i've begun to get there i'm\nnow there and you know for me that was\nso heartbreaking that i couldn't i felt\nlike i couldn't even really love a child\nmyself as a child i felt like i wasn't\neven loving that version of myself and i\ncould never imagine not loving a child\nyou know what i mean but i and and so\nthat was where i knew i needed to start\nand now of course i want to protect that\nversion of myself so much because i just\nsee this fragile\nchild who is like every child in the\nworld that just needs love and and\nto be cared for and of course i was i\nhave an amazing family but there's just\nsome things that\nespecially i mean in my in my personal\nexperience with body image that just\nsome things people just can't see that\npeople just can't feel because it's your\nbody your mind your eyes you know and\nit's hard and it feels like you're alone\nin those times and in your brain it's\njust you in there with that inner voice\nand it and it gets really dark and it\ngets really lonely especially i mean\ncertainly in my\nexperience yeah and how does it feel\nwhen everyone around you is saying oh\nbut you're beautiful or you're this so\nyou're that like\nwalk us through a bit of that because i\nthink a lot of people have that\nchallenge where like everyone's telling\nyou\nyou're great but then there's still this\nvoice inside of you that feels that way\nwhat were some of those\nwhat's been some of the work behind the\nscenes that you've been doing in therapy\nand for yourself to kind of get to that\nplace of self-acceptance and self-love\nas you said earlier\nthat's very much still a work in\nprogress for me and\nsomething my therapist and i talk about\nis how progress is\nkind of in you're going up but it's\ncircular motions and in a circle you\nstill go down and then you go up and you\ngo down and\nso i'm going through that very much with\nself-love and with my body image my\npersonal experience was online\nand in other places\ni was bullied over the way i looked so\nterribly\nlike the word the words that were used\nare still so\nscarring to me where i'm almost\nembarrassed to bring it up or talk about\nit like it was very traumatizing for me\nso it was very hard for me to believe\nwhat people in my life was saying so it\ngave me actually a lot of trust issues\nthat weren't there with people in my\nlife because i felt as if everybody was\nlying to me which is still actually\nsomething i work on now still is my\ntrust with people and and going with\nthings and just being okay with this is\nme this is my body this is who i am this\nis what god gave me this is this is just\nwho i am there's nothing i can do to\nchange it and and you know while i'm\nhere i've got to accept it and i'm\nreally working hard to do so\nyou know it gives me comfort if\nit gives anybody else comfort that it\ngives me comfort that you tell me other\npeople\nfeel that way when other people are\nsaying you are this you are beautiful\nyou are that because\nwhen you feel the opposite\nin your body and your mind and your soul\nyou're not you're never going to hear it\nfrom anybody else\nand it's the same with you know loving\nyourself and and you know you have to\ntruly love yourself and and and it's and\nit's hard to get there if you don't it's\nso encouraging though to hear that\nyou went through this experience earlier\non\nyet you've still found a way\nof expressing how you feel in the public\neye\nand still being open\nto\npeople's\nopinions and their\nreaction to you and that's takes\nincredible like\nconfidence and and self-assurance\nbecause a lot of people would just say\nor i'm done with this i'm just going to\ngo and hide\nlike i just i feel that way every day\nyeah every day so again it's like kind\nof a battle with myself but\ni feel that way all the time when you\nsay confident i definitely don't feel\nthat word yeah majority of the time\nactually maybe ever but i\ni'm constantly learning and constantly\ngrowing yes and those are the two best\nthings like that to me that's what i\nwhere i use that word it was like people\ndon't usually feel confident or they're\nnot confident\nbut the way they act actually displays\nconfidence and i think that's what's so\ninteresting about confidence is that\nno one who ever is confident feels it\nit's just that people from the outside\ngo wow that takes a lot of guts so like\nthat still takes a lot of resilience and\nand that's what i'm noticing that you\nknow to still be in the public eye but\nwalk us through you know we're talking\nabout the hardest part which is you know\nincredible to see you putting your\nchallenges stress pain into music\nwhen did\nwhen did music start to become that\nhealing for you and\nwhat was beautiful about the process\nbehind this album like\nwhat did you experience in the making of\nthis album\nmusic's always been extremely healing\nbut especially with this album\nthe process of finishing it up on the\nproduction side with mike crossy he\nexecutive produced the entire album\nwe\nspent\na couple months together\njust him and i and steven his engineer\nand a couple days\ntowards the end we'd have musicians in\nbut just locked in focused on the music\nit was the first time\never in my life\nor in my career i should say that i felt\nreally in touch with my own musicianship\nand\nmyself as like an actual artist not just\na singer and a writer\nit came at a time where\ni was about six months into\nmy recovery process\ni really needed some structure\nsomething to focus on something to put\nmy energy towards an outlet for my\nemotions even if i wasn't writing i had\nwritten a few songs that actually just\nhad to go onto the album like my side of\nthe bed is one of my favorites on the\nwhole album or i burned l.a down which\nwas the first single off of the record\noccasionally i would get to lyrically\nmake that get that outlet from my\nemotions but musically i really found a\nway to do so and it really shows in the\nrecord and it was that's what made it\nsuch a healing process was i feel like i\nreally found myself\nsonically\nlyrically and emotionally and\nspiritually on this record that's\nincredible i i love what you pointed out\nthen it came out it flowed naturally\nfrom you but for everyone who's\nlistening i just want to capture this\nyou said that\nduring your recovery process six months\nin\nyou found structure\nfocus and an outlet\nand i think all of those things are such\nbeautiful takeaways everyone who's\nlistening may not be a musician or a\nwriter\nor a singer but the idea that we all\nneed when we're going through our own\nrecovery structure a focus and an outlet\nand those are such practical ways that\nwe can shift where we are\nwalk us through some of that what was\nyour structure like like what what were\nyou what was your focus like were you\nthinking about something when you woke\nup in the morning when you were writing\nthe song like\nwhat was your daily routine like and\nwhat were your habits like at that time\nso at the time of recording the album we\nhad which i loved the whiteboard we had\na whiteboard in the studio love white\nboys but it had our week out and every\nsingle week\non fridays we'd sit and plan out what we\nwere going to do for the next week so\nfor example\none week would be vocals week and we'd\ndo each song like in a day\nand then um\nwe'd also have like okay\nthis next week we're going to be\nrecording bass guitar\nstrings whatever\ni go in after i'd have therapy in the\nmorning wake up walk my dogs do therapy\ngo to\nthe studio\nrecord whatever\n[Music]\ninstruments we were doing that day\nwhatever vocals and\nreally get to experiment with\nthis new elevated\nsound that i was making\num and so really we just had like this\nstrict schedule that like every day i\nwas in at a certain time and by the end\nof the day we both had mike has two kids\nso bedtime's eight o'clock he needs to\nleave at six we just had our daily\nroutine which i think saved me so much\nbecause\nwithout a daily routine\ni'm very the type that can easily just\nslip into my room and not turn the\nlights on or get out of bed for like\nweeks\nand i've actually been having\na bit of\na back and forth battle with kind of\ndoing that now and just\nself-isolation because i'm so used to\ndoing so\nso really just having even if it was\njust you know a studio\nroutine where it was this day we're\nrecording this and this day we're\ntracking this or this day we're zooming\nthis person or they're coming in here\nit really like saved me and falling in\nlove with music again saved me because i\nthink it's all so easy to\nalienate yourself or get alienated by\nthings you love whenever\nwhenever you're doing it such a long\ntime or you know\nthings get tough and you know things\ndon't go your way and then they do go\nyour way so suddenly so i guess the\npoint is just keep going and never give\nup and you know but\nit gets hard yeah i love that point you\nmade it's so interesting how we can\nfall out of love with something that\nwe're so deeply in love with i i can so\nrelate to that in so many ways\nlet's let's talk about that because i\nthink that's just a fascinating idea i\nthink we think that when you're in love\nwith a thing an idea a person\na place a home we expect that once\nyou're in love you just stay in love\nand like you were saying earlier with\nyour therapist it's more like the other\nway like you fall in you fall out it\nchanges it grows it moves you fall in\nyou fall out it changes it grows\nhow have you learned to fall in love\nwith music again structure was a part of\nthat was there something else that\nhelped you fall back in love with\nsomething that you'd fallen out of love\nwith well what made actually a better\nquestion is what made you fall out of\nlove with music and then what helped you\nfall back in love i'm not sure if i ever\ncompletely felt out of love yeah i think\nafter\ndoing this since i was 16 years old\nthere's been a lot of times where i've\nfelt really encouraged to keep going but\nthere's also a little\ndiscouragement at times it's hard\nwhenever there's a lot of\npeople in your ears and people wanting\nyou to be a certain way and do a certain\nthing and\nso i think\nfor a long time i didn't trust my own\nvision because i felt as if other people\ndidn't either\nand so i almost just kind of wanted to\ngive up and didn't really have a vision\nat all but being able to go and\nexperiment and\nfind who i am sonically and what that\nsounds like to me and\nyou know there's so much of me on that\ntrack i'm playing piano on that track\ni'm playing sub i'm playing percussion\ni'm playing they're just even if they\nwere just little bits of sounds like it\nwas me and i was inside of it all the\ninstruments are live i got to\nyou know i\nfor so long piano was my favorite\ninstrument for so long but now it's\npedal steel and you know and i just i've\nfallen in love with instruments again\nand um that ignited so much excitement\nfor me and it ignited so much excitement\nwith the album campaign and performing\nand and everything that comes with\nmusic and and being able to experience\nwhat it's like once it's out of the\nstudio and so that really ignited a lot\nof excitement in me again yeah and then\nagain like again the writing process was\nalso amazing a lot of it was painful at\nthe time a lot of it was maybe\nin bits and pieces and different\ntimelines of\nwhere i was personally but i think\nthat's also what makes it special the\nalbum definitely is very dynamic with\nwith the sounds and the instruments\nsonically there's a lot of emotions a\nlot of conversations but to your point\nreally quick about the falling in and\nout of love weirdly enough\nfriday or tonight actually at 9 00 pm i\nhave a song coming out with ben gibbard\nof death cab for cutie and it's one of\nmy favorite bands of all times he's one\nof my favorite artists ever\nand our song\nis about that feeling of\nit's not you genuinely it's not me\ngenuinely\nwe're just falling out of love like\nthat's just we're not the same anymore\nwe're we've grown we've been we've we've\nwe're drifting apart and i think that\nreally does happen with people\ni know both people\nfrom personal experience and from\nwitnessing\nothers\nhave to be fully invested in one another\nand both have to want to light that fire\nagain\nand if just one of you don't then\nit it really it's\nnearly i think impossible to get that\nback yeah and i couldn't agree that's so\nthat's so beautifully said i couldn't\nagree with you more that\ni think that's what often\nis the truth that we don't want to\naccept is that someone doesn't want to\ntry again no we don't even want to\naccept that because it's so painful to\naccept where we're like we want to try\nagain but that person doesn't want to\ntry again and and that's the hardest\npart like that that's really tough\nbecause you're like but i'm still in\nthis\nbut then\nwhat i find interesting about what you\njust said there yet it's also that\nperson realizing well i'm still in this\nbecause i still think that person's the\nsame as who they were but now using your\nwords you're like we've just outgrown\neach other like do you think people\nchange\nlike do people change i put out this ep\nright and i titled it people don't\nchange because a lot of in my personal\nexperience yeah i set out to want to\nchange and i think i'm in the process of\nchanging my life i don't know if i can\nexactly change who i am at the core what\ndo you what do you think about that\nthat's such a great question because i\ngo back and forth i don't and if\nsomebody asked me i wouldn't know but i\ni want to know your take on it yeah i\nwould say\ni do believe\nthat transformation and change\nis possible\nbut\nit's not very probable\nthe probability\nis low but the possibility is high and\nwhat i mean by that is everyone has the\nopportunity to change\nbut the path is long\nhard and often requires\nbig amounts of tragedy stress and\nturmoil to\neven get someone to have that\nopportunity to take that path and so i\ndon't think i would ever write off i\ngenuinely believe in real transformation\nand change and i believe in the\npossibility of it i think the\nprobability and the expectation and the\nspeed we want it to happen at is\nunlikely i also believe that people\ndon't change for people\nand i think that's often when we say\npeople will change it's often us the\nreal full sentence people will change\nfor me\nright and i think that's really what\nwe're saying and that i don't agree with\ni don't think someone changes for\nsomeone else i think people change for\nthemselves when they realize that\nif i don't change then that's not good\nfor me\nbut the probability of that happening is\nlow until something massively painful or\ndrastic happens in their life and i\nagree with you on the core thing like\ni look at i went through a huge change\nexternally in terms of i became a monk i\nleft my time as a monk that i lived for\nthree years in india and then i\nlived the life i do today and but i'm\nstill the same person i always was at\nthe core like what you said like at the\ncore i'm the same person i was raised by\nmy mom she told me to be polite i like\npeople i'm kind\nthese are things i learned from my mom\nwhen i was a kid\nand i'm still all those things\nand i've grown but i'm still the same\nperson at the core and so\ni think that people can i've seen\namazing changes in people i've seen\npeople who've gone from doing the worst\nthings to doing the best things i've\nseen people go from but\nthe probability is not as high and it\nwon't happen for a person so i don't\nknow if that helps answers your\nquestions no it does yeah yeah because i\nmean it's kind of exactly\nhow i feel about it too oh good yeah no\ni mean i agree like and you know from\nexperience of\nseeing that i mean even in positive ways\nyou don't have to look at it as a\nnegative way\nnot losing yourself and who you are at\nthe core like i mean\ni feel like i lost that for a long time\nand in a positive way i got it back\num and again that was a lot to do with\nwho i am\nand who i was as a younger\nchild yeah um\nbecause i also felt that change and\nshift in myself at such a young age i\nmean i still look at 17 and 18 years old\nas\na child to me and and very very young\nand\nlived on my own at 17 and thought i had\nthe whole thing figured out and you know\nvery quickly after\neverything shifted very drastically and\nyou know until i was\nmaybe just a year ago i started feeling\nlike who i was\nwhen i put my very first single out\nmaybe\nmaybe even way way way before i don't\nreally remember when i truly lost or\nstarted\ndisconnecting from who i really am or\nstarted disliking or\nnot loving who i really was yeah yeah\nand actually i think you've just\nanswered it like i think ultimately when\nwe're both talking about change we're\ntalking about growth yeah absolutely and\nit's like what you've been saying this\nwhole interview so far it's like you're\nlike it's an everyday thing it's a work\nin progress i'm still working on it like\nthat's what growth is and i think\nwhen we look at growth in ourselves we\nrealize it's a daily process but when we\nlook at change in someone else we want\nit to be drastic and tomorrow\nabsolutely right it's different\nexpectations we have of change if that\nmakes sense no that was a really good\nway to put it yeah like you know it's\nlike i know if i need to change it's\ngoing to take a few years\nbut i'm hoping this person changes\ntomorrow yeah yeah and that's where i\nthink our expectations and change kind\nof get too mixed up so change is\npossible our expectation is a slightly\nmessy i think what's a big change you\nthink you've made in your life that has\nhad a big change externally like\ninternally what is a change that you've\nmade even a simple thing that you feel\nhas i mean the most major change for me\nwas was stop taking xanax that\ncompletely i was ruining my life it\nit was the scariest\nmost\nalone i had ever felt except\nit made me feel as if i had comfort\nwhenever i\nwas\non\nyeah the substances i was taking at\nwhich time\nthat was you know the poison that i\nreally had to get out of my life and um\nmake that change\nhad i not done that i\ntouch on it on the album but i'm not\n100 sure i would have been able to be\nsitting here\nhaving this conversation with you\nbecause i didn't really want to\nbe alive anymore\nyou know when i did\nhave this\nmoment\nof clarity even if it was for a second i\ndid not want to forget that i had one\nthought that like maybe i could turn\nthis around i called who i needed to\ncall and i made that change so\nabsolutely without a doubt i mean that's\njust the first thing that comes to mind\nbecause\nhad i not done done that like i come i\nit saved my life getting off of off of\nxanax so that's a that's amazing thank\nyou so much for being so open and\nvulnerable with us i can tell that\nobviously it's not an easy thing to talk\nabout especially when it's\nbeen a part of your life in that way so\nthank you so much yeah and and even more\nso just that's incredible like that's\namazing and and you know i think there's\nso many people listening and watching\nwho i'm sure\ntheir family members they've been in\nthat position you know i think\nit's incredible isn't it how lonely you\ncan be made to feel when actually it's a\nhugely collective experience\num and and i think that's going to help\na lot of people you're sharing that and\nthat making that change in your life\nthank you and and being with you today\ni'm like that's that's amazing it's\ntruly incredible thank you yeah i think\ni think we need to\nuh acknowledge and celebrate that more\nbecause\nagain it takes so much strength\nthank you yeah i just hope honestly i\nthink my goal\nwith all of this and being open about it\nis\ni do know\nthat\num\ni'm not trying to be an example for\nanybody\ni'm just trying to share my experience\nbecause i also had\na lot of people i mean we did a podcast\nyears ago i have i've had a music music\ncareer since i was 16 years old i had a\nlot of people looking in since i was\na baby\njust due to the family i was born in and\nwith instagram and social media and\nthings like that interviews i felt that\na part of me was seen that you know i\nallowed out there but i really wanted an\nexplanation for i think a lot of like\nthe things i had posted on my instagram\nand i felt like there were a lot of\nthings like you know friends reaching\nout worried about me after i would post\nan instagram story and you know just the\nlook in my eyes was\nscary to a lot of people and\nthere's a few interviews in particularly\nwhen i just hear the way i was talking\nwhere i feel\nso ashamed and so guilty and i think\nthat's another thing\nis like the shame and the guilt and the\nregret\nis inevitable when going through this\nso\nfor anyone listening to know that that's\nnormal\num and that's something i experience\nevery single day even though i know i\nprobably shouldn't it's\nit's just something you experience and\nit's it's something i'm going through\nand go through and sometimes it's better\nand sometimes it's worse\nbut i it's just all part of the process\nyeah again i think that also goes back\nto just learning to love yourself and\nand look out for yourself and nurture\nyourself whenever you're\nbeing so hard on yourself or completely\nchanging your life you know but\ni go hard on myself about before and\nwhat it was like\ntwo years ago or three years ago and\nthat's just something i'm processing and\ndealing with\nas of now\nyeah and i think that that's that's i\nlove what you said that it's it's not\nabout being an example it's just\nencouraging to\nto hear\nthat that is what you go through i think\nit's so interesting that every day we\nfeel hot and we feel cold\nand we feel\nmaybe sweaty we feel\nreally cold we feel like we're freezing\nlike we go through so many different\nbody changes every day and we would\nnever judge ourselves for that we\nwouldn't be like oh i'm the worst i\nshould have worn a longer sleeve t-shirt\nlike you just go and put a sweater on or\nwhatever and i think it's the same with\nour emotions like we're experiencing so\nmany emotions throughout the day but we\ndon't give ourselves the permission to\nsay i'm allowed to feel cold and then\nget a sweater to feel warm like we don't\ndo that with our emotions if that makes\nsense and saying hey i do feel a bit of\nshame but then maybe i need to feel a\nbit of this to help\nyou know even it out and so i love that\nthat's the process you're on and\ni agree with you it's a daily thing i\ndon't think there's anyone who never\njust like there's no one in the world\nwho never feels hot or cold there's no\none who doesn't feel sad or down or\nhappy or unhappy like we're all feeling\nall of them at different spectrums and\ndifferent extremes\nso\nlearning our own patterns and learning\nour own thoughts\nis is pretty much\nyou know what we all need to focus on so\ni i wanted to pick something that this\nwas a lyric from i burned down uh bernd\nla down and you said\nand obviously it's about feeling like\nyou have to burn l.a down to get\nsomeone you're dating his attention but\nthis is the lyric that i thought was\nreally beautiful you s i'm good i can't\nsing so please do not expect anything\ni'm just going to read it out okay i\nwaste my breath on a prayer you don't\ncare\ni was never part of the plan\nyou can't make a god of somebody who's\nnot even half\nof half a decent man like that lyric is\njust it's a pretty cold lyric yeah yeah\nyeah but it's also just like a very raw\nemotion and i thought it was it's it's\ncold but it's poetically put together so\nit's it's it's powerful and i think a\nlot of people could relate to that i\nthink that i wanted to pick a few\nmoments if you don't mind if that lyric\nthe you can't make a god of somebody i\nfind that such an interesting concept i\nthink so many of us are looking for god\nin the people we idolize the people we\nfollow the sports teams the musicians\nthe actors the even parents and people\nin our lives like we're all\nlooking for that god figure in so many\nways and you know you rightly say in\nthat lyric uh you can't make a god of\nsomebody like where did that come from i\nwanted to hear that idea because i\nthought that was really powerful concept\nmy\npoetic way of always just completely\nfalling into people and how much i\ncompletely rely and give myself to\npeople\ni think obviously i've been very open\nthat it's been hard to rely on myself in\nthe past i always looked in that for\nother in in other people\nat the time especially of\ncovid and everybody's isolation\nit was just me and that one other person\nand so my entire life revolved around\nthat one other person\nevery single day whether\nthey were happy they were sad if they\nwere comfortable uncomfortable if they\nwere mad or not mad if they loved me or\ndidn't love me my entire life became\nwhat\nrevolved around somebody else\ni've definitely done that in the past\nand like you said again\npeople with\nuh are like that\ncan be with many different things it's\nfinding the right things\nto do that with and and with me it was\nmy album and\nworshiping\nmusic and actually finding myself and\nwho i am and loving myself but that was\nwhere that lyric came from is just\nit felt like worship\nthe way that i admired this person and\nthen you had to redirect that worship\ntowards your music and your craft and\nyour creativity would you say that's\ncorrect absolutely and i think also\ni've been thinking a lot about my\nspirituality lately and i think that's a\nhuge different conversation for a whole\nother time but you know i just hope\nfalling in love with other things and\nthe world's so interesting and\nuh the universe is so interesting and\nenergy is such a powerful thing and i\njust i want to learn more about it and\nand and\ngod and and what that is to me and other\npeople and who and just it's all\nso\ninteresting and i just want to know i\nwant to learn more i want to grow more\nagain like i said this all goes back to\ngrowing instead of using the word change\ngoing going going toward going growing i\nthink is good yeah yeah no i i i can\nrelate to a lot of that in the sense of\nlike i feel i was always in love with\nlove growing up\nyeah me too i i fantasized that majorly\nsame and and all of it was based on\nromantic songs and movies and none of it\nwas based on reality it was all based on\npop culture and media and you know and\nand i\nfor a long time i\ni really pursued that type of love\nand that was that love that was based on\nidolizing someone else worshiping\nsomeone else wanting also to be\nidolized back and and recognizing that\nthere was a part of me that was really\nseeking that importance through that\nother individual\nin the guise of loving them and\ni think when i\ncame to the conclusion that\nsimilarly to what you're saying actually\nyou can't make a god of somebody it's\nlike you can't make a god of yourself\neither you know and that that was a\nreally beautiful reflection but it's\nit's a painful one because\nwe get so trained and\nwired to believe certain things what's\nuh\nwhat's a belief that you think you have\nnow\nabout yourself that is healthy and\nputting you in the right direction and\nhelping you grow\nuh you talked about some of the beliefs\nin the past that have helped you back\nwhat's a belief now that you have about\nyourself that\nthat is helping you move forward and in\nthis positive direction\nthat i can just\ni can do what i\nset my mind to do whether that's\nwith recovery\nor\nother things i used to just say i can't\nand or i won't or\nbut i actually have\nshown\nto myself so many times what i can do\nand i think that's something that like i\nrepeat to myself every day\ni also have\nyou will be tatted on my on my wrist\nwhich i kind of think is kind of the\nsame thing just that\ni will be what i set my mind to or what\ni set my goals to or who i want to\nbecome or who i want to work on being\nand i hope that's kind of enough that's\ngreat it's just that i just\ni i had so much doubt in myself and\nthat's something that\nhas held me back for so long so i think\nknowing that and believing that in\nbelieving that truly and to my core is\nnew for me uh and something i can truly\nhonestly say i feel about myself i also\nhave a hard time\nyou know even when you say that like\ni may\nback to the confidence thing i sound\nlike i really believe in myself but at\nthe same time i have battles where i\nactually have a hard time doing so\nor saying kind things about myself or\nyou know so it's kind of a hard battle\nso that was kind of the first thing that\ncame to\nmind\ni thought it was a beautiful answer\nbecause i'm like isn't that just such a\ngreat thought\nto repeat that if i want to change\nsomething i can like\ni can with this journey i'm going\nthrough therapy this journey i'm going\nthrough recovery like that's that's such\nan empowering thought and i think it's\nso\namazing how we quickly believe\nnegative thoughts about ourselves but we\ndoubt the positive thoughts and it's\nlike every day if i told myself which i\nhave at times like i'm not good enough\ni'm not good enough i'm not good enough\ni don't ever question that thought i'm\nso cool with accepting that that's just\nthe truth and i don't think about\nwhether i say every day or not i just\nkeep saying it whereas when i say i can\nthen we're like oh wait wait did i say\nthat too early maybe i don't maybe i\ndon't believe it and and so i actually\nloved that that was your answer because\ni think that is the beginning of all\nchange and growth is saying i can do\nanything i put my mind to\nand and i have control over what i put\nmy mind to and so i i actually think\nit's a it's a really great answer and\ni'm hoping that everyone who's listening\nto that can start making that shift in\ntheir life\ni had a mentor who would always repeat\nnapoleon hill to me\nand so he'd always say to me you become\nwhat you think about and he'd get me to\nrepeat it you'd be like keep saying that\nyou become what you think about you\nbecome what you think about\nand then he'd catch me off guard\nrandomly when he'd see me and he'd look\nat me and be like jay what are you\nthinking about i'd be like nothing and\nhe goes well you become what you think\nabout see what you're going to become\nnothing like and he just play with that\nand then it was i was like oh\ninteresting what am i thinking about\nwhat do i obsess over like what do i\nkeep repeating in my mind and it was\njust something as simple as that\nthat started me to be like okay well i'm\nthinking about my purpose i'm thinking\nabout my service i'm thinking about how\nto have an impact in the world i'm\nthinking and then i just started seeing\nmy life change and it is that simple in\nthe beginning and so i actually think\nthat was a beautiful answer sir\nthank you for sharing it uh noah i could\nhonestly and i hope i do get to have\nthat conversation with you another time\nas you said there's a whole separate\nconversation around spirituality yeah\ndiscovery but we end every episode uh\nwith a new segment that we started\nrecently which i love uh called the many\nsides to us okay uh and this is where\nyou're using words or phrases to talk\nabout yourself through different\nperspectives so\ni'm gonna ask you the questions and and\nyou can answer them so the first one is\nwhat's a word or phrase that someone\nwould say about you meeting you for the\nfirst time now today i don't know\ni think this is hard can i give you one\nyes you give me like exactly yeah yeah\nso i met you today for the first time in\nperson\nand\ni the word that came to my mind was\nsincere\nokay really sincere okay\nyou were so sincere and genuine\nuh in\nyour initial words to me and what we\nwere talking about when you first came\nin and there was just so much sincerity\nand genuineness there so okay that's how\ni think you know okay all right thank\nyou so i did that for you so thank you\nthat's good i'm hopefully not going to\nhave a hard time with this i don't the\nrest will be easy uh what is a word that\nyou use that someone would describe you\nthat knows you well or word or a phrase\nthat someone who knows you really deeply\nwould use to describe you\nsensitive\nyeah\nsensitive\nin good and bad ways i think sensitive\ncan be taken as like a bad thing but\nit's actually\ni'm a very sensitive person and i think\nthe person i'm thinking of would be my\nmom if you were to and i think that was\nmy mom telling me that\ni'm very sensitive i love though that\nwhat you've been doing today you've done\nit twice now it's like you're always\nlooking at how each quality and value\ncan actually be\nnegative but also positive like you know\nit can be healthy too yeah and i think\noften like you said like i initially are\nsensitive yeah people are so sensitive\nand it's like well no no being sensitive\ncan actually be one of the healthiest\nthings i love that it gives you a lot of\ncompassion towards other people as well\nit's\nnot like how you said like oh you're so\nsensitive you know actually i'll take it\nthe wrong way sometimes\nwhat do you mean so if i think maybe if\nshe had my mom had said that on a\ndifferent day i probably won't take it\nall right uh question number three\nwhat's a word or phrase you'd use to\ndescribe yourself\nsensitive\num\ni'm very loving towards other people and\nother things and like so towards myself\nbut i mean\nso i've whenever people\nwe actually i have we talked about this\nin therapy i have a hard time talking\nabout my it's very evident talking about\nmyself personally but whenever i do talk\nabout things about myself i think it's\nthe way that i\ngive to other people so i'm an extremely\nloving and giving\nperson thank you for having the cards to\ncompliment compliment yourself i love it\nyeah no it's yeah that's great i love\nthat that's a great answer all right uh\nlast two questions what's a word or\nphrase you'd use to describe the hardest\npart the album\nhonest is such a vague\nanswer\num\nbut i mean it's just extremely honest\nand open and it touches on so many\nparts of my life um like i said in so\nmany different situations\ni also use the word personal a lot too\njust because literally the first song on\nmy album is called noah and so i think\nin a way\ni was nervous at first like how are\nthese how are people going to hear this\nand make it relate to themselves but i\nthink honestly by being so honest is\nwhere people will be like oh i actually\ndo feel that too because if you're not\nthen other people aren't going to be\nrelate to\ni think every feeling sometimes\nsometimes my thoughts feel like i'm the\nonly person that's ever had this thought\nin the world and then i like go on\ninstagram or tick tock and i see people\ntalking about their feelings and they're\nlike i feel that feeling you know so\nprobably that i would say very a vague\nword\nnot a va it may be a common word but the\ndescription that you just gave of like\nyeah that feeling of connectivity i\nthink is really powerful like i think\ni think that's why it is important to\ntalk about how we feel and what we're\ngoing through so we realize we're not\nthe only ones you know i mean\ni i think a lot of people suffer in\nsilence and and suffer in\na place because they do feel\nisolated and alone because then they\ndon't check with someone because they\ndidn't feel comfortable too yeah uh you\nknow i i have a very minor totally minor\nsurgery tomorrow and it's like i i i i\nvery minor like totally not not not\ncomplex or deeper in any way but the\nreason i'm bringing it up is even\nsomething so minor when i told my\nfriends about it i found out 25 of my\nfriends had all male friends had all had\nthat surgery\nand i was like it's a hernia and and i\nwas like why didn't you ever tell me\nlike right and that's a really basic\nexample but it's the same thought\nprocess of like how\nwhen i when i first heard i had a hernia\ni was like i'm too young to have die why\ndo i have one and then when i start\ntalking to my friends so many of my\nfriends under 30 had one and i was like\noh why didn't i know about this right so\nit's something as simple as that so i\nthink the honesty it connected\nuh and fifth and final question what's a\nword or phrase that you're trying to\nembody\nagain extremely cliche because it's\na title on my album\num but i also have it tattooed on my\nbody is stan stale\num it's a phrase my dad said since i was\nreally young and i felt like i forgot to\nuse it for quite a long time\nbut when\nyou don't know what to do just stand\nstill\nit's okay to take your time and take a\nmoment and\nre-evaluate everything\nthat\nhas saved me so many times in my life\nand a lot recently\num and so to practice for me it's really\nhard for me to stay still and stand\nstill and be still and so to practice\nthat more i really live by those words\nand i really look up to my dad and\nadmire him and his strengths so much so\nthat's such a powerful powerful answer i\nlove that advice\nuh everyone who's been listening and\nwatching i want you to go stream the\nhardest part right now it's available as\nwe're speaking uh go and listen to it go\nand share it go and feel with it go and\nexperience the honesty that noah's\nputting out there i hope it's extremely\nhealing and connecting for you and\nalso please feel free
