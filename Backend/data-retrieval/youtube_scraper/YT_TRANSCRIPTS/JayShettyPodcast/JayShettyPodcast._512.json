    "transcript": "if your happiness\ndepends on the actions of others\nyou know you're at mercy of things that\nyou can't control the best-selling\nauthor and host the number one health\nand wellness podcast on purpose with jay\nshetty\nyeah i'm not even just saying this i\nliterally\nthink i manifested this like it's the\nafter i saw you at simi and hayes house\nso that was a couple months ago and then\na few weeks ago\nmy i was talking to my social media girl\nrandomly we were just talking about a\nbunch of stuff um and just kind of what\ni would love to represent just talking\nabout a new chapter for me and whatever\nand i was she was like\nwho would you really want to like talk\nto or whatever and i was like it'd be so\ncool to talk to jay and she was like\nthat would be really cool and then we\nkind of just that was kind of the\nthought and whatever and then you hit me\nand i was like no freaking way he's\nhitting me right now so i was like\nabsolutely this is like perfect it's the\nuniverse just putting it in perfect\ntiming because that makes me so happy\nbecause it was exactly the opposite way\nso i've for a long time had people that\ni'd love to sit down with and every time\ni saw you do something with mental\nhealth and vogue or any of the segments\nthat you ever did i was just like she's\namazing like you know it's incredible\nthe way you were talking about it when\nyou'd post about it i'd be like oh this\nis incredible like to see see you\nspeaking so openly about it vulnerably\nabout it and so i've always wanted to do\nthis yeah and then but we've never\nreally crossed paths so i'm always just\na bit like and i don't like asking\nfriends of friends when i haven't met\nsomeone and right so i i was like that\nday i had to like pluck up the card\ni'm just gonna ask for myself no because\nit's easier when i asked and i know\nchristy so yeah yeah yeah but i was like\ni it's nice to win this i told my team\ntoo i was like it's so much nicer when\nthere's like a personal connection for\nsure and someone really feels\ncomfortable rather than it's like a\npiano no it was it was so perfect like\nwhen i think back to it i'm like that\nwas me just trusting the universe and\nnot pushing for anything and i knew it\nwas gonna kind of happen when it was\nsupposed to and it literally didn't it\ndid yeah you felt it too yeah i did that\nmeans a lot to me yeah and i hope that\nthis is the start of spending more time\ntogether me too yeah off camera too\ni would love that because like i think\nalso i don't know like i admire people\nlike you i admire like\nyou know the the michael pollins and\nmichael singers and wim hofs of the\nworld and i feel like you fit in that\ncategory for me of just people that are\nbecause you know i know a little bit\nabout your story i'd like to actually\nknow more which would be really cool to\nactually i know we're obviously not here\nnext to for that exactly but for me just\npersonally like i'd love to know more of\nyour story i know that um you've had\nquite the experiences and i think that's\nso cool i'm like so intrigued by people\nwith just that amount of curiosity and\nlike determination determination and\npatience like that takes so much\npatience to be like you or like any of\nthose people that i just listed it's so\ncool to me and i just i wish i wish for\nmyself but i'm working on it no you're\nthat curious too yeah\ni am it's just you know that that level\nof like i said patience and\ndetermination is like\nit's a gift like that is like a really\nreally amazing gift and\nlike i said like i'm just working on it\nall the time and i that's my goal in\nlife i guess well i i think i feel the\nsame way about you again that and by the\nway i love all these people you just\nmentioned too so yeah so feel very\nhonoured to be put into that group of\npeople and we've had women on the\npodcast before too so he's been a guest\nbut with you\ni feel the same way back when it's like\nwhen you see someone who is so curious\nwho\ncould get away with not worrying about\nthese things if you don't want to but\nthen still being courageous enough to\ntalk about these things and then using\nyour platform as a space to open up\nthese dialogues like that is\nas if not more important as well as as\ndoing the work and doing the path yeah i\nmean i can see you doing the work it's\nfun watching you do the work and\nfiguring it out i love working on myself\nlike it is actually like a passion of\nmine and like i just\ni find so much comfort and joy and like\nactually\nfinding where i think i could better\nmyself and being like even if it's\nphysical like physical as in like my\nphysical health or working out or i just\nstarted doing speaking of wim hof i just\nstarted doing like cold plunges and ice\nbaths and like even if i don't have the\ntime to go outside i just got a cold\nplunger i did it right before i got here\nit's the best thing ever\nagain it takes so much mental\nthe whole thing of it is all mental so\ni don't know just stuff like that i\nreally love so i'm always\ni'm always trying to just be the best\nversion of me and so i just love that it\nlike actually makes me feel really good\ni love self-care and i just love stuff\nlike that so it's been really cool but\nit's cool for you\nto say\nthat you enjoy seeing that from me\nbecause there's always been\nkind of this weird part of it for me\nwhere i'm like is this a pity party\nbecause i don't want it to be like i\nwant this to feel very\npositive i want to connect with people\nand i guess that's that is my goal there\nis to be like there actually is this\nside of me that you might may not know\nof\nbut\nthe goal here is to connect and also not\nfeel like i'm throwing some pity party\nfor myself because i want this to be a\nlearning experience for everyone i want\nthis to be really positive and really\nreally well received i want you to look\nat it and actually have a positive\nfeeling towards it so i don't know\nyou'll find like if i you know when i do\nkind of post about something or when i\nwant to talk about something i'm usually\nsharing a tip or like sharing kind of\nlike a little technique even if it's\nsomething so simple as like walking\noutside taking a few deep breaths and\njournaling like yeah it's just that kind\nof stuff that i really like um to share\nbecause i feel like i want to be helpful\nyeah more than anything absolutely and\nthat's how that's at least how i see it\nyeah i see it not completely not as a\npity party at all but so much more is\njust hey here's a reminder yeah that's\nsomething that i did yeah i feel like\nthat positivity shines through too in\nthe way you do it so at least if that\nhelps whatever that's worth from the\noutside it definitely comes across that\nway cool and this is easily been the\nwarmest introduction to a flower\nconversation i've ever experienced in my\nentire life i'm doing gonna say i was\nactually i was actually really nervous\ncoming in here because this means so\nmuch to me like and i'm serious because\nyou know i've done a lot of interviews\nin my life and\nwhen when thinking about this one or\nthinking about that i even wanted to do\nsomething like this it just it means a\nlot to me and so it made me a little\nnervous and i was like i just want to\nget this right this isn't like you know\nme going out and promoting something or\ntalking about something this is you know\nsomething very real that um we all\nexperience which is just you know\nourselves and our well-being and just\neverything so yeah and this is this is a\nyou know for me genuinely and i really\ndo mean this like the podcast has been a\ngreat excuse or really from my side an\nintention to get to know people and i\nreally admire yeah and so for me it's\nbeen a great way of building new\nfriendships and relationships because if\nyou can sit and talk to someone and\nreally get along with each other you're\nlike oh we should do this more often and\nso well i'm honored yeah so for me it's\ndefinitely been that and\nto me you know\nyou saying that and you know taking it\nas intentionally as you are it's you\nknow for me it's as important i i always\nshare this before we start recording\nusually but we just flowed\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now it's very rare\nthat i get to sit down with someone that\ni have admired for a very long time from\nafar someone that i believe has inspired\nme through the sharing of their story\nsomeone who speaks so vulnerably and\nopenly about the things that i most care\nabout mental health purpose uh the\njourney of life and discovery and\ncuriosity and\nwhat i want to share about this person\nis when i bumped into them at a mutual\nfriend's birthday party and i just want\nto give a big big shout out to simeon\nhayes because it wouldn't happen without\nthem i love you simeones you've been\namazing guests on the podcast before as\nwell\ni wouldn't have bumped into this\nindividual and had this opportunity to\nreach out to them and as soon as i\nreached out this has been the most\nflowing conversation and connection that\ni possibly had on the podcast to be\nhonest so i just want to put that out\ni'm speaking about the one and only\nsomeone who needs no introduction but\nsuccessful business founder\ninternational supermodel uh founder of\nthe incredibly successful tequila brand\n818 and star on the hulu's the\nkardashians which premieres in second\nseason on september 22nd the one and\nonly kendall jenner kendall thank you so\nmuch for doing this thanks for having me\nthat was a wonderful introduction oh\nwell it's it's honestly such an honor\ngetting to know someone who\nit's very rare that i find someone who\nfunctions in with very similar values in\nin a personal connection sense so when i\nreached out to you\ni i really meant everything i said and i\ncould have written you an essay but i\nwas like let's spare the details\nand then to get your response and then\nfor us to be here within a couple of\nweeks of connecting yeah and even your\nmessage this morning i just want people\nto know i was like\nthe the text you sent me this morning i\nwas like\nthis never like i was like this is\namazing and i was like but and i was\nliterally going to do the same thing and\nso to me i was like this is very rare\nand so i love the synergy and the flow\nthat we're experiencing and me too i'm\nexcited to get into it now it's funny\nbecause i called i called hayes before\num the other day and i was just like oh\nmy god i'm going on your friend's show\nand whatever and she was like he's the\nbest it's good you're just gonna flow\nright into it he's so easy to talk to\nand that's literally what happened and\nlike i told you i just feel like i\nmanifested this moment for for both of\nus and for this just this whole\nexperience and so i am really happy to\nbe here and i'm honestly honored like i\nsaid i admire you and i there's so many\npeople like you that i admire so i think\nsitting down here with you is just so\ncool for me and i get to talk about fun\nthings with you\namazing first of many and i wanted to\nstart with because i always like to\nstart with just things that i've seen\nmore recently a couple of days ago i\nthink you posted a beautiful picture of\nyou hugging your horse\nand you were like you know like snuggle\ntime or something like that and i was\njust like when when did horses become a\npart of your life and\nhow did you get so close to them i think\ni've spent many lifetimes with horses i\nthink this is very one of many lifetimes\nthat i've had i grew up in a horse\ncommunity so where we grew up horses\neverywhere more trails than there were\nhomes really and so i was always around\nhorses and i just was deeply in love\nwith them and i have no explanation and\nthat's why i say i feel like in past\nlives i have just been around horses\nyeah so since i was a really young kid\nloved them and\ncontinued to love them my whole life\nthey're just the best they're the most\nmajestic and gorgeous and\nspiritual they feel everything i just\nlike it's such an honor to be in their\npresence and to be able to do what i can\ndo with my horse i find\nso magical that i can stand in her stall\nwith her and just like vibe out with her\ni like sometimes come to like a little\nget a little teary-eyed when i'm\nstanding in my stall with her because\ni'm like this is so cool that you allow\nme to do this and we have this\nconnection without any words it's just\nthe best thing ever so i love them yeah\nthat's so special i i have a different\nteary eyed story with horses but tell\nyou i'll tell you the short version so\nwhen i proposed to my wife who i can't\nwait to introduce you to when i proposed\nto her which was eight years ago or\nsomething like that when i proposed to\nher i organized a very what i would\nconsider like a very a very hollywood\nproposal it was it was too over the top\nand i would do it totally different\ntoday with all everything i've learned\nhappens yeah it happens it happens and\nso we were walking by the thames in\nlondon which is where we're both born\nand raised and this acapella group jumps\nout and they're singing bruno mars and\nthen like they give her a bouquet of\nflowers and then i get on one knee i\npropose we have dinner by the river and\nthen we walk around the corner and\nthere's a horse room and carriage to\ntake us around\nto take us around london and so we're on\nthis carriage we have this beautiful you\nknow path through london and then we get\ninto the train to get back home to her\nparents to tell them and they already\nknew\nshe's got hives all over her face no way\nshe was allergic she's allergic to\nhorses\ni was like all right so then she was\nlike she had tears and when we got back\nher parents were like what did you do to\nher at least you got to enjoy the moment\nbut but no i don't i don't know\nno i love horses the same way you do\nlike i used to go to india a lot when i\nwas a kid and that's where i first\nlearned to be with horses\nand i mean they're so therapeutic\nabsolutely yeah there's a reason there's\nequine therapy it's the best exactly\nyeah they make me\nthey make me when i'm with\nher i have a few but i'm most mostly\nwith one of my horses right now because\nher name's delandra i didn't name her\nshe came with her name but i call her\ndylan or dill um i love her so much but\nwhen i'm with her i i genuinely i speak\nof like i sp i spoke about how i've just\nloved horses my whole life i i feel like\na kid around her like i feel like my 12\nyear old self that would get up every\nmorning throughout the entire summer at\n8 a.m to go just be at my trainer's\nfacility and i would stay there from 8am\nto 8pm i'd ride all her horses i'd groom\nall her horses i would just sit in the\nstalls with all the horses like it just\nanytime i'm with her i just have that\nsense of like being a child again and\nit's a really really good feeling\nanimals have that special ability don't\nthey like so whichever animal you're\nattracted to and yeah i i never thought\ni would but when i lived as a monk the\nanimal that's revered in india is cows\nand you would never think of cows\nbeing like majestic or you know in that\nway especially when you're not in india\nbut the cows in india have these like\nlotus like eyes like their eyes are just\nlike absolutely stunning yeah and\nthey're so special and they're such\ngentle animals\nand recently radhi and i went uh\ntrekking with gorillas in rwanda\nand gorillas are the we have to go that\nsounds unreal it was unbelievable and\nthey're the animal that's revered in\nrwanda so whenever they have a new\ngorilla that's born they have a naming\nceremony with the\ncommunity love that it's so beautiful\nbut and then i heard somewhere that you\nyour first job was you were a dog walker\nyeah and so i was thinking like do you\nhave any lessons or anything you learned\nby being a dog walker i think first jobs\nare so interesting yeah no i mean\ni was always a super disciplined child\nlike meaning to my like i just loved i\nwould put myself to bed at 7 00 p.m be\nlike my mom would be like playing with\nme and my little sister and be like mom\nit's seven i gotta go to sleep like it's\ntime for my bedtime she'd be like are\nyou okay\nand so i was always that kid and so i i\nthink i just was always really eager to\nlike work i don't know why i just like\nwanted to always have something to do\nsomething that i felt passionate about\nthat i really enjoyed and so yeah when i\nwas young i put some flyers around our\ncommunity and said i would walk dogs and\ni ended up getting people that would get\nlet me have their dog for a few hours\nand take it for a walk so i loved\nanimals and i liked having something to\ndo so i spent i was a kid that liked to\nbe by myself\nwith animals so like i think that that\nwas a cool\nvery fitting thing for me because i got\nto be by myself walking but then also\nexperience all these little dogs with\nyeah yeah i wish i did i used to deliver\nnewspapers so that was my first job and\nit's not as glamorous in london because\nit's raining was that what you were\ndesiring or was it no i was just 14\nyears old and i wanted to make some\nmoney just like i need it i was like i\nneed to make some money yeah and so i\nwas like i'm gonna start doing this and\nyou don't get to you know you'd see it\nin the movies\nwhere the paper boy just like chucks the\npaper at the door but i'd like to\nactually go and put it inside so my only\ninteraction with dogs is they were on\nthe inside grabbing the paper right and\nso yeah\nyeah and stuff but i always love knowing\nabout people's first jobs and how things\nstart for them because of you know\nobviously where you are today but\nwhat do you think it was in those early\nyears where\nyou just said you were very disciplined\nlike it sounds like you were you were\naware of certain habits that you built\nthen\nwhat were some of the things that you\nfeel confident about or\nhow how did you look for validation in\nthose early years and where did it come\nfrom for you i mean it's interesting so\nkylie my little sister she was always\nthe social butterfly i was always\ni just liked being to myself\ni don't know if that's the scorpio in me\nso it just came naturally or whatever i\nhad i had a group of friends who i loved\nbut i just i i like can vividly remember\njust on the weekends not running to go\nbe with my friends all the time during\nthe summer i was with them but on the\nweekends in between school i would i was\nreally just\nby myself i would love to like hang out\nin my room i like was kind of a nerd i\nloved video games and like sitting on\nthe computer and playing sims all day\nlike i just kind of liked being to\nmyself and then all day long during the\nsummer was with my horses and\nyeah i don't know i just it just brought\nme joy i don't think i have like\na you know a super long explanation for\nthat it was so simple for me as a kid\nlike it was just as simple as that made\nme happy and that's just what i wanted\nand it explains i guess a lot of me now\num i went through like a phase where i\nfelt like i had to be around people i\nthink i live a very social life and my\njob is very social\nso i was you know kind of conditioned to\nwant to be around people a lot and then\nas you know the pandemic came around\nyou're not around as many people anymore\nand now i'm just re-enjoying being by\nmyself which is really cool yeah and um\ni had the most i had the best day on\nsunday all by myself i got up i went and\nrode my horses\ni like um took my niece to ride her pony\njust me and her was so nice brought her\nback home went to my house got in my\ncold plunge went in my pool laid out\njournaled like i was having the best day\nand i was just pretty much all by myself\nso i i enjoy it so much i love that i'm\nsure that's so refreshing for people to\nhear too because i feel like people may\nfrom the outside perceive a life which\nobviously like you said for work it's\nbusy and it's social and of course you\nhave wonderful friends but to know that\nyou can feel comfortable in your own\ncompany and that's been a habit that\nyou've developed i crave simple things\nlike i i love my life and i love my job\nand i i\nfeel so fortunate that i have been\nplaced here that for some reason i was\ngiven this life like i feel\nimmensely grateful for that and i have\nhad so much fun and i like think back on\njust the experience that i've had the\nexperiences that i've had this far and\nit's like it's like it's shocking to me\ni'm like this is so freaking cool that i\nlive this life but at the end of the day\nlike when i am home and when i'm alone\nlike i crave the simple things i love a\nsimple day i love just like a simple\nroutine and\nbeing to myself and being around the\npeople that i love my small core crew so\nyeah that's beautiful yeah i mean that's\ni think that's what we're all striving\nfor is right that passion in our case\nand our work and then the simplicity at\nhome what would you say i was thinking\nabout this and i've watched so many of\nyour interviews and read so much too but\nwhat would you say for you as being one\nof your like proudest moments or\ngreatest achievements or something that\nyou really feel like and internally i\nmean like for the basis of our\nconversation like something that really\nbrings you joy internally when you think\nabout it or when when you had it like i\nsaid i look back and the things that\ni've accomplished\njust even my job like i think i really\nat one point\nwhen i was younger decided i want to be\na model and this is what i want to do\nand the fact that i executed because we\ntalk about that determination like i\nreally was i was 14 years old when i\nkind of made that decision and was like\nthis is what i want to do and i went to\nmy mom and i was like please help me do\nthis\nand\ni didn't stop until i was 24\nthat i was like okay i think i need to\nlike take it back a notch which we can\nalso get into because that's a very yeah\nkind of dramatic story but like i\ni just knew and i think i'm proud of\nmyself for being that kid and being\ndetermined to do that and then executing\nand doing it to the to the level that i\nhad done it and that i i guess i still\ndo\nbut i i also am proud of\ni think more so the self self-work that\ni've done within that process because\nthere was a long period of time i'd say\nthe core five years of it that i was\nextremely overworked\nnot my happiest not because i wasn't\ndoing what i loved but just because i\nwas overwhelmed and i was i felt like i\nwas saying yes to everything because i\nfelt really really grateful and really\nhonored to be in the position that i was\nin so i was always saying yes\nand it just took a lot out of me to the\npoint where\ni just wasn't happy anymore\nand so i had to set those boundaries for\nmyself when i was about 23 24 i'd say\nlike what a year before the pandemic so\nyeah i was probably 23.\ni really set boundaries for myself and i\nwas like i want to continue to do this\nbecause this is what i love\nbut i need to start\nsaying no when i can and prioritizing\nme and prioritizing like\nyou know my happiness and my well-being\nyeah and it has done wonders for me like\ni\nfeel like i can show up better for\nmyself\nand i can show up a better person for\nthe people that get to be around me that\nday and you know that i work with on\nthat day so\nyeah\nyeah so that's what i'm proud of sorry\nto give you a long answer\ni won't say i was hoping for that\nbecause i i'm always open to wherever\nanyone's life experience goes but\nthere's a part of me that loves hearing\nthat like i really appreciate hearing\nthat because when you've achieved so\nmany incredible things in your career\nwhich you have to then say well this is\nthe part like knowing how to navigate it\nor making the right choices at the right\ntime healthy balance the healthy balance\nis so important it's important for all\nof us yeah like we have to this is what\nwe're prioritizing you know yeah so how\ndid you find the courage to do that at\nthe 23 mark as you're saying you're in a\ncompetitive industry as you said it was\noverworking it's fast-paced i'm guessing\nthere's comparison in that industry\nthere's competition in that industry\nit's not an easy space to be you're of\ncourse you know you're in the top 0.01\nin your industry so it's hard\nand the reason i ask this is because i\nwork with so many people in this space\nand to have the courage to say no i know\nthat if i sort this out then all of this\nis going to be just fine that actually\ntakes more courage than we recognize we\nrealize that when you have nothing then\nthere's nothing to lose you can actually\nhave a lot of courage right but when you\nhave everything and there's everything\nto lose and a lot of the time at least\nwhat i've heard in in town is\nyou know older managers and agents and\ni'm not saying you have any of this but\npeople that i know will be told well hey\nif you don't do this like you'll be\nforgotten next year or you know your\ncareer is only going to last another six\nmonths how did you have that courage to\nsay no no i need to do this like where\ndid that come from and i think that it's\nintere like i've never thought about it\nthat way to be completely honest with\nyou i just knew\nthat if i had gone any further that i\nwas going to lose myself i was at that\nvery i was on the teeter-totter edge of\nthat point where\nhad i gone any further\ni was probably not going to be\ngreat\nit was so important to me\nto feel good that i just knew that it\nwas something that i had to do and i\ncan't say like\nyou're absolutely right like\nthere were so many people around me that\nhad\ntold me not to say no and told or told\nme yeah told me not to say no told me\nnot to stop\ni fought my way out of it a little bit\nbecause there were people that had\nworked for me that you know didn't\nwant me to stop because it might have\nbenefited them of course um but\ni got to that point and i just knew i\nhad to do it and i just i don't know i\ndon't know how to explain it i guess\nit was just such an unbelievable\nsensation that i had where i knew that\nif i do this i'm going to be better for\neveryone and i'm going to be better for\nmyself which means i'm going to be\nbetter for the people around me and i\nhave to do this and so it wasn't really\ni want to be able to live\nwith happiness god forbid any of this\never went away and i think that that was\na big moment for me of being like i'm\ngonna be okay\nif i don't get this job tomorrow and i'm\ngonna be okay if i don't get that job in\na month if i have to take this time to\ndo whatever things will come\neverything's going to work out the way\nit's supposed to and i had to trust that\nyeah well to me on from the outside and\nit's it's beautiful that you didn't see\nit in yourself because that almost makes\nit even more wonderful but the idea that\nto me from the outset that's a lot of\ncourage yeah it takes a lot of courage\nit takes a lot of vulnerability and\nopenness and and it takes courage at\nevery level whether\nsomeone's thinking about quitting their\njob to do something they love or whether\nsomeone's trying to relocate their\nfamily and doesn't know how or whether\nsomeone like you is feeling success but\nthen going well wait wait a minute and i\nthink in the past few years we've seen\nathletes and musicians and actors and\npeople in all creative industries step\nback and say well i need to put me first\nyeah and i think that that's empowering\nbecause i think we hear about burnout in\nworking culture and corporate culture so\noften for sure so\nwhat what was it that you started to do\nwith that newfound time at that time\nlike where was is that where the curio\nwas the curiosity always there and now\nyou could actually follow it it was it\nwas it was always there and i had had a\nlot of people coming to me telling me\nabout\nmeditation and how it changed their life\nand therapy and so many different things\nand i was a bit overwhelmed because i\nwas like oh my god what if this is gonna\nsuit me i think it's a very personal\nexperience i think everybody has a very\ndifferent version of all of that stuff\nand so it was a little overwhelming so i\nthink i really just took the time to be\noff for a second it was even the little\nthings it was like being able to go to\nmy friend's birthday party which i\nwouldn't have been able to go to before\nbecause i was working a lot i love\nhearing that because i think it is those\nsimple things like\nyou know giving yourself that space yeah\nwhatever it is that you needed to do\nyeah when you needed it and and like you\nsaid sometimes it's like that's when all\nthe subscribe buttons come up in front\nof you and it's like try this and try\nthis and it's like well no no let me\njust take my time\nit was also now that i think about it\nyeah 23 i'm 26 i've had my horse for so\naround that time\nis when i bought the horse that i have\nnow\nwho\nis my like i i jump her and i like how i\nhave two other horses but they're like\nretired so i don't really ride them the\nsame way i ride her so yeah i guess it\nwas around that time too that i was like\ni'm going to do this because i love this\nand like i want to get back into it and\nthis is what i've loved my whole life so\nso it was around that time that i feel\nlike all of that started happening and i\nbought my horse and i like started\ntaking more time for things that made me\nreally happy yeah what i what i'm\nnoticing in you and observing or at\nleast from\ni was just saying it's like it feels\nlike no matter what's happening in your\norbit\nthere's this pillar of belief that\nit's important to be happy yeah like you\nknow that's like this core center belief\nin your life where it's like it's\nimportant to be happy it's important to\nbe happy it's\nthat has to be the goal for sure and\nyou know it's not always\neasy\nwe live in such an interesting industry\nand in such an interesting time with\nsocial media that it can be very hard\nsometimes\nyou can fall victim to so many things\nthat\ndon't serve you and that don't make you\nhappy\nif your happiness\ndepends on the actions of others\nyou know you're at mercy of things that\nyou can't control\nand that's never\nwhere i want to be so i i always want to\nlive in like\nme and my therapist talk about like my\nhigher goddess my higher self like i\nalways want to live there\nknowing that\nyou know when i'm there you can't take\nthat away from me that that's mine and\nno matter what you can disagree with me\nyou can agree with me that's not going\nmy i'm not changing i'm not shifting i'm\nhere i'm in my higher goddess so\ni kind of\ni always live by like\nholding my happiness and not letting\nanyone else affect it and though i fall\nvictim to it at times of course we as we\nall probably do absolutely i um i strive\nevery day to live in that place so what\nare what are some of the qualities of\nyour higher goddess so that that kind of\nuh avatar like she's awesome\nlike i said i don't love a pity party i\nalso like you know sometimes it feels\nweird to like say good things about\nyourself but i've also learned a lot\nabout talking to myself and a lot about\nlooking in the mirror and being like\nyou're great you're gorgeous you're\namazing you're loyal you're positive\nyou're so many like i love words of\naffirmation i love\njust sitting there and reassuring myself\nof who i am because\nthat's another thing for me you know\nthere's\nso many false narratives about me about\nall of us i'm sure like\nso many people think they have you\nfigured out when they don't even know\nthe half of it\nso sitting there and being like you know\nyou get frustrated sometimes it could\nfeel really unfair you could be reading\nsomething that someone is saying about\nyou or hearing something that someone's\nsaying about you and being like that is\nso unfair because that's not who i am\nand that really\ngets to me sometimes and that really\nsucks but then looking at myself in the\nmirror and being like but i know who i\nam and that's all why does anything else\nmatter\nand my friends know who i am and my\nfamily knows who i am my dog knows who i\nam my horse knows who i am like why does\nany of everything else is just noise i i\ndo this exercise i don't think i've\nshared this before but i do this\nexercise with some of my clients where\nwe'll go on a walk and we'll be on a\nhike wherever we are\nand i'll ask them what they think a\npiece of you know maybe there's a little\nleaf or maybe there's some a flower or\nsomething that looks a little unique on\nthe path\nand i'll say what do you think that\nfeels like and what do you think it\nwould feel like if you picked it up in\nyour hand\nand they'll be like oh it looks really\nrough and like it might scratch me and\nlike it looks like a bit you know like\nuneven or whatever and it looks kind of\nhard and strong and then i'll ask them\nto pick it up\nand nine times out of ten\nit's completely different like they'll\npick it up and it'll just dissolve in\ntheir hands or they'll turn it over and\nthe color is really soft\nand sorry the shape the shapes really\nsoft and the color is totally different\non the other side and i do that exercise\nto help us realize just how\nmulti-faceted humans are yeah today i've\ngot to meet you and and obviously we're\nspending a lot of deep intimate\nvulnerable time together so you learn\nfaster about someone but if someone only\nfollows someone on social media or only\nsee someone at an event or only sees one\ninterview it's so easy to create such a\nsingular view of someone right and i\nthink and i want to say this because i\nreally think we all feel it i don't\nthink anyone wants to be seen\nin a singular way\nif you had to choose one word\nthat had to be you for the rest of your\nlife i don't think anyone wants that of\ncourse you know that we're\nmessy and complex\nand different of course but we like to\nput someone else in a box whoever that\nmay be\nbecause it's easier then to live life\nand say okay well that's persons a b\nright yeah so\nthere's this beautiful piece of wisdom\nthat i always share from\ncharles horton cooley and he wrote this\nin 1890 i think it was which just shows\nhow true this has been for such a long\ntime and obviously long before that as\nwell\nand he said the challenge today is i'm\nnot what i think i am i'm not what you\nthink i am\ni am what i think you think i am\nand we'll let that blow everyone's mind\nit gives me chills every time i say it\nyeah charles walton cooley said the\nchallenge today is i'm not what i think\ni am i'm not what you think i am\ni am what i think you think i am and\nwhat he's trying to say is that we live\nin a perception of a perception of\nourselves so if i think\nyou think i'm smart then i allow myself\nto feel smart right it's like we need\nthat value we need that validation or if\ni think you think i'm not smart then i\nfeel hurt yeah and and the challenge is\ni don't know what you're thinking at all\nespecially outside in the world and so i\nfind that what you're saying around like\nwhat do i think about myself like how do\ni feel about myself how do the people\nthat actually know me feel about me i\nthink that's really empowering i wanted\nto ask you because i feel like from from\nwhat i've seen and from what i've heard\nyou have you have great friendships you\nhave a great relationship with your\nfamilies you said like\nwhat do you think have been really great\nhabits or\ntraits in relationships that have helped\nyou build up good friendships and and\nfamily relations because i think for so\nmany people sometimes their friendships\nand their family can often be the most\ndifficult part but i feel like the way\nyou communicate the way you're talking\nabout it i'm like okay there's some\nreally good habits in place here yeah\nhave there been any principles or rules\nthat you've learned along the way that\nhave been\nhelpful i mean of course honesty\num i'm a big\nperson on like keeping a really honest\nhealthy communicative relationship\num but i also think like\ni find it really important to have\nnot feel like you're on top of each\nother when you have your family around\nor your friends around it's okay to like\nsometimes even if you're at like a\nfamily dinner running to the bathroom\nand just being like let me just take a\ncouple breaths\nbecause this is getting overwhelming you\nknow what i mean so i just love to like\ntake a second my feelings are valid like\nsometimes my family's a lot which i bet\neveryone already knows\neveryone's families have a sense of\ncrazy to them but but i think that i can\nget really overwhelmed really easily i\nam prone to just you know\na good amount of anxiety and just being\nextremely overwhelmed and kind of taking\neverything too seriously sometimes so i\nlike to just step away sometimes and\njust be like this is okay i'm allowed to\nfeel this way it's valid i'm just going\nto take a deep breath and i'm not going\nto react and then i'm going to go back\nout there and i'm going to be fine\nsometimes i do that\ni love that i love how easy it is\nno one needs to learn a new meditation\npractice\nor a new thing sometimes\nit's as simple as that yeah it's as\nsimple as that i love that i you know\none of the things that you know which\nwhich really touched my heart when i saw\nthis because i think when\nthings happen in culture and and\neveryone talks about it but but\nsometimes you're like okay well i can\ntell that there's a real connection here\nlike when when you lost virgil right\nlike that when i when i saw your message\nand what you spoke about it i was like\nwow this is this is someone who had a\nreally deep connection with this\nindividual and going through grief is\nreally really tough like you know people\nwho lose and i lost uh two really close\npeople to me during the pandemic i'm\nsorry uh one was thank you one was one\nwas my spiritual teacher since i was 12\nyears old and he died of stage four\nbrain cancer and i hadn't seen him\nduring the pandemic i couldn't go back\nfor his because that was still when it\nwas like yeah locked down yeah he\ncouldn't go back for his funeral\nand\nyou know he'd been the person who'd been\nsuch a key piece of my life\nand then the other person pretty much in\nthe same year was my best friend as a\nmonk so he was still a monk wow and he\nhappened to get cancer and he passed\naway in the pandemic i couldn't see him\neither and he was my age and so to lose\nsomeone that was you know he was still\nthere and so\nyeah and so and so when i saw your\nyou know your\nwonderful tribute to virgil as well i\nwas like you know how how do you process\nsomething like that when you know it's\nnot only industry friends but genuine\nfriendship beyond that and just how yeah\nwell my first thought here is why is it\nalways the best people like why is it\nalways these people that are just such\nballs of light in everyone's life it's\nlike so you just think about it and\nyou're like this is so unfair and you're\ngoing through every emotion\nand\nto be honest it was really shocking\nbecause not everyone knew what he was um\ngoing through and suffering from so it\nwas really shocking um i'll never forget\nthe day i found out and\nit just\nabsolutely obviously breaks your heart\nand\nyou can't help but be like oh my god did\ni did i ever say enough did i ever tell\nhim enough\nit's really interesting to share that\nfeeling with so many people yeah it\nfeels good in a way and you're just like\neveryone it makes you feel so human and\nyou're sharing this emotion with people\nthat knew him people that didn't know\nhim people that just loved him from afar\nand it's just\na really\nbeautiful and incredible thing to a\ncertain degree but then also just\nobviously the most\ndevastating thing it hits so hard when\nso many people are talking about it and\nso many people are affected by it so\nit was definitely um\na really shocking\nreally sad time yeah it was yeah yeah\nand those and and it's really\ninteresting what you said there it's\nlike why and and i had that with my\nspiritual teacher for sure i was just\nlike\nlike he was you know and and what's\nreally powerful about what i could at\nleast remember from him at that time was\nthat even though he had staged for brain\ncancer which means he'd lost his\nshort-term memory and a lot of his\nlong-term memory is impaired if you ever\nmet him\nhe would just thank you for your service\nto god like he would just say thank you\nfor everything you're doing for other\npeople and he would just be grateful\nand i was just like that's exactly how v\nwas too he was the most\npositive\nlived life\nlike\nappreciative wanted to say yes to\neverything wanted to just be there for\neveryone\nyou could literally ask him to design a\npencil for you and he would be like\nit'll be done tomorrow what do you what\nelse do you need like he just had so\nmuch to give and he gave it\nand that wasn't that was pre his\ndiagnosis that was like that was just\nwho virgil was\nand so to then find out what he found\nout at a certain point in his life and\nstill be that person and still like i'm\ngonna show up for everyone and like\nmy time here is so special to all these\nother people and i'm going to like be\nhere\nto make them feel amazing it's just like\nunreal like it makes you just be like\nwhat yeah like how you're saying how\ncould you be that incredible and giving\nlike that is so crazy there wasn't a\nselfish bone in that man's body like he\nwas just the best yeah but i'm sorry to\nhear about your oh no no i i think it's\nit's actually\nnice speaking about people that we both\nlove in in\na in a similar way even though they're\nin such different places in life doing\nvery different things yeah but to talk\nabout someone's and i think that's a big\npart of it for me at least with grief\nthat i feel like when i talk about the\nbeautiful qualities of the people that i\nlost\nit gives me so much\nconfidence that\nthey want me to live it and they want me\nto try and embody it and that how\nfortunate we are to have experienced\nthat type of humanity yeah like you know\nand those are my thoughts of him like\ni think all we ever really want as human\nbeings is to be you know when we do\nleave this earth we want to be\nremembered so beautifully and positively\npositively i know at least i do of\ncourse but like you just want you of\ncourse want to make people feel\nsomething and he made so many people\nfeel something and for that it is so\nspecial like they say that we you know\nwe have our purpose here and i know that\nhe fulfilled a purpose here that he was\nsupposed to fulfill and i think that\nthat's i think about it beautifully like\ni obviously it's a very very sad\nsituation and it and it breaks my heart\nbut\ni have nothing but beautiful thoughts of\nhim and i think that's really cool and\nreally special so yeah you thank you for\nsharing that too and i i had to ask you\nbecause\nyeah i just i feel i love hearing\namazing things about amazing people that\nyou know because i think so many of the\nmost incredible people i grew up reading\nabout people that i never met and i\nspent a lot of my life studying books\nabout people that i never met so malcolm\nx and martin luther king and einstein\nand people that i really see as people\nthat have directed so much of my life\nfrom how they lived\nand i feel like he was potentially one\nof those people that i never met him\nbecause whenever i hear about him i'm\njust like for sure oh this is someone\nthat we could learn from you you spoke\nabout purpose there i was wondering how\nhas your purpose changed you had this\nvery\nconfident view of i want to be a model\nyou know\nyou've superseded exceeded and continue\nto flourish in that world and i always\nwish that you do\nhow has your purpose evolved as that\ntime's gone on\ni think i've learned a lot i've learned\na lot about myself about what i want\nfrom my life and which is kind of what\nwe've been talking about but um\ni'm actually really excited\nto get older and to learn so much more\nabout not only myself but like\nthe journey and the path that i i guess\nwant to take and want to be on so\ni'd say you know my purpose has evolved\nfrom obviously\nwithin business doing what i want to do\nand\nmaking sure i'm happy and finding the\nthing that i love and all those things\nbut i've kind of like i said really\ntuned in to me and i think my purpose at\nleast at this very moment and what i've\nkind of evolved into is\nis my higher goddess like i am\ndetermined to tune into her at all times\nbut also\nas i get older i have so much that i\nwant to connect\nwith other people and with\nyou know aka social media and people\nthat may not know me personally um and\njust you know the following like i said\ni i was given this life for some reason\nfor whatever reason i was placed here\nand i do feel a purpose to\nshare and connect and put a smile on\npeople's faces or make someone feel a\npositive feeling and so i think that\nwithin me wanting to achieve\nme tuning into my higher goddess i think\nthat also entails me being a great\nversion of myself\nfor other people to then\nexperience and my tips and my tools and\nwhatever i can share whatever help i can\ngive i i really um you know as corny as\nit sounds i want to spread love like i\nwant people to feel love i that's\nreally i guess the purpose yeah that's\nthat's beautiful i mean more can you ask\nfor yeah right yeah and and it is funny\nthat so much of the stuff that is corny\nor you know whatever that's the stuff\nthat's true right\nthat's the stuff it is like there's also\njust we all just like live in such a\nit's an interesting time obviously and\nit can feel really negative\nand\ni tend to stay off of\nplatforms like social media platforms\nbecause it's hard to look at sometimes\nand it feels really negative so i feel\nlike we all just need a little bit of a\nsmile sometimes i agree i agree i i post\nthese uh\nvideos every day which are just these\nfun\nsilly things that happen in the world\nthat my my team will find i'll find and\ni post them every day literally for that\nreason and that reason only because i'm\nlike i may or may say may or may not say\nsomething that makes someone smile right\nbut this definitely works like this this\nwithout a doubt will bring some joy to\nsomeone's life and if if this is the\nonly joy that someone experienced i want\nthem to see good in the world and\nbelieve that there's good enough that's\none of my favorite things to see on um\ntick tock when i sit in my bed at night\nand fall victim to tick-tock i love to\nsee there's people that i'll post like\num here's like five amazing facts that\nhave happened in the world in the last\ncouple weeks or whatever and it'll be\nlike\nthe you know pandas are not extinct\nanymore and like the great barrier reef\nis coming back and stuff like that and\nso i'm like that's so cool that's what i\nwant to hear exactly and\nyou know if it was like it's going down\nit's like it's going to get a lot of\nlikes and hits but right if it's going\nup it doesn't get the same attention\nyeah why do we like gravitate towards\nthe negative so much like no very\ninteresting we have to retrain i i\ngenuinely believe it's just a pattern\nit's a pattern and a habit that's been\nadded absolutely for so long absolutely\nand we have to retrain ourselves the\nclickbait of it all and the whole thing\nand we're like\nthat's going downhill i need to see\nwhat's happening and we're just like\nwe do need to retrain our brains that's\nexactly what it is yeah and it starts\nwith what you said earlier it starts\nwith how we see ourselves\nit is all from that if someone looks in\nthe mirror as you were saying earlier or\nif someone just reflects on themselves\nnot in them physically but just\ninternally yeah most of us will spot all\nthe negative things about ourself and\nthen we take that out into the world and\nspot all the negative things about\neveryone else and then we take that out\ninto social media right so that just\npropels from\nif it's all a reflection it's all yeah\nif we ask someone to sit down and write\ndown as you said we feel uncomfortable\ntaking a compliment or we feel\nuncomfortable saying saying nice about\nherself exactly and so it all starts\nwith our relationship with ourselves if\nwe were able to find\nthree good things about ourselves today\ni promise you you're gonna find three\ngood things about the person sitting\nright\nand that will right exactly\ni\ndo a lot of like inner inner child work\nwith my um therapist and there's\nactually a trend on tick tock that was\ngoing around but um coincidentally\nenough we ended up naturally speaking\nabout it in my session and it was like\nthis trend on tick tock i guess that was\nlike um\nlike a girl being like anytime you're\nbeing mean to yourself just think this\nis who you're talking about and it\nflashes to like a photo of her as a kid\nand so i me and my therapist were\ntalking about something similar and she\nwas like why don't you find like a photo\nof yourself and put it on your bathroom\nmirror so that every morning every night\nevery day when you walk into your\nbathroom mirror you're looking at her\nand you're remembering that if there's\nanything negative that you're ever\nsaying about yourself if you're ever\nbeing mean to yourself you're talking\nabout her and so i did that and i went\ninto my um i went into like my\nmemorabilia closet in my house and i was\nlooking through old like photo books and\ni've seen these photo books my whole\nlife i've literally seen every photo\nthat's been in here\nand i like flipped to a page and there\nwas a photo i'd never seen of myself\never it was a polaroid so it was the\noriginal photo and it was just me as a\nlittle girl with a bow in my hair and a\ndress on and i have like a little alien\ntattoo or something right here and i'm\nlike have this big cheesy smile on my\nface and i was like that's the photo i'm\nputting on my thing i can show you the\nphoto later i have a picture of it on my\nphone but um so i pasted it on my\nbathroom mirror and i talked to her and\ni'm always like if i'm ever looking in\nthe mirror and being negative towards\nmyself or anything i always look right\nover to her and i'm like she's dope i\nlove her and so it's just another way of\njust self-love i love that that's such a\ngreat tool that's such a great tool my\nteam found a kid picture of me and made\nan embarrassing version of that trend so\ni'll show you that too oh awesome okay\nso you know it yeah exactly i know\nexactly what you're talking\nyou were saying earlier that you know\nyou you wanted to come here and you you\nwanted to share and you manifested and\nyou there were things you wanted to\nshare what is it that's on your heart\nthat\nyou've wanted to share that maybe we\ndidn't go there today already or is\nthere something on your mind and heart\nas an experience or a any anything that\nreally drew you here and made this\nhappen right like\ni want to honor that i think we've\nobviously we've honestly touched a lot\nof what i felt like i would have loved\nto get off my heart i don't know i was\nreally excited honestly to come here\nand\nshare\na little bit of me that i feel is very\nsometimes scary for me to share and like\ni said i came in here and i was a little\nnervous because this is important to me\nand like this part of\nyou know everyone's journey and and what\nwe're talking about today is it's so\nimportant i really that was i guess my\nintention here today was to come in and\nshare a little bit of me and maybe for\nwhoever's watching they find some\ncomfort in this or some joy from this or\nthey understand me a little bit more you\nknow what i mean so i think that we've\nhit a lot of really cool points and\nyeah i mean i feel i feel really good\ngood i wanted to honor that i i asked\nthat because\nyou know i think i think when\nwhen you feel you're in that flow with\nsomeone and yeah i feel like you know\nwe've learned so many new things about\nyou today and there's so many moments\nwhere i'm like i just feel like you're\nso comfortable and and you've been so\nopen with us but i just wanted to honor\nthat thank you and make sure that you\nfeel that you've really felt heard and\nseen i appreciate that thank you so much\nso we all want to just be understood at\nthe end of the day so\ni think the closer you get to\npeople\nhumans the closer you get to people of\ndifferent backgrounds and different\nwalks of life\nthe more you start to recognize how\nsimilar we all are yeah exactly and how\nmany challenges we all share\ndespite how much money someone has in\nthe bank despite how much fame someone\nhas despite how much followers someone\nhas\nand what we find is that everyone feels\ntheir own guilt for where they are and\neveryone feels their own pressure for\nwhere they are and everyone feels their\nown challenge for where they and you\njust start to realize that we all have\nthe same emotions exactly in different\nmixes yeah we're all just having a human\nexperience exactly we're all just going\nday by day\ni think we all need to be a little bit\nkinder to each other and just\ntake it easy on some people so because\nwe are\nwe're all we all have our own struggles\nand um\ni don't know i'm an empath so i like\nfeel for things and i feel for people\nand\num\nyeah yeah and it starts with you the the\nperson right yeah exactly i thought you\nmeant me i was like i don't know i don't\nknow\ni was just like thank you\ni went back to our listeners\ni found that the days i stopped judging\nmyself i stopped judging others because\nit it changed how i\nsaw humanities yeah uh kendall we end\nevery on-purpose episode with a final\nfive which is a fast five round i ask\nyou a question and you answer it\nwith a one word or one sentence
