used to now he sleeps he's great\nbut we used to get up all night long and\nevery time i had to pee daryl would have\nto pee at the same time and i'd be like\nget up it's my turn and i remember in\nthis new house we literally\nlike built rooms from scratch and\nthey had a bidet next to the bathroom\nand i was like we'll never use that but\nthere's an extra hole and then i saw the\ndream and i was like i have an extra\ntoilet\nand i was to the plumber i was like can\nyou pop both of these next to each other\nand he was like what are you talking\nabout\ni was like just right there right next\nto each other and he like laughed and\nthought i was joking i was like get it\ndone and he did and it was the best\ndecision ever like if you're really\nclose with your husband like my like\nwe're we're tight we're close to the\nmost yeah we like pee together and it's\nthe best bonding time ever i love i i\ndon't know we're not nasty would it but\nlike\nit blew up and the whole world is like\new\nand i have couple friends that are\nthey're older than daryl and i are we're\nyoung we got lucky we met each other at\nlike 22\nbut they're like\nyou pee in the same room as your husband\ni'm like oh he'll chill with me if i'm\ngoing number two like we hang out you\nknow like\nwe don't do it at the same time but yeah\ni love we're close well well thank you\nwe wanted to start you're welcome yeah\nso now everything goes deep\nyeah but no i love it thank you and\nthank you for letting us into your home\ni've been loving following you on tik\ntok for that reason it's just it's so\nnice getting to know someone and then\nmeeting someone in person and going oh\nyou you're even more wonderful investing\nis a great feeling\nbut but i i want to go through parts of\nyour journey that that i thought would\nbe interesting to us and you and just\neverything you talk about when it comes\nto mental health and you talk about like\ntoxic relationships and i just love your\nopenness\nand vulnerability in a way that i know\nmy community and audience really needs\nthat insight uh but i want to go all the\nway back to nantucket which is where you\ngrew up\nyeah yeah and like you know that the\nfeedback that i was here was like it's\nthe cutest town or you know it's like\ntell me about what it was like growing\nup there for you\nand you know what you dreamed of at that\ntime the world was so small everything\nwas so small the buildings are small so\nwhen we would go off island which was\nlike travel anywhere else we're like oh\nyou're going off island\num like the buildings were huge and\nthere's like traffic lights we're used\nto stop signs so everywhere else felt\nhuge and i still get scared when i go to\nnew york i'm like well these buildings\nare way too tall\num and like when we park in a parking\ngarage i have full panic because i'm\nlike well we're gonna be late we have to\nfind a parking spot and get a ticket the\nwhole thing but nantucket was great and\ngrowing up there though there's there's\nno mall there's no place for kids to\nhang out so\nyou start drinking and doing drugs at\nlike 14 wow and like hooking up at a\nvery young age and like when i look back\nat stuff that we did i'm like how was i\nnot murdered or kidnapped or like how am\ni not a full-blown drug addict a lot of\nmy friends are\nand even my brother had problems with\nalcohol and drugs but he managed it so\nwell that we were like you don't have a\nproblem you're just fun you know and\nthen recently he was like okay i need to\nbe sober\nso it was it's like if you made it off\nthat rock like you won like you survived\nso it was a crazy place to live it's\nit's so different when i grew up in\nlondon which is obviously this big city\nand you're always around big buildings\nand then i moved to new york and i've\nlived in mumbai and now i live in l.a so\ni've always been moving from big city to\nbig city you got that tough like you can\nhandle it well you can handle the city\nbut there's there's also it takes a lot\nmore effort to feel grounded or to be in\nnature or you know that took a lot of\ntraining\ntook a lot of training for me to adapt\nto that\nand i also find that\nyou know when you're talking about i\nwent to montana recently and and that's\nwhere when i was speaking to a lot of\nthe\npeople that lived in the area and a lot\nof the kids there were saying they'd\nnever left\num and they were saying that they all\nwent to the same salon on a saturday\nevening and they that one of them went\nto nyu for the summer but then she moved\nback and she was like she'd never seen a\nchipotle before she'd moved out of town\nand all that kind of stuff and and it's\nalways interesting to me because we grow\nup in such bubbles where you think\neveryone thinks like you and everyone's\nliving like you when was the first time\nthat that bubble kind of was burst or\nchanged or switched what was the\nexperience where you're like oh wow\nthere's a whole world and people who\nthink differently and um i mean when my\nparents started bringing me to\nsongwriting conventions like songwriting\ncompetitions and i would travel like my\nmy brothers got a gift\nwell it'd be a whole family thing i have\ntwo brothers so for christmas one year\nthey're like we're going to go to\ncalifornia and have megan go to this\nsongwriting thing with ascap and the\nboys would get to go to the zoo you know\nso it'd always be a family thing but\nthey would make sure the boys got to do\nsomething fun too but i i remember like\ntraveling with my family and seeing\nhollywood and i was like\new but like\noh it's a little different than the\nmovies but then i lived in nashville for\na year by myself and that was my college\ni was 19 and i was like a songwriter i\nwould drive to work at noon and i'd\nwrite a song and i'd come home by myself\nand i did that for a year and then wrote\nall about that base and got signed and\nlike had to move to la\nat 19. so a lot of my friends were like\nin college and went home for the summer\nand i was like\ni didn't\ni don't know i feel like i missed a lot\nof learning steps yeah and relationships\nlike i feel like\nthere's a whole friend group out there\nthat i would have had that i don't know\nthem you know because i just went to\nwork\nbut i wouldn't have it any other way\nlike we did it\nthat's yeah that's yeah but there's\nthere's definitely differences that i'm\nfrustrated with like i don't know how to\ndo taxes i don't know how to do many\nthings because at 19\nall of a sudden there was a team that\ndid it for me yeah and so when like\ni don't know there's simple tasks that\ni'm like i can't\ncan't imagine doing that that i feel\nmy i'm working with my therapist on i\nfeel stupid sometimes i feel silly and\nlike\nand she's like you're not stupid like\nlook around and i'm like yeah but\nthere's simple things i can't figure out\ngeography i don't know where anything is\ni don't know where i am well megan i\nwant to i want to share something with\nyou i promise you that most people who\nwent to college don't know how to do\ntheir taxes okay good because i know\nwhat no the problem i'll be honest me\nincluded and i went uh i went to cass\nbusiness school like i don't know how to\ndo my own taxes because\nbecause and the reason i say that is\nbecause you're just never trained in the\nsimple things like it's it's sad but no\none knows how to get a mortgage or how\nto you know no idea their taxes like you\ndon't know these until you have to do it\nyeah and then when you have to do it you\nfigure it out like for me i had to learn\na whole new system when i moved to the\nu.s so just about when i figured so i\nmoved to the u.s when i was\n28. and so i'm 28. yeah oh there we go\nyeah but you moved to jello when you\nwere 19. so yeah yeah yeah\nbit of a different experience but yeah\nno i moved to the u.s six years ago when\ni was 28 and it was like i just figured\nout how to do taxes in london and then i\nmoved and had to figure it all out again\nand so\ni you know i don't think you should be\nso hard on yourself because\nbecause i'd be honest with you and say i\ndon't think most people know how to do\nthe things you just mentioned okay\nyeah i thought everyone knew\nbut when you look at that experience\nwhen you talk about going to songwriting\ncompetitions yeah\nit's really interesting because\ncompetition often turns people off art\nand it can often be a challenge or it's\nlike you're competing at something and\nthen often you lose taste for i remember\ni\nswam a lot when i was in college and\nhigh school and i was a pretty good\nswimmer and my parents really wanted me\nto be a competitive swimmer and i hated\nthe competitive side of swimming i loved\ncompetition in other areas of my life i\njust didn't enjoy it in the water for\nyou what was that experience like of\nbecause that was even younger than 19\nright you go to this competition\nyeah with other kids but it wasn't even\nkids it was adults oh wow like it ranged\nfrom my age 17 to like 55 or they're\nlike i still want to be a songwriter and\nhere's my chance and i would like always\nwrite on my cds before we played it i'd\nbe like i produced it myself like be\neasy on the production and\ni was like\njust young girl i don't know what i'm\ndoing here and they would critique your\nsongs in front of everyone so it wasn't\nlike we were completing it like\namerica's got talent kind of but for\nsome reason but for songwriting and if\nyou won you got signed and my second\nyear i did it and i was like dad i don't\nwant to go back and he's like your\nalbum's way better now let's go back the\nsecond year i got signed\nand everyone's like megan's the one that\ngot picked this year and i was like\ni did it that's amazing do you remember\nany feedback from the first year that\nlike stayed with you\nyeah my lyrics didn't make sense because\nthey didn't um my production was bad and\nbut they saw potential they're like it's\nin there you just gotta be better at\nlike maybe you shouldn't have said that\nhere or this doesn't really rhyme and\ni was like they don't know anything like\ndad they suck um but then i went home\nand i wrote a whole new album and sent\nit in and then it was like night and day\nand you're like wow you took our notes\nand you came back so it was\ngreat and everyone should do it\nand it sucked and it was great but my\nparents would make fun of me because i'd\nbe like i don't want to go and they\nwould drag me and then when i'd be like\nwhen i'd go i'd be like that was the\nbest thing ever i rock and they're like\nsee\nhow do people get that courage though\nbecause i feel that supportive parents\nyou that was it that was it really my\nparents believed me so much and i was\nbad like i wasn't horrific but i was bad\nlike i hear the songs now and i'm like\nwhat were you guys thinking\nand my mom\nlike nowadays she's like she's still\ntrying to get those 15 year old songs\ncut like they're sorry not cut uh a lot\nof people don't know what that's what\nthat means when i say like get a song\ncut i mean another artist sing it so\nshe's still trying to like sell those\nsongs and i'm like mom they're\nembarrassing like there's sometimes\nthose songs will get pitched and they'll\nget cut and she's like i knew it like i\nknew you were good back then\nand i'm like wow you really believed in\nme\nand my parents are those parents that\nare like everyone should go to college\nand for me they were like go to work\nlike go be a songwriter this is what\nyou're good at you're going to do this\nforever\nhow do you think they noticed that like\nwhat was it in you\nbecause obviously and that's wonderful\nto hear that but\nthey obviously saw something yeah and\nthey saw a habit a trait a pattern some\nwork ethic what did they see i think my\nworth ethic at a young age like\ni wasn't getting all a's in school but\ni'd get like b minuses and c's or\nwhatever but i would come home after\nschool every single day and i would use\nthe production that my dad would get me\nat christmas time i'd use my computer\nand i would be in garage band to logic\nand i would write a song after school\nevery day and i'd play it for them by\ndinner time so in like four hours i\nwould write and produce a whole song and\nbe like check this out and it was me\nlike loving what i'm doing it didn't\nfeel like work but it was also me\nshowing my parents like thank you for\nbuying this for me and like i'm gonna\nmake you proud with this someday and my\ndad\nmy dad was like this is a credit card\nwhere i'm buying all your stuff on you\ncan pay back later when you're a\nsuccessful songwriter i'm like i buy you\na house so\nthere you go\nhow does it feel now that you're a mom\nlike\nhow does that feel like how are you\ntaking parts of those gifts that your\nparents gave you to pass them on and\nlike my parents were and are the best\nlike my mom she would be here today but\nlike yeah i was i heard she was going to\ncome i was really hoping to meet i know\nbut we're trying to be nice with covet\nand like keep like we're always like\npick one person yeah yeah but she uh\nshe's my assistant full-blown now like\nuh what is that like it's the best it's\nthe greatest i'm lucky and i have a cool\nmom a lot of people don't like their\nmoms but\nmy mom is my best friend my husband's\nbest friend they are the same person i\nthink i married my mom wow\nand um they like can finish each other's\nsentences it's crazy i love that but\nshe's really so sweet yeah he's amazing\nthey uh she's my full assistant because\nwhen i had like assistance i've only had\ntwo one was my best friend and then the\nsecond one became my best friend\nand it's i was just like it gets\nuncomfortable it's like i don't want to\nask you to go get my cross-race but my\nmom's like i'm getting grossed you want\nme to get something for you i'm like yes\nplease like she's doing it anyways you\nknow my mom was always my assistant\nforever but she's not she's just a\nloving mom yeah but it's the greatest\nand i think having the support of family\nis the only reason why i'm here i mean i\nknow it is yeah that's why i can keep\nthem close and how do you try and do\nthat in your own way now like how are\nyou doing that for your kids apart from\nbuilding them amazing uh water slides my\nkid sees my his uncles every day because\nthey live in my house\nso i'm\nhe's surrounded by family all the time\nand i think that's a part of his speech\ndelay is like like literally they're\nlike is he the only baby here i'm like\nit's all adults and we all give him\nwhatever he wants immediately they're\nlike so let's wait till he asks\nand then you may give him his snack\nso\nyeah it's a matter of too much love but\num i also want to give him three\nsiblings\nyeah immediately yes yeah so you're\nworking on that working on that i think\ndecember i'm gonna try to get knocked up\ni love it\nyeah i feel like for so many people\nfamily is their contention point right\nlike that's where they experience\ntoxicity it's where they experience\ncould be turkey generational\nnegative patterns and trauma\nwhereas you have this beautiful setup\nand you're working on it obviously it's\nnot just like that what do you think\nyour parents or your family has done\nright over time to maintain that when\nyou just said that you're your kids\nsurrounded by uncles and like\nthat's so beautiful when it works yeah\nand then there's so many people who what\nis it that you think your parents did\ndifferently what did well what have you\nobserved i'm intrigued because i think\nthat could be huge for people\ni'm breaking a lot of\nuh\ngenerational trauma and generational\npatterns\nwhich i've learned with my therapist\num shout out we were shout out my\ntherapist um my new song i said my\ntherapist told me to write you a letter\nand she was like you put what\nyeah i wrote about it\num but as i've learned about like why i\nam who i am it makes sense through my\nparents like no one's perfect in my\nfamily we look great but there is some\ndarkness there are some clouds and\nand i've just tried my very best to\nbreak all of that and my mom is so good\nat adjusting and learning and seeing\nlike oh\nwe can change we're not like this\nforever like my mom's side of the family\nthey never talk about what's bothering\nthem we call it her last name was\njakanowski so he called the jakanoski\nsecrets and they never bring up how they\nreally feel and i'm like we're not going\nto jakanowski's secret this we're going\nto talk right about it here's how you\nmake me feel yeah and um that has my\nmother has changed significantly the\nonly category where she's still slacking\nis the self-talk self-love right bad\nbad yeah which is where i got it\nfrom and she knows so she's like i'm\nsorry i'm sorry like she won't take a\npicture like she'll say the camera will\nbreak i'm like that's so aggressive like\nshe's so mean and hard on herself and i\nand she's a part of that generation too\nthat like refuses to get therapy and my\ndad i told them recently i was like you\nwould both benefit very well if you had\ntherapy and they were like\ni know what's wrong with me i don't need\nto talk about it and i'm like oh my god\nyou're so lost like\nso i'm trying to slowly get them into\ntherapy and and i've noticed my brothers\nnow they're close to their 30s they have\nall woken up and seen like\noh we have alcohol abuse in our family i\nshould be sober and that's what my\nbrother has done and he's like\nan amazing human now he was great before\nbut he was\npoisoned you know yeah and then even my\nyounger brother like\nhe's just there they've grown up so much\nand i think it's by watching me change\nmy ways and change the patterns of the\nfamily\nand break those bad habits\nthat we can\nus millennials man we're doing some work\nit's exhausting but somebody's got to do\nit because i will not have my kids have\nthese bad patterns yeah you know what i\nmean they'll just have other ones now\nbecause yeah they'll make up their names\nyeah no but that's i i love hearing that\nand it's\nit's wonderful to understand that\neveryone\nis\nneeding help from an individual if you\nwant to change an area of your life like\ni just feel like\none of the things i'm certain about is\nthat if i'm serious about something\ni better be accountable to someone else\nin that area of my life whether that's a\ntherapist to coach a personal trainer\nwhatever it may be yeah and i think if\nyou're privileged enough and accessible\nenough to have that help in your life it\ncan make a huge difference but\nknowing that your parents aren't doing\nit yet yet they are using the language\nmy mom's oh yeah yeah she's much better\nyeah she's using the language\nmy dad's 20 years older than my mom wow\nso yeah he's like 74 and she's 54.\nso she's\nlike cool young hip kids and my dad's\nlike this is out of us i'm like oh no\nbut he's sweet and great i love that in\nthe beginning of your journey in music\ntoday we know that a lot of your\nrelationships inspire you just said that\nyou know your therapist told you to\nwrite a letter and so like you you hear\nthe toxic or poor relationships you've\nbeen in that have inspired music what\nwas different about what inspired you\nback then and what inspires you now like\ndo you do you ever think about that like\nwhat inspired your songwriting then and\nnow well back then\ni was a songwriter writing for other\nartists\nso i was\nthinking like what's not on the radio\nand what\nwhat could be on the radio but i when i\nwrote all about that bass it was like a\njoke like it was like i was like no\none's gonna cut this we've wasted a day\nof work and we'll just write a therapy\nsong for us\nlike because the co-writer was like a\nman and it was the first time meeting\nhim so it's kind of like a blind date\nand you're like\nwhere'd you grow up power and we both\nwere like we were chubby kids and we had\nto learn how to love ourselves and\ni was like how funny would it be that's\nlike i ain't no size 2. but i can't\nshake it shake it and i'm like i'm not a\nconfident dancer that dances in front of\neveryone but imagine if i was\nand i remember being like i'll sing the\ndemo who cares and it was like a raw\ndemo with no auto-tune and nothing but\nthe lyrics hit so many people that\nthey're like this is gonna be huge who's\nsinging it we'll just let her do it\nso it was really from like a\na weird raw place like i wasn't chasing\nradio i wasn't\nand i fell into that before when you\ntalk about competition\ni didn't know about charts and all that\nstuff when they're like you're number\none i was like fantastic like what is\nthat like number one everywhere they're\nlike everywhere i was like well that was\neasy\nso then anytime i did another song i was\nlike it's not number one everywhere what\ndo you mean like\nand then i was like well maybe i'm not\ndoing what's on the radio and then i\ncaught myself chasing radio and just\nfalling on my face\nso with this new album taken aback i was\nlike i'm gonna go back to when i did do\nup and just didn't care about any charts\nand anything and just do me yeah and\nyou'll hear that come out and the first\nsong they put out was a emo toxic\nrelationship song i was like oh okay\ncoming out passionate yeah and so it\nsounds like it's always been a raw\nemotion that yeah that's gone out and\nnow you're taking it back and you're\ngoing back to that and you're really\nearning that like with this with this\nnew album\nwould you say that we're hearing you\nthrough the healing process are we\nhearing you healed are we hearing you i\nthink you're here you're hearing you're\nhearing a healed\nmature\nmother\nwho um is just\nruthlessly honest you know like one song\ndon't i make it look easy that i tease\ntoday on my instagram um is like\ntalking about don't i make this look\neasy like everything's perfect because\neveryone who interviews me is like you\nare so fun and you have the best family\nand best life and i'm like i cry so much\nyou just don't know it because i don't\nfilm myself and post it you know so i\nsay in the first verse like i posted a\npicture i read all the comments i\nhearted the good ones and if i'm being\nhonest i probably spent an hour on it\nyeah and then i'm like\nand\nit's just like a fun\nway of being\nruthlessly honest ruthlessly that's not\nweird but brutally honest yeah yeah\nwhat's your take on that what you just\nsaid is like there's a lot of people\nwho'll say oh well if we're not taking\npictures of ourselves crying in our\nvideos of ourselves crying and posting\nit we're only posting the highlight reel\nlike we hear this all the time what's\nyour personal take on\nwhat showing up authentically means to\nyou\nuh i just noticed when i do talk about\nmy fun private personal stuff like my\nbathrooms it goes viral people love it\npeople are like wow she's goofy i'm like\nand and it's always a good reaction\nwhich feels great yeah like i use that\nas my therapy of like oh the world likes\nme for just who i am so i'm just gonna\ndo that and the more i did that like\nliterally the more popular i got or the\nmore people wanted to talk to me the\nmore i just like talk that's why i did\nthe podcast because we talk about\nprivate stuff that i'm like normalize it\nlike i have hard poops you know like\nand it just it makes i think it's more\nrelatable and people are like i have\nthat problem too that's and the first\nplace i saw that was my mental health\nwhen i saw carson daly on the today show\nexplain a full panic attack my mom\ndidn't understand what was happening to\nme my best friend she couldn't\nunderstand she couldn't help me when i\nsaid i need to go to the emergency room\nbecause i can't breathe and she was like\njust come here i'll rub your head i'm\nlike you don't get me right now i sent\nher that article and she was sobbing and\nwas like i finally get it because i\ncouldn't put it into words and when\ncarson did it i was like you don't know\nwhat you did for my whole family\nlike have you ever told him that oh yeah\nevery time i'm at the today show i'm\nlike\nsave my life you save my family\nrelationship yeah because i resented\nthem for that i was like how do you not\nunderstand what i'm going through you're\nmy mother like you're my favorite human\nbeing on this earth\nlike and and now she still cries about\nit she's like i didn't know what you\nwere going through and then she'll look\nback at her life and go oh i had a panic\nattack that day i thought i was just\nhaving a meltdown but my heart was\nstopping that day like i thought i was\ngonna die and i was like yeah\nwe're riddled with anxiety and you guys\nweren't allowed to talk about it but we\nare yeah so here we are help\ni'm like the biggest fan of screaming\nfor help yeah absolutely like\nsomething's wrong somebody help me\nwhat was your worst experience\nwith the that you remember so strongly\nwhere where you didn't feel anyone was\nthere to help and you were screaming out\nfor it i was in new york city\nmy first like big real panic attack was\n4 00 a.m it's one of those like never\nforget\n4 a.m i was in glam getting ready to\nannounce the grammy nominees for the\nyear after i won it's like a thing you\ndo when you win you go announce them and\nit was going to be live with gayle king\nand my assistant who's my bestie still\nis she was reading me my schedule for\nthat week\nand it was like sing here perform there\nafter all my vocal issues were happening\nand i'm just like if i do that this will\nmy voice will die and none of you will\nmake money you know like we're all going\ndown so i was reading this calendar and\ni was like but how would i if i go from\nthere to\noh there's no way i'm gonna make that\nand then i started getting light i get a\nlittle tingly every time i talk about it\nah you start dissociating like you start\nleaving your body like a ghost and like\nbreathing\nthat you start thinking about it and\nfull panic comes in and i started crying\nbecause i was like i think i'm dying and\nand i was like what's going on and i\njust had to scream cry and breathe\nand my husband who was my boyfriend at\nthe time and my assistant looked at me\nand said this is a panic attack and i\nalmost wish they never said that because\ni was like what this is what that is\nbecause i didn't know yeah i didn't\nreally know what people were saying like\nhow they felt you don't know until it's\nhappening\nand then when it ended they were telling\nme what's this i was like a lamp a tv a\nrug and that like snaps you back into\nyour body\nand once i calmed down they were like i\nwas like can that happen whenever and\nthey're like\nwish they didn't say that either yeah\nscrewed me for the rest of the day\nbecause i was exhausted and i went on\nlive tv and i haven't watched that clip\nsince but\ni remember i blacked out on the tv and\nwas just on autopilot and i was like\ndon't pass out don't pass out don't die\nlike don't have a freak out live on tv\nwith gail king and as soon as they were\nlike done i sat down on a chair and i\nlost it and all the people on the gail\nking show saw me\nand they looked at me like i was a crazy\nperson and they're like is she okay and\nmy team looked at me and they're like we\nneed to stop i was supposed to go do\nlike eight more interviews a whole day\nat work and they just said stop\ni went back to the hotel room and i\nliterally would run to the bathroom\nthinking i would have diarrhea i was\nlike no guys it's cool i just have the\nflu\nand they're like\nand i would explain it to people like it\nwas like the movies like when a demon\ntakes over my body\nand i had no control anymore\nand when a doctor tells you it's your\nown brain you're like\nwell then i'm gonna be in a psych ward\nlike this every day because i can't\ncontrol that i don't know how to\nand then also\ni overdosed on edibles\nwhich like you can't really do but i did\nit i usually would take i was\nself-medicating myself with five\nmilligrams of weed with edibles at night\nand it really helped in the beginning\nand it would help me sleep\nand one day i ran out of the specific\nedibles that i took and i ate like a\nlollipop that was 25 milligrams then i\nwas so high that i forgot i ate that and\ni ate another one and i usually take\nfive right i was up to 50. in one day 50\nmilligrams in one day i was doing a\npuzzle and i was like\ni'm not breathing like i\nso i tell people my soul left my body i\nsaid bye bye and i was dry heaving all\nnight and\nthat is very similar to what you feel in\na panic attack\nso\ngoing to those places twice my brain was\nlike we've been there and we could take\nyou there wherever whenever we want\nand so i was really unbalanced my\nchemicals were off for a long time\nmonths trying to figure out like some\ndays would be horrific couldn't get up\nsome and i was i was madly in love my\ncareer was great i would tell doctors\nlike i'm not depressed i didn't feel\ndepressed i just sometimes\nif i like sometimes i'll just feel like\ni have a migraine for the rest of the\nday i'd have ice packs on my head i'd\nhave my mom check my temperature i was\nlike no i just have a flu again this is\ncrazy\nand then i finally went to a\npsychiatrist\nand he explained to me your chemicals\nare like this and all day long your body\nis saying fire alarm fire alarm fight or\nflight run and i was like\nlike i was sitting with him and my back\nfelt like it was on fire i was like see\nit's crazy it's happening right now it's\nfeel it i think it's really hot he's\nlike no your chemicals are so messed up\nthat your body doesn't know where you're\nsupposed to be your adrenals are on fire\nso i went on my first ever\nantidepressants and i used to get\ncomplimented like wow you're the only\npop star not on antidepressants and i\nused to be like well look at me yeah and\nnow i'm like that's messed up that they\nsaid that to me yeah and\nlike it made me judge people and it was\nhorrible and now\nwhen i was on when i was finally on the\nmedication i'm on like the lowest dose\nand\nafter a month or two i was like\nit's quiet\nlike everything stopped and it was\namazing\nand i\nlike would talk to my psychiatrist like\ni only had one panic attack this month\nand it slowly went down and i it's been\nlike five years now and i haven't had a\nterrible one since i'll have nights if\ni'm over exhausted or my i'll say my\nbody's trying to trick me right now and\ntrying to pretend i'm in a panic attack\nand i know what you doing you can't mess\nwith me right now\nand my husband knows too he knows the\ndrill like\nit saved my life and i don't know what i\nwould do without those pills\nand i'm sorry i'm blabbing but you're\nnot exploring this please carry on when\ni was pregnant and i told people i want\nto get pregnant so\nmy doctor\ni um they were saying this pill is safe\nthat you're on but this low dose of\nativan is not safe get off of that so i\ndid get off of that and when i walked\ninto my doctor appointment pregnant like\nday one pregnant i was i brought my\nmedicine was like this saved my life and\nhe was like oh you could throw those\ncandies away\nand i was like\nwhat\nlike i didn't know what to say i was so\nscared and i was like it was covered\ntime so i couldn't i didn't have my\nhusband i was like what and i was in\nshock and i\nstayed with that doctor for like weeks\nand just got worse and i cried to\neveryone of like he just wants me to\nthrow them away but they saved my life\nand my other doctor said it's totally\nsafe to be on these so i don't know what\nto do\nand i eventually changed doctors and she\nwas i had a woman doctor and she was\nlike that's insane that he said that to\nyou these are perfectly safe to be on\nyou're fine and a happy mom is a happy\nbaby\nand i've been trying to tell every\npregnant mom or anyone who's going to\nhave a baby on antidepressants like\nyou you can safely stay on them and\nnothing bad will happen to your baby\nand i never had any postpartum i didn't\nhave any depression while pregnant and\nmy pregnancy was obnoxious i had\ngestational diabetes but\nwe did it we crushed it with\na good diet diet while pregnant i was\nlike what\ni said no no craving yeah but like it's\nstill like the stigmas\nin some of the doctors and it's like and\nmy baby came out c-section because he\nwas sideways and my baby was in the nicu\nfor five days and all those nurses\nsaid were you on antidepressants\nand i'm i just got sawed open i'm on\ndrugs like trying to heal i feel\nhorrible i don't get to see my prize\nthat i went through all that for\nand i'm in there trying to look at him\nin the nicu tank and they're like well\nit's because you're on antidepressants\nthat's why he won't wake up i'm like\nwhat\nand i asked all my doctors and they're\nall like dude there's no science that\nbacks that they're just pointing so they\ndon't get sued they're just saying well\nit's because you're on antibiotic\npresence and that's why\nand it was the most discouraging thing\nand i'm writing a book about it because\nit was it messed me up\nand i still talked to my doctor\nmy psychiatrist recently because i'm\ntrying to get lower on my\nantidepressants in case i want another\nbaby even though there's no science that\nbacks that that can hurt that baby then\nwhat happened after that my doctor's\nlike i i got the charts later because dr\neamon's like\nwhat like show me show me how they\nproved that yeah and all the charts said\nwas\nlike he's sleepy he's not waking up he\nwakes up on his own time but it was a\nc-section that's just traumatic for a\nbaby to come out anything can happen\nand it wrote mom 27 on antidepressants\nthat's it\nand i was like you know what's the worst\nthing you could tell a person who just\nhad a c-section was like it's your fault\nthat this kid's not awake wow but i\ncan't wait to have three more kids\nbut yeah thank you for sharing that and\nyou weren't blubbing at all it was\nactually really\nno not at all honestly it was so\nthank you for taking us there because i\nthink yeah it's very easy to\ngloss over some of the detail but\nactually to hear the details what allows\nus to really\nempathize in the best way possible but\nalso just to recognize how much stigma\nthere is even hearing the statement well\nyou were saying that oh you're the only\nmusic artist that's not on these yeah\nand now it's like all these are gonna no\none in my family is on them they should\nbe yeah they could be\ni have like plenty of people in my\nfamily that i'm like oh bipolar\nundiagnosed like\nfor facts and like sometimes they know\nit and they use booze to help it and i'm\nlike\nthere's better ways i take my pill and a\nhalf at night every night and i feel\ngreat and i don't have to chug a bottle\nof booze or eat edibles like there's a\nway that a safer way that you could do\nthis\num so yeah those pills helped me but my\nwhole family that they come from a place\nthat's like you need medicine yeah make\nyou feel better i'm like uh-huh and the\nbest is when like a doctor said to me\nwell you have asthma right and i was\nlike he's like you have an inhaler i was\nlike\nit's like why can't you have medicine\nfor your brain\ntotally period\nwhat do you think it was for you that\ndrew you in that direction of wanting to\nchange your habits because like we see\nwith so many musicians\nuh with so many artists as well it's so\neasy to go down the other road and like\nyou're saying it's not about looking\ndown on those people it's just they\ndidn't have a family but you're supposed\nto have the support but what was it for\nyou because obviously like you're saying\nthat the majority of your family may not\nreally understand why you need medicine\nbut you met a psychiatrist you've been\nvery proactive here yeah\nwhat made you so convinced that you had\nto make this change and that you wanted\nto find this way out because it's so\neasy and natural for you to turn towards\nalcohol i was for sure spooked and i um\ni knew something was wrong like i knew\nmy chemicals were off but i didn't know\nmy chemicals are off i was like my\nbody's broken my brain is broken and i\nneed help and i was scared i was scared\ni've saw me in a psych ward forever for\nthe rest of my life and i was like well\ni don't want that i want children i want\na family i want a career i want to keep\ngoing like finally all my dreams came\ntrue and this is happening no way i'm\ngonna fight this so i wanted to fight it\nbut also it really really helped me\nwhich is another reason why i talk about\nall my stuff in case it helps someone is\npeople like carson but also my older\nbrother ryan\nhe used booze and drugs for his anxiety\nand he's had\nhuge panic attacks that he never told us\nabout like he lived in our\num in our house and in his room\nhe would he told me oh my god i would\ni was pretty sure i was having a heart\nattack thinking it was the drugs but it\nwould be like a hangover convinced and\nhe would call it scary sundays\nand i was like this whole time you just\nhave crazy panic disorder but you've\nbeen like smothering yourself with booze\nand drugs\nflying through it he's like yeah stop it\ndown fly eat some drugs you'll be fine\nlike drink your medicine that's what you\nsay i'm gonna drink my mess and i'm\ngonna go to bed like he has sleep\nparalysis he has the most\nhis brain's way worse than mine was\nso\nwhen i would have my panic attacks i\nwould go to everyone in the house he\nlives in my house and i'd be like\nsomething's wrong and he'd go i've been\nthere i know what you're feeling go to\nthe emergency room ask for the lowest\ndose of medicine that you can get do not\nlet them give you xanax and then come\nhome and you're gonna be fine and having\nhim like my older soldier brother that\ncould get through anything look at me\nand be like\ni've done this\nyou're okay instead of my mom being like\nwhat are you talking about you don't\nneed a hospital he'd be like go go to\nthe hospital they'll tell you you're\nfine they'll give you oxygen you'll come\nhome you'll be great and having that\nlike\nacceptance but also not be alone feeling\nwas like he saved me wow and that's why\ni do this podcast with him because he's\nhe's now trying to be sober and in our\nfirst episodes of the podcast he like\nyou can see him freaking out and he's\nlike i don't get to have my medicine and\ni and he did it cold turkey he didn't go\nto any aaa and nothing no no therapy no\nhelp he did it by himself which is so\ndangerous don't ever do that yeah very\nvery rare now we're hearing like he\ncould've had a heart attack in his sleep\ni'm like oh my god like yeah he\nhe's i tell him i'm like you're you're\non extra time you're on borrowed time my\nguy but\nhe's my hero i'm very looking forward to\nmeeting him now you're gonna love him\nyou are gonna love him\nyeah wow what an incredible story and to\nhave you both go through that and we\nwe've had like amazing guests like dr\ndrew on our podcast and he loves like\nhe's so funny he loves celebrity rehab\nso he loved dr drew so when doctor i've\nbeen like ryan you got to go to therapy\nyou have demons in here like let's go\ntreat them that's trauma he was like no\nyou're obnoxious i'll never do therapy\ndr drew came on our podcast and was like\nbrains heal brains yeah you need another\nbrain to heal you yeah he was like\nyou're absolutely right i went to trauma\nwent to trauma therapy that week i was\nlike\nso whatever you tell him he'll be like\nyes sir i will do that\nlike so you're gonna have to write me a\nlittle list yeah like tell him\nyeah but it is true we all need to hear\nit from different voices different faces\ndifferent brains can't be his little\nsister yeah\nbut but now you're doing that for\neveryone who's listening and watching us\nlike\ni can't imagine everyone who just heard\nwhat you just shared and everyone's\nwatching this it's like\nthere is no one who could have heard\nthat not be transformed like genuinely i\nhope so man because like what carson did\nfor me is what i'm just trying to do for\nanyone out there\nbecause there's still parents out there\nthat are like mine that are uneducated\nand don't know\nand they're raising babies like me who\ndidn't know\nand had that stigma forever\nyeah and i look at my family and i'm\nlike oh man like my grandparents really\nneeded this you know like there was\nthere was great real crazy trauma back\nthen in my family yeah and that just\ngoes down the line yeah and i feel you\nonly saw it on the public figures so i\njust watched the elvis movie that just\ncame out and then obviously bohemian\nrhapsody about freddie mercury a few\nyears ago that came out and you start\nstudying the stories of all these\nincredible icons and artists and you see\nalcohol and you see drugs you know and\nyou see that go to a bitter end you know\nand it's it's painful when your heroes\nand your\ninspirations go that way but now when\nyou see them go the other way it's it's\nso it's so cool though that now it's\nlike\nthe rock stars that were like our heroes\nbut they died of an overdose we're like\nugh we can't do that nowadays like\nhealth is in right now i hope so we want\nto make it more i hope i know i want to\nmake it more in like even body types\nthough it's like fitness is hot i'm like\ni want to work out and be hot yeah\nhealthy not like i'm strong yeah i want\nto be strong i want muscles i see\nmuscles in my thighs now and i'm like oh\nmy god i'm so hot like\nwhat do you think that got you to that\nplace of your and it's so interesting\nhow so much of it is chemical and i and\ni've been thinking about that a lot\nlately that i know so many people who\nget into a negative rhetoric in their\nhead where it's like\ni'm the worst i'm i'm this and that and\nit spirals and they think there's\nsomething wrong like mentally or\npsychologically and there are changes\nthey're needed but so much of it is\nchemical like i had i've spoken about\nthis a few times it sounds so average\nbut when i heard it from my doctors and\nmy teams it fascinated me\nso i went recently i was\nprobably in the last 12 months 24 months\ni was feeling more tired and there's\nplenty of reasons for that we were\nrenting a house during the year\nthere's that but we were renting a home\nduring covid during the daytime it was\nbeautiful and at night time\nit didn't feel so beautiful and it was\nlike there were animals in the\nfloorboards and animals in the walls and\nlike so you could hear scratching at\nnight and like steps and like it was it\nwas hard to sleep and we just rented a\ndrink over to have a bit more space\nand so i was dying to move out and hence\nwe got this place and moved but\nduring that time i don't think my sleep\nquality was good and i always sleep\neight hours a night i'm very i don't\nnegotiate with my sleep i sleep 10 p.m\nto 6 a.m very important to me\nbut but at that time even though i was\nin bed for that long i wasn't getting\ngood quality sleep yeah and so i was\nfeeling exhausted so i started checking\nwith my doctor and they said your\nvitamin d levels are at a 10\nhealthy is a hundred and average is 60.\nand my my doctor said to me and my\nnutritionist and my health team that i\nhave yeah they said to me they said jay\nwe don't know how you're not depressed\nliterally and i was like i'm not\ndepressed at all i'm absolutely fine and\nthey're like well your chemicals in your\nbody show complete and i was like that's\nfascinating to me that sure because of\nmy meditation and mindfulness i was able\nto not be\nbut you could be depressed just because\nyou don't have enough vitamin d in your\nbody like you can be as simple as that\nwell i got a dietitian\nwho um\ntransformed my life she helped me\nhealthily lose 60 pounds which was like\none pound a week of\nchanging my lifestyle wow but food is\npoison you know like bad foods i just\nsaw a tick tock where this guy was like\ni had anger issues and i was mean and i\nwas in high school and even though i was\nlike a smart kid\ni i remember i ate like the burger and\nthe\ncafeteria food every day and no matter\nhow smart i was i was like i'm gonna go\nfight today because i was angry and when\ni started eating healthy i was less\nangry like yeah yeah i have a cousin who\nhas really anger issues but i also know\nhe eats\nfast food because my it's like food's\nexpensive and they can't go to whole\nfoods like me all the time and so and\nthere's three of the three kids so mom's\ntrying to feed all of them but i know\nthat that food is just feeding his anger\nand his you know so it's\nsuper sad watching that knowing like oh\nmy god the rest of the world you know\nyeah yeah i mean that's a challenge\nright it's how can we make food\naffordable accessible healthy tasting my\ndietitian she's like don't even get me\nstarted on like food\nin cafeteria for kids for children it's\nlike how do you expect them to work all\nday and like\nhave energy yeah it's like i would come\ni remember now and i would come home\nfrom school nap every day bro i'd nap my\nmom be like it's dinner wake up i'm like\nokay like\nno wonder i was like\nchubby and depressed and sad like yeah\nand it's hard again because it's all\nhabits yeah i was saying recently to\nsomeone like our biggest crisis is a\ncrisis of habits right yeah our life is\ndefined by habits yeah and we've just\nadopted a ton of bad habits mentally\nphysically emotionally and now we keep\nrepeating them that's what growing up is\nthat's breaking all these\ndietitians like you have to am i\ntherapist it's like you have to rewire\nyour whole brain yes everything you knew\nis wrong and i'm like oh my god yeah i\nknow that's great and even someone said\npoor mom like she was even trying to\nhelp us like we we're that family we're\nall chubby and my mom was like we're\ngonna do weight watcher snacks but like\nback then like it's still crap like it's\nstill like what are you eating and\nshe tried she tried to get all the low\ncalorie orange juice and we're like oh\nit's the orange juice is the issue you\nknow like yeah\nbut they tried they're uneducated they\ndidn't know so of course they didn't\nknow my mom was just doing her very best\nbut when i look back i'm like oh my god\ni was eating poison like yeah i used to\neat four chocolate products a day like i\nsaid chocolate see reese's pieces every\nday bro a chocolate biscuit a chocolate\nbar a chocolate yogurt and a chocolate\nice cream every single day\nyes and it was amazing that's why you're\nso nice it was amazing it was like you\nknow boys and girls club\nno it's like a place where kids can go\nafter school okay we had that on\nnantucket and we had our little snack\nthing we had i had\ncheez-its reese's blue powerade every\nday oh my god horrific yeah after school\ni go eat that and then play yeah and and\nthat's what and it totally actually is\nmy wife had to powerfully train me out\nof my addiction to chocolate and i know\nthat sounds so like no i need to do that\nto daryl i was literally addicted to\nsugar he's addicted to sugar i was\naddicted to sugar and my wife had to\ncompletely train me out of it and it's\nbeen an amazing journey for me because\nit sounds like sugar who cares it's like\nsugars\nit can get really bad right\nyeah it's like sugar is like the one\nthat everyone gets away with yeah like\npeople like when someone gets sober from\nalcohol or drugs we're like my brother\nhe's like i love sugar yeah i'm like\ncareful about it i literally was\ndependent on sugar for so many years and\nit took ages to get off of it and even\nnow i found i'm now at the other side\nwhich is really beautiful where now even\nwhen my mind still tricks me into\nwanting really unhealthy food yeah when\ni have it i actually don't enjoy it oh\nand you get sick yes yeah i notice any\ntime i cheat now i get ill and i'm like\nlike when you drink a bunch of booze and\nyou're like never again it's like that\ni'm like oh this is poison i forgot like\nand you have to remember that never\nagain yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\ntell me about you're you're in such and\nyou've spoken about in this interview\nalready you're in a healthy relationship\nnow uh you know and you have been for a\nlong period of time obviously with daryl\nwith food and my mind\ni got lucky and i'm so grateful i got to\nmeet darryl today because it's always\nfun and yeah he's amazing how did you\nknow\nthat that was how you were meant to be\ntreated because i think so many people\nget into a pattern of accepting a\ncertain level of treatment yeah i always\ni figured like\nbecause of like relationships i've seen\nin my family i'm like she'll deal with\nit and i'll i'll just train him to be\nbetter\nand when i met daryl\nhe still to this day like opens every\ndoor\ndrives me wherever i need to go because\nhe knows i'm scared to drive\ntakes care of me no one's ever taken\ncare of me like that except my parents\nand he says i'll take care of you to\nthis day and that's when i was like oh\nmy god i want to only be with you for\nthe rest of my life i want to be 105 and\ndie next to you while holding your hand\nand it's taught me how to care for\nsomeone and take and love them like that\nbut um\nyeah it was like the chivalry whatever\nit's called it was the\nit was the kindness and the\nsimple things\nof opening doors and making sure i was\nokay and he came on tour day 11 after\nday six when we said i love you day 11.\ni was like i have to do a\ntour now would you like to come with me\nand he was like well i got nothing else\nto do\nand he stayed on my bus and did the\nwhole tour with me and after every show\nhe caught me off stage he would carry me\nto the\nthe little golf cart and he would help\nme take my wig off and he'd massage my\nfeet\nlike month one meeting this person and i\nwas like you're gonna take care of me\nforever wow and he went through me when\ni had vocal surgery like four months of\ndating i had vocal surgery i couldn't\ntalk\ncouldn't say i love you back i was mute\nfor months and he still loved me\nthe way he treated me through my\npregnancy was insane\njust like and it makes me like as much\nas i tell the world like hey via mental\nhealth ask for help i also want to say\nhey don't settle for you know because\nthere's a guy out there that will\nrub your nasty feet after a two-hour\nshow\nand will worship the ground you walk on\nthey exist and i know it's hard in la to\nfind him but i found him and if i can\nfind them you can find them you know\nlike they are real\nand it's the people you want to\nprocreate with like he never saw himself\nas a father because his father left\ntheir family when he was one years old\nso he was like i'm gonna be a dad i\ndon't know what dad is he saw me and was\nlike i want babies with you like i want\nto procreate i want to make more of us\nand i was like we should make more of us\ni think that when they're like you know\nwhen you know that whole thing is like\noh i want forever and i want more views\ni want to make more views yeah\ni love that i figured out where did you\nget to a point where it was like it\nsounds like you were in your early years\nusing\nyour body as a way of validation and\nlike\nwhen or where are you now at in terms of\nvalidating yourself like where are you\nlooking for your validation from now\nwhere is it coming from at this point um\ni'm still super hard on my body like\ni've lost all this weight and i still\nfeel exactly the same\ni'm still like i can't wear shorts or i\ncan't wear sleeveless things and and my\nhusband catches me and is like you're\nbeing so mean to yourself look how\ngorgeous you are\nand uh it's a thing you have to work i\nhave to reprogram my brain to be like\nno i look good today and the only thing\nthat i saw actually make a difference\nwhich i truthfully don't do um\nis because i gotta do it more because\nit's so hard my therapist told me stand\nin the mirror\nnaked for five minutes put a timer on\nand just look at yourself day one i was\nliterally shaking because i was like\nlike it was already tough for me to love\nmy body but after the c-section scar\nwith all the stretch marks my family's\nlike smothered in stretch marks like\nit's genetic so i'm gonna get it got it\nso the stretch marks go up the c-section\ngoes across now i'm looking at myself\nlike\na lawnmower ran over me like i've been\nhacked and so and there's no fix in that\nso i was like staring at that like oh\nand all that trauma that comes with it\nbut aft and i was just looking at the\nclock like please be done\nbut day three when i did it i was like\nyou know what her thighs are cute you\nknow i started complimenting her and i\nwas like oh i see my brain changing\nalready\nand if i did it more i'd probably be\nbetter at it but like our bathroom we\nhave a giant mirror in it so when i when\ni get naked every day i see it and i\nthink that helps my mom like avoids\nmirrors and avoids she doesn't want to\nlike have my my father be anywhere near\nthe shower when she's in it\ni'm like oh my god i used to shower with\ndaryl like what like she's very hot and\ni think that's what keeps her\ninsecurities stuck there\nyou know you have to like literally\nget naked and start looking at yourself\nyeah because like this is our shell you\nknow\nthis is our our body this is what we got\nso like let's treat it well yeah and i\nthink that's the idea that if we can't\nlook in the mirror and say i'm happy\nwith what i see today yeah it's really\nhard to think tomorrow you're going to\nwake up and say i feel really happy with\nwhat i see tomorrow in the sense of even\nif you've changed whether you lose\nweight or gain weight whatever you're\ntrying to do\nif you're not happy with where you are\nnow it's never going to feel different\nyeah on the other side it's like because\nthat's just a repetitive pattern yeah\nwhen people are like how are you so\nconfident and love yourself i'm like oh\ni'm working on it every day yeah exactly\ni wrote a song called working on it\nwhich is why our podcast is that yeah\nbecause it's about when you go to\ncompliment and you're like ew\nyou like beautiful you're like shut up\nyo i'm disgusting it's like whoa i'm\ngonna work on not doing that and go\nthank you yeah yeah and like try to\nbelieve what they're saying yeah they're\nnot saying it they're not lying you know\nlike what's the benefit of them yeah\nwhen i was a monk we got trained\nbeautifully and how to receive\ncompliments it was like a big part isn't\nthat the hardest thing ever yeah and it\nwas but it was taught to us so\nwonderfully the first thing was always\nto\nreceive wealth from the other person so\nwhat you just said like thanking the\nother person because what you're doing\nis you're rewarding them for noticing\nsomething good yeah so you get an\nopportunity to say wow like they're\nnoticing something good whether it's a\nme or not it doesn't matter for now for\nnow it's just we should really\nacknowledge someone who decided to\ncompliment you versus criticize you the\nsecond step the second step was\nnow that you've done that think about\nwho gave you that quality think about\nhow you learned it did you get it from\nyour parents did you get it from your\nteachers who was in your life that gave\nyou that gift and now you get to turn\nthat compliment into gratitude and you\nget to thank that person so internally\nwhen you when you receive a thank you\nnot only do you get to receive it you\nnow get to thank someone else and and\npass that gratitude on and it's just\nthis beautiful process of compliments to\ngratitude which we know are great for\nthe brain yeah it's all good and so yeah\ni love that you brought that up it's\nreally special i love it what we're\nworking on this has been even more than\ni expected yes it is this has been thank\nyou i knew it's gonna be fun but it's\nlike we've done this beautiful thing\nwhere like we've gone really deep and\nthen you're just hilarious and then and\nthen adorable and then really deep and\nthen hilarious i'm like\neven playing with my emotions uh but in\nin the most beautiful way\nwe end every episode of on purpose with\na final five so this is the rapid fire\nso you have to answer in one word to one\nsentence maximum\ni'm so bad at that okay\ni could do it we'll probably go off\npiste because you're so interesting that\ni'm gonna be like oh tell me more so\nyeah yeah but anyway we'll start all\nright question number one uh what is the\nnumber one thing you're working on in\nyour relationship and what's the number\none thing daryl's working on\nunderstanding his feelings that sounds\ngood the boy can feel he's got a lot of\nfeelings and i'm like\ndr phil taught me perception is reality\nso even though\nit seems like he's being irrational yes\nbecause he is\ni have to realize like oh he's in that\nmoment right now and i have to\ntake care of him as if that's real and\nthen pull him out of it and i always do\ni love that and what's he trying to do\nfor you\nthat's like the toughest part for us\nbecause i'm so i'm sorry i'm using so\nmany words you're not but i'm so\nmassachusetts like stack up bro like i'm\nraised by brothers like\nwhy are you so emotional why are you\ncrying and he's like oh you know so\nhe's\ntrying to communicate better yeah his\nfeelings\nto me\nand trying to\nyeah i guess ask him he'll tell you yeah\ni'll have to ask him it's that it's a\nvery i'm cold and he's soft yeah\nbut it works\nman it works\nquestion number two uh what is your\ndaily routine for your anxiety today\nmy husband transcendental meditations\nevery day that's not

were having\nbabies we would ask older couples\nlike\nthat's the worst thing to do\nwe were like how do you have a marriage\nso long and the men would say\nson surrender or just like keep your\nhead down and i was like oh well don't\ndo that\nand then having babies they'd be like\nwell your life's over now and now it's\ntheirs and i was like that's not true my\nlife has just begun yeah so we hated\nthat advice\ndefinitely that's i'm glad you shared\nthat it can be really it can be so\nliterally opposite yeah it can be really\nreally detrimental yeah yeah i remember\nthat when i\nwhen i
