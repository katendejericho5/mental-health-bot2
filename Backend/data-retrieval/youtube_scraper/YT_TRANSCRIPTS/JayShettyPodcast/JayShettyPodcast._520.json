    "transcript": "when i finally got a job after 40\nrejections and i met people and they\nwere 21 and i was 26 now by the time i\nstarted my first job i was 26 years old\ni realized that i actually had the\ngreatest advantage which was i had\nmassive self-awareness i knew what my\nstrengths were i knew what my what my\nweaknesses were i knew what i had to\noffer and i knew what i wanted to do\nand i was just like i just took the\nbiggest risk\npotentially one of the biggest career\nrisks in life by becoming a monk\ni shouldn't be scared of anything\nanymore\nwelcome to imposters the show where i\nhave revealing conversations with\nworld-class execs athletes and\nentertainers about their personal\nchallenges and how overcoming those\nchallenges has shaped their careers and\nlives

list\nbut jay's path to success has been\nanything but linear as we'll discuss in\nour interview in fact to get to where he\nis today jay had to take some incredibly\nhard and unconventional career risks and\novercome massive amounts of imposter\nsyndrome\njay shetty thank you so much for joining\nimposters i want to say thank you to you\ni mean we've been working towards this\nfor a long time so i'm so grateful for\nall your love online i love connecting\nwith someone over twitter i think that's\nwhat we connected over yeah we we\nconnect over twitter at first then a few\ntimes on instagram a few times over\nemail but it's just interesting the\nworld we live in where i have so many\nfriends that i've never actually met in\nlife but i feel a closeness to them in\nin so many ways yeah definitely i feel\nthat warmth towards you too and i'm i'm\nglad that we're finally meeting in\nperson but thank you for the opportunity\nabsolutely so\ni don't know how else to say it other\nthan it feels like you've had\nseven careers in your life like it feels\nlike you have just experienced so many\ndifferent things um and people i think\ntoday know you as someone who's making\nwisdom go viral as a podcast host is\nsomeone who's written a book does all\nthese things\nbut you've had so many other experiences\nin your life that have kind of informed\nwhere you are now and so i would love\nfor you to take me from the beginning\nwhat was childhood like for a young jay\nshetty so i did this interesting\nactivity recently where i sat down\nand i realized i'd been working for\naround 20 years now and how old are you\ni'm 34. okay and so around 20 22 years\nand i just i was like wow that's that's\nan interesting number and i sat down and\ni wrote down every job i'd ever have i\nhave it in my notes section on my phone\nbut how many jobs i think i can say for\nmy memory let me go through it i don't\nknow the number but so\nit was\nnewspaper boy like paper delivery dude\nuh worked in a grocery store stacking\nshelves\nthen worked in retail\nselling like\nwomen's clothes denim that kind of stuff\nthen was a tutor\ni coached students at college to make\nextra money in younger years\nin things like economics and psychology\nand philosophy and things like that\nand then i lived as a monk for three\nyears\nthen i worked as a digital strategy and\ninnovation consultant at accenture\nthen i was a senior hosting producer at\nhuffington post\nthen i started my entrepreneurial\njourney which now has led to books\npodcasting media everything else so at\nleast eight which i think is such an\nimportant thing to call out because i\nthink people will look at you today and\nbe like god this guy he has it all he's\nin his mid 30s\nsuper wise he's built a massive audience\nyou know he has all these different\nlines of business like clearly he has it\nall figured out and i think just by you\nlaying out these whatever it is nine ten\njobs that you've had\nit has been anything but a linear path\nto get there and i'm sure from your\nperspective it's like you don't have it\nall figured out at all you're just\nworried you figured out\nand yeah it's just fun looking back that\nway yeah and trying to piece it out but\nsorry i'll answer your question i just\nthought that was interesting and i\nrecommend everyone does that activity i\nthink we often also think about our\ncareers as when i graduate from college\nand like but that's that's not your\ncareer like your career starts whenever\nyou choose for it to start\nuh\nthe question about my childhood or where\nthe first job they get your childhood\nyeah\ni'd say that i was born and raised in a\nfamily where obedience discipline were\ntop priority performing well at school\nwas really important to my parents and\nso despite me going to a fairly rough\nschool where education wasn't a priority\nof my peers my parents were emphasizing\nhomework after school work\nextracurriculars i was being trained\nfrom the age of eight to get into a\ngrammar school which is a school you\nhave to take an exam for\nthat gives you a private level education\nwithout having to pay for it my parents\ndidn't have the money to send me to\nprivate school but they wanted me to\nwork hard in order to do that and so i\nfelt like i lived a very disciplined\nlife uh look at that obviously when\nyou're a kid there's moments where you\naccept a normality and then there's\ntimes when you're like i just want to\nhang out and now i look back and feel\nreally grateful that my parents made me\ndo that because i think it gave me a\ncertain\nway of working that i wouldn't have\ndeveloped otherwise\nand\ni was pretty much a teacher's pet up\nuntil about age 14\nand then age 14 was when i went off the\nrails decided to rebel started getting\ninvolved in the wrong groups wrong\ncircles getting involved in activities\nthat i wouldn't recommend to anyone\neverything from experimenting with drugs\nthrough the\nuh violence through to\nyou know just just nefarious stupid\nactivities and stuff that i think most\nkids do\nbut i think we just got into it really\nyoung like 14 was a bit young for that\nand then by the time i was 18 i was kind\nof done and i kind of exhausted all of\nthe craziness\nand it was actually my dad who started\nhanding me biographies and\nautobiographies so my dad was worried\nthat i didn't like reading and so was my\nmom i really hated reading fiction the\nsame way i hated reading fiction so i\ndon't think i've read a book until i was\n14. my dad started giving me biographies\nand autobiographies and i read malcolm x\ni read martin luther king i also read\ndavid beckham and dwayne the rock\njohnson because i was a big wrestling\nand soccer fan growing up\nand so i was reading these really\ndiverse biographies and autobiographies\nand i was thinking wow these people have\nall done something phenomenal with their\nlife and that's where i started to get\nfascinated by personal development and\npersonal growth without knowing what\nthat was\nso two questions one is when you were\ngoing through kind of this phase after\n14 of being more rebellious\nof just experimenting what was it inside\nof you that was driving you to do this\nand do you think at that point in your\nlife you had a sense of\nwho you were what you wanted to be yeah\nyeah there was a certain self-awareness\nat the time that i could hear as a\nlittle voice in my head or my heart that\nwas like\nyou don't want to do that you're not\ngood at that do this and it was actually\nhealthy so my parents wanted me to do\nmedicine or science or\nyou know\nlaw or engineering and for me\nthose things scared me i was like i'm\nnot really interested in those things\nand i could have that voice inside of me\nthat was like do art do philosophy do\neconomics do design like those were the\nthings i gravitated towards\nand it was almost like i started to\nlisten to that voice\nand i started to not ignore that voice\nbecause it was so strong and i almost\nhad this\nrejection towards anything else that\nwasn't there\nat the same time i think there was a bit\nof\nme being naive there was a bit of\nwanting to fit in there was wanting\nvalidation wanting to be cool wanting to\nbe liked and then that part of me was\nseeking the\nwrong activities or the bad circles so\nit's like this weird juxtaposition of\nyour self-awareness which is guiding you\nin the right direction but then your low\nself-esteem which is guiding you in the\nwrong direction and so you've got these\ntwo things pulling on you and you\nobviously don't know this as a 16 year\nold i can only say this in hindsight but\nat the time i just thought yeah i fit in\nhere i'm trying to look cool here i\nthink people will like me if i'm this\nway and then it's like but wait a minute\ni don't want to be forced to do things i\ndon't care about so that's i was\ngrappling with that absolutely i'm\ninterested you know as we move forward\nin your life you ended up going to\nschool to university\nthinking you were going to work in\nwhether it's financial services or\nconsulting and then kind of in by\nhappenstance you were introduced to the\nthe work of of monks and ultimately\ndecided after you know three summers uh\nvisiting the ashram to\nbecome a monk for three years\nhow hard was that decision when you just\nhad talked about\nduring your rebellious years at least a\npart of you was driven by kind of uh the\nneed for validation\nit i would say it wasn't actually a\npopular decision to become a monk like\nit wasn't something that was familiar to\nother people\nso how were you able to kind of\nwithstand called the pressure from\nothers to do what was expected of you\nyeah\ni think we're always living two lives\none is the life you want\nand the other is the life you think\nothers want you to live\nand we get stuck in between those two\nlives\nand often we feel like we're living too\nfar off the edge of what other people\nwant us to live and often we feel like\nwe're living too close to the version we\nwant to live\nand that dance is really fascinating as\nlife goes on\nand\nwhat i found at the time was\ni was being drawn closer and closer and\ncloser to my own values\nand i was being drawn closer and closer\nand closer to what was important to me\nso\nat that time if you asked me what i\nthought i was going to be i would have\nsaid something like i'm going to be a\nrapper right i love spoken word i love\nwriting lyrics i loved music i played\nthe drum kit i played the piano growing\nup i can't play anything anymore\nand i was highly into music and i was\nlike i want a career in music that's\nwhat i probably would have said\nand then as time moved on i uh would\nhave moved away to being okay let's be\nmore realistic jay you can't do that\nthat's not real for an indian kid\ngrowing up in london let's be more\nrealistic i was like well maybe i want\nto be a\nuh an art designer or an um\nart manager at a magazine because i\nloved art love design\nand then it said oh no jay be more\nrealistic that's not really a career\npath because everyone in your\neveryone who you're surrounded by is\ndoing far more serious in real careers\nthan that okay let's go and get a\nbusiness degree right it's like you\nliterally go from\nthis is the truth of what i want to let\nme water it down a bit and then to let\nme completely water it down so i\nremember telling my art teacher who i\nwas really good friends with at college\ntelling him i'm turning down my offers\nto go to like art school which is what i\nthought i wanted to do to go and do\na management science degree\nyou know at cass business school yeah\nand you know he was joking around he's\nlike you're such a seller like he was\nlike you said i was like i am i'm a\nsellout that's terrible\nand that's kind of where i ended up and\nit's really fascinating that i went\nthere because i was like this is the\nsafe thing to do\nand then i do the least safe thing in\nthe world by becoming a monk and so it's\nreally fascinating how i went on that\nend of the spectrum and then i want to\ngo back so\ni think what happened is there's only so\nlong you can stay away from your true\ncalling\nand you can push it down you can ignore\nit you can suppress it as much as you\nlike but it's going to keep showing up\nin really\nuncomfortable ways and it will start\nquiet but it will get louder and for me\nit got really loud at 21\nwhen i thought to myself which life do i\nwant to live do i want to live a life of\nchasing success or do i want to live a\nlife of service and i would say that\nthat decision at 21 became easy\nbecause of the three years of experience\nbefore and i think people look at that\nas like that's a big change but that big\nchange was easy because there were lots\nof small experiences that led up to it\nand so every summer like you rightly\nsaid i'd go to live with the monks\nand that mini experiment every summer\nmade me confident that if i did this\nlong term that i would enjoy it and i\nthink people think oh no you just\nchanged your life it's like no i didn't\nso and you're right i'm glad you raised\nthis because a lot of people say to me\ntoday they're like jay you really like\nuse this monk thing it's part of your\nstory and i'm like trust me becoming a\nmonk is not a story like when you're 21\nbecoming a monk was the least cool thing\ni could possibly do\nmy friends and this is honest just my\nguy friends thought i was gay like\nliterally that's the response i got\nthat's how far behind things\nyou're gay right like that's i'm like\nhow is this\nlike how is that even connected totally\nbut that's what they thought\ngirls didn't want to talk to me anymore\nbecause they thought they weren't\nallowed to talk to me and and what was\nhappening in my path and then my family\nthought that i'd wasted my parents\ninvestment in me and my education yeah\nand so everyone's saying you've\ncommitted career suicide you're never\ngoing to get a job again and you're\nruining your parents life and it's just\nso interesting again just thinking about\nyour own development and your own\nawareness that you were able to get to a\nplace where despite all of that you know\npeople saying\noh you must be gay or you can't see\nwomen oh it's career suicide that\nsomehow you had gotten to this point in\nyour life where you felt enough\nconnection to\nyour values or what you deemed to be\nyour calling that you were willing to do\nthat because i would say that is\nvery difficult at any stage of life but\nit's exceptionally difficult as a 21\nyear old when there is so much social\npressure yeah and i give all the credit\nto my monk mentors and teachers and\nguides because it's not i didn't have\nthat resilience\nbut they'd given me an experience of\nsomething\nand i believed that that experience was\nmore powerful than my feelings or what i\nwas hearing and that's why i think we\ntry and make decisions in our head like\nwe try and figure everything out in our\nhead and we're like if i can figure this\nout in my mind then i'll figure out in\nlife and it's like no go and have a real\nlife experience go and do the thing for\na short amount of time and then you'll\nknow what to do and so i think you can\nonly spend that much time in your head\nfiguring out personality tests and\nconversations and questions and\nreflecting and introspecting and after a\nwhile you just got to go do the thing\nand if i never went and spent those\nsummers living as a monk i would never\nhave wanted to be one because i don't\nknow what it feels like totally i'm\ninterested for you to talk in a second\nabout when you went to become a monk the\nwork you did and how you knew that\nyou enjoyed that work because what i've\neven realized right after\nselling a business in the last few years\nand thinking about what's next\ni always will intellectualize how do i\nknow if i am enjoying the things that\ni'm doing do i love this work am i\npassionate about it and the issue is the\nmore that i overthink am i passionate\nabout this thing the less i feel\npassionate about it because i'm\nintellectualizing the experience so tell\nme you know what was it like to be on\nthe ashram for three years and how did\nyou know\nat least some part of that work was\ntruly what your calling was\nyeah so there's\nthere's two parts to any work we do\nthere's the process\nand there's the result\nand loving the work you do means you\nlove the process\nand you accept the result whereas the\nway we've been trained in modern society\nis all that matters is the result if the\nresult is good then you must love your\njob if you see someone win an oscar they\nmust love their job if you see someone\nmake lots of money and sell their\ncompany they must be happy so we define\nsomeone's happiness based on how the\nresult is whereas all ancient wisdom\nwould suggest is happiness is based on\nhow much you enjoy the process\nand the process is as enjoyable as you\nbelieve it's aligned with your values\nand what you care about and so at the\ntime my goal of becoming a monk was\nsimple i wanted to learn to master my\nmind my ego my envy my jealousy\nmy comparison\nand my\nillusion\nand i wanted to serve i wanted to\nimprove the lives of other people i\nwanted my life to make a difference in\nother people's lives so i knew that as\nlong as i was doing work in those two\nareas\nno matter what activity you do you'd be\nhappy and i think that's another\nchallenge we do we get locked up in the\nactivity do i like being an interviewer\ndo i like being a writer do i like being\na podcaster and if you ask me i'm like i\nwould use any tool possible\nto master my mind and improve the lives\nof other people i'm not attached to what\nmedium or forum i only use social media\nbecause it was the last option it was\nthe last thing i wanted to use but there\nwas no other option that i had because\nno one else would give me a chance so\ni'm not attached to the medium or the\nrole it's like you're focused on\nwhat do you want to\nbring to the world and what intention\nare you bringing in so to me it's about\nfiguring out\nwhat you're truly trying to create for\nyourself and so during my time as a monk\ni was waking up at 4am we were\nmeditating for four to eight hours a day\nyou're sleeping on the floor you don't\nhave a bed all your possessions fit\ninside a gym locker and you do that\nevery day\ndo i enjoy that no\nam i passionate about that no\nbut i believe it's gonna help me master\nmy mind\nokay i'm in i can do that right every\nday we were out in the sun\nit's 110 fahrenheit right it's it's hot\nyou're out there laying bricks you're\nout there doing agricultural work on the\nfarm do i enjoy that no\ndo i really love that no but do i\nbelieve that that it positively improves\nthe lives of other people that we're\nserving yes\nokay it fits\nand so\ni enjoy the process because i trust the\nprocess is giving me what i need but i\ndon't have to enjoy that direct activity\nright because that's pleasure one i feel\nlike that's such an important nuance\nright because you talk about enjoying\nthe process and if someone hears what\nyou're saying like no i didn't enjoy\nlaying bricks i didn't enjoy agriculture\nthey'd be like but isn't that the\nprocess and i think this the distinction\nyou make is there are activities that\nsit within this process it's not\nnecessarily about enjoying those it's\nabout how do these serve ultimately\nwhat you're trying to accomplish the\nvalues you're trying to live out correct\nand that that\nyeah i love that you're making that\ndistinction and i'd maybe i can\narticulate it better\ni didn't love the activity\nbut i loved what was happening to my\nintention while i did the activity yeah\nand that's what you're falling in love\nwith and i get that that's a really like\nmeta ethereal idea but it's like\nyou are looking at that going i do this\nbecause i know what's being built right\nnow while i do this that's loving the\nprocess i think what jay is saying here\nis so important if you have a clear\nsense of your own values and you're able\nto see how the work that you do serves\nthose values it can feel easier to\nembrace the sometimes mundane or tedious\nor completely unenjoyable aspects of\nyour job\nsometimes taking a second to step back\nand remind yourself of your intentions\nand why you're doing the job that you're\ndoing can have a really powerful effect\non your willingness to push through the\nworst aspects of it we're going to take\na quick break here but when we come back\njay gets into why he decided to leave\nthe ashram and how he navigated feeling\nbehind professionally from his peers to\nultimately finding success\nthis episode of imposters is sponsored\nby sakara feeling great starts with\nwhat's on your plate which is why sakara\nhas simplified healthy balanced dining\nzakara is a wellness company

years on the\nashram you decided to ultimately leave\nwhy did you leave um and\nwhat was the response when you left yeah\nso lots of reasons why i left\ni was really experimenting with my\nhealth i was experimenting with longer\nmeditations longer fasting\ni was really pushing the limits of how\nfar meditation could go to replace sleep\nhow far meditation could go to replace\nphysical energy and i and i really took\nmy body to\nlens that broke my body practically and\nthat wasn't a fun feeling at all uh\nended up in the hospital you know i talk\nabout this in the book of course i was\nin bed for like 14 hours a day for\nplenty of time it was it was really\ntough and it was all my own doing it was\nall my own experimentation\nthat was part of it but really what was\nit that was what was happening outside\nyeah and what was happening inside was\nas you are practicing being a monk you\nget more self-awareness and you get more\nintrospection and i started to realize\nthat my desires were not aligned with\nthe desires of long-term monks so i\nwould sit and talk to monks who'd been\nthere for 10 20 30 years\nand i'd listen to them and i'd be like\ndo i want to live like that and the\nanswer was no what were their desires\nversus yours well their desires were\ncomplete surrender\ncomplete service\nno personal\ncreativity or personal expression\nand for me i was like but i want to\nshare what i'm learning in this way and\ni can see the link between this\nscripture and this movie and this song\nlyric reminds me of this verse in the\nvedas like to me i was like\ni'm a kid growing up in london who loves\nmusic loves movies loves life and i'm\nseeing all the correlations and\nconnections and i'm saying i want to\nmake those connections for people\nbecause then maybe people can live these\nideas in their life and so i always had\nthat where i wanted to make wisdom more\npractical accessible and relevant\nbecause i saw its power and i and i felt\ncalled to do that\nand\nit was as much a realization that i\nwanted to do that as i wasn't a monk and\nthat's hard because\nyou know you feel married for three\nyears literally and then you feel like\nyou're getting a divorce and that's\nactually how it felt for me i felt like\ni was divorcing the love of my life it\nfelt like a breakup\nand\nit was really tough leaving because it\nalmost felt like i went back to all that\nnoise where everyone was right you're\nnot going to get a job\nhow are you going to fit in now\nyou've lost all your friends and now\nyou've gone back to a world where your\nfriends are like 25 26 years old\nthey're you know\nin relationships they're potentially\nbuying their first home or like you know\nmoving into a fancy apartment or they're\nnow promoted to their next position\nthey're doing well for themselves and\nyou're thinking oh i am behind and so\nthat's how i felt when i got back i'm\nbehind\ni'm lost and i didn't think i made a bad\ndecision i just i was like how do i\ncatch up now\nand so how did you catch up how did you\nwork yourself out of\ni would say a very rational thought of\ni've almost been stuck in time\neverything's accelerated how do i\naccelerate yeah i didn't know who the\nprime minister of england was i didn't\nknow who won the world cup like i didn't\nknow i had no idea and so i was truly\nbehind i spent nine months when i left\nwell the first month i always talk about\nthe first month was my worst month where\nall i did was eat chocolate listen to\nmusic catch up on all the tv i remember\nwatching every episode of how i met your\nmother i went and found a list on imdb\ncalled movies to watch before you die\nand i watched every movie on that list\nlike i literally went into full like\nlazy yeah the pendulum just swapped\nout yeah i wasn't waking up early none\nof that\nand then i was like okay this is not\nsustainable so for those\nthat time i started going i started\ndressing up going to my local library\nturning up reading books i was reading\nscriptural books monk books again and\nthen reading business books to try and\nfigure out what i'd missed out on and\nlife i was dressing up as if i was going\nto work but if you asked me what helped\nme catch up it was when i started work\nwhen i finally got a job after 40\nrejections when i finally got a job\nand i met people and they were 21 and i\nwas 26 now by the time i started my\nfirst job i was 26 years old\nand\ni realized that i\nactually had the greatest advantage\nwhich was i had massive self-awareness i\nknew what my strengths were i knew what\nmy what my weaknesses were i knew what i\nhad to offer and i knew what i wanted to\ndo\nand i was just like i just took the\nbiggest risk potentially one of the\nbiggest career risks in life by becoming\na monk\ni shouldn't be scared of anything\nanymore yeah like that was the scariest\ndecision that i made at a time when\nthings were more vulnerable i shouldn't\nbe scared of anything and so i became\nfearless\nand so that fearlessness led to me\nmaking big scary decisions in a big\nscary organization\nwhich paid off because i now wasn't\nready to follow what everyone else was\nbeing told to do and everyone else who\nwas 21 who was still following the rules\nfrom college and university they thought\nall right we need to follow the rules\nthat's what being told to do and my\nthing was well no i'm not going to\nfollow that rule because i think i'll do\na better job this way and thankfully\nthat paid off now i had people in the\ncompany senior people\nsome of them were my biggest champions\nwho i love and i'm so grateful to and\nsome of them were massively intimidated\neven though they probably made\n20x what i made at the time but they\nwere intimidated and they were trying to\ncontrol and trying to manipulate so it\nwas tough living there but i'm really\ngrateful that i did\nand so if i remember correctly you were\nboth\nworking within accenture but then you\nwere asked at some point to give a talk\non mindfulness to a thousand people\nwithin the company then he started\ntraveling around the company right yeah\nso\nthis credit goes to a lady named jilly\nbryant she's left accenture now\nbut she was the head of all the new\nhires in london so about a thousand of\nus\nand she noticed that on my like fun fact\nabout me i'd said that i lived as a monk\nand i meditated and that i used to teach\nmeditation and at the time accenture was\ntaking and they are taking mental health\nvery seriously\nand so she reached out to me and she\nsaid jay we have this big event coming\nup at twickenham rugby stadium would you\nmind talking about social media which is\nwhat i was doing at work and talk about\nmindfulness and meditation on stage and\npotentially even leader meditation\nnow at the time i had no brand no social\nmedia no one knew my name i was asked to\ncome onto stage in between will\ngreenwood who is a rugby world cup\nwinner with the england national team\nand the ceo of the company in the uk\nso i'm already having massive imposter\nsyndrome because i'm going\nthis guy won a world cup for the country\nthis person's the ceo of the company\nlike what am i going to say and these\nare a thousand people who are my peers\nwho have no respect for me and there's\nno authority here\nand that is a beautiful position to be\nin because you start realizing that\nyou you're not living off of influence\nso you're not living off of a position\nyou live off of who you are and how you\nhold yourself and so i went up on stage\ni was nervous to the point i went on and\ni led a meditation and the feedback i\ngot was they'd never seen a group of a\nthousand people\nhold silence for that long\nand it was a really like\nreassuring comforting feeling like it\nwasn't like yes we did it it was more\nlike\nwow this stuff works in the real world\npeople care and so yes then i got\ninvited across the company to teach\nmindfulness and meditation\nuh set up mindfulness mondays\nmindfulness meditations before meetings\ni got really involved in the i was so\ngrateful to accenture for championing a\npersonal skill set in a big professional\norganization with 500 000 people\nit's interesting because it sounds like\nsomething that helped your imposter\nsyndrome in that moment was kind of the\ninternal validation you had after you\nsaw this entire group of people sit in\nsilence you were told that this was as\nlong as they'd ever sat in silence like\nit it was reassuring to you that the\nwork that you were doing could be really\nmeaningful\ni'm also sure that this wasn't the only\ntime you've experienced imposter\nsyndrome in your life and given the name\nof the show\ngiven so many people experiences\ni'm interested how you think about\nnavigating imposter syndrome and i'll\neven say from my perspective right now\nlike i feel massive imposter syndrome\nhosting a podcast with you as a guest\nwhere i'm just like how how do i host a\npodcast talking about vulnerability and\nchallenges in people's lives and being a\nsounding board for them when\nthe seat the person in the seat across\nfrom me is someone who literally spent\nthree years as a monk and has done so\nmuch more work to truly understand\npeople\nhow do i do it and so i can just imagine\nhow many people experience imposter\nsyndrome in their life\nwell first of all that's very kind of\nyou and and i don't think of it that way\nat all i think every question you've\nasked me has been so heartfelt has been\nso sincere so genuine\nuh you know everything that you've\nshared with me today even before today i\nalready knew i was going to love you\nbefore today like because all the\ninteractions we had on twitter and you\nyou think like how can you do that on\ntwitter but you can when you're as\ngenuine and sincere as you are so i was\nexcited to be here i'm grateful to be\nhere honestly\nuh i would say that\ni don't think you ever stop feeling\nimposter syndrome if you're growing\nif you're growing if you're learning you\nwill always feel impostor syndrome\nbecause what imposter syndrome really is\nis a sign that you still have a skill to\nlearn or an experience to have\nso i still feel it on a daily weekly\nmonthly yearly basis and i don't ever\nwant to stop feeling it because it shows\nme that i need to grow and i need to\nlearn\ni connected to a beautiful book called\nflow\nand flow talks about how to experience a\nstate of flow which musicians experience\nwhich artists experience\nwith singers experience is when your\nchallenge\nmeets your skills\nbut what most of us experience on a\ndaily basis is our challenge is above\nour skills which means we get scared we\nget threatened we get\nconfused we feel lost\nor what we experience is the opposite\nwhere your skills are above your\nchallenge\nthen you feel bored\nyou feel tired you feel lethargic you\nfeel complacent\nso really what imposter syndrome is\nsaying is that your skills are not as\nhigh as your challenge\nbut you can fill that gap if you truly\ndeeply want to you can make that leap if\nyou want to\nand so now when i feel a sense of\nimposter syndrome i ask myself what\nskill is being highlighted to me that i\ndon't have it's not a feeling it's not\nan emotion it's a skill like i'll give\nan example if i'm sitting around a table\nof people\nthat i feel are more\nqualified than me in a certain area\nlet's say i'm sitting with a group of\npeople and they're all amazingly deep\ninto real estate right that's that's\ntheir thing\ni'm gonna feel like an imposter because\ni'm not that deep into real estate\nand then i have to ask myself so what\nskill do i now have okay real estate\ninvesting do i want that skill or am i\nhappy being in this space for example\nand so the question isn't not only what\nskill don't you have what do you want\nthat skill because often you can get\npursuing a skill just to impress people\ntotally and so i think that's what i\nwould encourage people to do with\nimposter syndrome is\ntake it away from this feeling of like\ni'm not good enough i'm not smart enough\ni'm not this enough yeah you're not\nsmart enough figure out what you need to\nget smart at right and that's how i see\ni'm like okay i'm not i'm not qualified\nto this do i want to be qualified\ntotally i think in a lot of ways what\nyou're doing is you're putting\ncontrol back in the hands of the person\nthemselves right so it's all about\nreframing it as this is actually a great\nthing because you're pushing yourself\ninto an area of discomfort where you now\nhave the choice of there's a gap between\nyour skill and the challenge that you're\nfacing and you have that choice of if\nyou want to close that gap and by the\nway you can make the choice not to close\nthat gap if you don't want to do it\nexactly exactly so when i first started\nmy career and i was mainly known for\ncreating video content which were like\nfour minutes\nwe then built the podcast i felt like an\nimpostor when i launched the podcast now\nwe've done the podcast for three years\nand it's very natural\nand then when we launched the book it\nwas like that was scary and then now\nwe're doing a book again that doesn't\nfeel scary so every time you make a new\nleap you'll feel impostor syndrome but\nthat's great\nbecause that means you're growing that\nmeans you're trying something new i\nwould never feel impostor syndrome if i\nnever tried anything new\nand that means i would live a boring\nsame life and i don't want that yeah\nthinking about your experience within\naccenture um it feels like this\ncombination of just\namazing kind of\nuh\nharnessing of an opportunity you were\ngiven to use the experience you had in\nthe ashram to spread kind of what you\nlearned throughout the company while\nalso kind of being on the forefront of\nsocial media you know while you say you\nwere a little bit late to it because you\ndidn't have a facebook until whatever\nage you still were early now in\nretrospect within what's happened with\nsocial when you reflect on kind of\nalmost like these two amazing kind of\nskills you were able to build up that\ninformed where you are in your career\nnow how much do you think about your own\nexperience as\nskill\nand uh\nhard work and grit and how much do you\nthink of it as\nluck and and how do you think about that\nrelationship broadly in career\ni would say that\nand i'm going to be honest because i\nthink that's the only way to do it i\nwould say that\nmy greatest skill is knowing that i can\nlearn something if i want to\nand that if i apply myself to it\nand i really deeply care about it\nthat i will find a way to get really\ngood at it and i don't think you can\nseparate that\nfrom impact because impact means\nthere's a beautiful\nquote by\nbruce lee\nwhere he said that i'm not scared of the\nperson\nthat has practiced\n10 000 kicks one time each\ni'm scared of the person who's practiced\none kick ten thousand times\nand that's the switch that we have to\nmake is that are we willing to practice\nthis one kick this one move 10 000 times\nor whatever it may be\nand that to me is the difference maker\nso i would say that there's a lot of\nstrategy\nbecause now it all makes sense like\nsocial media meditation oh that fits it\ndidn't make sense when i was collecting\nthose skills and so\nas steve jobs says you can only connect\nthe dots uh looking backwards you can't\nmoving forwards\nto me when i was collecting it i was\njust like i love people\nand i love connecting with lots of\npeople so social media would be useful\nmaybe that's literally all i had as a\ntool it wasn't like oh i'm gonna learn\nthis then i'm gonna learn this and then\nwe're gonna it wasn't that thought\nthrough and at the same time when i\nbecame a monk it wasn't like oh one day\ni'm going to write a book about being it\nwasn't that it was hey i think this is\nwhat my calling is so it was a naive\ninnocent following\nof what i'm being called to do at the\ntime\nthen matched with what do we do with\nthis now that we have it as a skill and\ntaking a risk based on that so i would\nsay it's\nit's\ni don't know what you call that whether\nit's discipline\nyeah\nit feels like the combination of like\nintuition and action when an opportunity\nthat's good yeah that's better than what\ni was about to say so i'll tell you that\nyeah\nintuition action yeah i just came up\nwith this intuition accident uh and and\ni would add a massive sense of\nbeing open to risk again\nagain and again and\nand then i would say it's brilliant\nmentorship and guidance so i give all\nthe credit to the people i met if i\ndidn't meet really\ncritical people at different times and i\ndidn't form a relationship with them and\nthey didn't invest in me and i didn't\ninvest in them\nthat was everything like for me\nespecially so that you could say was\nluck that was the luck the luck was that\nthese people came into my life\nand we clicked at really specific times\nand that was the luck well i would say\nthe skill there was\nyou know\nmy my intuition is that when you were\nbuilding these relationships it wasn't\ndoing so in a way where you were getting\nsomething out of it you were getting\ninto these relationships because you\nlove the people the people that they\nwere and you want to just be closer to\nthem i'm still friends with every one of\nthose people yeah like deeply like i\nmessage them all the time and they're\nstill involved in my life in so many\nways and i i all the credit goes to them\ni'd say any career success i'd give it\nto them because\nit's not that they told me what to do or\nhow to do it or invested money it wasn't\nthose kind of things it was people who\njust\nchanged the way you thought yep by\nplanting simple seeds and planting\nsimple ideas at different times in my\nlife so yeah i would say there's a mix\nof luck strategy intuition action but\nultimately i think it comes down to\nthree things passion\nstrengths\nand service that's ultimately what it\ncomes down to is the passion to learn\nanything and everything\ndeveloping an actual skill in the\nsubject matter you want to do and then\nwanting to serve through it which is\nwhere the fulfillment comes from and so\nto me i'd narrow it down to those three\nthings so something you talk about\nin your journey as being one of the more\nstressful points\nin your life is\npost accenture you had decided that you\nwanted to kind of create these videos\nyou ended up creating them i believe in\nlondon at a time in day where there's no\nstreets on the road so it was perfect\nmoment um you try to pitch all these\nmedia executives on be able to do it\nultimately you're given an opportunity\nwith huffington post\nand the videos absolutely crushed it\nupon publishing i think uh the first uh\nweek like the first video did a million\nviews then it was a million and 24 hours\nbut then you talk about at a point in\nthe journey of huffington post\nwhere\nyou were working there it was going\ngreat but you were within\nfour months of not having money to live\ntalk about just that period in your life\nand how you worked through it yeah and\nand even getting all everything you just\ndescribed is just\nsuch a tough time because\ni was getting mad i got married changed\njob three times moved country all in the\nsame year\nand that was that year that you just\ndescribed and so that was a fully\nintense year what year was that that was\n2016. yeah\n2016. and this time that you're talking\nabout was coming up to 2017\nwhen\nmy\nmy work at huffington post ended uh\nariana huffington had led to start\nthrive global who's she's still a dear\nfriend and mentor and wonderful human\nbeing but my work there was ending she'd\nleft she'd moved on my position kind of\nwasn't there anymore and i was four\nmonths away from being broke and 30 days\naway from my visa to america being taken\naway because it was attached to my work\nvisa\nand so not only did i have to figure out\nhow to sort my visa out i had to figure\nout how to pay for more than renting\ngroceries beyond four months\nand\ni\nalways used to have my mentor thomas\npower one of them would always say to me\nyou only discover your potential when\nyou're in pain he'd always keep\nrepeating that and i'd be like nah i'm\nproactive like you're whatever like i'm\none of the hardest working people out\nwhatever and then i was put into pain\nlike that was real pain and i thought\nokay i'm gonna discover my potential in\nthe pain okay i'm gonna discover my\npotential in the pain the next day after\nlearning that i only had four months\nleft in the bank for rent and groceries\ni got up and i emailed dm'd tweeted and\nmessaged every person that i'd ever met\nand said i will edit videos i will\nrecord videos i will film videos i will\ndo anything you possibly need me to do\nat this time me and paul who's sitting\nright there we would incorporate videos\nfor other clients paul do you remember\nthat office we went in we did all these\nquestion videos\nand so me and paul went into this\ncorporate company i'm producing\ncorporate training videos\nthat's not what i want to do that's not\nmy passion that's not my life but it was\nwhat i needed to do to survive you\ndidn't have an option i didn't have an\noption so that year the year when i\nthought i was going to struggle to\nsurvive i made more money in that year\nthan in my whole career combined up\nuntil that point because i was so\nstressed that i wasn't going to be able\nto pay my bills but that's because i was\nliving under that pressure and that fear\nit\ncatapulted me and incentivized me to\nanother level and all of a sudden i'd\nbroken my own ceiling and i was like\noh\ni had no idea what i was capable of\nuntil that happened and so i just kept\nstretching every single year and so for\nthe past five years we've just been\nstretching the capacity every single\nyear and it blows my mind because i\nwould never have believed any of it was\npossible and it's only been possible\nbecause that pain forced me into a\naccelerated period that i never imagined\ni'd would have got into if i didn't end\nup in that pain so one last question i\nhave for you is\nhow do you deal with the difficulties of\nhaving\nthe brand that you have today and i mean\nthat in two ways\nin one way when people say\njay has commercialized mindful\nmindfulness and is making a lot of money\noff of mindfulness something that\ngenerally the focus isn't on material\nthings and the the second is for your\nown work for your own self\nhow do you\ncontinue to\nhave the mind that you want to have\nwhile working with let's say platforms\nthat are built\nfor serving external validation that is\naddictive yeah\nso i can honestly say that my intention\nfrom the beginning\nhas always been\nto purify myself and help serve the\nworld i've always wanted to solve the\ninner conflict and the inner pain and\nthe inner\nchallenges\nand then help other people do that\non that path i realized\nthat in order to scale\naccelerate and truly\nprovide this message to as many people\nas possible for free\nyou had to figure out how that lived as\na business\nbecause what i do every day requires we\nhave 50 people across the world doing\ndifferent things right now\nand i need each and every one of them to\nhave the impact that we have\nand without each and every one of those\nteam members that play such an important\nand vital role\ni wouldn't be able to do this\nand what i got fascinated by is i grew\nup with the belief that money was the\nroot of all evil i grew up with that i\nalso grew up with the belief that people\nwho had money did\ndodgy things to get there because that's\nthe environment and the family i grew up\nin i had to rewire my whole relationship\nwith money and when i lived as a monk we\nwere trained to recognize that\neverything in the world was simply\nenergy\nand that energy can either be used for\ngood or used for bad\nso all i can say is that i'm honestly\ntrying to give the resources i have to\nbe used\nto serve and support\nnot only myself and my family but to\nserve and support\ntens of people right now on my team that\ni believe are living their purpose and\nfeel very purposeful and meaningful\ncoming to the workplace and then the\nmillions and billions of people that are\nbeing impacted\nand we've always made a commitment if\nyou look at our video content\nit's it's always been free\num\nour podcast has ads but the podcast is\nfree\num we have and we're very selective over\nwho we work with and who we partner with\nand then\nyou know my recent uh partnership with\ncalm where i've taken on the role of\nchief purpose officer\nthe annual subscription is like 42 a\nyear for the whole year and so my goal\nhas always been having lived as a monk\nwhere you do things for free all the\ntime it's like my goal has always been\nthat\nmy goal was to accelerate the impact and\ngive access and ultimately i'd say if\nanyone who does have that perception of\nwhat i'm doing they're fully entitled to\nthat i'm so okay with that i'll take it\nall day\ni have nothing to debate on i i\nappreciate you for how you think about\nthe world and so i let people have their\nopinions and and i have my intentions\nand i hold on to those second part of\nyour question was how do i do that for\nmyself\ni just got back from spending about two\nweeks in india and i was back at the\nashram that i lived at and i go back\nthere every single year i didn't get to\ngo back the two years of the pandemic\nbut every single year since i left and\nnow my wife and i go back every year and\nwe'll be there for like two weeks to\npotentially a month and we'll just\ni'll live like a monk again\nand i love being back in that\nenvironment\nbecause\nthey don't care\nwhat i'm doing\nwhat's been achieved what hasn't been\ndone what the numbers are they just\ndon't care and so i'm constantly around\npeople\nwho demand more of me\nthan what the world does\nand so\none of my teachers i remember him saying\nto me he asked me for an update so i was\ntelling him what i was doing and he said\nsomething that has always stayed with me\nand it really like it was it hit me and\nit almost scared me because it was so\nmuch harder\nhe said jay for all these things that\nyou're doing\ni have no expectations for this in your\nlife\nhe said my only expectation\nis that i simply demand the purity of\nyour heart\nbecause that's all i want\nand that's what that is that's that's a\nmonk mic drop that was among my\nmy mom teaches that to me\nand that's way harder everything else is\nway easier and so\nthat's kind of what keeps me on track is\ni'm constantly surrounded by people who\ndon't live in this environment who don't\nvalue these things who don't care about\nthem who who aren't who who loved me\nbefore during and will love me after\nyou know and and even my wife i think my\nwife gets a lot of credit for that my\nwife doesn't care\num you know she she's just that's not\nher life and it's not who she is and\nbeing married to someone that way i used\nto be upset at my wife for not loving me\nfor what i've achieved\nand then i realized she actually loves\nme for who i am\nand i felt really stupid\nand and i realized that that was so much\nmore special to have someone who's been\nwith me through being broke\nthrough moving country through having\nlost it all to having it all\nto being in between\nand i'd take that history with her any\nday over\nsomeone praising me for what i've done\njay shetty thank you so much for joining\nimposters this has been awesome thank\nyou so much i'm so grateful to you and i\nreally enjoyed my time with you i'm\nexcited
