    "transcript": "we're supposed to work like we don't\nhave children and parent like we don't\nhave a job wow and that can really weigh\non you\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one Health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now I'm really\nlucky in life to have a great group of\nfriends and these friends are just not\ndoing everyday things they're doing\nincredible things and helping other\npeople do that as well now one of these\nfriends is a guest I have on the show\ntoday she has a new book out that I\ncan't wait for you to hear about and she\nhas something exciting as well for you\nto discover when you pre-order the book\nso I wanted to hang around for that as\nwell I'm excited and remember I always\ntalk about how pre-orders really help\nauthors orders really help authors and\nas an author myself I know how much\nhours and time and energy goes into\nwriting a book so when one of my friends\nputs in that energy puts in that effort\nI love to support them with all my heart\nand all my joy and I love that our\ncommunity does the same but today's\nguest is none other than Jennifer you're\nborn and raised in Minnesota wife mother\nand entrepreneur who aims for two things\ndaily helping others wake up to life and\nstaying in comfy pants Creator and host\nof the top rated gold digger podcast\nshe's helped thousands redefine success\nand Chase bold dreams through her\ndecade-long work as a leading online\npersonality and educator welcome to the\nshow Jenna Kutcher and today we're\ntalking about her new book how are you\nreally Jenna thank you for being here oh\nmy gosh Jay this genuinely feels like\nsuch a dream come true I'm getting so\nmany brownie points in my mom's world\nfor being with you today but thank you\nfor having me this is such a Dream well\nno we became friends I think now it's\nlike three years ago I think when we\nwere in Puerto Rico together yeah we're\ngoing to be with your beautiful family\nas well and then we hang out in Napa\nmore recently and I know you and Rodney\nhave been connecting and collaborating\nand so I I was so happy to to do this\nwith you honestly it's it's my greatest\njoy to\nyou know just see friends doing credible\nthings and support them and I think that\nall of us are really looking for that I\nwas saying to my team today that I\nreally love doing what I do but what I'm\nexcited about is having history with\npeople so I love the idea one of my\ngreatest values is when I'm 50 and then\nwhen I'm 75 it's like I want to look\nback and I want someone to look back\nwith and that's why I think friendships\nare so important to me too because when\nyou can look back at 20 30 40 50 years\nwith the same people and say look what\nwe did that's what we did and that's\nwhat we did together right you know I\nreally appreciate that so thank you for\ngiving me this opportunity but you the\ntitle of your book is how are you really\nand I love that you you know very much\nemphasize the importance of that\nquestion and the depth of that question\nbecause I think today we ask how are you\nall the time so I wanted to ask you to\nstart off with then I'll answer the\nquestion too to be honest and vulnerable\nhow are you really today uh In This\nMoment uh and then I'll have a go at\ntelling you how I am really too I can't\nwait you know I I didn't make a mistake\nbut when I named the book that I should\nhave known that every time I talked to\nsomeone now they ask and I'm I'm being\ncalled into honesty which I think is so\nbeautiful and there is such a big\ndifferentiator between like how are you\nand it's like good fine busy but like\nwhen you feel safe especially when\nyou're with someone that you love and\nyou know and they like lean in and\nthey're like but how are you really\nyou're like okay and I've been\ndescribing this season of my life so I\nhave two little ones very little so one\nis three one is a few months old and I\nsaid the season of life I feel stretched\nand I feel stretched in a beautiful way\nbecause I have so much love for being a\nmom but I also have never loved my work\nmore and it just sometimes feels like a\nlot of love to carry and it's like the\nfullness of it is never lost on me and\nso we're in this season of like total\nsleep deprivation at home my toddler\nrecently started sleeping in a big girl\nbed there are probably five times a\nnight where there's a little one on my\nfeet saying mommy mommy and I'm in this\nseason where it's like this energy can\nonly come from something other than\nmyself because I feel so electrically\nenergized and excited about the work I'm\ndoing but also like the life I'm living\noffline so to answer your question it\nall feels heavy and full but in the best\nway possible now how are you really yeah\nI know thank you for that very uh full\nrich and you know textured answer\nI think\none of the things I loved about what you\nsaid and it's it's inspired my response\nas well is you were saying that you're\nin a particular season and I think that\nthat is such a healthy way of thinking\nhow you are\nand I think often we do one of two\nthings we we look at things too minutely\nwhere it's like this is how I am right\nnow and that can feel like a lot of\npressure because I could feel totally\ndifferent within 30 seconds of drinking\nsome water or going on a walk or looking\noutside the window or we some of them\nsay well this is how the year is going\nand and that's sometimes scary as well\nbecause it feels like we can't control\nanything until December 31st and we have\nto wait till Jan first again\nso I love that you use the word season\nand I would say that I'm in a season\nright now and I feel like I'm I'm\nconstantly in this season I'm in a\nseason of like lots of growth lots of\nbeing outside of my comfort zone and I'm\nin a season also of\nI'm actually finishing writing my second\nbook right now so I'm in the process of\ncompleting a creative Journey that takes\neverything out of me\nand I'm about to open up to a new world\nof creativity because I'm now going to\nhave that time and energy back to\ntranslate in another Direction so I feel\nlike I'm at this transition and I find\nthat transitions are always tiring and\nexhausting because you're about to\ncomplete let go and sign off on\nsomething and then you're thinking about\nwhat to do next and and that's always\nlike that little moment of discomfort\nand unease that yeah it comes with that\ntransition so that's how I am really oh\nmy gosh you know it's interesting\nthere's so much that goes into writing a\nbook that I think is surprising and\nuntil you do the journey you don't\nrecognize that and one thing that I\nthink is fascinating that our friend\nBrendan burchard actually told me that I\nthought was so beautiful is that when\nyou're writing a book it really does\nfeel like your life's work right like\nyou pour your heart and your soul and\nyour everything into it and he said\nsomething to me and he said you know\nJenna um this is not your life's work\nthis is an important piece of work in\nyour life and I thought oh that is so\nbeautiful because it's so tempting to\nlike dive head first in and like kind of\ncrawl out of the hole when you finally\nget there so I thought that was such a\ngood reminder for all of us who are\nworking on projects or relationships or\ncareers or whatever that might be or\nyour health of like this isn't your\nlife's work it's just an important piece\nof work in your life yeah wow that\nthat's such a refreshing perspective and\nI I love that little shift in mindset\nthat changes it completely but but let's\ndive in you know both of us get very I\nthink honest answers and and vulnerable\nanswers and\nyou know I I think that it's probably\ntaken us some time to get to be able to\ndo that and you talk about this in your\nbook the idea that\nsome of us actually afraid to answer\nthat question uh and acknowledge the\nproblems and the challenges and the\ndiscomfort that comes with that question\nso we often find it easier to say I'm\nfine it's okay you know the usual the\nsame old but you're actually saying that\nit's healthy to try and acknowledge\naccept and go there why is it critical\nnecessary and integral\nfor us to try and face the real answer\nto that question why is that so\nimportant when I think about the\nquestion how are you really a lot of\ntimes people think about it in context\nof conversation with someone else but\nreally when I think about it it's about\ncoming home to yourself and we live in\nthis culture where it's like we're\nconstantly distracted it's really easy\nfor me as a mom to see it with children\nwhere you're like children don't know\nhow to be bored anymore they don't know\nhow to be creative anymore they're so\nused to being like pacified with screens\nor different things and when I look at\nit through the lens of children I\nsuddenly see oh wait adults are like 10\ntimes worse we are the kind of people\nwho bring our phones to the restroom\nwith us like we skip shavasana at the\nend of a yoga session because we don't\nbelieve we deserve the rest like there\nare so many ways that we avoid getting\nquiet with ourselves and it's really\neasy to do because we are busier than\never right like busy is the badge of\nhonor if you're busy you must be doing\nwell and what I think is really fast\nneeding about that is that we start to\ntune out like The Whispers of like our\nown soul like the Divine pieces of\nourselves that are guiding us so that we\nlisten to the noise of the world and it\ngets really uncomfortable and it gets\nreally hard to discern like what is my\nintuition what is my soul telling me\nwhat is the world telling me and how do\nthese two coexist and I think that in\ntruth you know with the culture that\nwe're in they have to coexist but\nthere's a difference between being the\npassenger on a journey and being in the\ndriver's seat and a lot of times the\nnoise of the world is the driver's seat\nfor us and our intuition might be that\ngarment that hasn't been updated since\n2010 that's telling us like redirect\nredirect redirect and I feel like\nwhenever I talk to people and they're\ngoing through a massive life change\nwhether it's a breakup or a career\nchange or a health change you ask them\nlike did you have that inner knowing\nlike did you have that ping and a lot of\ntimes they'll say yeah I knew something\nwas offer I knew I needed a change or I\nknew I was out of alignment but I didn't\nlisten and so this idea of like how are\nyou really isn't necessarily just about\nin conversation it's about how am I\nreally am I faking that I'm enjoying my\nlife am I putting on a public persona\nfor the World online but offline and\nmiserable am I really yearning for\nsomething different and so it's really\nthis invitation to get quiet with\nyourself and to learn how to invite in\nthat margin in that time and Jay you are\none of the best at helping people get to\nthat place I mean your meditations have\nbeen this constant in my life because\nit's this invitation of getting quiet\nand I I don't know about you but for a\nlong time I've always just told myself\nlike I can't meditate my brain is too\nbusy I operate at a higher level all\nthese things but I had to train myself\nin how to do that just as I had to train\nmyself to run a race or to work as hard\nas I do yeah I love I love what you\nspoke about there and how it's beyond\nthe conversation but the idea of\nlistening to our to our real selves and\nlistening to that voice and you're so\nright I loved what you said about how we\nare constantly feeling or we say things\nlike I wasn't aligned or I wasn't\nlistening then so that means we know\nit's there but we keep trying to put it\noff and it's almost like I it's it's I\nmean this is a a very crude example but\nbut it's just reality\nI was having a bit of pain physically\nrecently\nand it was recurring like it just kept\ncoming up and more often and then my\ntrainer my my uh physical trainer he\nsaid to me he said have you had this\nbefore we were working out or have you\njust had it now and dad got me to think\nabout it and then I started to think\nabout it and I couldn't remember when\nand then this weekend I went to a\ntrampoline park with uh one of my\nclosest friends and their kid like their\nson's like two years old and so we went\nto a trampoline park messing around with\nhim on the trampoline park obviously I\ngot too carried away I felt like I\nstretched something came back again I\nwas like oh no it's definitely triggered\nthrough physical activity realized that\ntwo years ago I felt the same thing\nwhile playing basketball\nand I was like wow I've been feeling\nsomething physically for two years but I\nwaited for it to get really bad and\nhappen more often to listen to it pay\nattention to pay attention and that's\nsomething physical what about something\nemotional and mental and relational and\nPeople based and so I love what you said\nabout the idea of listening and silence\nand Stillness being the best place you\ncan listen how have you learned and I'm\nintrigued by this how have you learned\nas someone who is busy who is a mother\nwho is an entrepreneur who who is a wife\nyou play so many roles you know you're\nwriting a book on top of all of that\nhow have you found what is stillness to\nyou and I'm asking that to you as who\nyou are because I think when people talk\nto me they know I meditate they know I\nhave these practices I I was lucky\nenough to be a monk for three years\nwhere I learned so many practices but as\nsomeone who's in the real world in\nchallenging situations constantly what\ndoes Stillness mean for you and what\ndoes it look like for you yeah there's\nthis chapter in the book called my soul\nshavasana because I used to go to yoga\nand I did it for the workout I like\nmissed the whole point right like it's\ncalled a practice not an art like we're\nsupposed to be practicing it and as an\nachiever and someone who loves to\nachieve I always was the person in the\nclass like comparing myself like did I\nget that bind can I do the headstand and\nat the end of the class it pained me to\nlay on the mat like I told myself like\nyou didn't deserve this you didn't sweat\nhard enough you know all of these things\nand when I look at my life it's so easy\nto delay rest it's like we keep pushing\nthe Finish Line further further and\nfurther I'll rest when I'll rest then\nI'll celebrate when and we like keep\npushing these lines out so that we never\narrive and what I think is fascinating\nis that I've honestly had to learn how\nto rest I've literally had to look at it\nkind of like a couch to 5K but in\nReverse like I'm running the 5K daily\nhow do I get myself back on the couch\nwithout feeling guilty without feeling\nlike I'm lazy or complacent or any of\nthose things because I really think our\nculture has confused contentness with\ncomplacency and if we're content we\nbelieve that like we should be achieving\nmore or we're not using our full\npotential but I think being content is\nthe most beautiful gift you can give\nyourself it means that you're like fully\nin the moment you're fully filled with\ngratitude you're fully present you're in\nlife as it's happening and so for me\ngetting quiet with myself there's this\npart at the end of the book where I joke\nbecause I'm like I love listening to\nlike incredible personal development\npeople who are like you know you wake up\nand you do your morning pages and you do\nyour meditation and you do all these\nthings because I think that's beautiful\nbut in this stage of life I am clinging\nto every second of sleep I can possibly\nget because I'm up in the middle of the\nnight and so I'm like oh my God I would\nlove those things but rest comes in\nthese tiny infinite small moments for me\nand one of the things that I've had to\ndo is that I often feel pulled in many\ndirections so there's this line out\nthere for working mothers because I\nbelieve all mothers are working but\nspecifically women with careers who are\nalso mothers and it's like we're\nsupposed to work like we don't have\nchildren and parent like we don't have a\njob and that can really weigh on you\nlike it can really pull you and so I've\nhad to adopt this practice of when I\ncross the threshold into a room whether\nit's an office my bedroom the house the\nliving room my daughter's room like\nwhatever that is I have to really like\nplant my feet and like actually cross\nthrough with intention to just be here\nnow because my brain could be thinking\nabout an email while I'm reading Dr\nSeuss and my I could be writing an email\nand thinking about nap time or or\nnursing or whatever it is and so I've\nreally had to just invite Stillness in\nreally small segments in my life and\nprioritize that in a meaningful way but\nI really yearn for and look forward to\nthose days where I can have more of that\nand I think that again we look at\nSeasons and if I've learned anything\nspecifically about motherhood It's All\nTemporary it's all fleeting it all goes\nby so fast and so just kind of being\nwhere you are but knowing where you want\nto go that's kind of where I'm sitting\ntoday oh that's beautiful yeah I I\ncouldn't agree more too I I wonder as\nyou were saying that and I'm literally\njust sitting with you and thinking with\nyou and and hearing you out and I'm like\nhow have you made sense gen of your\nidentity of Who You Are\nbecause I you know the book really does\ndive into like who you are\nand and I find like we've we adopt so\nmany titles I I often say to my team I'm\nlike I find it really hard to choose a\ntitle for who I am and what I do I\nreally don't enjoy it and so whenever\nthey ask like oh Jay what do you want us\nto put from your bio onto this thing I'm\nlike I don't like that uh you know human\nbeing being human yeah exactly exactly\nexactly and when someone asks me like\nwho are you and what do you do my answer\nto that is I am someone who's trying to\nhelp people discover their purpose and\nlive up to their potential whatever that\nmay be like that's who I am I'm not an\nauthor or a podcaster or a coach or a\nwhich is all the things I have to say I\nam to make sense\nand then I think about that how many\nthings do we say about ourselves so that\nit makes sense to other people but may\nstop making sense or feeling\nsense like to ourselves so how have you\nmade\nsense of your identity as more titles\nmore expectations more achievements and\nthings come in the mix more\nresponsibilities how do you see yourself\nI'm intrigued by that yeah I love this\nbecause I really struggled so there's\nthis idea of identity foreclosure I\nlearned about it on my podcast there was\nan amazing woman Dr Maya Shanker who\ncame on and yeah\nshe's great she's amazing and she was\ntalking about it and she said something\nthat had just stuck with me and she's\nlike it's the same reason why we hang on\nto genes that don't fit and we complete\ndegrees when we know we don't want to\neven finish them and work in that area\nit's this idea of like well I've already\ncome so far and why would I make that a\nwaste of time or why would I change and\nI have really had to learn how to\nwelcome change into my life because I\nfeel like I am constantly on the\nprecipice of like who I am becoming and\nfor me my career path has been all over\nthe place so I worked in Corporate\nAmerica had a fancy five-word title then\ndecided to pick up a camera my camera\nbecame my vehicle out of that job and\nJay just like you were saying like\nauthor podcast all these things those\nare just the vehicles to get your\nmission out into the world right like\nthey're not necessarily who you are\nthey're just the methods to get the\nmessage and so it's been super\ninteresting to me because I feel like\nI'm constantly changing and evolving and\nto me the mission matters so much more\nthan the method and so for me like being\na mom is like my number one thing it's\nlike my identity marker and I think some\nof it too is because I yearned for it\nfor so long we went through a lot of\nobstacles in starting that and so I\nalways said like if I'm ever fortunate\nenough to have that title I will never\ntake that title for granted because I\nwatched other people get that and it\npained me to see like you don't know the\nmiracle that this is\num but I agree I think that we are\nVisionaries and the way that we do our\nwork is like like the missionaries of\nthe mission and so it's like the methods\nof that and so I always try and I'm from\nthe Midwest so a lot of people aren't\nsuper familiar with the world we're in\nand so try describing a podcast your 93\nyear old grandfather I'm like Grandpa\nit's kind of like a sermon where I talk\nabout business and it's like a radio\nshow but you can listen to it anytime\nand so it's like none of that matters\nmore than the mission and who we are and\nI think who we are offline is more\nimportant than who we are online yeah\nyeah yeah I couldn't agree with you more\nI think the I I always I was saying to a\nfriend yesterday the other day that\nI feel like the stuff that I get to do\nin my private life is even more fun than\nthe stuff I get to do in my public life\nyeah and and most people are unaware of\nthe the private life and and and I get\njoy out of it and and I think there's\nsomething about that that I think is\nimportant to protect\nwhat I what I find fascinating about\nwhat you do though Jenna especially with\nthis book is like you're really trying\ngetting people to bust the myths that\nour generation kind of adopted like\nhustling harder having to have this have\nhave that wake up at this certain time\nand tell me about the times when you did\nHustle Hard\nand because what I find different about\nwhen you say that is you're not someone\nwho didn't know how to hustle hard\nyou're someone who definitely knows how\nto hustle hard and and was successful\nhustling hard but then realized that\nshortcomings which is why I I appreciate\nit from your perspective so when you're\nin that corporate job in America and\nyou're hustling hard can you walk us\nthrough about why the romanticization\nabout hustling hard kind of you know\ndidn't work for you so I want to preface\nthis because I think this is an\nimportant point and I think your\naudience will really resonate with this\nbut I feel like we live in such a\npolarizing time in so many different\nways but part of that polarization is\nthat we feel like we're there's two\ncamps especially for Achievers there is\nthe hustle culture camp and then there's\nthe manifestation Camp the manifestation\ncamp and the hustle Camp they believe\nthat only one of these can exist and so\nwhat's interesting about me and my book\nand my ideology is it's kind of like\nwhere the woo meets the work like where\nthe vision meets the ACT action and it's\nin a sustainable way that keeps you in\nyour life and so I tell this story about\nhow I was in my corporate job and I sat\ndown with my boss and she gives me my\nFive-Year Plan like gives it to me\ndoesn't ask me about it doesn't ask me\nlike what do you want what do you see\nfor yourself like what's next for you\nand it was this wake-up call of like I\nam literally climbing a ladder that\nsomeone else is putting in front of me\nwithout ever checking in is this what I\nwant is this what I envisioned for my\nlife do I want the promotion if it means\nmore responsibility\num and I've had these different seasons\nin my life and I think that everyone\nhits them where they're we look at our\ntime and money but we don't look at our\nenergy and I think energy is everything\nand so there are seasons in my life\nwhere I traded my time in order to make\nmoney and then there are seasons of my\nlife where I have been able to take\nmoney and get back time right things\nlike instacart or Uber or whatever that\nlooks like but a lot of times we forget\nabout like our energy and I don't know\nabout you but like I've arrived at\ncertain places and I've gotten to these\ngoals or these big milestones and I land\nthere and I'm like I thought this would\nfeel different like it looks great but I\nthought it would feel different maybe\nI'm not going hard enough maybe I need\nto do more maybe it's the next thing\nthat'll feel good and I've recognized\nthat that's not the case like I want to\nlive a life that feels better than it\nlooks and so I have had these seasons of\nhustle that have led to burnout but\nafter the burnout for me I always have\nthis breakthrough and the Breakthrough\nis usually that somewhere in the course\nof the pursuit I got off the path and\nnow I've got to redirect or figure out a\nnew map or reassess the direction I'm\nheading and I've pivoted so many times\nin my career and thankfully I've pivoted\nsuccessfully but I've gone from being a\nphotographer to a watercolor artist to a\nspeaker to a podcaster to a course\ncreator all of these different things\nand I believe that people have followed\nme because of my energy not because of\nthe time or the money but like they can\nfeel the heart and they can sense the\nalignment and so I feel like there's\nthis really called to people to pay\nattention to like how are you\nenergetically feeling like I haven't\nslept a full night in three weeks but I\nam so energized and excited because I\nhave never been in alignment better in\nmy work life like I've never felt more\nin alignment and so it's this\ninteresting thing where we focus so much\non time and money and that a lot of\ntimes attributes to the burnout\nattributes to The Hustle but if we check\nin with ourselves and see where our\nenergy is I think that can be the\ncompass that then guides us forward what\nare some of the things that you found\nthat you feel drain your or our energy\nand what are some of the things that\ngive and drive your energy because\nas soon as you talked about the the\nratio of time\nmoney and and energy I I was completely\nwith you I I think those money and time\nare always like the levers that we're\ntrying to play with and the real thing\nthat we're missing out on is is energy\nso I'm completely with you but yeah what\nare the things that drain and drive your\nenergy or you think generally maybe more\nscalably drain and drive all of our\nenergy yeah I feel like if you pull up\nyour calendar and you hate what you see\ncoming up that's a good sign that you're\nout of alignment have you ever looked at\nyour calendar and you're like who booked\nthis and then you're like oh no that was\nme like I said yes to all of these\nthings and I have been in Seasons like\nthat um and really recognized like I am\nnot looking forward to life like I am\ndreading these agreements or I'm over\nextended or I'm stretched too thin and I\nfeel it and a lot of times it's us\nsaying yes and not having boundaries and\nso for me I'm actually quite introverted\na lot of our friends surprisingly are\nwere the people that can stand on his\nstage and talk to thousands of people\nbut if we get into a room with strangers\nwe're like the ones like awkwardly\nstanding in the corner and so really\npaying attention to like what sort of\nboundaries do I need to have in place\nthat protect my energy but allow me to\ndo work that's meaningful and so when\nthe pandemic hit and life shifted I was\nlike I have been training my entire life\nfor this I started my business in a town\nof 1200 I live in small town Minnesota\nI've been trying to convince people that\nso much can be done digitally over the\nyears and all of a sudden I'm like oh I\ncan like open my laptop do my work close\nit and get back to life and so I think\nit takes a really great deal of\nself-awareness because my husband Drew\nyou know him he's an extrovert he could\ntalk to anyone it is his like greatest\ndream to like go to the gym and talk to\nBob while they're walking around the\npath like and figure out his life story\nand to me that kills me like small talk\nkills me and so it's like what is this\nself-awareness on what drains you and\nwhat drives you and how do you try to\npursue this blend of it because I think\nwe're over this idea of balance like if\nyou look at the definition of balance\nit's maintaining a perfect balance of\nsomething and like balance is a moment\nit's not like something that you can\nmaster and so for me it's like what does\nthis blend look like if I say my values\nare being a mom but I'm committing to a\nwork trip that takes me away for two\nweeks am I in alignment with what I say\nis important to me and I think a lot of\npeople right now if they looked at their\ncalendar and they said you know my\nvalues are my health or my family or my\nrelationships or this important work\nthat I'm doing but they looked at their\ncalendar they would see that they might\nhave gotten off course and it's not a\nbad thing it's just an invitation to\ncourse correct so in that example which\nI think was such a great one are you\nsaying that we have to be more\nselective overall priorities in a\nparticular season absolutely if you are\nable to and honestly Jay and I think\nit's important to note like it's a\nprivilege to be able to say yes and no\nto Opportunities right some people don't\nhave that invitation to just say you\nknow I'm not gonna agree to that if\nthat's something that's going to pay the\nbills but at the same point in time one\nthing that I've been doing a lot lately\nis if I get an invitation when I'm in\nperson with someone because I just like\nlove people's energy and I'm so prone to\nsay yes I'm like the kind Midwest girl\nI've been saying let me check my\ncalendar and get back to you on that\nbecause a lot of times when I over\ncommit on things energetically in the\nmoment it feels right but then when I\nlook at it a week from now a month from\nnow I'm like oh shoot like I shouldn't\nhave committed to this so there are\nboundaries that I think can be really\nimportant that can buy yourself the time\nto really assess is this the right\nopportunity is it shiny is it going to\nguide me forward is it going to serve\nothers is this a clear yes us or no and\nI always think it's either like a hell\nyes or a heck no and you've got to pick\nmore of the hell yeses in your life how\nhave you learned to say no recently to\npeople who you deeply love and people\nyou know care for you and and then you\nstill want to say no for your values\nlike have you have you had to do that\nrecently like how have you I'm so good\nhow have you been yeah okay tell us walk\nus through that a little bit because I\nthink yeah I I had to do it the other\nday I had someone reach out and they're\nlike yeah I need you to do this thing\nand I I send them my response but I want\nto hear yours and then and then all that\nto it but yeah tell tell me how you deal\nwith that I'm intrigued so boundaries\nare something that I think people are\nafraid of because when you think about\nboundaries you think about like keeping\nsomething or someone out right like you\nalmost picture up like a fence around\nand that feels scary but I have found\nthat boundaries keep us in our life like\nthe life that we're meant to be leaving\nand when we have good boundaries it\nreally invites us to like be awake to\nthe life that we say we want so for\nexample when I was pregnant with my\nfirst daughter Coco I blacked out the\nentire year following her birth I had\nnot a single commitment on my calendar\nfor an entire year now was that scary\nabsolutely did I fear that I would lose\nmomentum yes did I wonder would I become\nIrrelevant in that year of course but I\nsaid that being a mother was the\ngreatest gift the biggest miracle that I\ncould ever invite into my life and you\nbetter believe I was going to live that\nway and I just didn't know what to\nexpect I didn't know if I would Thrive\nif I would be flailing like I didn't\nknow and I wanted to give myself space\nand time to adjust to that new life and\nthat new version of who I was and so I\nput up bumpers like I think about\nbowling and I think about boundaries as\nlike bumpers that keep us in the lane\nthat keep us aligned and from falling in\nthe gutter and so I told my team I said\nif any inquiries come in I don't care\nwho it is I want for you to just send\nthis polite decline to them I don't want\nto hear about it because I'm going to\nwant to say yes I don't want to see it\nbecause it's gonna make me antsy that I\nshould do it and I just want you to send\nthis out and if it's the right thing I\ntruly believe it will come back in the\nright timing I believe that that will\nhappen and so I also have a note on my\nphone that I use often and it's when I\nget an invitation that's wonderful or\nfrom somebody I love and all it says is\noh my goodness like thank you so much\nfor considering me for this opportunity\nI'm so flattered and I'm so excited for\nyou right now I have to politely Decline\nand I want for you to know that this in\nme declining it is not a reflection of\nyou or your opportunity or the work that\nyou're doing it is solely a reflection\nof the values that I'm living and me\nsaying yes to you right now means that\nI'm gonna have to say no to what is most\nimportant to me and right now that is my\nfamily I truly hope you understand I\ncan't wait to work with you in the\nfuture I'm cheering you on as you go\nwishing you the best and I also include\na caveat that says I hope that in me\ndoing this it is an invitation for you\nto lean in and live out the values in\nyour life as well wow what a message\nthat's amazing that's that's such a\nbeautiful I haven't memorized because I\nneed it off I know I was like wow that\nis that's like a deep genuine word for\nwhat message I I love that I I mean even\njust the the depth of that message is is\nso powerful and I just want to take a\nmoment everyone is listening or watching\njust to acknowledge that that often you\ncan have a message that says hey thank\nyou so much I'm grateful but can't do\nthis right now I hope you understand and\nthat's great but the depth of that\nmessage to even remind someone to follow\ntheir own values to to explain what your\nvalue is right now I think so much is\nlost in not communicating our values and\nour priorities and I don't think that we\nneed to create a world where we can more\neasily explain our priorities and our\nvalues without feeling uncomfortable\nabout them and I think often people\nthink they need to lie or make something\nup or construct I'm busy right I'm busy\nlike yeah and and it's like when when\nsomeone gets that message not only do\nthey not understand you actually haven't\nhelped them understand\nwhat they need to learn for themselves\nas well and so yeah I went through it\nrecently I sent a similar message uh\nwhere I was really explaining that I was\nlike you know this is why I struggle\nwith this and I was even explaining my\nstruggle and how hard it is for me to\nsay no but how I know that if I say yes\nI'm actually Gonna Let You Down even\nmore later and and I just wanted to make\nyou aware of that and yes I did tell my\nlife story a little bit but it was the\nsame point that I was like I need to\nreally explain the context behind this\nmessage and this no and I think what\nthat ends up doing is it actually\ncreates really beautiful opportunities\nand I'll always say to someone I'll say\nI'm sure you can understand it I'd love\nto know if you do and 99 of the time\nsomeone will come back and say of course\nI understand it I protect my time in the\nsame way or whatever it may be and and\nthen you go oh okay we actually are more\naligned than we think so I I love that\nadvice it's so great uh Jenna what so\nyou know the books in three parts the\nfirst part is who you are yes and and\nthat's what we've been talking about I\nwould highly recommend that everyone\ndives into it because the book talks\nabout everything from uh Jenna's\nchildhood to you know her feelings about\nmotherhood and I I am not asking her to\nrepeat what's in the book I would love\nyou to go and read the book uh and dive\ninto it and then helps you figure out\nwho you are and and how to be clear\nabout your values and priorities which\nwe're realizing are so integral to know\nand as we know if we don't know our\nvalues and priorities we will be living\nbased on someone else's or an adopted\nsense of values and priorities but in\nthe second part of the book you talk\nabout who has you and who you have right\nand and this I think I gravitated\ntowards this a lot\nbecause\nI think sometimes we if we have good\nnetworks and communities\nand families and units we often take it\nfor granted because we assume that's\njust how life is\nso can you talk to me a bit about how\nyou've constructed\nhealthy community\nand support systems around you and given\nyourselves the permission to lean on\nothers because I find like that's what\nmost of us don't want to do is we don't\nwant to depend on others and make people\nfeel we're dependent on them so the\nsecond part is that who you have and who\nhas you because I recognize that like we\nare in this season of life and in this\narea of like the world where we have\nnever been more connected but we also\ndon't feel fully known and I think there\nis nothing worse than being in a room\nfilled with people and feeling lonely\nlike loneliness isn't just the act of\nbeing alone it's feeling like people\ndon't know the real you and I feel like\nwe're in this world where that is so\ncommon it's like have you ever entered a\nbuilding and you know that if you just\nexit stage life left like no one would\nquestion who you were where you were if\nyou were even there and I feel like\nwe're kind of walking through life in\nthat way and we're also in this era\nwhere people post you know bachelorette\nparties and there's like 20 people in\nmatch swimsuits and you're like I have\nlike three close friends and like is\nsomething wrong with me or like why\ndon't I have this like Village around me\nand a lot of it is because we aren't\nshowing up allowing ourselves to fully\nknow others and to be fully known and I\nthink that the pandemic actually gave us\nthis really unique invitation because\nfor so long we were able to separate\nlike career Jenna and Mom Jenna and\nmarriage Jenna and friend Jenna and all\nof a sudden we're doing everything under\none roof and we're forced to communicate\nin different ways and we're forced to\nlearn how to be a good friend from afar\nand we're forced to be reminded that\nlike we need to reach out just as much\nas we hope people reach out to us and\nwhat's interesting is I've had this\npractice for I don't know probably 10\nyears where every single day when I\nthink of people I text them and it'll\njust be I know I've sent you a few I've\nsent your wife a few like where if you\ncome into my life or my mind or I see\nsomething and I'm like oh Dave would\nlove that or whatever that is to just\nreach out like the universe is guiding\nme towards this opportunity to encourage\nor check in or just be there for someone\nand oftentimes it comes in the form of\nlike no need to respond just want you to\nknow I'm thinking of you or I saw this\nthing like if you want to share how\nyou're doing like just check in\num but when I think about when we're\nreally feeling lonely a lot of times our\nAct is to like close up and to like\nclose ourselves off and I really think\nit's this really uh great opportunity\nfor us to reach out and to seek and when\nyou bring up like help there's this\nchapter where it's like when one plus\none equals a million and it's my story\nabout how I like was white knuckling so\nmuch of my life I think a lot of us do\nthat where we wear all the hats we can\ndo it we're just getting by we're\nholding on with all of our might to like\nkeep the control and life often gives us\nthese opportunities or it forces us to\nopen up our hands and for me when we\nwent through two pregnancy losses I was\nin this place where I was like I have to\nshow up to work I had to show up and\nshoot a wedding as a wedding\nphotographer after getting this news and\nI recognize like I cannot do this\nanymore like I cannot I've built\nsomething that requires me to show up to\nget paid and right now I can't show up\nand I can't keep doing this to myself\nbecause life is not always going to\ninvite us to show up sometimes life\ncalls us to like slow down and to be and\nto sit and I had run my business by\nmyself for years and years and years and\nI finally got to a place where I said\nthree words I need help and it\ntransformed everything for me and it's\nbeen really fascinating being in this\nseason of motherhood and launching a\nbook and all of these different things\nwhere I'm like usually I'm the helper\nand so asking for help is so\nuncomfortable but it stretches you in\nways that allows you to invite people in\nand one of my friends Ali stroker she is\nin a wheelchair she's an incredible\nactress and she once told me this story\nthat totally changed the way I look at\nasking for help and she said a lot of\ntimes people will come and try with good\nintentions to help me in my wheelchair\nwhen really I don't need it but I've\nlearned to recognize that for some\npeople being the helper is the greatest\ngift I can give them and when she said\nthat it really made me pause and think\nthere are so many people in my life who\nlove to help who find joy in being the\nhelper and if I can give them the\ninvitation or the opportunity to do that\nsuddenly who I have and who has me\nexpands and a lot of times it's like our\npride it's like Pride's utter Chokehold\nthat like keeps us from like opening our\nhands to what's possible and so it's\nthat white knuckling that is not\nsomething that you can maintain and it's\nsomething that really keeps greatness\nout of your life yeah and and Jenna you\ntouched on it there it was you know I\nreally admired your bravery for doing it\nin the book as well you you talk about\nthe time where you find out that you're\nyou know your baby didn't have a\nheartbeat and and I feel like\nyou know that the book is is full of\nthat level of vulnerability and I think\nyou talk about a lot of things that we\nalso don't ever talk about\nuh and and definitely obviously people\nthat we don't announce on Instagram and\nthat potentially is in the right Forum\nanyway but\nI wanted to ask you about\nwhen you look at that Community around\nyou\none of the things that's really\nbenefited me\nI said this to someone the other day\nthey were like oh you it seems like you\nmake some really good decisions in your\nlife and I said yeah because I had\npeople in my life who told me all the\nbad decisions they made yeah and I'd say\nall the good decisions I've made in my\nlife is because I've had a few older\npeople in my life who've told me about\nall their bad decisions and that gave me\nso much hindsight and it gave me so much\nawareness that it allowed me the space\nto think about things a bit ahead of the\ntime and so I can't take any credit for\nthe good decisions I've made I can only\ntake\nI can only give the credit to the people\nwho shared their either poor decisions\nwith me or as in your case you're doing\nthis book challenges or heartbreaks that\nthey went through in order to be\nhopefully more prepared or or more\nequipped to to deal with certain things\nand so I was like the best mentorship is\nactually not good advice the best\nmentorship is just an honest experience\nof what someone's going through can you\ntalk to me a bit about like how you've\nshared and how people have shared with\nyou and how that's such an important\npart of building that community and\nyou're doing it through the book of\ncourse there are so many things that are\ntaboo which is crazy where it's like so\nmany people are experiencing it and it's\na part of the human experience but\nnobody's talking about it and it is so\nisolating right like you feel like you\nare broken or you are the only one or\nit's your fault that you went through\nsomething\nand years ago we lost one of our best\nfriends in a car accident and I found\nmyself going back to his social media\nfeeds to feel connected to him and he\ndidn't know when he was talking about\nTaco Bell or posting that funny Family\nGuy meme that like that would be a part\nof his legacy right like we don't think\nabout that but every single post we're\nhitting publish on online is a piece of\nour Legacy like we don't do what our\nparents did and have scrapbooks and all\nthe little you know Trinkets and put it\nin an album these days it's so digital\nand I remember when I found myself like\ngoing to look through his old tweets or\nthings just to feel connected to him I\nvowed to myself that like what you see\nonline will never be just a highlight\nreel it will always be real like r-e-a-l\nmy real life and I have stuck by that\nthrough thick and thin through the good\nthrough the bad because when I get\nreminded of a memory on Facebook I want\nto remember that actual moment and not\njust the shiny and when we went through\nour pregnancy loss for me part of it was\nhelping people to feel less alone\nbecause one in four people women\nexperience that but two it was to give\nmeaning to the experience I think as\npeople that are optimistic or positive\npeople where I was like life is teaching\nme a lesson and even when that lesson is\ninconceivable or you don't have a reason\nor you can't really pinpoint what that\nis I really clung to this belief that\nlike I'm going to give meaning to this\nmess no matter how I can and there's\nthis story in the book that I love\num and it's called what Brook Shields\ndoesn't know and I was at this event\nwith all these incredible women and\nthere was this President of a company\nthat I worked with and she was a woman\nand she came up to me and we were\ntalking about her children and she said\ndo you know that I went through IVF\nseven times in order to have my daughter\nand this is like years ago like a decade\nago and I said oh my God how many times\ndid you want to give up and she said\nnever and I said how is that possible\nlike IVF is the most excruciating\nprocess like there are so many layers to\nit and so many things and so many hopes\nand dreams and failures and things that\nyou just like hate going through and she\nsaid I didn't give up because one time I\nwas watching an interview and Brooke\nShields said that she did IVF seven\ntimes to conceive her daughter and if\nshe can do it seven times so can I\nand I think about like that Brooke\nShields doesn't know that she's\nresponsible for this beautiful girl\nnamed Maggie who lives in New York City\nbut her vulnerability in sharing that\nstory inspired a total stranger to get\nherself in the ring of something that\nwas told to be impossible by doctors but\ncreated a miracle and I think that\nstories have this opportunity to do this\nand I think that vulnerable stories\ninvite people to again step into their\nown vulnerability and I've learned so\nmuch about like the things that I try to\nkeep hidden the things that I'm afraid\nto share the things that I'm thinking\nthat everyone else is thinking about me\nthose are called The Human Experience\nthose are the things that connect me so\nmuch more than pretending like I have it\nall together I don't have insecurities\nor that I don't worry and so I've just\nbelieved in the power of story and the\npower of real and when you put real\nstory to life that's what really\ntransforms other people's lives yeah and\nI definitely think you do that in this\nbook so so wonderfully right like this\nthere's so many stories whether it's\npersonal whether it's career based you\nknow I think it's so important one of\nthe things I try to do and think like a\nmonk when I wrote it was I don't talk\nabout any enlightened experiences so I\ntalked about all my worst meditation\nexperiences yeah because the goal was\ninflatable because it's relatable and\nit's true like there were just so many\npoor meditation experiences and I think\nit's very easy to be like well you know\nthis was this amazing experience I had\nand everyone's like well you know like\nlike you just said like someone's gone\nthrough seven of the most difficult\nexcruciating things to get there but\nthat story is so much more powerful tell\nme a bit about you know the third Act of\nthe book goes into like people setting\ntheir goals living their truth achieving\nit making a plan I want to ask you a\ndifferent question because the book\nbreaks down how you do that and what to\ndo so so if anyone who's wondering how\nJenna goes from who you are to who you\nhave and who has you to then what you're\ngoing to do about it to actually build\nit through what I'm more intrigued by is\nwhat's a worthy goal like what's a\nworthy Pursuit because I feel like\neveryone talks about goals and goal\nsetting and everyone kind of has goals\nor may have goals but\nwhen I was young\nall we ever learned about was setting\nsmart goals right specific measurable\nachievable realistic and time-bound but\nno one ever told me what a worthy goal\nwas and as I've got an older I have I do\nbelieve that there are worthy Pursuits\nand there are Pursuits that will let us\ndown as you said there's so many goals\nthat you hit and you go well is that it\nso so how do you help people think about\nis there a way of knowing what a healthy\nworthy pursuit or goal is yeah I think\nit's one that feels good that the\npursuit feels good and the end product\nfeels right\nand for me I think it's really\ninteresting I remember Jay we were\ntogether in Puerto Rico and Brendan\nthrew Brendan burchard led us through\nthis exercise and it was envisioning\nthese scenes that we want for our lives\nlike what would true success look like\nand he had already gone through the\nexercise of like envisioning your best\nmoments of Life all these things but I\nloved how he framed it because it was\nlike Envision these moments before they\nhappened so that when they happen you\nare fully awake to them and for me the\nscene that I envisioned was like\npancakes on a Saturday morning looking\nout at the lake with my family and it's\nfunny because every time we make\npancakes on a Saturday morning Drew will\nlook at me and I will be like teary-eyed\nand he'll be like we're living it like\nthis is the scene and we're awake to it\nbecause how many successful people do\nyou know who have done all these amazing\nthings in their life they say they\nmissed it they missed it because they\nwere just in pursuit of the next thing\nor the journey didn't feel good or they\narrived and it wasn't where they thought\nthey wanted to be and so when it comes\nto setting a goal I want you to ask\nyourself what feels good like what in\nthe pursuit feels good and here's an\nexample I did this visualization\nexercise after our two losses I was like\nunpacking my grief and really trying to\nlike face it because I had buried it the\nfirst time and I was like I've got to\nfigure out how to not move on from this\nbut how to move with my grief like how\ndo I move forward carrying this grief\nwith me as a changed person and I did\nthis visualization exercise and my\nfriend was leading me through it and she\nwas like Envision the most vibrant\nversion of yourself like you are fully\nAlive energized excited about what\nyou're about to do for your day and she\nsaid this line where it was like put\nyour fingers in the finger slots like\nstep into where your toes are like what\ndo you see and what do you feel and it\nwas funny because I was doing this\nmeditation there are tears streaming\ndown my face and I'm envisioning this\nlittle girl in pancakes and Drew and\nthis Persian rug and like all of these\nthings and in this Vision I had on jeans\nin a white linen shirt and I opened my\neyes after the visualization and I had\non yoga pants and like an old college\nt-shirt and I was like I want the baby\nin the pancakes but if I can't even live\ntoday with the jeans and the linen shirt\nhow do I expect to become a fully\ndifferent person when the thing that I\nwant arrives right like sometimes the\nwaiting season is just as important as\nwhat it is that we're waiting for and\nthe same thing goes for goals sometimes\nthe Journey of working towards the goals\nshould be enjoyed just as much as she\nachieving the goal itself and so I've\nlearned how to make sure that the\npursuit feels good but that the goal is\ntruly my definition of success because\nmy definition of success isn't shiny\nit's not great it's literally a bag of\ngluten-free pancakes but when I'm living\nit I know it and I'm awake to it and I\nthink nowadays it's like with the\ninternet you could follow the fashion\nblogger and then follow the home decor\nand then follow the health nut and our\nbrain tricks us into thinking that we\nneed to do and be all of those things in\norder to be happy but if we go back to\nthe beginning of the conversation where\nwe talk about like contentedness is a\ngift it's not complacency like how can\nyou be at peace with your life and what\ndoes that look like as you work towards\nthe goal and so for me it's like more so\nabout the journey because if we know\nanything the journey is ninety percent\nof the pursuit and the actual goal\nachieving is two percent and so I want\nmy life to feel good while I'm working\ntowards that thing yeah I think that's a\ngreat definition and I'm really glad you\nclarified that because I think we often\nbeen set goals by default we adopt goals\nfrom our parents our friends our family\nInstagram Tick Tock social media we we\njust we have a goal without even knowing\nwe have one and so\nI think making it a more conscious\nintentional process is so important and\nI encourage everyone who wants to live\ntheir truth who wants to authentically\ndiscover who they are who wants to make\na shift or a change in your life right\nnow maybe you're going through a\ntransition maybe you know you need to\nstart one please order Jenna's book\ntoday because it will truly guide you\nand be that helping hand that we all\nneed on that path and sometimes I think\na lot of people and I can honestly say\nthis for myself and that's I I truly\nback what I'm about to say is that I\noften felt alone in my transitions in\nlife from a physical point of view but I\nwould say that books and people in books\nhave definitely been that navigation\nguide and helping hand that I've needed\nand so often I haven't necessarily been\nable to turn to someone right next to me\nto know what's going on because they may\nnot have experienced what I'm\nexperiencing but someone in a book has\nexperienced that explain something\nsimilar and that I feel now so close to\nthat person that I've never met and most\nof the people I'm talking about are not\neven alive from books that I've read so\nI really believe that that if you're in\nthat transition if you're in that\nJourney if you're struggling with who\nyou are if you're trying to figure out\nthe people around you if you're trying\nto make a career change if you're having\nyou know struggles with motherhood and\nthat journey and your identity right now\nJenna really I want to be honest like\nvery vulnerably and honestly captures\nher story and and shares
