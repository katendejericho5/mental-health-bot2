it's\nsuch an honor to be here you make\neverything sound so much better as well\nbut you you had to live it so\nyou know it's it's been amazing but i i\nmean it we've been messaging we've been\nwanting to get together we're we're\nfinally here and i was just saying to\nyou offline that\nmy physical health journey has been very\ninteresting because\ni almost ignored it for a long time\nbecause i was so focused on the mind and\nthe soul and the heart\nand my wife was my educator and my coach\nwhen it came to my physical health and\nso whenever i'm sitting with someone who\ndeeply understands food and nutrition\ni'm very fascinated in open book because\ni know there's something i can improve\nabout my health whether it's through my\ngut or my brain but i want to start with\na bit about you\nand you know when you were younger you\nwere diagnosed\nand i won't give it away you can share\nabout it but you were diagnosed and told\nthat there might not be a way of fixing\nor solving something now\ni can't imagine what that feels like\nhearing that when you're younger and i'm\nguessing at that time you didn't have\nthe skills you have today\nso can you take us back to that moment\nand just explain to us\nwhat you went through and how that\nsparked your journey yeah absolutely\nyeah so we're a product of our\nenvironment but we're also creators of\nour environment once we become aware of\nit and so i was just replicating what i\nwas seeing around me which was a lot of\ndysfunction which was a lot of ill\nhealth and i kind of was like the one in\nmy family that had the potential to make\nit and what it was was in the\nenvironment that i was in the inner city\nand being in poverty which even say that\nkind of with the parentheses here in the\nunited states poverty is very different\nyou still probably have a tv a car you\nknow when much of the world is living on\na couple dollars a day but you know we\nwere struggling to get by in this\nenvironment all i saw was the\nopportunity for me to you know go to\ncollege which i never met anybody that\nwent to college let alone graduated\nexcept my teachers was through athletics\nand so i did really well in school but i\njust saw sports was going to be my way\nto get a scholarship\nand when i was 15 years old i ran a 4540\nwhich is like nfl combine caliber you\nknow and i was doing really great in\ntrack as well\nbut fate had other plans for me it was\nactually at track practice when i had\nthe first glimpse of what was to come\nand so i was doing a 200 meter time\ntrial which 200 meters is half the track\nand the time trial was just me and my\ncoach\nand i took off and i was coming around\nthe curve of the track into the\nstraightaway\nand my hip broke\nand i didn't realize it at the time\nbecause i just kind of came up limping i\nthought maybe i pulled a muscle i'd\nnever really been injured before\nbut it took a couple of days and i went\nand got a scan done because i just\ncouldn't turn my legs over i went to see\na pt and a physician and they put the\nscan up the x-ray and it's just my iliac\ncrest bone was just floating off in\nspace like oh that's the problem right\nthere\nand\nwhat i went through was something called\nstandard of care all right standard of\ncare which is\nnot really looking at what is the cause\nof this thing but let's treat these\nsymptoms right so i got some nsaids some\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatories i got\nsome crutches which was cool i got to\nget out of class early and take the\nschool elevator\nbut nobody stopped to ask how did a kid\nbreak his hip from running\nand fast forward i experienced almost a\ndozen more injuries the next two years i\njust couldn't stay on the football field\nor on the track and my body was just\nbreaking down and so my vision of\nplaying at the next level was just\nvanquished fortunately academically i\ngot a bunch of scholarships i got to go\nto school that i wanted to go to i was\ngoing to walk on and red shirt and\nfootball\nbut this is where i get that diagnosis\nso i was 20 years old and i was\ndiagnosed with something called\ndegenerative disc disease and\ndegenerative bone disease so basically\nare an advanced arthritic condition on\nmy spine and this is usually reserved\nfor people who are much older and so i\nwas 19 20 years old the reason that i\nwent into the doctor was i just couldn't\ni couldn't extend my leg i was always in\na lot of pain and whenever i would stand\nup i'd get this like\nthor lightning bolt shooting down my leg\nand it was just miserable\nand\nif you can imagine this\nwhen you're in pain when you stand up\nhow about you just don't stand up right\nso i was doing everything i could to\navoid standing up and so i sat a lot i\nwas constantly laying down or playing\nvideo games i was in college still\nand it just got progressively worse\nbecause your body really works on this\nuse it or lose it basis so not only was\nmy spine deteriorating the rest of me\nwas atrophying as well\nand so to really put the icing on the\ncake of the story when i went in to see\nmy physician and he gave me this\ndiagnosis he looked me right in my eyes\nand he told me that this situation was\nincurable right because for me being an\nathlete i was just like all right what\ndo we do to fix this\nand he put his hand on my shoulders like\ni'm sorry son this is something that\njust happens and i'm sorry it happened\nto you\nand that\ntoday i realized that goes against basic\nlaws of physics like there's nothing\nthat just happens you know there's a\ncause and effect\nand i didn't\nit didn't register to me when he first\nsaid it it just didn't it didn't make\nsense so i rejected it and i asked him\nthis specific question jay and i have no\ngrounds for asking him this question but\ni asked him does this have anything to\ndo with what i'm eating\nshould i change the way that i'm\nexercising\nand he looked at me like i was from\nanother planet he was like this has\nnothing to do with what you're eating\nthis is something that just happens\nand\na little sidebar and i didn't talk about\nthis for many years but you know my\nphysician he was over he was obese and\nhe was clearly struggling with his own\nhealth not to say that he wasn't\nqualified to give me advice but he was\nclearly struggling himself\nand but i took his advice because he was\nthe expert\nand him saying that this was my lot in\nlife\nwhat he invoked was something called a\nnocebo effect which we can come back and\ntalk about in a moment\nbut the bottom line was\nhe said that this has nothing to do with\nwhat i'm eating but he wrote me a\nprescription to eat some pills\nright this has nothing to do with what\nyou're putting in your mouth go ahead\nand put these in your mouth right\nand so that was the level of thinking\nthat i was dealing with fast for the\nstory after leaving there\ni went from a nuisance of a pain to\nchronic debilitating pain right because\nnow i know that i have this thing this\nis my identity i'm this sick person i'm\ngonna be in pain for the rest of my life\nhe told me that\nand so for the next two years i did as\nlittle as i possibly could and he told\nme he gave me permission that's the big\nthing people don't realize if you if\nyou've been struggling your whole life\nand somebody gives you permission to\nstop struggling\njust nobody's going to blame you you got\nthis bad thing that happened\njust take this free pass this hall pass\nand just ride it out\nit took two years\nwhich you know some people never get it\nand some people get it a little bit\nfaster but it took me two years and over\nthese two years eating what i call the\ntough diet typical university food\ni was continuing the same behaviors and\ni gained a bunch of weight now because\nnot not only was i eating the same\nthings but now i'm inactive\nand so i became much\nfluffier i'll lovingly say version of\nmyself and i didn't recognize the person\ni saw in the mirror\nand that was one of those breaking\nmoments for me it's just like i didn't\neven recognize who i was\nand after those two years\nit's usually an event or\nor a person or something that becomes a\ncatalyst for that change and for me it\nwas my grandmother you know and she was\nalways checking on me those two years\nand if you're a young kid just like i'm\nfine grandma you know but i wasn't fine\nand she knew it she was the one who\nreally advocated for me she's the one\nwho believed in me more than anybody\nthat i was going to do something great\nand here i was living in ferguson\nmissouri in his one bedroom apartment\nsleeping on the mattress on the floor\noverweight in chronic pain can't sleep\nat night\nand my life didn't match up to my\nblueprint of what success was gonna look\nlike\nand so it was in that moment\nthat i decided to get well and most\npeople don't really get that j it's just\nlike it sounds so simple right but the\nreality is oftentimes we don't decide\nit's more like we'll see what happens\nit's like wishful thinking\nit's like you know i i wish you know\nthis would happen but when you decide\nsomething you really cut away the\npossibility of that of anything else but\nthat thing and even the word if you\nbreak it down\nday meaning from and kaideer which means\nto cut right so you cut away the\npossibility of anything else but that\nthing and i decided to get well and so\nthe last little part we could talk about\nhow i did this but\nit was from six weeks from that moment\nof decision and i had lost about 18\npounds which is not typical but i was\nalways kind of the skinny kid in my\nfamily so my fat jeans definitely kicked\non but you know the weight just came off\nof me once i started to implore a few\nreally foundational principles you know\nwith my nutrition with movement\nand the pain i've been experiencing that\nhad me in terror for two years was gone\nand it was about nine months later when\ni got a scan done and i completely\nreversed the degeneration\nmy two herniated discs had retracted on\ntheir own my bone density was normal and\nit was as if the thing had never\nhappened\nso and by that experience happening to\nme\nand seeing the stories of people coming\nup to me at my university asking me to\nhelp them because they saw the change\nyou know i didn't look like a guy who\nlost weight i look like somebody who's\nreally healthy\nand to hear their stories like people\nsaying telling them you're going to live\nwith this disease forever diabetes or\nyou know heart disease you know you're\ngoing to be on the statin whatever the\ncase might be and i had this experience\nwhere i was told\nthis negative thing was going to be your\nstory and to no longer have that as my\nstory i had this level of authority that\ni couldn't really put a finger on and\npeople were attracted to that so my life\njust went from being very self-centered\nin my pain to being other centered and\nbeing of service and i found every way\nthat i could to help others and it\nlanded me here with you\nthat's beautiful man thank you for\ni know how hard it is to synthesize\na life's work\nin a few minutes\nand of course i'm hoping that everyone\nwho's listening and watching is going to\nget better acquainted with you if\nthey're not already listeners\nbut\ni'm intrigued by\nwhen you made that decision\nwhat was the first thing you did because\ni often find that\nfirst of all it's hard to make the\ndecision\nbut when you've made the decision\nthen the first thing you do has such a\nbig impact on momentum and acceleration\nwhat was the first thing you did that's\nso powerful jay because the the decision\nis instantaneous but what takes long is\ngetting ourselves to the place where we\nmake the decision right and so the first\ndecision that i made\nwhich i didn't realize this consciously\ntill years later is i changed the\nhabitual question that i was asking\nand today i know that there's this\nreally phenomenal process the brain\nevokes called instinctual elaboration\nthe human brain is always trying to\nanswer questions that we pose it it's\njust automatic our mutual friend jim\nquick we've talked about this many times\nand the question that i was asking was\nunconscious all the time was why me why\nis this happening to me why won't\nsomebody help me\nand so my brain is\nconstantly scanning my internal and\nexternal environment to affirm why me\nwhy i'm unhelpable why i'm not\ndeserving of being healthy\nright so i'm just getting all this data\nin as to why my life sucks\nbecause i'm looking for it\nand so in that moment of decision\nand again i wasn't aware i wasn't\nconsciously aware of this but i just\nasked this question very simple as\ninstead of asking why me i asked what\ncan i do to feel better because i just\nsaw\na series of other doctors which i highly\nencourage people to if you get a bad\nbill of goods like that get a second\nthird opinion before taking any drastic\naction\nbecause i was just talking with tony\nrobbins about this recently but there\nwas a big meta-analysis done by the mayo\nclinic and they found that when you get\nthat initial diagnosis it's only the\nsame\nless than less than 20 percent of the\ntime\nis the second diagnosis the same as the\nfirst diagnosis and often it's radically\ndifferent all right so it's somewhere in\nthe ballpark of like 18 of the time it's\nthe same\nso that being said you also want to seek\ncounsel from somebody who's not in the\nsame line of thinking as well you know\nsomebody ideally who has the same goal\nas you like if you're diagnosed with\nthis thing and you don't want to have\nthis thing\nmaybe that's the person you need to go\nand talk to but i was seeking counsel\nfrom the same type of thinker\ni asked this question what is it that i\ncan do\nto feel better what is it that i can do\nand this was kind of an audacious thing\nto be healthier than i've ever been\nthat night was the first night that i\nslept through the night without\nmedication in those two years i just\nfelt this peace you know and i woke up\nand the this is the thing too it's not\nlike again like a unicorn came out and\nlike the clouds parted and you know it's\nhappily ever after i put a plan together\nand that plan entailed three specific\nthings\nthe first thing was changing my\nnutrition i knew just on a very\nrudimentary level that\ni needed to quote lose weight right\nbecause i was just like logically if i'm\nhaving this pressure on my disc let me\ntake some of this pressure off by losing\nsome of this mass that i'm carrying\nbut i'll be honest with you jay the\nfirst thing that i did was slim fast\nright so because of marketing like i saw\nthe tv that's what i was acclimated to\nso it's like a shake for breakfast and\nshake for lunch a sensible dinner right\nand it was disgusting all right it was\nit was terrible it only worked for a\ncouple of days i did it\nbut by me asking the questions the right\npeople the right situations the right\nbooks start to show up and oftentimes\nthose things have been there the whole\ntime but i just wasn't attuned to them\nand i had a friend of mine that i had\nknown her for years and she was in\nchiropractic college and we just like\nkicked it you know but and i just\nthought she was weird you know with her\nand her friends you know and she took me\nto wild oats right which has since been\nbrought up by whole foods and so now i'm\nin this environment where i'm seeing\nall these different supplements and\nfoods and there's like grass inside i'm\nlike why is there grass inside you know\nit's wheatgrass\nbut there was a book there\na nutrition prescription and it had all\nthese peer-reviewed and i was in college\nso i'm i'm versed in research\nespecially doing what i was doing in\ncollege\nand there was peer-reviewed data on\nregenerating herniations and\ndegenerative disc disease and there are\nall these nutrients\nthat i had never even heard of like all\ni knew about for bone density for\nexample was calcium because of marketing\nthere was like\nomega-3s\nsulfur-bearing amino acids silica all\nthese other things that i wasn't getting\nanywhere in my drive-through diet\nand so i started to\nagain i went from slim fast to being a\nnatural pill popper right so it's just\nlike i need these nutrients let me just\ntake these supplements again missing the\nmark but taking steps towards it and\nultimately of course that's very\nexpensive\nbut i finally realized like what if\nhumans been doing the longest we're\ngetting these nutrients through food not\nsynthetic isolated versions of those\nthings so i started to seek out all the\nfoods that had these nutrients and just\nbegin to like flood my system with these\nfoods\nso that was number one i changed what i\nwas eating and literally and there's a\ni've got to share this now but we'll\nprobably circle back to this it's one of\nthe most important tenets\nevery single cell in our body is made\nfrom the food that we eat every cell\nand so we have the ability to make our\nbodies out of really low quality\nmaterials or out of the best stuff\npossible you know and so i was making my\ntissues out of absolute garbage i'm not\nexaggerating the slightest i ate fast\nfood every day\nevery day\nbecause again i lived in ferguson\nmissouri i was surrounded by low quality\nfood and processed food and liquor\nstores and that's all i knew right and\nit was cheap\nagain being on a college budget that's\nwhat i could afford which we got to talk\nabout that the economies of scale too so\nanyway so i'm flooding my tissues with\nreally high quality stuff now and the\nbody is so intelligent once you give it\nthe right materials it knows what to do\nit's often just us getting out of the\nway\nand so that was one number two the\nlow-hanging fruit for me that i had some\neducation on was movement and exercise\nand being in pain\nthe worst thing to do is to do nothing\nthere is a time when you know you have a\nstate of inflammation like if i have\nthese two herniated discs i'm not going\nto go and dead lift you know 315 that's\nnot a good idea but after a couple of\ndays and i'm functional i need to do\nsomething because the body movement is\none of the primary drivers of of healing\nof assimilation of nutrients\nof elimination of metabolic waste\nproducts all these different things\nrequire movement right life is movement\nand so i just went to the gym at the\nuniversity gym just did what i can which\nwas i start off on a stationary bike\na week later i started doing a little\nbit walking on the treadmill week later\ni picked up a couple of weights\nand all of that was driving the good\nnutrition i was bringing in deeper into\nmyself right\nthe third thing was my biggest struggle\nthat two years was sleeping at night\nand i was just like i gotta find a way\nto get some rest because i was\nchronically tired\nand i didn't have to try to do that one\na principle from my first book sleep\nsmarter is that a great night of sleep\nstarts the moment you wake up in the\nmorning right so all these good things i\nwas doing exercising changing my\nnutrition\nand getting access to sunlight all these\nreally simple things\nled to me sleeping better in the evening\nand once i started sleeping i got better\nso fast\nbecause\nit is the most anabolic stage that a\nhuman being can be in outside of\nmeditation everything else is really\ncatabolic if you're up and active you're\nyou're catabolic and so this is where\nyour body's producing all these\nregenerative hormones and hgh and\nreparative enzymes you know once i my my\nsleep improved and my movement practice\nbut of course the biggest thing was my\nmind you know my change and perception\nof all these things but that's really\nwhat the first domino was was changing\nthe question and the right stuff that\nwas already there i can now see i love\nhow you've simplified it into\ndiet and nutrition\nthe sleep\nand then of course the movement aspect\nwhich you know the three key tenants and\nthen grouped by the mindset and the\napproach\ni want to dive into some of those\namazing insights that you share in this\nbook because i think\nas you rightly said\nour\nunderstanding\nof food\nnutrients\nvitamins\nsupplements\nhas been so rudimentary for so long\nand even today i think as you rightly\nsaid there's so much being marketed at\nus\nthat you kind of follow the latest trend\nor the latest diet or the latest fad\nonly to find that it's not sustainable\nor that it doesn't really cure how\nyou're feeling and i think we've started\nto realize that\nfood can change how you feel\nand i don't think we thought about that\nwe thought food is energy and you just\nkeep putting it in i love the idea of\nhow we're building ourselves through\nbad materials or good materials\nwhy is it important as you talk about in\nthe book to use power\nor food to reboot your metabolism what\nare the benefits of rebooting your\nmetabolism\nand what are methods through diet and\nnutrition that boost our metabolism for\neveryone listening it should always be\nwhat is the thing right so when we hear\nthese terms like metabolism\nwe often have a certain association with\nthat's my point yeah right exactly yes\nso it's usually going to be tied to\nweight loss and it's a huge mistake\nbecause metabolism is really everything\nthere's a whole field of immuno\nmetabolism you know your immune system\nhas its own metabolism where it's\nbuilding new immune cells where it's\nfunctioning at a certain level where\nthere's cellular waste products and the\nlist goes on and on all these things are\nmetabolism so life itself is driven by\nmetabolism but\nthis is a huge mistake even in the\nweight loss domain when we're just\nthinking about food and nutrition and\ndiet in terms of changing our metabolism\nand this is why with the book i gave\npeople what they want which again that's\nthe on-ramp right but food controls so\nmuch more than just our metabolism it\nalso controls our cognitive function our\nemotional intelligence is highly\ninfluenced by our nutrition that's one\nof the main things i wanted to talk with\nyou about as well and also it affects\nour relationships and how we relate to\nother people the list goes on and on\nfood isn't just food it's information\nyou know and so as far as the metabolism\nside is concerned what i wanted to do\nwas break down how the process of\nmetabolism actually works how does\nweight loss work right how's fat loss\nwork where does fat go like when i quote\nlose weight where the hell's the weight\ngo you know what i mean so i'm taking\npeople through that process\nand i use analogies to make it make\nsense because one of the things i\nlearned from tony was one of the fastest\nways of learning which i was doing this\nbut i didn't realize it is take\nsomething that you don't know and\nconnect it to something that you do know\nright and so i use this analogy of going\nto the movies\nand using it as a cellular movie theater\nand how the process of fat loss actually\nworks\nand so we've got these key ushers\nthat are making things happen you know\nyou come into the movie theater and\nyou've got these specific enzymes so\nwe've got hormone sensitive lipase for\nexample and hormone sensitive lipase is\nthe enzyme required to actually open up\nyour cells so that it releases stored\nenergy and you know triglycerides stored\nfat to be used for fuel nothing's\nhappening without this usher all right\nso that's required then we've got\nanother usher who's putting fat in the\nseeds right lipoprotein lipase right\nand so but then we've got the managers\nof the ushers which are insulin and\nglucagon which there's so much more but\ni'm just giving a little snapshot oh\nthis is great i love this analogy it's a\nbrilliant analogy\nso it's making it make sense to me so\nthat's a good thing\ni'm the dummy in the room so this is\ngreat yeah\nso insulin and glucagon they're actually\nbrothers right so and they're both from\ntheir loving mother miss pancreas all\nright so\ninsulin is really about\nmanagement and always looking for the\nworst possible scenario right so they're\nall about saving up for rainy day get\nstoring as much as possible so we're all\nsafe and we're all good glucagon is more\nof a free thinker more of a you know go\nwith the flow type of vibe and it's cool\nwith letting go of some of this stored\nenergy and so glucagonic to make a\nsummation of these so insulin is the\nbiggest hormonal driver of us storing\nfat in our cells or storing energy in\nour cells\nwhen people hear the word insulin we\noften think about diabetes right because\nit's a lack\ntype 1 diabetes is a lack of producing\ninsulin the mother pancreas\nthe beta cells are not producing\ninsulin which is\nabsolutely horrendous this means your\ncells can't get energy and you'll\nliterally just wither away it's a\nterrible way to die\ntype 2 diabetes which is most prevalent\nhere in the united states right now in\nthe united states\nabout 130 million citizens here in the\nu.s have type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes\nit's insane but this is not a condition\nwhere you're no longer producing insulin\nthis is a condition where your insulin\nsensitivity the ability of that cell to\nget the signal has been tampered down\nright because insulin has been so\nabundant because the blood sugar has\nbeen so abundant right\nand so it's but here's the thing and\nit's a really beautiful thing\nthat even a condition like that it's the\nbody adapting\nto keep you alive\nso type 2 diabetes and we get this label\nthat you have this chronic disease and\nyou're no good or you know you're you're\ntainted or you're broken\nit's actually this really intelligent\nadaptation by the human body\nbecause it's adapting the way that your\nmetabolism works under unideal\ncircumstances\nright so it's beautiful it's amazing\nthe problem however is that we've been\nled to believe that that is the end\nstory that your body is stupid and it\ncan't\nshift and create another expression and\nso now it's common knowledge back in the\nin the day i've been in this field\nalmost 20 years i'm about to hit my\n20-year anniversary\nand we couldn't publicly say even\nanother mark hyman like you got to be\nvery careful saying cure diabetes right\ntoday it's common knowledge that you can\nreverse this condition\nso you got\ninsulin driving\npeople into the seats right keeping the\ntheater full and we've got glucagon open\nup the doors to allow people to go out\nand kick it at an after party right\nso these are two big hormonal drivers of\nmetabolism\nwe've got some enzymatic ones i hit a\nlittle bit but then we've got the\ninternal cashier as well which is your\nliver in many ways\nso people don't think about these things\nand this beautiful dance is taking place\nlike we just want to get that fat off\nright and oftentimes we associate that\nwith like really working hard right\nrestricting cutting things away\nuh you can't have deprivation right all\nthose things those terms don't feel good\nright it's very against human nature\nand on the other side you have to abuse\nyourself you have to exercise your face\noff you've got to just you know this\ntenant that i was taught in my universe\ni paid for this education jay at a\nprivate at a private university\nthe first day of school in this big\nauditorium nutritional science class the\nteacher told us that if you want to\nmanage your metabolism if you want to\nmanage your body weight just manage your\ncalories that's all you have to do is\ncontrol the calories right\nhe was overweight as well by the way all\nright and now it's again it's not that\nhe's trying to be an affairs this is\nwhat he learned and at the time we were\nin the food pyramid all right so this is\nwhen i went to school back in this was\n97.\nit's changed a little bit like we went\nfrom like the food pyramid to my plate\nbut still really the same principles\nbut\nto say that calories control everything\nabout you or your metabolism or your\nability to lose weight is very myopic\nit's tunnel vision\nand people don't really realize and\nthat's what i spent the nice segment of\nthe book\nreally diving into the beautiful history\nbehind calories and like how is that a\nthing that people plant this flag and i\nknow this i was one of them right being\na nutritional scientist and also\nsomebody who's working as a strength\nconditioning coach at the university\nthese i was just replicating and\nregurgitating what i was taught and it\nworked for some people not for others\nand so what i did was i brought to bear\nthis new term and it's called epi\ncaloric right\nso and this was a pivot from my friend\nbruce lipton dr bruce lipton i don't\nknow if you've talked to him before i\nhaven't i know who he is\nthe biology of belief right so\nepigenetics yes right so this is he's\nthe person more than anybody's pushing\ninto popular culture\nthat means above genetic control right\nbut epicolor control is above caloric\ncontrol there are certain principles\nthat control what your what your body\ndoes with the calories you consume and\nthis would be so logical if we think\nabout it and so just a couple of those\none of those is the quality of food\nitself all right so we hear this that\nnot all calories are created equal but\nwe have really sound science on this now\ni shared one of the studies in the book\nand again this was a peer-reviewed study\nand what they did was they took test\nsubjects and they wanted to see what\nwould happen\nwith their metabolism when they eat a\nmeal of processed foods versus a meal of\nwhole foods right and so the processed\nfood they're both sandwiches by the way\nall right so it's not like super\nglorified processed versus whole but the\nwhole food sandwich was whole grain\nbread\nand cheddar cheese the processed food\nsandwich was white bread and cheese\nproduct and cheese product is what most\npeople are eating that's like craft it's\nthey can't legally call it cheese it's\ncalled craft singles there's not enough\ncheese in the cheese you know which is\nreally messed up wow yeah and so they\nconsume each of these sandwiches and\nthey track their\ncaloric expenditure right so and this is\nsomething so to get to just the end part\nof like where does the weight go we\nbreathe most of the weight that we lose\nout we expel it through our lungs our\nlungs are and also uh excretion organ as\nwell we don't really think about that\nbut they are\nand so anyways so they're tracking the\noutgo of energy after eating these two\nsandwiches and what they found was the\npeople eating when they ate the\nprocessed food sandwich there was a 50\nreduction in their body's expenditure of\ncalories\nsomething happened by eating that food\nthat made their body hold on to more of\nthe energy they just consumed and what\nit really was was a hormonal clog to put\nin a simple term\nit changed the hormonal cascade\nneurotransmitter cascade organ function\nin a way that made the body more stingy\nat holding on to this very abnormal\nenergy that was coming in and so again\n50 reduction is massive\nand how often are people trying to lose\nweight counting calories but eating\nprocessed foods\ncounting the point system and all these\nthings which can be wonderful but we\nhave to address the food quality so this\nwas published in food and nutrition\nresearch by the way if you want to\nthat's fascinating i'm so glad you\nshared that with me because\nyeah it's easy to be like this is\nhealthy food this is unhealthy food\nbut it's even deeper than that and i\nthink the gold standard which i think\nyou set\nwhich i really identify with is\ni just know i want to be healthier like\nwhat i've been saying is i want to be\nhealthier i want to be more informed\nbecause if something happens to me\ni don't want it to be something that\ni can and will continue to monitor\nbecause i want to be as healthy so i can\ncontinue to do my service in the world\nlike that's that's where my personal\nintention goes i know one of the things\nthat\npeople are struggling with a lot right\nnow is inflammation\nright and you talk about the microbiome\nin the in the book as well and the\nconnection but\nwalk me through\nwhere inflammation is created from\nand how it connects to the microbiome in\nthe body yeah the term again what is it\nwhat yeah inflammation the term itself\nis derived from the word essentially\nmeaning it's set on fire right so\nthere's this\nfire taking place in the human body and\njust to lean and connect inflammation to\nmetabolism let's do that\none of the studies that i referred to as\nwell was looking at and this was\npublished in the annals of the new york\nacademy of sciences they were looking at\nwhat was happening with inflammation in\nthe brain\nleading to\naccelerated weight gain wow\nnow this is another thing when people\nare trying to lose weight nobody's\ntelling them we need to deal with the\ninflammation in your brain and so what\nthe researchers uncovered was that\nessentially inflammation in the brain\nwas leading to\nmore belly fat accumulation\nand\nmore disruption to their metabolism but\nthe key was\nmore belly fat accumulation and obesity\nonce people were venturing into obesity\nit was leading to more brain\ninflammation\nso this becomes this vicious circle\nright and again we're not looking at we\nneed to address\nthe inflammation in your brain why is\nthis happening well your brain is\ncontrolling your body\nfar more than anything else\nand there's an internal thermostat\nthat's even controlling your metabolic\nrate which is based on your hypothalamus\nwhich is kind of considered the master\ngland of the body\nand the hypothalamus not only is\nis kind of like a thermostat for your\nmetabolism but also it's a thermostat\nfor your body temperature for\nyour sleep cycles and the list goes on\nit's like a circadian controller right\ncircadian medicine is popping right out\ntoo\nand so\npaying attention and so specifically the\nresearchers were denoting hypothalamic\ninflammation leading to all these\nproblems so what's causing that brain\ninflammation\nobesity in and of itself is increasing\nthe rate of inflammation so right now in\nthe united states we're knocking on the\ndoor of 250 million of our citizens\nbeing overweight or obese right it's\nbeyond epidemic it's it's insane rest\nassured if we're venturing into obesity\nyour brain is suffering because of it\nand i also noted in another study where\nwe're seeing this correlation i talked\nto daniel amen who wrote that yeah i\nloved him\nhe's been on the podcast twice yeah i\nlove him so much yeah he's awesome but\nhe's accumulated so much data and but\nthere's also some peer review studies as\nwell\nlooking at once our waist size is\nincreasing is correlated with a decrease\nin our brain size so as our waist\ncircumference goes up our brain size\ngoes down the volume of our brain which\nis not good at all\nand so there's this huge connection with\nthese two\nbut also what's driving this\ninflammation\nis the foods that we're eating obviously\nas well\nand obesity itself but just to give a\nlittle snapshot like how does that work\nhow's obesity creating more inflammation\nour fat cells are pretty they're pretty\ndamn amazing\nwithout our fat cells being as\nintelligent as they are we wouldn't have\nmade it as humanity it enabled us to go\nthrough times of famine and still\nsurvive\nbut here's the thing we live in a very\ndifferent time now where more people are\ndying from excess than from deprivation\nright\nand so during this time of excess our\nfat cells can actually grow 1 000 times\ntheir size\nright it's it gets crazy they're like\nwow\ni don't want to disrespect them by\ncalling little trash cans but they're\nkind of like these internal trash cans\nthat can they keep collecting yeah it's\nlike these hefty hefty sense sacks like\nreally good trash bags that are filling\nup and as that happens\nit's sending out a distress signal\nbecause the fat cells were never made to\ncontain that much stored energy\nand so it's sending out a kind of a\nfalse distress signal to your immune\nsystem\nthinking that you're infected you know\nyour fat cells are chronically infected\nthis is why we see epidemic levels of\ninflammation measured by things like\nc-reactive protein and folks as we\nventure into obesity so the fat cells\nthemselves are a big contributor to\ninflammation but to lean into food a\nlittle bit one of the biggest culprits\nis being highlighted today and there's\nwith any of the stuff i talk about jay\nthere's always conflicting information\nof course of course yeah i get that and\nand the average person doesn't though\nyou know it's just like this is the\nend-all be-all what i do is\ni'm a research scientist primarily\ni'll i'll go and proactively look for\nthings that\nrebuke\nwhat i believe\nthat\nprove what i'm saying other otherwise or\nother than\nand you have it takes a lot of courage\nto go and look for things to prove you\nwrong yeah but what i'll do is i'll look\nat the variety of information and what\nis the majority of data that we have say\nthat's a better place for us to stand on\nand educate from right\nbut one of the biggest culprits\nand this is the what the majority of\ndata says\nis these highly refined\noxidized seed oils that have become so\nprevalent in our food system and again i\nget to work with the best people in the\nworld on these subjects like dr kate\nshanahan is really a pioneering voice in\nthis field and she's you know she worked\nwith the lakers and helped with kobe\nbryant got him all these protocols\nextended his career all these great\nthings\nand so she has that that fame and\ncredibility there but she's also a\nbrilliant scientist and somebody who's\nvery versed in metabolism\nbut one of the things that she shared\nwith me was that this particular study\nwhich was crazy they looked at the\nbiopsies right so you can actually go\nand\nlook inside of what a fat cell contains\nback in the earlier part of the 1900s\nand saw what is the makeup of the\naverage person's fat cell\nand about two percent of our fat cells\nback then were made of these\npolyunsaturated fatty acids or pufas\nright\ntoday\nthe amount of polyunsaturated fatty\nacids that make up the average person's\nfat cell is up to 25 or even 30 percent\nso it went from 2 percent to 25\nso literally the ingredients that make\nus as a species has changed dramatically\nand what is it about these particular\nfats like how how is so much of it\nmaking up the ingredients that make us\nup\nand it's because they're in everything\nthey're very cheap they're rancid\noxidized oil they have no choice but to\nbe those things like getting the oil\nfrom corn\nlike there's so little and if people saw\nthe process which i highly encourage\npeople to do there's lots of videos you\ncould see the processing of canola oil\nor quote vegetable oil i remember when\nmy mom started using vegetable oil\ntrying to get healthy because my family\nagain i was the skinny kid in the family\neverybody pretty much everybody else in\nmy family at least about 80 percent of\nfolks were obese\nand so she started using vegetable oil\nsounds healthy but it's not asparagus\noil or broccoli oil these are highly\nrefined seed oils\ncorn oil soy oil canola oil\nand\nto extract those oils\nthere it kind of looks like\njust\nmud it just looks disgusting it looks\nlike this um like kind of like almost\nlike gasoline type vibe to it and has to\nuse bleaching agents and deodorizers and\ni cited a study in my book\nand this was published in the journal\ninhalation toxicology and they found\nthat just smelling those oils while\ncooking can damage your dna all right\nwow crazy stuff just smelling just\ninhaling\nthe fumes from it let alone actually\nputting it in yes yes so it's crazy it's\nit's so crazy and so for me it's just\nlooking like this\nspecific component\nyour body has to go into this kind of\npro-inflammatory state to try to manage\nany insult inflammation is one of the\nmost important things for our survival\nit's\nkind of been given a bad\nname right now because we're dealing\nwith chronic inflammation but we need\ninflammation in order to to just heal\nfor stuff you don't even know is going\non there are cells right now in your\nbody that are dying off and recycling\nthere's always an inflammatory component\ncatabolic component and that's okay but\nonce we venture into chronic\ninflammation where these things are\ngetting out of hand that's where we\nstart to see all manner of things go\nwrong\nwow i mean you know what i've i find it\nso\nuseful to be having this conversation\nwith you because and i hope everyone's\nlistening and watching\ni'm trying to ask the questions that i\nthink we skip what does this actually\nmean\nhow does it actually affect us because\nright now we hear all these buzz words\nand we look for the quick fix all right\ni've got information or i do this to\nto you know alkalize it i've got this do\nthis like and we're always looking at\nthat quick fix that quick win\nthe quick solve and actually when i'm\nsitting here listening to you i'm going\nwow there is just\nof course naturally there's so much more\nto it\nbut we have to be so much more alert and\nvigilant which is where we struggle\nbecause it's almost like there is no\nconvenience now\nbecause there's all this information\nlike you said there's conflicting\ninformation so if i'm listening to this\nshow right now\nand\ni want to create more energy in my life\ni want to create more\nvibrancy in how i feel\nwhat are some of the things that we're\nlikely missing or that we're likely\nstruggling with in our diet or\nnutritionally\nthat we could add to help start that\nprocess of at least feeling a bit more\npositive like we have a bit more control\nwe could stay right in the same lane and\njust swap out the oils that we're using\nwith some intention\nresearchers at auburn\nfound that\nolive oil\noleokanthal rich extra virgin olive oil\nis one of the few things that's been\nfound to be highly effective at reducing\ninflammation of the brain\nright and also being able to help to\nheal the blood-brain barrier\nso\nwhat does this mean\nthe blood-brain barrier is kind of like\nmethiokaku is kind of like a modern day\neinstein right he was like the human\nbrain is the most complicated object in\nthe known universe\nthat's big for him to say something like\nthat\nthat's really remarkable repeat that for\nus the human brain is the most\ncomplicated object in the known universe\nright\nand\nthe cool thing is we all have one we're\nnot very good at using it you know but\nwe all have this really miraculous organ\nand your body is very protective of it\nbecause again it's controlling\neverything about you controlling your\nmetabolism for example it's the only\nmajor organ is fully encased in hard\nand hard bone right so we've got this\nbuilt-in helmet to try to protect it\nwe've got the blood-brain barrier\nbecause\neverything that we eat the last place to\nactually allow nutrients in is going to\nbe your brain all right because it has a\nblood-brain barrier it's kind of like an\ninternal\nsecurity system or i like to think about\nit like a\ntollbooth\nright so certain i like these analogies\ni like them certain nutrients get\nexpress pass right if anybody ever is\nlive where they have tolls and you get\nan express pass they can just go right\ninto the brain\nmost other things they're going to meet\nthe toll booth and they're not going to\nbe able to get through because the guard\nthere is like\nyou know\ndwayne the rock johnson it's like clones\nof him and vin diesel or whatever so\nit's just like highly unlikely that you\ncan get into the brain it's very it's\nlike an exclusive club it's very\nexclusive\nand so to make it into the brain only\nspecific things are able to do that\none of the big issues today leading to\nmore inflammation is the degradation\nwe're breaking down our own blood-brain\nbarrier this internal security system by\neating all these abnormal foods\nthe blood-brain barrier a big aspect of\nits regulation is through the fats that\nwe consume right\nand so again eating these really low\nquality oils and making our cells out of\nthese things we're degrading how our\nbody functions and so what the\nresearchers found again was that\nextra virgin olive canthal rich olive\noil is one of those foods that's really\nhealing and anti-inflammatory and also\ncan help to heal the blood-brain barrier\nthat's crazy because for me again like i\ndon't have a dog in the fight i don't\ncare if olive oil is cool or not if it's\nyeah yeah i don't care you don't you\ndon't eat it olive oil yeah it's so\nmiraculous but then you just look at\nwhat have humans been doing the longest\nand how do you make olive oil you crush\nolives that's it\nit's not like the process that these\nother oils these seed oils have to go\nthrough again with the deodorizers and\nthe bleaching agents and the high heat\nas a matter of fact extra virgin olive\noil that means that it's not heat\nprocessed wow all right so it's even\npaying attention to the very volatile\nnature of those fats and it's stored in\ndark glass bottles because it's even\nphotosensitive it's light sensitive can\nuh break down and degrade those oils\nright so in humans we've had we have\ndocumentation for thousands of years\nhave been consuming olive oil right\nand so that's one of the great\nprinciples to lean back into which is\nlike what have humans been doing the\nlongest let's do that\nyou know like what got us here because\nwhat we're doing now is not working yeah\nright so that's one of the the great\nfoods that can help to reduce\ninflammation so swapping out those oils\nbeing intentional about it the best way\nto consume these oils is going to be\nthrough\nlike finishing dishes like adding some\nolive oil on top or using it to make\nsalads cooking with it you can\nmoderate heat is okay but for cooking we\nneed things that have more saturation\nthat are more stable so they're not\ngiving off all of these\nthese um kind of pro-inflammatory\noxidative compounds right\nso that would be like coconut oil or\nghee or grass-fed butter avocado oil is\nalso rising in popularity now as well\nbut just to throw a couple more for\nreducing inflammation\nthe cruciferous family of vegetables\nhave been found to reduce inflammation\nspecifically in the brain broccoli you\nknow again i put\npeer-reviewed data to show that this\nfood that's just like super common can\nhelp to reduce brain inflammation\nright so yeah i can go on and on but\nthose are just a couple of things no no\nthis is fantastic and i want everyone\nwho's listening and watching to know\nthat\nall these reviews the researchers in the\nbook eat smarter which is what sean's\nreferencing if you are listening and you\ndon't see me holding the cover and\nholding the book you can order it right\nnow and i i deeply recommend that\nbecause the level of detail of insight\nthat sean has is so powerful it should\nnot be underestimated this isn't a new\ndiet book or a\nfad book on like you know here's what\nyou need to do three things you need to\ndo tomorrow it's not like that there is\nlike deep research reflection\nintrospection that that shawn's done and\nstudy he's done and so\nyou know i'm going in and allowing him\nto share depth on certain parts but but\nthe book is is full of these insights\nsean i want to talk a bit about\nstress\nand\nthe brain and then diet because you also\ntalk about\nthe impact of food on the brain brain on\nfood but also our emotional states\nwe all know what emotional eating is\nwe've all picked up a tub of ice cream\nor\npicked up sugars when we're low in\nenergy or you know we've been there we\nmay even\nget\ndrawn in that direction still today\none thing i find\nintriguing that i'd love to learn from\nyou is\nhow much is\nstress in the brain causing\nsome of these challenges within the body\nand can food be used to work backwards\nalmost\nor does stress need to be dealt with in\ndifferent ways yeah that's such a great\nquestion\nagain what is stress we have to look at\nthat\nand we tend to put stress in this one\nbox cognitively most times people\nassociated with like life stress like\nwork stress you know work is stressing\nme out my relationship is stressing me\nout but those are just a couple of\nfactors that go into your overall stress\nload as a human being so all of these\ninputs are stressors and for example\nexercise is a stressor\nand it's known as a hermitic stressor\nwhich that means that if you're able to\nrecover from said exercise you get\nbenefit right the kind of like what\ndoesn't kill me makes me stronger\nprinciple right but if you put on\nintense exercise on top of relationship\nstress work stress\nspiritual stress right feeling not on\npurpose or cut adrift or disconnected\nyou add that onto diet stress\nthe stress coming from the abnormal\nfoods you may be consuming\nthe environmental stress\nright right now this is dope like we can\nrecord we got all this technology but\nall of these energies are\njust running in and out of ourselves at\npaces and degrees that we just don't\nunderstand yet right so we're all\nintermingling with these energies that\nwe've never been exposed to again as\nhumans so the environment itself is\ngoing to be adding an additional stress\ngravity gravity's trying to kill you\nlike you literally is trying to weigh us\ndown you know in a sense if you want to\nlook at it like that but we are\nresilient we ca we've adapted to it you\nknow but the john carter i don't know if\nyou know about that uh that that book\nand that's that movie the disney it\ndidn't do very well but uh i think it's\non disney play what's he called john\ncarter no so this guy teleports\nuh accidentally like from civil war\nvibes to being on mars and on mars he's\nlike superhuman because gravity's\ndifferent so he's like jumping around\nyou know like it's it's really cool to\nthink about\ngravity has conditioned us in a certain\nway and we're resilient against it so\nenvironmental stress goes on there and i\ncan go on and on all of these stress\ninputs create your overall stress load\nas a human being\nnow the issue is that\nman i've had the opportunity to work\nwith so many people in a one-on-one\ncontext but you know groups and the\nbooks and all the stuff\nbut the most overlooked thing that i've\nseen\nwhen people are wanting to\nyou know get off of their blood pressure\nmedication that the cineprils or the\nstatins or you know metformin for\ndiabetes or their antidepressants\nwhatever it might be\nthe nutrition and the exercise can only\ngo so far\nthe number one thing that i've seen that\npeople overlook is the impact of stress\nbecause you can overeat your way into\ndisease you can under move your way into\ndisease you can undersleep your way into\nthese diseases you can also over stress\nyour way into disease\nthe problem is that\nstress is invisible you know in a sense\nlike\nexercise we know what that is like it's\nphysical we're interacting with it food\nis like you're putting stuff in like\nit's it's it's visceral it's something\nyou could touch because stress doesn't\nhave that aspect we we negate it\nbut truly and just to kind of loop back\nto the story with that physician and\nthose the nocebo effect\nwow so\neverybody's heard at this point of the\nplacebo effect you know to some degree i\nwas gonna come back to this i'm glad\nyou've gone there yeah and and this it's\namazing right it's amazing\nso\njust on average if we look at the the\nbreadth of peer-reviewed data that we\nhave on average\nplacebos are about 30 percent effective\nin clinical trials so fake drugs\nsham surgeries fake treatments\nare about 30 percent effective on\naverage some\nstudies much higher like 80 effective in\nsome studies on antidepressants people\nare not actually getting something that\nhas\na a real treatment they just believe\nthat they're taking the drug\nnow this\nis\nvery important it has to be coming\nno it doesn't it doesn't have to but in\nthese trials they're coming from an\nauthority figure\nright and so one of the things that i\ntalk about in the book is the impact\nthat your thoughts have on your body's\nmetabolism right so this was done by dr\nalia crum and her team at stanford at\nthe time it was the milkshake study and\nso they blended up these milkshakes\nand they labeled them different\ndifferent amounts of calories even\nthough they were all the same so some of\nthem were the indulgent milkshakes with\nthe they labeled like 700 calories some\nwere you know the um\nsmart shakes where they labeled it like\n200 calories but all of them were really\nlike 450 calories or something like that\nand so\nwhat they found was that\npeople who believe they were having the\nindulgent milkshake\nthey had a much greater\nsecretion or suppression\nof ghrelin the hunger hormone right\nso they're more satiated because they\nbelieve they're consuming something that\nhas a lot more caloric energy\nand on the other side the people who\nthought they were eating the the sensa\nshake the sensible milkshake their\nghrelin levels didn't budge at all which\nmeans they're going to be hungry again\nvery soon after having that milkshake\nright so that's the power of the mind to\nliterally manipulate your metabolism\njust in that one snapshot and i've got\nso much more data\nso your thoughts determine what's\nhappening with your metabolism\nso going back to the placebo effect\nso placebos being again we've got data a\ngreat book is mind over medicine dr\nalyssa rankin so many studies in there\nbut we got data on placebos being\neffective in cancer treatments\nand surgeries for knees like mcl repair\nlike we've got there's there's so many\ncrazy studies where you know they'll\nbecause now you can even watch your\nsurgery where there somebody will be\nwatching their own surgery\nbut\nwhat they're doing is they're playing a\ndifferent video right so they'll cut the\nperson's knee open and just seal it back\nup without doing any actual you know a\ntherapeutic change\nand their their knee problem will heal\nright oftentimes better than the people\nwho had the actual\nsurgery you know surgical change and\nintervention\nso i know this sounds crazy and these\nare things for me i'm a very analytical\nlogical person so i wouldn't believe it\nunless i saw the data myself\nso that's the power of the human mind\njust a snapshot now here's the other\nthing i don't want to call them evil but\nthere's a ev there's an evil twin to the\nplacebo effect it's called the nocebo\neffect this is when you get a negative\ninjunction that something bad is going\nto happen so placebo is saying you're\ngoing to get this therapeutic benefit\nyou're going to take this\nand your blood pressure is going to\nnormalize\nyour\ndepression is going to go away your\ncancer is going to dissolve\na nocebo effect is saying\nthis is incurable\nyou have six weeks to live\nyou'll never walk again\nright so these injunctions from an\nauthority figure and there's another\nstudy i have cited from alia crumb's\nteam they did a skin prick test where\nthey\nused a histamine you know a histamine\nstimulator to create a rash on people's\nskin\nand then they had an inert cream\nand they told the test subjects either\nthis cream is going to make your rash\nworse\nor this cream is going to make your rash\nbetter some different people told\ndifferent things\nnow what happened was and this was true\nfor like 90 percent of the test subjects\nwhen they received that inert cream that\nhad no therapeutic benefit and they told\ntheir rash would get worse within 10\nminutes the rash got worse and spread\nfor other people within 10 minutes the\nrash got better and nearly went away for\nmost people just within 10 minutes of\nthem getting this\ncream that does nothing the biggest part\nof this was\nthe benefit depended directly with\nhow the person believed\nin the competence of the physician\ntheir rapport and belief in the person\ntelling them about the thing\nimpacted their physical response\nthe most so again who are you listening\nto yeah\nyou know and so for me i i had that\nnicebo effect injunction like he told me\nthis was incurable i'll be in pain the\nrest of my life\nyou know i'll never walk normally again\nall these things\nand i believed him\nbut thankfully again just like\nsometimes\ngoing through these things and hitting\nrock bottom\nis a good place to stand up from you\nknow\nand\nbeing able to access this is why people\nare such a gift you know like my\ngrandmother was like a guiding light\nlike a north star for me i didn't\nrealize it at the time i just thought\nshe was being annoying\nbut just knowing that there's somebody\nwho believes in me\nand it just made the process so much\neasier but the thing is you don't need\nanybody else to believe in you you can\nbelieve in yourself\nyou know but it does take\nit does take some revelation it does\ntake a lot of work to be able to do that\nbut anyways but just to put the icing on\nthe cake with this with stress and the\nimpact that it can have on our on our\nbodies and our relationships\nthe reason that i i don't talk about\nthis often jay but the reason i wrote\nthis book\nwas to address\nhow food is affecting how we communicate\nwith each other\nbecause you probably have noticed we're\nliving at a very divisive time right now\nyou know there's so much divisiveness\nthere's so much agitation there's so\nmuch infighting\nwhen on paper we should be more\nconnected than ever like we all have the\nsame access to the same data why is\nthere so much arguing about it right and\nalso people are becoming so polarized\nlike they're going and planting their\nflag\nat one end or the other end but truth\ntruthfully most people are here in the\nmiddle but they're listening to people\nat these outer ends\nbut what's not being talked about is the\nfact that for example\nthere was a study done at the ohio state\nuniversity\nand it was looking at couples you know\nlike i love my wife she's my best friend\nand\nbut we also you know what i'm saying we\nhave stuff you know\nlike every couple\nand the thing is like we know our stuff\nnow because we often attribute it to the\nperson\nbut what they did was they use glucose\nmonitors to see what happens when\nthe person in the in the relationship\nwhen they have abnormal blood sugar how\nthey respond to their partner yes all\nright and so what they found was\nwhen people had when their blood sugar\nwas abnormal you know when they\nexperienced a blood sugar crash for\nexample which is normal because again\nwe're going hypoglycemic and then\ncrashing because the way we eat today\nthe test subjects became much more\naggressive towards their partner keyword\naggressive\nright\nand here's the biggest thing because for\nme it's just like okay that's equality\nbut what's the end result end result is\nthey were far less likely to resolve\ntheir relationship conflicts\nso that's the outcome because your blood\nsugar is messed up now we think about\nthis with kids like you know they're\nhyper whatever they're cranky you're\njust a big adult baby you know you get\nthe same hard wiring and so when we tend\nto be in conflict is when we when our\nbiological needs are off you know we're\ntired when we're hungry these things we\nattribute to kids acting up like that\nbut we do that to each other yes yes\nright\nand so that was just one little glimpse\ninto it like this is somebody that you\nlove\nand so with the just a little sidebar in\nthe study they use like these dolls and\npoking pins in the doll how how\naggressive you are mad at your partner\nyou are it was just kind of creepy like\nsome people that's where\nso but now here's here's how we branch\nthis out globally\nresearchers at oxford university\nthey wanted to see what would happen\nby improving the nutrition of prison\ninmates\nright\nso we have a certain psychological view\nof people who are in these conditions\nyeah right but for me i have an\nexperience\nwith this because of the environment\nthat i come from you know many of my\nfriends and family end up in that\nsituation i could have been in that\nsituation\nand so what they did was and this is a\nrandomized\nplacebo-controlled trial gold standard\nthis isn't just guessing this isn't like\nthis thing gold standard of clinical\ntrial they took a group of these prison\ninmates and they improved their\nnutrition just through getting some\nomega-3 fatty acid supplements which\nwe've got to talk about that by the way\nand then uh just increasing their amount\nof vitamins and minerals that they're\nconsuming right so very rudimentary\nstuff and then they have the placebo\ngroup who gets nothing\nthis is a four and a half month study\nand after compiling all the data the\ntest subjects the prison inmates who\nreceived the improved nutrition had a 35\ndrop\nin behavioral offenses versus the\nplacebo group\nand most notably a 37 drop overall in\nviolent offenses\ntheir proclivity towards hurting another\nperson dropped by 37 by increasing their\nnutrition what was in that nutrition do\nyou know basic vitamins minerals\nmultivitamin type stuff\nomega-3s but the omega-3s are critical\nthat's why i want to specifically talk\nabout this but that sounds so crazy\nbecause the very best\nprograms in prison for rehabilitation\ncome nowhere near those types of results\nwow so some other researchers saw and\nthey were just like that's impossible\nand they replicated the study and almost\ngot the exact same numbers this was\npublished in the journal aggressive\nbehavior there's so many journals that\ncover these things and the data is\navailable by getting people healthier by\ngiving them the basic the question\nshould be\nhow just your your cells your brain\ncells specifically being able to talk to\neach other you require key nutrients\nand so one of those nutrients is omega-3\nfatty acids dha and epa specifically\nyeah i want to hear about this yeah the\ncool thing is that blood-brain barrier\nthey got an express pass so they're able\nto cross the blood-brain barrier because\nit's one of those essentials for the\nbrain\nnow\nthis is so crazy\nbut\nwithout these specific omega-3s\nyour brain cells can't really\nefficiently talk to each other there's\nsomething called they enable something\ncalled signal transduction so your cells\nbeing able to talk and also they're part\nof all of your cell membranes so just\nthe cell being sustainable itself\nif you're deficient in these things\nagain your body will try to do what it\nhas to do\nbut it just degrades the way that your\nbody works so much\nand so\na study this was published in the\njournal neurology one of the top\njournals looking at the brain and they\nfound that test subjects who consumed\nless than two grams of omega-3s per day\nhad the highest rate of brain shrinkage\nyeah\nand and where are we getting omega-3s\nfrom naturally if we're even getting\nthose yeah this is so important because\nfor years\ni made this mistake all right working in\nthe clinical practice seeing people\nevery day\nand wanted to invoke more plants into\npeople's diets i would tell people make\nsure you get in your chia seeds and your\nyou know your flax seeds you got flax\nseeds or flax seed oil in the\nrefrigerated section because it's\nvolatile\nbut i was missing the mark because\nthat's ala it's a different form of\nomega-3s it's the plant version and it's\nnot what your brain uses\nall right so your brain uses epa and dha\nthese are only found in animal foods and\nwe do have an option for people doing a\nvegan protocol which is algae oil\nall right so we'll come back to that in\njust a second but this is very important\nbecause your body can take\nthe plant omega-3 ala and convert it\ninto\ndha and epa but you're going to lose at\nleast 75 of the conversion process all\nright so this is going to depend on your\nmicrobiome your other metabolic factors\non who's efficient in converting this\nso to say for somebody that is doing a\nvegan or vegetarian protocol that just\nhas chia seeds you're cool it's not it's\nnot cool\nliterally we're talking about your brain\nshrinking this is not a joke you need to\nmake sure you're getting these d8 this\ndha and epa the whole food versions or\nor sources that we've evolved having is\ngoing to be coming from fatty fish again\nhumans have been eating these foods for\nthousands of years i don't want to get\ninto religiosity about our nutrition\nyeah it creates all this divisiveness i\njust want to talk about principles right\nand so fatty fish\ngrass-fed beef eggs\nand then we've got\num the as far as what most of the peer\nreview studies are done on it's done on\nfish oil right and it's just it is what\nit is\nnow with that said i believe that there\nare some other means for this one of\nthem depending on where your ethics lie\ncould be krill oil all right so krill\noil is\none of the richest sources of\nastaxanthin which is protective of those\nomega-3s which is huge in of itself but\nthis is a microscopic keyword\nmicroscopic shrimp all right you're\nprobably just even like if you lick the\nair you're going to be killing more\nsentient beings than you know what i\nmean this microscopic shrimp but it's a\nconcentrated form of omega-3s dha and\nepa if that's where you sit then we have\nalgae oil which is a plant source the\ncaveat here is that we don't have much\npeer-reviewed data on its efficacy we\nknow the dha and epa is there so i don't\nwant everybody to wait if you're doing a\nvegan protocol please get yourself an\nalgae oil today like today\nget a specificity what do you eat that\nwith so algae oil is going to be caps\nencapsulated oh cops okay\nso which again i'm would love people to\ndo food first but in this situation it's\nessential it is absolutely essential so\nwe can still do our chia and our flax\nand our hemp seeds those are those are\ngreat for other things but please don't\nmistake the fact that\nwe need omega-3s for cognitive function\nand again in this clinical trial they're\nusing fish oil\nso this is not a joke being able to\nreduce your proclivity towards violence\nto improve your ability to perspective\ntake\nand to\nbe able to have more compassion and\npatience\nwe know this when we're when we're\nnutrient deprived when we're even just\nhungry we tend to be more irritable and\nless patient towards people we love let\nalone people we don't know\nso\nthe biggest issue i believe jay\nand this isn't because i'm a\nnutritionist like i really examine this\nlike i sat with this for a while i was\nlike is this because my life has just\nbeen revolved around health\nlike truly i feel that the biggest\nunderlying issue for our epidemic levels\nof divisiveness\nand very illogical behavior\nand\nthe ability to\nsee another human being\nand to want to do them harm\nis because we are unhealthy\nyou know and\nthe data indicates this but my real my\nlife indicates this\nyou know like i grew up in an\nenvironment\nman like it was just is an environment\nso volatile there's so much violence\nyou know outside\nmy door and in my own household\nand\nto see how i've changed\nbecause i was a reflection of that\nenvironment something i didn't tell you\nabout when i went to that private\nuniversity i got kicked out of that\nuniversity for fighting\nwow i got kicked out of high school for\nmy entire junior year for fighting wow\nand i was that i was in student advisory\ni was uh teenage health consultant which\nwas this little health program i was in\ninroads which was uh i was able to take\ncollege credit you know it was the first\nyear that it was popping off with st\nlouis university\ni was a scholar athlete i i was all\nthese things it didn't matter you know i\ngot in this situation where i felt\nthreatened and i\nresorted to that behavior\nyou know and every day\nin the morning you know going i'm\ngetting the cereal and getting the you\nknow the pasteurized orange juice i'm\neating pizza pretty much every day at\nlunch with a pretzel with cheese you\nknow and just like i'm making my body\nout of this\nreally low quality material right\nand so the crazy thing was\nonce i got physically healthier i\nstarted to see people differently and i\nstarted to have so much more patience\nbecause i was replicating those\nbehaviors like you know my my daughter's\nmy oldest i have three kids\nand\nmy mother like she would say something\nonce and then five seconds later she's\npissed off right she doesn't want to\nrepeat herself she's just ready on fire\nto be mad to be irritated to be\naggressive towards you\nand to have such a lack of patience\nand so i was being that with my daughter\nyou know what for me i wanted her to be\nof course most people want their\nchildren to be better than them and so\nwhen she was in kindergarten i was\ngetting her like second and third grade\nwork and we would sit around the table\nand all this stuff and just imagine like\nthe lack of patience that i had she and\nshe you know graduated with honors all\nthat stuff but you know just what she\nhad to deal with and i'm even then of\nstill\nit wasn't like bad but still just like\nthe level of patience that i have now\nfor my like my youngest son is 10\nit's night and day it is night and day\nbecause i'm physically healthier\nand it's not a struggle it's not a reach\nfor me\nnow here's the the rub\nit's not that we can't express\ncompassion\nor to perspective take or express\npatience when we're unhealthy it's just\nharder yeah yeah yeah exactly\nand i think we've all experienced that\nright like i think we all know that that\nwhen you're hungry\nyou\nreact differently to everything and i\nthink we've all experienced the\nirritability when you feel like your\nbody is like exhausted or malnutritioned\nyou're going to be more irritable you're\ngoing to be more agitated i think we\nknow that\nmost people would say yeah i know\nexactly what that feels like\nand and this is why i like the\nconnection you're making and i agree\nwith you even more is\ni've spent so long with people\nwhen they keep trying to solve the issue\nin their head\nthey're wondering why their energy is\nnot right they're wondering why\nthey don't feel positive they're\nwondering why\nthey don't feel clear\nand so much of it is diet related\nthere's\nof course there's meditation and there's\nmindfulness and these beautiful\npractices but if you're doing all of\nthose but you're not solving your gut\nyou're making life harder like you're\nworking harder without using all the\nresources and that's why at the\nbeginning when you said it's your diet\nyour\nsleep and your movement and then you\nhave your mindset and your meditation\nand your mindfulness we've got to use\nall fours like you can't just use one\nlike you can't just work out and say oh\nit doesn't matter what i eat\nand you can't just eat right and say oh\nit doesn't matter if i don't work out\nand you can't just sleep right and you\nwrite it's not about choosing either raw\nit's it's all of them and that's what\nyou present in this book about the\nconnection between them yeah sean you're\nsuch a\nwise insightful 20 years studied i mean\nwhen you mention them like i can tell\nit's it's phenomenal and you can tell\nwhat a passion you have for this\nif if someone's listening today\nand you could simplify for them three\nthings that they should try and learn\nmore about\nand three things they should be very\naware of that they may need to put aside\nwhat would you say for each of those for\nsomeone who's today going wow i need to\nread this book eat smartest i'm going to\norder that but it's like what are three\nthings that i need\nto add and think about and research and\nlearn more about and what are three\nthings that i maybe need to avoid and\nset aside\nyou know this is a tenet throughout\nhistory\nthe number one thing for me is to know\nthyself\nyou know really\ndo do a self-assessment because\noftentimes you know working as somebody\nwho's\ni'm sitting across a table from a person\nand they've got 12 medications that\nthey're on and they're wanting to make a\nchange\nand i have to be there and to look them\nin the eyes and say i got you we're\ngoing to figure this out\nand actually know\nwith every fiber of my being that we're\ngoing to figure it out yeah\nto be able to do that\ni have to evoke within that person and\nfind what is a leverage point\nand help them to get honest about what\nlanded them in this place\nthat they're in to begin with right so\nwhat i would find is that and this is a\ngreat\nsecret for all the coaches out there\nmany people already probably know this\nwho are doing this type of work\nif you allow a person to speak\njust ask them questions they will often\ntell you the cause and the cure of what\nis ailing them\ntheir being they know it already it's\nalready\nwithin their\nmental and you know cellular records\nthey know better than anybody\nright but you have to give people space\nto be able to speak\nand so but oftentimes\ncoaches you know we want to help people\nso we just want to give them our thing\nright but just actually be there listen\nbe a space for this person it's probably\nnobody's ever really listened to them\nlike just actually shut everything down\nand listen to them be that person and\nthey'll tell you the cause and cure so\nknow thyself is the tenant self-assess\nand\nthere's different personality types that\nwe can put people in but we're infinite\nyou know we really are but there are\npeople who\ntend to be people who start things and\nstop things very quickly you're right\nthey meet a little bit of resistance in\nthere ah that's okay\nthen there are people who\nyou know um swing for the fences they go\nand they do so much like they go they\nget all the things they get all the\nequipment they go so hard and they run\nthemselves into the ground\nright\nand there are people who are just more\nbalanced like there's different\npersonality types yeah and so really\nhoning in on what your personality types\nis yeah are and i i talked about this a\nlittle bit in the book as well so know\nthyself so you know what to shore up and\ni don't like to talk talk in terms of\nstrength and strengths and weaknesses\nyou know you have strengths and then you\noften have things that are foreign to\nyou right and that's okay because like\nmy strength is i know a lot about the\nhuman body i don't know about cars you\nknow what i mean like i know danica\npatrick like i feel disrespected even\nsaying car around\nyou know what i'm saying and so it's\njust like being able to understand like\nthat's not my domain of yes of\nexcellence or but i could learn i might\nyou know because of my experience coming\nto the card game and like i can start\nseeing stuff other people aren't seeing\nyou know like but that's not for me so i\nunderstand my strengths\nand also where i don't have any\ncredibility or experience right\nnumber one is just a principle to know\nyourself and to know\nwhat things tend to hinder you\nand i'll just share one little quick one\nbecause i saw it as a big consistent in\nmy clinical practice\none of the biggest things that hinders\npeople and getting in the progress that\nthey want is blaming others\nall right i i was literally i was right\nthere listening to them and i'm like i\ncan see after a while i could see it\ncoming out here it comes yeah you know\nif my kids were just a bit of this right\nif my husband would just if my wife\nwould just\nif my mom would just\nyou know like everybody else in their\nlife is making it harder\nright so they have this story and\nthey're gonna live and die by it\nright\nand so\nbut the thing is it's just a story and\nit doesn't mean that it's not true\nit doesn't mean that you don't\nexperience more con you know conflict or\ncurveballs in your life because of your\nlife experience\nbut listen like\nit's all about perspective you know i've\nbeen through some crazy stuff in my life\nand to be here where i am like\nthe the number one thing besides that\nmoment of decision\nis taking responsibility for my life 100\nresponsibility\nagain this is one of those things that\nyou might you don't really do that\nyou know and so that's without any\nwiggle room i had to stop pointing the\nfingers i had to stop blaming and catch\nmyself whenever i do it\nand understand even in a relationship\nconflict it's not 50 50. it's 100 100.\nbecause if there's a miscommunication\ntaking place instead of me being like\nwhy don't you understand this i can\nthink about how am i communicating this\nbecause there is a way to get through\nright but that's me taking\nresponsibility but sometimes we don't\nfeel like it you know something but also\nagain if you're physically unwell it's\nharder\nright\nso\nbeing able to um help people with that\npiece of like you've got to take\nresponsibility here stop blaming other\npeople there's a way right and what we\ndo is and this is where i can answer\nmore the question is start stacking\nconditions in your favor to make it\neasier make it automatic\nso the biggest issue today with people\nbeing able to go from where they are\nwith their health where we are severely\nsick society i mentioned 250 million\namericans overweight or obese 130\nmillion americans diabetic or\npre-diabetic 60 of americans have some\ndegree of heart disease right now\nuh 115 million americans are regularly\nsleep deprived\nupwards of 50 million americans are\nexperiencing autoimmune\ncondition and go on and on and on these\nare things that have never happened\nbefore but they've skyrocketed\ndepression all-time high adhd the list\ngoes on and on everything is worse\nand here we are again on paper we're\nsupposed to be more evolved and\nintelligent than we've ever been\nand people were like well we're living\nlonger though no\nno we're the first generation\nin recorded human history that is not\ngoing to outlive the generation before\nus it is now reversed which doesn't make\nsense it should be continuing to\nincrease but we've hit a threshold you\nknow our quality of life is suffering\nbecause\nby treating symptoms we can keep people\nalive\nand what's happening is we're not really\nliving longer we're dying longer we're\nextending the suffering\nyou know so\nhow do we get into this state and the\nsolution here the number one thing is we\nlive in a severely sick culture and so\nwe're automatically going to pick up\nwhat's happening in our environment to\nbe healthy in a severely sick society is\nvery it's weird\nyou know so right you and your wife are\nweird as hell like you guys are super\nweird and shout out to everybody else\nthat's\nthat you're weird you know and that's\nokay\nit's abnormal\nbecause normal right now is being unwell\nand so a solution here is and this is my\ngoal it's what i do this is what i\ndedicate my life to is what gets me up\nin the morning\nis to help to make a shift to where\nhealth is normalized\nright so where it's easy to have access\nto the things that make you healthy\nright now we have ease of access to\nthings that make you\nsick\nthat degrade your health that degrades\nyour mental health these are all close\nclosely accessible right\nand so\none of those things you know again being\nfrom ferguson missouri\ni was surrounded by fast food like\nabsolutely you name the place within a\nmile radius all of them are just i'm\nsurrounded by it\nand the question is why is this so cheap\nbecause that's why i bought it\nyeah the accessibility yep the the price\nand the taste of course they got food\nscientists\nbrilliant at making you addicted to the\nfoods but the cost the econ the\neconomies of scale here\nand so how is it\nthat\ni can go to mcdonald's and get three\ncheeseburgers\nfor the same amount that would cost me\nto buy one avocado yeah this avocado\nfalls off the tree like literally this\nthese cheeseburgers are so cost\nintensive to make it makes no sense\nright the bread and the processing\nthe meat the cheese the condiments not\nto mention even if we use an avocado\nversus a happy meal there's even a toy\nthe packaging right all of these things\nare so cost intensive right the market\nall of that\nthere's we don't have like beyonce doing\na thing for you know avocados like if\nyou could imagine that you know\num but\nthat's a really good point but here's\nthe thing really good if you think about\nthis like how is this possible and i\nanswered this question\nbecause i had to like i not only did i\nanswer the question but i looked at what\nis the outcome\nso\na big driver of this\nis government subsidies\nright\nso from the year 1995 to 2010 alone the\nunited states government doled out\nalmost 200 million dollars in government\nsubsidies to farmers who are growing\nthese commodity crops that largely show\nup through the drive-through window and\nin processed foods right so corn soy\nvarious forms of where sugar we can\nextract some sugar wheat of course is\nbig and by the way like if you look at a\ngrocery store most of the foods are made\nof those ingredients right some forms of\nversions of those things\nso what happened was by\ngiving this investment almost nothing\nwent to the farmers who are growing\nfruits fruits and vegetables now here's\nthe bottom line\ni came across a study and i dug i had to\nfind what is the outcome from this\nthere's got to be somebody asking this\nquestion because i'm asking it\nand i found it in the journal of the\namerican medical association one of the\nmost prestigious journals in the world\nand they looked at\nthe consumption of government subsidized\nfood and the outcomes of health in\nhumans\nright so the people who are consuming\nthe most government subsidized foods\nhad almost a 40 percent greater\nincidence of being obese\nthey had\na far higher waist circumference so\nbelly fat\nand higher levels of blood sugar\nand also degradations to their their\ninflammation so measure they use\nc-reactive protein to measure they had\nhigh rates of inflammation right so all\nof these terrible things but key thing\nalmost a 40 greater incidence of being\nobese\nby consuming the food that our\ngovernment is literally paying for to\nput into our society we're literally\nfeeding the problem and it's not okay\nand when i say the government i mean us\nbecause that money is coming from us\nbut we don't understand our authority\nwe've outsourced it to other people who\ndon't have our best interests at heart\nand so i'm in an environment\nwhere\n60 greater incidents of my aunts\nyou know\nthe my family members black women\n60 greater incidents of being obese than\na caucasian woman that's the that's the\nsociety that we're living in and it's\nthe environment right it's not that any\nof us are just by nature\nmore likely to be unhealthy\nright and so we can help to stack\nconditions to unify each other you know\nunify our communities but we've got to\nstand up for each other and not allow\nthis insanity to happen because what's\nhappening when we're feeding this\nproblem is\nthe higher rates of\nof mental\nissues of poverty it's driving more\ncrime it's driving more divisiveness\nright\nit's not our fault i didn't want to be\na quote bad person i'm an environment\nwhere it is a bigger risk for me to go\noutside and play than for another kid\nbecause i literally might die a bullet\nmight hit me\nyou know and that's again it's a it's\nnot like this is a daily thing but that\nstuff did happen\nyou know and people don't understand\nthat so you look at people and they're\nlike\njust work harder\nmy mother worked overnight at a\nconvenience store just to try again\ntrying to make ends meet\nshe was stabbed eight times by somebody\ntrying to rob the convenience store\nthese are things people often again they\ndon't they're not subjected to\nand she my mother's a really tough human\nbeing like\nit's crazy you know if you hear so many\nstories about my mom but when she she\nsubdued the guy the police came\nright she's just man she's she's kind of\na badass but she survived and subdued oh\nyeah yeah yeah so\nwhen she got to the hospital and got the\nstitches\nthe physician told her\nthat if you weren't overweight\nyou would have died\nyour your body fat saved you\nwhat do you think she's going to do that\ncognitive association\nmy fat is my savior is protecting me\nyou think she's going to do anything to\nlose his weight she's she's going to be\nmore acclimated to having more of it\nit's my protection it's my safety\nright\nshe sold her blood\nto put food on the table you know all\nthese different things you know so\nbut it's a perpetual it's the\nenvironment it's the culture\nand there is a way to transition out of\nthat but i'm\ni'm really the exception and not the\nrule like it took so many\nminor miracles for this to happen\nbut and i look back at my life it's just\nlike is there something remarkable about\nme like how did all of this happen\nand the the thing is we're all\nremarkable i just realized that i have\nsome power\ni realize that i have\ni have the ability\nto decide to think what i want to think\nand to respond the way that i want to\nrespond\nand to make choices in the world when i\nhad just been outsourcing\nall of my choices to the environment\naround me and i had this story about\nlike i can't i can't do it so\nyou know to drive that point home\na big solution here is for us to create\nconditions and we can do that we start\nwith our own culture in our own\nhousehold\nif people see my son\nfor example my son jordan 21 years old\nright now he just launched a new fitness\nprogram yesterday\nand you know i never told him to work in\nthis field but he's just in the\nenvironment\nright and so he's been personal training\nand serving i get messages from people\nwho their kids have bought this program\nlike in tears just like your son helped\nmy\ni i didn't sign up for that i had no\nidea but we created a culture\nof fitness of health\nof connection\nintentionally\nand it doesn't matter where you start\nbecause my son jordan was there with me\nin ferguson sleeping on an air mattress\nhe knows what it's like he was there\nwith me\nthrough all of it\nand so he has that perspective no matter\nwhere you are right now where no matter\nwhere your kids are at\nwe can create conditions and nobody said\nit's gonna be easy though you know\nyou're gonna there's gonna be resistance\nespecially if you've been just on the\nipad all the time or watching tv all the\ntime\nbut a solution is\nthis is to add to a solution we need to\nfill that space with something of\ngreater or equal value yeah that's the\ntrick that's right so if you can find a\nway to supplant the need to you know for\nthem to watch another show\nwith something that is you know involves\nmovement you know maybe again like and\nyou can recruit other people you\nprobably got friends in your network you\nknow like maybe there's a dance class or\nmaybe there's you know feeling blank you\nwould like the greatest gift that i have\nin my life today\nis the resources and the people that i\nhave\nright\nand i'm\na i'm a self-professed lone wolf for\nsure like i definitely had that lone\nwolf energy but now like\nevery day in my meditation practice i\nhave a little segment where i do\ngratitude and i run through\nall the you know people i'm grateful for\nand it's just like it blows my mind\noftentimes i i\nyou know i go into tears you know\nthinking about it all the wonderful\npeople\nbut\nthat even that happens by you becoming\nthe type of person that can\ninvite in that kind of energy right and\nso\none of the big tricks that i've learned\nover the years too\nfor people who are wanting you know\nblaming other people and wanting them to\nchange\nit's very difficult there's a statement\nthat you can't be a prophet in your own\nland yeah\ninvite in find other voices to do the\nthing\nso i just came back\non sunday from speaking at an event in\nmexico\nevery year it's called phenomenal life\nand it's eric

the event i'm\ngonna bring my family so they can hear\nit from them rather than from me yeah\nyeah yeah right so that's one of the\nthings i realized is just like if i have\nthe opportunity let me get the kids\nin this place even with fitness what\ntends to happen is\nif somebody's working on their fitness\nthey they leave their kids they never\nreally see them like mom goes to this\nmystical place called the gym and she\ncomes back happier and sweaty\nlike even that it's kind of freaky\nactually to think like where are you\ngoing mom uh but anyways\ngive your kids some of these inputs like\nlet them see you work out invite them in\ndo some stuff with them\nright as soon as my oldest son was old\nenough to go to gold's back in st louis\nhe was 12 years old and you know they\nlet 12 year olds in he brought him to\nthe gym with me and now like this he's a\nbeast like\nit's it's crazy you know it's just yeah\nso\nstart with your own household create a\nculture intentionally it doesn't have
