    "transcript": "you don't get to have an amazing\nrelationship with someone because of a\npromise or a commitment\nyou get to do it because you renew that\npromise and commitment on a daily weekly\nmonthly basis not because you want to\nextend the years you've been together\nbut because you want to extend the\ngrowth\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to awkward\ntherapy taboo topics uncomfortable\nconversations\nwe don't even have a name yet but we\njust know that we're doing something\nthat's uncomfortable awkward and\ndifficult but i'm doing with my dear\nfriend lewis howes who i admire i learn\nso much from who we have these\nfascinating conversations with every\nmonth\nfor hours and hours and hours and we\nfind it really useful to go back and\nforth and just dissect a topic so\ntoday's topic\nis something that i think's going to\ninterest a lot of people because we're\ntrying to ask questions that we all have\nin our heads but no one ever says out\nloud because it's kind of scary it's\nscary it's hard to talk about it's\ncontroversial especially if you're in a\nrelationship today's one is a scary one\nto ask\nand these are two men in relationships\ni've been married and with my wife for\nnearly 10 years now so that's a long\ntime you're in a relationship that\nyou're very happy with your girlfriend\nmartin and i'm so happy to see you both\nhappy but\nwe're also both reflecting on these\nthings so the question is or the\nquestion we're starting with and then\nwe'll kind of get lost in it is is it\npossible\nto be exclusive with\nand love one person\nfor your entire life for the rest of\nyour life right like that's oh we put it\nout there yeah yeah and we want to\nencourage you to have this conversation\nso you know with people at work with\npeople at home maybe not with your\npartner\nmaybe maybe with your partner maybe\nthat's a good thing it's important to\ntalk yeah we want to encourage you to\nshare this with one person that you\nthink would be interesting to have this\nconversation with maybe that is your\npartner a friend or whatever maybe your\nparents maybe your parents and listen to\nthis share this conversation with one\nperson\nand set a time to have a discussion\nabout what you heard what you liked\nmaybe what you didn't like from this\nconversation\nand and share with us in the comments\nbelow in this channel\nwhat was the most interesting thing or\nwhat you'd add to this i think that'd be\nuseful for people yeah i love that and\nand by the way the reason why this is\ncalled awkward therapy is both me and\nlouis\nnot therapists we're not we're trying to\nfigure life out and we believe that\nhaving open and honest conversations\nhelp us do that because you get to hear\nthings from another perspective\nand you get to just think about\nsomething for a lot longer than like the\nsecond you make decisions so anyway i\nmean let's dive in i think so what's the\nanswer can you do that yeah\nwell i first think of when we grew up\nyeah\nwe watched a lot of movies\nthat would portray this fantasy or this\nideal let's call it\nthat you you find the prince or the\nprincess you marry and it's happily ever\nafter\nand then in the real world things happen\npeople move town you get an opportunity\nfor work somewhere you have to do long\ndistance and there's challenges\nthere was a breakup that someone had\nand they're still lingering in the new\nconversation or they're talking to their\nex or things just happen in life or\nyou're just on instagram and you get\ndistracted by and you think that\neveryone else is better than the\nrelationship you have there's all these\nshiny opportunities right or these\ndifferent people that could bring you\nmore joy or love than in the current\nrelationship\nand you and i both have\nfriends that are in let's call it open\nrelationships\ni guess you call it polyamory right\nwhere they have multiple partners you\nhave one main partner and you have\nmultiple relationships\nand we both know people that have been\nmarried for a long time\ndecades\nwho are happily married and we both know\npeople that have been married for\ndecades and are unhappily married and so\ni guess where do we start\ni mean i i think what you said uh\nsparked something for me like i grew up\nas a hopeless romantic\nbased on movies and music so i always\nbelieved that there's the one and i\nwanted this big romantic relationship\nand i loved like flowers and like poetry\nand\nlong walks and surprises and gifts\nbecause i bought into what hollywood\nshowed me so for me i think for a long\nperiod of my life\ni believe that love was what i saw in\nthe movies and i know that sounds\nridiculous\nbut\nin my teens i would say that was\nmassively what i saw and i always watch\namerican movies so people getting asked\nout to prom or like was like a big deal\nin american movies or whether it was\nlike finding that\none person who's gonna solve everything\nright\nand then you start recognizing that oh\nwait a minute i had a few relationships\nthat looked like that on the outside but\nthen they didn't feel that way well wait\na minute i've had a few breakups now oh\nwait a minute like i thought this person\nwas the one but they weren't\nand then you start recognizing now that\ni've been in a long relationship\nlong-term relationship you start\nrealizing love looks completely\ndifferent\nand so i think for me the way i address\nthis or the way i think about this is\nthat first of all you have to define\nwhat love means to you\nand what you want love to be for some\npeople they just want love to feel like\nattraction desire situation desire\nand if that's how you define love\nchances are you're going to want a new\nperson every month or every year because\ndesire or that type of\nchemical desire explosiveness\nfades eventually the study showed that\ntoo and i'm not saying that you can't\nhave desire for someone i know i know\none couple has been married for like 30\nyears and they would still say they have\nthat and i love it i think the desire\nyeah there's different levels of desire\nthere's like a conscious healthy desire\nwhere you admire respect you're inspired\nby and that creates that chemistry and\nthat\nwhether you want to call it sexual\ndesire or whatever desire you create\nyour intimacy in a relationship but the\nexplosive like unhealthy desire i feel\nlike only comes when you're\nkind of trauma bonding each other like\nearly on right you see something and\nyou're like i want that but then there\nwas never like a foundation of\nvalues what you really want in your life\ntogether agreements you know this\nconscious conversation around\nbeing a couple yes yes and i would say\none thing you said which is really\ninteresting to me because i think it's\nanother societal narrative is that the\ndesire fades and really what we both\nknow is that desire deepens\nlike it becomes about deeper absolutely\nand so it's not that it goes away it's\njust that it evolves but if you are only\ninto that initial desire and i i\nremember for a long time i mean my\ngreatest joy\ncame from the pursuit and the chase and\nthe conquest pre-monk life yeah yeah\nyeah i got a lot yeah three monk life so\ni got a lot of joy\nout of wanting to see\nif i could get someone like that was the\nmindset yeah because that was the\nmindset that i was brought up in now of\ncourse when i look back at this i don't\nbelieve in that as a value i don't think\ni don't think women or anyone has\nsomething to get but i think growing up\nas a teenager who wasn't exposed to any\nform of wisdom or insight you grow up\nwith that mentality of like you're only\ntrying to prove it to yourself that's or\nyou're or you're like buddies or\nsomething to be like oh this person's\ninto me or look what you know which\nultimately is you trying to prove to\nyourself that you are worthy so that\nyour friends respect you absolutely and\nso now you're going out to obtain this\nthing so how long were you doing that up\nuntil like how old were you when you\nstopped the chase\n21 like 20 21 better man than me\nbetter man than me what i realized um\nwas that there was a lot of fun to the\nchase right they're so fun it's like\nthis addictive\ndrug\nis like\nthere is someone out there\nthat i'm attracted to or has something\nthat i want or i want to be in in\ncontact with them whether that's a\nrelationship or\na hookup or whatever it might be right\nand then\nthe the attempt to go after\ni guess accomplishing this feat\nis\nlike a drug it is like this chemical\ndrug that makes you kind of obsessive\nabout it right until you get it and then\nwhen you get it from a place that is\nunconscious it never was fulfilling or\nrewarding for me right and it was\ncreating a foundation from something\nthat wasn't based on values vision\nlifestyle things like that\nthat never worked out for me it was\nnever\nhealthy it might have been fun for six\nmonths there might have been some good\nintentions here and there but it never\nlong term worked out because\nthere wasn't a foundation of conscious\nrelationship being developed yeah i\nthink that's what you did with roddy\nlike when you got out of the the monk\nlife\nand you started the relationship with\nroddy you guys started from the\nbeginning what you told me is about here\nare my values here's my mission i'm on a\nmission to be impactful and serve\nhumanity this is the type of marriage i\nwant to create this is the type of life\ni want to have this is the some of the\nstuff i remember you telling me\ni think going into a relationship with\nconscious conversations is probably one\nof the only ways to set yourself up to\nwin for a lifetime together right yeah\nif you want that if you want to be a\nwife and i know a lot of i know a lot of\npeople who say to me well i enjoyed the\nchase in the pursuit like i did and you\npretty much want a new person every\nmonth yeah right for men at least or men\nthat i know where you kind of can get\nbored quickly\nsomeone entertains you for a few months\nand then after that you need something\nnew you need a chase again and you need\nthe chase again and the drug again which\nis a great definition and you keep\nmoving and moving and moving and then\nthe individual has to decide i think the\nchoice is do i want a long-term\nrelationship or do i not\nand there are gifts and pain points in\nboth yes like there are really exciting\namazing things about dating someone new\nevery few months and there are really\npainful parts about it absolutely and\nthen there's loads of amazing things\nabout being with someone for a long\namount of time or at least long for me\nis 10 years because that's the longest\ni've ever done with someone\nbut then there are loads of challenging\nparts about that and i think everyone\njust has to know\nwhat type of life they're signing up for\nand that's why we're having this\nconversation because\ni don't think that\nyou have to love\none person for the rest of your life i\ndon't think someone should be forced to\nbelieve that's the only way life works\nespecially because some people dedicate\ntheir life to someone then that person\nleaves them\nwhether naturally or unnaturally someone\nleaves them because there's infidelity\nor whatever they may be and the point is\nthat\nyou can't force someone to say there is\nonly one person and i think\noften the institutions of the world\nmarriage and religion often kind of\nenforced people to believe that well you\ngot married at 21 you've got to be with\nthis person for the rest of your life or\nyou're a failure correct or you made\nmistakes or you something something's\nwrong with you yeah i think that's one\nof the things why people stay in a\nrelationship for\nway too long\nbecause they don't want to be something\na make a mistake or something wrong with\nthem so they try and try and try to make\nit work\nand maybe they could have made it work\nbut they just weren't in alignment or\nsomething but a lot of people i think\nare in shame when they get a divorce or\nthey're in guilt or they're in sadness\nfor this loss because\nit didn't work out they weren't who they\nthought they were\nsomething happened right it's a lot i've\nseen people have been to divorce it's\nnot fun any just a breakup is not fun\neven if you got married or not people go\nthrough breakups and struggle for a long\ntime it seems like so relationships can\nbe messy for sure yeah but what i have\ndiscovered in\none year of of\na relationship therapy yeah well one and\na half years of intense therapy\nstarting a relationship this has been\nsomething that i've never done but for\nthe last\n10 years i've wanted to start a\nrelationship in therapy and me and\nmartha started that when we first\nstarted kind of hanging out we weren't\nreally dating for the first few months\nwe just kind of hanging out and\nshe was dating other people i was dating\nother people and or just kind of out in\nthe world when we started\ngetting more serious about it i was like\nlisten\ni've always wanted to do this\nand i think it's a deal breaker if we\ndon't do this\nbecause i just want to make sure that we\nare setting ourselves up for success in\nterms of\npeace joy and for me success in a\nrelationship is two individuals\nindependently living their lives and\nsharing their lives together\nlike she's gone for a couple weeks\nworking on a project in a movie right\nnow and i'm in los angeles doing my\nthing i know with you and your wife she\nmight be gone or you might be traveling\nand sometimes you're doing it together\nand sometimes depart and having the\nfreedom and flexibility to be yourself\nand also be in the relationship i think\nthat's for me what is success at this\nseason of my life yeah maybe in 10 years\nit'll look like something different yeah\nand i think that's the point right like\nseeing life is seasons because\nyou have to ask the question like why do\nwe think or why have you in this season\ndecided to be exclusive to one person\nand i think often we do that\nsubconsciously i don't think everyone\nintentionally\nthinks\ni feel i'm ready\nfor a long-term relationship now i don't\nthink we do that i think we assume that\nat one point you're meant to kind of get\ninto one and settle down rather than the\nconscious choice or you're consciously\navoiding that yeah and you're going no\nno no the last thing i want to do is get\nmarried or settle down or be in a\nlong-term relationship and so for me\nit's like everyone has to sit there and\nlook in the mirror and go\nwhy do i want either right now what\nserves me\nand what serves my vision and what\nserves what i'm trying to do that's what\nit is i think when you go back to what\nis my vision for my life and what do i\nreally want what will support that\nvision the highest level if you're a\nsingle guy\nand your vision is to you know be really\nfocused on your mission and your\nbusiness and growth and your health\nand if you're spreading your energy\naround 10 different women you're dating\nat once over a year or something or\nhowever many you want to date\nthere is a lot of excitement to that\nlifestyle but then you have to unwind\nand essentially you know reject every\nperson that you're not going to be with\nyeah so there's like this unwinding\nthere's this\nhurt phase it's just phase where you're\nyou know having challenging\nconversations and\ndetaching from that intimacy of those\nconnections and that's a lot of energy\nit's a lot of effort that's pulling you\nfrom your health or your other\nrelationships or building something\ndeeper and more meaningful when you have\n10 service level relationships as\nopposed to one deeper i have different\nfriends who have tried the whole\npolyamory thing who have had multiple\npartners at the same time who've had one\nperson and then other people on the side\nand i've never met\none man who has\nsuccessfully i mean had peace in her\nlife let's say consistently\nover years doing that there might be a\nyear or two where yeah it seems\nmanageable yeah but then it's like\nthere's always a breakdown yeah i've\ni've coached people and worked with\npeople in that space and\ni've just found that it's hard enough\nwith one person's emotions yes\nthan to deal with two and this is what\nwe do as humans which i find really\ninteresting is that\nwe make everything extreme so we're so\nscared of co-dependency\nso therefore we go to polyamory yeah\ncause we're like i don't want to be\ndependent on one person so instead of\nfiguring out the trauma as to why i\nbecome codependent and instead of\npurifying and figuring out what it is\nthat makes me codependent i just believe\nthat an external shell of being in a\npolyamorous relationship will solve that\nthat's often the mindset of people that\ni've met i'm not saying that that's the\nonly reason i'm not saying that yeah\nplease haters in the comments and the\ntrolls like i'm not saying this is the\nonly reason and that's i'm just saying\nthat the people i've spoken to they've\nsaid to me that they were scared of\nbeing codependent so they believed if\nthey had more partners then they\nwouldn't be codependent yeah or they'd\nget the excitement that they were\nmissing in their relationship they\nwanted the relationship that would give\nthem support and peace and structure\nbut if they were missing excitement okay\nlet me go find the excitement somewhere\nelse yeah and for me that made a lot of\nsense\nin my 20s\nthinking that way because i was just\nlike oh i don't know if you could do\nthis with one person for a long time\nthat was probably one of my biggest\nfears that i would be in love with\nsomeone or love someone consciously but\nthat\nsexual desire that exciting feeling that\nhappens in the first whatever three to\nsix nine months\ni wouldn't have with the person once i\nwas married with them when i'd feel\ntrapped yeah i had to really heal a lot\nof things from childhood that built that\nscript or narrative\nto\nto realize that it's possible\nwith conscious effort to create\nconnection chemistry desire with one\nperson if they're the right person in\nalignment also doing the conscious work\nyeah and that's where i said like\ni need to start therapy so that we have\nagreements so i can feel peaceful\nto be myself my full expression and dive\ninto the relationship with curiosity and\nfun and excitement and desire in the\nrelationship\nand so far it's been extraordinary\nin the process of therapy before\nproblems yeah absolutely i don't know if\nthis is something that you guys did or\nif you did something like that where you\nhad conscious conversations about kids\nor what happens with money and all these\ndifferent things before marriage was\nthat something and i don't think they\nhave a stop but there's important ones\nto have before\nand and before i get there i think\nthere's one thing about the um\nthat i wanted to mention about polyamory\nis that it's it's not that\nbasically there's no external shell\nthat's going to solve your internal\ntrauma and pain so whether you're with\none person or whether you're with three\nor two or four people neither of those\nare the cure like you can't say to\nsomeone like being with one person and\nbeing married to them is the cure for\nyour pain and trauma or that if you have\ntwo people then you won't be codependent\nlike that doesn't solve it sure and so\nyou've got to figure out what is it\nagain that i really want and so for me\nand rather like i all i can ever do\nis be honest about where i'm at and what\ni want at that time in this moment in\nthis moment because that's going to\nchange what if you made a promise uh\nyour wedding day about 10 years and\nthat's why i don't think it's a promise\ni think it's an ongoing conversation yes\nthat is always changing and evolving\nit's not a commitment or a promise it's\nnot saying i am definitely up for this\nit's saying i am open to this\ni'm considering this or i'm close to\nthis this is not what i want so so if\nsomeone knows they don't want to have\nchildren but they never talk about that\nwith someone who they know wants to have\nchildren because you're scared of\nraising that that's unhealthy because\nthat is going to come up one day\nor if your desire long term is to live\nin another city or country but you've\nnot made someone aware that that's what\nyou're considering and so i don't think\nthis is about this is what i want and\nthis is my promise it's more just saying\nthis is kind of how i imagine my life\nright like this is kind of how i think\nabout it things change things involved\npeople change and all these different\nthings i think patrick bet david said\nthis i can't remember where he said this\nbut i believe he said like every year\naround new year's or christmas i think\nthis was him where he says he and his\nwife get together and say we want to do\nthis for one more year yeah yeah and\nwhat worked this year what didn't work\nhow can we make it better and do we want\nto do this for one more year as opposed\nto for the rest of our lives like\nthinking all the way 50 years away yeah\ncan seem kind of daunting yeah for some\npeople i think that's an interesting\napproach and i think it could be like\nyou know every day\nwhat are we grateful for was there\nsomething that was\noff today that we can address so that it\nalways is improving and growing in a\nconversation of\nof growth\nevery day once a week once a month every\nyear like be having the conversation is\nthe key i think making a lifelong\ndecision\nis a recipe for failure\nwhat is it anything forget loving\nanother person\nwhat could you say that you're going to\ndo\nevery day for the rest of your life\napart from shower and brush your teeth\nyou can breathe and breathe like what is\nthere that you could truly say hand on\nyour heart that you know you'll be able\nto maintain i don't think there's\nanything so to\ncreate that promise\nreally starts and and i do something\nsimilar more regularly with raleigh\nwhere i always check in with writing and\nbe like is this the relationship you\nwant\nis this going in the direction you want\nthat's a great question is it going in\nthe way i want because if it isn't are\nwe willing to change\nand if we're not willing to change then\nwhere does this go\nand i think doing that regularly\nevery couple of weeks every month every\nthree months every quarter turn it into\na thoughtful process to me that's really\nhealthy because it gives you the\nincremental intricate moments to say\nokay well i don't like how this is going\nand there were days in our relationship\ncertain years where i said to rodney\nlike i'm like this is not the\nrelationship i want really and this is\nwhat i'm willing to do for it to change\nare you willing to do this was that hard\nfor her to hear that i think this is\nafter you're married this is after we're\nmarried i i think that\nwe\nestablished those awkward conversations\nand uncomfortable conversations early\nand so\nit's continued to be easy to have them\nbut what i found is just the realness of\na human\noften her response will be well i need\nto think about that like i don't know\ni'm unaware i'm not sure\nand that requires patience and that\nrequires weighting and so many other\nuncomfortable feelings\nbut you have to my point is if you don't\ndo that you're basically living a life\nfor years and years and years and i\nalways find this fascinating that when\nsomeone gets divorced or when someone\nbreaks up everyone's surprised apart\nfrom those two people they're like us\nhave been two years in the making\nbecause they know what's going on right\nand people may be shocked and they may\nnot be happy with it\nbut really deep down you know you've\njust been going along with the default\nand so\ni find that having that conversation\nmore regularly allows you to pivot\nor for some people part yes but i don't\nthink if you don't have that\nconversation then the pivot or the part\nis less likely my therapist but also\nmartha and i are doing individual and\nthen together at certain times right\nwhich has been extremely helpful to have\nseparation as well where i can just\ncontinue to heal on my healing journey\nfrom my own stuff she can do her own\nwork and then we can do relationship\nwork together\nit's really beautiful experiences what\nour therapist and coach says is\nrelationships should be about\nhigh engagement low attachment you know\nhigh engagement\nand she's like that's the hardest thing\nto do that's like the ultimate challenge\nis high engagement low attachment and a\nlot of times in my past speaking for\nmyself\nit was high engagement high attachment\nor low engagement high attachment to the\nresult to it working out and kind of\ngiving in and abandoning myself just to\nlike try to make it work\nand when i learned\nhow to heal from a lot of different\nstuff from previous relationships and\njust learn how to heal my own childhood\nwounds\nit was easier for me to make decisions\nand be less attached to the result and\njust say this is my vision this is the\ntype of relationship i want so with\nmartha and me early on i was like\nhere is my vision here are my values\nhere's the lifestyle i want to have\nfor at least the foreseeable next few\nyears and yeah the next five to ten\nyears what i my intention is by coming\nfrom that space i was completely clear\nand i was like there's a lot of things\nyou may not like what i'm about to say\nbut i'm going to tell you 100 the truth\ni'm not going to give in on my truth and\ni'm not going to sacrifice\nif you want me to change a bunch of\nthings because it doesn't make you\nhappy then we're just not in alignment\nyeah thankfully she loved all the things\nabout my values vision and lifestyle\nmoving forward it's also kind of\nrevealing all the things i'm not proud\nof from the past it's like oh this is\nhow i was in this relationship and this\nrelationship and i had to learn a lot\nand and revealed that as well to not act\nlike i'm the perfect one\nit allowed for more of a conscious\nfoundation to be started\nin our you know year of experience where\nyou've had 10 years right 10 years\nyou've been together next year will be\n10 years so i've had i don't know 10\nfailed relationships in my my lifetime\nyou've had 10 years of a beautiful\nrelationship\nuh and\nyou've had different things that you\nsaid in the first few years where you\nsaid\nthis isn't the type of relationship\nwhere i want it to be like it needs to\nthat's not what i'm was into and it's\ngoing in a different direction than what\ni wanted\nwhat would you say for me\nthe biggest thing that i've learned was\ngoing into a new relationship healing\nthe wounds of the past or being on the\nhealing journey\nand having conscious conversations early\nyeah and starting in therapy when there\nwere no problems\nhas been extremely helpful for me yeah\nin one year yeah what would you say a\nten year\nhas been extremely helpful for you that\nyou also wish you did yeah in the first\nyear or maybe you did do it and you're\nstill doing it yeah i i think it's the\ncontinuation it's like\nwhen you plant a seed you water it and\nyou make sure you have sunlight and you\nmake sure the soil is good when it\nbecomes a tree you still do all of those\nthings you don't you don't stop watering\nit you don't just stop right like you\ndon't stop like just caring for it the\ncare might evolve and change like you\ndon't need to water a tree in the same\nway because it's it's roots there but\nyou can't be completely negligent i\nthink the challenge we've created in\nsociety is that we believe that a long\nrelationship is a successful one\nand really my definition of a\nrelationship is are we growing together\nare we thriving together and are we\nlearning from each other yes and if we\nsay one more time are we are we growing\ntogether are we thriving together and\nare we learning from each other if i'm\nnot doing that with you anymore\nthen if we're not and then the question\nis are you willing to change something\nin order to do that and if you're not\nand i think you have to be\ni think the challenge is and i've heard\nyou talk about this i think the\nchallenge is no matter how long a\nrelationship gets you have to be open to\nthe fact\nthat\nyou could get to a point with someone\nwhere there's no more growth no more\nlearning and no more thriving and that's\nthat low attachment yes he's recognizing\nthat just as in a business relationship\nyou wouldn't stay in business with\nsomeone if you weren't growing together\nyou weren't thriving together and you\nweren't learning together yeah and you\nwant to keep your business open if you\nwere in the negative year after year you\nweren't having fun\nyou didn't see opportunities for growth\nyou were in an industry that\nwas eliminating uh year after year you'd\nbe like okay maybe this had its season\ncorrect and it's time to\nfind a new business to work in i'm just\nnot saying you need to say well maybe\nthis person's had its season or this and\nthis but\ngoing back to the original conversation\ncan you be with one person for the rest\nof your life can you love one person for\nthe rest of your life\nand\nit'd be a healthy overall healthy\nenriching relationship and again i think\nabout a successful relationship where\neach individual is putting a hundred\npercent into their own personal\ndevelopment and growth and mission and\nputting a hundred percent into making\nthe relationship\nhealthy\nconscious\njoyful and that takes a lot of\nindividual work yeah 100 on each\nindividual to want to grow and develop\nyeah and if not then it's going to be\nthere's going to be challenges yeah and\ni think there's something that esther\nperel said probably on both of our shows\nwhich is\nthere's a love story and there's a life\nstory and there's a lot of people you\ncan have a love story with right where\nyou could\nfall in love with or date and have these\nromantic nights and these adventures but\nthey may not be part of your life story\nthey may not have your values your\nvision the lifestyle you want to have in\nyour life if a lot of those things don't\nline up then maybe you're they're just a\nseasonal love story\nnot a longer season\nlife story yeah there's probably\nlesser people that could be a life story\nyes\nyeah and so i i don't i don't think that\nthere's\none person that you could be with for\nthe rest of life because you know again\nsomething could happen in a partnership\nwhere\nuh if someone leaves this world then\nyou're just gonna say for the rest of my\nlife i'm not gonna be in another\nrelationship\nlike there's there might be a situation\nor if the relationship has just had its\nseason i agree and\nthe person's not willing to keep working\nand investing in it\nit's like\nthat's tough and i just think that's\nokay and you're in therapy and there's\nlike no i just don't care about the\nrelationship anymore so the other\nperson's supposed to stay attached and\ngive a hundred percent when the other\nperson's giving zero percent for a year\nand year and year i don't think that's\nthe type of life that we were designed\nto live yes just to show up because we\nmade this a commitment to an attachment\ni guess but\nbut that's controversial to say because\nwhen you make a commitment to marriage\nwe should try the intention should be to\nstay married that should be the\nintention\nbut if one person is unwilling to and\nthey keep breaking their commitment and\nthey're not willing to get back on track\nor they do things over and over that are\nhurtful and they don't apologize and\ntake responsibility they don't take\naccountability i don't think over a\nperiod of time someone needs to abandon\nthemselves\nto be taken advantage of and abused and\nused\nand someone breaking their promise and\ntheir commitments of course not and and\nthat's one of the biggest issues with\nsetting a commitment at an early stage\nin life\nwhen we're immature or like 18 20 when\nyou don't even know yourself and you\nmake these massive promises and i just\nagain i go back to that like where else\nin your life do you make a decision for\nthe rest of your life for 50 60 70 years\nand so\nif you do want that with someone make\nsure that you are checking in regularly\nthat you're renewing that like you're\nreconnecting with each other regularly\nbecause you don't get to have an amazing\nrelationship with someone because of a\npromise or a commitment\nyou get to do it because you renewed\nthat promising commitment on a daily\nweekly monthly basis not because you\nwant to extend the years you've been\ntogether but because you want to extend\nthe growth and so for me i think i i\nagree with you that no one should feel\nforced\nand really what marriage is or what\nexclusivity is or what commitment is is\nwe're going to try\nto grow together\ncontinuously and i would rather choose\nto grow with you\nthan to grow in many different ways it's\na conscious choice and i think listen\nneither of us have kids yet yeah and so\ni can already see all the comments of\npeople saying well wait till you have\nkids and you don't know what it's like\nwhen you have kids you have to sacrifice\nand give up so much\nand i think that's a great excuse for\npeople and i think it's a valid excuse\nbut i think it's an excuse that holds\npeople back as well and i know\na lot of married people with kids who\nare thriving who are having fun every\nday or consistently\nwho are enjoying their lives who live\nindependently in the marriage as well\nand have their own time and flexibility\ntrust all those things\nand\nyear after year they thrive with kids so\nagain there are going to be more and\nmore challenges and that's why it's\nimportant for each individual to do the\nwork consistently independent of the\nrelationship yeah to just become better\nhumans yeah more emotionally involved\nemotionally intelligent work on healing\nwhatever is triggering you work on that\nhealing journey so that you're not as\nreactive with your partner or life yeah\nyou're not bringing baggage to the\nrelationship you're more having a\nconscious conversation in the\nrelationship yeah\nlike you said when we make those\ndecisions at 21 or whenever or just\nearly 30 or even at 40. like i i was\ntelling martha this the other day i was\nlike i don't know if i would have gotten\nmarried there's no way i'd be in a\nrelationship if i got married at 25 27\n29 there's just no way because i've\nhad to go through so much inner\nchallenges to overcome in the last\ndecade alone\nthat just now at 39 do i feel like i\nfinally figured out how to have peace\ninside yeah consistently yeah i would\nhave messed up any relationship totally\nwithout knowing the tools\non on how to just navigate and it\ndoesn't mean i'm going to be perfect in\nthis relationship for the rest of my\nlife or whatever but i'm probably going\nto make mistakes but i feel like i have\na better awareness of self yeah at 25 27\n30 it's like\nthat's hard i don't know how you did it\n10 years ago yeah i mean nearly 10 years\nit was yeah it was next year would be\nten years but you had four years of\nmonth training where you were just\nthere's i mean there's a bit of\neverything right like there's the\nthere was some maturity but now when i\nlook back i go i there was also parts of\nit that were luck and when i say luck i\nmean\nuniversal\ndivine intervention and like i was\nfortunate that it was rally there were\nlots of parts of it where it was like\noh like\nactually i wasn't as mature as i thought\nbut it somehow happened that we were\ncompatible too and you know there's she\nwas healthy in a certain way that\nsupported it correct and that's there's\na lot of fortune in that too like i\ndon't think it's it's not fair for me to\nsay that it was all didactic and\nperfectly like masterminded because i\nwas so advanced that's that's not true i\nthink there was some maturity but there\nwas also a lot of immaturity but that\ngot balanced out by some of her gifts\nand and i think the point is that\nyou just can't ever be scared to look in\nthe mirror you can't be scared to ask\nthose questions you can't ever stop\ndoing that because that's where it all\ngoes wrong i think\nthat i have grown\nmore significantly\nbeing committed to one woman\nthan i would have if i wasn't so that's\nmy best if you would have been single\nfor the last 10 years correct and\nsay\nsingle or having different\nsurface level relationships not being\ncommitted to one person for 10 years\nwhere would you be in your life right\nnow if you could just hypothetically\nyeah and i don't think it's an external\nsuccess or metric of some sort of\nfinancial or you know\nphysical\nsituation it's more that i believe that\nbeing in a committed relationship\nhas taught me skills and qualities\nthat i wouldn't have\nif i wasn't so i'll give an example yeah\none of my favorite ones\nis\nthe ability\nto self-validate as opposed to the other\nperson giving you validation correct so\ni believe that if i was single for the\npast 10 years\ni would have used other people to\nvalidate myself because i would have\nbeen able to go to different people for\ndifferent forms of validation someone\ntelling me jay you're this you're that\nwhatever it is\nwhen you're committed to one person\nchances are they don't validate you\nsometimes well at least in my case and\nthat trained me in the ability to go\ninward and validate myself\nfor what i care about myself yeah i'm\nassuming roddy's not intentionally not\nvalidating you but you're just\nin life in conversation and you know you\nyou wanted something but maybe she\nwasn't being aware of it or whatever\nright yeah the point is you don't get to\njust solve it by going and finding it\nsomewhere else of course and so i think\nthat's what i mean that a lot of the\ntime when you don't get what you want\nfrom one person you can just go find a\nfix somewhere else but that stops you\nfrom growing in doing it for yourself so\nthat's one of the big ones yeah another\none that i would say that i only got\nthrough being in a committed\nrelationship\nwas the\nrecognition that\neffort\nand contribution to a relationship was\nnot always visible so what i mean by\nthat is often in a relationship we think\nof the breadwinner or the person who\npays the bills as being the way someone\ncontributes\nor if someone cleans and cooks that's\nthe way someone contributes\nwhen you get into a relationship for a\nlong time you start to realize there are\nemotional contributions to a\nrelationship absolutely there are\nspiritual contributions to a\nrelationship which you don't get to see\nwhen your relationship is purely\nphysical right and so now when i look at\nrelationships i'm like wow like\nradhi is contributing to this\nrelationship of course financially in\nthat but also in this spiritual and\nemotional way yes and in my\nlimited understanding if i was just\nmoving around i wouldn't know if that\nwas even possible so i think i mean\nthose are just a couple there's so many\nbut i believe that i have grown more and\nlearned more about myself\nthan i would have if i wasn't because i\nthink i would have found a quick fix for\nmost my problems oh everything if it was\nlike\nyou know if i was just jumping from\nrelationship to relationship\nor just dating and not actually being\ncommitted to anyone\nwhen there was a moment of anything\ngetting hard you just be like i don't\nwant to deal with this i'm going to go\nto the next person and have fun and just\nmake it light and make it interesting\nand go after the chase and get that that\nhigh again\nwhen i started the relationship with\nmartha i made a conscious decision\nrealizing that i was the problem for\nevery previous relationship that i was\nthe common denominator for things not\nworking out i said let me try something\ndifferent let me not dive into what i've\nalways done which is the sexual\nchemistry first\nbecause that clouded my mind from seeing\nthe person fully or seeing more of the\nperson i should say\nand that decision to remove that for the\nfirst you know\nmonths of us kind of seeing each other\nand getting to know each other\nwas so powerful for me because i was\nlike do i want to be i remember asking\nsome friends in the past i go if you\nguys didn't have sex would you still be\ntogether and a lot of them are like no\nokay so remove sex from the relationship\nor move sexual chemistry from the\nrelationship would you want to spend\nquality time with this person\nconsistently are you adding value to\ntheir their life are they adding value\nto your life another person said\nyou know could you spend ten thousand\nmeals with this person\nbecause that's what it's gonna be like\nif you're getting married and you're\nwith them for a long time ten thousand\nmeals isn't interesting enough\nand when we\njump into from my personal experience\nwhen you jump into sexual chemistry\nfirst the foundation is usually a little\nshakier\nand also if you're doing that with\nmultiple people\nit's hard to build a strong foundation\nwith one and you're never really getting\nthat piece it's kind of there's always\nsomething shaky yeah right you know yeah\nwell i mean that's i mean the studies\nshow that too that when you engage in a\nphysical relationship with someone the\nchemicals that are released after sex\nmake you feel closer to them when you're\nnot actually closer to the 100 so you\nhaven't really done the work for deep\nvalue-based intimacy\nbut you're feeling the high\nchemically and you could feel that with\npeople again and again and again and\nthat's why we get more attached to\npeople that we have sex with in that way\nand so\nfor me obviously through the monk\ntraining like that was a big part of it\ni mean celibacy was a huge part of monk\ntraining and it was all for mental\nclarity so you can make better decisions\nright it's not about saying that you're\nnever having sex it's about the idea\nthat can i make better decisions without\nbeing clouded from without actually\nby a chemical release that is making me\nbelieve something and i think that's\nwhat people don't that's what people\nunderestimate is that do you want to\nmake a decision based on reality or do\nyou want to make a decision based on\nchemicals that are being\nexposed to you in a particular moment\nwhich aren't reality and i think\neveryone would hold their hand up anyone\nwho's in the comments section right now\nlike would say i have been in a\nrelationship where we had a terrible\nrelationship but the sex was great i\nthink everyone would agree that they've\nbeen in a relationship and whenever\nthere was an argument we leaned on sex\nand got back to like yeah to a\nfoundation right yeah exactly and and\nthey know that that was toxic and\nunhealthy because they dealt with pain\nthey dealt with abuse they dealt with\nmanipulation they dealt with trauma\nbecause the sex was good right and\nthat's why i think if you eliminate that\nat least in the beginning of a new\nrelationship\nto learn that you're gonna learn to make\nbetter decisions mental clarity like you\nsaid is this person's behavior matching\ntheir words\ndo they have the same values that i have\nare we in alignment on a lot of these\nthings that we want or do they do\ncertain things that i'll just never want\nto be around\nfor me\nit was very important like i've never\nbeen drunk in my life it's not something\ni do\nbut i can be around it it's just like\nit's i don't want to be around it all\nthe time yeah you know what i mean like\nif you want to have wine once a month\nlike i'm cool with that if you're\ndrinking every night three glasses of\nwine\nit's just a deal break it's just not for\nme and there might be something that uh\nyou know\nin the past if i if a person wanted to\nbe with me but i was like well i eat\nsugar all day that'd be a deal-breaker\nfor them or something or whatever it is\nyeah and it's figuring out like what are\nthe things in alignment\nthat you both want to see if you can be\nin a great relationship to see if you\ncan be in a thriving relationship\nbecause human beings are just\nmessed up yeah yeah and if you're trying\nto be like obviously if you're just\nsomeone who's like i just wanna sleep\naround yeah you know\nmess around have fun whatever sure\nthat's fine but if you're in the\nposition in your life right now where\nyou're like i want to be in a long-term\nrelationship then it's a healthy thing\nto consider yes because you want to have\nyour best decision-making capabilities\nand i also think a lot of people are\ngetting into relationships when they\nfeel lonely yeah that is a scary thing\nto do you'll be seeking out a\nrelationship because you feel alone\none of the greatest gifts i gave myself\nwas learning how to go take myself out\non a date go to dinner go to lunch go to\na movie alone\nand learn to enjoy my own company it was\nso hard to do because i didn't enjoy my\ncompany for so long i had too many\nnegative conversations with myself and i\nhad to learn how to love myself in a\nconscious way in a healthy way\nso that i could be happy alone first yes\nand then\nnot abandon myself in a relationship and\nit's like when the point when i was like\ngod i don't want to be in a relationship\nthat's when martha showed up i was like\nyou know i'm good i'm like so happy\nalone i love my life i've got my\nbusiness i got my friends i am good\nthat's when she came in i was like damn\nit i don't want to be around you right\nnow but it's but i can do it because i\ncan i have low attachment yeah from the\nbeginning and i don't need this\nto make me happy yes i think a lot of\npeople get into relationships because\nthey need that to make them feel\ncomplete happy\nand i think that's also a foundation of\nstruggle when we come from that space\nyeah the reason why what you said is so\nimportant is that that doesn't stop\nwhen you move in with someone\nso\ni think we feel that and and i think\nthis is a pressure that's created in\nrelationships especially in the early\ndays where people expect to spend all\ntheir time together and if you're\nspending all your time together then\nwhere is the time to grow independently\nso that you can improve each other's\nlives and so if every night you go home\nand you put a show on together and you\nwatch it and that's your way of spending\ntime together you're not investing in or\ngrowing the relationship and then three\nmonths down the line you're wondering\nwhy don't we feel any chemistry or any\nspark or any compatibility because you\nboth haven't grown independently so you\nhaven't been able to grow together and\nso that's not something that stops that\ngoing on a date on your own or treating\nyourself that never stops and it\nshouldn't stop and i think one of the\nbiggest challenges is is that people say\nwell if you don't want to spend time\nwith me if we're together then that\nmeans there's something wrong\nand so there's this insecurity that if\nyou don't want to spend every moment\nwith me\nthen you don't think i'm good enough or\nif you don't text me\nevery single moment when we're not a\npartner oh my gosh that means that you\ndon't love me bring me back flashbacks\nnow yeah\nand it's like and when you live in that\nit's like well wait a minute you've\nmissed the point that if they're always\nwith you then they can't bring anything\nto you yeah i've heard a couple\ndifferent people talk about this concept\ni think esther perel was one of them and\nthen rob bell\ntalks about the space in between the\ntime you're together is where you the\nlove deepens\nit's like you can deepen it when you\nhave space apart from each other\nand you can miss each other you can\nthink about the conversation you had you\ncan think about the activities the games\nyou're playing the intimacy those\nconversations those moments\nit's the space in between\nthat creates more harmony i think yo yo\nma talks about like harmony is in\nbetween the notes\nright it's like there's it's the same\nthing with connection and love\nyou know if i spent every moment with\nyou i might be like uh i need some more\ntime apart but it's because i only see\nyou once every couple weeks or once a\nmonth i get so excited about that time\ntogether right not that i wouldn't want\nto see you every day no no i mean it's\nlike having time to to be an independent\nhuman being doing your activities doing\nthe things you love\nwill i think support you in staying\ntogether longer yeah and the couples\nthat you know that i know that have been\ntogether for\n20 30 40 years\nat least a lot of them i feel like have\nthat one day a week where they're with\ntheir friends have that time where they\ngo on a trip alone or with other other\npeople in their life\nthey learn other activities they go to\nworkshops together but also alone\non things that they can add value to the\nrelationship and to themselves\nfeel independent but also be committed\nyeah and i think that is a huge thing\nto set yourself up to be a healthy\nconscious thriving relationship long\nterm yeah if you choose to be with one\nperson if you choose to be with one\nperson\nthere's a couple of things you have to\nthink about the first is what do you\nactually enjoy to do together\nso radhi and i discovered that\ngoing out to dinner was okay\nwatching a movie together was okay but\nwhat we've really loved was experiences\nwhat we really loved was doing\nactivities together what we really loved\nwas going to workshops together so\nwhether it was a cooking class or\nwhether it was pottery or whether it was\ntrekking with gorillas that we just did\nright now or whether it was going on a\nhike together like it was doing\nsomething active together and you know\neven in our relationship as as friends\nlike we were talking about this like\nwhen we said our values\nfun fitness and friendship and we've\ndecided that we want to make sure that\nwe are going out for dinner but we also\nwant to play some sports we've been\nplaying pickleball together or our\nversion of pickleball then we're\ninventing\nwe're going on hikes we're doing\ndifferent things activities together\nyeah and like that's what we've realized\nwe like to do and i think that's a\nreally important thing that if you want\nto be with someone long term\nyou have to figure out what you want to\ndo together and then going even a step\nfurther if you're really going to be\nwith someone long term\nyour relationship has to have a purpose\nbeyond each other\nyeah the goal of your relationship can't\nbe how do we stay together\nlike the goal of the relationship is how\ndo we serve together how do we give\ntogether how do we help our community\ntogether like couples who have that\nability to expand their radius of care\nand compassion\nthat's what ultimately goes to that\nstage couples that stay together serve\ntogether yeah i think that's a great\nthing you know i think in the fitness\ncommunity they're like families that\nwork out together stay together type of\nthing but i think couples that stay\ntogether are the ones that are serving\ntogether and i know you're talking about\nthis and i know this is going to be in\nyour next book as well\nthis kind of concept of the different\nlevels of relationship of okay you're in\nthe the getting to know dating stage\nthen you're in the commitment stage then\nyou're in marriage stage and then it's\nlike what is the next stage it's\nbeing in service it's figuring out ways\nto serve your family your friends your\ncommunity and the ways that make sense\nfor you\nthat's what's going to keep people\ntogether long term and i think when we\nstop serving the relationship and we\nstop serving others around the\nrelationship\nit's probably going to have more\nchallenges yeah yeah you know maybe you\ncan make it last and maybe you have some\ngood times but i feel like you're going\nto have more challenges to overcome\nwhich is going to make you say\none person is not for me like this this\nrelationship's not working i need a\ndifferent relationship yeah\nand\nmaybe that's true maybe that\nrelationship wasn't supposed to last but\ni think it's\nand i'm so excited for your next book\nbecause i've been getting the behind the\nscenes from you on it but i feel like\nyou're going to give people this\nfoundation of\nhow to set yourself up at the different\nstages of a committed relationship\nand and i don't think there's anything\nwrong with being single and dating\nlots of people i know a guy right now\nhe's single and he's going on dates\nevery week with different people taking\npeople out to dinner and having\ninteresting conversations\nand what matthew hussey says our friend\nis kind of like eliminating people that\naren't the one for them right now yeah\nit's like i got to go meet a bunch of\npeople have experiences to see who i you\nknow don't want to be with as well and i\nthink there's a season for that\nand i think when we get into\nrelationship we just need to be\nconscious of why am i getting this\nrelationship\nyou know am i dependent on this to make\nme happy if so i just think that's going\nto be a recipe for failure but being\nconscious about entering a relationship\nand conscious about growing a\nrelationship there's so much you learn\nwhen you're single and there's so much\nyou learn when you're in a relationship\nyeah and\nthat's actually the question do i want\nhow do i want to learn right now\nlike how do i want to learn right now do\ni want to learn by meeting lots of\npeople and learning in that way and\ndealing with what comes with that or do\ni want to learn in this way and i think\neverything in life is simply a learning\nexperience and at this season of my life\nyeah\nthat one of the biggest values for me is\npeace yeah inner peace right and you\nkind of piece if you and i for years i\nwould interview\non camera and off camera\nolder men who were successful in\nbusiness or in their careers who had\nkind of reached the top of their their\nindustry and i would ask them questions\nlike\nabout being single or about having you\nknow being married about being with one\nperson or do they have open\nrelationships just curious\nand there was not one man who was like\n50 60 70 years old\nwho was peaceful and fulfilled\nwith multiple women\nat the same time or kind of trying to\nmanage that you know that energy\nthe ones that had peace which again is a\nvalue of mine is having peace because i\nfeel like peace helps us create mental\nclarity which i\nthink is important for you as well which\nhelps us have more energy towards our\nmission yeah\nand uh i haven't met one 67 year old man\nwho was like i had five girlfriends the\nwhole time and i was peaceful\nand so i just thinking what's your value\nwhat do you want if you want adventure\nand fun and\nyou can't have all that and peace\nthere's going to be some letting go so i\nreally like and this has been my biggest\ntakeaway from today is that you brought\nit back to values\nif your value\nis experimentation\nand freedom freedom\nfreedom from commitment\nthen that's a beautiful life and i'm not\nand again i'm not\nsaying you should do either or i do you\nknow it's it's all based on your values\nabsolutely and you just said your value\nis peace my value is purpose i want to\nbe committed to my purpose\nand i had a really open and honest\nconversation with a friend recently he\nasked me a question he said jay like you\nknow how do you deal with\nuh temptation and desire you know\neverything else\nand we had a really honest vulnerable\nconversation man-to-man and i said to\nhim that for me one of my biggest values\nin life\nis history and loyalty\ni like long-term friendships because\nthen you can look back and look at how\nfar you've come that's cool and you\ncan't do that from short-term desire\nyeah i like loyalty i love the idea of\nlike you've been loyal to a friend a\nperson a partner\nand you can look back at how what you've\nbeen through it's cool and so when i\nlook at my life i love that me and you\nhave\nmemories from being in new york together\nbeing in la together doing a project\ntogether\nand in my\nromantic relationship it's the same\nthing it's like i've been with this\nwoman when i had nothing when i was\nbroke pretty cool when i was at the like\nand i'm here and i value that right and\nsomeone might say jay that's still soft\nlike i don't value that at all\nand that's cool like i respect that you\nmay say you don't value history you\nvalue\na one-night stand and that's great like\nthere's nothing wrong with that but i\nthink\nyou've got to know what you value and i\nlove that you value peace and i love\nthat you equate a committed relationship\nto peace and that's beautiful and some\npeople might say well every relationship\ni've been in is stressful so i'm going\nto value being single yeah and\nhaving surface conversations or surface\ninteractions of intimacy that aren't\nscary to go deeper right where there\ncould be heartbreak or pain or\nfrustration or whatever it is\nand that's your season you know that's\nwhat you value but i i do i definitely\nvalue intimacy connection\nthere's nothing worse than accomplishing\nlike your greatest goals\nand then being in a hotel room by\nyourself and being like yeah\nall right i'm gonna you know who am i\nwho am i gonna call to celebrate this\nwith no one like with you in the journey\nand you with them exactly it's really\ncool to be there for each other\nand uh something i value with you know\nmartha being inspired by what she's\ncreating and she's
