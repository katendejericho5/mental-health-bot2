money this just means\nyou have to understand how to save your\nmoney strategically because wealthy\npeople do not want to save all their\nmoney\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now the fun that\ni've been having with this show recently\nis\nwhat we've done since the beginning\nis we've talked about mental health and\nwell-being much more broadly than just\nthe mind often we think that mental\nhealth and living a positive life and\nliving a healthy life is all about just\nthe mind for a long time we thought it\nwas just the body\nthen we kind of upgraded but what we\nhaven't realized is that\nevery part of our life informs our\nwell-being\nhow we make money\nhow we spend money how we use money\nand even deeper than that how we think\nabout money impacts our well-being we\nhave a relationship with every form of\nenergy in this world\nand money or our financial well-being is\nan integral part of it\nand so today i'm really honored and\nreally grateful because i reached out to\nsomeone who i believe is truly talking\nabout this in a way that i can align\nwith someone that i feel has incredible\nvalues around his own mission i'm\ntalking about the one and only jaspreet\nsingh who's a serial entrepreneur and\nlicensed attorney although he didn't\nreceive any formal financial education\nhe's on a mission to make financial\neducation fun and accessible and he's\nwinning at it jaspreet is the chief\nexecutive money nerd at the minority\nmindset companies and the host of the\nminority mindset youtube channel which i\nhighly recommend you go and subscribe to\nwhile you're listening or watching this\nwelcome to the show jaspreet sings just\nread thank you for doing this wow jay\nwhat an introduction man i appreciate\nyou i appreciate being here and thank\nyou for the opportunity no i'm so\ngrateful i get to have this conversation\nwith you i was just saying to you\noffline that one of the things i really\nappreciate about the way you talk about\nwealth when i was watching your channel\nand hearing your work\nwas that i realized that money wasn't an\nobsession or it didn't sound like the\ngoal\nbut you'd created these really healthy\nhabits around how all of us no matter\nwhat our financial situation is can\ncreate really\na deep meaningful connection to our\nwealth and finances would you say that's\nfair how does that sound you can totally\ndisagree with me 100 i mean the things\nthat i grew up learning just didn't make\nsense because growing up my parents are\nimmigrants from a state in india called\npunjab and i saw my parents work their\nbutt off my parents came to this country\nwith very little and growing up\nif my dad had a saturday and a sunday\noff it was considered a long weekend so\nhe was working long hours every day on\nweekends all the time\nand at the same time they would say you\nneed to study hard so you can get a good\njob and become successful and at the\nsame time they would also say don't\nworry about money don't stress about\nmoney don't talk about money because\nmoney's bad money's taboo money is evil\nand something didn't make sense because\neven as a kid i had this entrepreneurial\nbug where i was like i want to do\nsomething different i started by mowing\nmy neighbor's lawns and my parents were\nlike don't do that don't worry about\ntrying to get money by doing that just\nstudy hard to become a doctor and i was\nlike well\nsomething's not making sense because on\none hand you're working your butt off\nto get paid\nand on the other hand you're talking\nabout how money is bad how you shouldn't\ntalk about money as i went through this\nlike\nemotional\nand kind of a tough financial education\njourney i realized\nthat the reason why so many people\ncreate the smokescreen\ntaboo culture around money is because\nwe're insecure about our money\nand the reason why is because we don't\nunderstand how money plays a part in our\nlives money is just one part of our\nlives you're right money is not going to\nmake you happier money is not going to\nmake you a better person money is not\ngoing to make you a good person however\nif you don't have money and if you don't\nunderstand money well that lack of money\ncan impact your mental health it can\nmake you stressed anxious depressed it\nis one of the leading causes of divorce\nif you don't have money you can start\neating bad you can't afford healthier\nfood you can't have the right gym\nmembership you don't have time to take\ncare of family if you don't have money\nyou can't buy your spouse a nice\nvacation that they keep asking about you\ncan't take care of your kids the way\nthat you might have want to you can't\ngive your kids the vacations you can't\ngive your kids the opportunities that\nmaybe you want maybe you can't even buy\nthe health care that you want because\nthe reality and this is you know\nunfortunate or fortunate the reality of\nthe way the system is is money talks\nand if you don't understand money then\nyou're going to be at the mercy of\npeople who have money and this is where\ni had to understand how money plays a\npart in my life\nbecause i came to do something that i\ncalled the quadrafit theory and the way\nthat i put it is there's four aspects of\nlife if you want to live a happy and\nfulfilled life you have to be healthy in\nthese four aspects\nfirst you have to be physically fit\nsecond\nyou have to be mentally fit\nthird you have to be spiritually fit and\nfourth is financially fit\nand the way i put it in this order is\nbecause physically if you're not\nphysically fit if you're morbidly obese\nyou're on your deathbed it doesn't\nmatter if you have 10 million dollars\nthe only thing you care about is being\nhealthy again\nsecond mentally fit\nif you are depressed if you're anxious\nif you are not surrounded by people that\nyou love if you're not happy having more\nmoney is just gonna make you more\nmiserable\nand\nthis is a big misconception out there\nwhere i i know people in my own personal\nlife i'm sure you do too where people\nare like if i just make a million\ndollars\nyou know i'm going to have find the love\nof my life i'm going to be liked people\nare going to want to talk to me i'm\nyou start to imagine this world where\nmoney is going to solve the mental\naspect of your life but that's not the\ncase it's its own aspect\nso more money will not make you mentally\nhappy then it's a spiritual aspect and\nthis doesn't have to be religious this\nis your purpose for me it's what what is\nthe reason why you're on this earth what\nare you waking up for every single day\nif you don't have a purpose you're not\ngoing to have a reason to get out of bed\nno matter how much money you have after\nyou have the physical fitness the mental\nfitness the spiritual fitness that's\nwhere the financial fitness has the\nbiggest impact and the most power to\nhelp you live the most fulfilled life\nbecause now money is just the icing on\nthe cake man it allows you to live a\nmore fulfilled and a happy life because\nnow you can do more of the things that\nmake you happy you can give more you can\nbuy more food for homeless people you\ncan do more things that give you\nhappiness maybe it is writing books\nmaybe it's traveling maybe it is giving\nmaybe it is starting businesses whatever\nit is for you you have the resources and\nthe ability to do that but that requires\nyou to have that financial education and\nbe willing to now\ngo out of the way\nto talk about money and learn about\nmoney and understand that hey money is\nsomething that i need to understand\nmoney is something that i need to be\nwilling to talk about money is something\nthat i need to be willing to learn about\nbecause most of us are never taught to\nthink about money myself included\nyeah i mean i love that thesis and i\nwould agree with you\nbecause\ni had similar rhetoric in my language\ngrowing up so when we talked about money\nit was we always had just enough\nso i grew up when i had zero in my bank\naccounts\non plenty days and that was just we had\njust enough\nor we often talked about money as if we\nwent to\na place where someone had a nice home or\nsomeone had a nice car the conversation\nwould be oh well that person does some\nsketchy exactly or they must have done\nsomething\nthat was stabbing someone in the back or\ncausing someone pain to be in that\nposition and so you start creating this\nvery negative toxic view towards money\nyeah and like you said at the same time\nyou need access to it have you ever\nfigured out what it was for your parents\nthat you think created that disparity in\ntheir relationship with money have you\never probed that have you ever\nunderstood that because it comes from\nsomewhere yeah i think it's a cultural\nthing you know\ni think across the indian culture my\nparents are from a state in india called\npunjab yeah culturally\nyou know\nmoney is just one of those things like\neven in my culture and my religion like\nthere's this concept called girth which\nmeans earn and honest living now many\npeople have interpreted that you know in\nmany different ways of oh don't worry\nabout money don't talk about money and\nand in the sikh religion there's also\nthis big concept of seva which means\nselfless service giving back and so\nthere's this kind of like\nreal giving aspect which is great and i\nagree with but many times we overlook\nthe idea of how about the earning aspect\nhow do we earn how do we take care of\nourselves because the way i look at it\nis if you want to be able to fill\nsomebody else's cup you want to feed\nsomebody else you have to be able to\nfeed yourself first and this is a lesson\nthat my grandfather taught me\nmy grandparents are immigrants or they\nwere refugees before they came and lived\nwith me they were refugees because the\nstate of punjab\nused to be much larger\n1947 the state was severed and if you\nwere sick and you were on the west side\nof punjab you had to migrate east\notherwise you were going to be killed\nand it was a very brutal very rough very\nlike bad time\nand my grandparents were on the west\nside and so immediately they had to\nleave their homes leave their lands\nleave family members leave their friends\nbehind and migrate and run east\nmy grandfather i heard the story a lot\nand\nhe actually just moved back to america\nbut when he started the migration\nprocess the process moving east all he\nhad was a sword in his hand and the\nclothes on his back nothing else\nleft all the money left all the land\nleft everything behind even left his\nparents behind and started running and\nduring that process he got attacked by a\nand he had to defend himself and he saw\nhis uncle get killed right in front of\nhim his uncle got a\nknife a sword right to his head cut his\nhead open in half and that was the last\ntime he saw him now he comes over to the\nnew east inside of punjab the new india\nhe lost his shoes along the way doesn't\nhave a home doesn't have any family\ndoesn't have any friends he's here just\ntrying to figure it out himself\nand now has to figure out how do you\nmake life work and what he tells me from\nthat time is\npoorness is the worst disease\nand the reason why is because when\nyou're at that level of poverty that\nlevel of poorness you can't even think\nabout feeding somebody else you can't\nthink about helping another person\nbecause the only thing on your mind is\nhow can i feed myself how can you feed\nyour family when that's the only thing\nthat you're trying to do you can't worry\nabout feeding other people and that's\nwhere you know for me it was i want to\nbecome successful so i can give back to\nmy family to my parents give back to my\ncommunity and be able to do more things\nmoney at its core is just a tool\nit allows you to do more of the things\nthat you want if you give a good person\nmoney they have a tool to do more good\nif you have a bad person more money they\nhave a tool to do more bad so money at\nthe end of the day it's just like\ngasoline it amplifies whoever you are\nwhich is why we need more good people\nwith money so now going back to your\nquestion of why\ni really think it's just a lot of\ninsecurity you know if we feel like we\ndid everything right we're working hard\nbut we don't have what somebody else has\nsomething must be wrong they must have\ndone something bad they must have done\nsomething that you know we didn't see\nso we create excuses we create smoke\nscreens but the thing that we don't\nunderstand is the financial education\naspect because that is the thing that\ncan make or break your finances it does\nnot matter how much money you make what\ndegree you have who your parents are\nwhere you went to school none of that\nmatters it's what you do with the money\nyou make and this is one of those things\nthat it can be very hard for you to\nunderstand unless you actually see it i\nwas actually just reading a study last\nweek\nit said that seven out of 10 americans\nacross the board are living paycheck to\npaycheck and then it said that\n50 percent of americans or just about 50\nof americans making six figures or more\nare also living paycheck to paycheck the\nmajority of americans across the board\ndoesn't matter the income are broke they\nhave little to no savings they have\nlittle to no investments regardless of\nhow much money you're making and the\nreason is not just because of what\nsalary or job or or what degree you have\nor who your parents are but because of\nwhat financial education you have and\nnone of us are taught to think about\nmoney\nwhich is the craziest thing yeah i i\nreally appreciate you going in that\ndirection because\ni think everyone thinks that when we do\nhave a conversation about money because\nof our conditioning it has to be this\nobsession or it has to be this goal and\nyou're like well actually it's just\nabout education yeah it's just about you\nhave to make this thing and you're going\nto do something with it right we better\nlearn how it goes in and goes out and\nwhere it goes and even for me i'm\nreflecting on my own experience i i\ninterviewed my mom recently not on the\npodcast and i want to do that but i\ninterviewed my mum recently at a dinner\nwe were at a dinner for my sister's\nbirthday and i thought you know what i'm\ngoing to interview my mum like a podcast\nguest yeah at dinner and so i started\nasking her questions i was like mom like\nhow did you get your first job and like\nespecially i find like indian south\nasian parents they don't really talk\nabout yeah i don't know at least mine\ndon't they don't talk about the\nstruggles they went through or the\nhardships\nyou never talk about the problem you\nnever talk about the problems and so i\nwas asking my mom\nshe told me that she was from yemen so\nmy mom was born and raised in yemen she\nspeaks arabic unfortunately she did not\nteach me\nbut she's of indian descent in indian\norigin\nand in yemen there was a war going on\nbetween\nthe people of yemen and the brits\nbecause the brits were in control at the\ntime so my mom said she was studying for\nher exams while there were yemeni\nsoldiers on her roof wow trying to\nprotect yemen and they're just study for\ntheir school exams and like that's what\nshe was going through and so\nand then when she moved to london\nshe kept her british passport by moving\nto london at the time because yemen got\nits independence\nthey moved with like eight pounds which\nis like ten dollars like you know and at\nthat time that's not bad but it's i mean\nthat's practically nothing and of course\nthey built up from scratch and and you\nknow for themselves did really well\nbut\nthe idea still comes to\nwe have no financial education yeah\nwhat are if you could start with and\nwe'll dive into each of these deeper if\nyou could tell me what are the three\nhabits\nthat keep us\nin that poor or poverty mindset as you\nsaid\nand what are the healthy habits that\nbring us into the wealthy mindset sure\nso the three i think biggest\nbad habits when it comes to money first\nprobably the most obvious\ni would say is people following the two\ns's where you're spending or saving all\ntheir money you'll never become wealthy\nif you do that number two would be\nyou blindly follow the system without\nquestioning the way the system works and\nnumber three is you don't understand how\nmoney works so if we start with number\none\nthe two s's\nsave and spend now it's interesting if\nyou look at the financial statements for\nthe majority of people in america or\neven across the world the way it looks\nis you make money you pay taxes you\nspend money and then you wonder where\nall your money went literally\nand so people the majority people don't\nhave any plan for their money and that's\nwhy the majority people have little to\nno savings and the majority of americans\nhave little to no investments right now\nabout half of america has zero\ninvestments i'm talking about 0 401 k\nzero iras zero stock market account zero\nreal estate investment zero gold\ninvestments nothing and then out of the\nnext half of americans that have an\ninvestment only\nhalf of those have an investment outside\nof their 401 care ira so you have a very\nsmall percent about a quarter of america\nworking america that's any investments\non their own\nwhen you go back to the saving and\nspending we're in a spending culture\namerica has a consumerism culture and i\njoke about this but uh the way i like to\nsay it is traditionally indian people\nmake a dollar to spend 20 cents american\npeople make a dollar to spend two\ndollars yeah thanks for the help of\ncredit credit\nthis is just the culture that we're in\nwhere it's very okay\nand normalized to spend money even if\nyou can't afford something you don't\nhave it and what are you doing well\nyou're spending all your money making\neverybody else around you rich but you\nyourself you might look rich but you're\nactually broke there's a reason why the\nowner and ceo of louis vuitton is the\nrichest person in the world versus the\nmajority people who wear louis vuitton\nare broke the people who are wearing\nlouis vuitton are trying to look rich\nand how are you doing that well you're\nmaking the owner of louis vuitton rich\nby doing that and so this is where you\ngot to understand there's nothing wrong\nwith wearing designer stuff there's\nnothing wrong with having nice stuff\nthere's nothing wrong with wanting nice\nthings but you have to be able to afford\nit first i used to guest teach in\ndetroit public schools\nand when i used to teach there's a rough\nschool district i would talk to the kids\nabout life you know motivation and\nentrepreneurship and money and success\nand one of the things that i would ask\nis how many of you have a job\nalmost all of them raised their hand\nsaying that they had a job my next\nfollow-up question was how many of you\nhave a bank account\nnobody raised their hand so i asked you\nknow what you do with your paycheck they\nsaid well we get a physical check then\nwe go to the liquor store we get it\ncashed the liquor store owner takes one\nto ten percent then you buy pop candy a\nbunch of junk on the way out and by the\ntime you're out of the store you've\nalready given away half of your paycheck\ni call it a net zero thinking where we\nthink in terms of spending if i have a\nthousand dollars i can go out and buy\nthis handbag this nice thing if i have\n10 grand i can go in this nice vacation\nif i have 50 grand i can go on and buy\nthis nice car we think in terms of\nspending because we think if i have this\nmoney how can i spend it now if you\nbreak away from that and now you start\ncreating a buffer and you don't spend\nall of your money the next problem is we\nsave our money because for me the only\nfinancial education that i was given was\nsave your money\nbecause if you're not spending it now\nyou are building up a big bank account\nand if you have a big bank account\nyou'll be wealthy but the reality is you\nwill never be able to become wealthy\nthrough your savings your savings will\nnever make you wealthy and if you don't\nbelieve me i'll give you just a\nmathematical term your savings right now\nare growing\nby\nessentially nothing but let's just say\none percent and i'm being very very\ngenerous here if your savings grow by\none percent and inflation is higher than\none percent and we can see now inflation\nis extremely high but even before the\n2020 pandemic inflation was still higher\nthan one percent we were two or three\npercent\ninflation means that the value of your\nsavings are dropping so if inflation is\nhigher than your savings that means that\nyour savings are losing value each and\nevery day every day that you save your\nmoney in the bank you are slowly\nbecoming poorer each and every day and\nmost of us never see it happen now this\ndoesn't mean you shouldn't save any\nmoney this just means you have to\nunderstand how to save your money\nstrategically because wealthy people do\nnot want to save all their money they\nwant to save their money for an\nemergency they save their money for an\ninvestment or they save their money for\na big purchase if it doesn't fall into\none of those three things you don't want\nto save your money because now you're\nsaving money your savings are just\nmaking you poorer each and every day\nthis brings me to then the second aspect\nwhich is\nblindly following and trusting the\nsystem and this one was the most\ndifficult one for me\nbecause growing up most of us myself\nincluded always told that if you want to\nbecome successful go to school get good\ngrades get a good job climb the\ncorporate ladder for me it was go to\nschool get good grades\nget into medical school become a doctor\ni know you've heard similar stories\nbefore yeah that was all that i was told\nsince i was like a little baby my\nparents would tell everybody jaspreet is\ngoing to become a doctor he's going to\ngo out and do medicine this and that\nand that's what i was always told and i\nwas not really against it because i\nwanted to be successful i saw how hard\nmy parents worked since i was a kid i\nalways wanted to give back\nand i was assumed that okay if i got\ngood grades i'll get into a good medical\nschool and if i do good in medical\nschool i'll be able to get a good job as\na doctor and if i get a good job as a\ndoctor i'll be able to make more money i\nthought it was all just linearly\ncorrelated your grades your income your\ngrades your success that was one of the\nreasons why growing up anything that was\nnot medical or academic related it was\ncompletely discouraged\nand sometimes i think it's very\ndifficult for someone to understand what\ndoes it mean that like you know your\nparents really wanted you to be a doctor\nbecause it wasn't like an option like\nthis was the only option and i think the\nbest example that i can give of that was\nwhen i was in eighth grade i was like\nyou know 12 years old my parents got me\na tutor not for the english class that i\nwas on the verge of failing not for the\nother stuff that i was studying for in\n8th grade but for the medical college\nadmission test the test you take in\ncollege to get into medical school my\nparents got me a tutor for when i was in\n12th grade we didn't spend money on a\nlot of things the only thing that\nparents were willing to spend money on\nwere things related to academics to get\nme into medical school and so here i am\nin 12th grade i have an mt mcat tutor\ncoming to my house and he's like wait\nthis is the kid that i'm teaching about\nmedical school to get him into medical\nschool\nand like that's how strict it was in my\nhouse so i was checking all the boxes i\nwas doing good in school i was studying\nhard i was getting good grades\nbut then along the way\ni realized that something wasn't adding\nup when i was in high school i was\nworking at indian weddings i was playing\na drum called the dol and i got to meet\na lot of the local indian djs that work\nindian weddings and we became friends\nand they would say\nyou know you have a lot of friends in\nhigh school how about we start hosting\nteen parties in high school now i\ncouldn't tell my parents this because\nagain anything that's not you know\nmedicine related gonna get me into\nmedical school i can't tell them so i\nwould do this all on the side even going\nto work at weddings i had to kind of\nkeep it all secret\nand i was like okay let's do it you know\nit was fun for me so i was 16 years old\nand i started hosting these teen parties\nat a local restaurant that just opened\nup and they wanted some exposure so they\nlet us do it there for free\nand it was fun but then i was like you\nknow i know this is a hobby i'm going to\ngo to college and i'm going to become a\ndoctor and this is all going to become\nhistory\nwell i go to college i'm 17 i don't know\nwhat to expect because my parents didn't\ngo to university here and i think that\neverybody goes to college they spend\ntheir friday nights in the chemistry lab\nthey all want to become this big thing\nand they want to spend all their time\nstudying in college and i get there and\neverybody\nis\npartying\ndrinking blowing money they don't have\non all this stuff like i don't party i\ndon't drink i never drink i didn't smoke\nso for me it was like a big shock and i\nwas like this is weird like this is not\nwhat i expected but i still need\nsomething to do on friday nights so that\nentrepreneur side of my brain kicked in\nagain it was like oh let's bring this\nparty business back to college because\nthat's all i knew so i was like oh okay\nso i'm 17 i start knocking on the doors\nof all the clubs venues bars restaurants\nasking if i can host party here's and\nagain i'm not a party person i don't\ndrink i don't smoke but this was the\nonly hustle that i knew and uh you know\ni just didn't know much else so\neventually i found a club that would\nwork with me and they didn't want to\ncharge me anything they would let me\nwork on it essentially a commission\nbasis that they'll take a percentage of\nthe revenue that i bring in and i said\nokay it doesn't cost me any money\nbecause i don't have a lot of money i\nstarted hosting these parties but i\nstill knew that this was just a hobby\nsomething i'm doing because i was bored\non weekends\nthen i started studying to go into\nmedical school and this is where things\nreally shifted because i had some cash\nsaved up in the bank and now this is\nlike the bottom of the 2008 crash\nbecause i was in high school when the\n2008 crash happened\naround 2012 was when i was studying for\nthe mcat so real estate prices are at\nrock bottom\nand the markets are still really shaky\nand i'm starting to study for the mcat\nand i am bored out of my mind trying to\nstudy for this because i just wasn't\nvery passionate about it\nand so during my breaks i would read\nbusiness books and i would go on the\nyahoo finance and i would study what's\ngoing on in the markets just for fun\nand i kept hearing about how\nreal estate is at rock bottom on the\nnews and the business books that i read\nalways said that wealthy people invested\nin real estate\ni had no idea what they meant i didn't\nknow any real estate investors i didn't\nknow what real estate investing was i\ndidn't have investor people in my family\nso i didn't know what that meant\nuh so i was like well if wealthy people\ninvest in real estate maybe i should\ninvest in real estate so i brought up\nthe idea to my dad i was like dad i want\nto invest in real estate he's like shut\nup you're stupid go study and become a\ndoctor you can worry about all this\nother stuff after you become a doctor i\nwas like okay now i just want to say you\nknow i love my dad to death my parents\nthis was just all they knew they didn't\nhave that financial education\nbut in the back of my mind you know i'm\nalways like you know okay what can i do\nmaybe i don't got to tell my parents\ni'll just do something else i had a\nlittle bit of cash saved up in the bank\nfrom the party business that i was\nrunning so i started looking at rental\nproperties to buy\nand i found this small condo on sale for\n8 400\nthat was the price of the condo that's\nwow and that same condo a few years\nprior had sold for 150 grand so the 2008\ncrash really decimated the real estate\nmarket in michigan because ford gm\nchrysler were just hit so hard\nand so i was like okay well this is not\na bad price i can afford this i made an\noffer for four thousand dollars and it\nwas in foreclosure the bank countered\nwith seven thousand\nand then i said um how about we settle\nat six grand and we were trying to go\nback and forth and then they said well\nwe have another offer on the table i\ndidn't want to lose this deal because i\nalready looked at a few so i was like\nokay well i'll make an offer for eight\ngrand so it was a bidding war the other\nperson offered less than eight grand so\ni got the condo so i bought the condo\nfor eight thousand dollars but a little\nbit of work into it it was in pretty\ngood shape and i got it rented out for\n600 a month now i'm 19 years old\nand i had no idea what i was doing but\nall of a sudden once i got it a little\nbit figured out i was like wait\nthis condo\nis paying me\nevery single month and i don't have to\ngo and host a party i don't got to go to\nwork i was working at auntie anne's\npretzels a little bit before that\nbecause i don't got to flip pretzels i\ndon't got to host this party i don't got\nto work at a wedding and it's paying me\nsomething doesn't make sense like how\ncome i was never told about this like i\nwas doing good in school like i'm i\nwould thought i was like smart i thought\ni knew what i was doing\nturns out that there's a whole world of\nfinancial education that were never\ntaught\nso now the traditional\nsystem is go to school\nstudy hard get good grades get a good\njob climb the corporate ladder and now\ni'm starting to realize wait there's a\ndifferent system here than none of us\nare ever taught where the goal isn't to\njust get a job and climb the corporate\nladder what wealthy people are doing is\nthey're working to own the corporate\nladder and i was like i didn't even know\nthat you could do that because now if\nyou can own investments if you can own\nassets you own things that are going to\nbe paying you without you having to\nphysically work and this is what wealthy\npeople are working for yet none of us\nare ever taught this none of us are ever\ntaught in school how do you manage money\nnone of us are ever taught how do you\ninvest your money none of us are ever\ntaught how do you build wealth none of\nus ever taught how to generate passive\nincome yet wealthy people are teaching\ntheir kids this\nand they're able to figure it out\nbecause they have that education but for\nthe majority of us we're not taught this\nunless you're willing to go either way\nnow youtube has made it a lot more\naccessible thank god yeah but before\nyoutube you had to go ahead and wait to\nread books and take classes and\nand it's tough it's a i mean it's much\nharder to read a 300 page book than it\nis to watch a 10-minute youtube video\nyeah definitely so that was a big\nturning factor for me because that's\nwhen i started to realize that there's\nsomething different that you can do so\nthe second habit that we talked about\nyou know breaking away from that\ntraditional system asking the question\nwhy and then the third thing is\nunderstanding what money is\nand\nthis is a very tough concept to\nunderstand\nand\ni guess the best example that i can give\nwith this is kind of going back to the\ntraditional indian culture because in\nindia it's a very common thing that when\nsomebody has extra cash extra rupees\nthey want to convert these rupees to\ngold\nit's why in india a lot of gold is\ntransacted during weddings because they\nwanna they wanna give\nmoney and the way that they do that is\nthrough gold because\ninherently people understand that the\nrupee\nloses value and i don't think that\npeople understand the why or the ins and\nouts it's just normal that's just the\nculture so people take the cash and they\nbuy gold and the reason why now we need\nto understand this here in our culture\nis because\nwhen we think of money there's two\ndifferent\naspects to it there's a currency which\nmeans something that we use to buy and\nsell things in exchange and then there\nis the store of value\nand many of us assume that our money is\nsupposed to be a store of value is\nsupposed to keep its worth\nbut now because of the 2020 pandemic and\nthe 2021 inflation and the 2022\ninflation we're seeing that oh my god my\nsavings don't buy me as much my earnings\nare not stretching as far and so we're\nstarting to really realize here\nthat maybe my dollars don't hold the\nsame value and so now it's understanding\nwhat is money well there's two aspects\nyou have the currency aspect to buy and\nsell things and then there's a store of\nvalue\nwhat wealthy people understand is that\nmoney doesn't\nact as a very good store of value in\ntoday's day and age so you want to take\nyour money and convert it to something\nthat is a store of value or maybe\nsomething that's actually going to\nproduce you income\nthis is like something that's so\nimportant for everyone to understand and\nwhat's interesting is my first video to\ngo viral was back in 2016\nand in that video on my minority mindset\nchannel\nthe reason why i think it went viral was\nbecause i talked about this whole idea\nof when you save all your cash in the\nbank you're becoming poorer each and\nevery day because back then inflation\nwas between two and three percent\nwhile your bank was paying you half a\npercent so i said was look you're losing\ntwo to three percent of your cash's\nvalue every single day so you need to do\nsomething with this money because your\nmoney is losing value in 10 years it's\ngoing to be worth less than it is today\nwell i didn't expect this 2020 pandemic\nto happen i didn't expect all this\ncraziness to happen but\nnow here we are with inflation\nsignificantly higher than two to three\npercent and now people are really\nstarting to understand that whoa what is\nmy money and you have to be able to\nunderstand this because this is the\ndriving reason for why wealthy people\ndon't want to save all their extra cash\nyou want to put your cash to work which\nbrings us now to the second side right\nwhat do wealthy people do\nwell the first thing you have to\nunderstand how money plays a part in\nyour life like we discussed right how\ndoes money impact your life that way you\ndon't go out and just start chasing\nmoney because one of the things that i\nrealized was\ni started making way more money when i\nstopped chasing money because when\nyou're chasing money you're chasing\nsomething that's illusory it's just fake\nit's just\nit doesn't even feel good and you're not\ngoing to be able to put your full self\ninto it\nbut then the second thing on the more\nfinancial side\nis what do you do with that money\nand\none of the things that i realized is\nwhat wealthy people want\nis this thing called equity\nand this is where you have a lot of\nbenefits in america because you can't do\nthis in a lot of countries so if you\nthink about the traditional american\ndream which is changing now but the\ntraditional american dream was\nyou can work hard buy a home have a car\nbut the whole idea of buying a home the\nreason why this was the american dream\nwas because if you can buy a home\nyou can work over the years to pay it\noff and now you have equity in your home\nand now you have the sort of\ngenerational wealth that you can pass\ndown you have an asset\nwell the traditional american dream is\nnow an american nightmare with the high\ncost of home ownership with wages not\nkeeping up with the cost of living\nhowever that doesn't mean that the\namerican dream is dead it's just changed\nso what is this new idea of the american\ndream well if you go back to the root\ncore\nof equity\nthis is the real dream of wealth and\nsomething that you can build for\nyourself and for your family and for\ngenerations is if you have equity\nnow how do i explain this well\nif you think about any company\nespecially in a bigger company it's easy\nto understand there's two people two\ntypes of people that are involved you\nhave the workers and you have the owners\nthe workers are working for a salary you\ngo to work every single day you get a\npaycheck you're getting a salary\nthe owners of the company are not\ngetting paid a salary\nthey're getting paid in profits\nthey want the company to make bigger\nprofits so that they can make more money\nnow there is some overlap between the\nworkers and the owners if you are a\nfounder you're probably an owner as well\nthe ceo might have some ownership and\nsome newer companies you'll give equity\nto the workers as well\nbut when you have equity you're getting\nthe profits of a company\neverybody in america in this system\nneeds to be a business owner if you want\nto become successful\nnow\nthe one thing that i want to caveat that\nwith is the majority of people should\nnot try to start a business and the\nmajority people should not try to\noperate a business now you might say\njust breathe you just said everybody\nshould be a business owner how does that\nmake any sense well you can own a\nbusiness without working for the\nbusiness and now this is the question of\nwhat are you doing with your salary what\nare you doing with your income you can\neither build the equity by starting a\ncompany yourself or by building a home\nor you can buy the equity\nnow how do you do that well you have to\nunderstand the wealth formula\nthe wealth formula that i come up that\ni've come up with\nis you take your income\nminus your expenses\nand that equals your investments\nplus your savings\nso\nif you take your income the amount of\nmoney that you make and i subtract all\nthe things that you buy your rent your\nmortgage your car payment your groceries\nyour gas you take away all of your\nexpenses and if you have a margin well\nnow you have extra cash now you can save\nall or some of this money but if you\ndon't save some of it then that money\ncan be put to work in your investments\nthese investments like i've been hinting\nat is what\nmakes wealthy people wealthy and this\nwill keep wealthy people wealthy these\ninvestments can be in the stock market\nbecause anytime you buy a share of any\ncompany if you go out and buy a share of\nsay amazon you become one of the owners\nof the amazon corporation you get to\nshare in the profits if the amazon\nvaluation goes up your stock price goes\nup\nthe second way would be through real\nestate not through your home but through\na real estate investment buying a rental\nproperty that you're buying for the sole\npurpose of making money this is\nsomething they can pay you every week or\nevery year every month\nthen it can be through\nyour own business or if you don't want\nto build your own business you can\ninvest in startups it's much more\naccessible now you can own physical gold\nyou can invest in cryptocurrency if\nthat's something that you believe in so\nthere's a lot of different ways to build\nthis equity but this is where now you\nneed to be putting your money to work to\nactually buy and own and build this\nequity yeah those are i mean i\nfirst of all i just want to say i love\nhow structured your thinking is and it's\nso great to\nbreak things down and so anyone who's\nbeen listening or watching so far make\nsure you go back\nand ask yourself which of those habits\nyou're struggling with are you someone\nwho's in the two s's choosing to spend\nor save are you someone who's being\nslowed down by\nsystemic thinking and like being\ncontrolled about where that goes like\nreally take a moment to reflect in this\nepisode while you're listening which\npart you want to work on because i know\nright now some of you may be tempted to\njust turn this off and go i'm\noverwhelmed i don't want to hear about\nthis i'm scared about my money already i\ndon't want to talk about it but i'm\nhoping that this is creating space for\nyou to really\nsit down introspect and reflect\ngoing into that i think one of the\nbiggest issues that people have\nwhen they hear this and i know that i\nhad a long time ago when i first heard\nthis was i don't have enough to do\nanything with and so i remember when i\nstarted hearing about\ncrypto specifically like very early on\nlike i probably heard about it like\nmaybe like\n13 years ago probably the first time\nyeah i was very early heard about\ncryptocurrencies about 12 13 years ago\nand i had just come out of the monastery\nso i didn't have any money like i didn't\ni didn't have anything to invest\nand probably in about a year i probably\nwould have had like a thousand to invest\nin my head i go\nthat's not anything what's that gonna do\nright and i think a lot of people have\nthat mindset they're like i only have\nfive hundred dollars i only have a\nthousand dollars what can i do with that\ni might as well spend it on whatever it\nis because oh i'm gonna save it because\ni need it for a rainy day\nwhat does someone do when they have that\nmindset when they're like i don't have\nenough how do you approach that so when\ni was in high school i really wanted a\nford mustang but my dad was like no we\ncan't buy a ford mustang i wasn't going\nto get that car\nbut this is again when stock prices had\ncrashed\nand the next best thing if i couldn't\nbuy a ford mustang this and i started\nreading the business books then\nwas how would i buy some of the ford\nstock again i didn't have a lot of money\nbut first investment in the ford stock\nwas two dollars because that's how much\nthe stock was trading for\nnow it's much higher but\nwhat i'm trying to get at is\nyou know you can start with\na very little amount of money i mean\nnowadays with the new age of stock\nbrokerages if you have ten dollars\nyou can start buying this type of equity\nyou can start building this type of\nequity but the key now\nis the consistency\nand how often like\ndoing it all the time because when i say\nconsistency people say oh anytime i have\na hundred dollars well okay what you\nwant to do but consistency is make it\nautomatic\nanytime you get paid take a portion of\nthat money and automatically invest it\nnow\nthe next question is probably where do i\nput this money do i just throw it into\ntesla or amazon well if you're not\nwilling to do that level of research\nwhere you don't want to try to find the\nbest companies you don't want to invest\nin real estate you don't want to get\ninto the more you know let's say the\nmore advanced type of stuff you want to\njust put your money to work well the\nsimplest thing you can do is look at\nsomething called an etf which is an\nexchange traded fund which gives you\nexposure not to one company but many\ncompanies maybe hundreds of companies\nfor example there's something called the\ns p 500 which is a group of the 500\nbiggest companies on the stock market\nessentially the 500 biggest companies in\namerica\nyou can invest in the s p 500 by\ninvesting in just one symbol so you\ninvest in this one thing and you're\ngetting exposure to 500 different\ncompanies now you don't have to worry\nabout what each of these 500 companies\nare doing you're just investing\nessentially in america the future of the\namerican economy if that's something you\nbelieve in well now every time you get\npaid put in a hundred dollars and now\nyou just do this for the long term\nwhether the market is up or down does\nnot matter it should not change a\nstrategy just keep passively investing\nyour money make it automatic make it\npassive that way you don't have to even\nworry about it and now you just keep\nbuilding it up because now it's the\nwhole idea of compounding you don't want\nto just throw your money in at once you\nwant to put a little bit of money and\nlet they grow put more money in that\nthey grow put more money and let that\ngrow i made a couple videos where i\ntalked about two people\none was a janitor one worked in a school\nboth of them made very little income yet\nboth of them retired\nvery wealthy and the reason and i'm\ntalking about in the millions of dollars\nand the reason why they've been able to\nretire with a million dollars plus was\nbecause it took a little bit of money\nevery time they got paid and they just\ninvested that money it did not matter\nyou know what else was going on in the\nworld they always paid themselves first\nthey always invested in assets before\nthey started going out and buying things\nthat made them look rich every single\ntime and when you put that\nlittle bit of money to work whether\nyou're starting with 25 or 250 or a\nthousand dollars when you put that money\nto work and you do that consistently\nover time you can build real wealth i\nmean if you look at a compound\ncalculator a\nfew hundred dollars a month\ncompounded from the age of 21 to 65\ngetting an average rate of return we're\ntalking about millions but it just\nstarts with making a small investment\nfirst and being consistent with it and\nalways being willing to learn i love\nthat and i'm glad you brought that up\nbecause i think the other option so as i\nwas saying there is the issue is i don't\nhave enough it's not going to matter\nright like that's one mindset\nthe other mindset is and it's almost the\nopposite it's the idea of like but i\nwant to make money quick yeah right and\ni feel like it's like i don't know but i\nwant it now and i think there's this\nmindset especially what you keep saying\nabout the how the lifestyle's been\nportrayed yeah that we almost feel like\npeople just change their lives overnight\nand that they all of a sudden have like\na portfolio of rental properties or they\nall of a sudden have\nthe nice house with a nice car or\nwhatever it may be and all of a sudden\nwe're wondering well how does it happen\nthat quick for me and then we get stuck\nin a get-rich-quick scheme or we get\nstuck in like some\nquick win how do it sounds like to me\nthat one of the biggest trainings is in\nthe discipline\nof being able to postpone pleasure yeah\nbecause what you're saying in any mark\nis it's going to take time like you had\nto save up for four to eight thousand\nfor your first condo that you bought\nfirst of all you had to work for that\nmoney you had to save that money yeah so\nthat you could invest it then you were\nable to buy this 8 000 condo which which\nobviously had has had great you know\ngrowth i'm sure\nbut there was a lot that took to get to\nthat whereas i think right now people\nare like oh well i'd rather spend 100 on\nthis right it's a real decade of\nsacrifice and there's really no way\naround it if you want to fast track your\nway now the best investment you can make\nif you want the better returns the\nbigger returns is by investing your\nmoney in yourself\nand the the tough part is you got to be\nwilling to go through that time and the\neffort because you're right it takes\ntime i'd\nyou know unless you have that experience\nalready there you have the mentors you\nhave you know parents people who can\nguide you through it maybe you can\nshorten it\nbut i didn't have that so for me it took\nme a solid decade to figure it out to go\nfrom business idea to business idea to\nbusiness idea to get go through failure\nor failure to get scammed after scammed\nthose things are what teach you and when\nyou're going through it it sucks you\ndon't realize that you're going through\na lesson you just feel like dang i just\ngot screwed over yeah what i mean sure\nbut it's it's\nyou got to keep the goal you know in\nmind and\nit's understanding what is more\nimportant to you right now because\nyou're right the last thing that you\nwant to do also\nis get into this idea of just\npinching pennies because at the end of\nthe day a penny saved is just a penny\nand the the thing that i can best do to\nillustrate that is if you make 40 000 a\nyear and you're like okay i'm gonna put\naside a quarter of my income i'm gonna\nput aside ten thousand dollars to save\nand invest and then you start putting\nyour money to work and you're like oh my\ngod i love this i wanna do more i wanna\nget better results so now you're like\nwell i'm gonna try to put aside 30 of my\nincome 35 of my income and you keep\ntrying to squeeze this limited pie\nbut this is where now you it's about\nbuilding that growth mindset and this is\nwhat wealthy people are able to do where\nthey say okay\nsure i can try to squeeze more pennies\nout of the pie but the other thing that\ni could do is i'm going to try to grow\nthe pie how do i go from 40 000 to 400\nthousand dollars\nand you know you might hear that\nthinking how in the world am i going to\ngo from 40 to 400. like it just sounds\nimpossible and so far away and\nat that point yeah it might seem the way\nbut the first step like you said it's\nthat mindset that's why i call minority\nmindset mindset because all success\nstarts with your mindset you have to be\nwealthy here before you can be wealthy\nin your bank account and you have to\nunderstand how your mindset plays a part\nin it because now if you tell yourself\nyou can't do it you can't yeah but if\nyou tell yourself you can then the next\nthing you're going to do is you're going\nto say how do i go from 40 to 50 yeah 50\nto 100\nyou're going to start watching youtube\nvideos you're going to start putting in\nwork\nand\nas you start to make more money now\nyou're going to be able to answer that\nquestion of what do i want to do with\nthis money do i want to go out and buy a\nnew beamer or do i want to go out and\ninvest in my business do i want to go\nout and buy a rental property do you\nwant to go and invest in stocks do i\nwant to go out and invest in a startup\nand now you can make these decisions\nbecause you have that financial\neducation and this is why you know\nanytime i talk about the house of you\nknow things that i say you should do to\nbecome wealthy i always talk about how\nyou\ninvest and grow your money last because\nif you don't know how to save the money\nif you don't know how to invest that\nmoney earning more money doesn't do you\nany good until you know how to do that\nbecause\nnow earning more money has the most\nimpact because now you know how to put\nthat money to work you have the system\nyeah and i'll give you a quick example\nlike\nthe first time i made a million dollars\nin a year\nmy car was worth 500 that i was driving\ni still drive today that 500 car just\nlast week before i came out here to\ncalifornia\nmy homeowners association called me and\nthey said hey joseph\nwe have a number of complaints about a\njunk car sitting in a driveway and it's\na true story they said it's been sitting\nthere because i was in california for a\nlong time they said it's been sitting\nthere\nand uh people say that you should take\nthese junk cars and put them in storage\nand i was like well for your information\nit's not a junk car that is my car that\ni take to and from work every single day\nit doesn't have a bumper on it um but it\nworks and they're like well you have to\nput it higher\nfurther in the driveway so people don't\nsee it and i was just like oh my god you\ndon't get it like you know and it's not\nthat i can't go out and buy another car\ni the way i look at it is well if i want\nto go and buy a 150 000 car which i can\ni can go and take this cash and buy a\ncar or i can take this 150 000 and put\nit back either into real estate or in\nstocks or into my business because\nthat's something that i've been\ninvesting heavily in now\ni started a company called market briefs\nwhich is a financial newsletter company\nand we're trying to grow aggressively\nbecause i want to make financial news\nmore accessible because this is\nsomething like i look at the things that\nwere very hard for me to understand\nlike\ncnbc used to be something i used to like\nwatching but it was just so complex none\nof the things made sense there's just so\nmany things happening and so now you\nmight watch and say i want to be better\nwith my money and so now you start\nwatching the financial news because\nwhere do you go next and then all of a\nsudden you get hit with all these\ncomplex terms and things that don't make\nany sense he turned off\nand so i created market briefs as a way\nto make financial news more accessible\nand easy to understand and\n2022 was the real first year that we\nbecame market briefs an actual company\nso i'm like well i can take this cash i\nwant to buy a car or i can hire more\nemployees we can buy better software we\ncan buy better infrastructure my\nemployees have a better car than i do\nbut i'm focused on you know that the\nlong term i want to build this into\nsomething bigger i want to make it\nsomething better now i'm going to buy a\nnice car one day i'm going to buy a\nbetter car i'm not saying that i won't\nbut it's that level of you know\nhow\nmuch are you willing to sacrifice today\nfor something bigger tomorrow i am not\ndriven by materialistic things i don't\nreally care about name brand stuff\nit doesn't really bother me i i mean i\nthink it's it's cool if you like it but\nit's just not for me i buy a lot of my\nclothes my suits from india i get them\nmade for a hundred dollars i get them\ncustom-made a lot of my clothes are\nrelatively inexpensive uh but\nfor me it's it's i enjoy what i do and\ni'm driven more by the purpose of i\nwanna\nhelp people\nwith the things that i wish\ni would have had help with because the\nmore and more that i\nhave seen growth the more more that i\ntalk to people i keep hearing i wish i\nwould have learned this sooner i wish i\nwould learn this younger yeah and that's\nwhere you know minority mindset i'm\ntrying to help provide that financial\neducation with my channel and the\nmarketplace trying to make that news\nmore accessible for anybody who wants to\nbe aware of what's happening in the real\nestate market the stock market the\ncrypto market inflation without being\noverwhelmed with that sensationalism and\nthe craziness of what happens in the\ntraditional financial news yeah\nabsolutely and i love how you said that\nultimately the best investment is an\ninvestment in yourself which you know\nwe've heard time and time again but\nwhat you are ultimately saying and that\nwas for me too like for me the first\nthings i started investing in with my\nhealth and so i remember reading that\nthere was that article where conor\nmcgregor was talking about lebron james\nand conor mcgregor was saying that he\ndidn't realize\nuntil he saw an interview with lebron\njames where lebron said that his health\nbill is like a million dollars or\nsomething a year yeah to maintain his\nhealth to be a high-performing athlete\nand i saw conor mcgregor's interview\nthat he's talking about and i was like i\nwant to be high performing like you know\nwhat do i need to do and and so i\nstarted researching and then i remember\ni've always been a big soccer fan\nfootball fan because of coming from\nengland right and there was this\ninterview again with two soccer stars\nand they were talking about how they\nwent to cristiano ronaldo's home\nwhen he just moved to manchester so he\nwas bought\nby manchester united when he was like 17\nyears old 18 like young talent and when\nthey went to his house he had his\ntrainer he had a chef he had his coach\nand all the other players were like what\nis this and he was like that's my chef\nthat's my trainer and that's my coach\nand they're like what are you doing and\nhe's like i'm gonna be the number one\nplayer in the world like that was his\nmentality and so he knew what to invest\nin while all the other players were\nbuying cars or going out for parties\nright he was building that and so i\nremember for me what started to happen\nwas like okay well what do i need to\ninvest in to create a mindset from which\ni can fully serve and give myself to\nothers and take care of myself and my\nfamily\nbecause if i'm not investing in those\nthings yeah then all of this is going to\nfall 100 which is why when you walk\nthrough the four things at the beginning\nyeah when you talked about physical\nwell-being mental well-being spiritual\nwell-being and financial well-being\nlike that recipe makes a lot of sense to\nme yeah and\ni guess what you're trying to do is\ntrying to give people financial\nconfidence rather than financial\nsurvival yeah it's the basics of the\neducation right\nand\none of the things that i try to\ndo is i never that i don't try to do is\ni don't want to say this is what you\nneed to do\nand that's why i'm not asking you that\nyeah but the reason why is because i did\nlisten to those people uh when you talk\nabout the get rich quick schemes uh i\nbought a lot of classes trying to learn\nabout entrepreneurship and money and\nsome of them were very good some of them\nwere really bad\nand the issue that i had was you know\nthe people that are like this is the\nonly thing you have to do whether it's\nbuy this type of etfs buy this type of\nreal estate invest in this type of\nbusiness it worked for them\nbut i have a different goal than them i\nhave a different background than them i\nhave a different experience than them i\nhave a different risk tolerance in them\nand everybody that watches this is again\ngoing to be different and so my whole\ngoal is to give you the education so you\ncan make a better decision for yourself\nrather than tell you what to do is\nteaching you to learn rather than\ntelling you what to do yes yes and i'm\nand i'm i'm really glad that that's the\nconversation we're having because and\nthat's what i'm not asking oh should we\ndo this you know because\nyou're absolutely right times are\ndifferent years are different i guess\none of the biggest things that i know is\non people's minds right now is people\nare scared of this crash they keep\nsharing about right so there's a lot of\nfear and there's a lot of insecurity and\na lot of anxiety and the challenges that\nforces us to shut down even more about\nmoney yeah because now we're all scared\nright and no one wants to admit saying\nyeah i've wasted all my savings or i've\ndone this\nhow how again not what to do how should\npeople think about this i'm very glad\nyou brought that up because this is\nsomething that we need to talk about\nbecause\nyou have to again ask the question of\nwhy and start questioning things because\ni'm just going to give you a little bit\nof a timeline because it helps me\nunderstand where we are and i think will\nhelp the listeners understand where\nwe're going\nif you want to know where to find the\nmost opportunity because the reality is\nmore millionaires are made during\nrecessions and crashes than any other\ntime and the reason why is because when\nyou have these types of recessions and\ncrashes\nassets go on discount they go on sale\nit's almost like black friday shopping\nfor investors and so you need to know\nhow to find these opportunities but this\nalso requires you to not just blindly\ntrust or listen to what anyone else says\nso i started asking the question of why\ni started losing a lot of trust in the\nsystem when i started realizing oh my\ngod like i was lied to about the school\nsystem and this and that and this and\nthat it was very painful for me\nbut\nif we go back a little bit and\nunderstand\nwhere we are in the economy and what\nmight be coming that will help you\nunderstand where to find the most\nopportunity and i think that we are in\nstore for\na correction the fed is going to\ndetermine how bad it is and there's a\nlot of factors that you want to pay\nattention to because there are real\nconcerns and real issues in our economy\nand with inflation that we cannot ignore\nthe way that i can best explain that\nbecause just like being on a brush on\nthis right now is\nbefore the 2008 crash happened\nthe government and the federal reserve\nbank\nkept saying that\nthere's no real estate crash the real\nestate market is very strong\nand then once the real estate market\nstarted to go down in 2007\nthe federal reserve bank i'll explain\nwhat they are in just a second they said\nthat real estate is going down a little\nbit but there's going to be no real\nestate crash and it's not going to\naffect any other aspect of our economy\nand they made that statement publicly\nand said it again and again and again\nand then what we saw happen was the\nentire real estate market imploded\nwall street was on the bank of collapse\nthe entire financial system was on the\nverge of coming down and after all of\nthat the federal reserve chairman then\ncame out and said i had to say what i\nsaid because i did not want to incite\npanic\nand because of the political issues\nwhere i was told not to\nsay certain things\nso that was then now before i go into\n2020 and now let me just explain what\nthe federal reserve bank is the federal\nreserve bank is known as the central\nbank in the united states they control\nthe monetary policy meaning that they\nhave the ability to print money give\nthis money to the government\nand they also have the ability to in\ninfluence and control interest rates so\nthey are the entity that can increase\ninterest rates that's the reason why\nwe're seeing mortgage rates go up right\nnow they're the entity that can cut\ninterest rates and although they're\ncalled the federal reserve bank they're\nnot federal they say so on their website\nthey're not a reserve they don't keep\ncash reserves anywhere they're not a\nbank you and i can't go there deposit\nmoney so now that we have that let's\nlet's kind of fast forward where we are\nnow\nin 2020\nthe\neconomy shut down due to the pandemic\nbut\nthe government started\nspending money like crazy and they were\nspending money that they didn't have\nwhere were they spending money well they\nwere giving up money in the form of\nunemployment checks they were giving out\nstimulus checks they were giving up big\nmoney to corporations they were giving\nup big loans to corporations and money\nwas just being printed at free will so\nthe government was spending trillions of\ndollars that they didn't have\nand this gave money to people and\nbusinesses so people and businesses\ncould buy things you can spend money and\nbuy whatever you wanted because some\npeople were making more money in\nunemployment than they were while they\nwere working a job and some businesses\nhad so much cash in the bank because\nthey got this huge check from the\ngovernment from these business loans\nthat they were giving that they were\njust able to spend money like crazy so\npeople and businesses were buying things\nalthough nothing was being produced but\nthe thing that was being produced was\nmoney\nso\nthis started to create supply chain\nissues because now you go to the store\nand you keep buying all the clothes you\nkeep buying all the stuff that's there\nhowever no clothes are being produced no\nitems are being produced because the\nmanufacturing plants are closed people\nare not going to work so what is that\ngoing to do it creates a supply chain\nshortage because now\npeople are buying things but nothing is\nbeing made how is this possible\nwhat happens if you can print money\nwithout creating wealth because that's\nwhat was happening we were printing\nmoney trillions of dollars without\nactually increasing the amount of wealth\nwell this is what the definition of\ninflation is you're inflating the\nmonetary supply you're increasing the\namount of dollars out there and the cost\nof that is you make the value of each\nindividual dollar go down because now\nyou're just printing money without\nincreasing wealth and so in turn the\nvalue of each individual dollar has to\ngo down and as soon as that started\nhappening i started making videos in\n2020 talking about how\nthe concern right now is deflation\nmeaning the value of the dollar is\ndropping your savings are becoming more\nvaluable your earnings become more\nvaluable however\nbe\nwary of inflation coming in the future\nbecause that's the definition of\ninflation you're printing more money the\nvalue of a dollar will go down it's it's\njust i mean it's almost like simple math\nhowever when this was happening\nthe federal reserve bank was printing\nthe money and they kept saying we're not\nworried about inflation there's no\nconcerns of inflation there's no reason\nwe would have inflation because we can\ndo that now\njust think about that for a second if\nthe government and the fed can print\nmoney on command\nwhy do we have to pay for a mortgage\ncan't they just pay that why do we even\nhave to pay for taxes they can just\nprint that money out of thin air the\nreason why they can't do that is the\nsame reason why they can't give\neverybody a million dollars and expect\neverybody to have a lamborghini is\nbecause when you print this money the\nvalue of the dollar drops so fast\nforward to 2021\nthe early part of 2021 that was when the\nfirst glimpses of high inflation were\nbeing seen\nand in the early part of 2021 the\nfederal reserve bank who's in charge of\nthe monetary system said there's no real\ninflation nothing to be worried about\nthis is a little\nblimp\nand then came\nmarch april and that's when inflation\ndidn't go away it grew a little bit and\nthe inflation the fed came out and they\nsaid okay inflation is getting a little\nbit worse however it's temporary they\nsaid it was transitory nothing to worry\nabout it'll be gone by the end of 2021.\nwell\nfast forward to the end of 2021\ninflation got worse\nand that's when they admitted inflation\nis not transitory\nthis is going to be around for a while\nand during the whole period i kept\nsaying don't expect this to be\ntransitory this is the it doesn't just\nmagically go away\nthen comes 2022\nand\nthat's when\nsome of the stimulus started to go away\nand inflation did not slow down\nand then came the fears of a recession\nand i was talking about this about how\nthe high inflation is causing a slowdown\nin the economy because when you have the\nprices of things go up so much\nmore of your income is being used to pay\nfor your rent and your gas and your\ngroceries so you have less money to go\nout and buy other things and if you have\nless money to buy\nanything else if you have less money to\ngo to chipotle then chipotle is making\nless money if chipotle is making less\nmoney they don't have money to hire more\nemployees they don't have money to open\nmore stores that's what contributes to\nan economic slowdown and that's what was\ngoing on and\nfrom january february march all you kept\nhearing from the government and the fed\nis the economy is so strong there's no\npossible way we could see an economic\nslowdown that continued april may june\neven at the time i was recording this\nvideo i read an article this morning the\nfederal reserve bank said we're not\ngoing to enter a recession it's not\nthere's no reason why we should the\ngovernment even said our economy is so\nstrong\nwe're not seeing any signs of a slowdown\neverybody is doing very well and it\ndoesn't make any sense because\ni mean depending on this areas maybe\nthings will change but if people are\nstruggling paying their rent paying\ntheir gas buying their groceries yeah\npeople are spending money but the reason\nwhy they're spending money is because\nyou have to pay more money for your\ngroceries\nand now i mean if you just think about\nthis from a practical level people are\nhaving less ability to now go out\nand shop and be able to just buy things\nwhich means businesses are hurting\nso\nmy thoughts are unless this inflation\nmagically goes away like the fed says it\nwill\nit is going to contribute to a\na economic slowdown and now how bad will\nit be well it depends on what the\nfederal reserve bank does because the\nfed now is trying to reverse what they\ndid\nin 2020 2021 where these trillions of\ndollars were printed and entered our\neconomic circulation which caused the\nvalue of our savings and earnings to\ndrop it created more inflation so if you\nwant to reverse inflation you have to do\nthe opposite you have to literally burn\ncash you have to take it out of the\nsystem\nso that's why they're working to\nincrease interest rates\nif they keep increasing interest rates\nto fight inflation we are going to enter\na recession\nand that means the economy will slow\ndown it means people will lose their\njobs it means that businesses will go\nunder\nand\nthe question then is\nwhat will the federal reserve bank do\nnext\nwill they then say\nokay\ninflation is under control even though\nmaybe it's not but the economy needs\nhelp so we're going to start inflating\nbecause that's what happened in every\nprevious crash you cut interest rates\nand you print money to help the economy\nboost\nwell if they do that now when we entered\na recession because of inflation you\nmake the root cause of the recession\neven worse\nso\nthis is where i don't know what the fed\nis going to do and it's it is a tough\nsituation and this is where you want to\nbe aware because there are ways for you\nto take advantage of this but what you\nwant to understand is\nthe lesser of two evils is to cause a\nrecession\nbecause\nthat means you're raising interest rates\nmarkets go down\nand some businesses will go under\nhowever\nthis will cause a refresh and things\nwill be able to get better this creates\nopportunity for you to go and buy some\nassets you can find stocks that are on\nsale you can potentially find some\ncryptocurrencies on sale maybe real\nestate you'll find better opportunities\nhowever if the federal reserve bank\nchanges course\nand they say okay inflation is a little\nbit better than where it was and it's\nstabilizing even though it's much higher\nthan what it was before\nbut\nwe're worried about this recession and\nthey start inflating meaning they start\nprinting money they start cutting\ninterest rates well that means now the\ninflation gets worse and now you risk\nsomething like a currency crisis\nand this is significantly worse because\nnow\nthe trust yeah the value of the dollar\ngoes down and that's where you know the\ntype of assets that you want are\ndifferent that's where things like\nphysical gold\nbecome more valuable because that can\nprotect you um from those types of\nthings so now what do you do right\nthat's the real question is yeah yeah\nfirst thing is calm yourself because\nnobody makes rational decisions out of\npanic nobody makes smart decisions out\nof fear\nunderstand that these things happen and\nthat things will be okay so first you\ngot to do is just calm yourself take a\ndeep breath now the second thing is you\nhave to start taking that financial\neducation you want to create that buffer\nnow because even now while things look\nbad yeah gas prices are high prices of\nhigh but they are\nthey could be worse so you want to use\nthis time to now put aside some cash\nthat way you have some money to take\nadvantage of opportunities that might\ncome your way\nnow the next thing is looking for what\ntype of opportunities do you want do you\nwant to invest in stocks do you want to\ninvest in real estate do you want the\nbest of cryptocurrency or or multiple of\non\nthings once you know what you want to\ninvest in you make a list you make a\nlist of the things that you want to own\nand now you're just waiting for a good\nbuying opportunity\nand when you're waiting for a good\nbuying opportunity you do not want to\ntry to perfectly time the market\nbuy things in phases you can buy on the\nway down you don't have to buy all at\nonce this is what i talked about in 2020\nwhen the market was collapsing i said\nlook i'm buying in phases i know what i\nwant to buy i'm buying it on the way\ndown every time it drops another 10 to\n15 i buy more and i buy more\naggressively\nwhen that happens people will think you\nlost your mind because they're gonna say\nwhy would you buy now the market's\ncollapsing the world's gonna end don't\nbuy now\nlook you gotta again calm there's gonna\nbe a lot of emotion there's gonna be a\nlot of panic a lot of fear but the\nsmartest investors are not the ones that\ninvest on a motion it's the ones that\ninvest on finances\nand so cut through that noise just\nunderstand what you want to buy look for\na good buying opportunity and then\nunderstand that if we go the other way\nwhere we start inflating\nwell then you could see the opposite\nhappen you could see asset prices crash\nupwards because now we're inflating\nwe're printing more money and that can\nmean more money flows into the markets\nand that can push asset prices upwards\nso it's knowing what you want to buy\nand in those situations that's where\nthings like gold can also be valuable\nnow the one thing that i want to mention\nabout gold is i don't look at gold like\nan investment for me it's just an\nalternative form of savings it's just\nhard money\nit's just holding something like that\nit's another way to save money so it's\njust finding the rapper opportunity but\nat the end of the day the number one\nbest investment that you can make in any\nsituation is investing in yourself\nand understanding what is the most\nimportant thing right now your physical\nhealth your mental health your spiritual\nhealth your your financial health and\nunderstanding that you know there's\nalways going to be opportunities to take\ncare of yourself in all of these places\nbut you need to be prepared\nand you know you put in that work now\nthat way you can find the best\nopportunities that we can take advantage\nof them because like i said earlier\nthe most millionaires are made during\nrecessions and crashes than any other\ntime but this means you have to think\ndifferently than the majority of people\ngoing back to why i call it the minority\nmindset it's not about the way you look\nor your ethnicity or skin color it's the\nmindset of thinking differently than the\nmajority of people and this is where a\nlot of people get upset you get angry\nyou kick and cry and scream\nbut this is where you want to think\ndifferent\nlook for the opportunity because it is\nthere and the last thing that i want to\nmention\nwhich is kind of\nsad and scary but something you want to\nbe aware of is when that 2020 the money\nprinting happened\nthere was\nit was known as the biggest financial\nfraud in the history of america and\nthis has just come to light in the\nmiddle part of 2022 where they said that\nso many business owners and people who\nare not business owners took advantage\nof the government because there was such\nlittle oversight\nwhere the government was just giving\nmoney to corporations and businesses and\npeople where it was the biggest fraud in\nthe history of time and even people\nbecause so many people were taking this\nunemployment money that they shouldn't\nand i remember and i'll tell you from my\npersonal experience because i have a\nbusiness\ni kept being told just you have to take\nthis it was called ppp this ppp money\nit's free you don't have to pay it back\nthe government is giving you this money\nyou should take it and they were giving\na lot of money i don't remember the\nexact number but it was quite i mean\ntens of thousands of dollars\nand uh you know we had expenses like my\nrent for our office was like 4 300 a\nmonth we have employees we had a lot of\nissues going on because we didn't know\nwhere the economy was gonna go\nbut i told everyone i said we're not\ntaking that money i told my banker told\nmy accountant and they all thought that\ni was dumb because it's free money but i\nwas like you don't get it\nthe most expensive type of money in the\nworld is free money i know who's paying\nfor it because when the government\nspends money somebody has to pay for it\neither they raise your taxes to pay for\nit because you know that they need more\nincome or they cut their expenses\nmeaning they cut your social security\nthey cut their welfare well for they cut\ntheir things that they're doing or\nthey do the hidden tax which is\ninflation which means now\npeople are going to pay for it in the\nform of higher prices\nand who pays the price the poor and the\nfinancially uneducated yeah and i was\nlike i don't want to be a part of that\ni'm not contributing to this because i\nknow uh myself i know my values and i\ndon't want to be a part of that and so\neveryone thought that i was a dumb one\nbut here i am look i'm not i don't want\nto contribute to this and i i\ni know who's going to pay the price\nand i said the poor and the financially\nuneducated and i purposely did not say\nthe middle class because when you have\nthis type of high inflation\nthe middle class gets wiped out yep and\nit's the people who understand money\nthat become more wealthy the people that\ndon't understand money that don't become\nwealthy and it's very unfortunate the\nreality it's\nthis is the way the system works and you\nhave to understand it because it is\nprofitable to keep people poor yeah and\nit's very sad but this is why you have\nto get financially and financially\neducated absolutely and i think everyone\nwho's listening the way to do that\nis make sure you subscribe to market\nbriefs and make sure you subscribe to\nthe minority mindset youtube channel as\nwell uh really really important and\npowerful ways to make sure that you have\nthe education and insight you need to\nmake those important decisions i think\nso many of us are making decisions as\njust pretty rightly said
