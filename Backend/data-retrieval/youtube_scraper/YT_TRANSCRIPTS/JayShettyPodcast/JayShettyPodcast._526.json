    "transcript": "i was told just you know you just don't\nhave what it takes you're not good\nenough i added my own word to it is i'm\nnot good enough yet you don't have to\ntake something that was true one time\nand make it true for all time you talk a\nlot about your belief in miracles\nright and like magic almost to some\ndegree as well yeah tell us about where\nthat belief came from and what is a\nmiracle to you like what counts as a\nmiracle to you that is such a great\nquestion i've never been asked before um\ni love that so\ni was raised in a home that was very\nreligious um and sometimes people say\nthat in a way of almost they're scarred\nby it but i feel like the the religious\naspects of my life have\nreally blessed me so much they've made\nme i feel like a deeper person they\nbelieve made me believe in something\ngreater than myself and you know my um i\nwas raised in a mormon home and um you\nknow and i really combine the aspects of\nreligion still in my life i still go to\nchurch on sunday i actually teach a\nsunday school class for the teenagers\nand and it's something that's only\nbettered my life um\nand i think that a lot of times people\nsee religion as divisive\ni think that when religion is used for\nwhat it's actually meant for it's it's\ninclusive it's it's it helps people bind\ntogether it gives you opportunities for\nservice it gives you opportunities to to\nuplift other people and to be uplifted\nwhen you're the one that's weak in these\nlike communities of you know as long as\nit's something that you know my parents\nalways taught us that the basis of you\nknow whether we believe this or they\nbelieve that what we need to always rely\non is it's love love is the basis of all\nof it and if you start to make it a\ndivide you're missing the point of what\nyou know religion was supposed to be and\nso for me it's it's a mixture of\nreligious um aspects and spirituality\njust connecting to something greater\nthan myself and\ni think that um\ni don't know when i really started i\njust believe so strongly that um that\nmiracles happen all the time and i like\nto look for miracles in my life every\nday um and i think that it really became\neven stronger for me after i lost people\ni loved um because suddenly this other\nside you know like i've heard my whole\nlife that we go somewhere after we die\nand when my best friend passed away and\nshortly after that my father passed away\num\nsomeone i loved so much two people i\nlove so much were on that other side and\ni just started to really think where are\nthey what are they doing like how close\ncan they get and i've been given so many\nlittle\nmiracles for lack of a better term in my\nlife that show me that they are looking\nout for me and the more i look for that\nthe more i see it and i've had such\nlittle\nyou know everything from tiny special\ntiny miracles to big things that have\nhappened that just make me feel powerful\nin a way almost like i imagine i walk\nthrough life with these angels around me\nthat are looking out for me and\nwhispering things in my ear and helping\nme and it makes me feel almost like i\nhave a super power i'm a superhero\nbecause i've got the strength and angels\nfrom the other side and i i pray for\nhelp all the time from that asking\nspecific angels sometimes it's my\ngrandma i'm asking for help sometimes\nit's um you know my best friend my dad\nsometimes i'm like hey i want to channel\nlucille bald today i want lucille bald\nto be my special angel today you know\nlike i'll ask specific angels for\nhelp i know that might sound weird but\nit it does make me feel like i go\nthrough life with help from the other\nside and extra power yeah that's\nbeautiful that's amazing and i love that\nyou talked about how miracles are both\nsmall and big things absolutely\nsometimes it could be the tiniest thing\nthat happens in your day that changes\nyour mood or is like a little lesson or\na piece of wisdom or whatever it is and\nthen it can be something huge like right\nyou know the great successes and\nachievements you've had in your life and\ni think it's beautiful when we can see\nmiracles in both\ni think sometimes we're waiting for\nmiracles to be like these big gigantic\nchanges right and actually sometimes\nmiracles aren't like that at all\nabsolutely and like even sometimes my\nfamily all talks all the time about like\noh our angels are looking out for us\nbecause\nwe all have this thing in common that\nour dad is over there he's one of our\nangels and so we'll always even if it's\nlike oh i remembered right before i left\nthe house that i should grab whatever it\nis you know it's like oh my angels are\nwhispering in my ear you know and like i\nsaid i think that whatever you look for\nin life you're going to see more of and\nif you are not looking for something\nyeah you're going to be like well i've\nnever seen miracles i never get that but\nif you it's like when you all of a\nsudden become aware of an artist all of\na sudden you're like oh they're\neverywhere\nyou're on that billboard they're on the\nradio oh how come i never heard of this\nperson before but it's because now\nthey're in your peripheral view you've\nseen them and and i think it's the same\nwith gratitude or with miracles or with\nwhatever it is you're looking for in\nlife if you look for it you'll see it\nthat's such a great point the way to\ntest it is if you ever buy a new car or\nright if you ever buy a new car you're\nthinking about buying a new car and then\nyou got on the road you see that car\neverywhere right it could be a rare car\nit may be a\ncommon car whatever it is but you it is\nexactly that whatever's in your\nperipheral view you start to see it\neverywhere and and i think the point you\njust made is so beautiful because i\nthink sometimes it's like when you're\nrushing out the home\nand you\nnotice you forgot something someone's\nlike oh i forgot it like it's almost\nlike a negative feeling right rather\nthan like oh thanks i i remembered right\nlike the way you're seeing right and\nit's so interesting because it's such a\nsmall thing and we do it every day i\nknow i do it sometimes it's like i get\ndownstairs i'm about to get in my car\nand i'm like oh i forgot my wallet or\nwhatever it is right rather than oh i'm\nso glad i remembered rather than getting\nto the store\nyeah right\nyeah or even having a moan to be like oh\nthanks\nthank you my angels or or whatever it is\nthat you see as your you know thank you\nmy brain for being smart and remembering\nwhatever you want to see it is i i like\nthat yeah well you're just yourself\nanyways that's cool\num you know and one thing that i think\nhas helped me so much i talk about all\nthe time is my gratitude journal yes has\nbeen very like transformative in my life\nin this like i didn't realize like\nsomething so simple would make such a\nbig impact and it's things like that\nwhere um automatic responses\nstart to become more gratitude based\nthan negative base and it's exactly like\nyou said the same exact situation where\ni can be like i am so stupid that i\nalways get to my car and i forget\nsomething or oh thank heavens i\nremembered before i left you know and\nit's i've noticed a shift happen in my\nmind of all these little tiny things\nthat happen automatically now that turn\nmore towards an optimistic attitude\nrather than a beat myself up attitude or\na complaint attitude um all because i\npractice every single night\nfor five minutes before i go to bed\nlike several things i'm grateful for and\nit's just those little tiny things that\nmake\nthe biggest difference in life and i\noften think that when we want to change\nyou i think sometimes i used to be like\noh gosh i've got so much work to do and\nlike i have to change everything in\norder to be a better person but it's\nlike no it's\ntiny tiny pivots tiny tiny tweaks like\nlittle things that are gonna just make\nthese huge impacts over time and it's\nall about just one pivot at a time not\nshifting everything\none tiny time absolutely when did you\nstart your gratitude journal process\nlike when did that become a regular\nhabit um two years ago oh wow okay so\nfairly recent so yeah it's been a fairly\nrecent feeling it's been a long enough\ntime to practice it but it's been fairly\nrecent right yeah and where did you get\nintroduced to it and why\nwhy was it just you write an article or\na book or you heard it somewhere or was\nit i just heard it enough yeah you know\ni'd heard enough people say that this is\na good practice to do because i've\nlistened to a lot like i like to fill my\nlife with positivity whether it's\nreading like renee brown books and my as\nyou know on audible as i drive in my car\nor listening to podcasts and i feel like\nthe more i fill my life with positivity\nyou know\nthe more positive i am obviously and so\nthis was something i just kept hearing\nabout and every year i like to pick a\nword\nto work on and last year as a result of\nkind of starting this gratitude journal\ni decided i'm going to dive in my word\nfor last year was gratitude and it was\nreally nice and i think that's a really\ngood way to approach new year's\nresolutions because you can make tons of\nlittle like goals but they all my all my\ngoals always focus around my word for\nthe year so it's like this is my big\ngoal and then i'm gonna just make lots\nof little like things that will\nhopefully lead to that and anyway so\nthat's when i really dove into it was\nlike we're doing this i'm gonna\nvisualize it i'm gonna write it i'm\ngonna be it i love that and how many\nthings do you do every night\nonly three okay it's very manageable i\ndo three when i go to bed and then i do\nthree when i wake up\nso it's just like the book ends of my\nday and then you know sometimes when i'm\nreally ambitious i sit there and i'll\nvisualize those things and i'll try to\nlike feel them actually not just write\nthen see then actually feel and then\ngo to bed\ni love it i love the sound effects\nhello what was what was the intention\nfor the year of 2020 what was the word\nfor this year oh my my word for this\nyear is actually magic so oh it's funny\nthat you started i have no idea and you\nstart off the podcast with that word\nthat's crazy again i've heard that word\nso much in the last month see i haven't\nbecause i probably because i'm looking\nfor it and i'm thinking about it and the\nreason i chose magic is i feel like\ni don't even know how to describe it i\nfeel like i used to live a little more\nmagically\nwhere i made big wishes and i dreamed\nbig and um\nyou know i didn't even realize this but\nsomeone was telling me that every eight\nyears it's a year of manifestation and i\nguess this year is one of those years\nand so eight years ago was a year of\nmanifestation so i was looking back at\neight years ago and the things that i\nbelieved i could do the things i wished\nfor the things that were like on my\nradar it is amazing what has come full\ncircle since that year and i didn't even\nrealize it um but i used to be so good\nat making wishes and believing\nfull-heartedly that i would achieve them\nand that they would come back to me and\nbecause i believed in good things good\nthings came and not that i'm a pessimist\ni just feel like a little bit of that\nlike you know dreamer in me has become\nkind of realistic\nand so i want to just open it up to like\nliving magically like feeling magical\nfeeling powerful feeling like all those\nthings and so um getting back to that\nthat side of myself that i think has\njust gotten a little bit realistic\nyeah if that makes sense yeah that makes\nso much sense you know you always have\nlike struck me as quite a magical person\nin general oh thank you i feel like you\nhave yeah yeah i felt like i don't know\nif you showed me dressed up as dobby or\nmaybe\nno i just feel like you you have a very\nmagical presence\non stage too like there's that and which\nis like i don't i don't often say that\nso i'm not just saying it it's an\ninteresting thing that i picked up on so\nnow that all seems to line up but i love\nwhat you're saying because i think as\nchildren we saw and believed in magic\nyeah and i've always been really into\nillusion and illusionists and magic so\npeople like david blaine or darren brown\nand i'm always fascinated by it and and\nthe truth is as you become older you\nwant to know how it's done yeah whereas\nwhen you're a kid you just appreciate it\nand you just yeah wow that's\nmind-blowing and and i think it's almost\nlike you're like that like even whether\nyou're on a ride or you're in a movie or\nwhatever it is like your adult mind just\nwants to figure out how everything's\ndone right but you lose that sense of\nmagic you lose that sense of spark of\nfeeling of wonder yeah and\njust being allowing yourself to just be\nlike actually it doesn't matter i don't\nneed i don't need to know i'm allowed to\nexperience\nand i think that that is one of the most\nimportant things that made my career\nhappen is that when i first started\ni you know i wrote my first album\nnever having written a song before like\nmy own composition never like i wrote my\nfirst 12 songs or all the 12 songs that\nare on my first album that album changed\nmy life it took me literally across the\nworld it went gold in multiple countries\nand i had never\nlike written like i was i'd been a\nmusician my entire life but i didn't\nknow the rules of songwriting i didn't\nknow the rules of how to market an album\ni didn't i just worked my butt off and i\nbelieved that it would happen\nand\nit happened and i think that's you know\nlooking back on my beginnings especially\na girl that was like\ni want to and kind of invent my own\ngenre music of playing electronic violin\nmusic\nit's all instrumental and i want to\ndance while i play and i want to tour\nand wear fun costumes and what yeah\neveryone listening to be like yeah this\ngirl's insane and i know that because i\ni sat in front of people and tried to\npitch what i was doing i showed them\nlike videos of me doing it in my living\nroom like being like see this is the\nvision and you know i went to record\nlabels and management and\nno one believed it but there was\nsomething inside me where i believed it\nso strongly because i just had that\nmagic inside of me of like no i\ni know i can do this and i made big\nwishes i made big plans\nand when you don't know what's like\npossible and impossible sometimes you\nend up doing the impossible yeah and i\nlook back at just you know and like what\nwhat i've gotten to do with my life and\nin the last 10 years and i'm just like\nit was kind of impossible but i didn't\nknow that and so it happened\nyeah yeah what have you found happens\nwhen\nyou believe something but it doesn't\nnecessarily happen at the right time or\nthe time you wanted it to actually not\nthe right time i take that back yeah you\nknow it's it's almost like that feeling\nof\nwhat i mean by you is i i agree with you\ni think that belief is so powerful but\nsometimes people will say well i have\nthis belief\nbut it's not happening right or right or\nmaybe you've had a belief at times\nbut it didn't happen in the way you\nthought it was going to happen like i\nhave so many stories i could think of\nwhich one do i tell whichever one yeah\nwhichever i think the most um\nthe biggest one i can think of was when\ni first started i wanted you know i had\nthis dream of what i wanted to be what i\ncould see and it's what i am now that's\nwhat i like saw in my head\nand i the i i tried all these different\nways to get it out there and every door\njust closed in my face and the most\npublic one and the most dramatic one was\ni auditioned for america's got talent\nthis is in 2010 so this is 10 years ago\nand um you know i made it all the way to\nthe round where it's like live\nyou know there's like i think it was the\ntop you know semi-finals whatever and\nnow at this point america calls and they\nvote for you it was like really exciting\nand in my mind all i wanted to do was\nwin this show i knew that if i won the\nshow my life would change forever in an\ninstant and you know you win a million\ndollars you win a vegas residency like\nit's a big deal and\nand they kind of also drill it into your\nhead that this is the biggest moment of\nyour life don't blow it and so\nhere i was i'd never really performed in\nfront of any more than like 100 200\npeople\nand here i am on this like live stage\nwith like millions of viewers watching\nthey even told me before i stepped on\nthe stage there's 11 million people\ntuned in right now\ngood luck you know what\nso i go out there i'm in the middle of\nmy performance and i hear\nthe buzz and that means i got x so not\nonly was it i mean\nin that moment i knew that i'd blown it\nlike i'd blown the biggest moment of my\nlife\nand i walk up to the judges after the\npro after i finished playing and i got\ntold that i sounded like rats being\nstrangled it was on live television like\neveryone i know is watching\num\nincluding a lot of other people\nand you know and i was told just you\nknow you just don't have what it takes\nyou're not good enough and i was\ndevastated and humiliated really bad\ncombo and i remember um i i went\nbackstage afterwards like i held it\ntogether on stage you know like trying\nnot to cry and then i ran into the\nbathroom because that's the only place\nyou could be alone and i just sunk to\nthe floor and i sobbed like i sobbed the\nugly cry for a long time until they came\nin and found me and they're like we're\nclosing up like you gotta go\nand um so you know i packed up my little\nviolin and i just honestly didn't know\nif i could get on a stage ever again\nbecause i was just\nso embarrassed like you know even\nembarrassed in front of my family and\neven though they were like you were you\nwere great we love you we're proud of\nyou it was just\ni just was like i don't even think i can\nlook myself in the eye again\num\nbut there's that inner voice you know\nwhether i call it my angels or whether\nyou call it your gut or whether you call\nit intuition whatever you you call it we\nall have it\nand\nit told me\nyou're not done yet and sometimes that\nvoice will be like it's time to try a\ndifferent road like there's different\nthings you know but listening to your\ninner gut will always tell you\nwhere you should go and at this time it\nwas it's not over yet and you know i\nkept moving forward and i ended up\nshortly after that you know trying\nseveral other things and then\ndiscovering youtube which um this was\nthe early days of youtube i put some\nvideos out they went quote unquote viral\nfor the time and it changed my life and\nlooking back on it like thank heavens i\ndidn't win america's got to like think\nheavens i did not you know you're locked\ninto these contracts that are really\nrough and i never would have been able\ncontractually to start my youtube\nchannel i would have been locked into a\nrecord label deal i'm now like an\nindependent artist and i tour the world\ni do it on my own terms and\ni never could have done that if i had\ngotten what i wanted yeah and you know\nthere i just have so many of these\nexperiences where sometimes what you're\nfighting for and what you want and the\ndoor you're banging on\nit's just not quite the right door and\nyou just got to turn a little bit you\ngot to listen to your own voice that\ntells you\nwhere to go is it time to try something\nelse is it time to keep pushing is it\ntime to like just accept where you're at\nlike whatever it is\nlike listen to your heart because it\nwill never lead you astray and maybe\nit's just not the right door maybe it's\njust not the right time\nyou're amazing that was awesome that's\nso beautiful to hear we have we have so\nmuch more in common than i knew oh\nreally yeah i can relate to so much of\nwhat you just said right now and i've\nprobably said it in other interviews\nthat i've been in just that feeling of\nwhat you explained of\nhow\nsometimes what you want\nis not actually the best thing for you\nno and and i've been in that position so\nmany times and i literally said this to\nsomeone a couple of nights ago i was\nlike if i got everything that i wanted\nmost people wouldn't know who i am or\nwhat i'm doing or anything like i would\nhave just ended up in this\nweird side job that i just thought was\nthe dream you know when i was trying to\nbreak through and get people to listen\nto me and the amount of doors that were\nshot on my face just in the way you've\nexplained\nwhere i've always talked about youtube\nwas like my last option yes it was\ndefinitely\neverything like i sorry youtube we were\nnot my first choice it was like i was\nlike one of those moments of just like\nevery door had been shut it was like you\nknow\nat that time 10 media companies had told\nme that my inspirational video ideas\nwere not good enough and would never\nmake it and i had three execs tell me i\nwas too old to be in media i was 28\nyears old and they're like you're too\nold everyone is trying to get into\nmedia's 21 22 and they'll just start a\nblog or like you know just just do that\nand then everyone's like there's no\ncareers in media like there's no there's\nno and you don't even have a\ncommunications background or a media\nbackground or a film background because\nthat's not my background yeah and so it\nwas just for me as well there was just\none option that option was to try and do\nit myself yeah and so when i'm hearing\nyou speak\nit's i love hearing someone else say it\nbecause it's it's kind of like\nreaffirming for me to hear it from you\nthat something as big as winning\namerica's got talent\nwhich is huge which is huge but you're\nbut in your experience you've even found\nthat that wasn't the end of the road\nright not winning that and i think that\nthat and actually i find and i've said\nthis to people before sometimes it's the\npeople that don't win right that go on\nto do more incredible things than the\npeople that win and i wonder if it's\npartially because it gives you this\nlittle like\nyou know\nand you know for me i think in that\nexperience looking back on it um a lot\nof times people are like what were they\nthinking they like they didn't see what\nyou had how could they have been so\nwrong but\nthey weren't necessarily wrong i agree\nyou know what i mean like looking back\nat that video i really didn't perform\nwell like i was a baby in it i was\nterrified i hadn't really earned my\nstripes yet as a performer i was\ntoo early on that stage and where i was\nat as like this you know i just come up\nwith this idea of dancing and playing\nand i was kind of awkward at it really\nawkward at it so they weren't wrong and\nwhen they said you're not good enough\nthey weren't exactly wrong they didn't\nhave to be mean but\num the point is though that i added my\nown word to it is i'm not good enough\nyet and sometimes when people give you\nharsh critique it's easy to like take it\nto your soul like that's who i am i'm\nnot good enough and i'll never be good\nenough but no it's tonight you aren't\ngood enough and that's okay to say and\nthat's okay to accept for yourself\ntonight i wasn't quite what i wanted to\nbe\nyet i will be better tomorrow i'm gonna\nshow up i'm gonna work hard and now i\ncan say honestly when i step on a stage\ni've earned my stripes i worked my butt\noff like not only to like you know\ncreate all the social media stuff and\nlearn how to live in that world but all\nhonestly just in my skills and my craft\nlike i've honed in i still practice it\nand so now it's like yeah i now have\nearned my place in this entertainment\nworld and just because i wasn't good\nenough\nyet back then doesn't mean i would never\nbe just because you're not where you\nwant to be right now doesn't mean\nyou're not going to get there\nand so yeah yeah you don't have to take\nsomething that was true one time and\nmake it true for all time like that\nthat's the way i was trying to say it\nyeah no no no i was thinking about it\nwhile you were saying i was like so\noften we take something that was said\none time and we're like okay\nthat's true for all time now and that's\nit right and and there is no reality i\nlove what you just said about adding the\nword yet to the end and and about\naccepting that it's the same like\ni\ndo you mind if i share my version i\ndon't think i've said this before so i\nwant to share it because you're\ninspiring me to share it so\ni was working for a company and i was\ndoing extremely extremely well there but\ni felt that i wanted to leave to work on\nmy passion which was create videos and\nshare these ideas that were inspiring\nand motivating and i believe it would\nhelp people in their life i hadn't yet\nmade anything and the company asked me\nto create my ideal job profile\nand so i created it which was\ninterviewing people like this creating\nvideos that help educate and inspire and\ninform people and making content in a\nway that people would feel better being\nimpacted by it and i remember speaking\nto the chief marketing officer of this\ncompany\nand i was on the phone with them\nand they were looking through\nmy list of my ideal job and they said\njay so you want to be an influencer and\nyou want to be a celebrity and i said no\ni that wasn't there was no that word was\nnot on my list it was like no i want to\ndo interviews i want to be a host i want\nto be a content creator i want to edit\nthese videos it was it was and they said\nno you want to be a celebrity or an\ninfluencer and i said\nno no i think you've got it all wrong i\ni just really believe that i should be\nmaking content they said well we don't\nhave space for celebrities and\ninfluencers at this company\nand literally this phone down moment and\ni left like a week later now so many\npeople since that day have always said\nto me like oh don't you don't you want\nto go back and show them what's happened\nand tell them and i'm like i want to go\nback and thank them\nlike i want to go back and express\ngratitude to them and be like thank you\nso much\nfor telling me that there wasn't any\nspace for this role i still don't see\nmyself as an influencer or a celebrity\nthat's not the point but i'm so glad\nthat i was told that this role didn't\nexist there yeah because if it did i'd\nstill be working a full-time job having\nto create content that was right for\nthat place\nand not being able to\nsame as you said being an independent\nartist getting to create content that i\nreally believe in and that i really love\nand they can spread all across the world\nso anyway i i'm grateful that yeah thank\nyou now i love that it's just this idea\nthat the doors that close that are\ndevastating are\noftentimes the best thing that could\never happen to you um but it's only\ngonna be the best thing that ever\nhappens to you if you keep moving\nforward yeah if you keep taking steps\nand say okay well where's next you know\nwhat's the next thing um i'm you know\nstill believing in yourself despite\nthe fact that maybe someone else didn't\nyeah\ni'm inspired to sing actually i like\nstuff i'm so inspired now honestly like\nyou just like\nput my soul on fire it's amazing it's\nlike it really is awesome tell me about\nwe've talked about professional failure\nor professional rejection and\npurpose-based challenges this is\npurposeful to you the work that you do\nit's not just you're a musician and you\ndo it from a career point of view it's\npurposeful\nbut tell us about the personal\nchallenges that you've broke through as\nwell like you've battled with anorexia\nyes and that\ni mean i'll let you tell me whether that\nwas harder or easier than a professional\nchallenge but it sounds like it's a lot\nharder when it's yeah personal and with\nyou and your body and your mind i mean\ntell us about how you went through that\nexperience and how you overcame that\nyes and i actually love to talk about\nthis because so many people you know to\nsome degree or another deal with this\nwhether they are diagnosably anorexic or\nwhether they just some days hate their\nbody like i think that a lot of people\ndeal with this and i think depression is\nsomething that um whether it's like\nclinical depression or um chemical or\nwhether it's just situational like\neverybody deals with that at times of\ntheir life and so i think it's something\nthat's so important to talk about and\nlike learn\nfor yourself and understand how you go\nthrough these phases and you know i\nrealized when i was in college i was um\nyou know am i i think\nthe middle of college when i finally\ncame to realizing oh my gosh i'm\nanorexic and it took a while to come to\nthat realization because i had been\ndepressed for a really long time and\num it happened so slowly that it just\nconsumed me and i would have defended it\nforever being like no i'm just really\nhealthy because i was exercising all the\ntime and i was eating like a bunny like\ni was eating all like vegetables and you\nknow so i would have defended it forever\nthat no i'm just healthy but i finally\nhad this moment where i realized\nthat i had sacrificed everything for\nthis and it happened the realization for\nme happened in the most simple moment\nand it makes me really emotional but my\nsister's my best friend\nand she was my roommate at the time and\num\nall of our roommates we were all really\nclose really good friends and i heard\nthem all laughing in the other room and\njust talking someone was telling a funny\nstory about a bad date or something and\nthey were all laughing but i just didn't\neven have the energy to get off my bed\nto go in and join because i just and i\nalso just thought like they wouldn't\neven want me to join i just was so\ndepressed\nand then my sister came in the room and\nsat on her bed and i looked at her and\nthought\ni don't know when we became strangers\nbut i don't i don't even know how to\ntalk to her anymore and it was because i\nhad gotten so consumed in my mind\nby like anorexia is fully consuming all\nyou think about is yourself all you\nthink about is your next meal all you\nthink about is what you look like like\nit's um\nit becomes a very selfish disease that\nis very isolating and it's not like\nyou're selfish in the terms of like oh\ni'm awesome like it's selfish in terms\nof all you can worry about is yourself\nbecause you're so consumed um\nand so i didn't even realize but i was\nlike i don't remember the last time we\nhad like a real conversation or laughed\nor talked together and\nthat gave me the courage to be like\nsomething is wrong something is\ndefinitely wrong in here and i need to\nfigure it out and so i started going to\ntherapy um because i was finally willing\nto fight for\nhappiness again i realized i was sad and\nyou know and you know it took me about\ntwo years to fully come out of this\nfirst cycle of like\ndepression and pull out of it and come\nout of anorexia and become like oh my\ngosh i think i'm healthy and you know\nsince then i i find it being like um\nyou know it's gonna always be a part of\nmy life in the weird way i don't know\nhow else to say it but it's very much in\nthe background it's something i don't\ndeal with on a regular day-to-day basis\nit but sometimes when i'm like stressed\nor when i'm worried about something or\nwhen i'm over like exhausted that's when\nit thinks it has room to come back and\nit tries to sneak back into my life and\nnow it's to the point where rather than\ntaking two years to come out of it now\nit's like oh i recognize you\nand you're not welcome here like you're\nnot a part of my life and um and i i\nreally one of the most helpful books i\never read for my anorexia was a book\ncalled life without ed and it's where\nthis woman personified her eating\ndisorder and she talked to it and she\nwould say she would have conversations\nwith it and talk sense to it because you\nrealize there's a dialogue in your mind\nand it tells you sometimes really nasty\nthings and to her that was not her\nthat was ed it was her eating disorder\nand so i started to do that i started to\nsee these horrible thoughts in my mind\nas they're not me anorexia is not who i\nam it's like this little like thing\nthat's come into my life and it's not\nwelcome and so i constantly remind it to\nleave and when i like if i can't see a\npicture of myself and have that thought\nof like oh my gosh like i look huge or\nif i catch myself in a mirror and think\nsomething nasty i now immediately\ntell that you're not welcome\nwe don't talk to ourselves like that i\ndon't entertain those thoughts and then\ni'll say something nice to myself like i\nam strong like there are so many\nwonderful things about my body like i'm\nhealthy i'm strong i can dance i like to\nrun like i you know um and so it's\nchoosing what i am going to let stay now\nand also um\ni think that there there's it's\nsometimes takes work and we don't always\nput that into play we all know it takes\nwork to be healthy and to eat right and\nto exercise and take care of our bodies\nbut what about our minds and how much\nattention do we give to the happiness\nand\nbeing positive and you know that's why i\nwrite my gratitude journal all these\nlike little practices i have in my life\nand then i think the biggest one for me\nis just listening to that voice and when\nit says something that's unfair i\nlearned years ago when i was going\nthrough therapy and anorexia you know to\nnot entertain the bad\nlike i don't do that and it's very\nempowering to say that to stop your own\nthought and be like nope\nit's not who i am\n[Music]\nself-love you know yeah\nno that's great i love the way you've\nbroken down the process for all of us\nand thank you for the recommendations on\nthe books too it's always i know the\naudience loves hearing what books help\nand work and so if anyone's struggling\nwith that in particular it sounds like a\nfantastic book that really it really\nhelps you understand the voices in your\nmind and your head and recognizing which\nones are not you that's 100 true yeah\nthat's 100 true it's always like a bad\nfriend i think it was gandhi who said um\ndon't let anyone walk through your mind\nwith their dirty feet yeah and it's\nalmost like sometimes it's your dirty\nfeet\nor another thing that is inside of you\nit's almost doing it to yourself yeah\nbut you're so right that that negative\nvoice in our heads is not us it's like\nbeing a friend with a bad you know it's\nlike being friends with the negative\ninfluence and absolutely you started\nspending so much time with him it sounds\nlike your voice now yeah so i think\nthat's a really important lesson well\nit's interesting how\nit's like we've written these stories\nand these beliefs in our mind about who\nwe are\nand\ni finally came to the realization that\nif i wrote this story and became this\nonce upon time somewhere along the line\ni started to believe these things i\nstarted to write this and then i\nreinforce it every day in my mind i\nrewrite the story every day\nand i punish myself over and over and\nover again for a belief that i wrote\nonce upon a time so if i wrote it once\nand if i believe it now\nthen i can write a new one yeah i can\nchange it it's going to take time\nbecause our minds love familiarity even\nif it's negative and it you know that's\njust a pattern our minds run on patterns\nand so it's like okay start to break the\npattern it's going to take time it took\nme two years the first time because i\nwas pretty deeply entrenched in a very\nunhealthy\nvery very um trapped pattern you know\ni'm not saying it's going to take\neverybody two years but if it does\nthat's okay don't look at yourself today\nand think this is who you are forever\nbecause i can't even tell you what a\ndifferent person i am now like you\ncalled me magical in college\nno one would have called me magical in\nthat time my roommates would have been\nlindsay's really tired she's very you\nknow she's she's nice but i just didn't\nhave the energy to be like out there for\nother people and be kind and be as\nloving because i was so\ntrapped in this like tornado inside\nmyself and\ni'm like if i could change from that\nperson to like where i am now where i\nyou know i\ni love to share with people i\ni feel like anyone can do it this is a\nprocess that\nstart where you are today start to love\nyourself start to be kind yourself start\nto fill your life with more and more\npositivity\nand\nyou can get to be you can get anywhere\nyou want whether it's like i said my\njourney of like getting off america's\ngot talent having to work step by step\nto like become the violinist i am now or\nwhether it's looking in the mirror and\nbeing able to say like you're beautiful\nto yourself like\nstart where you're at but you can get\nthere i honestly believe that anyone can\nbe there\nyeah and it takes work still like of\ncourse\nyou know i still go through times like\nlast weekend i had a real\ndepressed weekend where i was like dang\nit like i'm in a funk i'm in a depressed\nstage and i don't like being here but i\nrecognize now\nthat that's okay it's not who i am it's\na passing experience and i think too\noften we like attach ourselves and our\ndefinition of self to like i'm depressed\nlike this is me no it's not me\nit's a phase it's like the cycle of the\nmoon sometimes something's covered with\nshadows sometimes it's bright it doesn't\nmean it's not still there just because\nyou can't see it and totally i sometimes\nget a little covered up yeah and i just\nhave to like go to all my things like\ncall my therapist do all the things that\ni know will help me i now take ballroom\ndance lessons that really helps me\npull out of these like you know i called\nmy teachers like actually can we have an\nemergency ballroom lesson today because\ni'm just feeling down you know and i\nthink it's really important to learn\nlike what are the kind of things that\nwork for you and don't attach your worth\nand your definition to how you feel in a\nmoment because yeah they come and go\nabsolutely just like the weather just\nbecause it's rainy outside you know like\noh i am now rain yeah right it's not\nlike rainy inside the same with the sun\nand you're so right about having\nsomething though and i feel movement is\nsuch a big part of it yeah i mean\nballroom dancing for you you know\nwhatever it is for you it's like i feel\nmovement is always a powerful thing to\nadd to that space to get you out of your\nhead i always find that whether some\npeople like running and it does and\nthat's what i mean like i love this\nexample of ballroom dancing because it\ndoesn't have to be exercise in the\ntraditional sense even though we know\nexercise is great for breaking through\nour depression patterns and negative\npatterns it's like exercise can be fun\nit can be a sport it can be dance it can\nbe so many other things so don't feel\nbound to just exercise well i love that\nyou said one time on one of your\npodcasts that your wife will dance every\nday she does it every day and i was like\nthat's amazing like nothing great and\nyou know she will say offbeat that's\nwhere she'll add off\nyou don't have to be in a mate you don't\nhave to be derek huff yeah in order to\nyeah you know or julia i like it yeah i\nlove them both and they they're like\nyeah we love amazing but\nyou don't have to be like that in order\nto like enjoy movement and\nthey said the same thing yeah even\njulian and derek would say exactly julie\nhad julian on the podcast yes and so she\nsaid the same exact thing she was just\nlike yeah like you don't have she wants\npeople to just move their body now yeah\ni love that and tell us about obviously\nyou mentioned it earlier as well like\nlosing your best friend and your father\nlike close around the same sort of time\nright those sound like\nlike very formative experiences like\nvery transformative experiences that\nyou know you you seem to have processed\nin a positive way where you you know\nthat they're still in your life and\nthey're still benefiting you what else\nhas\nwhat was it like going through that loss\nand how were you able to use it as a\nthis now not just feeling but this\ngenuine reality that you experienced\nwith them and still being involved in\nyour life\nyeah you know\nit was uh\nit was so formative in a way because i\nfeel like i mean i've i'd never lost\nanyone before that and i feel like it\ngave me this\nvery strong empathy that i never had\nbefore where now i can i just feel\nthings a little deeper honestly like my\nemotions now are always like right up to\nmy eyeballs i'm like a second away from\ncrying all the time not in a bad way\njust like whether i'm watching a horse\nmovie you know and like the racehorse is\nabout to win like oh my gosh tears will\nflood or whether like someone's telling\nme an emotional story or like i cry on\nstage all the time like\njust telling my fans i love them i start\nto cry i love that you know but i just\nfeel things like i've always been a very\nfeely person because i'm an artist but\nlike it's there's a depth to it now and\ni think that um going through hard\nthings can either give you like um you\nknow they can either make you harder and\ntougher or they can make you\nstronger you know\nand i just think that sometimes\nwe feel like these hard things like they\nhardness but um i almost feel like it\nmade me softer\ngoing through this um\nand uh\nand i honestly think it was my religious\nbeliefs and my spirituality that pulled\nme through it and um turning to that\nrather than turning to anger and i\nremember actually one of the most\nbeautiful moments of my life was um\nas my we were as my sisters my mom and i\nit was my whole family were sitting\naround my dad's um hospital bed as we\nknew that it was his like\nlast moments you know we weren't sure\nwhen he was gonna go we weren't sure if\nhe could hear us or not\num but he had quite a long battle with\ncancer that was really hard to watch\nand so\nas he's laying in this bed not looking\nlike my dad anymore um we sat there and\nwe were just in silence like not knowing\nwhat to say and then one of my sisters\nwas like you know what let's tell\nstories about dad it's not like some of\nour favorite moments and we just sat\nthere and they started a little like um\ni remember one time and then before you\nknow it we were laughing and we were\ncrying and we're all holding hands as\nwe're telling these stories and\nin that moment this shift happened in me\nwhere i went from\nthis bitterness of like how could this\nhappen to my dad this smart strong like\nthe best man i know funny like\num he made me who i am\nand rather than being angry at what had\nhappened to him and at what i was losing\ni just became so grateful\nfor what i had\nwhich was like a lifetime of memories of\nthe most amazing father\nand the most amazing family that i still\nhad and then also that i will always\nstill have my dad because i believe he's\nwith me and he can help me now in ways\nthat he never could have when he was in\nhis mortal body like he can really\nbe there to comfort me at any time and\ni really think that that was one of the\nbiggest shifts that got me through this\nexperience was realizing to have\ngratitude for what i\nhave not only had what i have\num rather than the things we've lost\nbecause abundance\nand lack of abundance exist around all\nof us\nall the time whether you're the you know\nbillionaires of the world or whether you\nknow you live somewhere remote in a hut\nlike we all have abundance and we all\nhave lack of abundance and it's up to us\nto choose where we are going to look\nbecause at the end of the day we all\njust want joy we all just want happiness\nand um what else matters\nthen like sharing goodness sharing\ngratitude sharing love and giving\nyourself the the ability to have\nself-love and\nyou know forget all the labels and the\njudgment and the money and the like who\nwho is it that decided we're all\nsupposed to look a certain way who's it\nthat decided that money equals happiness\nbecause it doesn't you know who's at the\ndecided this success makes you better\nthan somebody else it doesn't like all\nthese things that sometimes trap our\nminds into feeling like we're supposed\nto be a certain way\nare their prisons you know and as soon\nas you can stop all those those voices\nand those opinions and just realize like\nwhat is it that i want to be i just want\nto be grateful i just want to love and\nthat was a huge shift that happened in\nme and it happened you know moments\nbefore my dad passed away and it's to\nthis day one of the most transformative\njust moments i've ever had\nthank you so much for sharing that by\nthe way it's it's\nit's so like\nheartwarming to hear you express\neverything through gratitude like you\ncan tell how much you've processed\neverything through gratitude even the\ntoughest moments of any one of our lives\nlike\nfor so you know for anyone who's lost\nsomeone in any way anyone who's\nlistening or watching right now\nyou know that it's not easy to do that\nbut the fact that you've been able to\nfuel\nevery situation in your life with\ngratitude is an amazing lesson for all\nus all for all of us like it's amazing\nit's really really beautiful and it's\nsuch a\nsuch a wonderful reminder for us all to\nfollow that example and all of our\ndifferent challenges and situations in\nlife and you're just saying there that\nyou know it's all about being joyful etc\nand like this new album that you've made\nartemis is obviously you say it's one of\nthe first albums that you've recorded\nfrom a place of joy\nyeah as opposed to recording it you know\nfrom a place of pain or challenge or\nstruggle\nthat as an artist i mean that almost\nsounds harder sometimes\nisn't it is it harder like well it's\nsometimes yeah yeah tell us about how\nthat was different yeah people always\nsay that you know artists make the best\nmusic through pain or the best like\nfilms through pain and i was like that's\nkind of horrible though\nwe have to experience pain in order to\nmake good art and but to be honest like\nyou know whenever i go to a like start a\nnew album or a new phase it's like okay\ni think where am i at what am i feeling\nand you know my brave enough album which\nwas the previous one was written about\nloss it was right after and like during\nlike all of this that i wrote that album\nand i drew from hard emotions\num and it was a good it was a good album\nhowever i think that\nthis album artemis\ni think it's my best album i've ever\ndone and it was really exciting when i\nlike went to think about okay where am i\nat what am i drawing from and i got\nthought\ni'm in a place of joy like this is\nawesome i get to write about like\nbeing in that place not just hoping to\nbe in that place and like the strive to\nget there but like i get to write about\nit and i called the album artemis\nbecause\num artemis is the goddess of the moon\nand i've really come to appreciate this\nwhole analogy of what the moon\nrepresents to me now that i mentioned it\nearlier just a briefly but that the moon\ngoes through phases sometimes it's\nbright and it lights up the whole night\nlike you can literally walk by the light\nof the moon other times it's covered in\nshadow and you can't even see it yeah\nand you know after\nmy best friend gavi died and my dad died\ni was in a little bit of a shadow for\nabout two years like i was in quite this\nlike\nyou know a little bit of a situational\ndepression and i had kind of accepted\nthat like you know what i think loss\nchanges you and i think this is the new\nme\nand i just need to get used to her and\nthat rose tinted glasses version of\nmyself that kind of magical person i\nthink she's gone\nand that yeah okay this is me and then\nafter about two years i just felt myself\ncome back it's like the eclipse was over\nand i was like oh my gosh it's not that\ni was gone i was just\ncovered up by a little bit of shadow\nand that's okay and that's why i was\nlike now think about like depression and\nall these things of like they're ju you\nknow or a hard weekend they're not who\nyou are they're passing phases whether\nit lasts two years because i lost the\nmost important people of my life or\nwhether it's you know just for some\nreason you're having a really hard time\num it doesn't matter they're not who you\nare and if you keep working on yourself\nand doing the things that you know help\nwhether it's dancing in your living room\nor whether it's going to therapy or\num writing your gratitude journal just\nlike doing those things if you keep\nworking on yourself and living with hope\nyou will find your full light again just\nlike the moon always returns to its full\nlight and that's what the this album\nartemis kind of was all about it was\nabout coming to full light and\nexpressing that and um and it was also\nreally fun because i wrote a comic book\nlike as a partner piece to the album and\ni'm actually still working on um i the\nfirst issue is out but i'm working it's\na six series comic but it was so fun to\nwrite like inspired by characters and\nthe theme and like you know this like\nstory that um i got to develop i think\nit's really important as an artist or is\nit just a person you know sometimes we\nfeel like we're running in a hamster\nwheel a little bit it's like okay i mean\ni like my hamster wheel and all but like\ni've done this like this was my fifth\nalbum\nso i was like how can i make my my\nhamster wheel feel slightly new you know\nyou know it's not like i had to just be\nlike i'm done with music and i'm trying\nsomething else it's like no i just need\na slight shift to make this feel fresh\nand for me that did it for me just\nhaving a story and a comic book and like\nwriting a music almost as if it's a\nscore for the comic book just made it\nall feel really fresh and\nfun yeah that sounds so innovative and i\nlove the analogy of the moon because for\nme it's like that's such a beautiful way\nof looking at life like you don't judge\nthe moon every day right you don't go oh\nno it's a half moon today like oh no\nit's covered today or like oh no it's\nfull today it's like you realize that it\ngoes through phases right and it's the\nsame with ourselves like we're gonna go\nthrough phases and you're gonna you're\ngonna be full of light one day and one\nday you're not and it's gonna come back\naround and it's okay and it's okay every\nphase is okay every phase is okay and\nevery phase is still beautiful and\nuseful and has a purpose i don't think\nit would be\npossible for the climate for the moon to\nshine the same every day like i don't i\ndon't actually think it would be\nscientifically possible\nfor that to be a good thing because of\nyeah yeah where it's got to shine and\nmovement when you look at how the design\nof the universe is so perfect that right\nif you if you took it out of alignment\nof the way it is actually it wouldn't be\nthat way right well so and as you were\nsaying like some of the\nshadowy moments of your life you know\nmetaphorically they're the ones that\ntaught you what you need to know they're\nthe ones that you that gave me empathy\nthey're the ones that made me really dig\nmy heels in and be like i'm gonna work\nreally hard so no one ever tells me i\nsound like a drowned rat again like you\nknow whatever those shadow moments are\nthey're important in your phases too um\nand they make you really appreciate like\nwhen you do get to fully shine you know\nand and also i just like that even when\nthe moon is half covered up it's still\nshining it's still shining it doesn't\ngive up just because it's you know\nhalfway covered yeah yeah and shines in\nthe areas that it can it shines wherever\nit can yeah and we can do the same thing\nand we can all bring light to darkness\nthat was another thing i love about the\nmoon the fact that it's so brave and it\nfaces the night whether it's a full moon\nand it's like i'm powerful or whether\nit's a sliver it still shows up to give\nall the light it can in the darkness\nyeah\nwow so much so many beautiful lessons\nfrom the moon i know i love the moon\nyeah it's spectacular yeah you've i'm\nnever going to look at a moon the same\nway ever again no me neither yeah yeah\nit's amazing so beautiful and i loved\nwhat you do my innovation i love that\nthat even though this is your fifth\nalbum it's not like oh now i've done\nmusic and i played a violin maybe i'm\ngonna go learn how to play another\ninstrument or maybe\nand now i'm gonna be a dancer or and and\nthere's nothing wrong if you did that\nthere's nothing wrong with any of that\nbut it's interesting to see how\nyou can innovate in your space yeah and\nactually your creativity comes to life\nand you innovated a virtual concert\nright like oh i did yeah tell us about\nthat that sounds like uh it was so crazy\nthey had me in this whole like suit with\nall these little sensors all over them\nit's like um and they created these um\nthese really cool worlds for me to\nperform in i was like a a lindsay avatar\nof myself so i got to actually design it\nto be like my little artemis character\nyou know that i that i made for the\ncomic book and i got to perform um\nonline as this avatar in this like\nfuturistic cool world with you know and\nit's fun because you know in a live show\ni can't be like let me spin through\npetals and have them like float around\nme and like let's have lightning go to\nthe beat of the music but like you know\nwhatever we wanted we could make it\nhappen cause it was a virtual world um\nand it was just really fun to have fans\nlive all over the world they're tuning\nin from you know whether it was like\nsome from russia some from south america\nyou know so i'm from l.a and i was just\nlike all over the place and you know\ngetting to have that moment together was\nreally just different and also it was\nreally funny because you know i've done\na lot of shows in my life now at this\npoint and doing a like an actual concert\nto like there was like hundreds of\nthousands of people watching but yet i'd\nfinish a song and it was just like six\npeople in a room with me that were like\nyou know so like that energy of a\nconcert i kept trying to remind myself\nlike oh yeah all those little i could\nsee the dots of the people that were in\nthere watching like those are all people\nthey're all here even though i can't see\nthem i can't they're clapping at home\nyeah they're they're hopefully clapping\nat home\njust what's my manager and some of the\nlike the engineers like\nyay\ni love it\nyeah that's i love i love the innovation\nof it i think that's awesome i yeah i'm\nexcited to see what you end up doing\nwith like virtual reality or augmented\nreality or like are you into all that\nkind of stuff it's it's fascinating it's\nreally interesting to me so i you know\nit is fun to think like what is the next\nstep for that like how can you know how\ncan music more be incorporated into that\nworld and yeah who knows yeah i think\nexperiences for audiences are just so\npowerful and technology allows us to\ntouch so many people that could never be\nin the room or can never travel\nyou know i've been thinking about this a\nlot lately about you know\njust dealing with this thought in my\nmind of like\nsocial media provides such an\nopportunity to connect across the world\nand do so much good it also as we know\nhas such a power to do like\nnot good\nand you know we find ourselves sometimes\ntrapped in these comparison like you\nknow situations or like you know feeling\nbad about ourselves because everybody's\nshowing their lives through filters and\nit seems real but it's not and i've\nreally been thinking a lot lately i'm\nlike am i a part of the problem social\nmedia or am i a part of the good and i\nthink the answer for me after thinking\nabout it more is like okay i think i do\nfeed some of the problem because i\nyou know i think i do some of the a lot\nof the good i try but i was like you\nknow what i'm sure\nmy fans look at my pictures that are\nlike from photo shoots or like my\npolished music videos when i like\ntook hours literally hours to get ready\nlike my hair my makeup body spray like\nyou know i like look good when i show up\non set you know your music video is\namazing thank you i love making my\nvideos and i'm like oh my gosh i'm sure\npeople compare themselves the same way i\ncompare myself to people's filters and\nthat's not to say art is art and you\nknow this is kind of the realization\ni've come to it's okay like i love\nmakeup i love playing with costumes and\nfun looks and expressing myself\nartistically in that however if i'm\ngonna do that\ni need to be okay with the other side i\nneed you know for me and so i've\nrealized i've made this new goal of\ntrying to just showcase\nsome unfiltered\nlife online and that's a little\nvulnerable for me because i don't have\nflawless skin i still get like how 33 i\nstill get breakouts like what everyone\nlied to me and said that was a teenager\nand it never got left behind but you\nknow just showcasing and realizing that\nlike yeah it's fun to get dressed up\nit's fun to do all that artistic stuff\nbut it's only fun if you're okay without\nit\ni think one of my favorite quotes is\nfrom cool runnings where the coach says\nyou know a gold medal is a wonderful\nthing but if you're not enough without\nit you'll never be enough with it\nand so i\ni love that movie yeah i love that movie\nand so i've really been\ntrying to make sure like if i'm gonna do\nall this other stuff i have to balance\nit like life has to be balanced and if\nbecause i also get used to seeing myself\nwith these filters whether it's like the\nfunny filter with bunny ears that makes\nyour skin flawless and like ah or\nwhether it's like looking at myself\nthrough the lens of a music video you\nknow i need to be okay\nlooking at myself in the mirror and\nsaying i'm just as beautiful without all\nof that and\nand it's funny because when i do post\nlike that you know my fans all say\nthat's what i'm the most beautiful and i\nneed to i need to believe that and also\ni just want them to see that like i have\nfrizzy crazy hair and acne and like all\nof that like so i've been thinking a lot\nabout that lately of trying to make sure\ni'm not a part of the problem of social\nmedia and i you know and it's\ni don't know it's been a really\ninteresting balance over the last like\ntwo months to try to like\ngauge for myself\npersonally and for my fans yeah no\nabsolutely and i i really respect that\ni think it takes a lot of\nbecause there's there's two sides here\nas well and and this is kind of like the\nbalance that you're saying is like we\nalso don't want people to play down\ntheir lives right so that we all settle\nfor less right you know what i mean it's\nlike you want to be creative and you\nwant to bring your art and you want to\ndo body and you want to look and it's\nnot like you're i think that's the point\nthat you're not saying oh i look\nbeautiful here and i don't look\nbeautiful here right that's what we\ndon't want but we also don't want people\nto just settle and not be extravagant\nand not play for that because there's\nart and beauty in that as well yes and\nand i almost feel like we don't want to\ncreate a culture\njust as we don't want to create a\nculture that just celebrates filters\nyeah we definitely don't we also don't\nwant to be a culture\nthat only accepts that only accepts and\nwhen i'm saying average i don't mean\nbeauty or how you look but it's like\ncreativity or passion or purpose totally\nright it's like that it's that balance\nand it's like you know i'm sure there's\nno right on scene i'll go too far and\nthey'll be like i went too far and then\ni'll go to you know it's it's probably\ngoing to be an ever flexing you know\nbalance but like i said it's like it's\njust as much for me\nas it is for anyone else it's like\nbecause i find myself comparing to other\npeople's filters and we all do so it's\nlike well\nthen i have to be really okay with\nmyself yeah without the filter so that i\ncan love being that person that is\nbehind the camera like because if i love\nwho's underneath all of that then it's\ngonna be all the more enjoyable to be\nlike dressed up with antlers on and in\nthis crazy dress and you know as long as\ni'm okay with without all of it yeah\nabsolutely yes just something i've been\nthinking about a lot yeah i know i love\nit yeah and i think\nwe need to work you know that's i think\nthat's going to be something we're all\ngoing to get right and wrong every day\nit's it's it's a process for all of\nyeah figuring it out like it's the same\nfor me it's like i want to give as much\ncontent to remind people of the work we\nneed to do right and at the same time\ngive enough content that also says\ncelebrate who you are and it's like\nright it's the both right because you\nneed to take a pause there are days\nwhere i'm like i just need to celebrate\nand you'd be really grateful for a man\nthey're like no i need to start working\nnow you know and you need both and it's\nnever right to just do either raw\nbecause if you just celebrate it all day\nyou just be complacent yeah and if you\njust work hard tough love with yourself\nevery day you get worn out that's the\nbiggest challenge of life is balance\nlike and i guess like kind of like you\nsaid it's just\nbeing able to listen to yourself and\nknow what you need\nwhat is it time to do is it time to like\nhit the pavement run or is it a\nself-care day where i just got to take\ncare of myself and say it's okay you're\ngood like\nyeah or is it a tough love day or it's\nlike get up and go i don't know it's\njust it's this ever fluxing like ever\nfiguring it out and that's so funny the\nway you put it of like do i tell people\nto like love themselves and use it like\ncelebrate or go yeah yeah yeah exactly\nexactly\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love if you're\nlistening to this and you're in an\nunhappy situation i get it i get how\nhard it is one of the things that can\nhelp is to say this demon\nwould come out with another person too"
