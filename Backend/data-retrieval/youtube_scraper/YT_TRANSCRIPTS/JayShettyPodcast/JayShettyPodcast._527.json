    "transcript": "the majority of the way that you talk to\nyourself is the way your parents talk to\nyou so if you don't first recognize that\nyou're gonna have a really hard time\nunderstanding how to get out of whatever\nyou're in now if you had great parents\nthat were super patient and loving and\nkind and empathetic and didn't you know\njump at you but held firm boundaries and\nyou know all that stuff there's chances\nchances are you have really good healthy\nself-talk and good on you me\nnot so much\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou that come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow\nnow i'm super grateful when we get to\nhave a guest on twice there's not been\nmany many people\nthat have done that on on purpose we're\ngreat at finding a diversity guest but\nthere are some people that just blow\nyour mind you love them i know that the\ncommunity responds incredibly well to\nthem and on top of all of that i love\nopportunity to get to sit down with them\nand talk about what they're up to what's\nbeen on their mind what they've been\nstudying reflecting thinking about now\ntoday's guest is someone who came on a\ncouple of years ago and blew our minds\nhis name and someone that you all know\nis called zachary levi one of the most\nversatile actors in hollywood with\ncritically acclaimed roles in tv film\nand on broadway zack's career catapulted\nas the lead and fan favorite chuck in\nthe hit nbc series and zach demonstrated\nhis range as a tony award nominee for\nbest actor in a musical and she loves me\nhis impressive vocals landed him a\nleading role in the disney academy award\nnominated best original song and the\nlist goes on and on i recently saw him\nin american underdog which i absolutely\nloved shazam was the reason he was on\nlast time but right now what zach's done\nis that he has created\nand written his first ever book and\ntoday we're gonna get to dive into it\nwe're gonna have it in the caption so\nyou can order it right away you're gonna\nfind it in the links i'm so excited to\ntalk to my dear friend an awesome human\nbeing about his new book radical\nlove\nlearning to accept yourself and others\nsomething we all need to do\nzach thank you so much for being on\npurpose it's so great to be with you so\nhappy to be back so happy to see your\nface even if it's virtually like i said\ni really i want to hug your neck and see\nin person but this will do for now yeah\nthank you man no i appreciate you man\nand i meant it like last time you came\non there was just this beautiful energy\nin the room i remember you were like\nsweating buckets as well\nwell it was warm\nyou the studio was pretty well that\nstudio was too it was our old studio\nwe're in studio\n3.0 now this is this is the new studio\nthat studio was not well ventilated\nzach was very passionate\ni didn't know how to stop him to offer\nhim anything because he was so\nin tune and aligned and i was like i\nguess we just have to like sweat\ntogether anyway for you to write a book\ni mean you could have written many\nthings you could have written in a full\nautobiography you could have written\nabout your experiences which you do of\ncourse in the book in a deep way\nbut you chose to write a book that isn't\nyour name that isn't you know how you\nview your career\nit's about life and you call it radical\nlove can you explain to me what radical\nlove\nlooks like is because i think love is\none of the most\nunderdefined\nmisunderstood words in the world already\nand radical love\nis taking us in a different direction\nradical love what does that mean in some\nways it's not a great title because i\nthink it's a little redundant i think\nthat love itself\nis radical when we are practicing actual\ntrue deep empathetic\nlove\nit is a radical concept in fact i think\nwhat most people would point to oh yeah\nit's like when i have warm feelings\nabout someone or have warm feelings\nabout myself i love myself if i have\nwarm feelings about myself or about\nother people we've all been kind of\nprogrammed with these very romanticized\nideas of love and marriage and\nrelationships i don't think that has\nanything really to do with the warm\nfuzzies i think that it is a recognition\nof the divinity the miracle\nthat is another human being\nregardless of who that human being is to\nlove who loves you is that's that's\npatty cake that's babies that's you know\nchild's play to love is to love those\nwho hate you that you even have these\nfeelings of disagreement or or anger\nwith or whatever to love your enemy to\npray for your persecutor that is love\nand that's the kind of love that's to me\nradical love again i say radical because\nit's radical compared to what most other\npeople's ideas of love is but really\nit's just love that's actually what love\nis it's being able to look at whoever is\nacross the aisle of a different\npolitical spectrum different sex race\nfaith country to country people group to\npeople group we are so divided i mean\nour the united states is a\nreally sad example of how much division\ni mean we're just straight down the\nmiddle on on almost every\nyou know hot topic we cannot look across\nthe aisle and say i completely disagree\nwith you i in fact i think that what\nyou're standing for\ncan be very problematic in this world\nand yet\ni still love you\ni still think that the reason why you\nthink the things that you think is not\nbecause you're evil it's not because\nyou're somehow this broken bad person\nit's because you are a product of your\nenvironment in the same way that i am a\nproduct of my environment in order to\nembrace and love myself i have to first\naccept that i\nam a product of the parenting that i\nreceived it's not my fault that i\nstruggle with the things that i struggle\nwith in order to forgive ourselves which\nwe all need to do we have to recognize\nthat we're doing the best that we can\nwith the tools that have been afforded\nto us at that point in our lives and\nthat is the reality that is the truth so\nuntil we can come to that place as\nindividuals with ourselves with other\nindividuals or you know just in our own\nlives and then collectively as a people\ngroup we're just going to keep fighting\nand fighting and going over this this\nhorrible vicious cycle all the way to\nthe bottom if we want a better future we\nneed to be working on more than just\nsaving the environment\nobviously we want to we want the world\nto survive but what good is a world to\nlive in if we all hate each other in\nthat future that is not a future that\nany of us want to be living in so\nthat to me is is kind of you know what\nradical love i think stands for it's rat\nto radically\naccept\nradically forgive\nand radically love\nwhomever is across the aisle and that is\ni understand a very difficult concept\nfor a lot of people to wrap their head\naround because we look at someone doing\na bad thing and our initial gut instinct\nis bad evil wrong monster we point the\nfingers and point the fingers and point\nthe fingers now\nare the actions that this person are\ndoing are those sometimes monstrous\nvillainous evil absolutely\nbut there's still a five-year-old child\nin them that came into this world and\nhad nothing but optimism nothing but\npotential nothing but openness nothing\nbut love and then the way that the world\nultimately mis you know misform\nmisfigured them in their heart in their\nmind in their psyche\nthat is what we have to be paying more\nattention to in recognizing and then\napplying an empathy to this person it is\nnot excusing the evil act it is instead\ntrying to apply love to those who are\ndoing the evil act because only then can\nwe redeem those people i mean and this\nis happening on a regular basis people\ngo to prisons all the time there are\ngroups of people that see murderers on\ndeath row and yet\nthey can still see the human being in\nthem they say listen i what you did was\nwrong and you're on death row because of\nwhat you did but i am not going to give\nup on you and the redemption of who you\ncan be in your soul because i see that\nx y or z i saw that you were raised in\nthis type of an environment you were\nabused as a child your father beat you\nand put cigarettes out on you you\nwatched your father or mother or cousin\nkill someone else you saw that as a sign\nof survival you didn't have enough money\nto buy food for your family so you\nstarted to steal and then in order to\nsteal you needed to protect yourself you\nthought and so you carried a gun and\nthen somebody tried to stop you from\nstealing and you went and shot them and\nnow you're a murderer now none of that\nexcuses the murder but all of it\nexplains why that murder ended up\nhappening and if we can do that and this\nis where i think christ was really\ntrying to get to the heart of it he's\nlike hey\nthere's none righteous not one there's\nnot one person on this planet that can\nactually stand above everyone else\nand cast the stones he is who is without\nsin cast the first stone everyone's like\ndropping the stuff\nthat's not me that's not you that's not\nanybody you know and yes we could\nprobably sit here and hash up like well\nwhat's a more egregious sin\nbut they're all sin at the end of the\nday they're all things that we're all\nfalling short\nof treating each other as the divine\nmiracle that we are and and people ask\nme what about people who don't believe\nin a spiritual plane or god or whatever\nyou know how do you explain to them that\nthey're a miracle\nvery easily\nwe are a mathematical improbability this\nplanet that it even exists that we are a\nperfect distance away from the sun so\nthat we don't freeze and we don't boil\nthat we have a moon that is the perfect\ndistance away from us that allows all of\nour literally the systems like gravity\nto even you know the the tides to go in\nand out and that we have been as human\nbeings we've been searching\nthe universe ever since we had the\ncapability we have been searching the\nuniverse trying to find life anywhere\nelse and we can't find it and we haven't\nfound it now even if there is other life\nin the universe we're still a miracle\nthat this place exists it's still a\nmathematical miracle so even if you\ndon't believe in god even if you have no\nspiritual proclivity or you know\nwhatever you can still count yourself as\na miracle and if we can do that and we\ncan start seeing each other as miracles\nand we can see that every blade of a\ngrass every squirrel every dog every\ntree every everything anything that\npossesses actual life\nwe can create everything else we can\nmake more computers we can make more\nphones we can make more whatever we need\nto make and yes we can also create more\nlife we do that on a regular basis but\neach one of those lives is unique\nevery single one of us comes with a\nuniqueness that uh you know making\nanother audi doesn't necessarily come\nwith a uniqueness you know we are a\nmiracle that is what i'm trying to\ndrive to people and this well one of the\nthings i'm trying to drive the people on\nthe book because i really think that if\nwe can wrap our heads around that if we\ncan change our perspective and we can\nstart seeing each other even the evil\nyou know even the bad even the monsters\neven all these people and say okay yes\nthey are doing bad but they started they\nthey were\ninitially they had all of the promise\nand let's have a little empathy with\nthat let's have a little grace let's\nhave a little more patience let's hold\nthem accountable and i think that's one\nof the big disconnects that people have\nthey're afraid that if we\nstart to give people even a little bit\nof grace well now we're condoning their\nbehavior no no you can you can love and\nnot like\nthat's that's another thing i try to get\nto in the book loving\nis not just this warm feeling it's not\njust\nlike\ntimes a hundred\nlike is to like to love is to just\naccept the divinity except the miracle\nthat is across from you anyway that\nthere's a rant for you that is there is\nso much to unpack the first thing\nwas this difference\nin responsibility and fault and when it\ncomes to accepting ourselves\ni think the reason why we\nstruggle to accept ourselves is because\nwe think that means i have to think it's\nmy fault and when it becomes my fault\nnow i become depressed by that idea it's\ndisempowering it brings me down whereas\nas zach said when you actually go well\nit's not my fault but it is my\nresponsibility that's empowering it\ngives you a sense of choice and\ndirection and design like you said\nour choices today are impacted by the\ndecisions that were made for us when we\ncouldn't make choices or when we didn't\nhave the choice and so that's the part\nthat's not our fault but now\nas we get wiser and older and more\nmature and more experienced we now can\ntake that responsibility so i thought\nthat was a a really clear concept the\nsecond thing that i wanted to unpack\nfrom what you said which is really\nspecial was the difference between\nexcluding\nand explaining\nso you were talking about how\nsomeone's actions don't exclude them\nfor what's coming for them but really we\nneed to seek the explanation we need to\nunderstand how they got there it's the\nthe context the complexity it's\nit's one of the reasons why i really\nappreciate it it's the why it's the why\nit's the why it's it's one of the\nreasons why i appreciated uh the movie\nthe joker\nbecause to me looking at a very\nfictional character of course\nbut you start to recognize that even\nthis villain that we have hated or\ndisliked for so many years\nhas a backstory and often we tell our\nheroes backstories and origin stories\nbut we don't tell the villains\nbackstories or origin stories and and\nthere's a lot to be gained from that\nbecause yes nothing is excluded everyone\nshould be held accountable\npeople should not be allowed to get away\nwith things but we might be able to\nreduce this happening in the future\nif we were to learn how these people are\nmade and talking about your audi example\nit actually does align because if you\nand i got an audi on the same day and it\nwas the same model but you treated yours\nbadly and i treated mine well\nin 10 years time you're going to see the\nexact same difference and that\nuniqueness is going to be made by how\nit's treated so\ni just wanted to unpack that for\neveryone because i think you shared such\na breadth of insight there and and i\njust wanted to pick at a few of those\nthings so i love that you brought up the\njoker because\nthat movie i was so\ngrateful that it was made because it to\nme was one of the most important movies\ni had ever seen that dealt with mental\nhealth i was like how\nit took a a dc and you know i love that\nit's dc too because that's my family but\nyou know it took dc making this movie\nabout this villain to really highlight\nthe\nincredibly powerful effects of trauma\nlike real\nhorrible trauma and what that does to a\nhuman being there's that saying every\nvillain is the hero of their own story\nright or everyone is the hero of their\nown story including villains and one of\nthe coolest things about being an actor\nis that it's very much based on empathy\nyou know the whole idea is that you are\nlooking at something that is outside of\nyou a character\na person and you're trying to understand\nthem so that you can bring them to life\nin an honest way now if you're playing a\nquote-unquote bad guy well guess what\nbad guys don't think they're bad guys\nbad guys\nthink that they're doing the right thing\nwhatever that is now it might be super\ntwisted it might it might come from all\nthe wrong places but their logic has\nbrought them to there because of\nwhatever traumas they've experienced\nprior to that there are not a lot of\npeople doing bad in the world\nthat are sitting around twisting their\nproverbial mustache and being like\ni can't wait to do these bad things no\nit's very hard for us to wrap our head\naround but that is the truth in order to\nunderstand why people are doing what\nthey're doing which is what we like\nyou're saying we have to get to the\nbottom of it it does not excuse\nit explains excusing explaining and to\nexplain builds empathy it helps us to\nunderstand why people do what they do\nand therefore helps us to hopefully\ncondition them away from doing those\nthings if we can find them early enough\ninstead of you know let's say you meet\nsomebody and you know that they're about\nto or thinking about doing this horrible\nthing now the knee-jerk reaction is oh\nmy god they're a monster i can't believe\nit i got no no no as opposed to oh\nyou are hurting inside let's sit down\nlet me be a conduit of love in your life\nso that you don't feel the necessity to\ngo do these you know what if people saw\nthat and said oh man you know what i\nthink this guy\nmight be very close to going and doing\nsomething really bad and why oh because\nwell look how he's treated at school\nlook how he's treated at home look how\nhe's treated online they're constantly\nonline and they're finding themselves\nrejected even by strangers on the\ninternet they go on instagram and\nthey're constantly comparing themselves\nto the beautiful perfect lives of\neveryone there\ncomparison is not just the thief of joy\ncomparison is literally destroying\npeople's mental health we have got to be\nable to\nget in there hopefully early before the\nbad things happen but then\nafterwards also we have got to be\nwilling\nto\nallow\nourselves to be angry to be frustrated\nto be sad to be all of the things but\nthen still not allow ourselves to be the\ndehumanizer the more we dehumanize all\nthose that are struggling in doing bad\nthings in the world the more we\ndehumanize ourselves\nwe are all\ncut from the same miraculous cloth some\nof us are just\nin conditioning that makes them\nvery troubled and doing very horrible\nthings but again\nthere are people that go to prisons now\nthat are going and seeing the human\nbeing even in the murderer and saying i\nrefuse to believe that you are a monster\ninstead i will hold you accountable we\nwill all hold you accountable because\nthat was not what you should have done\nbut i will still try to do my best to\nsee the human in you because before you\nleave this earth\nyou should feel that you should know\nthat and i think that if we do that we\ninfuse that kind of love\nthere'll be less and less and less and\nless and less of this that we ever need\nto deal with because people will\nultimately be more healed and more whole\nand that's why i think that if we can\nget to everyone there\nto if we could heal every head every\nevery every heart and every mind in this\nworld all of our other problems go away\nthese are the source of all of the rest\nof the issues of all the murder of all\nthe rape of all the uh theft of all the\nwars of all of the greed the amount of\ngreed that is killing this world right\nnow all of the ceos and and leaders of\nindustry that all value profit over\npeople that all value money over what\nthat money is ultimately doing to this\nworld to the planet to the animals and\nthe the the life in it and and we all\njust kind of\nrationalize it we all say yeah but you\nknow i mean everybody needs to make\nmoney so i guess i don't know\nno\nthose people the reason why we all do\nthis is because we are all still afraid\nthat if we don't have enough we are not\nenough\nand that is one of the greatest lies and\nthe ceos that get to the tops of these\ncompanies though we can get to them\ninstead of\nwhat so many people want to do which is\ndehumanize and vilify them and say\nyou're the one percent and you don't\ncare maybe maybe all that is somewhat\ntrue on some level but guess what\nthey're still also a child of god they\nare also still a divine miraculous life\nand i guarantee that if we want to\nactually help them to change their ways\npointing fingers and yelling at them is\nnot the way to do it if we want to\nactually change their hearts we've gotta\nwe've gotta lead with love we've gotta\ngo to the jeff bezos's of the world and\nthis is hard because i really have big\nproblems with people like you know like\nit's like dude you have all the money in\nthe world why where's all the altruism\nwhy can't we give back like you can't\ntake it with you you know one of my\nfavorite quotes you don't see a u-haul\nin the back of a hearse your grave is it\nthat's all you know now\nsome of these people i think they think\nwell about i'll be remembered as one of\nthe richest people in the world no you\nwon't not not 100 years from now not 200\nyears not a thousand years from now\nthere are emperors that were ruling over\nmassive empires that had that commanded\nmillions and millions of lives that\ncould literally kill a person in front\nof god and everyone and do it scot-free\nnothing would happen to them at all do\nyou know all of their names because i\ndon't\ni don't know all of these people nobody\ndoes they're all forgotten they're all\nforgotten in the annals of history very\nfew of them ever get written down and if\nthey are written down it's a little\nfootnote it's like oh yeah and that\nperson existed but nothing of really any\nvalue they're not looked at as like oh\nthese are the great people of the world\nthey're not if they're even remembered\nat all so if we can get to the old you\nknow the ultra wealthy of the world\nthese leaders of industry and say hey\nhey hey listen there's nothing wrong\nwith going and taking care of yourself\nyou and yours and making money fine go\ndo it but don't do it at the expense of\nother people's lives don't do it at the\nexpense of your entire workforce don't\ndo it at the expense of the environment\ndon't do it at the expense of this\nmiracle of a world that we have but we\ncan't do that to hate we can't hate our\nway to a better future we can only love\nour way there that is the bottom line\nand so and that and it takes this\nradical love\nwe struggle as human beings\nto\nallow two things to exist at one time\nso the idea as you said is you can love\nsomeone but not like what they do that's\nallowing two\nopposite separate ideas to exist at the\nsame time or the idea that i disagree\nwith this person\nbut\ni have to connect with them and\ncommunicate with them in a way\nthat will help them shift and i may have\nto be more patient it may take longer\nbut guess what if it takes me longer it\nwill probably last longer as well i if\nyou shout at someone they may change\ntheir behavior right now but they'll go\nback to doing what they were doing a few\nmoments later just like you do with the\nchild like if you shout at a child and\nit may stop playing the video game or\nwhatever it is because it's scared but\nthen a few moments later it still wants\nto play the video game whereas if a\nchild is engaged with and connected with\nand communicated with and\neducated in what may be a better use of\nits time it it just starts to transform\nand that requires love and it requires\nempathy and it requires patience\nand i think because we've never received\nthat ourselves we find it so hard\nto go out there and give it to others i\nmean in the first section of your book\nthe first chapter you call it stop\nrunning\nwhen when we bring this back because\nwe've talked a lot about like the most\nbig extreme global macro issues of how\nthis\nidea\ncascades across the world\nbut when we look at it as you said at\nthe start like it starts from us and so\nwhat do you think zach what are we\nrunning from\nand what are we running towards or are\nwe just running nowhere you know in my\ncase and i think this is the case\nprobably for a lot of people but in my\ncase it was running from the pain and i\ndidn't even know it i mean that's you\nknow that's that's part of the tricky\nthing about this you know like\nyou can give somebody advice\nthat absolutely applies to their life\nbut if they don't recognize that they're\ndoing that thing they think no i'm good\ni mean for so long in my life i had been\ngiven certain pieces of advice like\nmaybe do this or maybe do that but in my\nmind i was i was cool i was like\ni get that for somebody else but for me\ni'm i'm okay\ni didn't realize\nuntil i had this massive breakdown\nthat\ni had been running away from\nso much of what i had been\ntrying to survive and i do think that's\npretty applicable to most people you\nknow as a child\nyour ego is essential it is your\nsurvival\nsuit it is your it is your life raft it\nit is the thing that protects you from\nall of the trauma that you experience i\nmean it's a thing that you know\nparticularly like not particularly but\nusing again an extreme example there are\npeople that are able to disassociate\nfrom themselves when they are sexually\nabused as children because how else is a\nchild supposed to process that so many\nof these cases the ego steps in the ego\nis there to protect the psyche and it\nsays you're not here right now you're\ngood you're not here right now you're\nsomewhere else this isn't really you and\nthen that child learns how to now\ndisassociate well that was great for\nthem but that becomes a massive problem\nlater on in life if you don't ultimately\nheal from that if you don't learn that\nthat's what you're doing and heal from\nit so the ego\nultimately\nis this incredible gift\nbut that becomes an incredible hindrance\nit becomes an incredible\nweight on us you know in the in the book\ni talk about it's almost like this\nexoskeleton or this you know uh suit of\narmor it's this incredible thing you're\nwalking around and people are swinging\nclubs and things at you and it's the\narmor's taking all the hits but the\narmor is getting dented and chinked and\ncut up and you know so you end up\nwalking around by the time you're 35\nyears old if you're still depending on\nthis suit of armor you don't realize how\nmalformed you are you think you're\nwalking smooth and straight but you're\nreally with a limp and you're doing this\nall because you're stuck in this\ncontorted armor and that armor is only\nsupposed to service up to that point and\nthen you know\nwe can argue or argue a debate about you\nknow\nsome people you know they like to use\nwording like you know death to the ego\nor kill the ego and other people are\nlike no befriend the ego or whatever\nthat is however you want to word it i\nthink at the end of the day is something\nthat we all need to\nrealize as a beautiful necessity in our\nlives as we are children particularly\nand then eventually\nit does not serve us\nin a the positive way that it once did\nand ultimately being grateful for it but\nallowing it to not be the armor that we\nneed anymore because we are doing the\nwork on healing ourselves and\nenlightening ourselves so that when\nthings do come at us we're able to evade\nwe're able to you know judo them by us\nwe're not just hitting they're not\nhitting us anymore because we're more\nnow more mature in our thought process\nand in our feelings i was constantly\nrunning because i was constantly trying\nto survive as a child i didn't realize\njust how traumatic it was to me you know\nlike if you're growing up in chaos you\njust kind of assume that's normal that\nyou the standard is what it is if you\ndon't grow up in chaos you assume that's\nnormal now i thought when i would go to\nnormal you know friends homes and things\ni just assumed well people are putting\non heirs or they're putting on\nappearances but when i'm not here it\ngets crazy like it gets crazy at my\nhouse\nnot realizing that i was really in a\nmassive massive survival mode i mean my\nsympathetic nervous system even to this\nday i mean it's something that i have to\nwork on very constantly because we want\nto be in our parasympathetic we want to\nbe in a relaxed rest and digest in a\nmode most of the time we don't want to\nbe in this again incredible gift that\nour bodies were given which is the\nsympathetic which is to\nsurvive which is to run away from the\nsaber-tooth tiger which is to not be\nkilled by a trampling uh elephant or or\nyou know go running and going and\nrunning after an antelope to go hunt it\nand bring it back to your account these\nare all things that we are\nour bodies evolutionarily have these\nbeautiful amazing gifts but they're\nconstantly activated now almost more\nthan ever because survival is no longer\nrunning away from the beast or chasing\nthe thing to hunt or getting out of you\nknow the elements we all have a roof not\nall of us but a lot of the world\nmore than ever before in human history\nhave some kind of a roof over their head\nsome kind of clothes on their back some\nkind of food in their stomach and\nsurvival has now become money because\nmoney can pay for all of those things\nand so our pursuit all of our collective\npursuit for more of this is keeping us\nall engaged in this\nsurvival mode and i was running from\nall of that trying to survive and then\nrunning two\nwhere do i find my worth where do i find\nmy identity where do i find these other\nthings that ultimately give me this\npurpose and this worth and how do i\nsurvive now in this other world so\nthat's where i ran from and that's where\ni ran too and ultimately all of that is\nreally unhealthy because you need to be\nable to just sit with yourself and\nrecognize that\nnothing gives you worth or value outside\nof the fact that you are\nthat you are\nhere the fact that you are alive\nmeans that you are a miracle if that\nalone if we could get people to the\npoint of recognizing that holy crap that\nshould be enough hopefully to be able to\nsay i love myself i'm i can't believe\nwhat uh what a lucky thing that i got\ni'm here i'm i'm in this existence that\nwill hopefully help us to stop running\nfrom things and sit\nand be present i think the challenge i\nsee that people have as you address in\nthis book and that's why i i really\nappreciate what you've done with this\nbook like\nzach talks about like how to get help\nhow to be open\nhow to share your story right like the\nbook is a systematic approach in the\njourney that that we're talking about in\nthis very\nmacro way today because\nthe book lays out the steps that you\nhave to take so if anyone's listening to\nus right now and going like that's what\ni want to do that's what i want to\nfigure out the book actually walks you\nthrough\nthat journey\nand zach i want to ask you this question\nbecause i feel like that journey\nas you said at the beginning to radical\nlove\noften feels so far away\nbecause\nwe haven't been trained that way we\nhaven't experienced that we didn't\nsee that we didn't have access to that\ngrowing up\nwhat's the first step if radical love is\nthe step\nwhat's the first step\nin that journey that people could take\ntoday tomorrow\nthis year in their life\nthat makes them feel like they're on\nthat journey because what we both also\nknow is that if you try and\nimitate radical love or if you try and\npretend to practice radical love that\ncan actually be\ndetrimental to yourself and others\nbecause it's just it's not real right so\ni want to hear about that from you\ninauthentic anything\nis the opposite of the thing so if we're\ntrying to put on love if it's not\nauthentic it's not love\nparticularly love there's a lot there\nare actually some other things that you\ncould do\na proxy version of that you can maybe\nyou're not totally screwing things up\nbut if you are\nif you think you're providing love if\nyou're loving you think you're you're\nloving yourself\ni mean like my like my own journey i\nthought i was loving myself but that was\ninauthentic love because i was still\nberating myself i unbeknownst to me i\nwas still all my self-talk was\nthe same self-talk though it was the\nsame talk that i got from my parents my\nparents the majority of the way that you\ntalk to yourself is the way your parents\ntalk to you so if you don't first\nrecognize that you're gonna have a\nreally hard time understanding how to\nget out of whatever you're in now if you\nhad great parents that were super\npatient and loving and kind and\nempathetic and didn't you know jump at\nyou but held firm boundaries and you\nknow all that stuff there's chances\nchances are you have really good healthy\nself-talk and good on you me\nnot so much i had i didn't i didn't know\nthat\nand then i figured it out and i still\nwork on it but it's a thing that you\nknow now that i'm aware of the traps\nthat i fall into now i'm able to go oh\noh zach you're doing it again you're\ndoing that thing and you know\nthis is how you end up winding yourself\nback down so but going back to your\nquestion\nwhat is the first step the first step\nhas got to be\nrecognizing that you have a problem\nright like that is\nthat's the age old that's the adage you\nknow the first step in fixing a problem\nis is recognizing that you have a\nproblem\nnow that can be very difficult for\npeople you can't force people to do that\nthat's got to be something that comes\nbecause\nthey recognize the necessity now in my\ncase i had a complete mental breakdown\nand so i knew i don't know what else to\ndo clearly i have a problem if i don't\nwant to live anymore so i have got to go\ntry and figure that out now\nthat was step one step two now by the\nway\nnot everybody has to come to that dire\nof a conclusion hopefully nobody does\nhopefully we're able to recognize these\nthings far earlier in life\nbeyond that the step is you got to talk\nyou got to talk about it you got to\nstart with a\none of your closest friends or closest\nfriends start with your family if\nthey're the closest to you\nget some of it out say i am struggling i\ndon't know what i'm struggling with i'm\nembarrassed whatever guess what there's\nno reason to be embarrassed there's no\nreason to be scared because everybody\neveryone without fail there is not one\nperson on this earth that hasn't dealt\nwith even the best parented people still\ndeal with some form of stress anxiety\ndepression you name it there is\nsomething there so everyone can relate\nto this ultimately we're all afraid it's\ngetting better which is great it's\ngetting less stigmatized as the more we\ndo things like this and talk about it\nbut everyone still has these\nreservations and fears because nobody\nwants to feel like they're broken nobody\nwants to feel like everybody else is\ngood but i'm somehow struggling and i\ndon't know and we all feel like we're\nuniquely broken we feel like well\nclearly no one has felt the way that i\nfeel no one has gone through this exact\nthing and i am here to say that is also\na lie because the world is really really\nold and there have been billions and\nbillions of people who have lived on\nthis earth and even if they lived in a\ncompletely different time guess what\nthey have still struggled with the exact\nsame problems slightly different details\nexact same problems so\ntalking about it getting it out you have\ngot to acknowledge that there's a\nproblem talk about that but immediately\nas soon as you can go to a professional\ndon't don't\nhave your friends and family don't allow\nthem to be\nthis uh kind of end-all of where you get\nyour advice and your wisdom because as\ntry as they might they all have bias\nthey all have agenda even buys an agenda\nthat they're unaware of not even biased\nand generally like well i'm going to\ntake advantage of this like hey i have a\ncertain idea of who i think you are\nought to be so i'm going to give you\nadvice when it comes to directing you in\nthat way whereas a disinterested\nunbiased unagended third party i mean i\nguess the only bias or agenda they would\nhave a professional therapist is that\nthey get paid to do it so i suppose you\ncould say that but\noutside of that i mean and they should\nbecause it's a service it's a job and by\nthe way it's one of the most valuable so\nit's so worth the money although i do\nthink all of that needs to be worked out\ntoo that really i'm hoping that we can\nkeep pushing toward getting mental\nhealth services and information and\neducation to people\non much more reduced rates if not\nentirely free i wish that there were\nclinton clinics that people could just\nwalk into right off the street and be\nlike hey i'm struggling i need to talk\nto somebody i need somebody to just kind\nof like help click this this back into\nreality what a beautiful world that will\nbe but until that day\nvery worth whatever uh you know the\nmoney um i believe an investment in\nyourself so that's the first step i\nreally truly believe you got it you got\nto acknowledge it you got to talk about\nit and then within that now you have\nsomeone who is guiding you to\nthe various other steps because the\nother steps though some of them are kind\nof universal some of them are not not\nevery not every uh person\nneeds to do x and not every person needs\nto do y and even the people that need to\ndo both don't necessarily have to do\nthem or should do them in that order you\nknow it all depends on what your\nparticular\npersonal\njourney has been in your life with your\ntraumas how they came about how they're\nmanifesting in your life right now how\nyou happen to be struggling or not\nstruggling with them or don't think\nyou're struggling with them you know all\nof that can really you know with a\nlicensed professional somebody who\nreally understands these things who have\nstudied this stuff\nthey can guide you through the rest but\nso that that's what i would tell anybody\nout there\ndo\nyourself the service and the favor go\nlove yourself first and foremost by\ninvesting in a therapist and being able\nto talk about and just get out what it\nis you need to talk about i love that\nzach i mean\ni'm sure everyone can hear your passion\nyour\ndrive the amount of like and it was the\nsame last time like even last time i\nremember there was this one clip we had\nand you just went\nempathy empathy empathy empathy empathy\nempathy and you said empathy like 30\ntimes and even today i've heard you say\nradical love you know it's the message\nyou're asking us to do\nis\nhard but necessary it's challenging\nbut\nreal it's\npushing us because that's the only way\nwe get to our truest selves and and you\ncan see that in you that it's a it's a\nplea like you're almost plea pleading\nwith us to say please do this you know\nit's not even it's not a direction it's\nnot preaching it's not pushing it's\npleading\nand i just want to say thank you to you\nfor your energy for the time to put this\nbook together for\njust just your ability to speak the\ntruth so emphatically and\nyou know with so much with so much not\nconfidence that's that's actually an\nunderstatement but but with depth right\nthere's there's a real depth behind\nthese thoughts and i i appreciate you\nman i really do because it's it's so\nmuch harder to talk about the things\nthat you're choosing to talk about\nthan than the software version of a lot\nof these ideas so i appreciate you i'm\ngrateful for you\ni'm recommending to everyone please\nplease please go and grab a copy of the\nbook radical love learning to accept\nyourself and others like i said today\nzach's taking us on a journey of really\nunderstanding the concepts and ideas as\nthese big principles but the book really\ngoes into his journey his story the\nexperiences he went to to be on the\nbrink of that position of breaking down\nand falling apart and then guides you\nthrough this step to step journey\nwhether it's overcoming your ego whether\nit's loving yourself so please do go and\ngrab a copy of radical love uh zach i'm\ngrateful i can't wait to catch up with\nyou hang out with you i i
