    "transcript": "be around people that you're thinking\nabout being with in an environment where\nthey're just being themselves because\nchances are if you like them the way\nthey are when they are with other people\nthen you're likely to love them when\nthey're with you too how did we meet\nokay so how did we meet do you want to\ntell the story no you do it no it's okay\nyou can tell better okay i'll tell you\nokay\nokay so\nwe the first time i actually met raleigh\nwas\nbefore i became a monk\nand i met her very briefly i thought she\nwas beautiful and\nand and attractive but i didn't really\nthink anything of it like i just\ni genuinely just was so focused on what\ni was doing at life at that time and\ni was so spiritually inclined\nand spiritually focused that i i\nliterally didn't think anything of it\nyeah and my mom introduced me to you\nyes so i should tell that story yeah so\nactually i met rodney's mom even before\ni met her yeah and so i was\ntraining\nto become a monk and i met radi's mom\nand i was asked to show her how to do a\nparticular\nservice at the temple so i had to take\nher around et cetera now the incredible\nthing about this is that that is the\nonly time\nwhile i was there that i was ever asked\nto show another person how to do this\nservice so the one day that i had to\nshow someone how to do this particular\nservice this voluntary service at the\ntemple it was the one day that her mom\nturned up and at that time i didn't know\nshe had a daughter i didn't know\nanything about this lady i was like oh\nshe's around my mom's age yeah and and\nshe was she was wonderful and and we got\nalong but i was just showing her what to\ndo and then literally didn't speak to\nher no and then my mom wanted me to get\nmore involved in and i really wanted to\nget more involved in\nlike the spiritual side of my life and\nso she met him and wanted me to\nget introduced to the youth community\nthere and so she passed on my number to\nyou but you passed on to your sister\nyeah absolutely yes i passed it on to my\nsister i was like no i need to stay\nfocused do my thing and my sister's very\nspiritually inclined too big shout out\nto amy\nand\nand then yeah and then you guys got\nconnected and you became friends yeah\nand actually at that point my mom had\nsaid to me oh you know i met this really\nnice\nreally nice guy at the temple and she\nwas like to me after i met him i prayed\nand i was like i hope my daughter meets\nsomebody like this i know he's gonna be\na monk but i hope she meets someone\nthat's like this because he seems really\nnice\num little did he know what was gonna\nhappen\ngone\nand then um and then what happened\nhe became a monk\ni heard you speak oh i heard him speak\nall the time because he used to do\nlots of um youth programs or university\ntalks and sessions on philosophy\nmeditation yeah philosophy meditation\nand i was just like oh my gosh he's such\nan incredible speaker and the way that\nhe uh makes such incredible wisdom so\nrelevant to us who were like young\nteenagers or\nyeah yeah not young you weren't a\nteenager i was a teenager i was still a\nteenager no you weren't lazy\none thing you're going to realize about\nthis\ni'm the one who remembers all the dates\ni'm like i'm the one who remembers it\nyeah i don't remember anything i barely\nremember things happened like two years\nago um so no i wasn't a teenager i was\nout of university\nwhich feels like a long time ago so i\nwas in my 20s and yeah i saw him\nspeaking i just thought it was so\nincredible how he was able to articulate\nsuch yeah such deep wisdom in a way that\nwas so relevant to\npeople who were so young and and\nprobably wouldn't have been so\ninterested in reading a book about it\nand so i was in awe of him and he also\nlooked really cool he had like a bold\nhead he didn't look like the type of\nperson who was going to be speaking\nabout these things he had like tattoos\nand a bald head but then he was in robes\nand i said this is really really cool\nbut weird at the same time\nit was so strange yeah\nand and then it was then when i left\nbeing a monk\nwhich is our story in itself we can talk\nabout that another day when i when i\nleft being a monk her and my sister were\nreally really close yeah and me and my\nsister are really really close i trust\nmy sister she's one of my best friends\nand\ni sat down with her one day and she said\nwell you know what bradley likes someone\nand and i was just like oh who and i was\nthinking she was gonna say some other\nperson's name and she's like she really\nlikes you\nand i was like oh i i really like her\nlike i'd love to get to know her better\nand we we'd interacted we'd had we'd got\nto know each other a bit better because\nwe'd organize charity events together\netc and so i'd seen her\nnot in\nthe role of being a girlfriend obviously\nor someone that i was dating i'd seen\nher interact with other people\nother other humans\ninside a project management organization\norganizing events so i'd seen her\npersonality and like observed how she\nbehaved around certain people how she\nhad talked to people how she interacted\nwith people and and based on all those\nthings i thought she was a great person\nso\nwhen my sister told me that i was i was\nsecretly quite happy as well and i\nalways heard about him through his\nsister and his sister would talk about\nhim with so much love and affection and\nhe treats her like\nshe's his baby no matter how old she\ngets she's literally like his baby and i\nused to see like conversations between\nthem he's like oh my gosh he's so sweet\nlike he's so sweet even though he's yeah\nhe's gone off being a monk but he was\nstill really really caring and loving\ntowards towards his sister and his\nfamily\nand then yeah i told her that i liked\nhim before\nbefore uh he knew about it or before\nyou'd probably even thought about it\nyeah yeah yeah so then that was it\nreally that's how we met we\nalmost met before i became a monk\nwhen you had conversations yeah never\nhad conversations never spoke but\nbut i just seen each other in our own\nelements yeah and then when i left left\nbeing a monk uh\nyou know\nlater that year we we started going out\nso that was around the towards the end\nof 2013 and then it just went really\nfast we both we both kind of as soon as\nwe spoke about it we both knew that we\nwanted to be with each other and we were\nreally certain about it and\nit could have gone really wrong but we\nwere like we could have both been really\ncrazy um but it ended up just working\nout we both really had kind of\nunderstood each other just by observing\none another i guess and um there were a\nfew surprises i'm sure but um we yeah we\ngot along straight away and we were both\npretty much went from yeah i really like\nyou too yeah i love you in like a day\nand then it was like yeah we want to get\nmarried in like a week um as in we\ndidn't get married in a week but we\nwanted to we said we wanted to get\nmarried eventually in a week after that\num\nand then we ended up spending a lot of\ntime at each other's homes right\num he was spending a lot of time at my\nhouse for ages i mean that's pretty much\nwhere i took him to have all of our\ndates because i loved being around my\nfamily and i was like best of both\nworlds i can be around the person that i\nwant to spend the rest of my life with\nand the people that i've spent most of\nmy life with\nand so yeah most of our dates would\nwould involve my parents\num and my sister and my brother-in-law\nat the time and so we got to know each\nother kind of in our own environments as\nwell really fast which i think helped\nus fast forward a lot easier yeah\nabsolutely and i remember that my sister\ngave me like an action plan she's like\nthis is what you're going to get along\non this is what you're going to struggle\nwith and this is going to be your\nchallenges and and and i definitely owe\nit to her to bring us together yeah\nshe was us being together my sister\ndefinitely and and she was like because\nshe knows me so well and i feel she got\nto know you well as well she was just\nlike this is what you guys are going to\nagree on this is what you're not going\nto agree on this you know it was just it\nwas so nice to have that yeah because\nyou could go into a relationship having\nmore understanding of the other person\ncan i just say one of the things she\nsaid that we wouldn't get along on is\nbollywood because i loved bollywood\nsongs and films at the time but you like\na good bollywood song questionable\nyeah questionable right now i decided to\nget over there yeah\nand you you've barely eaten yeah yeah\nyeah you've got to go\nhave a love for it yeah but yeah we\nspent a lot of time in each other's\nparents homes and with our families\nwhich was great because you had to be\nyourself i used to love what your mom\nused to tell you my mom was so funny so\nobviously like it was a person to her\nthat was you know we were dating and so\nusually you would put in a lot of effort\nin the way that you dress and uh doing\nyour hair when the person you're dating\ncomes over\nbut um yeah i would literally be in the\nsame clothes that i was wearing like the\nwhole day which was pretty much like\npajama bottoms and and a really scruffy\ntop and my mum would be like do you not\nwant to maybe you know put a different\ntop on or you don't want to change your\ntrousers i was like no mom if he can't\nlove me in what i'm wearing right now\nwhich is what he's probably going to see\nme for the rest of his life then it's\njust not meant to be okay like he has to\nlove me for and she would okay but you\ncould try you know a little bit i was\nlike no and it worked so\nyeah\nand she's so beautiful and cute like\neven when she's dressed all hobo chic\ni'm just like i love it you know and and\nit's quite nice actually like i i\ngenuinely believe this like i\nrarely see her with makeup on yes and so\nit's it's fun when you when you fall in\nlove with someone based on who they are\nand their personality and their energy\nand all of that beauty shines through so\nyeah i love you so that leads us nicely\non to the next point that our friends\nwanted to discuss which is what's the\nkey to starting off a relationship well\nwhat's the key like what's the key to\nstarting it off well so one thing for me\nwas\nwas this that because we didn't see each\nother in\ndating environments yeah a lot\ni feel like dating environments put this\npressure of being in an interview so i\ncompared dates to interviews it's almost\nlike you have to put your best foot\nforward you wear your best clothes you\ntry and say all the best things and even\nif it's not the best actually it's us\ntrying to be right and that's what we do\nin interviews when you go an interview\nfor a job it's like you want to be the\nright fit for that person yeah and\nthat's what happens in a dating scenario\nlike you're sitting opposite desk just\nlike you're doing an interview\nand then someone's asking you a question\nand you're like okay well what do i have\nto say to make them like me or to say\nthe right thing whereas we didn't really\nget to do that no and i'm not saying\nthat that was a conscious choice but now\nwhen i look back at it and i reflect on\nit and introspect on it i'm like we\ndidn't really get an opportunity\nto date\nin that sense and that means that i got\nexposed to the real her\neither by seeing her in a charity\norganization seeing her in a real life\nscenario how does she treat normal\npeople\nand then how she's with her family and\ni'm like that's the best view you can\nget of someone and so when i look at\nthat in terms of giving advice or tips\nor whatever\nmy recommendation is\nbe around people that you're thinking\nabout being with in an environment where\nthey're just being themselves yeah\nbecause chances are if you like them the\nway they are when they are with other\npeople\nthen you're likely to love them when\nthey're with you too and so often we\nonly see people\nthat we are considering being romantic\nwith or dating etc we only see them in\ndates and dinners and movie nights and\nwhatever it is right mm-hmm yeah i agree\ni feel like you think and also seeing\npeople with the people that they're\nclosest to because you can't really fake\nit with the people that you're closest\nto i mean if you can you could do it for\na really short period of time and you\nalso end up seeing them\nbeing probably at their worst and at\ntheir best because you can be the most\nloving to your family but you can also\nbe the worst person towards your family\nbecause they're the ones that accept it\nand so yeah i feel like you get a good\nimage of who the person is through\nthrough interacting with them that way\nabsolutely yeah good point thanks nicely\nsaid\nit's true yeah and\nand the other thing is\ni so when we first got together i'd left\nbeing a monk probably like seven months\nbefore so it'd been like a seven month\ngap\nand i didn't have a job\noh yeah i had no job i had no money no i\nwas getting rejected left right and\ncenter from every single place that i\nwas applying to because i'd been a monk\nfor three years and no one wanted to\nhire someone who had monk written on\ntheir resume like no one's like oh yeah\ni would love your transferable skills\nlike you know like what do you know and\nso oh you can meditate for four hours\ngreat we need that in our organization\nso it was just there was no\ni had nothing really yeah and\nthat's a great way to start dating\nsomeone because there's very i remember\ni used to save up so i used to like try\nand work part-time\nand i was doing everything i could you\nwere tutoring i was tutoring so i would\nlike i would be tutoring young people\nfor their exams or university exams et\ncetera and i'd be making like you know\n15 pounds an hour or whatever it was and\ni remember i'd save up so i could take\nher out on a date at the end of the\nmonth and so that we could do something\nfun\nand and i loved the fact i loved that\nbecause i met her at a time when when i\nhad nothing and she accepted me for it\nyeah i love her for that and also\nher parents were always really cool\nabout it so sometimes that can be a big\npressure from parents and expectations\nbut her parents were really cool about\nit they never made me feel uncomfortable\nabout it or anything and my parents\nobviously were very comfortable with me\nthey were just like follow your heart do\nwhat's right for you very very\nencouraging and i'm not i don't come\nfrom a well of background at all or\nanything so it's not that i had a backup\nplan but my parents were still very very\nencouraging and supportive\nyeah i i that was never uh in my mind to\nbe honest i was i knew i wanted to be\nwith you and so i was like to my mom\neven if we end up living in a really\ntiny house just by like near the temple\nthat i used to go to and just i know\nthat i want to spend my life with him so\nwhatever ends up being and you were\nreally really\nenthusiastic and you had so much purpose\nand even from the beginning like you\nwere so driven to do whatever you wanted\nto do i didn't know what that was at the\ntime um but you were so driven that i\njust knew whatever it was whatever we\nwere meant to be was what was gonna\nhappen and so and i knew you would never\nyou're always like gonna be there to\ntake care of me and i felt that from the\nbeginning like i always felt supported\nyou wanna hold hands yeah i'm not good\nat pda so i'm gonna not do that oh my\ngod\num yeah so that was\nit was it was really nice and i feel\nlike he had a lot of the qualities that\ni always felt\ni would always grow up saying oh i\nreally want a husband that was like my\ndad like i love my dad and he was always\nsomeone that i felt very protected and\nsupported by and so i just definitely\nnow looking back at it i felt those\nqualities in him as i got to know him\nand so i thought yeah that was that was\nnice and my parents yeah my parents my\nparents didn't carry that i always\nthought it would be you know you always\nthink in indian families that's going to\nbe an issue\nbut they loved him from the start he's\ngot really good i don't know if you guys\nhave noticed but he's got a really good\nway of saying things and and winning\npeople over by his words so it's real\nthough i know that's why it's genuine\nand it's sweet so from those\ninteractions i think my parents trusted\nhim very easily as well um yeah i really\nget along with your parents i know yeah\nand it was so great for me because amy\nwas already like my sister and me and\nyour mom got along straight away because\nwe bonded over food and so yeah it was\nreally easy for us both to to join into\neach family\nbut yeah another thing i think that's\nreally important at the start of a\nrelationship\nis\nself-awareness and setting expectations\nso i feel that having done the work as a\nmonk and having been through that\nexperience myself i'd gained so much\nself-awareness so i was really aware of\nwhat type of partner i needed in my life\ni was really aware of what i needed in\nmy life to flourish to thrive and so\nwhen i met someone it was very easy for\nme\nit was very easy and simple for me to\ncommunicate my expectations to her and\nbe like\ni i remember one of the things i said\nand this is not offensive at all it's\ngenuinely how i felt at the time and i\nsaid that if you want a husband who goes\nto ikea on the weekends and and to the\ncinema like i'm not that guy and i\ndidn't mean that as a bad thing if\nanyone is that what i meant that as is i\nwant to be someone who lives their lives\nof purpose and i want my life to be\nabout service and i want my life to have\nan impact on people's lives and i need a\npartner that's going to\nunderstand that embrace that and roll\nwith that as well and wants to live not\na normal life because that wasn't going\nto work for me if i really wanted to\nhave an impact if i really wanted to\nmake a difference if i really wanted to\nserve and so that wasn't an ego thing it\nwasn't me thinking i'm better or above\nor special it was me saying this is a\npriority for me\nand i don't need it to be your priority\nbut i need you to understand it to be\nmine and i think this is really\nimportant that we should feel that if\nwe're genuinely committed to something\nwhen you make someone aware and same\nback from her side too like when she and\nshe'll share hers but when she's made me\naware of what her priorities are and\nwhat's important to her you start\nrespecting what's important to the other\nperson rather than expecting them to\ntrade theirs right and that's usually\nwhat happens in relationships in the\nbeginning is instead of showing respect\nfor the other people's passion you\nexpect them to change their passion for\nyours or compromise and be excited about\nyour stuff and and i don't think that\nthat's the right way i think it's us\nbeing clear about ourselves\ncommunicating that and then respecting\nwhat the other person communicates yeah\ni think we discussed that really early\non actually yeah and just to be clear he\nhas come to ikea with me on the weekends\nand movies yeah\num but you know i understood the point\nof it and i remember at that time when\nhe was really pushing for what he wanted\nto do\num he was very very busy and so there\nwere certain things i mean he spent a\nlot of time with me and my family but we\nhad just agreed that look if there was\nextended things that i had to go to\nbecause with families there's always\nother things that you have to go to like\nfamily friends or relatives houses for\nevery event possible and if that\nhappened\nthen i knew that i was okay with him not\ncoming to them and i said that to him\nfrom the beginning\nif you need to go and do something which\nis i know for you more important not\nbecause for the purpose that you want to\nlive then i totally understand that\ncomes above you just coming to another\nparty which people are not probably\ngoing to remember like it's okay um and\ni think that was really actually really\nimportant for us because you can always\nhear what other people say like family\nmembers or friends or whatever will\nalways have a different opinion and so\nas long as you feel like you have um\ndiscussed it and you really understand\nthat person's point of view then you\ndon't feel kind of it doesn't rub off on\nyou when people say things because you\nunderstand it deeply whereas if you\ndon't then i think it's really easy to\nget swayed by other people's view of\nlife or other people's way of\nrelationships or whatever it is like you\ncan get that can rub off on you very\neasily but if you really understand that\nperson and why they're doing it i think\nthat can make a big difference to you\nsupporting them in why then why they're\ndoing it thank you oh my god this is\nthis holding hands thing\nweird and we had to you know realize\nand i really appreciated that from her\nlike i i really valued that\nbecause it wasn't about seeing something\nas less it was about seeing something as\na priority for me yeah and\nand having someone who understood that\nand trusted me and and allow me to have\nthat space strengthened us and we also\nvery quickly became our\nwe became a team yeah so when it came to\nour families or like demands and for\nanyone who's from an asian family or an\nindian family knows that it's a big deal\nit's a big deal like family is a big\ndeal and he gets very involved in a\nrelationship and i remember saying to\nher really early on i was like it's me\nand you like we're a team like it's us\nand and we have to think like that\nbecause we've got to wake up next to\neach other every single day of our lives\nwe've got to go to sleep together with\neach other every day of our lives we've\ngot to be in each other's face and space\nevery single day each other live so it's\nit's us we have to be a team and and\nthen very quickly like i found that when\nit was anything to do with my family or\nmy commitments etc then i would have her\nback and whenever she was anywhere and\nit was about me she would have my back\nand that built like a really strong bond\nearly on yeah i completely agree and\neven if we wanted to discuss it between\nus and we had a different opinion to the\nother person at least to the like people\nthat we were speaking to if we had each\nother's back the other person felt\nsupported and and comforted by that\nwhereas i feel if you're\nyeah it's just so hard to fight that\nbattle between between the person that\nyou love and like the people that you\nyou've spent your whole life with um but\ni think when you know you're going to\nwhen you understand the reason behind it\ni just yeah i keep coming back to that\nbut i really think it makes such a\ndifference yeah i remember\nearlier on in our relationship when we\nwere talking about spending time with\neach other's family or even each other\nyou said something to me which has stuck\nwith me for a really long time until now\num no it was really good he was saying\nhow\nyou know we can spend so much quantity\nof time with people and it can be spent\ndoing so many different things you're\nwith each other but you're actually\ndoing like okay you're watching a film\nor you're um on your phones or you're\nspending the whole day together but how\nmuch are you actually interacting with\neach other and so i really loved that he\nwould always choose quality time over\nnecessarily over like quantity so even\nif he's spending a short amount of time\nwith me or my family or my friends he\nwould always make sure he's got like\nthey've got his full attention like he\nwould really make them feel and he\ngenuinely felt that way that he was\ninvesting his full self into that moment\nand i think that made make such a\ndifference and i never understood that\nat the time because it was always like\nyou know when you're spending time with\nfamily it's just family time\nbut it really made me think about how i\nspend time with people rather than the\namount of time i spend time with people\nand as i've seen you do that while we've\nbeen together i just think i've noticed\nhow much people appreciate your full\nattention and how deeply you connected\nthem even in such a short space of time\nwhereas i've been like the type person\nwho can spend an hour with someone and\nmy mind can be somewhere else and it's\nit's a training though is it's a\ntraining thing definitely and i've\nlearned that from you but it's an\nincredible quality to have to be able to\ninvest your full self into a\nconversation or a person and that's why\nlike he it's actually really annoying\nbut he remembers everything like he\nremembers everybody's name everything i\nsaid like five weeks ago\neverything i was wearing like it's an\namazing quality but it can also be very\nannoying because i don't have that\nmemory so he's like no you said this\nlike three weeks ago it's like no i\ndidn't but i don't have like a book that\ni write things down in so i have to take\nhis word for it but yeah five hours a\nday guys five five almonds yes as my mom\nwould tell me but no i\nthank you i really appreciate it yeah i\nremember that from quality and you know\nshe'd always make an effort\nand this is where it comes to using your\nskills and talents like she'd always\nmake an effort to like cook amazing\nstuff for my family i remember when you\nmade my sister a minion cake oh yeah for\nher birthday that took me a day and a\nhalf and it was so weird\nand i love minions too so it was it was\nso cute and and my mom still remembers\nthe first talk you ever made when i\nfirst came over\nand it's just it's those things so\nyou know using your talents using your\nskills\nand and people appreciate that even more\nthan like taking a week or taking time\nlike you're saying like quantity but the\nquality of a thought yeah right even\nwhen people say like it's the thought\nthat counts it's not it's the quality of\nthe thought that\nlike that's that's where we make an\nimpact in people's lives third topic\nthat our friends want us to discuss is\nlove languages\nand realizing and recognizing our own\nlove languages and the love languages of\nsomeone else so if you don't know what\nthe love languages are it's a great book\nby gary chapman i've made lots of videos\non it so there are five love languages\nand the five love languages are quality\ntime\ntouch\nwords of affirmation\nacts of service and gifts so all of us\nhave multiple love languages but we have\na priority a hierarchy order and we both\nmostly value one or two as our top love\nlanguages and everyone has them so you\ncan think about yours as well this was\nan interesting lesson for me in\nrelationship it took a while for us to\nget there yeah definitely took a while\nit did and we got it really wrong yeah\nfor a long time like it was yeah it was\ndefinitely been a journey for sure\nbecause you always end up trying to give\nthe person what you want\nlike it's it's such a natural thing\noh sorry\ni forgot it's your show\nyeah no no i'm just saying that it's so\ni'm just thinking about it back because\ni'm thinking about all the things i got\nwrong um but it's so easy to always want\nto give other people what you love\nreceiving or what you love doing um for\nthat person like and i feel like your\nlove languages can be different in what\nyou like giving to other people\nand what you like receiving from other\npeople\nlike i love cooking for people and i\nreally appreciate a good meal but i\nwouldn't necessarily say that that's my\nway of showing love it's not necessarily\nmy way that i feel love given to me um\nand yeah i think it took a lot of trial\nand error yeah it was a serious\nexperiment going on for a couple of\nyears yeah and she and she's holding\nback right now but literally\nis hilarious like she's she's the\nfunniest person i know she makes me\nlaugh the most i'm very nervous right\nnow and when i yeah and she's getting\ninto it she's getting into it you just\nneed to go find some stories on\ninstagram but when i\nwhen\ni first met her and when you see her\nyou're like oh she's an elegant oh yeah\nhe's an elegant graceful\nyoung woman and and i was just like and\ni was just like okay so maybe she likes\nlike like grand gestures and elegant\nposh places like that's what i thought\nand this just shows us how a the media\nmakes us assume what people like\nor we based on how someone appears we\nassume what they like and so that's what\ni did i got it completely wrong and i\nremember organizing our first date we\nwent to watch a theater show which was\nactually really fun\nand then we went to this restaurant that\ni booked and this restaurant's called la\ncanda located which he must have like\ntuted for about a month to afford that\none-day date literally yeah it was\nexpensive and this restaurant is like\nhighly in demand like\ndavid beckham goes there and it's it's\none of these you know very posh very\ngrand restaurant i thought that's what i\nneeded to do\nand i was totally wrong like we sat\nthere she looked so uninterested in this\nthing and i had to wear heels and i\ndidn't wear heels like literally it was\nlike i was in a dress i wouldn't\nnormally wear because i thought that's\nwhat he wanted so i was literally like a\ndress that like a really girly dress\nwhich i wouldn't normally wear and heels\nwhich i normally wouldn't wear um and so\nwe were both sitting in this restaurant\nand i was really hungry at the end of it\nand i said to him at the end i was like\nlook even if you just take me on a walk\nin a really good supermarket or what do\nthey call it here grocery store\ngrocery store supermarket i was like\nthat is like the most epic date you\ncould take me on get me a few treats\nfrom like the from the shelves we'll go\ndown the gluten-free vegan aisle that\nwould be the best day and so after that\ni think you kind of started\nunderstanding i think i still got it\nwrong yeah yeah yeah yeah\nand this is my point like we all get\nstuff wrong because of previous\nexperiences the media what we think like\nall that kind of stuff and i just kept i\ngot it wrong for a while because i just\nkept thinking and then i was like okay\nshe liked food okay let's then\ni had a moment where he's like oh she\nlikes food so then all i did was buy her\ncards with food puns and food which i\nreally liked and then we only went to\nlike food places for all our dates i was\nstarting to get closer you did you took\nme on a date where we went cooking at\nlike a jamie oliver thing yeah that was\nreally that was fun yeah that was a good\nday yeah you did good you did good yeah\num but yeah it did take a lot and even\nwhen i was and he's a gifts person yeah\nso i'm gifts and words of affirmation\nand i think i'm definitely words of\naffirmation and\nquality time maybe yeah quality time\ndo you like it yeah do you like quality\ntime i think that they might yes um and\nyeah what was i saying you were saying\nyou like gifts yeah so i i'm like i'm\nnot so much of a gift person i don't\nthink i ever really have been um even\nlike on my birthdays and stuff like all\ni really remember growing up is my dad\nwould just take a day off and spend that\ntime with me and i used to just love\nthat aspect of it rather than the gifts\ni do like gifts but they're just not my\nmain thing um\nand\nso i was trying to buy a gift for you\nand he wanted like an ipad type thing no\ni wanted to know you weren't here\ni thought you wanted an ipad type thing\nand so i was like looking at you i\nwanted a tablet i thought you wanted a\ntablet and so i was literally looking\naround for the best spec and like really\nreally good like details of whatever was\ngood and also good pricing because\nobviously like a good bargain is is you\nneed that if you're into driving oh yeah\nif you're driving you need a good\nbargain and so i was looking around and\ni found this amazing asus tablet what is\nasus an asus is a good brand to\neverybody and so i thought look this\nlooks like a really good one let me buy\nit got it packed it up gave it to him i\nhave never seen disappointment like so\nbad in my life from opening a gift\nbecause when he says he wants an like a\ntablet he wanted an ipad um and so i\nlearned that he likes really like good\nquality\nexpensive gifts\nwhich i probably still haven't got no\nnow we're just telling you guys\nbut last year\nshe organized the most incredible\nsurprise birthday pie so i've loved\nsurprises and this is\nanother thing about our childhood etc\ni've loved surprises since i was a kid\nyeah because my mom would always\nsurprise me on my birthday and so i'd\nreally encourage you to reflect on where\nyour preferences and priorities and\nthings that you love get like where does\nthat come from so for me\nmy love for surprises in life and in\neverything comes from my mom surprising\nme on my birthday\nand\ni've never as you grow up surprises\nbecome harder and harder to do for\npeople\nand last year she organized the most\nepic birthday surprise ever so it\nhappened two months after my birthday so\ni was not expecting at all she told me\nshe was like cooking and catering for a\nfriend's event so she was cooking this\nwhole week like working so hard on all\nof this stuff and i was just like how\nimportant is this friend because she was\ngoing through extreme lengths and i was\nlike wow like she's really dedicated to\nthis friend and that was cool like i\nappreciated it i was like i love seeing\nher in an element and loving cooking for\nsomeone that she loves and that was\nbeautiful\nand then i think i'm going to an event\nwith my manager\nand my team the same night so i'm like\noh sorry i won't be able to make it to\nyour event etc like i've got this you've\ngot that have fun like i hope it goes\nreally really well and then i turn up i\nopen the door to this event it's like\nall of my friends from la like everyone\nthat i love\neveryone that really loves and believes\nin me like they were all there everyone\nshowed up she made sure that literally\nevery single person that i care about\nwas that there was like a stalker\ngirlfriend looking through his phone at\neveryone that he mentioned\nlet me find that person's number let me\nget that person's email address yeah and\nliterally it was just it was\ngenuinely after my wedding after that\nthe best thing that's ever happened to\nme like it was that good it was just\namazing like it was the most beautiful\nevent it was really hard really\nmeaningful we had an illusionist i love\nmagicians and illusionists yeah you do i\nhad an incredible show an incredible dj\nplaying violin to some of my favorite\nsongs all my favorite people were there\nfrom from la specifically because it was\nin la\nand i just i was just so\nblown away like genuinely i was like\nspeechless for the first time in my life\nbecause she'd\ncompletely outdone any expectation i\ncould have ever had which was the\nhardest thing ever for me because it was\nthe first time i wanted to show him that\ni really understood his love language um\nand also like the effort that goes that\nthat you go through to make something\nlike that happen one i had no idea until\ni actually started going through it and\nusually i would get to a point where i\nwould find like an obstacle and i'd be\nlike you know what it's just i'll just\ntake him somewhere instead like forget\nit i don't need to do this but he puts\nin a lot of thought into a lot of the\ndates that he plans and so i really\nreally wanted to show him that i like\nthat i really understand it and like\nthat i've observed things about him and\ni really notice what he loves and and uh\nappreciates and so\nit was the hardest thing i've ever had\nto do in my life like it was so hard\nplan i'm not a planner i'm not good at\norganizing i'm i'm just it's not not my\nlike i wouldn't say it's my top three\nskills let's just say that but\num i was just so happy that i did it\nbecause and it was genuinely like the\nlove that i have for him is the only\nthing that got me through it because\notherwise i would have\njust basically never called me for party\nplanning never\ni'm not i'm so blessed to have her in my\nlife because and she cooked for everyone\ntoo so i did yeah for everyone she\norganized the event there were like 80\npeople there it was amazing and and i'm\nso grateful to you for doing that i\nliterally was the best i'm glad you\nliked it could have ever thank god\nbecause imagine you hated it no i loved\nit i loved it it was amazing and and\nyeah it was just it was incredible and\nit just shows like\nwe've been together now for nearly six\nyears yeah and\nit takes time to learn about each other\nit takes time to grow each other but the\npoint is are you waking up enthusiastic\nand energetic every day to fall in love\nwith that person again like that's the\nquestion you have to ask yourself like\nare you\nlooking for more reasons to get that\nperson to\nchange for you or are you looking for\nmore reasons to be like no i want us to\nfall more in love i want us to learn\nabout each other i want to give more to\nyou every day i want to be better for\nyou every day or are you looking for how\nthat person can be better for you and if\nit's the other way around then most\nlikely that relationship's not going to\nlast too long or it's going to be very\none way but if it's like how can i be\nbetter for that person every single day\nand it may take time and it has taken us\ntime yeah to completely understand each\nother more etc and we've been through a\nlot i want to get to that as well\nbut\nthat you know it takes time and it's\nokay as long as you're waking up every\nday with that intention with that motive\nor that desire yeah i definitely think\nit's about what you feel you're bringing\nto the other person rather than what you\nfeel you can get from the other person i\nthink that makes such a difference\nbecause when both people do that yeah\nwhen both people do that when you feel\nlike okay well this is what i can\nprovide like and\ni love what you say about everyone\nhaving different skills because even in\na relationship i think\ni have so we are very different in a lot\nof ways in majority of the ways we're\nvery different i always say we're\ntotally different yeah and so\ninstead of seeing that as things that\nare taking us apart from each other i\nthink we really tried to say okay cool i\nlove being in the kitchen for example um\nand you're really good at doing all the\nmath stuff to do with bills and i really\ndon't want to do that and so instead of\ntrying to be like oh no we should be\nequal in like you know doing this and\ndoing that no let's just play to our\nstrands and i think that made a huge\ndifference because i didn't feel\npressured to do things which i really\ndon't feel comfortable doing if i had to\ndo them i would have but\nthankfully we both kind of\nare good at areas which the other person\nis maybe not so good at yeah and so um\nwe just played to our strengths and and\nwe weren't annoyed at the other person\nfor not being able to do those things we\njust understood that we have skills in\ndifferent areas and we can contribute to\nthe relationship with those skills\nrather than trying to be like\nall-rounders in all areas which doesn't\nwork for us and and the key to that i\nlove that and the key to that is\nvaluing what the other person brings as\nequal as equal yeah right so it's like\nit's not saying oh if your skill is\ndifferent to mine but my skill\ndoes this like my skill fulfills this or\nmy skill\nuh sorts this out like that's more\nimportant and i think that's where it\ngets hard where we either try and\nequalize our skills which i agree with\nyou is not a good idea to play your\nstrengths or the opposite thing people\ndo is they do their skill but then they\nthink their skill adds more value to the\nrelationship and i think that again just\nruins it like it's like you're on a team\nlike when you look at a sports team\none player can't say i'm more important\nthan the rest of the team it's a team\ngame and i'm going to try and do a food\nanalogy now yeah i'm trying to give a\nfood analysis\nno like let's get me out hear me out\nthere you go okay like one ingredient\ncan't be like to the other ingredient\ni'm more important than you yes yeah\nyeah that's good yeah yeah because you\nneed all of that unless you're salt\nno but still but yeah okay yeah i'll\ngive you that you can't have one\ningredient that's more important than\nthe other ingredient and yes yeah i\ntotally agree no i agree you did great\nthat was a great food analogy\num but i remember this actually because\nwhen we i've been a housewife for a\nwhile like i i i\nstayed work from home and i'm studying\nand stuff so\ni remember working from home i work from\nhome but i still i as in yeah i'm more\nof a housewife than i am working um\nand so and i love that i love doing i\nlove cooking and i love doing all the\nthings that i do do\nbut when we were in new york i remember\nhe was working\nat that time for huffington post so he\nwas out most of the day and he would\njust come back in the evening and\nhe would come back and i would have just\nfinished cooking and he would always be\nlike oh like can i do anything for you\ncan i wash up like you've been working\nhard all day and that for me was such a\nbig thing because it's like actually in\nmy mind it's like he's been working hard\nall day but he would come home and ask\nme if i needed a massage or if i wanted\num him to wash up or do anything in the\nhouse and\nlike a lot of people think that that\nshould just be a given like oh like yeah\ni've been doing the house stuff all day\nso come home and you should be washing\nthe dishes but i just think actually if\nyou see us that's such a sweet thing for\nhim to have done in my eyes because he\ncould not do that we could all just not\ndo a lot of things but if we put in that\nextra bit of effort and show that person\nthat i value you and what you're doing\njust as much as i value what i'm doing\nlike people\nyou know going to work seems like you're\ngoing out and doing the hard work but\nyou also saw that i was doing the\nwashing or the cleaning or the cooking\nand you valued it in the same way as\ngoing to work and i thought that was a\nreally yeah that was a that was a big\nthing for me and he's been like that the\nwhole time so i think it's the same i\nthink for me as well like she was\nso good at doing that like she would put\nour heart into it right it wasn't just\ndoing it and i think that's the point\nhere it's it's not about doing the\nactivity it's about putting your heart\ninto it like it would always be like oh\nlet me it was the like the other day i\nwas just like we just got back from\nindia and when i'm in india i eat doses\na lot dosas are incredible if you know\nwhat they if you don't know they are go\nget a dose yes and i love them and i was\nliterally just like i was like i missed\ndoses every day every morning\ni know she ordered a dosa maker and we\nhad doses it went terribly wrong\neveryone terribly wrong but still i\nloved it like it was it was it was the\nlove in it and i think that's the same\nyou know she believes in uh cooking with\ndevotion and seasoning with love\nand for me she lives that every single\nday like that's there's not a day when i\ndon't feel like\nfood is an offering of love so then you\ncan't help but value it like it's not\nyou don't have to it's not hard it's not\nhard to value it that's what i'm trying\nto say thanks but yeah\nthis is getting a bit sweet isn't it i\nknow why don't you change it up yeah\ni'm leaving it to you to make it funny\nsee i'm the romantic in the room yeah\nshe's the comedy this is always the case\nlike my his card's to me this is a\nrom-com yes\nyeah whose cards to me are like the\nsweetest really genuine from the heart\nand my cards are like funny weird poems\nthat are like i really like your face\nyou don't know how to make cake like\nliterally those are those what my cards\nwere like i don't think i think\nmaybe one out of 15 cards were maybe\nsomewhat like sweet and loving but\notherwise yeah i've always been\nthe jokester and you generally are the\nsweet ones you are yeah you are there's\na\ni'm gonna live up to my live up to my\nromantic tag in this relationship\ni always say this to her because i mean\nit and it's uh\ni don't know who said it but it's it's\nbeautiful and it said that\nthey said\noh no\ni know what he's gonna say\neverybody cue the key the romantic music\nand the tissues and the tissues i found\nanybody needs cheese\nif you\nthey said if you want her to fall in\nlove with you you have to make a laugh\nbut now every time she laughs i'm the\none who falls in love and i'm pretty\nsure that's from a grime artist\nin london in some sort of a rap song\nit's great though i mean\nit is a really i really like it topic\nnumber four what's your favorite thing\nto do together so our friends wanted us\nto discuss this is easy what's our\nfavorite thing to do together eat\nno sorry that's my favorite yeah\num what's our favorite thing to do\ntogether i had an easy answer for this\nsong oh okay i like um what do we like\nwhat do we like to do together mine was\nactivities and experiences oh i thought\nit was like a specific one no like\nactivities yeah we love doing that like\nescape rooms and we went to a virtual\nreality escape from the other day\nwe went on a hike\noh thanks um\nuh we go on hikes and we just love doing\nexperiences you're right experiences and\nactivities yes we do try and do like\nwe've gone through the thing of where we\ntry and go shopping together\nor movies and stuff but we generally\nfind we have a lot more fun\nwhen we're doing activities where we're\ncontributing to something together like\none of the first dates we went on was go\nape and so for anyone who doesn't know\nwhat go ape is go ape is like a\nassault course but in the air\nso you're like swinging around it's like\ntarzan kind of stuff and and we loved it\nbecause it was just like it was active\nwe're both doing stuff together helping\neach other out we love escape rooms even\nthough there are times i think we've\nevolved yeah like the first time i went\non an escape to an escape room with him\ni was like we are never doing this again\nbecause i'm so relaxed that i'm just\nlike oh you know if we win it's fine if\nwe don't win it's the like you know it's\nwe participated and that's what counts\nand he's like come on we have to do this\nget over there um i'm not angry you're\nnot angry but you're like very\nenthusiastic and so i'm sitting on the\nchair like we're going to be escaping a\nprison and i'm just sitting there with\nlike a hammer in my hand and he's like\nlooking around everywhere trying to\nsearch for it he's like why are you not\nhelping and then the trap door opens\nbecause she like bites yeah and i get it\nright anyway just by being chilled out\nnow i've realized trust her\nso we did that recently and i trusted\nhim and it was good and i actually got\nquite you did well yeah you did well we\nenjoyed it we did that\nactivities and experiences getting\noutdoors\ndoing stuff together\nsolving puzzles something that engages\nus in talking discussing\ndoing achieving something together is a\ngreat yeah\nachieving something together when you\nwhen we went to that cooking class for\nexample like we cooked a meal together\nlike that was fun and then we ate it\nwhen you when you create together yeah\nit's such a special experience yeah\nthat's so true and i think that more of\nus should find time with our other\nhearts so even people who are dating or\ngetting to know\nto to create together you just learn\nmore about the person it's so much\nquicker so much easier we've also\nstarted spending a lot of time because\nof how our schedules work sometimes we\nend up just spending time together where\nwe're just catching up and talking which\nactually is quite nice because we didn't\nused to do that and i think that used to\nget us to a point where we felt like we\nmaybe didn't know each other as well as\nwe wanted to or understand each other as\nwell as we wanted to but now we we do\ntake out time to just yeah like catch up\nand and ask the other person about\nwhat's going on me more so than him he\nused to do this anyway\nbut i now i'm asking a lot more\nquestions and i we really try to invest\nour interest into the other person which\nis great yeah and we love meditating\ntogether and we love going to get vegan\ndonuts together so yes that's true so\ni'm going to go to medicine\nbut literally when we met i used to\nteach her philosophy and meditation and\ni say this all the time she's now a\nbetter meditator than me she's more\nserious she's more focused she's more\nsincere she's more devoted it's amazing\nlike being able to have that in my life\nis so powerful and that i put above\nanyone bringing in conscious spiritual\nintention and energy into a relationship\nthat's above someone bringing money\nthat's above someone bringing anything\nelse like that's just the most powerful\nthing that you can bring into a\nrelationship because it's it's helping\nyou eternally it's helping you for the\nrest of your life and\ni think it's undervalued of how much\nbringing positive beautiful spiritual\nenergy is into a relationship and you've\nbeen doing that since day one in our\nrelationship like she literally for the\nfirst i think first few years we were\ndating she was like waking up at 4am and\ngoing to meditate with the monks every\nmorning right like with with the\ncommunity and and she did that like\nwhile she was working a job while she\nwas planning our wedding while she was\nworking at the hospital etc and all the\nrest of it and so i feel that you've\nprioritized\nyour spiritual practices\nso highly and i love you for that and\nit's made such a difference in our\nrelationship and for me it's like what\ncan i do to let you keep having that\nlike what can i do to keep letting you\nbe that light in our life because\nthat's something that\nyou can't buy like you can't you can't\nbuy that anywhere you can't just make\nthat happen anywhere and and i value\nthat more than any other contribution\nand i learned it all from him so\ni did i learned i actually learned it\nall from him like he him and my mom have\nbeen like the two and my grandma they've\nbeen the people who have\nreally been the key factors of\nspirituality in my life and obviously my\nspiritual teacher too um but yeah he he\nhas really shown me what\nleading a spiritual path and really\nfocusing on it what you can actually\nbecome from and i think that's a great\nmotivation because all the qualities and\neverything that he is now that's\npositive has come from the time when he\nwas a monk um i i think would you agree\nyeah and um yeah i just really feel that\nseeing someone live it after they've\nreally gone through an intense period of\nbeing in a spiritual mindset\nin an intense spiritual mindset for that\nlonger period\ni really see those qualities in him day\nto day and how he reacts to things day\nto day is\nis the product of his hard work that\nhe's put in during that time and i think\nthat's a great motivation for me because\ni'm just like well i want to see life in\nthat way like i want to see situations\nin that way or react to people in that\nway or interact with people in this way\nand i think everything has been from\nthat time in your life and so yeah i\nreally think he's been a great\ninspiration for me in that area\nand i just know that that's what brings\nme the most happiness and when i don't\ndo those practices i know it's every\npart of my life suffering so i know that\nif i really feel like i'm not dedicating\nenough time to\nmy spiritual practices then i'm a lot\nsnappier with you and i'm a lot like my\nrelationships suffer my um quality of\nlike the rest of the day just doesn't\nfeel like it's got as much quality as it\ncould have i haven't got the most out of\nthe rest of my day because i haven't\nprioritized my my soul and like my\nconnection uh to god at the beginning of\nthe day and for me that's so important\nand so\nyeah i think it really i ha it\ndefinitely does impact relationships\nwell my relationships around me if i\ndon't have that in my life consistently\nand with quality i think it makes a huge\ndifference yes like your relationship to\nyour spiritual practice is the most\nimportant relationship yeah and because\nof that relationship being right it\nfilters into everything else completely\nhow i feel\nin my spiritual practice is how i end up\nfeeling towards other people around me\nand so if i don't feel like i put my\nbest into that then i know it filters\nthrough everywhere else and i've\nobserved that in myself and so i think\nfor the sanity of everyone around me i\nhave to make sure i do it too because\nit's not just me it affects it affects\neverybody i come into contact with\nbecause i'm a product of that i feel\nyeah do you want to add anything on that\nno i think i'm good\nyeah all right next thing is what's your\nfavorite thing about each other oh i\nfeel like we've said it enough now you\nknow yeah i know i'm checking i don't\nknow i'm joking yeah we've said a lot i\nhave to say one thing i want to say one\nthing i think one of my fav the favorite\nthing about you is how you see things\nhow you see situations like they say\nthat with a monk mindset you should be\nable to see things very it's called\nequine what's the word equipoise\nequilibrium equipoise yeah\nequanimity i always get that word wrong\nso when you whether something goes bad\nor something goes good you're able to\nhave a very like neutral mindset to that\nsituation and not get too excited when\nthings go really really well and not get\ntoo sad when things get really bad and i\nthink from all the ups and downs that\nwe've been through whether it's with\nyour career or whatever it's been\nevery time something goes wrong even if\nlike you miss a plane whatever it is\nhe never gets to a point where he's like\noh my gosh this is the worst thing ever\nwhich is my usual reaction to like\nbefore would have been my usual reaction\nto things he is always just like it's\njust part of the plan like this just\nmakes the story so much better and i\njust really appreciate that because it's\nmade me not overreact and made me see\nperspective in so many situations and\nmade me realize that actually\nyeah like that quality of and he doesn't\nget too excited anything good that\nhappens like whether he wins awards or\nwhatever like the coolest thing may\nhappen and he never gets too excited\nlike he appreciates it and he just you\nknow in his mind he prays and offers it\nback to his spiritual teacher and i just\nthink it's such a deep practice to have\nto not get too excited and and bask in\nyour success does that is basketball\nyeah yeah and not um\nbe too sad and and like kind of\nsit in your sadness for too long\nand i think he really has that great\nbalance of being able to snap out of\nthings and seeing things he doesn't have\nto snap out of it he just doesn't see in\nthat way like he's trained his mind to\nsee things in a way where everything is\njust part of the journey and nothing is\nup up up and down up and down up and\ndown it's all quite\nlike like a little wave rather than like\na tide\num\nso yeah thanks i really appreciate that\nyeah and hers is so easy anyone who's\nmet her already knows this literally\nlike every one of my friends i introduce\nit\nthey they fall in love with her and\nbecome best friends with her\nand then i'm third wheeling all of a\nsudden yeah and i love that like it's\nthe best feeling in the world that\neveryone i introduce her to or everyone\nshe meets she just has this pure\ngenuine light\nand\nall i'm like in life is like don't screw\nthat up like don't mess that up like\nlike let her be that light like just let\nher be\nwhat she is and\nyou know how her parents have raised her\nlike how her grandmother's had an impact\non her like everything she has like her\nspiritual teacher her spirituality\neverything that she has like it's so\npure and genuine and and full of love\nlike i always tell her she's she's like\nthe best person i've met and and i just\nwant you know i just want everyone to\nexperience that like that's\ni want everyone to experience and that's\npartly why we're doing this this podcast\nis because i want everyone to experience\nthat there are people in the world who\njust have no agendas that are loved that\nare being loved at all times that don't\nhave any like negative\nmotive towards anyone or don't want to\nhave like any of jealousy or bring\nsomeone else down to feel better and and\ni think she has that in abundance and\neveryone feels it like as soon as she\nwalks into a room she lights it up with\nher presence and energy and that doesn't\nmean like being the loudest person in\nthe room she's rarely that it doesn't\nmean being the most talkative person it\njust means being that energy and i know\nall of you who know her know that and\nfeel it\nand and i get to feel it every day so\ni mean anything that's true but thanks\ni do i do love i've just realized come i\nmean i've been through so many ups and\ndowns of my own journey of you know\njealousy and whatever it is and not\nbeing that person for people and not\nbeing someone who can help to can be the\njoy for somebody else but\ngoing through that and coming out the\nother end through a lot of journaling\ni've talked about this before and and a\nlot of introspection i just realized i\nactually get so much more joy of being\nother people's joy like i love making\npeople laugh i love making people feel\nloved and i love making people feel like\nthey're cared for and and looked after\nand\nwhatever it is i love i never realized\nactually it's more of a selfish thing\nbecause i love doing that for other\npeople i get the joy out of it and so um\nyeah i think if you can light up\nsomeone's life in some small way or like\nmake someone laugh you just never know\nwhat they're going through and so\ni just think it's such a sweet thing to\nshare and give out to someone like you\ncan give a lot of things up but if\nyou're able to give love and and\nhappiness to someone in a small way\nevery single day like it's such a\nbeautiful it's a gift like it's such a\nsweet gift to give out to people\nso i'm grateful that i'm able to do that\nfor you sometimes and for other people\nthanks again sorry guys i do an american\naccent whenever i'm like it's probably\nthe worst american accent that you guys\nhave heard but i do accents yeah i love\nher accent yeah because i'm terrible at\nthem they're fun\nokay next thing is do you fight and how\ndo you deal with that conflict yeah we\nfight we fight yeah we do fight um but i\nmean i have to say fights don't last\nthat long with us\ni think that's probably the key thing\nlike we have been through especially\nwhen we weren't understanding each\nother's love languages especially when i\nwasn't understanding him more so than\nthe other way around um when we argued\nmy thing would be\nshutting down and not wanting to speak\nabout it and like not communicating and\nanswering phone calls\nand for him it would be like no i want\nto talk about it and i want to get\nthrough it and let's like let's really\ndiscuss everything\nand at the time it just felt like for me\ni was like no i need space but the more\ni've um accepted the way that he likes\nto resolve things the more i realize\nthat actually it so makes so much more\nsense because yeah you may need space\nfor a short period of time but unless\nyou talk through and process it together\nyou never get over that and then it's\nbrought up in the next argument and the\nargument after that and the argument\nafter that whereas if you're able to\nreally sit down and work through\nwhatever even if it's a really small\nissue like picking your shoes up from in\nfront of the door which is something\nwe've spoken about a few times but even\nif it's something as small as that\nand just discussing and explaining okay\nfine this makes me feel like you don't\nvalue me because who else are you\nexpecting to pick up those shoes for\nexample it's a mutual thing i i leave my\nshoes there too but i'm just saying even\nif you break it down to that level of\nsaying actually it's not the action it's\nwhat i feel you're thinking when you're\ndoing that action um and so it's it\nusually isn't the action it's usually\nnot what the person's done it's usually\nhow it makes you feel from that person's\naction if that makes sense that makes\nyou lose um\nand so i think breaking it down to that\nlevel of the feeling you're getting from\nthat person by him doing that or by her\ndoing that actually resolves the issue\nso much faster and that has been\ncompletely you because he really we\nwe've never we've never stepped really\non an argument we've at least discussed\nit before and i really really believe in\nthat i heard it so much but\nthe more we've argued and the more we've\nresolved it before we've gone to sleep\nlike the next morning we are fresh and\nready to go like nothing's happened and\nnot because we're ignoring it and not\nbecause we're pretending like it didn't\nhappen or we've brushed it under the rug\nbut because we have really talked about\nit and try to understand it from each\nother's point of view\nand i think i really think that's made\nsuch a big difference to the way we\nargue yeah i think that's a great point\nthat's such an important point i think\nthe point around\nit's not about the action that hurts\nit's about how that action makes someone\nfeel\nis so much more important because\nsometimes i'm doing something really\nsmall and i'm getting it wrong but i'm\nlike oh it's so small\nbut then she's like no it's big and i'm\nlike well how's it big and then she's\nlike because this is how it makes me\nfeel i'm like oh that is big right and\nthen i have that moment of like aha like\nthe penny drops and i'm\noh okay it's big it's not small again\nbecause you're never really doing things\nto like it's not like you're doing it\nintentionally also and it's also\nunderstanding that aspect of it like\nsaying that i and always reminding\nyourself that if you know that person\nloves you then they are never going to\nbe doing things to intentionally like\nproduct you or intentionally\nmake you feel a negative emotion and and\nif we are doing that then we should be\nvery aware of it and sometimes saying\nthings like remarks of that are in a\nsarcastic tone or whatever actually\nthose things can build up and you feel\nlike you're saying in a jokey way i used\nto do that all the time\nsaying things in like a sarcastic funny\nway to try and get a point across to you\nbut now i've realized that actually just\nasking you in a polite way in a sweet\nway in a loving way can have so much\nmore impact than me sarcastically\nthrowing something in there\nand yeah so i think the way that we say\nthings and the thought behind it\nactually makes such a difference and now\ni know like whenever you do anything\neven if it's small when i proce i\nprocess it in my mind before i say a lot\nof things to you and actually it goes\naway because i'm like i know the\nintention is not that and if i do want\nyou to do something then i'll just ask\nyou politely and i've noticed the\ndifference that it makes\num in in the way that we speak to each\nother when we think about it and process\nit like that rather than\nrather than just shouting out whatever\ncomes into our mind like that's not\nthat's not going to help like not being\nable to control what's coming out of\nyour mouth yeah and anyone who says they\ndon't argue isn't true like everyone\nargues\neveryone fights everyone has\ndisagreements and they're good and\nthey're good to work through because\ndisagreements usually just arise because\nwe all have different upbringings we all\nhave different backgrounds we're all\nraised differently we're raised in\ndifferent amounts of space we're raised\ndifferently in terms of responsibility\nand so now you're putting two different\npeople with two different\nresponsibilities together and if you\ndon't argue about it you don't disagree\nabout it if you don't talk it out then\nall you do like she said is you just end\nup living the same thing again and again\nand again it's really important to draw\nboundaries as well like recognizing like\nthis these are certain things that\nreally annoy me like to say that when\nyou first move in with someone yeah\nthese are the things that annoy me like\nthese are my top three things that will\nget on my nerves like let's try and\navoid that and the other person gets to\nsay the same you're gonna just avoid so\nmuch hassle rather than like thinking oh\nfor the first week it's fine i'm gonna\ndo everything for that person and then\nyou end up feeling upset because they're\nnot reciprocating whatever just just set\nyour expectations draw the boundaries be\nreally open and honest\nabout what works for you and what\ndoesn't yeah and then figure out which\nparts you can help each other on agreed\nso i'm going to ask you one more\nquestion for us then i want to talk a\nlot about you\nso anyone who's watching or listening\nright now if you've got this far i hope\nyou've enjoyed it we've been introducing\nyou to the world of us\nbut i really also want to introduce you\nto the world of my wife she's incredibly\ntalented she's got so many great\ninsights i want you to learn about her\nand and fall in love with her as much as\ni am but before we do that we take the\nlast questions the last question is how\ndo you deal with my hectic travel\nschedule\nyeah i get asked that my type of work\nyeah\num\ni think we've both been very independent\npeople in our relationship and i think\nwhen it comes to us being separate like\nit's just letting the other person get\ndone what they need to get done if i\nneed to be away for work or you need to\nbe away for work\ni know it's not like trouble yeah i know\nthat it's not that you want to be away\nfrom me or that i want to be away from\nyou it's that we need to get stuff done\nit's not the end of the world we love\neach other but we also need to go and do\nwhat we love doing and so\nwhen i can i travel with you but if i\ncan't\ni catch up with the stuff that i really\nneed to get done that maybe i'm not able\nto do in condensed like time when we're\ntogether and so are you just using an\nopportunity to get those things done and\nyeah i just think\ni just think we're in we're really good\nat being independent and we're really\ngood at being together and i don't know\nwhether that answers the question but\nyeah yeah yeah no and i miss her when\ni'm away from her it's not like\ni don't miss her and we both travel for\nwork so i can be away i'm usually away\nfor shorter stints more regularly and\nshe's away for longer stints irregularly\nyes that's kind of how it works so she\ncould be away for like a month or two\nbut that happens like once or twice a\nyear and then i could be away for like\nthree nights but i do that regularly\nyeah every month and so\nwe we've both learned that\nwe get more done personally which is\nreally powerful because you get to focus\non what you're doing i get to focus on\nwhat i'm doing we miss each other more\nso when we get back together we're\nreally excited to be with each other so\nthat adds another level of uh incredible\nbeauty in a relationship and and the\nother thing is\ni think i really believe that\nyou have to be whole\nto then enhance each other in a\nrelationship i don't know if you want to\ntalk about this like you don't complete\neach other in a relationship it's not\nhalf and half it's whole and whole\ncoming together\nit's it's a full person and another full\nperson filling each other up more and\noverflowing it's not about i'm half full\nyou're half full together we're full\nyeah well like i'm trying to i've got a\npart missing of me that i'm trying to\nfulfill from that other person i don't\nthink that works because\nit's it's unnatural to feel like this\nperson is going to feel a part of you\nlike it has to be you being the whole\nperson like you said i just don't think\nwe can expect another person to fill us\nor a gap in us\num\nyeah and i think\ni think that that makes a big difference\ndefinitely of being apart from each\nother because and i also think that i\nyeah i feel like i want to say this too\nthat every relationship is so different\nand i don't think that this would\nnecessarily work for a lot of people or\nor a few people but i don't think it\nwould necessarily work for everybody and\nsome people really need that time when\nthey're with that person all the time or\nmessaging that person all the time and\nthat's totally fine but when i speak\nabout our relationship i just always\nfeel like i make it clear that this like\nthis is just works for us this works for\nus and it's great but i don't think that\nit necessarily works for everybody out\nthere and i don't think what works for\neverybody out there is going to work for\nus\nand i think that's a big that's a big\ndeal because i think we look up to\ndifferent couples or you see people in\nyour life your friends and how they are\nin their relationship and you kind of\nsee things that you may want in a\nrelationship and you think that that's\nwhat you want but you never really know\nuntil you're in a relationship with\nsomebody and you notice how you both\ncomplement each other because their\ntheir qualities are completely different\nto your qualities\nand so yeah i just i just want to add\nthat because it works for us but i don't\nthink it's necessarily going to work for\nyeah for everybody else and there's no\nthese there's foundational things in\nrelationship and there's flexible things\nfoundational stuff is like respect like\nappreciating each other's values yeah\nappreciating each other's goals yeah\nunderstanding each other's backgrounds\nthose are foundational things like that\napplies to every relationship under the\nsun like no matter which relationship\nyou're in including friendships parents\neverything yeah and then there's\nflexible stuff like this which isn't\ncan't be forced into everyone like how\nyou should deal with being a part how\nyou should travel schedules like all the\nkind of functional stuff\nthat is not a thing that there's a right\nor wrong way yeah the foundational stuff\nthere is stuff that works and there's\nstuff that doesn't the flexible stuff is\nadaptable it's different for different\npeople exactly what yeah\namazing so now i want to move into what\ni'm really excited for all of you to\nhear i hope that gave you a big insight\ninto our relationship our life\nwe got married i didn't mention this but\nwe got married in\n2016. yeah april\n23rd\nyeah that's good\nand\nyeah and we've now been together for\nnearly three years\nuh it's been incredible being married\nand i'll come back to that as well but i\nreally want you to hear about my wife's\nincredible insights especially because\nthey're so related to health\nright mental physical\npersonal well-being and she's definitely\nsomeone who\nlives and breeds what she shares it's\nit's not just stuff that she talks about\ni've actually probably never seen\nsomeone who's who's practicing what they\npreach as much and so i'd love for you\nto hear these insights so i'm going to\nask you a few questions really my first\nquestion for you is how did you fall in\nlove with food\nhow did i fall in love with food i've\nalways been a big foodie growing up i\nwas um fairly overweight until the age\nof about 15. let's talk about that yeah\nabout 15.\num probably started losing weight around\nthe age of 16. um\nbut yeah i grew up i grew up always\nloving food always loving carbs like i\nloved bread and all the things i\nprobably shouldn't have my mom was\nactually a personal trainer my mom was a\nfitness instructor so she had like slick\nabs like growing up\nand it was never really bothered by my\nway until i went to school and\nyeah long story short i loved food from\nbeing younger my mom is an incredible\ncook my grandma's an incredible cook my\nsister's also an incredible cook\neveryone like i've been surrounded by\ngreat cooks my whole life and so my mom\nwould always make\nbeautiful food from around the world\nwherever we travel she'd always bring\nthat home with us and she'd make\nwonderful dishes and so\nyeah i think\nbeing supported by that being when i was\nyounger i grew up with a really\nunique taste in food because i'd\nexperienced so much being growing up\nand then my mom actually suggested i go\ninto doing nutrition and dietetics at\ncollege or university\nand\ni did that and that's where my love for\nnutrition grew like i absolutely loved\nunderstanding the qualities of food and\nhow they can affect our bodies and um i\nnever really was into conventional\nmedicine like i never liked taking\nanything from my body i really really\nbelieved in how natural things or foods\nand plants can really change the way\nthat our body reacts to things or\ndisease or\nhealth conditions and so that's where my\nlove for nutrition grew in food\nand then i came across ayurveda and i\nactually don't know how it must have\nbeen\ni don't know how i came across i\nactually can't remember i know my\nbiggest exposure to it was when i when\nwe moved to new york but um\nthat was pretty much encompassed\neverything that i ever thought\nlike everything i wanted to believe in\nit had that in in one one science and\nayurveda is actually iro means life and\nveda means knowledge so it's literally\nthe science of life and it encompasses\nmind body and soul and it really\nbelieves in the mind body connection but\nalso completely believes and and has has\nsolid science behind how food and\nthe qualities of the different foods and\nhow they can affect your body and how\nthey can be healing and how they can be\nmedicine or they can be toxins the same\nfood can be that for for different\npeople and i love it because it's so\nindividual and so personalized that our\nbodies are so different your body will\nreact to a tomato completely differently\nthan mine would and so i really\nappreciate that because every single\nbody is so unique like you can't have\nthe same medicine\nfor one person as you do for thousands\nand millions of people out there it just\ndoesn't make sense our genetics are\ndifferent our body's makeup is different\nour elements in our bodies are different\nand so ayurveda really encompasses all\nof that\nand so that completely grew my love for\nfood\nand healing of food and\nyeah i've always believed in you know we\nalways talk about how love um\nthe mothers love like mother's cooking\nis the best because of the love that she\nputs in it and in ayurveda it really\nbelieves that the consciousness and this\nis one of the things that i loved most\nabout ayurveda it talks about how the\nconsciousness that you cook in or the\nconsciousness that the food's been made\nin\nactually gets infused into that person\nand so however that person's you know\neverything that we're cooking with is um\nis living like every fruit every\nvegetable it's it's it's it's a you know\nit's a plant it grows it has living\ncells and so it takes in our energy and\nso whatever energy you're putting into\nthat food while you're cooking it is\nwhat the other person is is digesting\nand eating and so i thought that was\nsuch a beautiful aspect of it because\nyou can change how a person feels\nthrough the energy that you're putting\ninto even their food\nand so\nmy love for food even bigger after\nhearing that um and yeah\nthat was that's how i fell in love with\nfood that's awesome i love that and it's\nbeen fun watching you\nfall more in love with food and ayurveda\ntell the audience about\nlike a few simple\nwell-being tips for the day so whether\nit's food or whether it's\nessential oils or whether it's anything\nin your life that you add split them up\nso tell me\nthree simple tips that people can do\ndaily with their food let's start with\nthat or with food with food um simple\ntips i would say have three\nmeals a day but your largest meal should\nbe in the afternoon um our body is in\nsync with nature and so when the sun is\nas highest we believe we're in eye radio\nthey believe we have a digestive fire in\nour stomach and so when the sun is at\nits highest is when our digestion is the\nstrongest and so that's when we should\nit's when the nutrients are\nassimilated into our bodies a lot better\nwhen the food is broken down so much\nfaster and efficiently and so if we're\nable to eat our largest meal in the\nafternoon our heaviest meal in the\nafternoon then that's actually a lot\nmore beneficial to our body and having\nour lightest meal in the evening because\nthis is the second tip now yeah number\ntwo um have your lightest meal in the\naft in the evening because one your\nquality of sleep will be so much better\nyour body's not trying to work while\nyou're sleeping when you sleep you want\nevery part of your body to be relaxed\nand every part of your body to feel like\nit's getting the rest\nto rejuvenate and to replenish for the\nnext day\nand so if you're able to\nhave a meal that's much lighter like\nsoups or even a smoothie\nthen\nyour body is able to rest and your food\nis a lot of food that's not digested\nturns into toxins in your body and so if\nyour body's trying to shut down and\nyou're still putting lots of food into\nyour body it actually ends up turning\ninto toxins a lot a lot a lot more\ntoxins are produced if you're digesting\nfood overnight\nand number three drink lukewarm water\nnever drink ice water\nice water or really really cold\nbeverages actually dampens your\ndigestive fire and so\nyou kind of want to drink drinks which\nare either room temperature or warm warm\ndrinks and hot drinks really stimulate a\nlot of things in your body but really\nkeep\nyour body purified and help with toxins\nelimination in your body as well so\nthose are my three tips that's great\ntips yeah and that's so important\nbecause i feel\nso many people\neat really late\nand then go to sleep straight away yeah\nso it's like a lot of people are eating\nat 8 p.m 9 p.m 10 p.m and then going to\nschool straight to sleep yeah or\nsleeping after midnight obviously\nbut you're actually saying we should a\neat less in the evening yes and then of\ncourse you believe in sleeping early yes\nbut the point is yeah okay that makes a\nlot of sense that makes a little sense\ntell me some of the things that i wanted\nto talk to you about was around another\nfew tips on well-being and wellness that\nyou think would be useful to people um\nwell-being and wellness um\nokay so i definitely believe in\nmeditating early in the morning\nbecause\nwell throughout the day there are\ndifferent energies that can affect you\nand so in the morning when\nbefore the ideally before the sun rises\nbut before the sun rises is when you've\nstill got the calming effect of the moon\nand so your mind is a lot more rested\nyour mind is fresh because you've just\nwoken up but also you haven't been\naffected by the like the world is still\nasleep like a lot of people are still\nasleep and so you don't have that much\nenergy around you and so i feel if your\nmind is calmer and the sun hasn't risen\nsun actually brings about the energy of\ndoing and going and get like getting\nthings done whereas before the sun rises\nif you're able to meditate then you\nactually will get a deeper\nuh more focused meditation in the\nmorning\num another lifestyle tip i'd give\nis using a tongue scraper\nlike that is so important in a western\num in western culture it's not normal to\nuse a tongue scrape i don't know if\nanyone's seen it but it's literally so\nsimple it's like a copper or a metal\num\nrod type thing which has huh it's like a\nu shape like a u shape that you can\nbasically you scrape off all the it\nsounds gross but you scrape off all the\ntoxins off your tongue in the morning\nand in the evening you can use it when\nyou brush your teeth\nand\nactually the top if you end up swelling\nthose toxins that can be the beginning\nof like toxins like the toxic toxins\nbuilding up in your body and so using a\ntongue scraper is an ayurvedic must like\nyou sh you have to use a tongue scraper\nyou can get it off amazon you can get it\neverywhere it's just a really simple\nthing to avoid toxins building up in\nyour body\num and did you say one more yeah\none more health tip i would or lifestyle\ntip i would recommend sleeping early um\nyou know there's so much normal science\nbehind it but\neven just to get a good amount of sleep\nbefore 12 o'clock\ni mean i've read so much about it but it\nreally does rejuvenate you the quality\nof sleep that you get is so different um\ncompared to sleeping really late um and\ndoing on a regular basis it reduces your\nimmune system\num it makes you really groggy in the\nmorning like i find that i really and if\ni have too many late nights for a long\nperiod of time i it really affects my\nimmunity like i know i'm gonna get\nunwell or i'm gonna catch a cold\nand so sleeping early is also if you can\nthere are a lot of people who can't\nbecause of jobs but if you can sleep\nearly eat in the afternoon\nwake up early that's like the ideal\nsituation yeah i love it yeah no really\npractical tips i think yeah the things\nthat anyone and everyone can incorporate\nyeah i love those because they're just\nso universal\nit's not going to take someone a huge\nlifestyle change it's not going to cost\nanything like it's totally free to do\nall of these things\nyou don't have to learn a lot like\nthere's nothing to research like you\nknow and and i know that you have\nbecause you are a dietitian and a\nnutritionist by qualification and by\ngoing to university et cetera so\ni do know that everything that you speak\nabout is highly researched and focused\nbut i love how good you are making it so\nsimple and so like easy to understand\nand obviously if you want more tips etc\nyou can go follow\nradhi after this and find out more about\nwhat she's posting about regularly i\nwant you to tell me about why did health\nbecome so important to you because i\nknow this for a fact that i really\nalways focused on my mental health and\nmy mind and for a long time mastering my\nmind was like one of my biggest focuses\nand\nthat's that's where i spent a lot of my\nlife and when i married radi she was\nvery much focused not only on the mind\nbut on the body more\nand when i say body i don't just mean in\nlooking aesthetically good i mean\nfeeling good being active being\ngenuinely healthy beyond size or shape\nor any of that stuff and and that's\nreally helped me in my personal life i\nknow for a fact that i eat better i\nexercise more i take care of myself\nphysically because of you and so i want\nyou to tell me why you started to find\nhealth so important and then i want you\nto tell me a bit about your perspective\non body shape size and our addiction to\nlooking a certain way as opposed to\nfeeling a certain way health became a\nreally important part of my life because\nyeah i grew up i mentioned i grew up\nfairly overweight and at the beginning\nit was a lot more to do with changing\nthe shape of my body i really wanted to\nlose weight and\nat that time i knew i didn't want to do\nanything too extreme like i i because i\ndid my nutrition degree i understood and\ni'd heard a lot about how yo-yo dieting\ncan really affect your metabolism and so\nfor me i didn't want to do the extremes\nof like eating barely anything to then\nget trying to get back to a normal diet\nwhich i know i've seen people that's\nthat they've done that and it ends up\nmaking you put on even more weight\nafterwards and hard to lose weight after\nthat so i really wanted a healthy\nsustainable way of doing that and so\ni mean at the beginning it was at\ncollege and it was i mean at university\nand i started just cooking for me and my\nfriends a lot at university because i\nlived out and\nyeah it was it was to be honest i kind\nof just fell into it through through the\nnutrition degree i ended up learning a\nlot more about it so i started cooking a\nlot more uh vegetables and i mean i grew\nup vegetarian and so my diet was also\npredominantly based on\nlentils and pulses and and vegetables\nand you know all the indian spices and\nflavors\nand so\nyeah that's where my health\nmy this beginning of my health journey\nstarted was to lose weight and then like\ni said when i came into ayurveda and i\nstarted understanding that it just grew\nmy passion for it a lot more\nbut the this\nthe inspiration for it was definitely\nthrough through weight loss but i knew i\ndidn't want to do it in an unhealthy way\nand body image um\nyeah i think that's something growing up\ni always always thought that\nthat to be healthy a good image of\nhealth was my image of my own health was\nbased on other people's body shape or\nbody size and looking around everybody\naround me i always used to think that\nokay for me to be healthy i needed to be\nslim like i needed to be very skinny and\nas i've grown up and i've i've been\nthrough my ups and downs with my way and\nwith\nmy journey of health i really realized\nthat actually\ni've got to this point and when i feel\nthe best like my version of health is\nwhen my organs feel like they're working\nand it's best when my skin feels\nincredible when my digestion feels great\nwhen\nmy hair my nails you know all the all\nthe indicators that i feel represent\ngood health that i've learned is good\nhealth when those things are happening\nand also when my mind feels good like\nwhen do i feel at my most comfortable is\nit when\ni have is it when i'm a specific body\nshape or is it when i'm working out and\ni feel great about it or am i struggling\nto get myself to the gym because of the\ngoal that i have like i feel fine if my\ngoal is to lose weight then for me it's\nbeen really difficult to sustain it and\nand because i want to eat like i really\nenjoy eating i really enjoy eating\ndifferent foods and and having a great\nbalance in life and so for me it became\nmore about how i feel and and how my\nwhole body feels in different ways\nrather than it being an indication of\ndifferent body sizes and body shape and\ni mean i love getting into it like i\nlove i love working out and it's part of\nmy day part of my routine on a daily\nbasis and i don't believe that either\nend of the weight spectrum is healthy\nthere are health conditions associated\nto both\nbut i have realized that body trends\nchange all the time like you know\nthere's going to be a different body\nshape that's in fashion next week and\nthe week after that and the month after\nthat and the year after that but if i am\nconstantly trying to change my shape\naccording to that i'm not sure that\nthat's what health means like there's so\nmuch more to what being healthy means\nthan just body shape and body size um\nand so yeah i think that that's what it\nmeans to me i mean i've i've struggled\nwith it growing up um but at the moment\nnow after being through so much on that\njourney i really feel like that's what\nhealth means to me and that's where i\nfeel the happiest when i'm thinking\nabout health in that way yeah i love\nthat answer it's so true i i grew up\nbecause i grew up overweight as well\nwhen i lost weight for the first time\ni believed that being skinny or being\nslim\nwas health and then when i realized that\nit definitely wasn't because i went\nthrough my own health challenges i was\njust like oh wow like health doesn't\nmean just not eating fatty foods like\nwhich is really as basic and simplistic\nas my knowledge was for so long and so\nhearing you say that obviously having\nyou coach me in my life every day is\namazing i really value it it's changed\nmy life for sure in terms of how i feel\nand what i eat and what i do and how i\nuse my time so so thank you so much and\nand definitely if you follow rally\nafterwards you'll find so many great\ninsights and more expert thoughts and\npractices that i think are genuine and\npractic you know they're practical for\nall of us and and that's what i love\nabout them that what she's saying works\nfor everyone the universal and it's not\nabout getting a specific goal externally\nit's about getting a specific goal\ninternally and i don't think there's\nanything i think it's incredible if\nsomeone wants to\nchange that like i think it's incredible\nif someone has a goal of what they want\ntheir body to be sure but all i'm trying\nto say is that i don't think just body\nshape is an indication of health which i\nfeel is\nis seen as health in a lot in a lot of\nways like a lot of fitness pages or a\nlot of a lot of um\nexercise pages they show\nmost of the body shapes are similar they\nare they are in a specific in a specific\nform in a specific shape and i just\nthink it's incredible how beautifully\nunique everybody's body is and it's like\nthat is the beauty of the world that\neverybody is so beautiful and everyone's\nso unique in their own way that why\nshould everybody be aspiring for the\nsame body shape why can't we all have\nour own individual shape and that be the\nbeauty of it because yeah like trends\nchange like face trends change body\nturns change um\nthe way we speak changes our diet like\nyou know our slang changes constantly i\njust think everything's changing so much\nthat if we try and just focus on who we\nwant to be and change according to our\nown\nmotivation rather than other people's\nview or how we see other people that\nwill make a big difference to our mental\nstate as well\nwhich is the journey i'm still going on\nguys\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love\nif you are getting\ncrazy nervous on a date\nyou're already\nthat's already a reflection of the fact\nthat you've valued the wrong things"
