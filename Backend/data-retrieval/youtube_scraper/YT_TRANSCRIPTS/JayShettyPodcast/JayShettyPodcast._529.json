own\nlife\nwelcome to on purpose lisa\nlisa\nthank you for doing this oh my god are\nyou joking thank you this is so exciting\nliterally i've been so giddy just so\nthat we get to hang out because every\ntime we try and hang out like as a\ndouble date or something there's always\none of us there's always one of us\nthere's always one it's usually radley\nand tom\nyes actually it's never mean you just\nyeah i don't think it is we're the ones\nwe're always trying yeah we're the\norganized ones let's face it\nbut no honestly i was i was looking\nforward to seeing you today as well\nbecause we always have fun when we're\ntogether i'm so proud of you for putting\nthis book together it's so hard\nwriting a book creating a book\nthen going out and sharing the story\nthen going through the emotions of\nactually talking about everything that's\nin the book and especially when it's a\nbook about confidence\nuh let's let's start we we know each\nother fairly well but i i always feel\nlike i'm going to learn so much more\nabout you today which i'm very excited\nabout when you were growing up\nwho for you did you look at as the\nepitome of confidence like who was it\nthat you thought or what was it or was\nit a character or a role that you were\nlike that person seems confident the\nperson i admired the most was jodie\nfoster wow yeah\num i don't really talk about this much\nactually but growing up i so loved\nmovies i was like the kid that would\ngather three in the morning and wish one\nday i'm gonna win the academy award for\nbest movie director you know like that\nwas the dream and so i really did look\nat who is in the space that's doing the\nthings and jody foster always seemed so\nconfident to me she was in front of the\ncamera she was behind the camera she was\nwriting she was directing she was\nproducing and so i just thought of\ncourse i know differently now where you\nsee a woman that always shows up i just\noh my god she must have like the most\nconfidence but in having like learned\nabout her and her story and you know\nshe's very like very private and so i\ndismissed the fact that she probably\nwasn't confident but always showed up\nand that's kind of what the book is\nabout is that you don't have to always\nfeel confident to show up so yeah jody\nfoster i think yeah wow i didn't know\nthat yeah and i loved that i've heard\nyou talk about that and of course you\ntalk about in the book this idea of how\nwe think we have to be confident\nbefore we do big things we think we have\nto have this courage and bravery before\nwe do big things and you go on to send\nthe book that actually no when you do\nthese things that's what makes you\nconfident what was one of the first\nthings that you started to do or\nexperiment with where you started to\ngain confidence or build confidence so i\nlove that you said build so i've got a\nline in the book it's like it's like a\nmuscle you wouldn't go to the gym and\nwant glute to steal after doing a couple\nof squats i mean i do want that to\nhappen\nyou wanted to\nbut do you get glutes still\nuse your glutes i mean i have no idea\ndefinitely no i don't have any glutes so\ni have no idea it's amazing but you\ndon't just go what you want to but you\ndon't and so that is like with\nconfidence we kind of want it already\nbut yeah if you think of it like a\nmuscle you can go and you can train it\nand that's the point is that for me it\nbecame being thrown into the deep end\nnot feeling like i had any confidence i\nwas completely insecure i was actually\nvery inadequate so it wasn't even like\noh i just you know i had it and i was\njust you know not feeling great about\nmyself no no when we started quest i\ndidn't know what i was doing at all and\nso the confidence part came afterwards\nit came as the byproduct of doing things\nfreaking out falling on the floor\ngetting back up learning from it and\nthen over time becoming competent and\nthe confidence part i think i think is\njust we want to feel great about\nourselves that's it we want to feel\ngreat about ourselves before we try\nsomething perspective is everything so\nhow do you shift that and so how i did\nit was instead of focusing on the\nconfidence say what is that end goal i\nwant confidence to do what and now once\nyou have that then you put in a plan a\nblueprint of how you're going to get\nthere because your confidence will come\nafter that i love that i i think you're\ncompletely\nshifting how people think about\nconfidence because i still see\nthose things like this how to be\nconfident stand this way do this and and\nthose things work and they're useful but\nyou're talking about a deeper sense of\nconfidence how do you define confidence\nand radical confidence obviously how do\nyou define that because i do think\nyou're encouraging us all to move to a\nmuch more deeper level of confidence\nyeah i'm trying definitely thank you\nthe word confidence i do think is about\na feeling you want to feel great about\nyourself before you start something and\nradical confidence is it's not about\nfeeling great about yourself it's about\nhow do i get to that end goal so i can\nhave the life and the dream i've always\nwanted that's it and so it's not going\nto be easy and that's the big part of it\nand because it's not easy and because\nyou're all the time moving forward even\nwhen you're scared you're moving forward\neven when you're fearful\nhow do you keep moving forward now it's\nvery easy to say oh just do it anyway\nwhen you're scared no no if you've got\ncrippling anxiety if you're like really\nfeeling badly about yourself telling\nsomeone to just do it anyway doesn't\nactually help so to me it has to be a\nblueprint if you want to lose weight\nsome people like my mom she was so\nseverely overweight just telling her\nwell mom i'll get you a gym membership\nit wouldn't have helped because she\nfeels so badly about herself she doesn't\neven have the radical confidence to walk\ninto the gym so okay how do you actually\nget someone to take their health or like\ntake those stepping stones maybe right\nnow all you need to do is put your shoes\nby the bed that's it that's what you're\ngoing to do tomorrow you're not going to\ngo to the gym you're not going to do\nanything else you're just going to put\nyour shoes by their bed and then the\nnext day you're going to put your shoes\non and what you're going to do is every\ntime you do it you're actually going to\ngive yourself a pat on the back and said\nyesterday i didn't put the shoes on and\ntoday i did and it becomes these little\nmicroscopic movements towards the dream\nthat you really want so that you can\nbuild that competence to build the\nconfidence yeah that i mean especially\nthat part the the competence\nto build the confidence i completely\ncompletely agree with you i speak to a\nlot of friends who have young kids\nand they'd always they'll always say to\nme like oh my kid's not very confident\nand or he lacks or she lacks or they\nlack in confidence\nand\nwhen i look back to being a young kid\ni would say i wasn't confident when i\nwas growing up and i was bullied i was\noverweight i was one of the we grew up\nin the same area i was one of the only\nsouth asian indian kids in our area and\nso i was bullied for several things\nand\ni would say it took me a\nlong time before i developed a sense of\nconfidence\nbut it was exactly what you just said it\nwas building competence that led to\nconfidence so my parents forced me to go\nto public speaking school built tons of\nconfidence my parents forced me to go to\ndrama school built tons of confidence so\nwhen they forced me to build competence\nthat built confidence and i think we're\nso scared that we don't build skills we\nthink we can solve how we feel\nwithout building a skill does that make\nsense oh my god 100 and that's part of\nit it's like me wanting to let's say\nit's getting on stage i was so petrified\nto get on stage but my my goal is impact\nso tom pulls me aside and he's like babe\nas your husband you've said you want to\ncreate impact but you keep saying no to\nthese speaking gigs and so\ni'm just letting you know that your\nactions aren't aligned with what you say\nyou want in life so i was like okay\ntypical time typical time i know calling\nso it's like okay i recognize that\ngetting on stage actually does solve\nthat serve that mission that i really am\nlike holding my core to but how on earth\ndo i get on stage how do i build that\ncompetence when i just feel so badly\nabout myself when i'm so embarrassed i'm\nso i'm worried about falling on my face\nand like really embarrassing myself how\non earth do i do that and it becomes you\nsaid your parents forced you as an adult\ni think it becomes harder we get very um\nin our own heads and i think you know as\nkids we're easily you can learn you can\nwalk you can tie your shoes you learn\nhow to do you don't do it the first time\nbut you just take time but as adults we\ndon't give ourselves the grace to go\nthrough that training period and so for\nme in when i'm thinking about public\nspeaking i do think about those\nincremental steps in order to get there\nbecause i can't just\nwant to yeah to your point it's like i\ncan say i really want this\nbut to so many people that's just not\nenough it's like it is that isn't enough\nto actually get people to act on their\ndream yeah absolutely absolutely now\nwhat i love about the book and i do\nrecommend everyone goes and grabs their\ncopy it's called radical confidence i'm\nspeaking to lisa biliu 10 no bs lessons\non becoming the hero of your own life\nmake sure you go grab a copy we've got\nit in the subject area we've got it in\nthe comments section everywhere\ni love books i love content that has\nlessons and\nthe fact that you have 10 in here makes\nit very simple and i love that and i\nwant to dive through a little bit of\nthese so everyone gets a feeling of like\noh i need to you know go and dive into\nthat chapter\nfirst of all you say your dreams are a\ngamble bet on yourself\nand the one that i loved out of all of\nthese was i can stop making excuses\nbecause i think there are a lot of\nexcuses where do you think those excuses\ncome from what were some of the excuses\nyou've told yourself and what are some\nof the excuses you hear that other\npeople are telling themselves great\nquestion and i just want to say\nsometimes here's a problem with the\nexcuses sometimes they're real\nthat's the problem sometimes yes you\nhave every reason to say i can't do i\ndon't have the time right j how busy you\ndude right how busy yeah oh my i i i\nthink i work most days 7 a.m until like\n10 p.m till i go to bed yeah that's\ninsane so let's say something comes to\nyou you can easily say well i don't have\ntime is that an excuse or a valid reason\nit's true but now if it's getting in\nyour way of your dream how do you see it\nthere's an excuse or is a reason it's\nlike everyone makes their decisions\nright so you would make the decision say\ni can't do that because i'm too busy to\nme that's a decision that you've made\nyes and so for me the excuse is to look\nat your reasons why you're not making\nthe moves that you want to or that you\nsay you're going to\nwrite them down and then with no\njudgment you can hear me say that a lot\nbecause i used to judge myself and it's\nthe judgment that would hold me back so\nwriting down all those reasons let's say\nyou've got your goal why aren't you\nthere yet so my goal was i want to make\nmovies that's when mean time we first\ngot married tom was going to go out make\nenough money and i was going to support\nhim at home just going to be for a year\nso one year turns into two years turns\ninto three turns into four and so i\nstart losing all my hopes and dreams in\nthat period and the excuse i kept making\nto myself is well we still don't have\nthe money yet to make movies and that\nwas the reason that i was using that we\nweren't making movies now if i'd stepped\nback he said okay my goal is to make\nmovies what are the reasons well i don't\nhave enough money is that a reason or an\nexcuse if you drill down\nit's an excuse because i could make a\nshort movie i could make a two minute\nfilm\nthat is shot on my iphone that costs\nnothing but in my head i had so stuck to\nthe big dream of making a hundred\nmillion dollar movie that every time i\nwasn't even taking one step i kept using\nthe excuse that i didn't have money i\nkept using the excuse that we didn't\nhave the time that i was well hang on in\nfact here's a perfect excuse that i\nwonder if your audience will resonate\nwith\nwe used to say it like tom would go out\nto work and it's like why wasn't i like\nreally moving towards my dream my goal\nand as we started to build quest as it\nwas getting more and more successful i\nwas like well i can't focus on quest\nbecause i still have to do all these\nthings at home\ni can't i can't put all my time in there\nbecause i still have to do the laundry i\nstill have to cook\nnow is that a reason or is an excuse\nsome people will say of course you have\nto do laundry that's a very valid reason\nnow here's the thing that's a choice you\ndon't have to do laundry and i used it\nas an excuse time and time again of why\ni wasn't moving towards my dream because\nthe truth was when i finally realized it\nwas an excuse i sat down with tom and i\nsaid baby i love you more than life\nitself but i don't want to cook for you\nanymore i don't want to do your laundry\nanymore and so if i get time i'll do it\ni'll do maybe every three weeks and so\nhe's like baby to see you happy what\nkind of husband would i be to say that i\nneeded my underwear cleaned because um\nout of your hap you know your happiness\nand so one day i literally didn't do the\nlaundry for so long he's like all right\nbabe i'm out of laundry so i guess i'm\ngoing to work commando\nand he actually went to work without\nunderwear so you can see how one time\nonce upon a time i had the mindset that\ndoing the laundry was absolutely part of\nhow you should live but by removing that\nas an excuse and saying hey this\nactually is getting in your way of your\ndream and your goal\nremove it and now where did it lead the\nhusband went to work commando and i\ndidn't think twice about it why because\ni was working on my dream i love that\nthat's such a great example because\nyou're so right that often your excuse\ncan be real\nbut it can still be an excuse\nand i love the idea you gave about\nmaking movies too\nbecause i do think we have the big dream\nand we don't see this small step\nand the way you described that to me\nmade so much sense because i was\nspeaking to someone recently and i was\ntelling them about when i moved to la\nand they've just kind of moved to la and\nthey're starting out and they're at film\nschool and it's early days and i was\njust saying that you know when i came to\nla\nthere's so many things that i still want\nto do that i haven't done yet but if i\njust wanted to do those things i\nwouldn't have built everything else\nand i don't want to be someone who just\nhas a big dream i want to be someone\nwho's doing lots of small things towards\nthat big dream and i think sometimes the\nbig dream cripples us\nand we keep pushing it off and we keep\nsaying oh no well like you said i don't\nhave a hundred million dollars how am i\nmaking a movie\nwe're living in this amazing time where\nanyone can make a movie for very cheap\nfor for free even\nuh and it's incredible to think about it\nthat way so i'm so glad you've written\nabout that and in the book just so\neveryone knows\nlisa goes through in chapter one she\nalways talks about how you can dream big\nhow you can change your life how you can\nbet on yourself i literally just picked\nout one thing from one chapter that i\nfind interesting because i find that\nexcuses keep growing no matter where\nyou're at\nno matter where you're at and what i've\nrealized for me is that my excuse is\nbased on a season\nso right now i'm in a season of writing\nmy book\ncomes out next year my second book and i\nknow that when i'm writing my book all\nmy creative energy goes into writing a\nbook so i know that i can't really do\nmany other things that are highly\ncreative because all my energy goes into\nthe book but as soon as my book time's\nover i now get all this new creative\ntime back and i can do a lot of stuff so\nduring this period i accept that my\nexcuse is true that i can't do much more\nbut once that's over now i know i can go\noff and do other things yeah and i would\nactually then when i come to that\nconclusion going oh okay this excuse\nmakes sense based on what i'm trying to\ndo i then flip and go cool this is no\nlonger an excuse it's a reason yes and\nso i because here's what i like to\nactually like to call myself on it so\nlisa you're using that as an excuse and\nso i want to make sure that i'm always\ndefining that word that gets me the\nemotion i'm trying to fill to propel me\nforward i love that that makes so much\nsense yeah exactly and that's what\nyou're right it's not an excuse it's a\nreason yeah i love that all right rule\ntwo is called make up your mindset and\nthe one that i loved out of all of these\nsections of this chapter is i can get\ngood at anything yeah\ni love that mindset can you tell me\nabout something that you were once\nterrible at that today you would\nconsider yourself to be fantastic at and\ni know you won't hold back because i\nknow we both agree that it's so easy to\nlike never accept that we actually got\ngood at anything but i'm hoping everyone\nand i'll do the same when you hear me\nand lisa own that we're now good at\nsomething please see it as a sign for\nyou to own your own growth because we\nlive in this world where we judge\nourselves when we're losing and then we\njudge ourselves when we're winning and\nit's so important to lose judgment at\nboth times so true yeah i been the\nstay-at-home wife for eight years being\nthrust into quest nutrition i was just\nhelping out the husband i'm a good greek\nwife i'm gonna help the husband out what\ndo i need to do now i i didn't have any\nskill sets in building a company zero i\nknew how to be a great wife i knew\nfilmmaking because i went to film school\nfor it and i knew how to take care of my\ntwo dogs and my husband that was like\nmyself that's pretty good it's pretty\nnothing not too bad but when you go into\na startup company every single day i was\nfaced with things i had no idea to the\nlittle things of a palette i was\nshipping bars off my living room floor\nwe grew at 57 000\nso literally within a few weeks a few\nmonths i'm shipping out 20 boxes and so\nthe ups guy comes along and he's like\nyou know i can actually take a lot more\nif you put everything on a palette i was\ntoo embarrassed to admit i had no idea\nwhat a palette was so i was like okay\ngreat thanks mate you know when he\ndrives off i run back to my computer and\ntype in google what on earth is a\npalette\nyou know and then the image comes up\nlike oh yeah i kind of know what those\nare where do i get one from how much\nthey cost so i literally just keep\ntyping in where do i get one from how\nmuch do they cost\nand that's the sort of thing that\nstarted to build my self-esteem around\nbeing the person that can figure it out\nnot the person that knows everything\nand it be it becomes such a safe place\nfor me because now i don't worry about\nnot knowing something i just if i have\nthe mentality and the ethos that i can\nfigure it out if i put the time and\nenergy into it some things may take a\nsecond what is a palette some things may\ntake two years but regardless if i\nbelieve i can i can actually take the\nsteps forward but if i believe i can't\ni'm not going to and let's face it so\nmany people are also there to be ready\nto tell you what you can't do yeah so\nthat's why you have to believe in\nyourself that you know how to because\nyou can very much get influenced from\nthe outside world like one of the very\nearly days i don't if you know this\nstory actually one of the very early\ndays of quest\nwe had like justin bieber's cousin was\nlike contacted quest and so they're like\noh my god lisa we can get request a boss\nto justin bieber but here's the catch\nhe's in dubai and you've only got like\n24 48 hours to get it to him and\neveryone was like but it's impossible\neveryone said it's impossible i called\nup my ups guy that it's impossible it's\na food product it's dubai it's imports\nit's like all this thing like logistics\nand in that moment i was like no one's\ngonna fight for your dream more than you\nwill\nso of course my request to my even the\nups person i'm making his life harder\nso when he sees the hurdle or he's like\nit's impossible but no one will fight\nfor your dream more than you will so i\ndidn't take impossible as an option i\ndidn't know what i was doing i figured\nit out and so i literally said okay if\nyou're the person that figures out what\nwould this look like don't take no for\nan answer ask questions ask boat loads\nof questions instead of feeling badly\nabout myself for not knowing just keep\nasking so i would get on like oh okay\nyou can't help me can i speak to your\nmanager please manager comes up it's\nimpossible can you explain to me why\nwell because of the customs all right\nwhat if what if i overpaid customs well\nbut what about this slip well okay i'll\njust fill out the slip in advance and\ni'll be up at three in the morning in\ncase it gets there i'll be on call like\nevery time there's a problem\ndo you have a way to think around it and\nit's not that i knew what i was doing\nthat's the key is that i just had the\nmentality that no one's going to fight\nfor my dream more than me and i'm not\ngoing to take no as an answer and\nbecause of those things i ended up\nfiguring it out and i ended up getting\nbars to jb in time i don't know if you\nactually ever received them that's the\nheartbreaking thing it was like i got a\nconfirmation they arrived to his oath\nhis hotel\nand to me though that was the thing i\nheld on to that no one thought it was\npossible all the experts thought it was\nimpossible i didn't know what i was\ndoing\nbut i went in there as the learner and\nsaid lisa you're going to figure it out\ni love that story do you know why\nbecause it's so practical\nlike it's so tangible it's not like this\nethereal dream that you made come true\nit's literally like we need to get these\nbars from this country to this country\nand you can see all the steps it takes\nand you can see every moment where you\ncould have just gone\ncan't be bothered now and that's\nliterally the only thing and actually\nwhether he got it or not is irrelevant\nto the fact that you were able to figure\nit out yes and it shows that now you can\napply that to anything big or small and\nnow you are applying it to movies and\ncomic books and you know whatever else\nit may be but it started off by just\ntrying to get a bar\nfrom from one country to another\ni honestly hope that everyone's\nlistening and watching the reason why i\nlove lisa's examples is because they're\njust so tangible they're so real and i\nthink sometimes it's like maybe you're\nlistening right now and you have a\ncompany you want to start or you have a\npodcast you want to launch or you have a\nyoutube channel that's in your head and\nit really is as simple today as going on\ngoogle typing it in and trying it and i\nthink the biggest mistake the least i\nwant to hear your take on this\nis\ni think we often try things too slow\nand therefore\nthe results are more painful to accept\ni'll give an example of what i mean if\ni'm interested by something let's take\nsomething like\nwhat you just did if you took three\nmonths to type in what's a palette\nthen three months later you'll figure\nout how much they cost and then three\nmonths later maybe the prices go up and\nnow in 12 months you're going oh well i\nguess that wasn't useful\nwhereas if you go back that day like you\ndid and then you went to resist how much\nthey cost and then you reset the budget\neverything else that you did you learn\nit so fast and now you can take action\nso often what i think is that we need to\nexperiment more often\nas opposed to like trying to make\nsomething happen over a year if you try\nand do it in an hour you're actually\nmore likely to learn and grow rather\nthan saying okay i'm to spend 10 minutes\non this every week\nif you can spend an hour on it this\nweekend you probably make a bit more\ngrowth and you'll feel more momentum i\ndon't know what your thoughts are a\nthousand percent i think the reason why\npeople don't know is they fear not being\nit not being perfect yeah so they're\nlike well let me just think of it like\nlet me take the stepping stones let me\nprocess it let me and i actually get it\nthat fear really can stop so many of us\nbut that's why i have the identity of\nbeing the learner of being the person\nthat actually you know what i don't know\nthis today and i don't judge myself for\nit but i can learn and it's that if like\nwhat is that goal how do you keep moving\nforward and then the fear part\nthat voice in the head that i to i very\nmuch talk about is telling me well lisa\nyou don't know what you're doing\nreleasing you know who do you think you\nare like you don't have any you know\nexpertise in this area but if i'm then\nbypass it by being like oh no you don't\nknow anything so hey you should learn\nyou know it's like bypass that voice to\nthen get you to act yeah and then in\nthat action you then feel the competence\nthat then builds the confidence to then\nkeep going yeah but\nit is that starting point that is very\nfearful and so recently in fact\ni don't know how you felt in like\nlaunching a book and stuff like that and\nwe're very creative so as part of the\ncreative i get very um hypo um\nmicroscopic on everything it's like\nthat's not good enough no that's not\nright and i realized i was actually\nholding myself back because to your\npoint like i wasn't just like\nlearning from it i wasn't just putting\nthings out and so i ended up sitting\ndown and saying okay\nright now this fear of like trying to be\nperfect is actually holding you back i\ndon't judge myself for it but i say how\ndo i overcome this feeling because i\ncan't force myself not to feel it so i\nhave to come up with some a plan a\ntactic to overcome the way that i'm\nhandling it so i sat there and i was\nlike oh i'm looking for perfection does\nperfection help impact people with this\nbook no okay great so how do i overcome\nthis i need to be deliberate not perfect\nokay that's actually really strong that\nreally hit me be deliberate how do i\nremind myself that in moments because\nwe all have habits so the habit of me\nright now is to be perfect so how do i\novercome this habit of being perfect\nokay i'm going to put in my phone in\nsomething i call in my um in the book\nit's like phony roulette so it's\nactually you've got this roulette but\nit's you put a message in your phone you\nclose your eyes and you spin\nthe time and you close your eyes and you\ndon't know what time you've said it and\nthe whole point for this is to keep\nreminding yourself in random moments of\nthe message you're trying to\nbecome a habit in your mind so i put in\nbe deliberate not perfect and i did the\nroulette and i did it for about three\nweeks and after that i don't need it\nanymore now every time something comes\nto me i just go okay i want to be\ndeliberate not perfect okay yep great\nthis is good to go wow so wait you\nchoose the message yeah and then you put\na random time yeah and then your phone\nwill buzz at that time and remind you of\nthat message that you put in yeah and i\ndon't know that's so cool and i don't\nknow when it's gonna go off yeah yeah\nyeah yeah so look sometimes it goes off\nat the worst time\nwhen you're in an interview\nright but i did this once that's so cool\nyeah i i did it once as an experiment\nbecause i am always going i don't judge\nmyself for how i feel but i don't accept\nthat as an excuse yeah so okay you've\nthis is real don't feel badly but what\nare you gonna do to overcome it so that\nwas one of those things i was actually\nreally scared for ted talk this is\nactually how it started i was so scared\nabout getting in front on stage and i\nhad all these like tactics okay i'm\ngonna have a blueprint how do i think\nabout it how do i turn up what's my\nwonder woman cuffs like all these things\nof how am i gonna get on stage in the\nfirst place and part of that ritual\nleading up to it was i did a little you\ngot this and i did the little muscle\nemoji and i closed my eyes and i spun it\nnow sometimes it happened in like when i\nwas peeing you know like it was like not\na great time but it really really worked\nlike it hit me so hard and in moments\nwhen i was practicing for my speech\ni didn't realize that it went off so now\nhere i am practicing i'm reading over\ni'm getting in my own head i'm getting\ntense i'm like oh my god can i do really\ndo this the alarm happened to go off at\nthat time so now i'm like oh yeah i do\ngot this lisa so now i go back and it\nbecomes this little reminder your own\ncheerleader wow i love that idea that's\nsuch a cool that's absolutely brilliant\nand and also that statement be\ndeliberate not perfect yeah i think it's\nsuch a great mantra and and i'm gonna be\nhonest here as well like so\ni\nreally dislike the cover of my book my\nfirst book that i did i really dislike\nit uh and i was forced into having to\npick and decide because of time\nand so i when i was writing my first\nbook i was so absorbed in writing it i\ndidn't really have time to think about\nthe cover we got to finish writing and\nthen i was told i need a cover and\ntestimonials within the next two weeks\nand i didn't know anyone who designed\nbook covers at the time and so i was\nscrambling to do that and i was trying\nto get the testimonials from people and\nasking for testimonials as you know is a\ntough thing to do and she's like okay\nwell now i've got two weeks to ask\nsomeone for something so i'm doing this\nand then all of a sudden then they're\nlike oh no now we've got to just go with\nthis cover and we're going to design it\nand i really don't like it now\nyou know it didn't impact the book in\nthe sense of it's been wonderful to see\nthe book out there\nand i hope people can sense my intention\ni think that's what i always focus on is\nmy intention is i just want to serve\nthrough this book\nand people can feel that\nbut\ni give myself the grace and space that\nthat was my first book i didn't know the\nprocess i didn't understand\nthis time i've handed in my first\nmanuscript and i'm working on the cover\nalready yeah and it's like it's okay\nand that's like you know and the reason\nwhy i'm sharing that is people may look\nat my first book and of course it's sold\nreally well it's done really well\nwhatever and it's like and people may\njust be like oh jay you just nailed it\ni'm like but even i don't feel i nailed\nit like i didn't because there was a\npart of it that i would have wanted to\nimprove yeah you've got an epic phone oh\nthank you and this you know this look at\nthis radical confidence for uncover it's\nso beautiful it's amazing\nand and i think that\nwhat we have to realize is that as\ncreators we'll always be critical of our\nown work even when no one notices it and\nso i wanted everyone to hear that that\nyou're doing that i'm doing that we're\nall doing that so if your first episode\nof your podcast isn't great you've got a\nsecond one if the first video on your\nyoutube channel is not great there's\nanother one like there's always another\ntape yeah and i love the critical part\nof it because what you're doing is yeah\nyou're being critical about yourself but\nyou're not letting it stop you move\nforward and that's the key it's like i\ndon't always just go yeah lisey you got\nthis like no no i definitely assess like\ni am critical of myself i do like to\nreassess but i'm at the stage at least\nin my growth that i don't let that stop\nme and in the past it would in the past\ni would look at something that i've done\nand i would be so critical of it that i\nwould beat myself up so much that it\nstopped me from moving forward yes yes i\nthink that's a really good clarification\nas well and and i think deliberate not\nperfect is such a brilliant mantra so i\nlove that all right going on i love this\none validation is for parking\ni i was like i love parking validation\nuh but yes validation is for parking the\none that i love about this one\nis i can validate myself yeah i think\nthat's been such a big lesson for me\nwhat is something you think you\nconstantly wanted other people to\nvalidate you for what is something that\nyou've always seeked external validation\nfor that took the longest journey oh\nthat took the longest journey that's\ninteresting i think there's still a part\nof me that kind of i think that maybe\nand maybe i'm wrong but it seems like\nthere's a part of everyone that still\nwants to be validated and it's just\ninstinctual so going back to i don't\njudge myself for it but i know it's\nunhealthy\nso in fact here's a perfect example it's\nnot really answering your question but\nit kind of is\nwith the book i was originally when\nsomeone offered me the book deal the\nvery first words out of my mouth were\nwho would buy a book from me\nso there's the insecurity\nso i'm like lisa ah that 14 year old\ngirl is still inside you it's okay you\nknow like she still does exist that's\nokay but i'm not gonna let her hold me\nback so i start writing the book\nnow in writing the book i start to go oh\ni really want a new york times number\none right like we've all got so many\nlike yo buggers amazing and everyone and\nso it's like oh i've got a goal i'm\nstill got a good i think you know i'm a\nbus entrepreneur so i set my goal i set\nwhere i'm trying to go and i move\ndeliberately towards that now here's the\nthing what if i don't reach her does me\nnot getting there now mean that the\nbook's no good\nand i realize the danger of looking for\nexternal validation for the work that\nyou do and the way that you show up and\nnow the only thing that i can do is do\nthe foundation work so that when that\nhappens the instinctual part of lisa\ndoesn't come out\nand so what i said is what's my north\nstyle why did i actually write this book\nyes i have the goals but i don't want\nthe goal without you actually creating\nimpact so let's say i want new times\nright but does it actually create impact\nthat's my north star that's the the big\nbig like\nthing that i'm going towards so\nhow are people going to respond to it\nokay yes of course i want it to create\nimpact but what if it actually doesn't\nimpact anyone jay what if everyone hates\nit that's a big possibility when i was\nwriting i didn't know and so what am i\ngonna do to make sure that i still feel\nvalidated and i still feel my worth and\nso i said what am i going to do now\nnumber one do you give it your all\nbecause and here's the thing when i say\nthat you know\neveryone at home you know if you've\ngiven it your you can tell other people\nyou have but you really know so am i\ngoing to give my all yes or no yes great\nthat's going to be a metric i'm going to\ngo by if i gave him my all i've got\nnothing else to give\nam i going to learn from this experience\nif it does badly yes did i have\nbeautiful intentions\nyes am i going to really if it fails not\nbeat yourself up but are you absolutely\ngoing to take a hard look and identify\nall the things that you think that you\nfailed in yes\ngreat now i can move forward\ni can move forward and if it doesn't do\nwell i've got those bullet points that\ni'm going to go back to and say i had\nevery intention to help women that felt\nlike i did\ni had that north star i knew what i was\ntrying to do i gave it my all and so if\nnow no one likes it i'm not going to\nfeel badly about myself because i showed\nup and that's the thing jay no one can\naffect whether you show up or not forget\nabout the failure and successes no one\ncan affect whether\nwhoever's listening at home if you\nshowed up or not the only person that\ncan affect that is you\ni love that and that's actually what\nneeds to happen before\nwe start any journey\nand i think a lot of society has made us\nfocus on the goal so it's like what's\nyour goal where do you want to be\nwhat's the output what's the result and\nwhat you've just described is the input\nit's what you're bringing it's what\nyou're focused on and i think that's one\nof the biggest mistakes of goal setting\nis that goals are just made up targets\nthey're just made up targets they're\njust random things and it's like they're\nnice they're cool\nbut they don't make you happy because by\nthe way even the people that reach their\ngoals are not happy\nbecause it's never satisfying it's like\nokay we got to this goal but now we\ndidn't stay there or we got to that goal\nbut we didn't get the next time or this\ntime we hit that goal constantly but i'm\nstill dissatisfied because i became\nlonely in the process right so there's\nalways something else around that goal\nso\nit's not only the people that don't make\ntheir goals that are not happy it's also\nthe people that make their goals that\nare not happy because it's not about the\ngoal yeah exactly and the result is\nnever guaranteed either exactly so it's\nlike what are you going to do work hard\nfor something pour your heart into it\nand only feel good about yourself\nwhether it succeeds or not it's just not\nsustainable yeah and so to me that's\nwhat i look at what is sustainable for\nme to keep showing up for the rest of my\nlife yeah and that's like when i think\nabout oh if i'm looking at the results\nit's not sustainable in a year in two\nyears when i crash and burn because look\nwhen you try anything new the chances\nare you're gonna fail at it at some\npoint yeah and so if i'm failing how do\ni keep getting back up\nit's that precise thing yeah i love that\nprinciple i i think that's just so huge\nbecause i just think we as a society\nconstantly force people to\nset these big dreams goals and targets\nthat are arbitrary to our actual joy and\nhappiness like they don't actually\nconnect to feeling good yeah even if you\nmake it right and so i think that's the\nbiggest one all right i want to go\nthrough a few more of these uh because\nthere's so many good ones i'm skipping a\nfew chapters because i want you to get\nthe book and read it but there's a few\nthings that i want to talk about okay\nthis one's a big one uh this is chapter\nseven which is called toughen the f up\nbuttercup um and it says i can stop\nsaying i'm sorry yeah\nthis is huge like the amount of people\nthat constantly feel that they have to\nstop saying sorry what are some of the\nthings that you hear a lot in this space\nof things that people apologize a lot\nfor so i also wanted to put a little\nasterisk to that because in the book i\nactually i think it's like the first\nline is guys stop apologizing and yet\nguys always apologize\nbecause that's the thing a lot of what i\nsay like feels like almost sometimes\ncontradictory but look i think that the\nmessage of just stop apologizing isn't\nactually accurate yeah right because if\nit's like if you up your set your friend\nand you're the one that is the person in\nthe fall you should apologize\nif like if if i've said something that\nreally i that has upset tom and it's\nlike okay i didn't mean to upset him of\ncourse you should apologize so i never\nwant people to think that apology is a\nbad thing the problem is we apologize so\nmuch that what it's doing is it's\ntelling you that you're make your\nopinion isn't valid so like i think the\nexample i give in the book is like let's\nsay for instance i choose you know me\nand very much like you self-care is very\nimportant\ni must take care of myself first before\ni show up for anyone else and with how\nmuch we work i burn out and so i need to\nmake sure that i don't go to that\nburnout so sometimes i get invited to a\nlot of amazing places and i know in that\nmoment it's i have to actually choose\nself-care now if i'm apologizing for\nputting myself first\nsubconsciously over time what is that\ndoing it may not seem like it in the\nmoment i just think when you keep having\nthat repetition in your head that voice\nthat mindset that you're always\napologizing for putting yourself first\nit becomes detrimental to you and so for\nme i was like i'm no longer going to\napologize for putting my self-care first\ni'm always going to be very respectful\nit's never like well you know if you but\nit absolutely is\nhow you use language makes a difference\nthe language you use and that's really\nthe big key thing in all of this if you\nsay the word sorry\ndoes is that actually authentic to you\nor are you dismissing\nsomething that's actually very important\nto you like self-care so if someone\ninvites me out i won't actually if it\nand i'm doing self-care instead i\nactually won't say i'm sorry i'll say oh\nmy god i really hope you have an amazing\ntime you know let me know how it is but\nright now you know i'm unable to attend\nobviously very politely but i just don't\nuse the word sorry yeah no i i think\nthat's huge because what you said is\nover time what we're\nbasically saying is we don't think we\ndeserve that yes or that what we're\ndoing is wrong yes right that's what\nyou're saying if you're saying sorry\nlike you define the word you're like\nsaying i'm wrong that's why i'm sorry\ni'm wrong in not wanting to come out\nwith you\nyou're not wrong yeah you just want to\ndo something that's right for you yeah\nright and it just then reinforces right\nbecause like\nlike repetition creates a habit and i'm\nso aware of that of how the words i use\num affect how i show up so like if can i\nshare a story yeah i'd love to you're\nyou're an amazing storyteller so i\nalways love hearing you said yeah go for\nit there was this one time on one\nvacation and i'm standing in line and i\nmet you i get very chatty in line on\nvacation\ni would love to be in line with your\nvacation yeah so this is women behind\nwhen we start chatting she's like oh\nwhat do you do so i start telling all\nthe things you know that you know quest\nand impact theory and women of impact\nand eventually i was like okay i'm\ntalking a lot it's like oh what do you\ndo oh i'm just a mom\njust a mom just i was and i was like\nwell what do you mean she goes oh we'll\nhave three kids i homeschool but i'm\njust a mom\nshe was so downplaying her achievements\nby using the word just\nnow it may not seem like a big deal but\nimagine she says that to herself over\nand over again\nshe's really invalidating how much she's\nbringing to the table\nand so in that moment i almost couldn't\nhelp myself jay i was like i'm so sorry\nbut you just said just i was like what\nyou're doing is incredible i was like\nyou're bringing up the next generation\nand you're doing it three two and\nhomeschooling i was like so i was like\nthat isn't a just as soon as i said that\nher demeanor changed\nshe starts glowing talking about all the\nclasses all these new tests that she was\ntrying on her kids to see what would\nwork and what didn't\nin just in removing the word just\nchanged how she saw herself and that was\njust one word in one moment now think\nabout the words we use in our own head\nover and over and over again yeah i and\nand i think that's the point that in\nthat moment you'd only heard her say it\nonce yes but she's heard herself say it\nevery day where whenever she meets\nsomeone who is externally\ndoing more\nright more quiet more externally\nquote-unquote more quote-unquote because\nit's her perception\nshe is then looking at herself as less\nthan every single time\nbecause society has made some things\nfeel like more and some things feel like\nless but in that moment you've reminded\nher that actually what she's doing is\nunique it's beautiful it's wonderful and\ni think\nthat's what i love about what you're\nsaying about language because\ni do think it's so easy\nbecause we've created this hierarchy of\nfirst and second you think about it\nsomeone might have just broken the world\nrecord\nand come second\nbut someone broke the overall world\nrecord and came first yeah right you\nboth may have beaten the most latest\nworld record but except you're not\nlooking at it you're looking going i\ncame second but you also just did\nsomething amazing and even in that\nexample whereas\nyeah i think it's i think language is\nreally interesting and i think the way\nwe talk to ourselves is really\ninteresting and i do believe that it's\nalways going to be a balance\nof\nyou don't want to\nlie to yourself either way and i think\nthat's the problem\nright both of them are lies saying to\nyourself i'm the best in the world and\ni'm better than everyone that's a lie\nand saying i'm the worst i'm just a mum\nthat's also a lie neither of those are\nactually true yeah that's so true and\nwe are so conditioned ourselves into\nthinking a certain way that it becomes\nlike the belief system that maybe we\ndon't even question because we don't\neven realize it's there and so that's\nwhat i just love about everything we're\ntalking about i mean you know is it\ncarol dweck i think it was her that said\njust add the word yet onto a sentence i\ncan't do x y and z yet it's one word\nthree letters and yet it changes\neverything of how we perceive that thing\nif you say i can't play the piano\nor i can't play the piano yet night and\nday yeah changes everything everything\nlanguage changes everything i i do\nrecommend that everyone sits down and\ndefines the words they use the most\nin their life because and chances are\nyou and your partner you and your kids\nyou and your parents all have different\ndefinitions\nand so you've got to be really careful\nbecause you may have defined your words\nyou got to make sure that their words\nare aligned or that they have their own\ndefinition that you're aware of yeah\nbecause otherwise when they say well\ni don't think you've done something\nsignificant\nyou have to know what you mean by\nsignificant others you're going to take\nthat personally so i rarely take\npeople's words personally because i know\ntheir definition is not the same as mine\noh my god yeah tom and i in our marriage\nwe have our own little like blue\ndictionary because for that exact reason\nbecause if i say to him hey babe this is\nreally important to me i say the word\nimportant three times in a year so you\nbetter believe i want his all attention\ni want him to drop everything now if we\nhaven't had that discussion and he uses\nthe important four times in a day he\ngoes okay cool and now i feel completely\ndismissed because i only use it three\ntimes so there's a weight that i bring\nto that word but he doesn't now does\nthat mean that he's wrong and i'm right\nno it just means to your point that we\nhave different definitions of what that\nword specifically means so like the one\nof the worst words i think it does\ndetriment to so many people especially\nwomen is the word should that like is\nthe word that\nliterally is like handcuffs so many of\nus i should do this i should be a good\nwife i should be a good greek wife i\nshould take care of my husband i should\nput his you know that was what i was\ntaught i should have kids like it didn't\neven dawn on me that i could ask why do\ni want kids\nbecause i just used the word in my head\nover and over again so powerful and you\ncan make so many big decisions in life\nwith bad language yeah and it's it's\nscary actually where it can go and\nif you're someone who feels you have\ndone that for a long time you can change\nwords that's the best thing about it you\ncan change your definitions you can\nchange your words all right one more\nthat i want to take\nuh that i love\nbecause this one really really stood out\nto me\nis i can be too sensitive\ni think that's one that gives a lot of\npermission because you're a very\npractical person i watch your instagram\nstories and you're always someone who\nshares what you're feeling but then you\nshare what you do about it yeah and so\ni'll see you go i woke up i didn't want\nto work out today but here i am or like\nyou know i woke up my gut wasn't great\ntoday but then this is what we did like\nyou're very open about\nthe feeling and being sensitive but then\nmoving\nhow did you get good at closing the gap\nbetween allowing yourself to feel and\nbeing sensitive to actually taking\naction i think because i didn't do i\ndidn't move forward i literally for\neight years you know my life was what i\nfeel like was in the purge i can't\nbelieve you like that i can't even\nimagine you like that because i've never\nwe never knew each other though yeah\nwe're saying that i feel the same about\nyou when i hear about your your crazy\nworld boys stories when you're young i'm\nlike you\nlike it just seems strange but that just\nactually is great right to show that we\nreally can evolve we really can change\nby making these different choices in our\nlives and so for eight years i was\nmaking the same choices to stay stuck\nand so\ni didn't have that how do i\nincrementally move towards my goal how\nwhat am i doing today and so now i've\njust because of that i just say the way\nthat i feel right now does it serve the\nthing that i'm trying to do\nand so sometimes like being sensitive\ncan be beautiful right it means that\nwe're in touch with our emotions and\nthat we can actually feel things and\nespecially when you're creative you want\nthat you need to like go with your heart\nand your emotions\nbut sometimes being too sensitive can\nhold you back yeah and i don't beat\nmyself up over it but i don't think\nbeing too sensitive all the time serves\nyou\nand\npart of the messaging out there is like\nno you should be always sensitive and i\njust go look sometimes it actually\ndoesn't serve what you're trying to do\nthat doesn't mean that you should ignore\nit that doesn't mean that you should\nbeat yourself up over feeling it but if\ni say okay the way i'm feeling right now\ndoesn't actually help me move forward\ntowards impacting that 14 year old girl\nokay so what am i gonna do i'm gonna\nfill the fills right i give myself the\ngrace and the cuddle to go okay lisa yes\nyou're here that's okay it's like you\nknow that friend it's all right but does\nthis actually help you help that 14 year\nold girl that feels insecure does that\nhelp that other woman that you're trying\nto help if the answer is no what am i\ngoing to do about it because sitting\nthere stuck won't get me there again\ni've been there eight years not moving\nforward i know what that feels like i\nknow where that gets me it's important\nfor me to acknowledge the truth\nthat we can be sensitive and to just say\nit's okay all the time won't actually\nhelp and so that's where it's like the\nduality of\neverything i always talk about becomes\nlike these dualities it's like\nembracing it and then not accepting it\nit's like i embrace who i am today and\nyeah i don't accept who i am today i\nknow where i'm trying i want to get\nbetter every day i want to improve so\nhow do you do both without um you know\nlacking the enthusiasm to keep moving\nforward and it always is giving myself\nthe grace that yes i feel like that i'm\nnot going to dismiss that part of me\nthat is what makes me me\nand yet i'm not going to let it hold me\nback from the life i want i love that i\nthink you've perfectly summed up\nhow\na healthy mindset can be where it's not\neither or it's and\nright it's both and i think everyone's\nalways like well should you be really\nvulnerable or should you be really like\naction-oriented and it's like be both\nyeah like be vulnerable and then take\naction like should i be really sensitive\nand compassionate or should i be really\nbrave and courageous it's like be both\nit's like\nshould i be affectionate or assertive\nit's like be affectionately assertive\nlike\nbe both like you don't and and i think\nwe've just been brought to believe that\neverything's either raw\nand what you've just said is no i can be\nboth i can embrace myself\nand i don't have to accept where i'm at\ncan i add more lyrics i think so also\nis your sensitivity actually\nwarranted now what i mean by that is i\nstill accept it so i never dismiss it\nbut i don't know if it's always\nwarranted have you ever been hungry oh a\nload yeah yeah so literally just by not\neating you get mad yeah so think about\nsensitivity it's the same thing maybe\nyou're really tired that day maybe you\nhaven't eaten for me the biggest\nrealization with this whole topic was\nmiddle of my gut issues i was in\nabsolute pain i wasn't eating much like\ni could barely eat so i was extremely\nmalnutritioned like i was 20 pounds\nlighter and so now i'm in this business\nmeeting we're at quest i'm sitting in\nfront of tom and there's like maybe 10\nother people and me and him start\ndebating something now this is like i've\ndebated with him so many times up to\nthis point but because my gut was\nhurting me so much because i couldn't\neat and because i was tired he had said\nsomething and inside i wanted to burst\ninto tears and so i was like you're not\ngoing to cry lisa you're not going to\ncry meeting goes over and i go into his\nhis restroom and i just start tearing up\nand he walks in thinking that i was like\nhad a bad stomach and he sees me in\ntears first time i'm crying at work a\nquest so he's really shocked he's like\nhey what's wrong and i was like you were\nso mean to me\nand he's like what is happening right\nnow i've never said that especially at\nwork and he's like\nbabe i love you could this possibly be\nbecause of your health and of course i\nwas sensitive so i was like don't you\ndismiss my feelings you know and he's\nlike i'm not trying to dismiss your\nfeelings but let's just take things\nright now\nfor how they are you've never cried at\nwork you've never made it personal never\nbut even by saying you're mean to me\nis a personal thing\nhow many times have we debated at work\nyou've never had this emotional reaction\nand the facts are babe you're in pain\nso can we maybe just say that right now\nyou are being sensitive\nthat you may not otherwise feel if your\nhealth was better yeah\nand so in that moment i was like\nactually you know what sometimes your\nsensitivity comes from something else\ntotally but you take it personally oh\nyou i mean you're spot on i mean i\ngenuinely don't trust myself if i'm\nhungry on time right like i just don't\nmake good decisions i don't make\ndecisions i don't make choices i will\nput something off if i'm hungry or i'm\ntired i will say i'll think about it\ntomorrow i just don't want to make that\ndecision because i know i'll make poor\ndecisions let alone with our feelings\nyeah and how we treat people yeah and i\ncan remember that actually when i was\ngoing through health things as well\ni was a lot snappier i was a lot more\nirritable\nyou were a little too sensitive yeah\nexactly yeah i would rather i was way\nmore agitated when i was struggling\nbecause you're really what's happening\nis all your body's energy\nis trying to solve that issue\nand so you have no energy you don't have\nany capacity left\nfor\nthe part that you would usually have a\nlittle bit of resilience to deal with\nsomething that's not comfortable exactly\nand now everything that would have just\nbeen uncomfortable becomes personal yes\nand that's what's happening right\nbecause you've lost that capacity for\ndiscomfort yes and i've realized that\nmany times when i'm tired or i'm hungry\nor i'm going through something\nhealth-wise i lose my ability for\ndiscomfort when usually i'd be more than\nhappy to be in discomfort or handle some\nausterity and the fact that you know\nthat about yourself you know allows you\nnow to maneuver yeah but it's not that\nyou dismiss that you're a bad person or\nthat means something about you you just\nknow oh okay i'm not in my full capacity\nbecause i'm not i don't have the things\ni need in order to be able to handle\nthis and not take it personally yeah so\nthat's where in the books like it's so\nimportant for me to say like look\ninstead like we don't no i'm sensitive\nand you can't take that away from me\nit's like yes but does it serve you and\nis it actually true or is it a\nreflection of other things in your life\ni love that i love that lisa that's such\na powerful and i want everyone who knows\nlistening and watching that this book is\nfull\nof what i think lisa does really well is\ntake on these really complex ideas\nsimplify them but then still deal with\nthe complexity right as you can hear\nwe're going back and forth on this stuff\nbecause it's not either raw it's not one\nor the other it's not like here's the\none answer that's going to solve\neverything it's actually like really\ntextured and layered and messy and\nyou've got to think about it at that\nlevel if you really want to solve it\nbecause just going out there and saying\njust be sensitive just share your\nfeelings like that's only one half of\nthe issue yeah and and then there's all\nthese other layers in between and so i\nthink what lisa does in radical\nconfidence is each of these 10 lessons\nthey're going to simply tell you what to\ndo next but they're also going to help\nyou think about how these ideas and as\nshe said at the beginning the muscle\nbuilds over time uh lisa thank you for\nwriting this book\num i again recommend everyone goes and\ngrabs a copy um you won't be\ndisappointed i genuinely\nhave always loved lisa's storytelling\nability you saw it today she's able to\ntake you back into a moment in time uh\nhelp you to reconnect with that 14 year\nold girl that she was to reconnect with\nthe housewife she was for eight years\nyou know all of those elements in her\nlife which i think are identities that\nwe can all relate to at different times\nin our own life uh lisa any last words\nanything that's on your mind anything\nthat's in your heart that you really\nwant to share i want to give you the\nspace to say it no just thank you so\nmuch for having me and you know you've\nreally been witness as well to kind of\nme going from behind the scenes you know\nin front and braddy's been doing the\nsame like it's so beautiful\nto see like how much you support\nso many women in your life you know in\nyour life so um thank you for being a\npart of my own journey and being such a\ngood friend and you know my brother from\nanother mother you feel like home dude\nand i just cannot thank you enough for\nhaving me i'm so proud of you for\nputting this together because i just\nthink there's so many people out there\nwho are struggling with these exact\nquestions these exact challenges uh some\nof the ones that i didn't take for\nanyone who's listening because i think\num you know you'll resonate with these\nones just people can relate to this how\ncan you develop the mindset to i can set\nboundaries i can choose how i react i\ncan rescue myself i can be motivated i\ncan boost my confidence i mean these are\nall things that\nwe all wish we could do\nand i love how the book\nnot only talks about the ideas in the\nway you'd expect but i think you take\nthis really counter-intuitive approach\nto giving more depth on each one because\ni think that was actually the thing that\nheld me back is i would read all these\none things about and i was like but that\nisn't really true to me how you show up\nand i think humans are very you said it\nearlier humans are complex women were\nvery complex and so it's not binary it's\nnot one or the other it's how do you\ndeal with the beauty that makes up you\nyeah absolutely everyone make sure you\nsubscribe to women of impact make sure\nyou follow lisa on instagram make sure\nyou go and grab a copy\nof the book you won't be disappointed i\npromise and please do tag me and lisa on\nany social media platform that you use\nletting us know what stood out to you\nwhat connected with you maybe you're\ngoing to take a picture of a page in the\nbook that really resonated with you that\nspoke to you highlight it share it with\nus online i genuinely love to see the\nfeedback and as you know i do deeply\ndeeply deeply support my friends or\nauthors on this podcast because writing\na book is just not easy when someone's\npromoting it and there's lots of cool\nposters and tv shows and billboards and\nall this kind of stuff it can look very\nexciting and it is exciting but the\njourney of writing a book\ngetting it right printing it getting it\nsorted and then taking out there it's a\nmarathon so if you ever see me\nshare\nabout books very enthusiastically it\ncomes from just knowing that the\nauthor's really been through it to get\nto that stage so that's where my\noverenthusiasm kicks in but thank you so\nmuch for listening and watching everyone\na big thanks to lisa for joining us\ntoday sending you lots of love make sure\nyou pass this on to someone who needs it\nand i'll see you next time on on purpose\nthanks
