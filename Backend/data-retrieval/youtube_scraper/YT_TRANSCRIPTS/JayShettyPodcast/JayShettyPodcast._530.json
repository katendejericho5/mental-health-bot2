difference today\ni'm speaking to two incredible guests\ngary white and matt damon who are\nco-founders of water.org and water\nequity while everyone knows matt as an\nactor and producer and screenwriter in\n2006 he founded h20 africa foundation to\nraise awareness about water initiatives\non the continent matt's active\nparticipation in the work of wateror.org\nand water equity has

in\ncreating and executing market-driven\nsolutions to the global water crisis\ndriving innovations in the way water and\nsanitation projects are delivered and\nfinanced welcome to on purpose matt\ndamon and gary white matt and gary thank\nyou so much for being here and i know\ntoday we're talking about your book the\nworth of water our story of chasing\nsolutions to the world's greatest\nchallenge i highly recommend everyone\ngoes and grabs a copy of the book while\nyou're listening or watching uh but we\nwill be diving into that and discussing\nit gary and matt thank you for being\nhere it's so good to see you\ngood to see you thank you for sharing\nyour incredible platform with us too\nthat's really awesome we appreciate it\nfor sure thanks jay\nno thank you for doing the work uh you\nknow i i spent three years\nliving as a monk in india after business\nschool and a lot of the work we did was\naround building sustainable villages and\na big part of that was making sure that\nclean water reached those places so i\nhave a personal affinity to the work\nthat you're doing and so when this came\nacross my desk i was i was to be honest\njust super enthusiastic and excited to\ntalk about it i'd love to start off from\nboth of you\nuh individually telling me about\nwhat is the water crisis and water issue\nright now for those who are unaware or\nthose that have kind of seen it but\nkind of think oh yeah like isn't aren't\nthere a lot of people dealing with that\nand you know it's kind of been talked\nabout for a while i'd love to hear from\nboth of your perspectives personally as\nto what you believe the issue is right\nnow\nwell if i can go and jump in if that's\nright uh\nit's it's so complex it's kind of hard\nto distill it but i'll give it a shot i\nthink\nthat the for us we tend to think of the\nwater crisis as something that's looming\nwe know that uh you know with climate\nchange water resources are getting more\nscarce\nand that is a looming crisis and it is\nimportant we should be focused on that\nbut for 771 million people around the\nworld today\nthe crisis is already upon them right\nthey're the ones that when they woke up\nthis morning they didn't necessarily\nknow where they were going to get water\nfor the day\nthey didn't know how much time they were\ngoing to have to spend walking to\ncollect that water or sometimes they\nhave to buy it from these these urban\nslum vendors who sell it for prices that\nare 10 to 15 times more than what they\nwould pay if they had a water connection\nso\nto them the water crisis is a daily\nstruggle to\nmake sure that they have enough water\nin order to kind of live the day and\nthen when you're struggling day to day\nlike that that water crisis becomes like\na family health crisis it becomes an\neducation crisis it becomes you know\nlack of employment crisis because you're\nfocused so much on getting water or\npaying for water that you're not in\nschool you're not healthy and so it is\nbasically something that's right now\nrobbing hundreds of millions of people\nof their futures because until you have\nwater nothing else matters\nthank you for that gary i really\nappreciate that and the main thing that\ni'm hearing there is just we think of\npeople just not having water to drink\nand then it's almost like well wait a\nminute let's think about\nthe act of getting water and what that\ntakes away time from i.e their economic\nspace their home space their family the\ncooking the the feeding the you know\neverything that it expands out to so\nthank you for that matt i want to extend\nthe same question to you as well i'd\nlove to hear about for you personally\nwhat what you see is the issue so well i\nthink gary just did a pretty good\nsummary there but uh to follow on to\nthat i would just say that the effect of\nof that right leaving aside the\nthe needless disease and death right\nthat occurs when you don't have access\nto clean water and sanitation um you\nknow because we're losing a\nmillion children under the age of five\nyou know to come every year to\ncompletely preventable\nillness right and and\nand so that's its own tragedy right but\nbut when you look at\nthe other effects of not having access\nnamely uh you know\nbecause this disproportionately affects\nwomen and girls uh so many girls aren't\nin school because they they have to for\nthe sake of their survival of their\nfamilies\nbe out looking for water every day and\nso and so you can imagine what that does\nto the to the outcomes of their of their\nlives and to their potential so it's not\nonly this this needless disease and\nsuffering it's it's also robbing people\nof their potential in ways that are\nreally incalculable um and that was the\nvery first water collection i went on\num this is 15\n16 years ago and i i was in zambia in\nthis really rural village and and i was\nit had been arranged for me to meet this\ngirl when she got home from school and\nwe walked together to this well and and\nand i talked to her was about a mile\naway\nand in the course of our conversation\ni i said you know i said are you going\nto live here\nfor the rest of your life is this where\nyou want to live and she got really shy\nand she goes no no i don't want to live\nhere i want to go to the big city we're\nin this really rural area she goes i\nwant to go to lusaka i want to be a\nnurse\nright and and i totally\njust connected to her because i i\nremembered being 14 and i was going to\ngo to the big city with ben affleck and\nwe were going to be actors we were going\nto new york and and\nand that's like what a 14 year old\nshould be thinking about right they\nshould be dreaming about their futures\nand\nand the possibility that awaited them\nand it wasn't until i got in the car and\nwas driving away that i realized had it\nnot been for the foresight of someone to\nsink a borwell a mile from this kid's\nhouse she wouldn't have been in school\nyou know she wouldn't she wouldn't dream\nof someday being a nurse and and\ncontributing to the economic engine of\nher country and and and helping people\nyou know being a frontline healthcare\nworker you know all the things that\nand living her dream really right and so\nand so\nthat was kind of\nan epiphany for me and and and just the\nfar-reaching effect of lack of access\nbecause i really found that it\nunderpinned\neverything it undergirds every issue of\nextreme poverty it touches all of them\nand so the the fact that nobody was\nreally talking about it um and it was\nthis vastly interesting and complex\nthing massive problem uh that that was\nthat was what first got me really\ninterested yeah\nthat's beautiful thank you so much for\nsharing that and i think there was a\nline in the book that really struck me\nand you said that for that girl water\nwas life\nand it was also a shot at a better life\nand and when you make that comparison of\nwhat you were thinking about at 14\nwhat she's thinking about at 14 now i'm\nthinking about what i was thinking about\nat 14 and i would encourage our\nlisteners and viewers right now and gary\ni'm sure you've thought about this many\ntimes but i'd like everyone who's\nlistening and watching to think what\nwere you thinking about at 14 what was\nyour choice that you were having to make\nand you just realized how far off it is\nfrom someone who doesn't have access to\nwater and clean water\nand that just makes you stop pause and\nthink and go wow like i may think i may\nnot have this opportunity or i may not\nhave enough money to move to a city but\nit's like here we're talking about not\neven having water and clean water to\nhave access to let alone all those\nchoices\none thing that comes to mind and i want\nto hear this from both of you because\nyou know this has been work that you've\nbeen doing for a number of years this is\nnot something that\nyou know both of you just got involved\nwith and you know it's it's it's your\nlife's work it's it's it's something\nyou're truly passionate about\nwhen you first saw the pain for both of\nyou when you first when i hear those\nnumbers 771 million people is that right\nit was that did i get that number right\ngary like 771 million people you know\ndon't have access uh to clean water when\ni'm hearing matt's you shared the\nstatistic just right now we're losing a\nmillion children yeah\nuh when i'm hearing those numbers they\nare so high right they're astronomical i\nhear a lot of people when they're\nexposed to that much pain our natural\ninclination is to feel like we can't do\nanything and our natural inclination is\nto feel a bit helpless\nto feel sad to feel disheartened\nuh we we feel like our empathy takes\nover and we go\nwell what can i do\nwhen you first saw that what gave both\nof you\nthe feeling a that you had to do\nsomething but be that what you do could\nmake a difference let's start there and\nthen i'll follow up with another\nquestion let's start there and gary you\ncan go first again for us i came at it\nfrom\na kind of an almost analytical\nperspective\nafter i had that emotional response to\nit right so when i was in guatemala as\nan undergraduate you know in university\ndoing a volunteer project there just\nseeing this girl\nuh\ngoing collecting this filthy water out\nof a drum you know in the slums and\nwalking back through this sewage-filled\nlane\nthat that to me\nwas one person right and then coming\nback and then learning that this was the\nstory for hundreds of millions of people\nuh\ni didn't get discouraged i just like\ncould see that one person and it's like\nokay if we can just kind of tackle this\nyou know even one person at a time that\nwas kind of the idealistic view of it\nand and so to me\nwhat's been important about this journey\nthat we kind of chronicle in the in the\nbook is that you know you have to have\nthat end goal in mind and that can be\ndaunting to see that you know our vision\nis that everyone in our lifetime you\nknow has access to safe water\nand\nthe\nthe challenge then becomes to match the\nscale of the solution to the scale of\nthe problem right and i knew that\nphilanthropy alone wasn't going to be\nthat solution philanthropy has a role to\nplay but it was only by traveling and\nmeeting women who are in these\ncircumstances i met a woman in in india\nwho had gone to a loan shark and was\npaying 150 interest to that loan shark\njust so she could build the toilet that\nshe wanted other people who were doing\nthis to you know taking out loans for\nwater connections at exorbitant rates\nand then using those insights and saying\nwell what if you know we could turn the\nproblem around and look at like getting\nthese people access to these small loans\nwhat we now call water credit that would\nthen unleash them to get the solutions\nthat they wanted so i'm getting a bit\nahead of myself here but my point is\nthat\nyou just have to take the problem a step\nat a time and find a solution that's\nthere\nevolve it get the insights and move on\nand that is the the journey and i think\nthat's one of those kind of the sub\nplots i guess of the book\nis that any of these seemingly\nintractable\nbig social problems\ndo have solutions if you're tenacious if\nyou innovate and and you work hard at it\nyou you believe that we can get there\nyeah that's i would just say it's\ninteresting because because i had the\nexact same kind of\nreaction that gary did which was to say\nokay well\ni'm this is a this is a complex issue\nand i don't understand it entirely\nbut i know that if i raise money if i\ncreate an organization and raise money\nand and start start\ndoing this direct impact work building\nwells right i've seen the power of one\nwell\nso\nif it if it if a thousand people have\naccess to that one well then i've helped\na thousand people so why don't i start\nthere why don't i just start moving\nforward why don't i start as gary said\nyou know take that first step i don't\nknow where the road is going but i know\ni'm not getting there if i don't start\nwalking and so so that was what and so i\ni did i'm sure incredibly naive things\nand i didn't you know\nand and gary you know when we met in in\n2008 gary you know we talked about in\nthe book gary led with all of his\nfailures right which was an incredible\nattractive thing incredibly attractive\nthing to me because i think that is how\nyou know\nwe can't be afraid of failure we can't\nbe afraid of you know uh that can't stop\nour momentum right and it's how we learn\nand it's how we grow\num and and and so i\ni knew that i had to partner with\nsomebody who had a more sophisticated\nunderstanding of of of this issue and\nand i looked around for the\nthe best person available and uh\nand when they would not take my call i\nfound gary\nno i and and and that was really the the\none thing that i did in this all of this\nwork that was really\ni'm i'm really happy that i did that it\nwas it was really one of the smartest\nchoices i've ever made in my life and uh\nbecause of this uh water credit that\ngary's talking about which was this idea\nthat that came from his experience and\nhis lifetime of experience of being in\nthese communities and talking to people\nand understanding what life was like he\nalso understood that people in the\npoorest communities were paying for\nwater they were already paying for it\nand in most cases paying way more than\nthe middle class way more than the\npeople staying in the fancy hotels um\nyou know who take it totally for granted\nthey they weren't connected to the\ninfrastructure and as a result their\nlife was built around\ntrying to get it and uh\nand and so that insight led him to this\nhypothesis that these loans could\nactually be paid back quite easily and\nthat's what you know 43.7 million people\nlater\num you know these loans have paid back\nat over 99\nso it's really the book is really us\ntrying to bring the story of these women\nbecause you know you know\nover 90 of our borrowers are women um\nand\nthis kind of\nincredibly heroic women like an\nindividual with you know one by one by\none you know to the tune of millions and\nmillions of them have paid these loans\nback at at over 99 and it's just a it's\na beautiful story and it's and it's\nabout\nphilosophically how we feel about about\ntrying to help it's not a kind of\npaternalistic here's your solution\nyou're welcome it's like it's going into\nthe communities and and and and\nlistening and and and then ultimately\nnudging a market towards people and\nletting them solve their own problems\nand that's what we've seen happen now\nover 43 million times and that's really\ncool\nyeah that's that's an incredible impact\nand and i love the way you're thinking\nabout it and the idea that there isn't\njust a one-size-fits-all solution it's\nnot about throwing money at it it's\nactually giving people the tools and the\nskills and the abilities as you've\nrightly said to solve their own\nchallenges so that they feel empowered\nin the process rather than dependent\nagain\non on another outside source in another\nway i mean can you expand more for those\nwho don't know\nuh\nhow the lack of access to water impacts\ngirls and women's more than boys and men\nand and when you uncovered that just\ntell us some of the reasons because i\ndon't know if everyone knows why or or\nhow that exists uh as a discrepancy but\nalso tell us some of the stories of some\nof the women that you've worked with as\nwell\nwomen and girls have been the ones and\nfamilies that have been charged with\ncollecting the water for their\nhouseholds almost universally around the\nworld so they obviously have the\ngreatest stake in this and the greatest\nstake in trying to find a solution and\nthe greatest stake in ensuring that that\nsolution uh is sustainable and that to\nus you know\nis\nlike an insight that's an observation so\nit's like well let's\nwhere how are we going to shape our\nsolutions to to meet their needs and\nthat's why you know more than 85 percent\nof the borrowers uh under our water\ncredit program are women and so they're\nthe ones that are repaying these loans\nat a 99 rate uh and they are the ones\nthat have even more incentive to make\nsure that if something breaks down that\nit gets repaired and i think that's one\nof the\nthe beauties of of water credit as well\nbecause oftentimes water projects do\nbreak down you know some of the\nstatistics are that about half of the\nwater projects fail after five years\nand if you have access to an ecosystem\nof finance for water and sanitation not\njust a one and done grant but you can\naccess a micro loan to go get the the\nyou know solution that you need to fix\nyou know your your your water tap or\nwhatever that is an important part of\nthe whole model and giving people you\nknow we talk about you know not\nnecessarily seeing people living in\npoverty as a charity problem to be\nsolved as much as a market to be served\nand in order to kind of make the market\nwork we have to kind of nudge it towards\nthe poor which is what we do with with\nwater.org to help you know get\nmicrofinance institutions that we\npartner with around the world the to\nde-risk this for them because it's a new\nthing to loan for water and toilets and\nthey're not quite sure how it works so\nwe can use our philanthropic capital to\nkind of help them do market research to\ndesign these loan products so that they\ncan go out and make these 43 million\nloans that have happened so far and that\nis is kind of the concept and you know\none way to just boil it down to the\nstory right\na woman i met in the philippines\nrecently her name was lynn ariza\nand uh\nshe was paying 60 a month to a water\nvendor who was selling water off the\nback of a truck not even good quality\nwater and she took out a loan from one\nof our partners and her loan repayment\nuh her payment each month is five\ndollars her water bill each month is\nfive dollars so right there you see\nfifty dollars uh back in her pocket i\nmean think about you know when you're\nliving in poverty fifty dollars is is a\nlot of money you can now work to get\nyour kids into school you know you can\nnow afford the medicines that you might\nneed for your for your family you can\ninvest in your future and build a future\nand i think that's what we're trying to\nto help people unlock and that's whose\nstories you know we're fortunate to be\nable to tell in the book\nyeah gary that what i find fascinating\nthere uh matt just before we come to you\nthat\nhow if those obviously those water\nvendors who are not selling the the\nclean water or the best one they've\nbuilt up a certain level of\nauthority and control in these markets\nand\nlike how is that this is that being\ndismantled as well by you doing this\nwork like where are those people like\nkind of because i feel like that\nis so difficult obviously if you're not\nif you haven't traveled to these\ncountries it's hard for people to\nunderstand how that even works um but\nbut that kind of like\nauthority influence and power and\ncontrol\nhow are they reacting to the dismantling\nof their economies because i'm sure that\nthere's you know conflict or pain back\nfrom that side like how does that all\nwork sorry if it's an ignorant question\nbut it's just\nno no not at all and i think that i\nguess one thing to understand is that\neven they are not\nmaking a fortune off of this system\nright it's uh it's just really expensive\nto find water to put it in a truck to\nbuy the diesel to drive the truck around\nand distribute it i mean the efficiency\nof that versus doing it through a pipe\nis is incredible right so it's no\nsurprise that they have to charge those\namounts uh and so\nyes there's going to be dislocations\nthere with with some of these vendors\nbut we haven't seen that crop up as a\nproblem you know it happens\nincrementally you know everybody in the\nworld is used to kind of having to\nreinvent themselves and so i think that\nyou know they they might go on to other\nbusinesses uh and and you you have\ntanker truck water that's needed for\nconstruction sites still so they can\nkind of adjust to to those types of\nmarkets got it that makes sense and matt\nwhat about you was there a particular\nstory of i mean there's plenty in the\nbook but if there's someone that comes\nto mind right now where\nyou know you you saw women being more\nnegatively affected by this uh than men\nobviously we got the answer of why from\ngary but is there a particular story\nthat stands out or an experience in that\ndirection about 11 years ago we were in\nhaiti and and at a uh\num we we kind of were there for the kind\nof the christening of this new water\nsystem in this small village and it was\na real celebration and and amidst this\ncelebration i was introduced to a little\ngirl who was 13\nand and\nyou know she and i got her story and her\nstory was that she spent three to four\nhours every day\ncollecting water and she was very lucky\nbecause that was she could still be in\nschool but after school every day she\nwent and she collected water it took her\nthree or four hours to get water for her\nfamily so i say to this kid i'm like\nwell hey you know i kind of joke and say\nnow you have more time for homework\nright\nand she looks at me totally seriously\nand she's like i don't need more time to\ndo homework i'm the smartest kid in my\nclass\nand the way she said it i knew she was\ntelling me the truth i was like oh i\nremember being 13 and like i remember\nyou and my class you are the smartest\nperson\nand uh and i said all right well so what\nare you gonna do with all this time that\nyou just\nfound you know your your newfound four\nhours a day and she looked at me and she\ngoes i'm gonna play\nwow yeah and i just and it but it like\nbuckled me you know i\nbecause at the time my my oldest\ndaughter was 13\nand you know so again i felt that\nconnection to this\nkid and like what else should a 13 year\nold girl be thinking about you know she\nshould be thinking about playing and\nthat's you know again another one of\nthose incalculable ways in which\nthis is so pernicious right it just robs\npeople of you know in this case it robs\nchildren of their childhoods you know\nthey're in there and then their\npotential the potential of their\nadulthood so\num so so yeah it's things like that and\nit's good for us you know we go out\nabout uh once a year i i i go once a\nyear gary goes a little quite a lot more\noften but um\nto to kind of go to these do these field\nvisits and kind of connect to people and\ntalk and it's just because as these\nnumbers are accelerating and we're and\nwe're kind of going from strength to\nstrength with our with our with our work\nwhich is really exciting\nit's it's important to to kind of keep\nand you know keep\nremind ourselves of of of what it means\nbecause it becomes numbers 43.7 million\npeople i mean what a number\nbut you know i'm i'm still thinking\nabout a girl i met 12 years ago you know\nand and so there are a lot there's so\nmany millions of these people that will\nnever meet but um but all of the stories\nare are like that you know and\nthis is all about positive\nuh change\nyeah absolutely as a follow-up to that\nmatt how's how is your work\nwith those people affected your daughter\ntoo because i'm intrigued as to how\nyou know for her seeing her father you\nknow be so service focused and\nyou know giving energy to this like have\nyou taken have you and gary too have you\ntaken your kids out like you know have\nyou taken other children out and young\npeople out i'm just fascinated to hear\nhow it feels when you're looking at\nsomeone your age uh as opposed to both\nof you obviously as older men looking at\nyounger people but like to have people\nlooking at people their own age who have\nthis mindset i would love to hear some\nstories in that regard i i talk about in\nthe book my mom and and and how she took\nme as a teenager\nto um places where i witnessed extreme\npoverty and it was\nyou know and she didn't do any finger\nwagging at me or lecturing she just let\nme absorb it and and it really impacted\nme and so my my kids are what my our\noldest is 23 and so she's out of the\nnest and then we've got a 15 a 13 and 11\nyear old and so i've taken the 23 year\nold and and uh and i've taken uh our 15\nyear old we we took her on a trip to the\nphilippines a few years ago so she might\nhave been 13 at the time um\nyou know it's it's kind of eat different\nwith each kid you kind of see why at\nwhat age can you\nis this going to be\nposi a positive\nyou know it's it's just going to\ninfluence you positively and and\nso i took my my\nmy daughter and and her best friend on\non on a trip and it was and it was great\nand it's\nyou know\nletting them absorb you know with the\nkind of privilege that they have and\nthey come from and that you know this is\nall about where you're born and you're\nborn into a family you don't have any\nyou know say over it and uh\nand and and letting them try to put\ntheir let them try to put their lives in\nsome context which is how i felt that\nwhat i felt happened to me\nwhen when i when i when my mother\nintroduced me to\na larger world\nsuddenly\nmy life started to make more sense right\nand i and\nyou know we're all trapped in these\nsubjective realities and and limited by\nthem in some way but i feel like travel\nand experience like this is kind of the\ngreatest gift because it it helps at\nleast to try to open us up yeah i think\nthat's beautiful what you said about\ngauging when it's right for the\nindividual because every you know\nthere's no right age for any of them to\nhave this experience but really making\nit personalized i think that makes a lot\nof sense gary how about you i'd love to\nhear your\nuh thoughts on this i had a chance to\ntake my daughter uh to uh to kenya and\nethiopia when she was about the same age\nas matt's daughter when we were in the\nphilippines and\nuh\nyeah it's it's you know\nthose types of experiences you never\nknow how they're going to reverberate\nlater you know certainly you know uh\nyou know\nhaving that experience helped shape her\ni you know she's done some great\nvolunteer work herself she's a volunteer\nteacher you know after she got out of\ncollege uh and so i think those some of\nthe echoes of what she saw there and\nexperience there and the fortune that\nshe has relative to many others in the\nworld has has cropped up and and will\ncontinue to yeah absolutely i want you\nto explain gary we've mentioned it a few\ntimes now\nuh and and of course you talk about it\ndeeply in the book for our audience i'd\nlove to for you to explain exactly in a\nsimple way how water credit works and\nthen matt i want you to talk about when\nyou actually\nyou know you had a hard time accepting\nthe idea behind water credit and then\nwhat made you change your mind to it\nbecause i think that's what i find\nfascinating about this partnership\nbetween both of you\nis that it wasn't just like this oh we\nboth love this let's get you know it\nwasn't it wasn't as simple as that\nthere's there's been a lot of planning\nthought intention behind this\npartnership between both of you and and\ni'd love to understand that so gary if\nyou can explain what it is how it works\nhow it functions we've obviously heard\nabout some of the benefits and some\nelements of how it works but i just want\npeople to have a really clear idea and\nthen matt if you could tell us about\nyour journey with how you changed your\nmind about it that would be great for\nsure i'd be happy to i think you know it\nis rooted in that concept that people\nare already paying for water right uh\nthe challenge is they don't have that\nyou know two three hundred four hundred\ndollars up front that they need to get a\nwater connection or to build a toilet at\ntheir home or to install a hand pump or\na water tank and so\nthey are struggling day to day they can\nafford you know a dollar or two a day to\nget water but they can't afford those\nthose large investments and so what we\nsaw you know we saw that people were\nstruggling with this and so it's like\nwell what if we could get microfinance\ninstitutions that are already operating\naround the world just to make loans to\nthem that would that makes complete\nsense right and then they would repay\nthe loans well we went knocking on the\ndoors of a lot of those mfis\nmicrofinance institutions and we kind of\ngot the door slammed in our face they're\nlike you guys don't understand\nmicrofinance it's about income\ngenerating loans you know we make loans\nfor sewing machines or cows because like\nby the end of the week you're generating\nrevenue because you're selling clothes\nyou're selling milk this is the way it\nworks and we're like but\nwe believe it will work because it's\ngoing to help these people work at\npaying jobs and you know that part of it\nso it's like we'll take on the risk and\nthis is why we raise philanthropic\ncapital because we need to make grants\nto a lot of these partners so that they\ncan de-risk these types of loans so that\nthey can do the market research and\nunderstand what things are good to loan\nfor what technologies are good which\nones are not to help them then launch\nlending businesses once they do then\nthey go to the capital markets and get\nthe wholesale capital then break it into\nmillions of these micro loans and so for\na woman who gets that loan literally\novernight you know she may have been\nspending three hours a day securing\nwater the day before she now has a water\ntap right at her home\nand so literally the values created\novernight for her to go out and work at\na paying job so that she can repay the\nloan and now you fast forward and you\nknow these loans uh you know 3.5 billion\ndollars in loans have gone out and\nthey're repaid at a 99 rate\nover 85 percent of the borrowers live on\nless than six dollars a day about 30\npercent live on less than two dollars a\nday and yet they keep coming forward to\ntake out these loans because it makes\nsense for them and they get the\nsolutions that they want and they don't\nfeel like a charity case anymore they\nfeel like a market as a customer that's\nbeing served and that's how the whole\nthing can work financially so that we've\nnow got the financial plumbing if you\nwill that connects the global capital\nmarkets where people can get a financial\nreturn on their investment two women\nmaking a few dollars a day\neverybody wins and we all move forward\nyeah gary thank you for that thanks for\nconnecting the dots i know we talked\nabout you know parts of that all over\nthis conversation so far but that that\nwas a really comprehensive breakdown and\ni think that really helps\nuh because there's so many facets of\nthat that i think is is new like it's\njust so new it's so alien to us\nwhich which just shows how big an issue\nit is and and how much emphasis it needs\nand and matt tell us about when you\nfirst had the idea and you were\nskeptical slightly i guess and then you\nyou obviously have come around 180. i\nwas excited about it\nas i as\nyou know as i kind of drilled down on it\nand and and really worked it over with\ngary and and thought about it but there\nthere was the aspect of it that was a\nlittle stomach turning which was wait a\nminute we're going to make people the\npoorest people on earth pay for you know\ni mean they're going to take these we're\ngoing to loan them money we're not going\nto right but but philosophically we're\nvery aligned in this idea about you know\ncharity\nquote unquote charity and and\nand and how you've like like there's a\npaternalistic aspect to it there's a\nthere's a kind of you know here's your\nsolution you're welcome\nyou know uh\nuh arrogance about it uh oftentimes and\num\nand\nand what gary's talking about is with\nthese loan programs the the dignity that\ncome with them right and it's it's it's\nthe dignity on the the side of the\nborrower but it's also uh on the side of\nthe lender kind of going i see you as a\nhuman being you're a customer you know\nwhat i mean we can do business it's a\nvery different relationship than uh\nyou're just some problem i gotta throw\nmoney at\nright and\nand so so i i got over that pretty\nquickly you know i mean my stomach just\nlike oh god market-based solutions oh no\nwhat am i doing\nbut um but when i really thought about\nit and you know it it struck me as in\ncompletely brilliant and um\nand and that's been borne out i mean we\nyou know we reached our first million\npeople in 2012\nand and now you know we're yeah we're at\n43 million we're reaching\nhowever many million a quarter now\num and it's just really accelerating and\nand that and that is illustrative of you\nknow the\nthe the demand right the demand for\nthese loans because they make sense and\num and it's not that paternalistic kind\nof charity solution that's going to be\nnot working in five years because it's\nnobody's going to take a loan out for\nsomething they don't want\nright yeah\nyeah they they know what solution they\nneed and that's what they're going to\ntake a loan out for and it's going to\nwork and that's a sustainable solution\nfor somebody and it's also\nthem solving their own problem and and\nit just took us to\nto to nudge the market towards them and\nand let them claim their own agency and\nand and solve their own problem\nwith with dignity yeah i i think that\npoint in dignity is is so powerful and\nso important i\nit's i i know exactly what you mean it\ntakes a while to get around it\nuh because you're like wait a minute are\nwe charging people for you know like how\nhow does this work but\nyeah they're going like if you're going\nacross the desert and you see somebody\nyou know thirsty you know and then you\nsell them a bottle of water like\nyou know it doesn't it doesn't feel\nright you know yeah yeah but but you're\nsaying as as you rightly said that from\na long-term perspective and from a\nsustainability perspective this person\nis now building confidence they're\nthey're building it as you said a sense\nof agency they're feeling empowered\nthey're feeling a sense of assurance\nthat they are\ngrowing through this journey as well and\nthey're able to as you said loan it for\nthings that are important to them\ntell me about this partnership for\nchange that you both have because\ni think you know i wonder whether when\nboth of you got passionate because as\nfar as i know you got passionate\nindependently and then of course\nconnected with each other about this\ncause\nwhen when you're looking for a\npartnership for change i think that can\nyou know take a lot of\ntime effort patience uh there's so many\nthings that need to align if there are\npeople in our community audience\nthinking right now like i'd love to have\nsomeone else in my life that i could\nwork with passionately about this or i\nwould love to find someone what are some\nof the things that they should look for\nmatt we obviously know gary was your\nsecond choice so\nwe'll start with what you're looking for\nin your first choice uh and gary i'm\nsure you had some other picks too so uh\nbut no i would love to know what you\nwere looking for in a partner were you\neven looking or was it just it was just\nso like oh wow i'm so grateful that i've\nbumped into someone who has this passion\nfrom both of your perspectives i'd love\nto hear how you approach this because\nmaking a change is not easy it's a long\njourney\nyou need different skill sets and\ndifferent networks and communities and\nso i often think that a lot of people\nsay oh yeah when i find someone then i\ncan do something you were both\nindependently i mean gary you started in\nyour college days right so i want to\nhear about uh how it was in the search\nof a partner the pursuit of the partner\nand then what you actually looked for\nand why it was a good fit\nwell i was looking for the expert in the\nspace and that gary's name was the name\nthat kept coming up and\num\nand and in getting to know him it was\njust clear\nwhy and and i mean he's just brilliant\nand he's i mean this water credit\ninnovation is is a really big deal\num and uh and and and he arrived at that\nthrough his through his intelligence but\nalso through his tenacity and and uh\nso i he was he was a logical partner for\nme exactly what i was looking for i i\nyou know i i\nkind of woke up in my late 20s with this\nvery bizarre\nreality of being a celebrity and and uh\nand and\nand wanted to find ways to\ndo something good with that and um\nand and i needed help you know and uh i\nwanted to be effective i didn't want to\njust it wasn't about soothing my own\nyou know ego it was about really trying\nto do something that was helpful um and\nuh and i think just in meeting gary like\nyou know we\nwe joined our organizations and he had\nhad water partners at that point for 20\nyears and instantly gave up the title of\nwater partners and for water.org and i\nthink that showed like\nthe humility the the lack of ego right\nand i think we both came at it from that\nperspective it was never about\nus or about ego it was really about how\ncan we be most effective right and that\nand we're really aligned in that way and\num and in that sense it's just the\nperfect partner for me that's beautiful\nyou you made up for it matt that was\nvery uh half out and uh no genuinely\nthat that's that's so wonderful to hear\ni i love hearing about that and\nand the quality of humility and like you\nsaid being able to put aside water\npartners and start\nsomething on the water.org that's\nfantastic gary gary your thoughts\nyeah i think uh\nyou know the the serendipity of it was\nthat's definitely a play allowing our\npaths to cross but certainly you know i\nhad been heads down on this problem and\nhad been trying to innovate and you know\nthis this whole concept of you know\ncoming at it from\nyou know initially i was very much about\nlike let's go drill wells and let's uh\nyou know raise a lot of money and give\nit away uh but quickly realized that\nthere was never going to be enough right\nand so this concept of lighting a candle\nversus cursing the darkness is kind of\nwhere where i came at it from and so\ni was trying to to find those ways to do\nthat and we you know we're catching on\nyou know water credit was was like it\nwasn't like\ngangbusters yet but we knew that we kind\nof had you know a tiger by the tail in\nterms of how this could scale\nand but you know i i'm an engineer like\ni don't what do i know about\nstorytelling what do i know about like\nmoving an audience what do i know\nabout like having a big voice in this\nbecause we're ready for that uh because\nit we you know we had a certain amount\nof humility until that point and then\nit's like now we gotta tell the story\nand then to be able to get introduced to\nand cross paths with you know an\nincredible storyteller that matt is and\nseeing that firsthand\nit just was uh you know it was one of\nthose things one plus one equals three\nfor sure uh and it seemed that way at\nfirst for both of us but then as we got\nto know each other kind of at\na deeper level our philosophies and our\nupbringings and our experiences it's\njust like okay i can really trust this\nguy i think we've both felt that from\nboth directions and once you have that\ntrust and you have you know everything\nset in motion it's kind of a table set\nfor you uh and you bring those relative\nstrengths uh you know i can certainly\nsay matt has has evolved more as a water\nexpert than i have as an actor\nbut\nvery low bar to clear there but uh but\nwhat else he didn't tell you earlier is\ni i went to ben affleck first he turned\nme down\nyou've both been so generous with your\ntime i have one last question which is\njust how people can support of course i\nhighly recommend everyone goes and grabs\na copy of the book the worth of water\nour story of chasing solutions to the\nworld's greatest challenge it will be\nin the comments the caption the bio the\nlink in the podcast you can go and order\nthe book right now uh but gary you used\na water metaphor uh at the end of the\nchapter\nuh of the chapter called the wave and\nyou said to end the crisis we need a\nwave i would love to know how my\ncommunity can be a part of that wave how\ni can be a part of that wave uh what are\nthe opportunities and ways people can\nget involved uh because i think\nultimately there's there's going to be\nno one who reads the book that isn't\nmoved by the work who everything you've\nshared today i think will want to move\npeople into action how can people\nsupport that's that's the last question\ni want to ask you because i know i'm\nmindful of your time as well that's a\ngreat question and you know this we do\nneed that support this is such a big\ncrisis it's all hands on deck and there\nare a number of ways of course you know\nas authors matt and i are donating all\nof our fees back to water.org for the\nbook uh so every time somebody buys the\nbook you are helping people get access\nto safe water you know if the book moves\nyou take it to your book club you know\nspread the word that way you know pass\nthe book on to to someone else uh\nbecause it is\nyou know these individual acts of people\nwho provide that that funding that we\nneed so that these individual stories\nthat are in the book can come to life\nthat is what it's going to take from\nfrom all of us and it to the extent that\nyou know you're using your voice jay to\nhelp make this happen we greatly\nappreciate that absolutely no i i would\nlove to visit one of the places with you\none day i think it would be a really\nbeautiful experience for me and my team\ntoo so we'd love to have you\nyeah that would be really yeah that\nwould be really beautiful that would be\nwonderful to do this\nuh matt did you want to add anything to\neverything that gary just said of how\nanyone can get involved or anything that\ncomes to your mind or heart well yeah i\nmean it's five dollars to bring a person\nclean water for life and uh you know so\nit's not you know\nyeah i know it's it's it's it's crazy\nbut uh but that's what it is and and uh\nand yeah and the book obviously you know\nuh we will you know all the you know our\nmoney goes towards that so um so yeah\nand and and please\nshare the story and uh you know talk\nabout it it's it's a really fascinating\nissue i promise if you want to engage\nwith it and uh\nand uh you know and and try to kind of\nmove the needle um because it's again so\nhard for us to relate you know because\nbecause water isn't such abundance for\nus yeah and and and as we were saying on\npurpose it's like when we're a part of\nthe solution\nuh the view of the problem changes right\nwhen you see these stories and that's\nwhy i love what gary and matt have done\nhere when you read these stories and you\nhear these stories and when you share\nthe book with people and you get to see\nthat change does work that there are\npositive stories that\nyou know the we we do live in a world\nthat has challenges and issues but that\nfive dollars could make a difference to\nsomeone's daily life and how they feel\nwhen they wake up in the morning and\nthat makes a difference like that has a\nripple effect and i think we need to\ntell these stories more because we can\nget caught up in the stories if we can't\ndo anything and we are helpless uh but\ngary and matt i'm so grateful that\nyou've given us a platform through which\nwe can all feel like we're having an\nimpact uh again i highly recommend\neveryone grab the book as you said all\nproceeds from the book go towards uh all\nthe amazing work uh and i thank you both\nfor taking the time and giving me your\nenergy and look forward to continuing to\nsupport you guys so uh thank you so much\nfor what you're doing it's it's so\npowerful i really appreciate it\nthanks jeff\ntake care thank you so much everyone\nwho's been listening or watching
