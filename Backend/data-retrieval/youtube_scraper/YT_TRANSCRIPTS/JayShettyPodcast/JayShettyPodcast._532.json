    "transcript": "what we're running from first and\nforemost is we're running from trauma\neven the subtle moments in time someone\ntells you you're stupid or you were in\nthe best of environments growing up but\nyou were fat shamed by a friend those\ntiny moments that are seemingly\ninsignificant dictate the rest of our\nlives\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you who come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now today we have\non a guest who has already been on\nbefore and we don't do that very often\nbut i have to do it for this special\nguest a dear friend an incredible author\nnumber one new york times bestseller\nmultiple\ninternational best-selling books the one\nand only gabby bernstein gabby thank you\nso much for coming back to on purpose\nthank you we've loved each other from\nthe moment we first met totally and that\nwas six years ago now believe it or not\nand we've talked about this multiple\ntimes about how we just instantly\nconnected and we found a way to stay\nconnected with me moving from new york\nto l.a through to not being able to see\neach other we just said hadn't seen you\nfor three years\nbut you wrote this incredible book\ncalled happy days the guided path from\ntrauma to profound freedom and inner\npeace and i want everyone who's\nlistening right now to go and order your\ncopy because you're going to love this\nconversation and you're going to want\nthe book even more so go and grab your\ncopy right now\nbut gabby you wrote this book at a tough\ntime yeah you know at a really tough\ntime in the world\nand i wanted to kind of take a step back\nbecause when we're doing this work\nthat we do\nand you've served\nmillions of people for years now that\nyou've been doing this like this has\nreally been a labor of love for you\nyou've brought joy to so many people\nover over a decade\nand my question is what is\nhappiness like let's really talk about\nwhat is happiness because we keep\nchasing these words yeah people are\nchasing mindfulness or happiness or joy\nor success but it's like when you've\nthought about happiness from all your\nlearnings all your wisdom all of your\njourney\nwhat is happiness my answer today is\nquite different than it would have been\nsix years ago when we first did our\nfirst interview\nthe difference is a greater\nunderstanding of what happiness is not i\nhad to really go to that place to come\nthrough and be on the other side of what\nit truly is and i began to really deepen\nmy awareness and understanding of what\ntakes us out of that presence of joy and\nas uh peter levine the founder of\nsomatic experiencing he says that trauma\nis the inability to be present\nand trauma\nis\noften the the root cause of most of our\nunhappiness\nwhether it's big t trauma or small t\ntrauma big t like uh living through a\ncatastrophic event or having kind of\nviolence in the household or small t\ntrauma being told you're you know not\ngood enough or being bullied\nbut we all have it in some way and when\nwe have it and it's not resolved we\nbuild up all of these defense mechanisms\nagainst it and that creates the\ninability to be present\nand to really\nexperience\nlife\nwith all of its moment-to-moment\nrichness\nand right here right now looking at you\nand really\ntaking you in\nand really just feeling into the thrill\nof what it's like to be back in the same\nroom with a very dear friend and\nsomebody i love and even when i came in\nand i hugged you\nsix years ago i would have been like hey\nand like very like not in my body and\nnot in the present moment with you\nbecause i was still stuck in that that\ntruncated trauma and so coming through\nthe other side of that what happiness\nmeans to me now is the ability to be\nfully present and that i'm not using\nthat language as like some woo-woo but\nto be fully present\nin the moment\nwith whatever is going on right here\nright now\nand that is how i'm living today\nand it's epic it's it's wonderful like\nit the fact that i could be in the uber\non my way here having a really awesome\nconversation with the woman driving me\nand getting to know a new person and\nthen walking in a room and just being\nable to hug my friend and feel that\nthat was a really long answer but but\nit's important to to really recognize\nthat i did not know what true happiness\nwas\nuntil nine books later\nyou know 16 years as a spiritual teacher\nand i knew what it was for myself along\nthe way but now i really feel like i've\ngotten to a place where it truly has\ntranscended sort of these\nobvious descriptions i really like that\ndefinition and i really like that\napproach because\ni think that\npresence is so\nover talked about but undervalued and\nunder applied we hear about it a lot as\nyou said\nbut we don't really know how to live it\nbecause presence to us\noften actually means judgment\nor\npresence means i'm present right now but\nnow i'm gonna critique that or i'm gonna\nsee that tell us how you think about\npresence differently because often\npeople say well when i'm present i just\nspot everything that's going wrong right\nnow or when i'm present i just start\nhighlighting things that i don't like or\ndo like for that matter so how do you\nsee presence as being\nbeyond judgment and criticism and\nobservation that's an interesting\noutlook on it so the concept of be\npresent it's just thrown around and it's\nthis concept of just sort of\nyou know when you meditate and you quiet\nyour mind yeah yeah yeah fine but\nreally what i believe is when you go on\nthe journey of undoing the storylines of\nyour past and to such a point and level\nthat they no longer have a hold on your\nnervous system\nand you begin to reorganize your\nreactivity and your relationship to\nyourself and how you respond to the\nworld\nthen you start to establish what is\nknown in sc somatic experiencing as a\nfelt sense it's a felt sense of and what\nthat means is\ni can stand outside my house in the\ncountry right now and this season change\nand smell spring\ni can\nlook in my son's eyes and feel the most\ninsane rush of oxytocin move through my\nheart when he just looks me in the eye\nand that's actually not the\nhuman experience typically typically we\nare moving so fast so dissociated from\nso checked out from we are we have\ndisembodied we're walking around like\nyou know without our heads on\nand and i could only say it's because\ni've lived like that for many many years\nand\nhad to work really hard with my\nmeditation and with my spiritual\npractice to keep coming back to\ngroundedness and so there's a lot of\nthat yo-yo of like i'm out i'm in i'm\nout i'm in but what if you could live\nlife\njust fully in the presence of of where\nyou are in every given moment and\ntruly taking it all in and that was\nalways sort of like oh that would be so\nyou know that's where we're going that's\nwhat we're talking about in my in\nspiritual books\nbut i know that now\nand\ni know that you as my friend who's known\nme for six years i'm sure you can feel\nthat in being with me in this room right\nnow versus six years ago\nand so and i've and i've had that\nexperience even through writing this\nbook my ninth book\nthat presence came through the is is\ninfused in every imprint\nand so\ni didn't think this was where we were\ngoing but it's actually it truly is what\nhappiness is to me it's it's being\nin the experience of things\nyeah and actually being able to\nexperience life yeah i love what you\nsaid there\nto me it really felt\nthat example of you looking into your\nson's eyes\nlike when you said that i think what i\nlove about that experience is that it's\nso immersive and then you said to take\nit all in\nand i feel like that's really what\npresence is is the ability to take it\nall in through all your senses right\nthat we don't even use i i often when\ni'm teaching meditation and we're\nactivating people's senses we start\nrecognizing how we over rely on our eyes\nthe only sense we actually observed\nthrough is our eyes and maybe then our\nears\nbut our nose our sense of touch is\nfairly\nuh unconscious right we're not always\naware of temperatures textures uh scents\nand things like that which which i find\nis we're not taking it all in uh one of\nthe things you just reminded me of is\ni\nread a study recently\nthat was talking about the or effect and\nit was saying that we're happier and we\nhave more pro-social behavior when we\nexperience or that's right and when you\nspoke about your son's eyes i was\nthinking about the idea of or so always\ngenerally nature beautiful landscapes\nviews but someone's eyes could be ore\nand it was saying that the reason why we\nlove or\nis because we simultaneously\nfeel tiny but a part of something bigger\nbeautiful so you feel a sense of\ninsignificance but connectedness at the\nsame time and i think that's what\npresence is to me i love that and i\nthink that someone listening right now\nmight be like\nwhat are they talking about how could i\nyou know because the truth is is i\nprobably i get that i understand that\nyou know what does that even mean to be\npresent what does it even mean to be in\nawe\nbecause\nwe live in such a protector mode\nwe have this huge\nbuild buildup almost like a wall built\nup against the presence of that energy\nof that awe\nand\nfrom a spiritual perspective it's almost\nlike we have to dismantle each of these\nbricks on this wall to just reconnect to\nand return to\nthat presence within ourselves and\nand truly even in the midst of this\nexperience of not being connected to\nthat awe and that presence for many many\nyears i was still able to touch into it\nit was i was on a path and a journey\ntowards it and i think that that\nactually really benefited my readers and\nit benefited the journey that i was on\nbecause that's where many people were\nwith me and so\nthis stage of my life 42 years young and\nwith much you know 16 years of being in\nthis field i have this experience right\nnow of having\nkind of upleveled\nmy well-being\nand that's actually what my hope is for\nmy reader right now with the if you open\nthis book right or if you are even\nlistening to us right now have this\nconversation\nyou've unconsciously consciously raised\nyour head and said yeah i'm ready to up\nlevel and the the gift of having this\nglobal crisis that we've all just lived\nthrough is that so much so many of us\njust started to crack open to the\nreality that we couldn't just pretend\nanymore\nand\nthis is the journey of kind of\nunearthing why we have been running and\nhow we've been running and how to stop\nyeah what are some of the ways you think\nwe're not even aware you have a chapter\nin the book called you know like why we\nrun away and it's like\nwhat are some of those hidden ways of\nrunning away\nthat you think stay with us because i\nalmost feel like there's the obvious\nways we know we run away\nthen there's the middle like in between\nhidden ones where we kind of convince\nourselves that we're not running away\nand then finally we raise our hands as\nyou said and say i'm ready to level up\nyeah what are some of those hidden\nconfusing places where we're running\naway or excuses that happen that block\nus i'm gonna come out straight with it\njay\nwhat we're running from first and\nforemost is we're running from trauma\nperiod end of story and that word has\nsuch a loaded stigma around it and i'm\njust wanting to bust through that now\nbecause we are all traumatized we you\ncan't be alive in this world right now\nat this time or even decades ago without\nexperiencing trauma in some form and\nlike i said some of us may have been\nbrought up with a totally secure\nattachment\nso much resilience so much grace in our\nlife and we've experienced trauma but\nmaybe you're able to move through it\nwith more ease because you had that safe\nsafe secure experience but it doesn't\nmean that it's you're unscathed it\ndoesn't mean that you have\nmissed missed you know the life's\nlessons because even the subtle\nmoments in time someone tells you you're\nstupid you're six years old right or you\nwere\nin the best of environments growing up\nbut you were fat shamed by a friend\nthose tiny moments that are seemingly\ninsignificant dictate the rest of our\nlives and so that's what we're running\nfrom\nthe bigger t the trauma\nas you mentioned you know uh\nwell actually we haven't gotten there\nyet but i reveal really big t trauma\nthat i had remembered in my when i when\ni was 36 years old\nthe bigger the teeth and trauma child\nabuse or living with an alcoholic parent\nwhatever it might be\nbut regardless of how big or small the\ntea is\nthere is something that needs to be\nundone\nbecause ultimately that's what we're\nrunning from and how are we running\nwe're running with drugs we're running\nwith alcohol we're running with food\nwe're running with judgment we're\nrunning with work we're running with\nrage we're running with control\nand these all the the lists that i just\nidentified are protector parts of us so\nlet me just simplify it even more\ni am now trained in internal family\nsystems therapy and the simplification\nof this is that we have these moments in\ntime where we disembodied we've been\nexperienced some kind of trauma we check\nout and then we say oh i never want to\nfeel that shame i never want to feel\nthat terror again\nwe just lock it up and those are called\nexiled parts of us they're often young\nparts and then we build up all these\nways of protecting ourselves and that's\nthe control that's the the drugs that's\nthe addiction that's the workaholism\nwhatever it might be to protect\nourselves from ever experiencing that\npain again\nwe all have exiles and we all have\nprotectors and this journey that we need\nto go on is to really relax those\nprotector parts so that they can\nremember that there is a source of love\nand an internal parent within us that\ncan take care of us\nit's incredible isn't it that\nwhat you're saying are these protector\nparts\nare actually causing us more pain yeah\nso we think we're protecting ourselves\nby running away so we have this\nprotector part but that protection is\nnot protection\nit's actually deepening the wound that's\ncorrect but it looks and feels and\nsounds like protection i've i've been\nspeaking to a lot of people lately who\nare saying to me\njay\ni am too sensitive and empathetic\ntowards this world and i don't feel like\ni belong here yeah right like there's\nthis feeling of like i just want a world\nfull of love and kindness\nand i don't feel like i belong here yeah\nit can feel scary to look at the trauma\nright it's scary like there's a big fear\naround\nwhether it's a small t trauma or big t\ntrauma as you said it can be really\ntough and you said after doing so much\nof this work 36 six years ago was when\nyou were able to look at it\nwhat do you think blocked you up until\nthat point from looking at it even\nthough you were doing so much work or\nhow did your work that you were doing\nactually open that up as well both yeah\nwell dissociation so similar to what\nyour friends are saying it's like it's\ntoo scary to live in this world and so\nyou know what often one of the great\nprotector parts is to dissociate\nto check out to even meditate above\nright to just just try to in some way\nnumb that out and for me i at 36\nin a dream remembered sexual abuse from\nmy childhood and i\nhad such a huge aha moment when that\ndream surfaced because this is why i was\na cocaine addict this is why i was an uh\nalcoholic this is why i was a workaholic\nthis is why i was controlling the [ __ ]\nout of everything in my life so there\nwas relief in knowing okay this is what\ni've been running from and it was so\nextreme in my case that my brain\nliterally just\nyou know it's a beautiful\nbrain response to say oh this is so\noverwhelming to the system that it's\ngoing to be\ntotally checked out and dissociated from\nbut even if you dissociate from a memory\nit still shows up in your body it still\nshows up in your gastrointestinal issues\nit shows up in your sleep it shows up in\nyour relationships it shows up in your\naddiction it shows up everywhere because\nyou may not have the\nthe actual\nclaiming of the memory but the memory is\nstill in your nervous system\ni remembered at 36 because by that stage\ni'd already written about i'd been 11\nyears sober i'd probably written seven\nbooks you know i'd be i'd been really on\nthis very big quest to my own spiritual\nawakening and all the work that i had\ndone everything i'd written about got me\nto the place where i was safe enough to\nremember\nyou know everything's in the perfect\norder there's no accident\ni've done a tremendous amount of\nspiritual work a tremendous amount of\ntherapeutic work i got to a place in my\nlife\nalso this is important to recognize\nwhere there was a lot of new things\nhappening around me so control was one\nof the ways that i kept\nthat exiled story at bay\nbut a lot of things in my life at that\ntime were falling out of control so i\nwas uh\nmy husband was leaving his job\nat jpmorgan to come run our business we\nwere talking about family planning we\nhad just gotten married so these big\nlife moments are often when people do\nremember traumas or if it's a trauma\nthat you're aware of it can really get\nactivated and come to the surface\nso just something for the listener to\nconsider\nand\nit was so horrific and so scary to\nremember that but the journey that i've\nunderwent since that time is what allows\nme to put my face on this book cover and\nhave it say the guided path from trauma\nto profound freedom and inner peace and\nmean every freaking word of that and to\nbe able to stand behind that with full\nintegrity\nauthenticity and\nand power\nto be able to say you know what so all\nthese people are so traumatized\neveryone's so traumatized and i can say\ngo do this\nand\nit's it's it's a gift to be able to\nlive to tell yeah absolutely i i really\nappreciate what you said about being\nsafe enough yeah because i think that\nwhen you start this work\nit's not that all of it happens at the\nsame level and it's not that the work\nlooks the same every year\nand so when you start doing personal\ngrowth self-development spiritual work\nwhatever it may be it's going to look\ndifferent every single year new things\nare going to be unlocked and opened and\nunearthed and so i think people can feel\ncomfortable that if they're on the\njourney that's right there will be a\npoint at which it's safe enough in your\nwords\nto feel that you can be revealed to that\nand and i wanted to say something here\nbecause i i love this dedication and\nwhen you said that about getting married\nand trauma you actually dedicate this\nbook\nto your husband for my husband zach\nthank you for loving all of my parts and\nhelping me feel safer than i ever\nthought possible which i thought was\nbeautiful yeah uh you're reading that is\nlike really emotional for me\nbecause you know\nit was a trauma for him to be married to\nme and you know jay i opened this book\nby saying\nthat my publishers came to me\nand\ni sent them the manuscripts and these\nare publishers i've worked with for so\nmany years and i'd written\nbooks and they would just accept the\nmanuscript the universe has your back\nready to ready to print you know super\nattractor ready to print and i send them\nthis manuscript and they write back like\nwe need to talk\nand i get on the phone with them and\nthey're like\nwe're really nervous for you gabby\nbecause you're revealing so much and\nit's one negative story after the next\nand we don't think that you're showing\nyour true strength\nand my response was my ability to be\nthis vulnerable is my true strength\nbut it wasn't just them it was zach like\nwhen my husband read this book he edits\nmy books before they go to the publisher\ni have an editor then it goes to zach\nand then it goes to the publisher\nand when he read this it was really\ntriggering for him super activating and\nthere was moments when he would say to\nme i didn't even know this was going on\nand it's so emotional for me because\nwhen you're living in that kind of\nrecovery and that crisis\nthere's so much shame wrapped up in it\nand especially when you're the self-help\nbook author you know that the shame is\nso extreme\nthat you feel so alone in the journey\nand\ni just have such a deep gratitude for my\nhusband for holding me in that i have\ngratitude for\nall the whole team of therapists that\nhelped me in that but but particularly\nfor my spiritual connection because\nwithout that i would have been really\nalone yeah and so that's really what i\nwant this book to do for people is to\nhelp them know they're not alone in this\njourney and that we all have a lot that\nwe can\nlook at and gently and slowly and safely\nbegin to peel back the layers or take\nthe bricks off the wall\nand uh yeah but just just just hearing\nyou read that acknowledgement out loud\nand that that that dedication out loud\nis just\nit just says a lot about\nwhat it means to hold another person in\ntheir trauma the reason why it touched\nme is because again i think a lot of\nlisteners a lot of comments that i see\na lot of story tags that i see\nand and people that i speak to my\npersonal life\ntrauma\ncan break partnerships yeah oh yeah\nmassively oh yeah and\nwe see either people struggling\nin\nshared trauma struggling with their\nindividual trauma being passed over to\neach other wounds being shared\nexplain to us\nhow\nsomeone can hold space for someone\nduring their\ntrauma journey and work and as they're\non this path and actually more\nimportantly because you do tell us the\nguided path from trauma to profound\nfreedom\nhow do you help someone help you yeah\ni'm really interested in that yeah\nbecause because i find that so often we\nexpect someone else to help us but how\ndo you help your partner help you rather\nthan expecting them to be a therapist\nwhich is really unrealistic totally\nunrealistic well there's there's a lot\nof answers to that question so the best\nway you can help them help you is to\njust tell the truth to the best of your\nability so even if it's the trauma that\nyou're facing actually on my on my\npodcast i workshop people and i dear\ngabbied someone yesterday and she was\ntalking about how this book is bringing\nup a lot for her and she's starting to\nface into it and her partner just\ndoesn't understand and i said to her\nlisten yeah and i said listen\nyou may not feel safe enough yet to let\nhim in on your full journey or even what\nyou're facing into\nbut it would be extremely valuable for\nyou to go to him and say hey\na lot of stuff is coming up for me right\nnow it's old stuff from my childhood and\nit's really scary for me and i'm reading\nthis book and i'm i want to assure you\ni'm doing this really beautiful work on\nthis and i'm committed to maybe seeking\nout therapy and going deeper and my\nintention is to really create a safe\nenvironment for myself and for our\nrelationship but uh\nthat's the truth of where i'm at right\nnow\nand that may be the only truth that you\ncan tell because it's just too much\nshame wrapped up in telling exactly\nwhat's up\nthat comment that truth that extension\nof of vulnerability even in that slight\nway is extremely soothing to the other\npartner because\nif you just leave them completely in the\ndark\nand they don't understand why you are so\nreactive they don't understand why you\nmight pick up the drink they can't\nunderstand why and so giving them a\nlittle look behind the why is a very\nvaluable thing another thing i\nrecommended to her was to have him read\nthe book because any\nyou know when you've got unresolved\ntrauma\nbig t or small t the patterns are just\ntextbook jay you know what i mean like\nif you were to look at all of my\nsymptoms you'd be like check check check\ncheck check check\ni now having done my research and having\nstudied this and having lived it i can\nspot it in humans everywhere i'm like\nbig t trauma small drama big deep big\npeak but you know i can see it like i\nkept asking zach at times to read this\none book that was about women who had\nlived through childhood abuse and it was\na little bit too much for him but\nhanding him a book like this or handing\na partner a book like happy days\nallows the partner to be like oh wow\nthis whole story sounds just like my\npartner or oh yeah my partner does that\ntoo and it gives you an insight of like\none the opportunity for the traumatized\nperson to say look i'm not alone\nand then for the partner to recognize oh\nthis is a real thing i think those are\ngreat answers i i love both of those i\nwould highly recommend everyone who's\nlistening and watching if you're reading\nhappy days right now make sure you\nshare even paragraphs of it you may take\na picture and send it to your partner or\nto a friend\nand of course if you're not reading it\nmake sure you grab a copy of the book as\nyou're listening right now because\ni do believe that what gabby's saying is\nso deeply\ntrue\nthat if we have not healed our traumas\nwe're going to carry them with us into\nevery workplace relationship scenario\nand it just gets harder because that\ntrauma gets tied up in more people's\ntrauma and then you can't even tell the\ndifference between yours someone else's\nand collective\nand so i feel like the earlier we can do\nthis work the healthier it can be for us\nand i i love what you just said about\nthe idea of informing someone hey this\nis what i'm going through this is why\nthis week i might be really irritable\nand why i'm really struggling this week\ni'm gonna need your support and i think\ni i do this with rather often even about\nsmall things where i'm like i've got\nthis really big thing on thursday i'm\nreally nervous about it like just know\nthat that's right this week every gap i\nget i'm going to be super silent because\ni'm going to be preparing my energy for\nthis thing that's a small thing of just\nsomething coming up instantly but what\nabout when you're doing something\ninternal so i love those and i would\nencourage people to even if someone\ncan't read a book that you send them\nscreenshots and pictures that's right\nand it's gonna get them moving and this\nbook does a great job at breaking those\nareas down i like that idea too of being\nlike hey read this page or listen to\nthis one section of the audiobook\nbecause\nor just listen to the conversation\nbetween gabby and jay because\nwhat it does is it just gives a little\ninsight and and then that also helps you\nas the reader as the as the person on\nthe journey to take away the shame\nthere's a chapter in the book actually\nthat's called um speaking the\nunspeakable and it's all about shame and\nyou know here i was jay i was 36 i was\njust facing into this i'm at a\nretreat leading the freaking retreat\nwith two other women\nand it's a retreat on\nyou know women facing their trauma and\ntranscending their past\nand i'm about six months into my own\nrecovery so i had no business teaching\nat that time but i didn't realize that\nthat's actually you know part of\nsome of the vulnerable things i shared\nin this book the publishers were like do\nyou really want to say that\nyes i have to say it all um so here i\nwas and i'm teaching that i'm leading\nthis retreat and so in the other\nteacher's session i'm sitting in the\nroom doing the workshop with them and\nthe workshop's all about shame i'm like\nokay like you know i'll partner up with\nsomebody i'll just like hold space for\nthem right and here i am in this\ndialogue about shame and i realize at 36\nyears old seven self-help books 11 years\nof sobriety\nyou know dec you know over a decade of\nwork on stage speaking about\nspirituality and i sit there and i'm\nlike\noh my god shame\ni didn't realize i had it wow it's so\nburied it's the most impermissible\nemotion\nthat\nit's it is the exiled part it was so so\nunsafe i mean i was like of course i'm\nlovable of course i'm adequate i don't\nhave shame\nyou know we all do but it was so buried\nso deep that facing into that you know\nis a very gentle process and so one of\nso another intention here this in this\nconversation in this just speaking of\ntrauma just giving voice to trauma is to\njust end the stigma and shift the shame\nbecause that shame is why we don't open\nup to our partners that shame is why we\ndon't even open a book like this yeah\nand that's and that's actually what i\nwas gonna say that\ni think one of the biggest things i hear\nis\noh no i have no trauma like no i don't i\ndon't have any shame like no no i'm you\nknow and i've i've even led\npeople i've worked with through\ninner child meditations and and\nyou know work and they don't allow\nthemselves to go there oh yeah and one\nof the biggest things i also find is\npeople don't want to go there because\nthey're scared they'll get stuck there\ntotally totally right and so\ntell us a bit about that path of opening\nup something\nbut not getting stuck there what is the\ndifference between someone who opens up\na book like this obviously you've given\nthe whole path and it's in here but i\nmean like that difference between\nsomeone who opens up a part of\nthemselves\nthen just feels like their whole life is\ncollapsing versus someone who opens it\nhas the courage to look at it but then\nis able to pass through what what have\nyou noticed of the difference you have\nto titrate in and out\nit's not you cannot when you're dealing\nwith big wounds big t or small t i'm\ngoing to keep going back to that because\nsome people listen they're like oh you\nknow nothing's ever happened to me and\nif i were sitting with you right now i\ncould find 30 things that are that\nyou're running from you know or one\nmajor thing you're running from so\nwherever you are on the spectrum\nthe first\nthing to really identify is that you\ncan't just rip the band-aid off right\naway and you have to go slow and there\nare plenty of people that i have right\nnow that in my world girlfriend just\nrecovering from postpartum depression\ni'm like do not read the book right now\nyou know put it on the shelf and wait um\nif someone's opening the book and it's\nsuper activating to them the answer\ncould be you know go back into your\ntherapy and then use the book when you\nfeel safer don't put yourself in a\nposition where you're going to blow out\nyour system\nwith too much\ndigging too fast now\nwith that said\ninside this book\ni hold you by the hand and i walk you so\nslowly through these steps over and over\nagain i say if this is too much for you\nplease skip ahead read the next chapter\ngo back to chapter three the body-based\nwork there's a whole chapter on how to\nsettle your nervous system through\nbody-based practices\nand\nthat in itself can just be so soothing\nto someone as they start to open up to\nthe possibility that there's something\nthat they need to face and so through\nbreath work through physical somatic\nwork through through body talk\nand just even getting in touch with\nwhat's going on in your body there's so\nmuch relief and so it's just a very slow\nprocess i don't think people can just\nrip the band-aid off at once it's not\nit's not possible yeah i'm glad you said\nthat because i think a lot of people\nthink they have to or they think that\nthat's the only way and i was actually\ngoing to talk about that i love this\nsection on\nhiding behind the body and there's a\nbeautiful quote here that you have that\nsays i came to accept that i didn't have\na gut problem i still had a subconscious\nemotional problem yeah\nand this whole chapter for everyone\nwho's reading along or or is going to\nget the book is called hiding behind the\nbody\nand that to me was huge because i think\ntoday\nwe're all\ntrying to be healthier hopefully\neveryone is listening to this podcast at\nleast i know is people are changing\ntheir diet they're changing their sleep\nroutine they're changing the vitamins\nthey take and the supplements they take\nbut then they're still wondering\nwhy\nthings aren't\ngetting worked out and i think a lot of\npeople are listening can relate to that\nand then you start to recognize that the\nbody is just a window into\nwhat's actually sitting behind there\nwhat have you found because you've been\nresearching this studying this you give\na guided path what were other useful\nresources\non that journey that you kind of\nrecommend to people in the book to say\nhey check this person out or think about\nthis idea or area of your work in that\nchapter i\nreally referenced the work of dr john\nsarno who wrote healing back pain he\nwrote the mind body prescription and all\nof his work was really based on the\npremise that our physical conditions are\npsychosomatic and by no means in my book\nin my work or in his work was there any\nreference of don't get that medication\nor don't go on that therapeutic path\nphysically whatever it might be but to\nreally look closely at what are the\nbelief systems and the impermissible\nfeelings that are not being met\nbehind the physical\nsensations so for me in the book i\nreference how i had decades of\ngastrointestinal issues and what i\nrecognized through my healing journey is\nthat i didn't have gastrointestinal\nissues i had unresolved trauma i had\nimpermissible rage i had impermissible\nterror i had impermissible shame\nand as i began to\nbecome safer in my nervous system safer\nin my mind safer\nyou know reprocessing memories\ni have zero gastrointestinal issues i\nlove hearing i didn't have to ch you\nknow i did for decades you know sibo\ndiets and this thing and i had you know\nthis supplement and all of that is\nnecessary when you're having acute\nproblems you need medication you need\nvitamins you need diets to just get back\nto baseline and for sure but\nall of it goes away\nso many of our so some people are like\nwell how do i know if i have trauma i'm\nlike well do you have a sleep disorder\ndo you have gastro issues do you have\ntmj do you have so go to the body first\ndo you have acne you know and then it\ngoes even deeper do you have panic\nattacks do you have depression do you\nbut the bottom line is is that our body\nis a first responder and our body is\nsuch a beautiful way to reveal to us\nwhat is\nwhat is needing to be healed and in fact\nwe talked about protector parts the\nphysical body actually is a form of\nprotection right so we send from the\nsarno perspective we have a nervous\nsystem response because our traumas are\ntriggered our body gets tense we go into\nthat fight flight response so that\ntension shows up in the stomach the\ntension shows up in the migraine that\ntension starts to you know block oxygen\nfrom flowing to these areas from a\ngastrointestinal perspective it stops\nthe gi tract from actually\nmoving moving\nour bowel movements and then what\nhappens bacteria builds up and then you\nactually do have a real diagnosis of\nsibo or ibs or whatever\nwell if you actually relax your nervous\nsystem\nyour\nwhole system can start to move you can\nhave that\nperfect digestion begin to settle\nbecause you're relaxed and in that\nrelaxed state your body can heal and so\nwe have to really look at the\npsychosomatic effect of our physic the\nphysical conditions from a psychosomatic\nperspective\nthat already relaxes my nervous system\ngoing like oh wow like that's where it\nis like because i think a lot of people\nright now are just\nwe're tinkering with so many parts of\nour life and then we're wondering why do\ni still not feel the way oh yeah okay\nlike i'm doing everything right and i've\ni've been in that position myself or i'm\nlike i'm doing everything right why am i\nstill not feeling good\nand sometimes it is biological\nif you're psychologically done done some\nof the work and then it's the other way\naround as well\nwhat were you surprised by when you\nstarted doing this work what was one of\nthe big surprises that came along as you\nstarted to do the work on yourself\nthat you actually thought wow i didn't\nexpect this like i didn't think this was\ngoing to happen well i was surprised by\nthe shame i was like whoa i have shame\nlike what is that right that was so\nstrange right i'm like this spiritual\nteacher i didn't even recognize my shame\nit was a shame for i mean the shame you\nknow when you experience sexual abuse in\nany form whether you're particularly as\na child\nthe shame is it's my fault the shame is\ni'm wrong\nand you know underneath all of this is\nthe belief that we're inadequate and\nunlovable my therapist taught me that\nand i remember her saying that and at\nthe time i'm like i'm very adequate and\nlovable like what the hell are you\ntalking about you know a decade later\nwow\nthat is absolutely a core belief that i\ncarried for so long\nand another big thing i realized was how\nmy spiritual practice actually really\nsaved me and was the through line of all\nof the guidance of the work that i was\nled to and i in the book reference very\nspiritual therapeutic practices for\ntrauma so i reference emdr which is eye\nmovement desensitization and\nreprocessing it's bilateral brain\nstimulation that allows you to reprocess\nmemories\ni reference sc somatic experiencing\nwhich is a body based trauma therapy ifs\nwhich i went as far as to get trained in\nand ifs is all about the caring for your\ninner child parts\nand these specific therapies are all\nvery spiritual\nin the clinical space they may not be\nreferenced in that way but i can say\nthat right and i can be the spiritual\nvoice for them and i believe it's spirit\nthat my my spirit guides that my\nconnection to god\nvery very very\nclearly laid out this path for me\nand not just for me to live it but also\nfor me to share it and then i would say\nthe one of the biggest surprises though\nwas when i would meet these different\ntherapeutic practices each time i was\nblown away i was like\noh my god what you know i was carrying\nthat oh my god next level that is so\npresent in my body oh my god you know\nand just witnessing and witnessing\nand\ni think that the big one of the biggest\nsurprises also jay is that when you live\nwith trauma you think that's who you are\nyou just think i am a workaholic i am a\ncontrol freak and you don't know that\nthere there's a way out and i am so\nproud the greatest gift i'll give this\nworld is my bravery to go to the places\nthat scared me and come out the other\nside so that i can live to tell that\nthis works that you can survive trauma\nand that you can thrive i feel it the\nconfidence in your space and i also just\nappreciate how\nyou were able to push back\nyour\ncontrol\nparameters\nand protectors because like you said\nyou've been doing this work for a long\ntime you've been teaching this work\nyou're helping people you're\nchanging people's lives\nand then going well actually there's\nanother layer\nwhat layer\nof love\nwas that work in the trauma like when\nyou said we have that\ndeep held belief of i'm unlovable\nand\ni'm inadequate inadequate how do you\nfall in love with yourself again when\nyou realize that's at the root of it\nbecause really you're not trying to fall\nin love with yourself before you're\ntrying to protect and fix\nand then all of a sudden now you're\nsaying at this stage\nyeah you returned to yeah exactly well\ni'm going to answer that from an ifs\nperspective when i when i use the\nacronym ifs it's internal family systems\ntherapy and it's not actually about your\nfamily your outside families but your\ninner family so you've got your exiled\nparts of you and you've got your\nprotector parts of you and then we all\nhave self your language you might call\nit higher self or god or the universe\nand i did that as well for many years\ninner guidance\nand self is self with a capital s\nand what self is is the internal parent\nit's the undamaged resourced\npart of who we are\nit's the man that i'm sitting with here\nright now you show up to your podcast in\nself and that's actually why it's so\nresonant with people because they feel\nthat there's no ego attached to it\nthere's no you're not showing up with\nlike\na presence of neediness or anything\nyou're showing up this is me i'm this is\nwhat i'm here to do i'm on my mission\nbut when your wife triggers you\nyour protector parts might show up\nand you might start to get into an\nextreme pattern and that's for all of us\nso we all have\naccess to\nthis undamaged resource part of who we\nare self qualities or courage compassion\ncalmness creativity\ncuriosity\nconnectedness and when we are in that\npresence of self like you and i are here\nright now\nanything's possible i could say to you\nright now something really difficult for\nyou to hear\nbut you would hear it with love because\ni'm grounded in that in that self energy\nand so\nthe main way to fall back in love with\nyourself\nis to\nlet self\nbecome the leader\nof your inner system\nso it's not like we want to control or\npush down\nor manage these protector parts of\nourselves there's no bad parts\nwe just want to help them be less\nextreme\nand how we want to let them know that\nthere's an internal parent let me give\nyou a really clear example okay\nso\ni let's say something triggered me last\nweek i was like\nin a conversation with some friends and\ni was like oh my god they don't like me\nlike an old exiled part was there and\nwhen the exiled part comes up you don't\nwant to feel it right so then one of my\nprotectors tries to numb it out and the\nprotector is the judger in that case\nlike well they're wrong right and i go\ninto like all the reasons they're wrong\nbecause i don't want to feel that shame\nand then i'm like well oh my god no i'm\nwrong because i you know so we attack\nothers we attack ourselves and so those\nare protector parts in the judge someone\nhas to be wrong somebody asked me wrong\nright so the judger was there to protect\nme from feeling that impermissible\nfeeling and then because i have this\nthis great through line to self i was\nable to notice okay notice there's a\nprotector up okay notice where do i feel\nthat in my body notice is it does it\nhave a color does it have a shape is\nthere is there something that it wants\nto say to me what do i know about it\nokay i know it's young i know it's a\nyoung girl who you know doesn't feel\nlike she is understood in high school\nright and i know that she's just wanting\nto blame others because because she's so\nscared\nand what does she need right now\nshe needs a hug\nshe needs to breathe\nand i can let her actually speak to me\nand i can listen to that\npart\nand then i can give her what she needs\nand so\nit's literally a practice of becoming\nyour own\ninternal parent\ncreating the secure attachment that we\ndid not get from our parents\nwith ourselves\nand there's no greater form of self-love\nthan letting self with a capital s\nlead your entire system\nand you have to see that the thing here\njay is i didn't shame that part i wasn't\nlike oh that judger is there or that\nyoung child parts showing up like you're\na loser i actually really got curious\nabout it i was compassionate toward it i\nbrought a calm energy to it\nand so the goal here really is to begin\nto soften and relax the protectors\nbecause frankly jay you know the\nprotectors are not bad right like the\ncontroller wrote nine books in 11 years\nyou know she did a good job so but we\njust want her to be less extreme yes and\nso she can keep producing and keep\ncreating but not in that extreme way\nit's a lot of density in chapter seven\nof the book i go deep into ifs but i\nwant to just reiterate for the listener\nnotice no need\nnote in the moment when you can if you\nhave enough awareness to notice that\nyou're triggered notice it in your body\nwhat does it feel like is there a color\nis there a shape what do you know about\nit\nand then what does it need\nand give yourself a moment to try that\nout even though there's so much depth to\nit i felt that was very clear because\ni think that's what we're ultimately\navoiding is accepting that we have an\ninner child need that's right right it's\nlike that's ultimately what we're\nrunning away from is that we do have a\ngap\ninternally and it isn't going to be\nsolved through something in the external\nworld it's not going to be solved\nthrough someone saying something to us\nin a nice way or someone changing right\nright like it's not like my husband\nchanging his tone is never going to heal\nmy wounds right it may make a create a\nworld where i'm less activated less\nfrequently yes but like someone else's\nbehavior cannot change your reactivity\nand that doesn't mean the other person\nshouldn't show up as well but like you\nhave to be your internal parent your\npartner can't be your parent frankly in\nmany ways your parent can't parent you\nback to that you know you especially if\nthey're you know 42 years old or\nwhatever it is\nas a little child the expectation is\nyou'll have that but most don't that's\nso powerful because i think most of us\nwhat we're yearning for is to live in a\nless deactivated state so ideally what\nwe want is\nif everyone was just nicer and kinder\nthen things would just feel better right\nbut the reality is that not everyone's\njust going to be nicer and kinder uh and\nif we can be in that environment that's\nbeautiful it's a great environment to\ngrow in\nbut\nwhat you just said was so brilliant you\nwere like you know if my husband\nchanging his tone is not gonna solve the\nwound and and i think that that's why\nthe path that you just laid out\nis fantastic because we're constantly\nchecking in with everyone else's needs\nwe're trying to be pleasing to other\npeople's needs\ni don't know the last time most people\nif we're honest with ourselves and i\nwant everyone who's listening to truly\nbe honest with yourself\nwhen was the last time you checked in\nwith yourself and not just yourself your\ninner child self the younger self as\ngabby was saying and said what do you\nneed i just i mean even me i'm listening\ni'm going i can't remember the last time\ni did that for myself and the\ndistinction here too is that you're\nasking the protector part what it is yes\nbecause the exiled parts are really\nlocked up jay like they're like locked\nin a basement and to start to touch into\nthe exiles i would recommend doing that\nwith ifs therapy like with an ifs\ntherapist you can learn more about it i\ndo an interview with dick schwartz on my\npodcast and then obviously in this\nchapter there's a whole\ndialogue about ifs and we can give some\nresources links as well in the show\nnotes but more importantly that you\nwould\ngo\nthrough\nthat deeper exiled child part journey\nwith a trained therapist particularly in\nthis system\nbut that you right now right here can\nstart to just be a parent to those\nprotector parts and that's the first\nstep\nbecause the protectors are really the\nones that you can see the child's\nactivated but the protector switches\nright in the protector is like oh i'm\ngonna lock that door like there's a\nlittle activation no thank you i'm gonna\nput that fire out by picking up a drink\ni'm going to put that fire out by raging\nyou know and so you want to work with\nthe alcoholic you want to work with the\nrager and the more you softened your\nrelationship to those protector parts\nthe closer you can get to the exile yeah\nbecause the protectors are there first\nresponders like no way you're not going\nto get behind that door and so you have\nto start to soften those relationships\nthat's good that's a good distinction\nfor me because i was yeah i think i my\nspace was still\nwith the exiled part but as you said for\na lot of people those may be too locked\nup yeah and for some it's less so you\nknow for some for some people that have\ndone a lot of personal growth work like\nif you and i were to do a session in ifs\nright now we could get to your child\nparts and you'd be very safe there\nyou've done a lot of work you've got\nyou're safe in your system we could go\nto an exile but i would never like the\naverage person that hasn't done a lot of\npersonal growth work it's not it's not\nsafe to go yeah yeah yeah that's without\nthe therapy yeah yes yeah absolutely and\nthat's a great distinction to make again\nthat we don't want people\nuh going off and trying to do something\nthat yeah isn't going to serve them yeah\nyou you talk a lot about you know in the\nbook the i think one of the last\nchapters or the last chapter is love\nevery part\num\nand and i think\njust as we believe we're unlovable and\ninadequate\nwe somehow believe that that's not\npossible\nright somewhere inside of us\nthere's a belief that it's actually not\npossible\nto be happy yeah or to love ourselves\nlike it just exists there somewhere do\nwe develop\na belief that it exists before we find\nit or do we start looking for it and\nfind it along the way\ni was looking for it and found it along\nthe way\nand i remember\nbeing in the early stages of remembering\nthe trauma and waking up super depressed\nwaking up\nso down so scared\nnot totally disembodied for months when\nyou actually remember a dissociative\ntrauma you kind of go back into it so\nyou're living in terror like everything\nis just danger\nand i was just like there's no way out\nbut i was so committed\nand so i think the most important\nmessage is it's not about\ngetting out overnight in naa when you\nget sober they say i wish you a slow\nrecovery because that means that you're\ndoing the work wow i love that it means\nthat you're you're going under the\nsurface and peeling back the layers and\nso the same goes i mean\naddiction addiction really is a root\ncause is trauma period so it's really\ngoing back slowly into the trauma and so\ni would say that to the person that's\nrecognizing trauma is i wish you a slow\nrecovery meaning that\nevery small layer that you peel back is\na miracle\nand the more you add up those miracle\nmoments the closer you get to living a\nmiraculous life\nso you can celebrate your successes\nalong the way\nso for today maybe you pick up happy\ndays and you just read the first chapter\nthat's a success story maybe you just\nlisten to this podcast episode again\nthat's another layer maybe you practice\none of the breath practices in the book\nthat's another layer and it's it's it's\na very very gentle process and you have\nto be\nfully celebrating every step of the\njourney am i done jay i'm not done i\nstill go to therapy every wednesday i\nstill have sometimes two additional\nsessions a month i still am deep in emdr\ni'm still doing my own ifs on myself i'm\ngonna be going forever\njust shining the crystal yeah\nand so but there is really freedom on\nthe other side there really is well\nthat's that presence again right in\nbeing present in the process as you just\nsaid but i think that's what's so hard\nright now is that\nbecause of the way the world's going\neverything's become more instant more\nfast fast recovery quick fix\nand i mean that's always been the way\nbut it's become more and more and more\nand more and more and then when you're\nbeing asked to do slow recovery and the\nreal work which is what we know\ngenuinely has the reward\nduring and at the end of the journey i\nfind that that\ncollision is so hard for people because\nthey wake up with resistance again so\nit's like just when you had that moment\nwhen you felt you had a breakthrough you\nwake up the next morning and the\nresistance is fully back yeah\nthat's actually why i think it's\nvaluable to build up your toolbox of\nself-regulating techniques and they're\nin here and the reason that's valuable\nis that you can still feel relief along\nthe way you can still have fun along the\nway yeah it's not postponing the journey\nyeah you've known me for six years\nsix years ago i was like totally in a\nvery different nervous system than i am\nnow\nbut i still had fun oh 100 you know i\nstill could be with you and just have a\ngreat time it was a different kind of\nfun and it was a different kind of\nexperience because i wasn't in the\npresence that i'm in now but it's not\nlike you can't live your life and have\njoy along the way\nthese especially if you're on the\njourney that's why it's called a\nspiritual path or a spiritual journey if\nyou're on the path and the journey every\nstep of it's an up-leveling and so\nand especially if you have this arsenal\nof these self-regulating tools okay i\ncan be going through some big stuff i\ncan be slowly getting sober i can be\nslowly recovering from trauma i can be\nslowly going through therapy but at the\nsame time have these amazing meditations\nhave these amazing breath practices that\nsoothe me have these great breakthroughs\nin my therapy or in my relationship and\njust celebrate those miracles along the\nway tell me how you think about trauma\ndifferently as being a mom oh dude if\nyou've got unhealed drama and you are\nabout to become a parent particularly i\nwould say for both parents but\nparticularly a mother that's going to\ncarry a baby and deliver a baby in in\nthe first early days be the food for the\nbaby and the whole thing\nuh you want to do this work\nbecause if you don't you know what will\nhap you know if you even if you do or\nyou don't doesn't matter it'll all come\nflooding in\nin my case not only did the trauma flood\nin but i also was hit with really\nterrible postpartum depression suicidal\npostpartum depression i write about it\nin the book because it actually often if\nyou have unresolved trauma can be uh\nvery activating even with the\nbiochemical condition of postpartum it\njust can take it to the next level\nso\nfor me my having my son was one of the\nbiggest trauma responses i've\nexperienced in my life was postpartum\nthat's a beautiful blessing because when\nyou make the commitment to have a child\nyou are\nhaving to ask yourself two questions\nam i gonna do this the way it was done\nfor me\nor am i gonna show up big time\nand how do you show up you show up for\nyourself\nbecause the more you re-parent yourself\nthe clearer the path to parenting your\nchild\nthere's a chapter in this book called\nre-parenting yourself it's all here it's\njust it's almost a joke and it's a\nchapter called re-parenting yourself\nwhere in early 2020 i'm like you know\nrunning my business like everyone's in\nthis like storm my kid's home he's two\nyears old he's not napping twice a day\nand me and zach are the only ones with\nhim at that time\nbecause everybody's home and i went\ndiving deep into the the parenting books\nparticularly dan siegel's work and he\nhas a lot of methods and one of them i\nloved the 4s is scene\nsoothed safe secure\nand i started applying this with my kid\nand i was making sure i was really\nseeing him and soothing him not just\nphysically but like really energetically\nand creating a safe environment not just\nthat he won't fall over on the you know\nbut a safe energetically and that\ncreates a secure attachment bond\nnow i was looking at this experience\nwith oliver and i was like\nno one ever did this for me you know i\nwas like why can't i do this for myself\nso i wrote a whole chapter i did it for\nmyself and i wrote about it and so the\nbest parenting advice i have is to do\nthe work on yourself yeah yeah this is a\nparenting book as much as it is because\nit's re-parenting yourself to be a\nbetter parent yes yeah absolutely and\nand with that i mean it's again the\nshame again right like from the mothers\nthat i know well who who are open and\nhonest with me\nif you go through that\npost giving birth it's like there's\nshame and guilt in that because yeah\nbecause it impacts so it's again another\nopportunity to to choose shame and guilt\nand then you don't tell anyone because\nas a mom mom guilt is even harder\nto share\nwhat did you do in that period i mean\nobviously you're doing all of this work\nbut\nwhat did you specifically do yeah to\nmove through that\nso here i was now at that stage\nhad\npublished\nmaybe seven or eight eight books\nsomething like this and you know i'm\njust sort of showing the world of where\ni was a self-help book author\nvery entrenched in the wellness space\nbrought up homeopathic really believing\nin natural medication medicine never had\nfulfilled a prescription at a pharmacy\nand\nin many ways probably was a part of the\nstigma around mental health because i\nwould be in my audiences and people\nwould say to me like i'm depressed and\ni'd like try this meditation\ni didn't realize if you're having a\nbiochemical condition it doesn't work if\nyou're having a biochemical condition\nand so i was having a biochemical\ncondition but not fully giving it voice\nand i got to the point where i was\nhaving insomnia i had insomnia for four\nmonths\nand when you don't sleep you get\nextraordinarily depressed and for me it\nbecame\nsuicidal i opened the chapter talking\nabout how i'm driving to mother's day\nbrunch and i'm in the back seat with my\nson and under my breath they say i want\nto kill myself\nand so that's where i was at\nand i did not get help\nfor four months maybe longer\ni was undiagnosed because\nof the stigma and the shame\nof what mental illness is\nand you know we have to really begin to\nlook at the shame and the stigma around\nit and so for me in in my experience\nhere i was in this wellness world and\nyou know\nfinding\nthat ashwagandha wasn't going to be the\nanswer and melatonin wasn't going to be\nthe answer and health you know\naltheanine for my stomach wasn't going\nto be the answer and\neven in the therapy\nthe therapeutic tools were no longer\nworking the meditation was no longer\nworking and finally i hit a massive\nbottom\njust four four months of not sleeping i\nactually missed a talk live talk it was\nthe first time\nin\nover a decade that i didn't show up\nbecause i hadn't slept the night before\nand then i finally reached out to a\nfriend who was a psychiatrist and i said\ni need help and he put me in touch with\na postpartum psychiatrist i saw her the\nnext day she diagnosed me within 10\nminutes she said you have postpartum\ndepression postpartum anxiety you have\nto get medicated\nand she saw all that resistance in me\nand she looked at me and these were the\nwords that helped me\nshe said this medication will give you a\nsafer baseline\nso that you can do the deeper trauma\nwork\nand those words just punctured me i just\nheard everything she said and i said\nokay all right i'll do it\nand i took that prescription and i went\ndown to the pharmacy and i stood in the\npharmacy with my husband i was like what\ndo i do i don't even know what to do\ni've never even fulfilled a prescription\nit's like you hand it to the pharmacist\nand i held that medication in my hand\nand the placebo effect
