    "transcript": "honestly i just want the obsessiveness\nto stop yes of course i want to lose the\nweight and i want to be happy in my body\ni want all these different things that\nare conflicting but the obsess if that\ncould just\nquite like my mind could quiet and i\ncould just stop thinking about it that\nwould be\nthe most ideal because\nthere are very dark days\nwhen\ni can't get out of my head\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to a very\nspecial episode of on purpose\nthis episode is brought to you by better\nhelp online therapy and today i'm joined\nby jesus\nlicensed marriage and family therapist\nand head of clinical operations at\nbetter help and in this new monthly\nseries we will be\nserving real listeners of the show and\nyou'll hear their stories the things\nthey struggle with and to get to sit in\non a real therapy session with the\nintention of letting you know that\nyou're not alone we're all struggling\nwith something even if we never show it\nand our goal is to bring more awareness\nto taking care of your mental health and\nprovide everyone the tools resources and\nencouragement they need to heal their\npast for a bright future\nnow the reason that i wanted to do this\nwas because i saw so many family members\nwho were still triggered by therapy\ntherapy is still has stigma in certain\ncultures certain backgrounds certain\nplaces around the world it's not been\nnormalized and i started to notice that\none of the biggest reasons was because\npeople had never sat in a therapy\nsession they were somewhat scared about\nit they were somewhat apprehensive\ntowards it and we can often be like that\nwe can see videos of pretty much\nanything in the world today even if\nyou've never been to a country or you've\nnever done an activity chances are you\ncan find it somewhere and watch it but\nit's very rare to be invited into a\ntherapy session because they're so\npersonal and vulnerable and that's why i\nwant to give a special thanks to our\nvery special guest today jamie who's\nbeen so kind enough\nto allow us into this space to allow us\nto hear her story as an open book as air\nsue our incredible therapist guides her\nthrough this discussion so please give\njamie a big warm welcome jamie thank you\nfor being here thank you for doing this\nyes thank you for being here thank you\nfor doing this thanks for having me\nreally grateful to both of you for\nmaking time i\nyou know it's been a long term\nintention of mine to want to\nhelp people find more tools and\nresources and the fact that we get to\nhave this on the podcast where anyone\nand everyone is listening and watching\ncan get to sit in on someone else's\ntherapy session hopefully to\nfind their own path is is really really\nimportant so jesus i'm going to hand\nover to you we're in your trusted hands\ni'm going to be everyone is listening\nand watching i'm going to be you in this\nscenario so i'm going to be observing\nlistening taking mental notes reflecting\nand then sharing my reflections at the\nend as well so esu over to you thank you\njamie for coming here and leads me to\noften the very first question that most\npeople will hear in the therapy room\nlike what brings you to therapy today i\nhave for a very long time struggled with\nan eating disorder\nprobably since i was seven or eight i\nstarted to feel sort of the\nrepercussions of a family member my mom\nbeing\nthe person it's something that i've\nalways struggled with and i would say in\nthe past two years it got much worse i\nthink being in the pandemic and the idea\nthat we didn't see people and so when\nthe world started to slowly open up\nputting on clothes got really hard more\nso than you know what i was wearing all\nday every day and so\nthat's one sort of depression set in a\nlot deeper than it ever has been and um\nyeah it's it's been a hard couple of\nyears yeah i mean hard several years\nright yeah i mean you mentioned that\nthis\ndisordered eating began at seven years\nold that's very young can you tell me a\nlittle bit more about how you know that\nsomething about the way you were eating\nwas different at such a young age\nyeah i mean you know i think it was a\nlot of comments that sort of came at me\nin terms of\nyou shouldn't be eating this or you\nshould be eating this even at seven i i\nthink i started to notice other people's\nbodies and notice that i was developing\nbefore them and i know that seven years\nold is a young age to notice that but i\nthink i just always felt\nbigger in some way and when i\ni have this very visual memory of\nwearing the same outfit as one of my\nclose friends and wearing a top that\nshowed our stomachs and feeling as if i\njust like i wasn't good enough within my\nbody and so\nit's been a struggle in multiple ways um\nsince then well early on you are already\ngetting messaging\nof labeling of foods this is good this\nis bad\nand if i eat a bad food i don't know if\nyou're getting the messaging but i think\na lot of kids start feeling if i'm\neating bad food i'm a bad person and\nthat that can spiral into so many\ndifferent things\ncan you tell me a little bit more about\nthe actual eating habits that you have\nchallenges with like would you say it's\nunder eating overeating my eating habits\nare more in sort of the orthorexia\nsort of way of eating which is more just\nlike i'm very cognizant of eating\nhealthy or what i deem healthy\num and the idea that\ncertain foods are bad and so i have a\nlot of shame around food and so i would\nsay that\nhow many hours awake that i am\nthroughout the day there is usually\na time period in which i'm thinking\nabout my next meal should i be eating\nthis i actually really want this but\nlike\nthis isn't going to help me get to the\nplace that i want to get in terms of the\nway that i want to look my mind is\nconstantly thinking through that but\nfood wise it is really what i deem\nhealthy\ni would say that like i\ndon't overeat\nand i don't under eat it's kind of gone\nthrough phases and i think in the last\ncouple of years as like food has become\nmore charged in the way of like you know\nthere's always going to be a different a\ndiet there's always going to be like a\ndifferent way of eating even if they\ndon't deem it a diet i've definitely\nkind of\ncome into that especially\nmy background as i'm in the beauty\nindustry and so um\nyeah it's you know there's always things\nthat i could be trying but ultimately\nthat's not really good for me as someone\nwho is working through an eating\ndisorder\nright right so right now\nwanting to learn more about the picture\nof who you are here do you track what\nyou eat like what kind of ways do you\nmonitor what you consume currently\nno i don't but what i do\ndo is i make a list every week of\nall the foods i'm going to be eating the\nmeals i'm going to be making that's\nsomething i do every single week and the\nworkouts that i'm going to be doing so\nthat like i don't have to think twice\nabout\nsomething although that's not you not\nalways the case i've\nhad done a food diary which has been\nhelpful in the past but ultimately it's\nreally just sticking to sort of like the\nregimen that i've made sort of like my\nown excel doc in i'm a virgo so\ni like to make a lot of lists um and so\nthat really just sort of is is yeah\nthat's sort of how i lay it out in terms\nof the way that i function yeah and\nyou're already familiar with orthorexia\nso i imagine you've also experienced at\ntimes like people don't recognize that\nthis could be disordered right because\nit looks like meal prepping i'm healthy\ni'm working out i'm planning my life out\nso at what point do you think you\nyou noticed\nthis is beyond just like being healthy\nand mindful i would say it was fairly\nrecent especially in the last two years\nand i think with i'm on social media\nquite a lot for your job i imagine for\nmy job but also i am just like i'm the\nperson who sits there and it's like i\nsee something interesting and i will\nclick and i'll go down that rabbit hole\nfollowing different people that i see\nand also with trying to bring up more\ntypes of bodies right now especially\nwith body positivity and you know just\nlooking at those different types of\nbodies i sort of started to see that\nlike\nwhat how people were talking about their\nown bodies and appreciating them i was\nlike wait but this isn't like the body\nthat i was shown when i was you know 15\nand the thing that i've wanted to\nemulate for so long and now other people\nyou know want this type of body that i\nmight not have wanted in the past and so\ni started to sort of see that a little\nbit but then i also had an experience a\ncouple of years ago where i\nworked with someone to get off of add\nmedicine\nand it wasn't\nthe right\nfit for for me to work with this person\nand\nit took away a lot of different foods\nwithin that within\neverything that i was eating and it sort\nof\nit got a lot harder for the eating\ndisorder and leaning off of the adh add\nmedication yeah not that the add\nmedication\nanyway sort of\nmade me feel different it was more of\nthe idea that i was taking off grains\nand all these different types of foods\nessentially to not have the brain fog\nand so because i was removing all that\nfrom my diet i saw i was losing weight\nand when i stopped working with this\nperson you know i kind of just did my\nold thing and so that really stressed me\nout where i saw myself gain more weight\nand the idea of that i knew that i had\nsuch a strict regimen before that i was\nlike there's something not right here\nbecause like i've never eaten\nunhealthy as i'm saying in quotes\nyou know on my terms but ultimately\nworking with this person was just the\nwrong fit it worsened my eating disorder\nand the idea of the orthorexia\npiece of that is just i think i came to\nunderstand that like\nthere was something wrong here so when\nyou mentioned um it has gotten worse in\nthe past couple of years\ncan you say more about what has gotten\nworse like you mentioned like you're\noften thinking about food what you're\ngonna eat next so when something is so\npervasive in our mind and it consumes\nall of our time that's like the one of\nthe first clues that it might be\nproblematic\nhow else has this manifested in your\nlife like other than just your thoughts\nyou know i\nfind myself especially in the past\ncouple of years\nsitting and moving in different ways so\nthat i don't have to feel the different\nparts of my body that i don't like\nwhether that's even going to bed and\nlying on my side and feeling as if\nsomething is touching me that i don't\nwant to actually feel and that i want to\nchange\ni will manipulate my body so that i\ndon't have to feel that way i also was\nwearing basically like the same outfit\nevery day during the pandemic and so i\nthink in some way that got me to a place\nthat i just\ni couldn't\nput on anything else because i didn't\nwant to know how tight something might\nbe i mean of course was hoping that it\nwould be much more loose on on myself\nwhen i tried something on but the idea\nthat it could be tight would send me\ninto a spiral and\ncould send me straight to my bed where\nessentially i don't want to talk to\nanyone i could be crying it really all\ndepends on sort of the situation and\ni'll also add that i am on\nantidepressants so\nif i happen to wake up the next morning\nbefore i take that antidepressant there\nhave been periods of time where i won't\ngo to take it immediately and i have a\npretty short period i've learned from\nthe time that i wake up to the time that\ni should be taking it where i can\nessentially sort of\nstay in you know this sort of like more\ncalm zone and so i wouldn't go take my\nmedication immediately and so it would\nthat chemical imbalance really showed\nitself and um\nmade it really hard to get out of bed\nand\nyou know sometimes my husband would have\nto pull me out of there and tell me to\ntake my medication\nwhich is exactly what i needed to do\nwhat medication are you taking now so i\ntake vibrate and i also take wellbutrin\nokay and so you're taking that regularly\nand do you see um a psychiatrist for\nthis or as a general practitioner yeah i\nsee a psychiatrist and how often do you\nsee them for check-ins that kind of\nstuff every three months every three\nmonths okay and you're happy with the\nservices that you're getting there yeah\ni have been on an antidepressant since i\nwas nine so i've changed up my\nantidepressants i've felt\na lot of shame and stigma being nine\nyears old and taking it and took it\nmaybe like a few times a week because i\njust didn't feel comfortable i didn't\nunderstand why i took the medication\nwhen i was 18\ni\nwent through something in college and\ndecided to take my medication and\nyou know it's it's funny because\nall the things you know that i worry\nabout with my body and the eating\ndisorder and the things that i want to\nget better my antidepressant has become\nlike this\nlight for me and is like this thing that\ni appreciate so much in my life it is\nit's been a really important piece to\nsort of my recovery and it's really\nimportant yeah with the medication you\nmentioned you've been taking it since\nyou were a child\num have you also been in therapy that\nwhole time or when did the therapy\njourney for you begin so i was put in\ntherapy at five which my mom claims was\nplay therapy so i don't really know what\nthat means but i do have this very\nstrong visual of me playing with toys on\na woman in a woman's office\nbut i was in therapy until i was 18\nand i hated it again i didn't understand\nwhy i was in it my therapist during high\nschool is the last one that i i really\nremember\nduring that time period and just didn't\nclick with her i didn't know what to say\nand i constantly\nwas being\ni was the one who had to talk you know\nthere wasn't much of a conversation\nwhich i i know that in therapy it's very\ndifferent for everyone and how everyone\nworks but it was really uncomfortable\nfor me and so i kind of swore off\ntherapy for a really long time yeah i\nmean that's understandable if you did\nnot know why you were there it sounds\nlike you were not there out of your own\nfree will\nwhich is like a huge component of going\ninto this process is like identifying\nwhat it is that you want to work on it's\ncomplicated with kids like kids are\ngoing to be put into therapy because\ntheir parents or their teachers are\nrecognizing some kind of behavioral\nissue yeah but as you mentioned and like\nput so well\na five-year-old is gonna have a really\nhard time understanding like why they're\neven coming here if they can have fun\nthat's great play therapy is a thing i\nlove it um\ni mean you touched on\nnot knowing why you're there there's no\nrationale\nthat was provided can you tell me a bit\nmore about what else you hated about it\nthat the therapy that you hated it's\nfunny because my my mom would say that\nthey would tell me things that i didn't\nwant to hear and so that's why i hated\nit which i think is just like that's the\nwhole gist of therapy\nthat's really why i hated it and i\ni didn't want to be told the things that\ni didn't even really understand about\nmyself i mean of course i understand\nthat now i asked my mom a few years ago\nlike why was i in therapy so young why\ndid you put me on an antidepressant and\nshe never really has a clear answer and\ni do want to caveat that like i am very\nclose with my mom and she's super\nsupportive you know she just did things\ni didn't understand and um\ni've come to kind of learn that i always\nreally wanted attention and i think that\nmaybe my parents\nteachers at school just like already\nalways sort of like saw that as like\nacting out i've always wanted attention\nalso for my body i wanted people to\npraise my body to tell me that like wow\nyou've lost weight or wow like you look\nso you look so great in those jeans like\nwhat have you done and i've never really\ngotten that and the only person i did\nget it from was my mom and it was the\none person i never wanted to hear it\nfrom and i still feel that way yeah i\ndon't even know if i answered your\nquestion i think i got far from that\nyeah i i'm trying to get a sense of like\nwhat about your past therapy experiences\nthat you really didn't like and\nmoving on from that it's like what from\nthese past experiences in therapy can\nyou recall enjoying like were there\npieces and components that you did like\nin um college\nwhen i started to take my antidepressant\nand sort of realize that i needed it i\nalso went to a therapist that happened\nto be like part of my college at the\ntime\nand um i saw not recommended by your mom\nshe probably told me to see a therapist\nbut she didn't have to say in who it was\num\nand i saw this woman and i remember\nreally liking her and also remembering\ncoming back and that she couldn't be my\ntherapist the next semester i think it\nwas because it felt more of a\nconversation she was asking me questions\nversus me constantly being like\nthis is what happened today or this is\nwhat's been going on in my life and i\ndon't think that i could articulate that\nas a kid i think i still want that\nconversation in a therapy session um i\ndon't think i would so much want you\nknow it would just be me but i think it\nwould be a lot easier now just as i've\ngrown as a person and sort of like know\nthe different things about me that\nobviously i didn't know then so now when\nyou're entering therapy something that\nis important to you is to be able to be\ninvolved in the conversation to have a\nvoice in what your goals are and what\nyou're working on\nand even just having some structure and\nguidance from the therapist to like move\ntowards something versus just like what\ndo you want to talk about today\nright now what would you say are your\nmain focuses and goals yeah i mean it's\nreally getting to a place where\ni can feel good in my body and i know\nthat that i've always said that i don't\nknow if that will ever come and there\nare days where that's even more in\ncharge then you know i'm saying that now\nis like i don't know if they'll ever\ncome but there are days where i'm like\nit will actually never come and so i\nwant to be able to be comfortable in the\nbody that i have in that moment\nto not feel as if like you know things\nfeel really hard eating feels really\nhard even though i'll i'll happily eat\nand i do\nenjoy food and even saying that is like\nhard for me to say\ni like get uncomfortable saying that\nbecause of the way that i feel about my\nbody and the idea that like i want to\nlook a certain way and so ultimately\nit's just like\nbeing okay because the amount of space\nthat food and my body takes up is\nis pretty terrifying\nis it ever debilitating yeah\nright it's like consuming all of your\nmental energy\nwould you say that like thinking about\nfood planning food avoiding food has\nthis gotten in the way of relationships\nor performance at work so i would say so\ni'm married and um\ni definitely\nwe have a a great relationship and\nwe\nhe's very supportive and sort of\nanything that i want to do but\nultimately yeah it can get in the way\nand i would even say that it gets in the\nway of libido\num granted i am on antidepressants and i\nknow that that\nlibido and antidepressants is you know\nnot a great mix or it doesn't mix but\nultimately\nif i don't feel good in my body like i\ndon't want anyone to touch me and i\nwould say that like i have a very hard\ntime\nbeing intimate in any way because i\ndon't even like want to feel my own body\nso\nbeing touched\nis uncomfortable even though it's coming\nfrom a supportive place\nand i'm working on that and it's really\nhard when you have someone who\ncares so much about you and\nloves you the way you are but\neven if he says that i'm beautiful or i\nlook great like\ni can't i can't take the compliment i\ncan't take it you don't see it yourself\nyou don't believe it and you know we've\nall heard that phrase of like i wish i\nyou could see yourself the way that i\nsee you and it sounds like that's the\nway that your loving and doting partner\nis\ncan you tell me\nabout the relationship between\nbody image and self-worth\nyeah i don't feel as if i'm worth a lot\nof different things in my life you know\ni\ni actually so something that i do is\nand this has only been in probably the\nlast six months is on my instagram i've\nbeen doing these um\nstream of consciousness posts i've never\nbeen a journaler\ni'm a writer so i don't know if that has\nanything to do with it but um\nall of a sudden i started to kind of\nthese certain memories sort of started\nto come up and so when that would come\nup i would go to my notes and just like\nquickly write down a paragraph of sort\nof the different things that are on my\nmind in terms of my eating disorder and\nyou asking about self-worth that's why\ni'm bringing this up is that i wrote a\npost recently saying that\nif i just was thinner i'd have more\nclients if i just were thinner you know\nso on and so forth and so my self-worth\nis\npretty depleted because i\ni rely so much on my body to do a lot of\nthe work in terms of making me feel\nbetter about what i'm doing\nyou have this\nthing that comes up of if i achieve a\nparticular body type then i just all\nthese negative feelings will go away\ni'll feel better about myself i'll learn\nhow to be happy with who i am like where\ndo those\nscripts come from for what is the ideal\nbody type can you say more about like\nwhat is your prototype like where does\nthat come from\ni mean i think it comes from my mom\num\nand i would say that's\na big part of that although she's told\nme for a really long time that i can't\nblame her anymore i haven't lived with\nher for years\nbut\ni\ni don't know where else it comes from to\nbe honest\num\nbut it's always stuck with me\nlike i have different like visuals and\nsort of memories of like\nbeing a kid and\nyou know whether i'm like trying on a\nfriend's jeans and the idea that they\ndon't fit me\nso like little things like that so that\nwould be an interesting exploration i\nthink for us to continue at some point\nyou know is just like figuring out where\nthis prototype comes from\nto dissect it because then once you\nreally understand it i think it makes it\na little bit more achievable to start\nletting it go\nto start unlearning that so you can\nrelearn and recompose a different\nideal body which might be the one that\nyou're in right now\ni think it's fair to want to achieve\ncertain things whether that's increased\nstrength better balance more stamina\nmore endurance having personal goals\nlike are important so i think it's good\nfor you to think about like\ngoals that are separate from i want to\nlose 8 pounds it's not really about the\nweight it's i want to be able to go up\nthese stairs and not get winded\nfor you it is i'm hearing a lot about\nbody image not so much about like\nfitness\nis that right yeah i mean i'm\ni work out five to six times a week and\nso\ni've come to learn that like the working\nout piece is the consistent part\nand also working out sometimes i'll i\ncan you know\nthat can stress me out too if i see\nsomething on my body that i don't like\nthat i almost i want to stop working at\ni want to quit but i keep moving through\nit so i'm usually working out for i'm\nnot\ni always say that like i work out\nbecause i think it mentally makes me\nfeel better but honestly like it doesn't\nreally help with my stress it doesn't\nhelp with like my depression it's just\nsomething that i know i need to do to\nhave a better day but ultimately like\nall the other things are still going to\nbother me\nbut i always think about food as being\nthe thing that like that is what's going\nto make a difference and that that's\ncome pretty recently knowing that like\nthe food is gonna be the thing that's\ngonna be the difference it's not that\nlike you know the 30 minutes that i\nworked out on monday i should have done\nan hour and that i had i felt that\ndifferently in the past but those things\nhave changed a little bit\nsomething that i think would be\ninteresting for both of us is like as we\ncontinue forward and have more\nconversations\nredefining goals right it sounds like\neverything\nwhen it comes to food when it comes to\nyour exercise routine and training your\nbody it's it's it all comes back to like\nhow you look so my hope and sense is\nthat someday you'd like to also\nincorporate goals around\nhealth\n[Music]\nyeah and\nyou know i write about that i mean i\njust wrote an article about metabolic\nhealth you know like these are things\nthat i'm researching and looking into\nall day long and some of those things\nare things that i might want to try but\ni also know that like these types of\nthings like you know talking about a\nglucose monitor that like that would\nprobably be\nmight be dangerous for me at this point\nand i might have not realized that\nyou know a couple of years ago it might\nhave been something that i just sort of\nlike did immediately and not to say that\na glucose monitor is dangerous i think\nthey can be really helpful for people\nbut for me as someone who is already\nlike\nlooking at what thinking about what i'm\neating at all times and the idea that\ni'd have to check back into something\nand be like more accountable than maybe\ni\nam sometimes that it's just there's\nit could be more stressful right you're\ni mean you're you're describing not\nwanting to become more obsessive about\nthis thing that's already kind of\nimpacting in a negative way a lot of\nareas of your life and\nyou know i'm also there's like a theme\nemerging here there's a lot of\nconflicting things in your life there's\nlike\na career that's that's really like in\nthe world of body positivity but you\nyourself are not feeling like that\nper se even the stuff that you're\nwriting for work\ni think people might have a different\nperception of the person that writes\nthis when they're reading it right it's\nlike maybe a persona almost it's not\nquite who i'm seeing here\nit's not a first person piece so\nthey probably don't you know they're not\nnecessarily focused on the person who's\nwriting it so much so you know something\nthat you said about the obsessiveness of\nsort of the eating and also with how we\nwere talking about how like i like want\nto feel good in my body but i also want\nto like lose the weight you know that\ntype of thing i think honestly i just\nwant the obsessiveness to stop\nyes of course i want to lose the weight\nand i want to be happy in my body i want\nall these different things that are\nconflicting but the obsess if that could\njust\nquite like my mind could quiet and i\ncould just\nstop thinking about it that would be\nthe most ideal because\nthere are very dark days\nwhen\ni can't get out of my head yeah so\nthat's our goal\nkind of zeroing in on this thing that\nhas taken over your mind space\nand then you know as we work on those\nkinds of things other stuff begins to\nunfold and\ni really really appreciate you being so\nopen and answering all these questions\nso honestly because i think it helped us\nidentify something here which is what\nyou really want first is to address the\nobsessiveness yeah\nthe racing thoughts the rumination the\ndwelling you know totally and i think\nas someone who's like pretty you know\ndoing those instagram posts and\nyou know i actually i talk about to ment\npeople about their own mental health all\nday as\ni have my own mental health platform\nit's something that i created with my\nhusband because we wanted to be able to\ntell other people's stories to make them\nnot feel so alone\nand it's\nfunny to think that that not funny but\nit's\nyou know i i struggle so much and i\nthink that\nthe idea that i have these conversations\nwith people\nhas helped me to feel not so alone but\num yeah ultimately it's it's just\nmy i don't i don't really know how i do\nall my other work because my brain is\nconstantly thinking about my body yeah\nhe said not funny probably some irony\nright\nyes sir and jamie thank you so much for\nthat uh jamie thank you for being so\nhonest and open and\nyou know really letting us in i think i\nwas of course listening as all of our\nlisteners and viewers and\nyou know hearing someone who's so\nopen allows me to\nhave the same reflections about the\nvoice that's in my head i think you\narticulated so many things so\neffectively and so\nwonderfully genuinely that\nallowed me to articulate\ncertain experiences and emotions that i\nhave about some similar things that\nyou've raised\nthat's only possible because you were\nwilling to go there\nand i'm hoping that everyone's been\nlistening and watching i i can\ndefinitely say that i think you've\nhelped a lot of people today\nbecause you've just shown us the the\nbreadth of the human mind\nwhere it can go what it can experience\nand because you've been doing that work\nto understand yourself\nall of us who may not have the words or\nthe voice to kind of piece them together\nwe're hearing that through you i know i\nknow i definitely was um so thank you\nfor that personally\ni i want to help unpack a little bit of\nwhat we've done today because you've\nboth met for the first time today\nuh es who had no\nbackground on you jamie right\nand you had no background as well so\nthis has been a real genuine interaction\nand conversation of real discovery\njamie how long have you been going to\ntherapy for\nat the moment or as in not since the\ndays you didn't enjoy going but more\nrecently the past six months okay so\nit's been six months since\nthat time from\n5 to 18 that you didn't enjoy therapy to\nreconnect there was a couple of like\nshort like two month period where i\ntwo month period long sort of therapy i\nwould try someone new and i'm like no\nthis isn't good and then it might be\nlike four years and i would do it again\nso i would say in between sort of like\n18 until now there might have been like\nthree different therapists that i saw\nfor like a month or two and now you're\nin this six month commitment\nphase it sounds like with a bit more it\nsounds like a bit more regularity and\nconsistency\nwhat has\nbrought you to that now and what\nbenefits are you seeing from the last\nsix months yeah um i what brought me to\nit was that uh it was\ngetting harder to get out of bed i guess\ni don't even know if i know like the\nquite the meaning of this term because i\ndon't think i had suicide ideation but\nthe i i would lay in bed and think that\nlike i don't think i need to be here i'm\nso unhappy with how i feel and how i\nlook maybe i'm just not meant to be here\nand so\nmy husband had been telling me to go see\na therapist for a while and i think\nmaybe the last time that i i thought\nabout sort of the idea of me not being\nhere was when i\ni said okay i'll look for someone and it\nwasn't you know the next day i went and\nlike found someone it was kind of like a\nlittle bit of a lull\ntrying to find someone that also could\nspecialize in eating disorders which i\nhad never had i\ni don't exactly know what my therapist\nwas when i was in high school but\nyou know it was kind of just talking\nabout like everything that was going on\nin my life\nso that's what i've been focused on the\nlast six months yeah would you say\nthere's been any any skills that you've\ndeveloped over that six months or\nanything you feel that\nyou mark as progress for yourself\nsort of talking to her in this the\nperson that i'm seeing in this ongoing\nbasis has allowed me to\nfind a couple of coping skills\nit's not something that like it's so\nhard and set that i'm like okay i need\nto do but a lot of breathing helps and\nnot even like i'm not talking breath\nwork i'm just talking about like talking\nto myself saying like okay i need to\nwalk away from this or i have to go\nfinish this thing\nthat was something that i had to do a\nlot of when i was just on vacation a\ncouple of weeks ago because it was the\nfirst time i had\nworn a bathing suit in a long time and\nworn different things that i hadn't worn\nin the past year or so and so i had i\nwas really scared to go on that vacation\nas exciting\nas it was because i didn't want\nmy stress and anxiety and panic to get\nin the way\nof my husband and i having a good time\nand i was able to get through that\nthank you for sharing that and uh essay\nas well for you like\nwhen just to give people a bit of an\ninsight when you're meeting\na new prospective client or someone that\nyou're having a conversation with in\nthis\nsituation what what are you trying to do\nlike what is your process because i\nthink just for\nyou know obviously here we have jamie\nwho's very happy to be open and she's\nbeen so kind and letting us in\na lot of people who may be listening and\nwatching may be just like well how do i\nbe so open with a stranger and like i i\ndon't know if i feel comfortable and\njust to let them in a bit to your\nprocess what are you trying to do\nof course i think you're you have a you\nknow a wonderful skill at making someone\nfeel comfortable and not being invasive\nyou are very protective of someone's\nsafety and how far they want to go but\ncould you help us understand a bit more\nof that yeah great question i think um\nyou know initially the big thing for\nmany therapists if not most i hope all\nis to build rapport it's like it's part\nof our textbook training is like\nif this person doesn't feel safe it's\nnot about them trusting you as an\nindividual it's do they feel safe in\nthis room\ndo they feel an absence of danger from\nyou like these are big things for me so\nyou know there are techniques right it's\nlike about the\nloudness of your voice like mirroring\nyour client's body language um just kind\nof being really in tune with\nhow quickly they're breathing so a lot\nof non-verbal cues\nso initially it's very much about\nlistening to understand versus listening\nto respond\nwhich is what we all do in conversation\nright we're just wanting to make sure\nwe're like keeping up or whatever it is\nbut for me it's it's\nreally wanting to understand start to\npaint a picture of who you are not just\nthis person sitting in front of me but\nthe kid that existed that grew up into\nwho you are now and\nthe parents that raised this person and\nall these dynamics so of course we\ndidn't have like a full session today\nand normally in my assessment process\nwhen i'm first getting to know a client\ni'm trying to get as much info about\nfamily dynamics if you weren't raised by\nyour biological parents than finding a\nlit bit more about like what that\nsituation looked like and that's because\nof my approach as a therapist it is\nimportant for me to kind of start poking\naround childhood and i always ask my\nclients are you comfortable with this\nbecause some clients don't want to go\nthere\nand it's not necessary you don't have to\ngo there to start learning some real\nskills to start coping with today's\nchallenges\nbut when my clients do let me in there\ni'll definitely want to go down that\nrabbit hole\nbecause there's just so much stuff that\nhappened to us as children that we\ndidn't understand at the time meaning we\nprobably still don't understand it now\nso having a space now to process it\nconnect it with our current emotions and\nrelationship styles the ways that we\nattach with other people that becomes\nvery important to me there's something\nthat therapists do that i'm sure\neverybody's aware of if they've been in\ntherapy is paraphrasing is\nsaying back to you essentially what you\njust said\nmaybe rewording it a little bit and\nmaybe adding like a little bit of my own\ninsight here and there\nand this creates the experience of like\nshe really heard me you know she's not\nputting her own\nstuff into this she just wants to\ncontinue hearing me and seeing me and\nthat's that's definitely a big intention\nof mine is i want this person to feel\nvalidated\nif you know sometimes that might be the\nfirst time somebody's really felt seen\nin that way\num my hope always for a new client and\neven more seasoned clients like more\nestablished clients is that they know\nthat when they come to see me it's\nalways still going to be about them\ni'm not ever going to flip the\nconversation to make it about me\nyou know therapists sometimes use\nsomething called self-disclosure which\nis just like\ngiving you some nuggets about who i am\nand you have to be really intentional\nabout doing that and it's very clear\neven if the client can't articulate\nwhat's going on when a therapist is like\noverly using self-disclosure for\nreasons that aren't very productive or\nleading to\nanything good for the client clients\nknow that they can feel it something\nabout the session doesn't feel right\nwhen they leave they don't feel as\nsatisfied\nso that's like some of the initial\nprocess very useful yeah i think those\nare really useful insights\nfor people to\nbe aware of what it feels like what it\nlooks like why someone is doing that\nlike you said it may feel strange in\nyour first session is to like why does\nthis person keep repeating what i'm\nsaying but there's a reason for it you\nknow there's a reason to try and listen\nin i want to ask you both one last\nquestion and of course happy for you to\nshare anything that's on your heart or\nmind\njamie for you as someone who's had you\nknow a variety of different therapy\nexperiences without choice now with\nchoice\neven the idea of people often refer to\nthe idea of dating is like finding a\ntherapist like you're kind of like oh\ntwo months okay nope okay yeah right uh\nwhat would you say are some things that\nwere important to you or that if people\nare listening and watching and they're\nin that process that you could say here\nthese are things that worked for me\nthese are things that i was looking for\nif there were three things that were\nvery important that helped you find\nsomeone that you now were consistently\nseeing for six months specialty was\nreally important and i would say that\nthere are a lot it is\nharder to filter eating disorders is\nwhat i've noticed in my experience of\nlooking for someone so\ngetting\nas specific as possible if that's what\nyou're needing therapy for depending on\nwhere what you're going\nwhat you're doing but um\nyeah that specialty was really important\nto me\nbefore i found the therapist what i'm\nseeing now i spoke to someone else and\nso\nand it was necessary to kind of go\nthrough that process of\ntalking to someone and realizing this\nisn't you know she was like a little too\nsoft-spoken for me and sort of also\nunderstanding what i need from like a\nconversation sort of perspective is that\ni need someone who will also\nyou know talk back to me give me the\nadvice versus say like what's on your\nmind today and so i've i kind of was\ntaking notes as i was going through the\nprocess of finding a therapist that like\ni really like it when\nshe gives me this feedback and that was\nreally important and that was something\nthat absolutely didn't happen from you\nknow being\na kid until i was 18 and having those\ndiscussions with my therapist then yeah\nthat's great i i find that really useful\ni even think\neven making someone aware of that is so\nuseful hey is there anything that\nclients make you aware of any questions\nthey ask you that you think actually\nimproves their relationship if if there\nare people today who are like oh wow i\nneed to go and find a therapist i've\nbeen really inspired by this\nconversation what are some of the things\nyou as a therapist would say hey\nplease ask your therapist this question\nor please let your therapist know this\nthat actually could speed up that\nopportunity to finding the right person\nwhat a great question and at some point\ni did ask you like were there things\nabout your previous therapy experiences\nthat you liked because i was trying to\nget to that i was trying to get at\nwhat can i take from what you've done\nbefore and keep doing the good stuff\nlike take the good stuff keep doing that\nso it is greatly appreciated i think by\nmany therapists when clients come\nprepared with those questions like\ninitially you should interview your\ntherapist like you're hiring them and\nultimately you can also fire them like\nthat's what happens when you decide you\ndon't want to work with them anymore\ni think finding a specialist is also\nextremely important i thought that was a\ngreat point yeah because someone can be\nreally really good at working with\nclients with anxiety and workplace\nstress but if they have someone coming\nto them with concerns around orthorexia\nthat's gonna be very challenging for the\ntherapist because they're not well\neducated or trained yeah you know\nsomebody that specializes means they're\ngoing to additional trainings they may\nhave gotten certified in something\nthey've um you know began\nsupervision or consultation with like\nsomebody that's also master\nin this kind of world which just means\nthey've worked in it so long that they\nidentify recognize patterns of behavior\nin a particular group of people\nand so from there you can\nstart thinking about really specific\ncoping skills\nspecific\nways to help people build those skills\nto help cope with life because somebody\nthat's like really good at getting you\nto think about how to cope with\nworkplace stress is not really going to\nunderstand like but you're meal prepping\nthat's a good thing right you know so\nit's okay for clients to ask all their\nquestions about the therapist and come\nto the conclusion that they're not the\nright person because that's what the\ntherapist wants too\nwe have a code of ethics to keep the\npublic safe and one of those pieces is\nyou are not to work with clients that\nare outside of your scope of competence\nright like if i have zero training\nexposure and understanding of any eating\ndisorders it would be a disservice to\nyou\nto try to work with you through this\nthing that i don't really know much\nabout\ni didn't say a specific question but\nclients please feel\nyou know that you have the permission of\ncourse you should be asking questions\nand interviewing this person to see if\nthey're a good fit for you yeah yeah i\nactually think that's a really great\npiece of feedback because often people\nthink of therapists as their authority\nand so there's a sense of like oh no\nthis person's going to tell me\nbut actually in the beginning before\nyou're being guided\nthere is this interview process of\nmaking sure the person is compatible and\nyeah and right for you and it took me a\nlong time to get there that's what i\nmean yeah yeah like i'm in my 30s now\nand you know the last time i saw someone\nfor like two months at a time i\nwas in my 20s and definitely didn't ask\nany question i just was kind of like all\nright i'm just gonna go in and\ni'll hear what this person has to say\nbut yeah that was a learned skill for\nsure yeah are there any final words that\neither of you want to share with our\ncommunity or our audience today or each\nother\nuh because i'm feeling extremely\ngrateful for this opportunity jamie\nyou've let us in and i'm hoping that\nthis conversation has been\nuseful\nto you\nuh in moving you forward toward your\ngoals i'm obviously hoping that this\nrelationship continues you know jesus i\nthink you've been so kind as well and\ngenerous with your time to to truly sit\nwith jamie and and help guide this\ndiscussion as well and your insights\ntowards the end there but any last few\nwords from from either of you i would\njust say that you know like i think the\nreason that i've become because i know\nthat it's not it's not easy to talk to a\ntherapist or talk to anyone about your\nmental health and what's going on and\ni well i said i've always been an open\nbook and really vulnerable it's only\nbeen the past couple years that i've\nopenly talked about sort of my\nantidepressant or my eating disorder and\nultimately i just want to say that i do\nthat because i want to help people feel\nnot so alone and that's also why like i\nsaid i had started and repeat with my\nhusband our mental health platform but\nthe thing is is i'm going through it as\ni'm talking to all these people so\nthank you and thank you for both having\nme\nno you're definitely\nhelping people not feel alone and\nyour vulnerability is definitely helping\nthis community so thank you so much\nall the more thank you thank you thank\nyou because you know therapists for\nyears decades\nhave been wondering how to solve this\nproblem of how do we get more people to\nunderstand that this is something that\nanybody can benefit from it's really\nlike this boom in the past like five\nyears or so where it's becoming a bit\nmore normalized to talk about mental\nhealth\nand that conversation is only going to\nkeep propelling in that direction\nbecause of people like you because of\npeople that are willing to speak on\nthese things and be so open and\nvulnerable so i am very grateful to you\nyou have a whole like thousands of\ntherapists saying go to therapy go\nthrough but it's not as powerful\nas a real live person who's not a\ntherapist talking about the benefits\nthat they've had so i really appreciate\nyou and your time too\nthanks yeah i want to thank everyone\nwho's been listening and watching\nwherever you are in the world and\ni'm hoping that this conversation this\nlive therapy session that you got to\nwatch has encouraged you maybe taken\naway some of those barriers taken away\nsome of those\nboundaries that you've created towards\ntherapy and made them easier for you to\ncross or maybe sharing this with a\nfriend or family member who may have\nbarriers or boundaries of their own and\nthey can see how each and every one of\nus\ncan share our space our time our energy\nand learn a bit more about ourselves and\neven if that's all we achieve from that\ntime how powerful it can be\nin this journey of life and so i want to\nremind everyone\nuh to keep coming back for these\nepisodes where we will be\ndiving into a live therapy session so\nthat you can get that
