last episode you'll\nremember we've really got into how\ndoctors can differ and change their\nperspective about how they view their\nclients and patients and of course today\nwe're talking about his brand new book\nwhich i'm going to hold up the\nvirtual digital version which is the\nworld we live in now happy mind happy\nlife\nand i really really hope that all of you\ngo out and grab a copy of this book 10\nsimple ways to feel great every day\nrongan it's great to have you on the\npodcast again it's great to see you\nhonestly congratulations on this\namazing book\nand all your incredible success and i\ncan't wait for people to read it but\nthank you for coming to talk to me about\nit jay thanks for having me on for a\nsecond time your show's fantastic it's a\nreal honor i'm looking uh really looking\nforward to this conversation yeah me too\nme too and when i was reading your book\ni\nlove how you're changing the way\nwe perceive doctors and how doctors\nperceive patients it's like this really\ninteresting\ncycle of\nhere's a doctor\ntalking about happiness\nand how happiness is at the core of our\nhealth\nand that was one of the things i really\nappreciated when you last came on when\nyou were talking about when you often\nsee your patients you ask them what how\nmany times do you see your friends how\nmany times a week do you get to gather\nwith the people that you love and i was\nthinking wow this is really a fresh\nperspective and you've done it again\ni want to dive straight in you talk\nabout this connection between health and\nhappiness\ni want to start off trying to understand\nbecause often we find that pursuing\nhappiness is actually bad for our health\nas well so how are you seeing it\ndifferently\ni'm not necessarily saying that we\nshould be pursuing happiness directly i\nthink happiness\nis a byproduct\nwhen we do\nthe right things there are all kinds of\nthings that we can focus on on a daily\nbasis and if we do those things\nwe can talk about some of those later\nfor sure\ni think happiness comes as a side effect\nof that so it's not really i think the\ndestination we should be aiming to get\nto directly it's more\nthe kind of direction we might want to\ntake in life it's it's something that i\nthink we do want\nbut it's becoming quite unfashionable\nthese days to talk about happiness and\nthat really really interests me but in\nterms of the relationship between\nhappiness and health\nfor me as a doctor it's always how can i\nget to the root cause of my patients\nproblems right\nyes what symptoms have they got but\nactually\nwhat's\ngoing on behind that so they might come\nin with a headache or a migraine and\nsure\ni can diagnose them and tell them what\nthat is but\ni want to help them understand well what\nis going on in your life and your\nlifestyle that might be contributing to\nthis and for many years i have said\npublicly on many occasions that\nabout 80 percent of what we see as\ndoctors is in some way related to our\ncollective modern lifestyles\nbut then i began to wonder a few years\nago jay well\nis lifestyle the root cause and when i\nsay lifestyle i mean things like food\nmovement sleep and relaxation\nand i thought\nis this something that's even more\nimportant even more upstream\nand that has consumed me for a few years\nand i really think there is it's our\nhappiness and our mental well-being so\nwhen we are happier\nwith our lives and in our lives\nwe naturally become healthier and i\nthink there's two main reasons for that\nhappier people so people who are more\ncontent if you're more in control of\ntheir life who are living more in\naccordance with their values\nactually they naturally make better\nlifestyle choices so if you feel good\nabout who you are and what you're doing\nin life\nyou're less likely\nto feel the need\nto comfort eat and open that box of\nchocolates in the afternoon to get you\nthrough you're less likely to dive into\nthe tub of ice cream in front of the\nsofa in the evening you're less likely\nto open a beer or half a bottle of wine\nto help you drown your sorrows\nif you feel happier and more content so\ni think that's one component our\nlifestyle choices become better and it\nbecomes much easier but i think that's\nanother component as well research shows\nus there was a study um called the none\nstudy and they followed nuns across the\nduration of their life and essentially\nonce you had controlled for lifestyle so\nsame diets same sleep patterns same\nexercise habits what you'd control for\nthat the happier nuns lived longer and\nthey were healthier\nright so it's independently linked with\ngood health outcomes as well and i've\nseen this with my patients jay that if i\ncan help them think differently but if\nyou're someone who allows the actions of\nother people\nto overly influence how you feel you\nknow an email from your boss makes you\nfeel really angry and annoyed and you\ndon't know how to process that that is\ncreating stress and tension in your body\nthat is also\nabsolutely relevant to your health and\nyour health outcomes and we don't think\nof that people don't realize i think or\nnot enough of us to realize certainly i\nwould say with the public but also\nwithin my profession that\nan inability to forgive\nholding on to anger and resentment\nholding on to hostility is absolutely\nassociated with all kinds of negative\nhealth outcomes autoimmune disease heart\ndisease cancer you know strokes all\nkinds of things so\nwhat do i want to do as a doctor i want\nto help people and i know i i'm going to\nbe able to help them better if i can\nhelp them become happier\nthe reason why we're\nunhappy and it would be interesting to\ngo down that path because the reason why\nyou're working on these things the\npatients that you work with why you\nwrote this book is because\nwe are to some degree\nunhappy\nor dissatisfied or discontent with who\nwe are\nand we don't know what our values are\nbecause we've never been trained and\neducated as to how to develop them\nand we don't know how to be aligned with\nourselves because we don't even know\nwhat that means we never really were\nexposed to that vocabulary or those\nwords up until the last few years even\nin mainstream society when you're\nlooking at the root of our unhappiness\nwhere is that root of our unhappiness\nthat you're seeing it come from i think\nmuch of it\ncomes from society\nand\nthis idea of what success is right so i\nthink one of the big problems is is that\nwe confuse success and happiness\nnow success and happiness can\noverlap for sure\nbut more often than not they don't\nhappiness is happiness success is\nsuccess and unless you intentionally go\nthrough\na process to actually define what those\nthings are for you\nyou're going to end up chasing society's\nidea more money a better holiday a nicer\nphone you know a better hotel when you\ngo and stay away with your family or\nyour partner right i'm not saying those\nthings are necessarily wrong\nthe problem is is if we chase them too\nmuch at the expense of what our\nhappiness is and many of us fall into\nthat truck i have fallen into that trap\njay right i have absolutely you know i\nstart off the book i think\nwith a very powerful story about my\ndad's you know dad was\nyou know he grew up in india he came\nover to the uk in the 1960s in search of\na better life for him and his family yes\nus here in the uk but also for his\nfamily back home in india\nand dad worked incessantly you know dad\nwas a doctor there was all kinds of\ndiscrimination he faced he had to change\nspeciality because actually\nyou know he was unable to progress in\nthe speciality that he wanted many\nindian doctors will tell you this story\nfrom the 1960s in the uk there was a\nglass ceiling for you you couldn't go\npast a certain point\nsudan moves speciality to help provide\nsecurity and stability for us as a\nfamily when dad was consultant\nmy dad's life for 30 years\nwas he would\ndo his job\nin manchester with infirmary as a\nconsultant physician\nin the day\nand\nthree to four nights a week my dad\nwouldn't sleep at all so he'd come home\nat 5 30 in the evening or 6 p.m in the\nevening\nmom would give him dinner he'd go\nupstairs and shave and then there'd be a\ncar picking him up at 7 pm and their dad\nwould be off all night he'd come back\nthe following morning at 7 00 a.m again\nhave breakfast shave again i remember he\nwould he would shave twice a day\ngo to work\ndad did this for 30 years and here's the\nproblem jay\nmy whole adult life\nuntil nine years ago when my dad died\nwas being a carer for my dad i moved\nback to the northwest of england to help\nmum and my brother look after dads this\nkind of idea of what success is\nit killed my dad he chased it he got it\ni had a fantastic education\nright i couldn't want for a better\neducation\nbut i never saw my dad's\nyou know my dad died very very early in\nthe last 15 years of his life were hell\ni think that story whilst potentially\nnot as extreme for some people there\nwill be people right now jay who love\nyour content who are listening to this\nshow or watching it\nand probably thinking yeah i'm i sort of\ni love my job but\nmaybe i'm working a bit too hard and i'm\ni'm kind of sacrificing the things in my\nlife that are really important so i kind\nof feel\nsociety\ngives us a false idea of happiness you\nknow we think happiness j is that\nbillboard you know that billboard image\nof the smiling couple\non the beach with their children with\nthe ocean behind them we think that's\nhappiness no that's not happiness that's\na a pleasurable experience that can form\npart of a happy life no doubt\nbut that's not happiness\nyou know i've got two young kids\nlike i've got an 11 year old son and 9\nyear old daughter\nand\nyou know all of us i think as kids\nyounger than that when we're really\nyoung\nwe've got that inner happiness\nyou know we're\npresent we're in the moment we're\nplaying\nmaybe with our siblings maybe with our\nfriends we're not worrying about the\nfuture we're not fretting about the past\nwe're right there in the moment so that\nhappiness is there inside us but\nsomewhere along the line in the book i\ncall it the adulthood contract we sign\nthis adulthood contract\nand things start to go wrong and i\nalready see it with the kids like school\ndoesn't teach us how to be happy\ni don't think many of our parents teach\nus how to be happy society doesn't teach\nus how to be happy in fact society\nprobably\nteaches us the wrong lessons about what\nhappiness really is\nand that's the key message behind this\nbook jay is to help people understand\nthat happiness is a skill\nor it's a skill that you can practice\njust as if you\ngo to the gym and you do bicep curls\nevery day you're going to have bigger\nbiceps\nwell\nyou know my contention is\ni feel i've broken down the skill of\nhappiness into 10 very easy steps to\npeople and\nif they practice them a little bit\nthey're going to be a little bit happier\nand as they become happier they're going\nto become healthier as well\nabsolutely thank you so much for sharing\nthat story as well about your father\nwhich really you know encapsulate this\nidea really well i think for me\nwhen i think about what happiness means\nto me happiness is\nthe as you said ability\nthe ability to know how to navigate\nuncomfortable\nand uncertain times\nbecause when you know what you have to\ndo\nit's more important than wanting to know\nhow things will end up so we think our\nhappiness is well how will this end up\nhow will what will the result of this be\nwill that make me happy\nand to me actually go no actually\nhappiness to me is knowing what to do\nright now in the moment and having that\nsense of reflection and introspection\nand the stillness\nto be able to carry that out because the\nsearch as you said for that billboard\nhappiness that's out there that's a\nprojection again a societal projection\nwe're trying to invent and create that\nin a world that doesn't allow for that\nevery day or at every moment and so\nknowing what to do in the moment to me\nis where happiness begins of knowing how\nto behave how to think and what to do\nand that's what these 10 habits do you\nbreak down what you call\ncore happiness as a three-legged stool\ncontentment alignment and control i want\nto go through each of these\nbecause they form the tenets of these\nthese 10 habits or principles you give\nus\nbut let's let's start with contentment\nand you describe contentment here i've\ngot it in the book\nfeeling content means being at peace\nwith your life\nand your decisions that's really hard\nbecause most of us when we look back\nespecially at the past we think wow i've\nmade a lot of bad decisions i wish i\ntried that thing\ni wish i never went out with that person\nwell i should have left that job a lot\nearlier so most of us actually have a\nvery negative view of our\ndecision-making process\nlet's talk a bit about decisions\nespecially decisions of the past that we\nregret how do we create contentment\naround those\nspecifically around decisions in the\npast if\nyou know we have a deep regret let's say\nor i wish i'd done something differently\ni think the first step is to really try\nand get to a place of acceptance you\nwere doing the best that you could at\nthat time with what you knew\nright if you could have done it\ndifferently you would have\nand\nyou know it depends how deep you want to\ngo with this but\ncertainly for me\none of the things that's really helped\nme with my happiness and my contentment\nin particular\nis real acceptance of every single thing\nthat has ever happened to me or i have\ndone whether it's something i'm proud of\nwhether it's something i'm not proud of\nor it's something that actually i could\nmake a case that i made the wrong\ndecision\nnow actually\ni made the very best decision for my\ngrowth because actually if i look back\nnow and see that it was potentially a\nnegative\nit's about reframing it to go\noh what did i learn from that\nwhat did i learn from that\noh i never would have learned that had\nthat not happened had i not gone to that\njob\nthat i didn't like\nyou know i can think of one particularly\nin my mind you know early on in my\ncareer as a doctor i was like i worked\nin a practice that i hated the framework\nand the structure there right i would\nget frustrated i would come home and\ncomplain to my wife every day she kept\nsaying hey babe you know if you don't\nlike it why don't you leave them i can't\nleave you know this is it pays us money\nit does this you know\nstory i created this kind of almost like\na victim story around it you know and i\nknow the word victim\ncan be very triggering for people and i\ndon't mean it to be certainly talking\nabout my own experience\nwhat i've learned jay\nis that you can always write a different\nstory\nabout any event in life\nyou've always got a choice in what story\nyou put onto something and you can\npractice this and train it so\none of my sort of tips for people is in\nany bit of friction you encounter in\nlife see if you can choose a happiness\nstory around it\nand there's a couple of ways that we can\nthink about this so you know if we\nremember back to march 2020 when the\nwhole world was sort of going into\nlockdown and people were getting scared\nthere was lots of images of supermarket\nshelves being empty and there'd be no\ntoilet roll there right so these are big\nheadlines and the amount of people who\nwere like criticizing i can't believe\nthis who's doing this you know who's\ntaking more\nokay you can tell yourself that story\nfor sure\nbut you can also see if you can write a\ndifferent story around the same\nsituation so\nokay what was going on there well could\nit have been that every shop at that day\ntook one extra roll and so by the end of\nthe day\nthe supermarket shelves are empty okay\nthat's possible could it be that\nactually one person went in and yes they\ndid buy loads and loads of packets\nbecause actually\nthey look after four elderly\ngrandparents and actually they're really\nworried about what's going to happen\nmaybe it was someone who actually went\nin and they wanted to buy as much as\nthey could and sell it on ebay\nokay how did you create happiness story\nthough ah\nyou know what what must be going on in\ntheir life\nmaybe they really don't have any money\nmaybe they are so desperate they don't\nfeel they've got any opportunities in\nlife and actually this is an opportunity\nfor them that they've seen to make a bit\nof money\nyou know what i've realized when it\ncomes to most bits of friction in our\nlife\nthe truth actually doesn't matter jay\nfor your happiness the truth doesn't\nmatter write a happiness story that\nworks for you\nand this is something i try my best to\ndo it's probably the thing that's had\nthe most impact on my\nfeeling of contentment\nis that every day if i get a bit of\nsocial friction let's say someone leaves\na negative comment on my social media\nfor example\nright instead of wishing it was other\nthan the way it was\noh i can't believe they acted like that\nit's like ah okay let me go through a\nprocess here you know number one is\nthere any truth to this\nuh okay yeah there's a bit of truth here\ni can learn here i've been given an\nopportunity to learn if there's no truth\nhere\noh well why is this bothering me and\nit's like putting the mirror up and\ninstead of looking out there it's like\nwhat is being triggered within me is it\nmy insecurity is it my needs to be liked\nand loved you know what is it because\nthen you start to take control of the\nsituation\ndo you know what i mean it's i think\nit's i think it's\nyou can rewrite a story on anything and\ni'll tell you when this was really\nbrought home to me jay\nhave you heard of edith eager yeah i\nthink if you've interviewed either if\nyou haven't you absolutely should you\nwould absolutely love talking to her but\nedith came onto my podcast last year\nat the time she was 93 years old\ni think about that conversation pretty\nmuch\nevery single day it had such an impact\non me\nwhen edith was 16 years old living in\neastern europe she was getting ready\nthat evening she was going to go on a\ndate with her boyfriend there was a\nknock on the door\nand before she knew that her and her\nsister and her parents were on a train\nto auschwitz\nshe gets to auschwitz within two hours\nof getting there her parents are\nmurdered\nuh she's there with her sister she\ndoesn't know what's what's going on\nwhat's happening\nand then later that day she had to dance\nright she had to dance for some of the\nprison guards there and the last thing\nher mum said to her was\nedith nobody can take away from you what\nyou put inside your minds so the first\nthing she told me was when i was dancing\ni wasn't dancing in auschwitz\ni was dancing in budapest opera house\ni was dancing there was a full orchestra\nthere that the crowds were there that's\nwhat i was dancing so that's the first\nlesson i learned for her that you can\ncreate a story in your mind and then she\ntold me dr chassis when i was in\nauschwitz i wasn't a prisoner the prison\nguards were prisoners they weren't\nliving their life i was free in my mind\nand it and it just went on and on and\nthe words i think about every day jay\nare when\nshe said to me\nrongan listen\ni have\nlived through auschwitz\nbut i can tell you the greatest prison\nis the prison you create inside your own\nminds\nand i thought\nokay\nif\nedith eager\ncan\nwrite a different story about events a\nhappiness story if you will about events\nin the hell of auschwitz\nthat i'm pretty sure i can\nreframe most of the small frictions in\nmy own life and it's uh\nit's it's been so powerful for me jay it\nreally has i mean do you ever you know\nhow do you deal with friction is that\nsomething you try and apply in your own\nlife or or how do you see it\nyeah i mean i just everything you just\nshared right now and i\nhad come across edith story and i didn't\nrealize you interviewed her which is\nwhich is fantastic and\nso phenomenal to hear about your\nexperience with her\neverything you just said i'm fully\naligned with and i don't think you could\nhave picked a better example because\nto share it from someone who has been\nthrough the worst of the worst of the\nworst\nand for that person to be able to create\na reframe at that time\ngives us all an opportunity to realize\nhow powerful it is and so i am fully\nwith you like fully aligned fully\nin agreement with you and in my own\nsmall way in my life i do the same thing\nand\ni i think when we look at our life as a\nstory\nas opposed to a\nuh checklist or as opposed to a\nhit list or as opposed to a list of\ngoals\nright like it's a very different\napproach when you see your life as a\nlist of goals and if you don't reach\nthem you don't feel good about yourself\nyou're missing the story right if you\nlook at all the people who've achieved\ngoals that we admire\nthey all got there because they lived a\nstory they didn't live a goal they\ndidn't live a journey to a goal and so i\ndo it all the time as well i'm\nconstantly\nreframing my experience of life and what\nyou said is so true\nthat in one sense there is no truth in\none sense\nto any of our stories and journeys\nbecause\nwhat is objectively the truth is just a\nperception yeah i mean i think you'll\nlike this one jay because i know you're\na football fan or i should say soccer\nfan as i'm on your show\nbut they did this study right they\nlooked they were talking to football\nfans same incident right everyone can\nsee the incidents and they interviewed\nboth sets of fans on different sides\nwhat happens\ncompletely different version of reality\nover the same\nincident right think about any i guess\nmarriage or two partners\nright when they have a disagreement\nthere are two versions of reality right\nyou know it depends on which side of the\ntable you're sitting on determines your\nreality\nand i've learned actually and it sounds\nquite controversial that\nfor your happiness\ni think sometimes the truth doesn't\nmatter it's the spin you put on it\nyou can put a spin on it that's going to\nmake you feel disempowered and a victim\nand look i want to be respectful i\nunderstand there are some pretty\nhorrendous things that happen in life to\npeople i understand that and sometimes\nit's harder than in other times but this\nis something you can get better at you\ncan always put a new story on it and\nand what happens then jay is that every\nday becomes a school day right every day\nyou're being given you're being gifted\nopportunities by the world around you to\nlearn something about yourself and\na tip maybe for your audience if they\nthink okay this is quite difficult\nright you know someone's done this and i\ndon't like it something that i found\nreally helpful\nis this idea that\nif i was that other person\ni'd be doing exactly the same\nand what i mean when i say that\nis\nif i were that other person with their\nchildhood with their childhood\nexperiences with their parents\nwith the bullying they received at\nschool with the\nboss that they had\nif i were them i would absolutely be\nmaking the same decisions as them yes\nand yes i honestly feel that if we don't\nthink we would you know i invite people\nto consider maybe it's our ego talking\nbecause\nthey made the decisions that's their\nversion of reality and i find that\ngives me this ability to be\ncompassionate much more compassionate to\nevery single person that i meet whether\ni agree with them or not and jay look at\nthe state of the world at the moment\nright it's seemingly pretty divided\ncertainly online it seems pretty divided\nand i think this approach not only makes\nus feel better\nbut i think when we can exercise this\ncompassion\nto everyone even people we disagree with\ni think that's what's going to make the\nworld a much much better and happier\nplace definitely and you reminded me of\nthat\ni'm sure you remember that famous prince\nwilliam meme\nwhere he's holding up his fingers like\nthis\nand so he's actually saying i think he's\nlike number three\nand if you look at it from the other\nangle it looks like he's putting his\nmiddle finger up and and it's like these\ntwo pictures that are put next to each\nother and one of them looks like he's\nputting his middle finger up to the\npress but actually when you see it from\nanother angle he's putting three\nand and he obviously means something\nelse by that and so i i love that when\nwe talk about contentment that makes a\nlot of sense let's shift to alignment i\ni really like the way you defined\nalignment you said feeling aligned means\nthat the person you want to be\nand the person you are\nactually being out there in the world\nare one and the same\nand i remember a very beautiful thought\nby gandhi whenever i think about\nalignment and i believe he said that\nwhen you experience peace and harmony\nwhen what you think what you say\nand what you do\nare aligned and whenever i think about\nthat or whenever i share that teaching i\nfind that most people think something\nbut say something else\nwe say one thing but then we do a\ncompletely different thing and so we're\nliving in this very divided world even\ninside of ourselves because it's\ncompletely disconnected\nhow do we\nstart creating a more aligned life\nbecause\noften we're scared of saying what we\nthink and we're even more scared of\ndoing what we say\nand then we're worried about what\neveryone else thinks of all of that so\nalignment becomes a really big challenge\nwalk us through that for a bit yeah i\nmean the first thing to say it's not\ngoing to be\nsuper easy in the sense that it's not\nsomething you can just listen to us\nhaving a conversation and then\nimmediately afterwards go okay cool\nright now i'm going to go and that's\naligned in the world no this is a\nprocess it's a very fun process but it's\na process nonetheless\nso\nyou know alignment this idea that our\ninner values on our external actions are\nmatching up whatever that is and\nthe reason i guess i'm so passionate\nabout this jay is i've really\nthis is something\nlike i've really struggled with pretty\nmuch my entire life i feel that\nwhat i'm really trying to do these days\nis\nbecome more and more aligned and\nactually to\nreally tune into who i actually am which\nsounds like the easiest thing in the\nworld to do\nbut actually for many of us it's one of\nthe hardest things because since we were\nkids we started to do things to gain the\napproval of others\nbut i know for me\nfor much of my life i only felt that i\nwas worthy\nof love and acceptance if i achieved\nif i was successful\nand i think for me\nwell i know a lot of it comes down to my\nupbringing and you know i love my\nparents to bits i think they did\ni'd like to think they did a pretty good\njob with bringing me up\nbut there were some things again there's\ntwo versions of reality right i remember\ni think there's something in the\nimmigrant mentality here i i don't know\nif this echoes your experience or not\nbut if i came back\nfrom school with 19 out of 20 and\nsomething\nmy mom would say well why didn't you get\n20.\nif i came back with 99\nmy mom would say well yeah why didn't\nyou get 100\nand i didn't realize it at the time but\ni took on this perception that\ni'm only loved and really seen and\nvalued\nwhen i win and get top marks\nand that's very toxic because on the\noutside you can appear quite successful\nyou could appear as though you're\nachieving and doing things\nbut on the inside\nyou know\nthere's nothing there's a real deep\ninsecurity i've had that for much of my\nlife i think you know external success\nlooks good but on the inside\nyou know you don't feel good and so you\ngo to what i call these junk happiness\nhabits whether that be you know drinking\nor gambling or\nyou know these days instagram\npotentially overusing it and this sort\nof stuff so\nfor me the process of alignment started\nwith recognizing why\ni behaved the way that i do\nand\nit was a very rewarding process it's\ntaken a bit of time but this is not one\nhit jay that people are going to just\nthink oh i need to do this and now i can\nthe first step in any change is\nawareness so even if someone's listening\nto this conversation and going\nyeah you know what\ni'm not living an aligned life like i'm\ni'm not being the person out there who i\nreally am okay\nthat is progress okay you may want more\nbut that is a good start at least now\nyou know then you can work on the next\nstage so there's many ways in which\npeople can do this\ni think uh doing some sort of values\nexercise\nis really really helpful i know we spoke\nabout this when you came on my show\nyou've done a great job of this in your\nown book j of talking about values in\nhappy mind happy life there are some\nsimple exercises to help people\nunderstand\nwhat are your values can you\nchoose three values from this long list\nand\nyou know maybe once a week you reassess\nyou go\nyeah i think that is\num that doesn't fit quite right i'm\ngoing to tweak it right so you can keep\ntweaking until you really understand\nwhat these values are and then you can\nyou know look at your life and go how\nmuch of the time am i living\nin accordance with these values\nand it's so simple but just the act of\nwriting it down and reassessing is\nreally really powerful you start to make\nsubtle shifts when you do that\nso i think that's an important piece\naround alignment also\nand i'm very very interested in\nin your thoughts on this as well jay\nthis whole idea of core happiness which\nhas these three components\nit's basically\ni was trying to come up with a model for\nhappiness that actually people find\ngenuinely practical and useful\nnot like a lofty concept but can i come\nup with a model that holds true in every\nsingle situation\nand i you know i think i cracked it with\nthis model of course i welcome hearing\nwhere i may not have got it quite right\nbut i really think that\nthis encompasses\nthis deep sense of happiness these three\ncomponents contentments control and\nalignment\nand then\ni remember thinking what about meaning\nand purpose because we keep hearing and\nof course you know your your show's\ncalled on purpose you talk a lot about\npurpose\ni thought well where does meaning and\npurpose fit in here because a lot of\npeople these days say we shouldn't be\nchasing happiness we should be chasing\nmeaning i spent weeks trying to solve\nthis and\nthe the way i came down on it what i\nthink underpins this all together is\nthat meaning and purpose comes with\nalignment\nso\nmeaning and purpose\nis important right it's a necessary\ningredients for happiness\nbut i don't think it's happiness in and\nof itself and the reason i say that is\nbecause let's say this could be you or\nme for example or it could be someone\nlistening let's say you have a job\nthat gives you meaning and purpose and\nyou love it and it it's helping the\nworld it really nourishes you okay great\nyou've got meaning\nbut maybe you're working too hard you're\ngetting back too late each night maybe\nyou're not spending time nourishing the\nimportant relationships in your life\nsure you've got meaning\nbut you don't have core happiness and\nthen you could take it to another\nextreme let's say in world war ii\nyou might make the case that a soldier\nfighting against the nazis\nwas living a meaningful life\nbut i'm not necessarily sure you could\nsay that they were happy\nso\ni'm all for meaning and purpose but i\nthink it comes under the alignment leg\nof the core happiness model the call\nhappiness stool\nand then i think it also takes the\npressure off people jay i'm sure you get\nmessages like this but\npeople often say that\nyou know yeah i want to find my i want\nto find my purpose but i don't know\nwhere to start you know what is my\npurpose and they see people on online\nand think oh man they've got their\npurpose i don't\nyou know\nhave you heard of the japanese concepts\nof ikigai yes it's beautiful yeah it\nreally is beautiful and i remember in in\nmy second but the stress solution i i\nwrote about it this idea that icky guys\nthese four things you know something\nyou know we should be looking to try and\nfind something that we're good at that\nwe enjoy doing that the world needs\nand that also makes money and i thought\nwhat a beautiful concept i want some\nicky guy in my life\ni think i remember jay i was giving a\ntalk in london\nand i remember it so well because at the\nend of the talk\nwe were doing q a and you know\na young lady at the back put her hand up\nand she said dr shashi i'm an 18 year\nold japanese student living in london\nand i grew up with this concept of\nikigai\nand frankly i found it demotivating and\nit really put me off it seemed like a\ntoo\nlofty bar for me to meet\nand that really hit me jay i thought\nyeah that's interesting these nice ideas\nfor some people they're very off-putting\ni think that's what alignment and values\ncan be really helpful because if you're\nstruggling to find your meaning and\npurpose\nright\ni would say focus on your values so\nlet's say you hate your job let's say\nyou work in a call center you don't like\nit but that pays you money and it helps\nyou feed your family and put a roof over\nyour heads\nand you hear the stuff about meaning and\npurpose i say okay focus on values if\none of your values is kindness let's say\nthen if you get up in the morning and\nyou're kind to your partner you get a\ncoffee on the way to work and you're\nkind to the barista you get on the bus\nand you're kind to the bus driver and\nwhilst you're at work you're kind to\nyour work colleagues\nthen you're living a life of meaning\nthat is a meaningful life you may not\nlove your job at the moment but the more\nyou act in alignment that meaning that\npurpose is going to come as a byproduct\nso\nlike that's where i think meaning and\npurpose kind of fits into this core\nhappiness idea i mean did that make\nsense you know do you have any thoughts\non that do you agree you know i'm i\nreally welcome challenging this stool\nbecause i kind of think it holds true in\nevery situation but you know i'd love to\nknow your view\nyeah i mean my honest take is i think\nthat\na lot of\nthese discussions\ncan be\nexplained just through different terms\nin different language used by different\npeople\nfor words that appeal in different ways\nso\nthere are certain words that when you\nunpack them i can see that we're trying\nto say the same thing\nbut you may use certain words that i\ndon't use and this is exactly what you\nwere saying before that if i don't take\nthe time to listen\nto understand and to\ntake a moment of stillness to say well\nlet me understand what rangan's really\ntrying to say even though we use\ndifferent words we may actually find\nthat we're trying to say the same thing\nwhereas if i simply look at the words i\nmay say i disagree with you completely i\nthink you're i think you're wrong and i\nhave another opinion\nand so i think we have to be so careful\nwith language\nbecause words mean so so many different\nthings to so many different people and\nit's why i always say to people that\nwe need more faces and voices in the\nworld of health and wellness\nor in any field for that matter\nbecause everyone needs to hear from a\ndiverse set of voices and faces everyone\nis not going to\nconnect to my language and that's okay\nand everyone's not going to connect to\nyour language and that's okay because\nthere have been times where i've heard a\npiece of wisdom one time twice three\ntimes four times i hear it the ninth\ntime from some random person\nbut the way they said it the penny\ndropped and it hit me like it just hit\nme and i was like but i've been hearing\nthat since i was a kid but hearing it\nfrom that person at that time and that\nvoice in that moment\nthat had an impact on me and so i've\nbecome of the belief that\ni love the word alignment i think it's\nfantastic\nand i would say that a lot an aligned\nlife is a purposeful life i agree and\nthat you are spot on when you say that\nif we can start living and practicing\njust one of our values that that will\ngrow into a purposeful life\nand so so we're in alignment\nwe're in alignment and and i'm very\ncontent with the language that you use\nis different to me\nbut that we are of the same\nuh ethos and spirit in what we're trying\nto share but of course the language will\nbe different because we're different\npeople right we've had different\nexperiences you've gone off to be a monk\nyou know that's something that in my\nhead i think wouldn't that be incredible\nto go and do that so although i can't\nsee that happening any time soon\nespecially being married and having two\nyoung kids who need me\nbut\nyou will be informed by\nyour life experience\ni've been a medical doctor for you know\nnearly 21 years now i've seen tens of\nthousands of patients\nmy view to this topic of happiness is\ninformed by the tens of thousands of\npatients i've seen and their struggles\nright so we're going to say it\ndifferently and go you know\npulling together alignment and what you\nasked me right at the start which is\nwhat are the\nyou know why is it we struggle so much\nwith happiness and this idea of\nhappiness another exercise that i think\nis really useful for people that also\nhelps them be more aligned\nit's a two-part exercise right i love it\nand um\ni don't know if you want to try it on\nyourself actually yeah sure could you\nyeah let's do it let's do it the first\npart of the exercise is write down\nor you can just tell me three things\nthat if you did them each week would\ngive you a deep sense of happiness\nokay yeah so i'm not gonna say stuff i\nalready do so just just to clarify for\neveryone because i already meditate and\nexercise i'm not gonna include those\nbecause they would be they are huge ones\nfor my happiness uh i'd say one of the\nbiggest things is\nuh\ndoing something fun and playful with my\nwife so whether that's going to an\nescape room or whether that's going to\nan assault course or like some sort of\nlike fun outdoor\nactivity with my wife brings me a lot of\nhappiness so that's one of them okay i'd\nsay another one is spending time\noutdoors in nature in the sun um i'm\ngoing on a hike on saturday but that is\nsomething that i know if i did more of\ni'd be that would increase my happiness\nand the third one would be\nspending even more time reading i love\nreading and making notes and learning\nand i do plenty of it but i know i could\nalways do more so those would be my\nthree okay so there's three things there\nokay now the second part of the exercise\nis called write your happy endings so\nfast forward to the end of your life\nimagine you're on your death beds\nlooking back on your life what are three\nthings you will want to have done\nso then it comes to\nuh i would say you know serving as many\npeople as possible through the work that\ni do right now that's that's number one\num\nthe second one would be to have\nfelt that i was able to purify\nmy heart and my mind of ego\nof envy\nof jealousy of\nof any impurities that lie in my mind\nand heart that would be my second one\nand and my third one would be that\ni\nwas able to\nexpress compassion\ntowards all the pain i saw\nand not create more pain i mean that's\nlovely\num so wonderful to hear now that the\nnext part is you go back now\nto your first three answers\nand the idea for people is okay\nif you do those three things that you've\nstated initially weekly will that get\nyou\nto the happy ending that you have\nalready said that you want\nand i've done it with so many people and\nthey find it really useful because\nyou know for example you know you've\nalready mentioned you meditate and\nexercise you want to do something fun\nand playful with your wives spend time\noutdoors in nature and reading now if\nyou do those things let's say those five\nthings every week\ndoes that get you to that happy ending\nwhere you've served others\nwhere you've purified your mind of ego\nand you've managed to practice\ncompassion you know do you see those\nthings as aligned\nyeah definitely i mean especially and\nand now and that's why it's useful doing\nthe activity with sometimes things that\ni already do\nuh yes i i think that a lot of those\nelements of like personal time for\nmeditation and practice\na lot of the work around the reading and\nstudy that i do which is really powerful\nfor\ncleansing the impurities within the\nheart\nand and even that play is so integral\nbecause that playfulness is what keeps\nit fun and exciting and so absolutely\nyes there are lots of links in between\nmany people when they do that exercise\nfind that they're not aligned at all\nlike at the end of the life they say\nyeah i want to have spent time with my\nfriends and family\ni want to have engaged in passions that\nmean the world to me\nthey say all kinds of things\nand then you look at the three happiness\nhabits\nand they don't match up at all it's a\nfantastic exercise that is a brilliant\nexercise and all it's not about making\npeople feel bad it's\nit's about bringing awareness to that\nintention like if you say you value your\nfriends and family\nyet you're too busy working let's say to\nfind time for them okay that's okay but\nyou need to start making a small shift\nthere because you ain't gonna get to\nthat happy ending otherwise and so\nyou know what i'm about j it's always\nabout how can i simplify a message\nsimplify an exercise that people can\nactually\ndo reiterate and hopefully result in\nthem living i guess a more intentional\nand a happier life\nranga the reason why i love that\nactivity and exercise like it's\nbrilliant by the way it's it's\nabsolutely fantastic and i think\neveryone on the everyone who's listening\nand watching right now not only should\ngo and get the book because the book is\nfull of lots more activities and\nexercises like this one\nbut do this one with a friend this\nweekend because\nwhat you've explained so beautifully\nthere is the difference between\ncircumstantial\nand existential happiness\nand so there are a lot of things we do\nevery day because\nsituationally they make us feel better\nbut the existential\ncore happiness which as you describe is\nalignment contentment and control\nthat can only be measured when you look\nat the gravity of a moment like\ndeath\nand and when you're doing that in this\nactivity\nthat's what you're putting it under a\nmicroscope and going well how is this\naffecting your existence\nas opposed to your circumstance right\nand and that in and of itself is a\nreally fascinating way of thinking and\ni i know that i i don't do that activity\nbut i think about those questions very\noften\nand for me for so long i i always ask\nmyself that i'll sit there and i'll go\nhow is this going to make me feel\nwhen i'm dying will i regret doing this\nor not doing this and\neverything that i'm doing on a daily\nbasis and the commitments i make and the\npriorities i make are all dedicated to\nthat purpose that i've committed to\nbecause i know that that's what brings\nme joy and there are a lot of sacrifices\nwith that and there are a lot of things\nthat you forego for that but i realized\nthat health was so integral to your\npurpose no matter what it is that that's\nsomething you can't sacrifice in the\npursuit of any alignment or contentment\nyou chase because if you're not healthy\nthen all of it falls apart so\nyou know i really love that activity and\ni'm so grateful you put that and many\nothers in the book yeah thanks and you\nknow it's something that i use myself\nyou know i\ni'm keen to to i don't want people to\nfeel that\ni haven't got it yet i'm not there yet\nyou know i'm not alliance that's okay\nright that is absolutely okay i would\nguess by anyone who's listening to your\npodcast jay i guess naturally would feel\ndrawn to this sort of content anyway\nthey're wanting to live a more\nintentional a more purposeful life right\nso they're already that way in clients\nand\nit's not this thing like i said it's not\nthis destination that you get to it's a\nconstant process of tweaking and then\nsociety life will pull you away you know\ni definitely have times where i work too\nhard and\ni'm not as present as i might want to be\nright you know just because i know what\ni should be doing it doesn't mean i'm\nnot human and i'm not susceptible to the\nsame mistakes that many of us make\njay i've never felt this\ncalm\nand\ngood\nand at peace with myself and my life\nlike when i last spoke to you a few\nyears ago in la you know about the\nstress solution book\ni was a different person like i really\nwas it was a different version of me\ni'm just a lot more\ncontent these days i've done a lot of\nwork to rid myself off ego and the need\nfor external validation i've also really\nlet go of\nthis idea that i need to be right i\nthink for much of my life i define\nmyself are you right are you winning\nand letting go of that it's just made me\nhappier like i'm no longer attached to\nbeing right i'm attached to learning i\nwouldn't even call it attached i'm\ncommitted to learning\nright every day any friction that comes\nin my life anyone that sends me a rude\nemail it's all an opportunity for me to\ngo in and go what can i learn here what\ncan i learn about myself how can i be\ncompassionate about that other person\nand it keeps life fun and interesting\nright it really does and\nyes i feel karma and content but all\nkinds of little niggles and things that\nyou know i used to get they're just sort\nof going because there's less emotional\ntension\nin my body\ni love that wrong and that's and by the\nway on a personal level that's just\nreally beautiful to hear i mean you know\ni think\nhearing that that's the journey you've\nbeen on in the last few years and that's\nwhat's brought this book about
