    "transcript": "[Music]\nthey want to tell you\nwhen to stop hurting and that's not\nanybody's place to tell you when to stop\nhurting it's and everybody has a\ndifferent lifespan of pain one of the\nthings you said to me that stood out in\none of our dm conversations was you said\nimagine if everyone in the world was\nfive percent kinder\nand and that stuck with me i was just\nlike wow like yeah imagine if everyone\nwas just five percent kinder like you\nweren't talking about oh let's make\neveryone in the world super kind and you\nknow tell me what that means to you and\nlike what made you say that and where\nthat came from well i feel i don't know\nif it's the older i get or the more\naccessible i am to so many\npeople because of social media nowadays\nand just that technology's in our hand\nit just feels really heavy the world\nfeels really heavy and\ndepressing and if you read statistics um\nfrom mental health bullying violence\neverything is escalated and i think\nwe're too exposed to too many avenues of\npeople and too many ways for people to\nconnect with us\nand\nwe are all made up of energy and when\npeople either take too much from you it\nis\na ripple effect and sometimes if someone\nprojected negativity onto you you just\ninstinctively will project it back to\nthem or as a defense mechanism to\nsomebody else\nand it's also not fair to misdirect that\nenergy because it is a ripple effect and\nit goes to other people but if we were\nto be a little more self-aware and when\nsomeone is mean or negative to us\ninstead of us being combative back if we\nwere just like\nwhy are you hurting or just even like\nokay and just took it instead of having\nyour ego involved where you have to\nshout louder\nif you just took it\nthat's even just being kind i'm not\nsaying people have to go buy roses for\neveryone or whatever but even opening a\ndoor\num smiling at someone you don't even\nhave to talk\nit's a universal language that everybody\nunderstands\nthat would give a ripple effect or even\nthe\nkarma back to you that you're going to\nreceive a little bit more kindness that\nday i think it's\nhighly naive of me to say\n50 or let's oh i want everyone to you\nknow\nthink that they're surrounded by glitter\nand unicorns like that's just not\nreality it is and it's also cool when\nlife gets heavy too to see how you can\nmanage and filter through it but that\ndoesn't mean we still have to be\nhorrible people to one another yeah no i\nlove that i love what you're saying\nbecause i think we also and you touched\non this we think being kind means these\nbig gestures\nor like having to save the world or you\nknow doing something really\ncolossal like it has to be big and\nexpansive but you're right that we\nforget and we underestimate how much\njust a smile a kind word\na kind message or thinking of someone\ncan just change someone's day and i love\nthose simple things because i think that\nthose are things anyone can do and those\nare things everyone can appreciate\nwhenever i have like a waitress or\nsomeone they are busting their butts to\nwork and they're cleaning tables and\nthey're serving you it's a beautiful\nthing and instead of just like you don't\neven look up at them if you just look at\nthem stare them in their eyes and say\nthank you or\nyou can tell that people are so rude\nto people in any service industry\nbecause they almost get\nlike shocked like that someone's staring\ndirectly at me and as a human you never\nwant to feel that you're invisible or\nthat people are looking past you you\nwant people to look at you yes and even\njust that alone that makes someone's day\nand if someone was having a bad day or\nfeeling like man i can't get by i'm\nworking my ass off and i'm still people\nare just\nmean to me it depresses them more like\nit's like just look at someone hey how\nare you thank you so much like that's it\na busboy anything i think we all take\nfor granted how hard everybody works no\nmatter what your job is it's still a job\nand just a little smile or a little hope\nyou're having a nice day like something\nso simple it does nothing for you like\nwhy does that hurt you just do it and it\ncould really change their entire day i\nremember a huge mistake that i used to\nmake like this was something that i wish\ni never did but i did and i is i\nliterally used to walk into ubers and or\nlifts and i'd be on my phone and i\nwouldn't say anything\nbecause you know you've already\nprogrammed where you want to go right so\nyou don't need to talk to the person if\nyou don't want to and i would just walk\nin i won't even say hello\nand i wouldn't say hello i wouldn't say\nhow's your day i wouldn't greet them and\nit took one driver to actually not start\ndriving for like three minutes and he\nwas like hello how are you oh wow and i\nprobably even missed it the first time\nand the second one was like hello how\nare you and he kept asking me it was\nsomething like the third or the fourth\ntime that i registered because i was so\nbusy wow and i was just like oh wait a\nminute he was just like yeah i just\nwanted to have a just ask how you were\nand it just took me to that where i was\nlike i can even just just saying hello\nnow i'm not saying you need to get into\na big life story conversation with your\nlyft driver but the point being that i\nthink they're still humans correct right\nand i think because of our phones and\nwe're so busy but remember we all\noperated before our phones somehow so\nlife goes on do you remember that though\ni do and i miss that time i do feel bad\nfor like my little sisters who i don't\nthink will ever i don't think they ever\nknew that time because they were too\nyoung they didn't they wouldn't have a\nphone\nat that age anyway but\nwe forget that we're all humans and i\nalso yes of course we don't want to have\nlike sometimes we're just tired and we\ndon't want to talk i get it but i also\njust\nmost people can be room readers so if\nyou go in the car like hey how are you\nlike and that's kind of it if you even\njust if they keep engaging you're not\nbeing rude you could still kind of just\ngive short answers and hopefully they'll\nkind of get the clue yeah and stop\ntalking to you and if not you know maybe\nthey just need someone to talk yeah\ndefinitely not encouraging anyone to get\ninto a life story conversation just be\nhuman i think you put it best yeah be\nhuman we talk a lot about self-care\nself-worth in our conversations i see\nyou post these amazing stories and\nthat's how i actually found out i\nremember once you posted one of my\nvideos and i was just like oh wow like i\njust felt very humbled and touched and\nbut you share so many other people's and\ni think you do such a great job of\nencouraging creators like myself as well\nin sharing that and and not just me and\ni know you share plenty of other\ncreators as well which is so beautiful\nand when i started to see that and i see\nthat on your stories all the time like\nis either true or a true statement right\nsee the true or true statement\nand\nand i love that and i've commented back\nso many times and said i'm really glad\nyou pushed that whatever when did you\nkind of get to that space in your life\nwhere that became a priority like when\ndid you come to that you were just like\nmy self-care and this journey of\nself-reflection are important to me now\nlike when did you get to this space of\neverything you're sharing now well i've\nalways been a writer i write a lot and i\njournal um i write a lot mainly for\nmyself and then i love it it's so\ntherapeutic um i did a lot when i\nespecially when i was\ngoing through my divorce specifically\nand it was so therapeutic for me\num you're just even able it's like a\nrelease and sometimes when you write\nsomething you either see how important\nit is or how silly it is to you at the\nsame time but it's out of your system\nand you could burn it do whatever and\nthen i\nused to write\num i would post a quote and then write a\nlarge caption\nand it's before i had as many followers\nand it\nsome people would tear it apart so much\nthat they took out like\nthe real meaning of it and they would\nmake it into whatever they were feeling\nand it wasn't what i was feeling so i\njust chose to stop doing that as much\nbecause it kind of ruined it or like the\nblogs would create things i'm like but\nthat you took the beauty out of it that\nwasn't what it meant right um\nbut not everybody is as deep or as they\njust want it to be salacious and\nsomething way worse than it is but i\nalso started seeing how much people were\ncraving some sort of\nguidance if you will and not that i'm\nthat person to go to because i'm still\nfiguring out my life we all are we're\nstill just\nhuman beings and we're going to make\nmistakes and live our life but that's\ni'm okay with sharing my failures\nbecause i'm secure enough and just me\nbeing a person i'm still figuring it out\ni don't know what i'm doing every day\nbut some i just realized how much what a\npositive reaction i would get when i\nwould post something encouraging to\nother people or i would go on someone i\nwould go on strangers pages and just\nlike oh my gosh i love your freckles and\nlike what that would do i'm like that's\ncrazy that just being kind gets\nso much positive feedback like that\nshould just be normal\ni think we're just used to people\nbullying each other and if someone like\ni would never go to someone's page to\ncriticize them that's just not who i am\ni wouldn't waste my time if i felt\nsomething i'm like oh why don't i even\nthink that about the stranger who am i i\nwould go to someone's page to encourage\nan uplift so but i think in today's day\nwe're so used to people going to pages\nto be these uh you know computer bullies\nand let's just talk about people but\ni mean\nthey're really struggling in their own\nlife and that's the only reason why\nthey're acting out like that is because\nthey're feeling that about themselves or\nwhatever and they're just trying to\nproject it to somebody else yeah and i\nlove how that what you just said now\nit's almost like it transforms your\nfeeling towards them into kindness too\nbecause you start recognizing where\nthey're coming from right what they're\ngoing through to make them that way i\nthink it's just created\nit's interesting in the world that we\nare in it's either\nthe more you're exposed to you see\na lot more negativity and it's\ndisturbing and disgusting to me but\ninstead of me\nbecoming bitter and evil about it i've\nchosen to become more\nself-aware and i have more empathy for\npeople and i never want to change that i\nthink if anything it's given me more\nempathy because i'm like oh i feel\nreally bad for you yes and i feel bad\nthat you can't also understand that i'm\njust living my life i'm not perfect i am\ndoing what you're doing every single\nwe're just trying to figure it all out\nbut if we're all a little more\nunderstanding and kind to one another it\nwould make our trials tribulations ups\nand downs that much easier yeah i love\nthat you've always been journaling i\nthink that's such a it's such a great\npractice and and i love that because\ni've recommended to so many people that\ni've worked with to to journal and read\nit back themselves and you're so right\nthat sometimes you read your feelings\nback to yourself and you cry and there\nare sometimes you read your feelings\nback to yourself and you laugh because\nyou're just like what really right\nyou're like that's what i'm upset about\nyeah like that is so petty in today's\nworld or but and we all have to also be\nkind to ourselves and realize that like\ni hate when people say like what do you\nhave to worry about you have all this\nmoney or whatever\noh so money means you don't have\nproblems and\ni don't care who you are problems are\nproblems um in your world i might you\nmight walk a day in my shoes and be like\ni don't want those issues or i might\nwalk a day in your shoes and be like wow\neverything's beautiful but you might see\nwhat i thought was beauty as\nyou're not happy and satisfied with that\nand you still want more or maybe you\nwant less those are all okay feelings\nthat's why we each have our own\nlives but to\nattack somebody else for\nwhat is considered their problems i just\nfind really counterproductive and that's\nnot motivating yourself if you want a\nlot of money go out there and get it i\nbelieve in you i'm applauding you but\nwhen people i think journaling is so\ngood especially when it's private\nbecause\nfor me personally it's something i get\nto write down and i don't feel judged\nbut i'm allowed to\ncriticize myself because it's my journey\nand i know\nthe day one to the last day that i've\ntaken those steps so i'm allowed to\ncritique and be like you know what khloe\nyou're you're way past this you don't\nneed to harp on things like this i think\nit's healthy and even if you read it\nback and you just laugh at yourself i\nthink that's also a great form of\ntherapy yeah 100 what's the most\npowerful or meaningful journal entry you\never wrote that was that was really like\ntransformative for you\nfascinated\nthat's a good question you know i\nsometimes i write and i don't even know\nwhat i'm saying right like sometimes i'm\njust like it's like words and then it\nturns into something and i never even\nknew that was a thing but i\ni was like you know i'm just compelled\nto write\nand i would just start scribbling and it\nmight be literally talking about my day\nand then it goes into maybe like\nsomething to do with like why did this\nhappen like you just said because your\nmind wanders i know you meditate i'm not\ni pray i'm not great at meditating and\nsitting and my mind wanders too much so\ni when i pray my prayers are very\nconversational and i realize it's kind\nof how i journal as well it's more of a\nconversation but i'm talking\nalmost to myself which might be a little\ninsane but\ni think the most important meeting we\nhave is with ourselves i guess so i\nthink it's great yeah no it makes sense\ni i love that because for me\nmeditation's a prayer too\nand and i think that's what's so\nbeautiful about it that it is a\nconversation it is an exchange and often\none of the things that i would do is i\nwould in my meditation or prayer i would\nask a question\nand it's not about trying to find the\nanswer it's about sincerely asking the\nquestion like can you really ask a\nquestion with sincere intent with with a\ngenuine feeling of like i really want to\nunderstand this and when you ask it with\nthat then of course it becomes a\nconversation because there's a response\nand you're right sometimes it's from\nwithin\nsometimes it's from someone you have a\nconversation with that day\nit comes from absolutely anywhere and i\ni love that i think prayer is so\nimportant and and like you said even if\nit's just a conversation with yourself\ngod the universe whatever you work with\nit's it's a beautiful practice to have i\ndon't care what anybody else believes i\nbelieve in god i'm not judging whoever\nbelieves in i do believe everybody\nshould have a faith in something it\ncenters us it holds us accountable for\nour actions every day um and so my faith\nis in god i'm christian and i\nwake up every morning early\nintentionally so i can i have\na beautiful view and i open my windows\nand i just\nlook and i pray of but i always start my\nday with gratitude because i think that\ntranscends through the rest of my day\nand not that we can control every\nemotion but i like to even if i\nsometimes you just wake up and you're\neither melancholy or you're just kind of\ngrumpy\nbut even if i am i try to convince\nmyself\nthis is a great day look how blessed you\nare like everything's beautiful we take\nour health for granted like we're\nhealthy like i just try to have a\nconversation with myself and if i am\nhaving a grumpy day it normally\nturns it around yeah normally we all\nhave those moments where it doesn't yeah\nwe've intersected some of our mornings i\nthink some of our conversations have\nbeen in the morning and what do you have\nis that gratitude practice that you have\nis just talking to yourself like that's\nwhat it is for you just almost like\nguiding yourself\nto be grateful in the morning right yeah\ni just it's um and that's new i've\nalways prayed but it used to be just at\nnight and\nover the past couple years i've decided\nlike you know what i want to start my\nday like this too i think because it's\ni used to just be so busy i'm still busy\nbut like i would never take that time\nand yes i have to wake up earlier but it\nchanges my whole\njust the momentum of my day\num so i wake up earlier i make it an\neffort you make time for the things you\nwant to do\nand\nyou know i make that's something i want\nto do it gives me such a better lighter\nenergy throughout the day\nand\ni just it's important i think we all\nhave ups and downs and we're all going\nthrough rough patches so not every day\ni've felt compelled to do it but i've\nstarted doing it maybe like\nfour years ago and i i love it it's more\nit's increased over the past year\nsignificantly where you probably would\ndo it\nevery now and then and now i do it\nreligiously i would say for the past\nyear that's beautiful thanks for sharing\nthat as well i love finding out about\nthese things because i think\nso many of us don't get a space to share\nthis and that's one of the reasons why i\nwanted to do this was i'm happy that\nwe're learning this about you but and\ni'm learning this about you uh what's\nsomething i i love what you said about\nfiguring things out because i actually\nthink\nwhen we're sharing\nwhen we're figuring things out they're\nmore relevant it's almost like when you\nfigure something out perfectly and then\nyou teach it right it kind of doesn't\nfeel as real to everyone who's learning\nbut like you said like when you're when\nyou're trying to navigate life and\nyou're making mistakes you're failing\nand that's the same with me like i'm\nalways sharing that everything i'm\nsharing in my videos is stuff that i've\nbeen through and i'm working through and\nfiguring out what's something you're\ntrying to figure out right now like\nwhat's something that you've been\nreflecting on right now goodness my life\nno\num\nyou know i\nthere's nothing specifically i can\npinpoint\num\ni\nabsolutely love being a mom it's one of\nmy favorite things\nand you know i've read well about\nunder a year i would say about eight\nmonths ago i went into i've had a\nbreakup and so figuring out i think\npeople are so good at distracting\num and i've really chosen to not\ndistract myself or to try to not\ndistract myself maybe people can say\ntrue would be a distraction but if\nanything she's a healthy distraction and\ni love like i haven't jumped into dating\ni don't care to date right now i'm not\nin a rush for it i feel so\ngood in my life and i\ni don't really need much else um and so\nsomething that i'm focusing on is just\nmaking sure that i process everything i\nthink\nespecially in my family we're good at\nmoving on like we're we we have very big\nforgiving hearts we just move on but we\ndon't really talk about things that\nhappened and i don't really know if\nthat's\nhealthy or not and so for what i went\nthrough with my breakup i forgive\ntristan\ni don't think he's a bad person i think\nwe all make mistakes we're humans but\nit's only going to hurt me if i'm\nholding on to this anger and playing\nthis victim role i don't believe in\nbeing a victim i believe in okay this\nhappened to me let's figure it out let's\npush through it and maybe if i'm open\nand honest about it it can help other\npeople\nfeel like\nit's okay\nwe're all human we're all gonna get\nthrough things but you also can't\ncondemn somebody else for just either\nsinning differently than you did or i\njust feel like we're all we're all so\nquick to\nyou know uh exile people and it's just\nso\nheavy to me and so something i'm just\nfocusing on is\nmaking sure i'm healed from that or as\nmuch as i can and try to understand it\nas much as i can\nand then don't distract myself right now\nand so i just try to have a lot of\nme time in the mornings and that's where\ni kind of filter through that i think\nhearing that's beautiful i don't think\nyeah no just listening to you say that i\nwas like wow like how what a beautiful\nplace to be in thank you i feel really\ngood like i feel that i do i'm proud of\nmyself because i think so many people\nit's natural to almost\nbe the victim it's natural when like\nespecially when you're on this platform\nand the whole world is like oh i feel so\nbad for you it's like okay thank you but\nthis has also happened to i'm sure\nhundreds of other people before not\nsaying it's right i'm just saying i'm\nnot going to die we're all fine and i\nwant to show my daughter that it's okay\nand it's a beautiful thing to also\nforgive her dad he's a great person\nit's you know maybe him and i weren't\ncompatible or whatever on that way but\nthat's okay like nobody's going to die\nhere and i always want true to be\nsurrounded by love\nand i know babies feel energy we feel\nenergy and i just want her to always\nfeel\njust\nbliss as much as i can that's so\nincredible i know it's not realistic\nevery day but as much as i can control\nit i feel like it's my\nmama bear job to control it\ni think so yeah well well when i'm when\ni'm hearing you say that i'm feeling the\nenergy of what you're saying and to me\nit sounds like the\nyou know i don't think i don't think\nwhat you're presenting is an ideal\nimpossible i think what you're\npresenting is a very real opportunity to\nsay it's my child i want her to have\nthis environment and i'm going to work\nreally hard for her to have this\nenvironment whatever that means oh it's\nhard yeah it's not easy for me it's you\nknow it would be easier for me to keep\nmy daughter away and be like no because\nyou hurt me but he never hurt true like\nyou know what i mean like him and i have\nour own relationship and then tristan\nand true have theirs and i will never\ncome in between that i don't believe in\nthat but i\nattest that to my parents were\nincredible co-parenters from what i know\nthey brought my mom and my dad i'm sure\nfought all the time\nnot around us i would never know um my\nsister courtney and my i like he's like\nmy brother scott they're incredible\nco-parenters and\nas long as it's not\nhurting you in any way like\nif this was hindering courtney's growth\nor if it hinders my growth then you have\nto also put yourself first because you\nare in fact taking care of your children\nbut if it's not hindering you or hurting\nyou in any way i think it's important to\nwork on all relationships\nyeah i read something the other day that\nkind of i feel really articulates what\nyou're saying it said\nletting go is hard but holding on is\nharder\nand and that's the choice almost that we\nhave in these tough situations and the\nway you're sharing it is just amazing by\nthe way like i'm just thank you yeah i\nmean i mean or i think it's incredible\nwith that gosh thank you you and all of\nme\ni mean it i'm not just saying it no\nthat's something i mean it because i i\nthink\ni'm sure there's so many people\nlistening right now\nwho can relate to circumstances in your\nlife situations in your life that you've\nbeen through you know we we all know\nthat these are\nthese things happen you know out there\nand and i think\nso many of us hold on for so long and as\nwe know like you said it's hard work\nit's not easy it's it's not just going\nto be plain sailing but the fact is that\nyou can move in that direction you can\nand i've i've been through a lot of\nthings in my past that i think have put\nme here i'm not saying oh it's so easy\nand no it's hard work it definitely is\nbut\ni think with every relationship i've\nbeen in i've always learned kindness is\nreally kindness and understanding\nand\nalso\ni've like one reason why i stopped\nsharing my journaling or my\nlong captions if you will is because\npeople only understand from their level\nof perception as well\nand it would infuriate me when my\nbeautiful\nnotes i'm sure you could understand\nbecause you share so much would be taken\nin a way that i'm like that's not at all\nhow i meant for that to be\nand so\ni can't explain something to someone\nwhen this is only the level of their\nunderstanding and the their want to\nunderstand yeah people also have to have\nthe desire to\nwant to learn more and want to open up\ntheir mind\nto un like if i'm closed up and if i'm\njust some bitter person where i live my\nlife like the world is unjust and why do\nbad things happen to me it's like\nto me there's no good there's no bad\nthings happen it's the energy of the\nworld how you handle it is then again\nanother ripple effect from how i think\nmore things are going to happen to you\nbut if i'm sitting here like life sucks\nlife is so unjust unfair\nall these bad things are happening then\noh my gosh you're just going to attract\nall this heavy stuff but if i'm like\nokay\nthat was not the best but i'm going to\nfigure out why and let me try to move on\nand still let me not misdirect my energy\nlet me try to be happy let me try to\nstill be kind to others as much as you\ncan and you can still hurt but you\nshould also heal and then be responsible\nfor your hurting and not channel it to\nother people yeah i just feel like\nsometimes we're really irresponsible\nwith our feelings\nand we have to be\nresponsible as adults especially adults\nthat are supposed to be\nguiding kids and like our youth you have\nto be a lot more responsible and how we\ndo things yeah that that's so true i\nlove that about being irresponsible with\nour feelings let's explore that a bit\nbecause i think that's such a powerful\nstatement in and of itself\nand this morning literally this morning\ni was sharing this\nuh reflection that i was having on\nsocial media and it was about how\nit's it's tough to start communicating\nwith children but sometimes it's even\nmore tough to communicate with our inner\nchild right and like while we're trying\nto grow up and everything and it's like\nwell you're saying that we're\nirresponsible with all the feelings that\nwere there and we just move on and we\nthink when we move on you've dealt with\nit right but but that healing that\nyou're talking about it's just\nfor me as well like\ni always felt like i was someone who\nmoved on and i was always felt like i\nwas someone who like i didn't get\naffected by that and then i started to\nsee that actually i had behaviors in me\nthat were complete reflections of a past\npain\nright like there were there were\nbehaviors in me that were reflections of\na past guilt right and then i realized\nthat it's not that they just disappeared\nit's that they were going to come out in\na different way that was going to hurt\nfuture relationships it was going to\nhurt present relationships and and for\nme that's where i started to work\nthrough that where i started see\nactually what i saw in whatever it was\ni'm now reflecting that\nlet me look at that behavior and see how\nthat behavior can be healed and\ntransformed right and what's the root of\nthat does that make sense completely and\nalso i think people\nget confused even when you're like no\ni'm i'm totally over that i'm healed you\ncan still talk about things and be\nhealed you can still\ndraw back on those things and say it\nhurt me when\nit did hurt you when but i think\nsometimes people like oh you're done\nwith that euro like why are you talking\nabout this for so long or whatever and\nit's like that's also a form of my\nhealing i hate when other people\nwho have not been through the trauma you\nhave been through any of us because\nwe've all gone through traumas they want\nto tell you\nwhen to stop hurting and that's not\nanybody's place to tell you when to stop\nhurting it's and everybody has a\ndifferent lifespan of pain i think\neverybody will deal with things in\ndifferent what might be\ntraumatizing to me might be nothing to\nyou and vice versa we can't invalidate\npeople's feelings that's only going to\ntraumatize them more and also shame them\ni'm so over like the emotional shaming\nof what people do to other people\npeople can have their feelings and do\nwhat they want\nas long as they're realistic you also\nhave to step outside of your own self\nand be self aware and say okay am i\ncompletely delusional am i making these\nbecause you could also your mind you can\nplay tricks on and you could start\ncreating a false reality as long as\nyou're being i think really authentic\nand genuine about your feelings i think\nit's okay\nto talk about your pains and traumas i\nthink especially if you're doing it in a\nway that's\nbeneficial to other people i think\nthat's\nbeing responsible\num but i think if you're just talking\nabout negative stuff to talk about\nnegative stuff you're like oh my gosh\nshut up already yeah you know there's\nlike there's it's i think you just again\nyou just have to be responsible yeah you\ncan't you i love what you said but you\ncan't put a deadline on someone else's\npain right you can't be the one to\ninvalidate or validate how long someone\nneeds to\ndissect something or break something\ndown and and i think that's such a great\npoint and and you're right that i think\nbut as long as it's realistic do you\nknow what i mean like some people just\ncare they just are negative they just\nhave like a dark cloud over them because\nthey've created that cloud but that's\nrealistically not their reality you look\nat them and you're like what are you\ntalking about and if it was something\nfrom five or ten years ago you're like\nokay babe we gotta not that we're\nputting a deadline on it but let's start\nworking through it let's not sit in the\nbeginning stages of\nwhatever's holding you back so it's the\nbalance that you're talking about it's a\nbalance it's it's it's not either raw\ncorrect because you can't just talk\nabout it forever and you're not doing\nanything about it right at the same time\nyou can't say oh get over it today right\nit's that balance like i can't stand\npeople that are like eating a bucket of\nlike haagen-dazs ice cream look i'm so\nfat and like they won't work out they\nwon't change their diet they won't drink\nmore water they want whatever but\nthey're complaining complaining\ncomplaining i'm like well you're always\ngoing to be in this victimized state\nbecause you're literally not doing any\nyou're not being self-aware you're not\neven looking at your own reflections\nsaying okay what can i do\nto change things about myself it's\neverybody else's fault and what would\nyou say to someone who's in that\nsituation whether it's whatever is\nwhether it's their physical their\nemotional their mental\nhow do we then talk to that person or\ncoach them with compassion out of that\nlike you've done a lot of that work how\ndo you do that with someone else in the\nsame way as we do with ourselves like\nwhat would you say to them it's uh it's\nit really does come from within i think\nwhenever people do things for other\npeople\nit's always you're setting yourself up\nfor failure i think you really genuinely\nhave to want\nto change areas of your life and if you\ndon't just be happy with who you are\num\nit doesn't i don't care physically what\nyou look like your weight whatever as\nlong as you're healthy and happy\ndo you\nbut i know\nfor me i was overweight for like i was\nunhealthy for a lot of my life and then\nwhen i was like i just i started going\nto the gym during my divorce like a\nsignificant and consistent amount\nfor my mental i needed a release and i\nneeded to feel\nstrong and i just needed to get rid of\nall of these thoughts and\ni wanted to be alone and the only place\nto really be alone was being on an\nelliptical with headphones in my ears\nand kind of just vibing out and as a\nside effect i started losing weight and\ni was like oh i kind of like this like\nyou know losing weight and then became\nlike\njust some competitive weird streak in me\nthat it was like i want to see if i can\nget arm muscles i want to see like it\nstarted that but that was never my goal\nwas never i want to look good in a\nbikini that was never my goal it was i\njust wanted to feel good mentally and\ni think when you start putting yourself\nfirst you start feeling so much better\nthere's not a size close that that you\nhave to fit into it's just\nthen you start exploring things like wow\ni like how i feel when i drink more\nwater i like how i feel when i pray in\nthe morning and because of that you\nstart to become happier and lighter and\nthen you start to want to do more things\nbe more active socialize more whatever\nit is and so many studies now show that\neven a small amount of exercise a day\nis so great for the mind and the brain\nand i think that's been underestimated\nfor so long and i know i underestimated\nthat in my life for so long\nwhere you know i was always someone who\nfocused on the mind and kind of\nneglected the body and like pushed the\nbody to limits and then i was just like\noh wait a minute they're all\ninterconnected right you can't just say\noh i'm going to deal with this i'm not\ngoing to deal with this actually when\nyou take care of mind body and soul then\nit starts then you feel the best version\nof yourself correct and and even if\nand that's what i love that even if your\nfirst intention for going to the gym or\ndoing anything is wrong\nas you do it more you'll probably come\nto the right conclusion right right if\nyou stay consistent with something you\ncan usually raise your intentions\ncompletely i have a tv show called\nrevenge buddy and all the people\nit's a show and all these people are\nfrom different walks of life and they\nstart with some trauma and they all come\non the show like i want revenge on and\nit's like it's a play on words revenge\nbody it's not i don't think the best\nrevenge is a good body i choose to play\non words but they come on the show i\nwant revenge on my ex-boyfriend or on my\ndad or whoever and i'm always like okay\nand like the first interview and then\ntowards the show they're feeling so\nbecause they think this good body is\ngoing to want this person's going to\ntreat them good it's like how\nsuperficial and narcissistic are we but\nwe are that's the world we live in and\nso\ntowards the end they never want revenge\non the person it starts out with they\nwant compassion and they're like i and\nor i don't want that boyfriend because i\ndeserve better because i feel better and\nthe show they think it's all physical\nbut what we do we kind of break them\ndown mentally to\nself-reflect and look at themselves and\nfigure out what got them here to this\nplace because you can't always blame\nsomebody else for why you are the way\nthat you are you have to be accountable\ntoo\nand that's something that\nit means it's\nmeans so much to me that through that\nshow people get to\nsee that a little bit that you might it\nmight start off one way but that's it's\nall about internal at the end of the day\nyeah whatever gets you started is\nusually a good thing because at least it\ngets you in there but but what i love\nabout what you've just said is that\nit's just\nanything that\nanything that gets us started is a good\nplace to start but when you're giving\nsomeone the power to make you feel\nbeautiful you've also just given them\nthe power to make you feel ugly right\nand so completely you're just\nalways giving away your power if you\ndon't upgrade that intention and i think\nwe see that in every part whether it's\nour body our mind our\nintellect our academics whatever all\nthese expectations of others the more\nwe're looking for someone to say yes\nyou're amazing now yeah it's like you're\nwaiting for that statement you could\nwait your whole life for it it could\nnever come right and it also almost\ncould become an addiction\nlike people they might not it might not\nbe good enough for one from one person\nthey need it from\nthousands and this or whatever but it's\nnot that it's because they need to hear\nit from within you need to tell yourself\nyou're beautiful you're dope you're so\nsmart whatever it is but they don't feel\nit they don't believe it so when people\nkeep telling them you're such a good\nperson they don't believe it at all\nthat's why they keep trying to find\nvalidation in empty things\ni love that that's amazing you've you've\ntalked about things that you do like\ngratitude journaling prayer what else do\nyou do on a daily basis that you don't\nnegotiate with you're like i have to\nobviously exercise too\nyeah working\nout yeah that one too what else is there\nin your day that you just like i can't\nnegotiate with this like this has to be\nsomething that i must do every day every\nweek\num are those\nthose are pretty much the core i mean\nit's praying\nand working out or like my two that i do\nbasically every single day and like\nyesterday i did my schedule wrong or no\nthe day before i did my schedule wrong\nso i missed my workout and i was like oh\nlike i felt\nno i felt fine i went along my day but i\njust when i realized that i did my\nschedule wrong i was like oh my god i'm\nso bummed because what it does i'm not\nlike it just clears my head i feel so\ngood afterwards so whatever that is for\npeople it doesn't have to be what your\nnon-negotiables are or mine it's just i\nthink everybody has to have\nthose there are like i think they they\nfuel me\nyeah you talked about working with your\nfamily which i think is fascinating\nin in the first sense because\nit's an amazing thing that you're\nconstantly surrounded by working with\nuh\nyou know just you're just in that\nenvironment all the time and you said\nthat you're good at moving on and\nforgiving each other which i think is an\nincredible quality as well like what's\nthat like to to deal with every day and\nhow are you how are you learning more\nfrom that experience like what are you\nlearning from that i think it's one of\nthe best blessings in the world that i\nget to say that my job is being with my\nfamily every day um when this first\nstarted we were much younger i think it\nwas 23 or 24.\ni'm still 23 or 24. i don't know how\nthat works but yeah we're in the same\nday yeah i'm like what um but it\nyou know norm when you get older you all\nhave your own families and kids and\nnot that anything happens but you\nnormally see your family\nholiday is not as frequently we see each\nother every single day and i'm honored\nto be able to do that yes there causes\nmore fighting or tension but the thing\nthat i've learned about my family is we\nare loyal and we no matter what\ndisagreement we have or whatever we'll\nalways figure it out we're not a family\nthat's like i haven't spoke to my sister\nin seven years like\ni don't know how people do that and\nwe are very understanding of each other\num\nand i just think it's a really great\ndynamic like we're understanding of\nif we're all going through something or\nwhatever we really try to be there for\none another and support them through\nthat\nand i just think it's\ni think it's important to show our kids\nabout family unity or to show that you\nknow two heads are better than one three\nare better than two we're not\ncompetitive with one another and\nwhatever\nwe each want to do we support each other\nuntil the end and i i think today's\nworld everyone's like in a battle to\nwho's the best and who's this and who's\nthat and\nwhen we first started i remember like\ninterviewers would always say so like do\nyou guys go after the same men or do you\nlike they would always like our\nquestions would be more they would\nalmost want us to fight they didn't they\ncouldn't stand that we it was just\nreally like\nno we just love each other and i don't\nknow why people love\nsomething salacious and twisted rather\nthan\nbeautiful and\njust\nkind\nright\nno but i mean it's true and it's\ninteresting but that's you know i guess\ngood stories don't sell that's why yeah\nand i think we can change that like the\nreason why i do what i do and what i\nreally believe in and why we've\nconnected and what i love about our\nconnection is i genuinely believe\nthat if we keep giving people if we if\nwe keep shooting for the lowest common\ndenominator for people then they'll\nsettle for that right like if you only\nput junk food in front of someone yeah\nthey're gonna take that and eat that\nright but if you put healthy food that\nmaybe looks and tastes like junk food\nbut that's you know really amazing then\nmost people will switch right and i feel\nthe same is true of media i feel the\nsame is true of stories i feel the same\nis true of everything i i believe that\npeople are more beautiful deeper\nand smarter than we believe and we don't\ngive we don't always give everyone an\nopportunity to live to that and\ntherefore people with influence people\nwith responsibility people with power\ncan either choose to sell something that\nshoots at the lowest common easy thing\nto shoot at and it's easier to sell\ngarbage quite frankly it's so much\neasier\nbut\nwe are the ones with the influence of\nthe power to say no actually let's let's\nmake people right aspire for the higher\nthat we know that's inside of them right\nyeah it's interesting i get so many\npeople will comment negatively when i\npost almost positive things i have i\nhave ups and downs i have a handful of\nsupportive handful of oh my gosh get\nover yourself or whatever and i'm like\nyou need this the most like it's so you\ncan tell the people that are really\nsuffering the most because they're so\nquick to condemn and to\njust\ntake the junk food they just want the\nbad stuff they can't handle the good\nthings and especially when it's\nconsistent because that's just\ni post for me i don't post for other\npeople like i'm like this is for me i\nneed to hear those messages\nand if i need to hear it i'm hoping at\nleast one other person does\nand but it's interesting that you can\nsee right off like the people that are\nresistant to it because\nsome people don't\nthey also don't want to open their mind\nup to becoming better people because\nsometimes your own comfort will restrict\nyou from your own happiness though\nbecause they're too afraid to step away\nfrom their comfort zone they would\nrather just be complacent\ninstead of actually finding like\nsomething that really makes them happy\nand excited about life yeah and i think\ni remember being there sometimes too and\nand so like what you were saying earlier\nof like having empathy towards that\nperson and then\npraying for them and hopefully opening\nthe door for them one day or having you\nknow wherever they're gonna find that\nbecause i do believe that the more we\nhave these conversations publicly openly\nthe more these kind of messages\ncirculate and go viral and get shared\nthe more people feel the permission and\nthe reflection to look within themselves\nit's almost like if it's not out there\nif you've never heard it from your\nparents if you've never heard it from\nyour teachers right you've never heard\nit from your best friend growing up or\nthe person you looked up to it's kind of\na lot of this stuff we expect people to\nhave self-taught but it's not it's\nsomething you have to hear from someone\nthat you look up to or inspired by that\nkind of gets you going it's interesting\nyou said give yourself permission to\nlook inside yourself and it's\nit blows my mind that so many people do\nfeel like they need the permission yeah\nwhen you're in control of your own self\nbut so many people\nthey want to be like sheep they just\nwant to be told what to do and let me\nfollow the herd and that's just it's\nmind-blowing to me yeah\nyeah it is it is tell me something that\nyou've learned from true and something\nyou're trying to teach her\nbecause so many of us because her energy\non hi felika\nmalika that's my best friend\nso nice to see you thanks for being here\nyeah nice to meet you i'll give you a\nbig hug in a moment yeah yeah later\ndefinitely uh but but i i i know that\nyou post so much about her\nwe've we've spoken about her i think her\nenergy radiates straight off the page\nyou know my team was speaking about her\nearlier as well like\nyeah what what has she taught you and\nwhat are you trying to teach her\ni'm asking this because i haven't had\nkids yet oh my god no she's and it's\ninteresting i never\nlike you can feel your child's\npersonality and\nlike she's a really good person she's\nhas empathy already for other people\nand it's\nit sounds crazy that you can know that\nbut you can i never really understood\nthat until i had a child and i've always\nhad patience i'm i'm good with patient\ni've always loved kids\nbut she gives you a different\nkind of patience and when you feel\nthat like you're exhausted and you can't\ngo on with your day when you're around\nyour own child you get this surge of\nenergy and you're just like oh i got to\nkeep going like\nyou you just figure it out and so she\njust gives me\ni think more of a drive and\nto stay fit to stay healthy because i\nwant to be an active mom with her i want\nto be here as long as i can\num\nbut i would say it's a different type of\npatience i think it's a softer patience\nand i mean i've always been goofy i've\nalways been silly so my inner child is\nthere and i will be the first one to\nplay and be wild and i don't care how i\nlook like i'm like i'll be an animal it\ndoesn't matter\nbut i mean you're just like reliving\nyour childhood again it's fun yeah oh\nthat's awesome yeah so that's what she's\nteaching you she's and she's also she's\ntaught me so much more understanding\nfrom my mom\nand\nyou just realized that i think when\nyou're a kid you'd think your parents\nare\nsuperheroes and they are but you still\nhave to understand\nthey're just humans\nthey're still\nlike i'm just a person doctors are just\npeople we give everybody so much power\nand they're allowed to make mistakes\nthey're allowed to not know what they're\ndoing\nmy mom didn't have google how the hell\ndid she figure things out like now me\ni'm like i don't know can kids have\nhoney\ni have no idea i ask my phone and i get\nthe answer\nback then it's like i have so much more\ncompassion i think for my mom and if\nwhen i was a teenager and i'm like oh\nwhy'd you do this to me when i was a kid\nand whatever and i'm like\nbecause she didn't know yeah she had\nlike you know i feel like you just i\nhave more understanding and compassion\nfor my mom yeah absolutely i love that\nwe did a part i did a podcast about\nthree weeks ago and it was called six\nreasons why we need to develop the\nemotional skills our parents didn't have\nand one of them was to recognize how\nhard it is yeah and and the second one\nwas to build compassion because of how\nhard it is and to recognize what you\njust said like the\nthe ease at which we have information\nthe more conversations about parenting\nnow and like more research that's been\ndone right and you look at parents\nbefore all they had was just what their\nparents told them and then that was\npassed down and passed down and passed\nright so yeah that's a beautiful lesson\ni'm excited to see what i learned when\nwhen i have children yeah but those are\ndefinitely beautiful ones\nyeah it is the best yeah those are\ndefinitely beautiful ones that i can i\ncan take forward what is it that's on\nyour mind right now that when we were\ntalking and we decided to do this what\nwas there that was in your heart that\nyou were like yeah i really want to\nshare this i want to talk about this\nthat we haven't kind of dived into right\nnow you're like there's something on my\nmind that\nno i feel like i mean i was so excited\njust to sit with you and to have this\nnatural conversation i feel like we've\ntouched a lot of topics and i love that\ni didn't want it to be too contrived and\nabout promoting something i just wanted\nit to be like a beautiful conversation\nso i appreciate that and i feel like i\ndon't know is there anything else\nthinking no that was the same for me my\nintention was to just\ni wanted to hold space to just\nhear you and let you talk and share\nbecause\nlike i said at the start from any\nconversation we've had\ni just think that\nyour journey of figuring it out sharing\nthis positive message that energy is so\nawesome and i want everyone to\nexperience that thank you and and that's\nwhat my intention was and and i think\ni've had that today i'm sitting here\nlistening to you going i've just learned\nso many things today oh my gosh and\nthat's the thing i think i our show is\nour show and that's a\nthat's a piece of me i don't blame\nanything like on editing that's who i am\nthat's one but that's one\nlayer of who i am\nand i don't really get to\ndivulge in this layer of who i am i mean\ni do little bits here or there on\ninstagram yeah but sometimes like i said\nit's hard because people\ntear it apart from what they ever what\ntheir level is to perceive something and\nsometimes that discourages me from\nwanting to share because that's not at\nall\nwhat i meant but when you're able to\nreally vocalize something and have a\nnatural dialogue it's sometimes it's\neasier to share how you feel so thank\nyou for giving me this platform to do so\nno of course that's i mean that's what i\nlove about podcast in the first place\nbut also just like\nyeah just being able to dissect the\ntopic for like 30 minutes 40 minutes\nlike\nthat's we need more of that to also\nunderstand people better and give people\nan opportunity but i'm hoping that we're\ngoing to continue seeing you share your\nwork i'm hoping that we're going to see\nmore of your journals i'm hoping and\npraying that we're going to see more of\nthat expression thank you because i\ntruly believe it's helping people\nand the the percentages are always going\nto be in your favor because i think the\namount of people that are good and\nseeking good and are starting with good\nintentions are so much more powerful and\nstronger and i want you to feel that so\nthank you well you're definitely a huge\nlike motivation i know for so many\npeople that i know and it's i know it's\nscary and sometimes really daunting and\nheavy because so many people do\nsomeone like you turn to you because i\nknow the little amount that people turn\nto me and i'm not some self-help\nretired monk are you a retired monk yeah\ni don't know who am i former monk i\ndon't know what the proper term is no no\nbut like\ni could only imagine\nhow draining it gets for you because\npeople are requiring so much of your\nenergy but you know keep going because\nyou've helped me in so many ways and\njust by remember the first time i ever\nheard about you someone sent me a\nyoutube video of you was before i found\nyou on instagram and i i was like\nwho is this man he is you're so moving\nyou're so genuine and kind with what\nyou're saying\nand from what i feel non-judgmental and\nit's just a really\namazing\ntrait that you have and i know you're\nhelping a lot of people and you've made\nme feel like it's okay to share more\nthings and that's why i like to share\nmore other people's stuff\nbecause i feel like people sometimes\nthey get too critical if they think it's\njust mine and they need to know that\nit's okay to share\nlove and kindness the way that you do so\nthank you yeah and thank you for\nencouraging people like me i'm humbled\nby hearing that from you and\nit means the world it it really does\nbecause\nthere's a beautiful statement that was\nsaid by martin luther king and he was\ntalking about how like those who love\npeace\nneed to learn to organize themselves as\nwell as those who love war\nand and i think that those of us who are\nin this mission and purpose of wanting\nto spread kindness and and not just in\nlike this positive movement sort of way\nlike i think like real work real healing\nreal transformation not just like let's\nbe happy not that kind of stuff but\nlet's really do the work let's really\nheal right i think it's it's really\nencouraging when we work together and we\nencourage each other and and help to\nbuild stuff together and sometimes\npeople find it so\nlike oh you guys are just so happy it's\nlike i'm not happy all the time yeah i\nyou know i have my moments and i'm still\nvery like there's things i'm like oh\nreally i have to do that or whatever but\nthen i have to also be like okay no i\nget to do that like i have to change my\nthinking i have to talk to myself\nsometimes so it's not like once you have\nthis mentality you're always in it it's\njust a great reminder for ourselves and\nalso just to change\nyour wording from i have to to i get to\nlike little things like that if you just\ntry if you're just aware\nit would help you i think people think\nit's all so too\noverwhelming to\njust be kind or and like you said it's a\nlittle\ntwo percent not even after five percent\nyou know like it could just be a little\nbit and what that shift will do for\nyourself yeah yeah that's awesome well\ni'm hoping that anyone who listens to or\nwatches this conversation uh feels the\nenergy that i'm feeling right now from\nyou and from being in this space and\nhearing everything you've been saying i\nhope that they get to feel that too and\ni hope that they carry that throughout\ntheir day and their year and we all\ncontinue to heal and grow together\nbecause we're all figuring it out\ntogether we are\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love\nsomeone making someone like your\npossession like you have to keep them or\ndon't do this or you're going to lose\nthem that's really bad advice"
