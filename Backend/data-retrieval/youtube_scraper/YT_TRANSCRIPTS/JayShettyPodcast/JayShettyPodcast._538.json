we've been hanging out a\ncouple of times this year excited to\nshare that part of the story as well\nevery time i've sat down with you you've\ntold me stories you've told me moments\nof your life your childhood\nand i love people who\ncommunicate their life in such an\ninteresting way\nand i was just saying to you before we\nstarted taping that you have one of the\nhardest jobs in the world which is\nkeeping 18 to 21 year olds\nexcited enthusiastic and engaged in the\nlearning process so i'm going to be like\na student today asking you questions in\na lecture hall uh but first of all i\nwanted to start by saying it's your five\nyear wedding anniversary congratulations\nthank you thank you so much amazing yeah\nit's been five years since we got\nmarried today and we started dating when\nwe were in business school my husband\nand i 15 years ago wow\nthat's pretty unbelievable thank you\nthank you that's amazing actually my\nhusband got me the cutest gift this\nmorning tell me about it and so for five\nyears it's wood and so my husband is in\nconsulting and he would travel a lot\nbefore he probably will start traveling\na lot again\nwhat he got me is a\na heart box um it's a wood box but it\nhas a heart on it and it basically sends\nyou messages so you can look at it it's\nplugged into the wall\nand then the heart starts to spin and\nthat means somebody sent you a message\nand they can do it from their phone you\nopen up the box and there's a digital\npicture and a message in there\nand so today before i came\ni this heart was spinning and i looked\nat it and i opened it and i was like\nwait what is this and it says i am your\nrock today and always oh wow and there\nwas a picture of our troops\nno he's here today but he wanted me to\nsee it so that now when he travels he\ncan just send me messages and then the\nheart spins so i know a message is\ncoming in it is the cutest thing my six\nyear wedding anniversary just went like\na couple of weeks ago and\nrather he said to me she goes and we\nhaven't seen each other she's in london\nand her rule was she was like you're not\nallowed to send me anything i don't want\nanything i just want to see you and then\nwhen i see you then we can celebrate so\ni wasn't allowed to send my wife\nanything because that was her order and\nher rule because she knows that i\nusually grow quite over the top but that\nis a beautiful idea i love that thank\nyou i can't wait to meet your husband\nthat's awesome yeah i can't wait for you\nto meet him also it's um it's just been\ninteresting ray and it's a big deal for\nus the five year because we had a long\nroad to getting married it was a bit\ndifferent from a cultural standpoint my\nparents are traditionally indian as you\nknow and he's not\nand\nmy parents now love him they absolutely\nlove him and we have two of the most\nbeautiful adorable children i have a\none-year-old and a three-year-old and\nit's so amazing how when you really want\nyou can make things happen and make it\nall come together it's beautiful yeah\ntell us tell us a bit about that journey\nbefore we dive into\nthe depths of your journey and each part\nof it i want to hear a bit about\nwhat is that like first of all dating\nsomeone a business school someone that\nyour parents\nmay not initially culturally accept\nbut then going on that journey to now\nbeing in a place where he's loved you\nhave this beautiful family together\nbecause i think for a lot of people\nlistening\nthey may face\nelements of that in their journey\nwhatever that dysfunction or challenge\nmay be in business school a lot of\npeople made a joke and they said\nwomen are just here to get their mrs\nnot just get their mba\nand i ended up dating someone in school\nand it was really challenging you know\ngetting married after all of that and i\nalways felt that i had to prove myself\nmore that i wasn't just here for that\nreason and it was very interesting and\nthere is a\nunconscious bias that not only other\npeople have but we have on ourselves and\ni don't know if years later anybody was\nlooking at me anything differently\nbecause i did marry somebody when i was\nin business school from business school\nbut i looked at myself a little bit\ndifferently and i felt like i need to\nwork harder i need to strive more to\nprove myself to myself i wish i would\nhave let a lot of that go\nbecause we just get caught up in all\nthese small trivial things which aren't\nnecessary\nand it's you know pushing a boulder\nuphill to prove to ourselves that we're\nokay and i wish i would have let that go\nthat's the first one\nthe second thing\nwas\ngoing through it with my parents\nand it was very very hard and it was\nvery challenging and there were a lot of\ntimes jason my now husband's name we\nbroke up got back together broke up got\nback together\nbecause it was am i letting my family\ndown am i not doing things right\nand\nin the end it worked out\nbut it was the hardest thing and it was\na journey that i never thought i would\ngo through i remember when i got engaged\ni took my ring home i hid it in my\nwallet my engagement ring because i was\nscared how am i going to tell my parents\nit was the hardest time of my life i'll\nnever forget it was around thanksgiving\nand again in hindsight it's 20 20 it was\ngoing to work out we're going to have\nthe cutest kids everything is going to\nwork but\ngoing against the grain\nwhatever that might be in your life\nwhile it seems really challenging\nand while you might have different\nexpectations put on by other people onto\nyou or you think that other people have\non you\nat the end of the day you have to do\nwhat is authentic to you\nand what you think is important to you\nand i know this might seem a little bit\nfar-fetched but i've recently been\nreally reading and learning a lot about\nthe concept of faith and sometimes you\njust have to have faith\nyou have to have faith that it's going\nto work you have to have faith that i\ncan take a leap and it's going to happen\nand that's very hard for somebody like\nme who's a planner accounting and\nfinance background right so\nit was it was definitely a process and\nit's great now\nit's amazing\nbut jay it was really hard\nthis idea that\nwomen go to business school\nto get married i mean it's incredible to\nme to hear that that idea had seeped in\nto that\nplace because you're at this reputable\nschool you're you're getting this\nincredible qualification and the fact\nthat that's the rumor mill\naround the space i mean\nnow when you're someone who's been so\nextremely successful in finance as an\nentrepreneur as a business person\ntell me a bit about\nwhere that discrepancy began in your\nlife where you started to feel like you\nhad to work harder where you started to\nfeel like people look to you in a\ncertain way and what were the actual\nsteps you took to keep confident to keep\nfocused\nto keep driven\non that journey because when i meet you\ntoday one thing i do appreciate about\nyou is that\nalthough you're a very\npowerful business person\ni don't believe that you've lost the\nability to have a compassionate heart or\nthe ability to connect\nwith the ability to be mindful and\nthoughtful like it seems like those are\nvery balanced for you a lot of that\ncompassion and empathy comes from what i\nhad to go through\nand it was really hard and i'm so happy\nto see things\nchanging so much in the world right now\nit's great\nbut you know as a young girl it is it is\nhard i was always interested in\naccounting and finance my dad is a\nfinancial planner\nand so we grew up with him always\nwanting to tell\nand teach me and my younger sister\nabout personal finance so we could be\nindependent and we could do things\nand i remember i was working in banking\nand i was in a credit training program\nand i remember another guy saying to me\nwhy are you doing this you could just\nthrow parties be a party planner\nand it was really hard for me to hear\nthat\nand it was a lot of moments like that\nthat had me say i'm gonna work harder\ni'm gonna work smarter i'm gonna work\nstronger i'm going to do what i have to\ndo to excel\nand we can look at a lot of those things\nand say they were bad but in some way\nshape or form i think everybody goes\nthrough something\nwhether you're a woman whether you're a\nmale whether you're a person of color\nwhatever it is you go through something\nand we can either\nlook at those things and we can let them\nbeat us down and sometimes i did jay\nbut we also can take those as an\nopportunity\nto push ourselves harder\nand it all comes down to\nattitude of how we're going to view\nthese things how we're going to look at\nthis and again i i want to be clear a\nlot of times they did beat me down and\nit was really tough\nbut you have to constantly find yourself\nand create yourself to be resilient\nand to bounce back up and to deal with\nall the things that can come your way no\nmatter from where\nit's so\ndifficult because\nyou realize that there are challenges\nthat everyone goes through but when\nit's like a whole gender is treated a\nspecific way that that you know is is a\nmuch larger challenge i i saw this video\na few years ago that i think\nsummed it up brilliantly\nso in this video\nthey had\nblue balls and pink balls\nand they asked a 10 year old boy and a\n10 year old girl their job was to go and\npick the blue balls up for the boy and\nthe pink\nballs up for the girl and they had to\ncollect them and put them inside this\ncontainer\nso the boy ran off he started picking up\nall the blue balls it was the same\namount as the pink balls as girls ran\nout they filled their containers up they\npretty much finished around the same\ntime\nand then they gave the boy this huge jar\nof sweets\nand they gave the girl like three\nquarters the jar of sweets and the whole\nvideo was to show the gender pay gap and\nhow men and women doing the same work\nare rewarded differently\ntalk to me about how you've\nseen that in the industry like did your\nfriends who identified as women from\nbusiness school have they gone on to\nfeel satisfied and accomplished in their\ncareers or are they noticing those\ndiscrepancies along the way as well and\nand for yourself and your path that you\ntook too i think what's really\ninteresting is a lot of people talk\nabout the pay gap and all of these\nthings which which are there and they're\napparent\nbut what i think a lot of times is\nmissing is the type of careers that you\nsee a lot of people go into and the\nquestion would be why\nso in business school for example the\nschool that i went to the majority of\nwomen went into marketing we have\ndifferent verticals we have a marketing\nvertical finance et cetera\nin the finance vertical there were three\nwomen total\nin the marketing vertical i'd say like\n90 of them were female\nnow certain industries pay more than\nother industries that's the way of the\nworld right now right or wrong it's kind\nof how that works right now right\nwhat i think is very important\nis taking the time to educate and allow\nfor opportunities for women at younger\nages\nto show them that there's different\nthings that they can do\nso here's an interesting thing\nwhen i was in junior high we had an\nelective course we could choose and you\ncould either take home act or wood shop\nand jay i i really wanted to take wood\nshop like i really was excited to like\ncut these things and create things i\nthought it was amazing\nand all the girls were going to take\nhome eck\nand i remember\nasking my mom like what should i do all\nthe other girls are doing this they're\ntaking this class my dad jumped in and\nsaid no you do what you want\nand i ended up taking wood shop\nand i'm glad i did but it's just so\ninteresting that even when i was taking\nwood shop i kept thinking\ndid i do the right thing\nwhat are my friends doing in the other\nclass am i being left out\nso i had a lot of that that was there\nso i come back to\ni think it's really important we see a\nlot of things right now like stem\nprograms that are created or there are\nsome great programs like girls who code\nto teach women how to do these things at\nyounger ages and i think they're\nphenomenal\nand i think we should continue to create\nmore things like that in finance and\naccounting\none of the things i do on my own part is\ni also teach\nand so i think that getting to people at\nyounger ages not to steer them in a\ncertain direction\nbut basically to let them know that\ntheir options\nand you get to choose what those options\nare regardless of your male or female\nyou're someone obviously who's so\nwell-educated you've gone to great\nschools gone on to become an\nentrepreneur i wonder there's a lot of\ndebate right now about the value of a\ncollege education and business school\ntoo\nand what i'm fascinated by is two things\nagain here and you can answer them in\nany order you like the the first one is\ndo you see a genuine value and\ncorrelation\nbetween the education you got and the\nsuccess you have today\nthat's the first question and the second\nquestion is if someone didn't have the\nopportunity\nto have the education that you've had\nwhether it was access capability\ninterest at the time whatever their\nreasoning may be\nhow do they today build up\nfinancial literacy\ngoal planning\nunderstanding of their investments\nunderstanding of how they manage their\nmoney so my dad was an electrical\nengineer by education he came here and\nhe's now a financial planner and i\nremember when i was in college i thought\ni was pretty cheeky and i said dad\ni mean did your education do anything\nfor you like why do i have to work so\nhard you're doing something completely\ndifferent\nand he said to me said neha listen my\neducation gave me the framework\nfrom which i can have a way to think\nand he said i've been successful at my\njob\nbecause i had that education that i had\nnow after\nyou know having graduated a long time\nago\ni can say the same i can say that my\neducation in undergrad and grad school\nand everything that came between and\naround it\nhas absolutely helped shape who i am and\nthe success that i've had to date\ncompletely can you tell us how\nlike what parts of it i love what you\nsaid about your father saying that it\ngave him a framework of how to think\nwhat what did it do for you\nbusiness school was a great one because\nwhat it did is it gave us a breath of\nknowledge\nof how to look at companies so now when\ni'm evaluating companies for the fund or\nback when i was in banking\nit gave me a proper understanding of how\nto think and what to look at and if you\nthink about it right experience that we\nget from people in academia et cetera\nit's just trying to learn things at an\naccelerated rate now could you learn\nthem on your own absolutely you could\nright maybe one day we'll get to the\npoint where we're like the matrix the\nmovie where you get plugged in\nyeah and then all the information comes\nin so the way i view academia is it's\nyou go four years for a college degree\nor whatever it is that you do but you're\ntrying to learn the information at an\naccelerated rate so instead of you\nhaving to try and learn and figure these\nthings out it takes a quicker time like\ni'll give you a quick example\nyou might already know this right but\nare dogs colorblind\nyes dogs are colorblind right i told you\nthat information that took me a second\nto tell you you might have known it you\nmight not have known it yeah\nnow\nif somebody had to go figure that out on\ntheir own it's months and months of\nstudy and research to figure that out so\nwhat education allows us to do is learn\nthings at an accelerated rate\nhaving said that your second part of\nyour question does everybody need to\nhave a formalized education and what i'm\ngoing to say is not very popular\nespecially in the world of academics\nbut no\nnot everyone needs to go down that\ntraditional path so if you think about\nit back in the day where what really\nshifted education the first thing was\nthe printing blocks\nbefore you had to have a teacher now you\ncan have books so\ninformation can be easily accessed\nthrough these textbooks instead of just\nfrom one person talking\nthen later if you think about it online\nlearning and education came up so now\nyou have that big shift over there\ni think that there's multiple different\nways that people can get access to\neducation and information\nand i think that the pandemic it was\nalready going to happen\nthe pandemic just accelerated that\nand i think it's amazing yeah it's just\nfascinating because when i think about\nmy own education i feel the same way i\nwent to\nmy high school was where it started i\nwent to a pretty\nrough and tough elementary school\nthe education was okay\ni was surrounded by a group of people\nthat didn't have the\nparenting structure that i did when my\nparents were already forcing me to study\nhard i was one of probably three people\nthat ended up going to a grammar school\nor a school that you had to take an exam\nto get into in in england\nmy parents couldn't afford to send me to\na private school so grammar school was\nthe next best thing where you got a\nprivate school education for free by\npassing an exam\nand so\nthat school is where everything changed\nfor me because all of a sudden i went\nfrom being like one of three people who\nwas at the top to being literally like\nin the middle of a bunch of really smart\npeople\nit was almost trained to us in how to\nwork hard to how to compete how to build\nnow not everyone liked that environment\na lot of people actually look back at\ntheir time there and go i would never\nsend my kid there\nand that's why i think it's so\ninteresting to think of people are so\nunique right what works for us doesn't\nwork for everyone which is what you just\nsaid which which is i completely agree\nwith that that\nyou know maybe i'll have a child one day\nwho wouldn't have flourished in the\nenvironment i flourished in or who\nwouldn't have gravitated towards the\nteachers that i gravitated towards\nand so for me i look at my education as\nhaving a massive impact on me because i\nvalue\nbeing really right-brained and creative\nbut having been given lots of logical\nhard-wired structural thinking and i\nthink that where i am today is because i\ncan toggle between those two things and\nmy education gave me the hard-wired\nlogical rational brain but then i had\nteachers that allowed me to bring out my\nartistry and creativity which is what i\nvalue myself for and what i love about\nmyself it is really interesting because\ni look back at education and go actually\ni learned a ton of stuff too and i think\nthe mistake we make is we look at our\neducation and we go\ni don't do that for work today\nand that is probably true i mean it's\ndefinitely true for my life but it's not\nwhat i do for work today it's well what\ndid i take and what did i collect and\nwhat did i grasp and what did i put into\nmy tool kit yeah that actually today\nmakes me better at making decisions or\nmakes me better at doing this or that so\nyes was my education directly correlated\nto my career no\nbut were there skills and lessons and\ntools and that's what i'm hearing you\nsay as well i think correct we we feel\naligned on that when you're teaching\ntoday right like you're an academic now\nyou're a professor you're like you're\nteaching\nwhat i find really interesting about\nthat part of your life is\nhow much of what you're teaching do you\nthink or do you encourage people to go\nout into the real world and practice\nbecause i know you have lots of\ninteresting methods that you've shared\nwith me before talk to me a bit about\nhow you think teaching has transformed\nand how you're transforming teaching\nbecause a lot of people who are\nlistening or watching they may be\ncoaches they may have online schools i\nknow a lot of our audience are\ntrainers who have studios or online apps\nand platforms and things like that yeah\nhow can they think\ndeeper and differently about teaching in\ntoday's day and age get away from just\nthe textbook or just the content in the\ntextbook and to really get the students\nthe opportunity to understand how that\nconnects to the world whatever the topic\nis so right now one of the courses i'm\nactually teaching it right now is\nentrepreneurial accounting and finance\nand what i do is every week when i start\noff class i start off with a quote\nit could be any quote from anyone\nrecently i had one from napoleon hill\nand i won't quote it exactly right but\nit was something about\njust get started the tools will start to\ncome into place once you get started and\ni told the students in class and this is\nthe part is so i start off with the\nquote and then i give them an action\nitem every week at the beginning of the\nweek\nthe action item for this specific quote\nwas during class i want you to think of\ntwo things any two things that you've\nbeen thinking about doing and you just\nhaven't been doing you've been dragging\nyour feet it could be a homework\nassignment it could be that you need to\ntalk to someone it could be that you\nwant to ask somebody out on a date or\ndinner whatever it is but i want you to\nthink about it during class\nand then\ni want you to write it down at the end\nof class and then in the next week i\nwant you get an action and i want you to\ndo it\nand so the reason i told them to do it\nduring class\nis because if i gave them a day or two\ndays they're going to overthink it\nthere's already something there for them\nin their mind of i need to do this and i\nwanted that to come out right away and\nnot overthink it that's the first part\nthe second thing i also did\nis i actually went around the class and\nlooked at everybody and i asked for an\nacknowledgement if you just say\nsomething to people that doesn't mean\nit's going to cause action in them but\nwhat i actually did is i looked at\neveryone and i said okay okay okay and\ni'm looking for the uh uh-huh from each\nperson an acknowledgement how many\npeople is this uh about 43. okay wow\nthere's a lot of nodding there's yeah\nyeah no no no it's good yeah i like it\nwe went through that and they all said\nyes\nthe most interesting thing happened is\nthat i have one set of office hours\nright after class i already had students\ncoming in after that class telling me\nabout the things that they're going to\ndo\nright and so\nwhen it comes towards back to your\noriginal question right or what are some\ntechniques or methods i might use in\nregards to education and teaching and\nwork to transform it\nso many people get caught up in the\ntechnical items\nback in the day before if you were\nteaching formulas or whatever else it\nwas\nyou could you had to go through it with\nthem i can go through it with them but i\nalso know they can go on google and get\nit i know they can go on these other\nwebsites you watch these youtube videos\nwhatever it is\ni'll give it to them in class and we go\nthrough it but i also want them to get\nreal world application of how these\nconcepts are applied and so they get\nexcited about it\nand i think that's something that was\nmissing a lot from other classes that\ni've seen or i've taken is they go\nstraight into just the technical items\nbut they're not actually taking it up a\n3000 foot level and saying this is why\nit's important\nand i really like\ni always like the inspirational items\nand the quotes and everything else it\nkeeps people in action and i think\nthat's the most important thing yeah no\nabsolutely i love those i love those\ninsights and i think\nacknowledging people i remember the\nfirst time\nfacebook live launched\nthis was probably around\nsix years ago now\nand i was one of the first users this\nwas when i was a senior host and\nproducer at\nso i was in new york city and we had a\npartnership with facebook live so i went\nlive and the first thing i asked was hey\nif if you like anything press the like\nbutton if you love anything press the\nlove button and if you want to share\nsomething with me drop a comment in the\ncomment box and my producer was holding\nher hands over her face going jay i\ncan't believe you just asked the\naudience to do that and it was really\nfunny because the response was amazing\npeople loved acting like what you just\nsaid like people loved\nthat there was a prescribed way\nthat they could respond to something\nyeah so if i shared a quote that was\ninspiring people would click that like\nbutton and then i could see and then i\ncould respond to them and that's when i\nstarted to understand that people don't\njust want to be receivers they want to\nbe participants in learning and they\ndon't just want to be on the receiving\nend they don't just want to be listeners\nand hearers and taking in they want to\nbe involved and they want to be engaged\nand so i love that example of teaching\nlet's say a lot of people who are\nlistening right now may have just\nstarted a business or they're on the\ncusp of starting a business\nhow should they be thinking about the\nfinances of this business they don't\nhave a lot of money to get started\nthey're probably not going to go and\nraise they're probably just trying to\nbuild something through a few friends\nmaybe from themselves what are the\nthings they should be thinking about i\nmean that's a really great question i\ncould just say take my class\ncan they take your class they can't no\nnot not everybody can you're right\nyou're right but um i would not yes yes\nyou want to be able to think\nstrategically right and so you want to\nlook at\nhow much runway do i need to have to\nactually get the business started and a\nlot of this comes back to capital and i\ndon't want to nerd out too much on\nconversations\none of the first things i do with my\nstudents even if i'm having them go\nthrough this is i'll have them build out\na pro forma right so\nwhat is it going to look like how much\nmoney do i need to have for what period\nof time and this doesn't need to be\nsomething fancy you don't need to build\nup a model and put in excel you can\nwrite it on a piece of paper and i think\na lot of people don't look at the basics\neven to start on something like that\nand i'm\nalso all about following your passion\nand getting excited and everything else\nbut you also want to combine that\nwith things that are practical and i\nthink when i have people come to my\noffice hours i get my current students i\nget a lot of people coming to my office\nhours even non-current students and they\nask me the same question you're asking\nand i turn it back on them\nand i say what is your purpose\nwhat is the purpose of what you're\ntrying to achieve\nsome people will tell me\ni want to make money some people will\nsay i want to do this for fun some\npeople will say i just want to have\nexperience there's a lot of different\nreasons of why people are doing things\nand i think it is very important first\nand foremost to be clear with yourself\non why\nyou're starting this business\nnow if it's to start a business for your\nlivelihood we actually have to map this\nout and plan it\nright what is your market size how many\npeople are in there a lot of companies\nthat we're looking at right now are in\nthe beverage space i love the beverage\nspace right it gets me very excited and\nyou want to look at that and see how\nmany people are currently in the market\nwhat are the other products that are out\nthere the beverage space also has a low\nbarrier to entry somebody can take a\nrelatively small amount of money and go\nthere tomorrow to a production facility\nand you can go out there and you can get\nit created\nas opposed to another company that i\nrecently invested in is a sunscreen\ncompany sunscreen companies have\nsome people might say that there's a low\nbarrier to entry for sunscreen having\nsaid that there's a long process to get\na product approved it can take a year\nand a half two years so\npart of it is thinking through and this\nis the the framework that i got from\nbusiness school we have something called\nporter's five forces which is a\nphenomenal tool\nso you look at what are the items that\nare market competitiveness who are the\nother competitors in the space what are\nthe barriers to entry what are the\nalternatives to the product what are the\nsubstitutes\nit's actually a model i had a diagram\nand a whiteboard right now i draw it up\nfor you right\nthinking through things from that model\nthat framework allows you to properly\nassess\nis it even worth it and do i want to go\ninto this business\nand again probably a non-popular opinion\nat this point in time what i'm about to\nsay but everyone always says just go out\nthere and follow your passion follow\nyour dream i get that i do\nbut you also have to look at something\nthat's is this a viable business\nand how much time do you want to spend\non it i'm really happy you said that i\nmean when i started doing what i do\ntoday i was working a full-time job\ngetting home from the full-time job and\nthen editing videos from 9 00 p.m to 2\na.m\nand then waking up going to my full-time\njob coming back and doing the same thing\nand then doing this on the evenings and\nweekends and therefore it didn't need to\nmake money so for two years me doing my\npassion didn't directly relate to money\nit didn't make me revenue i didn't make\nany profit didn't pay my bills because i\nwas paying my bills through a full-time\njob and that to me was the healthiest\nway for me to start because i was able\nto\nsee what the options were and what\nopportunities came up so while i was\ndoing my full-time job paying my bills i\ndidn't have to worry about anything and\nactually using my evenings and weekends\nto build my passion\nled to that being my long-term business\nand i don't think i could have done that\nif i would have quit my full-time job\nand tried to build my passion from\nscratch i think there would have been\nquite a few years where\ni mean i would have been broke because\nthere wasn't a way to monetize what i\nwas doing and so i love that you're\nencouraging people to not think about\ntheir passion\nin this romanticized way yeah because\nit's so easy to get romantic about your\npassion and your purpose and just\nbelieve that because you believe that\neveryone's going to believe and\nsomething's going to happen and i often\nprefer that people either do what you're\nsaying where they actually have a plan\nthey're structured they're thoughtful or\nthey're in two boats for a while yeah\nthey have their job or their part-time\njob and then they have this other thing\nthat's going on and that's a much safer\nplace to be\ni don't believe that every passion can\nbe a business or should be a business\nhow do you help your students or anyone\ndecipher between what should remain a\nhobby and a passion yeah and what can\nhas the market potential to evolve into\na business because i think i think we're\nliving in a time where pretty much a lot\nof random things have become businesses\nso it kind of feels very open but\nthere's things to think about in\nbecoming a ceo or a business person that\nare different to being a passion\nbusiness so the irs when you actually\nhave a business um that over for a\nperiod of time it doesn't create any\nincome but you have expenses against it\nit's literally defined as a hobby a\nhobby is an actual definition of an irs\nterm right so i always find that very\ninteresting and i ask my students\nor any any other entrepreneurs i talk to\neven if i'm talking to them about the\nfund or anything else they'll come to me\nand ask me advice right\nand i say you just have to be clear with\nyourself is this a passion project and a\nhobby or is this something you really\nwant to make money on and i think that\nit's very important to decipher between\nthe two\ni tried to start my own startup before i\nleft banking took a big risk quit my job\nand i tried to start my own startup and\nif i could go back and tell myself\nsomething it would be neha be clear on\nwhat this is can you tell us about that\nstory tell us a bit about that like what\ndid you start how did it go because i\nthink hearing about that would be\nawesome i had a great job in banking i\ngraduated from business school they\nrolled out the red carpet type of job in\nbanking it was amazing so i was working\nwith a lot of companies that were\nlooking to do an ipo or looking to get\nacquired within the next so many years i\nhad the opportunity to spend time with\nfounders cfos ceos when you're a startup\nand you're with a bank that means you're\npretty sophisticated you're far along\nright so i was dealing with a lot of\npeople and i i saw how much they were\nmaking and what they were doing and i\nthought whoa i'm so smart i could do\nthat\nand so i left a great job in banking um\nto start my own startup it was\nironically it was an online platform\nwhich was going to be um to teach\npersonal finance to to predominantly\npredominantly women and then branch out\nfrom that to women and men but i should\nhave been more focused\num i failed at what i wanted to do and\nit was hard how did you define failure\nlike what went wrong there the whole\nthing had to stop any money that i had\nspent we lost i'd gotten money from\nfamilies and friends for about a year\nand a half i'd been working on it we\nlost everything\nand it was very very tough because i had\nso been so used to being successful and\namazing i have immigrant parents who are\nphenomenal who are also very driven\nright and who also have driven their\nchildren to work hard and succeed and\nexcel and so went to school did well\nwent to business school did well went to\nbanking did well and then all of a\nsudden i start my own thing and i'm like\ni don't even know how to properly ship\nboxes\nlike i don't know the difference between\nups\nfedex all of these things like it was a\nreally big learning experience for me on\nbasic items that i didn't understand\nand the startup didn't work right it\nwasn't what i wanted it to be and it was\nvery very hard and if i could go back\nand give myself one piece of advice it\nwould be be able to decipher between\npassion and business\nthey can be both but you have to be\nclear on what you're trying to do and\nachieve\nbecause when it's a business\nyou move out all the noise\nand you focus in on do i have the right\nmarket is there the right market product\nfit are people ready to buy this you\ncan't just go and talk to your friends\nand say hey do you think this idea is\ngreat they're gonna go yeah of course\nthey're gonna tell you yes or no really\nright\nyou need to ask them hey i have this\nproduct it's great okay are you gonna\nbuy it will you pay for it right now\nthat's what makes the difference there\nand so being able to decipher between\npassion and a business i think is is\nvery very important yeah absolutely i\nthink that\none of the misconceptions that i think i\nhad and also people have in general is\nthat\nwhen you live a passion business that\nyou just get to do what you want to do\nand i would honestly say that in the\ncome up period\ni did more of what i didn't want to do\nand what i had to learn i.e whether it\nwas the ups or fedex in in your scenario\nin my scenario it was\nclient relationships editing learning\nvideography learning social media\nlearning i had to learn all these skills\nin order to do what i do today to learn\nabout podcasting i had to learn about\npublishing these were not things i\nwanted to do but they were vehicles to\ndo what i wanted to do so i had to spend\nmore time studying vehicles and\nmodalities and frameworks and\nmechanisms and tools\nso that i could spread my message which\nis what i wanted to do\nbut\nif i just tried to spread my message\nthat was never going to work because i\nhad to understand the tool\ntoday i live a life where yeah i do way\nmore of what i want to do today but i\nthink the mistake is believing that you\nwill\nbe able to let go of what you have to do\nand i think that's where i've realized\nthat there is no one in the world who\ncan completely let go of things they\nhave to do\nin order to do what they want to do but\nit's it's a balance of the two and so\nwhen i'm hearing you talk i'm reflecting\non my own journey and going\nyeah that makes a lot of sense because\nin order to do what i love to do today i\nhave to do things that i just have to do\nyeah\nand to live a pure passion business\nis a hobby\nbecause that means you're just enjoying\nthe passion of it so if i said every\nfriday night i was gonna go live on\nfacebook and just\nteach my message and whoever turned up\nturned up that's a hobby that's\nbeautiful but if i really want to create\nways in which people can learn grow get\neducated change their life transform\nthat's going to need me to be a bit more\norganized and focused yeah as you\nrightly say focus is such a big deal and\ni also think it comes back to\npriorities\nright there are certain times one thing\ni really like that you said is there are\ncertain times right where you're like on\nyour way up right you had to do a lot of\nthe things that you didn't want to do\nand one of the things that i keep\nhearing people always talk about is well\ndo you have the right work-life balance\nthere's a story and i know you've heard\nthis before but there's a person\nstanding in front in the front of the\nroom and they have a glass\nand first they put rocks in the glass\nand they say is there anything else more\nroom left and everybody goes no and then\nthey put the pebbles in then they put\nthe what is it sand and then water right\nhere's what i think is missing from that\nstory though\nis that\nthat all makes sense\nbut there's certain times in life\nwhere you're gonna have situations where\nthat priority level is gonna shift\nand that's what's missing so were there\ncertain times in my life also where the\nrocks would be just career or just work\nor just the things that i don't want to\ndo\nthey were and it wasn't that i didn't\nhave a work life balance\nanything in that way it was more of at\nthat point in time in my life that was\nthe priority\nso even though now\nmy priority is family and i i love my\nwork i love running the fund i love\nteaching you know that though i teach\nfor fun right i love it\nbut the priority set is going to shift\nover time i'm so glad we're having such\na real conversation about this because i\ni'm i'm like loving this right now\nbecause\ni completely agree with you i so when we\ngot married we got married in 2016 which\nis kind of where my external career took\noff and\nfor three years we didn't go on a\nhoneymoon because we couldn't afford it\nlike we didn't go on our honeymoon we\nnever had one because we didn't have the\nmoney or the time to my career was busy\nthings were growing i had momentum on my\nside and i couldn't afford to take the\ntime or the money to pay for something\nthree years later we went on a beautiful\nhoneymoon it was it was amazing it was\nso fun to have waited for something like\nthat and have this amazing experience\nand i look at those first three years\nand i go i'm so happy\nthat we lived the way we did we lived in\nthis 500 square foot apartment in new\nyork city you know we we ate worked and\nslept in the same areas you don't have\nany other space and i have such good\nmemories from that time\nand i'm so grateful that the rocks\nbecame just hard work\nnetworking meetings events whatever it\nwas and my wife was doing the same for\nherself\ni'm so happy that i allowed myself to do\nthat for three years in order to have\nthe life i have today\nand\ni don't think there's a right or wrong\nway and that's what i'm hearing from you\ntoo it's about\nthe hope that you have\nfor the result you want yeah right it's\nlike everything's proportionate to what\nyou want and i don't think that we\nshould have either romantic or\nunromantic views\nof what we want to have in life we\nshould just be clear that if this is\nwhere i want to be\nthis is what it's going to require and\nyeah i just i'm grateful for those\nmemories i'm grateful for those times i\ni look back and i'm so happy that and\neven today i was saying this to a friend\ntoday i was like i still haven't taken\nmy foot off the gas today yeah because\nthe people i look up to and admire and\nrespect\nthey haven't taken the foot off the gas\nafter 30 years of being at the top of\ntheir game\nand i want longevity right i'm not\nlooking for a flash in the pan or i want\nlongevity i want to be doing this for\nthe next three four decades of my life\nwhich requires a different level of\nplanning and maturity as opposed to just\ngoing for quick wins so i'm glad we're\nhaving this conversation because i think\nit's a tough conversation to have yeah\nbut but it is true and again i i want to\ngo back and say to people like it wasn't\nabout not having work-life balance it's\nthat\nthe term work-life balance means\neverything should be equal exactly\nequality\nis the issue because equality doesn't\nactually mean balance for example\ntwo hours of time for myself a day\ncould balance out 10 hours of work that\nday yes i can i see you're not against\nno 100 i was talking to my mom about it\npreviously and she's like you know work\nlife balance just because everybody\nalways talks about that with motherhood\nand this and that you know i have two\nkids right if you literally think of\nbalance it's if you think about like two\nweights on a side you have 50 pounds of\ngold and another person who's 50 pounds\nit's a balance it's equal it's it's\nnever going to in life be that way and i\nthink the challenge that people have is\nthey're calling it balance to begin with\nwhen it should be priorities when i was\nat\ndirect drinks.com\nconsumer wine company\ni probably was working\nyou know 70 80 plus hours a week like i\nremember looking at this and i'm going\non 80 plus hours a week what that means\nis i'm working all day come home have\ndinner and then i work again and you do\nthat six days a week now is that good or\nbad i don't know\nbut at that point in time it was a\npriority in my life i was married my\nhusband travels for work\nas you know and so um he wasn't there\nright he was gone every single week and\nso i loved what i was doing and it was\nexciting to learn more and do things and\nthe more things i would say at work i\ncan take on they'll be like you wanna\nlaunch a new wine project over here go\ndo this you wanna look at how some of\nthese things run for we were doing a\nwine program for martha stewart you can\ndo this right it was it was amazing\nright so i felt like whatever i wanted\nto take on i could\nbut my priority my rocks at that point\nin time in my life was my career yeah a\nlot of people look at priority lists\nthat you have right so you have 10\npriorities of things that i want in a\njob or what i did it was with a guy\nright how you're dating\nand they look at it in a horizontal\nmanner like these are the list of all\nthe things i\nlike to look at in a vertical fashion\nand then you have to\nput in order\nright the priorities and you can quickly\nsee even if it's this is almost like\nplaying with your subconscious right you\nyourself will start to see what are the\npriorities and what's the rank amongst\nthem\nonce you do that then you can say all\nright at this point in time in my life\ni'm going to focus on this and later\nit's going to change later it's going to\nchange you know it's just like buying a\nhouse i have so many friends right now\nwho are in the market it's a crazy\nmarket right yeah it's insane yeah but\neverybody always says we want great\nlocation good price and a lot of space\nwe live in la i mean\ncome on now right yeah yeah and then\nwhat i've noticed is that when they're\nwith their partners they're\nnot on the same page\nand so what i've been telling them what\nmy husband and i did was is we both sat\ndown and we created a vertical list\ni now know what his top priority is and\nhe knows what mine is when we're going\nout and looking for places it's easier\nfor us to be on the same page\nand it sounds like you understand what\ni'm talking about i am completely in\nagreement with you we did the same exact\nthing and and you know ferrari it was a\nbig kitchen like that was very important\nto her because that's her world for me\nit was having a space where we could\nhave a studio like this\nlike those were priorities for me where\nwhere i could work from home because i\nlove working from home for my husband it\nwas being close to the beach oh wow okay\nit has to be close to the she's a total\nbeach person and then for me i needed\nsomething where i can have my own office\nspace yeah that was separate away from\nthe kids\nyeah\nbut but that's beautiful and and i love\nthat idea of people writing down their\npriorities separately and also just\nrecognizing that different stages in\nlife will have different priorities yeah\nand knowing that it can change\nabsolutely and that balance if everyone\ncould remove the idea from their mind\nthat balance\nmeans\nequal because the way we think about\nbalance is time we think dividing our\ntime equally\nmeans balance yeah but that's the wrong\ncurrency to divide\nbalance means how much time do you need\nfor yourself\nin order to feel great so that you can\ngive and build and create for the rest\nof the day that's what balance is yeah\nand i find for me personally that two to\nthree hours a day for myself gives me\nenough energy to go ahead and do that\nsomeone else say may say they need four\nor five someone may need one you know\nit's it's all subjective but\nto me a balance just shouldn't be about\ntime it's it's not about equality of\ntime i mean this is one of the best\nthings that i've heard anybody say\nbecause it's you constantly keep hearing\nthis all the time everywhere everyone\nneeds work-life balance you do need a\nbalance but again it's not equated to\ntime i think it's more on you got to do\nthe priorities\nwhat are my priorities i need to make\nsure i'm getting all those priorities in\nwhatever that might be and in different\nstages of your life that also does\nchange yeah so i i think that's a\nwonderful way to put it this is what i\nlove about you you you know you're a\nwoman you're a business person you're an\nacademic you're now a mom like you know\nand that's why i'm enjoying having this\nconversation with you because i haven't\nhad the challenges you've had i'm i'm\nnot a mum like i don't have to raise\nkids and build businesses and do like\ni'm not in that position right and so i\nhave so much respect for you\nand i have so much admiration for you\nand what what you're able to achieve and\ndo\nbecause i think\nevery time i've seen you also you just\ncarry yourself very well and and at the\nsame time have all this going on at the\nsame time but you love it and you can\ntell that you love being a mom a teacher\nand a coach you love being an investor\nand an entrepreneur\ni\nread a study from 2021\nthat said that and of course let's be\nhonest\nwhat mothers do is priceless and you\ncan't put a value on it if someone asked\nme\nhow much what my mom did for me how much\nwas that worth could never put a price\non it but i do believe it's important to\nunderstand value there was a research\nstudy from 2021 that said that if you\nlooked at\na mom's career as a career and looked at\nover 103 hours a week more like 24 7. if\nyou\ntallied up all the cost of how much\neverything would cost to do or hire or\noutsource it would be 186 400\nthat an average mom would make when you\nhear that\nwhat goes through your mind i wanna i\nwanna hear your response and thoughts\nit's a lot of work and it's a lot of\ntime and i just don't know if society\nalways understands again it comes back\nto the unconscious bias\nright that we feel as women that it's\nour responsibility to take care of the\nhousehold it's our responsibility to do\nall of these different things and the\namount of time and energy that goes in\nit's constant\nand sometimes\nyou might be lucky and get a smile from\nyour child but that doesn't always\nhappen you know i'm going to take this\nin a little bit of a different direction\nhere but i do think that\nwhat makes a lot of these things hard is\nthat in the workplace we don't always\nhave the ability to have others that\nempathize with us\nright and having people around who have\nsimilar fashion like um who understand\nthese things makes a big difference\nmy husband's at deloitte deloitte is\nknown to take care of women they are\nknown to be a great place for for the\nworking mother they have a lot of\npartners that they interact with right\nwho are mothers what that has done for\nme though in my personal life is my\nhusband\ngets it more it's more common to him he\nunderstands that you know when i was\nnursing my baby it was okay how much\nwork is it for nate had to constantly\nhave to nurse throughout the day or take\nthe pump with her to work and the issues\nthat i've had even with pumps and\neverything else one time a startup life\nthe electricity stopped working in our\nbuilding and the pump that i had i\ndidn't realize it was my first child\nthat i should have a battery pack as a\nbackup or something like that and i\nneeded to pump\nso i had to leave and drive home to go\ndo it and it was such an ordeal but\nthese are the things as women that we're\nconstantly having to deal with\nthat not everyone understands and i\nthink that having\nwomen in certain positions at work it\ndoes make a difference\nbecause it shifts the conversation\neven my husband who's amazing and very\nloving\nhe's constantly being exposed to it his\nwork\nso he sees it he hears it and then he'll\nempathize more with his wife\nbut jay to your point it is non-stop it\nis 24 7.\nyou never get a break i think the only\ntime i get a break and i think i'm lucky\nabout this one is when i go to the\nbathroom yeah but otherwise if i'm at\nhome it's non-stop yeah i remember my\nmom doing the same thing like my mom was\nthe main breadwinner of the family she\nuh used to cook for us breakfast lunch\nand dinner pack our lunch send us to\nschool she'd drop me and my sister to\ndifferent schools pick us up like the\nwhole works you know and it was and help\nus with our homework\nand plan weekend activities i mean\nsuperman like just incredible and also i\nagree with what you said so i grew up\nseeing my mom work really hard and so\nthat gave me a sense of empathy and\ncompassion to how hard moms work i have\na younger sister who\nyou know when she gets married i think\nabout the same thing i'm like i can\nunderstand that you know she can't be\nleft to do it all on her own and so\nand and i love what you said about the\nworkplace i worked at accenture again\naccenture has incredible yeah uh\npractices especially in the uk at least\nwhere i work there for moms where women\nwho'd go away and maternity leave when\nthey come back they'd come back to the\nposition they would have earned if they\nstayed at the company yeah so it\nwouldn't be that oh you went off and\nbecame a mum so you're going to start\nwhere you were it's like no we trust\nthat you've continued to grow and evolve\nand now when you come in you're going to\ntake on that role and i loved seeing\nthat because it was why would someone\nget penalized for for going off to do\nhave a child to do the most important\njob in the world how have you allowed\nyourself and i'm really intrigued by\nthis and i'm asking this question on\nbehalf of all my friends people who ask\nme this question i have i always say i\nneed to ask a mum because i'm not\nqualified to answer this question\nhow do you deal with mom guilt in the\nidea that you are an ambitious business\nperson\nwho wants to do creative things who\nloves what they do\nand then you deal with the challenge\nthat but what if i miss that moment with\nmy kid or\nwhat if i'm not a part of that moment of\ntheir growth how have you\ndealt with that because i think that's\nthe hardest thing that i from when i\nspeak to women today who are mums they\njust say to me go jay i miss being able\nto be that person but at the same time i\ndon't want to miss this moment with my\nkid and that is sounds like the hardest\nplace\nit is and you know the way i look at\nthis is\nlife is not about either or\nit's about finding a way to create an\nend\nand it's it is very very hard to make it\nwork jay it is i mean just being\ncomplicated there's no failure\nthere isn't right\nbut\ni when we sold crate and cultivate and\nwe were going through the diligence\nprocess i was pregnant with my daughter\nava\neven now when i look at the uh photos\nthat we have online of you know the\nannouncement of the sale i was 36 weeks\npregnant in the photo\nbut i look at that i go ava's in the\nphoto with me right she's there in the\nannouncement page\nit was really hard right because i\ndidn't take a day off for maternity\nleave i had to work through the\ntransaction and the sale and somebody\ncould look back at that and say that was\nso hard what was going on when we had\nthe closing call it was online on zoom\nfor the sale i was nursing my daughter\nat the time so i had the camera off and\neverybody said hey we can hear ava we\ncan do all this stuff and somebody can\nlook at that and say\nand every mom has their own journey for\nsome people it's good for them not to\nwork and stay at home\nfor me the type of person that i am and\ni don't need to feel bad about it i love\nworking i love being out there and you\nknow what i'm gonna love doing i'm gonna\nlove telling my daughter the story of\nhow she was born and the village and the\narmy of people that stepped in to come\nand help me out so that i could get\nthrough the transaction i felt like i\nhad my baby strapped to my back and i'm\ngoing out there and i'm doing all these\ngreat things and the fact that i was\nable to get and be a part of getting a\ncompany sold that focused on live events\nduring a global pandemic\nwhile pregnant\ni will always have that and i get to\ntell my daughter jay\nwhat i did when i was having her and\nwhat she can be able to go and do in the\nworld\nso what my thought for people is who\nhave mom guilt that they have work and\nthey have personal life and all of these\nthings going on is\nyou have to first take care of yourself\nand then you can take care of the child\nit's the old story right of the airplane\nwhen the air mass come down first you\nput it on yourself and then you put it\non the child and you have to take care\nof yourself first\nand this comes back to self-care mental\nhealth everything else if you don't take\ncare of yourself first\nyou can't be the best mom\nafter my first child i i dealt with\nsevere postpartum and it was very very\nhard\ni went back to work very early i started\na new job this job at creighton\ncultivate\nand i remember thinking i have to push\nthrough this i'm not a good mom i'm not\ngreat if i can't make this work for my\nchild what's wrong with me i thought all\nthese things\ni started working when my son was seven\nweeks old\nwithin two days i stopped crying\ni was crying all the time it's a part of\npostpartum within two days i stopped\ncrying\nand everybody around me would say why\nare you working so soon your baby needs\nyou this that\nand i said i need me when i go to work\nand i can focus on the things i'm great\nat i feel good and i feel confident and\nthen i get to go home and be the best\nmother to my son\nand this is again when i had my first\nchild\nand\ni think that mom guilt again i've used\nthis phrase but it's an unconscious bias\nit's there from other people but it's\nalso there from ourselves\nand every mom has their own journey and\nyou need to do what's right for you and\nyour child\nand there is no wrong\nthere's actually no wrong yeah first you\ngot to take care of yourself the second\nthing for me that worked out very well\nis i created what i call a life team\nyou know and we create these teams at\nwork but you have to create these teams\naround you with your life i have an\namazing supportive husband\ni have phenomenal parents my parents my\nmom is my coach right she talks to me\nevery time i'm driving in the car\nhelping me sort through things she's\nphenomenal right my in-laws are amazing\nthey help with my kids all the time i\ndon't know what i would do without them\ni have some friends who are always there\nyou know you create this great team of\npeople around you\nand what that has allowed me to do is\nis spend the what i think are the\nimportant moments with my kid\nmy both of my kids so right now\nevery friday the second half of friday i\ntake off\nand every other friday i'll take out one\nof my kids just for mommy and me time my\nson's name is in there he's so cute he\ngoes is it mama and in their time\nit's the sweetest thing he's three\nlittle over three right but to me\nthat's more important than hearing a\nword that he said for the first time or\nseeing my daughter do something\ndifferent like she turned over a\ndifferent way she's just over one right\nfor me that time i get to spend with\nthem one-on-one for me that's what's\nimportant\neverybody will have their own though\nthat's important for them i love that i\nthink i think i mean i took so much away\nfrom that but i i think the ultimate\nanswer is that there is no wrong like\nrecognizing that\nhowever you're functioning and dealing\nwith it and as long as there is\ntime i love what you said when you said\ni needed me\nright like i think that's so powerful\nlike i needed me and\nand when we are full we are able to give\nourselves to others it's it's the old\ncliche but it's true\num but hearing that from you is is\nreally powerful now you've been so\ngenerous with your time today and i i\nactually absolutely love everywhere\nwe've gone uh but i do want to talk a\nbit about and and this is the last\nquestion i'm going to ask you before we\ngo to our final five which you're aware\nof because you're a listener so you know\nthat we're going to end with our rapid\nfire round but before that\nuh you launched new money ventures yes\nuh which is your fund you know you're\ninvesting in lots of exciting companies\nand brands\nhow are you deciding\nwhat to invest in what is it that you as\nan investor look at i think that would\nbe really educational for our audience\nwho potentially may want to have\ninvestors one day and and raise one day\nwhat are the things you look for there's\ntwo big things i look for one is the\nmarket opportunity\nright so what can this actually grow\ninto and then number two is the founder\nwe're investing in early stage so for us\nthat's gonna be seed in series a\ncompanies i know\nthat things are gonna change no matter\nwhat there's gonna be ups there's gonna\nbe downs with a lot of these startups we\nwant to be able to invest in the right\npeople who can pivot along with those\nchanges\nand those are the two big things of how\nwe look at which companies we're going\nto invest in amazing very clear it's\nvery clear very concise yes very clear\nvery simple i love it all right so we're\ngoing to end with our final five\nuh so neha come on\noh of course i was gonna say i have to\ntell you too i've been listening to this\npodcast i listen to it all the time on\nthe drive to class i love it so tuesdays\nand thursdays right now i

much so now you\ncan pull a quote from your own podcast\nnow when you listen to it on the way so\nsomething you said okay so ner kumar\nthese are your final five uh the first\nquestion is what is the best advice\naround money you've ever received my dad\nwould always tell me this and he'd say\nwhen you have money\neverybody wants to give it to you when\nyou don't have money nobody wants to\ngive it to you\nand the reason that's something to be\nvery cognizant about\nis about how you manage your finances\nfrom a personal side but also from a\nwork side\nlove that great great answer never had\nthat before all right second question\nwhat is the worst money or finance\nadvice you've ever heard you know\nthere's a lot of people who get up on\npanels and things and they'll say just\ngo out there and get the money just go\nout there and raise it\nand there's there's a lot of fluff\nbehind that you need to be able to\nsupport it you need to be able to show\nthat you can that you have the right\nbusiness behind it and the last thing\nthat you want to do is\ni mean i hear all these advices of you\nknow drain your 401k go out there if you\nbelieve in what you're doing i'm all\nabout faith i i left my job\nright i did all of these things but you\ndo need to be able to have some support\nbefore you you completely drain out your\n401k and you need to make sure that\nyou're financially doing the right thing\nfor your business that's great love that\nquestion number three\nhow would you define your current\npurpose\nto leave the world in a better place\nthan i found it i love that\nit's beautiful\nquestion number four\nif someone has just failed what would be\nyour best advice to them right now get\nup and start again right away don't even\nthink about it brilliant i love that\nthat was very quick very quick you're\nreally rapid this is good all right\nfifth and final question we asked is to\nevery guest uh if you could create one\nlaw in the world that everyone had to\nfollow what would it be\ndon't judge other people\ni love that\ni think we're all so quick especially in\nthis in the media world today\nwe're so quick to judge everybody around\nus\nand i think that if we were to take a\nstep back and know that everybody has\nsomething that they're coming from\nand just not to judge them\nand not already have our own listening\nof what we're when they're talking what\nwe're we're listening to and not judge\nbut create a space for them to say or do\nwhatever they want\ni think that'll be amazing everyone\nthat's neha kamaran everyone you need
