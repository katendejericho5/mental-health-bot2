    "transcript": "you're never going to be the same person\nyou were a year ago and if we're not\nwatching each other grow you can lose\nthis like spark we change so much and so\nyou're kind of falling in love with a\ndifferent person regularly if you're\npaying attention then this is one of\nyour talking points that you want us to\ntalk about was our red table talk\nexperience yeah so i'm getting ready i'm\ntrying to figure out what i'm going to\nwear oh yeah and and what's going on\nand then\nshall i tell this one yeah okay and then\nradhi says\nshe's like so so what should i wear\nright very good question normal question\ni think i was cooking yeah i was cooking\ni was like making something and then i\nwas running really really late and i was\nlike to you oh like what should i wear\nlike you know what should i wear what\nshould i wear right now and uh\nyou're like it doesn't matter because\nyou're not gonna be on camera like just\nwear anything that you want just be\ncomfortable wherever you want\nso i had like five seconds to get ready\nso i threw on like a t-shirt and jeans\num and then you tell the rest\nand so no no but she skipped a detail\nshe's being nice to me i i literally\nsaid to her i was like\ni was just like wearing anything like it\ndoesn't matter what you wear you're not\neven going to be on camera yeah right\nlike that's what i said to her because\nit was meant to be an interview with me\nand it was one of those moments that you\nlive to regret as a husband and a\npartner because i was literally like\nyeah it doesn't matter what you were\nlike where anything you feel comfortable\nin you're not even gonna be on camera\nnext thing you know we get out of the\ncar when we get there we're both on\ncamera from the moment we get out yeah\nuh jada turns up to greet us and welcome\nus and just you know makes us feel so\ncomfortable and welcomed and happy and\nshe's sitting with both of us and\nliterally after five minutes her and her\nteam are like we think rather should be\non the episode as well and and the only\nthing i can think of is why did i say\nthat why don't\nwhy did i say that and and then they're\nlike riley would you feel comfortable\ndoing it how did that feel for you as\nlike you know a few months before you'd\nbeen on my podcast with me and that was\na big step out of your comfort zone\nliterally i think it was like two months\nlater on this or maybe three months\nlater but how did that feel for you\num well when she asked me there was\nalready cameras around us so i was like\ni can't really say no um and i think i\nwas just scared because i also you know\nwhen you need to mentally prepare for\nsomething\nand i take i feel like i take a lot to\nmentally prepare for things that i'm\ndoing or like going on um and so\nyeah as soon as she asked me i literally\njust felt like my whole body go into\nimmense anxiety and um and i can't\nremember i think i said no\nokay\nwithin like the space of two seconds um\nbut it was such a good experience\nbecause it really pushed me to do stuff\nthat i would have never ever like if\nthey had asked me separately i would\nhave probably said no like if i had\nasked me beforehand and i had even time\nto think about it i would have probably\nsaid no just because of my anxiety about\nit\nbut um it was so nice to be kind of\npushed and like completely shoved out of\nmy comfort zone uh because then when i\nwatch it back i was like god i didn't\neven don't even like i have no\nrecollection of that moment that i was\non there i don't know what i was saying\ni feel like i wasn't even very present\nat that time because i was so nervous\nbut it really taught me like afterwards\nand i was looking back i was like it's\nactually really so nice to be able to\nshare things that you've learned and um\nbe part of something so special and so\nyeah it was it was a really good\nexperience for me yeah scary but good\nand there was the part where\nso i went on first and we've been having\na conversation for about an hour and\nthen they bring riley to the table and\nthat's when you were like i could see\nyou behind yeah scenes and tell us a bit\ni was like pacing back and forth i think\ni've never been so like my whole hands\nwere like so sweaty i was like so i i\njust i can't even describe it i don't\nthink i've been that anxious or nervous\nfor a very long time um and then as soon\nas they said it's time for you to go on\ni just had to completely drop\nsmile and like walk on as if i was\ncompletely okay\nso um but no it was it was again like\nsuch a great experience and they they\nmake it so easy because they make it so\nyou make they make you feel so\ncomfortable when you're sitting with\nthem so\nyeah it was great so\nwhat we're gonna do as i said before is\nwe're gonna go through these topics so\nthat was one of the themes and topics\nthat people wanted to hear about here\nare a few more that i want to\ncheck out that we want to dive into\nlet's start with this one so this one\nwas after the honeymoon phase ends how\ndo you keep your attraction level high\nfor each other and your relationship\nmoving forward oh it's a good question\nyeah when does honeymoon period end like\nwhat do people say that normally is\ni don't know i guess for most people\nit's like six months a year\ninto marriage or into a relationship\ni think into a relationship but i think\nit also can happen in marriage too i\nguess because\ni guess like i think when you're getting\nmarried like it's such a fun moment\nright yeah it's like so we know dating\nwe know that in dating six to twelve\nmonths but then when you get married\nit's like you have all your family and\nyou have all these events and then you\nhave this big high and then you get\nmarried and obviously for us after we\ngot married we moved in together and\neverything else that came from that so i\nguess let's talk about marriage because\ni guess that's what we're\nthat's that's more recent for us i feel\nlike for us we had to make a really\nconscious effort to go above and beyond\nfor the other person and really\nunderstand how the other person likes to\nhave fun and how the other person really\nlikes to\num\nexpress their emotions so then we try\nand facilitate our\ntime together in a way that it allows us\nto both do that i remember\nwe went to a football match at soccer\nmatch yeah it was in the u.s it was at\nla galaxy stadium and we left at time\nlike that\nthat's all right he could do which is\nnow good because now you go with people\nwho enjoy that with you yeah and i think\nthat's part of it like i actually like\ngoing to watch football or basketball\neverybody likes basketball i love that\nyou're not going to watch basketball\ntogether but if if i'm going to watch\nfootball it's like i also want to watch\nit with someone who's going to get into\nit with me and get excited and be\nmotivated and so i don't feel like oh\nshe doesn't want to go with me so then\nshe doesn't care about what i care about\nbecause\nit's the same way as i wouldn't want to\ngo to something particularly that maybe\ni'm not interested in whatever that is\neven though i seem to go with you to get\npedicures and\nmanicures but he loves that\nhe loves a good foot massage loves a\ngood pedicure\num love you you like getting groomed we\nboth love spa yeah that works well\nuh but we we found that we liked doing\nexperiences together and she's referring\nwe went to this is more my kind of\nexperience but this last christmas we\nwent to disney world oh yeah\nand\ni've been wanting to go to disney world\nfor like ages i haven't really looked\nhe's a big kid like he absolutely i\nthink for three four i can't remember\nhow many months before six months yeah\nprobably like six months he's been so\nexcited to go to disneyland and to\nuniversal um and every single week he\nwould probably mention it about his\nexcitement for it and uh and i think\njust through your excitement i got\nexcited about it\num so we end up at disney world in\norlando and universal\nand\nit was just i was epic like it was\namazing i loved it it was so good like\nespecially at christmas yeah what i love\nabout it is the experience that those\nplaces create and a feeling and because\ni'm a creator and a content creator and\ni'm always like how can i create\nexperiences that make people feel\ncertain things and make people\nyou know just how do you create\nsomething that makes people feel\nsomething and makes them feel excited\nand makes them feel passion and all of\nthat and i feel like they do it with\nsuch ease\nand\nriley actually felt unwell just before\nwe went and when we got there and she\nsoldiered through like she was the\nsweetest person ever because i knew that\na it was more for me than it was for her\nbut she does get into it too and second\nof all she she felt unwell and she got\npretty unwell at that time but she sold\nit through and she was just you've been\nwaiting for this for six months and\nimagine i was like i'm just gonna stay\nhere and i'm gonna watch a film and just\nget a bit better no there was like i\ncould not do that to him you could have\ni could have i didn't want to yeah i\nknew actually i really appreciated it\nyeah i pushed through that so what do\nyou think would how do we do that except\nhow do we keep excitement\nlike through it after honeymoon period i\nthink experiences are the biggest yeah\nlike really prioritizing experiences\nwe're not just like oh we'll find you\nknow i don't think you can\nmake\nattraction or chemistry or compatibility\ni don't think you can take any of that\nfor granted i think that's a big one\nuh\nyou know for men get your hair cut\nregularly you know get your beard\ntrimmed\nhe really really believes that he's got\na new hair i don't know whether you guys\nhave noticed but um he's changed his\nhairstyle and he genuinely thinks that\nhis hairstyle has changed the way that i\nlook at him\nit works guys if you the men's groom\njason you are the man\ni love you\nyou're amazing you tell the story way\ntoo much it's a good story i know you\nlove it it's the truth uh but but no i i\nmean okay let's get to so the\nexperiences are a big one i think\ngetting to know each other more and more\nas months ago and how we're changing as\nwell i think that makes a difference\nbecause you're never going to be the\nsame person you were a year ago and if\nwe're not watching each other grow and\nwatching each other\nlike mold into different people and\nobserving that then actually that can\nalso be something that can you can lose\nthis like spark because\nactually we changed so much and so\nyou're kind of falling in love with a\ndifferent person regularly if you're\npaying attention um which i think that's\nthat's quite cool yeah and i think\nthat's a really good point actually that\nyou've got to be open to the fact that\nthe person's becoming different yeah and\nyou've got to want to be able to fall in\nlove with a new person rather than\ntrying to keep them the same exactly\nrather than being like oh wait a minute\nyou weren't like this when i married you\nyou were like this or\nyou know you were less like this when i\nmarried you and now you've changed or\nall of that kind of language that often\ncomes in relationships like i feel like\nwe are actually very different people\nright like we're very different people\nlike i think\nyou really ground me you send to me\nyou remind me of what's really important\nyou\nare more energetic than me\nin different ways yeah and and just like\ni feel like\nwe're actually very different and people\nwill be like well how do you but we have\nthe same deeper values like our\nspiritual values are the same\nbut also not just our spiritual values\ni feel like we both are able i i thought\nthis is it i feel like we're both able\nto\nlove each other for who we are\nrather than who we want the other person\nto become for us yeah for sure and i\nthink we\nwe've kind of had that from the\nbeginning or at least for most of our\nrelationship we established that and i\nthink it was good because we did those\nlike those rules of things that we knew\nwe didn't want to change about ourselves\nor that we really felt were important to\neach other um\nbut yeah no i agree i think i think\nthat's a really good point okay let's\ntake the next one the next one is when\nyour partner is fully committed to a\npriority or project and you're feeling\nunseen how do you help yourself oh\nwhat's that phone where they go i see\nyou\ni don't know anybody know\nisn't it it's like can we just do that\nno no it's like a couple thing where\nthey're like i see you which means like\nyou know i love you okay\nif you know then comment below and tell\nus um\ni feel like you're really really good at\nbalancing like\nhe has a really really crazy schedule\nlike i don't think i've seen anybody\nwith a crazier schedule than than him\nand the way that he's able to\nreally balance his work\nbut then still always prioritize me like\ni never feel like i'm not a priority and\ni think it's um i mean i don't know\nwhether we spoke about this in the last\none about quant we did it didn't we\nabout quality over quantity um but he\nreally lives that and he's like that\nwith everybody around him and so like\nyou get a good\nhe's so focused so attentive um so even\nin the time that we do spend together\neven if he has a crazy like week two\nweeks a month or if i do\num then the time that we are actually\nable to spend together you're so\nattentive and focused and actually if i\never need you or anything needs to like\ni need you to do anything for me or if\nsomething's urgent for me or if you just\nfeel that my emotions are even changing\nor i'm feeling like a little bit sad or\nanything like you always are there\nattentive to pick up on it and you\nalways change everything around to just\nbe there for me in those times and so i\nfeel like\ni can't really say that i feel like i've\nbeen unseen by you i think we've learned\nhow to pick up on each other's emotions\nand know when to show up for the other\nperson which i feel like maybe we didn't\nhave at the beginning of our marriage\nbut i think that we've really learned to\nunderstand that from one another and\nit's and it's definitely changed the way\nthat we\nfeel loved by one another\ni just miss her every day like this year\nshe was in london for like yeah a long\ntime yeah a month she was with her\nfamily she was with\nthe restaurant she's been working on\nyeah and she was gone like we didn't\nspend time together i think\nover a period of i'd probably say like\nthey're like six weeks we didn't\nactually probably see each other yeah\nprobably we weren't not\nthey were probably like six weeks that\nwe didn't see each other we weren't in\nthe same country for a lot of that i was\nin l.a and she was in london and on top\nof that\nwe weren't talking all the time but with\nraleigh she's really good at\nsending me voice notes which are\nhilarious sending me funny selfies which\ni absolutely love like getting just\npulling like the funniest faces ever\nand then her trying to call me as much\nas she can and that's how i i am i'm the\nsame way like i don't feel like\nwe've set rules about when we are apart\nwe just get on with stuff so like the\nway i deal with it if she's busy with\nthe project is\ni book out my whole schedule whether\nthat's spending time with myself which i\nreally enjoy and and i think that's a\nreally important one that when i know\nshe's busy and she's really focused and\nshe can't like be on a phone call all\nthe time or talking and a time\ndifference for me it's like that's my\ntime alone like that's an opportunity\nfor me to\nreally invest in my relationship with\nmyself\nand how i feel and what i'm doing for\nmyself so this year i started playing\nmore tennis i started prioritizing my\nexercise i started spending more time at\nthe gym like i was just thinking about\nlike what can i do\nto invest in myself during this time i\nwas spending more time with friends i\nwas catching up with people i haven't\nseen in a long time and it's not that\nshe's not available for a phone call or\nto talk to a message it's not that it's\njust hey here's my time to spend a bit\nof quality time with myself\nand i think that's such an important\nthing and i know you do as well when i'm\ntraveling for work and stuff and i think\nwe've both built that independence up\nand at the same time then i was just so\nexcited to see her i couldn't wait for\nthe day she was coming back and i\nremember that hug that we had when you\nthe day you came back yeah it was just\nlike i was so happy to have you back\nand so i actually love that feeling of\nmissing her\nand i also love that feeling of having\ntime to really invest in my relationship\nwith myself\nand how about when you like have you\never felt a time when you felt unseen by\nme\nno\ni think we talked about that last year\nlike when they were but not not in the\npast 12 months yeah i think we've really\nlearned to detect when each other needs\nyeah i think last year we talked about a\nlot of the times when we've made that\nmistake but i think in the last 12\nmonths now yeah all right let's do the\nnext one okay so\nwhat would you say annoys you the most\nabout your partner\ni'm gonna go first because it's easy\nokay come on okay so for me\nit is my chargers and my tech oh my gosh\nlike look so\nokay so\ni have\ncharges\ni know go on carry on i have charges\nplaced in every key location in the home\ni have one by my bed i've won at my\nstudy i have one\nin the corner of where the tv is like i\njust have charges everywhere because i\nuse my phone a lot i'm in lots of\ndifferent locations i have one in the\ncar and so i like to be able to charge\nit i don't like being moving around so\nthen charges stay where they are\noften i will find\ncharges have moved locations charges are\nno longer in those locations my mom's\ngoing to get well happy with this\nbecause i do this to her when i go home\nas well and she says the same thing to\nme yeah charge is missing so what i\ndecide to do because because the worst\nthing is when i noticed this and i'm\nlike rather that's my charger she's like\nno it's not\nshe's like no i i bought this like i'm\nlike no that is my charger and she was\nlike no no just to be clear iphone\nchargers all look the same so so i went\na step further and got a different\ncolored cable because i was like this is\nit right like i've got this bright pink\ncable like there's no chance that she\nbought the same price i thought you\nbought it for me no yeah exactly and\nthen that happens with that too so that\nis probably the most annoying thing i do\nsee the annoyance come out fiercely when\nhe can't find the charger last night\nyeah last night i was sleeping and he\nwas like buddy where's my charger\ni was like it's in my bag why is it in\nyour bag\nyeah okay so that's probably my number\none thing i think i'm trying to think of\nother stuff but that's definitely what's\nthe thing that annoys me about you hmm\noh i know well i don't know whether this\nis actually a thing that yeah you talked\nabout my shoes last time no i'm not\ntalking about shoes um\nthe one thing that annoys me is that oh\nbecause he has this really annoying\nphotographic\nweird memory where he can actually\nremember every single thing and so even\nif i'm right and even if i know i did\nsomething because i know he's got this\nmemory i then question myself\nbecause like i know for a fact like\nsomething has happened and i say that to\nhim or i know i've told him something\nbut because i know how good his memory\nand how like weird his brain is\ni then question myself because i'm like\nhe does have that like he does know how\nto remember every single thing that\nsomeone possibly says\nso then i question my my memory\nabilities because of your\nlike genius brain that's not nice yeah\nthat's this bit anyway five almonds a\nday guys my mom trained me five almonds\na day apparently a ayurvedic remedy\nisn't it no\nbut almonds do you have that quality\nyeah really yeah they're meant to be\ngood for brain power what else is what\nare the nuts good for brain well nuts\nthat's why they're shaped like a brain\ndid you know that yeah one that you take\noh yeah um\noh nuts really nuts and seeds they have\nreally good um\ngood um ingredients that are meant to be\ngood for brain power okay yeah all right\nnext question is\nwhat's something your partner has said\nto you that really hurt you but served\nas a valuable lesson\num oh i know what mine is you always\ntell me that i don't know how to like\nutilize my time well which didn't hurt\nwhich no into in like in like in a good\nway though in terms of like i've never\nsaid that no you do as in not not in a\nbad way but you always say that i need\nto learn how to you know use my time in\na way that's efficient because i know i\ndon't like i'm a big procrastinator it's\nnever come like in a rude way for me\nit's when i've been talking about what\ni'm struggling with um whether it's to\ndo with things that i want to get done\nor\num how i feel like time just gets away\nfrom me through and a whole day goes by\nand i feel like i've hardly got anything\ndone and\ni have this really bad habit of just\neither procrastinating or not knowing\nhow to prioritize things and so i'll end\nup having a list of to do and i'll end\nup doing everything that's completely\nnot on my list like\nreorganizing a kitchen cupboard instead\nof what's actually on my list of things\nto do so you get you you talk about this\na lot it wasn't just that line but when\nyou tell me that about myself i know\nit's definitely true because it hits\nhome\nso no i don't think we don't really i\nfeel like we don't often\nwe have never been in a situation where\nwe don't feel to what we say to each\nother like even if we're really upset\nwith one another or even if we're angry\nor whatever it is i don't feel like we\nburst out like words that we don't mean\num\nyeah i don't think i don't think we've\never really done that i don't think\nwe've been so harsh with our words in in\narguments or when we felt upset with one\nanother yeah i just feel like with that\ntype of stuff you have to be careful\nabout that with your partner because\nyou've got to look at this person like\nevery night before you go to bed\nyou have to\nsee them every morning when you wake up\nand if you say stuff you don't mean\ntoo\noften either it becomes real\nor\nthat person feels like just like a joke\nhas an element of truth\neven if you say something you don't mean\nthat's extreme there's still an element\nof truth and now that person has that\nwith them yeah and i know one thing that\ni used to say that i stopped saying in\nour relationship was for a long time i\nused to say things like\noh you know like we don't i don't really\ni can live without you if i needed to oh\nyeah and i used to see that as a sign of\nstrength to say that\nand that came from me just being\ndetached and you know being independent\nbut then i started to see like that type\nof language in a relationship but i\nnever said it in a mean way or a extreme\nway but just that statement what those\nwords actually mean you end up pushing\nyour partner away\nand so you've got to be so careful with\nyour words that you say to your partner\nbecause if you're saying something just\nto get a reaction out of them or you're\nsaying something to it's like being 16\nagain you know like when you would when\nyou say something to your friend just to\nget a reaction out of there yeah yeah\nbut it's like you can't live like that\nwith your partner because you're just\nwith them so much of the day yeah that\nyou're gonna be so\nintentional and focused on how you speak\nto people so\nyeah\nuh what's the one that you so what's my\nthing what would you what some of your\npartner said to you that really hurt you\nbut served as a valuable lesson i don't\nthink you've ever said anything hurtful\nto me but what about when i said i\ndidn't like your hair\nthere are okay yeah i mean there are\ntimes when like i've worked really hard\non something\nlike oh yeah yeah this is it this is it\ni've worked really hard on something\nlike a video\nor i've been on a photo shoot\nor oh yeah we have a lot of podcast logo\nor whatever i've worked really hard on\nsomething\nand i'll show rightly to get her\nfeedback\nand radhi is just so honest\nlike she is just honest like she does\nnot hold back like she would just say it\nas it is\nand in the beginning and even there are\nsome times now where like my ego gets\nhurt or when my emotions get hurt but\nthen i'm like actually i'm so lucky that\ni have someone who's so honest and\nthat's become a valuable lesson for me\nbecause\nif she wasn't like that and she just\nsaid yes yes yes to everything i did\nthen i would never know whether if i was\ndoing something was good or not whereas\ni know now if i show her a video\nand she's like i don't like that i don't\nlike that i don't like that then i'm\nlike oh at least she cares to be honest\nwith me rather than just be like oh yeah\nthat's the best video i've ever seen and\nthen we put it up and then no one likes\nit and so for me like i've learned to\nvalue her honesty and she's just raw\nsometimes like she was straight would be\nlike that's terrible right but it's it's\nin a loving way because it's out of care\nultimately in terms of getting the right\nthing so for me i've take i think that's\nthe one that's the one that is for me so\ni actually value rather being honest\nwith me\nas opposed to\neither lying to me or just saying yes\nfor the sake of it or just to make me\nfeel better so that's mine okay fair\nyeah i agree\nall right okay so\nhere we go what's the next one okay how\ndo you decide what you guys show to the\npublic and what you keep private\ngood question\nwe've i've been talking to you about\nthis a lot haven't i um\ni find i get asked a lot why i don't\nshare like so much of mine and jay's\nrelationship on my page um whether it's\nlike pictures or whatever it is and\ni find\nlike you're so sweet and you're so\nexpressive on your page and i feel\nyou're like that whether it's with me or\nwhether it's with your friends or like\nwhoever comes on your podcast like you\ngenuinely want to show appreciation and\nlove on your page and i think that's\nsuch a wonderful thing but i think it's\nreally good for people to know that\nthere can be different types of people\nin relationships and so that is him and\nthat's how he likes to express himself\nalong with being so expressive in person\nthat's how he is whereas for me i just\num\ni don't know there's a part of me that\njust likes keeping that to ourselves but\nalso i find generally and especially for\nwomen a lot of um like post online of of\npeople who look very very happy together\nand you know that have\num a lot of relationship posts it can\nactually agitate a lot of people who are\nfeeling quite sad about that area of\ntheir life and unfortunately that is\nreally prominent in society at the\nmoment like a lot of people are really\nupset in their relationships or\nnot dating and finding it really\ndifficult and so um i often try and just\navoid posting things that i think might\njust agitate people in that way\nespecially because love is the one thing\nthat people are searching for so much\nand so i do post things and i do post\nfun stuff with us but\ni like to leave some of the stuff for\njust us to\nfor me to be able to say to you\nprivately and\nyeah not online\nyeah that's just yeah that's just how i\nfeel and i feel it's sometimes i've\nactually felt like oh maybe i should\nlike write a really sweet post online\nand you know say to him and i'm like oh\nbut maybe i just want to write in his\ncard and then i write it all out\nand then i just delete it and i write\nwhat i actually feel like writing which\nis something just sweet light and like\njust relaxed rather than you know having\nthat emotional outpour online which i\nfind a bit difficult to do so\nyeah yeah and i think that's okay like\nit's okay to be both people and i think\nthere's a beauty in what how you are\nonline and how you express yourself but\ni feel like i just want to protect that\npart of me a little bit and not have\nthat have that so much out there yeah\nand i and i think for me it's\ni'm always thinking about like what can\ni share with you that's going to be\nuseful to you so if you're listening or\nwatching right now i want to make sure\nthat anything i'm sharing in our\nrelationship is actually helpful to you\nis useful to you is real for you as well\nlike why are we doing this conversation\nbecause we get to talk about what goes\nwrong what we don't like about each\nother what what doesn't work or not what\nwe don't like about each other but what\nannoys each other you know all of the\nthings that we're talking about already\nright now to me i want you to see that\ni i want you to hear that because i want\nyou to hear that people can be different\npeople can have different opinions\nthey can have different priorities but\nthey can still love each other and they\ncan still be together and so for me\nsometimes the reason why i share those\nmessages is just because i'm like this\nmay be relevant to someone out there and\nthat's why we did last year's podcast\nthat's why we're doing this one because\ni'm hoping when you hear it you'll be\nlike oh wait a minute that's me and my\nboyfriend girlfriend partner whatever it\nis like that's me my friend like i want\nyou to hear that and recognize that you\ncan work through this stuff that with\nwork with effort you can actually get\nthere so yeah that's how i decide what\ni'm gonna share okay next one uh have\nyou ever felt pressurized by your\npartner in any way\num\ni have i have to be honest and say no\nwith this one in the sense that i feel\nlike you've been really great at\ncoaching me through my growth in areas\nthat you're more\nadvanced so when it comes to\nhealth\nradhi\nis far more health-conscious in what she\neats and her exercise routine and it's\nit's it's beautiful for her wellness and\nhow she sees wellness as this wholesome\nthing and she's been that way since\nwe've been together\nand i have always focused on my mental\nhealth but not as much of my physical\nhealth\nand i've never felt forced by radhi or\npressurized by her\nto become someone i'm not when it comes\nto my physical health i've always felt\ncoached and guided by her so i remember\nwhen we first moved to la she was the\none like\nlooking for a personal trainer for me\nbecause she was like i know that you\nknow i told her that that was the only\nway i would be able to get into that\nrhythm and so she was doing that\nresearch for me and then when it comes\nto my food she's always making sure that\nwhatever she cooks is right and even\nthough she loves spicy food because\nspicy food's not good for me she makes\nsure that the food she cooks for both of\nus is not spicy and so i've always felt\nlike very encouraged and now that i'm at\nlike feeling like the best i've felt\never\nit's like i feel so happy about that\nbecause i i feel like i did it in my own\ntime\ni did it for myself\nand\ni\nhave a practice and ways of doing it\nthat are right for me\nand often when things are pressurized\nit's very much like well this is how i\ndo it this is how you should do it and\nthis is what you need to do whereas for\nme it's like i'm doing it for myself i\nfound my way of doing it and i did it in\nmy time and to me having someone\nespecially a partner who wants you to be\nhealthy but not doing in a way that\nmakes you feel bad about yourself like\ni yeah at one point i was probably\neating too much sugar or eating too much\nchocolate whatever it was and\nrather never made me feel bad about it\nbut she would educate me as to why it\ncould be better and i feel like being\neducated in that way\nis is a much smarter way of helping your\npartner actually grow\ndid you know that that granola you're\neating is the same as\nthat is literally\nthe same amount of sugar in this as this\nand you'll be like oh my gosh i had no\nidea yeah it's so much about education\num\ni think with pressure actually one thing\nthat i thought of when i had that\nquestion was i also don't feel like\nyou've ever pressured me and one of the\nmain things for me was when we actually\nmet you just you know you were recently\na monk before that and so\nin my eyes i was like oh my gosh and i\nwas just kind of starting my meditation\npractice at that time\nand\nso for me it was\nyeah i always thought oh my gosh am i\nlike gonna feel really really pressured\nby the\nby the knowledge that he has and by the\nway that his meditation practice must be\nso deep and powerful and\nall of that you know i thought i would\nfeel that way but actually you were just\nsuch a wonderful guide and teacher in\nallowing me to explore myself because\njust like you said i don't feel like\nanybody will want any nobody is gonna\nfeel happy about doing something that\nthey're pressured into and also just the\nconviction with which someone wants to\ndo something if it's done out of\npressure actually it's not going to be\nthat much and so they're not going to\nwant to stick to it anyway um and so\nyeah i felt like that was such a\nbeautiful journey that i went through by\nobserving how you were in your\nday-to-day life and then how your\nmeditation practice and how your\nspiritual journey is what took you to\nbecome that person and so for me that\nwas the greatest motivation for me to\ncontinue my journey in it um without you\nsaying anything or making me feel a\ncertain way about it um and again the\nother thing i think of is how\num yeah anything that i wanted to do or\ni've said i wanted to do you've always\ngiven me advice on it and always giving\nme the best advice that i could have\nasked for but yeah you've never forced\nme to do the things that you've told me\nthat i should be doing like if you've\ngiven me advice yeah you're not\nregimental about it like you've given me\nadvice on so many different things and a\nlot of the times i haven't taken the\nadvice or i've heard it but i haven't\nbeen able to\nput it into practice but you just really\nallow me to find that journey myself and\nyou're always there to support me which\nis what i think a partner should be like\nin that way but you don't yeah you don't\nget annoyed if i don't do it and you\ndon't pressure me into doing it if if\ni'm not ready for it so\nyes no i don't feel pressured by you\nexcept for when um you don't want to eat\nsugar and i want to eat like chocolate\ncreak and ice cream and you're like i'm\nnot eating sugar right now\nthen i feel sad\nand a little bit pressured to also have\nto not have sugar\nwhich started from you know aside from\nme\ni like having sugar sometimes\nhe's like all or nothing so that's\nanother thing like yeah about our\ncharacters which are so different i can\nhave a small bit of like chocolate every\nday or like a small amount of something\nevery day and i will be fine i will\nnever have to finish it i can just have\na smaller one be very happy he if we're\nhaving sugar it'll be like we go to the\nice cream place coca bella creamery the\nbest vegan ice cream place ever so we'll\ngo there\nand he'll be like okay could i please\nhave a chocolate fudge ice cream with\ntriple or quadruple chocolate sauce\ntriple chocolate chips triple sprinkles\nthere's a good um a chocolate brownie\nthat's heated up and basically he goes\nhe has the same amount of sugar for like\na month that he should in like one day\nuh well remembered of my order i know\nthat's exactly what i ordered we went\nthere the other day and they were like\noh you've got 600 points\nwhich he got all while i was away\ni've saved them i'm saving them one day\ni want to walk in there and use all my\npoints like feed everyone\num but yeah no so he's all or nothing\nwhereas i feel like i'm quite like i i\nwill have a little often um but you're\nreally good like when he says no to\nhaving something\nwe will go anywhere and there'll be like\nthe most incredible stuff around us to\neat and you'll just be like no i'll have\nfruit i'm like fine don't share my cake\nwith me\nand i think we've also felt it with like\nambition yeah\nlike i feel like i've always been really\ndriven like since\nsince i remember in my teenage years\ni've always been really driven i've\nalways been\nreally\nfocused and motivated and inspired and\ni've always been ambitious and chasing\nmy dreams whatever they may be\nand\nwhen we met i was very clear about that\nas well that's who i was but i feel like\ni've i work\ni work harder on my purpose now than i\never have yeah so in one sense i've\nchanged a lot since we met because when\nwe met i still wasn't working as hard as\ni am now on my purpose\nbut i've never felt the pressure to slow\ndown\nfrom you or i've never felt the pressure\nto have to detach from those dreams or\ndisconnect from those dreams and i think\nthat really helps me because\ni'm not worried about\nfeeling like i'm letting her down\nbecause she doesn't let me she doesn't\nmake me feel that way because she\ndoesn't feel that way i feel like i\nthink i've been asked this before\nbecause of the speed that you work at\nand like how\nfocused you are whether that makes me\nfeel like pressured into being that way\nand i actually like i feel like that we\nthat never really happens i feel like i\nwatch you do it and i'm so amazed by it\nand in awe of it but um i feel like i\nstill work at the same speed i'm just\nlike just chilling along um doing things\nat my own pace but i think that also\nshows that like i never feel you're\nputting that on to me it's always just\nyou doing you and i get to do me at the\nsame time but we can just kind of work\non parallel\nyeah which is quite nice okay awesome\nlet's do the next\nsubject that's over here\nthe next one is\ngive us a fun one uh what can only your\npartner do that really makes you feel\nloved and special\ni mean that's more you rather than fun\num\nwhat do you do that makes me feel really\nspecial yeah loved and special\nloved and special\nshould i say what you say to me\noh yeah\nso basically i don't know i don't know\nwhere this came from i'm gonna share\nthis because it's really funny\ni don't know where this came from\nbut one day he came and he like\nwhispered in my ear was it like while i\nwas sleeping which also could have been\na bit creepy but um he came whispering\nwhen he was like you are loved you were\ncherished you were know is it you do\nyou are loved you are cared for you are\ncherished like a little cherub\num\nso and then since then i know he says a\njoke but really he he feels like it\nactually makes me feel a bit cute like i\nlike it um so since then every time i\nfeel like i'm getting stressed out or he\nsees me getting a bit worked up like if\ni'm cooking in the kitchen for like 50\npeople um\nhe'll come up to me hug me and say you\nare loved you are cared for you are\ncherished like a little cherub\nso that makes me feel kind of cared for\nand loved um\nand what else do you do that i feel\nloved and ted well just every day he's\njust like i've said this before but it's\njust an ongoing thing with him like he's\njust always very loving and caring on a\ndaily basis that um there's never really\na need for like special gestures or like\ncrazy stuff because i feel like it's\njust stable and he's just always i\nalways feel supported and loved and\ncared for by him because that's just how\nhe is\nyeah for me it's we talked about this\nlast year where we talked about like\nlove languages and things like that\nbut\nit's interesting how even the love\nlanguages are so much deeper than just\nthe way they're spoken about so i was\nalways a gift person growing up which i\nspoke about last year\nbut\nwe both live a life where we both don't\nlive for gifts anymore like if i want\nsomething i buy it for myself because i\nneed it at that time everybody wants\nsomething she buys it so we don't give\neach other gifts at all anymore as in\nphysical objects or gifts because we\nknow that if we want something we'll get\nit for ourselves or\nwe don't really have a need for a lot of\nstuff like we don't have a lot of things\nin that way in our life i feel but for\nme\nthe biggest one has been the\nway rather he has understood my love\nlanguage in the deepest way so in the\nlast two years and we spoke of one of\nthem last year but raleigh has thrown me\ntwo of the biggest surprise parties i\nhave\nand one was for my birthday which is\nwhen we first moved to l.a yeah but last\nyear\nit was after my live show yeah and so i\ni want to talk about this for a moment\nbecause it was so important so\ni did my first ever live show in la\nnearly 2 000 of you showed up it was\npacked it was at the ace theater my team\nand i had worked for six weeks to\nprepare this incredible show that we\nwere absolutely so proud of and in love\nwith to put on stage i'd been practicing\nwith my team for like eight hours nine\nhours a day for a week beforehand\nand then you're on stage i was on stage\nfor about two and a half hours we had\nthis incredible show people traveled\nfrom like japan and australia and london\nand from all over the world and people\nreally had this phenomenal experience\nand then you experience something really\nunique\nso just think about that for a moment\nyou've got\nyou've put all this effort into building\nthis thing\nyou then experience it with thousands of\npeople\nand then you're grabbing your bags\nyou're grabbing your clothes and you're\ngetting into the back of an uber on your\nown\nit's it's like it's like one of the\nweirdest experiences ever where you go\nfrom this real height then almost\nbeing in completely the opposite\nscenario\nand on my way home i was thinking i was\nlike\nwow now i realize so many of the people\ni coach so many people i work with so\nmany people i know\nwho live these much more extreme highs\nthan i do like they have like 80 000\npeople 100 000 people in you know their\naudiences or whatever and then all of a\nsudden they're spending time alone\nwithout that buzz in rush\nand i was thinking\nthere are so many people that get\ndissatisfied by not having that all the\ntime and feel lost and confused and i\nwas thinking about the most important\npeople in my life and i was like well\ni'm going back to my wife who loves me\nand you know that's such a\nsuch a fulfilling feeling\nand i was like i have friends but\nanyway i'm going home\nand when i get home\ni walk through the door and there's like\neveryone i care about is in that room\nliterally\nall my closest friends are at my house\nthere's this big surprise riley has\nalways cooked like this incredible meal\nshe's got like these amazing balloons\nthat spell out j s live she's got this\namazing chocolate cake\nuh and it was just like this really\nfulfilling feeling that\ni'm so fortunate to have an incredible\ngroup of people around me that love me\nthat really care for me that are going\nto stay at my house till midnight on a\nwork night\nto celebrate my day with me that i've\ndone this event\nand\nrather he's just figured out a way of\ngiving me the gifts that i can't buy\nmyself\nand and i think that's what a gift\nreally is whether it's an object whether\nit's a thing whether it's an experience\na real gift\nis giving someone something they can't\ngive themselves\nand\ni\nyou can't organize a surprise party for\nyourself\nyou can't organize a party face where\nyou tell all your friends to come and\nsurprise you if you know it's happening\nand she's really figured out the depth\nof the love language of the definition\nof gift and my gift in my opinion but\ndon't be expecting this like every year\ni'm expecting it every year now it's\nhappened the last two years i'm i might\ndie always happens around november\nhonestly no there's something about\nnovember\ni cannot explain how much i dislike\norganizing surprise better but you do\nthem really well like you're really good\nat it yeah because i've done like two\nfor you now look if you want to hire me\nto um throw your girlfriend boyfriend's\nor your own surprise party\nthen i'm available and i have all the\ncontacts because i've done it twice for\nhim now and it took all the energy that\ni could possibly imagine that i had they\nwere amazing thank you but yeah no that\nwas also like for me going out of my\ncomfort zone to do something i know that\nhe would have been really happy about\nbecause\ni'm not an organized person and i find\nthose things really difficult and\nstressful but it was definitely worth it\nbecause you came in and you were\nactually so surprised i thought you knew\nbut all i made all of his friends and us\nlike all rushed out of the event like\nokay cool pc later i'm a bit tired i'm\ngonna go to bed um\nand then everybody waited here for a\nreally long time for you to come back\neveryone who weighed it down and it was\nreally sweet\nit's really special thank you so much\nand that's one of the things actually i\nwant to talk about that for a moment\nthis\nis that\nwhen we first moved to la from new york\nliterally everyone who heard that we\nwere moving would say to us you know\nwhat people are liking yeah that's so\ntrue like you know that everyone in la\nis superficial you know everyone in l.a\ndoesn't really care\nand we heard that so much\nand i've always had this\nrule in life for myself that no matter\nwhat i hear from someone about something\nsomeone or anywhere\ni won't trust it or base my opinion on\nit until i've experienced it myself and\ni've always had that rule so if someone\ntells me this is an amazing holiday\ndestination\nuntil i've been to that place i will not\nagree with that\nif someone tells me this person is not\nnice or is nice i will not agree or\ndisagree with that until i've met and\nexperienced that person yeah and also\nactually spend time with them not just\nspend time with them an elevator or\nsomething like that like actually spend\nquality time with them\nand so for me\ni was like well if you think that about\nla or loads of people think that about\nla i'm not going to let that define la\nfor me i'm gonna define la for myself\nand i have to be completely honest like\nwe have met some of our closest deepest\nfriends and so many of you i know\nlistening and watching right now\nsome of our deepest and closest friends\nwe found and made in l.a definitely and\ni know radi feels that that's what she\nfeels at home here i know i feel that\nthat's what i feel at home here you know\nwho you are\nand that's such a special thing that\nthese stereotypes and these broad\ngeneralizations we make\nabout people\nor places\nare not true they become what you want\nthem to be\nand i really feel in our life that\nla's been such a beautiful place for\nboth of us to find our purpose and\ncreate our purpose and live our purpose\nand\nyou know you can't really define a place\njust based you can't just say that a\nplace has a reputation or anything like\nthat because you you find the people\nwhere they are so for me the people i've\nmet here and the friends i've made here\nhave just been absolutely incredible\nyeah and\nand for me what we've really tried to do\nand i think this is important too is\nwe've tried to build\nthe conscious spiritual community that\nwe want\nso rather than expecting that what you\nwant should exist anyway why not create\nyourself so we started hosting these\nevents at our home last year we did two\nof them we're doing another one coming\nup soon\nwe invite our friends to them in their\nspiritual events community events that\nwe used to have in london\nand in new york a little bit but\ndefinitely in london and we wanted our\nfriends to experience meditation in the\nway we meditate we wanted our friends to\nexperience wisdom from the people that\nwe learn from and so we started\norganizing these events and now they're\nnot parties in the same way like we\ndon't have any alcohol at these events\nlike no one's getting you know it's not\nit's not that kind of an event it's um\nit's an event where people feel that\nthey can connect with themselves a place\nwhere people feel they can connect with\ntheir consciousness and have a deeper\nexperience and that was the experience\nwe wanted to offer our friends and\nthankfully our friends loved that kind\nof stuff so it's worked out but i just\nthink it's so important that we don't\nexpect things in a place but you go and\ncreate for yourself\ncool all right okay next one that is on\nthe list what are some telltale signs\nthat your partner is upset\nyeah he's pretty obvious um\nif he's mad he'll sound mad\nif he's sad he'll sound sad\ni'm pretty if he needs chocolate he'll\nsound like he needs chocolate\num\nyeah i feel like you kind of just\nif he's upset he'll just put look\nlike i need to tell you this is upset me\noh yeah you're like that right kind of\nthink of the last time you were upset oh\nyesterday night when he was mad about\nhis charges i knew he was mad\ni heard it in his voice\num\nyeah i don't think we're very hidden\nwith it i think i'm probably a little\nbit more hidden than you are just quiet\nyeah go quiet or i'll see her on the\nbalcony crying yes\nliterally literally that i just see her\noutside\nobviously she wakes up earlier than me\nso i'll wake up and she's outside and i\njust sit next to the tears\ni cry sometimes during my meditations in\nthe morning it's like my time and then\nsuddenly i'll realize i'm sad about\nsomething and then i'll just start\ncrying and then he catches me at that\ntime or yeah my quietness i need to we\nspoke about this last time but i need\ntime to process so but you also tell me\nwhen you're sad about something yeah\nsomeone will be like i'm sad it's not\nabout you yeah but i'm sad that's also\nvery easy this happens a lot this is a\nyeah oh no because i get so you know i\nthink we're all in one sense we're all\nso self-centered that we always feel\nlike people are sad because of something\nwe did like it's a self-centered ego\ntrick where like if she said it must be\nsomething i did even though i know i\ndidn't do anything wrong and so then i\nbut her telling me i'm sad but it's\nnothing to do with you it's like you\nknow it's actually a useful technique in\nrelation irritated right now and i don't\nknow why i've done this a lot i feel\nreally irritated i don't know why but i\njust want you to know that i'm feeling\nthat way so it's really taken away\nyeah it's just really useful to\ncommunicate that to your partner rather\nthan expecting them like no one's a mind\nreader\nlike no one is a mind reader and i think\none of the biggest challenges in\nrelationship is you just expect the\nother person to know what you're\nthinking\nyeah awesome cool all right that was a\nquick one cool okay this one is\ndo you still try to impress each other\nyeah probably i feel like it's just like\na subcon like an unconscious thing that\nyou do where it's unconscious\nsubconscious one of the consciousnesses\num something conscious um thing that you\ndo where it's like whether it's your\noutfit or whether it's like something\nyou've like done or made or like if i've\ncooked something i think this wasn't\nalways an element of wanting the other\nperson to approve or to like it yeah um\ni think that's natural yeah yeah i like\nyou too yeah definitely like if i'm\nwearing something or\ni've achieved something or whatever it\nmay be like yeah i i i love that and i\nthink it's an important thing to have\nlike i don't think you should feel like\nthat right yeah it's like\nif and and impress in the sense if it's\nnot about getting the other person's\nvalidation yeah you want your partner to\nlike be excited i acknowledge yeah for\nyou recognize you and i i love that\nfeeling like i don't and i think if i\ndidn't feel that way about her\nthen you're going to find other people\nto impress\nand you're going to want to impress\nother people yeah and so i feel like\nit's an important quality to have and i\nfeel like you\nyou lose that energy and the spark if\nyou\nstop trying to do that to each other\nbecause that's how you were when you\nfirst met like that's what you tried to\ndo when you first met and if you stopped\ndoing that\nit's yeah it's just it's not about\nvalidation that's not the ego one it's\nabout\nknowing that you love someone and always\nlike and knowing that the other person\nexcited when you're excited too yeah\nyeah\nyeah\nall right cool next you don't add\nanything no okay let's go all right okay\npower through so\nwhat do you like most about your\npartner's sense of humor\noh my gosh guys so i feel like most of\nyou only realize this when he went on\nstage at the live show if you were there\nbut he is actually really well okay no\nhe's become really funny\nactually you were funny-ish before but\nlike he had a lot of dad jokes but now\noh my gosh he's taking his humor to\nanother level i don't know where he's\ncome from\num but\nlike at the live show you were on fire i\nwas laughing so hard and most of the\ntime i'm like hmm this is funny um but i\nwas actually crying with laughs like you\nwere really good on stage and i feel\nlike when you're in your element\nall like different sides of you come out\nand you really like you come into who\nyou like fully are on stage and that was\nreally cool for us and i had so many\npeople message me about how funny you\nwere on stage and that they had no idea\nthat you had humor in you um but that\nwas really cool to see\num what was the question again what do\nyou like most about your partner's sense\nof humor oh yeah now he really knows how\nto make me laugh like even if it's\nreally silly stuff i can't even think of\nit right now but you definitely know how\nto make me from my belly laugh not just\nuh that was cute but i still take it too\nfast yeah sometimes it's like i'm\nlaughing really hard and then it keeps\ngoing because like he thinks it's gonna\nmake me keep laughing but then he kind\nof ruins it but that's also quite funny\ni do that a lot yeah i do that a lot\nwhen she's like okay you went too fast\nyeah it's like i feel like i'm just\ngoing to get one more laugh\nyeah\nyeah no my st on stage is where i feel\nlike i'm at my\nmost\nmyself in terms of when i'm sharing and\ni i feel like yeah i feel like i'm at my\nbest on stage so i i love being with the\naudience and i love that energy that\neveryone gave me that day as well and\nyou know when\nwhen i'll be touring soon as well i\ncan't wait to meet so many more of you\nso it'll be fun\nbut yeah okay about you what's my\nfavorite thing radi is literally exactly\nwho she is on her instagram\nlike i just whenever anyone tells me\nlike i love her post like i love the\nlight she is like that is her like\nthat's just her all the time like i wake\nup and she'll be doing a dance like when\ni walk into the living room or or like\ni come home and she's just like smiling\nand laughing and she'll make jokes about\neverything like raleigh doesn't take\nlife seriously i feel and that's what i\nlove about you so much and what i mean\nby that is she takes her spiritual life\nseriously but then she doesn't take her\nday seriously like she's happy to laugh\nat herself she's happy to laugh at\nwhat's going on we can both be like\ntalking about something really serious\nat one point then we'll both start\nlaughing because she's able to laugh at\nit and and i just think she's always got\nthis childlike energy and it's not\nchildish because\nwe don't you know we don't want people\nto act childish but when people are\nchildlike and riley really has that like\nshe always makes everyone laugh\nshe's yeah she just says funny stuff\nthroughout the day and the dancers are\nthe best and uh\ni love it i know rhythm dances and\nthey're the best i'm just so happy that\ni get to experience them all the time\nlike i'm really really happy like you've\nmade\nyou've brought you are literally the\ncomedian of our lives yeah i mean you're\ncatching up there yeah you are catching\nup with your jokes i have to i'll give\nyou that you're definitely\nbecoming more funnier with age i like\nyour sense of humor as playful and not\nlike contrived it's not like she tells\nknock-knock jokes and stuff like that\nit's just playful it's childlike it's\nabundant like it's just there it's who\nshe is it's like it's the best thing\nabout you oh thanks yeah and i love\nseeing you laugh\nthat's the best thing because she loves\nour own jokes the most oh i laugh at\nmine and i love watching her laugh at\nher own jokes because because i feel\nlike look if there's ever a time when\nyou need to laugh and there's nobody\naround you need to be able to be at a\npoint where you can make yourself laugh\nif you're having a bad day make yourself\nlaugh don't leave it on somebody else\nit's good advice thanks\nall right we've only got a few more left\nto go okay i'm ready okay\noh bradley also does i want to add this\nrather also does some\nfunny stuff that makes me laugh a lot so\nwe went to this\nhalloween party\nand it was a fancy dress party obviously\nas halloween is and riley came up with\nthis idea about a month before\nthat we should go\nas a rajasthani prince and princess\nbased on this movie called padmavati for\nthose of you who watch bollywood\nand so\nriley came up with that idea i'm you\nknow i would probably gone as batman or\nsomething average so i was like okay\nyeah that's cool like it's different\nlet's do it\nyou tell the rest of the story so i i\nthought of the idea and then obviously\nyou either have to do it fully or you\njust end up looking\njust odd so i thought okay let's go the\nfull way so that meant having pretty\nmuch like a bridal indian outfit on um\nand he was wearing basically a groom's\noutfit for a wedding\nand\nin theory it looked really cool in my\nhead which it did but it was so heavy\nlike my headpiece the skirt i he had to\none push me into the car it was so big i\nhad to lift it like it lifts my dress\ninto the car then i lasted about 30\nminutes at the event and i was like i\nhave to go home i literally cannot lift\nthis anymore my head was hurting\num the skirt was too heavy to like move\nabout in so i lasted at that party for\n30 minutes came home undressed got into\nmy pjs\nso i walked around the party for the\nrest of the night as a as a single\nindian prince yeah and this hat with my\nsword yes wearing an indian outfit yeah\nhe had a sword i got it when i was with\nher like it only looked good\nensemble like together but me on my own\nit was not cool everyone was like\nit was horrendous it was so horrendous i\ndon't know\ni don't know how i didn't think about\nthat part yeah i got over excited about\nthis stuff so funny about you there yeah\nthat was that was not one of my best\nmoments\nokay so this question is what are you\nproudest of your partner from the last\n12 months since the first since the\nfirst podcast oh okay so definitely the\nlive event was one of them because you\nalso showed people that you made them\nlaugh so that was cool for me and then\nthe other thing was obviously your book\nbecause i've been watching him\nwork on this book for gosh how long have\nyou been writing it for 12 months 12\nmonths yeah he's been writing it for 12\nmonths and i've only read bits of it but\nfrom what i have seen it's just been so\namazing i want to see his dedication to\nthe book how authentic he's trying to\nmake it and um also just how you get to\nsee and hear a different side of him\nlike i feel like this podcast you you\nknow you you show yourself in a certain\nway and um on your videos you have\nanother like another part of you and\nthis book i feel like is a completely\ndifferent side of you as well that\npeople are going to be able to\nexperience and\njust the amount of energy and time and\neffort you've gone in to really make\nsure it is like the best quality stuff\nin the book\num and the bits that i've read i just\nthink it's going to be so what i love\nabout it is that it's literally made\njust to really help people like find\ntheir purpose and that's the thing about\nyou like you\nand i know you've said i think you said\nthis the other day that like your worst\nfear and like your worst nightmare up is\nfor people not to live their potential\nwhatever that potential is big small um\nwhatever it is for them like for them to\nlive their potential that's your that's\nyour like dream for everybody and so i\nreally think that this book is like\nalmost your first step in like serving\nthose people to really help them find\ntheir find their potential and i think\nit's just such a beautiful book and\nyeah just seeing you go through that\nprocess was really really interesting\nbecause it's hard work and uh the\nhardest thing excited for it to come out\nthough and like see everyone's reaction\nand\nfeedback and how it's helped people so\nyeah that's definitely another huge\nhighlight yeah it was definitely the\nhardest thing i've ever done so yeah\nyeah thanks\ni love you yeah that's it that uh\nshe's one exam away from being an\nayurvedic health counselor if i pass\nwhich is amazing she will pass i know\nshe's been working really really hard\nlike i see her revising and i always\nthink like i'm so happy i no longer have\nto revise like work is hard but revising\nfor exams was so stressful like\nit wasn't a fun feeling like now i'm\nlike work my work is my work life is fun\nobviously i love it but and it's\nchallenging but it's not an exam like\nthere's something about exams that just\nso radhi still does exams because she's\namazing and wants to learn and what i\nlove about her desire to learn it's not\njust to get a qualification or to get a\ntitle it's like\nshe really has this belief that she\nwants to know\nand learn and deeply understand\nsomething before she teaches it and i\nlove her integrity for that i love her\nauthenticity for that i think it's a\nbeautiful quality that she has that she\nnever wants to mislead anyone she never\nwants to give someone a little bit of\ninformation she really wants to feel\nlike she has a full grasp of something\nbefore she tells someone else to do it\nand i think that that is such a\nbeautiful quality to have and i really\nreally respect it so that's been amazing\nto what you do\nand watching you create a full menu\nfor a restaurant in london that we both\ntasted and went to check out together\nand the food tasted amazing\nand radi designed the whole menu and i\nknow she's been testing recipes she's\nworking on this product for like three\nfour years forget the last 12 months\nlike she's turned up at food events\nshe's turned up at food festivals where\nshe's like\nmaking food for like hundreds of\nthousands of people that are coming to\neat like she's done that time and time\nagain to test her recipes like the\namount of effort that goes into creating\na recipe like one recipe\nit's like thousands of people have had\nto eat that before\nshe knows if it's right it's not just\nlike oh yeah jay likes it it gets on the\nmenu it's like she's you know cooking\nfor so many people to test in to finally\nhave that menu and to taste that with\nher and just to be so impressed by what\nshe did it was just amazing like what an\namazing achievement yeah\nand it was so challenging in so many\ndifferent ways you know working across\ntime zones you know having to travel\nback constantly like\ncooking in her parents home cooking
