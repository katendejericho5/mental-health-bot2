la netflix\ncomedy festival show at the ace theatre\non may 6 2022 so make sure you grab some\ntickets uh welcome to the show taylor\ntomlinson taylor thank you so much thank\nyou so much i we were just talking about\nthis before we started recording but i\nwas like what am i doing here like truly\ni your podcast is\njust full of so many interesting wise\npeople teaching you how to live a better\nlife and so to come in as a stand-up\ncomedian and you're like i can't wait to\nlearn things from you i'm like uh yeah\nabsolutely i have so much to teach\nuh i'm i'm coming into this fully hoping\nto i almost brought a notebook to take\nnotes because that's how i feel every\ntime i listen to your podcast or watch\nany of your tick tocks like i am still\nthinking about the video where you talk\nabout checking your phone first thing in\nthe morning where you're like you\nwouldn't just have a hundred people come\ninto your bedroom and i'm like oh my god\nthat's\nthat's exactly what you're doing every\nmorning and i'm still terrible at it i\ndo it every morning but every time i do\nit i think about you telling me not to\nyeah well i genuinely feel that not only\ndo i laugh at everything you put out i\nmean i can name my top three favorite uh\nmoments in your special easily i think\nfor me i also learned from you because i\nthink\nwhat you do so phenomenally well\nespecially when it comes to love and\nrelationships but also life is you're\nable to get inside people's minds as to\nhow they think about situations and how\nthey navigate relationships and how they\nmake certain decisions in their life and\nso i do think you teach i'm not\nexpecting you to teach\ni i want to laugh with you today i want\nto get to know you better this was just\nan excuse for me to be a fan and for me\nto hang out with someone that i admire\nand adore so much and and genuinely from\neven the few moments we've spent i'm\njust so happy meeting you and i hope\nthis kicks off a wonderful friendship so\nthat's kind of why i do this whole\npodcast i love that is to be able to\nlure people into being friends with me\nbut uh but uh i i'm so excited i want to\nstart\nby talking about a lot of your journey\nbecause i think i discovered you like i\nsaid uh through your first special and\nyou've been doing this for a lot longer\nthan that and then i kind of went\nbackwards and i was like oh wait a\nminute like\nthis person is incredible and it's such\na fascinating story and i am interested\nin stories because what we were just\ntalking about now that sometimes when\nyou see someone\nsecond netflix special sold out tours\nlike you look at that person you go oh\nyeah that they've always been that way\nand when i look at you i go well wait a\nminute your father signed you up for a\nstand-up class\nwhy did he do that that sounds like a\npainful thing for a father to do i think\na woman at our church\nwanted to do it and she told him about\nit and then he brought me along thinking\ni could write for him maybe oh wow he\nwas like more of a performer so uh i'm\nvery glad he did you know for whatever\nreason and yeah it is a very strange\nthing because i didn't i didn't get into\nthis\nsuper intentionally like it was\nsomething i sort of fell into\nas a result of just this one woman going\ni think i'm going to take the stand-up\nclass because she was like a retired\nschool teacher and did some public\nspeaking events and wanted to inject\nsome humor into it so\nit's funny how something as small as\nthat like an after service conversation\njust\nsnowballed into my entire life my entire\ncareer\nand you and i were talking earlier about\njust you being very young as well and\nyou being so successful in in what you\ndo and how it seems like\nyou know maybe you've only been doing\nthis for five years online and you're\nlike but i've been doing this\nthere's 17 years before that that i\nwas teaching and and\ninterviewing and learning and and i've\nhad all these life experiences\nand uh i think a lot of people\nlook at my career\nsimilarly sometimes where they go well\nyou\nyou blew up very quickly or you got all\nthese opportunities very quickly\nand i think i feel very self-conscious\nabout that sometimes because 28 is very\nlucky and young to have two netflix\nspecials it was not something i ever\nanticipated uh\nachieving at this age i've just been\nvery fortunate but then i i think back\nto\nwhen i actually started and i'm like oh\ni've been doing this for 12 years yes so\nokay\nit's not like i i just started yesterday\nbut i think when you are\nyounger than what people expect yes from\nsomeone doing what you do\nthere can sometimes be a little bit of\nlike oh well it's just been easy for you\nyou just did it yeah and it but i also\nfind it it's quite an untraditional\njourney and it's so funny because we\nshared that my parents forced me to go\nto a public speaking class and drama\nclass when i was 11 years old because\nthey thought i was too shy\nand i didn't have any confidence and so\nmy parents signed me up to lambda which\nis the london academy of music drama and\narts and they said they forced the\nschool to allow me in because they\nmissed the sign up date or something\nlike that and they're like begged and\npleaded with one of the teachers saying\nwe really need our son to do this\nbecause he's shy and he doesn't have\nconfidence\nand now i look back and i think wow my\nparents made this amazing decision just\nlike you said that has impacted my whole\nlife and i think i i would i wouldn't\nhave had that opportunity if i didn't do\nthat so but even for you it's it's a\nafter sermon after service conversation\nlike that sounds very untraditional at\nleast from my external ignorance oh\nabsolutely it's the thing people ask\nabout the most because it's it's not an\norigin story\ni think many stand-up comedians have and\nif they do have it they are generally\nstill in the church world because there\nis a\nthere is a comedy church circuit that's\namazing\ni mean yeah it's it's a different it's a\ndifferent path that i did not choose to\ngo down um but yeah i mean it's\nthere are so many different ways to\ndo stand-up professionally like i think\nthat's what we forget like i also had a\nyear in my early 20s where i did like\neight cruise ship weeks wow which is a\nwhole other thing and there are\ncomedians who only do that like i feel\nlike i've been very fortunate in my\ncareer that i have experienced kind of a\nlot of different\npockets of this industry that is more\nthan just getting the netflix special\ngetting the hbo special\ni've done corporates and i've done\ncolleges that's how i went full-time\ninitially when i was 21 or 20 is i was\ndoing all these college gigs that's why\ni dropped out of college to go perform\nat colleges which is sort of funny\nand\ncruise ships and churches yeah i mean\ni've i've kind of done\neverything you could do and then also\nall the bars and and\nstrange shows you do in backyards and\nwhatnot so uh yeah it's there's a lot of\ndifferent places to exist\nand and do what you love to do it's not\njust this one\npath that you see on tv or in movies or\ndocumentaries so i think that's\nimportant for people to know as well who\nwant to do something creative whatever\nthat may be that it can look like a lot\nof different things yeah definitely and\ni think\nobviously you know on this podcast that\nwe try and get into the psychology and\nmindset and\nthe way people make shifts and what i\nfind fascinating about stand-up comedy\nand what you do\nis that it really requires you to\novercome some base fears\nlike the fears of what will people think\nhow will i look how will i be received\nthese are huge fears and\npersonally i think stand-up comics\nface one of the hardest things because\nit's like you're introducing this person\nis going to make you laugh and this\nperson is funny\nand then it's like it's the expectation\nis so much higher\ntalk to me about that first time or\nmaybe something you learned\nin that stand-up class that started to\nbe that you started to be okay with that\nfear and dealing with that or did you\nnever feel that fear at all oh i was\nterrified i mean do you feel like you\nwere shy yeah i was like like definitely\nmassively how long did it take for you\nto sort of feel like you weren't or do\nyou still feel\non a base level you're shy and you've\njust figured out how to not\nact that way yeah i i find that so\nfrom 11 to 18 i went to\npublic speaking and drama school and\nthose years gave me the skills but i\ndidn't have anything i was passionate to\ntalk about until i lived as a monk and\nuntil i understood the wisdom of the\nvedas that i studied and now i share so\nto me it was almost like you have a\ntoolkit but i never used it because\ni still didn't feel confident i actually\ngot confidence because of what i was\nsharing i have so much more faith and\nconfidence in the ideas i share than i\ndo even in myself\nand i think that's what gives me so much\nexcitement and enthusiasm but having\nsaid that now i would say that\neven today i feel really confident when\ni'm one-on-one with someone and when we\nboth know what role we play but if i\nturn up to a random event that isn't my\nevent\nthat is someone else's event\ni will just try and find one person that\ni can have a really deep intimate\nconversation with as opposed to go up to\neveryone and introduce myself and make\nsure that everyone knows i came to the\ni'm not like that because i feel more\ncomfortable getting to know someone\ndeeply so i would still consider myself\nif it's my event i'm not shy because i\nknow what role i play there and i'm\ndoing something but i would say i'm shy\nwhen i'm at an event where i don't have\na role does that make sense yeah\nabsolutely so i think that\ni think that is on a base level i'm an\nintrovert and i'm shy yes i feel the\nexact same way and i felt like that for\nyears and i still feel that way i have i\nthink a lot of social anxiety um i think\nthat\nwhen i started doing stand-up\ni i always liked performing\nbut i\nonce i found stand up i was like oh this\nis where i feel\nthe best is on stage doing this thing\nthis is where i feel like myself and\nactually when i first started doing\nstand-up i felt like\nthe version\nof myself that i was on stage was who i\nwanted to be in\nlife all the time but i couldn't because\ni was too shy and i didn't have the\nconfidence\nand then at a certain point it it became\nmore true to who i was\nout in the world and and now\ni'm i'm at this weird place where i'm\nlike is that\neven me is that the most is that the\npurest version of me\nis that the most\nsort of polished version of me like it's\nvery strange to be in this business and\nsee so many videos of yourself and so\nmany photos of yourself and it can feel\nvery like dysmorphic where you're like\nwho who am i is that yeah who is that\nthat's not me especially when you're\nyou are achieving these goals you've\nalways had like\nyou know when i got on conan or\nsomething like i was like i'm in the\nthing i've been watching for years since\ni was a kid\nand you're it's sort of this strange out\nof body experience but\ni was i was terrified of performing when\ni first started doing stand-up i mean i\nfelt sick like physically sick\nfor days before i went on stage how did\nyou push through that like how did you\nget through that i just loved it so much\nthat i\ni just wanted to do it more than i was\nscared to do it yeah um\nwhich is\nsort of how you have to be if you are\nsomebody who's not\nnaturally extroverted or what have you\nand i think really what helped is\nonce i graduated high school and and\nwas\ndoing stand-up consistently in san diego\nonce you're doing\nmultiple spots a night it takes less\npressure off of it and you don't have as\nmuch time to be nervous yeah yeah that's\na good point because i'm sure you feel\nthe same way where you're like i do a\npodcast every other day like i'm not\ngonna get nervous to meet somebody new\nagain\nit's a muscle it's really just a muscle\nand if i don't go on stage for a few\nweeks which doesn't really happen like\nwhen we had lockdown and i didn't go on\nstage for five six months\nthe first time back on stage even for a\nzoom audience was terrifying yes yes\nlike it'll come rushing right back it's\nnot like i'm\nlike oh i'll just go on stage and i get\nnervous to do spots in town i get\nnervous to try\nnew stuff i mean i'm\nso lucky to be on this tour where people\nhave\npaid money to see me specifically\nbecause for years it wasn't like that\nfor years it was\npeople got free tickets or they got\nbarked into a club in a mall and they\nwere like yeah we'll go see comedy and\nmaybe it's not what i want but we'll\ncheck it out we'll give it a chance\nobviously all of that makes it a little\neasier to go out on stage and know you\nhave that that grace period yes at the\nvery least\nbut i think just the consistency and\nknowing that you can do the job\nthat's where you get the confidence and\nlike you said you have more confidence\nin what you're saying when i was first\nstarting out i was a teenager i didn't\nfeel like i could talk about anything\nwith any sort of\nyeah wisdom or explicit experience yeah\ni i and then i started talking about the\nfact that i had no wisdom or experience\nand that's what quarter life crisis is\nyes because i was like what am i going\nto talk about how about the fact that i\ndon't know anything\nand so many people came up to me after\nshows going oh my gosh that's exactly\nhow i feel i don't know what i'm doing\ni i hate being this age it's so\nconfusing\nbecause i had always just assumed\neveryone's having a great time in their\n20s everybody's killing it and i didn't\nhave a traditional college experience\nbecause i dropped out to do stand-up so\ni i didn't feel like i was doing my\nyouth correctly yeah\nand so to start talking about that on\nstage thinking it was like a new angle\nand then to have everyone go oh we feel\nthe exact same way even like people who\nlooked like they\nwere killing it in that area where i'm\nlike you look like you go out on the\nweekends and everything's awesome for\nyou yeah uh was really validating for me\nand the same with the new special look\nat you i mean so much of it is about\nmy own struggles with mental health and\nuh\nfinding out that i was bipolar and all\nthese different things and losing my mom\nat a young age and getting the feedback\nfrom people that they relate to it or\nthey've\ndealt with\nsimilar things if not the same things\nin a selfish way it makes you feel\nbetter about it and it makes you feel\nmore confident in talking about your own\nexperiences because\nyou know with the internet you can find\nyour audience now maybe not everybody\nrelates to what you're talking about or\nwants to hear you talk about something\nbut the people who do\nreally appreciate it and really do\nconnect with it and\nso that's that's how i try to\nright now as i just try to write about\nthings that\ni want to talk about or i want to hear\nabout\nand and find other people to relate to\nme about\nyeah i love that your special is called\nquarter life crisis because even in the\nwork i do i find that that is such a key\npillar of a lot of people i connect with\nso they're coming to you to to laugh and\nunderstand and feel heard and and\nresonated and a lot of people will say\nto me well jay i'm stuck with where i am\nor i don't like my career what was that\ntransition like of saying i'm okay\nwith\nnot going down the\nright correct path of staying at college\ncompleting but i'm actually going to go\nand do off do something that i enjoy and\nlove like what was that transition like\nfor you was it one welcomed by yourself\nand the people around you with\nexcitement and joy or was it surrounded\nwith worry and anxiety and and a sense\nof oh this is going to be tough or i'm\nactually scared about this i think when\ni left college i had booked\nenough work right that like i would have\nnever just quit college to\nsee you know like i had enough work\nbooked i i physically couldn't go to\ncollege anymore um because at the time\nthe school i was at didn't have enough\nlike online options so i just i just\ncouldn't and i had already taken a\nsemester off to\naudition for all these colleges there's\nsomething called naca where you\nessentially auditioned for a bunch of\ncollege bookers and so i had booked like\n50 colleges in the winter and spring and\ni was like oh i'm gonna be gone for like\nthree weeks at a time\nperforming at these schools\nmostly on the east coast so i can't and\ni think i just told myself well you can\ngo back you can go back yeah and i told\nmyself that for years i told myself that\nuntil i got the first netflix special\nonce i got the first netflix special i\nwas like i think i don't have to go back\nto school and then the pandemic hit and\ni was like maybe i do\nso i really wasn't like all in like i\nwas like i held on to that because i was\ni was a good student i\nreally\nthought that i was\ngoing to college i was going to finish\nlike\na lot of it was tied up in like being a\ngood kid i suppose so that wasn't\nsomething that i made a hard decision on\nit was something that i\nsort of over time accepted yeah as long\nas everything was going well in my\ncareer um what was harder honestly was\njust moving away from being a clean\ncomedian and and\nthat transition from i never performed\nin churches exclusively and i didn't\nwant to perform in churches exclusively\nor even mostly but to\nmove away from\nbeing somebody that could and it was\nthis like squeaky clean\nuh act that you know your family isn't\nembarrassed to watch or anything uh was\nwas really difficult and that took a\ncouple years as well because there's a\nlot of internalized shame that comes\nwith that and um\nfeeling like you're\nnot good enough for the world you grew\nup in but then also being too\nuh\nfeeling too like\ninexperienced for this like rock and\nroll stand-up world yeah because it's\nyou know i don't drink and i don't\nreally\ni didn't really do any drugs like i just\nwasn't fun so i was like so you're not\ngonna be clean and respectable but\nyou're also not gonna party like which\nis again a huge part of quarter life as\ni was like what am i doing\nwhat am i doing because i'm i'm\nboring enough\nto\nbe someone who should be like married\nright now but i'm not like where's my\nperson like you know it's just\nit's\nit's a strange time in your life yeah\nand i've had friends tell me that\nsomewhat harshly where they were like\nhey i know you're complaining about\nwhatever relationship not working out\nromantically but your career is going\nreally well\nand you are in your 20s and\npeople have this idea like everything's\nsupposed to line up by whatever age they\nchoose\nas the end the end goal\nand i was certainly guilty of that and\ni've had friends\nvery uh very bluntly say like hey\nmaybe\njust be happy with one area of your life\ngoing great yeah and trust that the\nother areas are gonna catch up yeah or\nfocus on the other areas instead of this\none that you've been pouring all of your\nenergy into\nthat is probably the most real answer\ni've heard to that question i really\nappreciate it because\nand that is such great advice even\nthough you didn't know you were giving\nadvice because\nwhen you started to talk about how when\nyou made that shift you always knew you\ncould go back\nand that the next stage was developed\ninstead of just throwing yourself into\nit and i think those are such healthy\nconcepts i mean\ni even say to my point of this even at\nthis stage in my life i'll sometimes be\nlike i can always go back to the\ncorporate world if i need to pay the\nbills like just because and and it's not\ni'm actually not joking about that at\nall i genuinely say that because it\ngives me the freedom\nto not live in a what-if world\nof well what if this doesn't work and\nwhat if this it allows me to let go of\nthat and say i would have\nan amazing life because i'm so fortunate\nto have had a great education that that\nwould have got me a particular job and a\njob that i had or for you to say hey you\nknow what even beyond all this i could\ngo back to college and study again\nand i had a friend recently and i'm\nencouraging a lot of my friends who are\nin that quarter life crisis where\nthey're stuck in jobs they don't love\nor they worked really hard for a career\nbut it isn't what they wanted to do\ntruly in their heart they did it out of\nsociety pressure family pressure\nwhatever it may have been and a lot of\nthem are now making pivots so one of\nthem's at film school in la\none of them went on to actually become a\nstress coach for his own industry of law\nand and they're making these pivots at\nlike potentially some of them between 25\nto 30 some of them 30 to 35\nand it's fascinating seeing their\njourneys because it's exactly like what\nyou're saying they're like oh but i can\ngo back if i need to and going backwards\nisn't as\ntaboo as we make it out to be like we\nmake it seem like if you're not moving\nforwards your life's falling apart it's\nlike sometimes you have to go backwards\nto to re-navigate and reconfigure and so\ni love that answer\nand and even more so what i really\nappreciated\nabout what you said towards the end\nthere\nis\nthe idea that\nwhen you're feeling accelerated progress\nin one area of your life\nwe've also been\nsomewhat\ntrained to believe that everything\nshould move\nat the same time\nand that\nyour relationship and your career and\nthis and and i it's shocking to me how\nmuch we have in common despite being\nvery different people\nso when you talked about switching and i\nwant to talk about that more for me when\ni left being a monk\nand which i lived as for three years as\na fully ordained monk most of it in\nindia\nand living a very different life to the\nlife i live today when i first left i\nhad so much shame and guilt about how i\nwanted to share what i'd learned\nbecause i wanted to share it in a\nnon-sectarian and a universal way and i\nwanted to share it with anyone and\neveryone without anyone feeling any\npressure that they had to have a\nspiritual or religious belief to connect\nwith my work\nand and that came with certain levels of\nof criticism or\nor judgment too because it's like well\nwait a minute you are a fully ordained\nmonk who has studied these five thousand\nyear old literatures and scriptures and\ntexts but wait a minute you're not\nsharing those\nlike like how does that fit and i know\nit's different but there's there's that\nsimilarity i wonder how did you\nhow did you get over that shame because\ni feel like that can be so restricting\nand i even know people in my own\ncommunity who would who would feel\nrestricted by their judgment\nhow we how did you receive then how did\nyou have the confidence again to break\nthrough that and say well this is still\nsomething i really want to do despite\nall of this\nyeah i mean that is so interesting that\nyou drew that comparison because yeah\ntick tock is about as far away from\nbeing a monk as you can get literally\nit's so interesting to me that\ni mean what a perfect example\nyou are of of a huge pivot but still\nit's all connected and it's all\nleading to the next thing\nuh\nanyway to your question i\nhow did i get past all of that\ni have a lot of therapy i suppose i mean\nwhen we were talking about you can\nalways go back\nto what you were doing before\ni think what you said was so great i\nmean yeah i do think people see it as\ngiving up but actually it's it's really\nconfidence yes it's\nyou saying i'm confident enough that if\nthis doesn't work out i'll make it work\nyes and if that means doing what i was\ndoing before that's fine i have i have a\ngood friend delaney fisher who i used to\ndo self-helpless with she\nsaid to me\nwhen i was i think moving in with\nsomebody she she had given a few of our\nfriends this advice where she was like\nyou can always\nmove out like you can always it's okay\nif things don't work out\nand i think we've we totally forget\nabout that\nas far as moving past\nthe shame of it i will say\nthere is no like i can always go back to\nthe church\nmarket like that was not yeah something\ni ever felt\num because\nthat's a decision you make and\ni felt very good about that decision\nbut\nthat is a small pool of comedians who\ncan do that\nand it is\nin some ways easier to achieve a certain\nlevel of financial success in that area\nthere's a ceiling on it because\nyou know it's a it's a certain community\nbut\ni just knew\nthat\ni wanted to talk about more difficult\nsubjects\nand yeah i wanted to do jokes about sex\nlike i wanted to talk about whatever i\nwanted to talk about\nand\nthe the expectations are so rigid\nin\nin\nchurch comedy\nin in any sort of\nchurch situation because\nthey just want you to be\nwhat they expect you to be all the time\nit's not enough to just come in and be a\nclean comedian for an hour\nthey want you to\nbe a christian all the time they want\nyou to be\na role model and a perfect public figure\nand\ni would open for people and they would\nget emails from someone going well i saw\nher do a set somewhere and she said damn\nand i was like i cannot stay here this\nis not sustainable even if i try to be\nperfect i'm gonna slip up yeah and i\ndon't wanna feel like this the rest of\nmy life and i wasn't sure\nthat i believed\nin christianity i just didn't i had felt\nthat way since i was a kid my mom passed\naway when i was eight and as soon as she\ndid something kind of shifted in me\nwhere i realized\nnobody knew for sure\nmy family's very religious and\na lot of people i grew up around\nand i love my family i have very\nopen-minded\nextended family but a lot of people i\ngrew up around\nact as if they know for sure\nwhat happens what the answers are as far\nas religion goes\nand i just realized like oh nobody\nreally knows and\nwhile i feel very open to the\npossibility of something else something\ngreater i\ni know that even if i devote my entire\nlife to it i will never figure out\nexactly what it is for sure and so that\nalways rubbed me the wrong way and i\ndidn't like the way that it can be used\nto\njudge and manipulate people and i just i\njust wasn't what they wanted and i\nstarted to feel like i was lying to\nanybody who hired me in that space so at\na certain point i\ni got taken off of a show for something\ni tweeted\nthat had like innuendo in it\nand\ni just told my manager i was like if we\nget any offers for churches i can't do\nit and then they sent me a few more like\nit's this much money do you want to do\nit and i was like i can't it's it's all\nor nothing yeah with them and that's\nfine they can they can\nmake those\nthose demands for whoever they want\nthose people exist those people\nabsolutely exist\num my friend dustin nickerson who goes\non the road with me is\nvery clean and\ncan perform literally anywhere and\nthat's who should be doing\nyou know\ncertain gigs that i'm not right for i\nmean you don't you don't have to be\nright for\nfor every single\nthing and\nit's okay if you're not right um\nfor for a certain role yeah\ndefinitely i i think that's great advice\nand it gives you such a again freedom to\nrecognize there is an audience for what\nyou want to do it does exist it may be\nsmaller it may be larger it may be\ndifferent it may be here but but there\nis one you touched on there and you\nmentioned it earlier obviously like\nlosing your mother at eight years old\nand i\nyou know i can't begin to imagine or\nunderstand what that feels like as an\nexperience\nyou said that that was one of the things\nthat opened up\nwas what else was there that that\nopened up for you it sounds like you've\nspent a long time with therapy and\nreflection and being on a journey with\nthat what would you feel comfortable\nsharing with us that that opened up for\nyou oh i mean i talk about it a lot in\nthe news special it's\nit is such a\nit's it's the most important\nthing that happened to me you know not\nthe best thing that ever happened to me\nbut it's\nif anything's the worst thing that ever\nhappened to me and\nit's\nit's hard to\ni don't know who i would have been if\nthat didn't happen like i i don't think\ni would have been the same person\ni mean i have\ni had a conversation with my therapist\nthe other day where i was like\nit's so funny because my aunt or my\nmy grandma will say things like your mom\nwould have thought this was so cool your\nmom would have been like in the front\nrow and i go i don't know that i'd be\ndoing this\nif mom was still here like would i have\ni certainly wouldn't have lived where i\nlived because my dad got remarried and\nthat's why we lived there and that's why\ni took that class is because we were in\nthat area where that woman suggested it\nso\nwho knows maybe i would have found it\nbut\nalso maybe i would have written\nchildren's books which is what i wanted\nto do when i was younger so\ni i i don't know it's it's so\nstrange to be sad yeah that a parent\nisn't here to see your success but also\nknow that\na big reason you're successful is this\ndrive\nto\nbecome somebody they would have been\nproud of or like it's weird i'm like\nchasing the approval of a ghost in a way\nbut then when you achieve those things\nyou're there's there's a sadness to all\nof it because you go oh this is this\ndoesn't really fill\nthat that hole i guess uh\nbut i do think it it certainly\nit made a lot of things\nmuch more difficult and i'm sure it\nmade me\nshire and i'm sure it\nmade me very made me very very anxious\nand it burst that bubble a lot of kids\nhave\nmaybe not kids now because they live\nthrough a pandemic but a lot of kids\nhave where you think you're invincible\nand nothing bad is going to happen to\nyou\nand when something like that happens to\nyou really young you're like oh okay\nyeah so\nat any moment the piano could fall in my\nhead\num or someone else's head that i love\nyeah so that's sort of when i like\nstarted having really bad nightmares\nwhich i still have and\nit uh it it definitely\naffected me in so many ways but the\npositive ways it affected me is i think\nit made me\ni think it made me more empathetic i\nthink it\nmade me a hard worker i think\nwhen something\ntragic happens to you as a child you\nsort of retreat into your imagination\nbecause you have to\nwhich i'm sure made me more creative\nbecause living in my head was better\nthan living out in the world where my\nmom was dead\nuh\nso yeah i think i think as i've gotten\nolder\ni've learned to find the positive\naspects of\nthat loss\nthat exists alongside the really\ndifficult things about it\nthank you so much for sharing that by\nthe way yeah you know i find it so\nit's so incredible to\nhear just the journey you've been on and\nand from that experience and just and\nit's and to me it's not about\nyou know the positive or the negative or\nhow it feels it's just interesting to\nhear you\nthink about it openly\nand and i can hear just\nhow much how much work that's taken and\nand what that process looks like and i\nreally appreciate you sharing that with\nus like genuinely it's it's so inspiring\nand it's\nhope giving and i know that you know\nthere'll be countless people are\nlistening right now who\nwho just feels so connected to that so\nthank you so much for for going there\nand sharing that oh thank you yeah\nyeah i\nthink when i was growing up it was so\nhard to tell other people but again it\nfeels like such an important thing to\nknow\nabout you but i it made other people\nuncomfortable who hadn't experienced\ndeath or loss\nso then you're like do i just tell them\nmy parents are separated do i just kind\nof skirt around the issue\nand i\nit took years of like almost like\nrehearsing with new people\nhow to how to give them that information\nin a in a palatable way yeah exactly no\nit's such an\nimportant part of the story to\nunderstand someone yeah and to be able\nto receive them and connect with them\nproperly uh\nno i'm so grateful you spoke about it\nand i wanna i wanna go in another\ntotally very different direction now but\nonly because\nyou said something earlier i'm trying to\nbring it back so\nwe're talking about love and\nrelationships and and\neven that relationship with your mother\nand with your parents is so important in\nhow it impacts your relationships moving\nforward\none of your favorite clips that i love\nis\nwhere you talk about\num i believe it's the boyfriend who\ncheated on you\nin your head\nand that clip to me i've i've sent that\nclip to more people than i could\npossibly imagine\nand i have a funny story to tell that i\ndon't think i've ever shared publicly\nbut i have to share it with you so\ni've had a very clear\nvalue\naround cheating my whole life\nthat if someone wants to cheat on me\nor if i was to chew on someone i don't\nthink i'm personally it's not that i\ndon't believe i'm capable i don't feel\nenthusiastic about trying to continue on\nthat path because to me it's such a big\ncore value of who i am\nagain i don't project down to anyone i\nwouldn't judge anyone for staying with\nsomeone or breaking up it's everyone's\npersonal choice that's that's where my\npersonal choice stands and my wife knows\nthat and we've had this conversation\nwe've been together now nearly 10 years\nand married for six and so we've we've\nknown this for a long time\nand so\nme and my wife do this thing what we\nused to do before the pandemic we\nhaven't done it since but we used to do\nthis thing with every 30 days we would\ndrive somewhere three hours from where\nwe live\nand stay somewhere like an airbnb or\nwherever we can for three days we'd lock\nour phones in a safe and we just spend\ntime together because we found that\nevery week we got so busy and i have a\ncrazy schedule and so does she and so\nlike on a week night it's like you're\nnot really getting that deep intimate\nconnection and then the weekend comes\nand maybe you see friends and maybe you\nsee family or whatever and time just\nflies and then all of a sudden you've\nbeen married for 10 years or longer and\nyou're like well do i even know this\nperson that well and i saw that in the\npeople i coached i saw that in the\npeople i worked with and i was like okay\nwell what's a habit or what's it i love\ncoming up with like these and i love\nnumbers and so it's like 30 days three\nhours three days and so we're on this\none of these journeys and we're driving\noff three hours and we listen to music\nand this may surprise people but we're\nlistening to future the rapper right\nit's me and my wife sitting listening to\nmusic we listen to future the rapper for\nwhatever reason i have no idea uh i do\nnot know him i've never met him\nreleasing a future on the way\nwe get to the hotel uh that we're\nstaying at and then we maybe watched a\nmovie and went to bed and\ni i wake up in the morning\nand i've had this dream\nthat my wife is having futures baby\nand she's in the shower i can hear her\nthat she's in the shower in the hotel\nroom\nand\ni wake up and it feels real\nso i wake up and there's no part of me\nthat\nis cognizant that that was a dream i am\nfully in the reality\nthat my wife rather this this you know\nbeautiful abundant human being has\nhad an affair with future of all people\nand now she's pregnant with futures baby\nand i woke up with like this\nbrick on my heart like that's how it\nfelt like it genuinely felt like there\nwas this massive brick on my heart and\nit was weighing me down and in my head i\nsaid\ni want to take care of that baby like\nit's mine like i was just like i just\nhave to like i was just like i love my\nwife so much like i love and it was so\nweird because i had this value yeah and\nthen when you think that these things\nhappen all of a sudden that not that\nvalue's gone out the window but that\nyou my love and my connection and\nattachment to my wife was stronger\nand she she was the hotel room had one\nof those like you know those window\ndoors that open into the from the shower\nbathroom into like the the bedroom area\nyeah so she opened she looked to me she\nwas like are you okay\ni was like oh i just had a dream that\nyou were having futures baby and she\njust burst out laughing at me like she\nwas just cracking up and i've never told\nthat story anywhere else apart from now\napart from to friends and stuff but it's\nit's fascinating to me\nhow interesting it is that we can have\nthese views on love we can have these\nperceptions of love and then when you\nget into a relationship how these\nperceptions can change uh how other\npeople's music thoughts ideas infiltrate\nour mind\nuh and and and dreams and messages and\nall of that i wonder for you\nwhat have been some of the\nwould you say misconceptions on love\nthat you think you had growing up that\nhad been broken down or that through\nyour comedy that you've learned or maybe\nyou've heard an amazing story from a fan\nat an event that has sparked some\nthoughts but i'm always fascinated by\nthings that we believe to be true about\nlove\nbut as we grow older we go oh they're\nnot they're not the truth does that make\nsense yeah absolutely um it's so funny\nyou say that i have a friend who's been\nin a relationship for i believe seven\nyears now and is like my oldest friend\nand i had i had asked her a similar\nquestion\ni don't remember when but i had asked\nher you know what would you do if your\npartner cheated on you and she was like\nhonestly at this point\ni\nlove him so much i trust him so much i\nwould\nprobably go to therapy and figure out\nwhy it happened yeah and i was like oh\nbut you wouldn't just leave and she was\nlike no she's like not at this point\nlike we've just been through so much\ntogether i would there she's like i know\nhim so well if he did that i would know\nthere was a reason yes and we would need\nto figure out that reason that's\nbeautiful oh my gosh and i was like\noh okay so we're all mature now like i\nthink i thought\nwell my friends in this relationship\nthat relationship they don't fight or\nthis would never happen in so-and-so's\nrelationship and then as i've gotten\nolder and i've dated more people i've\ni've\nspoken to friends of mine and said like\nwell this happened and they go oh we we\ndealt with that yeah like we had the\nsame thing or my partner did something\nlike that or i did something like that\nand it took a while for us to unlearn it\nand get through it and\nthat's i think the hardest thing about\ndating\nin your 20s and honestly into your 30s\nnow as people are getting married later\nit it's so hard to know\nwhat is like a deal breaker yes and what\nis\nsomething that you can work through and\nit i think the thing i've learned from\nfriends of mine and and\ntruly talking to audience members\nbecause i do ask people who have been\nmarried a long time for advice and most\nof the time they're like we don't have\nany move on yeah uh we just didn't leave\nyeah\nbut\nso many people it just seems like\nfind somebody that they love so much\nthey're like well i'm gonna make it work\nwith you yes and whatever\nthings i had in my brain of\nif this happens i'm gone if this happens\ni'll never get over it\nonce you find somebody that you love and\nrespect so much and you've been through\nenough with them\nif you trust somebody\nand i feel this way with friends of mine\ni should say that because i i don't have\nthat marriage or partnership that i can\npoint to in my own life but i have\nseveral friends who i've had for a very\nlong time who are there for me so\nconsistently\nthat when they hurt me or disappoint me\nit is over very quickly\nbecause\ni'm like your family and you have been\nthere for me\nso many times\nhurting me once is not gonna phase me\nwhereas if somebody that i didn't trust\nas much or hadn't been there for me\nfor as long or as deeply\ndid the exact same thing\nwe would not have a relationship anymore\nwe would be acquaintances now\nso it is so dependent on the\nrelationship you have with the other\nperson yeah yeah yeah definitely and\nthat's what i mean that\nfor me it just you know it ultimately\nit's\nknowing your value but then having\ncompassion for other people's values\nbecause i think it's so easy to project\nyour\nown ideas of what someone should do and\nhow they should react and yeah\nwhat's a good boundary for themselves\nand then almost going well wait a minute\nlike\njust gotta have compassion and empathy\nfor that person's decision and their\nrelationship with that person\nwhen you look for i'm interested by by\ndating in relationships a lot myself\nbecause it's it's a part of my work it's\npart of my coaching as you know it's\npart of what i think about what what\nhave been the the funniest most\ninteresting date situations you've been\nin or ones that have given you hope or\nones that have broken your hope or\nanything that you feel to share well\nit's so funny you bring up that joke\nfrom quarter life because i love that\nlike it's so funny because in the news\nspecial i i have a joke about an ex\ncheating on me and it's that that guy\nthat i talk about where i go well he\nnever cheated on i say i do that joke\nwhere i say he cheated on me in my head\ni go no he never cheated on me but he\ndid this thing that guy did cheat on me\nand he told me after i filmed that\nspecial\nyes he finally told me and it was like\nobviously years later but like he and i\nhad dated on and off for years and he\nhad sworn up and down that he never\ncheated on me and really made me feel\ncrazy and to his credit apologized\nvery late but really like\nsent me this long apology where i was\nlike i was gaslighting you like\nreally a beautiful i almost made it my\niphone background\nit's all you want is just i was wrong\nand i guess lighted you and you're like\nyes yeah send it out as a template for\neveryone to use but also really messed\nwith my head because i'd been in therapy\ngoing you know i always was so\nsuspicious of this guy and he never did\nanything and i just created it in my\nhead so for them later for him later to\nbe like no i was and you were right and\ni'm sorry\ni just pay for my therapy bill for the\nlivestream i know right but also i got\nso many jokes out of that relationship i\nreally can't i really can't be mad it's\npaying the bills it really is fantastic\ni have no regrets but after he you know\nwhat's funny in terms of like i thought\nthat if somebody cheated on me i would\nhate them and never speak to them again\nand especially in that way which is\npretty messed up um\nbut there's obviously\nmore to the story circumstantially that\ncontextualized it for me um but if you\nhad just told me 10 years ago like this\nis what's gonna happen\nwith this person\ni would have been like well i'm gonna\nhate them forever\nand once he told me that that's what\nhappened\nand i i did know him so well and i knew\nwhat he was going through and what he\nwas dealing with\num\ni think it actually\nimproved\nnot our relationship because we don't\nreally have a relationship but\nimproved our\nfeelings about each other yeah\nin a in a\nyou know just just an existing in the\nworld as memories to one another like i\nwasn't angry at him anymore\nbecause i\nfinally knew for sure\nand it does take a lot to\nadmit to somebody that yeah\nyeah and and\nyou can judge however\nlong it took or the way in which it was\nsaid or\nwhatever you want but at the end of the\nday i was like you know what this is\nsomebody who is really important to me\nand really encouraged me in my career\nand and really\nyes hurt me in some pretty deep ways but\nalso made me better yeah\nand\ni\ni felt like i was able to sort of\nput that chapter of my life to bed and\nreally care about him as a human being\num and i had just lived longer and i had\nmade my own mistakes and other\nrelationships and obviously i made my\nown really my own mistakes in that\nrelationship with him um that we're not\nokay so i think\ntime age\ncompassion and empathy comes with all of\nthat do you i had this really strange\nvision while you were saying all this\ndeep profound stuff i was like how\namazing would it be to see you making\nthis joke next to this clip of you\ntalking right now and i'm just like\nliterally i'm like taylor like you're\nthis mature amazing individual and then\nwhen i see you on stage you're like this\nyou know you're like\npicking fights with everyone\ni love it and i love that and i love\nthat i love that paradox too like i i\nlove that you're able to\nspeak so lightly of so many of these\nthings and of course you know make so\nmany millions of people laugh but at the\nsame time when i'm getting to know you\ntoday\nit's it's fascinating to hear just\nhow much thought and maturity and work\nand and reflection because what you just\nsaid is is so massively\nuh evolved i mean look i wouldn't have\nraised futures baby\ni'm like you're okay over there\nliterally that was like the only thing i\nsaid oh my god like i literally felt\nthat like it was i felt it in my gut\nbecause\nyeah because i was asking my wife's baby\ni love it so much it was just yeah it\nwas just one of those moments but i'm\nglad it's not true of course yeah did\nyou see the video on tick tock that went\nviral about that girl being walked down\nthe aisle by her stepdad\nit was the exact same thing she was like\nmy mom had an affair\nand got pregnant with me and my stepdad\nraised me and he is my dad\nand this is him walking me down the\naisle yeah i know what you're doing yeah\noh he's just yeah and then that's the\nkind of\nthat's the real life version right you\ncan have all these ideas and thoughts in\nyour head and make all these commitments\nto yourself and then it happens and then\nyeah yeah you you change no i love that\ni i think\nif if if taylor thompson had any dating\nrelationship advice\nmistakes\nthoughts what would they be right now oh\nmy advice is to not listen to stand-up\ncomedians for relationship advice\nuh my advice is to listen to your\npodcast\nuh and follow whatever you and your wife\nare doing\num\ni don't know i'm currently in this\nplace in my life where i'm\nsort of coming to and i'd like to talk\nabout this on stage in the the new hour\ni'm i'm working on is\num i have\ni have been in sort of like back-to-back\nrelationships um throughout my\nentire adult life in a way that i don't\nthink is particularly healthy\nuh and i have had friends i have a new\njoke in the hour about um\nyou know a lot of my friends were like\nyou should maybe be single for a bit and\nmaybe get a cat or something and i was\nlike hard pass cats don't make me feel\ngood about myself\nbut i am\ni am reaching a point now where i'm like\nokay we've put off doing this work\non being alone yeah for a long time yeah\nand i think you need to do it now yeah\nand it is so difficult because i\ni'm i'm not\ni'm not a casual\nperson i'm much like you where if i'm at\nan event i want to talk to one person\nuh so i'm not like that in any of my\nrelationships friendships or otherwise\nso\ni'm generally in a relationship if i'm\ndating i'm not like a casual dater i\ndon't have that in me\nbut\nas a result i'm\nalways getting into these you know\nyear to two-year things yeah um\nand i i'm\ni've also just been so focused on my\ncareer so anytime\nsomething\nwasn't working out or or\ni was having problems with somebody i\nwas like well i can always focus on my\ncareer and that's fine and\nfocus on the next relationship and and\nnow\ni've reached this level that i\ntruly always dreamed of like doing a\ntheater tour\nand having specials on netflix\nthat is all i have ever wanted and if\nnothing else happened from here on out\nthat is this is more than i could have\never dreamed of\nand so now i'm like maybe it's time to\nget some hobbies\nmaybe it's time\nmaybe it's time to work on who you are\nas a person like you're very good at\ncomedy maybe get good at i don't know\nforgiveness\nlike\nmaybe just work on that so yeah i think\ni love that\nyou know what's that quote that people\nsay like you have to be somebody that\nyou would want to be with forever like i\ndo think that i have had moments of that\nover the years but i'd like to really\ni'd like to really focus on that and i i\ni don't agree with\nthe statement a lot of people make which\nis you have to be totally okay by\nyourself before you get into\nrelationship i know so many people yeah\nwho got into a relationship\nthree days after they ended one and\nthey've been together for 10 years i\nknow so many people who got into a\nrelationship when they were really not\nin a good place financially spiritually\nwhatever and now they've been together\nfor 20 years i think\nit is so\ncase by case but i do think\nthat if\nyou can show up for yourself and take\ncare of yourself\nyou are going to\nshow up for and take care of someone\nelse yes much better and not\nput so much on them to take care of you\nand\ni i would like to\ni think before i get into a relationship\nagain which i don't know when i'm going\nto be\ncomfortable doing that\ni would like to\nfeel like i am someone who\nbrings a lot to the table\ni love that not just in a\npurely superficial way of like look how\nmuch i've achieved like my career is\ngoing well which for a long time i think\non some unconscious level i thought that\nif i\nachieved all of my\ncareer goals yeah i would\nbe proving\nto\nsomeone whoever it was that i was like\nworth loving like i was worth being with\nyes and then you achieve all those\nthings and you reach that place and\nyou're like oh this didn't this didn't\ndo it yeah that's not what it's about\nso\ni uh i i'm really trying to\nfocus on\nthat right now i'm trying to\nfocus on who i am as opposed to what\ni've done\nbecause that has not been my approach\nthe last 10 years to my life and and to\ngo back to my mom dying young i mean i\ntalk about that in the special as well\nas like i had this irrational belief\nthat i was going to die at 34 because\nthat's when she died\nand it's very common a lot of people\nhave it when they lose their parents\neven if their parents are you know 55\nwhen they when they pass they get\nnervous coming up to that age and then\nif you that's real i've heard if you\nget to that age and you surpass it you\nyou actually\nfeel sort of guilty of like survivor\nskill so i have that to look forward to\nbut i think\nthat was not just affecting my\ncareer goals it was affecting my\npersonal goals as well where i thought\ni only have this amount of time\nnot even from a fertility standpoint\nfrom just a this is when i'm going to\ndie yeah\nthat i have to rush everything and i\nhave to\num\nbecome this ideal person and uh that's\nnot how you become your highest self as\nit turns out yeah i i mean\nyou know when you said that i'm like\nlistening to you today going i think i\nthink taylor you you\nreally do know who you are and there's\nthere's so much\nyou know there has been so much\ninvestment in that part of yourself yes\nthere's been of course amazing\nacceleration in your career but from the\nlittle time we've spent together today\ni'm i'm i'm hearing so much\nself-awareness and you know so much\ngreat introspection and\nso much amazing energy around that so\nthank you i'm sorry if i'm rambling no\nyou're not this is beautiful\nno no no you're not rambling at all i\nmean i'm also reflecting back on what\nyou just said and it gives me great\nreassurance in hearing that because\nsomething i ask a lot of clients to do\nin the relationship space is i ask them\nto\nwrite down the amount of days in their\nadult life or years in their adult life\nthat they've spent single versus they've\nspent in relationships and when you look\nat those two numbers next to each other\ni know people that are 55\nwho will say that the amount of time\nthey've spent in their adult life of\ncourse because we all no one's dating\nwhen they're born right well maybe not\nright\ni'm like yeah\nbut the idea that in their adult life\neven people who are 55 60 years 55 is\nprobably where people that i've spoken\nto\nthey would say that they've spent six\nmonths alone max in their whole adult\nlife yeah\nas in single without being in some sort\nof relationship and when you hear that\nand when i started to think about it for\nme those three years living as a monk\nof being single of course but i look\nback at those and i think wow those were\nlike really important\nformative years in my relationship with\nmyself and i fully agree with you too\nthat\nthat never stops or is never complete so\nit's not like check did that now i'm\nready for a relationship i have\ncompleted level one of life but i've\nstarted level one of life yeah and i\nthink that's you know going back to your\npoint that you're not going to fully\nlove yourself and be good alone\nbefore you can be in a relationship but\nyou've started that journey to some\ndegree and ultimately all that does is\nit removes certain obstacles\nright so someone could definitely go\nfrom one relationship to another and\nthey could be together it's just we\nwould remove certain obstacles if both\npeople had had done a little bit of\nself-work\nand that's all that's all it is but it's\nnever that yes you come to a\nrelationship as this perfectly complete\nperson that is just a romantic view of\nwhat it looks like and and i saw that\nwith me and my wife like\nyou know when when we met and we fell in\nlove as well and you know falling in\nlove is not a logical\nuh\nyou're not planning it all out and\nyou're not logically going through the\nsteps there's attraction and then\nthere's affection and then all of a\nsudden there's attachment and you're\nlike okay i think i love this person and\nthen now i'm like wow i think sometimes\nwhen i propose to my wife i didn't even\nreally know her compared to\nthe person i know today i'm like i\ndidn't know her and and i think the\nproblem becomes when we think we know\nbefore and then we stop trying to know\nand so you kind of go yeah i know who my\npartner is we got married and then it's\nlike but i've never tried to get to know\nthem again\nand for me it's been the other way\naround we're like yeah we dated and we\nwere together for four years before we\ngot married to plenty of time but i'd\nsay i've learned more in the last six of\nbeing married than i ever did in the\nfirst four so the knowing of that person\nwas far more important than the belief\nthat i already knew them if that makes\nsense and you're both changing all the\ntime all the time that's the thing when\npeople are like well they're not who i\nmarried it's like of course not of\ncourse not yeah of course not you're not\nwho they marry right like you like me\ntalking like i know\ni'm like\nmarriage is like this\nuh\nyeah i i think that\ni i it's\nit's interesting what you said about the\ntime that people spend actually alone as\nadults because i've i've\nspoken to friends of mine who have\ngotten out of really long relationships\nlike that's such a that's such a common\nthing that i've never experienced where\nyou know somebody was with somebody for\nthe bulk of their young adulthood like\nmaybe someone was with someone for eight\nyears in their 20s and then they break\nup which seems so devastating yeah\nbecause i've never been in something\nthat long that ended um\nor you know people get divorced after\nhowever many years and\nand\nthose friends realizing like oh i didn't\ni never lived alone like i've never\nlived alone\nand i'm\nin my 30s now and i'm sort of in a\nsimilar place where i'm kind of like\nsurprised\nhow much i'm appreciating it yeah right\nnow like i'm really\ni'm i'm really like every night i'm like\noh i can just do\nwhatever i want and i love being in a\nrelationship i love being in a\nrelationship i\nlove\nthe the people i've been in\nrelationships with i love hanging out\nwith someone i i love having that person\nto talk to and share with and because\nyou really do just become best friends\nwith that person yes but\ni have spent very little time\njust\nwith myself\nand i i really\nhave spent years like dreading it where\ni'm like i don't i can't imagine just\ncoming home at night or going back to\nthe hotel after shows because that's\nvery lonely and just like being by\nmyself and not having someone to call\nnot having someone to watch a movie with\nand\nnow i'm like oh this is actually kind of\npeaceful like i i was so scared to not\nhave someone else to count on but i\nstill have made a counter yeah yeah yeah\nyeah\nand and when we don't have that those\nare the triggers that come out i mean\neven in marriage like right now i won't\nhave seen my wife for the first four\nmonths of this year she's in london\nworking on stuff i'm in la uh she can't\nbe in\nla right now for the work she's doing\nand i can't be in london and so i'd say\nin our marriage we've spent\nprobably before pandemic we spent\ncompletely together which was wonderful\nwe loved it it was actually great for us\nbut before that i would say that we've\nspent at least\nthree to six months apart a year because\nof work on and off not always in one go\nthis time it's been in one go and i miss\nher i cannot wait for her to come back\nlike i feel like i have to throw her a\nparty when she comes back because i miss\nher so much but at the same time i'm\nalso really happy because she's been\nable to focus and i've been able to\nfocus and we've had this moment to like\nreally go all in on our careers again\nand then to come back again and be\ntogether and go all in on that and it's\njust i think it's so healthy because\nmarriage will also demand separation\nespecially with careers that we have\nwhere you could be on tour again and you\nknow or and you're in a relationship and\nso that aspect of coming home alone is\nsuch a hell even now like i've i mean we\nwere together every day for two years\nduring the pandemic and now we've been\napart for four months\nit took days to get used to the fact\nthat i didn't have someone's head on my\nchest going to sleep like just that\nprocess of like wow like eve i was like\nwell i need to get a weighted blanket or\ni need to like put that brick back on my\nheart or something like to feel like\nthat weight like\nfuture yeah yeah exactly yeah because it\nwas just not it was it was so strange\nbecause of habit of course and the the\nhabit with that but you raised something\nreally interesting and and i've actually\nnot had the fortune yet to go on tour i\ndo a lot of events\nuh speaking but i haven't been able to\ngo on tour because i was meant to when\nmy book came out in 2020 and then i\ndidn't\nand but i do remember starkly and i and\ni work with a lot of musicians and\nartists who perform to many many people\non stage and they always told me about\nthat lonely journey home and i've had\nvery few experiences of it but when i\nhave it really did hit me that when you\nhave an audience of people that are\nfully immersed in everything you're\nsaying and showing you so much love and\nshowing you so much energy and you you\ndropped every joke right and everything\nfell and everyone's just in place and\nyou have this meet and greet and\neveryone just showers you with more love\nand tells you how much they connected\nand then you get into that car ride back\nhome alone\nit's a really really strange feeling\nright and you brought it up then that's\nwhy\ni remember that\nand i remember i got home and my wife\nhad thrown me a party with all our\nclosest friends as a surprise for when i\ngot home and i didn't even know\nbut it was really fascinating i remember\nthat drive i was at the ace i performed\nat the ace which was the only show i've\never done which is my own show and then\nwhen i drove home alone in in just a\nhired car\nit was really interesting to see that\nsettle down and be happy with myself in\nthat moment\ntell walk us through how it's felt for\nyou because i do think that when we live\nin a world where you're showered with\nvalidation and attention\nto then leave it well hopefully\nhopefully yeah yeah hopefully but when\nyou're showered with that genuine love\nfrom a lot i i know that my community i\nfeel so much genuine love from them but\nwhen you go home you've got to have that\nrelationship with yourself can you just\nwalk us through that a bit i want to\nhear about it from your thoughts oh man\ni mean and are in terms of like being on\nthe road and going back to a hotel\ni feel like that is such a unique\nexperience\nbecause not everyone performs on stage\nand not everyone it's like going home\nfrom a party is one thing but going home\nfrom a party that was\nyou on stage and everyone right it's\nlike it's just really interesting i'm\nalways fascinated by hearing about that\nlonely journey for artists on the way\nhome yeah there is sort of like a\nphysical\nat least for me i feel like there's a\nheavy\nsort of like\nyeah after i get off stage\nand now on this\nyou know this tour i'm usually doing\nlike a meet and greet afterwards\nand so that's sort of like\na little extension of the show is how it\nfeels because you're you are meeting\npeople face to face and\nuh taking pictures and sometimes hearing\nvery personal things from them i guess\nit depends because some days are are\nvery hectic where you're just traveling\nall day\nand then you have to go on stage and\nyou're kind of like just frantic this\nthis frantic energy all day and so when\nyou hit like 10 p.m and you're back in a\ncar in a hotel room\nit's\nso nice to just finally be still and\nquiet and\nnot have anybody looking at you you're\nlike oh everyone was looking at me for a\nlong time i mean i have really\nstrange moments\nwhere i almost feel like i'm like\noutside of my body on stage where\nsometimes i'm like\ni'm\neveryone there's 1500 people here\njust sitting yeah quietly yeah\nlooking at me yeah while i talk like do\nyou have that ever before you're just\nand you're just in sort of you kind of\ngo into\nalmost like autopilot yeah while you\njust sort of watch your hands move yeah\nand gesture to ideas you have\nand it's it's so cr i'm so incredibly\ngrateful for it i can't imagine\ni i couldn't have imagined\nthat\ni i don't know i'm\nobviously at a loss for words but\nit's such a strange\nfeeling to\nhave all of that love and validation\ncoming at you as you said\nand then\njust be back to being you\nyeah\nbecause that's a version of you yeah but\nit's not\nit's not that it's not you like when\npeople say like well that's not who you\nreally are that's not i'm like no that\nis who i really am but it's a piece of\nme\nso well said yeah yeah it's a it's a\nmode i go into yes so it's not that like\nwell they like me but i in my in my\ndarker moments i've talked about this in\ntherapy i go\nsometimes i feel like people only like\nme for this like trick i can do and she\ngoes but it's not really a trick it's a\nskill you have yeah it's a it's a job\nyou do\nand so that makes me feel better but\nsometimes i feel so like\nyou know because nobody knows you really\nyeah like they think they know you\nespecially like doing a podcast like\nthis i'm sure\nyour listeners feel like they just know\nwho you are yeah but\nnobody actually does i mean\nit it's it's a strange\nlonely\nspace that's hard to explain yeah to\npeople no i i thought that was a good\nexplanation and yeah i think i studied i\nwas i was looking into this i was like\nbecause i was i i love\nbuilding new friendships and new\nconnections and deepening relationships\nand and i really enjoyed that as and\neven as i get older because i find that\na lot of the friends i grew up with life\nchanges and you move on and i've moved\ncity twice i lived in new york i now\nlive in l.a i lived in india for a time\nso my life's been very fragmented and so\ni've had to rebuild community and family\nwherever i've landed\nand so i really value that as a as\nsomething i try and invest in especially\nwhen i think about\none day having children and wanting them\nto have other children to play with and\npeople's homes to go to and things like\nthat i think there's an issue when you\nsay\nthis is me\nor this isn't me\nso it's like when you say this person on\nstage or this person who plays on the\nfield or on the court that's me that's\nme that's all of me\nor the opposite where we go that's not\nthe real me this is the real me when i'm\non my couch and i'm in sweats and\nand and you put it perfectly you said no\nboth of me and that's just reality like\nif i'm am i silly and goofy with radhi\nmy wife yeah i am but i i also really\nthoughtful and intentional and focused\nin my meditation yes i am and do i love\nbeing on stage yes i do\nuh do i love business and strategy and\ngrowth yes do i love being a monk and\nbeing really simple and minimalist yes i\nlove all of those things and yes they're\nparadoxes and oxymorons and\ncontradictions but i've learned as\ntime's gone on\nto stop trying to force myself to choose\none and accept all parts of myself\nand that has been the most freeing the\nmost authentic version i can find when\ni'm not forcing myself to live one truth\nand accept that i'm just made of a bunch\nof them and and that's okay like i don't\nhave to live a certain way or act a\ncertain way to fall because i don't feel\nhappy there if i was forced to either\nbe one or the other i think i'd be\nreally sad and i consider myself to be\nquite a joyful content individual and i\nwould say that's because i've allowed\nmyself to be okay with the paradoxes\nwithin me yeah if that makes sense and\neven with you like when i'm listening to\nyou i'm going there's there's a paradox\nright here where it's like\na lot of people talk about how stand-up\ncomedians use you know use comedy to\nheal and cope and and deal with things i\nthink that's been like a long-term myth\nthat kind of gets thrown around probably\na bit too much without ever asking\npeople in the industry\nand and then when i look at you i'm like\nbut here's someone who's doing like\ntherapy and work behind the scenes and\nlike thinking about it and then the\ncomedy is more\nexpressed through that learning as well\nand all of that with that how do you\nfind that because you mentioned earlier\nobviously in the newspaper you speak\nabout bipolar and you speak about mental\nhealth a lot more in your work\nyou but you've been doing mental health\nwork so i'm so at least and i don't want\nto assume anything i'm asking\nit sounds like comedy to you is not an\noutlet or a healing tool or a\nor um expressive to i guess it's more of\nan expression tool than it is a healing\ntool yeah does that feel yeah sorry if\ni'm messing up the question but no no\nnot at all i think\nwhat's funny is i think maybe i used to\nthink it was a healing tool\nnot in that this is where i talk about\nit but i think i thought that if i could\nmake fun of something or turn something\ninto a joke yeah\nthen that would be the same as me\ngetting over it right like that's dealt\nwith because it's a joke now like i\nturned this into\nmy career this has turned into something\nthat's going to make me money so now\nit's not a bad thing that happened to me\nit is an experience that i turned into\nsomething\nthat other people enjoy and you know i\nthink in that way i thought i was yeah\nbut\nin going to therapy consistently and\nseeing both a therapist and a\npsychiatrist and and\nrecognizing that\njust because you know something about\nyourself\ndoesn't mean you've\ndealt with it yeah completely like i was\nso upset when i figured out that\nknowing something logically\ndid not mean that it was\nhealed i was like well if i just\nuntangle it yeah yeah yeah i'll be great\nnow yeah but it's all that stuff about\ntrauma living in your body and when it's\nlike you\nyou're like but i know what this is i\nknow this is a traumatic response\nto x y and z that happened to me why am\ni still feeling the brick on my chest\nyes because it's it's more than just\nsomething you\nintellectualize it is a physical\nemotional emotional\nspiritual thing that you have to work\nthrough and spend a lot of time working\nthrough yeah not just\nfiguring it out and going awesome so\nthat's done yeah check the box yeah so i\nthink that\nespecially with this special i at first\ni wasn't going to do any jokes about\nsome of the aspects of my my mental\nhealth uh journey in the last couple\nyears and then\ni think my brain just works this way i\njust kind of think thinking jokes so as\nsoon as i started thinking of jokes i\nwas like maybe i should try these yeah\nand i was like i won't do them but i'll\ni'll try them and then once i started\ndoing jokes about it i started getting\nmessages from people who were like oh my\ngosh i just got diagnosed with this or\ni've been trying to get on\nantidepressants or or i've been feeling\nthis way or you really encouraged me to\ngo back to therapy and i was like\nokay then\nyeah we can just do it but i was really\nnervous before the special came out i\nwas like did i\nshare too much did i put too much out\nthere\nbut\nmy therapist was like you're you are\ndoing the work like yeah it's that's\nwhat i'm seeing yeah yeah so\ni think as long as you're doing the work\nit's it\nit's not gonna be fixed\nby you posting about it on social media\nor\neven talking to friends about it like\nyou're good like you are gonna have to\ndo that work\nprivately so i think\ni think that's the only way that i've\ni've been able to\ntalk about it in in my material and i\nwish i was more of like a\ni don't know just generally\nobservational comedian but i'm not i\ndraw from my own life and i write about\nstuff i'm going through because again\ni'm insecure about talking about things\ni have\nno experience with yeah um\nso that's just kind of kind of how i\ncome at it and the sort of the sort of\nwriter i am i suppose well it comes out\ngreat i love it\nand i love what you said there like like\nwhen you said i think in jokes i get\nthat because you think in jokes i think\nin quotes and it makes sense like\nwhenever i hear something like okay how\ndo i turn that into something really\nmemorable and simple that i will keep in\nmy brain that allows me to use it as a\ntool later on yeah that's kind of how i\nthink and then i think okay well how do\ni find a quote or hear a quote or share\na quote with my audience so that they\ncan remember it so that that clarifies\nan idea for them as well and so it makes\nsense because you're like okay well how\ndo i make it funny so that it's\nmemorable from a from it so that you\nremember they remember it so that feels\nvery real i get that like that's how you\ntry and\nit's almost like that's how you try and\ncapture an idea\nso that it sticks and stays and and\nbecomes something that people can share\nbut taylor you've been so generous and\nkind with your time it's been such a joy\ngetting to know you today honestly it\nreally has oh this was so nice this is\nnot like most podcasts\ni try to leave a cushion afterward to\nsort of recover okay as an introvert\nwhere you're like okay i gotta and this\nwas just like\nrefreshing and this like really just\nfelt like hanging out with someone i\nwanted to hang out with oh thank you\nlike i feel like invigorated after this\nwow that means the world to me thank you\nso much no genuinely like\nas i said i've been such a huge fan for\nsuch a long time and to get to know you\ntoday is just it's\nit's even better than i thought it was\ngoing to be because\ni feel like i already had high\nexpectations and that's what i'm saying\nthat you just\nblew through them in just who you are as\na human and how you think about things\nand how you're making this like it's\njust it's amazing and i'm so grateful\nthat you you said yes to coming on the\nshow and and being here\nwe end every on-purpose episode with a\nfinal five which is meant to be a fast\nfive which i always ruin because i get\nintrigued but i will try and do it fast\nwith you so these are five questions\nthat have to be answered in one word to\none sentence maximum okay and i will\nruin it so it's it's it's my job to ruin\nit and you pretend and try and stick to\nthat yes okay so question number one is\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nyou can always change your mind\nnice that's a that's a great piece we've\nnever had that's a great piece of advice\nyes i found a new one yeah you did yeah\nthat's that's a great i love that what's\nthe worst piece of advice you've ever\nreceived\nif you take time off everyone might\nforget about you wow that's so good too\ni love this you've never had that either\nthat's not great that's that really i\njust remember that because it really\ntapped into like the workaholic in me\nyeah that i've always yeah i've not\nalways but i've really tried to move\naway from so the idea that somebody\nwould say my worst fear out loud yeah\ndefinitely i mean when i first came here\nwhen i was first started coaching here i\nhad talent tell me that they were told\nby their first manager that you look\nyou've got a three-year career yes\nyou've got a three-year career you've\ngot to make the most of three years and\nafter that you'll be irrelevant and it's\nthe same thing like you just get you\nstop and i remember even when i i\nremember when i got to 1000 when i was\nfirst starting out 1000 subscribers on\nyoutube which i was really happy about\nexcited about at the time and and still\nam and uh i remember my friends going to\nme so this is the peak basically like\nthis is it like there'll never be more\nthan this and so you should just make\nthe most of it because that's and i\nremember like that it was that fear\nmindset that every time i hit a new peak\npeople around me would say to me oh\nthat's the peak then so that's it now\nyou've done it now and i was like wait\nonly if you think that like you know so\ngreat great answers so far all right\nquestion number three what's something\nthat you think people value that you\ndon't value\nmaybe this sounds sort of dumb but\nwhether or not people think i'm cool\nyeah i guess and that's probably pretty\nlike entertainment industry specific but\ni do think that\nthere's like a lot of like\ninsecurity in this business\nand there's a lot of\nlike hoping other people like you and\nlike i think you're cool yeah yeah and\ni don't really care about that anymore\nlike i really just want to be happy yeah\nand\nfind my people\nand focus on\nthose relationships and everyone else is\nkind of like feel however you want to\nfeel about me but i definitely used to\nbe\nvery concerned about that and it\nactually i\nthink made me far less cool and less\nlikable because i was\nreally just terrified of everybody so\nthen i would be too quiet and then\neveryone would assume i was\nmean yeah and i'm like i'm just scared\nso yeah i think i think yeah just what\nother people\nthink of you and really i just care what\nthe people i like yeah think of me yeah\nquestion number four\nuh this has been a question i've been\nasking recently because i want to help\npeople who are listening as well like\nhow do you think about\nhow you choose your friends and the\npeople around you whether it's personal\nor professional\ni want to surround myself with people\nwho work really hard\nare kind and empathetic\nand\nthat i trust\nin every way\nbut\nmostly that if we ever have a\ndisagreement or\nmiscommunication or argument we're going\nto talk about it and\ndeal with it and get through it so i\nthink that's i want i want people around\nme that\nmake me want to be a better person\nand\nput in the same level of energy and\neffort into our relationship that i'm\ngoing to love those uh fifth and final\nquestion taylor what is\nif you could create one law in the world\nthat everyone had to follow what would\nit be oh one law in the world\nyeah had a question to every guest ever\noh my gosh\ni want to i want to know what the best\nanswer you've gotten i don't think\nthey're all surprising like yeah you get\neverything from something really simple\nlike be kind to sorry\nspecific thoughtful stuff and so i i\ndon't i don't think we've had a best\nanswer but i am currently compiling\nevery answer we've ever had yeah i think\nit'll be fun to like\nlook at like the breadth of answers ooh\none law that everyone had to follow\nor one habit that they had to do every\nday one habit that they had to do every\nday i mean\neveryone should be journaling probably\nyeah\ni guess that maybe that yeah have you\nbeen journaling for a long time do you\nknow what i've noticed this is going\nback to the relationship single thing\nwhen i am in a relationship i'm terrible\nabout journaling wow and then when i'm\nsingle\ni'm great about it and it makes a huge\ndifference wow and\ni remember the last time i got out of a\nrelationship i had been telling myself\nokay well\ni'll get back to journaling i've been\ntelling myself that for months and i\nthought i hadn't journaled in like two\nthree months which is still bad and i\nwent back into it after my breakup and i\nmy last entry\nwas like\ngoing on a date with the person i\nwow ended up in a relationship wow which\nis\ni mean again i thought i was like ah\nit's been like 60 days i'll get back to\nit and it had just been so long well\nthat has so many lessons in it mm-hmm\nthat is that is such a great answer\nbecause i think we leave so many of our\nbest habits when we get into\nrelationships and then wonder what went\nwrong and so so journaling and no\nyelling i guess yeah unless you're happy\nand excited\nno mean yelling no mean yelling i love\nthat very deep and profound thank you uh\ntaylor you are incredible i think you're\ncool\nuh i i would yell in excitement i did\nwhen you first came uh no i am so so\nhappy that we got to do this i'm so\nhappy to get to meet you\nfor anyone who's been
