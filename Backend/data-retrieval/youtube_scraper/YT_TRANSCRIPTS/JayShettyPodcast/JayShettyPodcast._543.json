grateful for all of it\nbut like by leaning in and like not\nputting them into like a storage unit in\nmy mind but like actually processing\nthem and like\ngrowing and evolving from it has allowed\nme

you're\ndoing so many incredible things with\ncali water and i know we've got so many\nother things to talk about but i think\nfor me\nwhat\ngot me deeply intrigued in you and\nwanting this conversation with you is\nthe conversations we had through zen\nzone and so for those of you who don't\nknow what zenzone is this is something\nthat joe jonas had the idea for\nat the beginning of the pandemic and you\ncan tell me how you heard about it\nbecause i don't know how i'll tell you\nmyself\nso so joe reached out to me\nand\nhe said to me that we did this\nmeditation as part of a\ncharity event for the we foundation and\ni was asked to teach meditation\nme and joe had never met before we're on\nthis live i lead this meditation and joe\nsaid he had a great time we got\nintroduced over text he texted me and\nsaid hey we're doing we're getting\ntogether with my friends this saturday\nit's the pandemic i'd love for you to\nteach your meditation i was like sure i\nthought we'd do it once\nwe've now done it every week for 75\nweeks we've had a bit of a hiatus for\nthe last couple of months yeah and he\nwould just invite his friends and i\nhadn't even met him let alone everyone\nthat's where i met you yeah and for\nanyone who doesn't know i lead a\nmeditation but then i open it out to a\nbeautiful group of people to reflect\nshare their insights and we did this\nevery week during the pandemic\nand when you'd come on and you'd talk\nand share your reflection\ni was just like i had no idea\nthat vanessa had this like intentional\nmindful\npractice in her life\nand i was so\nthat was so endearing and intriguing but\ntell us about how you discovered zen\nzone um me and alexander ship were both\nworking on tick tick boom yes um and\nwe like\nhad uh the rehearsal space and then we\nhad to shut down production because of\ncovet and locking down and everything\nand um when we finally got back to it it\nwas in september like pre-vaccine so we\nwere in like a bubble but we she was\nlike i've been doing this meditation i\nthink that you would really enjoy it and\ni'm like so down love a meditation um\nand i got on there and i was just like\noh my god this is so beautiful and and\nyour meditation that you led was so\nso like grounding and centering and just\nlike fulfilling for my soul and i was\nlike oh my god this is amazing and then\ni remember i got added to the group chat\nand then we got sent the the zoom for\nthe next zoom everyone's sending\nconfirmations of himself like joe's\nsending one wilmer sends one i send one\nand then i thought someone was making a\njoke by sending a baseball player\nsliding onto a base and lifting his head\nand going like\nso i was like hi\nand responded in all cabs hot and then i\ngot on the zoom and alex was sitting\nnext to me and i remember seeing coal\nand just being like\nwho was that\nand she was like i don't know and then\nlike he smiled and then i was like who\nis that\nshe's like i don't know\nfound like his name and then like found\nhim on instagram and\nsent\nand then i was like oh he's the baseball\nplayer hilarious\nhilarious well i already shot my shot so\nhe knows and then later i come to find\nout that like he was watching me hit\nalex and he was like there's either like\nsomething on my face or like this girl\nhates me or like i don't know but he\ncould like see me\nbecause it's like that meditation\neveryone's like sitting and like so\nstill and i'm here like slapping alex\nlike losing my mind\num but it's been so beautiful like i i\nlove the practice so much and it's so\nit's so nice having you there leading\nthe charge and and just like feeling so\nsafe in this space to like reflect and\nand to hear how different things affects\neach other and like listening to each\nother and the the reflection is so\nconducive to growth so it's just like\nbeen so beautiful i'm so grateful of it\nyou're genuinely so kind i really\nappreciate those beautiful words but i i\nfind it fascinating that this beautiful\nrelationship for you as involved we'll\ntalk about that but i'm surprised we\nhaven't yet had one so joe also comes up\nwith funny zen names for every episode\nso i think we've had zendaya we've had\nuh\ni mean there's so many i'll have to look\nthrough but we haven't had a vanessa\nhudson we haven't done that we haven't\ndone that yet i'll have to throw that\nout to him\nas an option for the next one\nyeah it's hilarious he hasn't done that\nyet no but but when did\nwhen i when i heard your reflections i\nwas like okay vanessa's been in this\nspace for a long time like spirituality\nwhatever you call in i'd love to hear it\nthrough your language\ni was like oh she she's an evolved being\nthis is something she has invested in\nfor many years before this this is not\nher first meditation this is part of her\nlife\nwhen did any of these ideas get\nintroduced to you and how do they exist\nin your world i'm genuinely fascinated\nbecause i don't think i know yeah i mean\ni feel like i've always been a\nmeditative person i've i remember\ni used to live in san diego and i my\nparents would drive me up to la all the\ntime for auditions um and it's a long\ndrive it was like three and a half hours\nand i'm young i'm probably like eight\nyears old nine years old um and i\nremember one time just sitting with the\nwindow down like feeling the breeze on\nmy face just like clear mind staring out\nand my dad being like what are you\nthinking about\nand i was like literally nothing\nand then i think that as i got older\nthat moment for some reason would come\nback to me and i was like oh man like am\ni stupid like does that mean that i have\nnothing going on in my mind\nand then as i continued to evolve the\nmore that i realized that was a state of\nzen a state of peace and like\nmeditation practice is something that\nhas naturally just like come for me um i\nfeel like i started actually getting\nintroduced to it when i was probably\n16\ni was in brazil\num this was like after high school\nmusical had come out and me and zac\nefron were dating and we went to this\nisland like in brazil somewhere and it\nwas a magazine and they were like we can\noffer you yoga classes if you want and i\nwas like i've never done that like i'd\nlove to try i'm always down to try new\nthings and i remember it was like\noutside under this canopy of trees\nand it was like the first time that i\nfeel like i\nhad a mindful practice\nwhere i was like aware of what i was\nactually doing and i just became hooked\ni remember i was like straight off the\nbat i was like i think i need to become\na yoga instructor\ni think that's just something that i\nneed to do one yoga class literally i\nwas like i'm sold\nand then i think that like that really\nled to like mindfulness and like\npractice and\nand then when did meditation actually\ncome into play\nhonestly probably deepak chopra\nyeah\nyeah i feel like i came across like an\naudio\nsomething of his on meditations and i\nremember doing that and just being like\noh wow there's like so much\nhere and like noticing how it affected\nmy everyday life and just my\nstate of mind um\nand yeah it's like i feel like the\nsit down to actually meditate doesn't\nfully happen that often um which is why\ni love our zen zone because like it\ngives me a reason to actually do it um\nbut the the the state of mindfulness i\nthink is something that is carried into\nso many different aspects of of\nspirituality and\nspirituality itself has been like such\nan evolving journey for me i mean i\nremember\ni was how old was i i was filming\njourney to the mysterious island\num and i was on the big island where\nthey shot jurassic park\nand so it's just like beautiful rolling\nmountains it's like stunning and i\nremember thinking to myself like oh like\ni am spiritual because i i i don't\ncan't like relate anymore to religion\npractices that were instilled with me as\na child\nbut like i feel so much and i know that\ni'm a part of something bigger and i\nfeel like vibration of the land and i\njust feel connected to spirit um\nand then that itself has evolved\nso much and like i feel like i'm back at\nthat place where i'm like i am very very\nspiritual i i take time to connect to my\nspirit but also spirit around me\nand i make sure i take time to connect\nto\nto nature and i give praise when magic\nhappens because it happens all the time\nand i feel like it's so important to\nacknowledge it and to give it gratitude\nbecause then it starts coming into your\nlife so much more it just it's like it's\nreally insane once you start\nacknowledging them how like it's it's an\nabundance of of magic\nwow\nwow that's contagious i'm literally\nhearing you say that and i'm like that\nis so infectious it's just it's so true\nthough like it's so beautiful because\nthen you're filling your life with like\nthis these moments of wonder yeah and\nlike i think that's so important as an\nadult because as children we have that\nall the time yeah but like as you grow\nup you kind of forget how important it\nis to have that yeah i'm like such a big\nkid\nthat like she's always a child at heart\nbut like wonderment i think is something\nthat's so important for the soul i i\ncouldn't agree more i i love that and i\nthink it's\nwhen i think about wonder and\nchildlikeness it's the same as what i\nfeel my wife's brought back into my life\nand i felt for so long i started to take\nlife too seriously or i was very i was\nvery focused and yeah man needs a good\nwoman to bring him back absolutely a\nthousand percent a thousand percent and\nmy wife has just brought this like child\nlike energy back in my life\nand it's something you have to protect\ntotally i feel like the childlike energy\nis something you have to nurture and\nprotect in yourself\nin the people you love totally in the\npeople around your inner child like i\nremember that being like a a big big\nwake up moment for me i i think it was\nin like larry moss's acting classes i\nwas doing like one of his intensive\nworkshops and he talks about how\nimportant it is to like nurture your\ninner child because there we all have\nthat we all have that like little boy or\ngirl inside of us that's like\nkind of scared at times but is like so\nexplorative and like has wonderment but\nyou have to nurture that and if you\ndon't like it it gets neglected\nand you can't neglect your inner child\ndefinitely not definitely i mean do you\nthink that's what's i mean for yourself\nlike you've\nbeen in the industry a long time now\nsince you're extremely young\nand\ni feel like you've been\ngreat at like navigating it with grace\nand pivoting and figuring things out\nand\nobviously from the time we've been\ngetting to know each other through\nzenzone and even today i can tell that\nthere's so much thoughtfulness and so\nmuch clarity for you\ndo you think that nurturing that inner\nchild is what has helped you navigate a\nvery tough industry or what what has\nthat been what has it i feel like that's\ndefinitely part of it yeah for sure\num\nbecause it allows me to stay\nextraordinarily passionate\nabout\nmy loves which is like everything you\nknow like in my work and in my life and\nin the way i spend my time but i think\nthe thing that honestly has kept me\ngoing is accepting change\nand evolving and and knowing that\nevolution is like a positive thing and\nleaning into the like scary\nscary things that like could hurt me and\nand like\njust constantly reevaluating what it is\nto be\na human in this experience and like who\ndo i want to be because like that's\ngenuinely like a choice you like have we\nhave so many choices every single day on\nlike how we\nbuild our our character how we present\nourselves to the world and like i feel\nlike i've had multiple moments where\ni've had to like really look at myself\nand reassess and say\nwhat kind of woman do i want to be yeah\num and like who am i truly like what\nwhat is my cord what is my what are my\nvalues um and i feel like it's just\nallowed me to feel really confident and\nstrong\nin who i am as a person\nbecause i think that that's that's where\na lot of people have difficulties in in\nhollywood because you end up like\nmorphing into different people because\nit's a tough grind but it is it is\nbecause people morph into the roles they\nplay totally they morph into the role\nthey have to play and portray totally\nthey morph into the role that their\nmanager or their agent thinks they need\nto be yeah or the person who came before\nthem that they're trying to be like\ntotally there's all these identities\ntotally yeah you're trying to morph into\nthat it's hard to remember your own i\nguess\nwha what was a formative experience at a\nyounger age that you think has\nuh given you a sense of groundedness as\nyou've gone on were there any formative\nexperiences uh as you grow at any point\nin your childhood or no i mean early\nteenage years i\ni don't know why i don't know if this is\nlike actually at all relevant the\nfastest is the best the fastest the best\nyeah um i i was the kid that loved\nplaying in the dirt\nyou know like i was always the kid that\nwas like in the garden like grabbing\nlike pieces of of plants and like\nsmooshing them together and like having\nthe flowers and like doing like little\ncollages in the dirt like i've always\nlike been i feel like i've always felt\nvery connected to earth\num\nand i look back at it now and i'm just\nlike it's so funny because\nand now i'm i i like love practicing\nlike witchcraft and having rituals and\nand like\nplaying and being a part of earth and\nconnecting with it is such a big part of\nit and i'm just like oh wow she was\nalways there yeah she was always there\nshe was always playing in the dark um\nbut yeah like i feel like i also was\nraised in a way where like my parents\ndidn't have a lot my dad was a\nfirefighter my mom was from the\nphilippines like came out to the stage\nwhen she was 24 with my dad um and it\nwas like the first man she'd ever even\nbeen with like first guy she ever kissed\nlike\ncrazy um but i was raised very modestly\nso i think that like that definitely\nshaped me into who i am because i'm very\nmindful about like where i spend my\nmoney and and like\nwhat i'm doing with it and like\ni but like it also i think makes me work\nharder and want to do the work myself do\nthe dirty work\n[Laughter]\ni love it but yeah like because that's\njust like my my character that's how i\nwas raised yeah that's that's beautiful\nto hear and uh i'm going to ask you now\nto define what witchcraft is for the\nyoung you know for those who may not be\naware and and those rituals because i\nthink as you say those words i i'd love\nyou to extrapolate them because i've\nseen so i've seen you post when you get\nnew tattoos\nand it's cool but i would love i'd love\nfor you to explain that totally\num i think like being a witch genuinely\nis like so many different things for\neach person um to me it's it's a\nmindfulness for sure um it's connecting\nto your elements um it's about\nunderstanding the fact that everything\nis energetic and we can push and pull\nthings if we set our mind to it and ask\nfor it um it's a lot of manifesting\nwhich i love\nand rituals are like i love like a full\nmoon ritual where i'll like sage my\nspace and like cleanse my energy and my\naura and then like ask my angels and my\nancestors and my spirit guides to be\nthere with me and to help carry out my\nmessage\num and then like honestly writing things\ndown on some bay leaves and burning them\nis really exciting because it burns and\nlike it's really it's like it really\ncatches flame yeah\nit feels magical um but like it's like\nconnecting to earth and like to spirit\nand\nand like\ntapping in yeah because you i feel like\nyou really can\nyeah i mean i love hearing that because\ni think when people hear the word\nwitchcraft totally which is we have a\nvery dated views yes stigmatized yes\nview of where you hear a witch and like\npeople are like burner at the stake\nexactly and i i mean i grew up in london\nwhere one of the\nattractions to visit as a tourist was\nthe london dungeons yeah and so you'd go\nto see these london dungeons and they\nwould show you how\nuh women and many women who are wrongly\naccused of being witches and of course\nwhich is in the stigmatized or the uh\nnegative senses we've seen portrayed in\nmovies and things like that yeah and and\nyou would see how they'd be burned and\nand the kind of dungeons that they had\nto stay in and the states they're saying\nand now obviously when you say the word\nyou're looking at it from like\nuh the good witch like you know like the\nwitch of manifestation yeah exactly and\njoy and kindness and feel like that's\nthe modern witch yes yes and redefining\nthat word is so important because it\nreally is language i think today is so\nmuch of the reason we have disagreements\n100 and one of the reasons why we don't\nunderstand each other yeah and when you\nstart explaining what a witch is i'm\nlike yeah that's like uh what's the the\nwitch in um blender yes exactly that's\nexactly what i was thinking yeah yeah\nyou read my mind that's it and i was\nlike yeah she was a witch and she's\ncalled a witch in the movie she is but\nwhen you think about it the witch you\nremember yeah is not her right\nand so it's so fascinating when you\nthink about it from that way what if i\nlove those rituals you just walked us\nthrough\nwhen you're doing those rituals or when\nyou've built those practices up\nwhat has given you strength to believe\nthat they have an impact is it something\nyou feel is it something you've heard is\nit is it a connection like how how do\nyou\ngo yes this works for me this matters in\nmy life i feel like it's such an\nintuitive thing yes and like i said i i\nwas the little girl playing in the dirt\nlike\nmushing\nit does it feels it feels really\ngrounding and connecting to me and like\ni've manifested for years and like\nif you're very clear and intentional on\nwhat you want you have a much better\nchance at getting it can you tell us a\nmanifestation story can you tell us one\nthat you feel is worth sharing that yeah\ni mean like even like cole\nlike i i was very clear very intentional\nabout what it is exactly tell us what\nyou're addicted to\nit's like i was like i want someone who\noh man i wish i had i literally have\nlike a list okay um\nit was i want\nsomeone who loves themself\nwholeheartedly um\nsomeone who understands the importance\nof like having a good time\nsomeone who has like the right\npriorities in life you know like has the\nsame fundamentals as me um\nwhich is like\nyou live\nyou don't what is it you don't live to\nwork no you don't you don't live to work\nyou work to live yeah yeah yeah like\nsomeone who understands like the\nimportance of life outside of work\nthere's a whole list but literally when\ni met cole i was like\nyou literally check all my boxes what i\nlove about your list though and that's\nwhy i asked you because i i expected\nthat your list that is the most mature\nrefined list i have ever heard of\nbecause because most lists do not go\nthat deep like that that is a very\ngenuinely and i'm not saying this to\nflatter you at all i'm genuinely saying\nit because yeah i hear a lot of lists\nyeah my coaching work and yeah when i'm\nwith clients and and over the years\npeople that i've worked with and lists\nthose are all like incredible attributes\nwhich show your self-awareness of who\nyou are and what you need in your life\nbut they're also not\nso\nspecifically defined that\nit's kind of very difficult that that\nexists totally if that makes sense yeah\nit's not like i want this and i want\nthat and he should have this and it's\nnot stuff about he should have no no\nit's about his mindset and his belief\nwalk us through how do you\nassess and assess is the wrong word\nbecause in a relationship you're not\nassessing someone how do you\nengage with someone in a way\nto know\nthat those things exist within them and\ni'm asking you this for yourself yeah\nbecause\ni find that sometimes people may make a\nlist or they have a list\nand first of all i would like to remind\nanyone if you are going to make a list\nthink about vanessa's list and just\nthink about how how\ni'm trying to find the right word to\ndefine your list i would say that it is\nextremely\nmindset-based\nand it's extremely an approach to life\nyeah you're looking with someone who has\na specific approach to life exactly yeah\nit's not that they have a specific life\nthat's very true yeah right yeah does\nthat make sense 100 yeah and so how did\nyou you know ascertain\nthat cole had some of these things\nbecause\ni think what often happens is when we\nget attracted to someone or we feel a\nsense of infatuation\nor we feel some chemistry or a spark\nwith someone often that ability to\nascertain whether we're really going to\nbe a good match goes out the window\ntotally how are you able to hold both\nbecause i think we do need attraction\nand chemistry of course we do yeah 100\nbut at the same time you're saying well\ni was able to assess that he does have\nseven yeah i mean i was in an\neight-year-long relationship before him\num so after that i was like okay we're\ngetting serious like we are going to\nmake a list of things that i need like\ngenuinely like not one but actually need\num and with some of it it was being very\nstraightforward um with like\nmy questions as to like\nhow he goes about life um and then in\nother ways it was just like really\nobserving him and like\ngenuinely his approach to life um\nlike he he has like an infectious spirit\nand i'm like that is something that is\nso beautiful and so wonderful and i'm\nlike i i see myself in that as well\nbut like we just like had the same the\nsame spirit and i think that like\nstraight off the bat i was very\nforthright with like what it is that i\nwant in a relationship and like i was\nlike cool so you're down you're into\nthose things as well love that\nbut like just being very straightforward\nlike you plan on getting married one day\nlike you plan on having kids you like\nkids what's your relationship with your\nparents like what's your relationship\nwith your friends how do you enjoy your\nwork like everything just like diving in\nbecause like if you don't like those\nthings get lost in the shuffle and then\nyou end up investing time on people that\nyou shouldn't\nis that date one\nmight have been date two\nmight have been date two yeah i i am so\nhappy hearing you say that i and i just\nwant everyone to know while we're having\nthis conversation i do not know this\nstory in depth the way vanessa's\nexplaining it so this is also my first\nreaction to it i am so happy hearing you\nsay that like it gives me so much\nassurance and confidence in what i hope\npeople will do to find\nlove in their life yeah i did the same\nwith radhi we had the same conversations\nwe talked about\nchildren we talked about our values we\ntalked about our beliefs we talked about\nexpectations i was very clear with\nrather of the man that i think i am and\nthe man that i didn't want to be\ni was clear about what my aspirations\nand priorities were\nand what i wouldn't be able to\nprioritize exactly and it was\nuncomfortable to say those things\nbecause you're scared that like well\nmaybe this person is going to run away\ntotally when they hear what i'm actually\nlike yeah but then if they stay exactly\nthen they actually signed on for that\nand it's like you give like my my sister\nactually does a podcast as well and i\nwas like listening to it the other day\nand she was like it's so important to\nlike tell your friends or your partner\nif something's bothering you because\nthen you give them the opportunity to\nadjust like otherwise they don't know\nyeah shout out stella\nstella what's your podcast that's crazy\nthat's crazy okay listen to that episode\nwhat was the episode about it about this\num what was that one about just like\nfriends and like you know feeling fomo\nit was fomo\nyeah\nno because it's it's also just like i\nknow that we got a message um\ni think you sent it to my team saying\ncan i bring darla today yeah and and i\nlove that you said that and i'm so glad\nshe came yeah because i would've been so\nsad if i as a friend it's like if you if\nyou felt that but then you didn't tell\nme yeah totally right\nno and then like\nyou just gotta you just gotta know like\nand i'm so happy she's here and i'm so\nhappy to meet her and yeah and when you\ntold me the reason you like i've been\ntraveling and i haven't seen her i'm\nlike that is so beautiful like why would\nyou not but we're so\nwe're so scared yeah of showing that\nside of ourselves to someone of being\nlike this is what i need\nhonoring our truths yes i think like\nit's so easy to disregard our truths\nwhen you like have thought and you're\nlike ugh like i wish that this would\nhappen and like but no like it shouldn't\nmatter like it's it's okay it's fine i\ndon't really care and like you don't\nhonor your truth and so i feel like it's\nsomething that you have to be actually\nmindful about and to like really listen\nto your intuition and like your inner\nvoice your inner child like you really\nhave to like honor all of yourself\nbecause if you're not then you're\nsuppressing yourself and then it's gonna\nseem okay for someone else to suppress\nyou because you're doing it to yourself\nyes wow that is that's so true yeah that\nis so true that yeah and then that's\njust like a toxic talk it starts off\nif you plant a toxic seed exactly like\nthat's what's going to grow yes and it's\nreally hard to then switch to a rose\nbush or you know to grow a beautiful\ntree or plant or whatever it is like\ni i wonder then how do you then navigate\nobviously when you do that when you are\nlike well here's what i'm looking for\nand here's what's important to me how do\nyou then navigate it when you don't\nnecessarily align or agree\nhow have you dealt with that because i\nthink that's another healthy thing to\nthink about i think we often have this\nromantic view of manifestation totally\nand i don't think that's what you're\nsuggesting but i think a lot of people\nhave this romantic view that when you're\nclear you get exactly what you want the\nway you want it i don't think that's\nwhat you no no no no no that's\ndefinitely not the case as well like i\nthink that like everything does come\nback\nnot always in the way that you expect it\nto exactly not always at the time that\nyou want it to but it always does in one\nform of the other and i like i i truly\nbelieve that and i like see that\nhappening because i'll\nsometimes i'll ask for something and i'm\nlike oh my gosh that's so funny that's\nnot like how i expected it to come like\nlike you know like i was on our zoom\nlike\nat all but like it's it's the best thing\nthat's ever happened to me um\nso i i feel like it always it always\ncomes back around um but like the\nmindfulness is like so important\nyeah i i mean i i love hearing about it\nand i can't wait to see you both\ntogether\nand i can't wait to finally hang out\nwith carl who by the way for anyone who\ndoesn't know he'll join\nthe meditation when he's like on the\nfield like he'll be like in the stands\nhe'll be you know walking to a game like\nhe'll be driving to get whatever it is\nand he's he's always on and i think\nthere's so much to be said for that as\nwell to find people in places of similar\nvalues 100.\ni've always been a great encourager of\nthat is that\nyou're going to find people when you're\ndoing things that you're both passionate\nabout and you're not going there to date\nlike it's so funny i literally was on\nthe phone with my friend vince this\nmorning and i was thinking about it and\ni was like it's so funny because i feel\nlike all my best relationships have like\nsuch an interesting like story as to how\nwe met like my friend vince who i was on\nthe phone with we met in a yoga class\nwow and he's like one of my best friends\nmy other best friend gigi we met like in\nbali because i was with there with\noakley like doing a surf thing even\nthough i'm not a surfer but i'm like you\nknow i'm all about like trying new\nthings and having new experiences\nbecause i feel like it builds character\nand it's also just like a great time\nyeah of course yeah\nbut like it was like one of those\nmoments as well and then like me and\ngigi sat across from each other at the\ntable and we like locked eyes and we\nwere like i see you i see you in a way\nthat's like different like my soul sees\nyou yeah um and like it's just so many\nof my relationships i'm like it's just\nso funny how like you put yourself into\nthe right place in in a place of love\nand you will attract it yeah definitely\nand this is gigi you do workouts with\nright yes yes yes that's right you do a\nlot of things together we got a lot of\nthings in the work during quarantine we\nlike really put our minds together and\nwe're like let's be creative like let's\nlet's keep the ball rolling and we like\nwe\ndeveloped an animated show we developed\nlike a a reality show for ourselves and\nwe like wrote a feature with our friend\nand we were just like yeah that's\namazing i know but like all because we\nsat across from each other in bali\nthat's incredible and i love that that's\na recurring pattern in your life oh\ncompletely that the deepest\nrelationships you have whether it's\nvince or gigi as you said and now call\nthat they've come from these places\nwhere you weren't looking for that yeah\nand so i think we often hear this idea\nof like you don't have to look for love\nand that's not what we're saying what\nwe're saying is that you often find it\nin a place of mutual value when you're\nloving yourself and honoring\nyourself yeah that's that's the key\nthat's exactly it and and so much\nhappens when you\nspend time in places of purpose totally\nlike i feel like when you're going there\nfor\na purpose-based reason\nyou're more likely to have this synergy\nhappening oh my gosh the amount of stuff\nthat happened to me when i went to paris\nfor fashion week on my own was like just\nwhat i felt like i had tea from for\nmonths\nbut like it was just so cool because i'm\nlike paris fashion week is something\nthat i wanted to go to for a long time\nand i was like you know what i'm gonna\ngo on my own\nbecause like it'll like it'll really\nlike put me in there yeah um and i and i\nlove that like i love those solo moments\nwhere\ni i'm just like out there in the\nwilderness on my own and like you meet\npeople and like connect with people and\ni'm like some of my favorite memories\nthat i've had\nlike have been because i've gone places\non my own\nwow what's giving you that i i love\nhearing that because i'm the kind of\nperson so riley's been away for three\nmonths and we haven't seen each other i\nmiss her yeah oh my god i hate that so\nmuch and she's coming back in a month\nand i miss her so it'll be four months\nsince we've seen each other and i cannot\nwait i'm about to throw her a party when\nshe comes back and like full on like you\nknow we're gonna go away and all the\nrest of it catch up and make make up for\nher lost time but\ni find that i'm the kind of person that\nwill take myself out for a three-course\nmeal and i go away and go out or\nwhatever it is what has given you the\nconfidence\nin doing things alone because i think\nthat is such a healthy habit totally i'm\nnot saying that people should spend all\ntheir time learning no no no but\nhow have you developed that habit is it\njust by practice is it just by throwing\nyourself out there or yeah now it sounds\nlike it's something you intentionally do\nlike paris fashion week yeah i'm sure\nyou could have taken anyone you wanted\nto take but you went on your own yeah um\ni feel like my first solo trip\nwas when i was like\nit was right after i did a stint of like\nreally heavy\nemotionally demanding movies\num\ni think gimme shelter was the last one\nof that\num and i came home and i like genuinely\ndid not know who vanessa was i had like\ngotten so\noff on becoming this other person and\nlike genuinely\nchanged my mindset the way that i looked\ni put on like 20 pounds cut off all my\nhair like all the things that made me me\nwere not there anymore and i was like i\nneed to do something because i'm like\nscared\nbecause i don't know who i am and i was\nlike okay we're going to go on a yoga\nretreat my my publicist at the time was\nlike either this retreat they're doing\nit the four seasons um it was like a\npractice and i was like okay i'm just\ngonna like go on my own\nbecause that scares me and i was very\nmuch in that place of like do the things\nthat scare you because you will evolve\nlike you're forced to um and i was like\nyou know like a yoga retreat in hawaii\nlike that gives me an excuse to be in\nhawaii um but also like have something\nto do and like know that i'll be around\npeople because like\nfilming as well as an adult like when i\nhit 18 i would go off to film things all\nthe time and i would be on my own and so\nlike if i wanted to go to dinner like a\nlot of times i would just go by myself\nand like bring a book and\nlike i definitely would have those\nmoments where i'm like looking around\nlike kind of trying to like\nlock eyes and engage with anyone\num preferably would sit at the bar so i\ncould like talk to the bartender because\nlike i love i love people like i love i\nlove just like talking to people yeah\nbut you start using a different part of\nyour brain when you do that like you\nstart using a different part of your\nenergy where it's like oh i'm gonna see\nif i can make something out of nothing\nyeah that's a mindset that you lose as\nwe get older because most of your life\nis surrounded by the same people same\nwork people same life people and so like\nwhen you're like oh i'm trying to talk\nto the bartender or i'm trying to lock\neven the idea of locking eyes with\nsomeone random oh my god overcomes a\nfear yeah but it's like favorite thing i\nliterally will like be driving and like\nwell like turn and just like look at\npeople if i'm stopped at a red light and\nlike try to like dance with people the\nother day this guy was like listening to\na song we had our windows down he had\nhis windows down and me and my\ngirlfriend were just like body will and\nlike just like lock and eyes trying to\nmake this person laugh like yeah it's i\ni love that but the trip the yoga\nretreat in hawaii ended up just being\nlike\nso freeing because i was just like okay\nlike i'm here on my own like i'm just\ngonna like talk to people that i connect\nwith and like go from there and like\ngenuinely forced me to stay as present\nas possible because i was engaging with\npeople i know nothing about i feel like\nthat's the thing i love about talking to\npeople that you don't know like you're\nforced to be president because it's like\nif you're actually trying to engage\nwhich not everybody does\nbut then those are the people you don't\nneed to engage with um but when you find\npeople who you can like\nit's you you're so present because\nyou're actually listening yeah\nwhat i love about hearing about your\nlife that i'm learning about you today\nby being present with you is just\nyou're you are very present because you\nhave all these beautiful memories\nand i find like these are not ideas in\nyour life or they're not like just\nconcepts that you intellectually\nunderstand\nit's like i feel like your whole life is\nan\nexperience like you're like oh i went to\nfashion week because of this and i was\nin this place because\nto have deep memories you have to be\ndeeply present totally because otherwise\nyou forget where you were last week or\nwhere you were\neven yesterday totally and so how have\nyou become more present i mean how have\nyou practiced that or is you've been\nlike that obviously it sounds like but\nit also sounds like it's very\nintentional again\nlike how are you raising your presence\nuh when when you're in a space or in an\nenvironment i think like honestly it's\ncome from\n[Music]\nthe reflection and growth that i've done\nto like actually have\nconfidence in in myself\nto like\nfeel like i can take up as much space or\nas little space as i want\num and knowing that i have that choice\ni've always been a very present person\nand i think that i've positioned myself\nnow like it's taken so many years of\nlike reflection and growth and like\ndoing all the uncomfortable work\nto shape me into the person that i am\nand i look back and i'm like i'm so\ngrateful for all of it i'm so grateful\nfor all the icky times because there's a\nlot of icky times in life but like by\nleaning in and like not putting them\ninto like a storage unit in my mind but\nlike actually processing them and like\ngrowing and evolving from it has allowed\nme to like have confidence in myself\nbecause i'm just like i know that i'm\nenough like yeah and i'm like i i know\nthat like my point on life is beautiful\nand i know that like what i want to\ncontribute to to people and to the world\nis is beautiful and so i'm like it's all\ngood\nhey it's all good\nand that's and that's the thing right\nlike when you make sense of your inner\nworld on your own totally\nit that's where it has to click 100\nbecause if it clicks for me then like\nit's okay if it doesn't click for\neverybody but like i know that like i'm\nlocked in yeah if you know i always say\nto people like if you have a decision or\na choice you want to make and if you\nknow why you're doing it\nand you're clear on that it will not\nbother you if other people don't\nunderstand exactly but if you don't know\nwhy you're doing it\nthen it just like and that's what i'm\nhearing from you it's that that that\ninner\nclick has has as fit for you\nand it sounds like during the pandemic\nyou are extremely innovative\ncollaborative seemed like you were doing\na lot of cool stuff we both shared this\nin common we both launched a different\ntype of beverage line\nduring\nuh the pandemic and afterwards you\nlaunched cali water which\nis amazing yeah uh and i want to hear\nabout just when when i first when i was\nlike cactus i was like that is so unique\nlike it is so\ndifferent i didn't even i didn't even\nknow i think this is going to sound\nreally silly but i was like i don't even\nknow you could get tired\nsome of the and that's one of them i'm\nsure there's plenty of others but\nwhere did those ideas and innovations\nstart because that requires\nuh such a\na different mindset it sounds like you\nhad this space to be innovative and\ncreative you said you were doing work\nwith gigi but you're also doing this i\nlove a collaboration yeah i live for a\ncollaboration because i'm like i know\nwhat i can bring to the table and then\nyou collaborate with people who knows\nwhat they can bring to the table and\nit's like you guys have fun doing it\ntogether yeah okay go\num and that's literally how i feel like\nall my business ventures have been um\nyou know with cali water it was our\nfriend oliver trevina yes shout out\nyeah who is my business partner and like\nhe came to me and he was like we should\nwe need to like do something together\nand he's like there's we could do like\nbeverages and he's like there's like\ncactus there's a lot there's something\nthere and like i went to new mexico on a\nroad trip and was drinking prickly pear\nmargaritas and i was like what is this\nthe heavenly nectar and like why do i\nknow nothing about it yeah and then\nstarted like researching what prickly\npear is and then like realized all the\nhealth benefits um and then you know\nlike we're like okay cool so like that's\nlike a thing there's something there and\nthen like him like taking the reins and\nputting together an incredible team to\nlike\nput together this drink and like\nbring it to life and then like me doing\nlike the creative and like the tastings\nand i'm like no it's a little off like i\nneed something more of this like maybe a\nlittle like\nmore monk fruit or like you know like\nsomething um i love monk packaging yeah\ni do too but\nit's just like it's such a fun creative\noutlet for me that like i i really enjoy\nlike it's so stimulating to me and\nexciting and it's just like really cool\nbeing able to be passionate about\nsomething and then like sharing that\npassion with the masses yeah yeah it's\nawesome no i highly recommend everyone\ngrab some because it's i i just love\nseeing people\nfind multiple ways to express themselves\n100 and not being scared and not feeling\nlimited by like oh i'm an actress i\nshould be that or like i'm at this yeah\ni'm like but we're all just creative\nartists individuals and when we can just\nlike paint through every single color\nand every single brush\nthere's nothing wrong with that and i\nthink it should be encouraged more and i\nthink often we feel limited and\nrestricted by what we think people will\nthink and what they were saying\nliterally and we stopped realizing that\nwe just have to color more and paint\nmore and get out there more is there\nsomething you do to tap into more\ncreativity or innovation is there any\nhabits or any rituals you have or is\nthat also same connected with doing the\nintuitive work it's literally all\nintuitive i feel i and and it's like\nit's it's the magic thing i think that\nlike when i'm doing things that i'm\ninspired to do and i honor those\ninspirations um the thrill and the\nfulfillment that comes along with it is\nlike\nwhat i imagine it's like to have kids\nyou know it's like because you're\nputting like such a vulnerable piece of\nuniquely you into something\nand then and then sharing it and so it's\nlike it's such a vulnerable thing um\nlike i\ni came up with like a reality show for\nfor me and gigi and i'm like it's so\nfunny because\ni\nlike 15 years ago would be like i would\nnever do a reality show like i am a\nserious actress um but this this show\nlike i i came up with like i birthed it\nfrom my mind and i was just like this is\nsomething that i love\nand like would love to do because i feel\nlike it would be hilarious and it's a\ngreat time you guys are really funny\ntogether yeah we're hysterical oh i mean\ni have something um but like also so\ncreative and like down to what we're\nwearing in our show and like who we're\npartnered with and like\njust putting on the business hat like\nit's it's really exciting i'm like she's\na she's a woman like she's making moves\num just because i'm like leaning into my\ninterest and like honoring the ideas\nthat i have rather than like pushing\nthem down\nand the show's happening\nyou know you're making it happen you're\nmaking avenues\nwe're waiting on someone at the moment\nit takes time um but like it's been so\nexciting because we've like literally\ngotten so many of our ducks in the row\nwhere we're like this would be the dream\nand then like it's falling into place\nand i love that it's just so nice\nbecause i'm doing it all like with\npeople that i love yeah i love hearing\nabout ideas when they're being formed\nyeah because it's it's special like we\nusually hear about like oh we just made\nthe show when it's out yeah and then\nit's like but this is the part that's so\ninteresting because it's like well we\ndid this and now we did this and we're\nwaiting for this and we're figuring this\nout and i'm hoping that everyone who's\nlistening or watching is\nhearing it going oh that's normal like\nyou know literally stems from an idea\nyeah what if\nwhat if and then like building it off of\nthere and like that's why i love doing\nthings with my friends because the\nsnowballing is so real you know like is\nthat what it's called yeah yeah yeah um\nand it's just like the best thing\nbecause like even like the futur feature\nthat we did like it was me gigi and our\nfriend asha who\nhas written for like american horror\nstory and like we love american horror\nstory um and it totally fits with the\nvibe of like our idea and she was like\nyou guys might write a feature you're\nlike yeah and then we were like okay so\nwhat if it starts here and it's about\nlike these four witches and like it just\nsnowballs from there and it's just like\nit's so cool because i feel like\neverything that i'm doing is something\nthat i'm like so passionate about\nand like i'm really like carving out\ntime to like stay super engaged in\neverything that i'm doing and not just\nlike taking a back seat well that's what\ni was gonna ask you like how are you and\nand i can see that i mean\nevery idea everything we've spoken about\ntoday\ni can tell how passionate you are\nit just comes through\nit's in flow it's in your heart it's\nit's there so that's so evident to me as\nsomeone who i feel like i live a very\nsimilar life and that i do a lot of\ndifferent things that i'm passionate\nabout how are you\nprioritizing making time\nto do all of that like what works for\nyou because i'm sure there's a lot of\npeople going oh wow like you know\nvanessa's doing a ton of stuff i mean\nshe has new movies coming out she's\ndoing this and she's doing this and\nshe's building this like how do you make\nsense of doing so many different things\nand how do you balance it because you\nstill you're still working out you're\nstill doing your your own personal\npractices how are you balancing and\nmanaging that all i think it's about\nlike\nreally\nhonoring\nmy\nmy my needs and like having a strong\npriority list\num i feel like right now i'm being very\nclear and intentional with my my career\num in acting uh\ni've i'm like i'm not doing anything\nunless like it pushes me in a new way\nchallenges me in a new way or it's with\npeople\nthat i can work with that i like really\nrespect and i know will help me evolve\nand grow um otherwise i'm like i only\nwant to be doing things that like i'm\nproducing\nbecause then i'm like i have like a say\non the story and like the way that it\nlooks and like the way that it shines\nyou know like i can be like so much more\ncreative to like the overall outcome of\nthe movie because a lot of times like so\nmany things end up on the cutting room\nfloor and like that's fine but you're\nlike you watch it you're like oh they\nwent with that take interesting um and\nyou've like no say over yeah and that's\nhard it's hard it's tough but like i'm\nlike as a producer i like can come in\nand like can help like build out\nprojects and like\ni can i can actually dream them up\nmyself and like bring them to the table\nand like find producers that i really\nrespect and admire and like use their\nminds to like snowball with and and see\nhow we can work together to bring it to\nlife and i just feel like it's it's so\nmuch more fulfilling for me as an\nactress to be able to be a part of that\ncreative yeah which is why i'm like one\nday one day i will direct because i'm\nlike it's something that i love so much\nand i'm like my point of view is\ni think not what a lot of people would\nthink because they did like get to know\nme from high school musical um i'm like\nmy taste is like weird and it's trippy\nand it's dark sometimes um\nso i'm like that's something that i\nwould love to eventually get to but like\ni have that aspect of my life and then i\nhave like the business side of things\nwhere i'm like making sure i just got an\nassistant like for the first time wow\nbecause i was like i am too busy and i\nneed to like honor my time and like i\nneed help i was just like doing\neverything on my own um but so like i\nhave her and i'm like now i'm like every\ntop of the week i'm like okay we need to\ncheck in with these people um like set\nup calls and and we'll get it done and i\nmake sure to check in with all the\nbusinesses like see what they need see\nwhere we're at um and then like making\nsure that i have my me time which is is\nhard because i feel like the me time\nalso funnels into like my relationship\nbecause that is what i want like i want\nto be with my partner\num but i'm like also\nmy work i feel also drives my slight me\ntime too because i'm like i'm i'm here\nin la i'm not with him at the moment\nbecause i have things that i'm doing\nhere and like like uh my flat fabletics\ncollection is coming out in april and\ni'm like that is something that i like\ndesigned myself like another full\ncreativity step um but i'm like here and\ni like get to talk about it and like i\nfeel like\nit's just so like i said so nice to have\nthese things that i'm like putting a lot\nof myself into and being able to talk\nabout them and like share them with\nothers and like hopefully that connects\nme with other people who are like-minded\nas well you know well all i experienced\nfrom you today is this abundance like\nthere's an abundance of creativity in\nyour life there's an abundance of\nexpression\nthere's also an abundance of like\ngenuine confidence in in who you are and\nhow you show up and and everything\nyou're doing and and i love seeing it\nlike it's so fun i i find it so fun to\nobserve that in someone yeah because i\nappreciate that it's taken work and that\nit's\nnot something that that person was just\ngiven totally and so yeah just just\nviewing you today and observing you\ntoday i'm like it's amazing it's\nelectric to experience that through\nsomeone thank you and i congratulate you\nfor all those aspects oh thank you\nbecause it's\ni'm sure there's lots of people\nlistening and watching going oh\ni can be\neverything i want to be yeah\nyou know we don't have to like we don't\nhave to choose anymore and you don't\nhave to limit you can be everything and\nthat was like a big wake-up call for me\ni was like no one is one thing like\nwe're so allowed and like it should be\ncelebrated to be as many different\nthings as you can be as long as they're\nhonest and truthful and like coming from\nwithin\nnot from an idea of what you think you\nshould be doing\nthat's it yeah vanessa you've been so\ngenerous with your time i'm like i could\nsit here and talk forever i mean i can\ndo it i can continue\num you've been i know you've been\ntraveling and you've been moving around\ni know you're catching up so i i want to\nexpress to you so much gratitude from my\nheart for your time your energy\nuh turning up to the zen zones your\nfriendship your reflections in the zen\nzones like i always feel like you'll\ncome in and you'll open up and then\neveryone else feels inspired to open up\nsome more as well\nand\nand even today like it has truly been\nwonderful to witness\njust what exudes from you um and and i\nreally appreciate that i appreciate you\noh you're very kind thank you and\nwe all do\nbut we end every on-purpose episode with\nwhat we call the final five\num these are five fast questions that\nhave to be answered in one word to one\nsentence maximum i love it um you can\ntake your time to think about them but\nthe answers are tired so all right so\nthe first question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever received or heard\nin this moment of my life where i am\njust honor yourself\nthat's great advice we've never had that\nbefore in the show that's great advice\nit's a good short sentence too it is\nit's beautiful it's easy to remember\nyeah it's so it because i feel like it's\nso easy to not\nin so many different aspects and it's\nlike if you actually do\nthen like you can like live your truth\nand that's what we're all trying to do\nright i love that\nquestion number two what is the worst\nadvice you've ever received or had\n[Laughter]\num\nlike maybe always say yes um\ni feel like um\nsaying yes can like definitely be a\nwonderful thing but i think it's what\nyou say no to that shapes you\nyour character that's great advice i\nreally like that that's beautiful see\nthis is good it's good i like it yeah\nthe the stillness is good\nyeah it does it does okay question\nnumber three how would you define your\ncurrent purpose or the current impact\nyou're trying to have in the world and\nto spread joy\nhonestly yeah i feel like i have an\nabundance of it\nlike if i can share it\nthat's like the most beautiful thing i\ncan offer i love that yeah that's\nbeautiful all right question number four\nwhat's the first thing you do in the\nmorning and the last thing you do at\nnight\n[Music]\ni hate my answer but if i'm gonna answer\ntrue truthfully\nit's probably like well it depends on\nwhere i am yes like if i'm with darla i\nlike just find her and like hold her\nyes have a little cuddle and like\ni think i like i'm a big like deep\nbreather in the morning like get back\ninto breath\nbut like check my phone yeah of course\nyeah that's i mean that's yeah but it\nalso like depends like on if i'm on my\nown or if i'm with cole yeah cause i'm\nlike if i'm with him then it's like ugh\nlike my first thing is like oh gratitude\nand just like love\num if i'm on my own i'm just like okay\nwhat do we got vanessa yeah\nit's beautiful thank you for the honesty\nbut i also like the the mix of answers\nall right fifth and final question if\nyou could create one law that everyone\nin the world had to follow\nor one habit that everyone had to do\nevery day what would it be think before\nyou speak oh wow that was cool\ni don't know if that's like the that's\njust the first one that popped into my\nmind but like it's it's i feel like we\nall\nwe all could\nyeah navigate through life a bit better\nif we really stopped to like really\nthink before we we spoke and be\nimpeccable with your word yes i'm just\ngoing to go into the four groups yes\nexactly\nyeah i feel like\ni don't know i'm such a such a lover\nand it really bums me out when people\nget into arguments and they say things\nthat they don't mean because they're not\nthinking before they speak and like\nthe miscommunication that comes along\nwith it it's just like it's it's\nheartbreaking to me when relationships\ncan be like just deeply tarnished in\nthose moments of of like heightened a\nheightened emotion yeah just because we\ndidn't just because we didn't pause\nyou're so right\ni feel like\nrelationships are ruined just because we\ndidn't breathe yeah literally we didn't\npause yeah we didn't take that moment of\nstillness\nto respond and not react yeah you\ndestroy\nlifelong relationships yeah because you\nmisinterpreted a word yeah or you\nmisunderstood an emotion exactly or you\nmisconstrued a feeling yeah it's\nincredible also like just speak your\nmind i think so the balance yeah yeah\nit's like the balance of it because i\nfeel like i\nagree\ngrowing up in the industry is like tough\nthis is not an answer i don't know he\nsaid one sentence no no i'm like no\nthere's none of it\nlike growing up in the industry is tough\nand i feel like it was really easy for\nme to just like put on my professional\nface because like i was doing what i\nloved at like such an early age so for\nme i was like okay like this is my adult\nvoice like this is my adult thoughts um\nand it was like so easy for me to like\nnot just like speak up and i like i said\nlike if you're suppressing one aspect of\nyourself\nthen like it dribbles into everything\nand i feel like in relationships through\nthe years like i i look back and i'm\nlike there's there's so many moments\nwhere i'm like if i just would have like\nspoken up and like said how life how\ni've actually felt like so much pain\nand like tears could have been avoided\num\nbut like by going through that like i\nnow know like how important it is to\nlike speak up and like honor yourself\num\nbecause of the times that i didn't yeah\nit doesn't make it any easier like it's\nstill like something that like even i\nhave to like be like okay brave face\nwe're talking about this now\ni like genuinely have to hype myself up\nfor um but i feel i feel like so many\nwomen get into relationships where\nthey're suppressing themselves and like\nor probably men too you know like and i\njust i'm i'm so about like living as\nopenly and freely and truthfully as\npossible um because that's where i feel\nlike the magic sets the creativity sits\nlike that's where there's an abundance\nof of all of it um so i think it's so\nimportant to like push yourself to get\nthere that is a beautiful thing to end\non like that is such a great\nlike grounding\nfor us to throw into the world uh\nvanessa as i said before i'm so grateful\nfor your time i'm so
