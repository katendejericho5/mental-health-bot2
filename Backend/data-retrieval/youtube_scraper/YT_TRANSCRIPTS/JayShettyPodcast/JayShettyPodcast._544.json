    "transcript": "any time you do something that makes\nyour brain or your body evolve it will\ninvolve discomfort but suffering comes\nwhen you resist the discomfort when i\ntest my brain on the neuroscience stuff\nfrom my neuroscience company i have the\nresponse time in my brain of a 20 year\nold and it linearly goes up with age and\npart of the superhuman the anti-aging\nthing no i've got the data it shows i\nhave a 20 year old's brain and it's\nawesome because i can keep up otherwise\ni wouldn't that's incredible i can't\nwait to test that out i'd love to see\nhow old my brain is\nwhose brain has fascinated you the most\nthat you've tested whose brain is well i\nmean a lot of times i there's\nconfidentiality this is 40 years of zen\nit doesn't have to tell me who it is got\nit yeah don't tell me who it is okay so\nso this is a\nneuroscience institute five-day\nintensive program in seattle custom\nhardware software all this clinical\ngrade stuff to see what's going on in\nthere and then to performance tune in\nlike a race car for your brain\nand\ni mean we've had some of those spiritual\nleaders from south america come through\none of the guys really fascinating\nactually he's public about this dr barry\nmorgelon he's one of 12 living\ngrand masters of lao tzu's oral heritage\nand he's spoken at the bulletproof\nconference and uh just a good friend\nbeen on the show a couple times\nso this guy is doctor strange literally\nhe went to the the monastery they\ninterviewed him before they wrote doctor\nstrange and\nhe he just has these abilities it works\nwith tony robbins and works with me\nbefore i go on stage and things like\nthat and some presidents of countries\nkind of guy\nso you look at his brain waves\nthis is not a normal human being and\nsome guys like him\nif he turns it up all the way he'll fuzz\nout the gear\nliterally you're looking at the brain\nwaves and all that stuff and all of a\nsudden you can't get a clean signal yeah\nand this is something intrinsic in our\nbiology talk about real superhumans\nyou look at the people who are way\noutliers those are where the most\ninteresting thing happens because how do\nwe take you and me and how do we turn up\nour abilities to do that because we all\nhave that in us\nand that was one of the reasons i want\nto write this book it might take a few\ndecades\nso you're going to need more decades or\nyou might cheat that's you know what i'm\ndoing on the neuroscience framework\ni love that yeah no i i'm excited to\nshare because uh when my books come out\ni've got a ton of research on the minds\nof monks so you know we have a lot of\nsimilarities there and i'm fascinated by\nhow amongst meditations can switch uh\nlike you're saying on and off like a\nswitch you know just from compassion to\nempathy to to focus to discipline\nwithout even a second of warm up and\nwe've been studying this for 30 40 years\nbut traditional neuroscience is all\nabout seizures and surgery and things\nlike that\nbut\nnow in the neurofeedback category\nwe know\nwhat's a carrier wave we know what's\nhappening down at delta we know what's\nhappening alpha in a meditator versus a\nmonk and the reason that my program is\n40 years of zen is it's meant to replace\n40 years of daily practice of meditation\nbecause hurry meditate faster there's\nnothing wrong with that\nthat's incredible and have you see how\nhow have you seen the results compare\nit it's\nridiculous\nwhat you end up with if you were to\nspend all that time studying and i've\nbeen to tibet to learn meditation from\nthe masters in fact i\nfirst had yak butter tea which was the\ninspiration for bulletproof coffee in\ntibet when i was there to learn\nmeditation and i was like wait what this\nstuff is more powerful\nsomething just happened with this weird\nmixing tea or makes me butter and things\nbut\nyou look at what happens there is well\nyou learn you know there's seven layers\nof hell and all this wisdom and\ndepending on whether you're looking at a\nhindu perspective or a buddhist\nperspective or you know there's other\ntraditional chinese things or there's\neuropean so there's all these lineages\nand heritage and shamanic training and\nall these things and i've had a chance\nto to\nlearn some of those\nbut there's wisdom and then there's the\nfelt state\nand what you can do is you can achieve\nthe felt state using the tools of\nbreathing tools and meditation tools of\nneurofeedback and you can be there but\nwithout at least some guidance\nyou might not know where you are you\njust know it feels really different and\nyou can kind of blow your mind open yeah\nabsolutely yeah and i've noticed that i\nthink for a lot of people\nwho come from non-spiritual traditions\nor backgrounds a lot of this is great\nalso just giving them a window into the\nfact that this exists yeah and it's\npossible and i think the felt state is a\nmuch more tangible experience for them\nto believe that it's not just some\nelusive thing but it's it's real yeah i\ndidn't believe any of this i'm a\ncomputer science computer hacker weighed\n300 pounds come up from a family of\nengineers and anyone who believed this\nis clearly stupid that's how i was\nraised yeah and when you feel something\nthere's a signal in here that might be\nuseful and you realize it's actually not\njust useful it's hackable and you can\nchoose the felt state and you can use\nthat to sense the world around you and\nto connect with people and things it was\na pretty big awakening for me but it's\npart of the path and what i discovered\nand the reason i went down the\nbulletproof path at the same time doing\nthe 40 years of zen\nif you want to do personal development\nyou want to meditate you want to improve\nyour brain\ndoing it on french fries doesn't it\ndoesn't work you have to get your\nbiology in order because if your cells\ndon't make energy it's subcellular\ncomponents that drive most of your felt\nstate and if they're running a half\npower how are you gonna have enough\nenergy to you know wake up you know have\nwhatever you have in the morning\ntake care of of yourself take care of\nyour family your community oh and had\ntime and energy left over to do the deep\npersonal work too if you let go of a\nchildhood thing or\nyou know reach a new state of\nperformance no you were too tired\nbecause your cells didn't work so eat\nright\nand then do the meditative practice and\nyou'll get more results in less time and\nyou went through that experience too\nright because you were 22 300 pounds\nthat was 300 pounds yeah exactly tell us\nabout that journey just before we dive\ninto all of this incredible insight tell\nus about that journey and transition of\nwhen you came to the point where you\nwere like\nthere is more out there but even before\nthat this what i'm doing to my biology\nisn't good for me\nwell it's really weird anyone who's fat\nwill will tell you at some level they\nknow they're fat because we have a\nmirror you don't need a scale\nmy pants keep getting tight what do i do\nhere and then you say well i'm going to\ntry to do something and trying to do\nsomething is already presupposing\nfailure it's i call it a weasel word in\nmy books\nand\nwhat you end up\nwith is you say all right i'm going to\ndo what's supposed to work and anyone\nwho's ever read anything says oh we must\nbe meat robots therefore it's calories\nand calories out so i did that i worked\nout for an hour and a half a day\nsix days a week for 18 months was that\nhard\nof course it was hard and although\nexercise is addictive when you do it\nlike that you get the endorphins you get\na rush from it so it's hard to stop\nexercising and you there i know people\nare addicted like\ni can't do anything i gotta go exercise\nthat's not a healthy state yeah right\nthat means you're you're stuck with the\nendorphins the runner's high or whatever\nand for me i went on a low fat low\ncalorie diet and at the end of this\ni still weighed 300 pounds i could max\nout the machines it wasn't 300 pounds of\nmuscle i was covered in flab i still was\na 46 inch waist i'm a 33 inch waist\nright now\nand\ni i just i looked around and said maybe\nit's because i'm eating too much lettuce\nthat was my math\nit's because i'm not trying hard enough\nyeah\nand\nseriously all my friends are eating\ndouble western bacon cheeseburgers and\ni'm eating the salad with no chicken and\nno dressing and i'm hungry just so\nhungry and i'm just putting all my\nwillpower into this and i don't care if\ni'm sick i don't care if i have final\nexams i'm gonna go to the gym\nand\njust the sense of failure but it became\na self-worth problem\nand then i said\none day\ni'm actually doing all this\nand i'm not getting the results it must\nbe\nwhat i'm doing doesn't work and then you\nstart digging in the research and i\nstarted trying all the different\nvariations on diets and went really deep\non the corners of the internet and this\nis back in the late 90s people didn't\nuse the internet for this kind of stuff\nbut i'd find\nweird researchers and i would just test\nit all because i was\ncomputer science i'm building the\ninternet as we know it i'm pretty sure\nthat i should be able to just hack this\ndumb meat body\nand\nthe idea of hacking is that you can take\ncontrol of a system you can manipulate\nit without understanding what's inside\nyou test inputs and outputs\nso all right\nthat actually works really well in\nbiology but it's not what medicine does\nit's a different thing it's what\nbodybuilders do it's what the anti-aging\ncommunity does it's what navy seals do\nand that's what people who own\nracehorses due to their racehorses so\nhow do we apply that to ourselves\nand i said all right i'm going to get\nover this childhood i've had arthritis\nmy knees since i was 14.\nand it i found out later when i reverse\nengineered it all i lived in a house\nthat had toxic mold and i poisoned the\nmitochondria in my body so i repaired\nthat damage and i said wait there's\nthere's always new levels\nthings i can do where i didn't think i'd\ni'd look the way i look i'd feel the way\ni feel i'd be able to do what i do\nand\ni can and i'm continuously getting\npowerful and younger and faster my brain\nworks better\ni just mentioned about ping pong to see\nthe actual data and to see the scan oh i\nhave 87th percentile hippocampal volume\nhippocampus in the brain\nlook i started out fat and sick if i can\ndo this i'm pretty sure that someone who\nstarted out reasonably healthy with a\nnormal body weight and normal biology\nhas huge advantages but everyone\nlistening to this right now\nyou're thinking okay\nhow i feel now how i've always felt\nthat's pretty much normal but you're\ntotally wrong that's just what you've\nexperienced but if you could feel five\ntimes better and 10 times more energy\nyou would never know because you never\nfelt it 100 so our job is to just teach\npeople here's the tools to tap into it\nin the least possible amount of time and\nmoney\nbecause it's there and it feels like\nthat's the energy that experimentation\nthat stage has led to now this\ndecision or aspiration to live to 1 8\n180 years old like why why\nwhy 180 specifically because i'm sure\nthere's some math behind that i'm\nassuming and and why\nwhy want to live longer anyway for you\nnow it's at least 180. i don't want to\nput a cap on it okay important\ndifference there right okay\nnow\nthe math is really straightforward we\nknow we can do 120 because we've seen it\nand those people they drank they smoked\nthey went through\nsee what was happening 120 years ago\nit was\n1900.\nthere's no cars they haven't been\ninvented yet\nthere's no microwaves world war one\nworld war ii haven't happened\nantibiotics haven't been discovered\ndna\nthey couldn't even spell it back then\nyeah\ntrue\nthe krebs cycle for america we didn't\nknow much at all about how our bodies\nwork and they still left 120. yeah okay\nbut they weren't exposed to as much\ntrauma as we are oh no they had more\ntrauma than we did\nexposure they had more trauma literally\nin the world yeah but not necessarily\nexposure on a daily basis do you know\nthe odds of having one of your siblings\ndie 120 years ago\nthe reason you had five or six kids is\nbecause a couple of them weren't gonna\nmake it\nlike a redundant array of inexpensive\nkids they invented it back then in fact\nwe invented that in society back then so\npeople grew up with their family members\ndying you didn't know if anyone come\nhome you can call them on their cell\nphone someone gets on a boat they don't\ncome back you don't maybe you'll get a\nletter three months later people\ndisappeared all the time it was a pretty\nshitty time oh we didn't even talk about\npolio we talked about all the diseases\nthat just white people out that\ngenerally don't get us anymore\nyou go to the doctor they're gonna cut\nyour arm off with a rusty saw\nlike this is the state of people who\nlived 120 now\nnow\ni'm just going to have to say it how old\nare you i'm 32. 32 all right so let's\nthink what it's gonna be like 120 years\nfrom now given that we can rely on the\ninternet we can look at pubmed i\ncouldn't write these books each of the\nbooks the superhuman book would have\nbeen a lifetime of research in a library\nusing microfichian card catalogs all\nthis crap but the fact that i can pull\ntogether this information and i have the\nweird brain that synthesizes it and i\ncan talk to these experts all of this is\nenabled by technology in the last 20\nyears\ndo you think that we can't add 50 to the\nmaximum human lifespan over the next\n150 for you 148 years\nlike put on your future hat and realize\nexponential rates of growth\nyou have a very good chance of living\nway way way beyond 180 if there's still\nsoil on the planet\nif a comet doesn't hit us\nright and if essentially we take care of\nthe world enough\nso that that that's the big one that's\nthe taking care of the world enough but\nhere's the other reason that we need\nmore highly energetic old people\nin all societies that i studied and it's\nin like the first chapter of superhuman\ni talk about the quest for immortality\nis a something that's happened as long\nas we've had recorded history going back\nto the egyptians going back to the\nalchemists going back to the hindu\ntraditions the chinese traditions of\nsouth american traditions they've all\nbeen searching for this\nand things like taoism are tied directly\ntowards that quest for how do i live\nforever as a highly functioning highly\nenergetic evolved person\nwell we've always had village elders so\nwhat would happen is the young monks\nwould go into the monastery and the 80\nyear old llama will look at them and say\nall right here's what we've learned and\ni learned this from my elders and i\nlearned it from my elders in fact lao\nzoo's tradition 5 000 years of unbroken\noral history passed down from the elders\nwell elders today unfortunately a lot of\nthem alzheimer's disease heart attacks\nretirement homes and we started seeing\nour elders rather than as sources of\nknowledge and wisdom the people who can\nguide us the best we started seeing them\nas\ntubes monitors diapers wheelchairs and\nexpenses\nand that's actually never happened\nyeah all of history doesn't happen great\nobservation so i go out of my way to\ninterview people who are over 90.\nbecause man they've got you know 50\nyears on me\nand what did they learn that i'm\nprobably going to learn and what can\nthey what pain can i avoid from\nlistening to them yeah would i like them\nto be 120 and still have fully\nfunctioning vibrant lives so i could\nlearn even more and they could share it\nheck yeah well the world needs that plus\njay if you're going to live for hundreds\nof years more\nyou aren't going to throw the plastic\nbottle in the ocean you realize oh my\ngod i better not in my own sandbox\nbecause i'm going to be in the sandbox\nfor a very long time i'm not going to\nhand it off to the next generation the\nway currently the boomers are getting\nblamed and it's funny because the\nboomers are saying well wait we\ninherited world war one and world war ii\nfrom you old people but they're all dead\nso we can't blame you anymore we just\nkeep going back and back yeah and\nthey're saying we inherited this from\nyou know the civil war it just it goes\nit goes back forever we always inherit\nthis but the scope of inheritance is\ngoing to change and anyone who has kids\nis unlikely to say you know i'd like to\nhave kids three times throughout my 200\nyears they're you're gonna have kids\nyou're gonna put so much energy and life\ninto them the way all parents do right\nyou're going to enjoy seeing them\nflourish but we're not going to worry\nabout an overpopulation problem and the\ndata supports i'm saying very very\nclearly\njapan u.s most western countries the\nbirth rate's gone down populations are\ndeclining and so is the fertility rate\nso we don't have to worry about global\npopulation just wait 50 years it won't\nbe a problem i've been three i'm\nfascinated i'm fascinated the reason is\nbecause it's we're talking about also\nand i i want to get your thoughts on\nthis because i think we were talking\nabout different things there you're\ntalking about obviously the the physical\nabilities have increased but with the\nrise of mental health yeah even even if\nit is with less trauma\nthe way we're able to process traumatic\nevents or tragedy tragedies or\nchallenges\nseems to be struggling\nit's funny i'm just intrigued i'm just\nyeah i'm just throwing it out there\ni'm not negative at all i'm just\ntrying to it doesn't sound negative\nyou ever there's a documentary uh\nthat come out they came out recently\ncalled they shall not grow old\nit's about world war one\noh my god the toughness the resilience\nof of these guys\nit's unimaginable in the interview\npeople who are still alive from world\nwar one but they show footage and they\nthey tell these stories and you're\nsaying no human walk in the face of the\nearth today could do what these guys did\nexactly so isn't that a challenge in\nlasting longer because if the resilience\nand grit was so much more higher then\nthat people could lose their family\nmember their family member never came\nback from the boat but they never did\nthey have the mental health challenge\nthey never talked about it they know\nthey couldn't share on social media like\nor did they just not did they just not\nfeel it whereas today we're\nreally sensitive and you felt it but how\nyou felt just didn't matter as much it\nwas how you showed up in the world so\nthey would cram it down i don't know how\nhappy they were there's war veterans\npeople knew that people came back from\nwar changed but there's also there was a\ncommunity and there's something else\nthat happens\nmost of the time if you took a big hit\nto the head you just died so now we have\na lot more traumatic brain injury and\npeople who survive horrific injuries who\ncome back with more trauma but our\ntechnologies for dealing with trauma\neven some of the neuroscience stuff the\nthings that are a big focus for me at 40\nyears of zen and you deal with\nnutritionally you put them in a\nhyperbaric chamber you can heal almost\nany emotional trauma and so many\nphysical traumas the problem is when a\nphysical trauma ties to an emotional\ntrauma\nit doesn't work you can also\nprecondition people a lot a lot of times\npeople just don't know about the\nresearch\nsomething called heart rate variability\nit's a core part of what what i teach\npeople this is how to change the spacing\nbetween your heartbeats\nwhen you're relaxed in a meditative\nstate you have a higher\nchange in the spacing between your\nheartbeats same number of beats per\nminute but the pattern of the beats\nchanges\nwell if you teach soldiers to do this\nbefore they go into combat or kids\nbefore they get bullied it doesn't\nreally matter if your body thinks it's\nthe same thing\nyou actually don't walk away from that\nwith ptsd yes you can precondition for\nit so what we can do is we can teach\nresilience and i wasn't necessarily\nhighly resilient but i am now\nand\nthis is just missing from our curriculum\ncorrect it is a neuroscience state it's\nit's\nyou can define it you can measure it you\ncan quantify it and then you can put a\nmoral judgment on it yes there there\nshouldn't be a moral judgment yeah i\nyeah you know you used to be able to you\ngo to church and you know you've been\nbad right or what whatever the the\npattern of your church was but people\nnow are abandoning religion religion\nprovided some of that the the prayer\nbefore your meal you don't have to pray\nto a specific deity that someone told\nyou had to but you can provide a sense\nof gratitude\nwhich is the real nugget there\nwithout gratitude you can't do\nforgiveness without gratitude you stay\nin fight or flight so you can program\nthese things in but what does grudge\nshould actually look like in the brain\nand in the heart you can measure those\nand you can look i can sit here across\nfrom you if you're wired up and i can\nsay you're actually not feeling grateful\nyou said you were grateful and you lied\nto yourself\nand hold you accountable to that that is\nthat's amazing yeah right that too yeah\ni love that too and i and i hope that\none day we can all have that next one so\nwe know we're not lying to ourselves\nbecause it's fun being a light detective\nfor other people but that's better being\na lie detector for ourselves and that's\nwhy we have coaches that's why we have\ngurus that's where we have friends yes\nthe problem is that you're very likely\nto get angry at a friend or a coach when\nthey really call you out on your bs\ncan't get angry at your phone yeah yeah\nhow about that right where are you going\nthe data is the data yeah and that's\nwhat i do it's one of the most important\nimpactful things in my life has been the\n40 years of zen training\nwhere\nwhen i do that\nif there's something that i'm hiding\nfrom myself i'm not gonna know it i'm\ngonna look you in the eye i'm gonna deny\nit and you're gonna do the same thing to\nme because our ability to look inside\nourselves is very low but when you have\na mirror right here oh i have spinach in\nmy teeth yeah but you're not going to\nknow you have spinach in your teeth your\nfriends will tell you unless they're\nreally close to you exactly what i love\nabout you though when i'm hearing you\nspeak and and i've never\ni guess i guess you don't when you meet\nsomeone you you unearth things\ndifferently and it's like\nyou really have this great juxtaposition\nbetween wisdom and science which i think\nis so powerful and beautiful and you\nstart it off there and i think when it's\neither raw it can get\nslightly lost sometimes they have to\nalign yeah and one of the reasons i i\ncreated this field of biohacking and\nit's now a word in the dictionary in\n2018 they added it to merriam-webster's\nand my name's in there\nand i created this big conference around\nit as i wanted\nto take the data that we can now get for\nthe first time ever things about that\nhurricane neuroscience and something\ncalled the exposome which is the measure\nof all the things you're exposed to in\nyour environment over the course of your\nlife that changes your genetics\nit's a data set we'll never actually\ncollect all of it it's like a real a\nfull-size map of california isn't very\nuseful because it's as big as the state\nright yes\nbut we're able to gather so much data\nthat we can now\nvalidate things like in uh the book\nbefore superhuman i wanted to test a\ntaoist equation\nthe these guys are looking to live\nforever and they say flat out if you're\na guy and you want to live forever you\nshould use this equation to control how\nfrequently you ejaculate because it'll\nmake you old if you ejaculate too much\nand i looked at that and i said that's\ncomplete bs i have to test it and\ndisprove this bs and i ended up\npublishing a year's worth of data and i\ninterviewed other experts in the field\nand it turns out for guys there really\nis an orgasm hangover\nright and\nyou're saying what i'm not saying i have\nless sex i'm just saying decide how\noften you're going to ejaculate\ni would have said the data would not\nsupport that and what i'm finding is the\nmore i dig deep in in shamanic knowledge\nand you say how could that possibly work\nand then i go and i i look at the\nneuroscience of it like oh my god these\npeople couldn't using our language in\nour tech they couldn't explain it\ncorrect four out of time but they\nlearned by watching for generations and\ntheir elders handed it off and handed it\noff and one of the coolest things i can\nthink of in this space the lady who\ndiscovered the opiate receptor in the\nbrain massive transformative thing her\nname was candace pert and i'm sad she\npassed away right before i could\ninterview her\nand in her book she writes about how\nafter\nmaybe 20 years of her career just being\nhardcore western scientist atheist just\nyou're rejecting anything that might be\nenergetic she started realizing maybe i\nhave to pay attention to this because\nthere's something else going on\nand she met this group of shamans\nand she tried to explain to them what\nthe opiate receptors were and the guy\nsays something and they all laugh and\nthen she asked the translator and the\nthe translator said oh they're laughing\nbecause they said ha ha she thinks these\nmolecules actually exist\ni think they're both\nyeah yeah oh wow it's crazy tell me\nabout talking about that tell me about\nthe so you did 120 000\nstealth makeover oh the stem cell\nmakeover that was with uh dr harry\nadelson in park city break down what\nthat is and why you're doing okay so\nthat people understand a bit more about\nit and i write about the details of stem\ncells and what's happening now and what\nyou can get for five thousand dollars\nversus in this case 120 000 is at the\nvery high end of what's possible it's\nthe most intensive stem cell procedure\nthat you can do right now\nwhat i did is i laid down they put you\nunder a sedation but not full anesthesia\nand\nthey pull bone marrow and people go oh\nit's so painful i had it done when i was\nunsedated it's not that big of a deal it\njust feels really odd i even facebooked\nit uh of a facebook live video you\nfacebook lived this yeah yeah i didn't i\ncouldn't do the uh this procedure\nbecause i was unconscious but the one\nbefore that that i did just to see what\nthe components would be\nand i've done stem cells you know a\nvariety of times different technologies\nthat are that are out here and\nthey pull the bone marrow they pull your\nown fat\nthey can get the stem cells out of it\nand then they go through and depending\non which part of the body starting at\nthe toes every joint they inject stem\ncells into the joints so the joints will\nstay young i'm going to be around for\nhundreds of years so i would like to be\nwalking around under my own power i've\nhad three knee surgeries before i was 23\nand so i want my knee to be highly\nfunctional forever i don't want to be in\na cane when i'm old\nand then johns hopkins neurosurgeon\nwho's been on my show marcela she\nshe flies out for it and she threads a\ncannula inside the spine so they drip my\nown stem cells inside my spine and they\nare attracted to areas that are inflamed\nand they turn off inflammation and turn\non growth wow so they inject every\nvertebra they do the face hair uh male\nreproductive organs\nand i i facebook live that when they did\nanother time too that was funny without\nshowing anything you can't unsee\nand\nyou wake up four hours later i started\ngoing what just happened but the\nregrowth and the the rejuvenation\nhappens six nine months later as\nthe tissues themselves turn over and you\nget younger it's that's at the very\ncutting edge but if you just have a lot\nof knee pain or an injury that won't\nheal i did all that stuff three years\nago with stem cells i had this thing in\nmy right shoulder it's gone\nall these things throughout my body that\nyou accumulate over time you know when\nwe're young we go i'll go mountain\nbiking sure you know i'll play soccer\nand even though there's a piece of bone\nfragment sticking out my thigh just one\nmore ring absolutely yeah and you pay\nfor it later and then you can reverse it\nand that's what i did that's incredible\nwhat level of when you when i'm hearing\nthat someone who's not had any of those\nprocesses and i'm speaking on behalf of\nmost of the audience ideas have not done\nthat what level of risk are you\ncomfortable with or have you researched\nthis to so much of a depth that actually\nwhen you do this you're like i'm not\nexperimenting at all because there's\nvery little risk like what level of risk\ndo you feel comfortable with i i talk\nabout return on investment as the\nprimary lens i'm looking i look for for\nanything i do there's how much energy do\ni put into doing something and then\nthere's how much time and there's how\nmuch money do i put into it and then\nwhat's the return i'm looking for and\ndying is the return i'm not looking for\nthe problem is that\nif you just do what you're doing now\nyour risk is probably 80\nthat one of the four killers from\nsuperhuman are going to get you it's\ncardiovascular disease\ncancer\nalzheimer's disease or type 2 diabetes\nso you pretty much have an 80 chance of\ndoing those\nyeah\nand that comes those all come with 20\nplus years of suffering before you die\nand you're not in charge of yourself\nwhen you die\nso\nthose are crappy odds absolutely the\nworst odds ever\nso how willing are you to take a few\nrisks to avoid that i'm willing to take\na few risks but they're not stupid risks\nokay i'm in a room i've got one of the\ntop trained neurosurgeons out there\ndoing a procedure the risks are\nexceptionally low when you have that i'm\nnot doing anesthesia i'm doing sedation\nso the risks are low and the returns are\nmore energy now more energy for the\ndecades more time i'm going to live and\nas i age i will age differently than\nbaseline human models\nand that is very precious and if there's\na risk of one in\nfifty thousand of something really bad\nhappening\none in fifty thousand maybe it's one in\nten thousand i don't know but i will\ntell you that if you're popping advil\nright now you're facing those same kind\nof risks we're all facing risks all the\ntime we don't know about because we\nnever hit totally in fact i got to go\nback to those that bowl of french fries\nit causes more inflammation in your body\nthan smoking a cigarette for a longer\nperiod of time\nyou probably ought to not do either one\nof those but most people listening to\nthis yeah i'm talking to you french\nfries taste good i'll eat them right\nhave you done the risk analysis on that\nbehavior no because it's normal and can\nwe talk about cancer and alcohol let's\ndo it yeah\njust go to pubmed which is the database\nof all these studies and look at the\nrelationship between drinking alcohol\nand cancer it is not good for you and\nyou're saying oh i'm so worried that i\ndo the stem cell procedure that could\nmake me feel really good and fix that\nthat that joint or that hip or that back\npain that they might want to fuse my\nspine for\ni'm going to go spend five thousand\ndollars doing that oh i could never do\nthat it's too risky it's too expensive\nyou spent five grand on wine this year\ncoffee yeah well i mean that's yeah\nstuff is worth i mean come on man\ni said that as a joke\nbut\nthat whole thing okay you spent that\nsame amount of money on something that\nwe know contributes to cancer right and\ni'm not picking on wine specifically\njust alcohol as it metabolizes increases\nyour risk by the way i actually had sake\nlast night it's like i never drink i can\ntell you i took supplements that turn\noff the negative effects of it when i\ndid that but you you can still enjoy\nlife but people are not very good at\ndoing risk math and when you look at\nthose two things you spent the same\namount of money on\nthings that are vaguely pleasurable and\nvaguely bad for you\nor you could have done something that\nwas a step up in your performance\ni know what i'm gonna choose i'm gonna\nskip the french fries i'm gonna\noccasionally have really good wine\nthat's expensive instead of a lot of\ncheap wine and i'm going to do the stem\ncells\nyeah yeah no any and it comes back down\nto what what we both know tiknot han\nsaid about wanting familiar pain versus\nunfamiliar pain yeah and we'd rather\nhave familiar pain of\neverything that our ancestors have had\nor family members who have had so we\nhave some familiarity with it whether\nthat's cancer or alzheimer's so we feel\noh yeah it's kind of something we've all\nhad we feel whereas the unfamiliar pain\nof i don't know what that looks like is\nso much more scary\neven though like you said very clearly\nand statistically that actually our odds\nare not good anyway and and that's\nthat's the uh that's the argument that\nthat hits me the most is that in so many\nareas of my life i'm convinced that the\nway we've always done it is is rarely\nthe right way well it one of the things\nyou learn if you if you go to any\nancient\npractice lineage look we're all going to\ndie and even when i talk to my\nimmortalist friends you know the super\nlong job i'm going to upload myself to\nthe internet news flash the universe\nwill collapse in on itself sometimes\nwe're all going to die you just have to\nget used to that yeah and a lot of\npeople oh i don't want to sorry that's\njust a fact of life\nthe question is how much suffering do\nyou want to do before you die that's\nreally what we're doing and for me i\nactually don't like suffering it's\namazing but\ndiscomfort is different than suffering\nso anytime you do something that makes\nyour brain or your body evolve it will\ninvolve discomfort but suffering comes\nwhen you resist the discomfort\nand understanding all right i'm feeling\na lot of emotional discomfort right now\nbut it doesn't mean i'm suffering\ndoesn't mean i'm struggling it means i'm\naccepting and all right it's a signal so\ni'm lifting this heavy thing i'm really\nsore the next day that was the cost of\ngrowth or i'm facing my fears and i'm\ndoing it anyway and i feel like i'm\ngoing to my pants and i'm going to\ndo it anyway and i'm going to see what\nhappens that's how our brain evolves\nwe're wired to do to focus on things\nthat don't push us yes because that's\nbiology yes well once you decide you're\ngoing to take charge and you're going to\npush yourself you say all right maybe i\nwill live to 180 maybe i'll live beyond\n180. or maybe i'll just you know ask\nsomeone out who i'm really afraid to ask\nwhy the hell are you afraid to ask\nsomeone out the worst they'll do is say\nno\nit's the same as saying look do you like\npizza or chinese okay if they say i like\npizza like darn i'd like chinese we're\nnot compatible it's not a judgment on\nyou but if you don't ask you don't know\nyeah but people think of all this crazy\nprogramming in their heads i got rid of\nmost of my crazy programming just\nthrough these these processes\nand\ni don't think i could have the\nthe power to do that if i hadn't have\njust gotten my base biology working with\nfood and so\nwe get wrapped up in all these fears and\nresistance things but really the\nsimplest low-hanging fruit here is just\neat the stuff that makes your brain work\nand then you'll start being comfortable\npushing yourself otherwise you're just\ntoo tired to push yourself absolutely\nlet's talk about i want to talk about\nthe seven pillars that make us all okay\nbut before we do that let's talk about\nbecause you mentioned it now some of the\nfoods that are good for our brain that\nare basic that anyone can start doing\ntoday and which ones to remove too\nbecause we've already got the\nthe fries out okay\nanything deep fried and it doesn't\nmatter if it's brussels sprouts sorry\nespecially at a restaurant and i've i've\ngot the bulletproof coffee shop in ellie\nit's a restaurant i know what happens\nback at the house and i we don't have\nbad oils there but the typical\nrestaurant uses the same oil for a long\nperiod of time\noxidized just plant oils are not good\nfor us our cell membranes and i go\nthrough really cool new science in in uh\nsuperhuman 45 of the cell membranes in\nyour body are saturated fats and the\nbrain militantly holds that constant but\nthe amount of unsaturated fat can change\ndramatically between omega-3 which is\nmore of a fish oil and omega-6 which is\nthe plant-based ones so if you only eat\nplants you don't get omega-3s the kind\nthat come from not plant-based omega-3s\nthose don't work unfortunately you end\nup changing about\n15 of your of your brain cells into\nthese highly inflammatory things so you\ntune the very composition of your being\nby choosing the kind of fat you eat you\neat french fries your body will take\ndamaged unnatural fats that have never\nbeen a part of your system and it'll try\nto build batteries out of those and\nyou'll get batteries that make half\ncharge and then you walk around going\nhmm\ni you know i wonder what's going on this\nis just kind of how i feel yeah i got a\nlittle bit of a muffin top here but what\nyou really have is you have a muffin top\nin your brain\nso the inflammation happens there so\na big part of what i do is i'm eating at\nleast half my calories from fat and\nusually 70\nbut i'm very careful the fats i eat are\nundamaged i eat a moderate amount of\nplant-based fats i don't eat omega-6\nfats much at all you're still going to\nget a lot of them because they're out\nthere but i'm careful to get fish oil\nwhich is really really good for you you\ncan do it by eating fish if you're going\nto eat fish you want to take something\nthat binds mercury in the fish\nand i make supplements that that have\nspecific kinds of oils that go into the\nbrain but the real\nreally good fats that come from plants\nmacadamia nuts avocados and coconut oil\nis one of those things where you say all\nright it's good for you it is\nto a certain\nevery kind of fat including coconut oil\nit's a whole bunch of different types of\nfats mixed together different lengths of\nchains of fats\nand people have heard mct oils because i\nthink i put mct oils on the map right it\nturns out that 52 of coconut oil is mct\noils so then\nan unscrupulous market will say yeah i'm\nselling mct oils\nbad news about 40 of the fat and that's\n90 percent of the mct oil and coconut\noil\nit's legal to call it an mct oil but it\ndoesn't have the special powers for\nturning on your brain and mitochondria\nso now you say wait this is labeled mct\noil and this is labeled mct oil but they\ndo very different things so yeah you can\nuse some coconut oil as a fat source as\na fuel source but you can't eat enough\nof it in fact it would take 20 pounds of\ncoconut oil to equal one pound of the\nstuff that i make\nand\nso it's everclear versus weak beer it\nyeah is so\nit's it's important to say eat some\ncoconut oil but a huge amount of\nsaturated fat like from coconut oil if\nyour gut bacteria is broken will bring\ntoxins from your gut into your brain\ninto your body\nso then okay\nwhat else do i eat it turns out the\ntemplate for this is called the\nbulletproof diet it is a plate covered\nin vegetables and it's really important\nit's not covered in grains it's not\ncovered in legumes it's not covered in\npotatoes it's covered in vegetables okay\ngreen stuff and it's probably not\ncovered in kale either\nall right kale has a whole bunch of\nanti-nutrients in it and i write about\nthallium a toxic metal that accumulates\nbetter in kale than any other plant\nwe've ever found\nso\nwe're talking broccoli cauliflower\ncelery fennel carrots stuff like that\nand then you cover it in fat guacamole\ngrass-fed butter\nthings like that nuts olives olive oil\nand i want to say cover it you don't\nhave to go liberally it's not a little\nbit of sauce no you want to soak it in\nthat fat\nand then\na moderate amount of grass-fed or wild\ncaught protein most people eat way too\nmuch protein from animals and i'm\ntalking two maybe four ounces and the\nanti-aging numbers it turns out you want\nto eat less meat than you think\nyou want to eat\nbut if you go to zero meat i know you're\nyou're plant-based but\num what you end up finding is that\npeople today\nand most people listen to your show\nthey don't really say they care but they\ndon't really care about where the animal\nthey eat came from so we are supporting\nthe death of the planet by eating\nindustrially raised feedlot animals i do\nnot eat those i never eat those they\nwill make you old they'll make you fat\nand they'll make you sick they'll\ndestroy your gut bacteria and along the\nway they're destroying the very soil of\nour planet so feedlot meat is off the\nmap and then people say but i can't\nafford it like that's bs\nif grass-fed meat is twice as expensive\neat half as much which is going to make\nyou live longer anyway so your budget\nwill not change if you do this but what\nwill happen is you go to a restaurant\nyou say is it grass fed and they say no\nyou say that and i'll order the\nvegetarian right and then you can say is\nit grass finished and if it's grass-fed\nand grass-finished you've done the\nplanet of favor the animal actually led\na life that it was supposed to live\nright and you've contributed to soil and\nyou eat a moderate amount of that and\nyou feel really good and one of the\nnutrients that's been missing that was a\nhuge game changer for me was collagen\nand the reason collagen is cool right\nnow bulletproof put that on the map\nand\nwe're now the second largest collagen\nbrand out there\nthe\nreason collagen is so important is that\nfor me i had this arthritis in my knees\nand i always had soreness it went away\nwhen i started eating collagen and on\nthat same trip to tibet where i\ndiscovered yak butter tea i'd say i\ndiscovered it it depends about for a\nthousand years but i tried it and\ndiscovered how i felt on it\num i had wrecked my knees i descended 7\n500 feet\nfrom the annapurna base camp area in one\nday and i my knees were bruised the\ncartilage was bruised i already had\npre-existing injuries and screws on my\nknees and stuff i couldn't walk like to\ngo across the street to get a cup of\ncoffee it was like you know two two\ncanes and i felt like i was 100 years\nold\ni had seven days\nuntil i was going to be able to recover\nenough to walk 26 miles around mount\nkailash\nand\ni just asked the guy on the bus with me\ni said all right can you read this\nchinese menu to me at this little\ntibetan roadhouse the only restaurant in\ntown\nand i'm looking for collagen because i\nknew from the anti-aging work i'd been\ndoing i needed some building blocks just\nto fix my knees and you couldn't buy\ncollagen powder back then it plus into\nbed and i wouldn't have it so i ordered\nthe only thing on the menu that's going\nto work it's a bowl of pig's ears\nnow i've never eaten that before and i\nknow it looks like and it arrives and\nit's chilled and it's literally a big\nbowl of maybe 15\ncold pig's ears and i'm just going this\nis really unpleasant but i'm in pain so\ni\nlike what can i do here i said i got the\nsoup and i dip them in the soup to heat\nthem up and it was like our\nman crunchy no they were soft they're\nlike steamed and just sitting there\nbut you know what\nthe next day i could walk it was that\nbig of a deal i just my body was trying\nto heal and i did not have the nutrients\ni needed to heal and now i want to hear\npeople who add collagen to their diet\nwhether it's in their coffee whether\nit's on their things on their food it's\nkind of a flavorless powder when it's\ndone right or it tastes like socks if\nit's done wrong\nwhat ends up happening is the pain i've\nhad for 10 years in my ankle my knee my\nback it just went away and my hair is\ngoing stupidly fast i have to dye it\nmore often and things like that i hear\nthat from women all the time they like\nit though because they want a thicker\nhair they got it but now that they're\ngoing to the the salon more than they\ndid so those are important nutrients and\nthen you say all right there are people\nwho are saying i want to be plant-based\nand you know you're one of those now why\nwhy are you plant-based is this an\nethics thing or a health thing both all\nright got it so ethically\nas a guy who runs a 32 acre organic farm\nwith turkeys and pigs and sheep\nwhere is the fur where's the fertility\nin the soil that makes your vegetables\nsupposed to come from if we don't have\nanimals i mean factory farms for grains\nand corn and things like that what\nthey're doing is they're taking these\nminerals from a mine\nwhich this actually isn't really even a\nmineral nitrogen it's a nutrient they're\nputting in the soil well if they had\nanimals that would come in during winter\nand just crap on the soil the way they\ndo on my farm the soil would replenish\nitself and it would actually get thicker\nsoil's the biggest carbon sink we have\nright now it's getting thinner and\nthinner and thinner because we're\nbasically over driving the soil but\nwe're running out of the things we use\nto overdrive it so when you go to a\npermaculture model you don't eat very\nmuch meat but you might say take\nadvantage of ghee or butter but we're\ntalking about one or two cows on many\nacres that walk around and do their job\nmother nature designed sheeps and cows\nand ruminants to just walk around munch\non stuff and then poop\nand it's and they poop everywhere it's\nkind of horrifying as a farmer\nbut\ni have pictures showing this part of the\nthe the uh i'll call the lawn over the\npasture where they live it's vibrant and\ngreen without any\nwater being added and right next to it\nthe part where it was fenced off it's\ngray it's it's light brown\nthe only difference is the poop\nso you think about that go wow\nwhat does this mean on a global scale\nit means that if we go all plant-based\nthe very ecosystem that has supported\nfarms forever has always been based on\nanimals pooping on the farm\nit it ends\nand then we won't have nutrient based\nvegetables and you can actually pull off\na vegetarian diet and be pretty darn\nhealthy but the people are saying you\nknow i'm never eating anything that came\nnear an animal\nthey haven't thought through the system\nof it\nand\nuh having gotten actually quite sick on\na raw vegan diet even i'm pretty well\neducated on how to do that\nthere are some vegetables that don't\nwork for people\nright now vegetables that don't work raw\ntoo oh yeah exactly and cooking is an\nokay technology\nso\nyou know the nightshade family things\nlike bell peppers for some people they\nwork just fine and for other people they\nwill wreck you absolutely right and i'm\none of those i don't eat nightshades\nbecause i tested it i feel like crap\nyeah i feel like crap too yeah and so i\nwould say eat mostly like a vegan and\nthe fat you put on there doesn't have to\nbe vegan fat yeah but if it's\nindustrially raised fat shame on you\njust put it out there yeah it's great\nlet's let's talk about i i think that's\nbrilliant that's it it's what i love\nabout that\nis that i think\nand this is this is partly education too\nit's the way we make decisions are often\nnot stretched out enough we're not\nlooking at the\nsocietal community family we look at\nthings so small in one sense of just\nlike how it affects us and the four\npeople around us as opposed to how\nthings are affecting then i feel like\nyou're stretching our mind which is\nwonderful the idea is we should eat to\nfeel really good all the time and we\nshould eat to be here for hundreds of\nyears\nhow do we do that yeah yeah absolutely\nand the planet lasting which was your\npoint earlier of like everything else\nthat we're doing with factory farms is\nkilling the planet so there won't be any\nsoil to live hence we won't last to 180.\ntell us about the seven uh pillars\nthey're making some of you which you've\nkind of told us\nthis is interesting you go back 20 years\ni started running an anti-aging\nnonprofit group we we were doing\nresearch we had people coming in giving\nlectures in palo alto but we didn't\nreally know why we were aging we had\ndifferent ideas and they've now been\nso baked in based on\nreally good research using unimaginable\ndna visualization techniques the ability\nto to do things that are out of star\ntrek in terms of seeing inside our body\nand\nwe now know there's seven things that\nare making us hold and this is really\nimportant because a lot of times say\nwhat's the one thing i could do to live\na long time it's the same things what's\nthe one thing i could do to make my car\nlast a long time\ni'm pretty sure you got to rotate the\ntires and change the oil just just\nsaying yeah yeah might be a few other\nthings fuel filters and all that\nso the seven pillars of aging are the\nthings that we now know are the causes\nof aging and then the question is okay\nhow do you avoid this if aging is death\nby a thousand cuts how do i take less\ncuts how do i make the cuts less deep\nand then how do i heal them like\nwolverine instead of just slapping a\nband-aid on and if you do that that's\nthe road map to living to 180 and\nfeeling good along the way so let's look\nat what the seven pillars of aging are\nokay\nand one of the first ones is telomeres\nand people have often times heard about\nthis there's all kinds of tests you can\norder online that measure blood\ntelomeres which don't really reflect\ntissue levels that well but what we do\nknow is every time a cell divides it\nbasically takes one off a little string\nof counters and eventually you reach\nwhat's called the hayflick limit a cell\ncan't divide any more times because this\nlittle counter got\ncut down well all you got to do is find\nthe enzyme telomerase that lets you\nlengthen that\nand there you go one of the seven\npillars is handled and in the book i\nwrite about a couple things there's a\nvery expensive supplement there's some\nlifestyle things and there's a russian\npeptide a small string of amino acids\nyou can just inject twice a year that\nprobably has a bigger effect than\nanything else i like that one\nit's cheaper and it's faster now\nthere's also something called\nzombie cells and this is just just\nbecoming an early trend in anti-aging\nalthough the researchers looking at\nthese what the technical term is\nsenescent cells and these are cells that\ndon't die but they stop working so they\nsort of sit there and they make free\nradicals and they don't do anything and\nas you age you get more and more of\nthese over time so if you can\ndo something like oh fasting\nor these drugs one called rapamycin\nthat's really coming out for from\nresearch and there's a few other\ncompounds being tested there's another\ncompound from seaweed or strawberries\nthat i write about in the book that'll\ntell your body to kill the zombie cells\nget rid of them and guess what's going\nto grow to replace them young cells who\nwould have thought\nthere's extracellular stiffening which\nis outside of the cells become cellular\nstraight jackets in the book okay what's\ncausing that well we've all heard of\nbeta amyloid plaque as the cause of\nalzheimer's it's a symptom not a cause\nbut throughout your body when there's\ninflammation let's go back to eating\nindustrial meat let's go back to eating\nthe wrong vegetables let's go back to\neating sugar and fried stuff\nthese things that cause systemic\ninflammation cause almost cellular level\ncalluses or scarring and as that builds\nup over the course of decades you end up\nwith cells that can't move the way\nthey're supposed to so you got to remove\nthe stiffening and there's a set of\ntechniques to do that in the book\nand then we look at what happens when\nstuff builds up inside the cells\nimagine that inside every cell there's\nan incinerator\nand his job is to burn garbage\nwell what happens if you have an\nincinerator and you aren't allowed to\npull any ashes out so you need to burn\nsuper clean and then one day you just\ndecide to stick a bunch of glass and\nmetal in there it won't burn so the\nincinerator shuts down well this happens\ninside the cells all the time and so\nwhat if you ate less of the things and\ndid less of the things that clogged up\nyour incinerators and what if there's a\nway to get rid of the cells with broken\nincinerators\nthere are ways to do that\nthere's also extracellular garbage so\ninstead of inside the cell there's junk\noutside the cell that builds up over\ntime and one of the things i just did is\ni just did a\ndialysis\nlast week where they pull my blood out\nrun it through a special filter that\ngets rid of extracellular garbage and\nthen put my blood back in after it's\nclean this is different than kidney\ndialysis it's similar technology but the\nfiltration is entirely different it's an\nanti-aging technique that's just coming\nonline i did that up with dr matt cook\nwho's been on my show a few times\nand\nso i'm getting rid of this junk that's a\npretty extreme procedure there's other\nthings you can do like change how what\nyou eat is cooked if you're eating\nburned industrially raised meat like\nyou're so doing it wrong even burned\nveggies\nthank you yeah yeah these blackened\nbrussels sprouts stop already\nyou want to cook stuff with water you\nwant to steam it you grill it gently if\nyou're going to grill it and you'll find\na difference in how you age your cancer\nrisk how you feel even how you look the\nnext day and so cooking matters as well\nas the quality of what you throw on the\ngrill and the composition really matters\nand\nthe science though is that it's causing\nthis thing to happen there's uh nuclear\ndna mutations okay and the big one the\none that's funny because i wrote a whole\nbook my new york times bestseller\nsandwiched between homo deuce and\nsapiens that book\nis on mitochondria and that was the one\ni was missing so mitochondrial dna\nmutation the power plants in your cells\nthese things that sense the environment\naround you make energy make hormones\nchange how your your very how your brain\nthinks\nthese things mutate over time and\nafter i wrote superhuman a new study\ncame out that said oh when mitochondrial\nfunction declines that they are the\nthings that power the repair of your\nnuclear dna so you have cells that are\nthe building the building\nmap the road map that plans for all of\nthe hardware in your body that's your\nnuclear dna and then you have the power\nplants and the wiring for it all that's\nyour mitochondrial dna and these things\nneed to come together it turns out when\nyour mitochondrial dna gets mutated over\ntime it mutates easily it's no longer\nable to read and build cells properly\nbased on this blueprint and it's no\nlonger able to repair the blueprint so\nthis is a major cause of aging and the\nbook before superhuman\ncalled headstrong i wrote about how\n48\nof people under age 40 have early onset\nenergy decline this mitochondrial\ndecline quantifiably measured and\neveryone over age 40 doesn't make energy\nas well as a young person unless they\nhack it and so one of the big things\nthat you do in superhuman when you're\nfollowing the plan there\nis you say how do i make energy like a\nyoung person yes and when you do that\nyou get the response time in your brain\nof a young person and you get better\nskin and your cardiac function improves\nand you don't get alzheimer's disease\nand you don't get diabetes and you don't\nget cancer and all those risks are\nactually associated with mitochondria\nbut it's only one of the seven pillars\nso you could say i have the best\nmitochondrial function ever and my cells\nare in straight jackets and i have lots\nof senescent cells\nyou're still not going to like what\nhappens that's why you manage your risk\non all these\nand everything in this book all seven of\nthose things\nthere's here's what you do that's free\nhere's what you do that's\nthe supplement level thing that's what i\nlove here's what the crazy billionaires\nare doing and i went out of my way to do\nall the crazy stuff even if i didn't\nreally need it\nas much as i could so that i could write\nabout it and and talk to the experts\nwhile they were probably you know\ninjecting me with whatever and get the\nknowledge but also share the experience\nof it and what makes me really happy is\nright now people are fortunate enough to\ngo see dr harry and do the 120 000\nwhole body six-hand stem cell makeover\nhe's got one that doesn't do the brain\nstuff that's more affordable and you\nknow i can tell you if you wait five or\nten years i'm pretty sure that the costs\nare going to come down yeah but right\nnow for the cost to come down it takes\nthe very cutting-edge people and people\nget really pissed like this is just for\nold rich people look here's the deal\ncell phones\nwhen they first came out 30 years ago\nwhen you were two years old okay you\nprobably don't remember this because you\nwere two but you'd see the mercedes 300\nthe entire trunk was the cell phone\ntransmitter and it's got this big old\nbrick on his head he's driving down the\nfreeway in l.a talking on the phone and\nall the other people in cars who does\nthat think he is oh my god these\nstupid rich people on their cell phones\nokay these are the same people you know\nplaying tetris on their phone or\nwhatever but what happened is demand\ncomes first everything is stupidly\nexpensive because it's the cutting edge\nof innovation the fastest computers when\ni was eight years old i had a computer\nthat cost five thousand dollars it was a\nhand me down for my dad because he\nworked in the industry it was before\nwindows was invented before dos was\ninvented and no one had that when they\nwere eight but i just was like i didn't\neven know what i had this weird little\ngreen blinky thing yeah right but\nnow\nwe all have that and these anti-aging\ntechnologies over the course of the next\n10 years 20 years\nwill come down and cost dramatically\nbecause they're being funded by people\nwho are willing to basically spend\neverything they have to get another\ncouple years of quality life absolutely\nand all of us at a certain point in our\nlife no matter how much or how little we\nhave if you're facing death you can say\nyou know what i'm willing to make that\nbargain and\nwhat i want is i want for everyone\nlistening to the show to benefit from\nwhen a few wealthy people do that right\nnow and and it is good for the world\nit's good for everyone and the costs\nwill drop just like computer processors\ndrop yeah right well i am happy that and\ni appreciate the fact that you do go\ninto lifestyle changes here too it's\nreally like it's exactly that's what i\nmean and i think that's really really\nimportant yeah i i like both\nbecause i i think it is so important\nlike what you're saying it's when it's\nwisdom in science it's lifestyle and\nit's these stem cell changes right it's\nboth levels because it's all levels of\nchange because we're not changing our\nmindset we're not going to change our\nbehavior and if we're not changing our\nbiological behavior we can't change our\npsychological effects so\ni like to hope that someday we're going\nto have such good and affordable\ntechnology that all of us can you know i\nwent on the cheesecake diet for a year\nand you know i i went and i went on on a\nhuge series of inappropriate dates and i\npicked up all these weird diseases and\ni've got this huge tumor i'm just gonna\ngo into the doctrine for five bucks i'm\ngonna hit reset and i'm gonna come out\nas a 17 year old again okay maybe this\nwill happen i kind of don't think so\nyeah but i would like to think that our\ntechnologies are good enough that you\ncould be that stupid yeah i also think\nyou'll make this a bit too reckless\nthere is data that shows that we adjust\nour risk so when seat belts came out\npeople start driving faster yes exactly\nthat's what i mean but you know what\nit's okay that there's risk in life who\nwants to live in a risk-free world risk\nnot reckless yeah so what i think will\nhappen though is when you realize you\nknow what if i make a mistake like that\ni can recover from it i'm more likely to\ndo something but how good of a world is\nthat you mean i could possibly do\nsomething that's more fun more exciting\nmore risky or more more worthy\nright and if i come near dying i know\ni'm gonna be okay\nthat's profound versus right now i'm too\nafraid because i might die i want to\ncreate that world without fear yeah but\na world that still has risk yeah and i\nguess that's necessary yeah and i i vibe\nwith that the part where i always\nand and i guess this is always a small\npercentage of the percentage of people\nbut it's\nit's the part that it's like yeah how\nmuch can you risk without hurting anyone\nelse yeah i think that's what pain to me\nis interesting because it's like i'm i'm\nlike that i'm like yeah i want to you\nknow live to extremes and limits and\ntest the barriers but never at the cost\nof having other people and i wonder\nwhether you when you can reset\nthere's there's that risk of like oh\nwell they can reset too you know and we\nall know that people just as people age\ndifferently oh yeah they also age\nemotionally differently they also deal\nwith trauma differently they also deal\nwith tragedy differently so it's funny\npeople over 50 surprisingly uh show more\nhappiness and i've studied happiness and\ngiven big lectures on it and wrote about\nit in game changers\nthey actually show they've actually had\nenough time to deal with their yeah\nright and this is the horrible tragedy\nof of being human if you have\nchildren\nbefore you're 25 especially as a woman\nyour lifelong risk of every kind of\ncancer goes down your health will\nimprove your odds of living longer go up\nit's actually really good for you the\nproblem is that for 25 year olds to have\nkids you haven't had enough time to\nbuild up a financial base and you also\nhaven't had enough time to deal with\nyour emotional so now you're gonna\nhave kids and you probably won't be a\ngreat parent because you haven't had a\nchance to do your own work yeah right\nyou're still finishing separating from\nall the programming from your parents\nand all so you're saying all right i'm\ngoing to wait till i'm in my 30s and i\nhave a financial base but now having\nkids is harder on my body right it's\nharder on the family so it's like you're\ndamned if you do damned if you don't and\nit's one of the reasons that the birth\nrate is going down people are saying i'm\ngoing to choose just not to do it i'm\ngoing to choose to wait a long time\nand sometimes they wait too long\nbut part of it is what you just talked\nabout there\nabsolutely is there anything i haven't\nasked you today that you're like david\nyou're like jay i really want your\naudience to know this so i really wanted\nto talk about this whether it's\nyou know yeah it could be anything i\nmean there's so many other places we\ncould go with this but i just want to\ngive you the\nyou know one issue one of the things we\nhaven't talked about a lot is cognitive\nenhancement okay this is something i've\ndone for 20 plus years nootropics the\nreason modafinil is kind of cool you\nlook back 10 years i went on nightline\nit was the only guy who would do without\na bag on my head yeah i went to warden i\nwas on modafinil the whole time there's\nonly way i could even get my mba and\nstill work full-time and all that\nand it's one of many things like that i\njust want to say it is\nwell within our current technology to\nincrease your iq and increase your\nmental performance across all kinds of\nmeasures\nthere's natural plant-based compounds\nand animal-based compounds you can use\nthat will help you and i write about\nthis stuff on my blog daveasprey.com\nthere's pharmaceuticals that are proven\nto work and every month or so you'll see\nsome big articles saying experts say\nthese can't work like experts who didn't\nread the goddamn research because i put\nit in my book and there's five studies\nthat show that you can type 15 faster on\nthis stuff like if it doesn't work how\ncan this be possible right so we know\nthat these things work and i don't know\nwhat's motivating the people who will\nlook you in the face and lie to you and\nsay that they don't work because they do\nin some circumstances and they might\nwork for you but they might not and you\nowe it to yourself to find out if you\nwant to do that and then there's\ntechnologies\nbreathing and meditation being the two\ncheapest and most accessible and then\nthere's the neurofeedback stuff that i'm\ndoing at 40 years of zen and we're going\nto talk about my funky glasses yeah\ncompany's called trudark the company i\nfounded and i will tell you i have\ndoubled my deep sleep by using the\nglasses i made for sleep i couldn't buy\nthem\nyou have\nfive percent of the cells in your eyes\nreceive a light signal that you never\nsee it goes around your visual cortex\ninto the timing system in your brain\nand you can look at your body like a\ncomputer there's quadrillion little tiny\ncompute nodes they're called\nmitochondria and they need to work on\nthe same clock because if the ones in\nyour liver think it's daytime and the\nones in your brain think it's nighttime\nthey don't match up so\nthis light comes in and it tells your\nbrain what to do and it spreads the\nsignal throughout the body\nwell the glasses that i make for sleep\nwith true dark it's a patented set of\nfrequencies these are all of them it's\nnot just blue blocking that's not enough\nblue blocking is too much during the day\nand not enough at night these are the\nones that keep you awake so you wear\nthese glasses i can fly to new york i\ngot no jet lag at all it eliminated jet\nlag for my life and i get more sleep now\nin six hours more quality sleep than the\naverage 20 year old gets in eight hours\nof sleep and i publish the actual\nnumbers in here in superhuman how to do\nit so who would have thought the color\nof light is a variable that matters\nonly by measuring\nseeing what works and understanding the\nfundamental wiring of our body can you\ncreate something like that\nso for me i'm wearing these glasses now\nthese are called the true dark day\nwalkers and what these are doing is\nthey're blocking some blue light which\nmeans my brain works better all day\nbecause a lot of the interior lighting\nwe have today creates brain stress so by\nthe five o'clock you want sugar and\nyou're tired yeah i don't like that i\ndon't do that anymore so absolutely i'm\nwilling to walk around looking like a\nrock star\nand tell us what sugar does because oh\nman and you talk about fried and fried\nfood yeah sugar sugar's bad news you eat\nit and it creates something called\nadvanced glycation end products guess\nwhat clogs up those incinerators in the\ncells it's advanced glycation end\nproducts so you're basically browning\nthe tissues in your body you're\nincreasing your risk of almost every\ndisease especially cancer and especially\ncardiovascular and\nhalf of what's in sugar is fructose and\nhalf is another kind of sugar sucrose\nactually glucose obstacles glucose plus\nfructose but anyway fructose is what\ncauses non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\nso if we were to look at everyone's\nliver in the room right now there's a\npretty good chance that there's some\nfatty liver going on and if you're on an\nexclusively plant-based diet that\ndoesn't have any saturated fat for\nanimals your risk actually goes up a\nlittle bit but so you look at\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease it's\ncaused by sugar so if you don't eat\nsugar it doesn't work and what's\ninteresting you see this little uh\nlittle weird puck\n[Music]\ni have shaving\ncontinuous glucose monitor on right now\nokay if i sleep so much\nand we'll see if my shirt's loose enough\nyeah it is\nso now you're showing off your muscles\nyeah right yeah so this thing on its\nside oh it's got your face on it yeah i\ndid that it was a joke uh so it didn't\nhave to have my face on it but this this\ncomes on every 14 days i put on the\nother arm\nand you can wave your phone or a little\ndevice over it and it'll actually tell\nyou what your blood sugar is oh i love\nthat and you created this no no this is\njust type one day better oh it's just\nokay but no\ni want to know what sugar does to me so\ni have this little device and i can wave\nit over this and say it's at 5.2 that's\nuh canadian or european units so this is\nit's around 100. okay and it's middle of\nthe day and the line is perfectly flat\nso i can tell you i didn't eat something\nthat caused a blood sugar spike the odds\nare that if after your next meal if you\nhad one of these on we did you're going\nto see your blood sugar go up to 140\n150. if it's a typical\nvegan meal\nnow if you were to say i'm not a typical\nvegan i'm eating a plate of green\nvegetables and i'm not putting grains on\nit i'm not putting a lot of legumes\nmaybe a little bit and i'm putting a ton\nof olives and avocados and\nseeds and all that kind of how we yeah\ngood good deal if you're doing that my\nwife is the expert okay you'll see if it\nworks because if your blood sugar spikes\nbad news man it's not working so i've\nbeen able to tune what is fasting doing\nand all that that's so cool it's\ndatabased and now i know what does low\nblood sugar feel like i don't get it\nvery often but when i get it i know i\nknow why and i can also show you\nif you get crappy sleep\nyou will have no ability to control your\nblood sugar if you have emotional stress\nin your life\nyou eat the same food and your\nit's crazy yeah so that's the latest\nhack i'm working on absolutely and i\nlove what you just said there because we\nknow that when we're stressed\nwe turn to sugars we turn to carbs we\nturn to fats like that's what we do what\ndo you do when you're stressed when i'm\nstressed uh mostly i meditate on the\nblood of my enemies\nsorry\nwhat do you what do you actually do um\ni i'll usually it depends like the type\nof stress it's usually breathing or\nmeditation okay that's uh yeah there's\nno other there's some inner energetic\nstuff\nthat i've picked it up and all sorts of\ninteresting training in other countries\num there's usually some things i can do\nthere and if there's this amazing thing\nyou can do it's called call a friend if\nthat doesn't work call a therapist\nit's pretty remarkable because then you\ncan talk through someone who really\nunderstands the ideology of stress and\nyou can be that for your friends too\nit's just hard to see it i'm not gonna\nsee the big picture sometimes because\ni'm human\nunfortunately no kidding\nbut\nthe\nthe problem is\nis that if you don't have something like\nthat in your life or your friends are\nafraid to really tell you actually you\nreally are an half the time but\ni'm still friends with you it's really\nhard to have someone tell you that it is\nhigh so a therapist job is like actually\nyou need to own 100 you're blaming the\nother person you're just being a\nchildish little jerk and you need to\nlike put your pants on the right way\nthis morning and then you're gonna have\nto do the introspection so you gotta\nhave someone like that in your life and\nso if i'm feeling super stressed and i\ncan't figure out why\nthat really doesn't happen to me anymore\nyes but if i'm feeling super stressed\nand i think i know why and i can't\nfigure it out with friends i'll call a\ntherapist i'll call a psychologist and i\ndon't have necessarily regular sessions\nmaybe once a month and i'll just check\nin and then i'll say you know i'm having\nthis hard time with this thing and it's\nreally like it's causing stress which is\nvery unusual i don't experience normal\nstress like normal people because i\nhacked all my stress responses and then\nwe figure out all right it's usually and\nthis is a key thing it's a false belief\nso you are acting rationally and your\nfeelings make sense if what you believe\nto be true is true it's just bad\nassumptions and those false assumptions\nlead us to\nterrorism\ni used to think terrorists were crazy no\nif you believe what they believe their\nbehavior is rational\nthe beliefs are wrong and so if your\nbeliefs are wrong your emotions will be\nbroken and that's what a psychologist a\nreally good one or a therapist can help\nyou see is that you assume something\nwrong which is why you got in this in\nthis jam so let's change your\nassumptions and then you oh and then the\npain or the stress melts away because\nyou changed the world you live in\nabsolutely i feel like i've been talking\nto the real life iron man have you ever\nbeen told that don't tell anyone yeah\nhave you ever been done yeah people have\nsaid that i mean i've got my little yeah\nyeah yeah i'm wearing the aura\nyeah it's awesome i just i want to i\nwant to feel good all the time i know i\nlove yeah i was blessed with feeling\nlike i was old and literally i had the\ndiseases of aging before i was 30. high\nrisk of stroke and heart attack\npre-diabetes arthritis all that crap i\ndon't want to go back to that like i\nknow what it's like absolutely i'm not\ngoing to get old the way the way people\nexpect because it just sucks too much\nabsolutely so dave we end every\ninterview the final five which is a\nrapid fire question round one word or\none sentence answers max okay you ready\nyeah okay awesome so question number one\nwhat's a lesson you find hard to teach\nothers\nhow to stop being vegan\nit's not hard\nsorry i just had to say yeah\ntell tell us something that genuinely\nisn't\nwell maybe it's hard that actually is a\nreally hard lesson\num\na lesson that it's hard to teach others\nis that there are\nlayers of abilities and powers and\nenergies that they have that they've\nnever seen it's just hard to believe\nabsolutely okay second question what's\none thing you were once certain of that\nyou recently changed your mind on\ni was\nonce certain that the less you could\nsleep the better because sleep is such a\nbig waste of time oh yeah god i used to\nhave that one too\ni sleep my eight and a half hours a\nnight yeah sleep quality man i've become\na sleep advocate over the past few years\nas i looked at the data i still sleep as\nlittle as i can but my sleep is\nreally good yeah so that was a big\nchange that's a great point yeah okay\nquestion number three what's something\nabout you that most people don't know\nthat would surprise them\ni was was i was once bitten by a vampire\nbat\nin colorado\ndon't even live there but i woke up when\ni was a kid with a vampire about feeding\non my neck\nare you being serious i'm very oh you're\nbeing serious absolutely i didn't\nbelieve you yeah no it's a real species\nthey hypothesized they came in on\nbananas this was pre-internet but we\nactually caught the bat and took him to\nthe hospital oh wow that's just like\nthat big not very big okay but yeah it\nwas kind of scary woke up middle of the\nnight it was feeding and i didn't know\nwhat it was and oh my god and i i\ngrabbed it and i thought it was a mouse\nand it wasn't and like it bit me and i\nthrew it down it never hits the floor it\nwas really creepy but yeah that actually\nhappens yeah wow yeah i i mine i had a\nbat experience but it came in literally\nlike it was i was in india and putting\nit and it kept like landed on my face i\nwas nine years old and i literally just\npushed it off like it didn't bite me or\nanything but it literally flew and\nlanded on my face it was it was it's\ncreepy\nthey carry a lot of diseases too not\njust rabies interesting okay all right\nquestion number four what's something\nyou once valued that you no longer pay\nattention to\nwhen i was young\ni really valued actually two things um\none was being rich and i made six\nmillion dollars and i was 26\nand i lost when i was 28. and i could\ntell when i was 26 i said i'll be happy\nwhen i have 10 million dollars instead\nof 6 million which is a super dick thing\nto say\nso that that fascination with when i\nhave more money i'll be happy i i have\nlost that and you could say it's because\nyou have enough that's true you need\nabout 74 000 a year but i can say that\nthat obsession with it no\nabove a certain level it's just about\nwhat would you do with the money to make\nthe world a better place because you\ncan't spend it it'd be stupid\nso that's one\num the other one is\nit has to do with like wanting to be\nfamous and recognized\nwhen i was 23 i was in an in\nentrepreneur magazine\nbecause i sold the first thing that was\never sold over the internet and it was a\ncaffeine teacher said caffeine my drug\nof choice the first e-commerce before\nthe word e-commerce was out there no one\nknew what a big deal it was historically\nfor me it was just being scrappy and\ntrying to pay my college tuition but\num\ni was like look at me i'm in a magazine\nthere's a big picture of me and my\ndouble xl t-shirt and you know puffy red\nface\nand\ni just realized after 15 minutes of that\nit didn't do anything like like all of\nthe oh yeah i'm going to be recognized\nit it there's no value in that and and\nthat i'm going to be enormously wealthy\nthere's some value in that but not very\nmuch so for me it's like the the rich\nand famous thing\nit's about your mission and those things\nwhatever\nwell thank you for thinking it through i\nlove that answer okay sorry that\nit was a great answer i was happy you\nwent off on it this is the first time\nwe're ever asking this question as a\nfinal five so you get to answer this i\ni'm excited to ask you this question if\nyou could create any law for the world\nto follow what would it be\ni like be kind would be a really good\none but the really amazing law would be\nthe law that limited the number of words\nin the entire set of laws in the country\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love\nthese foods are designed to be addictive\nyou know there was an old their\nstatement that any white substance is\naddictive white flour is addictive white\nsugar is addictive"
