purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every one of\nyou that come back every week to listen\nlearn and grow now today's guest is\nsomeone that i've been really excited to\ntalk to for a long long time i feel like\ni'm finally connecting with a special\nsoul we have a couple of mutual friends\nthat have talked to me about her and\ni've been watching and admiring her\nincredible journey and her phenomenal\nwork i'm talking about the one and only\nmiranda kerr who's a well-known face in\nthe world of fashion she started a\nmodeling career in her early teens when\na friend entered her into a modeling\ncompetition which sparked significant\nmedia attention and she soon became the\nmost sought after new face in modeling\nin 2007 victoria's secret signed miranda\nas an angel making her the first and\nonly australian model ever to hold the\ncoveted title miranda continued to work\nclosely with fashion titans across the\nworld\nnow miranda is the founder and ceo of\nthe leading global certified organic\nskin care brand cora organics miranda\nwelcome to the podcast welcome to on\npurpose and thank you for being here\nthank you so much for having me that was\nquite an introduction well you've had\nquite a life so i think it's worth\ncelebrating and i think it's worth\nreminding people you seem like a very\nmodest and humble soul and so i think\nit's always wonderful to take a moment\nto celebrate these incredible\nachievements because\nyou know they they do matter in the\nsense of they matter because you've been\nrepresenting yourself representing a\ncommunity uh representing what you\nbelieve in through all your work so i i\nsaid it with energy because i i think\nit's phenomenal and congratulations on\nall of it oh thank you so much i really\nfeel like\nif you're going to do something you have\nto put your whole heart into it and so i\njust love that about you as well and um\nand that's the way i've lived my life\nand actually my mom taught me that as a\nyoung child\num and it's something that you know i do\nevery single day no matter if i'm\nchanging a diaper i'm like putting my\nwhole heart into making sure that diaper\nis perfectly clean and tidy and\nyou know\nfit the right way\nuh i'm a mother of three boys so that's\nsuch a good point though because i think\nsometimes we think we can put our all in\nto the big things but actually it starts\nwith putting your all into the small\nthings how did your mother teach you\nthat habit i think that's a brilliant\nmindset already to start off with how\ndid she train that in you and did she\ntrain did you have siblings and did she\nshare that with everyone yeah my mom is\nsuch a strong\nincredible woman and she really taught\nme\nfrom that young age if you're going to\ndo something put your whole heart into\nit or don't bother doing it and that was\nwith everything whether or not we were\ncleaning the car whether or not we were\ntidying our room whether or not we were\ndoing our homework\nwhether or not like i had just started a\njob\nshe's like just if you're gonna do it\njust put your all into it or don't do it\nat all and like i hear that in my head\nevery day if i feel like you know maybe\nlike\ncutting a corner a little bit like oh i\ndon't have time to\nproperly uh rinse the dishes before i\nput them in the dishwasher just simple\nlittle things like that\ni'm like oh that comes in my head or if\ni'm\nwhatever i'm doing with um\nwhen i'm you know creating a new product\nfor my skincare line coral organics or\nif i'm\nwriting an interview i mean you know\nlike writing a response to an interview\nwhatever i'm doing\ni really think about that and really put\nmy whole heart into it and\nthat's honestly why i believe my\nproducts are getting such incredible\nresults for people's skin because\ni really give it my all like my whole\nheart in like a whole 360 approach to\neverything that i'm doing i love that\nmindset and i think you know people know\nyou as the founder and you know ceo of\ncoral organics and the creator and your\nmodeling career but i think something\nthat a lot of people don't know is you\nactually studied nutrition and health\npsychology before you became a model and\ni wanted to understand a bit more about\nthat journey because to me that shows\nthat your journey with your business\ntoday it actually started a very long\ntime ago with this passion and this\ndesire to learn about\nnutrition and health psychology can you\ntalk about what you learned at that time\nwhich you think has been relevant to\ntoday i just personally feel like\nfor me i'm the type of person that wants\nto be learning until the day i die like\ni just feel like there is so much to\nlearn out there\nand i'm super passionate about health\nand wellness and psychology and how the\nmind body and spirit is all\ninterconnected\num so i studied in australia of course\nfire correspondence and then i studied\nanother course um\nat integrative nutrition\nand graduated in 2010\nand that course was based out of new\nyork and\num i recently just did another course\nthrough coursera that stanford was\noffering and i really enjoyed that as\nwell and i just\nlike i said it's something that i'm\npassionate about and\nit feeds my soul because i know\nlike i just get a lot um\nout of that information like whether it\nbe\nanything from like you know the nutrient\ncontent of something to\nthe way that you\nperceive something can then\nyou know shift your whole like you have\nthe choice to see something in a certain\nway\nor or you have it you know to see\nsomething in a positive light or a\nnegative light or in a neutral light and\nthat can affect your whole day\nand so these type of things like really\ninterest me and i just find just looking\nat things that way really appealing yeah\nabsolutely what would you say is the\nmost recent thing you've learned about\nthe mind body or spirit or something\nthat you've come across that you're just\nlike wow i didn't know this and i didn't\nrealize this or it's changed a habit in\nyou has there been something recently\nthat you've learned from a course or a\nbook or a podcast or anything else that\nstands out at all well\nsomething that i've learned because i\ngrew up in a little country town and\nand i've learned so many things\nobviously along the way and i've\nstarted with an interest and a passion\nin nutrition\nand i just thought and then i've done\nall of these courses and whatnot and i\nalways felt like i was you know just a\nvery healthy health conscious person but\ni\noften encourage that balance of like 80\n20 like 80 super healthy and conscious\nand 20 having a little bit\nmore flexibility in with yourself and\nand enjoying that moment if you want to\nyou know have a piece of cake with your\nfriend like just really enjoy that\nmoment and don't be sitting alone eating\na salad and being unhappy it's better to\nenjoy that moment with your friend and\nwhatnot but one thing that um\nrecently\ni've been learning more and more about\nand it sounds so simple but\nand it's something that you know\nfor so long i i didn't fully understand\nuntil recently it's just and that works\nfor me is just predominantly being more\nplant-based\num and trying to get a lot of my\nvitamins and minerals directly from the\nfood that i eat as opposed to relying as\nheavily on supplements\num\nand like everyone kind of knows that but\ni've learnt it even more um in these\nlast\ncouple of years um and\ni've noticed a big difference with my\nown digestion and whatnot from\nincorporating like\npredominantly plants it's not like vegan\nor vegetarian it's more like plant-based\nso\nlots of fresh vegetables and fruits\ni do my celery juice in the morning\nthat's been a game changer for me\ni don't know do you do the celery yeah\nwe're on the i mean everything you just\nsaid i'm so aligned with because\nuh my wife and i are plant-based and we\nwould define it the same way we we also\ntry and eat as few unprocessed and\nunpackaged goods so we try not to eat\nthings out of a box as much as we can or\nwe avoid having packaged goods in our\nhome\nand the medical medium was the person\nwho introduced me to celery juice when\nhe came on the podcast a few years back\nand so i started taking celery juice and\nthat has helped my gut more than\nanything in the world that i've tried\nand so i'm completely aligned with you\nand that's why we're gonna get along\neven better because uh everything you\njust said i'm like yes i i fully have\ndrank the kool-aid and believe in it too\nyeah i mean i thought i was super\nhealthy um\nand i i was super healthy you know but\nat the same time\ni took my head my health to the next\nlevel by incorporating more of a\nplant-based diet\nalthough i'm not like 100 there because\nmy husband is not plant-based like he\nreally enjoys\nto you know like he enjoys when i make\nhim this roast chicken that he really\nlikes which is like this turmeric\nchicken and so sometimes i'll take a\nbite of that some i have to check to\nmake sure it tastes perfect and so i'm\nnot like\nsuper super like strict but i do notice\na huge difference in my energy levels\nand focus when i'm predominantly eating\nthat way and there are a lot of studies\nto back that up in science and even the\ncourse that i was doing through stanford\nwas saying that like predominantly we\nshould be eating\nmore plant-based less processed\nless red meat because\ni mean any meat really in in general um\nand it's also obviously better for the\nenvironment as well um\nand i've just noticed the personal like\nhealth benefits um from doing so and\nanthony\ngot me on to doing the celery juice\nwhich i have like 32 ounces every\nmorning celery juice well i have water\nwith one lemon to start off with and\nthen i do the celery juice and then i do\nthe heavy metal um\ndetox smoothie\nwhich is great because you have in there\nbarley grass spirulina\nin the powder form you have the\nblueberries banana\nfresh orange juice\num\nand the seaweed the dolls\nso you're getting like so many vitamins\nand minerals that way\nthat's incredible can you tell me about\nthe last one and tell me about what what\nthat's specifically doing for those that\ndon't know i think people have heard us\nspeak about celery juice before they've\nheard us speak about uh some plant-based\ndiets but especially that last one when\nyou talk about the metal\nthe detox\nyeah could you speak a bit about that so\nthat anthony has put together like this\nspecific\nshake smoothie which is kind of easy to\nmake and actually i make it for the\nwhole family the kids love it\nit has those ingredients which i\nmentioned\nand those ingredients help to pull out\noh and it has cilantro in there too to\nhelp draw out any heavy metals\nthat might be in our bodies and it kind\nof in a natural way\nbecause the cilantro helps draw out that\num\nand then you're getting so many minerals\nfrom the dolls and\nyou're getting the protein from\nthe\nspirulina and the barley grass powder\nand then you've got all the antioxidants\num from the blueberries and then\nthe wild blueberries and then um\nthe vitamin c\nwith the orange juice and the potassium\nwith the um with the banana i mean i i\nreally just i love it yeah i can't wait\nto try that one that's one i haven't\ntried yet so i i was asking for myself\ntoo uh i'm definitely gonna try that one\nout so i love i love that tip because\nit's amazing isn't it that all these\nnatural accessible\nitems of food can be so powerful for our\nmind and body and even shift our energy\ni found when i made these shifts in\ninstead of reaching for a sugary soda\ndrink\nto reaching for a celery juice so when i\nmade the shift of switching to a natural\nprotein drink which is what i have every\nday a natural protein shake as opposed\nto even a a powdered one like so many\ngreat benefits are there i wonder you\nsaid that your mother obviously taught\nyou all these mindsets what are some of\nthe mindsets lessons\nor health and wellness tips you're\nsharing with your kids to try and help\nthem could you walk us through that\nprocess of how you're passing that on\nlike your mother taught you so many\nbeautiful insights yeah one other thing\nthat my mother taught me as well as a\nyoung child was let your little light\nshine\nand\nthere's that um speech that marianne\nwilliamson wrote\nabout\nshining your light and when you shine\nyour light you then give\npermission for\nothers to let their light shine and if\nwe could all\nshine our light i mean in when i say\nshine the light it's more like\nbe who you are be the best version of\nwho you are and come from that heart\nspace\nand that essence of the beauty of you as\nthe individual that you are and so i try\nto encourage that within my children i\ntry to cultivate their own individuality\num\nand the three i have three boys and\nthey're all so different and\nthat's what makes the world so magic\nlike\nthe individual personalities and what\neveryone can bring to the table it's so\ninteresting\num my 11 year old\nis a true artist and he's very sensitive\nand empathetic and\nhe also is a peacemaker the amount of\ntimes that\ni've\nhad feedback from other parents that my\nson has been the one to help\nyou know make peace between two people\nthat were having challenges at school or\nif someone was getting bullied he'd be\nthe one to stand in and say listen\nthat's not okay so he has that quality\nof like being that little peacemaker\nhelping to create that harmony within\nhis space\nand then what really makes him shine and\nthrives when he can sit down\nand express himself through art you know\nand then my little three-year-old he\njust loves anything with engines like\ncars and he's like a real boy boy and he\njust he just loves and is so fascinated\nwith engines whether it be\na car or a\nairplane or a boat or\nyou know anything like that and he's\nvery focused on what he wants to do and\nand where he wants to go whereas my\nfirst child is a little more flexible\nand just harmonious and and it's just\nand it's\nincredible for me as a parent\nto help cultivate these\nindividual like\npassions you know and then with my 11\nyear old he really loves soccer so i'm\nlike i encourage him to do that what he\nreally loves and\nand uh my three-year-old he really loves\nswimming and then the baby the\ntwo-year-old he's very much into balls\nanything that's like a ball\nuh so we cultivate that and these are\njust little examples of just how to\ncultivate that passion that's naturally\nwithin them from a young age\nand not project what you want them to be\nonto them\nand\nwork with them so they can be the best\nversions of themselves\nand uh it's really fun being a parent\nand having the opportunity to\nhelp cultivate that and in a loving way\nand in a way of\nlike because they are three boys they\ncan sometimes you know especially the\ntwo and three year old they're 16 months\napart so\nthey can sometimes just like\nhave this little rough and tumble moment\nand i'm like boys\nlet's take a breath\nlet's make peace because i really want\nto cultivate that peacemaking i forgive\nyou please forgive me let's forgive each\nother\nlet's make peace and let's be grateful\nfor each other let's be grateful that we\nhave each other\nthat you have a brother\nand you know that you have two brothers\nand that we're\nall here together and we have our health\nand like let's\nget on with the rest of the day and like\nthey're like okay\nand it's like i forgive you and then i\nmake the other one say please forgive me\nand let's make peace yeah and i do the\nsame with my 11 year old so little\nthings like that i also we do um\nyoga together i've done like mommy and\nme yoga with each of them\nand there's also this other program\ncalled cosmic yoga that i put on for the\nlittle ones\num just to kind of help them\nget into that moment i put on a little\nmeditation and calming music at night\nand we say our prayers before bed and\njust having that i try to cultivate that\nattitude of gratitude with my children\nbecause\nthat to me is something that's really\nimportant like life is a precious gift\nand\nwe should be\nreally grateful for every breath and\nevery moment that we have together\nand i really\nreally um want to instill that within my\nwithin our children because\nif you don't have that gratitude and\nstart from that place of gratitude then\nit just feels to me like\nyou're not coming from that loving space\nand it you know it's the most important\nthing is to have that loving foundation\nyeah absolutely that sounds so wonderful\nand beautiful by the way that's so\ninspiring and\nwhat i love about what you shared is\nthat it sounds like you've created lots\nof\nexperiences with your children where\nyou're all learning together and you're\ngrowing together and it's not just i'm\nspending time with them\nbecause i think we often feel like it's\njust about time and quality time but it\nactually seems like you've built rituals\nand practices and and meditations and\nprayers and experiences together\nwhich allows you to form such a deeper\nbond with them i wonder miranda you know\ni'm asking this because i know so many\nof our community and our audience\nare\nmothers they're wives they're fathers\nthey're husbands they're partners they\nare ceos they're founders of companies\nhow do you\nwear all of those hats\nbut still give yourself\nthe time and permission to take care of\nyourself because obviously you're\nsomeone who's very mindful you take care\nof your physical and mental health\nhow do you give yourself permission in\nall of that how have you found to make\nspace for your own health and wellness\nwhile you're building a company and\nbeing a mother and of course being a\nwife and provider and\nand family person too\nyeah it's actually um something that i\nwas very conscious of because my mother\nshe\nactually was quite a workaholic as when\ni was a child so my grandmother i spent\na lot of time with my grandmother who\nyou know was a grandmother at home and\nso she was very nurturing so my my mom\ntaught me the importance of hard work\nand having a really like great work\nethic and just like let's get in and do\nthis and do it with our whole heart\nand my grandmother taught me\nthe loving nurturing\nside of things so for me\ni really wanted to infuse the two\nfrom my children so that they understood\nthat work is a part of life but at the\nsame time\num\ni'm there for them and meeting their\nneeds and i am taking time to be with\nthem and they feel like they're they and\nthey know that they're my priority\nalways like they come first no matter\nwhat\num and so it is a balance and so what\ni've had to do and i know you practice\nthis as well\nis i have everything on my calendar and\ni map everything out from minute to\nminute like literally\nso my husband wakes up at 5 30 every\nmorning so i know that i have from 5 30\ntill 6 30 because my children generally\nwake up between 6 30 and 7. depends on\nhow the night's gone so i know that i\nhave that time\nto do what fills my cup at the very\nminimum right because we all know that\nwe need to fill our own cup in order to\nbe able to give\nabundantly to everyone around them and i\nreally want to be the best mother i can\nbe i want to be the best partner i can\nbe to my husband i want to be the rest\nfor my best for my team\nand i really believe in being uh present\nand engaged and wherever i am like in\nthat moment so in order for me to be\nable to do that\nhaving that calendar mapped out and then\nhaving flexibility within that\nis a way that\nhelps me\nstick mostly to the plan and even things\nin there like you know i used to have in\nthere like called my grandma because and\nshe just passed a year ago but\ni would have that in there because that\nway time wouldn't just slip through my\nfingers you know and i would make sure\nthat i had that time in there because\nlife is very busy for each and every one\nof us and\nespecially being a working mom and um\nyou know my company's now global we're\nin 30 different countries i built this\ncompany from the ground up and\nand uh it's been incredible to\nwatch the company grow and\nyou know\nsee the results that my skincare is\ngetting from people's skin all over the\nworld and it's super rewarding but it\nneeds my time and guidance\nand\nthere is so much that i want to do in my\nlife and\nand uh\nat the same time so i write down those\nlists like you do\nand time things out so that then i'm as\norganized as i can be\nand then if things\ndon't go to plan then you just are like\na willow tree and i and i say to my team\nlet's be like a willow tree and go with\nthe flow because in a storm the willow\ntree\ndoesn't break it's the rigid oak that\neveryone assumes the oak tree is so\nstrong\nthat's the tree that will break because\nit's too rigid so it's important to have\nflexibility so we make plans and then we\nhave to\nadjust and adapt accordingly when things\nchange i've loved that analogy for so\nlong and you just shared that so\nbeautifully i think it's\nsuch a great lesson for all of us\nbecause like you said we hang on to that\ncertainty and that surety and that\nstability and we're trying to make sure\nthat it doesn't change but you're so\nright that flexibility and adaptability\nis what allows you to continue to flow\nand grow during tough times and you\nmentioned that you know you've built\nthis business from the ground up\nuh you started it but what i'm really\ninterested miranda is going a couple of\nstep back and talking about the pivot\nyou know you're a really successful\nmodel you're at the top of your career\nyou're on the front cover of every\nmagazine and then you decide to make\nthis shift can you talk to us about\nhow challenging or interesting that\npivot was\nbecause i think so many people today\nare trying to make purposeful pivots in\ntheir life and i think everyone today is\nrecognizing that they're more than their\ntitle they're more than their job\nthey're more than the career that\nthey've built they can be so many other\nthings can you talk to us a bit about\nhow you thought about that pivot when\nyou first began when the business wasn't\nas successful as it is today\nas i said i grew up in this little\ncountry town in australia\nand i had that\ni had like i mean there was so much love\nwe didn't have much like money but we\nhad a lot of love and a lot of um\nsupport from our whole family because\nyou know my aunts and uncles and cousins\nand everyone and we're all very much\ninto health and wellness and have been\nand\nit's interesting because that really\nshaped\nwho i am today growing up like that and\nmy grandmother taught me about noni\njuice when i was 13 which is the key\ningredient across my whole range\nand then my mum got sick she had cancer\nin her spleen i think i was maybe 16 at\nthe time\nand\nwe then had to look through everything\nthat we were doing as a family and there\nwas this little book that a friend of my\nmoms gave to her it was called the\nchemical maze and in this book it\nexplained everything from like household\nproducts cleaning products\num products that you might have in the\npantry\num\nshampoo\nskin care makeup and it explains like\nall the little numbers that you see on\nthe back of packaged goods whether that\nbe personal\nproducts or whether that be\ningestibles whatever it is\nwe assumed that we were living a healthy\nlife right because my grandparents had\nan organic vegetable patch and we ate\nlots of vegetables from the vegetable\ngarden and\nwe were very much aware of health and\nwellness and my grandma you know\nintroduced me to aloe vera as i said she\nintroduced me to noni\num she's very much into all of these\nnatural therapies and so we were very\nsurprised to see when we took a closer\nlook at the fine print on the back of\nthese packaged goods\nthat\nthere were so many potentially harmful\nand\ncarcinogenic\nproducts that we were exposing ourselves\nto unknowingly\nevery single day\nand\nwe were horrified and like wow horrified\nbut also like\nexcited about the opportunity\nto learn more and find something that\nwas truly able to serve the purpose\nwhether that be you know a cleaning\nproduct at home or a personal skin care\nproduct or hair care that was healthier\nto what we\nhad been using and we just assumed that\nthings were healthy not like we just\nassumed that things were safe because\nthey were sold on the shelf in the\nsupermarket\nand so it was kind of um\nat that stage\nwhen i was like 16\nand as a family going through that\nexperience with my mum and and\nreally looking closely at all the\ningredients\nit really sparked a desire and a passion\nand an interest in me um and then i was\ntalking to a friend of mine in 2006 in\naustralia and i was like\ni haven't been able to find a truly\ncertified organic skin care brand and\nyour skin is the largest organ what you\nput on your skin soaks in and i was like\ndo you know\nof anything and she's like no but let me\nspeak to my friend who makes certified\norganic essential oils because maybe she\nknows\ni speak to her and then she's like well\nwhy don't you just create your own and i\nwas like uh\nokay she's like why don't you just speak\nto the lab speak to the chemist and like\nyou know even if you just make it for\nyourself so we started back and forth\nand then originally i was just making it\nfor myself\nand creating these products and then\num i had to send a product to my mom\nwhich is the noni glow face oil\nand she had\nat the time she had like a psoriasis\nissue on her skin and the doctor had put\nher on a steroid cream and it was really\nuncomfortable for my mum because she has\nnaturally\ngreat skin and she never really was one\nto even wear makeup so\nit really like\nhurt her confidence having this issue on\nher skin and having to put the steroid\ncream on which she knew wasn't healthy\nfor her but she didn't have really\nanother alternative so i said here try\nthis i'm testing this new product so she\ntried it and within a week her skin had\ncleared up and she's like miranda this\nis amazing and i was like wow we got\nresults first hand here guys let's keep\ngoing\nand that's how it kind of all started\nand it was just starting from like a\npassion that i had at the time when i\nlaunched in australia\nin um\nwe ended up launched launching at the\nend of 2009\nand i launched with a major department\nstore there and\nthen we went into little pharmacies and\nwhatnot and and it was for me it was a\npassion project about really getting\nthese products out that from day one was\ncertified organic they were filtered\nthrough rose quartz crystals in the\nmanufacturing process because i\npersonally wanted that mind body skin\nconnection\nand\nthey don't use any artificial fragrance\nit's only essential oils and therapeutic\ngrade essential oils and each\nproduct has its own blend of those\nessential oils so you're getting an\nbenefit from that whether that be\nuplifting like without tumeric mask\nor whether that be soothing with our\nmilky mushroom cleanser and calming and\nand also on the back of every one of\nchorus products is a positive word to\nencourage\nthat\nshift in your mindset like i was talking\nabout before that we have a choice so we\ncan have look outside and go oh i can't\nbelieve it's raining or we can look\noutside and we can go wow it's so lovely\nwhen it rains it's so cozy or we really\nneeded that rain like we can the way\nthat we see the world can really\ntransform our reality so when i created\ncora first and foremost i wanted\nclinically active\nhealthy certified organic skin care like\nresults driven like number one\nsecond of all i wanted to\nreally create something that was more\nthan skin care that really would just\nuplift you when you're using it and you\ncould feel the energy from the crystals\nbecause\nthat they're energetic\nyou know tools that have been used for\nmany years and something i've\nlearned on in my life you feel the\nenergy and the uplifting element from\nthe\naromatherapy and you also um feel the\nenergy from the intention behind it\nthat like every product has like for the\nface oil has like bliss on the back of\nthe product the new moisturizer that\nwe're about to launch has like peace so\nyou feel that\nintention behind it so everything's\nreally intentional and hopefully creates\nlittle rituals in your life\num as opposed to just a monotonous skin\ncare routine that is\namazing congratulations i love hearing\nabout\nthe journey and the story and the steps\nand the intensity of the research and\nfinding all these old\namazing gems of\nhealing\nsubstances and technologies that are\nbeing used now and i actually saw this\narticle from e news saying why women\neverywhere trust mirandika's quora\norganics and\ni i think that that word is so important\ntrust like\ni think there are things in the world\nthat sell there are things in the world\nthat are very popular\nbut then trust is deeper than all of\nthose things i mean miranda how does\nthat feel\nwhen you think wow like\npeople trust the work that we're doing\nlike that that must feel amazing like\nwhat does that feel like that feels so\nrewarding to me because i have started\nthis company from day one\ntrying to create these transformational\nproducts that are healthy for you that\nare\nyou know clinically active going to\nuplift you as well at the same time\nand\nmy intention has always been to\nput these products out there i s and and\nand create these products to really\nhelp people i've never taken a scent\nfrom the company because it's my baby\nyou just put everything into it\nand um\ni do it because of my love and my\npassion\nfor health and wellness and for helping\npeople\ni don't actually\nneed to work like i could sammy retire\num\nand i often will say to myself hmm what\nam i doing this for again but i realized\nthat i have something really special\nhere i'm not creating this product line\nto um\nmake it really huge and then sell it for\nall this money what i'm doing is i'm\ntrying to create something\nspecial that can really make a\ndifference to people's skin and my hope\nis that i can\nhand down this company to my three boys\njust like estee lauder was handed down\nthrough their family and they can\ncontinue my legacy and that these\nproducts will continue to help\npeople's skin and spirit long after i'm\ngone\nso it it feels like a big blessing to me\nto be able to create products\nthat\ngive people the results that they need\nin a really\nhealthy way that's good for them it's\ngood for the environment\nand it hopefully adds that\nuplifting element to their life as well\nso they feel\nlike\nmore connected to themselves through the\nexperience of these little rituals\num that i've created like for example\nlike i know this might be too much for\nsome people but i like this example\nmyself and i do as you hear like\npractices with my children the\nforgiveness part right because we're all\nhuman beings\nso with the milky mushroom cleanser\ni created this cleanser so you shake it\nto activate it it has the silvery\nmushroom in there it comes out like this\nmilky oil-based cleanser\non the back of the packaging is\nforgiveness so you while you're\ncleansing your skin you're also\ncleansing your spirit so you take that\nopportunity because we cleanse our skin\ngenerally morning and night we have that\nas a little ritual that we're cleansing\nour skin we're also peacemaking for\ngiving ourselves some forgiving anyone\nthat may have intentionally or\nunintentionally hurt ourselves and at\nthe same time another crystal is infused\ninto that which is a clear quartz which\nis also about bringing clarity so you've\ngot the rose quartz for the love and the\nnurturing and the clear quartz for\nbringing clarity and so to me that just\nfeels like such a lovely ritual and then\nit has essential oils of rose geranium\nand basil which are all anti-anxiety\nessential oils that really calm the\nspirit and like\nthe in so i just to me i don't know\nmaybe i'm crazy but that type of\nexperience like really\nempowers me because\ni don't have much time in my life and so\nto have that experience whilst i'm doing\na monotonous thing like cleansing my\nface gives back to me and i want to\nshare that with other people yes yes i i\nlove that i don't think it makes you\nsound crazy i mean everything's very\nthoughtful it's intentional it's mindful\nit is mind body spirit in the sense that\nyou're doing something like you said\nmonotonous for your face\nbut actually it's impacting your spirit\nand it's impacting your mind and it's\nimpacting your senses i mean that's\nthat's absolutely phenomenal i wonder\ndid you miranda come across any hurdles\nor failures or setbacks in the beginning\nthat you think entrepreneurs and\nfounders can be mindful of because when\nyou're trying to create something so\npurpose-based and when you're trying to\ncreate something like you have that is\nso much about\ncreating a product that actually helps\npeople\ncan you walk me through maybe some of\nthe challenges that you had as well\nbecause i think sometimes people have a\nromantic view that oh if i'm passionate\nand i love something then things just\nwork out and we know that's not true\neven if you have good intentions because\nso can you walk us through that because\nyou obviously seem like such a\nwell-intentioned human being but i want\npeople to also realize that there's been\na lot of hard work and focus and\nfiguring things out as well yeah i mean\nthere is so much hard work and focus and\ncommitment\nand unwavering commitment\num because\neven from day one i was told that no no\npeople don't want they don't care if\nit's an organic product like\nno one cares about that and i was like\nbut i do i really care about that\ni want a certified organic product i\ndon't just want an organic product or a\nnatural product or a clean product it\nneeds to be certified organic and the\nreason for me that it needs to be\ncertified organic is because of all of\nmy research from when my mum got sick\nwhat we realized is that and what is now\nscientifically proven is that there are\nup to 60 more antioxidants in an organic\ningredient\nso therefore you're going to get\na better result for your skin from using\ncertified organic products you get\nhigher antioxidant content\nand so i don't want to put something on\nmy skin just because it's healthy for me\ni want it to be results driven and so\nnot only do you\nnot have the pesticide sprayed on the\norganic crops\nyou\ndon't have the added um unnecessary\nthings added to it that might be\ndetrimental to your health in addition\nto that\nyeah but you also have like 60 more\nantioxidants so to me it was like such a\nno-brainer but everyone was like no one\ncares if it's organic why don't you just\ncall your brand cora and then you're\ngoing to be able to have more\nflexibility why do you need to be\norganic and i was like\nbecause it's organic it's like that's\nthe whole reason i eat organic and it\nneeds to be certified and being\ncertified organic is a really really big\nlong\nlike\nprocess\nand so we're certified by the world\ncertification body eco cert cosmos and\nthere is so many details and audits that\nwe have to with like go through that our\num\nall of our chemists have to go through\nthe manufacturers have to go through\nit's that's why people don't necessarily\ndo it because it's a lot of time it's a\nlot of effort it's a lot of money\nbut that way people really know it you\ndon't have to take my word for it i have\nan outside body looking in like like big\nbrother on everything that i'm doing\nand and every word that i write on the\npackaging because i write all the pop\ncopy because it comes from my heart and\nthat all has to be approved by eco\ncosmos\nand it tells you very explicitly like\nyou know 98 comes from organic farming\nyou know two percent from natural and\nit's very clear\nyou know and it's and that is the way it\nshould be\nit should be clear and it should be in\nand there is so much noise out there in\nthe world\nthat i wanted it to be like that and a\nlot of people in the beginning poo-pooed\nme on that and i was actually\nthe leader in the clean beauty category\nand still to this day we're still the\nonly certified organic brand that\nsephora carries\nlike the whole brand\nand and\nand people are still saying to me like\nwell why don't you just call it cora\nthen you'll have more flexibility you\ncan use more chemicals i was like no\nthat takes away the the principle and\nthat's the whole thing and the whole\nreason why\ni this company is 95 mine and i invested\nyou know all of my money that i worked\nreally hard in\nlike with my career\num because that's a whole nother story\nbut that was like a six day a week um\ntwo different countries a week job and\nit actually gave me a lot of experience\nto know what works underneath makeup to\nknow what makes your skin\nfrom a texture point of view and then i\nwanted to create the certified organic\nversion of that um\nso that it was you know such a\nhealthy experience for people\nnot just looked good underneath makeup\nbut it was so and it still is so fun for\nme to work with our chemists who i\nbelieve are just like the best in the\nworld\nand\ni work back and forth with them on like\nthis is what i'm thinking and feeling\nand this is a cool ingredient what do\nyou think about this and we go back and\nforth and and really push the boundaries\nand then we do all the studies to back\nit up and we do before and after photos\nof people's skin to really show the\ntransformation and it's just it's like\nmagic that happens before your eyes and\nthen you get all the heartwarming\ntestimonials and you're like okay i am\ndoing it right even though people have\nsaid\nwhat are you doing like this is crazy no\none cares about organics and even still\nto this day\ni have people\nsay to me\nyou know it people only care about clean\nthey don't care about organic people\ndon't understand what you're talking\nabout when you say organic and i'm like\nit doesn't matter this is something that\nwhen they do understand and if they did\nresearch\nthen they would never want to use\nanything else they would always want to\nlook for certified organic products so\nit's all about education and i'm trying\nto\nmy best\neducate people so at least they can make\na conscious choice\nbecause\nthat's the most important thing you\ndon't have to use my products like\nbecause i'm saying so it's a choice that\nyou\nmake because you're educated and you\nknow what the difference is yeah\nabsolutely i mean your\npassion and energy for what you're doing\nis absolutely infectious i'm i'm just\nlistening to you\nand i'm watching it i'm thinking wow\nlike the\nthe amount of research that's been done\nthe amount of breaking down every part\nof it that exists in this journey i mean\nit's it i'm really blown away honestly\ni'm not just saying that i speak to so\nmany founders and we speak to so many\nceos and we speak about so many\ncompanies but\ni can just tell how much this product is\nyour heart\nand that's so beautiful and and i heard\nthat you actually have another exciting\nproduct coming out on the 21st of april\ni believe yes just after my birthday\nyeah could you tell us a bit about that\nyeah so\nthe newest moisturizer\nthis is our active algae lightweight\nmoisturizer and as you can see\nthis is symbolic of an aquamarine\ncrystal\nand\nit is filtered through and touches upon\nrose quartz and aquamarine crystals\nand it is a beautiful\nas i said lightweight uh gel moisturizer\nthat has a refillable jar\nso you buy the glass jar once\nand then the refill pods thereafter\nand so what i\nlove about this is it's a hydrating\ncreamy gel i actually have one open over\nhere so i can show you\nmy little workspace here\nand\nit's kind of very lightweight and bouncy\nit's for people that are looking for a\nlightweight hydration because we have\nour turmeric moisturizer and the\nturmeric moisturizer is more of like\na rich\na very rich creamy\nturmeric moisturizer people are obsessed\nand this is more of the lightweight\nversion but both of them have incredible\nresults and the ingredients in this new\nlightweight moisturizer are\nreally just super powerful they have\ngreen\nalgae\nand it's sustainably farmed in the us\nthe green algae that we source for this\nand it has the bioactive lipids in there\nand essential fatty acids to help fight\nagainst aging it helps improve dullness\neven skin tone your skin is brighter and\nfirmer and we've got all the photos to\nprove that on different skin types and\nskin tones\nit also has green tea in here which we\nuse a lot of green tea in a lot of coral\norganics products\nand it's very soothing and purifying it\ncalms redness and inflammation\nit also has alpine rose\nthat we source from um the swiss alps\nand that's super powered with\nantioxidants uh helps protect your skin\nand then we have the swiss glacier water\nis another key ingredient\nthat we actually encapsulated into\nliposomes in here so there's tiny little\nliposomes in here that have the swiss\nglacier water on there so that when you\napply it they burst onto your skin and\nyou it maintains the freshness and so\nit's very soothing and cooling and it\ngives you that long-lasting hydration\nwithout any um\nyou know tackiness so it's like really\ngreat as a base for makeup\nas i said it's got all your essential\nfatty acids in there it helps minimize\nthe appearance of fine lines and\nwrinkles it helps minimize pores\nand\nit just gives you that\nlong lasting hydration i i call this the\ngreen juice superfood for your skin\nbecause it literally is like a green\njuice superfood for your skin\num\nand\nas i said we can\nthe results are incredible like\npeople the before and after results are\njust mind-blowing people are just loving\nit and that's what\nmakes my heart seem to make products\nthat are healthy for people and super\nresults driven that's what i'm all about\nyeah miranda i think you've given us so\nmuch to\nconsider and i'm sure if there's any\nentrepreneurs listening or any people\nwho are pivoting into that space\ni feel like you're\nyou would have given everyone a lot of\nconfidence and reassurance that\nknowing that you're creating something\nthat's going to get people results\nthat's going to make a change that is\nthe authentic and the\nintegrity-based version of what you want\nto create\nhas a space in the world and i think\nthat's what i'm really taking away is\nthat as a founder and as an entrepreneur\nall i'm hearing from you is authenticity\nintegrity integrity building something\nthat you really believe in and you know\nis going to help people and i love those\nmessages coming out you've been so uh\nkind and generous with your time\nwe we end every episode of on purpose\nwith what i call the final five these uh\nfinal five questions have to be answered\nin one word to one sentence maximum\nuh and and there are a short fast five\nthat help us remember some of these\namazing pieces of wisdom so miranda kerr\nare you ready for your final five i'm\nready as i'll ever be\namazing so the first question is what is\nthe best advice you've ever received\ni think it's probably from my mom it's\nlike if you're going to do something do\nit with your whole heart\nyeah i love that i think that's a\nbeautiful piece of advice uh what is the\nworst advice you've ever received or\nheard\nto go against your intuition if you\nreally feel\ndeeply about something and you know in\nyour heart like don't fight against that\nthat's the worst advice like don't just\nthink because it's ticking boxes in your\nhead that you should go for it when the\nalarm bells are ringing inside of you i\nlove that i've done that so many times\nand i've always regretted it when i have\nif i've ever gone against that you it\nnever feels good so fully agree with you\nokay question number three\nuh what is something that you used to\nvalue but you don't value as much\nanymore\nwell\ni used to\ni don't know if value\ni used to appreciate like\nthe whole like\nglamour and um fun of different events\nbut now i much prefer to stay home and\nbe with my family\nlike i really do it doesn't matter what\nevent it is or if the queen's gonna be\nthere god bless her soul like\nwhat means the most to me is just\nspending quality time with my family\ni love that\nuh question number four what's the first\nthing you do in the morning and the last\nthing you do at night\nkiss my husband\nboth\n[Laughter]\nlove that that's awesome what a great\nanswer and\nfifth question and final question if you\ncould create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nor one habit that they had to do every\nday what would it be\nhave an attitude of gratitude\nbeautiful if we could all be grateful\nfor everything that we have\nthe simple things like a roof over our\nheads\nlike the fact that we can see the fact\nthat we can talk\nthe fact that\nwe're alive the fact that we're\nbreathing if we can be grateful for\nthose simple things\nthe world\nwould be a better place because we'd all\nbe more content within ourselves and\nwhen you're content within yourself and\nyou're grateful for everything\nthen that attracts more of that into\nyour life that's such a
