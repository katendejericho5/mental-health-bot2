    "transcript": "your world view is that people are going\nto abandon you in their relationships\nand so you either go into those\nrelationships being very needy and\nafraid or you go into those\nrelationships being very jealous why is\nit so important to make this switch\nfrom us thinking what is wrong with you\nto what happened to you\nwell let me answer that because i first\nuh\ncame across this question of what's\nhappened what what what what what\nhappened to you when i was doing an\ninterview with dr bruce berry a couple\nof years ago for 60 minutes story i was\ndoing now i've known uh dr perry for\nover 30 years i first started\ninterviewing him in the early 90s late\n80s early 90s on the oprah show when we\nwere talking about\nuh raising children and how important it\nis those first zero to six years so i've\nbeen hearing about\nwhat it means to\nnurture and support the brain early on\nit wasn't until that conversation a\ncouple of years ago i don't know\nwhether i think it's because of where i\nwas in my life at the time\num\ni opened a school in south africa i've\nhad these wonderful brilliant girls who\ncome from traumatic backgrounds grow up\nand have\nreally serious mental health issues\nand i was trying to at the time figure\nout what are we doing wrong at our\nschool something's really wrong here and\nin that interview with dr perry he said\nyou know\nmost people ask the question when kids\nare not behaving the way you want them\nto behave or what's wrong with them we\nreally should be asking about what's\nhappened to you and something went\nin my brain it was like a major moment\nlike i got it in a way that i hadn't\nreceived it before and i realized that\nit's not just for children that you ask\nthat question but it's really everybody\nand that moment bruce as i've said to\nyou many times dr perry\nchanged the way i saw\nmy relationships how i saw my own life\nhow i interacted with people and even in\npolitics where it was so crazy in the\npast four years and everybody's always\ntalking about what's wrong what's wrong\nwhat's wrong i would always say i wonder\nwhat happened to that person i wonder\nwhat happened to them younger that\ncaused them to be this way so all of the\nlabels that you just gave jay\nthere there's a world of labels there is\nyou know overachiever there's you know\nobsessive compulsive\nmoms soccer moms there is the desire to\nyou know please people all the time\nthere's a multiple multiple multiple\nmultiple labels\nthat\nrefer back to what happened to us and so\ni will just say this one of the things\nthat bruce says in the book\neach of us comes into the world with our\nown world view\nand that world view\nis actually shaped from the crib\nand\nyou get from the world\nwhat you project into the world and you\nproject into the world\nwhat you were raised with and what you\nwere raised around so that's why what\nhappened to you is the essential\nquestion\nso beautifully said and i i wish my\nbrain had aha moments that sound like\nthat oprah too so\ni love that\nand dr perry i'd love to hear your\nthoughts\nwell i i come at this from a slightly\ndifferent perspective because i have a\nlong history of being a history fan and\nhad studied history\ngrowing up and was very well aware of\nthe relationship between\nthe things that happened in the past\nplaying a major role in how things were\nfunctioning currently and i think that\nthat's\ni think most people are able to kind of\nmake that connection but as i became a\nbiologist and learned about the\ndevelopment of the human body and the\nhuman brain\nit became clear that we have our own\npersonal history and that the things\nthat happened in our life shape the\nsystems in our brain that influence how\nwe think about things how we feel about\nthings and how we behave and it really\nit it leads to a completely different\napproach to getting to know somebody you\nyou you enter the interaction\nwith a curious mindset you're curious\nabout like what\nwhat's going on i mean\nand and it really i think is as oprah\nsays it it really opens up this\nnew perspective on understanding a\nperson you can be much more empathic\nwith them as opposed to being so\njudgmental\nyeah for me that reframing that you both\nhave so beautifully\nilluminated in this book is is so subtle\nbut it's so powerful because it removes\nthat\njudgment it removes that negative\nobservation that criticism that\nthat fear that people feel on the\nreceiving end of that as well to me just\nthat switch of question is is so\npowerful so what i want to do now is i\nwant to ask you both questions uh\nthroughout the different chapters of the\nbook says no one really has it till\ntoday\nand i'd like to start with you dr perry\nand ask you what what happened to you\nwhat inspired you to study child trauma\nyou know where did your journey start\nand why did it become so important to\nyou because obviously this is something\nthat you've done for decades\ntell us about the beginning of that\njourney\n[Music]\nwell it started kind of randomly because\nwhen i went to college at stanford they\nhave a freshman seminar\nprocess where they take incoming\nfreshmen and they assign them to\nsome eminent faculty member and then for\nevery week for the whole year you meet\nwith that person\nand you get to know their work and have\nconversations it's a great experience\nand i was randomly assigned to\nseymour levine who is the grandfather\nand now great grandfather of almost all\nof the big stress researchers in our\nfield\nand he had just been doing a series of\nstudies looking at how you could take a\nlittle rat pop\nand give it a tiny little bit of stress\nhandling stress you just take it out of\nit the litter\nhold it and then put it back after a\ncertain period of time and then let the\nanimal grow up\nand then when they looked at those\nanimals their brain was very different\nthan the brains of animals that didn't\nhave that tiny little stress\nand i thought that was\nstunning that you could have an\nexperience that was literally minutes\nlong\nand it would influence in a lifelong way\nthe functioning of this really critical\nset of systems in your brain that are\ninvolved in how how every organ in your\nbody functions\nand from that point forward i was\nstudying\nthe development of the stress response\nsystems in animals and then got into\nclinical work and it's interesting you\nknow going back to what oprah said about\nlabels\nwhen you go into mental health and start\nto get trained\nthere's a manual that people use that\nthe dsm and it's full of labels and it's\nbased on the symptoms that somebody has\nand basically it's a big book that says\nwhat's wrong with you\nand it doesn't say what happened to you\nand so i was a developmentalist\nand i had been studying the brain and i\nwent into the field and i'm like wait a\nminute\nthere's about 30 different ways that you\ncan become inattentive you know you can\nhave attention problems from\nhyperthyroidism and developmental trauma\nand you know lead toxicity and all kinds\nof things\nwe need to ask\nyou know we need to get to know the\npeople that were giving these labels and\nif we did that i think that we would\nstop giving them labels and start giving\nthem some solutions\nabsolutely absolutely thank you so much\nfor sharing that and\noprah as you were saying earlier it's\nthe book is full of stories and the\nscience\nand when i was reading about your own\nchildhood stories and trauma traumas in\nthis book it's it's difficult at times\nand it's challenging but at the same\ntime your level of honesty and\ntransparency is is genuinely such an\ninspiration for myself and countless\nother people who are struggling as well\nand you know when i was diving into the\nbook there were there were moments where\ni just\ni was so grateful to you for what you\nshared\nand you know you open up about a story\nabout how your grandmother used to whip\nyou over the smallest most insignificant\nthings like\nspilling a glass of water\nand this horse\nright exactly breaking a plate and this\nharsh\nthis harsh behavior was normal for you\nas a kid and you said something in the\nbook that really stood out to me you\nsaid that\nthe long-term impact of being whipped\nturned you into a world-class\npeople-pleaser for most of your life i\nwant to know\nhow did you become aware of that\nconnection between that\nexperience as a child\nand how it was being lived today\nand how did that start to help you on\nyour journey\nwell thank you so much i'm so\nmoved that you were touched by that\nstory because i until\ni was a full-grown adult\nand i met my best friend gail gail is\nthe first black person i ever met who\nwasn't whipped as a child i mean she was\nthe first person i ever encountered so\nit is a part of\nthe black culture\nto\nnot just spank your children\nuh almost everybody you run into of a\ncertain age was whipped as a child so\nthat was such the norm for me\nthat writing about it\num\nfor the first time\nis the first time i actually recognized\noh this is not a normal thing\num\nso\nto\nreally i was in a board room\nhaving to confront someone\nin my 40s\nand i had so much anxiety\nabout the fact that i was going to have\nto have this confrontation with somebody\nand it just just just the most\num\nnormal disagreements would cause me a\ngreat sense of angst and worry and oh my\ngod and what's going to happen and i\njust said what where is this coming from\nwhy am i so afraid when i am the one in\nthe power seat i am oprah winfrey\nrunning the harpo studios my name\nspelled backwards i'm the person in\ncharge and in order to have a\ndisagreement with somebody i go through\nso\nmuch angst and i realized jay\nthat\neven though i had the power i still felt\nthat every confrontation i was gonna get\na whipping\nthat a whipping was gonna result that\nthat thing that cut that used to come up\ninside me when i had to walk to get my\nown switch oh where is this feeling\ncoming i'm feeling like in every\nconfrontation i'm gonna get a whippin\nand at the end of it that person's going\nto be mad at me and at the end of it\nthat person is going to say you better\nnot act like you're mad you know all the\nthings that happened to me as a kid so\nit wasn't until i was a full-grown adult\nin my own seat of\nyou know perceived power\nfeeling those feelings of anxiety and\nanxiousness having to have the slightest\nbit of confrontation so what i say in\nwhat happened to me is that being beaten\nas a child\num having to be subservient to other\npeople's ideals of what it means to be a\nchild meaning you are seen and not heard\nso i've grown up to have this big\npersonality but being raised in an\nenvironment where children are seen and\nnot heard and your opinions do not\nmatter so what happened to me taught me\nthat my opinions do not matter keep your\nopinions to yourself and do whatever you\ncan to please other people so that other\npeople will like you so that other\npeople will not be upset with you and i\nwill have to tell you it is also for me\nnot for everybody else but for me\none of the reasons why i was so\nsusceptible to sexual abuse\nbecause i had been taught and trained\nnot to speak up for myself that whatever\nsomebody wanted to do who was older than\nme or in a position of authority that\nthey had rights i that i did not so that\nwhat happened to me was ingrained in a\nway that\nyou know literally\ncaused me to be a major people pleaser\nfor for a great deal of my life\nthank you for sharing that that full\njourney and just i really gravitate\ntowards that statement you said around\nhow we\nwhen we normalize something we don't\nactually even recognize the trauma in it\nwe don't even realize that it that\nthere's any it was just normal to you\nyou just expected it and\ni think that really brings us nicely uh\ndr perry to this this thought about\nwhat's something you talk about how\nwe're loved in the book\nand you know you say that a common\nphrase people use whenever a child acts\nout is that he or she must not have been\nloved as a child right and in the book\nyou go on to explain that how it isn't a\nmatter of how many hugs and kisses you\nreceived as a kid\nuh so for the parents watching and i'm\nsure there are many parents watching and\nfor those of you are watching right now\nand enjoying this conversation i highly\nrecommend to make sure that you go and\norder yourself a copy of the book\nbut for those of you that are watching\nand dr perry when you think about this\nwhat should parents\nbe thinking about differently or doing\ndifferently\nthat many of them may be missing today\nand the idea of wanting to give love and\noften our perspective on what love is or\nour definition of what love is feels\nlike hugs and kisses\nwell first of all\nto clarify love\nhugs and kisses are nice things and and\nthey can be part of a really positive\nloving environment\nbut\none of the things about the brain is\nthat these systems in our brain that\nallow us to form relationships and\nmaintain them in a healthy way the\nsystems that allow us to love\nand be empathy can become ultimately\nhumane\nthese systems develop like any other\nsystem in the brain that require\nrepetition repetition repetition\nthat when you want to get better at\npiano you have to practice your piano\nand you want to get better at reading\nyou need to read and read and read and\nif you want to develop the capacity\nto form a healthy loving relationship\nyou need\nlots of tiny little doses of attentive\nattuned responsive\nnurturing interaction with people around\nyou\nand\nyou know a lot of people grow up and and\nagain this is this this is language\nthat's not uncommon in our world is it\nit's the quality and not the quantity\nyou know so if you give your child a\nlittle quality time\nuh then that is somehow supposed to\novercome the fact that you're gone for\nfive days of the week and it just\ndoesn't it doesn't do that you know\nchildren need your presence even if it's\nyour neutral presence and they come over\nand they give you a hug and they wander\naway they come over and they ask a\nquestion and they wander away and they\nneed lots of tiny little doses of\npositive interaction\nand now one of the challenges in our\nmodern world is that we have so many\nisolated single caregivers parents who\nmay have multiple children who need that\nand since in the modern world we've\nmoved away from having aunties and\ngrandparents and neighbors playing a\nrole in this sort of\ncommunity caregiving model\nwe've got tons of exhausted overwhelmed\ncaregivers who are trying to do their\nvery best\nbut there's just no physical way\npossible that they could meet all of\nthese needs of these children and so i\nthink that that's a big\na burden that our society needs to\naddress\nand think about how to create more\nrelationally enriched environments to\nsupport our young parents because the\nvast majority of them would do the right\nthings they'd just be drawn to do the\nright things if they weren't exhausted\nworn out worried about housing worried\nabout food\nyou know we we structurally contribute\nto the inability of these caregivers to\nprovide those loving environments\nyeah one of the things dr perry says in\nthe book uh jay is that we're the only\ncountry in the world that does this that\nwe're the only country that expects a\nsingle mother to be everything and all\nthings you know to children whereas\nother countries where there is uh\nnumber one a greater respect for the\nelders and the elders involvement in the\nchild's development and aunties and\ncousins and family members and so when\nyou don't have that\nuh\nthese moms which i feel so deeply for\nmoms who are trying to do it all it's\nimpossible to be able to do it all\nright\nit is and\nand the thing for an infant and a child\ngrowing up\nlove isn't the feeling the parent has\nfor the child\nlove is an action right\nlove is sort of\nnight after night after night after\nnight getting up and meeting their\nfundamental needs when they're hungry\nthirsty cold\nand and\nover time as they build in these\nneurobiological capabilities\nto mature\nthen you can move to more emotional\nvariations of that equivalent of love so\nnow that we're adults we can actually\nsay you know what there's somebody in my\npast who was present attentive and i\nlove that person and and if you if you\nknow that's that is love but your\nability to sort of\nbuild that much more advanced\nneurobiological capability emerge from\nthousands and thousands and thousands of\nrepetitions of these loving nurturing\nrelations relational interactions i\nthink that's such a great point because\nuh as i grew older and it wasn't just my\ngrandmother whipping me but other people\ni remember getting a whipping once and\nhaving uh you know one of my relatives\nsay i i'm whipping you because i love\nyou well it certainly didn't feel like\nlove certainly didn't feel like love but\ni know\nthat for that generation the idea of i'm\ngoing to keep you in line and i'm going\nto make sure you're disciplined and that\nyou're going to obey and do the right\nthing in their minds might have felt\nlike love but certainly did not feel\nlike or was interpreted by me to mean\nlove i mean i think for anybody who's\nlistening to us or watching right now\nand i know if you are culturally raised\nuh the way i was\nyou have a lot of\nof pain behind those whippings and i\nremember doing a show on the oprah show\nyears later talking about should\nchildren be spanked and a black woman\nstood up and said well i got beat every\nday and my father i was in the choir and\nmy father beat me in front of the whole\ncongregation in church and i turned out\nokay and i'm like did you really because\nnobody\nanybody who's ever been hit\nrealizes the humiliation of that what\nyou feel more than anything\neven as a little kid\nis the humiliation of it and what you\nare being told in that moment is that\nyou have no value that you are worth\nnothing that you are so worthless that i\nget now\nto lay my hands on you and physically\nbeat you so it takes a lot and i i would\nhave to say\nthat um\nit was a lot for me to overcome\nto\nbegin to understand\nthat my life was of value and as i say\nin what happened to you\nwhat did that for me were relationships\nwith my teachers i could cry right now\nthinking about\nthe the teachers who stood in\nthe gap for me\nand made me feel\nvalued made me feel important so it was\nonly at school\nor speaking in church that i felt a\nsense of i mattered\nthat there was some\nmeaning and and and purpose for me in\nlife and so\nyou know\nas\nwhen i was talking to bruce in 60\nminutes i said bruce please explain to\nme why i'm not crazy because\nbecause i you know grew up in these\ncircumstances where\ni should have no self-values no\nself-worth but bruce as he explains in\nwhat happened to you you don't have to\nhave it come from your family\nother relationships with people who are\nnurturing supporting caring and actually\njust see you so the reason why i love\nschool so much is because that's the\nplace that i felt seen\nyeah\nit makes me so happy to hear you both\ngive people the permission to realize\nthat they don't have to\nhave it all figured out and that they\ncan't have it all figured out and that\nit's we're all trying to be the perfect\nparent the perfect person the perfect\nprofessional the perfect partner and\nperfection's impossible as it is but\neven at striving for it you're giving\neveryone the permission to realize and\nalso i love that point that was just\nmade around how\nthis is not just what's happening at\nhome it can be\nheightened or amplified by what happens\nat school or it can be nurtured and\nnourished and improved as well by what\nhappens and oprah one of the things you\ntalk about in the book when we're\ntalking about the need for rhythm\nand balance and that's what i think this\nbook does so beautifully is what this\nbook allowed me to do was\nfeel vulnerably but then project that\nonto a framework of how to think about\nit and and i think that that is such a\nrefreshing thing because often we're\ntold to be vulnerable and be open and\nthen you you let it all out and then\nyou're like oh well this is just a mess\ni don't know where to put it all and\nthen you know this book allows you to\nkind of go okay well that makes sense\nand this is how i place this\nhow did you\nhow do you recommend for people to find\nthe time\nto\ncreate rhythms i know you say you block\nout the sunday to be with yourself and\nspend time walking in nature trying not\nto be distracted for anyone right now\nwho's saying i i recognize from hearing\nboth of you that i must have some trauma\nwhere do i where do i find the time to\nunpack it how do i make time for that\nand where do i start\nwell you start with understanding that\nyour cup being full is how you allow\nyourself to give to other people\nyou you can't give what you don't have\nyou can't love if you haven't been loved\nyou don't even know how to begin to do\nthat so i think it begins with\nfundamentally understanding that you are\nworthy enough you are valuable enough\nyou matter enough to give yourself\nthe love that you deserve and that\nstarts by taking out time for yourself\nso i have my own rhythm and pattern i\nknow that if i go six days and then on\nthe seventh by the seventh or eighth\ndon't give myself a break\nthat\nlots of other things give\nthat i'm not as alert i'm not as attuned\ni'm not as centered i'm not as focused\nso i know that that is that is my limit\ni cannot go beyond a certain amount of\ndays and for me um walking in nature uh\nis my solace it is where i feel that i\nam\none with all and all being you know all\ncreation and\nyou know connected for other people it\nmay be dancing it may be music it may be\nknitting it may be whatever it is that\nbrings some kind of rhythmic pattern\ninto your life actually it was bruce and\ni were walking on my campus in south\nafrica and there are a group of girls\ndancing\nliterally on the lawn because lord knows\nthey love to dance and bruce says oh\nthat's not just i said oh they're just\nhaving fun and bruce said oh they're not\njust having fun they actually are\nhealing themselves because\nthe rhythmic pattern that's why when\nyou've been in an argument with someone\nor you're in the middle of an argument\nwith somebody\nif you just go and take a walk or you go\nand turn on some music and you start\ndancing if you just have some form of\nmovement you feel better that's number\none number two one of the most important\nthings most most important takeaways\nfrom\nwhat happened to you i believe is\nunderstanding how the brain works and\nthat diagram that's on page 26 or 27\nabout the inverted brain being like a\ntriangle so you see that beginning with\nthe brain stem that's the lower part of\nthe brain all the way to the cortex and\nthrough the limbic area you understand\nthat\nwe're looking at it right there um you\nunderstand that when you're upset or in\nfear or angry or are in in an\nantagonized state and you're trying to\nreason with a person a child your spouse\nyour boss your friend\nthey literally\ncannot hear you\nbecause the reasoning part of the brain\nis in the cortex\nand\nwhat you're saying is only reaching the\nbrain stem\nso whenever somebody is dysregulated\nwhich is what that is being anxious and\nfearful in yelling and screaming\nthe thing to do is to calm yourself\nfirst\nthen you will be able to\nhelp that other person\nget calm and regulated\nthat's how you get to reason but if you\nboth are just yelling at each other\nliterally you're going you don't hear me\nand you don't hear me either and you let\nher they actually cannot hear you that's\nwhat i thought was so fascinating i\nthink i explained it well right yes i'm\njust sitting here smiling do you concur\ndr perry do you concur i just want to\nmake sure because i do i do i have\noperations this is actually\na lot of fun\noprah's just to become a neuroscientist\nso\nwe're going to expect you to now tell a\nstory\nto trade to trade to trade places uh but\nyou know i'm so it's so amazing to hear\nyou explain that and that's exactly what\ni meant by giving a framework to\nreally look at it in such a clear way\nin a way that we're often not encouraged\nto see it because it sounds too\ndifficult or too complicated but to to\nsimplify that idea is that here's what\nyou think's going on and here's what's\nhappening inside your brain\nand dr perry when you when you dive into\nthe science you quote a study in a\nsurvey\nthat said that almost 50 percent of\nchildren in the united states have had\nat least one significant traumatic\nexperience\nbut a lot of people will still deny\never having experienced trauma a lot of\npeople will feel uncomfortable\nadmitting and accepting that they have\nexperienced some trauma what are some of\nour\nmisconceptions around what trauma is\nand how it affects us and would you mind\nexplaining what sort of experiences are\ndefined as traumatic to help us expand\nour definition\nso\nmost of us first heard\nthe concept of sort of trauma as we're\ntalking about it now in context of\npost-traumatic stress disorder\nand combat veterans and so even within\nour field in psychiatry the majority of\npeople who studied\ntrauma and looked at trauma we're\nlooking at the effects of these horrific\nevents exposure to combat death of a a\nof a\nsoldier next to you\nas\nyou know the thing to understand around\ntrauma but over time\nthe\npeople like me who were studying the\nstress response systems in in animal\nmodels\nwere very uh well aware that it's not\nnecessarily these big traumatic events\nthat are easily identified by everybody\nas a trauma that will lead to the\nchanges in the brain that cause the\nproblems\nand so certainly if you do have these\nevents\nthat can be a problem so natural\ndisaster house fire\ncar accident you know abuse of all sorts\nthat's certainly traumatic\nbut probably the most important thing\nand and i think the thing that's\nimpacting more children and adults than\nanything else\nare experiences that are\npatterns of stress activation\nwhere you have no control over the\nexperience it's not predictable\nand it's prolonged it's ongoing and i\nthink in to some degree the experiences\nof the last year\nuh are\nan example for many people of a\nprolonged\nset of uncontrollable and unpredictable\nstressors and we've all felt sort of our\nbaseline level of tolerance is going\ndown we're a little bit more tired we\ncan handle situations a little bit less\nand so what we've been studying is\nthe combination of these experiences\nwhere you are\nnot in control of your life\nand it may be a child who's living in a\ndomestic violence environment where\nhe or she is not the direct target of\nall of this stuff but\nthere's so much unpredictability about\nwhen the fighting is going to happen and\nthere's so much unpredictability about\nwhether mom is gonna be in a good mood\ntoday or a bad mood or dad's gonna be\nangry or not angry and that can lead to\nthese physiological changes\nthat increase your risk for physical\nhealth problems mental health problems\nand learning problems and so that's kind\nof where we're moving in the field is\nthis recognition that\nyou don't just\nhave to\nhave some sort of capital t trauma in\nyour life to be impacted by trauma and\nin fact if you are\na\nminority in a majority culture you're\ngoing to get all kinds of experiences\nwhere you're getting\nthese relational interactions that are\nnot are sending the signal that you\ndon't belong\nwhich will activate your stress response\nwhich can over time accumulate and\ninfluence your physical and mental\nhealth\nyeah thank you dr perry for\nyou know illuminating on that point\nbecause i think for so many of us as you\nrightly just said that we feel that\ntrauma only means trauma with a capital\nt\nand so we often disregard we often let\nthese things just\nfade away and\nyou know put them under the carpet and\njust just not not really give them\nenough emphasis and focus because we\ndon't see them as being significant and\nso\nyes oprah\ni wanted to say\nthat one of them one of the most\nimportant points i think dr perry makes\nin what happened to you is that\nneglect\nis as toxic as trauma\nand so even though you might not have\nhad a trauma with the big t\nthat\nit boils down to did you get what you\nneeded\nand i have done so many interviews as i\nknow you have too jay with people who\nare raised in the same family\nand\neverybody in that family has a different\nexperience and sometimes siblings are\narguing about a thing that happened\nbecause from their point of view it felt\nlike one thing and from the other\nperson's point of view it felt like\nanother thing well that is the reality\nof life\nthat you can have\ntwo children four children six children\nraised in the same household\nand they experience the love of their\nparents differently\nand not all the kids\ncould have gotten what they needed and\nsome of the kids got what they needed so\nneglect is\nyou not getting what you needed\nfor your worldview for your personal um\napproach to life your sense of self\nvalues your your sense of self-esteem\nand so i i i have seen in the thousands\nof interviews that i've done over the\nyears that the level of dysfunction in a\nper person's life is almost\ndirectionally directionally directly\nproportional to how they were loved what\nhappened to them and how they were able\nto receive or not receive that love so\nthe the what happened to you isn't\nyou know just for people who had the big\nt traumas but it literally is what\nhappened to you\nwere you loved were you not how were you\nloved how was that love applied in your\nlife and were you able then to apply it\nin the rest of the world so i know many\npeople are listening\nwho didn't get what they needed and i\nsay this to my girls in south africa all\nthe time because\nso many of them were born during the\nyear of\nuh uh during the decade where\nso many of their parents died of aids\nand they have this sense of abandonment\nliterally going from one family to the\nnext family member and then that family\nmember dying and that family member\ndying and when you grow up feeling\nabandoned\nand certainly abandoned from an early\nage\nyou\n[Music]\nyour world view is that people are going\nto abandon you in their relationships\nand so you either go into those\nrelationships being very needy and\nafraid that this person's gonna leave me\nor you go into those relationships being\nvery jealous and you know uh holding on\nand having to know where you've been and\nlooking at people's cell phones and all\nof that because you're afraid that\nyou're gonna leave me and so\nwhat happened to you no matter who you\nare is important in understanding why\nyou have the world view that you do\ni was\nsharing and making a lot of videos and i\nstarted committing more to creating more\namazing content that i loved and enjoyed\nand we made some amazing videos last\nyear and the number one thing i used to\nhear from everyone else and this wasn't\nthe voice in my head this was the voice\nof the noise of outside was jay when are\nyou going to get like media like when is\nlike someone you know when is media\ngoing to take notice of you like when is\nthis going to be and it was so\ninteresting because that last point you\nmade of it was patience yeah that had to\nbe practiced yeah and for me it was not\nlike oh my god that's gonna and i was\nlike that's interesting because people\nare\nsaying that that's when they all\naccept that this is successful right and\ni had to make a choice yeah whether i\nwas going to let that definition define\nthat i've been successful now oh do i\nfeel successful now because i'm doing\nwhat i love every day and i really enjoy\nit and it's helping people beautiful and\nand i think that that was such a\ndistinct thing for me because and then\nwhen i let go of that and had that\npatience then this year a lot of that\ncame then you're on ellen you know\ncorrect and all of that came totally\norganically none of it was maneuvered\nyou didn't care you weren't trying you\nwere having fun exactly you were a prime\nexample of what it means to be a super\nattractor you're in joy you're having\nfun you're not attached to the outcome\nthat's how your entire career began i'm\nnot attached to the outcome and i'm just\ngoing to do something in the in in\nservice and love and inspiration and\nit's going to become this thing and\nthat's how i've built my career too yeah\nand what about when so i love what you\nyou gave a great example there of how\npeople are scared to you know like you\ndon't want people to pick up the phone\ncall in that fear you want them to do\ntheir joints how do people make that\nswitch from fear to joy and service if\nsomeone's honest with themselves and\nthey say gabby right now i'm just scared\nlike i'm just living i would tell\nsomeone like sometimes you just have to\npick up the phone and ask for the job\nbecause this is the window you have sure\nso i would you know say meditate before\nand say prayers before and turn it over\nand prepare prepare energetically to the\nbest of your ability and then also think\nabout this is a big one like think about\nhow that desire is backed with service\nand love because as soon as you get into\nthat energy you feel good and it's no\nlonger about what you think you need\nit's about bringing something greater to\nthe world and so when i would want\nsomething big in my life whether it was\na media placement or a baby or anything\ni was always if i felt like i was\nstrangling the desire i would always\nreturn to why this was going to bring\nlight to the world\nand that i mean that's where and that's\nwhen the moment you go there you feel\nbetter yeah and that's the action that\nyou want to take place from that place\nof action 100 i'm i'm so happy that\nyou're saying this right now because i\ncouldn't agree more yeah that's the only\nthing that keeps me going makes you wake\nup in the morning i say to people all\nthe time like i believe there are there\nare services driven creators\nentrepreneurs business people whatever\nlist goes on and then there are\nlifestyle business people entrepreneurs\net cetera lifestyle people are the ones\nthat do it because they want to live on\na beach and have a comfy life and then\nthe service ones are the ones you're\njust going to keep doing i mean you're\non your seventh book right now i'll be\nwriting books the rest of my life yeah\nexactly and if that isn't service i'm\nwriting a new one right now no don't i\nmean\nlet's let's focus on this one we got to\nfocus on this one but yeah\noh i didn't realize you were okay fine\ni'm working on i'm working on an audible\noriginal okay yeah yeah and it's called\nfiction and non-fiction um of course\nit's non-fiction\num but yeah no yeah it's sort of an\naudio experience but it is non-fiction\nself-help yeah oh cool i'm excited for\nthat so it's totally it's only audible\nstarting off was only audible and then i\ncan in a year from then turn it into a\nbook if i want to but that sounds fun\nyeah i love that yeah that's awesome uh\ntell me about you've said that you're no\nlonger in that hustle mode but you have\nbeen before oh yeah so\nyeah so julie not there right yeah so\nwas that were you still\nbeing a super attracted then or was that\nblocking you yes and no like it was\nmurky right because i was attracting a\nlot but i was probably really limiting\nmy capacity and so it's like you know um\nwe we often you know don't realize that\nlike we are we were functioning at a\nfraction of what we're capable of\nand so\ni definitely was like even though i was\nhustling and i was having fun and i was\nin service and i was enjoying things\nwere happening you know books were\ncoming out they were they were you know\nhelping people saving lives right but i\nbut i was definitely blocking the full\ncapacity of what i could be creating and\ngiving because i was i was hustling i\nwas a work addict you know for many big\nreasons right you know i've talked very\npublicly about you know didn't realize\nthat i had had trauma until i remembered\nit in 2016. it was when i remembered my\ntrauma that i started to truly heal my\naddictive patterns you know i was like i\ngot sober 14 years ago and then yeah\nthat's amazing by the way\nand then i you know and then i and then\ni became a work addict and and i always\nfelt like oh my work is in the pursuit\nof something so magical and so great and\nsuch great service that it's okay to be\na work addict hell no hell no it took me\ndown\nbut then i remembered my trauma and then\nin the recovery from really healing my\ntrauma past and really working really\nthrough it and becoming more and more\nfree and more free today than i've ever\nbeen\nin that journey i i started to see that\nthat the the pushing and the controlling\nwas the the and the opposite of who i\nbelieved i wanted to be\nand so at that point i i really just\nstarted to accept that i didn't i could\nhave a no stress policy\nand that i could do less and attract\nmore i could begin to rely on other\npeople\nand because look you know i could have\nbeen in the same position right having a\nteam having publishers that were\nsupporting me all that and still not\nletting go\ni could have still been fully in control\ntrying to hold everything even with\nthose resources so it doesn't matter\nlike what you have it's about your\nmental choice and so in that choice i\nsaid you know\ni'm gonna focus on my art i'm gonna\nfocus on my gift and i'm gonna allow the\nuniverse to support me and work through\npeople and i'm gonna i'm gonna give it\nover yeah so i'm relaxed\ni love that would you say in that that\nearly phase the hustle was critical and\nwould you say for others it is as well i\nwouldn't change it right but had i been\naware of my trauma\nyou know or had i not had trauma behind\nit i could have had the hustle\nwithout so much pain\nthere was a lot of pain and suffering\nin that hustle\nthat i wasn't able to recognize at the\ntime because i felt so proud and so\nexcited about what i was doing i wasn't\nable to recognize i was in a tremendous\namount of pain\nso yeah so so if someone's listening and\nthey're thinking well gaby i'm really\nworking hard right now\nyou'd say as long as you're dealing with\nthat trauma that's there or you're\nreflecting on well if you're working\nreally hard\nand it's because you're trying to prove\nyourself because you have a wound that\nyou haven't healed then go heal the\nwound got it because everything will\nfollow\nif you're working really hard because\nyou think you need to get ahead or\nwhatever there's probably a wound there\nright um\nand a belief system that like if i'm not\npushing and controlling it's not going\nto happen and so you know i think that\nthe thing i would tell my younger self\nis that\nyou know trust more\nand\nno i actually don't think i would tell\nmy younger self anything because i think\neverything worked out exactly as it was\nmeant to\nyeah i read somewhere recently that a\nlot of\nsuccessful people in general whether\nspiritual or not\nhave to have the belief that everything\nhappened at the right time or everything\nhappens for a reason and when i read\nthat i thought interesting because so\nmany people see that as a cliche so many\npeople see it as\nbut when i read that actually both\nspiritual and non-spiritually successful\npeople would say that that's how they\nsee things because you're now looking at\nlife as life is taking care of me you're\nnow looking at life is teaching me when\ni need to life is keeping me where i am\nwhere i need to be seeing the difficult\nmoments as opportunities that are\nrevealing to you what you still need to\nheal\nand so when you when you flip your\nperspective of the difficult times and\nchoose to see those difficult times as\nspiritual assignments to to grow to be\nto be closer to\nyour source inspiration love joy\nthen it it turns it turns into a miracle\nyou know i just um i'm five months into\nrecovery from postpartum depression and\nanxiety and insomnia which was jay the\nmost the\ni'm gonna say the f word but the most\n[ __ ] up experience of my life wow and\nuh right now i'm really feeling great\nand i'm feeling really proud and really\ngrateful that that happened because i\ncan help save women's lives as a result\nof being able to talk about it with\nauthenticity i can help be a better\nvoice for mental illness because i've\nexperienced it i can be a guide for\npeople who need medical support when\nthey really need it\nand i wouldn't change a thing absolutely\nand thank you for sharing that again and\ntalking so openly about it i think\nthat's ultimately like the\nunderline to any major because we're\ntalking about victor franco obviously\nand man says for me he talks about it so\nbeautifully of just like how he couldn't\nmake that situation good yeah but he\nknew that if he dealt with it in the\nright way that that would then teach\npeople in the future that's right and\nand i think that that's such a great\nit's always the underline to any pain\nyeah because you're right that in that\nmoment you couldn't be just happy in it\nin all of a sudden i just burst out into\nlike\nlaughter but you know that that\nexperience has now given you a whole new\ngroup of people to serve and share\ntotally totally and i think all of us\nwho anyone who's listening right now or\nwatching right now and going through any\nsort of pain i genuinely think that's\nthe underlying point if you can't find\nany other answer that probably is it\nyeah that you're you're being sent a\nparticular gift yeah that you will then\nbe able to open other people yeah i\nreally hope that the people can take\nthat in\nand you know i write in the book that\nthe the key to feeling good is to decide\nto stop feeling bad and that could be\nreally offensive to certain people out\nthere that are depressed or broke or you\nknow\nill or you know whatever it may be but i\ni tell the story of my postpartum as a\ntrue honest authentic example of how\nwhen i was in the most the darkest\nmoment of my life suicidal\nsuicidal\nthat i could\nstill decide to feel good\nin the most subtle ways so like\nallowing myself to accept support was a\nway of allowing myself to feel good\nright or deciding to feel good uh\nbeing open to a medical path that i\nnever would have contemplated being on\nwas a decision to feel good right so\nit's um there was a lot of that\ndecisioning that that decision making\nin that dark low moment\nso somebody is in a critical moment\nright now listening to this\nthe fact that they're listening was a\ndecision to feel good\nabsolutely yeah 100\nhow do you how do you take that\nalmost like the crazy high-end low of\nlike you know you you've waited you've\nthought about it you super attracted a\nbeautiful baby and then you go through\ndepression afterwards\nand it's like how do you\ngo through that in your mind from the\npoint of view of like the the extreme\nhigh of waiting for this being patient\nfor it it's amazing and then the next\nthing you know\nyou're at one of the lowest points like\nhow do you mentally even just\nrally around that i think that my faith\nis what got me through\nbecause i knew i was being guided even\nif i felt at the darkest time i knew\nthat i was being guided and when i\nstarted to really\nsurrender\nwas when the guidance could really come\nthrough\nand now\nin recovery\ni am actually quite grateful for it\nbecause i have like an even greater\nappreciation for my son than i probably\nwould have had i not been through it\nbecause every moment that i have with\nhim i'm just like relishing in it\nbecause\nbecause\nwhen i wasn't in that space and i\ncouldn't recognize him and i was scared\nof him\ni\ni now know that i can celebrate the\ngreat joy of not being there um\nyeah\nit's just it fascinates me because\nwhenever i'm listening to you and even\nin the book it's like faith comes out so\nstrongly\nand i think that's ultimately where so\nmany people\nfeel so challenged by because they're\nlike what do i have faith in right well\nthat's that's what all my books are i\nknow i know yeah my all my books are\nreally about helping people decide what\nthey have faith in correct and giving\nthem an opportunity to crack open to a\nhigher power of their own understanding\nas they say in the 12 steps a higher\npower of your own understanding and you\nknow that language is is very free\nthat's why there's a lot of freedom in\nthat language because anyone that's\nlistening i don't i don't care if they\ncall it god i don't care if they call it\nuniverse i don't even care if they just\ncall it inspiration you know inspiration\nsomeone may be like i don't think\nthere's something outside of me but i\nknow that i can receive inspiration and\nwhen i follow these steps i'll feel that\ninspiration and that intuition that's\nperfect yeah so your approach is very so\nwhen you start to have faith in that\ninspiration then life gets easier yeah\nand i think that's what it is and i love\nthat you've just said that that's what\nyour books are about i think\nultimately life is a part of us figuring\nout what we have faith in because you're\ngoing to have to have faith\nright whether it's well i think a lot of\npeople walk around sorry to interrupt\nyou but they walk around thinking that\nthey that their their faith relies in\ntheir own will and that's where they get\ninto a lot of trouble right uh really\nreally be learning to live in a way\nwhere we are no longer it's not my way\nor the highway and we are starting to\nhave this trust that we can turn things\nover and we can lean into a better\nfeeling and then be guided yeah then\nthen life gets really groovy i mean just\nover the last few days it's like at one\npoint i was just feeling like a little\nbeat up because i've been like running\nand moving and i'm here traveling with\nmy family and i was just feeling it and\nthen i just said to my i said i prayed\nand i said\nthank you\nspirit you know energy of the highest\ngood\nfrom for for giving me strength and\ngiving me energy to get through all\nthese beautiful opportunities and to\nshow up for them with joy and and and\nservice and and not you know not being\nover tired and beaten down yeah and as\nsoon as i said that prayer i mean energy\njust started to move through me\nand\neven though i'm tired i'm super pumped\nto be here and i'm super pumped to go to\nthe next thing and you know yeah so it's\neasy to say when you're doing awesome\nthings like this but\nbut i needed that strength yeah and so i\nthink that once we start to have that\nrelationship with our higher power we\ncan stop trying to control things and we\ncan give them away yeah and and i think\ni mean when you were saying that it's\nunfortunate i'm only thinking of a\nfiction movie but i think it's an\nimportant reference\nhave you seen doctor strange no okay so\ndoctor strange is awesome you would love\nit okay and and the great i'm gonna give\naway the whole movie now so\nmaybe you should\nokay spoilers i have to i have to i have\nthe amazing thing about the movie is\nit's based on a doctor who's highly\nreputed who really understands his craft\nand his faith is in his hands yeah and\nhis ability yeah to\nheal people yeah as a surgically healed\npeople not not spiritually heal people\nand what ends up happening is he has an\naccident\nwhich takes away his physical ability to\nhave the stability in his hands to\nperform any surgical procedure\nthat he then turns to alternative parts\nyeah now it's a fiction story but i'm\nand i would love to hear if you know\nanyone who's had a similar story we hear\nabout so many stories like that or meet\ni mean so many people like that who were\nbillionaires initially and valued\neverything they had in their money and\nthen they lost that money and then that\nchanged them or someone who had a value\nin one of their physical attributes\nwhether it was their beauty or their\nstrength and then that was taken away\nfrom them but then they found it\nsomewhere else and i think that's what i\nfind so\nincredibly\ntelling of what you're saying right now\nas the best example of it is that you\nfind that that when your faith is simply\nin your physical self it's just\nconsistently broken it's called body\nidentification yes and when you're stuck\nin that body identification you've\ndisconnected from your spirit self the\nspirit identification i have a whole\nchapter in the book called lift the veil\nit's my favorite chapter in the book\nand i really pushed the metaphysical\nenvelope there and and it's and it's\nreally really talking about how we\nwe when we're in that body\nidentification you know my i am you know\nthis person and i am this author i am\nthis this business owner doctor whatever\nwe're actually blocking our greatest\nsource of power\nand so when we start to\nyou know use our bodies as a vessel\nthrough which we let spirit work through\nus that might sound really heady for\npeople but i can i can unpack it yeah do\nit unpack you yeah i think that when we\nstart to recognize that it's it's\nhow can i make this not too heady\nwhen we start to recognize that when we\nare attuned with the feeling of\ninspiration i keep coming back to\ninspiration to use as the mystifying\nword because i would call it spirit but\ninspiration is the same thing\nwe allow ourselves to be really in tune\nwith this inspiration we actually as we\nsaid before can expand time\nthe the the beautiful message that you\ngive to your child comes through you\nwhen you stop thinking about what you're\nsupposed to be saying and you allow what\nneeds to come through and so we're no\nlonger in the body and the pretense of\nwhat we think we should be doing and\nwe're actually in our spirit self using\nthe body as a vehicle through which we\nexpress truth and so uh when we can make\nthat adjustment\nyou know\nyou're unstoppable yeah and that\nrequires a\nset of daily practices like commitments\nbecause i feel like getting to that\npoint\nof even being able to let something work\nthrough you\ntakes time right like it takes your it's\nnot something that happens it's not\nsomething you can turn on and turn off\ninstantly you're possible it's possible\nfor someone to turn it on and and have\nthat quantum shift but okay but most\npeople i think they have to we've spent\nthey spent 30 you know 40 50 60 70 years\neven 10 years uh detouring into fear as\nof course in miracles would say yeah the\ncourse calls it the descent from\nmagnitude into littleness right so going\ndown that fear-based path repurposing it\nreplaying it recycling it making you\nknow creating more and more of it and\nreally believing in it that you know the\nyears that you spend in that that detour\ninto fear it's going to take a little\nwhile to unpack that and undo that but\nit doesn't mean need to take as much\ntime as it took to get there right right\nso that's where a spiritual path comes\nin that's where even a personal growth\npath you know just listening to you and\njust following this podcast is a part of\nthe process of unpacking and undoing the\nego\nuh so\nyou know it's it doesn't have to be a\npainful journey that's the other thing\nis people don't you know people think oh\nit's you know spirituality such a so\nmuch work well you know have fun along\nthe way enjoy it even if you're having\ntough experiences celebrate the miracle\nmoments yeah\ni always find that it's it's in\nhindsight it's always the process that\nyou fall in love with like it's almost\nlike and it is in hindsight but you have\nto start using that hindsight to do it\nin force it's almost like before i used\nto look back at things that i solved and\ni was like i was so fun trying to figure\nit out\nand so now i'm like okay let me just\nhave fun figuring it out that's right\nright does that make sense yeah yeah and\ni can look back you know i said like all\nthese years i've been suffering but i\ncan look back and be like i had a lot of\nfun\nyou know i was suffering i was going\nthrough stuff i wasn't aware of what i\nwas needing to heal i was trying to heal\ni was you know having anxiety whatever\nit was but i was in the pursuit of\nfeeling good and so that commitment\ncontinued to guide me to feeling\nmore and more\nhealth and well-being\n[Music]\nif everyone's listening right now and\nthey're like gabby i'm ready i'm gonna\ntry i'm gonna get this book because i\nthink i i need to because what i think\nyou're doing and i love that you do this\nand i said this to my team before you\ncame it's like i really think you're\nspiritually challenging people today\nyeah uh and i think that's a good thing\ni think we need that yeah because it's\neasy to sit on the side of just\nyou know just the the visible and you're\nreally pushing people into the invisible\nand every time i speak to you or i read\nyour work or i think about what you do\nfor the world i really think that's what\nyou do i think that's your superpower i\nthink you're you're really good at\nchallenging and pushing\nenough to\nprovoke people but not enough not too\nmuch where people are like oh my god\nthat's just i don't even want you to\nwake them up yeah yeah which we've\ntalked about before like to awaken\npeople if someone's like j uh gabby i'm\ngoing to buy the book today i'm going to\nread the book i'm going to start making\na commitment how can they get the most\nout of this book how should they read it\nhow should they approach it how should\nwhat should they be thinking of hmm good\nquestion um i would say just be open and\nwilling\nto see things differently\nand\ntake what works and resonates and don't\ndon't take what doesn't okay because if\nit doesn't resonate then you're gonna\nyou have another should you know i\nshould be thinking like that\nand the other thing that also happens\nwith books for me often is\nsomething will resonate the first read\nand then three years later i'll read it\nand it's like a whole new book you know\nyes yeah so trust that just let yourself\nbe cool with that yeah and don't don't\njudge your process and i always say to\npeople like if you take one lesson from\nthis book your life will change\nmy mission on social media is making\nwisdom go viral so it's like how do you\ntake this wisdom that's like hidden away\nit was only for the elite it was only\nfor people who went and had these crazy\nexperiences and adventures how do we\ntake that and spread it to everyone so\nthat that average kid in london where i\ngrew up or the average kid in new york\ncity where we are right now can come\nacross it and find it too they don't\nneed to go read a book right now they\ndon't need to go and travel halfway\nacross the world to find it and so with\nthat how did you start because you talk\nabout how at 40 you had a spiritual\nawakening how did you get to a point\nwhere you started to confront the fact\nthat there were beliefs pain trauma from\nyour past that you'd never faced before\nand that's what's clouding and blocking\nso many people today our mental health\nor our mental wealth is lost because\nwe're clouded by all this pain from the\npast challenges we never looked at how\ndid you start to confront that and where\ncan people start too mess for me\nyou know i started unpacking a lot of\nthat\nin therapy you know i always say that\nwhen it comes to therapy\nyou know therapy is like having a real\njunky closet so you got just a messy\ncloset everywhere so you start to pack\nup the things that you don't need and\nthings that don't serve you anymore and\nyou get rid of that and the things you\nwant to keep you hang up nice and neat\nand then you got room to bring new stuff\nin but you know to get to that point it\nwas just me\nnot only asking myself a whole lot of\nquestions having conversations with\nother people you know it's so funny man\ni got like friends who used to tell me\nthat they thought i was a sociopath\nbecause i didn't really show any\nemotions it didn't seem like anything\never got to me you know i i didn't have\nempathy for\nother people\nand some of that could have been true\nbut you know i just think that all of us\nare just so selfish so we're all just\nstuck in our own world and i mean i'm\nsure you can attest to the fact that\nwhen you really on your grind and you\ntrying to get it like you're not\nthinking about nobody else like when it\nwhen i was thinking about everybody else\nearly on in my career it was like\ni had a bunch of stuff weighing me down\nyou know and it's like yo you can't take\neverybody with you until you get to\nwhere you're supposed to go so i\nremember telling my homeboy dj frosty\nwhen i first got the job at the\nbreakfast club i said you know what i'm\ngonna do man this time around something\ni've never done before i'm gonna be\ncompletely selfish i said i'm gonna\nfocus on me and only me and then when i\nget to where i feel like i need to be\ni'm gonna you know start start bringing\neverybody else along so\nfor me when i started just having\nconversations with other people right\nstop being selfish i actually started\nlistening cause that's one thing social\nmedia did do it it woke a lot of people\nup because you know just our language\nlike you would say little things i\nremember one time i got on on twitter\nand i said something about females like\ni thought your females whatever whatever\nand it was just like\nall these comments you don't call women\nfemales and i'm like what the what the\n[ __ ] what since when don't we call women\nfemales but that's just you know\nnew language new information and instead\nof at first i dismissed it like i don't\nhear that but then after all i had to\njust stop and say okay well let me see\nwhy they don't want to be called\nfemale so they broke it down to me why\nthey don't want to be called females i\neven you know conversations with with\nblack women you know what i'm saying\nlike like we we tend to take for granted\nyou know black women you know like i\nnever i didn't i i told my uh i used to\nwork with this young lady named crystal\ni still had my tv show on common sense\nand she used to be on that i remember\nsaying her one day i really did not know\nblack women\nfelt the way they felt you know because\nmy whole life the strongest people\naround me was black women you know my\nmother my grandmother my aunts you know\nmy my girl who's now my wife so\ni just wasn't paying attention to what\nthey were\nsaying you know i just assumed that they\nwould always be there for us and i just\nassumed that they were strong enough to\nhandle any load but you know they was\ntired you know what i mean and they was\ntired of a lot of the [ __ ] [ __ ] that we\nwas doing so for me just those type of\nconversations started making me be just\nway more aware of\nwhat was going on around me and it\nstarted making me be more aware of what\nwas going on with myself and i remember\nhaving a conversation with my homegirl\namanda seals and i remember amanda\nsaying yo brothers are damaged\nthey don't want to admit that they're\ndamaged and they don't want to do the\nwork to get no healing and i remember\njust hearing that word healing and i\nremember saying to myself i'm gonna go\nget me some healing you know what i mean\ni'm gonna go get me some real\nspiritual\nemotional mental healing forget the gym\nthree or four times a week you know what\ni'm saying i'm about to start going to\nthe therapist every week and i'm about\nto start meditating and you know i'm\nabout to you know just just do whatever\ni got to do to really put myself in a\nmentally healthy space and then i wanted\nto get a handle on my anxiety\nso like you know\npanic attacks are something that i\nexperienced my whole life\nand the last\nreally well not the last really big\nreally bad one but the one i had that\nmade me realize i was dealing with\nanxiety was when i was back at home\nliving in monks corner south carolina\nwith my mother at like 31 32 years old\nmy daughter was like two\nmy now wife had to move back home to\nmom's corner with her parents\nand i just got fired for the fourth time\nfrom radio\nfinally started collecting unemployment\nbecause all the other times i was too\nproud to do it so i started collecting\nmy unemployment checks and i remember\ndriving down i-26 in south carolina and\nfeeling like i was about to die like\nsame feeling the same shortness of\nbreath same crazy heart palpitations had\nto pull over drink some water said a\nquick prayer like please god don't let\nme die on the side of the road like i\npromise i'll go to the doctor tomorrow\nwent to the doctor the next day doctor's\nlike yo you got a healthy heart your\nheart is fine you know but he said um he\nsaid have you have you ever have you\nsuffered do you suffer from anxiety and\ni'm like no\nhe's like sounds like you had an anxiety\nattack and i'm like i've never had that\nbefore but i thought about it i'm like\nyo my whole life i've had these things\nand then the doctor said\nuh\nare you stressed out about anything i'm\nlike hell yeah you know what i'm saying\nso in my mind i could always point to\nsomething else you know so i didn't deal\nwith it but then once you\nget my next gig with the breakfast club\nfour or five years later you richer than\nyou ever been you got more opportunities\nthan you ever had but you're still\nhaving the panic attacks you're still\nhaving anxiety and you're like okay\nwhere is this coming from and then\nfinally my wife was like yo\ntake your ass to therapy just go see\nwhat's up instead of flirting with the\nidea and talking to other people about\ntherapy go and that's what i did and\nthen you know when you start going to\ntherapy you start unpacking all kinds of\n[ __ ] yeah you start dealing with trauma\nfrom things that happened to you when\nyou were young things that you thought\nyou dealt with that you hadn't you know\nyou started focusing on your ptsd from\nthings that happened to you when you was\nyoung and then you start thinking about\nyou know the pain and the hurt that you\nstill feel from certain situations and\nyou don't realize you have been\nredistributing that pain to other people\nfor so long that's why you didn't have\nno empathy for nobody else because you\nreally was hurting you've been hurting\nso long that you numb\nto what it is you actually feel so yeah\nyou know i love that man and that's the\nchallenge right like all of us have been\nthrough stuff\nbut we've never unpacked it we've never\nrepacked we've never unlearned we've\nnever figured it out and that's why we\nend up in this position and the problem\nis denial we sit there and we deny that\nwe have any experience of stress or\npressure or anxiety when the truth is\nwe're dealing with a lot of it and i\nlove that i love the fact that you're\nmaking that point clear is that whatever\nyou're experiencing you're\ndestigmatizing mental health because we\nthink mental health has to be something\nsuper mental right like we think mental\nhealth has to be something like\nschizophrenia or like a completely a\ncomplete uh personality disorder or\nsomething we don't realize that it could\njust be regular anxiety yeah yeah i\ndidn't realize anxiety was a mental\nhealth disorder until i started going to\nthat yeah and i remember when they asked\nme to write you know\nmy second book but they didn't ask me to\nwrite one but they wanted me to write a\nsecond book and i was like i really\ndon't have anything to write about\nbecause at that point i was really just\ntrying to figure my life out because you\ngotta understand like when i started\ngoing to therapy i'm 49 i might have\nstarted going to therapy around 38 you\nknow early 39 and for me it was like\nyo can you imagine thinking you had it\nall together\nthinking you\nknew exactly what what was going on in\nthe world and then you start sitting\ndown with a therapist and realizing you\ndon't know [ __ ]\nrealizing that you know you you just\neverything that you you was raised\ntotally wrong from in a lot of different\nways you know he was raised wrong by\nyou know\nthe influences you had growing up you\nknow you was raised wrong by the music\nyou was listening to growing up you was\nraised wrong while your environment and\nyou've carried all of this stuff with\nyou into your adult world and you're\nstill trying to function with with this\nlevel of thinking and this level of\nunderstanding of things but\nyou've lived now like you've lived and\nyou've been around the world and you've\ntalked to a lot of people and you've\nseen other things and you realize like\nnah this ain't\njust saying it bro like we we we wrong\nso imagine feeling like you know it all\nto realizing i don't know [ __ ]\nespecially when you're an influencer\nyeah you're an opinion maker like people\ncome to you to listen to your thoughts\nso and then you have to go through that\nprocess absolutely so the only thing i\ncould do\nis like you know what i got to take\npeople on this journey with me\nsimple as that you know i remember i\nremember telling my book publishers like\nlook you know i've been going to therapy\ni've been keeping a journal\num you know i've been dealing with my\nanxiety but then i realized i'm dealing\nwith my ptsd i'm realizing i got trauma\nfrom things that happened to me when i\nwas younger i'm you know talking about\nbeing molested when i was eight you know\ni'm talking about issues with my father\nlike all these different things you know\nuh fear not being a good husband fearing\nnot being a good father you know fear of\nyou know not being a good friend\nyou know just all kind of different\nthings and so i just started turning\nthese into a pain in the pages of a book\nand what i was trying to do i was trying\nto translate what my therapist was\ntelling me but that doesn't work you\nknow because what your therapist is\ntelling you just helps for you to have a\nbetter understanding of what it is\nyou're going through so one thing that\nmy therapist did help me do was explain\nwhat i was going through better but i\nbought in a doctor named dr ish to give\nlike the clinical correlations to\neverything that i was feeling and that's\nthat's what was\nthat was really the most beautiful thing\nabout the book that was therapeutic for\nme i know people say that all the time\nwhen they write books oh it's\ntherapeutic for me but no this was\nreally therapeutic for me because this\nis not it's not a book about\nunderstanding\nlike it's not it's a book of confusion\nit's a book of unpacking it's a book of\nthis is all the [ __ ] that don't serve me\nno more this is this is what was [ __ ]\nup about me\nyou know and i don't want this no more\nlike here y'all take this this is gone\nyou know because i'm at stage zero right\nnow and guess what happy to be at stage\nzero\ndamn like it feels good to not know yeah\nyou know and it feels good to say you\ndon't know yeah and i feel like at 40\ni'm doing more unlearning than learning\nabsolutely man at this point\nyeah absolutely and that's that's the\nbiggest challenge today is like that\nability to speed up unlearning\nrelearning yes right relearning again\nand i think so many of us get blocked by\nthinking we know it all already so i\nlove that man it's great message let's\ntap into some of those fears in a bit\nmore detail because i think\nyour unlearning and your healing in\nthose are awesome so if we look at\nsomething like parental paranoia which i\nknow a lot of people have like becoming\na parent i'm not a parent and that's why\ni'm asking but i'm also asking it\nbecause\none area of wisdom that i don't talk\nabout is parenting because i'm not a\nparent and i know my audience cares a\nlot about this so let's talk about that\nparental paranoia which i think is very\nnormal how have you kind of grown to\ndeal with that and work with that or\nheal that you said something earlier you\nsaid something about you what'd you say\nyou realize you're a parent when you\nrealize your parents day you realize\nyour parents are right your kids are\ntelling you that you're wrong yeah\nand and i guess that was another one of\nthose moments you know um only because\nyou think about all the times your\ngrandmother used to trip out over you\nall the times your mother and father\nused to trip out over you uh wonder\nwhere you was at and why you didn't come\nhome i remember my father you know he\ngave my my sister older sister beaten\nbecause she broke curfew and i remember\neverybody running around the town\nlooking for her trying to find out where\nshe was and this night now it's just\nlike\nthat is only that's a paranoia that only\na parent can understand\nyou know what i'm saying like the love\nyou have for\nyour children like that those are risks\ni got three girls so those are that's\nreally your heart\noutside of your body like you're looking\nlike somebody just ripped my organ out\nand threw it on the table and i'm like\ncould you be more gentle with my heart\nmy heart so it's just like\nwhen my daughter is on the way to school\nin the morning you know her being at\nschool right now like i don't feel any\nsense of relief well i got a sense of\nrelief not gonna know three o'clock so\nshe's out of school now she got to\nschool 2 30. but i don't feel any sense\nof relief until i know she's home\nyou know only because i don't know what\nshe's going to experience at school\nespecially nowadays you know i mean like\nthese kids are growing up way different\nthan we ever grew up and then you\nsee stupid [ __ ] on the news like school\nshootings and you like man\nyou know like you start thinking the\nworst yeah at all times you know and\nit's just like\nthose are the things that i'm afraid of\nyou know and even just when your your\nkids get older i remember somebody\nasking me the question one day somebody\nsaid think jamel hill asked me this\njemele hill said are you uh\nwould you are you the are you the type\nof man you would want your daughter\nto date\nor be with\nand i was like yeah probably me from 35\nto 40.\nanything before that hell no yeah you\nknow\nbut but that's honestly think about it\nthink about that question like\nif you got girls are you the type of man\nthat you would want your\ndaughter to date like stuff like that is\nwhat will help you\ngo out there and get the healing you\nneed if the answer is no\nyou know what i'm saying if the answer\nis no then go out there and get that\nhealing you need take your asthma\ntherapy whatever it is you got to do\nto\nyou know be the man that you would want\nyeah your daughter to date so like i'm\ni'm paranoid about all that stuff like\ncertain things that i've already\nembraced like i know one day my\ndaughter's gonna have sex\nyou know what i'm saying like and then\nshe's gonna get it it's gonna happen\nlike every woman that we love in our\nlife\nhas sex your mama your grandma\nyou know your sisters that's going to\nhappen so it's just like\nthings like that i'm about to get a\npanic attack thinking about it but\nthat's just\nlike things like that is what you just\nhave to accept yeah you understand what\ni'm saying so it's just like\nyou know i always got to remember my\nserenity prayer man and that's just god\ngrant me serenity except the things i\ncannot change courage to change the\nthings i can't in the wisdom to know the\ndifference because there's nothing i can\ndo and that's somebody else told me that\ntoo and that was like one of the most\nfreeing things to me they told me that\nyou got to just let go yeah\nlike no matter how i can i can grab my\ndaughter like this and hold on to her\ntight i've been i gotta let go she's 10.\nmy other daughter's gonna be older in a\nminute too she's gonna be in school like\nthey got their own lives that they got\nto live their own lives that they gotta\nlead only thing i can do is just guide\nthem along the way absolutely man\nabsolutely no you're spot on and and i\nthink that's like you said that's a\nnatural feeling everyone's gonna have i\nalways had that with my younger sister\nso i've got a younger sister i always\nfelt like i fathered her to some degree\nand there was always that feeling in\nthat pain of seeing her date or whatever\nit may be and you're right that's just\nsomething you have to accept yes and\nthere's a big part of acceptance needed\nbecause you can't control everything and\nthat's also liberating when you figure\nthat out that not everything is for\nyours to control absolutely and it's not\nfor you to control there is certain\nthings to humanize yourself by and you\nrealize oh actually i'm not that\nsignificant because i can't control\neverything and i have to learn to accept\ncertain things yeah i was gonna write a\nbook i mean i don't think i'm gonna go\nwith this title anymore just because the\nenergy of it don't feel right but you\nknow at one point i was gonna write a\nbook called one day your daughter's\ngonna suck dick and other things you\nhave to accept as a father\nwell sure now what's he going to change\nthe title to i might not i just don't\nknow that that just feels a little too\ncrash you know what i'm saying like i i\nknow that sounds crazy coming from me\nbut i'm not i've\ni guess i've grown\nyou know what i'm saying i guess i've\ngrown because at one point i'm like yeah\nthat's the time i love that but then i\nwas like\ni think it'll be a useful book though\nvery useful\nyeah but sometimes man you know you got\nto present the message in the right\npackage you know sometimes yeah people\nwill dismiss you\nand and just because of that title you\nknow i mean which i think is whack i'm\nnot that kind of person you know i'm the\ntype person if i see a book like the\nsubtle artist not giving a [ __ ]\ni'm going to read that book you know\nwhat i mean i'm like oh that's a dope\nlike that grabbed me but i know i come\nfrom a different generation i come from\na different culture you know i was gonna\nname my first book i don't give a [ __ ]\nand neither should you a self-help guide\non how not to give a [ __ ] and the book\npublishers was like no you'll never get\ninto walmart you'll never get in the\ntarget nobody'll buy a book with [ __ ]\nthe title yeah and then here comes the\nart of not giving a [ __ ] mark manson\nsold goddamn over two million copies and\ni remember sending that [ __ ] to i wrote\nabout that book in my book cause i was\ntalking about how you know you sometimes\nyou just gotta\nlisten to yourself yeah you know like\nsometimes you're ahead of the curve and\nother people have to just catch up and\nthat's just the way our society is\nespecially when it comes to creatives\nthat's why you got to let creators just\nbe creative because they're already 10\nsteps ahead of you but you got all these\nsuits\nwhether it's tv whether it's the film\nworld whether it's\nbooks like you just got these suits that\nare old and stuck in their ways and\nbeing that they've they've never seen it\nwork before they'll tell you it can't\nwork yeah not knowing that you might be\nthe first that changes the whole game\ntotally nobody nobody wants to be game\nchangers in it yeah yeah absolutely you\nlook at bohemian rhapsody and freddie\nmercury yes it's like such a game\nchanger and you look at anyone that we\nlook up to or admire in the world\nthey've been game changers they don't\nwrite books about people who are not\ngame changers you don't make movies\nabout people they're not game changers\nbut we've always been taught about how\ndo you trust other people we don't get\ntaught how to trust yourself yes right\nwe get to how do you communicate with\nother people we never learn how to\ncommunicate with ourselves yes and so if\nyou never trust your own self you're\nalways looking for validation like hey\ndo you think this is a good idea hey sue\ndo you think this is a good idea hey do\nyou think this is a good idea and then\nthat suit becomes your validation and\nyour decision maker absolutely and those\nare the most uncreative people in the\nworld like i've never been more\nconfident in my life than i am right now\nand i'm confident in the fact that i\ndon't know [ __ ] yeah and i'm comfortable\nwith that you know and i'm confident in\nthe fact that\ni am\na person who truly loves this self and\nthe reason i truly love myself because\ni've done the work to truly love myself\nand\nit's easier for me and i guess that's\nwhy i get hurt a lot\nbecause i am a loving\ntrusting person because i'm at the point\nin my life where i just\ni try to see the good in everybody you\nknow what i mean and and i don't expect\nyou to\n[ __ ] me over that's another lesson i\ni've recently learned yeah go for it man\ni used to i still believe in the law of\nattraction meaning that your thoughts\nbecome things but um i don't necessarily\nthink i believe in\nenergy as far as like\nwhatever you put out you get back\nbecause it will always be somebody else\nout there who's having a [ __ ] up day\nwho will ruin yours because you gotta\nthink all we're trying to do every day\nis avoid\ncrazy yeah yeah we're just trying to\nstay out of the way of negativity crazy\nevil but guess what sometimes there's\npeople out there who are hurt and they\nhaven't done the work on themselves and\nthey haven't you know gotten to that\nplace where they're trying to do any\nhealing and so hurt people hurt people\nand sometimes we run into those people\nyeah and it has nothing to do with\nanything that we did we just happened to\nrun into you know some of that\nnegativity that day yeah so so that's\njust that's just something i've been\nthinking about so it's just like you\njust gotta you gotta do you gotta put\nthat kind of energy out there just\nbecause you like putting that kind of\nenergy out there not because you're\nputting that kind of energy out there\nbecause you wanna get it back to get it\nback yeah absolutely and i've realized\nactually that when you put out good it\ndoes come back to you just not in the\nsame place as you put it yes right like\nit will that energy will transfer back\nbut not in the same place as you put it\nso just because you put good energy into\nwork it doesn't mean good energy is\ngoing to come back to you through work\nif you scrape a good energy into this\nperson doesn't mean this person's going\nto give you good energy back and that's\nour expectation is that we think like if\ni'm nice to this person they'll be nice\nto me and that's not going to work like\nthat no be nice to that person because\nyou want to be nice to that person and\nput a period on yeah absolutely i love\nthat man i feel like one of the biggest\nmistakes we all make as humans is that\nwe keep communicating peop with people\nfrom where we are not where they are and\nso we forget that we were where they are\nright now and if we just talked to them\nrecognizing that that was us 10 years\nago 20 30 50 whatever it is that that\nwould make all the difference and now\nyou have a vocabulary for it we do we\nunderstand mental illness better we\nunderstand mental health we understand\nthese terms a bit better we're getting\nthere\nhow\nhow did when was it when you first\nstarted realizing that this was mental\nillness this was mental health this was\nuh their conditioning and challenges\nthat were on a deeper level as a per\njust\nmore than just their addiction\ni think just simply like i said by being\nable to make the uh connection or lack\nthereof between a friend of mine's\nparents and my parents like seeing your\nkind of normal person who can go and\nhold a job i think my mom only ever had\nlike two jobs i think she worked at a\nsupermarket for a little bit she worked\nat chick-fil-a and she could not stand\npeople telling her what to do and i\nrealized that and yet then she would\ntell me what to do and yet i had to just\nsuck it up and take it um\nand then even even with myself like i\nsaid me going through anxiety was like a\nbig eye opener and i remember my first\npanic attack i was like 13 years old\nand um it was really scary and my mom\nhad gone away\nwell i mean she just went to the store\nfor like an hour but i had this panic\nattack and\ni started to realize i was i was dealing\nwith like separation anxiety from my\nmother\nand that a lot of our relationship was\nmore uh based on brainwashing which\nsounds crazy but\nthe the\nhaving this feeling that i needed her\nand that if she wasn't there like my\nentire world would crumble and i didn't\nknow how to deal with anxiety um and\nhonestly i only really learned how to\ndeal with anxiety much later in life\nlike in my late 20s i'm 31 now and even\nright now jay like i'm i'm pretty\nanxious right now i don't know why it's\nreally weird\ni felt fine before i got on in front of\nthe camera and even right now like i\nhave this like\nfeeling of anxiety and maybe it's a\nnumber of things maybe it's uh\ni'm recounting my childhood i just i\nhave a book that's come out uh you know\nso many things that are going on in my\nmind i'm fine i know i'm fine i'm\ndrinking water i'm talking to an amazing\nhuman being i'm everything is okay and\nyet internally there is still is a part\nof me that\nfeels a little jittery and a little\nnervous and a little this and a little\nthat and um\ni've learned how to deal with that and\ninstead of like freaking out\ni just go you're fine it's okay\nfeeling this way is normal\num i i remember speaking with my\ntherapist and she told me um i was like\ni hate the fact that i feel anxious i\nwas like there's people out there that\ndon't really you know they just have\nkind of general anxiety but they don't\nhave that anxiety where it can also\naffect them physically where they feel\nweird or\nthey feel like they could pass out or\nthis or did that and she was like yeah\nand then sometimes it happens to them\nlike tony soprano when they're in their\n50s trying to feed the ducks and you\nknow in their pool and then that's just\ntheir life after that and she said the\nthing is is not\nlike you you have to accept that that's\njust who you are and that's the way your\nlife is now and do the best that you can\nto combat and deal with that anxiety and\nthose emotions in the most positive\nmanner possible so it wasn't until i\nstarted truly understanding what anxiety\nmeant and how much it can affect your\nday-to-day personal and professional\nlife\nthat i i even grew more sympathetic\ntowards my mother and all the things\nthat she was dealing with yeah well i\nwant to thank you for sharing that and\nalso just to say that i do think it's\nnatural and extremely brave when you're\nsharing such personal accounts of things\nin your life and you're putting them out\nthere and\nwe we know the world we live in where\neverything we say is\nyou know it's natural for you to feel\nthat way so i i really appreciate you\neven opening up and sharing that and i\njust want you to know that i think\nyou're sharing your story not just on\nthis interview but in this book\nin a way that is going to help so many\npeople with their perspective so i want\nyou to know that and i also want you to\nknow that\nwe yeah we all have anxiety i i\nofficiated someone's wedding this\nweekend the wedding that the weekend\nthat just went and my wife said it to me\nshe was like yeah i've never seen you\nthis anxious or stressed in your life\nwith anything you do and i was like\nbecause it's someone's wedding day i was\nlike yeah and people were like oh but\nyou've done this a million times and you\ndon't and i was like\nit doesn't matter how many times i've\ndone it it's someone different and it's\ntheir wedding day\nand this is an important moment for\nsomeone and what i've realized and i\nlove what you said there because i do\nsomething similar i've redefined my\nrelationship with anxiety that i feel\nanxious when i care\nso i know that when i'm feeling anxious\nit's because it's something good about\nme is that i care i'm a human that loves\nand cares and is compassionate and wants\nto serve these two beautiful people that\ni wedded that i love and that love me\nand i have a relationship with it's\nbecause of that i'm not scared about\nwhat someone thinks about it or how it\ngoes i'm i'm anxious because i care\nabout these two people and i feel they\ndeserve something special it's funny you\nsay that because another thing that i\nhad dealt with for i mean everybody\ndeals with it is intrusive thoughts\nyou're aware of this right intrusive\nthoughts so it could be the craziest\nthing it could be\nyour baby falling to its death it could\nbe you i don't know punch in a store\nclerk and you're just like oh my god why\nwould i think that how could i think\nsomething so despicable or whatever the\ncase may be these dark thoughts um and i\nremember talking to my therapist and she\nwas like well one those aren't really\nyour thoughts you're not thinking that\nshe was like that's kind of douche bag\nbrain she put it she was like it's just\nthese thoughts that pop into your head\nand you need to understand that that's\nthat's also um like conscious like your\nyour conscious\nrecognizes that and is then terrified\nand uh so i think when it comes to\nanxiety and the things you care about\nit's like oh my god if i think about my\nbaby dying it's because that's the most\nprecious thing to me if i think about i\ndon't know like i said punching some\nclerk in the face it's like violence i\nhate violence so it's these things that\nmy brain is doing that that i'm kind of\nthen freaking out about but it's about\nhow we deal with that if we then uh\nfocus on it too much and obsess why\nwould i think that why would i think\nthat why would i think that then every\ntime\nwe're in a situation where that thought\nis then triggered then it just becomes\nmore intense and the real the key there\nis to not really\nfocus on it is to really not think about\nit understand that it's a thought it's a\ndisgusting thought that you didn't even\nthink in your head it just somehow\npopped in and you were like oh my\ngoodness you know to hell with you and\nthat's also how i feel about anxiety i\nthink there's a difference between\nlegitimately like oh i'm starting to see\nstars or i feel like i i need to sit\ndown like that could be different even\nthough it may be anxiety but it's like\nask yourself have you been working\nreally hard have you drank enough water\ntoday have you eaten have you this have\nyou that and having the the mind\nthe mindset to be able to just\nask yourself what is going on and that\nwas something i couldn't do for a long\ntime i was very unhealthy both\nphysically and mentally um and once i\nreally learned how to utilize these\ntools\nuh my life became better but i mean i\nstill get anxiety like it sucks yeah\nbut it also is great i mean i'm not\ngonna say anxiety is great anxiety just\nsucks but but\nit's\nlook at this great conversation we're\nhaving because of it i've made songs\nabout it i've written parts in scripts\nabout it i've like i get it and i\nunderstand it and because of that it's\nactually allowed me to connect with\npeople um on such a deeper level and\nbeing willing to go because i'll tell\nyou this man i love rap i love hip-hop\nit's a beautiful place it's also a\nnegative place just like the world is\nand but i've met a lot of rappers where\ni try to have like deeper conversations\nwith them and they just don't do it\nbecause i think they're all so scared\nand\nto internalize how they're feeling but i\ndid have one guy and he i'll never\nforget he was like bro i wish i could be\nyou and i was like what do you mean i'm\nlike the nerd rapper who solves rubik's\ncubes and raps about sci-fi you're like\nyou're that dude you know you got the\ncred even though low-key i've shot guns\nand cook cracks so i guess i have the\ncredit as well but i don't really\nperpetuate that life and he was like\nlook man\nhe was like i'm scared he was like that\nwas so long ago that's not who i am\nanymore he's like i like video games i\nlike this i like that i wish i could\njust be myself and when he said that to\nme i realized that all the years and\ntime that times that i'd been made fun\nof in hip-hop or this or that well at\nthe end of the day i may have been made\nfun of by a certain sect or\nquote-unquote cool group or the jocks of\nrap but at least i was always myself and\nnever had to pretend to be somebody i\nwas not and then that led to you know\njust saying i'd rather be hated for who\ni am than love for who i'm not which i\nthink like kurt cobain or somebody said\nyeah\nbut yeah there it is yeah no that's a\nbeautiful message man i think that's\nsomething everyone can relate to and\nwhat you were speaking about there about\nthe douchebag brain\nuh in in in the monastery we used to\ncall it the monkey mind and the monk\nmind so you have the monkey mind that's\nyou know saying all these intrusive\nthoughts as you said saying all these\nself-doubt anxiety and then you have the\nmonk mind which is the the calm distill\nthe balance and to bring that monkey\nmind back under control and so\nyeah for me that was always uh that was\nalways a fun way of thinking about it\nit's just like i've just got this monkey\nthat's jumping from branch to branch in\nmy head and you know it doesn't know\nwhat it wants and it's confused and it's\nmoving fast but the monk mine can kind\nof ground it so that that aligns very\nstrongly i've alwa i always saw this guy\nwho looks like i want you to imagine\nlike a cartoon\nthere's this episode of futurama it's\none of my favorite cartoons but um\ni forget the episode but there's like\nthis liquid guy and he's like blue and\nhe looks like just kind of moving water\nand his head's all back and he looks\nkind of cool i imagine that guy\nin a in a leather jacket sitting on a uh\num\nlike a a beach chair in my brain\nand he's responsible for these thoughts\nhe's like you said the monkey mind it's\nlike this monkey but it's like that's\nhow i see this guy\nand i've actually had conversations with\nthis guy like get out of here dude like\nlike it's like chill like stop and then\nhe'll say something to me that i hear\nand it almost sounds like i'm crazy\nright because it's like i'm having a\nconversation with myself in my head but\ni have had this and i'm like no like not\ntoday man and sometimes he really he'll\nhe'll hit me with some crazy images or\nme freaking out or going to the\nemergency room or just all these things\nbecause i'm always constantly thinking\nabout my health and\ni have to have those conversations and\ntell the water blob or monkey man or\nwhatever to calm down\nand and do my best to be in control\nwhich is actually really funny\nbecause i'm not in control we're not\nreally in control and i think accepting\nthe fact that you're not in control in\nsome weird way gives you a bit of\ncontrol at the same time but yeah yeah\nyeah it definitely gives you more\ncontrol over what you can control if\nthere's any of that that you can do so\nno i like that and i love the futurama\nreference all for futurama references\nwell that patience love and compassion\ndoesn't just come from anywhere it\ndefinitely comes from a practice of\nmeditating\nhaving grace and some people just aren't\nready and that's okay and um\nmeditation helps me a lot to have grace\nand compassion for those people because\nwhen i\ndo sit down to meditate and i'm in a\nplace where i'm angry\ni sit and i think and i and i\nyou know i try to clear my mind but if i\ncan't i\ni think through it and\ni end up coming to a point where i just\ni release the anger and\nmaybe it was because\ni know i'm a leo and leo's can be\nvery stubborn that like i work so hard\nnot to be stubborn\nand so i try to to have grace because it\nis so easy for me to hold a grudge\nagainst people i can hold a grudge and\nand never speak to someone again and\nthat's not a trait that i'm proud of\nbecause\ni've realized\nthat that's not a very human\nthing to do\nbeing human is having compassion and and\nunderstanding and respect for people\neven when they mess up and\num\nbecause we all do we all mess up and\ni've i've messed up a bunch but\ni know that because i've messed up i can\nhave grace and mercy for other people\nwhen they mess up i love that i cannot\ntell you how beautiful that is to hear\nand i can't wait for everyone to hear\nthat i think it's such a\ntrue true true statement that the\nmistakes we've all made which we all\nmake i've made loads of mistakes and you\nwere saying you have to\nall those mistakes that uh they ground\nus they humble us they they remind us of\nhow we're all\nuh no one is immune to making a mistake\nand anyone at any time can make a\nmistake knowingly or unknowingly\nand actually i'm going to play that part\nspecifically to my wife because my wife\nis a leo and she is so stubborn\nand she knows it yes and so what you\njust said to me i did not know that\ntrait that i didn't know that was a leo\ntrait so i'm gonna play that exact part\nto my wife and be like look what dem is\nsaying it's about the only thing i know\nabout my astrology sign but\nyeah i did not know that at all so now i\ni i am feeling that i can be more\ncompassionate towards my wife when she\nwhen she is stubborn uh because yeah\nbecause it's part of part of the traits\nuh\ntell me a bit about\nyou know\nwhat do you think when when you're one\nof the things that you did this year and\nthis was actually when i\nwhen i first watched your documentary\ndancing with the devil\nuh i was\ncompletely blown away like it was it was\nincredible\nuh it was it was incredible it's just i\ncouldn't believe where you took us and\nwhere you were allowed us in\nand\nand i i know you said in this episode in\nthis podcast you just said that\nyou know you shared your story\nand then you realized the perspective\nthat it was so much bigger than your\nstory which by the way is\nagain such a wonderful perspective\nat the same time\nyou've been through so much that\nwhen you share it helps so many you\ntalked about so many you talked about an\nexperience with rape you talked about\nexperiences with\nyou know sexual abuse and assault and\nwhen i hear about those things and i\nstill see you coming and rising like a\nphoenix you know from from all these\nlike\nchallenges and and pain i wonder\nwhere is your strength coming from today\nlike where do you look to for strength\nyou said meditation there and i'd love\nfor you to guide us through your\nmeditation practice is there anything\nelse that's giving you strength what's\ngiving me strength i mean there's\nstrength all around me\nand that's my support system whether\nthat's my friends or my treatment team\nor it's\nmy friends my family\nyou know it's it's people around me\ni always have support and i never feel\nalone which is beautiful um\nbut yeah i think some of my my\nmeditations i i listen to guided\nmeditations\num but i also\ni like to tone my chakras\nand so i do like a sound bath and\num\nand yeah those are like\nthe great thing about meditation for me\nis that i thought that you had to be\ncompletely silent still with your eyes\nclosed and your hands like this and\nyou know there's different types of\nmeditation there's different as long as\nyou are\nquieting your thoughts and trying to\njust\nchill\nthen like then then it's good then like\nyou can meditate with your eyes open you\ncan meditate while you're doing things\nit's just\npeople don't realize how how easy it is\nand you don't have to be perfect at it\nand that was what\nkept me away from meditating for so long\nwas trying to be perfect at it yeah\nthank you thank you for simplifying it\nfor everyone i i couldn't agree more i\nwhen i when i learned how to meditate\nwhen i was 18 i was introduced to three\npractices breath work\nvisualization and mantra and sound\nand it was so refreshing to realize that\nthere was breath work for the body there\nwas visualization for the mind there was\nmantra for the soul and the spirit and\nthe energy\nand to me i was like wow there's there's\na menu for meditation and yeah and you\ncould you could try which one worked for\nyou and you could build it and as you\nsaid\nthere is no perfect meditator\nand the practice of trying to be perfect\nis almost as far away from meditation as\nas there can be so i i love that you're\nsimplifying it for so many people and\nand making it natural what's what's been\none of your favorite meditation\nexperiences have you had any that have\nreally\nmaybe maybe you've gained a message or\nan insight or you've just been able to\nbe really calm has there been an\nexperience that you could share with us\nthere's been so many experiences that i\ncould share with you i mean\nit's\nhaving a realization about things that\nyou thought you would never figure out\nin your lifetime\num relationships that you thought were\ncompletely over and then all of a sudden\nthey pop into your mind during\nmeditation and you feel the need to\nreach out to them so you do\nand all of a sudden you've rekindled a\nrelationship or you've repaired a\nrelationship that that stubbornness i\nthought i was holding on to\num\nyou know for for good\nit's when i was able to release that\nstubbornness and so\nsometimes i feel like my intuition is\nwhen i meditate it just like raises its\nhand and is like hey\nyou know like listen listen to me here's\na song idea here's a reach out to this\nperson or\nor even sometimes weird things happen\nwhere\ni don't reach out to that person but\nthey reach out to me\nyou know and and it's interesting how\nyour intuition starts to work when you\nreally start to listen to it\nyes yes and that is such a good point\nmost of us whenever we talk about the\nword intuition a lot of people say well\njay i don't hear any voices and the\ntruth is we don't hear voices because\nwe've been ignoring it for so long\nand you're right that as soon as you\nstart to listen to it it gets louder it\ngets stronger it gets more powerful\nthat's that's such a great point that as\nsoon as you start listening even if it's\nthe tiniest bit of intuition\nif you start listening to it that voice\ngets so much more stronger and powerful\nand i you're so right demi that in that\nmeditation\nyou're giving space for that voice\nyes you are you you're giving you're\nputting that voice in an amphitheater\nyou know what i mean you're giving that\nvoice\na huge platform to to\nreach out and say hey this is what's on\nmy mind\nyour voice sounds very cute though\nsaying hey with it with a little hand\nthat sounds like an adult that sounds\nlike an adorable voice it seems like an\nemoji with a voice\nwhereas yeah whereas whereas you know\nsomeone else might be like i don't like\nthe voice in my head\nbut that's the noise that's the noise\nthe voice in our head should feel like a\nsmiley face emoji that's like please\nlisten to me please yeah yeah please\ni hope anyone who's listening to this\nright now if you're not watching you\nhave to go back and look at the video of\nof demi\ndoing hey because it's adorable and and\nyou have you have to see it because now\nevery time i hear my voice my intuition\ni'm going to see that little yeah\ni love that i love that you're laughing\ntoo because one of the things that's\nalways been important to me is that\nmeditation and mindfulness and\nconsciousness it can be fun and it can\nbe playful yes and it doesn't have to be\nthis\nreally like\nit's disciplined but it's it's not this\nartificial hardcore\nyou know rough and like it can it can be\nplayful and fun i could you share a bit\nabout that because i see you as such a\nfun-loving person and even now we're\nboth laughing about\nvoices in our head\nbut\nbut tell me a bit about that have you\nhave you allowed your playfulness to\ncome through more and and your energy\nyes i quieted\nmy\nintense meditation personal trainer\nvoice\nthat was in my head you know like when\nyou go to the gym and\nand you have a personal trainer or\nsomebody that's like really pushing you\nand\nthat just doesn't work for me and that\nis the voice that i had in my head every\ntime i went to meditate it was\nstop opening your eyes stop thinking\nabout this stop thinking about that and\nit was just like to the point where\nthree minutes would go by and it'd be\nlike i'm already over this\nyou know what i'm saying and so i had to\nreally quiet that voice down\nand\nwhen i started meditating especially\noutside you know there's gonna be noises\nthere's gonna be animals things like\nthat planes that fly over\nand if i felt myself wanting to open my\neyes i just allowed myself to because i\nthought what are you going to gain\nfrom opening your eyes and just taking a\nsecond to appreciate the sound that\nyou're hearing and sometimes i had\nreally beautiful insights sometimes i\nwas like wow it's a big plane but like\nother times i had beautiful moments\nwhere\ni thought one time for instance um\ni was outside and there were all these\nbugs and i was trying to meditate and i\nthought to myself\nwhat do i do about the bugs right like\nwhat can i do because i'm just shooing\nthem away and then i had this moment\nwhere i thought\nnobody was shooing bugs away at\nwoodstock when they were perfectly like\ncontent and having the best time and\nlike in the wilderness basically\nthey were hippies that like\nthey learned to share\nand coexist with the bugs that were\nthere and i was like wow these little\ntiny organisms are flying around me\nthey're maybe just trying to say hello\nthey're just or or they're just living\ntheir lives but like in my head\nthey're trying to say hi and that makes\nit more\nappealing and fun for me and so i open\nmy eyes and i just like let\nthe bugs just kind of fly around me and\nif it was a b\nit's a b if it stings you it stings i\nmean i'm not allergic so but\nyou know for other people it might be\ndifferent but it's just about like\nshrinking that judgmental voice that's\nsaying\nkeep your eyes closed\ndon't focus on anything you know it's\nabout quieting that voice and really\njust like learning to appreciate okay\nwhy do i want to open my eyes what is it\nthat i can gain from this\nexperience of opening my eyes and\nlooking at this little bug or\nor\nsometimes i'll open my eyes and i'll see\na hummingbird and hummingbirds to me\nsignify\nlike my ancestors and\num and so i i think oh maybe that's\ntheir way of saying hello to me today\nand i wouldn't have seen that had i not\nopened my eyes\nthat was an amazing description\nbecause you you just you just described\nhow\nmeditation's really a conversation not a\ncommand\nit's not a command you're not commanding\nyourself\nto do this or do that it's it's not like\nyou have a drill sergeant in your head\nyou actually want to have a conversation\nand a dialogue to yes understand and\nuncover yourself and i i always think\nabout that that the simplest form of\nmeditation is having a conversation with\nyourself having time\nto meet yourself\nand we always we would never cancel an\nimportant meeting with someone else but\nwe never even schedule one with\nourselves exactly and i always\ni always used to\num\nover analyze things and i always used to\ntell myself that was a negative trait\nthat i had then i'm always overthinking\nthings but then when i started\nmeditating i\ni started to\nhave those over analyzation\nconversations in my head and then i\nstarted thinking wow\ni could go somewhere with this you know\nlike i could expand\nthese thoughts and and it kind of gave\nthis like\nit turned my brain into like a kitchen\nfor all of\nthe\num\nthe like\nthought dinners and and food for\nthoughts that i wanted to have you know\nand i just started expanding and now the\nway that i think is just completely\ndifferent and that's cool too\nyeah no that the way you've just\nexplained how we\nhave to silence even that\nyou know that trainer voice as you said\nlike a personal trainer in the gym or\nit's so true it's so true because\notherwise you just become subservient to\nthis other voice\nagain your expansive consciousness is\nbeing contained and limited yes by this\nother yes and you don't get to\nexperience it anymore so i can agree\nwith you more you've you've you've\nhelped me massively\nrefine that and uh we as monks we would\nalways talk about how\nyou always saw the\nyou always saw the noise in your head\njust like a little monkey running around\nand and that kind of made it playful and\nso it was always the it was always the\nmonkey mind versus the monk mind and so\nthe monkey was always playful and you\nnotice it\nand you don't want to trap the monkey or\nhurt it or anything you just are\nentertained by just how silly it can be\nbut you want to\nhelp organize it a little and help it a\nlittle bit but you don't you don't need\nto hurt it\nand so yes\ni i you've really helped me uh i i think\nmy meditation is going to be different\ntomorrow based on what you just said so\nwow that's the best compliment i mean it\ni really mean it i really do i think\nyeah i i think you're so right i think\nyou're so right we get we get lost\nalways in these\nwe are always lost in just judging\nourselves just somehow we get\neven even when we know we judge\nourselves we now judge ourselves for\njudging ourselves\nit's like we find\nhave you ever experienced that oh my god\nevery day\nno not every day but you know it it is\nsomething where\ni do have to catch myself sometimes\ndaily where i look sometimes i look in\nthe mirror and i and i find something\nimmediately wrong with what i see\nand\ni have to stop and say okay why did you\nwhy did you go there with it why can't\nyou look at how beautiful\nyour\nhair is today or\nwhatever or why don't you\nthink about a quality\nabout yourself that has nothing to do\nwith your appearance\nand then like\ntell yourself how proud you are for\ngaining that quality\nand it's like\nit's just always kind of reminding\nourselves\nevery day and that way it gets easier\nover time so that i'm not looking and\nsometimes it's harder than others\nsometimes sometimes it's just easier to\ngo in that shame spiral you know the\nshame spiral where\nyou get onto yourself for one thing and\nthen all of a sudden that oh well\nbecause\ni don't like my hair that means\nthat my body is wrong or because i'm\nnot liking my body you know now i i feel\nunlovable and\nand it just goes into that that spiral\nand\nthe quicker you can stop that spiral\nfrom\nbottoming out\nthe quicker that you get with\nthat moment every day where it's like\nnow i look in the mirror and if i see\nsomething i don't like i'm it's like a\nreflex i just go okay what do we like\nyou know and so\num you just gotta\nyou gotta start to\nin a loving and compassionate way train\nyour mind\nto remind yourself what you do love\nabout yourself so powerful i really hope\neveryone tomorrow morning is going to\npractice what demi just said when you\nlook in the mirror tomorrow morning i\nwant you to remember\nwhat demi just said because\nit's such a\nincredible trait that we all have where\nwe draw these huge conclusions based on\none tiny thing\nso like you said we draw this conclusion\ni am unlovable\nbased on\none thing we don't like about ourselves\nor it could be as simple as your hair\nit could be as tiny yeah it can be as\ntiny as a\nuh a spot on your face right and and you\nturn that spot into\ni am never\ngoing to feel attractive and you just\namplify it to these great degrees and we\nall do it\nand and i love what you said that that's\nhow to approach it that when we look in\nthe mirror you have to you have to nip\nit in the butt you have to catch it\nthere and\nthen and there because otherwise it just\ngets i was thinking about i was talking\nto someone about this the other day\nthere was a small crack in one of the\nfloors\nin in our home\nand i was saying i want to get it fixed\ntoday and someone was saying to me they\nsaid no no it doesn't matter like it's\nit's going to be like years before\nthat's an issue\nand i was like that's my point i was\nlike i don't want the crack\nto get an opportunity to get bigger and\nbigger and bigger i would rather mend it\ntoday\nand i don't think that just applies to\nflaws i think it applies to our lives\nand how we feel about ourselves and how\nwe talk to ourselves it applies to\nrelationships you may think you just had\na tiny argument but if you can solve it\nnow\nyou save yourself years of headaches so\ni love that you gave everyone a\npractical tool to to actually do that or\nanother one is\nif you might you might think that what\nyou have to say is not super important\nbut honor that voice inside of you so\nthat when you are in a relationship\nyou're immediately starting out with\nthis is who i am these are my values and\nthis is how i want to be respected\nand\nthat way you like you said you nip it in\nthe bud sometimes it's it's not about\nsometimes it's just about speaking up\ntoo\nyes yes you're right and and that all\ncomes back to what you were saying\nearlier the confidence of your intuition\nif you if you keep ignoring it and you\nsay oh well that's that's not important\nright now well that's not relevant or\nthat's insignificant if you keep talking\nto yourself in that way\nthat voice just gets\nquieter and quieter and quieter and now\nwhen you really need it\nyou can't hear it anymore yes exactly so\ni i think that's a beautiful full circle\ngo back to what you were saying earlier\ndemi i you know we we've talked a lot\nabout and i love that we're talking a\nlot about expanding consciousness\nbecause\ni i think that that's not just a noble\naspiration i do believe it's it's a root\nthing it's like going to the heart of\nthe issue as you said that\nif we don't expand our consciousness and\nas a whole as as a world\nit's\nwe can try and solve this one area this\none area but but we're going to keep\nkind of bashing heads to some degree\ni i wonder what are some of the ways you\nthink that people can expand their own\nconsciousness if they're listening and\nsaying i i want to know how to do that\ni'm open to that\nwhere would they start what are some of\nthe things what are some of the books i\nknow that you've been interviewing some\nphenomenal people on your podcast 4d\nwhich you're encouraging people to live\nthrough this fourth dimension i i wonder\nhave you had any conversations or people\nthat you'd love to introduce people to i\ninterviewed someone recently on my\npodcast named justin baldoni and\num\nthat conversation with them really\nopened my mind because\nuh\njust what they had to say in relation to\num\ngender norms that are placed on us\nat a young age how we evolve as\nuh adults and\nhow we tend to carry those things from\nour childhood into our adult lives today\ni thought that was so interesting and\nyou know he has a book called man enough\num a lot of the people that i'm having\nconversations with you know you have a\ngreat book\nand um i think reading is something that\nhas helped expand my consciousness a lot\ntoo\num and it doesn't even have to be about\nanything\num\nall that intense it can just be just\nreading is good for your mind um\njournaling is something that's really\nhelped me because\nsometimes my thoughts race so fast that\num\nthat it's hard to\ni don't know it's good to just get it\nout and then i can go back to it and\nlook at it later\num\nso yeah reading journaling and and like\ni said meditating meditating is really\nimportant but find out what meditation\nworks for you\nbecause it is different for everybody\nyeah those are great great insights\nreading\njournaling of course meditation as you\nsaid before and we talked about at\nlength\nuh i can agree with you more i remember\ni was just speaking to a friend i was i\nwas reorganizing my bookshelf\nand he was saying how much have you been\nreading recently and i said i remember a\nyear in my life where i read a book a\nday for a year and and it just you know\nit was it was an incredible year\nand i was just saying to him how much i\nmiss it that was around\ni think that was around four or five\nyears ago i did that\nand i've been i've been reading i've\nbeen trying to read about book a month\nat the moment but i've been really\ntrying to find things that i'm\nfascinated by and it's not about i'm not\ntrying to make it about a numbers game\ni'm not saying that so anyone who's\nlistening or watching this isn't a\ncompetition of how many books you read\nand that's not what i'm emphasizing what\ni'm emphasizing is what demi's saying is\njust to really expand your consciousness\nyou need to let your consciousness\nconnect dots\nin lots of different areas and so when i\nread i don't just try and read from one\ngenre i try and read from lots of\ndifferent genres and lots of different\nauthors and backgrounds because then my\nconsciousness has the ability to connect\ndots that it finds interesting\nthank you so much for watching that\nvideo if you enjoyed it here's another\none i think you'll love it didn't come\nfrom the wardrobe or the facelift the\nsports car whatever it came from within\nyou and so you stopped looking out there\nfor"
