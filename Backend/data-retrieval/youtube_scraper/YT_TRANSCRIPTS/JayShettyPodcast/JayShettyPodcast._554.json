like wow this is amazing\nabsolutely the handkerchief like choice\nwhere it's placed yeah anyway please\nknow why steam the napkins before you\nget served so this is all it's all or\nnothing it's all or nothing but i love\nit because we're talking about your book\ntoday yes be a triangle which is so\nexciting because your first book came\nout i think now five years ago yeah\nwhich is incredible what is time i know\nand the fact that you focused on\nbuilding and writing this amazing book\nwhich you thankfully sent to me i got to\nread it ahead of time i've read some of\nmy favorite chapters today we get to\ndive in and like i said everyone who's\nwatching or listening back at home makes\nyou go and order this book not only is\nlily one of my favorite people in the\nworld she bears a soul in this book\nmakes it super accessible and relevant\nand it's highly practical and has the\ncutest images in it as well but but\nlet's dive in when i first heard you\nannounced the title\ni was just fascinated i was so intrigued\ni was like be a triangle i was like what\ndoes that mean like i was only ever\ncalled square growing up\nright or or other words and i was like\nwhat does it mean to be a triangle let's\nstart there yes i was also called square\nand then during covet i turned into a\ncircle and now i've decided that\nmy shape is triangle you know it's\ninteresting you bring this up because\nand i'll tell you explain the title in a\nsecond but i actually had to fight for\nthis title because when i had sent the\nemail to my team being like i know this\nis\nnot\nimmediately understandable but no other\ntitle will suffice has to be a triangle\nand the response i got was\nit's kind of confusing and i was like no\ni stuck to my guns and i'm so happy i\ndid because it is what the book is about\nyou know the book is about\nme really coming to terms with the fact\nthat although i've done a lot of cool\nthings in my life you know you rattled\noff a few in the intro and although i'm\non my fourth vision board\ni think during covid i really had a\nmoment when everything went away and i\nhad no events and i had nothing\nit's not that i was like oh i'm a\nworkaholic and now i'm bored it was\ndeeper than that it was that\noh i don't think i have any\nvalue right now like i\ncan't measure myself in any way because\ni don't have events and i don't have\nwork and\nso i'm just kind of floating in space\nunsure of what to do or how to think of\nmyself rather think of life right now\nand i realized that's because\nwork was the only thing i associated\nvalue with you know i never really\nthought about well what kind of person\ndo you want to be and if you accomplish\nall things on your vision board how\nshould that make you feel and how come\nyou don't feel that way right now\nand so\ni got to thinking and the root of it was\nthat i never had a solid foundation of\njust what my belief system is you know\nwhat do i want my values to be where do\ni want to be not just professionally but\nspiritually mentally\nwhat do i really care about and what's\nimportant and that's all about building\nfoundation now one of the strongest\nstructural shapes on the planet is a\ntriangle\nand so i thought i need to be a triangle\ni need to bring build a strong\nfoundation for myself so that all of my\nlife experiences and everything from\nthis moment on i can put on top of this\nstrong foundation\nthat is perfect and i love that you\nstuck to your guns i know if i were like\nwhat are you talking about and i was\nlike be a triangle it's gotta it's gotta\nbe this so i i went through a similar\nthing that when i wrote the title think\nlike a monk and that was always the\ntitle that i wanted for my first title\nand\n14 out of 17 imprints that heard that\ntitle said that i should change it\nreally because they didn't want me to\nhave that as the title that's a great\ntitle but they said they said to me they\nsaid well who wants to think like a monk\npeople don't even know what monks are\nthey don't know what they do and i was\nlike but it's so true to\nwhat i'm trying to share with the world\nis like this is the line of wisdom that\ni learned from and it sounds like you're\nsaying the same thing it's like this is\nwhat i'm actually asking people to do i\ndon't need to come up with a catchy\ngimmicky title correct just to sell a\nbook i completely agree because i think\nso much of my life i'll be real i made\nthousands and thousands of youtube\nvideos we do stuff on social media you\nneed to be a little clicky and buzzy and\ngrab people's attention for this though\nsuch a vulnerable raw piece of work i\nwas like i don't want to do that if this\nis the title that i think feels right\nand it's what i actually want to\ncommunicate this is what it's going to\nbe yeah i love that you brought about\nhow we value ourselves and i want to\nstart there\nand you talk a lot about in the book\nwhat we learned at school what we didn't\nlearn at school where do you think we\nlearned to ascribe our value to anything\nin life like you said you saw work as\nyour value\nwhat are some of those other values that\npeople ascribe to and where do you think\nwe develop them i mean i think there's a\nfew ways and i can only speak to me\ndissecting my own life i think for me a\nlot of it is definitely cultural i mean\nyou can probably relate to this as both\nbeing south asian\nis that my family and my community they\nreally do value a degree we live in a\ntime right now where and i'm not trying\nto bash school but i don't know a single\nperson using their degree right now but\ndoesn't matter to my parents a degree is\nthe save all end end-all you need the\ndegree or else you are not educated you\nknow you have to establish a family you\nhave to get married you have to have\nkids because you have to keep the family\nname going you have to contribute back\nto the world through kids because they\nare not used to another way of\ncontributing to the world their\nunderstanding is that you contribute to\nthe world through having kids and making\nthe world progress see i for a long time\nand this is where i get really realized\nfor a long time i think i had a bit of a\nchip on my shoulder when i thought of my\nparents and i thought of my culture\nbecause i thought\nyou guys only have one way of doing\nthings like i do things different i'm\nfrom a different time and place\nbut that was really unfair of me because\ni never took the time to understand well\nwhy are my parents actually like this\nyou know is it just that they're older\nis it just that they were born in india\nso through the work of my therapist and\nhonestly through writing this book i was\nlike you know it's actually a lot to do\nwith generational trauma it's about my\nparents were born in punjab india\nthey\ndidn't have\nthe luxury of being like today i'm gonna\ncare about my mental health today i'm\ngonna contribute to the world by making\na youtube video and motivating people\nthey were like hey we're in a country\nwith a billion people there's limited\nresources we need to problem solve every\nday we need to survive every day the\nthings that matter are family sticking\ntogether survival education getting a\njob money food on the table\nand now i've taken the tools that they\nhave taught me and i'm trying to use\nthem in a time and place that is not\nthat time and place yeah so that's where\ni think it comes from and i talk about\nin the book that\nin school when you look back you're\nmeasured by grades and in work you're\nmeasured by promotions and salaries and\nthat's how you measure growth and\nsuccess but\nas a kid it was never like hey lily\ntoday\nyou were really patient and that marks\ngrowth like that didn't matter it didn't\nmatter if you grew mentally or\nspiritually it was always measured by\nsomething else yeah i love that what\nwhat a beautiful switch of mindset\nbecause\nthat is something that you can measure\nevery day you can measure every day if\nyou feel more patient or you feel more\nkind or you feel more supportive or\nsupported but you can't measure a view\ncount or an award every day like that's\nlike one percent i mean you've won so\nmany awards in your career and you look\nat that and you go that was like one\npercent of the experience that was like\nthe top of the pyramid but it's the\ntiniest part or tiniest part of the\ntriangle yeah right it's like the tip of\nthe door\nit's the tip of the triangle where\nyou're like that was just the tip but\nthe whole journey to get there was where\nall the hard work was absolutely and i\nthink one of the reasons i was so\nresilient to the things i write about in\nthis book because literally when i write\nthe book i keep thinking\nfive years ago the person who wrote how\nto be a boss which i still believe\neverything i wrote in that book but i\nthink i was resistant at first because i\nwas like no but i still love working and\ni still want to hustle and i still want\nthe awards and i'll be honest and say i\nwant the awards i want the events i want\nthe accomplishments i think the switch\nis not choosing between two things it's\nsaying you can have that but what does\nit mean yeah so what does it mean you\ndon't have to eliminate it but is the\naward your value or is it a consequence\nof you having great values on this\njourney yes that is so well said i love\nthat that it is not\nit is the consequence of having good\nvalues right is it your value is it the\nconsequence of having good values that\nis a beautiful line everyone cut that up\nmeme it up quote it put it out there no\nbut generally that's so powerful because\ni couldn't agree i couldn't agree with\nyou more i've i've whenever anyone asks\nme i care about awards i care about thai\ntours and i'm very honest and open about\nthat too yeah and i see it the exact\nsame way because to me it makes me feel\nlike mental health is winning yeah it\nmakes me feel like the things i'm\nstanding for are winning it helps me\nrealize that we are making a dent in the\nmainstream where these comments and\nthese conversations need to happen yes\nnow when i look back at what you're\nsaying here\nhow difficult was it to dismantle your\nvalue system because i think that's why\nwe don't do it right when you actually\nlook at it and you go wow i value my\nwork or i value how much people like me\nor i value how many followers i have or\ni value how many positive comments i get\nwhen you live in that world\nwhich a lot of people do you don't have\nto be a creator or an artist to feel\nthat way\nhow do you get the courage to actually\nlook inward and go\nwow i need to dismantle my value system\nyeah it can be really really scary and i\nthink you're absolutely right that's why\npeople hesitate to do it because it's so\nso strange there were moments when i was\nwriting the book when i was alone in a\nroom no one else was there and i would\nfind myself\nbsing a little on the page i'm like who\nare you lying to there's no one here\nlike rip this up and start again like\nwhat are you actually what do you\nactually care about because years ago if\ni'm honest i wouldn't sit here and say\nno i do care about money i do actually\ncare about i like that i have a big i\nwouldn't say that because i would think\ni'm gonna come across this way and\nthat's not what i'm supposed to care\nabout\nno again it's be honest with yourself\nyou're allowed to value whatever you\nwant it's just doing the work to\nunderstand what those things mean and if\nalso those things should be the driving\nforces behind your happiness because the\nthing with the awards and all that stuff\nis like i said when you think of them\nlike a consequence if they happen great\nbut if they don't happen\nyour whole world doesn't crash down i\nthink that was the issue i had before i\nwrote this book i thought oh my post is\nnot getting these likes oh i don't have\nthe work my travels got cancelled\nnow i don't have purpose value and\nhappiness that is where i don't want to\nbe and so i think\nit was scary for me to figure out my\nvalues but also\nmore than scary just really difficult\nbecause there is no map to do that you\nknow i remember sitting down writing\nthis book and for two days i would just\nstare at a blank screen thinking\nif this was a math problem i would be\nable to google this i would be able to\ndig up some lesson from my math teacher\nbut we've just never been taught as kids\nhow to do any of this work so that's\nwhat i'm attempting to go through in\nthis book i love it and and i want to\ndive into it and what i love as i said\nabout the book is that there's all these\nbeautiful sketches and you're telling me\nyes just offline you were telling me\nabout the amazing artists that did these\ncan you just absolutely so the artist\nher name is paper samosa on instagram\nher name is simi she's fantastic but the\nstory is that a couple years ago when i\ngot my late night show we had no money\nno budget and i had this office in the\nwriters room and i was like oh i really\nneed some pizzazz because it's a\ncreative space we have no money to buy\nart or anything like that so i found her\non instagram and i said would you be\nwilling to gift me a few prints so i can\nput it in my writing room for the first\nseason of my late night show\ni don't have a budget to offer you from\nthe studio but i promise you like i'll\nbe so appreciative and maybe karma will\ncome around\nand then when i did this book i was like\nyou know what\nshe's going to illustrate my book so\nit's a complete full circle moment\nthat's so beautiful and a lesson to\neveryone if i ask for something free\nyou should do everyone should just give\nme f uh you know lamborghini ferrari you\nshould just give me the free thing\nbecause you never know it will come back\nyou never it will come back it's\nguaranteed\ni love it no but they're honestly\nincredible and one of the things you\ntalk about in this book that i love is\nyou talk about this idea of coming home\nyes and when i started to read that in\nyour book and there's obviously each\nchapter you talk about coming home to\nsomething different\ni love that language because i think\nabout all the time even when i come home\nto my physical home\ni always think about what do i want to\ncome home to how do i want to feel\nespecially because i work hard i try my\nbest i'm doing this and that and i\nalways think what environment do i want\nto come home to\nwhat does coming home mean to you before\nwe dive into each chapter and where did\nthat language come to you from like what\ndoes that mean to you yeah i think you\nknow when i was writing this book i\nreally wanted it to be\nhey you don't need to\nhave a bunch of fancy tips and tricks\nand all these ways to get happy it's\nreally something that's within you\nalready and it's organizing what's\nwithin you and deciding where you want\nto go from there and so i've learned\nthat home is not a place it is not a\nphysical building you know it is and i\nespecially learned that during covid\nbecause i was in the physical building\nof my home and i wasn't able to see my\nfamily for two years and i was like i\ndon't feel like i'm at home\nhome for me is a place that gives you\nthat feeling of safety\nsecurity\nno judgment you can just be\nand return to what really matters you\nknow a reset so i came up with these\nplaces mentally that could be home that\nwhen you go out in the day and you hear\nyour friends spilling the tea and your\nother friends got relationship drama and\nall this stuff is going down where can\nyou come home to in your mind to reset\nand no judgment and recharge just like\nyou would physically yeah you know yeah\nyeah and let's go into that because i\nthink and you've posted about this\nseveral times and you post like candidly\nand you'll post like what you really\nlook like right now versus you know one\nof the shows you did the night before so\nif i'm wearing spanx you will know yeah\nyou know and it's like you're so open\nabout it but i've heard you talk about\nhow like so often when we look in the\nmirror we're criticizing ourselves or so\noften when we see ourselves in a certain\nway we are judgmental so for a lot of\npeople coming home is actually all those\nthings as well absolutely tell us about\nhow you've started to shift that\ndialogue for yourself like when we look\nin the mirror\nmore people are probably saying\nsomething negative about themselves than\npositive about themselves right i have\nlearned that i very seldom give myself\ncut myself any slack i am truly and i\nknow it's cliche but i'm truly my\ntoughest critic in the sense that i\ncould have a super\nsuccessful day and the one hiccup that\nwent wrong i'll look in the mirror and\ni'd be like okay well next time we got\nto make sure that doesn't happen and you\ngot to be better prepared and so i am\nvery critical of myself and that's why\nthe language coming home was so\nimportant to me because home is not a\nplace you should feel that judgment\nand why i wrote come home is okay i'm\ngonna go to this place mentally where\nlily even you you don't get to tell\nyourself all the things that went wrong\nyou don't get to be that you get you let\nyourself be human at home you know home\nis where the pants are not you let\nyourself be human and so that was really\nimportant to me i've it sounds simple\nbut it's a complex idea of i've given\nmyself permission to be a human yes at\nhome yes yes and and i think we all have\nto get to that point and you're right it\nisn't a tip or a trick or a life hack\nit is just changing that inner dialogue\nwith yourself of starting to realize\nthat by the way when i do call myself\nlike i realize this when i\ni realized that when i made myself feel\nguilty\nthat didn't lead to growth yes like my\nguilt actually blocked my growth when i\nwas guilty that i didn't go to the gym\nthat maybe made me go to the gym the\nnext day but it didn't last yeah when i\nwas guilty that i had something that i\nwish i didn't eat\nthat guilt didn't make me\neat healthy yes for the next week it\nmade me made bad decisions guilt made me\nfeel worse about myself right and make\nworse decisions\nso i had to coach myself out of having\nguilty thoughts absolutely what what are\nsome of those thoughts that you think\nlike there it sounded like when you said\nyou're your own toughest critic\nwhere does that come from is that also\nfrom our parenting is that i mean i\nthink i think it's a mix of things i\nthink one thing is that i'm a very all\nor nothing type person and i've been\ntrying i've been trying to work on this\nand jay knows and i'll be very honest\nand say that i consider myself a really\ngood friend but i've caught myself being\nslightly annoying because i know it's\ntrue it's true i can fully admit this\ni'll invite jay over\nand everything will be perfect the food\nwill be perfect and the table will be\nperfect and i have all the activities\nplanned it's good to go and then jay as\nhe does we'll show up you know 20\nminutes late he'll blame rodney and he's\ndefinitely rodney's fault by the way and\nthen just to clarify that is definitely\nright i'm always on time okay\nrob he's not here to defend herself but\nwho knows but then in my mind i've my\nmind will start going oh well oh my god\nthe evening is ruined now because they\ncame true and it's i do that with\neverything i do it to such a detriment\nwhere it's like it's either perfect or\nit's nothing now i can't enjoy it and i\nthink that has to do with control i\nthink i can understand all and i can\nunderstand nothing the compromise in the\nmiddle\nbeing someone who controls things they\ndon't like that compromise that's not in\nmy control and so i've had to let go of\nthis all or nothing mentality hey you\ndid so great today it wasn't perfect but\nit was really really good and we're\ngoing to celebrate that you know it's\nnot letting because you're right that\nguilt does start to control your life\nand also going back to the home concept\nhome is somewhere\nyou don't want to run away from you know\nhome is somewhere you return to i think\nwhat i really struggled with for so long\nis i did do those tips and tricks you've\nbeen to my house you know my old house i\nhad all these post-its everywhere and i\nhad positive affirmations that's all\ngreat\nbut that's all i had\ni had these little ways of being happy\nmomentarily temporarily\nand then i would wander off somewhere\nelse mentally but if you say come home\nto a place that really means hey\nthis is where you are going to return to\nspiritually no matter what happens in\nyour day always so that you cannot be\nled astray because i get led astray very\nold and very happy\nwe all do and and the thing i love about\nthat is in your book you talk about\nnothing lasts forever and you talk about\nthe need to be okay with change\nand that includes not just changing\nscenarios like me coming late to your\nhouse but but also the idea of\nchange in that we change\nand what you just said you completely\nagree with everything you wrote in your\nlast book but you have an evolved\nversion of that today that doesn't take\naway from what you said\nhow have you allowed yourself to update\nlike we\nwe think of updating our phones and our\ncomputers easily yes but when it comes\nto updating ourselves and upgrading\nourselves we get really slow and scared\nabout it how have you become okay with\nthe fact that you're a changing evolving\nadapting person yeah well before writing\nthis book i would not be okay with it i\ntalk about in the book how\ni did subscribe to this mentality that\nthere's right and wrong that if i\ndon't necessarily agree with everything\ni've done and said in the past and now i\nthink differently that must mean the\npast version of me was wrong and i would\nthink that that means if that person\ndoesn't agree with what i'm saying\nthey're wrong and i'm right\nit doesn't need to be wrong or right we\ndon't need to assign these labels so\neasily to things i know we like to\ncategorize things in our brain as in\nwrite wrong black white okay easy hard\nbut really what it is it's allowing\nyourself and giving yourself permission\nto think differently and evolve and so\nfor me the hardest example of this is\nhow i define success\nyou know\nwhat i was taught and for much of my\nlife i believe success is the paycheck\nit is the house it is the car it is the\nawards there's all that stuff it is the\ncareer you have\nand it's not that i think i was wrong\nfor thinking that it's that my my\ndefinition of success has changed now\nall those things are great but now if i\nhave all of those things but i'm not\nhappy and i'm not having fun\nthen i'm not successful yeah and that's\nwhat i believe now again not right or\nwrong it's just i'm changing i'm in\ndifferent a different place in my life i\nhave different values and different\npriorities and that's okay i think i\nresisted that for so long because i was\nlike don't be lazy that's lazy you have\nto pull the all-nighter you have to do\ndon't be lazy\nbut it's not about that it's about hey\nyou are a human that is evolving and\nyou're in different circumstances you\ncannot grow and expect to stay the same\nso well said so well honestly everything\nyou're saying is like i\ni couldn't be happier hearing it from\nyou\nbecause\ni think so many people are inspired by\nyou and all of you look up to you like\nincluding me\nand\nwhen i see you having these revelations\nand realizations based on your own inner\nwork it gives me so much confidence that\neveryone who looks up to you is being\ninspired in this beautiful direction and\ni also love that you value hard work and\nthat you value putting in the time and\nyour attention to detail because that's\nalso something i appreciate about you\nyeah so whether i'm a friend or whether\nsomeone in business i appreciate your\npurpose but i also appreciate your\npracticality like the fact that you are\nan effective human being who manages\ntime effectively and i think again what\nyou're saying is we've been living in\nthis society which is either or you\neither have to be lazy or you're\nproductive right but we don't have this\nin between yeah which is i know how to\ndo what i need to do when i need to do\nit but then i also know how to let go i\nthink the internet has convinced us of\nthat a lot that there's either this or\nthat yeah there's this or that\nnot fully appreciating that we're\ncomplex human beings that fall on\nvarious spots on various spectrums and\nwe are all in our own circumstances yeah\nlike we don't give ourselves enough\ncredit no no no please don't want to\nhave that i'm not going to mess up with\nthis yeah it's i think i think that's\nlike the it's what i have here and i\nwanted to read this out because i i had\nit marked but it's kind of like before i\nget into what i wanted to read it's your\nclassic green sorry silver sorry dilemma\nit's so good right\nand the debate yes right and that's what\nit is it's like it's this or is this yes\nand that's the only two ways it can be\nthere's something you wrote that i want\nto read out because i want people to\nrealize that this isn't even though this\nis a okay and you can correct me if i'm\nwrong but the way i say this is a book\nthat is going to inspire help\nand guide people through their own inner\nwork it is that but at the same time it\nis also a book where you like really\nopen up and get vulnerable and raw and i\nwanted to read something for people to\nrealize just how how that comes across\nso you use that you say\ni can't do lily's voice i can't do\nimpressions i can't do accents or he's\nactually a great actor he's like i have\nnone of those skills so i will not try i\nwill simply read it in my british accent\nall right so at the age of 30 i came out\nas bisexual to my family it was\ndefinitely the hardest thing i've ever\ndone in my life and the lead up to that\nmoment was filled with anxiety out of\nfear that i would lose my words i wrote\nmy parents a letter printed it out and\nplaced it in front of them\nall i could muster up the courage to say\nwas\nread this\ni vividly remember feeling a pang of\nguilt when my mom jokingly responded to\nthe letter by saying\nare you getting married\ni went upstairs while they read it\nunable to be in the same room with them\nand waited for what felt like an entire\nlifetime for anything\na knock on my door a tap on my shoulder\nafter a long silence finally i heard\nfootsteps and my parents entered my room\nlike when you take me into a place like\nthat\nin your book i'm like wow this\nyou know it's it's so intimate\nand\ni feel so grateful that we get to go\nthere with you as a reader in your book\nbecause these are not things that you\nmake videos about these are not things\nthat you talk about every day\nand people see you share your sexuality\nand where you are\nbut they don't understand what's going\non in your head because we only get this\none moment or headline lily singh\nannounces this and that's what people\nsee right but then this is what's going\non behind the scenes and the book does\nthis again and again again\ntell me about that moment\nand tell us about\nhow that journey has evolved over time\nand and even before and after i just\nwant to hear about that whole process\nyeah from things i know as your friend\nbut i want to hear from how you feel\nabout it through the book absolutely so\ni have to give credit to my editor here\nbecause\nyou're right i don't openly talk about\nthis a lot you might see me holding the\npride flag on instagram\nbut i don't actually go into\nwhat that experience was like and and\nfor the reason of it's just something\nthat i don't want taken out of context\nand i know the media will run with it\nand i know people will not actually put\nthemselves into that time and place and\nso i thought the book was a perfect\nopportunity for me to really talk about\nthis the first time i wrote this chapter\ni skimmed over it i was like so i did\nthis thing and then my parents came and\nthen my editor was like\nhey\ni really think you should take the\nreader into exactly where you were and\nit's the best\nnote she's ever given me because i was\nlike you know what lily again no one's\nin the room here when you're writing\nthis actually open up like people could\nreally use this perspective and so i did\nand it was very difficult to write even\nas you were reading it i was like\nit's a heavy emotional thing but\nthe reason it was important for me to\ntalk about this is this is one of the\nbiggest changes that has ever happened\nin my life and like i said the scariest\nthing i've ever done in my life and it\nwas\nsomething that i had to really address\nhead-on because to be honest i don't\nthink\ni don't think i was honest about what\nthat situation was in my mind for so\nmany years you know i came up to my\nparents at 30\nand\na lot of people don't know this i'm very\ntype a so they shouldn't be surprised\nbut i actually came out to myself 30\ndays before that\nso\non september 1st i\nin my room came out to my dog\nscarborough for the first time ever to\nmyself prior to this i had thoughts and\nfeelings like\ni don't know why i'm not just so\ncommitted in the relationships i'm in\nsomething fuels off you know growing up\ni didn't know a single queer person\nin my high school there was not a single\nqueer person\nthis was not euphoria my high school was\nnot euphoria\num in university i knew of one queer\nperson and it was it was someone who\nidentified as a male and i was so\ndifferent from him so i never really\nconnected with him\nand so\nat the age of 30 i came out to myself\nso at the age of 29 i came up to myself\nand i said before my 30th birthday i'm\ngoing to come out to all the people that\nmatter in my life and it was a list of\nlike 10 people and my parents were last\nof course type i had a list to do let's\nnot have a to-do list to come out as i\nwould it was right in there but in\nbetween steam the napkins um\nand so they were last on the list and i\nthought okay\ni am going to tell them i'm going to\nwrite them this letter and in my brain i\nhad\nthought up this scenario of all the\nthings they were gonna do and say and i\nhad two versions of it one was this is\ngonna go horrible again all or nothing\nit's gonna go horrible they're not gonna\nunderstand just in case i'm gonna have\nthis idea of things i need to pack in my\nbag so i can leave the house like just\nall of these worst-case scenarios\nand then the opposite was\nor\nthey are going to\nthrow me a party and then and there\nbecause they're gonna be so proud all or\nnothing mentality the truth is that they\ncame into my room and the first thing\nthat my mom did was give me a big hug\nand said\nwhy are you crying you're my daughter\nand i love you regardless\nbeautiful amazing\ni was so scared in that moment and so\nnervous\nthat because they were not saying the\nexact sentences i expected them to say\ni was a little dismissive to be honest\nand it pains me to admit that because i\nknow so often in these stories\nwe want to hear that like\nsupport the kid no matter what the kid\nis right but i was dismissive and i\ndidn't give my parents the credit that\nthey deserved of being like they\nprobably don't even know what this is\nthey've never been introduced to this\nidea before and so we had the\nconversation\nthey did and said things of support they\ndid not disown me they did not kick me\nout of the house they did none of those\nthings but i left that conversation\nneeding an enemy to be honest i needed\nto distance myself\nfrom people even though they were being\nsupportive because i was so insecure i\nhad just done this big thing in my life\nand i didn't know how to figure it out i\ndidn't know how to now navigate the\nworld i felt so insecure everyone's\nstaring at me these headlines are saying\nall these things so i distanced myself\nfrom so many people including my family\nnot because they weren't being\nsupportive even though i convinced\nmyself that was what it was was because\ni just couldn't\nbe in close proximity to people that i\nfelt like i was disappointing even\nthough\nthey were not disappointed you know and\nthat was a hard pill for me to swallow\nbecause that takes a lot of you\nadmitting that\nyou don't have it figured out and like\nyou didn't give your parents enough\ncredit and so i'm happy to say that me\nand my parents are so close today and\nwe're so lovely and\num it's just a lesson i learned that\nit's so easy again to go back to right\nand wrong but everyone is a human in\ndifferent circumstances\nand it doesn't have to be all or nothing\nyeah wow that that honest thank you for\nsharing that like that is just it's so\npowerful on so many levels and i felt\nthe same by the way when i was reading\nit it felt it was like it's\ntransformative it's transformative for\nme too even just the idea of what you\nsaid that when we make a decision\nwe expect all or nothing results or we\nexpect extreme responses\nand actually life somewhere in between\nand when you get that in between you\nthen don't know what to do with it\nbecause you only prepared your mind for\nthe extremes and what's really special\nabout what you said is\nalthough what you needed was compassion\nin that moment\nyou also needed to express compassion to\nthem for their experience yes absolutely\nand that's a really interesting\nconversation that you're starting where\nit's like well i needed them to be\ncompassionate to my human experience\nbut they needed my compassion\nbecause they don't understand\nthis because they've never been exposed\nto it potentially yeah and that trading\nof compassion is a really beautiful\nthing in the world which i think is so\noften missing i think i could not agree\nmore\nthey gave me the compassion i can sit\nhere and tell you i did not return it i\nthought they should immediately\nunderstand\nhow how would they immediately\nunderstand this and i see this all the\ntime with the world especially on social\nmedia it's\nespecially with cancel culture it's they\ndidn't get it right away\nthey don't get a chance to redeem\nthemselves they made a mistake well they\ncan improve it is this lack of giving\npeople the benefit of the doubt and\nbeing human and this lack of compassion\nyou know it's that if you really look\nback and these are not excuses it's the\nreality of the circumstances my parents\nthis was not the thing they grew up with\nlike i said their concerns growing up\nwere we have to make it we have to\nprovide for our kids\nand i know that any concern and i know\nthis in my heart i didn't know it in\nthat moment sitting in my room but i\nknow it now any concerns they might have\nexpressed were not because\nthey didn't love me or they wanted me to\nbe unhappy it's because in their\nunderstanding\nthey wanted to protect me from the world\nthey in their mind think this is going\nto make lily's life harder potentially\nwe are scared for her and we are to\nprotect her that's where they're coming\nfrom whether or not that's just is not\nthe conversation it's that that's their\ncircumstance what you've just done and\nwhat you've broken down for us is you've\nclearly articulated\nwhat compassion looks like in practice\nto actually understand where that\nperson's coming from why they think that\nway whether you agree with it or not or\ndisagree with it whether it's fair or\nunfair\nlet me take a moment to understand how\ndid that person get to where they are\nyeah and i think that even what we're\nseeing in movies today in media today i\nlove that we're getting into stories of\nhow people became who they became yes\nbecause it's so important we always tell\nthe origin story of heroes but we rarely\ntell the origin story of the villain\nno one ever knows how the villain became\nthe villain and then you start seeing\nmovies like joker come out and\neverything you start going oh like now\nwe're telling this story of how someone\ngot there when we don't agree with them\nand it's also this idea of\nif you really think about it the hero\nand the villain are the same person in\ndifferent circumstances\nand that's another thing that i write in\nthe book that i actually say during my\nmeditation every day is that i am\neveryone and everyone is mean we are in\ndifferent circumstances and the reason i\nsay that is because\nlily get off your high horse you are not\nright compared to someone else even\nthough you are in two different sides of\nthe spectrum of what you might agree on\nin a certain subject they have certain\ncircumstances you have certain\ncircumstances and the reality of the\nsituation is if i was born in a\ndifferent time and place and i were my\nparents i might have reacted even worse\nto because i might have reacted horribly\nand to say otherwise it's just a lie\nyeah it's so easy to be like if i were\nin your shoes i would have done this\nyou might not have you might have done\nworse because circumstances matter yeah\ni love that reminder i think\nit was a few years ago where i realized\nthat i wasn't better or worse than\nanyone\ni wasn't a head or behind of anyone i\nwasn't right and they were wrong or vice\nversa i was just me and how i processed\nthis experience yes and you brought up\nmeditation there let's dive into that\nbecause i know you've meditated for a\nlong time and it's continued to evolve\nas a practice for you in this book you\ntalk about our wonderful dear friend\ngenevieve harrison too yes which is\nwonderful to see\nuh because she's such a special human\nbeing and and i love that you're really\ngood at like in this book like you you\nknow you're just good at like picking\npeople who have had this impact and\nsharing their work with you\ntell us about what meditation looks like\nfor you now\nand and why the current practice that\nyou do of it is useful to you absolutely\nso i've really had to remind myself of\nthe it doesn't have to be all or nothing\nhere because although i aspire to be a\njay shetty i know when i've tried in the\npast to\nhave a rigid routine where i wake up at\na certain time and i meditate in a\ncertain place and it looks a certain way\ni have failed because for me\ni go to sleep at different times my\nschedule's awry and\nhonestly i get bored sometimes and\nthat's just me being really honest when\ni have a really rigid routine sometimes\ni get bored i need a little change so\nfor me what meditation looks like is\nnot every day i would say three ish\nfour-ish times a week i will listen to\none of john v songs actually i meditate\nto her music for me i like music for me\npersonally guided meditations i've\nlearned don't work and i've stopped\nbeing embarrassed about that even though\nsome of my dear friends have guided\nmeditations because i always start\nthinking about what the person looks\nlike and all that type of random stuff\nand if i listen to jay guide me through\na meditation i'm like jay i miss that\nguy and i'm gonna start to just wander\ninto all places so i personally use\nmusic especially because for me\ni'm i'm really connected to musicality\nand the journey it takes you on i'm\nreally into the highs and lows and\nvisualizing myself in all these places\nand so i mentioned to music for about 20\nminutes i use now the things i write\nabout in my book so i start my every\nmeditation by saying\ntoday the four things that matter are\nthe relationship to yourself the\nrelationship to the universe\nunderstanding distraction and\nimplementing design\ni check in on myself\ni'm really honest with myself how i feel\nwhat i'm grateful for\nif i'm having any petty thoughts i\nreally want to just like it's a really\nsafe space for me to be like hey you're\nallowed to process whatever is going\nthrough your mind right now and you\ndon't have to process it in a way where\nnow you're going to come up with\nsolutions it's just to know where you're\nat just connect with yourself how are\nyou feeling physically mentally\nemotionally that's it that's all i have\nto do\nnext\ni connect myself to the universe and the\nreason i do this is because i talk about\nin the book but it's also because in our\nindustry jay you can get very vain very\nfast it can become all about you very\nvery fast\ni\nreally value that reminder that i'm\nconnected to something greater and it\nalso helps me alleviate some of my\ncontrol issues that i have that not\neverything is in my control i'm\nconnected to something bigger connected\nto other people like i said i'm them\nthey're me and we're in different\ncircumstances i also then send\ncompassion and i talk about this in the\nbook which is for so long i would\nmeditate when i was upset\ni would\nask god for things when i'm having a bad\nday it's all about take take take from\nthe universe\nand i never really thought about well\nwhat are you putting back into the\nuniverse you know are you being a fair\npartner to the universe and so i spend\ntime\nreally thinking about how i can send\nlove and i literally visualize love and\nlike coming from my hands and sending it\nto whoever might need it\nyou know\nit might sound silly but before i judged\non canada's got talent when i meditated\ni actually sent love and light to all\nthe contestants i loved it because i was\nlike i know what it feels like i know\ni'm judging you but like if you're\nnervous and i visualize unless if you're\nnervous\nremember to have fun like know that i'm\ngoing to be with you on that stage i\njust try to send the energy to whoever\nneeds it that's beautiful all right i'm\njust going to take a moment and that is\nso beautiful thanks man i tried yeah i\nlove that um and then i go into\nunderstanding distraction and into\nimplementing design which i talked about\nin the book and that is\ni have defined distraction\nnot as the way we traditionally think of\nit you know your phone going off someone\ntalking during a movie all these things\nbut distraction is the things that take\nus away\nfrom where we want to be spiritually so\ntake us away from the home we've created\nsuddenly i'm feeling petty i'm comparing\nmyself to someone i'm feeling ungrateful\ni label all of those things as\ndistractions not because they aren't\nvalid but because i don't want to stay\nthere i want to go there process\nwhatever needs to happen and come back\nto this place where i am grateful and i\ndo have strong values\nand then i implement design and this is\nwhere my practicality and spirituality\nmakes up and this is hey you know the\nlife that you want\nstop\ntelling yourself all the reasons you\ncan't have those things\nand actually just design your life in a\nway where they can happen\nyou know and a prime example of that is\nso often i was told growing up that hey\nlike you can't have a career where you\ndress up and play pretend and you're\ncreative and you do like grow up get a\nreal career that's a phase\ni had to design a life where i was like\ni unsubscribed to that idea the idea\nthat i can do this as a career serves me\nbetter so i'm going to design my life\nthis way so a lot of that has to do with\nunsubscribing from the ideas that do not\nserve us because i\ni and i'm sure many other people\nwe have signed this invisible contract\non a lot of ideas\nthat do not benefit us but we do it\nanyways you know that is so well said\nbecause i remember when\ni fully had signed the contract that i\nwas going to work a full-time job\nand that teaching wisdom was going to be\nmy hobby\nthat i'd signed that contract i'd\nsubscribe to the idea that sharing\nwisdom could not be a full-time purpose\nit had to be something i did on evenings\nand weekends and now when i look back\nand i think i am so glad that at one\npoint i unsubscribed as you said\nfrom that ideology because otherwise i'd\nstill be in that same place yeah and\nit's incredible to think about it\nbecause it sounds easy to say it now but\ni can honestly say that when i started i\nhad no idea that anyone would care yeah\nat all\ni just knew that i believed deeply about\nwhat i was trying to share and that's\nwhat fueled me to keep trying yeah but\ni'm with you i was fully subscribed to\nthe idea this is not real job it's scary\nyeah unsubscribing to ideas i mean those\nideas exist for a reason society has\nthese ideas for reason because no one\nhas challenged them known as found a\ndifferent way and again it helps\ncategorize people into boxes yeah to\nunsubscribe from those ideas it's scary\nand it's risky and it feels like you're\nwalking a path alone\nbut\nthose are ideas they're not facts\nthere is no rulebook saying jay has to\ndo this and he can't do this as a job\nthere's no rule book like for so long i\nthought there was a written rule book\nthat i'm an indian woman i can only do\nthis things i have to be quiet i can't\nbe outspoken i have to do x y z\nwhere is this rule book like i have just\ndecided that that's what i'm going to\nlive my life by no like i do the work to\nlet go of those ideas and make your life\nthe things you want them to be it takes\nwork no one's saying it doesn't but it's\nso that work is so worth it absolutely\nmy auntie has that book at home if you\nneed a coffee\ni'm sure she does i'm sure she does\nas i'm sure there's a written word yeah\ni'm 100 i'm with you i'm with you this i\nlove i want to go back to this you talk\nabout the universe but you have this\ngraphic in here which is about the\nmissed calls from the universe which\nwhen i saw that i was like i need to\nread this section because i and and\nthat's how i went through the book i was\nlike i was looking at stuff that was and\ni was like oh this i love i love this\nlet me read what it's about\ntell me about that because i think that\nlike you said we're always expecting the\nuniverse to give to us but you're\nactually saying here that we're missing\ncalls from the universe\nwhat are those missed calls what are\nthose signs that we're\ngetting but that we keep missing well i\nthink it's a lot of things i think it's\nhow we think about even failure and loss\nwe don't think that there's at least in\nthat moment we don't think that there's\nsomething bigger at play you know we we\nhave this tendency to think when we're\nsad that the world is against us the\nuniverse is against us because that's a\ncomforting and easy place to go to i am\nhurt it's because my life sucks and this\nis sucky and my day was sucky and in\nthat moment we don't think that\nsomething bigger is at play we're\nmissing calls from the universe\ni can genuinely say any horrible thing\nthat has happened to me any failure any\nloss\nthere has been an exchange there i lost\nsomething and then i gained something\nbecause of that thing\nand that's how we have to think about\nthe universe the universe is constantly\nexchanged everything is an exchange and\nit is a relationship that we really need\nto foster because we ignore it so often\nwe don't think about that hey i actually\nhave my job today and i have the\nfollowing i have today\nbecause i spoke so openly about my\nexperience going through mental health\nand people related to me great but we\ndon't actually dissect like hey remember\nthat time you're really sad\nthis is the exchange for that the\nuniverse actually came around and gave\nyou something so why do you not nurture\nthat relationship you know i talk a lot\nabout\npeople who\nhave a lot and have really tough pass\nand perhaps we don't give ourselves the\nopportunity to analyze what those losses\ngave us and i think we should yeah\nbecause i think that makes them\nsilver linings and it makes us realize\nthat like hey there's something bigger\nat play what do you think your biggest\nloss or failure was internally or\nexternally like what was that when you\nthink about\nthat moment where you felt lost\nas you say in the subtitle of the book\nbut also the idea of when you feel\nyou've lost\nright feeling lost and feeling like\nyou've lost when was that for you\nand and how did\nobviously we know how you processed it\nbecause that's what the book's about but\nwhen was that for you how did you\nidentify that i mean there's a few\nmoments but if i'm being really really\nhonest the most recent one on the one\nthat was most profound and i think this\nis for a lot of people because it was an\nextraordinary circumstance was during\nquarantine you know i really did feel\nlike i lost momentum in my job i felt\nlike\ni definitely physically was in the worst\ni would walk up the stairs nobody\nwounded because i was doing nothing i\nwasn't leaving the house i was just\ni literally baked 30 cookies every day\nand played fortnite you know this i\nasked you to play with me every day um\nbut i was in such a place where i was so\nlost and had no direction and i remember\nthinking man i've worked so hard at\nstuff and these two years is gonna\ncompletely derail me and i'm gonna start\nfrom scratch and all my momentum is\ngoing to be gone\nand i could not see any light in that\nsituation especially because of what was\nhappening in the world i saw no light in\nthat situation\nif quarantine didn't happen\nwithout doubt there would never be\nanother time in my life where i actually\nwould have the time to do this work\nbecause i would be so busy with\ndistractions and obligations and i joke\nthat quarantine forced me to pause and\nreflect it forced me because otherwise i\nwould have never done it i truly would i\nwould have still been going on a flight\nright now i would have been burnt out\ntimes a million right now yeah and so\nthis book i keep calling it a gift to\nmyself\nit is the gift that coveted quarantine\ngave me yeah so that loss that mean\nbeing lost\nthe exchange of that was me doing this\nwork i love that idea of the loss and\nthe exchange like that that's such a we\nunderstand it with everything else you\nbuy something from a store you eat\ncalories you understand it with\neverything else but we don't tend to\nunderstand it spiritually because we\ncan't connect it exactly yeah yeah we\ndon't do the work to connect it we're\nnever taught to connect it and i'm\nencouraging people to make those\nconnections yeah and understand and\nit'll help you understand loss and it'll\nhelp you understand that the universe is\nbig and it's glorious and it's magical\nand you should be open to and you should\nbe connecting and nourishing that\nrelationship yeah and and you're\nbringing i mean you're saying it's a\ngift to yourself this book is definitely\na gift to everyone who's going to read\nit genuinely it genuinely is because\nit's\ni think what you just said about\ncoveting the pandemic i think that was a\nworldwide phenomenal experience\nphenomena and experience it was that's\nhow everyone felt in some way and yes in\ndifferent extremes and different\nexperiences but that was a unified\nfeeling that these two years are\nderailing my life it postponed my\nwedding it means i'll never see my\nfamily again potentially because i lost\nthem yeah it means i can't get the\ncareer i wanted i started a new job but\nwe're not in the office so i don't meet\nanyone i'm just stuck in my tiny\napartment right like\nthat experience and that's why if you're\nsaying that that's what catalyzed all of\nthese reflections\nand the work then it is a gift to\neveryone because that's exactly what\neveryone needs to hear yeah so\none of the things i want to dive into\nis\nthis idea that\nyou you bring about around\ndistractions\nand\ni've seen you like and implementing\ndesign if anyone wants to know how good\nlily is at implementing design play\nfortnight with her\nand watch her play katan and you\nliterally just don't exist because she's\njust like you know just\nand i love the way your mind works\nbecause we always joke about this that\nwe have we have a lot of similarities we\nare very\nvery similar when i see i see so much of\nmyself in lilly all the time yes uh\nanytime i'm in an argument with anyone\nand i want someone to see my point of\nview i will call job like jay is gonna\nknow exactly where i'm coming from here\nyeah and i relate to you fully and we're\ntotally on the same page but when i see\nyou and i see you operate in that way\nand now that you're bringing this\ncompassionate heart to it this kindness\nto it and and you're able to implement\ndesign in that way\nhas it become more joyful\nin the execution of stuff\nlike i want to hear about how you\nexecute differently now because we've we\ntalked about how to be a boss and that\nwas like the book before yeah and we\ntalked about that that is important but\nnow we're going back to them like now\nwhen you're hustling or now when you're\nworking really hard or now when you're\nbeing productive\nhow is it now fueled with joy how do you\nmake sure that now it's coming from a\nplace of meaning yeah so i\nposted about this recently this is not a\njoke for anyone that doesn't follow me\nuh my vision board is in my shower yes\nit is in my shower it's like it is taped\nto the glass outside of my shower so i\nsee it every single day yes i literally\nyes i see it every day smack dab in the\nmiddle of my vision board\nbecause my vision board is structured in\na way where the things in the middle are\nmy core values and then it builds out\nand right in the middle is\nmake sure you have fun\nso part of my foundation my triangle is\nthat\nmy relationship with myself and my\nrelationship with the universe and how i\nimplement design is going to be that my\ndefinition of success must include fun\nit did not previously\nin my come up in my career i did a lot\nof events and gigs and things where i\nwas like i don't care about this at all\nthis is horrendous but i will do it i\nwill do the free gig i will do this gig\ni'm not passionate about to earn my\nstripes we all work hard with this idea\nthat i'm gonna get to this place where\neventually i can call the shots i can do\nwhat i wanna do we get so caught up in\nthe climb that even when we're in the\nposition to do what we wanna do we're\nclimbing still because now it's a habit\nit's a habit and we've forgotten the\nreason we started in the first place\nthat's where i was so now\nhaving fun is a requirement of anything\ni say yes to it doesn't matter what\nopportunity comes in my inbox\nif i'm not going to have fun\nit is not going to happen and so yes\nbecause of that decision things are more\nmore joyful when i'm doing a podcast or\ni'm presenting something on stage i'm\nnot going into it thinking nail every\nline it's got to be perfect you got to\nexecute and then you got to network it's\nhey\nthis is pretty cool that we're here and\ni think you should go there and i think\nby the end of the night lily i think you\nshould go home and i think you should\nsay hey you know what\nthat was like really fun\nbecause if you don't have that\nit doesn't matter yeah it really doesn't\nmatter and there is no point that\ndoesn't mean you can't do it well that\ndoesn't mean you can't be prepared i\nwill still do all of those things but i\nwill find the joy\nin doing all these extraordinary things\nthat i get to do and i learned this\nespecially because i'm sad to admit that\nin my first world tour i mean think\nabout this a 30 city world tour not many\npeople can say they've done that in\ntheir life i got to meet with my fans i\nhad all these costumes and how old were\nyou oh this was like six years ago yeah\nso\nyeah 14.\nyeah i\nwould be lying if i said that i\nremembered every moment of that because\ni was so fixated on\nthis lighting cue and this next thing i\nhave to say and the t-shirt says\neverything has to be perfect and i'm not\nsaying again evolution not all or\nnothing i'm not saying that's not\nimportant it is and i know you're like\nthis too we like things to be a certain\nquality\nbut that doesn't mean\nyou can't be present and have fun yes\nright you should still have fun and so\nnow i've decided everything i do the\ncriteria is joy and fun yeah i love what\nyou just said about the habit\nand how that habit and and i get\nat least let me clarify you can correct\nme if i'm wrong but what i'm hearing you\nsay is that\nthere was a time when to earn your\nstripes you had to do things that didn't\nnecessarily extract joy but you saw them\ncreating platforms from which you could\nexperience joy but what happens is that\nas you keep reaching those platforms you\nmaintain that habit and that pattern\nthat stops you again and again and again\nfrom saying there's another platform\nyeah from which i can be in full joy\nright absolutely correct and so earning\nyour stripes wasn't the mistake that's a\nhealthy thing and that's needed in\neveryone\nbut what was the mistake was that habit\nthat gets formed of like i will be\nnot happy because that's what you're\nsaying i will allow myself to have fun\nwhen exactly there's always another\nbetter time or place where this joy\ncould happen and and i think that's a\nlearned thing as well\nyou know i talk about how\nmy parents\nhave earned their stripes above and\nbeyond they immigrated to canada in the\n70s worked so hard you know my dad had\nmultiple jobs he grew from one position\nto the next they're so well off now and\nthey've done such a great job both of\ntheir kids are taken care of they don't\nneed to work they don't need to save up\nfor anything\ngod knows i'm not getting married they\ndon't need to use that money for\nanything you know what i mean\nand i always tell them like why aren't\nyou guys traveling everywhere and like\ndoing all the things\nand they still are in that mindset of\nlike\nno because you know we have to save up\nfor for things and we can't do those\nthings now we're too old for those\nthings that\nit's that habit that we can't do that\nyet we're not there yet yeah\nwe are so often we are there yeah and if\nwe keep chasing that no not yet not yet\nlater we're gonna miss out on that joy\nyeah that's so so well said and i fully\nagree with you too i i was sitting down\nwith my team recently and just saying\nthat\ni i want to be able to do things that i\nwant to do that are risks and are fun\nand are things people don't expect of me\nyeah because that's what you work hard\nfor is to be able to do that i was like\neven doing this was a risk in the first\nplace exactly so why would i stop taking\nrisks now like\nyou know because i think we get\nprotective as well right and and to me i\nthink taking risks has always been a\ncore value of mine and he and now i'm\nlike i want to take more risks and i\nwant to do things that surprise me and\nsurprise other people and\nand and are not things that people\nexpect because when i started this\npeople didn't expect it either\nabsolutely so why it's funny how we\nespecially people like me and you we and\nother creatives as well we\nstepped outside of a box\nonly to then\nput ourselves in another box it's just a\nslightly bigger box totally totally yeah\nfor comfort and safety exactly and we\nkeep doing that and then i always have\nto remind myself and sometimes i have to\nremind my team when they're like hey\nthis is not how things are traditionally\ndone and hey we should do things like\nthis i'm like\nyou have to know who you're talking to\nhere because right now i have a wig and\na beard on my face and i'm dressed up as\nmy dad so you need not tell me about\nthings you need not tell me how things\nare usually done absolutely i was at\ndinner the other day and\ni i paid for the dinner and and the two\npeople i was with one of them said to me\nthey said jay you are bucking every\nindustry trend like someone else should\nhave picked up the check\nand i was like i my response to that\nstraight away and they were very\ngrateful and they were wonderful about\nit but my response to that was i want to\nbreak every tradition absolutely because\nthese traditions have just again who\nwrote the rule book\nand the more we subscribe when i feel\nthe same way whenever anyone says to me\nlike but yeah this is how it's done or\nthis is what this role is or this what\nthis i'm like says who yeah most of\nthese roles are not going to exist in 10\nyears and why is it not done another way\ntotally why is it not done another way\ntotally you know and those were yeah\ngoing on and another thing i was going\nto say the bigger lesson i've learned\nhere is that i need to go out to more\ndinners with you\ni was like what jay's picking up checks\naround here\nwhat\ni i think i think yes yeah i i mean\nanytime i will unsubscribe to the idea\nthat i should pay for the check and you\ncan pay for the check i'm okay with that\nwell with us actually everyone knows the\ntruth we're always competing we're\nalways over who does this just everyone\nhas violence jay is very sneaky comes to\nmy house he's like no no no next time\nnext time then the next time is always\nhe's sneaky so you definitely have to\npull the basic moves of like running and\ngiving the credit card in advance\ni'm one of those awkward plant-based\npeople who doesn't want to cause like\npressure to other people and like you\nknow we're just two uncles battling it\nout for the check it's fine it's just\nfun i love it\nall right lily so we have dissected how\nto be a triangle\nbut we have literally scratched the\nsurface there are so many incredible\nmessages in this book the sections that\nlily talked about in this interview\nthey go so much more deeper there are so\nmany more takeaways there are so many\nmore beautiful moments where you're\ngoing to have these light bulb moments\nand these moments of insight and\nreflection for yourself\nand\ni honestly believe that this you know i\ni think and i read a lot of non-fiction\nself-help and\nmindset books it's i love that stuff\nand sometimes it can get repetitive and\nthis was\none of the first books i've read in a\nlong time\nbut this was so authentically you\nlike it was just so you like everything\nyou said was so you and it was so\ngenuine to who you are that i was like\nthis is so real and that's why it works\nfor people and that's why it will work\nfor people and when people apply it they\nwill feel change in their life because\nyou're not trying to teach or you're not\ntrying to preach or you're not trying to\nguide you're literally saying like this\nis what worked for me\nand this is how i think about stuff\nand it's so simple yet so practical yet\nso\nuh applicable to people\nthat i was just blown away as to how you\nit is and i could hear your voice in my\nhead that's i love that yeah i could\nhear your voice in my head as you as you\nthink through an idea i'm like that is\nexactly how lily would explain it to me\nif i say next feature and i think that's\nbeautiful for people to know that\nbecause i think people can read a lot of\nself-help and be like oh this is\nrepetitive or i've heard this before or\nsomeone said and i'm like\nsure but we have to hear it from\nsomeone's unique experience and i think\nyou captured that really well so thank\nyou for doing that i appreciate that\nthat's exactly what i wanted the impact\nto be so thank you yeah thank you all\nright so we're gonna end\nuh this interview with what we call the\nfinal five all right these are a rapid\nfire fast five um which i always break\nthe rules on okay so i'm gonna\ndefinitely break sometimes tell me more\nand so anyway we try and answer these in\none word to one sentence okay cool i'm\ndefinitely gonna break those rules\nokay\nit's\nyeah all right okay question number one\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nthat reaction sorry to everyone who's\nlistening to this\ni'm not sorry this is how i feel um okay\nthis supposed to be rapid oh my god uh\ni shouldn't call it rapid i should call\nit um\ni should change the name now you just\nmade me realize it show me rapid it\nshould be more like condensed five but\nthat sounds terrible i mean it's\ndefinitely probably gonna be\nokay it can be a quote it's actually\ngonna be a quote i lived there and lived\nby it i actually first heard it from my\nbig fat greek wedding oh cool okay and\nthe quote is and i'll never forget it is\ndon't let your past define who you are\nlet it be a part of who you become and i\nthink that speaks really well to the\nevolution we were talking about earlier\ngreat answer that was well thank you\nthat's good\nall right question number two what is\nthe worst advice you've ever received\ni think what we talked about this is how\nthings have usually been done is tried\nand tested yeah definitely i don't want\nto hear that about anything in my life i\ndon't want to hear it even i'm not even\ntalking about work stuff i don't want to\nhear about anything in my life\nabsolutely about how one should\nbe spiritual how once you have\nrelationships about how one should form\nfriendships i don't think any idea\nshould be treated as a fact ideas are\njust that their ideas to be explored\nlove that you have full permission to\navoid the one sentence because that's a\ngreat answer thank you so feel free if\nanything i asked you and you want to\nexpand on it just so accommodating\nthings no no because that was such a\ni'm so happy you expanded on that\nbecause i love that you stressed out to\neverything like i i think the idea of\nnot just saying this isn't just about\nwork or people in an industry\nthe fact that you talked about how to be\nspiritual like i that resonated so\ndeeply with me um i love that and so\nplease please expand okay question\nnumber three how would you describe your\ncurrent purpose in life i think my\npurpose\nis to be a destructor\ni have come to terms with that word\nit used to\nmean\ndestruction chaos to me but now it means\nbeautiful chaos to me i want to disrupt\nsystems\nand ideas and that does include paving\nthe path yes i want to disrupt the\nindustry i want to disrupt how tv and\nfilm is made i want to disrupt the\nstories we see but in everything in my\nfamily i am a disrupter i'm the first\nthat has done many many things my\nparents will openly tell you\ni wanted to just disrupt and shake\nthings up that was my purpose yeah and i\nthink what's interesting about that\nwhich i love by the way that's a very\nunique answer and we've never had it on\nthe show\nthe reason why i love that is because a\nyou can do it anytime anywhere there's\nno way you can't do that\nand what i love about it more\nimportantly is that what you just said\nis\nyou're the first to do many things and\nthat's actually scary\nand it also means that you're not always\ngoing to get it right by other people's\nstandards\nand i think we have to learn to value\nthat when people are treading new paths\nand are disrupting\nthat there are going to be\nchanges and pivots and adapting that\nthat comes along the way yep and i think\nwe\nwe want innovation in the world but when\nsomeone tries to innovate and it's\nslightly different to what we expect\nwe're so quick to criticize or quick to\ntear someone down\nand actually that doesn't make any sense\nbecause that thing only got created\nbecause someone did something that was\nnever done before absolutely and so i\nthink we need to be we need to create\nmore space for people to try new things\nfor the first time\nbecause that's what takes the world\nforward at all could not have said it\nbetter myself no innovation and\ndisruption and you know those you're the\nfirst of many as well it is very\ndifficult to do there's a lot of\nobstacles and hurdles that come your way\na lot of people will never know about\nbut\ni\nenjoy being a disruptor and i enjoy\nencouraging people to think differently\nand i enjoy doing things in a different\nway i love that all right question\nnumber four\nis\nwhat did you once used to value that you\nno longer value\nthis is a little bit of a\ncomplex answer but yeah something i used\nto value\nis\na certain type of friendship\nand what i mean by that is\ni and i might be a little jaded by me\nbeing in the public eye to be honest but\ni used to only want to be friends with\npeople and i really valued the\nfriendships i had when people\nknew me before i got famous\ni really valued that connection of like\nthese are my childhood friends and they\nknow me and these are my true friends\nthat has really hindered me growing up\nbecause now i've been in the public eye\nfor 10 years and what is that where does\nthat leave me and it leaves me in a\nposition to never make new friendships\nagain right because inevitably the new\npeople i meet they're never gonna know\nme before 10 years ago\ni don't value that definition of\nfriendship anymore i value\nevolving that and and connecting with\npeople in different ways i've never have\nbefore hey i met this person i really\nfeel something menu is a perfect example\ni can consider one of my close good\nfriends you didn't know me before i was\nyou know lily on youtube and i didn't\nknow you before you were the jay shetty\nyou know and i think\nif i met you years and years ago i would\nhave probably dismissed our friendship\nbecause it would have been like just\nanother networking thing another work\nthing\ni i value that so differently now i\nunderstand that you can connect with\npeople in different ways and people can\nplay different roles in your life and\nit can still be magical and special yeah\nand i love hearing that because hey i\nvalue our friendship so much\nbut but i get that it's it is really\ninteresting to toy with that like i s\nthe person i speak to most\nevery week is the guy who's the best man\nat my wedding i speak to him like three\ntimes a week and we talk for an hour\nevery time and if someone told me where\ndo you find that time it's really weird\nbecause i'll find it in gaps he's always\nkindly available and will pick up and\nmake time for me and he's an\nentrepreneur too so he can be flexible\nand we'll just talk and we can talk for\nhours and it's easy because he's i've\nknown him for i've known him since i was\n18 so i've known him for nearly 17 years\nnow he's one of my closest he's my\nclosest friend\nand\nwhat i realize is history is important\nto me because there is something special\nabout when someone has history with you\nbut what i've realized that doesn't stop\nyou from creating new history exactly\nand new memories yes and that's what i\nfeel with you like when i look at my\ntime in covid\ni think of our time as we built so much\nhistory during covet together\nthat that's exciting to me because i\ndon't have that history with any of\nthose people because i wasn't there with\nthem and i think that's exactly correct\nand i'm not trying to discredit my child\nor friends no no when i go and hang on\nthe childhood friends it's special and\nwe have these memories\nbut i really did if i'm being honest\nstruggle with friendship when i moved to\nla because i was so attached to how that\nshould happen how friendship is supposed\nto be\nthat i\nwas my biggest obstacle when it came to\nmaking new connections yeah i love that\nwhat a great answer like what a great\nhonestly like i appreciate it because\nthat is such a\nwe again never had done the show and so\nyou know will you hire me am i hired\nhired am i hired am i hired\nwe'll give you an award yeah yeah yeah\nfifth place what does that award mean i\nknow what is it\nwhat is it the consequence of all right\nfifth and final question is\nand i'm so glad we didn't okay this from\ntoday\nthe fast five is officially being\nscrapped when i feel like it we have to\nfind a new name please steady tag us on\ninstagram and come up with a new name\nbecause i'm struggling all i'm doing\nright now is think of a new name what is\nthis thing\ni haven't got one okay so fifth and\nfinal question is\nuh if you could create one law or one\nhabit that everyone in the world had to\nfollow every day what would it be\nand take your time as well because every\ntime you take your time we get the best\nanswers so\nbreed be a triangle\nthat was lily's voice brother that\nwasn't me one word\none law or one habit yeah either either\nlaw as in something that people have to\nfollow or a habit people have to\npractice it's up to you\nsomething that i think\nis being lost\nin the universe today and perhaps it\ncould be jaded by my career in social\nmedia i don't know but something i feel\nis being lost in the world is\nthe value of\ncontext\ni feel like\na lot of conflict in the world a lot of\ntension in the world a lot of negativity\nin the world is because we don't value\ncontext anymore\nwe\njudge people very quickly we judge them\nfrom snippets online or things that they\nsaid like i said we don't appreciate\ntheir circumstances we don't even\nacknowledge that they might have\ndifferent circumstances from ours\ni think the world would be a better\nplace if\nit was mandatory to have context\nwhen you're speaking to someone when\nyou're putting something on twitter\nwhen you are\neven\ndebating and i think the reason the word\nlaw made me think of this is i think of\nhow many times\nin a courtroom\na decision or law has been passed about\na person or group of people\neven though\nthat person or group of people their\ncontext is nowhere in that room you know\ni think about how many people have made\nlaws about women's bodies and no woman\nwas part of that or like one woman out\nof 20 was part of that decision because\nthere's no context\ni think context is important and should\nbe valued and if you don't have that\nwhat are you actually talking about\nyou know\nlilly with the depth man wow these are\nlike i'm trying mind-blowing\nno no no\nno these are just\ni mean\nthese last three answers that you're\ngiven we've just gone in and obviously\ncompletely different direction to what\nwe're talking about but like\nthat's such an english that would be\nsuch an incredible law and habit mm-hmm\nthat if and i don't know how you would\nexecute it but that's for a different\ntime in place\njust the value of context because it\nseems to be\nan endangered\nconcept right now yeah i often i often\nfind the way i've been trying to do in\ncertain circumstances is and i'm sure\nyou get this a lot a lot of people ask\nme oh what's this person like and i'm\nsure you get that too because you've\ninterviewed some amazing people you\nyou're friends with incredible people\nand people what's this person really\nlike\nand what i've realized is that that\nanswer can be so\ncomplex\nand again out of context\nbecause it's so easy to say oh yeah i\njust bumped into them in an elevator and\nthey were really rude and just in care\nthey're a rude person and what you just\nsaid it's like well that's just one tiny\nminuscule experience all that\nexperiences me saying oh they're the\nsweetest nicest person in the world\nagain it's a very subjective experience\nand the point is that\nwithout context that answer can be so\nmisconstrued and that's just one example\nand i've realized for me practically\nit's just saying something along the\nlines of like this has been my\nexperience yeah and being able to\ncontextualize by saying this is my\nrelationship with that person and this\nis my experience with that person that's\nall i can give you i think even hearing\nsomeone say in my experience\ni think why i love that is because then\nsomeone listening doesn't really have\nthe right to say well no yeah well\nthat's not no because again context yeah\nis again we all have our own experiences\nand we need to understand that everyone\nhas their own experiences i love that\neveryone lilly sing be a triangle how i\nwent from being lost to getting my life\ninto shape is available right now we\nhave the link in every bio caption\ncomment wherever you can get it
