no\nprofessional introduction\nbig sean people have been waiting crying\nasking for this yeah and you've been so\ngenerous and kind we've been talking\nabout this ever since we did the first\nepisode yeah we needed to do part two\nit's been like on our it's been on our\nto-do list you know absolutely and we're\ndoing it and i just i i just want to let\npeople know like off screen like you\nknow i knew you were deep\nbefore you came to the show last time i\nknew that you were a deep thinker you\nworked on yourself you have this\nincredible relationship with your mom\nwho's influenced you so deeply yeah but\ni didn't realize just how much of a\nbrotherhood we were gonna have right and\nwhat a connection we were gonna have\nright right and i didn't realize how\nmuch people were gonna love seeing us\ntogether when i saw the response and you\nforward too right yeah of course i felt\nit like\nthe people who are into me were just\nyou know blown like the interview the\nwhole interview it's the only interview\nthat i've been out in public and people\nlike yo i saw the uh the jay shetty\ninterview like i saw i heard the\ninterview i saw the podcast\nlike\nliterally\nevery other time i go somewhere you know\nsomebody approaches me like that so the\nimpact is\nunbelievable you know that's what we do\nit for right and since i came and linked\nup with you we've had dinner at your\nhouse and me you janae your wife we all\njust been like kicking it so it's cool\nto it's cool to deliver part two i feel\nlike it's needed and necessary you know\nyeah and part two means there'll be a\npart three and a part four\nthere's no no limit but yeah yeah i want\nto thank you for just you know saying\nthat because even your community that i\ngot to connect with because of the show\nyeah for sure your fans and your\naudience are incredible like i just saw\nthis\nwhole new group of people connect with\nmy work because of you through you yeah\nand vice versa too yeah and i was just\nlike i didn't realize that all these\npeople would would care about the things\ni'm talking about and so i want to thank\nyou i want to thank your community i\nwant to thank your audience who just\nshowed me so much love who they may not\nhave even known who i was but thanks to\nyou they're on a mission\nto be better you know yeah they're on a\nmission to work on themselves and the\nwhole world is going through so much\nright now it's crazy you know so\nthat's one of the things i've been\nfocusing on i just been like really\nfocusing on\nmastering myself more still putting time\ninto myself just trying to be\nthe silence and still in amongst the the\nnoise and the chaos and then when things\nare still and stagnant to know when it's\ntime to move you know really trying to\nfind that balance it's like\nthe yin and yang and how there's like a\nlittle dot of each in the parts of the\nyin yang it's like that's what my life\nis trying to been like trying to be the\nstillness in the chaos and the movement\nand trying to be the movement in the um\nstagnation of things you know i love\nthat trying to be the stillness in the\nmovement\nand trying to be the movement in the\nstillness and are you saying external or\ninternal like how how are you learning\nto watch that as well it's both right so\nit's like the external and the internal\nare so connected right so i just have\nbeen\nrealizing that it most of the things\nthat are external start internally right\nso that's what i use it starts with\ninternal that's why i start my day with\nmeditation you know and the fact that we\nwent through so many meditations last\ntime we we met up\nman that was so helpful because i\nlearned\ni meditate every morning and i like to\nask you like what does meditation do for\nyou like when you do it yes what does it\ndo for you there's this as we did last\ntime so\ni'm trying to figure out which ones\neveryone's gonna see first but either\nway yeah uh big sean and i did a\nbrilliant man's health collab\nto talk about the power of wellness and\nmeditation right it was historic because\nit was the first time men's health\nare doing a train like me but based on\nmeditation yeah ever yeah it's always\nbeen physical right so me and you guys\nit's so cool we're going to do it\ntogether it's awesome crazy and so i\nlove that and you know we worked on that\ntogether\nand i have three different types of\nmeditation so one type of meditation\nbreath work is for my body yeah so if\ni'm feeling like my body's tired or i'm\nfeeling like my body needs energy or my\nbody needs to relax i practice breath\nwork yeah i then do visualization so if\ni'm going into a scenario that causes me\nanxiety or fear\ni will visualize not the perfect\noutcome but the perfect process\nso i'll visualize myself doing that\nprocess so for example if i'm about to\nspeak on stage to thousands of people i\nwon't visualize people clapping and\nthinking you're amazing i'll visualize\nmyself\nwalking up those steps onto stage\nwalking back and forth on stage looking\nat the audience in their eyes connecting\nwith them connecting with people and\ntheir hearts and souls so i'll visualize\nthat it's important it's so important\nand then the third type of meditation i\ndo is mantra\nand mantra to me is what connects me to\nthe universe connects me to god connects\nme to my soul it's what connects me to\nmy service to the world and so mantra is\nmy third so i practice all three every\nmorning wow and each of them give me a\ndifferent\npractice and different benefit that i\nneed it for if that makes sense yeah it\nmakes total sense yeah i change my\nmeditations up frequently from\ni do mantra meditation sometimes and\nsometimes i do just guided meditations\nthat are specifically for me maybe for\nthat week things i'm really like\nnot necessarily trying to accomplish but\nthings that i put in my consciousness\nthings that i want to approach\nuh right but more importantly it just\ngets me right for the day man it's like\nlike i said it's like taking a shower\nlike after you work out and you take\nthat shower and you feeling fresh like\nthat's what it does for my consciousness\nmy\nenergy and things just flow better you\nknow what i'm saying i feel like i'm\nliterally lifting my vibration up\nto a higher place of like just to be\nsuccessful you know what i mean and it\nall starts right there for me\nyou can't do it in right or wrong way\nthere's no there is no right or wrong in\ndoing it the fact you take the time out\nto just uh be with yourself to breathe\nyour mind is gonna race all over the\nplace sometimes sometimes it doesn't\nsometimes it does you bring it back to\nyour breath you bring it back to\nmaybe whatever you're listening to and\njust the fact that you take that time\nout to breathe and to spend that time on\nyourself you're gonna feel an incredible\ndifference every time it's like a menu\nyeah in the sense of when you go to eat\nat a restaurant you don't want to eat\nthe same thing every day right so one\nday you're feeling like i need a little\nbit of this so one day you need a little\nbit of that and so\ni think we have to look at meditation\nit's like okay well maybe i need to do\nan anxiety meditation yeah or maybe i\nneed to do a connection or a forgiveness\nmeditation today yeah and empathy and i\nthink we're living at a time right now\nwhere you can choose whether you're on\nyoutube or spotify or wherever you are\nright janae has some phenomenal\nmeditations yes mantras and meditations\nyeah we actually just did one where we\ni led a meditation and she was um sound\nhealing at the same time it was like an\nexperience i haven't seen that i know\nyou know it was our first time doing it\nso we were trying it out but\nit's something that\nyou know we wanted to just test out and\ntry and people really enjoyed it and\nbenefited from it but\nthere's so many different ways of\ngetting that energy out there right like\nthat right so yeah there is no right or\nwrong way to do it it's just\nyou know i realized that to\nit's the richest thing you could do for\nyourself you know what i mean and when i\nsay that word rich\ni don't just mean it like money right\nbecause\nyou could be rich in a lot of ways and\ni've\nexperienced people who are rich in money\nand still broke\nin a lot of ways broke meaning broken\nright\nbut to me\nthe richest thing you could do for\nyourself is to\nnot only just make yourself a priority\nbut to take that time out to be in the\nbest position you can be in right and to\nnot be so caught up on what you want\njust to kind of put the attention out\nthere because\nwhen you're so caught up on what you\nwant it's so specific onto something\nright it's like i want this new blue mug\ni want this new blue mug\nbut at the same time you're holding that\nvision of that new blue mug it could be\na a green mug a yellow mug a gold mug\nthat's sitting there waiting for you\nthat's just as good or even better than\nthis mug but you are you're closing out\nall those possibilities so it's\nimportant to\nyou know one of the things i do is i\ndon't get so specific with my\nmeditations i just kind of say\nfor the greater\nfor whatever is best for me or what's\nthe greatest you know for my happiness\nfor my joy because that's where the real\nrichness is you know what i'm saying\nwe've seen\npeople who have all the money in the\nworld who have\ncommitted suicide right or you know the\nlead singers or groups you know you talk\nabout chester\nyou know we talk about um anthony\nbourdain all these different people who\nyou know from the outside looking in you\nwould never guess you know what i mean\nthat they're going through something and\neverybody is going through something you\nknow that's important as a society that\nremember everybody is going through\nsomething we talk like\nwe don't uh\ncare what people are going through or\nlike you know they're not going through\nsomething everyone's going through\nsomething\nreally really important right now that's\nreally could be really really hard\nand even if they show it or not and uh\ni think that when you when you take the\ntime to create a rich life for yourself\nuh that is the best thing you could do\nbecause when you take time to work on\nyour\nintern or your external it kind of takes\nthe focus off trying to\ntrying to worry or have anxiety about\nthe things you can't change\nand realizing that the things you can't\nchange can't change you\nyou know so you get to that you get to\nthat that that point\nof uh\nbeing able to go through anything it's\nlike having armor on you know you're\ngoing through the storm or having like\nlayers on it's like they can't even get\nto you for real every time i hear your\ntalk i shouldn't be surprised that you\njust constantly drop bars because that's\nwhat you do but literally they were like\nthey're like seven things you just said\nthat i want to like piece apart yeah one\nof the things that i think you just\nmentioned which was so powerful was just\nyou're like i don't i'm not i don't get\nspecific yeah\nand i love that i think that's actually\nsuch a fascinating thing because i think\nso much of what we're told today is be\nspecific about what you want be really\nspecific about it and the challenge is\nwhen you get too specific into that\nextreme yeah then you can't see\nwhat's right there in front of you that\ncould be better it could be a different\nway and i've always thought of it as\nlike you have a projector screen in your\nhead which is your imagination of what\nit should look like right and then you\nhave reality happening here\nand you keep looking for this projection\nand you miss out like you said on the on\nthe thing that's right there and so yeah\ni love the idea of not being specific\nbecause it releases you\nfrom your own\ninsignificant goal yeah it does right it\nreleases you if i if i got everything i\never asked for\ni wouldn't be here today no because my\ngoals were way too small my ideas were\nway too small yeah and the universe and\ngod and\nenergy had way bigger plans for me than\ni had for myself i actually saw the\ninterview you did with lauren london and\nshe was talking about surrendering to\nthe universe you do you have to\nsurrender\nand you have to realize that yeah okay\nand if you are specific well then just\nalways make sure in that you know\nspecification that you put and more or\nand i'm open to whatever possibilities\nare are also available or\nwhat other you know options there are\nyou know if you are specific because\nwe can be specific somewhat but it you\ncan't just be too specific and leave it\nthere like you were talking about you\nknow you could say hey i want to have\nthe number one podcast for\nyou know that talks about mental health\nand all these things right but you know\nthis this the specification of that it's\neven bigger than that yeah you know what\ni mean\nyour show everything you do is way\nbigger than that you know and it's uh\nbut you're open to all of those\nexpansive options\nso i just hope people realize that like\nwhatever you want in life first of all\nwanting something is acknowledging the\nlack of it right so\nremember in our last interview i talked\nabout god gives you what you asked for\nso you have to really understand that\nit's you know\ni kind of don't say i want anything\nanymore i don't say that anymore i say\ni desire or my intention you know i\ndon't say i want it because i'm just\nacknowledging over and over that i don't\nhave it\nand i i don't want to match that\nvibration i'm not having it anymore so\ninstead it's\nyou know this is my intention my desire\nand i put myself vibrationally on that\nfrequency of already having happening\nalready being there\nand that for me works\nyou know i don't know if that's works\nfor everyone else but\nyou know try it if if life isn't\nuh going exactly how you want it to go\nwhich you know\nis 99 of us in this world try it that\nway that's powerful for me that hit\nright there because\ni've heard people talk about what want\nmeans before but the way you explained\nit\nwhen you want something it often can\nremove gratitude and that doesn't stop\nyou from desiring and that's what i love\nwhat you said you say i desire i intend\nor my intention is it's not that you\ndon't want to pursue\nor grow or evolve it's just that the\nword want\nas you correctly said makes it feel like\nalmost a sense of ingratitude for what\nyou have that's right and the lack of it\nstarts eating away where you're chasing\nnow versus pursuing i think of the\ndifference between the word chase\nand pursue there's a difference chase\nfeels desperate it feels\nlike fleeting it feels like if i don't\nhave it i'm incomplete yeah like i want\nthis yeah i'm chasing this it's like\nokay like get i get that and you know\nespecially in the industries we're in\nit's like yeah it's great to have that\nhunger you know it is good to have that\nbut\nit's never cool to just be desperate\nlike it's kind of like just always like\nuh realize those small things can make a\nbig difference especially when you're\nwhen you're manifesting something you\nknow yeah i think that's great advice on\nmanifestation i think that's really\npowerful and i liked what you said\nabout i like what you said about\ngratitude though yeah yeah tell me how\nimportant that is to you like how how\noften do you practice like gratitude\nbecause i wake up every morning and i'm\nlike\nthank you man thank you guys like while\ni'm still half asleep you know what i\nmean because\nbro like we're on the blessed side of\nthe spectrum just the fact that we get\nto wake up yeah i think gratitude is a\ndaily multiple times a day practice\nfor absolutely everything i was saying\nearlier today to someone\nthat\nif something went wrong today\ni would tell everyone about it\nbut if something went right today right\nprobably wouldn't tell anyone about it\nright right like so if if everything in\nmy schedule went to plan\nno one would hear about it but\neverything in my schedule went not to\nplan i would tell everyone oh my gosh my\nflight got delayed\nand then i like missed eating my lunch\nand then i was late for this and i would\ntell everyone about it and what does\nthat mean yeah what does that mean it\nmeans that we are not noticing the\ngreatness and the gifts in our life when\neverything goes to plan and we don't\nshare that you never go to someone i was\namazing everything went to plan like\neverything like you wouldn't you\nwouldn't say oh my flight was on time\nthat's amazing we expect\nwe expect things to happen\nwell\nand when you expect something to happen\nwell you stop feeling gratitude for it\nyou start feeling like well actually i'm\nreally fortunate that this happened on\ntime yeah and it makes it more\npleasurable right absolutely when you\ngot that gratitude and you you know you\nfeel just better about it like yeah man\nlike yeah and and i think also gratitude\nfor\neverything from the smallest things like\nto me\nsomething i practiced with my wife\nthat's\nit came naturally and now i see it being\nbeneficial but if she's like helping me\nout with something or she does the\ntiniest thing\nbeing able to be grateful for that\nrather than thinking oh well you're my\nwife i expect you to do that right i\njust think the word expectation and the\nidea of expectations create a really\nunhealthy relationship with ourselves\nand with others\nright\nyeah setting expectations that's like\nthe recipe for disaster right there it's\nlike\nyou know you got to just\nfirst of all the gratitude and letting\nsomebody know that they're i i that's\nwhy every every almost i think every\nnight at least that i can remember every\nnight that i work when i'm in a studio\nworking with people i always tell my\nengineer like man you did a great job i\nlove great work and you know you could\njust see that they're wanting to keep\ndoing a great job everyone who works\nwith me like you mean you're doing a\ngreat job like\nand not from just like my managers and\neveryone down to my assistant to every\nperson who's involved in my life to my\nfamily members my friends i'd be like\nman you're doing a great job gotta keep\nit up and it just is it's great to\nand i mean it too i'm not just saying it\nbecause it's just saying i mean it if i\ndidn't if i didn't think they were doing\na great job i wouldn't say that you know\ni would just be like do better\nbut\nbut when they do a great job you have to\nrecognize that and not set yourself up\nfor expectations because that's a recipe\nfor disaster man it's like expecting\nanything out of life\nyou know even expecting to wake up it's\nlike you can't even expect that that\ndoesn't happen to everyone yeah you know\nso\nuh that's one of the one i read the book\nthe four agreements and that's one of\nthem uh i think one of them was to not\nhave expectations or something like that\nyeah yeah i feel like also what you just\nsaid\nwhatever you recognize in someone\nthey'll repeat it\nand it took me a long time to realize\nthat if i make someone feel bad for\nsomething they don't do well\nthey actually get scared to try and do\nit right right if you make someone feel\nguilty oh yeah\nfor something\nthey actually get more scared so i used\nto do this my wife's the best example\nwhere i got this wrong for a long time\nwhen my wife didn't understand how to\nyou know what i wanted for my birthday\nor something like that\nand i would feel this is years ago when\nwe were dating\nlike i don't know maybe like eight years\nago or something okay and i would\ntell her like you don't you don't get me\nlike you don't understand me like that's\nnot what i wanted and i realized that's\nharsh man\nso bad man so bad but i always thought\nthat if i said that then hopefully she\nwould change and she would get it about\nhow serious it is yeah\nand then she told me years later that\nthat just made her more scared and\nfearful\nto try and get me a gift on my birthday\nwow because she just felt she got it\nwrong all the time and so we think that\nif we keep telling people they're\ngetting it wrong then they'll get it\nright\nno that doesn't work if you don't take\nthe time to explain and to actually\ncommunicate communicate and articulate\nwhat you really are looking for and why\nand where that comes from if you don't\ndo that work you can't expect someone to\nread your mind and understand you no you\ncan we expect that so much from our\npartners right now relationships and\neveryone we get attitudes with them and\nit's just like like you said\nthey don't know what you're going\nthrough you don't know what they're\ngoing through and on top of that\nwe're all just doing our best out here\nman like when you if you honestly ask me\nlike\nthat's that's usually my answer for\nalmost like how have you been doing this\nlike i'm doing my best you know and we\nall are doing our best in these times\nright the world is going through so many\nthings at once\nyou know i was talking a side guru and\nhe was telling me about how\nthe soil is so\nmessed up nowadays you know like we're\ngetting 40\nof\nthe the amount of food that uh the\namount of nutrition we used to get from\nfood is\nwe get only get 40 of that now because\nof the soil has not been replenished\nright and that\nyou know the population has gone from 4\nbillion to 8 billion people from 1960 to\nnow or 9 billion now and soon it's going\nto go from 9 billion to\n13 billion in you know the next\n30 something 40 years\nand they're saying that at that point if\nwe don't replenish the soil\nand take care of the oceans and many\nother things that the famine is going to\nbe\nnot only at a\na crazy crazy level we've never seen but\nit's\nyou know food won't even be available\nwow and\nor or affordable and\nyou know i was i was asking him like man\nhow do we like\nhow do we replenish the soil and one of\nthe things there's a lot of ways that\nyou know i can talk about that another\ntime but one of the things i was\nthinking he was saying that you know as\nhumans we're supposed to go back into\nthe earth\nmother nature mother earth we're\nsupposed to go back into and replenish\nthe soil you know and enrich the soil\nand i was thinking how sometimes we uh\nlike you know how we have like caskets\nand we like fill our fill our bodies our\nshells with uh you know whatever it is\nthe chemical to make us last forever but\nit's like we're never gonna dig each\nwe're never gonna dig i'm never gonna\ndig my grandfather up from his grave\nit's like i\nhe needs to be replenished back into the\nearth because if you think about it\nthat's just polluting\nthe earth at that point that's almost\nlike trash on the ground when you and no\ndisrespect you know i don't mean that in\nany disrespectful way i just mean in a\nscientific way it's kind of like a\nmatter that doesn't dispose you know i'm\nnot trying to uh i get what you're\nsaying you see what you see what i'm\nsaying because it is a very sensitive\nthing you know to talk about my\nrelatives or even my grandfather who i\nlove very much but what i'm saying is it\nwould have meant just as much as he\nwould have disposed back and became part\nof the soil and the earth you know what\ni mean\nuh and that's something to really pay\nattention to as the population grows and\nthe space gets smaller and smaller and\nwe need to build more and more\ndevelopments over the soil that we\nreally need to be feeding ourselves and\ntaking care of the earth with you know\nwhat i mean yeah yeah so that's that's\nsomething that\nthe earth is just going that's another\nthing that is going through aside from\nthe world\nyou know the possible world wars that\ncould be upon us and besides from all\nthe conflict and the\nyou know uh all these borders and just\ncountries where slavery is still going\non and\nplaces is just you know a\na crazy amount of uh problems on this\nlist that you know that the world is\ngoing through and\nwe just have to like really really boss\nup and be our best selves and\nyou know take care of ourselves to uh\npresent our greatest version to the\nworld you know to help out any way we\ncan yeah that's why this is so important\nyeah how how do you process that i'm\nintrigued because i i grapple with that\na lot as well that exactly what you just\nsaid you look around the world\nwhether it's poverty\nracism war potential famine\nlike you're just seeing all of this and\ni think a lot of people look at all of\nthat\nand they get really overwhelmed they do\nand then they feel\nhelpless and these are good people these\nare people who care of course they're\nempathetic people of course but then\nwhen they see all this they just feel\nhelpless and they feel\nconfused and they feel disheartened\nand then they don't know what to do or\nhow to help and then they feel paralyzed\nso in that situation\nhow do you process this or how do you\nthink about getting involved because the\nway i think about it\nis i realize that\nworking on myself as you rightly said\nthat's not going to solve it but it\nhelps me bring my best to this situation\n100 percent right like if i'm in a mess\nmy start and it starts there to me\nstarts there yeah it's like if i'm gonna\nmess myself how can i remove any mess\nthe way it was explained when i lived as\na monk is that if we ourselves are not\ntrying to be purified who are we to help\ncleanse anything right so how can you\ncleanse something externally if you're\nnot purifying yourself internally it's\nnot not possible but then when you do\nthat the whole goal of working on\nyourself and i think this is what's off\nthe mist the whole point of self-care\nis service\nthe whole point of internal purification\nis to help detox and cleanse externally\nright that to me the whole purpose of\nself-care\nis the complete opposite of being\nselfish\nyou know it's um it's actually like you\nsaid a service to the world so when you\nare overwhelmed with all the anxiety of\neverything that's going on you're\noverwhelmed with\nyour you know your personal problems and\nthe world's problems and just things\nseem to be too much we all go through\nthis\nit is the most important thing to\nrely on the faith that everything is\ngoing to be okay\nyou know and when you put your best foot\nforward when you do take care of the the\nextra steps to take care of yourself to\nbring your best foot forward you realize\nlike we talked about last time\nthat the faith\nthat you know the reason that we're in\nthis moment in the first place is\nbecause we have the ability\nto change this moment the great part\nabout being in any situation whether\nyou're up or down in life is that it's a\namazing opportunity\nand you have the ability to change every\nsituation right so\nyou know when you have that faith like i\ntalked about that invisible bridge when\nyou have that faith that you can just\nwalk across and you don't really see how\nyou're going to get across but you know\nit's there and you step on that off that\ncliff and on to the to where you don't\nsee anything and you still haven't\nfallen that's what faith is and that's\nwhat we have to\nhave in each other as a society and\nrealize that the the more conscious we\nare the more we work on ourselves\nthe the more steps we're taking to get\nto the to the other side of things you\nknow what i mean yeah and how do you\nthink how do you develop that because\nwhen i saw your face describing the the\nfaith and the invisible breath and the\nsteps\nwhen i watch you describe that i can see\nthat it's realized yeah it's it's a\nrealization for you this isn't just some\nidea or something you read in a book or\nit's it's realized how did you develop\nthat faith\nover the years\nbecause it was a step-by-step process\nin being able to see that because\ni think a lot of people\nif you try and fake that faith\nit doesn't work it can't work it doesn't\nwork and if you try and avoid that faith\nthat doesn't work because you need to\nhave something like there was a amazing\nstudy i read recently and they said that\npeople who are involved\nin wars and stuck in trenches and stuck\nin the most difficult\nsituations known to humanity\nwhen they had false hope\nand this is hope not faith when they had\nfalse hope right\nthey actually felt more dejected\nso if they had the false hope that we'll\nbe back by christmas\nand they didn't get back by christmas\nthat would break their resolve\nbut if they believed\nwe won't get back by christmas\nbut we will get back\nthat\nallowed them to have faith to actually\nmove forward that simple shift of not\nputting a timeline not putting a\ndeadline not having false hope\nbut having that long-term faith so i\nwonder how do you how did you develop\nthat because i think that's something\nthat's not talked about enough is how is\nit developed\nyeah i know it's a lot yeah\nthrough life through experiences through\nsetting deadlines setting expectations\nfor myself and not\nrealizing them from\nmy worst fears\nwhat i thought was my worst fear things\nthat i would never ever be able to\nyou know\nuh recover from right or bounce back\nfrom it's like these things\nwhen they even happen you realize that\nokay i\nin the first place\nshould never\nuh be mad at a timeline because how can\ni be mad at a timeline or something not\ngetting done or a deadline when i'm on\ngod's when i'm moving at god's speed\ni'm not moving at my speed\ni can set my intention i can give my\nattention to that intention of hopefully\ngetting something done to make it done\nearlier i may want to finish something\nby april and it might get done in\nfebruary\nyou know i may want to get something\ndone in april it won't be done until\nnext april who knows because it's\nunknown but when we embrace that unknown\nwhich a lot of us is hard to do because\nyou know we always like to think about\nwhat's the worst that could happen\ninstead of what's the best that can\nhappen i had to change my whole mindset\nto think\nokay what's the best that could happen\nyou know because i don't even want to\nattract what's the worst that could\nhappen that's like such a normal saying\nthat i'm like\nthat saying is whack i had to switch i\nhad to flip it over to what's the best\nthat could happen you know what i mean\nbecause\ni have a hundred percent faith\njust the fact that we wake up every day\nthat everything is gonna be all right\nyeah you know just\nyou know and and get down to just the\nsimplest things i like i love how you\ntalk about breathing\nbecause you realize how much of a\npleasure it is to to breathe if you hold\nyour breath\nand don't breathe for you know i can\nhold my breath for like a minute and a\nhalf and you don't breathe and then when\nyou breathe\nand exhale inhale you realize how much\nof a pleasure it is for real to even\njust be on be here today breathing yeah\nyou know what i mean so what sad yeah\nit's just we would choose to breathe\nover anything if you had to be forced to\nchoose right right because everything\nelse would not be an experience if you\ncouldn't breathe yeah right that's not\npromise breath is in promise right yeah\nyour lungs could shut down the the earth\nthe environment could change at any\nmoment you know something a natural\ncatastrophe or disaster could happen and\nthat could be immediately taken away\nfrom us recently i was reading from\ni was reading from victor frankl's man\nsearch for meaning again\nand\ni think it's called 12 gifts for life\nby edith eager so they both survived the\nholocaust\nand i was reading that because of what's\nhappening in the world\nand to me at this time\nwhen the world's going through these\nthings\nthe only people i can turn towards\nare the people who've lived through it\nright i often think that those are the\npeople that can guide us the deepest\nyeah and so when people ask me for my\nguidance at these times\ni go let's look at these people's\nguidance yeah because they were actually\nthere\nlike edith and victor talk about\nthem being in\nthe concentration camps\nseeing people dragged\nseeing children abused\nlike this is all happening around them\nand edith eager said something that i\nthink you'll appreciate so much\nshe said i realized\nand i had to realize that i wasn't the\nprisoner\nbut the gods were the prisoners of their\nown conscience\nand she goes when i realized that i\nwasn't imprisoned the people who were\nbeing imprisoned by their hatred\nand imprisoned by their own pain and\nimprisoned by their desire to dominate\nand control and to abuse people\nthat's the real prison\ni was free\nlike you hear someone say that going\nthrough the most atrocious\nhorrendous thing they could possibly go\nthrough but that was her mindset she's\nstill living she survived and what a\ncrazy thing to survive through right and\nto have that perspective and she was\nsaying that it was that perspective it's\nwhat you're saying\nthat in that moment she had to rewire\nhow she saw what was going on so that\nshe could get through it yeah if she\njust accepted it for what it was she\nsaid she would have lost that resolve\nthat's one of those lessons only life\ncan teach you right\nshe was she that's one of those lessons\nlike we go through these things and he\nis that\nthere's no other way to uh\ni just hope that people realize when\nthey go through things it doesn't have\nto be such a traumatic experience or\nsuch a\ndetrimental thing or such a you know uh\nimmeasurable loss or anything\nit's you know the fact that you're able\nto survive through the day\nyou know there was somebody who got\nmurdered around the corner from\nin the neighborhood i live in and i'm\njust like oh you're saying actually like\nright yeah like yesterday wow yeah like\nin the same neighborhood and nice\nneighborhood but my point is is that\nwe take for granted how much of a\nblessing it is to\nbe here right now and to wake up and be\nhere you know what i mean\nso you know we we learn these lessons\nand i just hope that we can pay\nattention to the lessons that life\nteaches us\nyou know because you have to really make\na mental\nyou have to really\nacknowledge what you're experiencing\nor else it just goes in one ear and out\nthe other totally you have to learn the\nlesson you know\nand even that story you told me she\nlearned that lesson while she was in\nthat concentration camp in the holocaust\nshe learned that okay\nyou're actually the prisoner because\nyou're trapped in your con your prison\nof your consciousness and you know if\nyou wanting to dominate another person\nand trap another person\nthat is already a prison\nyou know i'm in here i'm in a cage but\ni'm the one who's free-minded and free\nthinking and\nyou know has faith that i'm gonna get\npast this and told two totally different\nexperiences\nright\nso\njust embrace the experience that you're\ngoing through and realize it and you\nknow we got to\nwe're leasing these bodies for a limited\ntime only right like our experience here\nis very very limited so\nwe got to we have to make something you\nknow we can't just sit around and watch\nother people live their lives we got to\ngo out and figure out what that means\nfor us\nyou know and how you do that is you do\ndo the work on yourself a lot of people\nmay be watching this and may not know\nwhat they want to do they don't know\nwhat they're passionate about maybe they\njust like being on the internet all day\nmaybe they just like watching movies and\ntv all day\nbut you know you can't figure out\nexactly what you're all the way\npassionate about until you actually try\nthings try things out i had to try\nthings myself because i didn't really\nknow what i was passionate about besides\nmusic i had to go jump out of a plane i\nhad to like try new things start working\nout i had to you know do hikes and be\nlike i really like hiking like i really\nlike this you know what i'm saying and\nyou know i think that's one of the\nthings uh one of the quickest escapes\npeople can go to is like drugs right\nit's like an instant escape and a way to\nget high\nbut man there's so many other ways to\nget high you know what i'm saying in\nlife without without using that and i'm\nnot even a sound like you know inspire\nyou know\ncorny or whatever whatever people may\nthink that sounds but it's like there\nare a lot of ways\nyou know to that i've been high off life\nthat a drug could never give me you know\nwhat i'm saying like the type of high\nthat is like\ngod-given that only the universe can\nprovide yeah you know that's so that's\nthe best that's the best high it's so\nwell sure\nyou know it's in the scriptures it's\ncalled the higher taste yeah like the\nidea that when you\nit's almost like when you look at a\nchild\nif you give a child a popsicle the child\nwill want that yeah and if you try and\ngive a child a diamond\nor a million dollar investment\nthey won't understand it yeah and\nthey'll be like i'd rather have this\npopsicle yeah but then when that child\ngets older and matures\nthey go oh\nthat investment or that thing could have\nbeen more valuable and so what we see as\na valuable experience changes as we\nmature\nand it's what you said about experiences\nis so true\nuh radhi and i recently we try and do\nsomething every month that we do that's\nrandom that we wouldn't expect to do so\nrecently we went to a rage room yeah and\ni had no desire what's that like so a\nrage room they give you baseball bats\nand lead pipes\nand you smash stuff up yeah and so we\nwent to that and me and riley are both\nnot angry people like we're not\naggressive people right in general but\nwe were like we have to go experiment\nbecause if we don't experiment how do\nyou know right you got to go check it\nout\nso\nwas it fun it was hilarious to watch us\nbecause we were both like you know we\nwere both like not violent people yeah\nand so we're struggling then we realized\nsomething really interesting they told\nme afterwards i wish they told me before\nthey said if you go there\nand you're stressed out because your\nboyfriend broke up with you\nor someone's been rude to you or you've\nbeen offended\nthen it will de-stress you\nbut if you go there when you're not\nstressed the research shows that you\nleave stressed so that was me and my\nwife\nnot stressed and we left with stress\nlike it was actually stressful wow to\ncause rage when you don't feel anything\nand so but so that was an experience\nthat didn't go well right right but you\ngot to try it but that's okay you got to\ntry it yeah and so and you and the fact\nthat you two were together it probably\njust it's something that you'll always\nremember right yeah so in hindsight it\nprobably was a pleasurable experience\nexactly funny story now yeah we get to\ntell and be like we did this thing it\ndidn't work out but i think that's what\nyou're saying that\nwe have to just experience more and\nexperiment more\nrather than turn to the obvious things\nthat we've seen over society like as you\nsaid like drugs and alcohol or any of\nthese things that can become\npainful in the long run\nas opposed to what you said hey whether\nit's going for a hike or whether it's\ndoing this thing or that thing or\nwhatever it may be so i think that's\nthat's just really simple practical\nadvice that anyone can follow yeah and\nyou know\nand i'm not judging anybody who does\nthat too you know because\nhow do we have that's one thing i want\npeople to remember too like we don't\nhave the right to judge anybody going\nthrough anything when we sit up and\njudge each other all day on social media\nor in real life too and\nyou know that's uh\nyou know i want to tie that back to\nanother thing that i was talking about\nbecause everyone is going through\nsomething you never know right but\nthat's not even a it's a it's a very\nconditional thing to try and keep up a\nimage or a\nfacade right and\nuh\nyou know even like money is such a\nconditional thing like that's why when i\nsay rich\nyeah you could be rich in money but it's\nconditional right so when that money\ngoes you're not even rich anymore it's\nlike if you took all the money away from\nme or any or anyone around me or my\nfamily we are at a point where we we\nwere rich before we had money you know\nwhat i'm saying because\nof the the the rich practices that we\nwere taught you know which is you know\nto take care of your you know to take\ncare of yourself early on which is a\nlesson that i kind of put on the back\nburner and went through and experienced\nlife and life was hit me and beat me up\nand i had to take a step back and\nreaffirm uh the things that i already\nknew but really strengthen them up you\nknow what i mean and that that is\nthat is being rich for real you know\nbecause money is conditional and that's\nthe energy we've assigned it it's the\ncurrency of uh\nyou know our uh\ni guess you could say just our countries\nare are living the way we live but\nreally you know time is like the\ncurrency of our\nuh\nuniverse you know and love is like the\ncurrency\nof all you know love is every love is\ngod right so\ni know i'm kind of rambling no you're\nnot a tool yeah that resonates man yeah\ni just want people to get that though\nman because it's like\ntrying not to judge you just wasting\nwhen you judging somebody else you're\nreally just wasting your time yeah\nyou're really just giving somebody else\nyour energy that's so valuable\nyou could be building something you'd be\nbuilding a mountain with that energy you\ncould be building a mountain or a future\nor a career or something else and\ninstead you're really worried about\nsomebody else or tearing somebody else\ndown\nand that just it just doesn't make sense\nit's so easy to do though it's so easy\nyeah for a lot of people it gives you a\nquick boost it gives you a question\nmaking you feel good in the moment yeah\nit does because i think it makes people\nfeel good in the moment or you know who\ni can't speak for people but i think\nwe can get obsessed with validation and\nlike retweets or like a lot of likes or\nlike getting a reaction or getting\nattention but\nyou know one of the things that i've\nrealized is that people kind of put\nmorals to the side you know they will\nliterally leak\nsomething of you as very private it\ncould be a nude it could be a thing it\ncould be something and they put all the\nmorals aside and be like oh this is\ngoing to get a lot of attention so i'm\ngoing to put it out i don't care where\nhe's going it doesn't matter what he's\ngoing through like\nyou know but really and i'm not just\nspeaking about me i'm talking about\nanyone like that person could be going\nthrough\nit could be on the edge and that pushes\nhim over the edge you never know so just\nalways keep that in mind like that's you\ndon't don't like it's okay to you know\nwant a lot of retweets and want a lot of\nlove and likes and stuff we all you know\nwe all do that we're\nwe're professionals so yeah when we\ntouch and communicate with a lot of\npeople and people show love that's great\nbut\ni just wanted to pray i want to\nprioritize that you know at least i do\nand realize that my morals come first\nthough yeah you know what i mean and and\nnot and what you just said is making\nsure that whatever we're doing is not at\nthe expense of someone else you know\nwhat i mean so you want to act in a way\nthat doesn't cost anyone else anything\nexactly right you don't want that's\nexactly what i was trying to say yeah\nyou don't want to make someone pay for\nwhat you behave as\nright you'd never want that and because\nnone of us want to be in that situation\nno and i think that's what we we\ndisconnect with and one of the things i\nhad to learn\nis to learn to stop judging people\nwho judge others yeah so i had the\njudgment of people who judge and i'd be\nlike well you should stop judging and\ni'm like wait but that is a judgment\nthat's a judgment like that's a judgment\nand so\nit's like okay well well let me meet\nthat person with compassion and\nunderstanding yeah\nwe understand it because i do it yeah\nyeah and we can't judge we only have to\nlike\nyou know at least i i can only speak for\nmyself like i i've learned to just stop\njudging people and realize we're all\nhumans if we weren't\nhere to learn something or we were\nperfect we wouldn't even be here we\nwould already be on our next on the next\nwave of you know existence or whatever\ncomes next you know absolutely what's\nwhat's been the most\nrecent thing you were talking about\nlearning life's lessons what do you\nthink's been the most recent\nlife lesson big or small that's come\nacross your path that's kind of stayed\nwith you or been on your mind i just\nwonder because\nyou know we always talk about learning\nlessons through life and people think\nthat they have to be these huge big ones\nbut sometimes it's just something every\nday but what's it been for you has there\nbeen anything that stood out yeah to\nhave fun nice yeah\nto make everything you're doing fun\nperiod because we're here for such a\nlimited time and when we see somebody\npass away that's close to us or someone\nwe idolize our heroes or family members\nour friends whatever just\nyou know you got to realize that okay\ni do work but i need to make this fun\nbecause that is the key to\nhappiness right and i feel like that is\nto me\nthe only thing that really that's real\nsuccess is when you're happy\nso you got to have fun with whatever\nyou're doing like you have to and if\nit's not fun you got to make it fun or\ndo something else you know even if it\npays your bills or anything like you got\nit like\nif you just approach it like that\ni'm telling you the whole something that\nmay be so depressing to you can\ncompletely change that job you may have\nbeen working on i've been doing this\nsince i was 11 years old by the way\nmaking music you know\nand\nobviously i want to do other things with\nmy life like i mean you were so i want\nto write a book i can't wait for that\nyeah because you know i've learned so\nmany lessons like from you or from\ndeepak you know i get to sit with side\nguru and your mother my mom especially i\njust get to sit with janae i get to sit\nwith all these\namazing i get to sit with marie diamond\ni get to sit with a lot of people who\nknow so much\nand that i\nknow that it's one of my life purposes\nto to put that information into\nyou know and all the experiences i've\nbeen through all the testaments i've\nseen all the just magic that i've\nwitnessed in my life you know that's the\nreason i want to write a book i'm not\ndoing it because oh it's a cool thing\nfor your career to do like write a book\nlike i feel like i have to write a book\nbecause it's like one of my missions for\nhumanity i want to read that book man\nyeah i i think it's fascinating hearing\nabout\neveryone's journey\nto how they started going inward yeah\nright like that's what's fascinating\nyeah like we always books are always\nwritten about the journey outwards what\ndid you succeed what did you achieve\nwhere did you get to\nbut to me books that are about the\njourney inward right we need to tell\nthose stories because those are the\njourneys we struggle to take even more\nyeah and those are those are the\njourneys that are a little bit more\nuntold right yes\nyeah unseen that we need to relate to\nand especially my people who listen to\nme like i feel like i really need to do\nthat and but that is one thing i've\nlearned though to just to go back to\nwhat you said is like to have fun with\nit\nmake sure you have fun with it and make\nit fun\nlike\nbring whatever you think is fun to\nwhatever you have to do like if you\nthink well i think vid playing video\ngames was fun well then bring that to\nwork somehow like figure out a way to\nlike incorporate that or figure out a\nway to balance that into your life\nsomehow like you can't let go of the fun\nof anything because then everything just\ngets depressing yeah you know you get\nwiped out and\nyou're not even doing a service to\nanyone at that point yeah and i think\nthat's the interesting thing it's a\nsimple lesson though right it's a beaut\nbut that's what i love about it yeah\nbecause it doesn't have to be this deep\nprofound lesson like yeah usually the\nsimple ones are the are the are they\ngood\nlike like for mine it's been\nprioritizing rest mm-hmm like i love\nprioritizing rest and refuel like one of\nmy favorites\nlike that i need that's just that's\nsomething i still have not managed like\ndeep rest right like deep breaths\nlike letting yourself just have this\ndeep silence stillness\ncalmness whatever gives that to you i\nfind like being able to one of the\nthings i really do enjoy doing and and i\nthink it's fun and that's why fun is\nsuch a wide word\nis um doing like a sensory deprivation\ntank oh yeah so like when i'm sitting in\na sensory deprivation tank\nall my senses are off yeah\nit's actually a beautiful experience for\nme that's deep rest and that is fun for\nme yeah because i'm no longer like\ndealing with any of the challenges or\nstresses or pressures i'm able to just\nbe yeah so inside you know it's\nmagnesium and water\nnaturally float for anyone who's never\ndone it before you can go in there for a\nhalf an hour hour two minutes black it's\ndark kids\nsome of them if they're a bit bougie\nthey have the uh the lights the lights\nthe music like a little bit of moody\nlighting yeah moody lights music\n[Music]\nbut the idea is to just not let your\nsenses be triggered and i find that's\nwhat i crave is letting my senses no\nlonger be\noverexposed or over stimulated one of my\nfavorite things to do is look out into\nthe distance to watch sunsets to watch\nthe sunrise to just look at the sky\nbecause i find it's the least\nover stimulating thing in our lives when\nyou look at your phone you're over\nstimulated right you switch on the news\nyou're overexposed everything's\noverwhelming\nyou've got to take that time for\nyourself correct i love to do anything\nthat helps me\nunderstand myself that helps me\nunderwhelm myself yeah that helps me\nunwind un underwired yeah unwind myself\nthat's what i crave\nand i've realized that that's my reward\nto myself it's not just a um luxury that\nthat's necessary it's a part of richness\nit's a product\nit is um and i think that the mentality\nthat i've experienced and that i've\nalways had is like\nyou have to like stay on and you have to\nstay on and like and almost to a point\nwhere i feel like i didn't deserve rest\nsometimes i didn't i just i didn't\ndeserve it like i'm not almost finished\nwith my stuff i got to keep going i\ncan't\nyou know but\nthat was totally the wrong\nthat was me coming from a place of\ndesperation and not a place of knowing\nand having faith\nbecause\nyou know rest is one of the many joys of\nour life man going to sleep having that\ngood sleep\nlike those and you know by the way\nthat's the moment a lot of times when\nwe're in that deep sleep those are the\nmoments that\na lot of visions and a lot of\ninspiration and a lot of ideas are\ntransmuted to us and\nyou know we're just a vessel so you know\nthat we sometimes we go to a higher\nplace when we're sleeping and are at our\nmost relaxed state\nright so\ni have been learning to get rest i go to\nsleep kind of weird times but especially\nwhen i'm making music like i'll go to\nsleep at like three or four in the\nmorning music terrible yeah yeah you\nknow what i mean but\nit is nothing like getting some good\nrest man nothing like it but what you\njust and you deserve it and you and\npeople deserve it people think that they\ndon't deserve rest or you know they work\ntwo jobs and all these things like\nyou deserve that rest man and like\nlongevity is better than anything you\ncan burn yourself out and go double\nshifts triple shifts don't need sleep\nonly you need two three hours of sleep\nall that get your rest man get that rest\nget as much rest as you need because\nwhen you fully rest it\nthat's when you can really make real\nwaves in whatever industry or whatever\ndream you have whatever thing you got\ngoing on you know yeah i was actually\njust about to say that i think that's\nthe most powerful thing you said there\nas you were sharing that the idea that\nwe don't give ourselves permission\nfor things we don't deserve\nso we don't give ourselves the\npermission to rest\nif we don't feel we deserve rest\nand a lot of us don't feel we deserve\nrest we don't feel we deserve fun we\ndon't feel we deserve joy\nand so we don't allow ourselves to have\nthat feeling\nand as you were saying then you use that\nword deserve\ni was like i just want everyone to stop\neveryone who's listening right now to\nthis episode or watching this episode\nto just stop and think\nwhat are you not\nfeeling like you deserve yeah people\nfeel like they might not deserve real\nlove i'm not i don't deserve a partner\ni don't deserve the rest i don't deserve\nto go out and have fun i haven't been\ngetting enough work done like\nthat's all crazy none of that stuff is\nconnected to each other man like take\ncare take care of yourself first and\nforemost and watch how more beautiful\nyour life unfolds absolutely i want to\nask you something though with on the\nflip side of that\nyou know i've been thinking about\nrecently this idea of\nhow do you do things that are good for\nyou\neven when you don't feel like it\nbecause you don't always feel like doing\nthings that are actually good for you\nright and so we try and avoid them\nbecause of how we feel right now right\nhow do you find yourself doing that with\nthe gym with meditation with everything\nthat you're saying whether it's in the\nstudio how have you been able to go\nand get over that initial feeling of i\ndon't want to meditate today or i don't\nwant to sleep early today i don't want\nto work out today how do you work\nthrough that voice in your head\nwhen it comes to self-care\nit's not this you can set a schedule but\nthere are times where you're going to\nhave to wake up earlier you're gonna\nhave to get right to something right\nyou're gonna have to maybe meditate\nlater on in the day you may not even get\na chance to but that's the beauty of\nfirst of all it's the beauty of the\nshort meditations\nthat i mean you went over like the two\nminute meditations right it doesn't have\nto be 15 minutes where you know because\ni like i take a thing i do things where\ni like write my goals down i do this i\nwrite my intentions for the day i met i\ni meditate for 15 20 minutes\nthen i\nsit my tea you know i take time i take\nan hour to myself and a lot of times i\ndon't always have that right sometimes i\ndo it later in the day when i do have\ntime\nand the days that i don't have time to\ndo that i'll be like well i'm at least\ngonna do this\nthere's a bare minimum\nand if even if it's a two or three\nminute meditation or\nto be honest with you there have been\ndays where\ni was completely exhausted and did\nnothing\nand honestly\ni deserved those days you know there are\ndays where\nyou turn your phone out of data like not\ntoo long ago where i put my phone in the\ndrawer\ni had to leave it i didn't pick it back\nup till like midnight\nand when i was about to go to sleep and\ni didn't go to the studio that day i\ndidn't do anything i just needed time to\nmyself\nyou have to listen to yourself\nand when you listen to yourself you have\nto ask well why don't i feel like doing\nthis why who doesn't want to take care\nof themselves right\nand maybe you just need some time to\njust be lazy man that's okay yeah\nthat is okay\nbut it's the fact that you know better\nwhen you know better you're already in\nheaded in the right direction yeah so\nwhen when you don't\ntake care of yourself right when you\ndon't work out or you don't meditate\nyou're gonna be like\noh man i don't i i feel like i should\nhave kind of you know yeah yeah and\nit'll eventually get you right back on\ntrack uh\nif you're a disciplined person right\nyeah so which i advise people to try and\nbe disciplined with the things that give\nyou joy\nyou know those two things don't always\nyou don't feel like they go together no\nbut beautiful yeah but you gotta\nremember having fun is a serious thing\nyou know what i mean yeah it is you got\nto be serious about your fun\nthat that is actually it yeah we got\nthere that that was the\nidea of how you strike that balance yeah\nyou got to be disciplined about your joy\nfun is a serious thing for sure and i\nthink that's what we lose we go no fun\njust needs to be completely random\nand then\nyou know joy needs to be completely\nrandom yeah but no it's that\nconcentrated focused\ncreation and development of that yeah\nthat goes into life at this point in\nyour life you know we talked about this\nlast time we talked about your journey\nwe talked about where you got to the\nreflection you had the mountain you\nclimbed and then\nlooked around and was like well is this\nit like this you know yeah\nat this point in your life\nwhat have your new\ndreams heart space been like like what's\nbeen going on in your heart and mind\nabout who you want to be and what you\nwant to do\nand what you want to create\nman i've really just been like okay how\ncan i impact the world at this point\ncause i'm in a position right i have a\nplatform\ni've done a lot of things i wanted to do\num\nmusically right i've experienced like\nso many beautiful things and\ni remember all i wanted was a song on\nthe radio right but i didn't limit\nmyself to that right by just being so\nspecific\ni always was like i want a song whatever\nelse i could get you know whatever else\ncomes with that and\nuh so lately i just been\nthinking how can i\nimpact the world how can i use my\nplatform to change the world and look\nback and be like wow that was something\nthat meant something that's something\nthat my grandkids could look at and say\nman granddad really did that you know\nand\nmake that impact to people or listeners\nor anyone that's tuned into my frequency\nyou know what i mean how can i impact\nthem how can i make the best use of this\nopportunity this life i have this body i\nhave\nthat's that's kind of where my\nmotivation has been at so i put that\ninto my music i put that into\nokay we're getting my book together i\nput that into\nyou know since these recover\nrestrictions are up it's kind of like\nhow do i want to see people live what\nyou've been at coachella this year yeah\ncoachella is coming up yeah like what\nexperience do i want to give people yeah\nyou know and\nalso to not take away from what makes me\nhappy\nyou know that's being with the people i\nlove\nyou know just figuring out how we can\nchange the world and aligning my people\nmy team with that and you know i'm\nlooking forward to just living i'm\nlooking forward to starting a family at\nthe right time all right\nyeah and just we're gonna time that yeah\nit's all on guys\nyeah yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah\nrelationships are deep boy they are deep\nbut but that is uh\nthat is to me like\nwhere i'm at in my life\nyou know what i mean i'm not really\ntrying i'm not in the same place i was\nwhen i was a teenager when i was in my\n20s\nit's i'm in a whole different way of\nokay how can i impact the world yeah you\nknow what i mean with with the\nopportunity that i've been given with\nthis platform i've been given yeah and\nthat and that's such a\nbrilliant acceptance because for so many\npeople when they get up the first\nmountain it becomes about the second\nmountain and then the third mountain and\nthen the fourth mountain and they just\nkeep climbing mountains\nand it doesn't change how they feel and\nso for you to already have that\nrealization and go the real mountain i\nwant to climb is the impact and the\nservice and the the joy and the\nhappiness that's that's a beautiful\nthing and we were talking about this\nearlier offline but about relationships\nand you know your relationships\nobviously with janae was something that\nyou've been investing in yeah yeah like\nit's been a it's been a commitment it's\nbeen an investment obviously we've spent\ntime together and she's been an amazing\nguest on the show as well and yeah how'd\nyou met her first before i met you yeah\nyeah yeah uh and she was the one who\ntold me like you kind of me and she's\nincredible like you know and when i\nfound out you two were together i was\nlike this makes so much sense\nbut but walk me through whatever you\nfeel comfortable with walk me through\nsome of the\nthe journeys in in what it's meant to\ncreate a conscious partnership and\nwhat's the real work that goes behind\nthat because you know we all have our\nbaggage and our trauma and our issues\nfrom our past relationships our parents\nso many things\nwhat's gone into crafting and what\nyou're trying to craft wow that's that's\nreally deep too about\nlet's make sure we touch back on like\ntraumas and yeah um\nthings that we inherit from our parents\nyou know because we hear it\ni'm actually i'll do that we'll talk\nabout that yeah and then i can get that\nlike yeah one of the things i've had to\ndo in my life is clear\nsome of the blockages that i've had and\nyou know\nall in different ways all through\ndifferent people and that's something\nthat i may want to get more detailed in\nwith people too because people are going\nto say well how do i clear these\nblockages within me\nand there are many many ways and many\npeople that peoples that i've met with\nthat have been able to you know help me\nand you know i used to have a worryman\nof money was one of them um just like\nyou can inherit\nyour parents hair or you can inherit\ntheir eyes or you can inherit there you\nknow i remember my dad used to be like i\nused to smile just like you did you know\nso you can inherit a smile you can also\ninherit someone's fears\nyou can also inherit someone's beliefs\nthat aren't in alignment with you know\nyour own and you feel very conflicted\nuh you can inherit\njust a lot of you can inherit uh pain\nyou can inherit racism and you could be\nlike well i'm not a racist person but i\nknow i know someone who's like bro i'm\nnot a racist person but then\nthey call every black person a kid\nyou know he's good that's a good kid and\ni'm like\nyou gotta watch yourself a little bit\nman that's like\nyou know just pay attention to that\nbecause you don't refer to people who\nare who look like you as a kid\nand you might refer to somebody who's a\nkid that's the same age almost the same\nage as you you know so it's like\nyou inherit these things you may not\neven realize it right and\nit's important to just do the work on\nyourself because\nto push the next it's like also breaking\ngenerational curses it's like\ni broke one of the blockages i had and\nnow my family uh we are living\nwe are getting more of our dreams my mom\nis doing things that she never thought\nshe would do my dad my brother you know\num\nwe grew up in debt essentially and we i\nhad to break that that was one of the\nblocks i had to break was uh the block\nof my of not just be scared to have\nmoney\nfeel like there's a scarcity of money\nand it's not you know it's all just\nenergy right and you can have as much\nenergy neat as needed\nand\nuh\nto clear all these blocks but\num to get back to my point it is so\nimportant to go through these blocks and\nthese traumas\nbecause when you pass it on to not only\njust the next generation you're passing\non to the people around you your friends\nyour family you know you are you are the\ncompany you keep\nand the more\nlike-minded and better you are the the\nbetter everyone around you is including\nyour family right and you guys can have\nthe opportunity to\ndo anything that is possible anything\nyou want any any empire any business any\nownership things that you didn't even\nknow was imaginable but it all starts\nwith you working on yourself and that's\nthe importance of\nyou know the traumas it's almost like\nwell why would i want to correct you\nknow cancer runs in our family breast\ncancer runs in our family why would i\nwant to correct that well you want to\ncorrect that so you don't pass it on\nand you know the vibration of cancer is\na low vibration you know what i'm saying\nso\nyou know uh it's important to take care\nof ourselves and get rid of that trauma\nbut okay that was beaut i'm so glad you\nwent there yeah i'm so happy you went\nthere because that the idea of being\naware of what we're inheriting\nis so important especially when you when\nthat we are aware of we inherit what we\nwear and how we think and how we look\nbut then how we behave how we\ncommunicate how we talk to people how we\nthink about people yeah how we think\nabout women how we think about men how\ndo we think about oh that's a good one\nhow do you think about women and men\nyeah you know that's another thing or or\nthem how you think about trans how do\nyou think about lgbtq like just like\never just how we think about other\ni'm so glad you went there i just want\nto say that i'm so happy you took us on\nthat yeah i can just imagine like aliens\nor people from another world being like\nman these people really tripped that\nthey\nhave different shades of\nskin they really be like it's just they\nreally kill each other over this like\nyou know i've never seen a cow look at\nanother cow and be like\nyou're a brown cow you're a\nblack and white cow i don't want to be\naround you like nah they don't it's like\nyou know and it makes me realize that\nlike if we\nkill each other and hate each other over\nthings like that or who we love right or\nthings that even have nothing to do with\nus\nthen i wonder how we would handle an\nextraterrestrial or an alien or really\nsomething that is really different like\nyou know i always i'm like maybe that's\nwhy the government or whoever doesn't\never want to really break it to humanity\nbecause who how are we going to react\nyou know but that's a whole another\nconversation\ni wanted to ask you something about\nrelationships because you go through\ntimes where you don't see your wife all\nthe time and how important is distance\nin a relationship you know because i\nknow some people may feel guilty like\nnot being with their partner all the\ntime or maybe even enjoying time away\nyou know that that could be a guilt\nthing like oh man i'm really having a\ngood time by myself or\nalso spending too much time with your\npartner\nand losing a sense of who you are and\nyour individual self so\ni\nas you i look at your relationship you\nguys are a beautiful couple you know\nwhat i mean and\ni'm not saying that and idolizing that\nor anything but that's just me making it\nuh you know\nrecognizing that yeah it's my friend\nyeah yeah how do\num\nhow do you balance uh the distance in\nyour relationship and is that necessary\nyeah i think for us and and i agree with\nyou by the way like i don't there is no\nsuch thing as a perfect couple perfect\nmarriage perfect relationship so we\nshould remove that idolization\nwith everything just as we were talking\nabout earlier\ni've found that i'll take a bit of a\ndetour but\ni find that as humans we like to idolize\nor we like to demonize so we demonize\npeople\nwe go you\nare terrible you're wrong you're the\nworst oh we go you're the best i love\nyou and i adore you and sometimes the\npeople we idolize become the same people\nwe demonize when they let us down all\nthe time all the time and so we don't\nhave this ability which what we talked\nabout as monks was neutralized how do\nyou just neutralize everything and look\nat it for what it is\nand look at it for the reality of it\nrather than idolize or demonize it just\njust learn to accept so\nwhen i look at my relationship we found\nthat when we first got married i'd say\nin the first two years of our marriage\nso my wife and i have been married for\nsix years and next year we will have\nbeen together for ten years we've been\ntogether for nine years now in total and\nthe\nfirst two years of our marriage i reckon\nwe spent in total six to eight months\napart in two years\nand the reason for that was because my\nwife missed her family in london we'd\nmoved to new york because of my career\nright and i wanted her to be with her\nfamily to be happy but i also wanted to\nbe in new york so that i could build my\ncareer and build my purpose right and so\nthat because became valid which is all\nvalid she wanted to be with her family\nwhich i respect and love and i wanted to\nbe here and i said to i said i will fly\nback\nevery weekend every month if i have to\nif that's what's going to keep this\nmarriage together\nbecause i don't think you should give up\nwhat you care about and i'm not going to\ngive up what i care about we both\nshould not give up what we care about\nthe most\nbecause we care about each other can you\noh my gosh see one of the things i'm not\nto cut you off but people always say\noh you have to give things you have to\nsacrifice so much you have to let go\nlike\nno you can't sacrifice yourself to the\npoint where it's it's a it's torture\nyou know you can't sacrifice yourself to\nwhere you're not yourself anymore that\nyou know what i mean and that's that's\nreally important not to cut you off i\njust wanted to add that in there dude\neverything you just added i'm like that\nbecause\nthat's the fine line you just gave the\nfine line of\nyou can't\ncompromise when compromise becomes\ntorture\ncompromise is healthy everyone has to\ncompromise i may cancel a dinner or i\nmay reschedule my weekend like that's\ncompromise that's\nbeing in tune with yourself yeah exactly\nbut you you just defined it perfectly\nlike you can't sacrifice does not lead\nif i gave up the pursuit of my purpose\nin new york\ni would have been sad\ndepressed and tortured using your words\nand if my wife was\nkept away from her family\nand couldn't travel back to see them\nbecause i didn't want her to because she\nhad to be with me in new york she would\nhave been tortured and trapped\ni don't want that as my loving\nrelationship no that's not a union\nexactly that's not a union and so what\nwe found is that we got used to it but\nwe've got better at it\nso at that time we got used to it but\nwhat happened is we would really\ndisconnect this was a mistake we would\nreally disconnect\nwe would barely talk barely check in and\nthen when we'd get back together it\nalmost felt like we were strangers again\nwow and so that wasn't it wasn't good or\nbad i just think we had to get better\nlike today it's changed yeah and so i\njust want to put that out there that\nwhen we first got married and we did\nthat i don't think we had the healthiest\nversion of distance and this is my point\nthat you can evolve and grow and learn\nand then it was covered right so during\nthe pandemic we lived together for two\nyears and we saw each other every day\nand that was amazing it was actually\nbrilliant because that was the first\ntime in our lives that we'd spent every\nday together for two years and it was\nbeautiful we we loved it\nand now\nthis year i will have been away from my\nwife when she finally gets back\nuh but she's been working in london i've\nbeen in la\nwhere we currently both live that she's\nbeen we would have been apart for around\nfour months and maybe we've seen each\nother once in four months hopefully yeah\nwe'll go on this mini vacation together\ni feel this time we've both found a\nhealthier way of being distance so she's\nin london because she's working\nand that's her purpose\ni'm in la because that's what my purpose\nis\nagain i respect her purpose and she\nrespects mine i value her values and she\nvalues mine\nand if i had to give up mine and be\nthere for four months or she had to give\nup hers and be here for four months i\nwouldn't feel happy because i know she's\nnot happy\nand she wouldn't feel happy because she\nknows i'm not happy so what we've\nrealized is that in the times we're\napart we can both be more productive\nwe get to catch up with our own friends\nand deepen those bonds and connection\nbecause we both have more time yeah i\nfind that i miss her every day i have\nnever texted my wife this much since we\nwere dating yeah i haven't caught her\nthis much since we were dating because\nnow it's like i wake up in the morning\nthe first person i call is her yeah i\ndon't do that you she's next to me right\nright right right the last thing at\nnight i know she's already asleep in\nlondon but i'm messaging her messages so\nthat when she wakes up in the morning\nthey're the first thing she sees yeah it\nadds a beautiful dynamic and there's\nsomething really beautiful in the bhakti\ntradition which is based on love and\ndevotion\nto the universe the divine\nand it talks about how love in\nconnection is beautiful\nbut love in separation\nis one of the most beautiful experiences\nto want to be back with your beloved and\nthe person that you love\nthat's what all the songs are about yeah\nthat's what i'll do right that's all the\nmusic's about like the missing of\nsomeone the yearning of someone the the\nseparation from a loved one\nis sometimes where you get to experience\nthe deepest joy and even process some of\nyour biggest fears and weaknesses\nand that's what i find that\nwhen i'm away from my wife i have to\nprocess my weaknesses and my fears\nhead-on yeah and that i find to be\njoyful because it deepens my love for\nher\nand so i personally find that distance\nand personal time is critical\nand the way i define it for someone in a\nweek because someone might say well jay\nwe don't work like you guys where we're\naway from each other for months because\nwe live in the same home we don't have\ncareers that take us across the world\ni believe and i've i've been planning\nthis out that here's an ideal seven day\nweek\nright yeah\nyou should ideally spend one to two days\nby yourself with yourself even if you're\nmarried even if you're dating have two\nnights a week that are for you mm-hmm\neven if you're in the same\nhouse save the house have two week\nseparate that it's for you to listen to\nyour inner voice that's two nights a\nweek\nnow have two nights that are together\njust you two\ndate nights experiments events whatever\nit is but just you too so that you\ndevelop and you water your intimacy\nthat's four nights and you've got three\nnights left in those other three nights\none night you spend with your own\nfriends\nso she's with her friends i'm with my\nfriends\nand then the other two nights we're with\na collective group of friends\nfriends that we share\nnow you can make your own ratio of your\nseven days\nbut notice how the ideal seven days\ninclude time alone\ntime with each other\ntime with your own friends and family\nand time with collective friends and\nfamily yeah if we can't look at our\nlives and say we do all of those\nit means we're not watering a really\nimportant part of our relationships if i\ndon't water myself i've got nothing\nthat's going to come up later yes you're\ngoing to feel\nis hurting you yeah what you're talking\nfrom is like from experience i could see\nlike this isn't like a\ntextbook formula this isn't some this is\nsome experience that you guys have been\nthrough and you made it through so i\nrespect that and i realized that uh\nyou know the crazy thing about being in\na relationship and having distance\nbetween you\nis it really can bring you closer to the\none that you're missing you know it kind\nof is almost\ni would say\nalmost a a great test to see how close\nyou really are you know what i mean\nbecause\nbeing like being so far from someone can\nbring you so much closer you can learn\nso much about someone\nyou know through texting them more\nthrough the phone as opposed to waking\nup next to him every day so i think it's\nbeautiful to give each other that time\napart\nand\nthat's when you really know when\nthat person is still all you want that\nthat's that's who that's special for you\nknow i definitely been able to\nexperience that so that's that's a\nbeautiful thing you know and uh it's a\nkey part in any relationship i think in\nany marriage the key to it is is having\nsome distance\nbetween you know what i mean and uh\nyeah and having someone who you\nenergetically match with yes you know\none thing that that's the most important\nthing that's the most important thing\nright there\nbecause\nthis is funny because i don't know how\nto even say this say it say this\nproperly around or whatever but i'm\ngonna just say like\nwhen you\nhave sex with someone who you feel are\nyou guys are equally energetically on\nthe same level\nthat's how it's really supposed to be\nright because in other in other\nways i just hope people realize that\nbecause if not if you're not with\nsomeone who you energetically feel like\nyou're on the same level with\nthen that person could be taken away\nfrom you it could throw you off track it\ncould\nuninspire you it could\ndo all these crazy things so it's\nimportant to realize um the power of\nthat energy definitely that you have\nwhen you when you with somebody who can\nmatch your energy definitely sexually no\nabsolutely and i'm so glad you raised\nthat because\nso the\nsanskrit word for celibacy\nis brahmacaria now celibacy in the\nwestern world fields sounds like\nabstaining from sex that's what you\nthink of the word celibacy\nbrahmacharya it translates as the proper\nuse or direction of energy\nwhen you talk about a poor energy\nexchange when you're just wasting energy\nwhen there isn't an equal energetic\nexchange right that's why we feel\ndrained we feel\ndepleted we feel or afterwards you're\nlike oh this is a waste of my time right\ntony yeah any however you feel like how\nmany years later it takes and yeah but\nwhen you have someone of equal energy\nexchange that impression is so much more\npowerful and deeper and so i'm i'm glad\nyou brought that up because i guess the\nquestion though is like obviously when\nyou meet someone\nthey're we're all at different stages\neven in our vibrational energy right how\ndo you\nknow\nbecause today we live in a world where\nanyone can use the language everyone can\nsay the word energy\neveryone can use the word vibration\neveryone can use all the lingo and you\nthink oh yeah this person like they've\nbeen reading about chakras\nright\nhow do you actually know that someone is\nof a similar energy\nin\na relationship like how do you how do\nyou look for that because and i don't\nthink there's a formula or there's a\nperfect science i'm just saying how do\nyou look for that or how have you found\nthat and look for that it's only one way\nfeeling it as simple as that you can\nit's something you feel and you have to\nreally be in tune with yourself right\nthat's another reason why working on\nyourself was so important because the\nmore you in tune with yourself the more\nyou're able to feel like this isn't\nright right and it could make sense in a\nlot of other ways you could be like oh\nthis person is\nmy ideal of like the perfect person in\nmy head you know like physically but it\njust doesn't well i don't care like you\ndisregard those feelings when you put\nthat\negotistical spin on things right or you\nput the like that image or like the\nexpectations or things check marks you\nthink you should be hitting but it's\nreally just a feeling\nprocess and when you realize\nyou know when you have the feeling of\nthat feeling like you're just being\nproductive\nyou know\nlike i'm not ever\never gonna like physically be involved\nwith anyone if if it's not productive\nyou know\nand i feel like i'm being productive you\nknow what i mean um\nand that's how you should feel with your\npartner like you feel like you're being\nproductive you know and you feel you\nhave a good feeling about it yeah yeah\nanything else is just kind of like you\nknow\nyou think that you make and\nfun yeah and fun and it's fun yeah you\nknow if it's not fun productive and all\nthese things and you know if you feel\nweird or feel like you're wasting your\ntime afterwards and\nthat's probably not right for you you\nknow and you can eventually kid yourself\nfor a little while but eventually you're\ngonna\nmove on or something's gonna happen and\nyou know yeah i think one of the things\ni look for in energy exchange\nin in every level is the idea of\nyou know it's almost like how long have\nyour energies been invested together\ndeeply\nwhen my career started to take off i\nwould often point to an achievement\nand look at my wife and say love me for\nthis right look at what i did right\nand then i'd win another award and be\nlike look at this i love me for this\nand she wouldn't\nfeel anything she wouldn't she wouldn't\nrespect me for like she wouldn't care\nabout that yeah not that she wouldn't\nrespect me she wouldn't care about she\nwouldn't care about that and she would\nbe happy for you she'd be happy for me\nbut she didn't care about that yeah she\ndidn't love me for that but i was saying\nvalidate me for this love me for this\nand then i realized that i was trying to\nget her to love me\nfor what my achievements are when she\nloved me for who i am isn't that\nbeautiful like that was the most deepest\nreminder to me that my wife's been with\nme\nsince\nwhen i was in 25 000 worth of debt when\nwe were four months away from being\nbroke\nwhen i was pursuing my purpose and no\none cared and i had five people turn up\nto hear me speak\nand my wife's been through all of that\nand she loved me then and she loves me\nnow but she's never been enamored by\nthe achievements or the successes she\nhas always\nexchanged energy with me on the level if\nshe loves who i am\nso she had to love me that way to remind\nmyself to love myself that way and i\nthink that's what i look at as energy\nexchange\nis\ndoes someone remind me to love myself\nthrough how they love me\nlike does the way they love me remind me\nto love myself for the real reasons yeah\nand that you know that is just\nundefeatable like that you can't beat\nthat's the champion of love yeah because\nyou're like you're teaching me how to\nlove myself based on what i actually\nshould love myself for\nman\nagain talking from experience yeah it's\nyeah it's it's it's real like i've i\nhave been that man that has wanted the\nvalidation of my wife\nfor my medals and my honors and when she\ndidn't give it to me i felt frustrated\nwow because i felt well i can get more\nattention\nfrom somewhere else for these things\nbut then you go\nbut then do i want attention or don't\nwant affection like do i want validation\nor do i want someone to value me mm-hmm\nvalidation is conditional it's\nconditional can come and go quick it's\nlike wears off it's like a\nit's like a new sweater or something\nright like you have to eventually watch\nit and it just starts to deteriorate and\num\nas opposed to loving someone for who\nthey are that's that's more like\nunbreakable right that's like that\nundefeated undefeated yeah\nsean what have i not asked you today\nwhat's been on your mind your heart\nwhere have you not gone because i feel\nlike i know it's hard to say this but i\nreally do believe this\nbecause the last time we were getting to\nknow each other\nwhere we've gone today\nwe've gone\nwe have gone to some places today like\nas in this is without a doubt even\nthough it's hard to say it's even better\nthan the first conversation because of\nour openness yeah because we have a\nrelationship a deeper relationship today\nand so yeah what the where the places\nwe've gone to and the things you've said\ntoday\ni'm gonna have to listen back to this\none keep doing what you're doing man\nlike the job you're doing is\nfantastic like i tune into so many\ninterviews\ni loved your book\num i can't wait to have you write the\nforward on my book\nand\njust to everyone listening man you know\ni know you're going through whatever\nyou're going through just do the best\nyou can\nstay strong\num don't give up on yourself you know\nthat's\nme there's no losing you know you can\nyou can maybe think you're losing but\nyou only lose when you stop you know\nwhat i mean there's no such thing as\nis losing if you don't stop it's only\njust learning and like developing and\nand getting that experience and wiser\nyou know you're just sharpening a sword\nbeing more of a master
