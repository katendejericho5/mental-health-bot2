    "transcript": "you'll get to where you want in life\njust not in the way you imagined\nand that's because\nthe path that's paved up and down\nis far different to the path we pave\ni've always had friends who are older\nthan me\nand i could see a lot of them in the\nmost successful careers successful jobs\nbeautiful partners whatever it was but i\nsaw a sense of lack of fulfillment\nmeaning and purpose in their lives\nand i've always been an observer and i\nwould see these people who are like five\nyears older than me seven years older\nthan me maybe 10 years older than me and\ni'd be watching them and go is that the\nlife i want and often the advice i give\nto people today is fast forward where\nyou are\nlook at yourself in 10 15 20 years time\nand ask yourself the question\nis that where i want to be\nif you're in a company look at the\nperson who's 20 years ahead of you and\nask yourself is that where i want to be\nif you're in a startup look at where\nother startups have got to in similar\nroles and go is that where i want to be\nand if the answer is no\nthen you need to find a new path\nand for me the answer at that time from\nobserving was no the path that my\nparents or society or the university i\nwent to or the community i had that was\ncarving out for me\nit didn't feel like the path for me so i\nwas almost seeking\nan alternative or a new path i was just\nso fortunate that it happened to be an\nuplifting powerful path as opposed to\nsomething that could have actually taken\nme down the wrong road because that\ncould have been possible too\nso walk me through the first time you\nstep off the plane\nin india it's summer and so i'm living\nthere i'm waking up i'm almost doing all\nthe practices just as if you were\nshadowing a ceo i'm just shadowing a\nmonk and so i'm just shadowing his\nlifestyle so we wake up he's he's like\none of the most elite monks so we're\nwaking up at like 2 a.m every day after\nsleeping at like 9 or 10 p.m and then we\nstudy these ancient vedas which are 5\n000 plus years old together and we spend\ntwo hours and i'm studying with the best\nof the best here so he can like analyze\nand assimilate and i'm learning fast\ntaking notes then 4 am we go to\ncollective meditation\nwe do those practices with the other\nmonks as well\n6 am we have personal meditation so i'm\nliterally going through\nthe life of a monk and falling in love\nwith it step by step going wow i've\nnever had this experience before i just\nthrew myself in and i was practicing it\nto the t\nright it wasn't like oh no my back hurts\nwhen i sit on the floor i can't stay\nhere for too long or you know today when\npeople are like oh i can't meditate for\nlonger than two minutes i was like no\ni'm gonna do it for two hours if that's\nwhat they're doing i'm gonna give it a\ngo because i can only test the\nhypothesis will only be true\nif the experiment is carried out to the\ndegree that they are so if the\nhypothesis is if you live like this you\nare happy more fulfilled\nthen i want to do that all right so\nlet's explore this then through the lens\nof creating one's own perfect life yes\nwhich is pretty interesting especially\nbecause\ninteresting because i think this is so\naccurate to the way that most people are\nit's not like oh there's some grand\nmissing thing in my life but you took\nthat first action so codify this for me\nor or for anybody that wants they don't\nknow what their ideal life looks like\nthey just know that they're not living\nit yet so\nstep number one is take it seriously to\nfind out if the hypothesis is true or\nnot you have to take the um the the\nexperiment you have to do it sincerely\nwhat comes after that i think even one\nstep before that is is opening yourself\nup to new role models and new\nexperiences\nsee we live in echo chambers\nwe're just surrounded by the same\nthinking how often do you bump into a\nmonk you know it just doesn't happen you\ndon't have no one has a dinner party and\ngoes oh yeah we just invited the monk\nyou know from town like the local monk\nlike no one ever does that and so\nwe meet people who are just like us most\nof the time\nand we talk about this in business all\nthe time if you want to be a billionaire\nspend time with billionaires if you want\nto be a millionaire spend time with\nmillionaires if you want to be a tech\nstartup spend time with you know that's\nthat's the common rhetoric that we hear\nall the time\nbut what if you want to find purpose and\nmaster the mind there's no one better\nthan a monk who's mastered the mind so\nfor me the first step is just opening\nyourself up to new experiences and new\nrole models\nbecause most of us can't see ourselves\nin people so then we try and fit\nourselves into the boxes that we do see\nand and i mean there's this beautiful\nquote that i've been saying it\neverywhere and i wish i wrote it but i\ndidn't\nso it's by a philosopher and writer\nnamed cooley\nand he said that today i'm not what i\nthink i am i'm not what you think i am\ni am what i think you think i am\nright and just let that blow your mind\nfor a moment it's uh it's so powerful\ni'm not what i think i am i'm not what\nyou think i am\ni am what i think you think i am\nso we live in this perception of a\nperception of ourselves\nhence my identity is made by what my\nparents think i should be my identity is\nmade up by what my college or university\nthinks i should achieve\nwhile you're living in that bubble in\nthat echo chamber\ngetting to what you really want to do is\nimpossible because maybe that just\ndoesn't fit and i think so many people\nfeel that way today that they don't fit\ninto the current education system they\ndon't fit with the three or four or five\ncareers that you're taught exist\nso\nthat process of self-excavation and\nactualization\nfirst requires being exposed you can't\nbe what you can't see if i never saw a\nmonk i would never have wanted to be a\nmonk if i never meet a billionaire i\nwouldn't want to be one because i\nwouldn't know what that feels like i\ndon't know what it looks like i don't\nknow what it takes\nand i think that's the biggest challenge\nof our society that we're not exposed so\nthat's the first step being exposed to\nunique experiences and role models\nsecond step is finding that experience\nor role model that you're passionate\nabout and exactly like you said taking\nit seriously shadow their network with\nthem spend time with them observe them\neven from afar it takes that observation\nbeing addicted to observing that\nperson's lifestyle\nand then the third step is going yes or\nno\ndoes that work for me\nnot everyone who's going to go off and\nbecome a monk is going to feel like the\nway i did and that's cool\nbut not everyone is going to go and\nfollow and shadow a billionaire and go\nthat's exactly the lifestyle i want they\nmay want the result but do they want the\nhard work that goes with it and so for\nme that's the third step it's observing\nfocusing shadowing getting as close to\nthe process of that individual and then\ngoing yes or no do i want that process\nnot do i want the result everyone wants\nto be that monk who's fully enlightened\nyou know can walk through has an\nincredible aura that people just\ngravitate towards but when you realize\nhe has to wake up at 2 a.m every day and\nsleeps about four to six hours you're\nlike ah you know i don't want to do that\nthat doesn't sound like me all right so\nyeah a couple things one you said he's\nas powerful as he is yeah find power for\nme\npower being\nso from amongst perspective perspective\nthe greatest power\nis to be self-controlled\nto be able to train the mind and energy\nto focus it exactly where you want it\nand when you want it to be\nyou are completely detached and\nundeterred from external ups and downs\nyou're able to navigate anything that\nseems\ntough challenging fun excitement with\nthe same amount of being equipoised and\nbalanced in equanimity\nwithout being too excited in pleasure or\nbeing too depressed in pain but knowing\nhow to navigate every situation to me\nthat's great strength and great power um\ni heard in one of your talks you were\nsaying that if you look at um a literal\nlifeline a heartbeat for instance you\nknow it's it's up and it's down and\npeople have this sense that something\nlike enlightenment would be\nthat um the equanimity forever and just\nan even keel and you said but what what\ndoes that resemble it resembles a flat\nline when you die correct so\nwhat is it like what i love about you is\nyou sort of went into the wilderness of\nbeing a monk but you brought it back to\nthe real world\nbecause when you talk about a monk you\ntalk about them being detached and that\nto me seems like the only real way to\nhave that sort of super even keel\nexistence which is not appealing to me\npersonally so if you're bringing back\nthat notion of power of having control\nover yourself not letting your emotions\ntake you everywhere but knowing that\nlife is is the series of ups and downs\nwhat does that power look like when it's\nbrought back absolutely and actually\nthat's the whole aim of monk training\nit's it's more like a training system\nthan it is a lifelong commitment it is\nbringing that mindset into the real\nworld where you get to test it now i got\nto do that for real\nwhen i left being a monk around five\nyears ago\nand\nwhen i left it was like oh my god i'm in\nthe real world now again real world i\nhave to think about how to apply all\nthis i'm gonna test for real\nall this stuff that i've learned and i\nwas scared like i was nervous i was\nanxious and all those things that i've\nbeen trained not to be\nrushed back\nbecause\nfor the first time in my life i had to\nreally put it into practice\nand i love that feeling i'm so glad that\ni had to do that so for me actually the\nmindset is completely\ntrainable to bring into the real world\nthat's that's what i'm trying to do\nand what it allows you to do is it\nallows you to grain clarity and\nperspective when you need it because you\nknow when you can just take a bird's-eye\nview from something\nyou know when you need to get close into\nsomething you know when you need to pull\nback from something there's a beautiful\nverse in the bhagavad-gita that says\nthat\ndetachment is not that you owe nothing\ndetachment is that nothing owns you\nand i love it because to me that\nsummarizes detachment in a way that it's\nnot usually explained usually people see\ndetachment as being away from everything\nactually the greatest detachment is\nbeing close to everything and not\nletting it consume and own you\nand that's real power that's real\nstrength how many people do we know that\nhave had fame and then that fame has\nruined them\nso for me that definition of detachment\nis possible to practice even in the real\nworld rather than saying oh i'm just\ngonna have a really simple life i'm just\ngonna have nothing in life what was the\nbest part about being a monk the best\npart about being a monk is that your\nmorning routine and practices are so\npowerful\nthat you can actually aspire\nfor more incredible values in life\nbecause your mind is clear because your\nmind is clear\nand you have\nthat ability to have more clarity so you\ncan seek that which is which is higher\nso i'll give an example of what i mean\ndefine is that we're about to define\nwhat is higher yes exactly so for me\nbeing able to overcome\nego\nbeing able to overcome envy\nbeing able to overcome jealousy being\nable able to overcome the negative of\ncompetitive state there's a positive\ncompetitive state and there's a negative\ncompetitive state today when people are\nlooking on instagram or facebook or\nyoutube\nall you're looking at is oh she got that\nmany likes or he got that many likes she\ngot engaged or he got married or oh my\ngod look at her body or look at that and\nit's like that stuff's destroying us\ninside envy jealousy ego greed\nto be able to have enough clarity to\npurify yourself of those things\nis going to alleviate\nthe biggest anxieties and depressions of\nour time and mental health problems\nand and we know that we know that\nbecause all the mental health research\ntoday suggests that things like\nisolation overexposure we now can have\nmore pain\nconsumption in one day because of what\nwe're exposed to than the pain we would\nhave had in a lifetime that's huge like\nthat's ridiculous to think that in one\nday because of the media news and social\nmedia we consume more negative than we\ndid in a lifetime\nfor me being able to have time\nenergy and clarity to focus on\nself-purification\nthat is the best thing about being a\nmonk\nbecause you have that time reflection\nand a process\nand an environment that only allows you\nto become more purified of those things\nso\nif i was the interviewer that i wanted\nto be i would have asked you this\nquestion when we were on the topic but\ni'm going to go back just because it's\nimportant enough um you gave us the\nthree ways that you can really construct\nyour ideal life but define an ideal life\nfor me\nso an ideal life for me is a life and\nthis applies to a company an\norganization and institution for me\nis an ideal life is when we all have a\nhead a heart and a hand all three\nelements together working in alignment\nwithout one or the other we start to\nlose something if you only have a head\nand a heart\nyou will find that life is stable and\ndefined yeah sure sure sure\nso ahead\nis the clarity of vision\nwhat you want what you want\nknowing what you want the way you\npicture life and being able to navigate\nand make the decisions to get there\nthat's a good head\na good heart\nis being able to understand what your\nintuition and heart wants being able to\nconnect and tap into that understanding\ndeeper and beyond the vision you may\nhave painted for yourself so i often say\nto people that you'll get to where you\nwant in life just not in the way you\nimagined and that's because\nthe path that's paved up and down is far\ndifferent to the path we pave so you can\nhave a great head and a great vision and\na great mission and know where you want\nto go\nbut if your heart's not able to have\nthat resilience and be able to adapt\nand and have compassion and care and all\nof that then then you're not going to be\nable to make the toughest decisions\nwithout your heart but to be able to\nrealize that we need to\ncare and be sustainable and long-lasting\nrequires a heart and a hand is that\nservice\nwanting to pass that on that which you\nhave wanting to give it forward pay it\nforward the idea of serving with what\nyou have i often say to people your\npassion is for you your purpose is for\nothers your passion makes you happy but\nwhen you use your passion to make a\ndifference in someone else's life that's\na service that's a purpose and that's\nthe hand\nso those are my three\nelements of an ideal\nlife i like that a lot and i when you\nfirst said it i'm glad you defined it\nbecause when you first said it i thought\nthe heart was going to be the part about\nlike you know just compassion caring for\nothers doing something for other people\nbut i like that the hand\nbeing tied to service so one thing that\ni think a lot about is\ndeep fulfillment like\nreally\nwhen i think about okay what is a life\nwe're living honestly it comes down to\nneurochemistry for me and it comes down\nto\nexperiencing this world in a way that\noptimizes for\nfor sustainable pleasure which i'll\ndifferentiate between a bowl of ice\ncream a bump of cocaine those are\npleasurable and i i haven't done the\ncocaine but the ice cream i can speak\nfor okay i've done both good\nyeah so i'll trust that it holds up\num but they they don't bring a lasting\nfulfillment it's not sustainable right\nso both of them end up creating this\nself-destructive loop\nand\npurpose really does become that thing\nthat gives you something that is\non a neurochemical level\ndeeply satisfying absolutely and\nhow much of this like\nhow did you\nmarry the deeply spiritual the often\nabstract oftentimes i'll hear spiritual\nspeakers talk and and i feel them sort\nof drifting off into the ether how did\nyou marry that to experimentation\nneuroscience practicality like one why\ndo you find that interesting and then\ntwo what are you doing with that so i\nstudied behavioral science at university\nso i've always been fascinated by why\npeople do what they do\nand whenever i was reading these books\nthat are 5 000 years old\nmy greatest fascination was finding a\nprinciple\nand finding its relevance in modern\nscience and i said to myself the day i\ncan't find that i'll quit i won't\nbelieve in this anymore so i'm still\ndoing that and i'm ready to quit if\nsomeone shows me a piece of science and\ni can't find a principle in these\nancient literatures or actually what i\nlike to call these timeless literatures\nthen i'll give up my faith because\nfor me\nit has to track forward and i'll give\nyou a really basic example today we're\nin the gratitude movement there's like a\nmillion gratitude journals out there\nthere's a million scientific studies on\ngratitude and gratitude has been linked\nto better mental health self-awareness\nbetter relationships i mean there's so\nmany scientific studies on the on the\nneural level\nthat shows that gratitude is great for\nyour mind brain and fulfillment\nnow i look back like gratitude is all\nover the timeless wisdom one of the\nfirst things we were trying to do when\nwe were a monk was to pay our respects\nto the earth for what it gives us and\nyou do that first thing in the morning\nwhat is that if not gratitude\nwhen you wake up in the morning you\nthank the earth for the food you thank\nthe earth for the water you thank the\nearth for allowing yourself to walk you\nstart your day with gratitude today the\nbiggest tip on forbes and ink and\neverything is start your day with\ngratitude like where does it come from\nit's it's right there these things are\nold so i get fascinated i'm intrigued by\nthe parallels and patterns because it\nsaves you time\nit's the same way as which if i say that\nthis business person got invested by\nthis company and that's why they're\nsuccessful because they had the right\ninvestors etc that's a pattern so i know\nif i'm building a business in that area\ni'm going to look for investors like\nthat\nit's the same thing that pattern saves\nyou time rather than you trying to\nfigure out does gratitude work\nhow shall i be grateful\ncreating your own process almost\nit's really interesting\nlife has taught me to stop believing\neverything i think\nuh and the way that it's taught me that\nis by relentlessly punishing me every\ntime i overinvest and being right and i\nremember when my wife and i first got\ntogether she used to get chest\ninfections all the time and she told me\nit's because um of the ac\nand i was like that doesn't make sense\nand she was like no no my my grandmother\nused to just swear up and down if you if\nyou're hot and you stand in front of a\nfan that you're gonna get sick and i was\nlike that is the biggest load of like\ncrap i've ever heard in my life that\ndoes not make sense like getting sick\ncomes from either bacteria or virus like\nit's that simple and she was like i'm\njust saying this my grandma always said\nand it seems true to me and i was just\nlike oh god this is exhausting\nand then one time\ni went to a doctor and i was like yeah\nand my wife is crazy and thinks that\nwhen you're hot if you stand in front of\nac it'll make you sick and he goes oh\nyeah she's right and i was like\nhold on and he was like well she's sort\nof right he's like this is what's\nhappening you have a mucous layer\nmembrane in your throat that's it keeps\nit moist keeps germs from being able to\nbreak the break through the barrier and\nso they get trapped they go to your\nstomach they're killed by the acid or\nwhatever and he said but if you get a\ncrack in that then the the bacteria\nvirus can actually get into your\nbloodstream and that's how you get sick\nand it's just drying her throat out and\ni was like\nwhoa and it was one of those moments\nwhere i was like how many wives tales\nare true like directionally they're not\naccurate but they're true if that's what\ni mean yes and so that's how i think\nwhen you think of a book that's lasted\nas long as it as it has and i know you\nand i we've never talked about this but\nwe share a real fascination for\nstorytelling yes because it's a way to\nconvey an idea\nthat resonates emotionally and allows\npeople to carry it on and pass it on and\nobviously this all starts long before we\nhave science and can prove any of this\nbut we see the patterns we need a way to\nencapsulate the pattern we encapsulate\nit in a story the story is in and of\nitself totally fake\nbut now in a modern context we're\ngetting lost in that the the story is\nfake even though the take-home message\nis incredibly powerful yes and so as i i\nmean it's the classic story right the\nmore you learn the less you realize you\nknow\nand just as i've gotten older and really\nstarted to understand the stuff and read\nas much as i do and quite frankly live\nand suffer and go through things like my\nwife having microbiome issues and at\nfirst thinking her all of her\ndescriptions make absolutely no sense\nand then you stop passing a judgment on\nit and start saying what if everything\nshe's saying is actually true like what\nhow would we treat it then right\nabsolutely and so there is something\nreally fascinating there now i find\nmyself i'm way more emotionally drawn to\nthe science because when i can picture\nit i have a much easier time doing\nsomething about it so when you were\ntalking about the things that you\nlearned from meditation\ni've gotten tremendous value out of\nmeditation but it's nothing like what\nyou've learned so\nfor me it was once i understood that\ndiaphragm breathing made sense because\nit triggers the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem then because i understood it it\nlike was the understanding becomes a\nforce multiplier absolutely all right\nlet's talk about behavioral science\nself-awareness\nwatching your content which\nhave you ever looked at how much content\nyou've put out no it's a lot dude like\nwhen you search your name like to go\nbecause i normally try to watch like\nbasically everything and i was like i\ngive up\nit's just it's really incredible um\nand going through that stuff it seems\nreally clear to me that you have massive\nself-awareness\nand\nwhat would you say like is a is there a\nprocess for people to gain more\nself-awareness and then what are from a\nbehavioral um\n[Music]\nyou know just human behavior level what\nare things that trip up the average\nperson the first answer i mean i'm a\nhuge fan of the book thinking fast and\nslow i don't know how if you've read it\nyeah it's a great book because for me\nit's got a really close pattern\nconnection again to what i studied so\njust understanding system one and system\ntwo if anyone watching hasn't read it i\nhighly recommend it just being able to\ndifferentiate between system one and\nsystem two as daniel kahneman calls it\nin the vedic philosophy we call\ndifferentiating between the mind and the\nintelligence\nknowing how to differentiate the voices\nin your head is the first level of\nself-awareness so break down what system\none and system two are absolutely so\nsystem one is your initial response to\nanything that happens it's a stop that i\ncan't really say so if you say something\ni don't like\nmy system one naturally would be a face\nthat i pull that i don't agree with that\nthat's that's an understanding of what\nsystem one is it's your initial\ndefault reaction in the moment that can\nbe positive often for example if someone\npulls out a knife you feel scared and\nyou run that system one that's a good\nthing it's it's safe for you but also\nsystem one is someone says something\nthat hurts your ego and you start\ndefending yourself immediately that's\nalso that's a negative of system one\nthat we would refer to as the mind it's\nbuilt up of conditioning those responses\nare conditioned those default elements\nare all there because of habit and\ncontinuous practice\nthe system two is more like the\nintelligence what i would say is more\nlike the parent if you can consider\nsystem one to be more like a child\nsystem two is more like a parent it\nlooks more at the long term it looks\nmore at the bigger picture it processes\nthat default reaction through a set of\nchecking and metrics to decide whether\nthat's true the child is the the one\nthat wants everything right away\nimpatient quickly responding straight\naway\nreacting when it doesn't get what he\nwants\nthe intelligent parent and good one\nknows what the child wants and needs and\nwhat's better for in the long term\njust starting there\nand being able to reflect and observe\nthe different voices inside of us is a\ngreat place to start your self-awareness\nbecause the biggest challenge is that\nmost of us don't know what we're\nlistening to and we don't most of us\ndon't even know that there are more than\none voice inside of us\njust getting over that line is a huge\nwin\nbecause now at least you're trying to\ndifferentiate\nin what you're hearing and that's going\nto help you make better decisions in the\nfuture so that was answer one does that\nanswer your question oh yes and second\none was what um\nso that's awareness how can what are\nlike typical things that trip people up\nthat so\nin your answer just now it's like okay\nif you want to become more aware just\nknow that those two things are happening\nright you're gonna have an initial\nresponse and then one that's more\ncalculated\nnow be aware of these two or three\nthings that are also coming for you\nthe biggest challenge is that there's\njust so much noise\nit's like have you ever had someone in\nyour home maybe it's your wife or maybe\nit's a friend or whatever just play a\nreally bad song too often right just\nplaying a song that you really don't\nactually heard my wife laugh because she\nknows how guilty she's right okay there\nyou go right there you go and you just\nplay a song and just think oh turn that\noff and after a while it's been on for\nso long that you you become immune to it\nlike it's just there and it's still on\nit's there in the back of your mind and\nyou didn't manage to turn it off so the\nnoise that i describe in life whether\nit's your parents expectations whether\nit's\nsociety's expectations whether it's your\npartner's expectations all of those are\nlike noise in the background and that\nnoise drowns out\nyour ability to understand\nthe mind and the intelligence that's one\nof the biggest trip ups i was looking at\ni gave a presentation called build a\nlife not a resume it's also one of my\npopular videos\nbut very good video thank you man thank\nyou so much and when i did the research\nso you don't see this in the video\nbecause this research didn't make it\ninto the video but the research that i\nwas doing was around the most common\nresume lies the truth is over 40 to 50\npercent of us lie on our resumes yeah if\nyou don't you're missing an opportunity\ni'll just say that yeah there you go\nright so and and i started to dig deeper\nand i was looking at you know a lot of\npeople lie about their dates of\nemployment so instead of three days it's\nnow three months you know whatever it\nmay be now i dug deeper and i wanted to\nmeet some of these people and speak to\npeople and so i spoke to people who lie\non their resumes and we know that at\nleast 40 to 50 percent tell us they do\nyou know the thing is no one was proud\nof that\nno one was like yeah yeah i know i'm\ngonna get really what it came down to is\nwe're really insecure about our own\nabilities\nreally what it came down to is we're not\nconfident about what we have to offer\nwhat it came down to is a lack of\nself-awareness what it came down to is a\nlack of understanding what am i good at\nwhat am i passionate about what am i\nbringing to the table\nthat's what people were really worried\nabout\nthey were worried about the job but when\nyou dug beneath the surface the real\nbehavioral trait that was coming out was\ninsecurity and being unconfident\nabout one's potential that that tells us\na lot that indicates a lot about human\nbehavior and human nature that the noise\nfrom outside\nmakes us want to fit into a container\nand that stops us from differentiating\nbetween what is my mind saying and what\nis my intelligence saying and what\nhappens is that noise becomes your voice\nso that noise becomes what you think is\nwhat you're saying\nand most people don't realize that until\n10 20 30 years down the line how the\nhell do you like figure out so your\nanalogy is great yeah song's on you\ndon't even realize it's there anymore it\nbecomes total white noise you're\noblivious to it in fact you'll only\nnotice it if it gets turned off correct\nso how do they identify that like do you\nhave a process for that how do you hear\nthe thing that you no longer hear\nso that you can shut it off yeah\nabsolutely one of the biggest ones and\nwe say this all the time but it applies\nmostly to this is switching your\nassociation\nis switching association to people that\nyou hang out\nright it's like changing your circle\nbecause if you're only hearing the same\nthing from that circle the only way to\nturn it off without you having to do\nmass amounts of reflection\nis changing your circle where you start\nhearing we all ultimately find the\nthings we want to hear right we know\nthat\nthe challenge is that we think\nthings come with emotions\nfeelings we think things come with\nfeelings and emotions and guess what\nthey don't so if you chase money well\nthey might for a moment right or they\nwon't\ni don't think they even do also it's\nsuch a false sense of feeling i don't\nknow maybe for a moment but it's so\nshort-lived that it's it's not even\nworth counting almost so it's like when\nyou\nwhen you think that i'm chasing money\nguess what you will get money yep and\nthat's great money is really important\nand money is a really important resource\nbut guess what money is not now going to\nfill that gap that void that feeling\nthat emotion that you're missing in your\nlife what are most people missing\nwe're missing a deep sense of love i\nthink i think the biggest need in the\nworld as we've heard many times before\nfrom all the ancient texts they they\nsummarize it like this to love and be\nloved like that is the need of humanity\nto love and be loved and when we don't\nexperience that we then start looking\nfor status we then start looking for\nmoney then we then start looking for\nrecognition just to help us give the\nfeeling of false sense of love correct\nand the challenge is because most of us\ndidn't experience that from our parents\nand this is the key thing\nwhat we crave in life\nis what we did or didn't get from our\nparents what our parents did give us is\nwhat we continue to crave what they\ndidn't give us is what we continue to\ncrave so you'll find that most people's\nlove languages that they chase\nare things that their parents didn't\ngive them so if their parents didn't\ngive them time they now crave everyone's\ntime if their parents didn't give them\ngifts they'd crave gifts if their\nparents didn't give them\nacts of service they're craving those\nacts of service so it's because of our\nchildhood\nand if we don't learn\nto process all of that experience which\nmost people never get the time to do and\ni empathize with that because i've had\nto go through that i've seen me\nrepeating my parents patterns i've seen\nsomething you were craving so i would\ncrave a big thing for me was i would\ncrave surprises and gifts because that's\nyour thing yeah that's my thing still\nit's your thing it's still my favorite\nyeah and and i did your parents not do\nthat for you no they did my mom did a\nlot of it that's why you're still quiet\ncorrect so my mom would always every\nyear on my birthday\nshe'd always surprised me with the one\nthing i wanted and i wasn't support\ngrowing up i didn't have a lot growing\nup but she would get that one thing\nwhether it was like a power rangers toy\nor whether it was whatever it was you\nknow something yeah yeah things you want\nas a kid right and she would always\nsurprise me with that and that became so\ndeep rooted now i'll give you an example\nwhen i then married my wife\nyou just expect people to know that that\nthey're gonna do the same thing totally\nactually\nno because i'm expecting my wife to be\nlike my mom in the sense of i expected a\nsurprise or show me love in the same way\nand she doesn't know that she's not a\nmind reader i can't explain expect her\nto know that so it took communication it\ntook time for me to explain that so\nanyway i think that's where it stems\nfrom that desire\nit doesn't come from any you can say it\ncomes from society and education of\ncourse it does but i think the deepest\nplace it comes is what your parents did\nor didn't give you that's that's where\nit comes from yeah now this was really\ncool i think uh right now there's a lot\nof anxiety there's a lot of concern\nthere's a lot of fear in the world with\ncoronavirus and just\npeople concerned in general of the chaos\nof their life whether it's gronovirus or\nanything else that's happening people\nseem to live in this fear state of mind\nright now a lot\nyou talked about the fear of fear and\nhow you had to learn to let go of your\nfear of fear what does actually mean\nletting go of the fear of fear yeah so i\ntalk about how we fear the wrong things\nhow do we fear so most of us are fearful\nof how our friends are reacting what's\nhappening on social media and what's the\nrandom bit of news that we heard\nnone of it is fact based that's one of\nthe biggest issues worry-based it's\nworry-based and it's also imagination\nbased so we become fiction writers we've\nall watched too many movies now we start\nwriting these beautiful movies in our\nhead we're not beautiful scary movies in\nour head of what may happen so our\nimagination and seneca said it best we\nsuffer twice one in reality and one in\nimagination right we suffer twice and\nthis is what actually happens to us\nin the story we continue to tell totally\nnow there's this incredible study in the\nbook that i have to talk about so they\ntook monks and they took non-monks and\nthey\ncompeted against each other\nso they put this plate where you\nexperience heat\nand so what happens is the non-monks\ntouch this plate now this plate heats up\ngradually\nsoftly and then at one point it gets\nreally hot for 10 seconds and it cools\ndown and so what happened is that when\nthe non-monks touched it\nthe anxiety and pressure and stress in\ntheir brain just triggered straight away\neven though it wasn't that hot it wasn't\nhard it was heating but it wasn't hard\nto do anything major to you but the\nanxiety and stress in imagination or in\nanticipation went through the roof in\nthe non-monks now this is what's\nfascinating when the monks touched it\nthey showed that it didn't feel anything\nas it rose but as it got to its highest\nthey felt physical pain\nbut they showed no trigger of emotional\npain because they did not assign any\nemotional\nelement to that pain so my point with\nthat is\nyou can look at the news right now\nand you can get scared straight away\nand get incomplete freeze mode feeling\nstuck paralyzed whatever it is because\nwhat you're now doing is you're creating\na story of what's going to happen\nand that story and you can cause\nsickness in yourself you can question\njust by the story so not actually the\nreality that the facts of the disease\nhitting you or\nsomething happening physically to you\ntotally and that story again can be used\npositively so your story may actually be\ntrue\nbut if it's going to be true now you can\nprepare and that shifts you away from\nbeing scared because now you're\npreparing and so the real you can be\nconfident because you're prepared\nexactly and so we should be shifting our\nfear energy\ninto preparation energy because what\nfear does is it keeps you locked there\nright we just feel stuck i'll give you\nan example when you were preparing for\nbig games when you used to play in the\nnfl right and you're playing american\nfootball against some of the biggest\nathletes in the world\nit's like you can either sit there and\nbe scared that you're going to play this\ngame on the weekend or you can prepare\nand your confidence is in the\npreparation so when people go how do i\nfeel confident right now\nare you preparing are you putting the\nreps are you putting the wraps are you\nbuilding your immunity are you taking\nyour vitamins are you drinking lots of\nwater are you drinking lots of water are\nyou taking the steps that are needed to\nprepare for whatever's coming you will\nfeel more confident that way yeah so how\ndo we\nlearn to let go of the fear of fear\nthough like how do we say okay we're\nonly going to allow it to hurt us when\nit actually hurts us and not the fear of\nit is there a process is there just an\nawareness of this that when you're in\nanxiety worry stress fear\nyou you just breathe and meditate then\nwhat's the process of letting go of the\nfear of fear yeah so meditation\nmindfulness powerful tools but i'd say\nthe process and i want to be as tactical\nand strategic as we can the thing is to\nget really close\nto that fear so what we usually do is\nraise it embrace it get close to get\nintimate with it we become the bat\nwe're in\nwe run away from fear we like to run\naway and go oh it's not coming with me\nand or what we do is we hear one thing\nand we define the whole understanding of\nour fear based on that one thing so it's\nlike someone and i'll give you a normal\nexample in a normal life scenario\nsomeone says to you in the office\nyou know that you know that they're\ngoing to cut a few people\nand you don't even check you don't even\nknow and now you just made it real and\nnow you're running with it and you're\ntrying to run away from it so you're\ntrying to avoid conversations with your\nboss you're trying to avoid any conflict\nyou're trying to you know you're just\nthinking you're just trying to avoid it\nand so actually what you need to do is\ngo okay let me actually\ndiscover that fear let me go intimate\nwith that fear let me ask myself where's\nthat fear coming from\nwhat am i really scared of\nwhat am i really scared of am i really\nscared of losing my job am i scared of\nnot having any money what am i really\nscared of and when you get to the root\nand i call it the y ladder in the book\nso it's asking yourself\nwhat am i scared of and then go why am i\nscared of this\nwhy am i scared of this why am i scared\nof this and when you can't ask why any\nlonger\nyou've got to the answer and that's what\nyou have to deal with most of us are not\ndealing with what we're actually scared\nof so that's how you let go you let go\nby keep asking yourself so i'll give an\nexample of mine\nlike if if i heard that or if you hear\nthat in your office that people are\ngetting cut it's like you just get\nscared and panicked but the question is\nwhy am i scared of that am i scared of\nthat because i haven't been working hard\nfor six months am i scared of that\nbecause i've been skipping meetings am i\nscared of that because i know my boss\nwill probably fire me first\nor am i scared because i've been\nperforming really well and i'm expecting\na promotion\nknowing which one it is sets you up to\nbuild the path forward not knowing that\njust puts you in this panic frenzy i\nthink also like doing all the things you\ntalked about which is discovering within\nyourself being aware of it but then also\njust have the conversation\nrun it with your manager your boss and\nsay hey listen i heard some rumors that\nthere might be some cuts and i want to\nlet you know that i'm 100 committed to\ndoing whatever it takes to help this\ncompany grow yes\ni believe in this mission more than\nanything\nhere's what i've been doing the last\nthree months and here's what i want to\ncontinue to do is there anything else i\ncan do totally like show them to like\nwhy you shouldn't get cut exactly and\nthat's you know how to approach that\ndiscussion when you know\nwhich side you're on yeah what your fear\nis i remember as a freshman playing\nfootball i was playing division two\nfootball minnesota they usually redshirt\nall the freshmen\nand i went into this with a big ego\nthinking like i'm gonna start or at\nleast i want to play right so i went\ninto it with an ego in the first place\nbut i also which wasn't good but i also\nwent into it with some things that were\ngood from this conversation i told the\ncoach straight up like i know you don't\nplay freshman but my intention is to\nplay\nwhat is it going to take for me in order\nto get on the field\nyou know\ndo i need to get her early do i need to\nstay late can i sit here in the office\nwith you after the uh uh before practice\nand go over game film whatever it was\nand he was he told me yeah i need you to\ncome in the office every single day and\nwatch game film with me i need to be\nwith your receiver coach every single\nday beforehand and doing reps and i just\ndid it and i eventually started to play\nmy freshman year i didn't start in the\nbeginning but i started to start at the\nends\nand that for me it was powerful it's\nlike i dressed it because i wanted to\nplay and i was afraid i wasn't going to\nplay at all and just waste a year of\npracticing like every other freshman\nwould do there that was my ego going\nlike i need to play but i was also like\ni'll do whatever it takes and i'll\npractice and i'll confront it with\nconversation and say this is my\nintention this is my vision and i'm\ngonna do whatever it takes for you\nand so i think that\nthat's a perfect example yeah you're in\na workplace you've got to be confronting\nit and be proactive in your company\ncorrect and that's a perfect example of\ngetting close to fear rather than\nrunning away from it spot on man for me\nmy whole mission in the last year in\nmoving forward the next projects i'm\nworking on are all about belief in\nyourself i believe self-doubt is the\nkiller of dreams\nand i believe that\nand you have this amazing graph in here\nit's about ego\nversus self-esteem how do we build\nself-belief self-esteem self-confidence\nwhile also not allowing our ego to be so\nbig and think we can just do anything\nhow do we balance ego and\nself-confidence so they don't\nhurt each other yeah absolutely and what\nwe experience most of the time\nis extremes\nso the two extremes that most of us\nexperience are either i have to think\ni'm the best i'm the best in the world i\ncan crush anyone like i'm like gonna\nshow everyone what i'm like or most of\nus experience the other extreme which is\ni'm the worst\ni'm the stupidest i'm the dumbest i'm\nthe most worthless i'm the biggest loser\nnotice how that's both ego\nyes why is the negative so the ego wants\nto be the best of the best\nor the ego wants to be the worst of the\nworst the ego won't accept being in the\nmiddle really the ego wants to feel the\ndeepest sense of being the lowest and\nthat's why victim mentality is actually\na\nsubsequence of ego really yeah that's\nhow it's explained in the bhagavad-gita\nbecause the point is that you can't deal\nwith just being bad you have to be the\nworst my pain is the worst i think um\njada talked about this on your podcast\nwhere she was like\nyou know i had to tell people why my\nhurt was\nmore painful than their hurt and they\ncould never understand how bad it was\nexactly exactly right yeah that's ego as\nwell so you see these two sides of ego\nkeeping us locked away\nand so the only way to get with that and\nthe only way to balance it and bring it\nall into one is genuine self-honesty\nhonesty is the best place to be the best\nthing about honesty is i'm really good\nat this i'm really average of that and\ni'm really bad at that\nand the challenge we have with that is\nmost of us have no idea we just have\nzero self-awareness about what we are\ngood at what we are better than what\nwe're average at so we think i'm pretty\naverage at everything i'm pretty good at\neverything and when i hear those answers\ni'm like simple things just go and talk\nto people that know you yeah what am i\ngreat at awesome what's my superpower\nwhat do i do differently what do you\nthink i do that is different than no one\nelse does and guess what i guarantee you\nif you ask a colleague if you ask a\nfriend if you ask a family member if you\nask people\nthey'll say different things but you get\nto learn about yourself so real\nconfidence comes from knowing your\nstrengths and going all in on them\nyour confidence does not come from\njust standing up the right way or just\nsaying the right stuff to yourself\nyeah that's and that's important i i'm a\nbig believer in all of that but what i'm\nsaying is that that doesn't build real\nconfidence real confidence comes from\nthinking i'm really good at this i know\ni can do this and i love doing it and\nreally this is the most important bit\nconfidence comes from serving other\npeople when you see the impact you have\non others and this is the biggest issue\nthe reason why we have such low\nself-esteem today\nin the world is because people are not\nserving others so they don't see the\nprofound impact they have on others when\nyou put out a video or a podcast and\npeople tag you on instagram and they say\nlouis you stop me from depression or you\nhelp me out of a divorce or people when\nthey watch my content they'll be like\nthat stopped me from committing suicide\nor whatever it is when you see that\nyou get such a deep sense of self-worth\nthat you matter and guess what everyone\nmatters whether you matter to one people\nor one million people everyone matters\nbut if you see your impact on someone's\nlife you will feel such a deep sense of\nself-worth and so whether you're serving\nat a\ngiving out free food or whether you're\nserving at a local charity place or\nwhether you're serving through your work\nserve serve serve because when you take\nthat step you you get a boost of\nself-esteem but why do so many of us\nlive in fear and desire mode as opposed\nto duty and love mode\nwhy is that like why we still focus on\nself as opposed to service it's\nconditioned it's conditioned right i've\nsaid this before that we're wired for\ngenerosity but we're educated for greed\ni think i just said it to you two\nit's like and when i said that and the\nstatement it was yeah and it's so true\nwe're wired for generosity but we're\neducated for greed because what happens\nis when we're kids\nyou'll see kids you want to share go out\ntheir way they want to share part of my\ncandy bar whatever right yeah and then\nas we get older we're told\nthat there's less and this is what the\nkey is as we get older we're told there\nare finite numbers\nof how many kids get made on the\nbasketball baseball team yes we're told\nthere's a finite number of college\nspaces we're told there's a finite\nnumber of how many tickets there are\nwe're told there's a finite number of\npeople that are successful guess what\nin the theater of happiness there are\ninfinite and unlimited seats and there\nis a seat with your name on it\nthere is a seat with your name on it in\nthe theater of dreams in the theater of\nhappiness but you think that because you\nthink that there are only a hundred\npeople allowed in that if someone else\nmakes it before you that you don't get\nin and guess what is there a cap on how\nmany billionaires there are in the world\nno no is there a cap on how many\nmillionaires around the world no is\nthere a cap on how many happy people\nthere are in the world no and that's why\ni really am encouraging forms i want\nforbes forget printing of rich lists\nwe should do that we should do that\nserving the most in the world wow\nthat'll be competition based yeah yeah\nsure i gave more than you get and that's\nwhy it should be serviced based on time\nenergy and money because we should start\nshowing how much time people give how\nmuch energy people give mother teresa i\ndon't think she gave any money to her\ncharities right but you get a lot of\ntime and energy yeah you know you look\nat all the people who made a change in\nthe world martin luther king gandhi like\nthey may not have given a lot of money\nto stuff they gave time and energy you\ndon't have to give resources but your\nresourcefulness your love your time your\nfocus your attention your compassion\nlove that uh you know resourcefulness of\nthe of the heart not of the wallet\ni think i love that and you don't need\nto have a lot of money to make a big\nimpact you don't there's and and this is\nthe training see we've been educated for\ngreed because we've been told\neverything's limited\nthere's limited number of this limited\nnumber of this number and every time you\nplay in numbers and i think it was bob\nmarley who said it every time you play\nin numbers you'd always be dissatisfied\nbecause guess what someone's always\nsaying someone's always gonna have more\ni was speaking to a friend recently\nand and it's me and and this friend was\ntelling me that\nhe\nuh you know bought a home which is very\nexpensive very very expensive and he\nwent to a party at someone else's house\nand he told me that when he was getting\na tour of this party he found out that\nthis person had a painting on his wall\nwhich cost the amount his house cost\nand so he was joking he was like that\nthat guy's painting in the house he's\ngot my house on his wall wow and and\nthat just puts things into perspective\nand you think about that like and then\nyou look at something like jeff bezos\nand you think oh well he's the richest\nman in the world but does he have the\nmost fame\nno he doesn't\ndoes he have the most beauty\nsubjective decision does he have the\nmost\nstrength or power maybe not and so no\none has the most of everything\nso when you measure yourself by numbers\nyou'll always be second third fourth\nfifth in something and i think by\nmeasuring yourself by\nneeding to have the most of anything is\nprobably a recipe for unhappiness i'm\nlike well okay i'm not gonna have the\nmost of anything but i'm gonna have the\nmost money you're still gonna be unhappy\neven if you have the most of something\ndoesn't mean you're gonna be happy\ntotally i think it was albert einstein\nwho said it best that\nnot everything\nthat can be counted counts\nand not everything that counts can be\ncounted\nand and i love that because it removes\nthis belief that things are finite and\nlimited and they're not if you want to\nbe happy and successful if no matter\nthat there are 700 000 podcasts\nif that is your dharma if that's your\ncalling if that's your purpose\nlike you can do that there's no cap on\non how many successful\nsoccer players that can exist at the\nsame time or how many books are out in\nthe world there's no cap there's no one\nstopping you and that's the mindset that\nwe're educated for that scarcity and\ngreed and what's the difference between\nthe monkey mind and the monk mind yeah\ni'm glad you brought that out so the\nmonkey mind is what we experience on a\nday-to-day basis the monkey mind is\nrestless the monkey mind is jumping from\nbranch to branch the monkey mind's\ntrying to find a bigger banana the\nmonkey mind is constantly just like\nfeeling flustered\ndissatisfied\nscarce and overthinking everything\nthe monk mind is the exact opposite the\nmonk mind is calm and composed among my\nknows to be focused and aware among my\nnose so everything in this book and\neverything that we're talking about is\nthe transformation from the monkey mind\nthat we experience\nto the monk mind the monkey mind is\nalmost the enemy to the monk mind it's\nthe opposite yes\nthe monks start with identity and at the\nroot of the issue because a lot of what\nwe experienced in the world today as you\nknow and and i know how holistic you are\nin the way you advise your patients when\nyou were speaking on my podcast i was so\nimpressed by you\nand how you're able to tie in so many\npsychological and natural practices and\nrelational exercises that can improve\npeople's health and well-being overall i\nremember you talking about encouraging\nyour clients to see more friends as a\nway of\nchanging the way they feel and i was\nthinking wow this person's got so many\ngreat ideas and the reason is because\nrangan you also have that monk mindset\nor you go to the root of the issue it's\nreally easy to just say oh well just\ntake two of these a day or try this or\nyou know maybe you need to do this but\nwhen you think about it from the root\nperspective where do our challenges\narise and our challenges arise by how we\nsee ourselves\nand what i believe rangan's referring to\nis there's this quote that i begin my\nbook with and that i've shared in\ninterviews for the last few years and\nit's from a writer named charles horton\ncooley who wrote this in the 1900s and\nwhat he said is that\nsorry i think it's in the 1800s at the\nend of the 1800s towards the 1900s and\nhe said and and bear with me and you've\ngot to really listen closely to this so\nwhat he said that the challenge today is\ni'm not what i think i am\ni'm not what you think i am\ni am what i think you think i am\nnow just let that blow your mind for a\nmoment i will explain it i promise i'm\nnot what i think i am i'm not what you\nthink i am i am what i think you think i\nam which means\nwe live in a perception of a perception\nof ourselves so i'll break it down if i\nthink\nrangan thinks i'm smart i'll say i feel\nsmart\nbut if i think rangan thinks i'm not\nsmart then i'll say i'm not smart\nand so the challenge is that we're\nbasing how we feel about ourselves on\nwhat we think someone thinks of us\nand and the greatest challenge with that\nis how do you have any idea if what you\nthink someone thinks about you is even\ntrue and whether that's even the best\nplace to start so that's where our\nidentity struggles we start pursuing\nthings in life because we think other\npeople value them it's almost like let's\nthink of the most playground version of\nthis\nif i remember wearing high-tech shoes\nfrom bhs to the playground right i\nremember my mom because my parents\ndidn't buy me nike uh trainers or adidas\ntrainers which i always wanted you know\nwe didn't come from that background i\ncouldn't i couldn't afford them and my\nparents didn't want me to have them so\ni'd walk in with my high tech trainers\nfrom bhs they were about 10 quid or\nwhatever they were\nand and and you know to me\nit didn't make a difference i didn't\nreally know at that time whether\nhigh-tech was good or bad they were just\ntrainers that my parents bought me now\neveryone the cool kid at school had the\nlatest nike trainers all of a sudden i\nstart thinking\nthat he's now surrounded by everyone\neveryone's talking about his trainers\neveryone's giving him adoration\neveryone's giving him respect everyone's\ntalking about his trainers\nso now i think that if i want to have\nthat same experience and love from\npeople that i need to get that\nnot realizing that i may be able to get\ndeeper love from people\nby being kind and compassionate that i\nmay actually be able to build a real\nrelationship with people if i'm loving\nand and considerate and empathetic and\nit's so crazy how your life can become\nabout pursuing something and that's why\njim carrey puts it best and i'm\nparaphrasing he says you know everyone\nin the world should achieve everything\nthey've ever wanted and accomplish\neverything they've ever pursued\njust to realize that it's not the point\nnow that doesn't mean the monk mindset\nis not about not pursuing your goals\nit's actually about pursuing your truest\ngoals your truest self and your most\nauthentic aligned goals so it's not\nabout not having goals it's about making\nsure that your goals are actually yours\nyeah and\nyou know i get shivers\nwhen you say that cooley quotes oh me\ntoo\nand i think i've had it i've had a\nflashback i think\ni can't say for sure where it was when i\nheard that interview but i think i was\non a train from manchester to london or\nlondon back to manchester\nand i think i pressed pause and i think\ni wrote it in my notes i think i'm\npretty sure i wrote it and i i rewound\nit i played it and i thought hold on\ni've got the first part\nthe second part what's that third part i\nreally had to sit with it for a while\nand i would urge people if they need to\npress pause right now\nlisten to it and really think about it\nand i think\nyou know it's really interesting\nyou know hearing that\nand i reflect on my children who i know\nyou had a very brief lovely conversation\nwith just before we started i might put\nthat in at the end of the podcast maybe\nit was beautiful\nbut i i think about this as\nthey go through school and\nyou know they start to see what other\npeople have got\nand you know\num we my wife and i were very keen to\ntry and not put value on those things\nbecause\ni know i also had experiences like that\nwhen i see oh god man they're wearing\nthose things i want to wear those\nbecause if i wear them i'm going to be\nhappy\ni saw a\nmaybe a year ago or so i saw a gary\nvaynerchuk video online when he was um\ntelling someone at one of his\nconferences he was\nyou know he was talking about a bmw and\nhe basically said to the guy in his in\nin you know in his inimitable way which\nis wonderful\num that i think you own a bmw\nbecause of what other people will think\nof you when you drive that bmw\nand\nthe guy literally you know in that clip\nhe just sort of sat with it and he said\nyeah i do i mean it's what it symbolized\nis to to people around him and again i'm\nnot having to go anyone who who might be\ndoing that you know we all do things\nat times to get that um that validation\nor what we think is a validation from\npeople around them but i think\nwhat you're trying to get at is how do\nwe find our own identity how do we live\nour own lives so\nso jay how do we do that if we've spent\na lifetime living someone else's life\nhow do we in our 30s or our 20s or our\n40s or our 50s how did we just decide oh\ni'm going to start finding out what my\nlife is\nyes absolutely and and i love the tone\nyou're sharing this in rangan because my\ntone's the same like you know i'm not\ni'm not coming at this from a point of\nview of\nyou know we're wasting our lives or i've\ngot it figured out like i i\ndon't want to make this about you not\ngetting your goals or not having\npursuits or not wanting to become\nsomething because i want to do all those\nthings too but it's about why you're\ndoing it and it's also about making sure\nthey're truly motivated by your inner\ndesire right like that's the point it's\nlike if you want to drive a bmw drive a\nbmw because that's the car you love\ndon't drive it because you think\nif you want to be a doctor become a\ndoctor because you think that's how\nyou're going to serve humanity not\nbecause you think people will be\nimpressed if you want to go to harvard\nor princeton or oxford or cambridge go\nthere because you really want to study\nhow to solve the world's problems not\nbecause you think it looks good on your\nresume right that's the point that we're\ngoing after so thank you ranga for like\nre-centering that that tonal piece and i\ni appreciate it so where do we start one\nof my favorite ways to start is looking\nat what we value\nand values are a very intangible word\nand so there's a very easy way to figure\nout what you value there's two things\nyou have to look at\nyou look at how you spend your money the\nmost painful thing you can possibly do\ngo through your bank statement and look\nat where your money is being spent that\nis what you value\nthe other thing that we spend just like\nwe spend money\nis how we spend our time\nthose are the two most perfect ways to\nsee what you currently value your value\nisn't what's in your head isn't what's\nin your heart it isn't what's in your\nmind it's how you spend your money and\nhow you spend your time and so just to\ngive you an overview and i share this in\nthe book that research was done on how\nwe spend our time\nand the research showed that we spent 33\nyears in bed right 33 years of our life\nin bed and seven years of that is spent\ntrying to sleep not even sleeping right\nwe spend one year and four months\nexercising across our whole lives these\nare by the way we spend more than three\nyears on vacation\nand we spend a bunch of days trying to\nget ready and we spend a bunch of time\nyou know standing in lines and queues\nand so much of our time just gets spent\nso the question we have to ask ourselves\nis\nwhere am i currently spending my time\nand where do i want to spend it now\nstudies also show\nthat people everyone has to go to work\nso this isn't about what you do for work\npeople who had more meaningful\npurposeful lives and more healthier\nwealthier and wise\ninvest their time in education over\nentertainment\nand rung and your your audience is lucky\nbecause they get education and\nentertainment in one place but but\nthat's the goal right like that's the\ngoal that you're creating an opportunity\nfor people to find education\nthe the smartest the wealthiest the most\nhealthiest the wisest people in the\nworld reading books watching\ndocumentaries taking courses listening\nto podcasts learning to better\nthemselves\nand so that's the first place to start\nthe second place when we look at that\nvalue audit\nis i want you to write down three things\nthat you're currently pursuing in life\nit might be a promotion it might be a\nnew home whatever it is whatever it is\nthat you are currently pursuing\nand then i want you to ask this question\nis that your desire and your dream\nor is it coming from something outside\nof you is it coming from a pressure of a\nfamily member is it coming from an\nexpectation because your friend just\nbought something where is that desire\ntruly coming from\nand the third and final question you\nwant to ask yourself is do i still want\nto pursue that or do i want to change\nhow i pursue it\nor do i not want to pursue it at all and\nif you go through that three-step\nquestioning process you'll get to the\ntruth of what you truly want to pursue\nand stop yourselves from building a sand\ncastle which the waves of time will\neventually wash away\nand so that's what we get lost doing we\nget lost building castles that we don't\neven want to live in\nyeah\nit's so profound\nand you know i really think that there's\nsomething\nunique about the times in which we live\nnow there really is this dissatisfaction\nthis lack of contentment\nyou know you put it so beautifully at\nthe start of this conversation i don't\nknow if you've seen the documentary\nminimalism\nor not which\ni think you'd absolutely love it i i\nreally really enjoy it i've seen it a\ncouple of times i've watched it with my\nkids again recently but again it's these\ntwo guys in their 30s who you know\nthey've got success by society's\ndefinition they've got the job they're\nearning good money\nyou know but there's a hole inside\nthere's a feeling of\nis this all there is to life\nand so i really think you're tapping on\nsomething that is that is really out\nthere at the moment and really\nif people can get their heads around\nthis i think it can transform their own\nlives but also transform the lives of\nthe people around them which i think is\nreally really exciting now you call it a\nvalue audit\nand i thought that word was really\ninteresting because\ni have been sort of\ni had i had sort of nearly three weeks\noff social media until two days ago like\ni didn't post i went offer i made a\nthing of it and\ni found that i\ni found it a lot easier to go inward in\nmy life it was just one thing to switch\noff a bit of noise for me\nthat i i'm not saying everyone has to do\nthis it's just something i personally\nfind useful i also like to\ni think it's a nice example to set to\npeople that you can do it uh if you want\nto\nbut what was really interesting is i've\nbeen doing a values exercise with myself\ni've been trying to write down five core\nvalues that i\nwant to live my life by and it really\nstruck me\nthat a lot of people and i've probably\nincluded myself in this\nhave got an idea of what we think our\nvalues are\nbut unless we actually go and audit the\nprocess of what are we spending our time\nand money doing we have no idea if we\nreally are living those values so i\nreally like the term audit because\nit's not your perception of how you\nthink you're actually spending your\nmoney or spending your time it's the\nreality of it and i think it's something\nthat\ni haven't done it and i think\ni think i'm going to do it i think i\nwould actually see oh is it aligned with\nwhat you say you stand for are you\nactually spending time like that so is\nthis a common thing do you think for\npeople that they have a there's that\nthere is a gap between their desired\nvalues\nand their actual values i genuinely\nbelieve first of all ranga thank you for\nsharing that too and i i genuinely\nbelieve\nthat people are well intentioned and\nwant to do good in the world i believe\nthat i believe that people have a good\nheart they're smarter than we think they\nare they want to do good in the world\nand they want to put out good energy but\nyou're exactly right that\nthat intention needs to be converted and\ntransferred into real behavior and this\nis where you'll find you know you'll\nhear a friend or someone you know say oh\nyou know i really value loyalty\nand and i really don't like gossip and\nthen you find out that that person was\ngossiping about you and how does that\nfeel it completely feels like someone's\nbroken your trust and so often the way\nwe see ourselves or want to see\nourselves is amplified compared to how\nwe actually behave so we'll spot\nsomething and there's a there's a\nbeautiful story that i share\nin the book and there's lots of these\nacross the book\nbut there's these there's these old\nancient indian and zen stories and\nthere's this story of the\nevil king that goes to meet a good king\nso the evil king goes to the the castle\nthe quarters of the good king and the\ngood king being a good king invites the\nevil king inside for some dinner they\nsit down these servers bring out the\nplates the plates are placed in front of\nthe evil king and the good king\nand they're just about to eat\nand as just about as they're about to\neat the evil king\nswitches the place\nand and the good king goes\nwhat's going on like is that some\nceremony in your time like why are we\ndoing this\nand the evil king goes well i don't know\nyou might have poisoned my food\nyou you might be trying to kill me you\nmight have poisoned it and the good king\njust passed out laughing he's just like\nreally like come on this like i've\ninvited you for dinner like this is my\nteam like you know whatever it is like\nlet's start eating right now and just\nabout he's about to eat\nthe evil king swaps it back again and\nthe good king goes well now what then\nand he goes well i don't know you might\nbe double bluffing me\nand that night the evil king doesn't eat\nthe good king happily eats his plate the\npoint is that so often we think\nwe don't have some of the mistakes that\nwe make\nbut we see them and everyone else we see\nthose mistakes in other people so we'll\nsay oh this person's not doing this\nright or i don't like the way he or she\ntalk to that person but if we really do\nan audit in ourselves we'll realize that\nwe have a lot of those same challenges\nand feelings that we may think others\nhave and so for me it's sometimes a\nreally\nscary and daunting task to do that\nvalues audit but it truly truly is\na beautiful process that we all need to\ngo through to really realign our map and\nget our compass right and start moving\nin the right direction\ni mean is it the sort of thing that\npeople do once or is it the sort of\nthing that people should revisit and i\nguess\nyou know if i was to ask you\nwhen was the last time you did that\nexercise on yourself\nyeah great question so i'd say that you\nhave to revisit like gardening if you\nlook at your garden outside and i can\nsee a bit i can see a light little\nglimpse of rangan's garden\nbut if if you have a garden\nhow often do you have to garden maybe\nyou mow the lawn i don't know once a\nweek once a month i don't know you know\nwhatever whatever you yeah i'd say once\na week\ni like a nice you know shortish lawn i\ndon't like it when it gets too long so\nthere you go once a week and so i'd say\nthat you have to treat this exercise\nlike gardening because when you do a\nvalues audit what you're really doing is\ngardening your values and what that\nmeans is you're pulling out the weeds\nand you're planting new seeds that's\nreally the activity that's happening\nhere you're planting seeds in your mind\nvalues that are good values\nthat are going to grow into fruits and\ntrees and give shade to others and help\nother people or if you don't garden once\na month let's say rangan leaves his he\ndoesn't bother for the last six months\nduring kovid he just lets it be there\nwhat's gonna happen that garden's gonna\nbe full of weeds it's gonna be full of\nstuff that he doesn't want there right\nit might attract bugs or other things\nthat are there that he doesn't want and\nthat's what happens with our values that\nafter a while our values start to\nattract dust they start to attract uh\nbeing covered over by so many other\ndesires so i would say it's a regular\nhabit i'd say that i do a refining\nvalues and intention exercise on myself\nabout three times a week i used to do it\nevery day but probably about three times\na week and i'm not saying anyone has to\ndo it that often i do it that often\nbecause i feel i live a life that is\nconstantly moving constantly challenging\nand i'm presented with a lot of options\nand opportunities\nthat i never imagined i'd have and so i\nhave to really train my mind to to focus\non these value audits but i also know\nthat every year i spend two or three\nyears two or three weeks and i go back\nto the monastery in india and i spend\ntime in the ashram with monks and so i\nfeel this is both an activity that\nhappens weekly or monthly i'd say once a\nmonth\ni i'd say the best way is to treat it\nlike your\naccounts and your taxes look at it every\nmonth look at your bank statement every\nmonth and then once a year when you have\nto do your taxes and you're going\nthrough that tax return and getting it\nall right you kind of do a deep dive on\nit so i'd say if everyone could spend\nthree days a year five days a year going\nreally deep and then one hour a month a\ncouple of hours a month that would be a\ngreat way to build it into your practice\nyeah now i just want to contrast it with\ntaxes and accounts which can often be\nquite tedious and um\nyou know tear your hair out type\nexercises for people full of pressure i\nwould sort of say that the kind of\npractices that are that your book is\njam-packed full of practical tools for\npeople\ni once you get into this way of thinking\nonce you start thinking like a monk\nthese practices become fun yeah right\nyes yeah i think sure you know like a\nlot of\nyou know as a doctor\none of the things that frustrates me is\nthat everything around health\nlet's say working out for example\ntends to be around\nyou know punishing yourself and pushing\nyourself and suffering\nand so we start to associate\nthings that are good for us\nas being difficult and as being\npunishing but actually\nall the tools in your book\nare going to be good for everyone\nthey're really going to help people but\ni would actually say that they're fun\nand if i just speak to my own experience\nover the last seven years of\nreally again since my dad died diving\ninto personal growth not because it was\nlike oh dad's not here now i'm going to\ndo some personal growth no\nit was just in the\ntrauma of dad's death in the sort of\nemptiness i felt afterwards\nthat's where i went i\ni would i sort of needed that pain on\none level to then get me to start asking\nquestions but i love the process of\ngetting to know myself better i love\ndoing these audits i love trying to\nfigure out my values i i like\npotentially almost getting addicted to\nit like it feels good and then you start\nto\ni feel\nyou start to switch off from the\nthe noise around you and you really\nstart to become tuned in yeah to who you\nare and what makes you what makes you\ntick learning about ourselves is\nactually the most fun thing in the world\nit's the most enjoyable thing in the\nworld when you find out about a new way\nthat your mind works and how this value\nis going to unlock this opportunity in\nyour life wrong and spot-on it's it's\nsuch a\nexciting thing to do\nand and i would encourage you to make it\nfun so i have i'll tell you an example\nof some of the fun activities that i\nlove in the book so one of my favorite\nones\nis\ni sometimes set my set self the\nchallenge of not comparing not\ncomplaining and not criticizing and the\nway i like to do this test\nis i keep a jar\nof uh post-it notes of every time i\ncompare complain or criticize i'll i'll\nput it in there and then i have another\njar of every time i'm collaborative uh\nsupportive to others and grateful and\nwhat i love doing is always doing a\ncompetition with myself\nbecause i love being competitive too i\nlove engaging that in a competition with\nmyself of how often can i make sure so\nwhat you find is the first day you\nrealize oh no i i complained ten times\ntoday the second day you're like oh i\nonly did seven times today and the third\nday you're like i only did four in the\nfourth day you're like oh only once and\nthen on the weekend you binge complain\nagain and it all goes up again but the\npoint is that you make it fun and\nenjoyable because what you understand is\nthat you are not\nyour criticism you are not these\nnegative thoughts you are not these\nnegative beliefs they've just become\nconditioned and habits just as your\ngarden is not weeds\nand what happens is we start thinking\nthat we are our pain we start thinking\nthat we are stress\nright we say things like\ni am just a stressful person right i am\njust a negative person\nand the truth is you're not\nyou're just going through a negative\nspace and time you're just adopted a\nnegative habit or a negative thought but\nyou are not a negative person it's just\nin the same ways you are not unhealthy\nyou've just adopted unhealthy habits and\ni think when you start making that\ndisconnect between you\nand the habits you have you start to\nrealize oh if i change the habits i\nnaturally change but you are separate\nfrom that so never get into that\nnever get into that rhetoric with\nyourself of i am a negative person or i\nam\na failure or i am a loser or whatever it\nmay be\nyeah i think it's so important that jay\nthat\nour thoughts are important\nour words are important and i think many\npeople\nonce you become tuned into it when when\nyou start to identify where you're using\nnegative self-talk it it becomes so easy\nto identify and everyone around you\nyou know it's it's something\nthat i spent a lot of time thinking\nabout both for myself personally\nfor bringing up my children it's\nsomething we talk about a lot at the\ndinner table\nabout how we're saying things because\nwords are powerful you know words become\nthoughts right and they that they sort\nof can you know you mention those things\npeople often do think that they are\ntheir pain they are their feelings\nwithout realizing that these things are\ntransient they come and go and you are\nactually separate from that but if you\ndefine yourself by that it becomes very\nhard to change\num\nyou know you mentioned\nyou know i guess a lot of words that\npeople who have a victim mindset\num\nmay say why and i want to explore this\nbecause i i want to be super clear i\nthink one thing i love about your\napproach um and certainly the approach\nthat i i sort of try and take is one of\ncompassion it's not one of judgment of\nother people it's understanding if\nsomeone behaves in a certain way there's\nprobably\nconditioning or reasons that has led to\nthat so what i say victim mindset i i\nreally don't mean that in a demeaning\nway i mean that in a a lot of people say\noh this always happens to me oh god you\nknow that i never get that promotion\nright and so\nthe way we think and the way we talk\nhow influential is our childhoods\num\nand you know what can we do about it if\nwe spent a lifetime practicing that\nyeah\nwhat a great what a great way of uh\nguiding this conversation into because\nyou i think you're spot on that the\nthe words we use create all of our\nreality right we we all experience that\nwe know that\nand there's a few things that i want to\ntouch on here actually one is\nthe understanding there's a\nharvard\nstudy that i refer to in my book\nand it's called the emotional list or\nlist of emotions but i call it emotional\nvocabulary and what i've realized is\nthat we all have a very limited\nemotional vocabulary for example if you\nask someone how things are going there's\nliterally five words that we use more\noften than anything else okay\ngood\nbad\nfine\nso someone goes how's your day going\nokay how's your week been good is\neverything going well\nright it's like literally like those are\nour responses and what this harvard\nemotional vocabulary list does is that\nit shows you that inside every word that\nyou say there are so many more meanings\nso let's take the word sad for example\nand what it does is it shows you other\nfeelings of sadness that help you better\npinpoint how you actually feel so the\nquestion then is do you feel sad or do\nyou feel offended do you feel upset do\nyou feel disappointed do you feel\nirritated\ndo you feel\nlike you've been let down\nthe challenges that we don't diagnose\nhow we feel effectively therefore we\ncan't articulate and communicate to the\npeople we love effectively about how we\nfeel and therefore we don't get what we\nexpect from others and so we almost\ncreate and run and you probably see this\nall the time\nimagine someone tries to diagnose their\nhealth condition without seeing a doctor\nit becomes really really challenging and\nthe challenging with the mind is\nsometimes you have to diagnose your own\nfeelings because you can't just walk in\nto a doctor's office and expect them to\ndo it because it's a little more\nintangible so we have to get much better\nat understanding and articulating\nourselves and diagnosing our challenges\nand what we experience but when you\nspoke about childhood there\ni thought that was a really important\npoint\nbecause literally there are so many\nstudies that show\nthat our\nbelief in ourselves\nour desire for love\nour understanding of ourselves is formed\nin our childhood so recently i recorded\nan episode about the psychological\nconcept of the three attachment styles\nor there are four but the three\nprominent attachment styles that people\nexperience in relationships and they are\navoidant\nsecure and anxious\nso all of us either have an avoidant\nrelationship\nuh attachment style we have a secure\nattachment style or we have an anxious\nattachment style and i'll explain what\nthey are\nif your parents\nwere avoidant of you\nif they didn't give you attention\nif they didn't give you\npresence and intimacy\nthen you often will crave that from your\npartner\nso what you want from your partner\nis exactly what you did or didn't\nreceive from your parents so sometimes\nyou receive something from your parents\nand now you demand it from your partner\nand sometimes you didn't receive\nsomething from your parents and you\ndemand that from your partner the secure\nattachment style is when your parents or\none of your parents or a father or\nmother figure in your life gave you\nsubstantial amounts of love so you feel\nsecure so you trust your partner\nnaturally and the third and final is\nanxious that's when your parents were\nkind of there kind of not there kind of\nlet you down sometimes we're there you\nare confused about their love\napproach to you and therefore now you\nhave this anxiousness around your\npartner and you're not sure whether they\nlove you or not now notice how all of\nthat comes from our conditioning at\nchildhood\nand so the first step we have to do is\nwe have to be aware of this right no\none's ever been taught about this in\nschool i saw so many\nnegative patterns that i'd adopted from\nmy childhood that i was projecting into\nmy relationship and by the way i don't\nblame my parents or anyone's parents for\nany of this i think the point is no one\never knows how to be a parent and what\nthey're doing and everyone makes\nmistakes so this isn't about\nquestioning your parents or being bitter\ntowards them\nit's about developing the emotional\nskills your parents didn't have\nand that first of all requires awareness\nare you even aware of what patterns\nyou've adopted from your parents that\nyou like or don't like do you behave in\ncertain irrational ways and when you\nthink about it you're like that's\nexactly how my dad used to talk to me\nwell that's exactly how my mom used to\ntalk to me i often talk about a positive\nthing so\ni love surprises\ni love surprises like from for gifts and\nbirthdays and events and the reason is\nmy mom always surprised me with the toy\ni most wanted on my birthday every year\ngrowing up so when i met my wife\nwithout explaining this to her\ni expected her to know that and she\nwould never surprise me because it\nwasn't in her parental background so i\nused to feel on my birthdays when we\nfirst met that she didn't love me\nand i know this sounds crazy but it's\nliterally true it's like i literally\nfelt like she didn't care about me but\nthat's because i never understood why i\nlike surprises\nwhere that came from and i never\ncommunicated that to her\ndoes that make sense wrong\nhey more sense than you you would know\nfor sure i mean\nyou know i i can think back to my own\nrelationship\nand think to all kinds of ways that\nactually\nand i i recently spoke to esther perel\non the show and yes you know really sort\nof opened up about a lot of those things\num\nand\ni think the thing i'm i'm sort of i'm\nhearing from you telling that story and\nwhen i think about my own relationship\nit's that\nwe often have expectations because we're\nused to things a certain way so we think\nthat's the norm but of course someone\nelse has got their own idea of what is\nnormal and\nyou know we\nwe we've explored this ourselves and i\nthink um as\nyour communication gets better as you\nlearn as you said to have the vocabulary\naround these things as you learn to\narticulate them\nsuddenly there's understanding on both\nsides and a lot of that\nfriction no longer arises because you\ncan communicate and i guess now your\nwife will go oh you know jay likes gifts\nyou know even though that's not my thing\nfor example it's kind of like oh maybe\ni'll get because that's how he\nexperiences love my wife always has two\nsurprise parties for me in the last two\nyears\nand she got me both times like she she\norganized these two incredible and and\nthat's what it is wrong and like that's\nwhat it is is that\nwe're just you know in every\nrelationship\nyou have the ability\nto set the level of joy\nyou expect\nand the level of pain you'll accept\nbut the problem is that we never tell\nthe other person what that expectation\nand what that acceptance level is and we\nnever communicate that and we expect\nthem to be mind readers and expect them\nto know\nand that's really where all of\nrelationships go wrong with our parents\nour children our spouses our partners\nthat there is no\ncommunication on what we expect and what\nwe're willing to accept and and that\ncreates so many issues that you then\nthink\nyou broke up over\nsomething big\nwhen actually you broke up over words\nand definitions uh one of the ones i\nlike to talk about is the definition of\nlove\nwhen think about the first time you said\ni love you to someone wrong like think\nabout the first time you said it to\nsomeone and everyone is listening and\nwatching think about the first time you\ntold someone you loved them\nwhat did you mean\ndid you mean i really like you\ndid you mean i hope we can spend the\nnight together did you mean i want to\nspend the rest of my life with you\ni'm guessing that you meant different\nthings at different times\nand now think about when someone says i\nlove you back to you\nhave you ever asked them what they meant\nby that\nbecause chances are you projected your\nbelief onto the word love even when\nsomeone said i love you back so if you\nsaid i love you and you were thinking i\nwant to spend the rest of my life with\nyou and that person said i love you you\nprojected that they were saying they\nwant to spend the rest of their lives\nwith you as well but actually what they\nwere saying was they just want to spend\nthe night with you and now all of a\nsudden you're in this complete\nmisalignment of values\nand and we end up in those scenarios\nbecause families define words\ndifferently people define words\ndifferently and different words mean\ndifferent things to different people at\ndifferent times and so you really have\nto understand\nhow that person described even being\nclean and tidy and organized everyone\nhas a different definition like\nthis you know my room may seem clean to\nsome people and my room may seem chaotic\nto some people because everyone has a\ndifferent definition\nof what clean and chaotic is\nwhat you can do right now is find\nmeaning in what you do\nmake what you do\nmeaningful passionate and purposeful you\ndon't need to suddenly look to become an\nentrepreneur or start a side hustle or\nfind some more time find meaning and the\nway you find meaning as you genuinely\nstop press pause for a second\nand go\nwhat am i living for\nlike what am i living for right now and\nif you're living for your child and if\nyou're living to provide and put food on\nthe table that is a beautiful thing that\nwe should celebrate more and sometimes\nit takes us a moment to stop and\ncelebrate that and so i would say find\nmeaning because you can't always find\nhappiness you can't always find\npositivity but you can always find\nmeaning\nin that position so i'll give an example\nlike i lost someone really important to\nme a mentor\na few days back\ni can't be positive about that you can't\nbe happy about that yeah it's hurtful\nyou feel sad you feel lost but guess\nwhat i can find meaning in it because i\ncan make a list of every lesson he\ntaught me and make a plan to try and\nlive every one of those lessons wow\nthat's beautiful and and so if you're in\na really tough situation right now don't\nlook for positivity don't look for\nhappiness look for meaning that's a good\none not trying to and not trying to get\nyourself out of pain too quickly or\ndiscomfort or frustration yeah which\ni've been a guilt of being like just be\npositive\nor whatever to people but i think it's\nlike you know have your experience yes\nlive your experience\nand find meaning as quickly as possible\nand\ncreate a commitment to how you want to\nuse that meaning moving forward okay i\nmay not be great tomorrow maybe not with\nnext week next month but i'm going to\nuse this meaning to serve other people\nto continue to do what i love continue\nto be great to my friends my family in\nthe best way possible and when you start\ndoing those small things with love and\nkindness\nso much more opens up it's like when you\nwhen you can be trusted with the small\nthings and the small moments you get\ntrusted with more and more and more and\nso like it helps to just\nin that moment and it's in those painful\nmoments that you realize how powerful\nyou are we all know that like you really\nrecognize it and and what you said was\nbeautiful about not rushing through the\npain because and and you know this\nexample's probably been shared before\nbut if you have a wound and you've cut\nyourself\nit's like\nyou can't rush the healing\nyou can't rush it if you broke your arm\ni mean and you've been through so many\nbodily injuries you can't rush the\nprocess it's going to take six weeks\nminimum to heal broken oh yeah\nand you've got to sit through that it's\nhot there's no injections you can take\nthere's no videos you can watch there's\nnothing you can listen to but our\nchallenge is we try and rush through the\npain\nrather than reflect through the pain we\ntry to rush the healing process try to\nrush the healing and you can't rush\nhealing and healing is meant to be slow\nbecause it buys you time it buys you\nreflection it gives you so much space to\nslow down to slow down and that's what\nyour body is calling out from this is\nour emergency like how many times have\nyou heard it where you slow down\nyou slow down and that's when you fall\nill\nbecause guess what your body has been\ntrying to tell you to slow down when you\nfeel pain so i write about it and think\nlike come on pain makes you pay\nattention yeah that's what pain's for\npains notice this notice this notice me\nlook at me it's crazy it's like a crying\nbaby craving for attention when a baby's\ncrying you don't just go eyes crying you\njust go oh yeah we'll just put it in\nanother room and forget about it right\nlike you go to it you find its needs\nwhereas without pain when something's\npainful we're just like oh yeah i'll\njust forget about it i'll escape from\ni'll do something else you have to go\ninto that\ni'm not the person\nthe pain that's said or whatever yeah\na hundred percent that's that's usually\nour response is what can i do to numb\nthis work more\nhave sex more drink more whatever's more\nwhatever it is rather than let me\nactually become alert and guess what the\npain just gets higher and higher and\nhigher and higher because unfortunately\nuntil it really hurts we don't stop or\nyou need more and more to numb it with\nso true and so you go down the extremes\nof life so true\nnow\nwhat's been the most painful thing\nyou've had to experience since because i\nknow leaving the monk hood was painful\nfor you because this was a mission of\nyours that you wanted to have for your\nwhole life and i think you were there\nfor three and a half years\nso what's been the most painful thing i\nguess in the last six or seven years\nsince that time that you've had to\nreflect back on take notice of pay\nattention to and reevaluate that's a\ngreat question i think for me it was\nin 2016 i moved out to new york so just\nlet me paint a picture of 2016\ni moved three jobs\ni got married wow i moved country\nand i\njust just started a whole new life like\nmy life just transformed so we went to\nall of that with my wife in one year and\nby the way all of that was surprises the\njob chains were surprises yeah the\ncountry change was a surprise the\nmarriage was not a surprise we planned\nbut apart from everything else\neverything\nwas a surprise now i said i like\nsurprises so i can roll with it but my\npoint is that's a lot of transitioning\nso much transition and i felt the burden\nof being in a new city where we had no\nfamily we had no friends\nand my wife who loves being around her\nfamily and no one understands just how\nclose she is to them i felt this burden\non me\nthat i had taken away her time with her\nfamily and now she was alone so i was\ngoing out to work and she'd be crying at\nhome\nand i was thinking she's got no friends\nshe's got no support and i know you can\nrelate to this with moving and\nrelationships and so much going on and\nso it's like i'm dealing with that and\nguess what six months later\ni have to leave and move on and work on\na new career to build everything myself\nand then i'm four months away from being\nbroke\nand so on top of all of this i've now\ngot four months away from being broke\ni've got enough money money saved for\nfour months to pay for rent and\ngroceries and that's in new york city\nand that's it and guess what even on top\nof that i've got 30 days before my visa\nruns out and i'm kicked out of the\ncountry so i can't even live here\nanymore\nso not only have i just got married\nmoved job three times changed career\nagain had to move into apartment four\nmonths of being broke and i might get\nkicked out in 30 days and my renewal for\nmy visa cost fifteen thousand dollars oh\nso that's going to eat into those four\nmonths\ni have probably never been\nunder that much emotional\nphysical and and mental pressure in my\nlife like genuinely i felt it and i\nthought my body changed my my breath was\nmore stressed i would be breathing\nfaster shorter breaths not deep breaths\nheartbeating faster not working out you\nget into lazy habits you start craving\njunk food\ni'm living in a 500 square foot\napartment with my wife which is which is\ntiny like everything's in that space and\nguess what we both work from home so i'm\nnow sitting at a desk hunched over\ntrying to figure stuff out she's trying\nto cook in the same room like i'm trying\nto just just trying to figure out what\nto do and i remember the next morning\nsending like a hundred emails to people\nand just being like this is who i am\nthis is what i can do how can we serve\nand that was the same year that i ended\nup meeting you later in that year\nand the beginning three months of that\njourney was so stressful like they were\nso stressful because i was like what if\ni have to move back to london\nwhat am i gonna say to her parents i\nmean i just took their daughter away\nlike uh\njust got married i've lived in new york\ncity for six months and my life's\nfalling apart like you know so much and\ni've got all these views but there's\nnothing there's nothing happening here\nwe met you also you also i mean at this\ntime you're also\ngrowing so much how are you able to\ncreate and reach this impact with your\nvideos as that's growing while you're\nunder so much stress and uncertainty and\ni stopped a bit of that time like things\nslowed down\nlike things slowed down i remember i\nwasn't crying as much as i was because i\ndon't enjoy creating from stress or\npressure and i don't think you can\nreally create something from stress and\npressure so we really slowed down at\nthat time and when i was creating i was\ncreating from a place of recognizing\nthat i could share what i had learned\nand what i had grown in so far so\nanything i was sharing was like this is\nwhat i've learned so far so that was the\nbiggest pain that i've been through in\nthe last seven years for sure\nand all i can say is that i remember\ncoming home to my wife knowing that this\nwas going to be the truth and i came and\ni said to i said to her i guarantee you\nthis is going to be the best thing that\never happened to us what the pain the\npain i said that to the night i came\nhome and then she gave out i literally\ncame up i looked in the eyes and got\nthis is the scenario and i just want you\nto know that i guarantee to you this is\nthe best thing that's ever going to\nhappen to us and i said this is this is\na monk statement that we used to repeat\ni said to her i'm just not going to\njudge the moment\ndon't judge the moment because what we\ndo is we try to label moments as good or\nbad and when you label the moment as bad\nit now does not have the opportunity to\nbecome good i'll give an example if i go\ni don't like this book this book's bad\nright and i don't and i love this book\nbut if i say that guess what i will\nnever pick it up and recognize the value\nthat's inside of it because you've\nlabeled it yes and we label stuff like\nwe label oh that restaurant's bad\nbut when you label them emotions that\nperson's bad now you can't learn from\nthat person oh great one that's a really\ngood one\nas soon as you start labeling people or\nanything is good or bad you limit it you\nstop it from being something else and\nhere's the truth\nevery moment can evolve into being\nanything if you give it the opportunity\nto right but as soon as you say it's got\nno value anymore you lose it\nand so for me i had to say to myself\ndon't judge the moment and i'd keep\nrepeating that don't judge where you're\nat don't judge what's happening yeah\ndon't judge it as negative don't don't\njust start saying it's negative because\nguess what we've all been in positions\nwhere a gift turned into a curse and a\ncurse turned into a gift it's true right\nwe've always our dreams came true and it\nended up not being what we wanted\nexactly it fell apart and it led us into\nour dream tony why is it that so many\npeople that win the lottery go broke\ngifts can turn into curses too but\nbecause we label them as the best moment\nin our life or the worst moment in our\nlife whereas when you approach things to\nneutrality and just what you have on the\ntable you can be like okay what am i\ngoing to do next that's why the greatest\nquarterbacks are neutral energy they'll\nget a little excited they'll get a\nlittle fist pump in there every now and\nthen but they're not hyped every play\nand they're not negative every play they\nhave this calm they see the field they\nyou drop a pass and it's like a little\nbit let's go\nbut it's very neutral even when you\nscore a touchdown unless it's maybe the\nsuper bowl or a big championship at the\nend of a game in the middle of the game\nyou want to keep it pretty like even\nkeel paced so you can prepare for the\nbest or the worst that's great yeah but\nalways up and down it's like your energy\nlevels will go up and down and you'll be\nexhausted you need to have energy in\nlife totally and if everything is tied\naround a story of this is bad this is\nwrong i'm in a bad place i'm messing up\ni'm going broke that energy is going to\npull you away from service exactly or\ncreation or creativity of how do i get\nout of this place so i think it's really\ni love that and i used to have a coach\nand i think a lot of coaches use this or\nat least he used to say to us he would\nbe like if you\nif you lose\ncry for a day\nand if you celebrate if you win\ncelebrate for a day yeah and then move\non the next day get back to training\ndon't don't let go live in the past\ndon't live in the past and what we do is\nwhen we lose we cry for a month and when\nwe win we just move on\nwhich means that our negative\nexperiences hold us back and weigh us\ndown more than our positive experiences\nso we're actually allowing because we\ndon't immerse ourselves in winning and\ngrowth we only submerge ourselves in\nnegative experiences we need to\ncelebrate also we try to celebrate\ni've been uh you know that's been part\nof my life as well as like moving on too\nquick and now we try to like let's enjoy\nlet's go to lunch or dinner and really\nlike appreciate this moment and\ncelebrate this moment even have a dinner\nwith some friends and family otherwise\nwhat are we working so hard for 100 and\nwe almost feel like we can't\nwe can't do that because that makes us\ncomplacent right but but that's my point\nit's never good enough exactly but if\nyou win celebrate for a day if you lose\ncry for a day move on\nsimple and you've learned so many\nlessons over your years as a monk you\nlearned a ton of lessons moving to you\nknow getting married moving into a new\ncountry building building companies\nlaunching products and books and\nyou've had ups and downs what's been the\nbiggest lesson in the last 12 months for\nyou because you've learned you've\ncreated so much in the last 12 months\nyou've done so many things what's been\nthe biggest lesson for you in your life\noh that's a great question\ni think i'd have to say that it's a\nand i was saying it to a friend on the\nphone this morning when i was on the way\nto you\nand i was just i was just sharing it\nwith him because he was having a moment\nin recognizing this\nthere's a wonderful verse in the\nmanusmithi which i talk about think like\na monk it's a monk book\nand in the verse it says when you\nprotect your purpose\nyour purpose protects you\nnow i wanna i wanna unpack that what i\nmean by that is\nyour purpose is like a rare jewel\nand a rare gemstone\nand imagine you were walking around with\nthe most expensive\ndiamond or jewel in the world how would\nyou protect it you want to just like you\nwant to just wave it out yeah yeah you\nwouldn't just wear it on your chest like\nthis like a baby holding it yeah putting\na pillow around a blanket you'd be like\nyeah protect it you'd protect it\nand so your purpose is like that and\nguess what people are going to tell you\nevery day\nthat that jewel is not worth anything\nthey're going to tell you that that\njewel is actually\nvalueless it doesn't have any\nimpact on your life they're going to try\nand take away that value they're going\nto tell you that there's another jewel\nout there that you need to have more\nvalue\nand what ends up happening is you don't\ni love the word look at the wording\nprotect your purpose you have to protect\nit so what happens is your success grows\nyou get more opportunities more ideas\nmore things coming your way temptations\nbut they can all take you away from your\npurpose distractions and to me i'm\nrepeating this for myself because i'm\nlike i just want to stick to what i was\nborn to do\nand i'm so grateful that i get to do it\ni'm so happy i get to do it and i want\nto keep protecting it i don't want to\nget lost in the waves you know you don't\nwant to just get chucked in the waves of\nthe ocean and just get lost and just not\nknow where you're going so for me when\nyou protect your purpose your purpose\nprotects you so that's been your biggest\nlesson that's my biggest lesson why do\nyou feel like your purpose has been\nmaybe distracted i don't think it has\nbut i'm saying it so it doesn't like\nreminding you yeah i'm reminding myself\nlike i'm preaching to myself right now\nespecially being in hollywood and the\ntemptation of all these opportunities\nout here totally and i think for me it's\na bigger lesson also because it gives me\nmore faith so i always encourage and\nthis is actually actually this is why\nit's my biggest lesson i encourage so\nmany people that i coach so many people\ni mentor obviously everyone in my\ncommunity and audience and everything to\ngo and follow that go and live that\npurpose and i see time and time again\nthat when i see people\ntrying to live their purpose they are\nprotected that it things work when\nyou're playing in your dharma and your\npurpose things work things move you feel\nmomentum they happen and i'm not saying\nthey happen without effort but they\nhappen they move whereas when you're not\nyou just constantly feel like you're\ngrinding up against\nyou know a war i know challenges just\njust constant so what is your purpose\nand when did you discover it good\nquestion what is my purpose is simple it\nalways has been since not since the\nbeginning because i discovered it\nafterwards my purpose is making wisdom\ngo viral and i've stuck with that and\ni've kept it that way because\nto me and there's more to it making\nwisdom go viral through entertainment i\nwould say is my purpose because i\nbelieve that that is something that is\nuniquely\nmy\ngoal impact and service and the\nbeautiful thing is i'm not limited to a\nplatform so that could be books it can\nbe podcasts it can be tv shows it can be\nmoved it's not limited and this i\nlearned by reading i was reading after\nand this was after my videos started to\nto get seen this wasn't before i did it\nwasn't like i sat down and i wrote this\nfancy tagline i was reading saleem\nishmael's book\ncalled exponential organizations and in\nthis book he talks about something\ncalled an mtp a massive transformational\npurpose and he says that every major\nperson organization in the world has an\nmtp\nso an mtp has to be aspirational it has\nto be massive and it has to be service\nand purpose based so google's is\norganizing the world's information\nnotice it doesn't say we're an seo\ncompany notice it doesn't say we do\ngoogle ads\nthey're organizing the world's\ninformation that's how big they're\ndreaming\nand when you're organizing the world's\ninformation you can do driverless cars\nyou can do google glass you can sell\ngoogle ads whatever it is and so ted's\nis ideas worth spreading that's what\nthey are that's what they're about so\njay shetty is making wisdom go viral\nthat's what i'm dedicated to so when did\nyou discover it because it wasn't when\nyou were it wasn't difficult it wasn't\nwhen you were 21 college\ni'd say i was 30 probably two three\nyears ago so i'm 32 now so i'd say like\ntwo three years ago is when i discovered\n30 years old is when you discovered your\npurpose correct so what was your purpose\nbefore that my purpose before that was\nfinding my purpose like it's like that\nprocess of just like my purpose before\nthat was 14 years so i've been online\nfor four years i've spent 10 years\noffline talking about the same stuff\nsharing the same messages in talks in\nuniversities in small seminars in\ncoaching and mentoring like i've been\ndoing the same thing for 14 years\nbut i didn't realize it was my purpose\nuntil very recently but i just did what\ni enjoyed and naturally try to get\nbetter at it so if we don't know what\nour purpose is and we're\nworking towards finding our purpose\nit's okay\nthat's actually where you're gonna spend\nmost of your life\ndiscovering what you're purchasing\ntotally and that's the best bit because\ni think a lot of people are like well i\ndon't know what my purpose is totally\nthat's why i just should i find it the\npressure of finding your purpose is\ncrazy will stop you from finding your\npurpose literally the pressure is so\nheavy and that's why it's not about\nfinding that it's just starting with the\nbasics what am i good at and i talk\nabout it i break down dharma and here\nand i talk about what are your passion\nwhat is your expertise what is your\ncompassion\nbecause that's really important what is\nyour compassion for the world like what\nproblem do you want to solve i often\npeople will say there's so many things i\ncould do there's so many things i'm like\nmy question is not what causes you the\ngreatest joy sometimes my question is\nwhat is what causes you the greatest\npain\nmake that your purpose make that your\npurpose if you don't know where your joy\nis you definitely know what your pain is\nin the world\nand so for me go serve that thing 100 so\nfor me the greatest pain i see in the\nworld\nis people not reaching their potential\nthat is that causes me more pain because\ni believe that there is someone out\nthere who is stacking shelves who has\nthe cure to cancer right there is\nsomeone out there or talented singer\nhe's a talented singer there is someone\nout there who's not living to their\npotential and i think we're better\npeople we're better partners and we're\nbetter parents when we live to our\npotential so that's what i'm trying to\nsolve and i'm not saying that's the\nbiggest thing you're saying it's my\nthing whenever i work with people i'm\nalways telling them\nto find your purpose focus on what\nyou're most passionate about or what you\nyou have the most pain around they go\nit's the same thing like do the thing\nyou love the most keep doing it until\nyou either\ndiscover that's it or maybe i don't love\nthat anymore like i played so many\nsports growing up i used to love\nbaseball i used to love soccer and i got\nbored with it i got burnt out by it it\nwasn't a love of mine anymore it wasn't\na passion and then i switched to\nfootball and it was like oh this is a\npassion and i'm actually more gifted\nphysically for this sport than it would\nbe for soccer i was too big for soccer\nkind of run seven miles a day right now\non the field but i think you need to try\nlots of things and you might think it's\na passion but you might get burnt out\nand discover\ni don't love it anymore\nwhat else is there and keep trying the\nthings that you said eight new things a\nmonth yeah until you discover\nit might take you to take a 30 40 50.\nright it doesn't and that doesn't matter\nlike it doesn't matter like it the fun\nis in the growth and the journey and\nlike for me the last 10 years before\nthis happened\nand my life changed is like those were\nfun i was happy i wasn't unhappy because\nof that because i didn't know the exact\npoint\nyeah exactly and now i'm very clear on\nit and i'm happy for it to evolve too\nlike i don't think it has to stay the\nsame i may sit with you in two years\ntime and tell you something completely\ndifferent right and i'm okay with that\nbut i can only work with what i have now\nand i think we start trying to\npostpone our purpose or find a date by\nwhich you have to you put a deadline on\nyour purpose doesn't make any sense like\nif if you really care about it how can\nyou put a deadline on it you just keep\nworking towards it it was this\nunderstanding that i had believed\nthat the romance that i saw in the\nmovies was what romance and love was\nabout because again how many of us are\nour beliefs\nare set by movies\nmedia and music\nso many of our beliefs and what we\nexpect in a relationship are based on a\nfalse show and if you think about it\nmovies always end with happily ever\nafter where the wedding just happened so\nit's almost like you see nothing after\nthe wedding and the funny thing is that\nafter the wedding is exactly what life\nis about like that's where life actually\nstarts like life didn't start when you\nstarted dating but movies end with\nhappily ever after and they don't tell\nthe story and so we all have this\nhoneymoon happily ever after version of\nlove and i had that too so\nmy first date with my wife i thought oh\nyou know she want to go to a fancy\nrestaurant you know she'll probably want\nto dress up she'll want to do this\nbecause that's what i thought\nfrom nowhere like she'd given me no\nindication of that and so again no\nchecking of expectation no checking of\ncommunication just complete me on\nautopilot and so i booked i got this\nreservation at this fancy restaurant\ni'll never forget the name it's called\nla canda locatelli and it's like this\nreally posh restaurant in london it's\nlike david beckham goes there and that\nkind of thing and so i'd saved up to\ntake my wife to this restaurant\nand she it was the worst date we've ever\nbeen on and it was our first date and\nshe was just like you could have walked\nme down tesco's like the food isle at\ntesco's and i would have been happier\nshe loves she loves uh she loves going\nshopping for food so any sort of tesco's\nor whole foods or waitrose or whatever\nthat she loves it and so and it was so\ninteresting to me to think i was like\nwell i put all this effort in and that's\nwhat happens you start thinking your ego\ngoes well you put all this effort in she\ndoesn't appreciate it and actually you\nrealize no it's just\nyou know me speaking to her in a\nlanguage she doesn't understand and and\nthis part's the biggest part about her\nmedia and i've got to share this story\nso rangan do you remember how much do\nyou remember any guidance on how much\nyou spent on your engagement ring\nbecause this is really like profound for\nme but do you remember anything when you\nproposed to your wife\nyeah i you know what i can't remember an\nexact amount but i\ni remember thinking oh how much are you\nmeant to do and i thought really that\nmuch that's like i can't remember what\nhappened in the end but\ni yeah but but i know that's out there\nisn't it there's there's a rule by\nsociety on what you should do yeah so i\nso so that was the thing so i remember\nwanting to propose to my now wife and i\nremember speaking to a bunch of my guy\nmates who were proposed or were married\nand they all said you spent two months\nsalary on\nyour\nengagement ring i was like that sounds\nlike a lot i had the same reaction as\nyou\nand i was like okay that's what you have\nto spend so i remember spending two\nmonths salary on my engagement ring for\nmy wife i didn't make a ton at the time\nand i worked in a corporate job and so i\ndid that\nand then when i started sharing more\nideas and stuff i really started looking\ninto that and this is the craziest thing\ni found\na de beers\ncommercial\nin from 1991\nand in that commercial it's a black and\nwhite commercial i don't know why but it\nwas chosen to be black and white and in\nthat commercial a man\nproposes to a woman\nwith a diamond engagement ring it's a de\nbeers commercial\nand at the end of it it says this catch\nthis this is what it says it says the\ndiamond engagement ring\nhow else could two months salary last\nforever\nand i was sitting there going are you\nkidding me that that was literally the\ntagline in a commercial\nand so many men took it seriously that\nby the time i proposed that was 1991 i\nproposed in\n2014\nand so it's like from 1991 to 2014 it\nbecame a rule when actually it was just\na tagline in an adverb\njust showing you the power of media's\nability to implant and and really that's\ninception at its best if you've never\nseen the movie inception check it out\nbut that is literally inception at its\nbest that that idea was planted in our\nmind in 1991 and in 2014\ni'm still operating by that idea and i\ndon't even know where it's come from\nthat's the power of an idea\nand and that's why it's so important\nthat we plant powerful ideas into our\nmind that are useful to us\nand that's the the the value and and how\npowerful\num\nstories are and narrative even stories\nthat we tell ourselves so that then\nstarts off as maybe the idea if one\nadvertising executive in a company\nsomewhere who gets is getting paid to do\nthis commercial does it and then it\nbecomes a reality for millions of people\naround the world who are then stressed\nout trying to think oh if i'm going to\nbe a real man\ni have to spend two months salary on\nthis ring yeah and it's it's it goes\nback to everything you're talking about\nit's about identity it's about stories\nit's about how can we start creating the\nstories\nthat are gonna start to help us you know\ngonna nourish us and feed us rather than\nthe ones that are gonna keep us trapped\nand in prison and i think\nthere's two things i think your book\nreally like when i think about it big\npicture what it offers i mean there's so\nmany things but the two themes i already\nthink about are\none awareness\ni think\nevery single chapter people are going to\nstart thinking and there's just start\ngonna because you you've shared so many\nlovely stories as well in it which i\nthink really brings it to life people\nare gonna start to see\ntheir own life in them and i think\nyou're gonna help bring awareness to\npeople and of course without awareness\nthere can be no change awareness is that\nfirst step\num\nand often awareness is all you need i\nfind sometimes and of course there are\nlots of practices you can do to help but\nsometimes just being aware means oh i\ncan change that now because i know where\nthat's coming from but the other thing i\nthink your book offers people is freedom\nbecause you\nyou get true\ninner peace and mental freedom to live\nthe life that you want to not the life\nthat other people\nhave set out for you or an advertising\nexec has sort of\nimplanted as an idea\nand then you know if we sort of start to\ngo in some of these practical tools you\nmentioned some exercises already\nyou mentioned gratitude and gratitude\nhas come up uh on the show before but\nwhat i loved about\nyour take on it was was if i remember\nthe chapter right there you said\ngratitude is a daily practice that's the\neasy part\ni want you to be grateful in every\naspect of your life\nand i love that and i've been sitting\nwith that idea for the last week or so\nwhat if you could expand on it jay yeah\nbeautiful i'm really glad um you're\nasking me about gratitude before we do\nthat though you sparked another thought\ndo you mind if i kind of go back if\nyou're okay with yourself where you want\nto go you're sparking so many great\nthoughts in my mind i can't ignore them\nthis is such a you're such a great\ninterviewer it's so much fun like\ni really feel like you've just we've\ngone in so many directions that i didn't\neven plan so thank you so much but\nuh when when you were talking about the\nstories we tell ourselves\ni think that's so important because\nthere's a there's a great study that i\ntalk about the book by amy vroznusky\nfrom the yale university and what they\nfound is that they tried to find a\ncareer that they felt\npeople may find not sharing a positive\nstory around and they found that\nhospital cleaners\nor hospital workers potentially have one\nof the toughest jobs and wrong and\nyou're a doctor and you know i'm sure\nyou've seen people having to do that\nwork and it's a tough job and so they\nasked\nhospital workers how they define their\njobs and the majority of them defined it\nas low skilled\ndefined it as\num you know insignificant defined it as\njust a way to pay the bills and that\ntheir job wasn't useful or their job\nwasn't important and their role was\nbasically describe like the\npersonnel manual\nbut then they asked another set of\nhospital workers the same people who did\nthe same jobs different people who did\nthe same jobs and they said how do you\nfeel about your jobs\nand these people had completely\ndifferent views\nthey felt they were healers\nthey felt they were caretakers\nthey felt that they were able to\ntransform the energy of the actual\nhospital they felt that they were carers\nfor the people there\nand what they found is that these same\npeople sorry different people who did\nthe same job were telling themselves a\ndifferent story\nand therefore they saw their role as\nintegral to the healing of the patient\nand because they saw their role as\nintegral to the healing of the patient\nthey found the work that they did\nto be extremely meaningful\nand that's crazy to think about it that\ndifferent people doing the same job\ncould say different things about the\nsame work they're doing the same exact\nthing daily but someone thinks it's\nmeaningless and the other things it's so\nmeaningful and this was a term by yale\nthat was called the call was called job\ncrafting\nthe ability to assign meaning where you\nsee it and all of a sudden your life\nbecomes meaningful so if you're sitting\nin a job right now that you hate or if\nyou've got a boss that you really don't\nlike or if you're in a relationship that\nyou don't want to be in\nif you can't leave for whatever reason\nright now because of kovid or lockdown\nor whatever it is financial difficulties\nif you can't leave and you really want\nto\none of the things i recommend you do is\ncalled job crafting from the yell school\nof management you start asking yourself\nwhere can i find meaning in this what\ncan i learn\nwhat can i adopt what is this trying to\nteach me and that's actually where\ngratitude can be applied to every place\nbecause you start going there is some\nvalue in this i remember when i wanted\nto leave my corporate job and i wanted\nto live my passion and do what i do\ntoday\nbut i'm so grateful i was at my\ncorporate job because i learned so much\nthere that is so useful to me now\nand we find it very easy to be grateful\nwhen things are going our way\nbut we find it very difficult to be\ngrateful when things are not going our\nway\nbut what we have to learn to realize\nwhich is a really hard lesson to realize\nis that things are always going your way\nif you're moving in the right direction\nthings are not going to always look like\nthey're going your way and they could\nstill be going your way we've all seen\ncurses turn into gifts and gifts turn\ninto curses but the problem is wrong and\nthis is the challenge we have a\nprojector up here of what we want life\nto look like\nand then we have the reality of what\nlife actually looks like so there's this\nbig discrepancy and so sometimes you're\nactually going in the right direction\nbut because it doesn't look like your\npicture and your image of what it should\nlook like\nyou work less you become lazier you\nbecome complacent you try less harder\nbecause this doesn't look like the right\ndirection\nbut you get to where you want in life\njust not in the way you imagined it if\nyou keep going\nif you keep pushing if you keep learning\nand that's what it means to be grateful\nin all areas of your life is trying to\neven in the toughest moment\neven in a challenging situation not\ngratitude like i'm so thankful to you\nfor causing me the pain\nthat's not what i'm talking about what\ni'm talking about is saying to yourself\nwhere is there meaning in this\nwhere is the lesson in this so i don't\nrepeat this again if i can be grateful\nin this challenging situation and i can\nexperience gratitude at all times then\ni'm always going to be coming at things\nfrom a positive space and positive\nenergy yeah so powerful jay\num would you recommend people start off\nwith a particular\ndaily practice as a way of getting good\nand developing the skill before they can\nstart applying it let's say to\nyou know aspects of their life that\nmaybe aren't going as well as they want\nto where they have to reframe things i\nmean what has been your experience in\ntrying to teach people about gratitude\nand how they should start that process\nyeah so you always develop your muscles\nin the training center and in the gym\nyou don't go out and develop your\nmuscles on game day right like no one\ngets thrown out onto the pitch and says\noh yeah go and play a world cup final\nand you'll figure out how strong you are\nyou'd never do that you you train in the\ngym you prepare you get ready and then\nyou go you don't go i want to learn how\nto run maybe i should run in the\nmarathon next year right you don't\nthat's not how it works and so rangan's\nabsolutely right that it starts in small\nbouts so i want to get more practical\nbecause me and ranga have spoken about a\nlot of concepts today\nwhen we talk about practicing\nthankfulness or gratitude and i talk\nabout four habits in the book one of\nthem one of the key daily habits or\ndaily practices is thankfulness now\nthankfulness isn't just about feeling\nthankfulness isn't just about thinking\nit's actually about expressing so when\nrangan messaged me\na few weeks back\nand he told me that he'd been reading my\nbook he i sent him an early copy because\nhe was going to interview me on the\npodcast and he sent me that message\ni was i was so grateful to him like\ngenuinely because he was expressing\ngratitude to me and that's the amazing\nthing\ninstead of just feeling gratitude let's\nsay rangan felt it but he didn't say it\nto me\nif he didn't say it to me he would have\nnot had the experience a of sharing it\nbe of receiving my gratitude back to him\nand our relationship deepening based on\nthat simple message he sent me\nand so gratitude becomes more powerful\nwhen you express it daily so every day\nask yourself\nwho's a person that you want to express\ngratitude to and go and tell them\nsecondly what's a place that you're\ngrateful for and spend more time in that\nplace and what's a project that you're\ngrateful for in your life and if you\nwrite these down every single day before\nyou go to bed who's the person i'm\ngrateful for and why what's a place that\ni'm grateful for and why and right now\nit may not be a place you can go to\nmaybe a place that you visited and\nyou're so grateful you got to go there\nbefore covert and the third thing is a\nproject in your life and so\nwhen you express gratitude make sure\nthat it's specific so i'll give you an\nexample let's say rangan throws a party\nwith his wife this weekend at their home\nand their friends come over\nand one of his friends uh rangan give me\ntwo friends names in your life and we'll\npick on them for a bit\nuh okay\ni'll say jeremy jeremy\ni think he'll be listening yeah um\nyou know what i'll go gareth okay\nso let's say gareth and jeremy and again\nuh i'm just gonna add a disclaimer none\nof this reflects gareth and jeremy in\nreal life\nbut let's say gareth and jamie come to\nthis party that uh ranga and his wife\nthrow and it's just you know just a\ngathering to get people together the\nnext morning\nrangan wakes up\nhe doesn't look at his first thing in\nthe morning his phone that's not what\nrangan does rangan looks at his phone\nabout three hours later\nafter he's exercised meditate spend time\nwith his kids and then he looks at his\nphone\nand he sees these two messages from\ngareth and jeremy\ngareth sorry about this but here we go\nso gareth\nhad messaged him saying thanks mate it\nwas great right that was gareth's\nmessage\nand jeremy's message was rangan thank\nyou so much like you and your wife just\nthrew an amazing party and i loved all\nthe games we played your kids are\nadorable and oh by the way you know you\nknow that food\nhow did how did you both make that the\nfood was amazing thank you so much uh\nthank you for letting us have this\nmoment together so those are two\nmessages\na or b which one do you think causes\nrangon more joy\nnow running the grateful person so we'll\nbe grateful to both of them but he's\nmore likely and honestly all of us are\ngoing to be more grateful to the to\njeremy in that scenario because he's\ngone into more depth and being specific\nabout what he actually liked and learned\nand because of that he is now going to\nattract more love and gratitude back\nfrom rangan as well\nso that's why expressing gratitude is\nactually the key and if we can express\ngratitude to people places and projects\nwe start to develop more gratitude in\nour life and that's something we can do\ndaily and it can be an email it can be a\nvoice note it can be a text it could be\na video call but it can be as simple as\njust a text message but specific\ngratitude is scientifically shown to be\nbetter for you and better for the other\nperson\nyeah i mean jay thanks so much for\nsharing that because\nyou know gratitude gets spoken about a\nlot these days but i think that\nspecificity piece i think that example\nbeautifully demonstrates\njust i can feel it the difference you\nknow you can you can feel it viscerally\nas you\nas you hear it it does something\ndifferent and i remember so clearly i\nthink i left you a voice a whatsapp\nvoice message because i was literally\ni was thinking oh he's probably asleep\nnow but he won't have his phone on at\nnight you know there's that bit of\ninsecurity at first i thought no just\nexpress the damn gratitude you know you\nyou know i think the the wrong enough a\nfew years ago possibly wouldn't have\ndone it out of insecurity or will this\nbe taken the right way or the wrong way\nor whatever\nbut the that i would say\nthe person i am today having done a lot\nof the work and having practiced a lot\nof these tools\num\nyou know\nthere is so if not only did i as you're\nsharing does it feel good for you to get\nit\nbut it feels nice to share i said i'm\ndoing a lot of voice notes these days\ni'm finding i'm going to whatsapp\npressing the\nthe mic in fact someone told me during\nlockdown that you can actually press it\nand flip it up uh which is my friend\njody thanks jody i didn't know you could\ndo that i said you can talk without\nactually holding it i didn't know that\neither i hold it down\nthank you thank you so much\nthat's actually jeremy's wife so it's\nall coming it's bringing it back\ntogether for those guys but\nyou know i i find it's really\nso i'm a vocal kind of person i like\ntalking and sometimes i find it hard to\nexpress\nwhat i want to want a text message so\ni'll just\ndo a whatsapp voice message and um yeah\ni think gratitude's super powerful one\nthing i'm going to add well i'll ask you\nactually do you do your gratitude\npractice\nby yourself\nor do you also do it with your wife so i\ndo my gratitude practice by myself but\nthen the expression may lead to me\nexpressing it to my wife if she's the\nperson that day that i'm being grateful\nfor and now i'm probably grateful to my\nwife every day and so i express\ngratitude to her every day\nbut i really find spending some time by\nmyself\nto figure out my mind first it's almost\nlike if you're both trying to solve a\nproblem together you can help each other\nbut one person can sometimes take\nshortcuts because the other person kind\nof carries the weight and it's really\nimportant to really be clear about who\nyou're grateful for you can do it with\nyour partner of course but make sure one\nof you are not kind of relying on the\nother person to come up with all the\nanswers and do all the hard work when it\nreally needs to be a personal feeling so\nyou know yeah for me it's\nfor me i feel gratitude is the easiest\ngift you can give someone and the\neasiest gift for someone to receive\nespecially when it's genuine and\nspecific\nand rangana i would encourage you not\njust with me but with anyone you know it\nwas so genuine and specific that you\nknow i recommend you continue to do that\nuh sharing of gratitude as you saw and\nyou said it's visceral it is it boosts\nyour mood when you're grateful to\nsomeone in a specific way and then you\nfeel they love that\ndo you feel or do you think\nas i do that many people have got\nhang-ups and insecurities and therefore\nto do what i did to actually express\ngratitude to someone\nthey're fearful about doing it\nbecause\ninsecurity is i think we all face\ninsecurities right\nand how would you help someone who says\nhey jay look i want to do that like i'd\nlove to tell my work colleague\nthat you know she was so helpful to me\nyesterday and she got me out of this jam\nand helped me do something but you know\nwhat will it come across wrong i don't\nreally know what will they think i mean\nwhat would you say someone like that\nyeah i think you are right i think some\nof our insecurity comes from\nsometimes our insecurity can come from\nour ego which is blocking our gratitude\nso the ego says well i don't want to\nrecognize\nthat someone else is doing something\ngood because it makes me feel inferior\nthat's one of the ways that our ego can\nblock us from gratitude\nand i believe in some traditions and in\nsome circles i've heard ego being\ntranslated to eliminate gratitude out\nright it's like a limited ego so you\nknow you can you can kind of lose\ngratitude through ego because you think\noh if i tell them that they're good then\nthat means i'm not good which is not\ntrue at all uh the other way the\ninsecurity comes in gratitude is like\nwell what if they think i'm just trying\nto uh i'm just trying to like get close\nto them or i'm just trying to say\nsomething nice for the sake of it or i'm\njust\nlying or pretending like what if they\nthink i'm just trying to\nsuck up to them right like is that the\nreason and so sometimes we hold back how\nwe feel\nwhat i'd say to you is\ni'd say that expressing gratitude\nif genuine\nif from the heart\nand if well explained\nand thought out should always be shared\neven when you feel uncomfortable\nbecause when it's shared from that place\nyou've already got the benefits of\nfeeling grateful\nand then if that person does or doesn't\nreact in the way you expect them to and\nby the way there shouldn't be a need for\nthem to react because you're just\nthanking them for what they've already\ndone\nyou're not thanking them for what\nthey're about to do you're thanking them\nfor what they've already done so now if\nthey respond in an ungrateful way\nyou haven't lost your gratitude because\nyou're grateful for what they did in the\npast not what they did in the future so\ndon't then go oh well they didn't even\ndeserve me to be grateful because they\ndid for that moment of what they did for\nyou so\nshare it because it's good for you don't\nworry about how they respond\nyeah and and i guess also if they do\nrespond in that way or if they do think\nthat\nthat's their own issue right yeah yeah\nthat's not your issue that you you've\nexpressed it from your hearts\nhow they react is kind of out of your\ncontrol right and that's another key\nlearning i think on this path\nto thinking like a monk i would guess is\nyou know you're not in control of other\npeople's thoughts right not at all and\nthat's you know that's the biggest\nlesson is that you're not in charge\nof the results\nhow people respond or what they think\nyou never are\nso wasting your time trying to change\nhow someone thinks of you\nis can actually be one of the most\nworthless pursuits in life but changing\nhow you think about yourself\nis probably one of the most worthwhile\npursuits in life but the one we spend\nless time on we're constantly trying to\nchange how people think about us and we\nthink if they think highly of us then\nwe'll feel better about ourselves but\nthat's not the case the case is we can\nchange how we feel about ourselves by\nchanging our behavior and being more in\naligned with the person we want to be\nwith our values as rangan said going\nback full circle so don't get lost in\ntrying to change other people's\nperceptions of you because that could be\na never-ending journey\nand and a journey that you never reach\nthe destination of because you never\nwill truly be able to control it yeah it\ncomes full circle that's that coolly\nquite right i mean that is\nit is such a powerful quote because\neverything we talk about you can jen\njust\nback it up straight into that and it and\nand again it brings out the the meaning\nof that quote so much more but jay when\nyou were when you were just talking\nthere about the insecurity that some\npeople may feel when tron expressed\ngratitude\num i i was really\ni was struck by something i wrote down\nfrom your book and i can't remember\nwhich chapter it's in\nbut you say it's impossible to build\none's own happiness\non the unhappiness of others yes i'm\nquoting daisaku ikeda who's a buddhist\nphilosopher\nwho says that statements i believe i\ncan't remember which chap i think i\nstart the negativity chapter with that\nquote so it's daisaku ikeda buddhist\nphilosopher and he says exactly that\nthat you can't\nbuild your own happiness on the\nunhappiness of others and i think\nwhat that truly means is\nwe often believe that we can only be\nsuperior\nif someone else is inferior so we feel\nbetter\nwhen we say oh you know that person did\nyou know that couple's getting a divorce\nah did you know that marriage only\nlasted like two years\nand what you're really saying is well we\nwe've somehow managed to stay together\nfor eight years like we've done pretty\nalright right and you're you're kind of\ngossiping about them or another way it\ngoes is like what did you hear about him\nhe's totally messed it up like he's\ngetting fired next week and all you're\ndoing is you're making someone feel\ninferior to make yourself feel superior\nthat doesn't create happiness it creates\nmore uncertain ground because now you're\nconstantly looking for someone else to\nfeel inferior for you to feel superior\nand guess what god forbid someone's now\nout performing you you're now feeling\ninferior and you're feeling all the\ninsecurity of what you felt about\nsomeone else so it's never a stable\nground\nright i believe it's in the bible but\nyou know you you can't\ni think it's that you can't build your\nhome on shifting sands but in the same\nway you can't build a stable identity of\nyourself\non the\ngossip or the mistakes of others and so\nyou've got to be really careful about\nnot building a ground for yourself\nimagine you the ground you're standing\non\nis built on blocks of superiority\nbricks\nof\ngossip and mud and cement of criticism\nthat's not gonna hold\nand so you don't want to create your joy\nbecause other people are struggling or\nsuffering you want to create your joy\nbecause you know how to deal with\nstruggle and suffering yeah\nso so so beautifully explained and\nand i think we often write the quotes\ndown that really mean a lot to us and i\ncertainly feel for me that was something\ni spent a lot of my adult life really\ntrying to come to terms with and\nrealizing you know i used to be so\ncompetitive you know\nyou know if i won a game of snooker or\ntable tennis or you know\nit would it would literally\nelevate me and if i lost\nman i would be down in the dumps like it\nwould and i've really explored this and\nyou know given the time we've got left i\nsort of probably can't go down this\nrabbit hole but\nyou know i i know one component is that\nas a kids\num\nyou know how i did at school you know\nand and again i don't know if this is\nthe same in your household i know a lot\nof immigrant families have this sort of\nmentality if you\nyou know if you've got 98 it's like well\nwhy was it not 100 yeah\nyou know you were like oh what you came\nsecond in that test why\nwhat happened who was first why didn't\nyou come first yes and\nyou know i actually think whilst i um\nand my mom will say because i've spoken\nto her about this recently said well i\nknew you were capable so i wanted you to\nbe the best you could\nand okay and i think she was doing the\nbest she could i would say for me the\nway i interpreted it\nwas that\ni could only be loved i can only be\num feel good about myself when i'm\nnumber one\nand\nreally i'd say the last sort of five\nyears that's pretty much almost gone\nfrom me now i i'm pretty i'm pretty okay\nwith it now like i don't\nfeel and i think that that is i think\nit's such an important quote that you've\nshared because\ni sort of think now\nand we should probably talk about social\nmedia a bit because you know you you're\npretty much the king of social media uh\nin in so many ways and i think i'd love\nto know some of your thoughts on social\nmedia um but with respect to that quote\ni think\none of the negatives and they've no\ndoubt been a lot of positives to social\nmedia um you know you have shared such\namazing wisdom in your videos to\nmillions of people around the world\nwhich potentially may not have happened\nwithout social media right so\nit's not about saying it's either good\nor bad\nbut i do think for some people it can\nmagnify those insecurities so if you\nfeel that you can build your happiness\nuh on the unhappiness of others\npeople can get very focused on follow\naccounts and likes um and i certainly\nknow in the in the uk medic world\nuh there's a lot of medics feel a\npressure to be building up their\nprofiles and if contacts we say you know\ni'm not sure what to do and you think\nwow it's causing such\ndiscontentment\nand it's just a metric that in so many\nlevels\ni'm not i'm not going to say it's\nmeaningless of course it's not\nmeaningless but\nif you're trying to do it because how\nyou'll be perceived by others\ngoing back to what we've been talking\nabout throughout this conversation\nwhat are you posting for what are you\nhoping to achieve by posting is it in\nservice is it to help people\nor is it to elevate yourself\nyou know i don't know maybe you can\nuntangle that some\nforest because i'm sure some people\nlistening will will be thinking that\nyeah there's there's there's very few\ncreators\nof content on social media\nthat started out\nwith a follow account in mind\nso me included a lot of my peers in this\nspace a lot of people that i know that\nare extremely successful on different\nplatforms none of them started at least\nthe ones that i know none of them\nstarted to get followers they all\nstarted because they had something to\nshare whatever that was whether it was\ncomedy whether it's wisdom whether it\nwas a workout plan a fitness plan\nwhatever it was like they had\nsomething that they did that they were\npassionate about that wanted to share\nand i can only speak to myself fully but\nwhen i started i thought i was going to\nhave a full-time corporate job and i was\ngoing to make videos on the evenings and\nweekends to share a message that's\ngenuinely all i believed\nand i it after my first month i had\nabout a thousand subscribers on youtube\nabout four videos i'd made on youtube\nhad about a thousand people that had\nsubscribed to my channel and most of my\nfriends were like great jay that's where\nit's gonna end like congrats well done\nlike you got a thousand subscribers you\nkind of just crept in there in 30 days\nlike well done that's cool like how far\nis this gonna go and that's really the\nreality of what it felt like\nand the interesting thing is\nthe question was never how do i get more\nfollowers the question was always how do\ni make more content that impacts people\nbecause and and that's the question with\neverything it's like if you make more\ncontent that genuinely impacts people\nyou'll get more followers if you build a\nbusiness that serves more people you'll\nmake more money if you\nhelp a lot of people through your\ntalents and gifts you will be famous and\nknown for it like it's it's a byproduct\nof doing something properly and that's\nwhy i love the definition that peter\ndiamandis gives that\nwe should redefine the word billionaire\nto be someone who impacts the lives of a\nbillion people\nwhy is jeff bezos the richest man in the\nworld because he's created a product\nthat we all say we want and that it\nsolves a problem that we really need and\nso if you want to get followers don't\nlook at the number\nask yourself are you really creating the\nvalue that's going to help people and\nthey're going to naturally want to\nfollow you\nand and they're going to want to love\nyour work and share it because\nto me that's the worthwhile\npursuit in life because when you do that\nwork that work is humbling when you do\nthat creativity that's the part that\nmakes you grateful for the success that\nyou get because you go wow like people\nactually care about what i have to say\nbut if you're just obsessed about\nnumbers and metrics without being\nobsessed by the content the creation and\nthe the service\nthen then you'll never be satisfied\nbecause there'll always be someone\nbetter than you so for me when i set out\nto write this book so many people are\nlike oh so do you do you want this book\nto be a bestseller and i said i want\nthis book to be a bestseller of course i\ndo but i'm not going to focus on it\nbeing a bestseller i'm going to focus on\nwriting the best book in the world that\ni can possibly write given the skills\nthat i have\nand that's why when i talk about dharma\nin the book\nwhich is helping everyone find their\npurpose\ndharma is broken down dharma means\npurpose loosely\nand has many different meanings but one\nof them is nature and purpose your true\nnature\nand the three aspects that i'll share\nnow for the and there's more depth in\nthe book the three aspects of dharma are\nyour passion your skills and your\ncompassion\nthat's what it means when you have your\npassion plus your skills plus your\ncompassion that equals purpose\nbut for most of us if we're just looking\nat numbers and metrics and data\ni mean you'll be dissatisfied that and\ni'm saying that as someone who really\nvalues numbers i understand the value of\nfollowers social media i get the value\nof all those things and i'm highly\nstrategic but i'll be completely honest\nwith you i'm not focused on the number\ni'm focused on making content and and\nthat's the message that if we're focused\non really creating value in the world\nall of the other stuff will come\nnaturally if you want even more videos\njust like this one make sure you\nsubscribe and click on the boxes over\nhere there's no such thing as a bad\nexperience\nthere's experiences you don't like and\nthey hug and they hurt\nright but to define something as a bad\nexperience"
