    "transcript": "there's no such thing as a bad\nexperience\nthere's experiences you don't like and\nthey hug and they hurt\nright but to define something as a bad\nexperience\nmy father was really\nyou know\nstrict\non\norder\num organization\nand the\nuh incremental completion of tasks you\nknow um\nand you know also combined with my\nmother's push\non on education uh as a really young\nchild you know we had to put hospital\ncorners on our beds and our shoes were\nlined up you know so and\nyou know at at six years old\nwe were\nwe were forced to think along those\nmilitary lines um\nand everything was a mission\nto my father like you know never there\nwas nothing that was\num a basic\ntask you weren't just gonna wash the\ndishes you know it was a mission you\nknow that had to be completed with\num you know military\nprecision you know down to\nhow much dishwashing liquid you're using\nand how much the bottle cost and if you\nuse that much and how many dishes do you\nwash with that amount\nof dishwashing liquid and how long\nare you going to be able to use this\ndishwashing bottle so you can relate\nthat to how much work you have to do to\nbe able to watch that many your dad\nsounds indian\nthat's more that is intense yeah you\nknow so it was really you know his mind\nwas like that and i took you know we\nalways take the things we hate the most\nfrom our parents but you know from that\nthe the gift of\nof structure\nand the gift of breaking tasks down\nyou know you said you know you set the\ngoal but the breaking the tasks down\ninto smaller manageable pieces was a\nthing that i came out of\nmy childhood with\num\nyou know for for example you met jl yeah\nyeah so i told when i when i said i\nwanted to i wanted to be the biggest\nmovie star in the world you know and i\nwas\n18 or so i haven't met\ni want to be the biggest movie star in\nthe world so the first thing that\nwe did is we looked at okay well what\nare the top 10 movies\nof all time because if you want to be\nthe biggest movie star in the world\nyou're going to have to\nmake the biggest movies in the world\nso we said well what are the top 10\nmovies so we looked at the top 10 movies\nwe said well what are the patterns what\nare the patterns in the top 10 movies\nand at the time 10 out of 10 were\nspecial effects movies\nand\n9 out of 10 were special effects movies\nwith creatures\nand eight out of ten were special\neffects movies with creatures and a love\nstory\nso\nyou know for\nthat's where the bent for me towards\nsci-fi\nmovies came from the recognition of the\npatterns of sci-fi creatures and a love\nstory so that became what we were\nlooking for with everything and then\nindependence day\nwas a no-brainer and then men in black\nwas\nyou know\nbehind that and it it's it's\nthat kind of\nuh systemized algorithm\nyes right exactly looking for what's the\nwhat is the pattern you know and that's\nthat's uh\nyou know one of the one one of the gifts\nmy father uh uh stuck me with coming\ncoming out of childhood yeah this is one\nof my favorite parts about talking to\nyou because of this\nability to to turn those into gifts yeah\nand and i i want to just emphasize that\npoint to everyone who's listening and\nwatching again because i think we're\nliving in a time right now where\nthere's a lot of bitterness towards\nparents\nand what we've received and some and\nrightly so as well like some things are\nyou know quite hard to deal with that\nlevel of trauma etc but at the same time\nwhen we start looking at our lives this\nway not in not in a fake way or in\ngenuine way but but really start to\nprocess some of these things to see the\npowers that it gave us absolutely well\nall the superheroes that we all love in\nsci-fi movies they all got their powers\nfrom bad things yeah exactly no one ever\nhad something good happened to them\nand then they like for spider-man he got\nbit by a spider yeah\nlike all the superheroes we all love and\nworship all got their powers from\nsomething bad happening to them you know\nit's really difficult to\nsay that to someone yeah in the\nin the middle of the the throws and you\nshould have added experience yeah we've\ntalked about that right but you know\nfrom\nsitting on this side of the experiences\nthat\ni've shared\ni you know in in my life and in my\nexperience\num\n[Music]\nthere's there's there's no such thing as\na bad experience\nright\nthere's experiences you don't like and\nthey hug and they hurt\nright but to define something as a bad\nexperience\nfor for me\num has not been true everything that's\never\nhappened\nto me in my life that at the time\num\nwas\ndeeply traumatic and and debilitating\nyou know there's there's you know been\nonly two times in my life when\ni\ncontemplated suicide wow you know\nthere's been two times in my life\num you know the the once was when my my\nuh\nmother and father\nuh\nseparated\nwhen my parents broke up and i you know\ni was 12.\nand you know that was one of the only\nyou know\nserious times in my life that i\ncontemplated\nsuicide but even\nout of that as i look back on that\nthe pain\nof that experience\ncultivated devotion\nin\nmy life to my family\nand i just never\nwanted to\nhave my children\nsuffer that and of course the you know\nthe i got divorced with from cherie so\nthat was i was recreating that situation\nbut it\nit woke me up in a way\nthat\nforced me to try to\nconnect with my children so\nthe the negative experiences or the\nthings that were\nawful at the time\nthere you know there's there's always\nthe other side of the coin and in my\nexperience\ni've cultivated\nuh only positive things out of the most\nnegative experiences\nof my life my my my father's death\num and the six weeks up to my father's\ndeath was probably the most formative\ntime in my life and as painful as it was\nand as difficult it wasn't all the stuff\nthat came up\nduring the time i still it it was\na powerful\nformative\npositive experience in my life\ntell us a bit about that if you don't\nmind about why you felt it was formative\nand because i think a lot of people go\nthrough the loss of their parents and\nyou know we've talked about this like\nthe idea of like sometimes people regret\nof what they did or didn't say to them\nyeah yeah yeah or maybe what they\nexpected of their parent what was it\nthat was so powerful\nthat allowed you to feel that way about\nthat moment because um\ni got a i got a gift that some people\ndon't get and it was that the doctors\ntold us he had six weeks to live\nright so and then he lived for four\nmonths\nright so\ni i got a warning\nso most peop you know most people don't\nget a warning you just get the call one\nday and you just you just didn't get a\nchance um\nand\nwhen i found out\nthat he was dying\num\nit just\nby the grace of god was in the middle of\nthe shooting i was doing a movie called\ncollateral beauty and it was about a guy\ndealing\nwith the death of his daughter\nso i was into the\ntibetan book of living and dying and um\nreading all the uh was it elizabeth\nkubler uh just reading all the all this\nstuff about death so i've been\nprogrammed for six months and i had read\nand studied all of this\nall these books about death and grief\nand dying and then i get the message and\ni was like\ni said you know i sat down\nwith my father and of course i had all\nof my traumas and all of my issues and\neverything with them but i had also been\nsix months of programming of all of the\nthings that you're supposed to do\nyou know to prepare yourself for the\ndeath of a loved one and\nyou know so i sat with him and we we\ntalked about everything so i said\neverything that i wanted to say and we\nwe got to those six weeks\nand when we got to those six weeks\nuh\nwe were clear\nbut then he lived\nfor\nanother\nthree months so what happened was every\nmeeting every time i saw him i was\nflying back to la but every every time i\nsaw him\num\nwas like oh thank god yeah\nand then every time we say goodbye we\nmade sure we said a good\nthorough\nfull goodbye because we knew at any\nmoment that could it could actually be\nthe last goodbye\nright and\nbut the lesson was\nit's always like that\nwhen we say goodbye we can't know if\nthis is the last time we will ever see\nyou should never greet someone casually\nor say goodbye to someone casually\nand that lesson came from that\nexperience every moment was so rich\nevery time we saw each other\nand every time we said goodbye we made\nsure it was a good thorough full goodbye\nbut that's how you're supposed to live\nevery day anyway every time you leave\nyour house could be the last time\nyou're supposed to like be in the\nrichness of your hellos and goodbyes and\nthank yous\nyou know and you know so i learned that\nlesson um\nwith my father and then\nwhen he when he passed\nit was\neasy\nwe were we were finished\nyou know and\njust the lesson\nof\nthat kind of presence and that kind of\nattention and that kind of recognition\nthat tomorrow's not promised\nyou know and\njust getting getting shaken out of\nthinking that you're going to have\nyou know tomorrow anybody who hasn't\nspoken to their parents or their brother\nor their\ncousin that they had a thing with or\ntheir ex and they don't talk anymore\ncall them\nright\nnow\nyou just don't like\ndon't think you're gonna have a chance\nto call them\nto to mar to tomorrow or next week and\nit's like that that opportunity with my\nfather changed every relationship\nin\nmy life i i've cleaned all of the\nrelationships in my life to no regret i\ndo not want someone to be gone and i\nwish i had and wish i could have and um\ni'm i'm just i'm not doing that in my\nlife\nthat's beautiful man thank you for\nsharing that that's that's just hearing\nyou say that i think there's a lot of\npeople who needed to hear that and i'm\nhoping everyone's gonna pick up the\nphone and message and if that person's\nnot here anymore still write them a\nletter right absolutely right if they're\nnot here anymore and you didn't get to\nsay all of that write a letter read it\nout to them read it to a picture of them\nif that's what it takes\nallow yourself to share and express\ndon't hold it in and hold it back\nbecause\nsomehow that energy will still reach\nthat person and that energy's left you\ntoo so absolutely you know even if you\ncan't call someone up today make sure\nyou make sure you still\nfollow the same practice because\nyeah it's it's just not\nit's never worth it it's never worth it\nit's just\nnever worth it never worth it and and i\nlove that idea of valuing each hello and\ngoodbye absolutely and not taking it for\ngranted or taking it lightly you never\nknow\nwhatever's gonna happen right you just\nhave no idea and\nunfortunately we\nwe we see it this is this is the um\nthere's actually a beautiful i don't\nknow if we ever talked about this\nthere's a beautiful piece in the\nmahabharata which is the gita is a small\npart of\nand one of the students asked the\nteacher he said what's the most amazing\nthing in the world like what's the most\nincredible\nthing in the world\nand the teacher responds and says the\nmost incredible amazing thing in the\nworld\nis that we see people leave all around\nus but we never think it's going to be\nus i never like so you see it and you\nhave that moment again and again and\nthen you lose someone in your life and\nyou think oh that could be me or you\ncould be someone else and you live like\nthat for a day yeah and then the\ncomplacency sets back in absolutely tell\nus a bit about you know you've been\nstudying world religions and spiritual\npaths for for a long time\nand the first time i\nofficially reached out to you and your\nteam and everyone which was a few years\nback now was because i saw that you'd\nbeen reading the gita and the gita was\nobviously the book that i read and\nstudied so deeply and and fell in love\nwith and after having studied world\nreligions myself too and and i've i've\nhad beautiful experiences reading the\nbible and the quran and and the gita and\nso when i saw you talking about it when\nyou were in india i was just like wow\nlike this is amazing like i'm already a\nhuge fan i love will smith like how is\nwill reading the guitar i was like how\ndid that even happen and then when i got\nto know you and jada and spoken family i\nrealized that you'd taken on a challenge\nto like study a world religion every\nyear and tell us about that and what you\nlearned along the way what were some of\nthe traditions that stood out in your\njourney\nuh that that and what did you learn from\nthem whether it was the kabbalah or even\nscientology all those because you've\nshared so many beautiful lessons with me\nfrom what you've studied yeah and i'd\nlove to pass them on so what what was uh\ni guess probably in the the first 10\nyears\nof our marriage that was uh\nme and jada's bonding\nright so every year we would pick\na spiritual tradition and we would study\nit\nall all the way through how did you even\nstart doing that like because when i hit\nwhen i heard you did that i think jada\ntold me first him\nwhen i heard you did that i was just\nlike\ni was i was just it just took me a back\nbecause\ni've almost you don't come across that\nall the time and i i was lucky enough\nto study world religions my father\nstarted\nencouraging me when i was about 14 to\nstart reading spiritual books\nand\ni\ni dated a muslim girl who asked me to\nread the quran that's how i read the\nquran which was a wonderful\nexperience of my life at 16 i read the\nbible because we would celebrate\nchristmas and i'd feel guilty\nthat we celebrated christmas but i\ndidn't hadn't read the bible so i\nstarted going to church on christmas and\nthen reading about\nchrist in the bible and i just\nabsolutely fell in love with the\nscripture and then i was just reading so\nmany different books and finally i came\nback to the gita which was the book i\nwas brought up with but yeah tell me\nabout even why you and jada decided to\ndo that so\ni don't even know how it\ndeveloped as a thing i know um\nuh\nwhen we got married\nwe were trying to decide you know\nwhat what church we were going to get\nmarried and were we going to get married\nin baltimore or philly and would\nwould it who was going to be\nthe the\npriests you know\nand you know so gamey had a different\nreligious background than gigi you know\nyou know so we were trying to figure all\nof that kind of stuff out and and\njada didn't want to do any of that jada\nwanted for she and i to go to a mountain\nyou know and\nyou know pledge our love and devotion to\none another to god without\nyou know she felt like\nwe\nwe weren't going to\num\nadhere to\nthis\nspecific religious tradition we would\njust be picking it for\nour\nher mother or my grandmother or\nsomething to try to figure that out so\num i think the discussion about the the\nreligious background we would raise our\nchildren in is what came up\nuh when we were when we first got\nmarried um\nand she grew up in a thing called the\nethical society\nin in baltimore and they would honor the\nthe different religions\num\nand my background i i grew up i went to\nuh baptist church\num i went to a catholic school and some\nsomewhere in that first decade of our\nmarriage we were like oh wouldn't it be\nhot\nif we could say that we had read\ncover to cover all of the major holy\nbooks um\nand we we started with the the bible and\ni just remember seeing her bible\nwas\nmark you know how i do my books now you\nsee how like all my books are\nhighlighted all the way through and\nyou know she completed the entire\nbible you know seven months\nbefore me\nright so now it's on\nright so then when it came to time for\nthe for the quran\ni was like i was i wanted to win yeah\nright\n[Laughter]\nbut you know so we would take a year and\nwe would study\nall of these traditions as a you know\nreally as a way of the two of us\nbonding spiritually and and\nyou know intellectually around the\nconcepts and you know we went through\nkabbalah um and uh you know scientology\nand really what was happening is every\ntime i would meet someone who was of a\ndifferent\ntradition\ni would allow that person to\nintroduce me to what their\ntradition was\nand then i did ali and so we circled\nback around to the quran during during\nthat time but we really just\nwe we love the the idea of\nof spirituality and the study of the\nlove of god\num\nand\nuh we we don't necessarily believe in\norganized religion we believe that the\norganization's kind of\njump ahead\nof the spirituality you know the the\nyou know\nthe church of christ is very different\nthan christ the the the steps that\nchrist actually\nwalked you know so we started to notice\nuh those kinds of differences and we\njust we really just wanted to find\num\nthe truth\nyou know what is the truth and you see\nhow my whole family dives in the kids\nare doing it yeah now you know with the\nwith the the gita and it's and it's\nreally\nuh\njust just trying to find our way\nyou know in in this world yeah and and\nand and i love that and i was so\nfascinated by that myself because i saw\nthat within myself\nand so when i saw it with you and the\nfamily i was i was so drawn to that\nbecause\nyeah i think that a lot of what we're\ntrying to figure out in today's world\nhas been suffered for long enough\nin an internal way that when you're\ndiving into these books of wisdom\nthere's just so much there to on earth\nbecause people have been through the\nsame challenges for decades and decades\nand decades the the the problems have\nalready been solved yeah\ni'm lived and lived\nand solved\nyou know and\nat the core\nof\nall of the you know the the spiritual\nteachings\nthat\ni've ever studied at the at the\ncore of all of the ideas\num\nhow you treat your neighbor is central\nright yes absolutely yet somehow\npeople\nmanage to twist\nyou know in in all the faiths and all\nbackgrounds\npeople\ndo unto others as you would have them do\nunto you is very clear\nif you ask yourself that question well\nin this situation how would i have them\ndo unto me and you did that you'd never\nhave a problem yeah\nbecause the answer is never going to be\ni think they should curse me out and\nspit on me and whoop my ass cause i was\ntripping\nit's like you just you know i mean i\nguess somebody\nyeah maybe no no no no i think you're\nright i think you're right if i were in\nthis situation\nhow would i want them to treat me yeah\nyeah\nright huge\nit's the most simple yeah yeah\nour teachers in the ashram would always\ntell us\nand i've said this to you before but\nthey'd always tell us that these\nprinciples you'll learn them on day one\nyou'll think that you know them on day\ntwo but you spend your whole life trying\nto realize yes\nand and that's the challenge with us\nthat we we take what we learn on day one\nand what we know on day two to be like i\nalready know that yes exactly and then\nthe the teaching doesn't what i love\nabout what we've been doing is like the\nteaching\ngets to like reveal itself to you it's\nlike it's always opening up it's like a\nlotus flower\nit's always blooming it's not like oh\nit's open now it doesn't matter yeah\nit's like always opening up to you and\nif you give it that time and patience\nthen you can truly see it grow and bloom\ninto something but if you just\nif you just try and force it open\nit just i mean you know if you forced a\nflower open it would just break yeah and\nthat's what happens\nwhat i say what i say to you all the\ntime\nis\nyou know\nso to give people a sense of it so\nwe're\nwe were doing you know\ntwo to four hours\na a day\nyou know you know a few days a week for\nmonths for months yeah for months you\nknow and\nyou know i\nwe were spending as much time together\nas we were would spend with our families\nor other things so we we we've we've\nlogged some real hours in this in this\nlast year and the thing that was always\namazing to me\nis\nthat we could take eight hours\nright and we spend it and we get it we\nstudy we do all of that and you leave my\nhouse and i pick up my phone\nhow quickly somebody could snatch me i\nwas like\nand and it really is\na serious\nmoment-to-moment\npractice to remember to be nice to\npeople when you get sucked back into the\nfoolishness so hard and so fast\nand that was frustrating to me\nfor a while like\nlike literally we would do eight hours\n[Music]\nand i'm great i'm great\nand you wouldn't be\noff of this off of the block\nyet and i pick up my phone and it's a\nbusiness call and\nliterally that fast like literally in in\n45 seconds my mind could get triggered\nback into\nthat that mindset you know i i i know\nnow that that's just it's every day yeah\nit's you don't you know you don't get to\nknow it and be done like it's a it's a\ndaily practice for the rest of your life\nto be able to deal with the foolishness\nof this world\nin a way that's\nuh productive and kind yeah now everyone\nknows i'm terrible at what i do well i\nknow\nit's like as soon as you have\nyou're really bad at this oh jay you\nshould have left will with a little more\ngirth than that no no you can't even\nlast two seconds tonight that's terrible\nwell you're working you're working with\nyears of of sediment you know all of us\nlifetimes like the conditioning is so\nstrong yeah yeah and it's it's almost\nlike when we start to do the work\nyou're walking into a garden full of\nweeds yeah yeah so all the flowers are\ncovered all the beauty of the garden is\ncovered in weeds and so you're cutting\ndown the weeds but because you've been\nwatering the weeds for so long they keep\ngrowing yeah and so you keep cutting\nthem down and then they keep growing\nback\nit's the example the analogy of the\nmirror\nthat's given um in the vedic tradition\naround how when you walk in and you try\nand clean a mirror that hasn't been\ncleaned for lifetimes it's dusty and so\nwhen you start cleaning it the dust\ncomes up in your face and you're like oh\ni can't see i can't i can't see and\nthat's what we're all going through\nand\nwe when we start realizing what you just\nsaid the day to day it's like if you if\nif all of us said we want to plant\ni keep using\ngardening analogies but it's only\nbecause it makes so much sense i feel\nbecause we're so disconnected from\nnature\nour mindset has become instant\nand our mindset has become\nnow\nwhereas when you watch nature nature's\nnever insulin yeah i call that hunting\nversus farming right everybody\nhunting versus farming where where\npeople just look just let's let's get it\nlet's get it and eat right\nthat's a great yeah love that i love\nthat you know versus no we're gonna like\nwe're gonna play the crops\ni love that yeah because it's\nit's it's the idea that\nif you if me and you said we want to\nplant a tree you'd have to come back to\nthat tree every day to see how it was\ndoing yeah and it wouldn't be a tree for\nmany many years but you'd have to come\nback every day water it sunlight move it\nreplant the soil and that's what we're\ndoing with ourselves but for some reason\nbecause we're so disconnected from\nnature now we think that oh if i just\nmeditate today\nthen it's you know it's like saying oh\ni'll eat today and i don't have to eat\ntomorrow oh yeah bro oh i showered last\nnight last week i'm good i'm good\nbut uh\nbut yeah it's you know and i again it\nwas your commitment i remember when we\nwere on that first phone call and i was\nlike you were like oh yeah i want to\nwork on this i was like how much time do\nyou have like how much time do you have\nand i you know you will smith something\nand you don't have any time and and i\ndon't know how serious you get yet i'm\nnot i'm not aware yet of how how\nimmersed and obsessed you get with stuff\ni'm still learning about you and then\nyou're like i've got two hours and i was\nlike all right two hours a week two\nhours bi-weekly two hours monthly you're\nlike no two hours a hours a day\nand i was like wow he's real like he's\nserious\ni was like wow he's for real and then\nyou know it's just\nit was and i'd go away and you\nreinspired\nso much of my own study and that's what\ni was telling to you over christmas\nwhich is when we kind of broke off as i\nwent to london and you've been traveling\nit's like i spent the whole of christmas\nreading myself for four to eight hours a\nday meditating again it's beautiful\nbecause i felt i had to be more to give\nyou more that's beautiful and and i\nthink that that was such a\ngift you gave me where i felt back in\nlove\nwith what i fell in love with years ago\nthat's beautiful because of the work we\nwere doing yeah and because when you're\nanswering someone's questions you have\nto read deeper and think more and\nreflect more and so for me i went away\nfrom those meetings going gosh i you\nknow i better start reading more\nthat's what's so beautiful about sharing\nsomething like that together it was\ngreat when uh with the the rather not\nswami\nwhen when uh\nyou told him that you were going to be\nworking with me and i just loved his\nresponse you say oh that is so great\nyou're going to get to teach all of the\nthings you need to learn\ni remember\ni was i was just telling you i was like\ni was i was explaining to him how\nsincere you are and i was like you know\nhe's so serious and he's sincere and\nthat's what he came back with you know\nthat's when you know you've got a good\nteacher he knows how to like squash your\nego yeah and make you realize how small\nyou are\nand and it was beautiful because from\nthat moment that was my attitude when i\nwas meeting you i was like\ni'm saying this for me i'm saying this\nyou know and that allows you to be so\nmuch more um\njust allows you to get out the way yeah\nand let the wisdom do its work yep\nthat's so real\nthis the central\num\nproblem that\nhas been\nthe\nfocus of my life\nand everything that i've done has been\ncentered\non\num\n[Music]\nhaving a successful\nlove relationship\nright so i saw my parents\nwhen when they were growing up and i\nhated that my parents\nuh marriage deteriorated and\num\nyou know as young as i can remember five\nsix years old i wanted to be married i\nwanted to have a family\num i've never been the guy that that\nyou know\nwanted to do threesomes and groupies and\ni like i just i've never been that guy i\nalways\nwanted to\nuh\ncommit and have a single successful\nrelationship so\nthe the scientist in my mind and in my\nstudy of spiritual texts and things like\nthat i've always been looking for the\nsecret to\nsuccessful\nuh\nlove relationships and then as i've\ngrown it's sort of expanded and i'm\nseeing the through line\noh the same basic ideas are successful\nparenting and the same basic ideas are\nbeing a successful follower or a\nsuccessful leader or successful student\nand i started to see\nthe\ncentral\nissues with all of human relating and\nit's it's the the problems\nor it's not even problems the problem\nis really singular\nin if you're talking about a husband and\na wife or you're talking about a a\nparent and a child or a democrat and a\nrepublican or\na\nyou know a saudi\nand an american whatever in all of the\nconfigurations of\nof human difficulty\nat the\nat the\ncenter of it is almost exclusively\na lack of understanding of the other\nperson's\nperspective\nright and\nyou know it sounds simple and it it it\nit\nmay oversimplify\nslightly but the the concept of\nignorance the concepts of ignorance and\ndelusion\nare always the problem yeah yeah right\nit's it's always the center if you have\na difficulty with another human being\nthere's\nsome point of ignorance\nand some point of delusion that are\nkeeping you from being able on both\nsides on both sides right and the\nthe problem is you can only worry about\nyours\nyou have to clear yours\nand then once you clear yours and your\nvision gets\nuh\nclean\nand purified and you approach a person\nfrom a purified space things get a whole\nlot easier\nyou know and it's like\nyou're all you're you are always\nbringing poison to the party\nand when you recognize that in any\ndifficulty you're having with any human\nbeing\nyou brought poison to the party\nright and if you can focus on\nlocating\nand purifying\nthe the poison you brought\nit opens up entirely new avenues of\nconnection and compromise and solutions\nthat you can create with a person\nand you know that has really been the\nthe central focus of my life and being\nan actor\nhas been spectacular\nin that way because my life is exploring\nmy mind\nyou know and changing it\nand that's one of the things i learned\nas soon as i cracked it open i remember\nreading the seven spiritual laws of\nsuccess and tearing up you know and i\nremember reading asking and it's given\nby stranger hicks and like\nfeeling my whole vibration change\nand that is one of the most um that is\nthe first time that i realized that\nthere are two realities there's a\nreality that we see with our\num eyes and our\nfeel and touch and then there is a\nreality just as real where\nit is our spiritual world that we can\ncreate and manifest\nand that is the reality with a capital r\nyou know what i'm saying that's the real\nreality that you bring to the other\nreality\nand so anyway\ni did these exercises man like\ni never read i only read books because i\nhad to in school that was like my thing\nlike i could relate you know\nand it was some good books right like we\ni remember we were at animal farm the\nhobby all these great books\nthat helped me but i still never read on\nmy own time\nso these were the first books i read on\nmy own time\nyou know i graduated high school i ended\nup me i ended up meeting kanye right\nbefore i graduated high school so i\nended up rapping for him it's a classic\nfairy tale hip-hop story you meet your\nidol you rap for him he hears you out\nand i have been recording cds since i\nwas 11 years old man so i have been\npassing out cds around school\nselling them for five dollars three\ndollars i have been participating in\nopen mics battle rapping i had gone to\nthe radio station every friday after\nschool even when\nyou know because when i turned 16 my\ngrandmother had a stroke\nand she had a brand new car so it just\nit was a bittersweet thing because it\nwas tragic to see my grandma\nyou know have a stroke and the strongest\nwoman i've ever seen\nliterally get old instantaneously\nand then i ended up getting a car which\nprovided me\nto get places that i needed to get to\nyou know to make uh\nto make the moves i was trying to make\nbecause i was a i had that man the\nhustler mentality i was like\ni had to do it you know eminem was the\nonly rapper from detroit at the time\nthat was doing it big\nand just to keep it real i was i got to\nrepresent for the for black you feel me\nand be like and put on for my city and i\njust felt the responsibility man and\ni know i'm skipping around a lot that's\nso good man that's so good yeah but um\ni would do this radio show every week i\nyou know and that led me to meeting\nkanye because he was at the radio\npromoting his album late registration at\nthe time\nand\nyou know i met him from doing the radio\nshow there every friday\ni lied and said i left my phone in the\nback offices so they would let me in the\nback to go check cause i knew that's\nwhere the artist would go\ni got a chance to rap for him as he was\nwalking out you know he was like i'm\nreal busy how did you have the courage\nto do that because i feel like people\nprobably see you\nand they're like i want to go rap for\n[ __ ] like you know people want to\nrepeat all the time yeah exactly so how\ndid you\nhow do you think you were able to even\nhave the courage to be like i'm just\ngonna\nfind a way in the hallway like you know\nwhen he's walking he's a busy guy well\nbecause\nwhen i did that radio show every friday\nwe were wrapped on the air on the radio\nyeah that was the most nerve-wracking\nthing i've ever had to do in my life it\nwould be like oh my god everybody who's\nlistening to the radio right now is\nhearing me and that was a beautiful\nplatform right for up-and-coming mcs to\ncome in and display\nand um\ni would i would write a new verse every\nweek and i was super nervous so i had\ndone that for about a year straight\nalready by the time i met him so i was\nused to rapping under pressure right so\nwhen i saw him and was delivering it it\nwas just like i had so many wraps in my\nhead already\nand i was freestyling and i was used to\ndelivering under pressure so i was able\nto um\n[Music]\ndynamically you know i delivered it as\nbest i could yeah um\nand he he heard me he heard me out and\nhe was like well you got a cd and it's\nlike well yeah cause i had cds that i\nwas selling in high school i had my cds\nready i had a buy already i had\neverything ready and it's crazy because\never since i was 11 years old every\nsingle thing i had\ndone so far i led up to that moment it\nall happened\nand it was like yeah i had the cd i had\nthis i had that and he\nfollowed through but it took years after\nthat that's what people don't get it\nwasn't like i rapped for him\nand that was it\nyou know i rapped for him and thought it\nwas gonna be like that that's why i\ndidn't go to school that's why i turned\neverything down and then i stopped\ngetting a response from him\nand then all my friends are in college a\nwhole semester goes by and they're like\nman you could have came to school would\nyou you still at home like what's up\nwhat's up with kanye what's up with your\nrecord deal like what's up like that's\nthe hardest to hear that's the hardest\nand i come from a family my grandma's\nlike why you know you need to go to\nschool like this is the way to a better\nlife you know she grew up in poverty\nand made her way to that point you know\nand she's like education is the way\nand it was the hardest thing to go\nagainst the grain you know and my mom\nwas really\none of the only people who even though\nshe\nwas a teacher herself right an english\nteacher has her master's degree she she\nknow she knew what it was like to have a\ndream\nand she knew what it was like to chase\nit you know so she believed of course\neducation is important but you can\nalways go back and get it you can't\nalways leave your you know\ntake that chance the other way around\nyeah so during that time period for like\na year and a half or two\nwhat i did was that was the first time i\nintentionally worked on myself\nand i intentionally would read these\nbooks and meditate every day and\nyou know\nimagine myself like\nliving the life that i was you know\ntrying to live and\nit's just uh i don't know how to explain\nit it was like i feel like i was there\nand what that did was it put me there it\nreally did to make a long story short it\nput me there what were the work that you\nwere doing with that meditation\nenvisioning because i'm sure like you\nsaid and i'm really glad you brought it\nup\nbecause before like you said i was at\nthe radio station i was yeah i was\nrapping live i was nervous like what i\nwhat i find is that\nwith yourself and and stories like yours\nthere's manifestation but there's also a\nton of hard work oh yeah in the\nbackground yes it is tell me about that\npart of what were you doing in the\nbackground while you're meditating\nyou're envisioning you're seeing\nyourself there what's happening with\nrap music and music well one of the\nthings that i would do in my meditations\nis i would put out the like i would like\nlet me attract\nthe people energy places wow\nthat i need to go to the next level in\nmy career let me attract the people and\ni would meet people i would meet\nproducers\nand we would lock in and you know who\nhad as common\num belief is mine or like you know the\nsame one and like i'm trying to get on\nas a producer like you trying to get on\nless work right and\num i would write things down i would\njust\nit was just my i treated it like it was\na job\nand\nalso one of the things i had to\nput in perspective is that\nit didn't matter\nhow hard i was working necessarily it\nreally mattered how smart i was working\nyou know\ni had a perception it is hard work\nyou're right but i had the perception\nthat it takes hard work until i realized\nthat some of the most\nsuccessful people i knew would work a\ncouple hours a day yeah and enjoy their\nlife yeah it's flowing and at the end of\nmy and me and my mom we grew up in debt\nand she worked two jobs and she was\nworking most of her life so it just\ndidn't make sense to me you know early\non i'm like it's not about working hard\nit's about working efficiently and\nsmarter\nso that's one of the things i i really\nlearned at that age too so i would it's\na big lesson you know because a lot of\nthe other people who i would see at\nstudios they would be like man i made\neight songs today like\ni'd be like well i'm still i've been\nworking on the same song for like a week\nand a half but it's not about\nit's not about that you know it's it's\nabout\nit's about the product it's about what\nyou what you're doing and\nand and uh not about necessarily how\nmuch you're pumping out you know what i\nmean and that was a that was something i\nreally had to\num accept because your ego will not let\nyou accept that sometimes\nwe've been conditioned right to to think\nall these things and that's when i feel\nlike one of the things your book talks\nabout\nwe've been conditioned to\nuh\nthink a certain way we've been\nconditioned to\nyou know we we're given like a certain\namount of of uh option guidance options\ndirections you're supposed to do this\nyou're supposed to do that you're\nsupposed to follow the line you're\nsupposed to do that you're supposed to\ndo that you guys got to do you know the\nour whole lives and\na lot of that is just\nsome of it's great but some of it just\ndoesn't apply to everyone you know and\nthat's that's one of the things i had to\nrealize and\nuh\nre do my foundation of my whole life and\nbe my architect\nwell said man that's beautiful i love\nthe way you've expressed that because\nthat must have been an uncomfortable\nplace to live\nfor one or two years when you feel\nyou're gonna get your break\nit doesn't happen your friends are now\nmoved on yeah and everyone's and i'm\nstill in the same bed that i grew up in\nyeah you know i i was sleeping in a twin\nsize bed man i'm 18 19 years old you\nfeel me yeah and\nuh it was so frustrating and it was a\ntest of my ego bro it was a test of my\nego but i was a visual i would visualize\nkanye reaching out i would visualize\ni just knew that it was gonna happen i\ndidn't know how and like i was like i'm\ngonna make it happen somehow and it just\nit did bro and\nit's like something you gotta trust\nyou know imagine you being on a cliff\nand it's like there's no more cliff\nthere\nbut you like hey man there's an\ninvisible bridge\nyou know if you had a if you had a\nguidance next to you like you had your\nhigher self walking next to you\nand you're like bro there's nowhere to\nwalk and he's like i'm telling you if\nyou take a step it's an invisible bridge\nright in front of you and that takes a\nlot of faith to walk on that bridge yeah\nyou know that you can't even see\nbut that's what i had to do because\nthat's that's that's the decision i made\ni wasn't about to\ngo back to school at that moment i\nwasn't about to\ngo back to my friends and be like man\ny'all was right like\ni messed up man i should just you know i\ni couldn't do it you know and that may\nhave been my ego too but i did let that\nmotivate me\nand\num\nthat's just that's just how it went you\nknow and then he did reach out yeah tell\nus about tell us about that moment how\nit felt internally around\nwere you like oh wow this manifestation\nstuff works was that a point where you\ndeepened your faith and belief in the\ninvisible bridge where you were like oh\nthis stuff really works or do you think\nyou already believed that it worked and\nit was just about trust or was this like\na confidence point i had to trust it\nfirst yeah okay i had to trust at first\nbeautiful yeah you know and that's the\nthing with everything you got to trust\nit\nand\nuh\nthen it started working you know things\nnecessarily don't work before you trust\nit it's kind of like you got you know\ni think that's one of the lessons i had\nto learn you know i had to trust in me\ntrust myself trust the process\ntrust god speed\nyou know that expression is uh so\npopular for a reason you know you can\nmake all these plans my grandmother says\nbe like man guy you make all these plans\ngod god's gonna laugh at you yes yeah\nyeah you know that classic saying and\nshe would say that to me and it so many\nsayings like that\njust means so much more now because it's\ntrue that's why it's so popular\nwhat goes around comes around you know\nall these little things that we heard\nthey're true yeah they're true yeah you\nknow uh\nso\nit's it's been a beautiful time and when\nhe did when he did reach out it was just\nit felt like\nit was confirmation\nthat\nthat trust uh\nwasn't wasted it's all a higher\npower right and that and that is guiding\nus and wants to support us yes and does\nsupport us not one student does support\nus absolutely did you ask him why it\ntook him so long no because\nyou know i knew people who were like 30\n40 years old that never got their shot\nso i'm not gonna be like man\ntook two years\nwhat took so long you know but uh\nyou know and it was a process after that\nand things\ni'm not gonna sit here and say life is\nsmooth sailing never you know it's it's\nnot smooth sailing it's like a constant\nunraveling\nexperience right\nand things don't it's so many times\nwhere other things don't go my way and\ni've done all the work and i'm like\nwhy didn't this happen how i wanted it\nto happen and then sometimes where i\ndidn't expect things to do anything and\nit was\nturns out to be one of my biggest songs\nin my career my biggest moments are\none of my great you know greatest\nexperiences or things that i've like\nokay i put so much energy and power into\nthis and not do what i wanted it to do\nlike these are things that\ni go through on it on a daily basis\nbut i had to realize that it's all\nthe the side of life that i'm on is such\na unique\nside and it's the bless the blessed side\nyeah and that\nanything that happens to me\nanything you know whether i\nit's all it's all love it's all\nbeautiful you know and it's something to\nbe learned from it it's something to be\ngained from it it's\nyou know that you when you win something\nyou learn something when you lose\nsomething you learn something you know\nyou still win something yeah you gain\nsomething you know so\nit's it's crazy man it's really crazy\ndid you find that when you finally made\nit into the music industry\nthat there were people like you that\nmeditated that were visioning that were\nworking from this\ndeeper core place did you did you find\nthat or did you find that your\nspirituality was almost threatened or\nquestioned or\nthere weren't people seeing eye to eye\nhow did you feel about that did you find\nlike it was still natural to stay true\nto what got you there because you had a\nvery different journey\nin terms of internal journey towards\nmusic yeah\ni would see both yeah i would see people\none of the reasons i wanted to\nsign a kanye\nbecause his first album inspired me so\nmuch yeah same thing and i can tell that\nhis\nwhether he knows it or not he is he's a\nhe is for clearly as a manifestor\nhe clearly is a\nspiritual being too you know or\nyou could call it religious\nto me it's uh you know there are so many\nsimilarities right um\nbut he is he is somebody who is a\nmanifesto he's somebody who's a creator\nright he's somebody who\nuh i've saw him wield ideas from you\nknow the inspiration of god or you know\nwhatever\nwhatever he can say it is but\nthat drew me to him you know what i mean\nand\nyeah i've seen in a lot of people i've\nseen it you know when i sit and talk to\njay-z it's like i don't have to sit and\nlike\ntalk to him so deeply about it i can\njust tell that he has this you know\nthere are a lot of people who i met even\ndj khaled yeah yeah you know he's\nsomebody who is\nyou know manifesting a manifesto yeah\nyou know and his story is crazy i don't\nknow if you've ever talked to him\ni haven't his story is crazy man and you\nknow it's a beautiful beautiful story\nand we all have stories\nand\nthere are people who\nlike those are people who you would kind\nof like be like oh okay i can see that\nbut then there are people who i also\nhave met or even janae you know you\ncould tell janae is like very aware for\nsure and\num\nyou know somebody who is spiritually in\ntune you know what i mean yeah that's\nwhat that's what i love about this\nconversation and all the people you're\nmentioning i think we see a\nwe see an external pr version\nof who we think those people are on the\nfront cover of magazines or music videos\nor whatever it may be but\nbehind everyone there's a deeper story\nit wasn't just like that tell us about\nwhen\ni'm intrigued because i feel like a lot\nof people listening to us right now they\nmay actually feel blocked\nfrom that envisioning right they feel\nblunt like they feel like\nthey're just they're not getting when\nhave you felt blocked or if someone's\nlistening and they feel blocked\nwhat's blocking them like how do they\nremove that how do they let go what are\nwhat are they needing to let go of well\nthis is deep dog you're getting deep i\nhad to i had to go there with you\nyou're giving me deep talk so i don't\nwanna you know\ngotta dive in well\none thing i have learned on my journey\nis that there are blocks that are\nsometimes placed on us from our parents\nor from our surroundings\nand whether you believe this or not i\nbelieve it is true even from a past life\nand\nit makes total sense because i met\ncomplete babies who were like this is\nlike an old man in here right he's very\nmature you know it's like\nbut anyway um\ni have worked with people who have\nhelped me\nremove blocks from my life\nmarie diamond being one of them\nyou know and that's a whole deeper\nconversation but she has\num in the last few years as someone who\nhas helped um\nwho has been a mentor to me spiritually\nand helped me along my spiritual journey\nand\num\n[Music]\nyou know honestly\nwhen i look when i just think about the\nblocks that i've had in my life so to go\nback to that to think about people who\nare feeling blocked\nknow that\nyou have to believe that you can feel\nunblocked\nbecause you're giving it power by\nacknowledging like i'm blocked i'm\nblocked you're putting that out in the\nuniverse remember like what we said the\nsayings that people\nlive by that you've heard what goes\naround comes around what you get is what\nyou give those are real things and you\nsubconsciously and that subconscious\nmind is just as powerful as the\nconscious one\nhe's ah i'm feeling blocked or man i'm\njust i'm down bad you know i've heard\npeople just say all these things that\nthey put on themselves like i can't\nfigure it out\ni can't figure it out i can't figure it\nout so okay imagine if you're in front\nof\nthe universe and god and he's like\nwhatever you say i'm gonna give back to\nyou like whatever you say i'm gonna give\nit back to you so you stand up here like\ni can't figure it out man i can't i\ncan't make money i can't do this i can't\ndo you know i just i feel like i\nit's like even when i did feel black i\nnever\nand if i did think that i never owned it\nand i'd be like no okay i gotta switch\nthat i gotta i gotta feel better so\nthe first key to unblocking something is\nacknowledging that you are blocking\nyourself for sure\nyou know and i do think there are some\ndeeper blocks that you gotta work harder\non to remove like blocks that may have\nnot even been put there from you so\nyou're not even acknowledging it or not\nor know how to\num remove it and there are special\npeople who can do this you know that can\nhelp you get rid of it but i do feel\nlike\nyou're blocking yourself\nand you got to realize that\nstop blocking yourself it doesn't matter\nif you\ndon't have money don't say you don't\nhave money yeah because i got money\nmoney's coming in right now like\nwho i feel feels good to be rich\nif you keep that mentality and you're\nyou're not rich i sh promise you if you\nreally believe it which you have to\nbelieve it because\nyou just have to this if you you know\nuh\nyou will be whatever you want to be and\nit's never too late to be who you want\nto be yeah absolutely yeah i used to\nhave a mentor i remember used to repeat\nto me the\nnapoleon hill words of like you become\nwhat you think about yeah and he just\nkeeps saying it to me and he told me to\nkeep saying it when he first said it i\nwas just like oh come on like you know\nhow many times you're gonna say it it's\nlike a mantra when i first became a monk\nand they introduced me to mantra saying\nthe same thing every day again and again\nand you're thinking oh this ain't gonna\nwork\nbut actually what you're saying is true\nthat when you repeat you become what you\nthink about yeah and when you keep\nrepeating it it becomes your vocabulary\nit becomes your mindset it becomes your\nthought and then it becomes your reality\nand and your spawner i love what you\nsaid about\nbeing in front of god\nand you saying i can't do this i can't\ndo that and god's given you back\nexactly exactly what you're repeating\nhe's like you're right man you can yeah\nall right\nyeah you said it yeah and that is such a\ngreat way of thinking about it yeah as a\nconversation around how we're creating\nour reality\nthrough our repetition yeah i can't wait\nto talk to you about being a monk too\nthat's like when we have dinner next\nweek next week\nsome\nbut um one of the things that you that\nmade me think about this is when i would\ncome home and watch bob ross on pbs\npainting the pictures or\nwhen i would watch michael jordan and\nall these and kobe bryant\nand all these inspiring people\nwhen i was growing up\nmike tyson writer just michael jackson\nanybody that i can think of\nuh\ni like i like our like artwork on the\nwall a few people you mentioned are up\nthere yeah yeah but when i was thinking\nabout that\nit just brings me back to uh\ntechnique\nhow much life how much\nof life is truly technique\nand that is one of the biggest secrets\ni've learned um\nwhen i was going through one of the\nroughest times of my life a few years\nago\ni just turned 30\nand i was feeling so depressed bro\num and i just moved into my house that\ni've been in for a few years\nin beverly hills right\nslashes i got it from slash from guns\nand roses\nyou know\nall these name all of my neighbors are\nyou know vanna white is my neighbor i'm\nlike talking like this is like to me\nthis was like my dream this is my dream\nneighborhood right\nand\ni was in the worst condition of my life\nbro i just felt\ni felt it was just too hard for me to\neven get through the day\ni felt like\nhow did you get there why did it get\nthere after all of this envisioning\nfocus inner work how did it get there\nyou know why i got there\nbecause\ni lost touch with it a little bit not\njust because of that i burned myself out\ni wasn't paying attention to what myself\nwas saying to me i was doing it for all\ndifferent other reasons\ni need to do this show i need to do five\nshows so i can get this money take care\nof this person and do it for this\nah my management everybody is expecting\nme i got all these people i got people\nwho are on my payrolls i'm like i'm\nputting everybody before me yeah i\ndidn't know how to balance\num\nwork\nand\nwork\nbecause there's a work that you do for\nyour career and there's a work that you\ndo for yourself yes no one ever taught\nme that because no one knew\nno one knew you know no one knew like\nthis is something that my dad didn't\nknow this is something my mom didn't\nknow their mentality is you work as hard\nas you can you work as hard as you can\nso i come from a place where it's like\nyou got to keep the foot on there next\nyou got to keep going hard you don't\nwant to lose your opportunity yeah that\nwas my thinking\nbut really i had already had it yeah you\nknow i already have it so now to take it\nto another place i got to take care of\nmyself so i can bring my best self to\nthe table and it's something that life\nforced me to do\nit's something that like forced me to do\nman and i had to stop everything i was\ndoing and completely fall back bro\ncompletely fall back from\nlooking at things about me from being\nonline completely far back from all the\nobligations i had to do\nperformances money i was losing like\nit was just like i had to fall back from\neverything\nand take some time and that's when i met\nmarie diamond\nand obviously i had no i\nseen her on the secret i was you know i\nknew about her\nand my mom taking one of her classes\nemailed marie diamond and was like hey\nmy son is a musician this and this and\nthis\nand then she got an email back from\nmarie diamond she my mom was freaking\nout\nand\nmarie diamond said\nthis is so crazy because my son has sean\non his vision board wow and she was i've\nnever worked with a rapper you know i've\nnever done anything like this she's\nworked with\nbig people you know big big clients\nbut uh anyway\nuh\nthat was a serendipity you know that was\na meant to be thing and\nit came at a time right where i needed\nit and i just\ni got into the technique of loving\nmyself bro bringing it back to the point\ni said earlier when i would look at bob\nross and michael jordan's all technique\nso much of life is technique what you do\nis technique\nbecause it's you know i had to get into\nthe technique of loving myself\ni had to really make sure that i put\nmyself as a priority my meditations came\nbefore anything me writing down my\nintentions\nyou know every day or every other day or\nyou know writing my thoughts down like\nthat was a priority to me\num spend just spending time for myself\nbeing out in nature right working uh\nworking i started taking care of myself\nmore working out\nthat's something i never did i gained 30\npounds i gained 30 pounds wow yeah we\ngot to show like a beforehand yeah yeah\nyeah we'll get it we'll get it for this\ncrazy i used to look totally different\nit changed me for the better and it just\nit's just it's built my strength up it's\ngiving me more strength to deal with\nthings when they don't go my way before\nit would tear me down before i used to\nlet people's opinions about me\nreally did really affect me yeah same\nand now it's like what was i even\nwhat am i even thinking right now you\nknow what i mean you could it's crazy\nhow we can look and see\na comment that's like i love you i\nappreciate you you changed my life\namazing man this guy sucks\nand we'd be like man this dude just said\ni suck\ni'm doing something wrong you know it's\ncrazy how our mind immediately goes\nthere because our ego yeah you know or\nmaybe because something else but i think\nit's just that ego it is\ntell me about\nwhy do you think delusion is useful and\nwhere have you also seen it be dangerous\nbecause i think both is well i think it\nkind of depends on what reality you're\ntrying to create\nbut i do believe in\nyou know i used to walk around saying\nall my beats are a million dollars a\nbeat and\ni'm a billionaire and i just went\nplatinum eight times these are all\nthings i would say like that would have\nnot happened and they were insane me and\nbugis my best friend who started diamond\nhe put out a um\na project back in\n2011 and we called it 2020 and i\nproduced the whole thing and we did the\nentire album from the perspective of\n2020. so it was like we're on rolls\nroyces and we just made millions of like\nit was all just distorted reality but\nit ended up becoming reality so i do\nbelieve that\nif you want to change your reality you\nhave to already believe that it is your\nreality but obviously if you like are\ntrying to do something evil or\nill-intent it's not gonna be great for\neveryone else but yeah just before we\nstarted recording we were talking about\nyou know being creative\nand being busy\nand you said something really\ninteresting you were just like you know\ni'm always creative i've always got\nstuff going on here and then you're like\nthere's some days where i don't you know\nfeeling lazy like\nwalk us through that because as someone\nwho's super creative who's loved for\nyour creativity\nand how original your work is and that's\nwhy i've always liked you i've always\nthought your sound\nis very original and unique and it's\nhard to like be like it's like oh it\nsounds like that person or sounds like\nit's like oh no no this is original like\nthat's where i've always resonated with\nyour work tell us about\nhow that\nis something you achieve even though\nthere are days where you kind of feel\nlike i just want to sleep all day or\nwhatever yeah it's tough because uh me\nand bowie's talk about it all the time\nthe highs and lows of an artist is\nreally\ndramatic at least for me like i'll have\ndays if i go into the studio and make\nsomething i love\ni'm like on cloud nine like everything\nis great in my life\nbut then i go to sleep and i wake up and\nthat next day none of that matters like\ni move on very quickly\nand and i'm just like okay now i need to\nmake another one but if i can't make\nanother one if that day i'm just not\nfeeling it or i go to the studio and i\ntry nothing works i'm like this is\ni should just give up this is this is it\ni'll never get a creative sourcing you\nknow what i mean and it gets very like\nyou sink really low sometimes especially\nif you go for me i make so much music\nthat if i don't make a song for four\ndays i'm like this is crazy like what's\nhappening i'm depressed so it's hard but\nyou got to just remember that um\nyou just have to have faith in sort of\nthe creator in the infinite and you know\ni don't feel like i really\nmake music i feel like i deliver it you\nknow because i feel like it when i have\nthose moments it's just something that's\ncoming to me and i'm the vessel and now\ni'm just delivering it and i'm executing\nit and i'm almost discovering it in the\nstudio i don't know if i'm creating i'm\ndiscovering it if that makes sense so\nyou're not always gonna be in that place\nwhere you're getting the message and\nyou're getting the energy so this is\nwhat it is it's just hard it's the\nwaiting time in between will make you\nfeel like this is it i'll never make\nanother song\nwhat makes you feel that i love what you\njust said about delivering versus\ncreating i i think that's phenomenal and\nit's explained really well\nwhat makes you feel like you're in\nalignment where you can deliver\nversus forcing you to create like what\nare the things that lack of thought\nright yeah lack of thought those times\nwhere you get into that place where\nyou're not thinking and you're just\nfeeling and like i said just delivering\nlike i'm not even thinking about what oh\nshould i say this like you get the\ninspiration and you just execute it\nthat's when you just enter that flow\nstate and it's just special you know but\nit's tricky it's hard especially like i\nsaid as i got\nnot even necessarily older just more\nvisibility there's outside chatter now\nin my head you know what people are\ngonna think i know that i'm not just\nreleasing it to my friends anymore like\nyou know so it's it's become trickier to\ntune out everything but um yeah man just\ntry to focus on the present moment\nthat's like what the one thing that i\nlearned this past year was really like\nhow do i slow down\ntime and i was like okay well the way i\nslow down time is to slow down my\nthoughts and the way i slow down my\nthoughts is to be present you know you\nnotice if you're just\nmindless and you're you know you're\nmaking a sandwich but you're thinking\nabout oh my god what i need to do\ntomorrow and what all of a sudden two\nhours passes right but if you really\nthink about like\nyou know you cutting the sandwich and\nwhat that's like and you stepping on the\ngrass and what your feet feel like time\nmoves really slow you realize how slow\ntime moves so i just try to do that i\ntry to stay in the present even in the\nstudio you know i don't try to\nuh\nhave my thoughts already beyond when\nthis comes out and this is gonna be like\nthis and how's it gonna go then i'm just\nlike man let me just like actually hear\nthe music and feel the music and just\noperate from this place i love hearing\nyou talk about this man because you know\nthese are some of the principles that\ni'm constantly sharing in my work yeah\nbut hearing how it applies to a music\nartist in your career\nit brings me so much joy yeah because\nit's practical it's real like you've got\ntime pressures you've got\nyou've got uh pressures from\nlabels collaborations whatever it may be\nlike there are real life pressures but\nwhen i hear you say that and that's how\nyou feel aligned\nhow did you get introduced to this\nwork or this set of thoughts and beliefs\nand mindsets was it something that you\nhad since you were a kid or where did\nyou start exploring with the idea of\nbeing present experiencing fear delivery\nthe present moment is recent because you\nknow what i didn't need i felt almost\nlike i didn't need to be present i guess\nwhen i was coming up because there\nwasn't anything pulling me away from the\npresent moment i kind of only had the\npresent moment if that makes sense it\nwas just me and bugis in the basement\nmaking songs and that was it there\nwasn't\ntours coming up and videos\nyou know there was none of that so\nuh\nbut as this past year and past couple\nyears have been happening i got into the\npower of now book and just sort of just\nthe whole ideology around just being\npresent started reading more into that\nwhole\ntheory and i just i bought you know i\nbought into it a lot of this stuff\npeople don't realize that a lot of the\nstuff like\nthe teachings the self-help stuff\nyou have to be open to receiving it you\nknow and if you're not open to receiving\nand you're not willing to buy into it\nthen i you know i hear you but god bless\nyou know i can only tell people it works\nfor me\num but it worked for me you know\nbeing president yeah i love that you\nmentioned the power of now and then when\nyou talk about flow state yeah for\nanyone who's listening if you've not\nread that book it's a brilliant book as\nwell flow state yeah it's called flow\nand for anyone who doesn't know flow the\nway it's defined in that book is where\nyour skills meet your challenge exactly\nso i saw like a youtube video yes that\nwas like enough for me\ni should read the book though yeah no no\nno but you brought it up and it's it's a\nbrilliant concept and you're really\nexperiencing that because most people it\nsays experience when their challenge is\nabove their skills and so they feel\nfrustrated disappointed when they give\nup yeah all their skills are above their\nchallenge and then they feel bored\nbecause they actually have more skills\nthan what they're trying to achieve and\ni think that's i fell into that a little\nbit which is why i started working with\noutside producers because\nit was so easy for me to just like go\ndownstairs and make like a rust song you\nknow like i have a million beats i can\nmake it be boom do this it's like\nalright cool whatever\nyou know but it kind of i got into like\na rut creatively because i was making\nsongs but i was like i don't even it\njust wasn't even that fun you know\nand i think it was because it wasn't\nthat challenging anymore so\num\ni started working with outside producers\nwhere it was like okay this is a bit of\na challenge and then further i started\ntrying to get on beats even if no one\nhears them i started to get on\nproduction\nthat i don't like in a sense\nalmost to just be like can i make a song\nout of this wow yeah just like because i\ngot the studio in my house and i don't\nneed anyone to record me so i can just\nbe down there like experimenting so\nthere's been beats that producers send\nme and i'm like i don't like this at all\nbut i wonder if i can make a song out of\nit and it becomes this cool little like\nfun project and a lot of times it's\nturned into songs that i'm like this is\ncrazy wow like i get so much more\nfulfillment out of it because i couldn't\nsee it coming\na lot of my songs i'm like before you\nknow when i'm making the beat\ni already know what the whole song's\ngonna sound like and most of those\nusually end up being very successful so\ni'm not gonna downplay them but it does\nmake the process\nnot as\nuh\non an easter egg hunt yeah yeah yeah so\nyeah yeah i love hearing that because\nthat's putting yourself in an\nuncomfortable situation right and most\nof us avoid that yeah yeah yeah most of\nus just want to hear a beat and feel\nsomething straight away right we'll see\nbecause people are around other people i\nwould never i would probably never do\nthat if there was people in the studio\nyeah with me like\nactually out of all the beats you played\ngive me the one i don't like and i'm\njust gonna try to make something you\nknow what i mean yeah i like that's why\ni always tell people whatever your craft\nis make sure you have it in your house\nif you can because\nthose\nmoments of solitude when you can kind of\njust be weird and\nyou know experiment and dance around\ncrazy and be nuts that's where you're\nreally gonna you know i have a i have a\nline where i say the public praises\npeople for what they practice in private\nyou know so\nuh\ni just feel like that's when you got to\nhone in on everything is what you're\ndoing in private so i like when i'm by\nmyself in the studio i'll be getting\nweird\n[Laughter]\ncan you tell us what's the weirdest\nthing that's ever happened\ni mean it's not that weird but\nit's like when i'm by myself i'll put on\na beat that i'm like i don't even know\nwhat i'm about to do on this and i'll\njust put the auto tune all the way up\nand go stand in the booth for 60 takes\njust wailing\nand just making noises and i'll be like\nthis is wild or this is trash but this\nwas really cool you know like i sent my\nmanager some song i did\nuh\nwhere i made a beat\nand i just put the auto-tune on full\nblast and just freestyled the whole song\nand i was like i just had to get it out\nyeah but it was cool but like i would\nnever put it out but it was awesome dude\nthis is so inspiring i i that's i love\nthat approach yeah it's just\nit's so refreshing hearing that it's a\nrefreshing process yeah you know because\nyou get so rigid with like your process\nand this is what i do and we sit here\nand i make this kind of song\nit's like every once in a while you have\nto shake the snow globe that's where\nthat whole concept came from you have to\njust\nyou know it's like the tin man and\nwas it awesome turn the auto-tune up and\nput on some crazy heat and let me just\nbe a maniac for an hour it breaks the\nformula we work in this formulaic yeah\nproduct line manufacturing and you don't\nyou can't manufacture greatness that's\nfrom school yeah that's from school\nschool is such a factory\nsetup you know how were you at school\nwhat kind of i was incredible at school\nto be honest i'm not even a lie i was i\nwas like i'm really not i was not one of\nthose like yeah i struggled in school\nand it was difficult i was really really\ngood at school because i wouldn't apply\nmyself but i was definitely the kid who\nlike\ndidn't study never did homework but i\nwould get a's and b's on all the tests\nand so i was just like\nbut i would be like you know i was\nsecond i always say this and it's not\neven something i'm necessarily proud of\nbut it just gives context but like a\nsenior superlative i was\nlike second for most likely to make a\nteacher retire\nbecause i was just the kid in class like\nconstantly talking distracting people\nchallenging the teacher but i had an a\nin the class so i was just super\nannoying\nwhich i know is a surprise to so many\npeople\nand so tell me go back to the point you\nwere making before before i interjected\naround why you think that factory yes\nwell yeah because you know you're you\nhave an expiration date as a kid in\nschool you got to be out by a certain\ntime in high school whatever age it is\nuh\ngo to this department of the building\nwhen the bell rings you know what i mean\nit's just very like\nlike there's no creativity in there you\nknow that's why i'm really big on having\narts in schools and you know just\nbecause otherwise you just i don't know\njust like creates these robots i love\nthat you break the mold how do you get\nto a point though where you've\nwhat i find fascinating already your\nprocess is fascinating to me what i find\nmore interesting though\nis that your\nyour ability to trust yourself yeah when\nyou come up with something insane\nbecause very few people ever allow\nthemselves to do a wild card thing right\nnow when you do a wild card thing in the\nstudio on your own and you discover\nsomething like a sound or a auto tune or\nwhatever it is and you discover a\na b\nor a sound that yeah oh i like this how\ndo you then trust yourself\nto go with that when now when you play\nit to someone they might be like all\nright you're crazy russ like this is\nnever gonna work how do you then\napproach that it's that level of it's\nthat stain of confidence that's just you\ncan't remove i just still oh like unnas\nhas this quote in an interview i believe\nwhere he said if it doesn't scare you\nyou shouldn't put it out\nso\ni've always kind of like kept that in\nthe back of my head you know i usually\nmove with that and i'm and i'm cool with\nthat i like that with my fans what i've\ncreated is this trust and this\nunpredicted uh un predictably\nunpredictable sort of\nrelationship where they know they can\nexpect me to be doing the unexpected\nmeeting they know\nit might be raps they know it might be\nsinging but they don't know what it's\ngoing to sound like but they know it's\ngoing to be me and so i think i've done\na very good job at painting my canvas\nand kind of giving people who i am so\nit's allowed me a lot of creative\nfreedom i always tell up and coming\nartists like when you're coming up you\ndon't want it then this is my opinion\nwhen you're coming up and you're\nbuilding your fan base\nyou're conditioning them to expect a\ncertain thing from you a certain sound\nor whatever\nand you're\nyou're creating this creative window a\nlot of people if you just come up only\nrapping right you get your whole fan\nbase off of only rapping\nlet's say you know you just\nyou haven't really fully tapped into you\nyet and now you want to start singing a\nlot of fans are going to be like\nyou switched up what are you doing did\nit\nand you know you could lose a lot of\npeople and they might think that you're\nchanging when really the whole time\nthat's been you you just didn't have\nenough time to discover it so i was\nreally proud of myself that i was able\nto kind of give people the whole scope\nof my creativity so that when i do go\nleft field no one's gonna be like what\nare you doing because it's kind of like\noh yeah that's russ just being russ like\nwe know that sometimes he's giving us\nred sometimes it's yellow sometimes it's\norange whatever you know that's kind of\nwhy i did the artworks all like that too\nyeah just to let you know that all my\nmusic is all different colors it's not\njust one\njust spending this time with you already\nand even when you came in and stuff like\nyou're someone who's\nwho's very comfortable in their own skin\nbut at the same time you're not arrogant\nand egotistic\ndid everyone hear that yeah i'm just\nthat's a first you know no i agree too i\nthink i fought into the own narrative he\ndoesn't have an ego no i definitely\nhaven't no i mean in the sense of let's\nyeah let's talk about ego for a bit\nbecause and and i mean in a good way i\nwas saying as a compliment that\ni feel that you have a very\nuh you know what from what i'm hearing\nor at least and i'm only basing on this\nconversation i've had with you but\nit's like there's a stability between\nlike knowing you want to learn more and\nbe better yeah but you are confident\nabout who you are and where you are\nwhich is which is a beautiful place to\nbe by the way thank you who doesn't want\nto be between those two things yeah uh\nhow have you\ntempered\nthat\nego that we all have\nwith the desire to learn and grow and\nrealize there's more to go but i'm\nreally happy with what i've done because\nthat's what i'm hearing yeah but i want\nto kind of break that down for people\nbecause i think a lot of people live in\neither extreme either they're\ncelebrating their last win right for\nlike seven years right or\nthey're just like i'm the worst i'm\nnever gonna win i'm never gonna win and\nthey don't appreciate where they are\nyeah i think for me to be honest despite\nperception or whatever\num i had to hype myself up i had to be\nthe biggest believer of myself that's\nthe only reason why any of this worked\nand i think that and because i'm very\nvocal about it because i'm putting it\nout into the universe so that it comes\nback it could come off like i think\ni have nothing left to learn and no\nnobody can offer me anything and i know\nit's like no y'all just don't know what\nself-belief sounds like clearly um you\nmight know what it looks like and some\npeople are just more\nquiet about their self-belief just to\nget people to like them otherwise you\nget kind of my perception but\nbut no i've always still been a massive\nfan of people and a massive\njust\nsupporter of anything dope anyone anyone\nthat knows me from when i was\nnothing to\nnow from two years old to now like if\nyou're dope at anything i'm always the\nfirst person to like root for you\ndm you send you advice like bro hit me\nanytime\nand\neven just looking up to people i'm i'm a\nfan out i'm like yo you're incredible i\nwould love to work with you i'm that\nperson too so\ni don't know i just\nthere's it's the duality you are able to\nhave the utmost confidence in yourself\nwhile still also knowing that okay but\nthis person is really dope too and if we\ncome together it could be really fire\ni'm just really confident in myself and\nso i'm not desperate to reach after\ncollabs and things like that but it\ndoesn't mean i don't think that i know\neverything and you know i'm always\nasking all my like my engineer friends\nlike yo what plugin is that like this is\ncrazy oh you're fired you know people\nguess you could ask even like kid super\nwhen i first met him the dude who made\nthis sweater uh he did my gypsy video\nyears ago like 2014\nand when i first met him he thought i\nwas hella weird because or like socially\nawkward because i kept giving him mad\ncompliments\nbecause i was so it was like my first\nreal kind of video ish even though it\nwasn't like some big production but i\nwas just so enamored by the process and\ni thought it was so dope that i'm just\nlike that's who i am i'm a very\ncomplimentary person and like i'm always\ngonna give people their flowers and he\nwas just like i'm like nah i genuinely\nfeel like that so i don't know i've\nalways been able to have that level of\nduality yeah i love the idea of that\nthat paradox like it feels like uh it\nfeels like it's not allowed like it\nsounds like it should not be\npossible to think both those things yeah\nbut actually that's where all the magic\nhappens i agree right like that you we\nalways think no you have to choose you\nhave to decide or you're either raw but\nactually hearing you say that\nyeah actually i i think both those\nthings yeah uh i i love that and i love\nhow that doesn't stop you from\nappreciating others yeah uh who was it\nthat\nappreciated your sound earlier on that\nyou think made a difference to you and\nand may you know guided you or was it\njust you for yourself it was me and\nprobably bugis\nlike\nyou know for the longest time it was\njust bugis rapping and me producing\nand that was\nuh my closest example of like someone\nwho i thought had really good taste and\ni trusted their opinion artistically so\nwhen bugis gave me the green light to be\nlike yo yeah you should rap\nit was just kind of like okay well game\nover for everyone else like if bugas\nthinks it's tight\nyou know so and that's how it still is\nlike\num\nyou know you it's it's important to have\nyou only need one but it's important to\nhave at least one person who\nbelieves in you sometimes almost more\nthan you\nand and there is no\njealousy or weird\nuh you can't win because then i won't\nwin like it's a very weird thing so i\nalways you know commend boogies for\nbeing like the best friend you could\nhave in something that i'm doing you\nknow what i mean yeah let's talk about\nthat i like what you brought there about\nmen specifically like\nand you took me straight back to like my\nteenagers where yeah i'd be best friend\nwith a dude and he'd be like my brother\nbut then we'd go out and he'd be like\nall right let's see you can get more\ngirls today right like that would be his\nmentality or like well like oh let's see\nwho who'll be better at the sport today\nand it was every time i've realized that\neveryone in my life or male\nrelationships\nif every time a guy a friend of mine has\ntried to turn a friendship into a\ncompetition yeah they haven't lost it in\nmy life yeah like they're no longer in\nmy life because i just wanted to be\nfriends well now don't get me wrong me\nand bugas dumb competitive okay\nexplain we played basketball together\nlike anything me and boogies will turn\ninto a competition for sure but when it\ncomes to a dream you're following after\nlike it's never like yo how many streams\ndid your song do bro\nyou know what i'm saying it's never been\nthat how do you build that balance what\nis it about him and what is it about you\nthat allows you to build that kind of a\nfriendship because i think that's rare\nyeah i think especially in today's\nsocial media world stream world i mean\nfollowers views\ncomments engagement all this stuff that\nwe all talk about i think we're both\ntrying to do the same thing you know and\nwe're both\nuh we were both real friends before all\nthis and we both understood you know we\nread napoleon hill so we understand the\npower of a mastermind and we just as big\nof egos as me and him have we never let\nit get in the way\nof like supporting one another and any\nof that you know so i don't know i just\nthink it comes down to the person like\nhow real are you you know some people\nare just fake this is what it is yeah\nyeah no and that and that\nidea of being able to have at least even\none person just one that's all you want\nyou don't need\nyeah because sometimes we try and we\nwant 10 or 20 like that and you're right\nfor most of us we're lucky to have one\nyeah and that's that's a good enough\nstart you mentioned napoleon hill and\nmastermind when what age were you when\nyou read that book 17. bugis gave me the\nbook so bugis was putting me on to a lot\nof that stuff he put me onto napoleon\nhill he put me on to the alchemist\num\nyou know so\nthat's the thing we weren't just like\nthe i would say the like typical 17 18\nyear olds you know hanging out we\ngraduated high school 17\nand we just were locked in the studio\nfrom then until now you know so it was a\nlot of self-discovery but\nout the gate once we left high school we\nwere reading those books so it was just\nkind of like\nwe were ready to go mentally like we\nread those books and we we're both the\nkind of the kind of people\nthat\nwe buy into something quick and then we\nlatch on to it and then that's that\nyou know if that's what we believe you\ncan't tell us anything different you\nknow like if i'm go i went vegan for a\nyear because i watched one documentary\nand like that was that like once\nsomething clicks in my brain\ni'm done you know i mean like right now\ni haven't had bread or grains in two\nweeks because i just like woke up and it\nclicked like my brother nutritionist\ntold me and i latched on to him boom\nthat's it i've like me and him have\nalways been very good at just once we\ndecide something that's what it is he\nlost a bunch of weight you know 30 40\npounds because he just decided i'm done\nyou know so\nonce me and him decided this is what we\nwere doing with our lives there was no\nyeah but maybe we're not doing it with\nour lives or\nthis was it and we were both fully\ncommitted and every day and every like\nevery second of our lives was committed\nto this you know\nuh it was just something i did in within\nmy community but um by as circumstance\ngoes you know sometimes destiny finds\nyou and and and you try and push\nsomething away\nmany times i think you know jay and i've\nhad probably many conversations over the\nyears where i've been like i just don't\nknow if this is what i meant to do or\nlike yeah i do this you know that kind\nof thing where you you keep trying to\nturn away from something but it kept\ncoming back to me kept knocking on my\ndoor just kept on trying to go no music\nyeah\nno music yeah like yes yeah you know\nlike when you have to write a um on a\nform you know occupation\nand i would always stop and be like\nwhat do i write there you know am i\nbecause i i was a i\ni wrote i did art i was i was a dancer\nbut i didn't want to write musician or\nartist or writer i just didn't know what\nto write because i didn't fully identify\nwith being able to say this is what i am\nso yeah it came it came bit by bit and i\nthink one of the big catalysts for me\nwith feeling confident to\ntry to accept the role of\nyou know embracing my my uh creativity\nand and engaging it in service of\nspreading this type of music more\nis the fact that\nyoga meditation mindfulness those things\nover the last 10 years became so much\nmore mainstream than they ever were and\nwhen i was a child i never would have\nimagined that would be the case i\nthought that that was just the strange\nway that i grew up you know and that\nlike kids used to ask me like so why\ndon't you you know like why are you\nvegetarian and what do you why do you\nhave a name like that and stuff like\nthat\n[Laughter]\nbut now it's like no this is pretty it's\npretty normal especially in l.a yeah\nso yeah it's it's been a it's been a\njourney but i'm so grateful to be doing\nthis now it brings me so much\nfulfillment yeah we're grateful to you\ntoo for sticking it through and and\ncontinuing on and\nwe're never going to let you quit\nfunny\nmusic is going to keep\nbut we love that yeah we love that\nboth of you for everyone who's listening\nand watching i think there's such a\npressure these days for young people\nespecially to find their purpose\nor discover what they want to do for the\nrest of their lives and you can see in\nboth of the way you are experiencing\nit's kind of not been like that it's\nkind of been much more of this\nmeandering path than kind of getting\nlost and then refining and then feeling\nstuck and then questioning everything\nand then finding it and this almost like\nmagical approach to like i found my\npurpose so i found my you know calling\nit doesn't work like that and it's nice\nto see two people who are\ncreating an artistic but it's kind of\ncoming over time it's such a process\nit's such a journey and there's so many\ninternal\nobstacles that need to be looked at and\nthat need to be worked on until you can\nstep into your calling until you can\nstep into your purpose fully\num and god knows i'm still trying to\nstep in yes i'm still trying to step in\nyeah what would you say are both of your\num i don't know daily things that you do\nin your lives that help enrich you or\nuplift you what are the things that\nyou've started to do yeah i think on a\ndaily basis because i feel like they're\nthe things that really make you know a\ndifference if you're doing something\nregularly\nyeah\ni've watched a few of you now\n[Laughter]\nwell i i find um\nthat daily meditation daily i practice\nmantra meditation daily and that is\nsomething that um i really hold on to\nlike i imagine\nyou know if you take life to be like a\nriver that is the current is flowing\nvery fast um in some of these sacred\nrivers in india where people uh they\ntake a dip you know as a purifying kind\nof act\nthey have these metal chains that are in\nthe water that you hold onto when you go\nin to make sure you don't get swept away\nso i i see the the mantra meditation um\nas sort of like this chain to hold on to\nin the rushing current of life\nand it really even though it's not it's\nnot easy i know willow has you know a\nyoga practice you've been cultivating\nfor a long time to do anything daily is\nnot an easy thing and you don't always\nfeel like doing it and sometimes you do\nit robotically and then you're like ugh\nyou know i gotta come back to you know\nthe deeper reason of why i'm doing this\nbut to just keep that commitment um\nit develops a relationship with\nsacred space within it develops a\nrelationship with the divine that really\nis\nit's it's a lifesaver it's it's um it\ngives me inspiration it gives me sense\nof connection and it and it's a\nmeditation that the particular mantra\nthat i that i recite daily\nthe meditation is on how can i be of\nservice and a prayer for service please\nallow me to be of service in this life\nso i love how willow was describing that\nthat that service it brings you out of\nthat space because every day we have to\npush against\nour\ntendency to be self-absorbed it's like\nat every moment we tend to be caught in\nour head thinking about our own\nworries and things like that and and to\nturn that around to\nhow can i serve it's\nit's such a dramatic you know state\nchange and\nso for me that helps it helps then you\nknow whether i'm doing one thing or\nanother just to to keep connecting with\nthat um\ncore reason of why of what is yeah what\nis the purpose of my existence to serve\nit makes things it makes things a lot\nmore simpler and joyful yeah\ni i'm just going to piggyback off of\nwhat what janavi said um yes i've been\ncultivating a yoga practice for about i\nwant to say\ntwo years\noh we see those pokes yeah\nyeah yeah i want to say two years or a\nyear and a half um\nand you know another thing\naside from meditation that i try to do\ndaily sometimes it doesn't happen\num i read every day\nright now i'm reading inner engineering\nby sad guru so that's something that\ni've been putting my time into every day\nso\nwhether it's you know literature yoga or\nmeditation one of those things is\nhappening every day so i'm just like\njohn levy said i truly believe that that\nconsistency and that repetition is\nwhat's needed in order to\nget into a state where it is second\nnature where you don't have to think\nabout it anymore where it's habitual\nexactly and that's that's where i'm\ntrying to be that's where i'm striving\nto i think what you both are doing\nkeeping it consistent that's probably\nhow\nyou know you've realized what the\nbenefits are that living a life without\nit\nthat feels more unnatural than than\ndoing the practice oh i was thinking\nabout how you know both of your\npractices are things which people have\nbeen doing for years such an ancient\nthing that people have been doing but\nwhat's incredible about your music is\nthat it's i think it's shown so many\npeople who are probably unfamiliar with\nmeditation unfamiliar with yoga or see\nit as something that's so\nunfamiliar um that you know\nmeditation music or mountain music is\nfor everybody like it's such a universal\nthing yeah that um so many different\ntypes of people can connect to it just\nby your different backgrounds that you\ntwo have connected to it in such a\ndifferent way um and how you're sharing\nit it's yeah it's beautiful to see how\ndifferent meditation music and\ndevotional music can actually be and how\nmany different types of people it can it\ncan connect yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm glad\nyou put that bass on it so i could turn\nit up in the car\ni love it the first time i heard it i\nwas telling jelly it was just like\nyou've learned it's just all the music\nwhat you've made\nis it's like that perfect combination\nbetween being timeless and pure\nbut then being current and relevant\nexactly and you've created in my in my\nopinion whatever it's worth like it\nsounds like a no genre like it's it's\nnew it's different it's it's not you\ncan't just go oh yeah that's that kind\nof music i wouldn't even put it under\nmeditational music like it's it's beyond\nthat\nand i think that you know credit to both\nof your artistry to be able to expand\nthat much what's different about\ncreating devotional music for both of\nyou and generally for you to stretch out\nyour comfort zone from a music place of\nnow creating this new genre that you\nhave together\nso for willow for you more like what's\nwhat's different about korean devotional\nmusic for you from your perspective and\ngenerally from yours like almost going\nthe other way and like oh now we're\ncreating something a bit newer to what\ni'm used to yeah um you know my lyrics\nthat you know in the willow album and\nin ardipithecus my first album um you\nknow i talk a lot about duality i talk a\nlot about spirit i talk a lot about you\nknow cycles i have a song that's called\ncycles on on my first album the language\nis very\nmodern\nand what i love about sanskrit is that\nit it's deeper than language\num and i think the the real difference\nis bringing that\num ancient vibration to it\nthat isn't just coming from me it's\ncoming from generations and generations\nof of deeply spiritual individuals\nwho have carried this on and i think you\nknow feeling that is\nis the biggest difference for me because\nit's not just me coming up with\nsomething\nwow\nthat's really powerful yeah that's\nincredible to think of it like that\nthat's so well articulate that's\nbeautiful thank you\nyou accept me\noh my gosh oh yeah wow\nwow i've just been i've been hit by your\nby your articulation of that that's so\nbeautiful\nyeah i think it's so interesting because\ni think\nfor me it was almost\ni wouldn't say the opposite because\nnaturally we're trying to retain the the\npurity of devotional space\nand like with with recording we set up a\nlittle altar like in this in the studio\nit's it's really nice to have that feel\nto be a sacred space\nyeah but um with this ep um\nbecause most of the time i'm\nsinging mantra which\ni which obviously those words are not\nmine i'm putting my heart my prayer into\nit but i'm also trusting the power of\nthat\nancient vibration that timeless\nvibration to touch the heart of another\nand then and for that reason i don't i\ndon't take credit when someone has you\nknow a powerful experience with it's\nlike oh yeah that's that's what it does\nthat's what it does to me too so i'm\njust trying to you know be facilitate\nthis experience but with this uh album i\ndefinitely was stretching myself because\ni think\njust before we came together i was i'd\nbeen recently feeling a lot more\ninspired to\nto write lyrics in english that convey\nsome of these ideas and and themes\nwhich was daunting for me because it's\nnot something i it's something i hardly\never do\nlet alone record i i have tons of voice\nnotes in my phone which will never see\nthe light of day you know ideas that\ni've had but it was so cool because i\ndidn't think we would actually work on\nthose things but when i showed some of\nthem to willow she was so\num\nencouraging and excited about it and i\nwas sort of like well what do you think\nlike you add your lyrics into she was\nlike no i love this i think we should go\nfor it i was like really\nand then so to to actually bring some of\nthose ideas to life um\nfor me that was a beautiful experience\nof being able to\ncome outside of the space of okay this\nis just mantra it's not me but here's\nthis here's this you know ancient sound\nvibration to actually hear some words\nthat i wrote which convey\nhow i want to you know take a snapshot\nof this um\nthis sentiment for instance of surrender\nor um what you've experienced how i've\nexperienced or what or or what's\nmeaningful to me or to us you know and\nand for me that was a really uh\nthat was extremely powerful it i came\naway being like whoa i i didn't know i\ncould do yeah\nyes so i'm so grateful for that yeah it\nwas it was\nit was beautiful yeah i could feel i\ncould feel that that sense of hesitancy\nthat's why i was like yeah\ni was like let's go full flag\nare you sure she's like let's do it yeah\nyeah because i was like you you gonna\nknow the the greatness of you today\nwhat's the uh\nboth of you live real lives in the real\nworld you know you you go through your\nchallenges every single day\nand people who listen to this are going\nthrough their own challenges what's been\nsomething that's been really beautiful\nor powerful for both of you individually\nthat you feel has helped you\ndiscover answers at tough times or find\nnew directions at tough times what is it\nthat both of you have turned to in your\nown life whether it be musical or not\nthat that you think that\nalmost what is it that people can do to\nexpress themselves more because it feels\nlike so many of our feelings do get\nbottled up and\ndo just get thought about inside what\nhas been powerful for you individually i\nmean it might it might be a little um\nunorthodox\nbut i actually really really enjoy\nlooking at myself in the mirror\nand\nexplaining like like telling like having\na conversation with myself basically\nlike when i'm when i'm having tough\nemotions that i feel like\ni don't want to express to other people\nor i feel like\nembarrassed or whatever it is\num\ni always try to like just look at myself\nand be like no you're valid like explain\nthe full depth of everything that you're\nfeeling and then look at yourself and\nlike explain back to yourself why\nwhy\nthose emotions\nnot why those emotions are okay but\naccepting yourself in a certain way\num\nand you know sometimes when the face\ntime doesn't work and people don't\nanswer their phone you can talk to\nyourself yeah and it does work\nit does work for me it does\ni love that that's so good yeah i've\nnever heard anyone do that in the mirror\ntaking journaling to another level yeah\nyou're actually facing yourself which i\nthink a lot of the times we are battling\nwith our own self rather than with other\npeople and so actually like looking at\nyourself in the mirror and\nand speaking to yourself is so powerful\nit gets deep the tears start flowing and\nthen you start looking at yourself\nexactly and you're like dang like i see\nyou like you're we're together in this\nlike we got each other i love that yeah\nyeah\nthat's awesome i hope everyone tries\nthat out this week yeah everybody's\nlistening and watching try it out\ni'm being serious\nsometimes i feel weird saying it because\npeople you know are like that's\nridiculous but\ni've done it and it has stopped the\ntears\nwow\nyeah i was thinking as you were speaking\nthat for me um\nwriting has always been a powerful one\nand it's funny because i i think of the\npage being like a mirror and i think\nmany people find writing to be like that\nyeah um to the point where i remember\nsome\ndifficult points in my life\nwhere i didn't write for a very long\ntime for probably two years i didn't\nwrite anything on a page because i was\nafraid of what would come out and what i\nwould see\ni felt just this complete block you know\nand\nthen to release that to start i always\nfeel such a relief when i put a pen on\nthe paper and start to write and i was\nintroduced to the practice of\nfree writing some some\nyears ago there's a famous book called\nthe artist's way by julia cameron and\nthis practice of mourning pages\nis something that many people have found\na lot of uh\nyeah just\nincredible experiences from so i i\nstarted to do that and i still turned to\nthat when i i mean i i try to do it\nregularly but it's also one of those\nthings\nyou go through phases you know but for\nme yeah so writing is is always a huge\nhuge help um\ni mean stating the obvious i think you\nknow kirtan meditation music of course\nbut my other huge one which i think will\nand i share is\nis to connect with nature 100 just to\nwalk i mean i think i try and go for a\nwalk in nature every day and without\nfail it's like a bomb it's uplifting it\nbrings me back to myself it sparks ideas\nand creativity it's\nit's just like uh\nthe the road and the page they're my two\nfriends that really helped me so much\ni love that yeah i love that that's so\nawesome and and i guess that's what's\ninspired a lot of your work i know\ngenevieve whenever you're doing your bbc\npause for thought sessions you talk a\nlot about the environment and climate\nchange and yeah and that where where do\nyou see that intersection between like\nart and the environment or climate\nchange or\nexpression and that is there a synergy\nthere or or is it just something that\nyou feel is a different part of you\nwhere your care comes from\ni think it's absolutely intertwined i\nmean\nnature is the most beautiful\nart that we can witness and observe i'm\nso inspired by um\nby the natural world and my mom is a\nreally avid gardener and and lover of\nyou know wild plants and herbs and she\nsort of brought us up like that to\nobserve and learn about all the\nproperties of of plants and trees around\nus\nso i'm i'm kind of obsessed with plants\nand flowers and people could laugh at me\nbut it's like i'm always looking and\ninspired by the textures by the shapes\nby the um\nby the different aromas yeah everything\nand so\nour nature inspires me creatively\nimmensely and in terms of caring for\nnature i think like like a person the\nmore you know a person the more you care\nso the more we observe and connect and\nfeel a sense of relationship with nature\num that care it's like why wouldn't i\ncare i'm that it's it's a it's a\nbeautiful exchange\nabsolutely there's a mutual exchange of\nnourishment going on and i think also\nwith the particular um\ntype of creativity and art you know the\nthe questions that i'm asking or that\nwe're asking about service about\ndivinity these these kinds of uh these\nkinds of things they bring us also\ncloser to our deepest essence which i\nbelieve is is\nmeant to be in harmony with nature so\nthe more that you the more that you're\ncoming into that space again it just\nbecomes a very natural connection to\nfeel\nand so\nyeah i i'm kind of a nature addict\nand i and i i know like when i visited\nwillow in her home you know there's such\na beautiful view of the ocean and it's\nlike it's it's just a it's a part of you\nright yeah one's gotta be there and i\nhave to\ni would i think a significant decline in\nmy mental health would happen if i were\nto live in a city yeah um\nor\ni mean i do live in a city but if i were\nto live like amongst buildings yeah\nexactly yeah um like i need to wake up\nand see trees\njust one tree exactly at least at least\none at least one i i need it's i'm a\nnature addict what can i say just like\nyou yeah um\nand that's definitely one of the biggest\nhealing agents in my life 100\nyeah well we've been talking about this\nfor the past couple of days about\nhow you see this connection between\nspirituality and science and physics\nand spirituality\nand you've always been very much talking\nabout like science and physics and like\nbut then you're also really interested\nin\nspirituality tell us about how you\nstarted to see so early in your life the\nconnection and synergy between the two\nbecause i think so often they're talked\nabout so separately or 100 they're seen\nas like divisive or disconnected exactly\nyeah um i think one of the\nthe biggest\nthe biggest moments in my life that made\nme\nreally move towards this um\nmarriage of spirituality and science was\num you know i had been reading a lot of\nspiritual literature\ni had been reading a lot of osho a lot\nof i read this one book called oneness\nand that book changed my life forever\nand just the idea of vibration\nand that everything is vibration really\nhit me because i am a musician and music\nis like the biggest love of my life um\nand then learning about string theory\nwas\nah\njust opened my mind into such a place\nthat it was like\nthese two things are the same\nlike people think that they're separate\nand in some ways\nthey\nare but in the fundament they're just\ntwo sides of the same coin\num and so that inspired me to just dive\nreally deep into the physical world and\njust how things work and that's how i um\njust got into physics and started\nstudying physics um and you know i\nhaven't been\ni've been studying more of the spiritual\nlane recently it's hard it's it's hard i\nwill say to study them deeply at the\nsame time\num\nbut i\ni study them separately deeply and i go\nback and forth and then try to figure\nout how to bring them together in some\nway but in my life you know i'm\nconstantly i'm constantly relating um my\nspiritual experiences with you know all\nof the scientific things that i've read\nor you know just being in physics class\nand telling my physics teacher like oh\nyou should read this book and he's like\nokay\ni'm a physics teacher\ni'm not a metaphysics teacher um so i\njust i just want to continue to just get\nmore intelligent and and\nmore intelligent while also losing my\nego\ni think is where i'm trying to go which\nis kind of um\ncounter-intuitive yeah\nbut i think it is possible yeah\nabsolutely and\nintelligence in service exactly\nand so\nthat's\nthat's really just i have lots of goals\nbut that's one of them save the world\nexactly yeah i have lots of goals\num but they all give me joy and and\nreally just my curiosity for both makes\nmakes life just exciting you know those\nthose two things just make my life feel\nexciting to me yeah i actually think\nthat that that paradox is what makes it\nexciting yeah if your pursuit was only\nto become intelligent you'd get bored\nexactly and if your pursuit was only to\nremove ego it wouldn't be as exciting\nquite tough and so actually both of them\ntogether\nis a beautiful path and and and often\nthe path that can only be walked when\nyou do both\npaths to reach to really get it right i\nlove that\nthat's also why i really admire you jay\nbecause you\nwhile also having been a monk for five\nyears three three years you\nare also one of the most intelligent\npeople i know\num and that's so inspiring\nto see that you can do both and that\nboth can be done um it just inspires me\nto do it it just inspires me to try to\nactually\ntry to actually put that into my own\nlife\num and i'm just so happy that\nyou're you're\nin my life so that i can i can see you\ngrow and and constantly learn from you\nand that's really amazing to me oh\nyou're the sweetest i'm like getting all\nemotional now but now we're just gonna\nbe crying\nno i love that i really appreciate it\nno i was like willow's 40 year old\ngrandma inside her talking i know i'm\nproud\ni know\ni love it\nno i really appreciate that from you\nit's you know it's i think we both have\na lot more in common than we know too\ntotally we're kind of discovering it\nrecently\nyes i'm just like oh yeah i can learn a\nlot and that's why yeah i think what we\nall were talking about yesterday is and\ni think why we all like being around\neach other is\nand and why who everyone is listening or\nwatching i'm hoping that this is\nencouraging you to\nconnect with like-hearted people\nconnect with\nand collaborate with people that you're\nclose to because when you can be\nyourself and you don't have to apologize\nby asking for permission to say\nsomething or expressing who you are and\nyou welcome them\nif you want even more videos just like\nthis one make sure you subscribe and\nclick on the boxes over here if you\nlisten to most conversations it's\nobvious the person is not thinking or\nthey would never say what they're saying\nor if you stand back and observe their\nbehavior they would never do what they\nwere doing if they were thinking"
