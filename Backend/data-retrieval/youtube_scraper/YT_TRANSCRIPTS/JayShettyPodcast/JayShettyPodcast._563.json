we love you lauren thank you so much\nfor doing the on purpose podcast and it\nis so great to have you on the show\nthanks for being here lauren oh thank\nyou jay man the introduction was like a\nplus plus you made me excited about\nmyself i was like i guess i've been\nworking for a while\nyou've you know you've done so much in\nyour career\nand i always feel blessed when i get to\nsee people on screen and off screen\nbecause i think\nwe're all humans that have real lives\nand real experiences but\ni mean everything in that intro was true\nso congratulations to you i mean you\nknow it's it's all your hard work and\nall your achievements i i hope we get a\nspecial appearance from crossover cam\ntoday in the shot uh you know one can\nonly hope\nuh but lauren i want to start with just\ndiving straight in\nyou know you have experienced so much in\nyour career so many amazing\nlife-changing moments but at the same\ntime in your personal life you've been\ngiven so many surprises and pivots and\nand changes and challenges and i want to\nhear about your journey as to how you\nfound\ngrace spiritual connection\nand have you been guided by that through\nsome of the most difficult things that\nanyone in the world would ever have to\nexperience you know my spiritual journey\nit had so many transformations\nso i had a very um\ntraumatic childhood you could say with\njust a lot of abuse and\nyou know neglect and um\nnot at the hands of my mother though let\nme clear that up and so i was very very\nconnected to god at a really early age i\njust remember hearing god very very very\nclear\nand then you know\nas i grew up i lost a bit of my\nconnection to god\nand then re got reintroduced to god in\nanother way in my early adulthood and\nthen\nreally\nwhen knit passed\ni felt like that was when i had to\nreally really\nget to know god\npersonally not in theory not an idea not\nyou know only when things are good to\npray and devote\nit made me feel like i wanted to really\nunderstand our purpose here on earth why\nwe were here what are we to do here i\ndidn't want to live a life in vain\ni wanted to be on purpose\nand i i so it just it was this like this\nthirst for the truth i think when\ntragedy happens you just\nyou can either just\nsurvive or survive and thrive and i\nreally made the choice to survive and\nthrive and i feel like i can only do\nthat through the grace of god\nand just being a servant of god\nthat's beautiful lauren thank you for\nsharing that let's let's go back to that\nearly childhood that you were mentioning\nwhat was like a pivotal moment in your\nchildhood that you believe has defined\nwho you are and how you show up\nwhat was a moment that happened in those\nearly years that you think taught you\nsomething so powerful that shaped who\nyou are today well you know i think when\nyou you know my parents were really\nyoung and they they really tried the\nbest\nyou know with what they had and just the\ntools they had in their toolbox\nand so i learned um very early about\nbetrayal\nand\nhow\nbeing alone because i was the only child\nand there was a lot of violence around\nme and towards me\nhow i could only depend on god and i\nlearned that very early on that the\nhumans and the adults in my life might\nnot have been the best protectors\nbut that i was okay because i had faith\nin god and that depending on god and\nleaning on god and trusting that i would\nbe okay really carried me through\nmy young\nchildhood my adulthood\nand just you know\nclearly no one's perfect and our parents\nare human i think that was a really hard\nlesson for me to learn that my parents\nwere just humans i i think you've raised\nsuch an interesting point there because\nwhen i think about what you're saying\ni think it's so natural as a young\nperson\nto look for role models to look for\nprotectors to look for shelter\nto look for\nanother human\nto be under their wing\nand when you're young and that breaks\nyou kind of keep looking sometimes in\nthe wrong places too and i know i did\nthat in my own life where\nwhen i couldn't find it from what seemed\nlike the natural traditional places of\nshelter i started to find it in\nthe wrong areas did you ever feel that\nyou went down that path when you were\nyounger where you were taking shelter of\nthings that now you wouldn't want your\nkids to do but you kind of had no choice\nbefore you got to that god place\nit's almost like before that tell us a\nbit about that journey of like looking\nfor\nshelter\nin humans i looked at everything outside\nof there was also a moment where i just\nyou know my faith dwindled because life\nhappened and i was like well why would\nthis happen clearly there is no\npower to be life is just crumbling\naround me i was just looking outside of\nmyself for validation\ni didn't have a really good strong sense\nof self-worth and so you know kids i\nthink children internalize everything\nwhen they're really young and then\naround adolescent people always think\nadolescents are so\ntroubled and but that's when you start\nto express everything you've\ninternalized\nthat age and so around like 14 15 i\nstarted to express everything i had\ninternalized and you know i started to\ndrink and\nsmoke and\nskip school or not go to school you know\ncompletely not go to school at all and i\ngot kicked out of high school\nand i went from like an honors student\nwhich is like you know\nvery\nmagnet and all all these ap classes to\nnever going back to school because i was\nso my anger was starting to come out\nfrom everything i had went through and\nyeah\nand then i had a dream\naround like 19 of just years of acting\nout\nthat i died and i was like how this is\nso crazy how\nlike no i'm not sick no one knows i'm\nlike walking out of my mom's house and\nthis figure was there and the figure was\nlike\nyou know i kind of explained to me that\ni was leaving earth it was such an eerie\ndream and i was like where's jesus and\nthe figure was like he's not here for\nyou and i woke up immediately it was\nsunday morning and i literally drove\nmyself to church and my life changed\nafter that wow i mean that those kind of\ndreams do you have dreams like that\noften or was that like a one-off and was\nthat like a at that time had you had\nother dreams around that time that were\ndifferent to that no i used to have like\nvery dreams that were kind of like\npremonitions when i was younger\ni you know of like areas and places that\ni would eventually see when i was older\num so but nothing like that that was\nvery specific i think to my need of\ntransformation\ni really like the theme lauren that\nyou've kind of touched on in your own\nlife and in your past because i think\nyou're spot on that when we're young and\neven when we get older we're constantly\nlooking for a protector and shelter\nand we almost go from like will you be\nmy protector and then that person lets\nus down and then we go to this person\nand say well no you be my protector and\nthen they let us down and we keep doing\nthat the fact that you've raised that is\nreally powerful because i think\nsometimes we don't even know we're doing\nthat because you're not saying it in\nthose words you're not saying be my\nprotector but inside in your heart\nthat's kind of what you're looking for\ntell us about those lessons you learned\nwhen you went down the wrong paths and\nchose some of the wrong shelters i think\nwhat i\nreally what i've learned\nfrom being younger and looking outside\nof myself for protection and safety and\ncomfort\nwas that the ultimate comfort and\nprotection comes from a higher power it\ncame from god for me and i was telling\nyou just being a single mother and a\nsingle woman now\nand you know yes i have family and i\nhave friends that are\nprotectors but ultimately my protection\nis divine and it comes from god and\nreally trusting that now and i didn't\ntrust it before and i think when you've\ngone through tragedy or trauma in any\npart of life\nit really makes you\nyou know they don't talk about how it\nreally it challenges your relationship\nwith god and it am i really being\nprotected this for something really\nhorrible has happened am i really safe\nsomething horrible has happened\nand\nyou know i'm learning that even now that\ni am protected and that it is okay to\nlean into that to not have to always be\naround people or you know\nnot always feeling like i'm not\nprotected if i'm alone that i am totally\nentrust with god\nthat's a lesson i'm still learning today\nthat i'm trying to just cultivate even\nmore yeah it's interesting isn't it how\nwe've created this\nanimosity with being alone\nlike we think of being alone or lonely\nas such a negative thing\nand it's almost been ingrained in our\nlife since we were young where it's like\nif you were the kid at school who didn't\nhave lots of friends you were the loner\nand if you got invited to a wedding and\nyou didn't have a plus one it was like\noh what's wrong with you and it's like\nwe've always been told that you need a\nbetter half or someone to complete you\nlike the language has always been being\nalone is a weakness and that being alone\nmeans you've been abandoned it's almost\nlike we think being alone means\nabandonment but\nthat's not true you can be happy alone\nand have great relationships and friends\nbut know where your shelter is\ni want to hear about\nhow long it takes you and what you have\nto go through to gain that trust that\nthere's something beyond because\nnow when you're looking back\nit obviously makes sense but if you if\nyou remember being in that position\nthe last thing you want to do is trust\nthat there's something greater or deeper\nor more powerful because\nyou're like well i i don't even have\nthat trust in myself you know and we\nkeep transferring our trust to humans\nand so i just want to hear about some of\nthe pain that comes with that or some of\nthe challenges that come with that or\nor some of that journey before you were\nable to be when i see you now and\nobviously we know each other and i see\nyou be so confident in that space i kind\nof want to hear where that confidence\ncame from you know for me personally i\nthink it's all it's really based on the\nindividual in someone's individual\njourney for me personally it was because\ni didn't have a choice\nthere was no other option\nthat was taken away from me where i was\nin a house\ni wasn't alone i was in a relationship\nyou know i was protected and covered and\nthen that was tragically taken away with\nthe passing\nyou know\nof my son's father\nthat i was forced into\ni am alone now\nand who do you trust as far as yourself\ngod what's that relationship like when\nyou don't have anything else to lean on\nand stand on all you have\nis what you came here with it's you and\nthe divine\nand so i was kind of pushed into\ncommunication with god i had to start\nreally talking to god real\nnot just reading the books and you know\ni always say like applying it and and\nreading it are two different things you\ncan read all the books everywhere\nyou can speak recite what you read in\nthe book but once you apply what you\nread that's a different ballgame and so\ni had to learn application\nyeah that's such a such a great point\nfrom communication and application i\nthink that's\nthat's so powerful let's\ni've loved watching you\nuh be a mom i've only ever known you in\nthis this phase of your life like i i\ndidn't know i haven't known you uh\nbefore\nand you have two incredible sons who are\njust so fun to be with uh cam is like\nthe ultimate gentleman and you know this\nthis very like almost regal\nperson is just like so well spoken so\ngentle so smart and intellectual as well\nuh and then you have cross who's just\nlike the cutest little being in the\nworld and just has so much like\nspontaneous energy has your humor you\nknow that that kind of vibe\nand and i see how much they love you and\nhow much you love them and and that\nconnection it's so beautiful\nlauren i'm asking you this probably for\nthe first time i've never asked you this\nbefore because\ni i believe it's not an easy question to\nanswer but how does it feel to have a\nplan for life and have a picture of what\nlife looks like\nand then have that picture be torn like\nwhat does that actually feel like\nbecause i think\nthat's something that\nwe underestimate because not everyone\ngoes through that fully but\nthe extent to which you've been through\nthat we may all get little pieces of\nthat and so i feel your experience can\nbe a real blessing for everyone and i\nknow you can share it with that\nheart so i'd love to ask you that\nquestion now it is the ultimate\nlesson in\ncontrol\nnot having control letting go it's\nreally\nwhen you have this plan for your life as\nyou should we should manifest we should\nset goals\nyou should right you have intentions\nand\nif the when if\nor when that gets derailed and you have\nplan b now to go off that you didn't\nplan on\nit is the ultimate\ntest of surrender\nletting it go letting god now move in\nyour life\nyou know i think for me it was i had\nthis idea i had to we had the kids we\nhad a family\nand the head of the household is not\nhere anymore\ndoes that mean i have no purpose here\nanymore no\ni still have a purpose i still have a\nmission\nand now i have to tap into myself you\nknow\ni had to surrender my idea\nof what i thought my life should be\nand give\ngod and give my children the opportunity\nfor a happy life give god my life so\nthat now my life is what the divine\nwants for me and so i flow with the\nriver i'm not holding on to the rocks\ni'm not\ngrasping onto things that you know you\nhave to let go of\nit is\nliterally the i'm going to say again the\nultimate test of surrendering you have\nto surrender\nbecause at the end of the day as much\ncontrol as we think we have we do not\nand it's actually very powerful to\nsurrender we think that it's a weakness\nbut it's so much power in letting go and\nflowing with the river because life is\ngoing to do what it's going to do and we\nare all going to get chin checked by\nlife one way or another so i might as\nwell focus on my enlightenment and roll\nwith the river and not fight with the\nrocks\nwow\nlauren that was i mean you know hearing\nthat from you\ni i hope that people are going to replay\nthat part themselves again and again and\nagain because\neverything you just said and the fact\nthat you're saying it\nin what you've experienced\nthat's what gives it so much power right\nthese are not just words and these are\nnot just ideas it's not just a concept\nit's like you're actually having to\napply this in your daily life\ntell us about lauren what is it that we\ndidn't know about nipsey and you and and\nthe connection you had what is it that\nwe didn't see that we didn't know that\nthat people may not be aware of that you\nshared that you learned from each other\nthat you grew from each other what were\nthe things you taught him and he taught\nyou that\nthat\nmade this\nso powerful and you know made this\nincredible unit that has continued to\npropel you to greater heights\nyou know i always say that like\nwe were very avid readers and so when we\nmoved in together and put our books\ntogether you can really see whose books\nwere whose so\nlike he was very um\na very he was an intellectual\nand um i always say he was like a\nspiritual intellectual and i was a\nspiritual emotional person so all my\nbooks were like on heart and you know\nand so\nto me it really represented masculine\nand feminine energy\ni think something that people don't know\nis that we were always talking about how\nwe could have a better relationship with\ngod individually\nand our purpose\nand our missions in life and you know\nwho\nhow we just wanted to be\non purpose\nas individuals and how we just helped\neach other on our own individual\nmissions\nand that our relationship was actually\nmore spiritual than it was anything\nand that we bonded on our\nyou know quest for the truth\nthat's i mean what i love about hearing\nthat is that\nanyone who is in a relationship right\nnow or wants to be in a relationship\nwho's listening to us\nthat feels like such a great north star\nlike that feels like such a beautiful\npoint to connect and\nit sounds so normal for you because\nthat's what you both were like you just\ndescribed but that's not very normal as\nwe both know like that's not what\nrelationships are based on like that's\nnot\nwhy we come together it's not what we\nthink about it's not really what we put\nin the center but that center feels so\nstrong sorry were you about to say\nsomething lauren i didn't i didn't want\nto cut you off we started and we weren't\nperfect and we definitely had our you\nknow it was a lot of human moments but i\nthink in relationship it's really\nimportant in the beginning if you set an\nintention\nwhat is what is our union how is our\nunion going to\nparticipate\nwith everyone else how are we going to\ncontribute how does our union contribute\nto people outside of us not just us\nyou know not just between you know oh\nyou love me you give me pleasure it has\nto be deeper than that or it kind of\nfades away\nso i think we're very intentional on\nlike\nhow\nus together how does that contribute to\nour community yeah and i think that\ncommunity part is also again such a\npowerful point that it doesn't just stop\nat your quest for the truth it's what\nyou both do in service to your community\nand that's a space that you're you\ncontinue to be active in your boat you\nwere both active in like that's such a\nbig priority for you\nand\ni i think that that's another great\nrelationship connection that you've\nspoken about there there is like if your\nrelationship is based around the quest\nfor the truth not just pleasure but then\nyour relationship is based around\ncommunity service and giving back\nthese are the things that really bring\nyou close to someone\nthat you that you deeply love and you\nshare together you you spoke a bit about\nthe masculine and feminine energy there\nand i loved how you described yourself\nas the spiritual emotional and him as\nthe spiritual intellectual that's that's\na really cool way of looking at it when\nwhen you tell us a bit about what you've\nlearned about the masculine and feminine\nenergy that has helped you that you\nthink our listeners may\nfind an introduction if they're not as\naware of\nthose ideas what if some of the things\nthat you've taken away that you think\nhave really helped you you know just\nbeing aware that we are all\nuh masculine and feminine energy you\nknow you think\nit's just one way or the other but that\nwe have we're all intertwined and we\nhave that\nin us i sometimes operate out of my\nmasculine more than my feminine you know\nespecially um\njust\ni think i do more than anything\nand and and starting to open myself up\nto my feminine energy more and more\num i've learned that i think that was my\nthat's my biggest takeaway really from\nthat is that it is all in all of us\nit's not one or the other\nand that it is so okay to nurture both\nsides at the same time\nor some or one side you might nurture\nmore than the other and that's okay i\njust you know\nit's like the best of both worlds yeah\nno i agree with that and i knowing which\none to use when\nand knowing which one to nourish is such\nan important decision and\nwhereas if you just base it on gender\nand you say well i'm only feminine or\nmasculine whatever it may be\nyou almost miss out on recognizing that\nthere are powers in both\nthat are accessible to all of us all the\ntime i i know for a fact i i remember\nmeeting someone a few years ago\nand i don't know if i ever told you this\nbut i met someone a few years ago\nand i don't really connect with him that\nmuch anymore either but he said to me he\nsaid he goes jay you are\nyou are like completely balanced in your\nmasculine and feminine and i was like i\ndid when i first heard that it was a\nwhile ago i was like i don't know\nwhether to take that as a compliment or\nas a diss and so but\nyeah you know i i learned that\nafterwards you know it's like my\nmasculine ego got in the way of like\nwhat are you trying to say\nand his creativity and intuition\nand as spiritual beings we just you know\nyeah you want to be tapped into that\nintuition and that create i'm glad you\nraised that actually that you know\nfeminine energy of often we don't\nunderstand the depth of it but\ncreativity intuition\nconnection\nsynergy like all of this comes from that\nand so that's a really great reminder i\nheard you learn in an interview you\nmentioned\nthat you almost made a decision to not\ngo back to acting anymore\nand and i wanted to know more about that\nbecause obviously you have gone back and\nyou have moved forward\nbut there was a point where obviously\nthat that required an act of bravery can\nyou tell us what was it that was\nstopping you and then what helped you\nmove back in what was stopping me was\nthat you know life changed\nand so my perspective on life changed\nand you know i\nmy field the audition process and the\nrejection and the the\npolitics of\nyou know what came with what i do\ndid not\nalign with\nwhat i was seeking anymore i didn't want\nto have to politic\ni didn't want to have to um you know do\nthings i felt more in alignment with my\ntruth and i just wanted to be myself\nfully if i could participate in a\nproject holy i would do it but if i\ncould not i didn't want to be fake and\nnot give\nof myself in a real way\nand so i was like you know i don't\nreally want to\nrun that race anymore and so\na project of without remorse came\nand i was like uh i'm not sure i i don't\nwant to\ndo\nthis little you know\nwhat felt like a hamster will for me\ni didn't like the idea of competition\nand going against i didn't like that and\nso i was like i don't know if i want to\ndo that anymore and so michael was like\nlook just read the script and so i read\nthe script and what drew me to was that\ni could participate authentically like i\ncan genuinely\num play this role because i really\nresonated with the fact that she passes\nand he has all these visions of her\nand that she's still\ncommunicating with him\njust not physically but spiritually and\nthat's exactly where i you know where i\nthought i was at the time\nand so it was just perfect it was in\nalignment with a story i wanted to tell\ni could really give my truth to this\nand it didn't have that um\nit didn't have a negative energy on it\nit felt\nit felt like it felt i don't want to say\neasy because it wasn't easy but it felt\nlike it was just pretty much in\nalignment\nyou know\nit flowed\nand so and not that i'm expecting\neverything to be easy\nbut\ni didn't want that\na certain energy on it and this had a\nreally good energy on it and i trusted\nit and went back\nyeah and i i really felt that when me\nand raleigh watched the movie together\nwe really felt that too that you know\nlooking at it from that perspective of\nof knowing you and speaking to you about\nit and then watching the movie and just\nbeing like wow like\nyou know how how must have that been for\nlauren to play that role\nbut but then to hear you say what you're\nsaying to me now i'm just like wow like\nthat\nthat's therapeutic it's healing it's\nit's powerful because you're you're\ntransferring that pain into purpose\nright you're like bringing it through\nand you're letting it flow and that\nthat's so powerful that you're able to\ntransform your pain in this way and and\nthat feels like a\nmassively worthy reason to go back to\nanything\nand how you're selecting it and i love\nwhat you said there i think you know i\njust i like pointing out things that\nsometimes we miss you said i'm not\nexpecting it to be easy\nbut i want it to be an alignment and i\nthink that is such a powerful lesson for\nall of us that if we're looking for ease\nchances are\nwe don't want to do anything because\nnothing's easy\nyeah but it's like that alignment uh and\nyou've devoted time\nin helping other people who've lost\ntheir loved ones through gun violence uh\ncan you walk us through how this has\nbeen helping you in your healing journey\nand why it's important for people to\nhelp even when we feel like we've lost\nbecause i think what often happen is\nwhen we feel like we've gone through\nsomething\nwe most often don't feel like we're in a\nposition to help but when you've\nactually gone and done that can you tell\nus how that\nhas actually helped healing or support\nor what have you learned from that you\nknow i think personally that service is\nour purpose\num and that we do it in different ways\ni\ni went to new york and i um worked with\nan organization called life camp where\nthey helped um you know victims of gun\nviolence and they try to stop gun\nviolence and um a woman by the name of\nerica who was amazing runs this\norganization\nit made it also i saw it also made me\nnot feel so alone\nand that how\nclose we are as humans and how connected\nwe are and we feel like our individual\nstories are the things that\nmake us so separate but it's actually a\nthing that really connects us and that\nas i was talking to these young women\nand these single mothers that were\nyounger than me i got so much strength\nfrom them\nbecause so much we some so many times we\nthink what we go through is just us and\nhow did this happen to me and it's not\nthe way to think like that it's like\nwho am i why not me\nwhy is this not happening to me it's\nhappening all around the world\nhow can i be of service\nhow can my story help someone else\nthrough their story so many times i read\na book or listen to someone's testimony\nand they have no idea\nhow encouraging that is for me at that\ntime and so i just want my i don't want\nto ha i don't want to have my pain in\nvain i would like to give my pain some\npurpose and transmute the pain into\npurpose and if i could help or encourage\nor motivate or\npull through i will sign up for that\nevery day all the time\nthat's beautiful i'm so glad you shared\nthat because\nagain it just comes back to the same\nthing that we don't want people\ni i think it's those times when you feel\nyou have nothing to give is when by\ngiving you have so much to gain right\nit's like when you feel you have nothing\nto give but\nbut in that moment when you choose to\ngive when you actually feel like you\nhave nothing to give you get so much\nback from it and\nand i feel like if you're supposed to\ngive right isn't that when\nisn't that when you're supposed to give\nwhen you feel like you know\nwhen you're really depressed when you're\nreally\nthey say when you're really down don't\ngo do something for someone else step\noutside of yourself and go do something\nfor someone else yeah yeah absolutely\nand i think if if we can all find daily\nweekly monthly ways of doing that by\nworking with organizations that are\nimportant to us and i i think this is\none of the things that i've noticed too\nas well when we look around in the world\nthere's so much pain\nand there's so much stress and pressure\nand it's overwhelming but if you just go\nand do one tiny act of service in your\nlocal area in your local community you\ndon't have to go and change the world\nyou don't have to go and like raise lots\nof money or do this like big thing you\ncan do this really small thing every\nweek\nand not only is that going to improve\nthe world of course it's improving the\nworld it's going to change someone's\nlife\nit's going to change yours too and i\nthink\nwe underestimate\nwhat it feels like to change one\nperson's life\nand and i always think about like if you\nhad the option of\nwhen we're like oh but that only helps\nthree people\nif you think about those three people\nand their life experience i'm sure you\nwould a thousand percent choose to\nchange their experience and i think we\nwe've got lost this we've got lost in\nthis world now of like numbers and\nmillions of dollars and big change and\nwe we forget that the community is\nchanged like that is the world does that\nmake sense it's right\nit's hope it's right where you step\nyou know i don't think it's the small\nthings that\npeople up to a big thing and the big\nthing is service\nyou know like it's integrity like are\nyou gonna do this when no one is\nwatching absolutely you know am i gonna\nmake it's also like i'm very intentional\non my day so if i know i'm gonna be\nworking\naround a lot of people\nmy intention is that you know\ni represent god\nthat i don't give someone i don't put my\nstuff on someone else that i bring good\nenergy to a set\nthat you know if someone's having a hard\nday i don't have to\ntry to make them better but i can just\nrepresent you know some goodness you\nknow and some truth and so i think it's\nimportant also to set intentions when\nyou're around a lot of people\ni remember you telling me that when\nyou're on set you like choose your own\nplaylist to make sure the energy is\nright and the vibes right and like you\nknow i think that\ni get on that in that trailer and i play\nmy little jazz or my self-care\nplaylist\nmy incense i sage i pray i just put\nmyself in a space because i don't want\nto be influenced by my environment i\nwant the environment to be influenced by\nme\nabsolutely well said well said lauren i\nwant to hear about we spoke about this\nearlier briefly but i want to dive into\nit being a mother you know and we spoke\nabout cam and cross who\nyou know i've enjoyed spending the time\nthat i have with them\nuh tell us about what you've been trying\nto share with them what lessons what\nguidance you've been trying to pass on\nto them\nbut also what have you learned from both\nof them in your own life too like what\nhave you taken from them where where\nhave they taught you because i know they\nhave\ni think i've learned from them more than\nthey'll ever be able to learn from me\nthey're really um\nthey're really resilient and\nlike uncon they love me\nregardless of what i see in myself\nsometimes or when i'm down you know\ncameron's\nheart\nhas a really big heart and when i was\nhis age i closed my heart up because\nthere was a lot of trauma around me and\ni didn't i used to think that\nvulnerability was weakness\nand i realized how easy it is for him to\nbe vulnerable and how easy it is for him\nto share his heart and his feelings and\nhow strong and brave that is\nand so a lot of times\ni'll be in a situation i will even say\nlike what would cam do because his\nintention is so pure\nand\nheartfelt and his compassion you know\num\nand cross is very and i learned from him\nhis freedom\nof being himself\ntotal freedom\nhe is fearless\nhe's like i got this\nif i don't get got it right now i'm\ngonna get it\num you know i didn't have siblings\ngrowing up so watching\nsiblings\nthat love is like uh like i hope if i\never come back that i get to have a\nsibling that i grew up in the house with\nbecause it's\nbeautiful it's like they're a part of\neach other in a way\nand\ni\npersonally like to instill in my kids\nintegrity\nhonor\nhonesty\nyou know you get in big trouble for\nlying in this household\num\nan acceptance of yourself fully\nyou know i've been really big on like\nyou know cam had a test today he was\nreally nervous about\nand i'm like look\nif you don't ace the test you don't ace\nthe test\ndid you try your best yes did we study\nyes\nyou don't have to ac you have to show up\nand show out that's it the the result of\nthat it's in the universe and sometimes\nwe don't get the result of our\nyou know actions right away so just make\nsure you put your best foot forward\nand just i teach them a lot about god\nand how there's a karma checkbook so\njust make sure you're always putting\ngood pennies in your karma bank i'm\nalways like you there's always an\nopportunity to have good karma so make\nsure you pay attention to all your\nopportunities around i love i love what\nyou mentioned there one thing around the\nidea of you don't always get the reward\nfor the hard work and that activity in\nthat moment and i think that is such a\npowerful\nthing to teach a young person because\nwe always think like for example i\nstudied for this test but i didn't get\nthe results so that study was useless\nand we don't realize that that study may\nbe really powerful like five ten years\ndown the line when you remember that one\npiece of insight and it actually gets a\nwin\nand and that is such a\npowerful powerful thing to teach someone\nthat the immediate result\nis not how powerful that\ninput was like the immediate result is\nnot how powerful your effort was in that\nsituation you're going to get to see\nthat for many many years that you said\nit much better than me no that's what i\nwas\nno i told i'm just i'm just listening\ni'm just trying to listen to you really\nattentively because i feel like there's\nso many things that you've worked on and\nyou've practiced that have become so\nnormal for you\nand when i'm listening to you i'm like\nwow that's actually really profound like\nthat's a really powerful point and the\nfact that you're thinking about teaching\nthat to your kids\nlike it's you're not just saying oh it\ndoesn't matter if you don't ace the test\nwhat you're actually saying is it\ndoesn't matter if you it's the test\nbecause what you learned is going to\nhelp you at some point and i want you to\nsee that i want you to recognize that\nyou studied and that's going to support\nyou in more ways than this test this\ntest\nthis test is not the proof that you\nstudied\nand no yeah and\nis the that's it yeah yeah that's really\nbeautiful i i love hearing that and uh\ntell tell us about as you continue to\nmove on now what are the things lauren\nnow at this stage in your life\nyou know you've done so much service\nyou've worked for the community you're\nembedded you're supporting others people\nare supporting you what are the things\nthat excite you now like where is it\nwhere are you now what what brings joy\nto lauren now\nuh i really like creating\ncontent\nthat i feel\nis inspirational or motivation\nmotivation\nthat really excites me i've been working\non a couple\nlines with puma with clothes and just\nintention behind that like i don't want\nto just put out the clothes what is it\nwhat are the clothes saying how are the\nclothes going to make someone feel\nwhat intention are they putting behind\ntheir clothes\nand\nyou know\nhonestly\nreally simple things like sundays\ni love doing you know devotional service\non sundays and learning\nmore about god and applying\nthat but also just like chilling\nwatching tv with my kids\nyou know like i used to think it was\nthese massive things that brought me joy\nand so i would always seek those really\nbig things\nand really it's like a really\ncomfortable room with the kids and\nthey're listening to them laugh or\nlisten to them play together and you\nknow\nclean socks and fresh sheets those\nthings bring me\nbig joy and you know hanging with\nfriends and\nlistening to music just those things and\ncreating\nthings that come from my heart\ndefinitely yeah big shout out to your\ni say puma back in england so but i know\nit's puma out here we say puma uh but\nreally yeah we yeah every time i say\npuma i just feel so it just i'm like wow\nlike that's so it's so for my mind it's\ncrazy but yeah we call it puma back in\nengland but puma yeah the forever\nstronger line\nuh me and riley's are rather big fans\nand it's uh it's always nice to wear\nsomething that means something and that\nrepresents something for you and\nand yeah i i love that you're bringing\nthat into fashion and places like that\nto have that meaningfulness and that\npresence and that power\nand you know one thing i remember we\nspoke about which i really appreciate\nfrom you and you even mentioned it today\nwhere you're like i wanted to let go of\nthat competition and the industry and\nthat comparison\nwalk us through how you've worked\nthrough that because\nthis isn't something that only you\nexperience it's actually what's been\ncreated by most industries where people\nare put against each other\npeople are made to compete for things\nyou're made to believe there's only one\nspot there's only one thing and if you\nget it then you're losing and you're\nwinning how have you worked through that\npersonally how have you been trying to\napply the wisdom around that area of\nyour life around comparison and\ncompetition that i think we all struggle\nwith yeah you know i i remember hearing\nsomething reverend michael\nsaid about\nbeing in the spirit of celebration so\nwhen something really good happens to\nsomeone else\ncelebrate it\nbecause when you're in that spirit of\ncelebration you're just giving out\num\nmessages to the universe that you like\nto celebrate so then the universe\ngives you things to celebrate\nso i celebrate\neveryone's wins you know i've never i've\nnever really been an envious\ni don't i never really carry that energy\neven\nyoung so that's why it always feels\nfunny when it's around me\nso like i celebrate\neveryone's wins because i know that that\nwould that that is my that's mine too\nit's just the energy of celebration and\num genuinely knowing that there's enough\nto go around that we live in an abundant\nuniverse so\njust because someone is eating doesn't\nmean that i don't have food on the way\ndoesn't mean i can't eat either it's\njust that there's an abundance of it all\nso i just celebrate everyone's you know\nwins\nand you know\ncongratulate and send really good energy\nout to especially you know women and\nblack women like myself that are doing\nthis is not easy\ni just am like\ni love women so i'm like a woman like i\nlove women winning\ni just sit in the spirit of\nabundance and celebration\nyeah i think when we start realizing\nthat actually when people in our space\nwin the space wins\nand so it's not like you know it's when\nyou make it about one versus one it can\nfeel like a loss but when you see it as\na community an industry a a space within\nan industry when that's winning that\nmeans everyone's winning i always think\nabout it like you know if you look at it\nthrough house prices it's like if\nsomeone on your street sells their house\nfor a lot of money everyone's prices\njust went up like everyone on that\nstreet just benefited but you can look\nat that and be like oh but they just\nmade loads of money and so no one's\ngonna buy my house but it's like\nactually that's not true the whole value\nof the whole street just increased right\nin that competition you know mind frame\nyou're just blocking\nall the beautiful things god has for you\nyou know if i'm you know you just that's\nwhy you're supposed to celebrate\npeople when they succeeded at something\nor accomplished something because you\njust open your world for\nmore to celebrate\nso i'm not blocking my blessings i like\nall my blessings so\ni love everyone's blessings absolutely i\nlove that lauren we end every on-purpose\nepisode with the final five so these\nquestions have to be answered with one\nword or one sentence maximum so you can\nhave one sentence let's do uh lauren\nlondon these are your final five\nquestion number one what is the best\nadvice you've ever received\nwhat you give\nout to the world you keep oh i like that\ni like that that's good we've never had\nthat i like that that's good advice uh\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nreceived or the worst thing anyone's\never said to you\nsomeone making someone like your\npossession like you have to keep them or\ndon't do this or you're going to lose\nthem that's really bad advice yes good\ngood good advice on the bad advice all\nright question number three\nuh what how would you define your\ncurrent purpose in life transmuting pain\ninto\npurpose\nbeautiful i love that uh question number\nfour what is something that you used to\nvalue that you don't value anymore\nclothes\ni love that i love that that's such a\ngreat answer i love it i don't really\nneed designers\nclothes and stuff love appreciate them\nbut\ni don't\nknow\nall right fifth and final question if\nyou could make one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\ni feel like there will be stricter\npunishment and longer\nuh harsher punishment on child abusers\nwow hopefully to hopefully limit people\nfrom doing it yeah and the punishment of\npeople that harm children\nwould be\nyou know i know it's not so spiritual of\nme but it'd be harsh harsh huh\nyeah thank you lauren lauren is there\nanything that i haven't asked you
