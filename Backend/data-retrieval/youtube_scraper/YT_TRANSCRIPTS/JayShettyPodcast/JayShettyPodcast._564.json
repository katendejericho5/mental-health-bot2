    "transcript": "you think of emotion you think you\neither have to suppress it or you have\nto embrace it and i think there's a way\nin which you\ncan experience it internally but you\ndon't have to express it externally you\nthink through it we process it and then\nwe insane and do what we intend to do\nnot what we are doing in terms of a\nreaction and i think like if you control\nyour emotions you're very powerful if\nyou're controlled by your emotions\nyou're\nnot as powerful\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you who come back every week to\nlisten\nlearn and grow now you know that i'm\nalways out to find interesting people\nfascinating stories people who you may\nor may not know but have made really\ninteresting powerful decisions that we\ncan all learn from and today's guest is\na friend of mine someone that i bumped\ninto very recently and we just connected\ninstantly but at the same time he's had\nyears of experience as an entrepreneur\ni'm speaking about none other than adam\ngoldstein who's the co-founder of\nla-based athletic propulsion labs or apl\nas they're known and he and his twin\nbrother ryan who were former sport\ncollegiate athletes played both\nbasketball and football\nat the university of southern california\nand they envisioned creating a company\nthat would provide revolutionary\nproducts symbolizing the ultimate\nintersection and this is what i love of\nluxury and performance today adam and\nryan are recognized as accomplished\ninventors with numerous u.s and foreign\npatents including apl's revolutionary\nload and launch technology and recently\nthey were named two of the hundred most\nintriguing entrepreneurs of 2020 by\ngoldman sachs please welcome to the show\nmy friend an amazing entrepreneur adam\ngoldstein adam thank you for being here\nman jay thanks for having me i'm i'm\nsuper excited i've been a long time\nlistener obviously we're friends but\nit's funny because i like\nyour podcast is one of the only ones\nthat i i really listen to and where um i\nthink like where i actively listen\nbecause i think there's a difference\nbetween passively listening to something\nactively listening and it's so funny\nthat so many of the people\nbig and smaller or like not smaller but\nlike famous and just more specialized in\ntheir avenue and people that have been\nimportant to my to my personal journey\nso like when i listened i listened to\nthe robert green one\nand the the first book\nis in my i'd say like adult life that i\never\nput like real intention into reading was\n48 laws of power and i read it\nin a moment like i think like one of the\nkey things in my personal story is that\nlike i have gotten lucky at key specific\nmoments of my life through a decision\nthat i made and i was sick with\npneumonia and i read robert greene's 48\nlaws of power and there wouldn't have\nbeen another\nmoment where i would have been again at\nhome and had the ability to dive into\nsomething in such a deep level but and i\nthink the way he talks about power in\nlike just in the past as people think of\nit as a negative thing but there's posit\nthere's definite positives if you use it\nto not only help yourself but help\nothers and so\nthat was what my takeaway was and it was\nagain this was years ago but that was\nwhat my takeaway was and so i just\nstarted being more active more\nintentional in the way i was thinking\nabout things and so when i saw that you\nhad him and then you've had other key\npeople that i that i've definitely taken\npieces of their journey and applied it\nto mine like i just i love that because\nyou are like the company that you keep\nso i think that that was like that was\ncool for me to see the other day i'm so\ngrateful man and you know we've had so\nmany mutual friends over the last few\nyears who've tried to connect us\nand last year it finally happened it was\nlike deepika was trying to connect us\nand then audrey was trying to connect us\nand it finally happened and we ended up\nlast year at a pumpkin patch uh i think\nit was just before halloween or\nsomething like that yeah and we just had\nlike the best conversation i i walked\naway going i need to spend a lot more\ntime with that guy so i'm so glad that\nyou know we're getting to do this and\nthat we get to mind your mind today and\nreally get inside there and i want to\nstart with actually i watched your short\nfilm with rolls-royce\nand what stood out for me was when you\nguys talked about how the journey\nis what defines greatness and not the\ndestination now that's an idea that\nwe're told and we've heard again and\nagain and again but when you said it\nnot only did i believe it\ni also\nunderstood that you're applying it and\ni'd love to hear how you've been trying\nto apply that in your journey\nas you are still growing towards an\nincredible destination\nso i think that one of the key things is\nit wasn't always that wasn't always my\nthought and that wasn't always ryan and\ni thought so i think it's it's something\nthat we've learned along the journey and\ni mean to backtrack a little bit i think\nwhen you're starting anything especially\nwhen you started at a younger age as\nryan and i did we started apl when we\nwere in college you focus a lot on\nwhere you want to end up you don't\nnecessarily always think about enjoying\nthe ride and enjoying the journey to get\nthere and i think that again like\nlistening to your podcast and and in the\nthings than the intentions that you that\nyou think about that's been really\nimportant to the way that ryan and i\nwere so when we started off on our\njourney you have these goals these grand\nambitions we all do whether it's it's\nyour your day-to-day life or your\npersonal life or what you're doing in\nyour profession\nyou have these milestones that you're\nhoping for that you're wishing for that\nyou believe can happen and a lot of\ntimes you don't think about what you're\ndoing day in and day out and\nappreciating what you're doing day in\nand day out and how those will get you\nto where you want to go and so i think\nthat as\nryan and i started to achieve more as we\nreally started to go further in this\njourney\na lot of it was happening really quickly\neven though we were years in and we not\nwe didn't take it for granted but we\ntook the achievements took the the\nsuccesses not just like financial but\njust successes as as a business as a\nbrand and individually and we said we\nneed them uses to get to the next thing\nwe need to use to get to the next thing\ni think there was a moment in time\nprobably 2016\nwhere\nryan and i we we had got this big award\nwe we were knowing forbes 30 under 30 is\nis there's a lot of other things that\nstarted going our way\nand\none thing we hadn't been great at was\ncelebrating the small daily victories in\ngiving ourselves and our team the\nmomentum to go to the next thing instead\nof just focusing on moving to the next\npoint and so i think we had to have that\nrealization where\nwe we were doing so many things we were\nachieving so much but we didn't have the\ninternal appreciation for what was\nhappening every single day it just\nbecame so consistent that\nit became normal and i think that's\nthat's that's not positive i think you\nneed to appreciate your your daily\njourney you need to appreciate the\npeople around you what they're\ncontributing to it and i think that that\nwas a key change for us and so at that\nmoment in time ryan and i and again keep\npeople around us we made a clear\ndecision that we are going to appreciate\nwhat we're doing every single day we're\ngoing to stay inspired by what we want\nto do in the future but if you there is\na way to exist mentally in the current\nplane and in the future plane and i\nthink there's there's a delicate balance\nand i think for us we had in the\nbeginning we didn't have that many\nvictories and so\nyou had to constantly put in the work\nput in the repetition to get that one\nbut then one of the other key aspects of\nmy story is compounding and as you get\nas you get one thing the next thing\ncomes typically quicker than the next\none comes quicker the next one comes\nquicker and so for us we tried to\nslow down\nthe focus on the ultimate end point\nbecause you are probably going to get\nthere regardless of what your goals are\nif you put in the effort you put in the\nwork and you get lucky you will end up\nreaching these points but if you're only\nfocused on that one moment in time\nthat's so finite and you're not\nappreciating\nthe the longer term which is actually\nthe day-to-day in the journey it's not\ngoing to be a win it's just going to be\nanother uh accomplishment or milestone\nbut it won't feel the same and i think\nthat when we decided to put happiness\nbefore success in a measurement for\nsuccess and that daily happiness and i\nknow you can't be happy a hundred\npercent of the time every single day and\nand the ups and downs do make those\nother things feel greater but if you can\nthink every day that i want to\nappreciate this journey and what i'm\ndoing today will get me to where i'm\ngoing tomorrow and if i appreciate it\ntoday i will appreciate it tomorrow and\nyou make those clear conscious decisions\nyou will feel much better about your\njourney and you will feel much better\nabout your destination but you spend\nmuch more time on the journey than you\ndo at the destination so if you can\nappreciate the longer part the part at\nthe end will feel even better and i\nthink the only way that we were able to\nrealize that was by not realizing that\nearlier and so um but it's like anything\nit's it's you learn as you go and if you\nkeep an open mind and you can take\nfeedback and you can look at others and\nand see that you're inspired by what\nthey're doing what they've learned and\nthen how can i take little pieces that\napply it to to what i'm doing and i and\ni saw other people that were enjoying\nsimpler things than i was and and i\nappreciated that and so i said there's a\nway that i need to implement that into\nmy daily life as did ryan and the rest\nof the team and\ni mean we feel great about what we do\nand i think that's the most important\nthing and that's the key to enjoying the\njourney which helps you enjoy the\ndestination even more i think that's\nthat was such a comprehensive answer\nbecause\nlike i said it's a statement we've heard\nit's a statement we've seen but\ni really appreciate your interpretation\nof that and how practical you've made it\nbecause\ni feel the same way i always say to\npeople like winning the award\nor getting the title\nthat's one percent of the journey like\nthat amount of time you spend on stage\nis like 30 seconds long yeah and and\nthat was 30 seconds it took like three\nyears\n30 years you know to get to that three\nseconds or 30 seconds of time that you\nspent receiving an award\nand you're you're spot on like if you\ndon't feel passionate when you wake up\nevery morning to do what you're doing\ncan you take me back adam let i want to\ngo back what i love about this\nconversation is i'm discovering you i\nthink the world is discovering you i i\nknow me and my friends are massive fans\nof apl i i had a ton of your shoes\nbefore i even knew you\nuh not only are they comfortable they\nlook fantastic\nthe store at the grove is one of my\nfavorite stores just generally to walk\ninto\nwhich was where i was first introduced\nto apl\nbut\nlet's go back to your childhood i'm\nintrigued\nby can you think about a pivotal moment\nthat happened while you were young\nthat has framed who you are today was\nthere a particular experience maybe with\na parent with a friend anyone in your\nlife\nsomething someone said something someone\ndid that has created part of who you are\ntoday that you feel has been so integral\nin your life positive or negative or you\nknow healthy or unhealthy i mean i think\ni think there's a lot of things so it's\nhard to point to one i think one thing i\nrealized early on and i i know this\nisn't applicable to most because they\naren't twins but insult i'll choose one\nthat's more applicable to other people\nbut\ni realized early on as did my brother\nthat we had a unique competitive\nadvantage that there was two of us with\nalmost\nidentical\npoints of view but with unique\ncharacteristics that\ncomplement one another so we realized\nthat really early on and again like a\nlot of times with kids peer pressure is\nsomething that becomes really really\ndifficult and because there's two of us\nand there's typically one other person\nwe could not be pressured to move one\nway so i think like that played a role\nin terms of like building internal\ncharacter but\ni think something that um\nthat was key to my journey is\ni've always believed always\nnow as an adult but i think this because\nof a kid was that you can turn a\nnegative situation into a positive if\nyou change your perspective on the\nnegative and try to skew it more\npositive and so i guess one real\nimportant example is when i was a kid\ni didn't do great in school and i was\nalways an incredible athlete but i did\nnot do the greatest in school and it\nwasn't because i didn't have the\nintellect but it's because i\nwasn't in the right\nit wasn't important to me in the\nsituation that i was in so i was at this\none school i was not doing very well i\nwas doing great sports but i wasn't\ndoing very well as a student and i felt\nlike the environment wasn't the right\none for me because it just it was too\nit was too small i needed to i needed to\nbe able to become more of myself i\nalways had this like\na nagging self-confidence that i knew\nwhere if i trusted myself and i listened\nto myself i could make the most of it\nand so\nmiddle of my ninth grade year my parents\nbasically gave me the opportunity to\ntransfer to a school that wasn't as good\nof a school but it was\nit was it was it was more diverse it had\na greater opportunity for\neducational and athletic success and i\nchanged my environment and again like\none thing that's been important to our\njourney is changing your environment\nwhen you believe you need to and so that\ngave me the ability to go to a school at\na different part of the city in a\ndifferent environment and then i was\nable to\nlearn at a better rate i was able to do\nsports at a much higher level and i\nbelieved in myself because it's it's\nhard switching schools in the middle of\nthe year making trying to make all new\nfriends and things of that nature and so\ni think like\nthe key learning point from that is like\nif you get out of your comfort zone and\nyou become comfortable with the\nuncomfortable you may discover something\nin yourself that you never knew you\ncould do or take it to a level that you\nthat you\ndidn't think was possible and so for me\nthat was a really big one and i think it\nwas\nif that doesn't happen i'm not here\ntoday and so i think that movement in\nthe middle of my ninth grade year i was\na young man i'm 14 15 years old but that\ngave me the confidence to try\nuncomfortable situations make the most\nof it and then they may actually end up\nbending benefiting you much more than\nyou ever could have thought so that was\ni think as a kid something that um went\na really really really long way\nyeah that's such a great insight because\nyou almost don't get to\nreap the rewards of that up until now\nlike much later on in that moment you're\njust like this is the worst thing that\ncould have ever happened to me right and\nand i and i really do love that you\nreflected on that moment in that way\nbecause\ni find that anytime i ask someone that\nquestion\nrarely do they pick something good that\nhappened right it's like people never\nsay oh when i was 15 i had the best you\nknow it's it's always like well this\nwent wrong or this changed and this\nshifted and i think it's fascinating to\nhear that in your journey too now when\nyou\nand your brother and i by the way i love\nthe twins answer i love the twins so i\nit doesn't matter that we can't relate\nwe all want to relate like we're like oh\nthat's so cool like you know that's\nthat's how i felt\nwhen you have this idea for apl and i\nwant to talk about the idea but what i'm\nreally interested by\nis also how lots of people start stuff\nat college\nor at school\nand it kind of fizzles out by the time\nyou graduate and then you go on to get a\nreal job and you get real\nresponsibilities and you wear a real\nsuit right like that kind of becomes the\njourney that most people go on\nwhat i'm fascinated by is when you when\nyou come up with this idea\nwhat did it take\nto go from this is cool\nto this is real\nand and what was that journey like so\ntell us about the ideation but then tell\nus about how this went from like this is\ncool we're doing something interesting\ntoo this is actually real and this is\nwhat we're going to commit time to\nso i think i think one of the important\nthings about ryan and i is that if\nsomebody tells us\nwe're not able to do something that's\nessentially just gasoline to to what we\nhave to do so i think\nryan used apl as his business plan in\nschool and\nhe didn't even get top ten so i i don't\nremember what the grade is he still has\nit but like he didn't even get top ten\nthey didn't believe in it and it's not\nbecause they didn't think it was a good\nidea it's because they didn't think that\nwe could execute on the vision the way\nthat we did\nand so i think one of the things i used\nto have as\nas a kid than when i was in college i\ndon't have it anymore because it's more\nso like a running tally that i keep in\nmy mind is i would have this list of\nthings that we had to do and that i\nwanted to do top thing on my list i\nnever achieved which is making the nba\neverything else i've done since then\nbut i think when thinking about the idea\nand execution\none thing i heard and again i think one\nof the parts of my story that's\nimportant is i've heard important things\nat the right moment in time and i've\nlistened to it and\ni heard the easiest way to get where\nyou're going is one step at a time and\nso\nwhen i was in college and when ryan and\ni were and we were thinking through the\nidea\none of the things again back to the\njourney aspect is you think of where you\nwant to go but you don't necessarily\nusually think of the steps you need to\ntake in the interim to get there and so\nryan was lucky enough that when he was\nin this program and people are telling\nus this wasn't a good idea it's not\ngoing to work\nwe had to think deeper through the idea\ndeeper through the execution and i mean\nwe started as a direct to consumer brand\nin 2010\nso it's like\nin 2010 people were not going direct to\nconsumer but we didn't have the\nresources and i think one of the things\nthat a lot of people think when they're\ncreating something is everybody's paying\nattention to me if i fail everyone's\ngoing to see it but most of the time\neverybody else is focused on themselves\nand they're not really concerned with\nwhat you're doing so if you focus on\nyourself you focus on what you're doing\nand you try something\nif you mess up there's a way to recover\nit and there's a way to keep moving\nforward you learn from it you won't make\nthe same mistake again\nand so for us like we spent so much time\nworking on this technology we wanted to\nbuild a shoe around it and one thing we\ndid and i think this is what helped us\nbe successful and go from idea to\nexecution\nis again most people when they're\ncreating something\nthey are scared to ask for help\ntypically and they don't go to the\nhighest level of help they try to go to\nthe lowest level because they think\nsomebody that's close to me will help me\nnot somebody at the top somewhere and so\nwhat ryan and i believed is if we went\nto the largest people possible\nand said we have this amazing idea it's\nremarkable we can't execute on this we\nwill put the work and do it can you help\nus\nand they said yes we went to sneaker\nfactory that had no business saying yes\nto us\nbut they thought they loved the idea\nthey thought it was unique\nand so from there we were able to\nimplement what we wanted to do be able\nto develop things that typically you\nwould not be able to and so i think\nagain like the the nugget of our journey\nbecause we make shoes so most people\naren't going to make shoes and that's\nthe part that's different is that\nwe believe that if you ask people for\nhelp and you're willing to accept their\nhelp and you go to\nsomebody that typically you wouldn't\nthink would say yes and you give them\nthe opportunity to help you people\ninherently want to help and so i think\nwhen you're thinking about executing\nsomething\nyou shouldn't you gotta you have to\nthink big\nyou can all it's easier to work your way\ndown than it is to work your way up and\nso that was the way that we looked at it\nand again it's just we had an idea of\nhow we wanted to execute it we asked the\nright questions to people and\ni we didn't have this idea of you have\nto have a specific mentor we believe\nthat you could have specific mentors for\nspecific things so if i need help with\nproduction i would ask a production\nperson if i needed help with logistics i\nwould ask a logistics person if i needed\nhelp with counting i would ask an\naccounting person but there's not an\nend-all be-all for each thing so that\nwas really what the point of difference\nfor us was we were able to ask help we\nhad amazing people that were around us\nwhen in that moment in time and we just\nhad pure determination like we were we\nwere\nobsessed with taking this idea and\nexecuting it and we were going to do\nwhatever it took and since we didn't\nhave any investors we had to do it\nourselves and so i think and we weren't\nscared to fail like that's that's\nanother thing is that there's there's a\nreal difference between fear and danger\nand and when you're starting an idea\nmost it's all fear it's not it's not\ndangerous it's you're scared of it so\nyou just have to conquer that emotion\nand you can learn most things if you ask\nquestions to the right people adam you\nare just dropping dropping wisdom\neverywhere i mean there's so many things\nin that that i need to now break down so\nfirst of all everyone is listening\nyou need to get your notebook out right\nnow and and write stuff that adam is\nsaying down because there are so many\nthings or you're gonna have to listen to\nthis episode twice so it's up to you you\neither listen to episode twice or you\nget a notebook out right now the idea\nthat there's a difference between fear\nand danger what a\ngreat way to\nclarify\nhow we experience it that is that's just\nbrilliant like i've never heard it been\nput in that way before and i think that\nthat is such great language to help us\nrealize we react as if we're in danger\nbut actually we're in fear\nand and that's where that's where things\nstart to go wrong so i thought that was\nbrilliant the other thing that you\nmentioned that\ni\nreally am resonating with and it was\nkind of in there\nand i think it's an underrated part of\nentrepreneurship is that you were trying\nand you have of course now but at the\ntime you were trying to create\ntechnology like there was an engineering\naspect it wasn't just we want to make\ncool stuff and trendy stuff and fatty\nstuff it was like no we're actually\nworking on something and i find that one\nof the most underrated things about\nentrepreneurship is people with deep\nskill sets\nand having a skill whether it's with\ninnovation technology engineering\nspeaking marketing whatever it may be\ntalk to me a bit about\nwhere\ndid you learn about technology\nwhen it comes to\nathletics because that to me is a really\ndifferent way\nto look at product creation as opposed\nto just saying we want to make stuff\nthat looks good so\nback back to i think a unique\ncompetitive advantage and since we don't\nhave 10 hours i didn't want to give you\nthe full background but as a kid\nmy dad worked in the footwear industry\nand he actually helped like one of the\nkey parts to my story is he helped\ncreate the\nla gear lighted shoes and so my brother\nand i were the first product testers\never for the la gear lighted shoes and\nhe brought them home and he gave them to\nus and that day we gave him feedback on\nand we're five years old to give him\nfeedback on how to try to make the shoes\nbetter and obviously it's we're not\ngiving him technical feedback at five\nbut we're we're telling them you should\nmove the lights from the back to the\nside of the shoe so we can see our\nlights but the the technical aspect of\nit is from a very very very young age\nmy dad would bring us to the office\nand would bring us into the tech\ntechnology line reviews would bring us\ninto the innovation area and we would\nsee how to engineer specific footwear\nproduct so i think again it wasn't that\nryan and i woke up one day and decided\nthat we wanted to engineer a technology\nthat would instantly make you jump\nhigher we have been obsessed with\nfootwear specific technology since we\nwere five years old and again\nwhen you're talking you asked earlier\nabout key moments in my childhood my dad\nas a kid showed me what was possible not\nsaying come here and look at this but\nthrough ideas and i think like that's\nthe greatest type of inspiration you can\nget for anybody not just from a parent\nbut from anyone is showing somebody that\nsomething is possible through their own\nideas and execution so\nwe took an interest to developing\nfootwear technologies from an age of\nfive years old obviously there was a lot\nof knowledge that needed to come\nafterwards and took years to get and we\nweren't eight-year-old whiz kids we were\neight eight-year-old with with ideas but\nas you become older as you become\nsmarter you focus on the things that are\nimportant to you and sports\nand technology and specifically footwear\nbased technologies were things that were\nalways important to us so i think that\nthe learning point about that for\nentrepreneurs is that\neverybody regardless of what you do has\na predisposition to a specific thing\nthat they care about that they're\npassionate about and they can focus on\nif you can learn enough information\nyou can figure out how to make something\nbetter and that was basically the basis\nfor how we did it is that we believed\nthat we could make a shoe that were in\nthe technology that would do what we\nwanted to do we just had to learn the\nbasis behind the fundamentals and that's\nwhat we did and that's how we focused on\nit that's how we learned it and\nto this day i continue to learn so much\nnot only from our own exploration into\nfootwear but from other people what they\nteach us and things they bring to the\ntable and i think that i learned at a\nreally really young age and i think it's\nagain it's the fact that\nmy dad and the team listened to our idea\nand then i saw it actually coming to\nlife\nand so i think seeing what's possible\nand knowing that if you're passionate\nabout something you don't have to be a\nscientist to naturally figure it out you\njust have to be\na creative engineer and i think like\nthat's a lot of really successful\nentrepreneurs it's not that they know\nsomething about everything it's that\nthey know a lot about a specific area\nand for us like that's it's always been\nour passion we've we've always loved\ntechnology and we've always loved\ninnovation and pushing what's possible\nand i think that regardless of what your\navenue is even if you're not creating\nproduct if you're creating content if\nyou're creating\nanything like there's a way to be\ninnovative in it and there's a way to to\npush it to it as far as you possibly can\nyeah i'm so glad you shared that detail\nbecause to me that's\nthe part that i love\nmy community really getting close to\nbecause when you've been that close to\nsomething\nsince you're five years old and you've\ntaken an interest that closeness has\nturned into a passion and then it's\nturned into your own cause\nthat's what it takes like that that's\nwhat it takes like it takes that\nobsession that absorption that\nyou're immersed in this whole world it's\nnot like one day you wake up and you\nhave a random idea\nto go and create something right and i\nthink often\nwe don't give ourselves the time to get\nclose to something and deeply immerse in\nit and experience it and we we're\nlooking for like i don't know what i'm\npassionate about like i don't know what\nmy purpose is i don't know what i'm\nexcited about but that's because we're\ntrying to hope that it's just going to\nmiraculously appear\nand i love that idea that actually well\nno this has been a part of our life now\nwhen we talk about technology your load\nand launch technology became the first\nband shoe in the nba history right yeah\nand that is just so like that is i don't\nknow if there's anything cooler than\nthat like to get i don't know if it's\nbetter to get into the nba or get to get\nin and get banned but like to get banned\nby the nba to me that sounds like the\ncoolest story ever but as a company it\ncan also be difficult i want to hear\nwhat was that like to find out like what\nwas that like as an experience because\nthat's not common like i i i don't hear\nstories like that all the time so i\nthink\nthe the unique point part about that is\nthat\nso to this day we've never raised a\ndollar of outside capital we own 100 of\nthe business and at that moment in time\nwe had zero dollars and then when i mean\nzero we had zero dollars for marketing\nand so\nwe looked at it as\nthe nba is the greatest basketball\norganization in the world it's top tier\nand when you think about leagues it's\nit's top tier and so the dream when\nyou're creating a product for a specific\nsport is you wanted to be at the top\ntier with the best people\nand the fact that the nba said that it's\ntoo good because it provides aware with\nan undue competitive advantage that\nsounds really positive when you frame it\nthat way but if you look at it from the\nother side of the coin saying\nthe best basketball players in the world\ncan't wear your product that sounds\nnegative and so the way that we looked\nat it is that this is a very unique\nopportunity where we can wholeheartedly\nembrace it or we can fight it with\neverything that we have which wasn't\nmuch at the time\nand we said let's embrace this let's\nturn this negative into a positive let's\nsay banned by the nba\nthe reason is it instantly makes you\njump higher and they can't wear it\nbecause it's so good and so there's a\nway to again you change your perspective\non something you take a negative you\nmake it a positive ends up becoming the\nbest thing that ever happened to us when\nit happened\nnumber one news story in the world\nnumber two three and 17 most searched\nterms on google over a million articles\nwritten or posted about it within 10\ndays we sold nine months worth of\ninventory in three days which is\nimportant because we're self-financed no\noutside investors\nthere's three of us in a room\nthat's 60 square feet when we find this\nout so we basically find out that the\nworld leading\nbasketball organization isn't allowing\nour product because it provides aware\nwith an undue competitive advantage so i\nthink at first there's that huge shock\nlike\noh man this is insane like what do we do\nand then instantly we thought we need to\nlean into this we need to embrace this\nthis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\nwe can make this negative feel positive\nand that's exactly what we did and again\ni think one thing that made it special\ntoo is that if we would have fought it i\nthink the nba would have fought us\nbut the fact that we embraced it made\nthem embrace us like eve like david\nstearns passed away but he went on a\nshow i think like that night and said\nlike we're looking into the shoe that\ndidn't sleep makes you jump out it might\neven make me dunk and like the way that\nhe said it it was it was playful even\nthough this was it was a very serious\nthing that they weren't allowing people\nto wear it but i think the fact that we\nleaned into it and we embraced this\nthing that could have been negative\nchanged the perspective of it made it\npositive and it made the people that\nwere essentially saying no lean into it\nembrace it as well so it ended up being\na huge win for all of us i actually\nthink it was the\nonly time obviously it's changed since\nthat the nba was the number one trending\ntopic on twitter when there wasn't like\na\nnumber one trending sports organization\non twitter when there wasn't another\nthing so i think that they saw that\nthere was value in the social equity\nthat came along with it we leaned into a\nnegative made it positive we felt\npositive about it we reaped the benefits\nof it because we sold the product and\nthen the nba also got the reward from it\nso i think\nall in all it was just it was a\ntremendous experience and it and it\nliterally laid the groundwork for where\nwe are today and i if that doesn't\nhappen again i mean one of the key\nthings my story is that doesn't happen i\ndon't know where where we end up today\nand we made them the most of a negative\nand turned into a positive that's a true\nwin-win-win and what i find so\nfascinating about it is that this is\nkind of like a recurring pattern in your\nlife like your superpower is the ability\nto transform a negative into a positive\nand to be able to pivot like that's\nreally a superpower because even today\nyou don't\nmake basketball shoes even that's what\nyou started making like there's just\nanother pivot right there's expansion\nthere's growth like\ni find that that's sometimes the hardest\nthing to do\nand going back to what you said before\nis the only thing you never got to do\nwas making the nba there's another pivot\nthere as well now adam tell me how how\ngood were you\nhow serious were you\nand how close were you well so i mean i\nwas a division one athlete i played\nbasketball usc i think i had a rude\nawakening when i got to college that i\nwasn't gonna make the nba because a few\nof my teammates did make the nba and i\nrealized that they were much better than\ni was and that i wasn't going to be able\nto get there\nbut i think too one of the points that\nyou were just making and it's important\nto our journey is that\ntypically when you think of emotions and\nlike this turning negatives into\npositives\nyou think of emotion you think you\neither have to suppress it or you have\nto embrace it and i think there's a way\nin which you\ncan experience it internally\nbut you don't have to express it\nexternally and so i think like\nwhat we've done in these negative\nsituations is\nwe think through it\nwe process it and then we insane and do\nwhat we intend to do not what we are\ndoing in terms of a reaction and i think\nlike for me that's been super important\nto my journey it's been super important\nfor for ryan and i and something that\nagain it became a super power because if\nyou control your emotions you're very\npowerful if you're controlled by your\nemotions you're\nnot as powerful and so i think like that\nwas something that we learned really\nearly on but to your basketball question\ni wish i would it could have been six\nfoot ten and had uh had a different\njourney in terms of that but it\neverything works out the way that it's\nsupposed to so if i would have made the\nnba i probably wouldn't be on your\npodcast here today so i'm i'm i'm\nthankful for the journey that i've had\noh yeah i know i mean maybe you would\nmaybe we've had some i'm trying to think\nnow who have we had from the nba we've\nhad yeah dwayne wade on i know that i\njust interviewed wayne who was amazing\nwe had dennis rodman on a couple of\nyears ago which was just fascinating\nconversation obviously thankful to have\nhad the opportunity to sit with kobe\nbryant um so so maybe adam maybe maybe\nit would have happened that way too we\nwould have brought we would have been\nbrought together either way uh but\nno i i really appreciate\nthis message this pattern that's coming\nout through your whole journey of\npivoting of of looking for being able to\nturn a situation something that looks\nlike a failure or looks like a rejection\nand being able to turn that into a win\nand sure it's easy to\ncelebrate that now but you know you can\nonly imagine when the news is the\nbiggest organization in the world that\nis your target market to help promote\nand propel this brand is saying you're\nnot allowed and that as as a product\ncreator can be really really challenging\nyou know when you think about it's\nalmost like saying you know this\ncompany's not going to stock your thing\nor we're not going to allow you know and\nso\ni i love the way that i'm hearing this\nthrough your journey and how it's\nconstantly shifted i want to hear\nhow do you and your brother\nmake decisions have you created like a\nbecause when i even met you what i what\ni experienced from you is you're very\nmethodical\nstrategic\nvery thoughtful it's not you know it's\nnot random this isn't just some random\nluck story and and i really appreciate\nthat because i really admire conscious\nintentional thinkers\ncan you walk me through how you and your\nbrother make decisions when it comes to\nthe business and then diving into things\nlike recruitment and leadership any of\nthose areas that you want to dive into\nand stories you want to share of how\nhave you made good decisions and what is\nyour decision making process so i think\nagain to one of the\nspeaking to the podcast when you had ray\ndalia on i mean the key to his entire\nsuccesses is principles and i think that\na lot of times\nwhen you think back think back on on the\nthings that you love the most your most\namazing journeys your your best\nexperiences they're usually spontaneous\nthings and\nthe best ability to be spontaneous is\nwhen you have a clear and methodical\napproach to how you make decisions\nbecause it gives you a lot of room to be\nspontaneous because you know you can\nstay within this realm and so\nfor ryan and i when we think about\nhow we're making decisions we anchor\nthem in clear deliverables that we have\nto achieve and so i think like a lot of\ntimes when people want to make decisions\nthey they try to make something for the\nmoment but they don't think of where\nthat's going to lead them and so back to\nthinking of the entire journey and the\ndestination\ni think you need to know\nwhen you're making this this is a key\ndecision it's not like daily what you're\ngonna have for breakfast but like key\nlong-term decisions is you need to know\nwhere does this\nlead you and where do you want it to\nlead you what's the intention behind\nmaking this decision and so i think that\nfor us has been something that's been\nreally really important is that\nmichael burke who's the ceo of louis\nvuitton he gave me some of the best\nadvice that i ever had and which is you\nneed to think about do you want to do\nsomething for the moment or do you want\nto do something to be dynastic and\nhe\nagain he gave this advice to us at the\nright moment in time we heard it this is\nback i think 2016.\nand ryan and i always wanted to build\nsomething dynastic and so if you want to\nbuild something dynastic and you want to\nbring people along for that journey you\nhave to make decisions and have the\napproach for the long term you can't do\nit for the immediate and so\nall of the decisions that we make are\nbased on\nbuilding essentially this house if you\nwant to build a house you have to have a\nsolid foundation if you don't have a\nsolid foundation it doesn't matter what\nyou put on top of it because it won't\nlast and so the way that we look it is\nevery decision we make is another brick\nin building this house and so if you\nhave one bad brick you can replace it\nbut if you're constantly laying bad\nbricks and you're saying oh these are\nthe best ones that i can get right now\nbut they may not last for the long term\nyou're gonna have to eventually replace\nit and so the way that ryan and i look\nat it is make fewer decisions but make\nbetter decisions\nand\ntake more time\nand there's nothing wrong with saying no\nlike you say no 99 times so that you can\nsay yes the 100th time and that 100th\ntime is worth more than 100x what you\ndid if you would have said yes all of\nthose other times so when we're thinking\nabout decisions it's really keeping that\nat the heart of it is that where are we\ntrying to go why are we trying to go\nhere how are we going to get there and\nwhy should we say yes to this and like\nif if you do that and you stand behind\neach of your decisions you'll be proud\nof your decisions and then you will\ntypically make the right ones for\nyourself you can't be right a hundred\npercent of time and you shouldn't hold\nyourself to that standard and it's it's\nirrational to do so but if you feel\nconfident in your decisions the\nintention was right and the people\naround you feel great about it you will\ntypically make the right decision and i\nthink like\none of the things that ryan and i have\nalways tried to do is make difficult\nthings as simple as possible which means\nremove the excess you're thinking about\na really challenging situation\nshould i go here should i do this\nin large scenarios and take away all of\nthe excess from the decision what's at\nthe core of the problem what's at the\ncore of why you want to do this and then\nevaluate that and be transparent and\nhonest with yourself like a lot of times\npeople\ndon't want to be honest with themselves\nthey build up these other things and\nthey take on these external factors and\nsay like i'm doing this for other people\nand they're not really being transparent\nwith themselves but you inherently know\nwhat you should do and you're going to\nmake some wrong decisions along the road\nand it's okay to make a wrong decision\nif the intention was right but you don't\nwant to make intentional wrong decisions\nand like people do that all the time and\nthey don't talk about it and so i think\nagain that's something we discovered\nearly on in the thought making process\nand the decision process is if we feel\nconfident and the intention is right and\nit's for the long term it's in line with\nthe dynastic approach and the people\naround us will\nembrace it and that's the right decision\nand sometimes it's simple it's much more\nsimple than you think it is and i mean\nwe're complex creatures so we can make\nany simple idea very complex i mean i've\nlistened to enough of\nyour podcast and other people that are\nleaders in the space and it's like the\nwhole goal with whether it's meditation\nor anything else that you're doing is\nyou want to try and simplify the\nexperience because that's when you get\nmost of your clarity and so when you're\nthinking through the decision making\nprocess that's what you try to do is try\nto make it as clear as possible the\neasiest way to do so is to make it as\nsimple as possible adam master class in\ndecision making right there i mean that\nthat was brilliant i i i love this\nbecause you know it's these things are\njust thrown around and i can tell that\nhow much\ngrappling you've done with the idea and\nhow you've simplified the idea for\nyourself and\nyou're you're so right that\nthe reason why decision making often\nfeels so hard is we're allowing noise in\nand distractions and then we're not\nreally asking the right questions we're\nnot asking the right people we're\nlooking at it from the wrong direction\ni loved something you said there you\nsaid that people sometimes make\nintentionally wrong decisions can you\nexplain and expand on that a little bit\nmore about how we do that i read an\namazing book when i was like i think i\nwas like 16 17 years old and i read a\nbook called predictably irrational by\ndan o'reilly he's one of my favorite\nauthors\nand he wrote a book talking about how\nhumans make predictably irrational\ndecisions all the time and yes and i\nread that book and i was like no way i\nthought i was smart and then you read\nthat book and you realize wait a minute\nyou're not as smart as you think you are\nbecause so many decisions are the way\nthings are presented and what you miss\ntalk me about what you meant when you\nsaid we make\nintentionally wrong decisions and and\nhow we end up there because\nsometimes i think we're not good at\nmaking the right decisions because we\ndon't know where we go wrong well so i\nthink a lot of times it's you don't know\nwhy you are making the decision so most\nof the time people can be pressured and\nagain this is back to like a peer\npressure situation is that\nyou can be pressured into making a\ndecision and you at your core\nand know that this is not the right\ndecision but you believe that you need\nto make this decision and so\nyou in every instance you can't make the\nright decision so that's not what i'm\ntrying to say but there's\nwe can all point to moments in our lives\nwhen we've done it where we said yes to\nsomething or we do something knowing we\nshould not do it there's there's so many\nthings that happen because of that and\nthere's so many\nresults of that that compound and become\nworse and worse and worse because we do\nthese things that we don't truthfully\nbelieve in and know that that they're\nnot right for us to do and so i think a\nlot of times\nthink back to your worst decisions or\nthe decisions that people make that\nthey're not necessarily proud of or even\njust the wrong decision they\nknew what the right one was\nthey intentionally ignored it because\nthey thought so somebody might be upset\nif i say yes or\nit's usually they're making it for\nsomeone else or not making it for\nthemselves so they don't put their self\nat the center of this decision they're\nputting others there and you can't help\nother people if you can't help yourself\nand so i i know it's it's a difficult\nthing and you can't apply to every\nsituation but\ni learned really i'd say early on that\nif i'm in a place of strength and i'm in\na place of support i can help you much\nbetter than if i'm intentionally just\ntrying to help you and i know i'm going\nto be at a disadvantage i'm not going to\nbe able to help you i can i can help\nsomeone much better from a position of\npower than i can a position of weakness\nthat's like using power as a positive\nnot as a negative and so i think that\nwhen people are making these intentional\nwrong decisions a lot of times they're\nnot coming from a bad place they're\ncoming from a place where they think\nthey need to do it to help others but\nthey're not they're not going to be in a\nposition to do it so i think that i\nidentified that relatively early on\nbecause i felt that when i felt the best\ni could help more people and i can make\nbetter decisions and again it's like\nback to like happiness is the core of\nsuccess right if you're happy and you\nhave that energy and you have that\ncharisma and you have all\nthe things that uh\nresonate from you people will gravitate\ntowards you but if you're\npushing out negative and it's in it and\npeople don't feel good about being\naround you you're intentionally making\nbad decisions\nyou should not go around somebody like\nthat and so i think that um a lot of\ntimes it doesn't come from a place of\nnegativity or\nor something that's bad it comes from\nthat you're trying to help somebody and\nyou're intentionally making the wrong\ndecision and you end up hurting\neverybody instead of helping them so i\nthink that again it's not being\nselfish it's taking care of yourself so\nthat you can help others and i think\nlike again when you think of intention\nyou think of like purpose if you do it\nfrom a positive place and you do it from\na place where you think you can help\nyourself you can help others you're\ngoing to make the right decisions and i\nthink that that's you that's how you\navoid those intentional bad decisions\nthat are intentional wrong decisions\nbecause\nthey don't lead to too much for anybody\nthey just end up hurting you great\nanswer man if if someone right now is\nlistening and they want to\nstart a business side hustle\nreally build something what's the first\nthree things they should be thinking\nabout\nif someone's listening right now going\nadam's advice is great i have an idea i\nwant to get started what's the first\nthree things that they should do well i\nthink it depends on what the type of\nbusiness is but i think the first thing\nyou need to do is identify how you're\ngoing to start it and so i think you\nneed to know like you could have the\nbest idea in the world but ideas don't\nmatter much if you don't have execution\nbehind it so i think you need to figure\nout how are you going to execute it two\ni think you need to figure out what you\ndon't know in terms of where you want to\ngo and who you can ask to help you get\nthere and then\nthree you need to understand that it's\ngoing to be longer harder and more\nexpensive than you think it will be but\nit will also be more rewarding so\nyou have to have that same type of\nenergy as you go through i think there's\nclear specific\nthings that apply to different\nbusinesses so i don't think there's\ngeneralization it's more so the idea but\nstarting anything the easiest way to do\nit is one step at a time and you will\nbecome better every day\neven if it doesn't feel like it but\nrepetition leads to progress and so i\nthink that that's really really\nimportant when you're starting something\nand again like you have to believe in\nyourself because\nbelief is different than hope hoping for\nthings won't get you very far but belief\nin things will get you very very far so\ni think that that's those are key\nunderlying principles those three things\nbut starting anything is the easiest way\nto get to where you want to go for sure\nfor sure can you adam i want to shift\nfrom like your mind and your ideas and\nthe way you think to\nhow you live can you take us through a\nday in the life of adam like how does it\nstart how does it end what does it look\nlike what's been your routine more\nrecently what are some things that\nyou've changed over time that have\nactually created momentum and\nacceleration so it's funny because my\nschedule is completely different than\ni'm sure yours in in most in general and\ni think this again becoming comfortable\nwith who you are this was\nit was a process and i didn't have the\nability early on in the journey i do\nhave much more of an ability of it now\nbut i go to sleep at nearly four a.m\nevery day and i will wake up closer to\na.m so i think a lot of times when i\nthink of entrepreneurs and people in my\nposition they think you're up at five or\nsix am you're you're beating the sun but\ni'm the exact opposite and i found that\nmy greatest point of inspiration and joy\nis typically during the night time when\nthere's less activity because i can\nfocus on where we want to go what we\nwant to do and also on myself and back\nto inherently knowing who i was and my\nbrother as well\nwe've known since we were 15 or 16 that\nthe the night schedule worked better for\nus but we didn't have an ability to\nimplement it because we were in high\nschool we were in college and then we're\nstarting the business you have to be on\nother people's more traditional\nuh i guess like calendar schedule and so\nas we got to higher levels we were able\nto continually shift it and obviously we\nhave people on our team that supplement\nthe early mornings and whatnot we work\nthe late nights but\ni really embraced what my natural\npredisposition was for my schedules that\nand i knew that i would be better if i\ncould operate on this schedule and just\nlike morning people love to be up in the\nmorning i love to just push it as far as\ni can late into the night and i think\nthere's nothing wrong with it and a lot\nof times uh it doesn't get glorified\nbecause it's it's a difficult schedule\nit doesn't work for everybody it's it's\nnot essentially normal but for me it's\nbeen the absolute best thing and being\nable to\nbuild my schedule the way that i want i\nbelieve is the ultimate luxury because\nagain i've\nif you can control your time\nin and not necessarily what happens\nthroughout your time but con to control\nhow you allocate your time most people\nwould rather have 10 minutes of you at a\nhundred percent than three hours of you\nat 20\nyou can't even though you spend more\ntime you can't give them all of you and\nso one of the things that i identified\nas i was building\nmy schedule this way and really leading\ninto it is i can give people 100 of my\neffort when i'm on a schedule that\naligns with when i want to go to sleep\nand when i want to wake up and also when\ni want to work out if i can if i can\nanchor those specific things i can give\neverybody much more of myself in a\nshorter period of time and again like\ni've heard you speak about it before and\nyou said it beautifully and it's true\nlike\nmost of the people in your life jay they\nwould prefer for you to have be with\nthem for 10 minutes give them 100 of\njade it's an amazing experience and for\nyou to be sitting in the room on your\nphone dozing off and not giving them the\nenergy that not only they deserve but\nthat you deserve to give them and so i\nthink that that's something that i\nidentified through how i built my\nschedule now i mean i work out\nevery single day and i think that's for\nme it's a really important thing because\ndiscipline has been something that is\nbeen pivotal to our journey too and i\nbelieve that\nwith discipline if you anchor yourself\nthrough specific things it gives you\nmore freedom it's\ndiscipline is something that that opens\nyou up and gives you more opportunities\nfirst to be spontaneous more freedom is\nbecause you have clear pillars clear\nanchors it's like if you're playing a\nvideo game and you get to the checkpoint\nyou can be more brave in your action\nbecause you know you can always go back\nto the checkpoint so like that's the way\ni live my my day-to-day life i try to\nhave specific windows where i'll do\ncalls but then i leave everything else\nessentially open because i love i love\nthe chaos in a positive way and i love\nthe spontaneity in a positive way and i\nthink that um if for me at least this is\nthe way i found my schedule if it's too\nback to back to back to back and\nscheduled out there's no\nthere's no real opportunity for the\nspontaneous excitement which i think\nthat we all need to have in one way or\nanother and i don't think that it's the\nsame for everybody but i think that you\nhave to leave yourself the ability to\ndiscover something or to discover a\nrelationship you didn't think was going\nto happen or a partnership you didn't\nthink was going to happen or a\nfriendship or things of that nature and\ni think that being able to anchor myself\nknowing i'm doing this these few things\nat these few times\nleaving this window open\nso that i can try things and again like\nthe the greatest opportunities i've ever\nhad have come from taking a chance on\nsomething and then\nanchoring it in the way that i i live my\nlife through my schedule and so\nagain it's it's something that i've had\nto work towards it wasn't like that on\nday one it's as you get further in the\njourney you hone it in more you have\nmore opportunity to try things and you\nhave more control i think like again one\nof the\nkey things for me in terms of success is\ncontrol over schedule and control over\ntime\nyou don't get to you don't know how much\ntime you have but if you can control how\nyou allocate that time that's truly the\ngreatest luxury and that's something\nthat i think is pivotal success and i\nthink again when we're thinking about\nour team\nin in specifically in the headquarters\neverybody has different schedules\nbecause everybody works differently and\ni've seen how positive it's been for\nryan and i and so we try to translate\nthat to the team as well i love hearing\nabout how different your schedule is to\nmine because it still represents the\nsame thing to both of us\nso yeah you still have discipline you\nstill have focus you still prioritized\naround when you can be creative it's\nbased on self-awareness and what's good\nfor you and right for you so the values\nthat we're choosing our schedule on is\nthe same like there's a very similar\nvalue set\nand it just looks different and that's\nactually the beauty of life like that\nand i think that's where we go wrong\nwhere we go\nyou know in a few years people are going\nto be saying oh yeah i need to do what\nadam's doing i need to sleep at 4am and\nyou know wake up and it's like well\nthat's not really gonna work or people\ncan be looking at going oh yeah i need\nto wake up like a you know like i need\nto go to sleep when jay doesn't work and\nit's like well that's not really what\nwe're saying what we're saying is\nif you're self-aware and you create\ndiscipline and rhythm in your life and\nspace for spontaneity then you've got to\nfigure out what works for you and where\nit works for you and so i love hearing\nhow different our schedules are because\nit just proves that there are multiple\nways that it can look\neven though there's a depth of why\nthey're created that way\nand in addition to that what i really\nappreciated you were talking about is\ni think we think of discipline as ease\nof either back to back\nand we think of laziness or spontaneity\nas completely free\nand what you've actually said is what\ndiscipline is is that you've created a\ndiscipline\nwhere you can be\nwhat i've been thinking about a lot\nlately is you can be effective and\nefficient\nand efficiency is often seen as\ndiscipline but efficiency means you do a\nlot of stuff\nbut effectiveness means you do important\nstuff\nand and i think that's what i'm seeing\nis missing in so many of our lives is\nthat we're trying to be efficient we do\nthe laundry do the dishes we spoke to\nthe team we check this off check this\noff check this off but then you're like\nwell i haven't had any creative\ninspiration today i haven't been\neffective\nand so i i really glad that you actually\nexplained discipline to be the meeting\nof efficiency and effectiveness together\ni mean i think you said it in a in an\nefficient and effective way\nuh the way that you just like\nillustrated what i was trying to to get\nacross but it's but it's true like i\nthink a lot of times people think of\ndiscipline as\nsomething that lacks freedom but\ndiscipline is the thread in the in the\nopportunity that gives you freedom and\nso i think and again you as you become\nmore efficient you can become more\neffective but it's hard to be effective\nif you're not efficient and so i think\nagain you you said it in an amazing way\nyou took a complex thing and you\ndigested it but it's it's been really\nparamount and i think it's something\nthat is is the way that my life has has\ngone in\nand again like i think that we have the\nsame theories you and i in terms of what\nwe want to accomplish\nfrom our day-to-day lives we do it at a\ndifferent time like i'm working out at\nmidnight you're doing things early in\nthe morning but it's we're looking to\nget the same type of result and i think\nagain when you were talking about being\nself-aware that is the absolute most\nimportant thing if you tried if i tried\nto work your schedule it wouldn't do the\nsame thing for me if you tried to do\nmine it wouldn't work but i think the\nfact that we've both been transparent\nhonest with ourselves and self-aware of\nwhat makes us show up as best as we\npossibly can and then that makes us\nbetter for other people and so i think\nfor us like that's that's the an\nincredible way to phrase it yeah and i\nand i respect and appreciate that in you\nso much because i think\nthere is a noise i mean i get different\nnoise so my noise is hey jay why don't\nyou hang out late like why don't you\ncome to this one right and then your\nnoise is well if you're an entrepreneur\nwho's disciplined shouldn't you be\nwaking up earlier and you know and\nexactly and it's just really interesting\nhow like no matter what you do there's\ngoing to be someone who disagrees with\nit\nand and that's why it has and that's why\ni respect what you just shared so i'm so\nhappy to hear that you have this\ni had no idea that that was your\nschedule now i know when to spend time\nwith you\nand and uh you know and i really like\nthat because i really hope that everyone\nwho's listening\nyou're feeling more confident that\nyou're not doing it wrong\nif you're doing what's right for you but\nnotice that adam and i are still basing\nit on values of discipline of focus of\ncreativity it's not that adam's not just\nsaying i do whatever i want whenever i\nwant and there's not there's no\nstructure he still even has a sleep\nyou still have a sleep routine it sounds\nlike when you're like yeah 4 a.m to 11\na.m right there's still a routine and so\nthat's what i find is really healthy\nadam this has been so powerful because\nwhat i love about the way you talk about\nentrepreneurship\nis that it's strategic and intentional\nbut then there's the spontaneity and\ncreativity\nand i'm so excited to see what you\ncontinue to build it's you know you're\n12 years in\nand\ni cannot wait to see you just continue\nto crush i mean you're already crushing\nit but but for the business to continue\nto grow and grow and grow\ni wanted to ask you\nbefore we come to the final five around\ncreativity and innovation\nand you spoke about spontaneity they're\nmeeting someone random like bumping into\nan idea i love that so much\nwhat has been your secret to creativity\nand innovation where\nhave you\ncontinued to find that\nthat discipline and that connection\nso i think one of our i guess one of our\ni don't know secrets is the right word\nbut again back to my brother like the\nfact that there's two of us and that\nwe're able to go through life\ntogether and we've had similar\nexperiences\ni mean my brother like to to be fully\ntransparent is more creative than i am\nand like when we're thinking of color\nstories and whatnot ryan's always\nbuilding these beautiful color stories\ncody who's our design director is\namazing jake and he's our content\ndirector he's incredible sam who heads\nup social she's she's amazing as well\nand just the whole team like it's i\ncould go on and on but one of the things\nthat i discovered and this actually came\nfrom my mom\nso uh\nand you wouldn't know based on what my\nlife has become\nbut until i was\nlike 25 years old i'm 34 now so no maybe\neven older this is like 2013.\nuntil but let's use 25 as the number\nuntil i'm 25 years old i hardly have\never left the country i left the country\none time twice actually i went to mexico\none time and i went to london one time\nand it's like each one was for two days\nand then when i'm\n25 my mom\nbasically says like you guys need to do\nmore and see more things you need to\ndiscover more things because we were so\nlaser focused on what we're going to do\nso a lot of the things that i've\nreflected on today with uga is things\ni've learned more specifically over the\nlast six or seven years in terms of like\nthe spontaneity the freedom and i've\nalways had the discipline but it was\nalmost at a level that was too high and\nso my mom\nhad said\nyou need to they were going to hong kong\nand she was it was for this wedding\nshe's like you need you need to come\nlike it's an old family friend you have\nto come to this wedding and i had no\nintention of of traveling overseas\nlong story short i end up ryan and i end\nup going it's the most incredible trip\num just like going outside of the\ncountry seeing something completely\ndifferent changing our perspective and\nwhen we're there we get inspired by this\nbridge and this bridge that never i'd\nnever seen pictures of it anything we\nget inspired by this bridge we end up\ncreating a shoe based on this we end up\ngoing to another another country visit\nyears later inspired by that and so i\nthink that\ntravel allowed us to change our point of\nview change our perspective when you're\nthinking of creativity a lot of times\nthere's things in your day-to-day life\nthat when you're thinking about\nrepetition you don't pay attention to it\nbecause it comes\nalmost a second nature it's reoccurring\nbut when you go to a new place\neverything is new you have to pay\nattention to your surroundings because\nit's uncomfortable not necessarily\nnegative way but in a positive way you\nget all of the stimulation through your\nsenses you're seeing things you're\nmeeting people and so\nwhen i when my mom pushed me out of my\ncomfort zone then it\ncompletely changed the way that i was\nviewing the world and it made it so that\ni was much more open to\nreceiving what the world had been just\npushing what i wanted to do or what the\nintention was and so i think like that\nmade it so um it's kind of like\ni don't know if you remember on the old\ncell phone signals when you would make\nit a call going out would be like an\narrow pushing like this but when\nsomeone's sending you a message it's\ngoing both ways and so that's kind of\nwhat that calibration did to how we\ndiscover creativity and now like\none of the things the greatest things\nthat inspires me is movement whether\nit's movement in cars movement on foot\nmovement in the air and so i think like\nmovement in general changing your\nsurroundings not necessarily going to\nanother country or another state but\neven going\nanywhere just discovering i think the\nopportunity for for movement that's\nreally where like the creativity came\nfor us and then again i think that\nif you can take an idea lean into it and\nsee like and speak to why this makes you\nfeel different you'll find inspiration\nin it and i think that for us like we\nhave we have an incredible team that\nfinds inspiration in different places\nand then we're able to talk about it and\nthe greatest thing you can do is be a\ngreat communicator because if you can\narticulate what your vision is and\nwhether that's through verbal whether\nit's through art whether it's through\nanything people will understand and\npeople will feel it not everybody will\nbut some people will and i think like\nthat's one of the things that's gone\nreally really far for us is that we've\nbeen able to take these\nuh inspirational things like our\nstreamlined shoe which is my favorite\none is inspired by japanese souffle\npancakes from when ryan and i were in\ntokyo and like ryan's obsessed with them\nand but we took that and we and we made\nit into a shoe and so it's like you\nnever know where the inspiration is\ngoing to come from but if you allow\nyourself to re receive it\nyou can get it and i think like that's\nsomething that a lot of people don't\nthink of they think they have to put it\nout there and push it but a lot of times\njust receiving what's around you will\ngive you a lot of inspiration into what\nyou should do i am so glad i asked you\nthat question i was about to not ask you\nthat question but i am so happy and even\nthough you're giving of course which is\nwonderful to hear the credit to your\nteam and your brother for being the cr\nyou know creative ones but the fact that\nyou've been able to observe that and see\nthat that's where it's come from and the\nexample from your mother too i i love\nthat adam adam you've just this has been\nphenomenal and i hope this is the first\nof many i mean i want you to i hope so\ntoo i want you to come back on the show\nregularly and give us updates as things\ncontinue to grow for you and apl and\nyour brother and uh as i said massive\nfan supporter uh getting to hang out\nwith you at a pumpkin patch was was\nthe weirdest place that i ever thought\nme and you would meet each other but it\nwas we had a great time because we just\nhad uh so much fun we just had a\npersonal growth self-development like\nyou know\ncomplete connection there but adam these\nare your final five you know the drill\nit's rapid fire i do one word to one\nsentence maximum you've you've heard\neveryone so you should have had enough\npractice by now uh but adam goldstein\nthese are your final five are you ready\ni'm excited awesome all right so the\nfirst question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever received i have to\nmix two because i i think it's important\nthe first is and they because they go\ntogether first is when i was a kid my\ndad would say if you touch it you can\ncatch it it was about sports but i think\nit's applicable to life which is if\nsomething's within your grasp you can\nget close enough you can make it yours\nand it is possible so you have to if\nit's if it's in your site you can make\nit yours the next\nthing that aligns with that is larry\nellison and again i heard this at the\nright moment in time said the larger the\napparent risk the fewer people that will\ntry to go there and so that's basically\nis\nis if it seems scary it seems risky but\nyou have the deep down belief\nfewer people will try to do it so you\nactually have a competitive advantage i\nheard that when ryan and i were thinking\nabout starting apo so that kind of was\nall i needed to hear and it pushed us\nover the edge yeah you know i love those\nanswers so much because\nyou know i i think about the things in\nmy life as well there are just\nlines that i live my life by and it's\nexactly what you're saying like\nit's not like you knew those people or\nit's not like you had like a 10 hour\nconversation with them it was just you\nheard someone say something that what\nyou said earlier so one of einstein's\nlines is if you can't explain something\nsimply you don't understand it well\nenough\nand that is what i live my life by i'm\nlike if i\ni can read as many books as i want but\nif i can't explain that idea\nwith simplicity then what's the point\nand that's kind of what i've built my\nlife around and then there's another\nbeautiful thought by martin luther king\nwhich is the people who love peace\nneed to learn to organize themselves as\nwell as those who love war\nand i love that because that's kind of\nwhy i get my you know i want to be\nempathetic compassionate loving kind but\ni want to accelerate in the most\nstrategic\nfocused driven way because\nyou can't just be this fluffy woo-woo\nkind of vibe because that doesn't make\nchange and so i those two and and those\nare not two that i have been familiar\nwith those thoughts\nand i'm that one about risk i mean\nthat's going to stay with me for a long\ntime so i really appreciate you sharing\nthat with me and i hope everyone who's\nlistening can realize that you don't\nneed to meet someone you don't need to\nyou don't even need to interview them if\nthat you know you you could literally\njust hear one line and it could change\nyour life so uh love those answers\nbeautiful answers all right adam second\nquestion uh what's the worst advice\nyou've ever heard or received it was\nactually around the time when i heard uh\nwhat larry ellison said about risk and\nit was\nwhen we were in school and ryan was in\nthe business program and somebody had\ntold them don't even try it and the idea\nwas\nlike you can't possibly do this because\nyou don't know how to do it but i think\nthat if you try something and you fail\nyou tried it you'll learn for the next\npart of the journey but if you never try\nit then you automatically fail and so i\nthink like that thing and again i know\nit's it's not as much of a nugget as the\nother ones but don't even try i think so\nmany of us hear that throughout our\nlives and it gets conditioned into us so\ni think flip that just try it like and\nbut don't even try it as the worst piece\nof advice that i've ever heard\nquestion number three top five rappers\nof all time\nbecause i know that this we didn't get\ninto this but i know that\ni i love rap music and hip-hop music too\ni grew up on it i know that it's a big\npart of your life so let's hear your top\nfive nipsey hustle\nrick ross\njay-z\nyoung jeezy\nand\nti\nnice good great list great list we\nliterally i literally just interviewed\nlauren london earlier today\nwho's a dear friend of mine and she was\nyou know married to nipsey so i mean\nit's\nlike not to not to get off topic but\nlike\na lot of nipsey's thoughts on\nentrepreneurship and i mean i had a few\ngreat conversations with him when he was\nalive but like the way that he looked at\nit was and we used to talk about it like\nit was so similar to the way that we\nthought about apl like in terms of\nbuilding something independently from\nthe ground up like i i s ryan and i\nspoke at harvard at the harvard business\nschool and one of the things that we\ntalked about and this was right before\nnipsey passed away\nwas he did this interview and he talked\nabout taking the stairs not the elevator\nand that's been paramount to our journey\nso i think like i've been a fan i was a\nfan of his when i was in college because\ni went to usc he's from south central so\nlike we were hearing it at when we're in\nthe locker room and everything like that\nbut just what nipsey did what his\nthought processes and entrepreneurship\nand just like building the people up\naround you if you build within your\ncommunity you can help so many other\npeople and if you start local you can\ntake it much further and just like not\nonly was incredibly talented but like he\nwas just like such a like he was a\nleader and he was a thought-provoking\nperson and he lived what he said and so\ni think like again like he was he was\nsuper super super inspirational in\naddition to being an incredible rapper i\nlove that man thank you for adding that\nno that you know that's that's beautiful\ninsight and\ni'm really glad again i asked that\nquestion because it led to uh led to an\neven deeper deeper takeaway all right\nquestion number four how would you\ndefine your current purpose in life i\nthink it's maximizing each day and\nstaying focused on the future so i think\nit's being able to enjoy the present but\nit's still being excited about the\nfuture like that that's really really\nimportant to me and i think that's what\ngives you energy to keep going forward\nis just enjoying today but being excited\nabout the future all right adam and\nfifth and final question\nwhat is something that you used to value\nbut you no longer value\nprobably nostalgia i mean i think that\num i get so excited about what i'm doing\ntoday where we're going in the future\nand i think i've done amazing things and\nwe've done incredible things but a lot\nof times\nwe live in the past and we don't and\nthat keeps us from enjoying the present\nand so i think that uh i can appreciate\nthe past but i definitely uh but i\ndefinitely love the president and i'm\nexcited about the future and i think\nthat that shift of perspective um has\nbeen something that's really been\nimportant to my journey and also just my\nhappiness as a person\nthat is such a good answer we've never\nhad that before and and i and i love\nthat answer because\ni couldn't agree with you more right you\nknow i always\nsaw individuals who\nlived as if their best years had already\ngone\nand that's such a hard way to live\nbecause life is so\nlonger than you think it is and so\nthat that is a beautiful answer everyone\nmake sure you follow adam across\nsocial media so you can connect make\nsure you follow apl across social media\nand i want you to make sure that you tag\nme and adam and apl and any insights\nthat you gained from this episode there\nare tons like i said i hope you're\nmaking notes second of all go listen to\nit again if you weren't making notes\nthird thing recognize that adam is a\ntrue\nmodern entrepreneur like it's highly\nstrategic it's highly focused there's\ncreativity there's spontaneity there are\nso many lessons to learn\nfrom this incredible human and adam i've\nhad so much fun today i've learned so\nmuch from you i think there have been\nmoments in this interview where you've\nsaid things that are going to stay with\nme for a very very long time and i\npersonally am going to make sure that i\napply them in my life so i want to thank\nyou for those gifts and i cannot wait to\ncontinue our friendship to continue to\nsee you succeed and win and continue to\nbuild and i'm excited to be a part of\nthe journey man thank you so much thank\nyou jay i mean i appreciate it and i\nthink like you've done so much to\ninspire so many people and i mean\nthere's a reason why you have the number\none health podcast in the world and it's\njust people can come here they can learn\na lot but they can be inspired and i\nthink like the greatest gift you can\ngive to someone is inspiration and then\nyou gotta leave it up to them to execute\nbut you've done a lot of amazing things\nfor so many people and i couldn't be\nhappier to be a part of it and again\nlike just becoming friends with you and\ngetting to know you over uh like in\nrecent times has been incredible so i'm\nhappy that we have this friendship i'm\nhappy i could be here today and i\nappreciate your support and obviously i\nhope that everybody listening to this\njust takes us as something that can help\npush them even if it's just one step\nforward just take something and and make\ntheir lives more enriching it definitely\nwill man it definitely will thank you\nadam thank you so much
