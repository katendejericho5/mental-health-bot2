    "transcript": "my best friend took his own life and i'd\nseen him two weeks earlier jay two weeks\nearlier and you know what i said this is\nthe saddest\nmost disappointing life experience\nlearning i've ever had he's going\nthrough his depression and i'm saying\njust be happy choose happiness i didn't\nunderstand mental illness i didn't\nunderstand depression i didn't\nunderstand what i was saying why i was\nsaying it\nand then he was gone and then i'm\nspeaking at his funeral\nand i fall apart\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten to learn and grow now you know\nthat i love reading books i love diving\ninto people's minds and stories but what\ni love especially is when someone had a\ndifferent career they had a different\njourney but they found a way to use\ntheir platform for a higher purpose\nusing their incredible talent their\nskills their gifts their lessons to have\nan impact in the world and today's guest\nsince i've had his book in my home even\nbefore i've met him has been doing just\nthat i'm speaking with none other than\nscott o'neill the author of this\nincredible new book called be where your\nfeet are seven principles to keep you\npresent grounded and thriving now i had\nthis book sent to me\nand even before i read it i read it now\nbut before i read it i would look at\nthis title every day\nand it became an affirmation it became a\nmantra it became a part of my life so\nwhen i picked this book up i was already\nexcited to dive in and today we get to\nsit down with scott who's here with me\nin the studio\nand scott i honestly have to tell you\nfrom the moment you walked in through\nthe door\nwith your friends that you've kindly\nbrought and introduced me to as well and\npeople you work with\ni felt nothing but presence\nintentionality\ngroundedness\nand it's beautiful to see that and how\naligned you are with what you've just\nwritten but thank you for being here\nwell jay i'm humbled first off and\nyou've taught me how to think like a\nmonk now i want to try to be like a monk\nand i hope i'm like that in this podcast\nthis is a dream come true you are truly\none of the great thought leaders of the\nworld and talking about using a platform\nyou're influencing people you're driving\nchange and you're helping us be more\ngrounded and more present so thank you\nfor all you do now thank you so much i\nhope your wife doesn't listen to this\npart of the podcast that monk thing the\nmonk thing i'm going to be massively in\ntrouble for it next thing you know\nyou're going to shave your head and\nleave leave home and that's that's\ndefinitely not that's why i think like a\nmonk don't live like one one of the\nstories you told that i just absolutely\nlove is when you were sent back on the\npath to find something new to me\nthat is a b way your feet are moment\nand i think you found a rock a stone or\nright and and you said and what i loved\nmost is you said and i placed it back\nthere for someone else to find it and i\njust thought man could you imagine if we\nspend our entire life\nbeing present so we can discover new\nthings i say put your phone down get\nyour head up\nand i'm not i'm far from perfect in fact\nbeing in the sports business you know\nwe've lost our fair share of games i\nhave a competitive issue and problem\nand i remember coming home one night and\nuh lisa's my wife's name\nand uh the sixers we were on we we um we\nfamously went through this thing called\nthe process trust the process where we\ntook the team down we lost more games\nover a three year span than any team in\nnba history\nand um\nfor an effort to now we're the number\none team in east so it for a purpose\npurposefully intentionally kind of\nhaving a long view of the world which i\nlike i like the sense of you know if you\nwant to go to the moon don't bring a\nladder type of mentality\nand i came home i was anxious i was\nupset i was frustrated we'd just been\nbooed off the court and i was stomping\naround the house like a child\nand my wife says hey uh you doing okay\ni said yeah i'm doing fine it's like no\nno what's going on here and i said well\ndid you see the game say yeah no i\nwatched the game did you see the fourth\nquarter it's like yes i saw the fourth\nquarter\ndid you hear us being booed she said\nscott i didn't even need to have the tv\non to hear those boos\nand i said right so i'm i'm a little\nfired up i'm a little frustrated and she\nraised her hand at me and says this\nis not gonna work\nit's not gonna work for me and it's not\ngonna work for the kids\nand i said well um\nshe said how good is your team i said\nhon you know we're not gonna win a lot\nof games she's like you need a new\nsystem you need a new process\nthis is a family and it really struck me\nit struck me like am i being present am\ni the dad i want to be am i the husband\ni want to be when i come home and how am\ni letting these outside forces impact\nand influence who i am and who i want to\nbe and how i want my energy to show up\nso i was talking to a friend of mine and\nhe said it's a great line he said i have\na worry tree\ni said what's a worry tree he said well\ni come home i put my hand on this tree\nright outside my house all my worries\nfloat up into the tree into the universe\nand i walk in my house and i said to him\ni don't have one of those trees\nthat's funny where do i get one right\nyeah\nand um but but i i did use that\nphilosophically\nwhen i'm in the car i go silent i don't\nlisten to music anymore i i try to find\nsome peace and silence if i'm frustrated\ni howl at the moon if i need an outlet i\ncall a friend but that time is my time\nto decompress because when i walk in\nthat house\ni want to be the best version of myself\ni love hearing that often what happens\nis i think we carry that from the car\ninto the home\nand then we expect someone at home to\ncarry it\nor like you experienced you were just\nlashing out in your own space and then\nyour wife or your kids are experiencing\nthat energy\nand it reminds me recently the first\nthing i thought about when you were\nsaying that is\nengland losing in the final of the euros\nand what was fascinating to me is that\nthe city of london\nlooked terrible even before the game\nso it wasn't even that we lost and then\neveryone chucked trash on the ground it\nwas like there was already trash on the\nground right and then it got worse and\nworse and worse\nand it's incredible how you know i've\nseen studies that show how like domestic\nabuse rises when england loses and even\nwhen they win and so you can see that\nthese issues that you're talking about\nfor you it was just the experience of\nyour wife noticing you feeling angry and\nstomping your fee but some of these\nthings can get quite extreme when we're\ndissatisfied and when we're disappointed\nwith our lives yeah no i think you're\nright it reminds me of a great story um\nin camden new jersey which is arguably\nthe most violent city in america and a\ngood friend of mine in 2012 was named\npolice chief named scott thompson\nincredible guy\nand he had a very different philosophy\non people and policing\nand\nhe would put all the police officers in\nthe back of a swat vehicle driving\naround drop one quarters he says hey if\nyou have to go to the bathroom you\nbetter get to know the neighbors\nif you're hungry i hope you know who's a\ngood cook on this block because i'm\npicking you up in 12 hours so good luck\nwhat he was saying was was\nwe have to be part of this community\npart of the fabric of the community\nand so the police officers started to\nget it they started to reclaim the\nstreets they started to roll back the\nopen air drug markets so instead of 50\nthere were now two so they're contained\nthey added infrastructure and i.t so\nthey could be smarter some great\ntechnology\nand then unfortunately a young teenager\nwas was killed by a stray bullet from\nsome gang nonsense\nand so they came in two in the morning\non a saturday morning or sunday morning\nand um all those lieutenants were saying\nthe same thing let's break out the swat\nlet's go get him let's do what we have\nto do and he says no\ni don't think that's the right answer\nand he said let's lock down let's go\ndoor to door let's find who did this\nand so he sent everybody home it's three\nin the morning and he walked over to a\n7-11 and got an ice cream\nimagine three in the morning\nand um he went back to his office\nand he went into there's a little safe\nwhere they keep money that they take\nwhen they arrest somebody\nand he ordered two ice cream trucks\nand the next day they drove from trucks\ntrucks the next day he drove these two\ntrucks on both ends of the street\nbecause people just retreating to their\nhouse when there's violence and he had\nthe police officers give out free ice\ncream for an entire day\nand to me that's\nand by the way crime is down 65\nmurder rate is down 48\nand so can you is it because of the ice\ncream no it's because his intention is\nto love people his intention is to have\nthe community have the citizens control\ntheir destiny yeah and get it back i\njust again the the notion of my wife if\ni pick up a phone and i'm talking to her\nsaying like\ni'll wait\nyou know do we have people in our lives\nthat will tell us the truth they love us\nenough to tell us the truth and give us\nfeedback so we can stay present if\nyou're a police chief in a really\ndangerous city how are you going to be\nlike how are you going to change the\nworld because\nthe reality is is like we keep throwing\nthe same\nsolutions at the same problems yeah and\nnothing's changing you said something\nreally important there you said that you\nknow we need to surround ourselves with\npeople who can be honest with us and\ntell us the truth but we also have to be\nable to receive that often a lot of us\nhave people in our lives that are honest\nwith us i'm sure there's many people's\nwives or husbands or partners or kids\nthat have looked them in the face and\nsaid\ni need you to think differently about\nyour life\nwhat have you done differently on the\nreceiving end of that feedback\nand how have you\nprocessed that feedback uniquely\nso that you don't retaliate with your\nego or your insecurity of like well you\ndon't know how how hard i'm working you\ndon't know how hard it is to run a team\nand do this and start you know start\nnoting down all your wins and all your\nachievements how do you do that without\nego i think that a common language helps\num in our house um if you walked into\nour house and you were leaving the back\ndoor you would see api zoom positive\nintent the letters api etched into stone\noutside of our house\nall of our daughters have api carved\ninto rocks sitting on their dressers\nand um and every truck we have\nchalkboards in our house it's a house of\ngirls and there's api written on every\nsingle one of them\nso that's assumed positive intent\nwe also use the term palms up meaning\nyou're literally your palms are up i'm\nopen to listening learning and loving\ni'm not closed off frustrated i don't\nknow everything i haven't solved every\nproblem\ni'm palms up and so if there's an issue\nif there's an issue in our house if\nthere's an issue at work an executive\nmight come and say scott because they\nknow i'm very emotional scott i need you\napi and i need your palms up and what\nthey're saying to me in their own way is\ni know you're emotional\ni know you're very competitive\ni know you're very driven i know you\nwant to quote unquote win\nbut what i need is i need your ideas\ni need your love i need your\nunderstanding and i need your solutions\nso come play with me and so that's\nhelped me the most kind of overcome my\nown human frailty of emotion and ego and\nall that other crap that doesn't allow\nus to be the best version of ourselves i\nlove that so you talk about it in the\nbook obviously api i thought that was\nbeautiful i'm going to start putting\nthat in my offices inspired by you and\nsharing that with everyone i me i i\nabsolutely loved that when i read about\nit and just for anyone who who missed it\nassume positive intent\ni think that is such an incredible way\nto live how did you learn to live that\nway i'm sure you've had experiences\nwhere you've assumed positive intent\npeople have taken advantage of you and\nor people came in with malicious intent\nor people came in how did you continue\nto practice that i think a lot of people\nwho are listening they'll be thinking\nright now\ni love that but too many people have\ntaken advantage of me sure how have you\ncontinued to do that throughout your\ncareer in family and professionally it's\nsuch a different way to go through life\ni always say when you have that one\nfinger pointing out you've got these\nthree pointing right back at you\nand i love to spend more time focusing\non the guy in the mirror we spent so\nmuch time blaming or assigning blame or\nlooking for excuses or finding 10\nreasons why i can't\nor this guy took advantage of me or this\nwoman was too nasty and how could i\nassume positive intent she was mean\nassumption has nothing to do with her\nattitude it has nothing to do with how\nmalicious she is this has all to do with\nme because i am in control i have the\nright intentions again i perfectly say\nthis i'm not i'm not perfectly perfect\nin this area of course yeah but in i'm\nleaving living my best self i'm giving\nyou the benefit of the doubt every time\nwhat's the alternative the alternative\nis is that jay you said something i\ndidn't like last week\nor i was in church and a woman was up\ntalking and she said something i didn't\nlike\nor my sister took my shirt or my teacher\ni got a bad grade on a test and so what\ndoes that do well well jay i don't want\nto talk to you next time i talk to you\nwhen you come in i'm walking out the\ndoor your boss sends you a text and\nimmediately your blood pressure rises\nthat is not a great way to any sort of\nsuccess it just isn't yeah um personally\nand how you go through the life and life\nis better you're happier\nyou're more grounded the interactions\nare better but we've all been uptight\nwith that one person right that one\nperson that gets your goat you know for\na teenage girl or mother\nlike your mother can say anything to\nhave three teenage daughters her mother\ncan say hey do you mind grabbing that uh\nthat sweatshirt off the cl off the\nstairs what mom because i'm a mess\nbecause i can't clean my room we're like\nno i just wanted you to grab the\nsweatshirt so no one trips on it yeah\ni've got an awful story about that i'm\ngonna share it it's completely on the\nedge okay please tell us so i haven't my\noldest daughter is alexa she's 21 years\nold\nand when she and she's wonderful when\nshe was a teenager she wasn't so\nwonderful she was always wonderful but\nnot wonderful with her mother\nand amazingly i have this wife who's\njust terrific\nshe is balanced and smart and driven and\nintellectually curious\nand tough and strong and she's just\nwonderful\nthose two together when my daughter was\na teenager she wasn't so wonderful okay\nso i would walk in the house and i'd be\nlike they would be arguing over nothing\nand i would say can you two just go away\njust separate like i knew two wonderful\npeople just boiling water and argued\nabout everything for nothing and so one\nparticular thanksgiving i've never told\nthis story publicly it's gonna be\nawesome i love it one particular\nthanksgiving my mom was there and my\nsister my sister's a single mom with her\nson and they're in the kitchen we're all\nmaking potatoes and all the stuffing and\nall this stuff\nand lisa sounds something like this\nalexa get downstairs and get your\nclothes off the stairs and i'm like\nlooking at her like i don't know i don't\nthink i've ever heard a razor voice this\nis gonna be awesome\nand alexis says mom\nwhat did you say i'm like oh boy here we\ngo now my mother is here\nso i kind of look at my mom like\ni love you sorry\nso they go back and forth get down here\nright now she goes you want me to come\nhere right now yes right there get down\nthese stairs right now mom i'm like\nshe walks down the stairs\nnot a single article of clothing on\ncompletely naked\nwalks down the stairs\npicks up the clothes looks my wife dead\nin the eye\nturns around and walks upstairs\nand the only thing my mother could\nmuster say is\nwell she is confident hon\nnow\nin that particular story nobody's\nassuming positive intent yeah except for\nmy mother yeah i'm not\nyou know i'm like lisa stop\nalexa just stop\nand they're not with each other and i\nwonder like how many interactions like\nthat do we have in our lives that we can\nchange and fix by worrying about us not\nthe people we're dealing with give them\nthe benefit of doubt clear your head\ngoing empty-headed and ready to engage\ninto conversations yeah thank you for\ntaking us there because i i'm so glad\nyou told that story\nbecause we always assume that we have\npositive intent\nso often we assume in any given scenario\ni've got good intentions everyone else\ni'm not so sure about but the example\nyou just told us no one had good no\nintent apart from your mother as you\nsaid and i can't see that as a dad just\nlike yes yeah i'll never see that and i\nlove that idea of when you think you're\nstopping someone you think that's a\npositive intention right but actually\nthere's something much deeper happening\nand one thing that you said that i was\nliterally talking about this morning\nwith a friend\nwas the idea of why we're so addicted to\nthe news and i was speaking about this\nwith someone else saying the reason\nwe're so addicted to the news is because\nit makes us believe the problem is out\nthere it makes us believe the problems\nover here the issues over here the\nchallenges over there that that place\nthat country they've got issues it stops\nyou from having to actually take a look\nat the person in the mirror as you said\nyes and it just keeps telling you\neverything's going on out there all the\nproblems all the enemies all the\nchallenges all out there and let's be\nscared of out there but you then never\nget a chance to say well what am i going\nto work on today you know what do i need\nto do such a great insight and i feel\nlike that with with my friends that live\nall over the world\nis if we had you know something\nhappening is it really dangerous there\ni'm like yeah no or i'd talk to a friend\nof jerusalem and i'll say\nis everything okay like\nyeah no there was a bombing it was last\nweek it was tuesday i you know\nyou know or my friends in china they're\nlike is it really bad they're like no\nit's actually wonderful here it's really\ninteresting yeah those snippets and news\nare impacting us and influencing us yeah\nand again i'm not saying don't want to\nnews be informed i'm just saying that\nthat mentality for sure of of what you\nwere saying getting lost in blame\ndiscontent yes feeling like the issues\nthere there are issues there of course\nthere are but as you're saying it's\nabout starting with us i wanted to tell\nyou a little bit i was telling you\nbefore that i was in mozambique which is\none of it's the third poorest country in\nthe world wow terrible um employment\nrates\nabject poverty i went over there with my\n17 year old daughter kiara to help build\na school this incredible organization\ncalled heffy he fy i don't have any\ndiscernible skills i can barely hold a\nhammer i am worthless around the house\num that makes me feel a lot better okay\ngood\nnothing yes\nmy wife's a million times better than\nit's really humbling um and my father my\nfather-in-law grew up you know building\nhouses so a bad story is not growing up\nanyway nonetheless i'm at this worksite\nconstruction site the foreman doesn't\nspeak english\nand i don't speak portuguese and neither\ndid any of the teenagers were with and\nso i volunteer for unskilled labor i'm\nthinking like that's the safest place\nput me in the cement mixing so i'm in\nthis little cement mixing area and just\nmixing cement i mean it's not hard but\nit's simple it's you know you\ncarry these 110 bag pound bags of cement\n100 yards you drop four for every two\nwheelbarrows of sand you put in and you\nmix water\nand i'm nine hours okay of doing this\ni'm thinking like\nthere's a lot of things going through my\nmind and i can barely sit still for 10\nminutes\nand it's hard work and i just kept\nthinking about the water and how that\nmight be reflective of of us\nbecause if you put too much water in the\ncement it men's worthless it just runs\naway and it becomes nothing\nand if you don't put enough water into\nthat cement it becomes hard\nalso worthless\nand i thought about that\nin relation to us\nit's like what are those things in our\nlives that we do too much of\nyou know the simple ones when you're\ntalking to teenagers are really simple\nit's like put your phone down stop at\nthe social media enough for the tick\ntock videos\num it might be\nand then\nwhat aren't we doing enough of\nare we spending time intentionally\nmeditating or praying or reading\nscriptures if that's something that you\ndo\nare you taking care of your body are you\ntaking care of your mind what are you\nlearning today\nare you practicing gratitude\num you know so i think like to me\ni had so many moments in mozambique\nin particular on the construction site\nwhere i was like\nhuh\nwhat\nwhat how analogous is this for life\nwhen i hear that it sounds like\nsometimes we have to get out of our own\ncomfort zones areas that we think we\nlearn get out the classroom almost like\nthat that seems like an amazing\nclassroom even though you didn't go\nthere for that lesson or you didn't sign\nup for that course or program but you\nwent there and that's the lesson you\ntook away\nwhat have you found over your whole\ncareer do you think you've learned more\nlessons\naway from\nclassrooms and i don't mean schools or\nuniversities or colleges i mean have you\nlearned some of the biggest life lessons\nwhen you're away from\nhome team or\nyou know home stadium i consider myself\na lifelong learner i love to walk\nthrough the world\nthinking about how i might grow or learn\nthat's how i where does that come from\nboy i grew up with\ntwo parents both phds\nuh we didn't have many means when we\nwere young um and they were\nentrepreneurs so i saw a lot of things i\nmean i was calling my parents became uh\nmanagement leadership team building type\nuh trainers for xerox and adp and texaco\nand big big companies around the world\neventually as i got older so i was\ncollating books i saw my mom\npresent when she was in i don't know i\nwas probably 12 years old\nto xerox all white men at the time\nthat's that was the the day and age in\nthe 80s\nand i see this little five foot two\nitalian woman\nand making them laugh and making him cry\nand making him think and pushing them\nand i just remember\njust wanting to be her\nand wanting to grow and be\ndifferent and interesting and interested\nand i mean i i was literally that was\nprobably the first moment in my life\nwhere i'm like okay\ni need to know more\num but i i do love i walk through the\nworld thinking about what i can learn\nwhat i've found is and i'd be interested\nin your insights in there i seem to\nlearn a lot more when i trip and fall\nyou know i ended up i wrote this book\nwhen my best friend took his own life\nlike he yeah he's my best friend i'd\nseen him two weeks earlier jay two weeks\nearlier and you know what i said this is\nthe saddest\nmost disappointing\num\nfrustrating life experience learning\ni've ever had\nis he's going through his depression and\ni'm saying\njust be happy choose happiness\nhey will you're going to be fine um go\nserve people but i'm sad i serve people\nlike i had no idea\ni had i didn't understand mental illness\ni didn't understand depression i didn't\nunderstand what i was saying why i was\nsaying it\nand then he was gone and then i'm\nspeaking at his funeral\nand i fall apart\num and i fall apart in a way that\nyou know i i couldn't get out of bed i\ncouldn't fall asleep or i couldn't get\nout of bed and then i'd be in a meeting\nat work and someone would say something\ncompletely unrelated i would burst into\ntears and walk out\nfor three months\ndidn't raise my hand no i need help\ndidn't raise my hand\nand i started to write to heal and what\ni started to write\nwas all around stories of where i\nslipped and fell and fell down and\nlearned\nand um and one of the things that i've\ncome to which i'm i'm interested in in\nbouncing off you and seeing where you're\nwhat your thoughts are but i m i have a\nformula for mental health\nand it's you do something for your mind\nsomething for your body is something for\nyour soul every day\nyou get the right amount of sleep\nyou practice gratitude\nand you be where your feet are meaning\nyou put your phone down and get your\nhead up\nnow something for your mind to me\nsounds simple but people don't do it\nbecause we're on the treadmill and all\nwe do is work or whatever we're doing\nwe're doing\nand you've got to have an interest\noutside of work you have to have a\npassion you have to be learning it\ndoesn't have to be complicated it can be\na ted talk\nit could be this podcast\nit could be an article but you've got to\nbe learning and stretching your mind in\ndifferent ways your body you have to\ntake care of yourself\nand i you know for me i it's pick up\nbasketball or a peloton if i can't get a\nrun in i'm on the peloton for 45 minutes\nand i'm not advocating for anything for\nanyone and if you haven't haven't worked\nout and you're more happy sitting on a\ncouch go for a walk for 20 minutes\nget the heart rate up a little bit\nand then the soul at work is easy to\ntalk about on your podcast harder at\nwork in work environments but you know\nyou have to feed your soul and for me\nthat's prayer and scriptures and going\nto church and having a strong faith and\ni know that doesn't work for everybody\nthat's okay but you need to find\nstillness and that stillness can be\nmeditation it can be yoga it can be\nsitting out and listening to the birds\nchirp in the morning\nand sleep is is the most misunderstood\nsuperpower you can ever have because\nwhen i was growing up in the business\nworld it was sleeps for the week\nmoney never sleeps\nyou need four hours get back to work and\nwhen i found him we've brought in sleep\nexperts with our athletes with the\nsixers and devils and they all say the\nsame thing you need sleep sleep lets the\nmind body and soul heal\nand so you need somewhere between six\nand a half and eight and a half hours\ndepending on what your dna is and your\nmakeup and your lifestyle\nand then gratitude\ni know you talk about gratitude but i\nwas when will passed away died\ntook his own life i wanted to move from\ngrief to gratitude but that was hard for\nme\nand it was the one thing that lifted me\nup every day\nand i have this practice\nand when i speak to corporate groups i\nalways tell them i start the session\nevery time and i say okay take your\nphones out because they think i'm gonna\nsay put your phones down i said nope get\nyour phones out i want you to text your\nmom\nand i want you to tell her that you love\nher\nwhy you appreciate her is something you\nlearned from her because when i did that\nto my mom going through my own healing\nprocess my mom said the worst thing you\ncould ever hear from your mother hun are\nyou okay\nand we need to be better and do better\nyeah but practicing gratitude so my\nchallenge is is\n60 seconds a day said the note of\ngratitude love or appreciation to\nsomeone in your life 60 seconds\nnot 60 minutes not 60 hours not 60\nmonths 60 seconds a day and then be\nwhere your feet are is put your phone\ndown and head up and we all need rules\nbecause we can't regulate yeah it's very\nhard now our rules like my teenage\ndaughters hate our rules\nbecause their phones aren't in the\nphones and electronic devices are not in\ntheir rooms yeah and they're not in the\nkitchen so no bedroom no kitchen for all\nof us\num we have regulations on how much\nsocial media they can actually watch i\nknow nobody wants to say it and do it\nand i wish they could regulate but you\nknow what i've been the victim of some\nreally tough criticism on twitter and\nreddit okay i've been attacked and come\nafter and and i consider myself very\nconfident\nvery self-assured\nstable and i fell apart a few times\nand i wonder like if that's happened to\nme what's happening to a 14 year old\ngirl yeah who's seeing her friends at a\nparty\non on um instagram that she's not\ninvited to she's falling apart she's not\nfeeling good about herself she's not\nfeeling good about her body she's\nfiguring out what she has to wear how\nshe wants to do it\nbut we have to set if if we can't\nregulate ourselves we need to put rules\nin i go out to dinner the other day what\nhappens\nmy friends are sitting at the table on\ntheir phones guys we haven't seen each\nother in here what are we doing put your\nphones in your car yeah and so i think\nit's going back to simple do something\nfor your mind something for your body\nsomething for your soul every day get\nsome sleep practice gratitude and be\nwhere your feet are i love that i i\ncompletely align with you the the thing\nthat i loved about what you were saying\nthat stood out to me which i appreciate\nis you calling out toxic positivity so i\nappreciate you calling out toxic\npositivity because\nyou saying that hey when will told me\nthat he was sad i just told him to be\nhappy\nwhen he was struggling with this i told\nhim well this is what i do why don't you\njust try it and i think that's such a\nvaluable conversation to have\nwhat were the conversations you learned\nafter you lost him that you felt you\nshould have been having with him or\ncould have been having with him\nand that our listeners could be having\nwith people because i think what's also\nhappened is that there are so many\npeople in our lives\nthat are now considered the drain\nor they're like oh god i don't want to\nsee them because they're a headache they\nalways drain me it's always about them\nbut you never know what someone's going\nthrough after my cement mixing days i\ngot quote unquote promoted\nto wheelbarrowing cement okay so now i'd\nhit the big time and the way you you you\nwheel cement and i'd done it as a 14\nyear old when i was digging pools is you\nyou know you get this heavy\nwheelbarrow and you just cruise it down\nthis little two by four and there's a\nhard left it goes up on the sidewalk you\nmove it down to the classroom or\nbuilding and two kids pick it up and you\nwheeled into the classroom pretty simple\nbut it's heavy\ni'm like a relatively fit guy now i'm a\nman when i was 14 i could barely you\nknow i could barely play but i was like\ni got this covered\nso the first time i get this wheelbarrow\nand i am cruising down a little faster\nthan i'd hoped down the slope and i go\nto make the left turn and i can't move\nit and i go right into the sand\nokay into the sand at speed or at speed\nyeah okay no no no cement comes out\nand now i'm moving it at probably like\nan inch every 10 seconds and i'm like\njust leaning in with my thigh just to\nkind of push it forward\nand these uh two teenaged girls one of\nwhich\nwas my daughter come and they're like\nhey scott you need help sure they pick\nit up put me back on this 2x4 and i'm on\nmy way okay that's my first trip\nso the lesson and how it relates to your\nquestion well one is is\nthat path to me that two by four that's\nlife\nand guess what\nlife's messy and life's hard\nand we think like we have this fairy\ntale when we're growing up\nwe have this vision of who we want to be\nand where we want to go and what we're\ngoing to accomplish and\nme i remember someone telling me uh\nevery ceo gets fired i was like i'm not\ngetting fired every startup guy goes\nbankrupt that's not gonna happen both\nhappen to me okay\nand so so i'm sitting in this sand and i\nget the offer to help\nand and you might say like\nhow humbling was that to have two\nteenage girls help you i was like no i\nhave a house of teenage girls i know how\nstrong they are i'm not smart they\ndidn't bother me at all they put me back\non but but i thought about that whole\nanalogy of like how hard it is to be on\nthat two by four and then i thought\nabout and and for me two by four is\ngoing through my six steps something for\nmyself for my body something for my soul\nsleep gratitude being where my feet are\nokay living the right way making the\nright decisions having high integrity\nserving others having true purpose and\ndeveloping people because we all have\nneed and i know you talk about this in\nyour book a lot it's like we all need\nour why our own personal why and so if\ni'm living that it's hard okay but you\nknow what's harder not living it that's\nthe irony that you don't think about\nyeah right because now i'm in the sand\nand the sand for me is sin or mistakes\nor\nbad decisions or not assuming positive\nintent we're not focusing on what's most\nimportant in my life that's the sand you\nknow what i needed just like will needed\ni just raised my hand hey guys\nladies can come help me here\nand um and when someone's suffering from\ndepression and really struggling they\nneed help i i'm not going to be able to\nhelp someone he needs to check into a\nfacility i use professional help yeah\nand medication and and he'd done that\nbefore and and i will you know that's\nsomething that\ni think about a lot quite frankly and\nthank you for sharing that and thank you\nfor\nwriting about in the book and creating\nthe book from that place because\nyou know it takes a lot of courage to\nsay that what you just said and what\nyou're sharing and even sharing all of\nthis based on a loss because\nthere's so much self-reflection that\ncomes with that and when you were saying\nthat journey from grief to gratitude\nwas you know the most difficult journey\nand obviously will continue to be\nin the book you also talk about\nhow to create presence and your four\nsteps for creating presence\nand i wanted to talk about them\nindividually because i find these to be\nreally\ndeeply\nprofound and insightful if we can really\nget if we can really go there let's try\nand so the first one's find perspective\nand i find like that is something as you\ntalk about in the book when you're\nmoving at 115 miles per hour\nwhen you've got all this going on\nfinding perspective is the thing that we\nnever do and if we do it we do it once\nmaybe for our new year's resolutions or\nmaybe on our birthday if you're lucky\nhow do you truly stop to find\nperspective what has helped you when\nyou've been at your busiest hectic most\nchaotic weeks days months and years for\nme it's it's coming home and\nthe humility of being a father helps a\nlot it really does changing a diaper\nhelps taking out the garbage helps i\nlove hearing going to grab groceries\nhelps but you know we all have those\nmoments in our life\nwhere we truly find persp where we truly\nfind humility and perspective and and um\ni don't mean to go back keep going back\nto mozambique but i'm going to it's like\ni'm in houses without any running water\nor electricity and i'm thinking and i'm\ni'm looking out over a work site and the\nkids are under a tree in the shade with\na blackboard and a teacher and i'm\nthinking like\nlife isn't fair yeah there's a story in\nthe book about uh dave schaller who's a\ndear friend\nwho um grew up in a trailer park and was\nmad\nyou know it's like why do why is this my\nlot in life his dad had some addiction\nissues and was at a shelter and they\nwere going to pick him up and he pulls\nup to the shelter and he remembers even\nat a young age he's got three younger\nsiblings\nand he's feeling mad not awkward not\nembarrassed mad\nand as his dad is walking down the\nstairs he looks to the left and there's\na woman with a blue duffel bag and she's\ngot three kids and instantly he finds\nperspective\nshe's got nowhere to go he's not a\ntrailer\nshe's gonna have a crappy astro van to\ntake me home\nand she's got no dad to pick up even\nwith all his issues\nthis is it for her and for him that was\nthat grounding moment for me quite\nfrankly my faith has given me so\nit's put my feet on the ground\nyou know the humility to get on your\nknees and\nbe prayerful and and humble and and\nunderstand kind of your role your\nyour place your\nthe\nthe dot you have in the universe\nand has really helped trips like\nmozambique i've had daughters one of my\noldest daughter the one\nthat i told you about about her episode\nshe's served in a syrian refugee camp in\nathens\nshe's been with orphans in zambia living\non a\ndirt floor you know i'm thinking like\ngood for these kids yeah our next gen\nour gen z's they're special they're\ndifferent and they're special and they\nthey have this incredible\nlight and life\nand\nsocial contract which is different for\nemployers and for all of us\num and i love how they're global\ncitizens and i love how they don't see\nthe world like we do it and i love how\ntheir expectation is that\nthat we do things differently and that\nwe help each other and that we serve one\nanother and that we love one another and\nthat's the expectation and if you don't\nif you're an employer and you don't do\nit they'll just leave yeah they don't\nhave cars no houses they don't care yeah\nthey don't know their jobs i love the\nway the world is going and i know a lot\nof people are\nthey're down they're down they've been\ndown in america or they're down in the\nworld or they're down in the next\ngeneration or it's not the same i don't\ni don't agree i i love this i love this\ncountry\num and i know we struggle but we\nstruggle out loud you know we struggle\nwith free press\nwe struggle with being better we\nstruggle with like meeting the ideals\nthat we have that are so unrealistic and\nso high and not attainable and we\nstruggle to get there i love that\nstruggle yeah\ni love the fight and i love that there\nare sides i wish we did it differently i\nwish we\ndidn't curate our own media so much and\ncreate all this friction i wish\nthat we had a vision for so for doing\nsomething better and being something\nbetter together\nbut i do i do i am grateful i am\ngrounded and i have perspective and a\nlot of that\num is intentional a lot of it's like\nwhere how are you spending your\nthanksgiving yeah you know how are you\nspending your summer vacations how are\nwe raising our children\nare we willing to learn from our\nchildren or we learn to listen to them\nthey know\nthey know how to treat each other so i\nthink they're a whole it's a whole host\nof questions and a complicated answer to\na really complicated question yeah no i\ni mean i asked the question because i\nthink\nas soon as you answered it it was really\nclear what your perspective is what your\nfocus is\nand you can go on instagram and find a\nvery different perspective\nor you could be following\nplaces of charity service work and you\ncould get that perspective too the thing\nis today you can go on youtube and\nsearch mozambique building schools and\nyou can find an incredible video about\nthe inspiring stories that are right\nthere you don't have to visit you don't\nhave to have the means to go over there\nand help to be a part of this and we\nfound that uh this year my wife and i\nled a covered relief for india that's\namazing because india was going through\njust so much we knew that one person was\ndying every five minutes the resources\nand the infrastructure didn't exist my\nwife and i are heritages from india my\nmonk life was spent in india so i feel a\ncertain level of responsibility towards\nindia and what i saw\nwas that everyone's perspective was\ndialed in like our social media\ncommunity\nraised five million dollars in one\nweekend\nand that to me\nshowed just how incredible\nthe perspective is when people are\ndialed in i know how amazing my\ncommunity is i love that and it showed\nme the power of when everyone's like oh\nsocial media does this and social media\ni'm like we couldn't have done this\nwithout social media right but your\nintention is pure and so is our\ncommunity and your community is pure and\nyou're and the love that\nyou show and have and the way you even\ncelebrate your listeners and who comment\nlike i that community is it's a jay\nshetty community i mean it's wonderful\nand full of love and i agree it's like\nwhen i say pick up your phone and text\nyour mom or text someone you love or i'm\ngoing to use my social media platform\nfor good that intention that like how\nyou set your day i'd love to talk about\nthat too it's like i'd be so interested\nin how you set your day every day i mean\nwe talk about doing it through through a\nleadership constitution yeah or a mantra\nbut they're\nlike i don't know i just invite i'd be\ninterested like do you say like do you\nread something do you say something how\ndo you how do you set your intention for\nthe day yeah it's changed over time and\nnow i always try and find a pattern\nbecause i like patterns and i like\nroutines and i like commitment\nand so it's changed over time at one\npoint this was truly one of my favorite\nmorning routines every day i would wake\nup\nand i would listen to steve jobs his\ncommencement speech at stanford and i\nlisten to it every day that's great and\ni listen to it every day for nine months\nand i promise you not only did i know\nthe words off by heart but the words\nlike started to really affect my heart\nto the point that i realized that all\nthe choices i made were all based on his\nvoice in my head now i didn't know steve\njobs i don't even know anyone who knows\nsteve jobs but i feel like i know him\nbecause i've spent so much time studying\nhis life and listening to him and and\nreading through his work so that that\nwas something i did i don't do that\nanymore but that was something i did\nrecently we had matthew mcconaughey on\nthe podcast and i told him that at one\npoint i listened to his speech from the\noscars when he won for\ndallas buyers club i think that was the\nmovie you want for and it's a five\nminute speech and it says oscar's\nacceptance speech it's rooted in faith\nand god and and and growth it's\nbeautiful and i listen to it every day\nfor 30 days and that was my thing that i\ndid first thing in the morning so those\nhave been certain things that i really\nlike that are practical for people\nwithout learning a new habit or learning\na new skill or learning how to meditate\nbut the\nprimary focus of my schedule now is when\ni wake up the first thing i do\nis i have a small post-it note on the\nside of my bed and it says what am i\ngrateful for and so that's the first\nthing i see that's great and so the\nreason i do that is because so often my\nfirst thought when i wake up is i'm\ntired\nah right that's so it's such a natural\nautopilot thought\noh let me look at my schedule oh my gosh\ngot so much to do today right like\nthat's such a\nnormal thought and i've read so many\nstudies about choosing our thoughts and\nmy belief is if that the first choice i\nmake in the morning is to choose a\ngrateful thought\nand that will transform every choice i\nmake for the rest of the day if you\nchoose to love your child the first\nthing in the morning you're more likely\nto love them throughout the day if you\nchoose to plant a beautiful seed it's\nmore likely to grow into a tree and a\nfruit by the evening so for me that's\nbeen the first thing i do straight after\nthat i go to my meditation practice\nwhich has always been montreal\nmeditation for many many years and i've\ndeveloped this i don't recommend this to\nanyone i\nmeditate for about one and a half hours\nto two hours every morning it's the\nfirst thing i do\nand for me that's my connection to god\nit's my spiritual connection it's my\nfaith connection\nit's me learning to be an instrument to\npurify all of the\nimpurities and issues that i have so\nthat i can actually be a vessel of\nservice and so that's what that does for\nme\nand then it's very similar to what you\nsaid mind body straight after that i'm\nout playing tennis so tennis has been my\nexercise\nuh consistently now for maybe the last\nyear\nand i started to realize i didn't enjoy\ngyms but i love sport i love competition\ni love play and there was a beautiful\nquote from richard branson that stuck\nwith my head and i probably read this\nwhen i was 16\ni remember reading his books when i in\nmy teens and i i read this when i was 16\nand it's funny because now obviously i'm\nnot old but i'm older than i was when i\nwas 16. and he said we don't stop\nplaying because we get old we get old\nbecause we stopped playing\nand that's what drew me to town\ni was like i need to add more play into\nmy life and then uh straight after that\ni'll sit down and set an intention for\nthe day\nso i'll look at my schedule\nand i'll think what energy do i need so\ntoday i've got a day of interviews i'm\nsitting with people\nsome people have met some people i\nhaven't met and so my intention is how\ncan i truly serve this person the best\nso that they can serve humanity through\nwhat we're doing\nand so now when i'm sitting here with\nyou all i'm thinking about is just i\ncannot wait for everyone listening to\nread this book\nnot only are you a great author you're a\nphenomenal storyteller i'm sitting on\nthis podcast going scott i had no idea\nyou were this good a storyteller and and\ni'm loving it i'm enjoying that because\ni'm appreciating just how much people\nare going to be moved when they finally\nget to dive into your work\nand so\nthat's that's my\ngeneral morning routine every day that i\nfollow and that that works for me i love\nthat i would love to tell you my\nyoungest daughter eliza who's 14. um\nevery night before she's gone to bed now\nthis is a four-year practice every day\nhas not missed a day\nshe writes down 14 things i have no idea\nwhy it's 14. that's she's 14 years old\nshe is okay that she's grateful for\nevery day okay that's allah has never\nrepeated once\nnever incredible so now think about what\nthat says to you for the next day\nbecause now you have to be in tune as to\nwhat you're being grateful for much like\nyou do in the morning i like it better\nin the morning like you do but i love\nthe notion of that the other thing she\ndoes\nwhich is i think it's the cutest she'll\nbe embarrassed if i ever say this i'm\ngonna say it but it's the cutest she has\na happiness clicker happy thoughts\nclicker so if you go by her room at\nnight you'll hear click click click\nclick click click click and it just\nwarms my heart to hear someone who's\nactually having happy thoughts and\nrewarding herself for the happy thoughts\nis that beautiful scott i think we have\nthe wrong person on the podcast\nshe sounds amazing\nthose are by far two of my fa you have\njust there's there's two things that\nyou've just shared and i can't what's\nher name eliza eliza okay eliza when you\nlisten to this if you ever do if you\nwatch this i just want you to know you\nhave taught me something two incredible\nlessons today that i'm gonna share with\nso many people i'm gonna quote you on it\ni'm going to put it out there because\nyou've blown my mind first of all i love\nthat piece of advice that she has never\nrepeated one\nthat is incredible\nthat's amazing that is so easy because\nyou remember at first you're like mom\ndad my house my school yeah just right\nthe first oxygen first month right like\nyeah that's but to not repeat right\nthat's amazing it's like this beautiful\nsorry i saw that now you're actually\ndigging and looking yeah i love that i\nlove that and then the second one that\nyou said so don't repeat your gratitude\ni think that is such a beautiful message\nand the reason why i love the happiness\nclicker is because i was i was literally\nquoting a study yesterday\nthe study on our thoughts shows that we\nhave 60 to 80 000 thoughts per day\nand 80 are not only repetitive but\nnegative\nand so the fact that your daughter is\ncounting her positive thoughts and we\nboth know i mean you know better than\nanyone if you don't measure something\nit's not going to grow it's not going to\nchange the fact that she is counting her\npositive thoughts that gives her a tally\nto try and live up to the next day and\ngrow i love that i love that too that is\ngenius i've it's funny i was actually\nthinking about it i wanted to\ni was speaking to someone about this a\nfew months ago and that's why i love\nthat so much i was talking to someone\nabout how\nmeasuring how many steps they took\nchange their lives right like whether\nyou use a fitbit or an aura ring or\nwhatever you use\nuh the idea is that measuring that you\ndid your ten thousand steps and i saw\nfamilies getting into these league\ntables with each other and kids and\nfamilies competing\nand i literally said this to a very\nclose friend of mine who we've had on\nthe podcast as well and i said to him i\nsaid how cool would it be\nif you could measure someone's positive\nthought ah that would be so like if we\nhad a device that could track your\nthoughts and could say to you every day\nyou're three thousand thoughts away from\nhaving ten thousand positive thoughts\nright and you could\nmeasure someone's positivity\nthat would engage them to like no one\nwants to have ten thousand steps we just\ndo it when we know we're eight thousand\nyou're like alright two thousand more i\ncan do that but i wonder if we could\nyou know i have this notion that\nnegative self-talk yeah um especially\nagain i'm with a lot of teenagers yes\nyes they they say things um\nand i had this notion that when you say\nsomething it's not how you intuitively\nthink you say it and it goes into your\nsubconscious yeah\nand um you know i'm a product of you\nknow two phds hippie hippie parents\nand they were all about you know\npositive affirmations yes you know we\ngot away from that you know the last few\nyears but but and we replace it with a\nmantra or a leadership um constitution i\nlove positive affirmations right yeah\nbut like i wonder if those positive\nthoughts is something that we can be\nsaying in the morning yes like get them\nout there because it'll make you happier\nyes it'll make the world better it'll\nmake your interactions better it'll help\nyou assume positive intent it will help\nyou focus on what's most important do\nall those positive things that we need\nyeah you know and like writing them down\nis good saying that matters yes yes\neliza you have uh\ni i'm never gonna forget those two\nstatements i'm gonna be sharing them a\nlot with people they're so powerful\nthey're so powerful and there's so much\nwisdom in that and that's writing down\nwhat you're grateful for is such an\noverused tip and it's great and that's\nwhy i love what you said share it\nexpress it that 60 second text to your\nmom like that's where it starts working\nbut it also works when it's not\nrepetitive so i think that's that's\nincredible thank you so much eliza uh\nthe the second step is seek authentic\nfeedback\nthis one i\ni think is become more and more\ndifficult for people to do because\nseeking authentic feedback\nmeans you have authentic relationships\nyes because you can only seek authentic\nfeedback from people you genuinely have\na relationship with or that understand\nyou tell us about your journey to\ntell me about a time when you sought\nauthentic feedback\nand examples of both types of feedback\nyou received inauthentic or authentic\nyou know what happens in a career is\nhard\nwhen you're young you have mentors\nand then you start hopping over your\nmentors\nand\nyes\nand then you get a big job\nand even the people that you love the\nmost and have worked with side by side\nfor three companies or two companies or\nthose that you've groomed since their\nearly days and they're now your direct\nreports and\nthey're not going to tell you the\ntruth and then you're bored in my case\nor your boss is\nthey're not going to tell you the truth\nanyway and you're not sure you want it\nyou know\nand so so that becomes really\ncomplicated\num i've found a couple places that are\nyou know solid there's a group called\nypo young presidents organizations\nwhich puts you in a room with\neight to ten other ceos\nand you have what they call form\nconfidential meetings where nothing\ncomes out\nand you talk about things that you can't\nreally talk about you know\nissues at home troubles with a child\ntroubles at work\nnegotiating a contract not like who are\nyou going to call\nso that that was an incredible source of\nstrength for me for the last 15 years uh\nmy forum at ypo so that's one group\nwhere\nthey they love me they don't judge me\nthey're honest\nthey're strong\nthey're my peers so i think that formula\nwhether it's ypo or some other group of\nyour peers is good\nmy brothers are incredible sources of\nstrength and my sister my three brothers\nand sister all running companies but\nthey love me too much\nyou know and they'll always take my side\nalways my wife not so much\nand\nand she loves me but she'll tell me yeah\nyou know and and i imagine for you for\nyour wife she sees jay shetty\nokay jay said jay do your laundry yeah\nokay\nyou know and and and there's a\npartnership that is critical and that um\ni'm sure your wife is strong or you\nwouldn't you know my wife is strong and\ni needed a strong woman um\nand so and we have complete division of\nlabor and you know but there is an\nexpectation that when when i need it she\ngives it to me whether i ask for it or\nnot which i absolutely love\ni'm a little more delicate just in terms\nof style with her yeah i see it a lot\nnicer yeah um i think i do the same yeah\nthat's a good tactic 25 years yeah uh\ntogether that's good it's working it's\nworking um and she's been amazing so so\nthose are my two sources um ypo and then\nand then my wife i love those those are\ngreat how about you how does it work for\nyou so is it hard because you're a\ncelebrity and star like is that like so\ndifferent you know what i'm really\nfortunate and and i made this a\nconscious\nlike intention as as my life grew is\nthat i'm always\nthe poorest least successful and least\nwise but you know least wise person in\nthe room\nuh and so i try and surround myself by\npeople who are far ahead of me in every\nway i possibly can and they're not\nalways the same rooms right because you\ndon't necessarily find people across all\nthree of those in the same room you\nmight be getting harder on all three\nfronts for you\ndefinitely those rooms are getting\nsmaller no no definitely not not as\nsmall i feel like i feel like the higher\nyou go you realize how big the world is\nbig people's visions are uh when i when\ni want the wise i go to the monks i was\ni was just talking to about this the\nother day i shared this with randy\nactually and uh i was saying that i was\ncoaching\nuh i was working with someone recently\nand i was speaking to my monk teacher\nabout who i was working with so my mom\nteaches 70 years old he's been a monk\nfor 40 years he's lived life he's like\ngot every life experience he's coached\nchildren since they're born to go on to\nbecome incredible people he's coached\nyou know heads of societies and states\nand you know he's\nhe's had an amazing\nlife\nand so when i go to him and he's 70\nyears old and you know i'm half his age\nand you know it's you you start\nrecognizing just how much more there is\nto life and how much you still have to\nlearn and live and i was telling him i'm\ncoaching this person on this and i'm\nworking with this celebrity on this or\nwhatever it is and he goes he said to me\nsaid he said i'm so happy for you\nbecause i'm so happy he said i'm so\nhappy because you get to help everyone\nwith your problems and it was like that\nhumbling reminder\ni was like you're getting to coach\npeople on what you need coaching for and\nthat is god's gift to you that you're\ngetting\nto help people with what you're going to\nneed help with and so i think you know\nthat wisdom that i get from these the\nmonk teachers that i have that i still\nam very much in touch with uh they're\nalways very humbling and grounding and i\nthink my sister you were saying family\nso my sister\nwhat you were saying my sister whenever\ni start speaking to her she'll be like\nstop going all j shetty on me like\nshe'll literally say that it's amazing\nand my sister loves me and i love her\nshe's one of my best friends she's four\nand a half years younger than me\nstop giving me a j shetty video like i\njust want my brother like and i'm like\nthis is me like but she has to say that\nto me in it you know in the beginning it\nused to hurt me now i find it cute and\nand adorable and then my wife your spot\non like there was an interview that\nrobert downey jr did and he talked about\nhow\nthey were like how do you stay humble\nyou're iron man you built the marvel\nuniverse i mean this guy's you know he's\ncrushed it over the last few years with\nall the amazing movies he did and he\njust said he said you know what when i\nget home you know my kids are not like\noh my god it's iron man you know\nhe was like my wife's like take the\ntrash out and he was just like what you\nsaid same thing like\nyou know your family and i think that's\na beautiful thing i think often\nthis is what i'm sharing with a lot of\nmy male friends i said especially as men\ni think often we want our wives to\nvalidate us\nfor what we achieve and not who we are\nright and we forget that they chose my\nwife has been with me since i didn't\nhave a job you know and so\nmy wife\nmy wife's parents took way better care\nthan i did of her in the first\nthree years of our marriage and what i\ncould offer her was far less than what\nher parents could offer her but i think\nwe forget that is we want to be\nvalidated for like being that singer or\nthat athlete or being a speaker or like\ncan't you see i'm a number one new york\ntimes best like but dad you don't want\nto be loved for that no you're so right\nyou know what i was thinking of that you\nsaid that i thought was really\ninteresting and i forgot to mention i've\nhad three great coaches i'm tristan\nadolf and spencer holt and then brendan\nbroussard most recently and i didn't\nrealize you worked with yeah just with\nhim too you're kidding me i didn't\nrealize that we were lit so brendan just\nwe're all part of the same mastermind\nand we just literally were with brendan\noh that's it for four days i love\nfriends he is he helped me rediscover\nwhat it meant to be a leader again wow\nand i think that's the gift that coaches\ncan give you and they they he\nhe does not\ndance around issues either so he gave me\nsome incredible feedback over time but\nhelped me get there on my own which i\nloved like we had so many fascinating\nconversations and he's been a being a\ntrue\nrecent source of strength amazing i love\nhearing that please tell me about the\nfirst two because i got excited about\nbrandon trisha um is amazing she\nis a little bit like bohemian\nand i was at madison square garden and\nstruggling with all sorts of things\npersonally professionally\nand she had this big notion of like\nyou want to be a warrior i'm like yes i\nwant to be no she's like no no scott\nscott scott sit down i'm like no no i do\nwant to be she's like no you want a\nhunting kill i'm like right\nand she's like no you need to grow you\nneed to go into that sage phase i'm like\nbut i don't want to be a sage you know\nnow i was 38 okay\nand she said well you're gonna have to\nget there because if you want to lead an\nelite level the reward isn't you anymore\nyeah\nand that's where i am you know i i told\nher i i sent her\nnotes every once in a while that i found\nit you know and she always sends me\nfunny ones back but i\ni now get my my joy my win is seeing\nsomeone become a vice president for the\nfirst time or\nleave me and go run\nan incredible company and be an\nextraordinary leader or you know someone\nthat goes and can change the world in\ntheir world or you know someone who\nleaves me and goes and builds this\nincredible foundation and is changing\nthings in the world that is now\nmy killer my win so i think she i hope\nshe would say she's proud that i just\ndidn't go in her pace yes but that\nalways stuck in my mind and and i had\nsome classic fight back and arguments\nand pushback\nwith her and she she i remember her\nsaying scott you need to meditate in\nlike the sweetest smartest tough woman\nand i'm like\ni can't sit still for five seconds stop\ntelling me to meditate help me with my\njob you know\nand uh and of course i learned how to\nmeditate over time because i need to\nfind stillness and peace and it helps me\nsleep it helps me go to sleep it helps\nme live better and so she was a\nwonderful source and spencer whole who's\nbeen long time friend as well great guy\nsmart guy\nand um and he helped me on two\ntransitions and i think i think\ntransitions are hard for people\num you know i've been out of work out of\nluck and out of money and i've been out\nof work and really comfortable and i\nlike the latter a lot better than the\nformer of course but when you go on\nthese walkabouts in life\nyou have an opportunity to step back\nsee the world for what it is\nreflect back on the decisions you made\nwhy you made them the impact they had\ngood and bad the lessons you learned the\npeople you met and you just had this\noverwhelming sense of gratitude yeah for\nlife even the mistakes you made because\nthey taught you such valuable lessons\nand then you get to take all that in and\nlook forward and say\nwhy am i doing it it's actually my wife\nsays like scott why do you do this\nbecause every time i leave a job i'm\nlike i'm never doing this again you know\nevery time and she's like okay but why\ndo you do what you do i said well i want\nto help\ni want to help develop the next\ngeneration of great leaders yeah and i\nwant to build a platform so i can leave\nthe world better than i found it\nand\nand i want to help my church quite\nfrankly grow and so and she's like well\nthat's why you're in these platforms i'm\nlike yes that's why i'm in these\nplatforms and so that's why i keep\nsigning up you know and i keep getting\nthe rush and going through the pain and\nthe fun and the exhilaration and the\ntorture and all that together\nbut it's these walkabouts\nthese years like the year that you take\noff that really gives you that freedom\nthat most people don't have in life and\ni know i'm blessed to have that\nopportunity to go do it\num but that that's the time i'm in now\nand i i feel like i'm fresh and\ndifferent and\nin a in my version of a zen state\nthat i can actually see the world as it\nis i love that i love dan while you were\nsharing that\nthe thing i was thinking about was when\nyou look at the sage versus the original\nmindset as you as you put it in the\nwarrior warrior yeah the warrior\nand it's it's like that hunt and kill\nchanges to seek and grow yes that's\nbetter better and seek and grow\ndoesn't sound attractive like when you\nwant to be a warrior right like when you\nwant to be a warrior seek and grow it's\nlike a much rather hunt and kill but we\nrealize hunt and kill if you even look\nat those words they all lead to an end\nterrible they're aggressive but when you\nwere when you went to to become a monk\nat first like what i was surprised when\ni was reading reading think like a monk\nwas that you had a struggle because\ni know people see you as like you know\nit's like your sister's coming don't jay\nshetty on me like okay i have it all\nfigured out like i i do this i coach the\nstars i you know have this incredible\ninfluence on podcasts like\nis that something you anticipated and\nexpected or did that surprise you when\nyou were there and went through that\nstruggle\nmy whole life is a surprise to me i'd\nsay everything's been a surprise i never\nthought i would become a monk if someone\ntold me\ntwo years ago before i became a monk no\nnot two years ago but if someone told me\n18 i decided 21 22 i became a monk so if\nif someone told me it's 16\njay one day you're going to be a monk i\nwould have\nprobably thrown a bottle of alcohol at\nthem like you know like that's that's\nthe state i would have been in because\nthat's\nhow i was at 16.\nand then when i became a monk it was\nhard because\nliving with that level of discipline\nisn't easy for anyone especially just an\naverage kid from london who's not grown\nup with that level of military style\ndiscipline which is what a monastery is\nand then to leave it all to come back i\nmean i thought my life was over then\nwhen i came back i was just like well\nthat's it i guess i guess i'm just going\nto figure out how to pay the bills and\nlife's going to go on because all the\nfeedback i had from everyone was just\nlike who cares that you were a monk and\nwhat's that got to do with anything and\nwhat transferable skills do you have you\ncan sit still and be silent like our\ncompany doesn't need that and so\nit was it was fear and insecurity and\ndoubt at every step and so today when i\nget to do all the cool stuff you said\ni'm just feel blessed every day and\ngrateful and of course there's been\nstrategy and there's been thought of\ncourse of course there has but i'm\nsaying that the initial seed of that but\nwhen you were a monk yes\nand you're like\nyou know they said like no you need to\ndo x and you're like it felt like when i\nwas reading your book like sometimes you\nrolled your eyes like oh yeah again i\ndid i did because but that's your\nversion of the warrior phase right yes\nyes and i think i still have that and\nthat's partly why i had to leave and\nwhat i've realized is that some of us\ndon't have it naturally and some of us\nhave to engage it for a higher purpose\nto purify it oh that's that's so not\neveryone can just give up the rep like\ni'd say the rebel is very much part of\nmy dna i have that some of that yeah i'm\na rebel like even more than a warrior\ni'm a rebel like warrior still feels\nlike you want to\ni never wanted to beat anyone else i'm\njust a rebel i don't like going with the\nflow and i want to go against the grain\nand i think i know how to do things\ndifferently\nbut that doesn't make me better or worse\nthan anyone i've just i've always seen\nit as me but i realized that i had to\nengage the rebel in the service of\nhumanity\nto purify the rebel to try and aspire to\nbe a sage whereas if you try and\nwhat was often called in the monk\nsociety as monkey renunciation\nso what that means is monkey detachment\nis if you offer a monkey a banana it\nwill give you whatever it has\nand then if you offer it a credit card\nit will trade you back the banana and if\nyou give it so the monkey will keep\nswapping with you because it doesn't\nreally know what it wants and it doesn't\nmatter it will just give it up without\nthinking about it and as humans\nsometimes we feel forced to give up who\nwe are as opposed to saying well let me\nengage this and use my skills to help\npeople like it's like you saying all\nright i'm just going to go off and\nbecome a monk at 38 instead of building\nwhat you've built and now getting to\nhave the impact through your book your\nwork the mozambique work that you get to\nhave that's right that's your journey uh\nyou know when i sit down with\nthere were teachers like there were\nthere was a point where the beatles they\nwere members of the beatles that wanted\nto become monks\nand their teachers told them your\njourney is to make spiritual music\nlike your identity is to share the\nmessage of god through your music your\nmess your your destiny is not to become\na monk you're going to rob millions of\npeople right of the impact that you\ncould have and that's the same with you\nright if you traded it\nright does that make sense yes yes so so\ni think they said so for me it's been\nthat journey of purifying my impurities\nby giving them in service or trying to\nuse them for something better than\nyesterday\nso that's always been the philosophy of\nthe\nof the monkhood that i studied in which\nwas don't force people to change who\nthey are and become someone they're not\nget them to use who they are for helping\nand serving others and the world will\nbecome a special place all right so\nthere's this concept in the book called\nwmi what's yes i love it yeah let's talk\nabout it and brendan says that\nit's brendan breschardt he says that\nhigh performers spend 65 percent of\ntheir time on the three things that\nmatter most at work yeah okay so i\nbroaden that a little bit and i say like\nwork yes we should talk about work but\nwhat about\nyour home like what matters most to you\nat home what about your relationships\nwhat are those three key relationships\nand then at work what are those three\nthings that matter\nand i went through the audit okay so so\ni love the audience oh it's so painful\nokay so you go to you take your calendar\nand then you map okay where am i\nspending my time and the reason i add\nthe personal stuff is because\nespecially with coven the line between\nwork and home and home and work work\nhome in church or work home and play\nit's all the same totally it's just like\nlife and so we have to be more\ndisciplined we have to be more organized\nand we have to learn the magic word of\nno which is very hard for me because i'm\na people pleaser\nbut i go through my audit and i'm at 23\nand i was embarrassed to tell them like\ni didn't i just buried it\num but but then i just asked myself like\ni said like okay i got a choice 23 at\nhome no 23 of my calendar was spent on\nwhat i said\nit was 65 which is what he said yeah\nokay that's not great i literally i'm\nlike talking to myself and i'm saying\nokay i need you to change what's on this\npaper or change the way i do do so my\nquestion for you is is\nhow do you\nwith all the demands on your time and\npulls because i imagine you could speak\nanywhere you want to whenever you want\nyou probably get 30 calls a week to go\nspeak somewhere you got probably you\ncould do tv you could do a whole bunch\nof things how do you focus on what's\nmost important to you i fail all the\ntime\nthat's the honest answer it's so hard\nit's it's uh\nyeah it's so hard isn't it it's i agree\nwith you it's so hard to say no because\ni feel like there's so many transitions\nso\nlet's talk about those transitions and\nwhy it's hard to say no because i think\neveryone can relate to yes\nand you can why don't we do one each you\ntell me why you think it's hard to say\nno and i'll tell you why i think it's\nhard to say no so i'll start and then\nwe'll go back and forth i think one of\nthe reasons why it's hard to say no\nis because at one point in time that\nwould have been something you died for\nsome of the opportunities i have today\nthat come my way that i have the\nnow the opportunity to say no to at one\npoint in time i would have begged to\nhave had that opportunity so you feel a\nsense of guilt you feel a sense of\nresponsibility you feel a sense of\nam i ungrateful am i now becoming you\nknow do i think i'm too good for my like\ni think i go through that yeah does that\nmake sense that's an internal struggle i\nwould say one for me is that i\nfeel like\ni can help\npeople\nand and for me to not help\nit feels like a tug on everything that i\nsay i stand for yes and so what's simple\nfor me might be really hard for somebody\nyes and so to say no\nit's it's counter to what i who i aspire\nto be yeah yeah i love that i love that\none and i think a lot of people can\nrelate to that i can definitely relate\nto that i feel like i'm like it's only\n10 minutes of my time i can't make a\ndifference to someone it's worth it\nanother reason why i struggle to say no\ni'd say is apart from your one which i\nagree with too\nit's another reason internal struggle of\nwhy i struggle to say no is because i do\nwant to be liked i was that was my\nmother makes me happier like it's the\nsame thing but\nbut like i you do want to be like yeah\nyou want you you know and i have to\nmonitor this and that's what i'm saying\nthe reason why i'm i'm sharing these\nwith everyone listening is because\nif you haven't articulated them it means\nyou're not aware of them right and so if\nyou haven't put it down on a piece of\npaper and you haven't written down why\nyou struggle to say no you don't know\nwhy you don't say it right so i\nliterally said\ni just finally said like\ni'm gonna eliminate inter informational\ninterviews yeah okay now it's like the\nkid that comes in it's your friend's son\nor your nephew or the cousin of\nso-and-so and and i just don't i said no\nyeah\nand for me can you imagine like your\nbest friend calls you is like\nit's my son yeah no i'll get him to\nsomebody like yeah can't you spend 10\nminutes and i'm like nah i can't yeah\nand that to me was like awful it's awful\nlike the feeling is\nyeah and so now on my walkabout like my\nconstraint is no longer time which i'm\nsure for you is impossible right now but\nyour constraint is time yeah\nand mine is\ni was constantly trying to outsource the\nonly thing i was able to do\nand\nthat was something that i probably spent\ntoo much money on in 12 months on where\ni was constantly trying to hire\nfor what is my superpower and i was\nhoping that i could find someone to do\nthat so i could do more superpower stuff\nright but i kept trying to find someone\ni kept hiring someone and no matter how\nmuch i paid and where we looked and\nwhatever we did i realized it wasn't\npossible to outsource that specific\nskill and i finally owned it and i said\nwell i need to do that for myself so i\nactually didn't make a lot of mistakes\non that but going back to your question\ni see as the three most important things\nbut i see them in order so\ni like that yeah chronological correct\npriority okay so we had a set of rules\nin the monastery which i still\ncompletely connect with and the three\nwords uh one of a couple of them are\nsanskrit one of them's english but it\nwas health\nsadhana savor these were three words and\nit was always in that order so it was\nconsidered these are the three most\nimportant things\nand the good thing is you can't do one\nbefore you finish the other one\nthat that's that's great\nand so the rule is health is first and\nthat includes your physical and mental\nand spiritual health and you give\nbeautiful examples of how to do that so\nbefore you have moved in the morning you\ncan't do any of the others so if you\nhaven't done your yoga you haven't done\nyour tennis you haven't done your\nworkout whatever it is you can't do\nanything else you're just not allowed\nright\nbecause without you being of health\nwithout you being of everything you\nmentioned already who are you going to\nserve right what energy are you giving\nthem\nyou haven't even got your own mind right\nhow are you going to inspire a young man\nno matter how whatever you have or a\nyoung woman the second thing was sadhana\nsadhana was your personal rituals and\npractices\nyour personal\neating of yourself like when you were\ngoing out mozambique you can't build a\nschool if you haven't worked on your own\nfitness and you haven't eaten a meal how\nlong are you gonna last so the second\nthing was once you've made sure your\nbody and mind are right have you\nprepared your soul\nexactly as you said have you prepared\nyour consciousness should have been a\nmonk have you prepared yeah you should\nhave basically should have been a\nteacher\nhave you prepared your intention and the\nfinal savor is service that's the final\ngiving to others is the final not that\nit's the least important it's the most\nimportant right if you look at any tree\naround you\nif it wasn't watered properly if it\nwasn't taken care of properly you look\nup it's got no fruits what fruits are\nyou giving to people you're giving\npeople rotten fruits\nand that's where you start so it's not\nthat service is the least important it's\nthe most important and therefore you're\nto water the roots well so for me that's\nhow i think about what's most important\nis by first taking care of the first two\nso that the third can be done to its\nbest but don't say yes to an opportunity\nfor the third before you've done the\nfirst two does that make sense it makes\nso much sense it reminds me of the story\nthere's this tree tree of tannery have\nyou ever heard of it no i haven't okay\nsahara desert this tree lives to be 350\nyears old it used to be a wooded area\nbut then the climate changed and became\na desert and only one tree survived tree\nof tenere and the roots went down\nhundreds of feet into this little\nwatering hole in a state and then\nunfortunately like it was on maps\nbecause it was the one tree you know\nhundreds of miles around\nand uh and a driver came with a truck\nand and hit it knocked it over and that\nwas it for the truth\nand then i always contrast that with\npando and pando is the second largest\nliving organism in the world 80 000\ntrees in utah in the us\n80 000 trees\nand it's been around for 70 000 years so\nhere's one tree okay that can survive\nfor 350 years in ridiculous conditions\nand i always say like that's incredible\nbut then one driver out done see you\nlater sayonara\nnow with 70 000 trees and they share a\ncommon root system yeah okay i always\nthink about that when you when you were\nsaying that i just kept thinking pando\npanda okay kept going with my because\nwe need each other yeah and we need\npeople yeah and we need to connect and\nthat that to me is like\nyou know that is the secret sauce today\nyeah in a world where\nisolation is our kryptonite yeah\nthe connectivity of roots and the\nconnectivity of people and how you j\nshetty are able to bring us together\nthrough a common language and that\nyour\nmonks three-step process i mean that\nit's so it's it's pure it's genius and\nit's so um intuitive yeah it's brilliant\nand even what you're writing about in\nthe book i s what you just said\nyou today have more of a luxury of time\nin your life today yes obviously that\nwasn't how it was at all\ni do not have a luxury of time\nand\nat this current stage of my life as a\nmonk i did more so for sure\nwhat i've realized is\ntime is the wrong metric and the wrong\ndivisible so we divide our life by time\nwe say okay i need time with my family i\nneed time with my partner i need time\nwith scott i need time with this i need\ntime with that\nand i realized a few years ago no one\nwanted my time\neveryone wanted my presence and everyone\nwanted my energy\nso if i could give 10 minutes of my time\nbut a hundred percent of my energy\nthat's what someone wanted\nand i started changing how i looked\ntoday looking at the ratio of my energy\nversus my time\nand saying how much time can i give at a\nhundred percent energy\nand sometimes the time went down to 60\nseconds\nand that was fine because i realized\nthat people would rather have a hundred\npercent of my energy than one percent of\nmy energy in a hundred percent of my\ntime giving someone an hour being on my\nphone all the time as you were saying\nwhen you got with your friends\nno one wants that right no one wants to\nsee me and you both on our phones right\nnow and have a couple of questions about\nyour book people want to hear us have\npresents right jay that's why i say be\nwhere your feet are and not get balanced\nif you're just like how do i find\nbalance i'm like let's let's talk about\nthat okay\nabout it yes\nit's the first question i get in\nparticular with young people i talk to\nhigh school kids or colleagues i can't\nbelieve kids are asking that question\neveryone that's worrying\neveryone how do i find balance i'm like\nget to work yeah but i i literally say\nlike i think about my life\nand i think about home well how do you\nhave such a good strong relationship you\nseem focused on your faith and your\nfamily and work and how do you do it i\nwas like hey here's the thing okay let's\ntalk about life let's talk about real\nlife not\nyou know the huxtables on tv let's talk\nabout real real life okay here's what\nreal life looks like for me\ni get up in the morning it's chaos i\ncall it the ncaa tournament we just\nsurvive in advance we are trying to get\nout the door without a nuclear meltdown\nyou borrow my shirt i can't find my\nyou're in charge my computer all that\ncrap the girl's good to school okay\nhow many meaningful moments can i have\nat that point how about zero i have to\nbe okay with that because it's not\nhappening yeah okay one can't get out of\nbed the other one's up at five in the\nmorning i mean it is you know it's chaos\nthen i go to work they go to school\nthey've got cheerleading they've got\nbasketball they've got boyfriends which\nwe do not want to talk about ever\nwe have homework i have work i have\nevents we come home\nthey how much time talk about energy how\ndo i how do i be present how much time\ndo you have 45 minutes\nyour family the people you say you love\nmost that matter most in your life an\nhour\ntwo hours and you're luckiest person in\nthe world so what are you gonna do with\nthat one hour and i say let's create\nsome meaningful moments\nlet's create a memory let's have a real\nconversation and by the way what's great\ntoday there's so many things to talk\nabout the world is falling apart\nwe have social unrest we have challenges\nto the core of faith and and the church\nin this country we have the education\nsystem we have a political system that's\na complete adventure we become global\ncitizens we have all these topics that\nwe can talk to our children or you know\nwhat we can do write them a love letter\nor you know what we can do\ntell them three things you really want\nthem to remember or you know what we can\ndo tell them everything you ever want to\ntell them but haven't spent the time yet\nbecause those moments are what they will\nremember and will matter go on a family\nwalk oh it took an hour\nand we actually left our phones in the\nhouse and we went to go walk for 45\nminutes\nthat time that's what we have to protect\nthat's what we have to put our energy\nand effort on that's where our\nintentions should go this notion of\nbalance what are we gonna do sit around\nwatching reruns or binging on netflix or\nsitting around watching a show\ntyping on our ipads messing around on\nour phone and eating licorice okay\nbecause that's what life looks like yeah\nliterally for me it's like be present i\nlove the notion of energy over time i'm\ngonna steal that yeah no it's it's been\ngame changing for me i found obviously i\ndon't have children yet so i'll have to\ncome take notes from you my wife and i\none of the things we did especially as\nthings were taking off for me\ni started a new routine with her where\nevery 30 days\ni realized that the notion of what you\njust said if you're lucky of two hours a\nday to spend with the people you love\nthe most and that's the same with me\nwhen when life was when when i was\nputting in the work and i was working 18\nhours a day to build everything that we\nwe have today\nit\ni didn't have that luxury of time with\nher so every 30 days we would take three\ndays\nand we'd go away together somewhere\nthree hours away from where we live we'd\npack the car\ndrive up get a bed and breakfast get an\nairbnb get a small motel hotel whatever\nwhatever you could afford and we'd be\nthere for two nights and three days\nand we would lock our phones in the safe\nand we'd just spend time together that's\nwonderful and i realized that doing\nthose three days every month had a\nbigger impact on our relationship than\nif we sat in front of the tv every day\nfor two hours oh i love it it just\ndidn't it didn't compare because of what\nyou just said yeah yeah that making a\nmemory\nmaking an experience\nthat's what we all want in life no one's\ngonna count and be like dad i know you\nspent 10 hours with me this week no\none's counting that there's no no one's\nkeeping a clock of that but my wife\nremembers oh remember that weekend we're\ngoing to spam springs i remember when we\nwent to temecula we rode those e-bikes\naround for the whole day or do you\nremember when we went up and we went to\nsanta barbara and we just walked on the\nbeach like those are the things you\nremember\nyeah they're so true and they weren't\nexpensive none of those they were\nexpensive or they were all free walk by\nhere's here's a real free one you can\nadd go for it\nwe have my wife and i when things are\ngood and we're we're in our in our zone\nwe go on one walk a week that we call\nnon-transactional nice think about like\nlife is transactional and\nnon-transactional\ntransactionalists okay we got the kids\ngot this oh she's got practice oh\nthere's a game on tuesday okay okay um\nwhat are we doing this friday none of\nthat we just talk\nand we stay in the moment and we stay\npresent and when we do that i feel like\nour relationship is more solid we are\nmore grounded and we're more connected\nmm-hmm i love that and it's our version\nof your three-day trip which is\nnon-transactional i love that that's and\nthat's hard i'm sure with kids yes like\nthat's harder and harder as you have\nmore people to talk about and their\nlives and
