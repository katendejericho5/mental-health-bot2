    "transcript": "it's like self-love like you got the\nconfidence one day of like yeah i\ndeserve this i'm very proud of myself\nbut then the next day it's oh god oh no\npeople think i'm a joke that could be\nsparked because you see one comment and\ni used to do this i'm gonna be honest i\nwould scroll through comments until i\nfound a negative one scroll through\nthousands of positive until i found a\nnegative one and that would be when i\nwould turn off my phone which is so\nunhealthy\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you who come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now you know that\ni'm always on the lookout to speak to\npeople that i find interesting\nfascinating and often people that we\ndon't know so much about them as a human\nas an individual we see them on the big\nscreen we watch them at home we see them\non our phones but we don't know too much\nabout them and today's guest is someone\nwho i've been watching binge watching\nreligiously uh on netflix on her show\nnever have i ever i'm talking about none\nother than my three ramakrishnan who's\nan actress known for her leading role as\ndevi vishwa kumar in the netflix teen\ncomedy series never have i ever in 2019\nshe was chosen by mindy kaling out of 15\n000 candidates that applied for an open\ncasting call for the show she created\nher audition tape at a local library\nusing her mother's camera eventually\nbeing asked to send four more videos\nbefore having a screen test in la and\nbeing offered the role in 2019 today\nshe's been named as one of the 18\ngroundbreakers a list of girls who were\nbreaking down barriers and changing the\nworld in 2021\nand she was named a breakout actor in\ntime 100's most influential people she\nwas back for a second season and never\nhave i ever and it was also announced\nthat she will star in the netflix\nromantic comedy the netherfield girls\nwelcome to the show my three\nramakrishnan my three thank you so much\nfor doing this\nthank you for having me yeah\ni've really been looking forward to this\nbecause i remember when season one came\nout and me and my wife literally watched\nthe whole season in one night and\nand we were both just like oh my gosh\nthis show is so addictive\nand you know for us it was interesting\nwatching it because my wife and i both\nfrom south asian backgrounds were born\nand raised in london\nand so to see the somewhat south asian\nexperience portrayed through the show in\nthe united states was a learning curve\nfor us it was you know it was unique for\nus it wasn't the same at all i wanted to\nask you show aside\ntell us about what it was like growing\nup as a south asian young woman in the\nunited states in sorry in canada for you\ncanada um\nfor me it was a little different to\ndavey because i was you know blessed to\nhave people from all sorts of\nbackgrounds you know in class with me\nwhich was really awesome because i got\nto learn about everyone's you know\nbackgrounds and cultures and identities\nand just life stories in general which\nexposed me to a lot but then also like\nreally pushed me to figure out okay how\ndo you identify as a thumbnail canadian\nlike what does that actually really mean\nto you and i'm really thankful for my\nupbringing and i have to give a shout\nout to my parents i\nwouldn't have said this like however\nmany years ago\nbut i realized now very quickly with\neverything that's happened i'm only like\nhalf of what i am or like even a quarter\nof what i am like without them you know\nwhat i'm saying like i need them to be\nwho i am so\nyeah\ni love that tell us about something\ngrowing up like you said that you would\nhave felt like oh my parents are weird\nor i don't really connect with them or i\ndon't agree with them and now you're\nlike oh you are so right like tell me\nabout something that changed i'm\nactually glad you asked that because\nusually like i get asked the question\nlike oh were your parents like\nsupportive of you going to acting which\nis super valid as a question as you know\nreality is a lot of south asian parents\naren't right it's a very you know tricky\nfield to go into entertainment but my\nparents are very supportive um my dad\ngrowing up was always like yeah whatever\nyou need like we'll figure it out we'll\nget you there we'll do whatever you got\ndo whatever you want be whoever you want\nbut just be the best you can be at it\nbut despite all that now looking back i\nrealize how supportive and like how much\nthey were there for me growing up as\nlike a kid\ni always felt like the outsider you know\nlike in my family like sort of like the\nblack sheep because my brother he's two\nyears older than me i'm the younger one\nso i'm like the stereotypical you know\nyounger rebellious sibling\nand my brother was the good studious one\nand who loved reading books while i'd\nrather just go to like an amusement park\nyou know i'm not gonna read a book\nwhatever\nso i always felt like i couldn't connect\nwith my family for the longest time\nuntil\ni realized like wait\nmy home's like really cool to talk to\nand\ni it's like you know i don't know like\nyou've experienced this i'm sure you\nhave i feel like a lot of kids have it's\nthat moment where you stop necessarily\nidolizing your parents thinking like oh\nmy god they're everything and they're\namazing they can do nothing wrong and\nthen maybe you see them cry once and\nyou're like\nwhy that's a little a little gross or\nlike they do something and you're like\noh i actually like disagree with you on\nthat and i think when those moments\nstarted happening i started humanizing\nthem and i'm like yeah\nyeah i think that's that's my little\ntangent yeah no i love that that's a\ngreat answer i i really appreciate you\nopening up and letting us in because\nyou know i i love the character you play\non the show but on on this show on on\npurpose my whole focus is on you as a\nhuman and an individual so i'm excited\nto get to know you know my three like\nthat's the person that i'm really\ninterested in and and fascinated by and\nin your journey so thank you for being\nso open already and and sharing stories\nand and now now that we all know that\nyour brother's this super intelligent uh\noh my god he's such a nerd\nhe's also like like he's the book smart\none but i'm the street smart one and he\nknows it got it got it well it's funny\nbecause i have a younger sister what's\nyour age different two years you said\ntwo years two years so my younger sister\nis four years younger than me and it's\nthe other way around i'm the rebel i'm\nthe kid who got into trouble i\nexperimented and she's like just the\nsweetest soul so\nwe we traded places but uh no i i love\nwhat you're saying and\nyou know i i think it's so important to\nrecognize that like you said it's always\neasy to look back and point fingers at\nour parents and be like oh they didn't\nlet me do that or they they were they\nwere wrong about this but to be able to\nsay and i feel the same way as you\nyou know i look back at the things my\nparents forced me to do and now i look\nback\nand i'm just like wow i'm so glad you\nforced me to do that and and you know i\nthink i think it's a good good\nreflection i i wanted to talk about\nyou know\nwhat\nwere you like growing up as a child have\nyou\nhave you always been outgoing and you\nsaid rebellious i want to hear a bit\nabout that rebellious side like what\nwhat was your rebellion leading you to\nyeah i mean i've always been like an\nextroverted you know person i always\nwould talk to everyone um growing up my\nmom's rule was if she didn't know their\nparents i wasn't going over to their\nhouse not happening so quickly my\ngamecube my nintendo gamecube became my\nbest friend and so i'm like pretty good\nat all those video games but\nthat's why i also picked up a bunch of\ndifferent like hobbies like drawing and\npainting and singing and playing piano\nand you know just doing these things by\nmyself and which i'm you know one of\nthose things i'm very thankful for\nbecause i have all those skills now\nbut in terms of like the rebellious side\nthat's actually from my parents too in\nthe sense it's like the sense of justice\nmy parents have always raised me to\nspeak about what i believe in if i see\nan injustice speak up for it if i see\nsomeone you know in trouble or like\ngetting bullied or just picked on\nwrongfully it doesn't matter if you\ndon't know them go stand up for them\nlike speak your mind and\nlike i you know like the whole term of\nlike code switching that many you know\npeople of color do\ni never did that and that's truly\nbecause my mom especially\nraised me to believe you don't have to\nyou just do you be who you are don't be\na brat\nbut be who you are\nyou don't need to hide yourself or not\nspeak your mind in a family party or in\nthis professional setting if you see\nsomething wrong you speak up my mom\nliterally raised me as a kid and said if\nsomeone ever punches you\nyou have one punch back make it count\nthat's what my mom would say to me so\ndid you ever exercise that advice did\nyou ever use that advice\nno i don't think i ever like did yeah\nunless it was probably with a fight\nagainst my brother or something or maybe\nlike with my cousins\nbut definitely\nthat energy was very much so there where\nmy friends knew like okay my tray like\nstands up for what she believes in i was\nvery well acquainted in high school with\nthe principal's office\nnot for like bad things the principal\nand i got along very well actually but\nif i saw something go down with like a\nteacher and a student like i'm there and\ni'm like this is what's happening you\nneed to figure this out this is wrong\nyou know\ni love that i love that yeah we need we\nneed more people who speak up and stand\nup and and don't just let things happen\nby the sides i mean you said that that\nyou developed a lot of skills because\nyour parents were like if i don't know\ntheir parents you're not allowed to go\nout i i wonder did you get quite\ncomfortable even though you're an\nextrovert i'm interested did you get\ncomfortable spending time alone and do\nyou think that has stayed the same or\nare you kind of like no no i i don't\nlike being alone oh okay so that that's\nthank you for asking that too because\nthis is something i've always wanted to\ntalk about as well like\ni\nup until probably my last year of high\nschool\nhated being alone like i hated it i had\nsitting with my own thoughts i hated\njust sitting with myself having to talk\nto myself have to entertain myself\nbecause i didn't like myself for the\nlongest time i would rather be anyone\nelse you know and\nthroughout like you know school i would\nalways surround myself with like a bunch\nof different people just to like you\nknow hang out with and the more people i\nhad met the more opportunities to go out\nthe more\nstories and like conversations i could\nhave that weren't with myself until you\nknow in grade 12\ni was forced to have those conversations\nwith myself and realize\ni really don't like being alone this is\nnot fun the whole reason i did after\nschool theater was because i wanted\nsomething to do after school that would\nkeep me at school and not send me home\nwow that was the reason i started it and\nthen i'm obviously so thankful but\nthat's how i got into acting wow that's\namazing i love hearing that that's\nthat's that's awesome that you are able\nto find something through actually being\nlike oh i'm just using this as an\nescapism but it actually became your\nlife it caught up to me it caught up to\nme i had to learn how to like sit in my\nown silence which now i'm better at i'm\nnot perfect at it and i don't think\nanyone really is it's a growing journey\nbecause you're changing yourself\nbut i'm\nless\nharsh on myself as an individual in that\nway yeah still in general very hard on\nmyself but yeah yeah yeah i wanted to\nknow you said that earlier you were like\nyou know up until you finished high\nschool you're like i really didn't enjoy\nbeing by myself you like i didn't like\nmyself tell us a bit about that because\ni think that's a very\ncommon experience but it's not commonly\ntalked about because we don't hear\npeople say that like for you to have the\ncourage to just say right now like i\ndidn't like myself like and and now that\nyou're that's transitioning and i loved\nhow you said it's not perfect it's not\nlike you figured it out but you've been\ntransitioning tell us why you didn't\nlike yourself like what made you feel\nthat way what put you in that position\ni feel like\nbeing able to talk about it first of all\nactually comes from the show\nlike one of the things that when people\nlike talk about davey just really\nquickly like when they say oh she's so\nconfident yet she's a nerd she is very\nconfident still like 100 she's loud\nshe's outspoken\nbut confident about herself no she's\nconfident when it comes to\ngrades and being book smart but\nconfident about her own thoughts her own\nworth her self-worth\nno way and\nit was like this like weird experience\nof playing this character that i deeply\ncare about like a younger sister seeing\nher go through this but also just\nknowing that a bunch of people a whole\nwriter's room wrote this and that made\nme realize this isn't such a individual\nrare experience so many people go\nthrough it and we should talk about it\nmore i feel like\nyou know loving yourself is so hard\nbecause one day you could be like\nthere you're on your chat you're like\nyeah\nhad a great day next day terrible gone\nand that could be because of something\nas small as like you know getting a\npimple right in the middle of your face\nor getting into like a fight with\nsomeone and you feel just like a\nterrible human being\nso true it's so true yeah and and i\nthink\nyou know i think you're spot on i mean i\nlook back to being and i love how you\nsaid that davey's like a younger sister\nto you in the way that you see the see\nthe role i think that's such an\ninteresting way to put it and\nwhen i look back at my own self at 16\nand if i honestly\ni think a lot of people around me would\nhave said i was pretty confident that i\nthink you're right like if i really\nlooked inward\nno i wasn't i don't think i was at 16. i\nmean 16 is a really tough age to be\nactually confident i mean you barely\nknow who you are and\nyou know i i find that a lot of people\nare obviously i mean you're 19 now i\nbelieve\num so\ni i feel a lot of people also\nwhat i love about what the show has done\nis that it's opened up this like\nmulti-generational conversation\nlike it's not even though it's called a\nteen comedy series it's like i'm not a\nteen and i watch it my wife's 19 and she\nwatches it and and then i also know like\nfull-on parents adults and uncles and\naunties that are watching it when you\nlook at things generationally and you\nlook at yourself growing up too\ndo you think that i feel like we always\nfeel that the next generation doesn't\nget it but we were that same generation\nwhen we were at that age do you ever\nfeel like that when you're looking at\ndavey's your little sister you're now 19\nyou're working with and do you ever feel\nthat way does that make sense for me\nlike it's so interesting whenever people\nlike whenever people talk about like gen\nz versus gen x versus millennials versus\nboomers and sometimes like i just have\nto like close my ears about it and just\nlike just say shut up because at the end\nof the day it's just the year you were\nborn and how the world was when it when\nyou were born when you were a kid when\nyou were at your coming of age netflix y\na moment and that is totally valid and\nfair it's a 100 a different experience\nlike my parents don't get what it means\nto grow up with technology in your\nschool right but they went through\nthings that\nwe wouldn't get but there's a lot that\nwe can all universally understand like\nthis idea of loving yourself like this\nidea of self-confidence just in general\nmental health that is really universal\nand it sucks because now what i'm\nfinding is that like the generation\nconversation is starting to divide\npeople of like oh that's such a\nmillennial mentality we're like oh these\nlike gen zirs think they have it all\ntogether they think they're like the\nbee's knees and it's like no you know\nwhat like to my fellow gen z we're not\nthe bees knees we're not better we're\njust humans and we all are at the end of\nthe day so why can't we just all be\nbetter despite what year we were born in\ngo wig your neon 80s outfit go wear your\n50s hoop skirts like i don't care just\nbe nice and just talk about these things\nbecause there's not that many\ndifferences my grandma learned so much\nfrom me i learned so much from her like\nshe's like my best friend and i talk to\nher all the time she learns so much from\nme and i learned a lot from her and\nthat's like what matters you know well\nsaid i love that that's that's such a\ngreat\ngreat way of putting it in great way of\nsharing it tell me tell me about some of\nthe things i love hearing about this\nbecause my wife's also extremely close\nto her grandmother like re exactly how\nyou just said they're like best friends\ni wanted to know what what are some of\nthe things you've shared with each other\nor learned from each other some of the\nthings you've taught her some of the\nthings she's taught you i'd love to hear\nabout some of that\nyeah i mean so like i said like before\nwhen i was younger in my house i felt\nlike there was no one i could really\ntalk to because i knew if i was gonna\ntalk to my brother and tell him a secret\nthat was gonna go right back down to\namma almost gonna find out i'm gonna be\nin trouble and i'm gonna get real mad\nbut my grandma\nshe's goaded she was like my best friend\nwould always like hang out with me and\nnow it's like she's like she's got\ntwitter right\nshe'll see something on twitter and\nshe'll like i mean she mainly just\nfollows me but like you know she'll see\nsomething or like something that someone\nreplies and like it'll be a slang term\nor like whatever kind of term maybe it's\nsomething about like the lgbtqia\ncommunity and she'll say like what is\nthis so i'm like yeah mom i'll teach you\nand then she like knows about it and\nshe's like okay\ncool like things like that and then i\nget to learn of course about how she\ngrew up of course but then also just\nwhere she's coming from as someone who\ntakes care of my grandfather and someone\nwho has her own challenges and i'm like\nhuh\nwe're not so different like\nwe're really not but yeah\ni love that it's it's great you know\nthose conversations take time and\npatience because\ni'm sure that when she's asking you a\nquestion\nyou're having to then see it from her\nperspective and yeah you know think\nabout it it's not just like you know\nbecause\nlike you said she's come from a\ndifferent time she's had different\nexperiences it's amazing that you've\ndeveloped that where do you think you\ndevelop that\nthat ability to be patient to be\nempathetic the way you're talking like\nwhen i'm hearing you\nuh you know there's so much maturity in\nthe way you're sharing how you are\nnavigating this which is beautiful to\nsee\ni'm not surprised at all you know it's\nit's awesome but i wonder where do you\nthink that came from was there an\nexperience that happened in your life or\nwas it through your parents who you're\ngiving so much love and credit to where\ndid that come from or where does that\ndevelop from is the question i mean i'm\nstill a 19 year old like\nloser\nlike 19 year old video game you're not a\nloser but you're a 19 year old video\ngame player yes yeah so that's cool\nthat's my biggest flex but like i'm\nstill just 19 and like you know whatever\nbut\ni think the idea of like maybe listening\nto people\ni'm not gonna lie and say like oh yeah i\nlisten to everyone give them like\neveryone my full heart there's times\nwhere it's like hey yeah steering clear\nfrom you you know yeah but when it comes\nto like sitting down with the people i\ncare about to hear them out\nanswer all their questions\nhear where they're coming from their\nperspective\ni guess it's just me thinking like hey\nwhen the tables turn please hear me out\nbecause there's been times like i've\ngone through moments in like school when\ni was growing up where i wasn't heard\nout you know and it's like damn\nit really sucks and now with the\nindustry like being thrown into this\nindustry having no friends family who\nare in this industry at all whether\nthey're an actor writer director\nproducer like no one has done this in my\nfamily or in my circle\nand it's such a unique experience that\nlike i have when i talk to them about it\nwhen i have like you know my\nown issues about it and i'm you know\nranting about something\ni want them to listen to me you know i\nwant them to like try their best to put\nthemselves in my shoes try them their\nbest to empathize and understand\nbecause that's all they can do they're\nnever going to know what it's like\nexactly but they can empathize and\nlike a little bit of a tangent here but\nwhen it comes to acting\num i always get asked like what's your\nmethod\ni have a method i generally don't have a\nmethod like i've never done an acting\nclass in my life but my process\nis that here's a character you're going\nto play this character\nin order to play this character you have\nto believe in every single one of their\ndecisions you're basically their lawyer\nand you're going to have to defend them\nso when davey's doing crazy crazy things\nand she's making terrible choices at\ntimes\ni have to empathize and understand okay\nkid why are we making this choice like\nwe're gonna do it but why where are you\ncoming from so it's empathy on another\nlevel of like okay because now i'm gonna\nhave to live this now i'm gonna have to\nmake it believable because it's one\nthing to pick paxton over eleanor and\nfabiola but there's another thing to\npick paxton believably and make the\naudience still\nactually believe that davey feels she's\nmaking the right choice and have the\naudience\nunderstand that yeah this kid genuinely\nthinks this is the right choice it's a\nbad choice\nbut we're gonna all empathize with her\ntogether you know i think what you're\nsaying there about knowing why the\ncharacter would do something\nand and applying that in real life like\nif we\ninstead of if you've just said something\nbeautiful today instead of looking at\nwhat people do around us if we listen to\nunderstand why they're doing it then\nthat's gonna help us a lot more because\nwhat people do doesn't always equate\nwith why we think they're doing it\nand and and even as an actor as you're\nsaying right now like understanding why\nyour character wants to do something is\nwhat makes it believable uh and and it's\nspot on like you know that that's\nexactly what makes a difference i want\nto ask you a bit more about that when\nyou talked about acting there obviously\nit started as this escape and so you\ndidn't have to go home and so that you\ncould you could be there at after school\ndid you did you have a and you said no\none in your family's ever done this\nbefore did you have a plan b from acting\nor was acting you were like i'm all in\ni'm gonna make this happen this is gonna\nbe my thing\nso when i was 10 i decided i wanted to\nbe like a disney animator for pixar that\nwas the dream that was the dream for the\nlongest time up until my last year in\nhigh school and then i realized drawing\non other people's time made me miserable\nlike i could not do it and i was like oh\nmy god like what am i gonna do now i\nfelt like such a disappointment with\nmyself because i ran around school\nsaying like yeah i'm gonna be a pixar\nanimator i'm gonna like everyone knew oh\nmy tray's dream job is to be an animator\nand then i like didn't do it because i\nwas like i can't i can't i'm gonna be\nmiserable\ni still like went through with my\nportfolio because i'm stubborn\nbut i was not happy and then suddenly i\nwas like\noh my god what am i doing with my life i\nbasically just let down\n10 year old me that went to disney world\nand got all the inspiration that a 10\nyear old could ask for yeah but\nwhile i was applying to universities my\nmom\nshe was the one that said hey like like\nthey're like why don't you toss in like\na application for theater\nput her in there put her in the mix\nand i was like all right like fine it's\nextra work but maybe i'll regret it if i\ndon't could be fun whatever\nmy mom recognized my passion for theater\nbefore i did in high school it was truly\njust a fun thing and\nit was a fun thing that i also went into\nfor like writing my own plays and\ndirecting my own play then being in a\nmusical multiple musicals multiple plays\nbut i was like yeah it's just fun times\nlike i'm not gonna be a big actor\nbut then eventually after i realized you\nknow it was one of the first times in my\nlife i was ever proud of myself i\nfinished my grade 12 drama exam and i\nwas really proud of myself and i was\nlike you know what\ni do have skill like\ni\nam not a failure and that's great\nso i accepted theater and that was the\nplan but the plan wasn't to become a big\nactor\ngo work at netflix the plan was\nwe'll see what happens maybe community\ntheater is cool which is awesome or just\nin toronto like the local theater scene\nthere that would be great that would be\nthe ideal that's beautiful i love\nhearing how real that is that's that's\nawesome to hear and and also to\nrecognize just how beautiful that would\nhave been if that if that's what was\nmeant for you and you were you know you\nwere prepared for that i think so many\nso many times we hear now it's almost\nlike well if i can't do that then i\ndon't want to do it right it's like well\nif i can't do that\nepitome peak moment\nthen i don't want to do it at all\nbecause it's not good enough and it's\nalmost like i love hearing from you\nyou're at the opposite where it's like\nhey if this is all it is\nthen\nyeah that's fine yeah yeah my logic was\nif i do just theater in toronto that is\nfine because i would have fun and i\nwould meet cool people\nand then i would also have like the\npriority in my life might be different\nwhere i'm just meeting new people and\nthat's where i get joy in my life it\nmight not be from my career it might be\nfrom friends or you know family whatever\nit may be right yeah how did you pluck\nup the courage to send that first\naudition tape in because i feel the\nreason why i'm honing in on that moment\nis i think\ndoing something\nlike like that for the first time with\nyour mom's camera without any like prep\nor plan it's not like you had your\nacting coach in the room and you know\nlike i think that all of us struggle\nwith firsts and all of us struggle with\nstarting like i'm sure you speak to tons\nof people\nwho say to you like oh my i'm not sure\ni'm not good enough i'm not this enough\ni'm not smart enough i'm not beautiful\nenough\nhow did you pluck up the car what tell\nme that process like take us into your\nmind on that day\nso let me start off by saying i was\ndepressed\num i was very depressed in my last year\nof high school which took a long while\nfor me to come to terms with like i\ndidn't think i was\ni was definitely um\nand i almost took a nap that day instead\nmy best friend texted me and they said\nhey i saw this tweet from mindy kaling\nlike let's do this i didn't even know\nhow to use twitter like i didn't\nunderstand the differences between a\nretweet and a like they're basically the\nsame thing\nand\nbasically um you know my best friend\nshahara texted me and i almost said no i\nalmost said hey man i'm really tired i\nthink i'm just gonna take a nap\nand then\nsomething in me just said you know what\ni haven't like i haven't hung out with\nmy best friend in a long bit\ni'll just i'll go hang out with shahara\nshahar is the best so i said okay cool\nwe'll figure out a time and we'll go to\nthe community center because my house is\nway too loud there's no way we're gonna\nfilm a video\nthat's like even decent in here so we\nwent to the community center we figured\nout after an hour how to work my mom's\ncamera just kept shutting off so\nannoying\nand then we googled up what a slate is i\ndidn't know what that was\nbut\nthen we were flying we were making our\ntapes and the logic was to me honestly\nwas okay\nwe're gonna send it through this portal\nlike it's not even going out in public\non like the internet or whatever but\nlike we're sending this through this\nportal they might not ever even look at\nit\ngenerally i was like there's a good\nchance like they'd never check it out\nthere'd probably be like people all\naround the world auditioning for this i\nhave no experience i made my acting\nresume on canva like the free like here\ncanva i guess\ni made my acting resume on canva my\nheadshot was a photo that my best friend\ntook like outside of my high school wall\nand my eyes are squinty because of the\nsun\nit's so messed up so i didn't think\npeople would look at it and\nwith all that in mind the fact that\npeople all around the world are\nauditioning for this i was like okay\ni'm probably not gonna get this i have\nliterally no job experience at all i\ncan't even say i've like you know done\nretail\nso\nwho cares\ni'm gonna just do the best possible job\ni can because why not and it's funny i\nhave the text from that day with my best\nfriend where we literally say\nhey man like that was really fun thanks\nfor hanging out with me and they were\nlike you know what we can say we were\npart of something bigger when the show\ntakes off we can technically say we\ncontributed to it\nand then i said yeah you know what\nmaybe we'll get royalties for that like\nas a joke\nand then i said\nbut it would be pretty sweet if we went\nto hollywood right\nand then we were like ha ha\nwho knows one day man maybe one day and\nthen that was it\nthat's amazing i love that story thank\nyou for sharing that with us i know\nyou've shared it before but i\nyeah\nit's such a great story and and i had to\nhave you share with our audience and\ncommunity because\nit's\nit just you know i i just love how happy\nyou were with what you were doing\nand and how if it didn't go anywhere it\nwasn't a thing it was just like well we\ntried we put it out there into the world\nlike we're getting like the next shot\nlike we did you know like i wasn't gonna\nput out something like i didn't believe\nit because then in my mind i'd be like\nuh\ni didn't give it my best shot i'm not an\nathletic person but if i'm gonna play a\nbasketball game with someone you best\nknow i'm gonna try my best yeah will\nthere be a lot of sweating very much so\nprobably a lot of falling knees being\nskid maybe a bit of blood but i will try\nyou know yeah absolutely yeah and my mom\nsays like i'm now just living my life\npurpose and she can see it she saw it\nhonestly in high school when i was doing\nall my performances because she came to\nevery single one she saw the joy that it\ngave me and i'd have to agree i feel\nlike acting being in this creative\nindustry of film and tv it is my life\npurpose yeah i love that energy that's\nawesome and it shines off of your face\nlike even though we're not even sitting\nin front of each other right now i can i\ncan totally see it it's so real and your\npassion's so true and it's it's so\nauthentic i love it\ntell me about\ntell me about how that translated to\nthen being on your first day on set\nbecause that's a whole nother like\nthat's a whole different ball game now\nbecause it's like you've gone from being\nwith your best friend to making a video\nto now being on set where where was the\nfirst set where was it shot and tell me\nabout that experience from your\nperspective not davey's perspective but\nyours yeah we always shoot on the\nuniversal lot in l.a\nso season two actually entirely was shot\non lot we did no locations anywhere else\nbecause of covid so we got very crafty\nwith our you know spots and different\nsets\nbut the first day\num i remember the scene exactly it was\nthe scene where davey is telling fabiola\nand eleanor that she has chosen\nattainable yet status-enhancing\nboyfriends for each of us to date\nand um\nthat was the first scene we ever shot\nthe entire show\nuh and i remember being so excited\nthat we did one take and lang fisher\nsays\nokay so you just you got to slow down a\nlittle you just\nyou got to slow down a little and she's\nlike maybe you're a little nervous and i\nwas like honestly\ni'm not nervous at all i'm just really\nexcited to be here i was introducing\nmyself to everyone saying like hi i\nmight trade rama ramakrishnan like\nwhat's your name trying to like get to\nknow everyone and\ni was my mentality was the two first\nthings i learned like really quick was\nnumber one\ntrust everyone to do their job and then\nyou stick and focus on yours when you\ntrust and then respect everyone for\ntheir job you'll be swimming because\nthen they will respect you to do yours\nand they'll be your biggest champions\ndon't worry about what the sound guy is\ndoing don't get in the business of the\nlighting guy let them do their thing\nbecause they're respectfully the craft\nthe masters of their own craft so when\nyou respect them and you take interest\nin a genuine authentic way of actually\ncaring about what they do they'll\nrecognize that and then they're gonna\nlight you and mic you up and get the\nbest angle of you that they possibly can\nbecause now they're on your team right\nand then the second thing that i like\nyou know kept in mind at all times was\nstay alert and learn everything you\npossibly can\nnot many get this opportunity you have\nthe best co-op in the world\nlearn everything don't be afraid to ask\nquestions and now this is credit to\nmindy kaling and lang fisher because\nthey make such a great atmosphere where\ni never felt stupid i was the only like\ncast member number one the youngest cast\nmember but also the one that has never\nin their life been on a set\nand\ndespite that i never felt stupid for it\nwere there times where i was like\noh god i have to cry now i've never\ncried on command before and sendl is\nhere and he's on like the flash or\nsomething and i have to cry and this is\na lot yeah that happened but i never\nfelt dumb\nand i never felt dumb for asking\nquestions i never felt dumb for asking\nfor help and yeah that's how we got\nthrough the days\nthat's beautiful\nthat's it's so hard isn't it because\nlike imposter syndrome's so real\nand yeah and you can often just feel\ncompletely out of your depths but those\nlessons actually i was going to ask you\nhow would you deal with imposter\nsyndrome if you felt it but those two\npieces of advice you gave us\nuh two lessons that you take away\nactually make a lot of sense\nuh and actually come as great pieces of\ninsight for anyone who's struggling with\nimposter syndrome because and i'm\nguessing that's not changed i mean now\nyou're on you know front covers of\nmagazines like you're invited to all\nthese beautiful events as you should be\nrightly have i love that you're bringing\nyour excitement everywhere has imposter\nsyndrome ever crept in or have you been\nreally like yeah tell us about that\nprocess\n100 it creeps in like every so often\nsometimes like it's like self-love like\nyou got the confidence one day of like\nyeah i deserve this i'm very proud of\nmyself\namazing but then the next day it's oh\ngod oh no i messed up i'm terrible like\npeople think i'm a joke and it could\nthat could be sparked because you see\none comment and i used to do this i'm\ngonna be honest i would scroll through\ncomments until i found a negative one\nscroll through thousands of positive\nuntil i found a negative one and that\nwould be when i would turn off my phone\nwhich is so unhealthy but maybe imposter\nsyndrome is sparked because you heard\nsomeone say oh i wish she like would\nenunciate more like she speaks weird and\ni'm like\nyou know what maybe maybe you're right\nmaybe i should just i should get a\ndialect coach for my own voice and my\nown you know sound maybe i should do\nthat but\nyou realize that a lot of people go\nthrough it a lot of people go through\nimpostor syndrome and then you're like\nhuh\ni mean we can't all be imposters right\nlike that makes sense\nsome of us have to be genuine and some\nof the most genuine people i know go\nthrough that\nbut\ni remind myself that i have worked hard\nand\nwhat used to piss me off in season one\nwas when people would say oh my god\nyou're so lucky that you got picked\nyou're so lucky\nand i'm like\nyeah 100 a good bit of fame is a lot a\nlot about being at the right place at\nthe right time for sure but i also\nworked really hard luck sure was getting\nmy audition tape sent in at the right\nday at the right time and somehow that\ngot landed on their screens and you know\ni did all that but i did work really\nhard during the audition process but you\nknow what even if you want to call the\nwhole audition luck you can't call the\nseason\nluck netflix comes out with so many\nshows a day but we're one of the biggest\nshows that's hard work yeah you know\nyeah when i remind myself of that i'm\nlike you know what\ni'm not that big of an imposter i think\ni can relax today yeah i i don't i don't\nthink so at all i think so first of all\nwhen i first watched the season\ni would never have been able to tell\nwhether you'd acted before or not like\ni would never been able to tell like no\nno\ni couldn't say i couldn't have watched\nthem been like oh she doesn't look like\na real i like like you would never said\nthat you you're great from episode one\nlike you always appear completely\ncomfortable and i believe you as in i\nhave to really talk i had to prepare\ntoday\nby going i am not interviewing davey i'm\ninterviewing maitrey like i had to\nliterally be like do not think of her as\ndavey like you have i've gotta as an\ninterviewer i have to stop thinking\nyou're this character\nbecause i believe you're this character\nlike i i don't have any doubt that you\nare davey when you're playing davey and\ni think that is a\nyou know that to me is credit to your\nskills and i always say to people like\nthe people that have success\nthey should see it as fortune and and\njoy but everyone else should see it as\nhard work because when you see someone\nelse's success as luck you then think\nyou're unlucky\nand then it stops you from working hard\nwhen actually when you see someone's\nsuccess is hard work you go okay i know\nwhat i need to do now and it sets you up\ndoes that make sense yeah 100 like get\ninspired by it don't let it defeat your\nown goals your own worth your own\njourney in life right i feel like\nwhenever people ask me like how do i get\ninto acting like how do i do this\nin my head my response is always\ni mean be on the lookout for the next\ntweet i guess like that's how i did it\nyeah but\nreality is everything happened in\ndifferent ways for people especially in\nthe creative industries like music\nacting whatever it is so unique for\neveryone so\nyou can't get yourself discouraged when\nyou see someone else succeed at this age\nyou know you can't compare yourself you\nshould appreciate and respect them for\ntheir hard work that they did and then\nbe maybe even be inspired by it you know\ndon't let it take down your own\nself-worth but i was to say i hope\ntalking to me i don't seem like davey no\nnot a joke not a joke\nit was really funny um when season one\ncame out um\nit was very funny because some people\nwould look at my success like you said\nas luck and then they would take it as\nthemselves as their unlucky and then\nthat could turn to the other way and\nthen become jealousy\nand that was rough but\nthen people just you know would either\ncome out of the woodwork to be like oh\nmy god my true i'm so proud of you i'm\nlike we have not talked in ages\nwhat but then some people would just\nstart being passive aggressive like oh\nyou're too big time for us or just say\nsome jokes that would just be like hey\ndude i'm not like a changed person i'm\nstill me literally the show even came\nout in quarantine i've been stuck in the\nsame house that you guys come over for\nlike my birthday parties man like what\nbut\nyeah the best way i know of finding out\nlike who actually know me is when they\nsay like oh my god i watched season one\nand i was asking myself were you even\nacting you're so much like the character\nand i'm like okay thank you\n[Laughter]\nthere's that yeah yeah that's not what i\nwas saying i was saying that because\nwe've never met before\nmy my only perspective of you is this\ncharacter which you play so believably\nand and i wanted to make sure today that\ni'm talking to you and asking questions\nabout you and not about davian so yeah\nfor me it was more about the\nsaying how believably you play this\ncharacter hence your skills uh as\nopposed to\nthinking you're lucky because if you\nwere lucky i wouldn't believe that you\nwere devi in the show i would just be\nlike oh this is this is weird like who's\nthe you know like that that would be the\nwhereas i don't feel that way so and and\ngetting to know you today yeah i mean\nsaying you're like davey is like really\nstereotyping and just i mean there's no\nthere's no like\neveryone has so much more depth and\nlayers and and even today i've\ndiscovered so much more about you that i\nwould never have known and that's that's\nwhat i'm hoping my community will too\nuh but tell us about you know i love\neverything you've been sharing i love\nthe messages that you're sharing with\npeople\nespecially because it's so hard\nand in our south asian community it's\nharder because when we've been less\nexposed to this happening to people\naround us and these opportunities being\ngiven so people find it harder to react\nyou had in your instagram bio respect\nexistence or expect resistance i wanted\nto understand what inspired that\nstatement and what you connect it to\ndeeply in your life\nyeah um\ni think i saw that like statement\nsomewhere on the internet back when i\nwas in high school somewhere and i\nthought oh my god word play that is so\nsmart that was my first thing but then i\nwas like yeah\nyou know what that's really awesome and\nfor my grade 12 um art exam we had to\nmake a mural and like if you scroll back\nfar enough on my instagram feed now\nthere's a picture of it this gigantic\nmural i painted by myself of this brown\ngirl and you know she's got these like\nrainbow hearts all around her gold\nbackground and at the top it says\nrespect existence or expect resistance\nand the whole idea was like you know\nhere's this brown girl the rainbow\nhearts you know symbolizing like the\nlgbtqia community and just the idea of\nrespect people you know and it's this\nwoman you know and\ni just like it as my instagram bio\nbecause it's it makes so much sense to\nme you know respect people's existence\nand if you don't\nget ready for people to be upset and get\nready for that backlash because\nyou need to respect other people for who\nthey are you need to respect the fact\nthat when i say there isn't enough south\nasian representation in film\nget ready and respect it because if\nyou're going to resist it you're going\nto be behind the curve and suddenly if\nyou're a writer that isn't willing to\nadd true diversity not token diversity\nto your scripts no one's going to want\nto work with you because the world's\nchanging and\nhonestly it's getting with the ride of\ngetting the car of respecting people for\nwho they are treating people with\nrespect like the golden rule\nor just get out\nyeah i don't have time for people with\nthat that attitude\nyeah well said the i love the\ndistinction between true and token\ndiversity i think that's such an\nimportant\nthat's so huge because\nwe hear statements that are token\ndiversity statements all the time\ni was literally just talking to someone\nlast week\nand they were told by an agency\nthat\nthey wouldn't be signing them because\nthey already have someone who's a brown\nperson in that niche that they're in and\nthey were like we already have one of\nyou and i was just like i and i\nliterally that conversation happened\nlast week and and they were asking me\nwhat i thought about that and how to\nnavigate it and i wanted to ask you how\nis your view on that on diversity\nchanged having been someone obviously\ndeveloping their career to now being on\nthe other side where you have a\nsuccessful show you're in the industry\npeople know you you know people\nhas getting closer to the industry\nmade you feel more excited about what's\nhappening or are you actually seeing\nmore and you're like okay wow like you\nknow this team mindy and this team's got\nit right but actually there's a lot of\nwork that needs to be done i want to\nknow how your views changed from before\nand after\ndefinitely the latter like\ni actually realized how used to and just\nyou know conditioned i became to not\nseeing people like myself south asian\nwomen on screen\nuntil after never have i ever season one\ncame out up until that point i was just\nokay i guess with the fact that people\nlike me were background characters\nquirky best friends that were sexually\ndeprived because that's a lovely\nstereotype or that they're just comedic\nrelief they're shy they're awkward they\ncan't talk to women unless they're drunk\nyou know you get used to that and then\nthe show came out\ni met people in the in the industry\nand\nit made me yeah hopeful that things are\nchanging\nbut honestly\ni had this like anger in me of like\nthis sucks if i didn't make it into the\nindustry i would have maybe just been\nokay with it all this time yeah like\nthis is not okay and we run around\nsaying like diversity like diversity\ndiversity we say it so much but we have\nto it's like what\nother choice do we have like it's become\nthis fluff word but it's such a\nmandatory fluff word you know like it is\nvery important because it's not\nhappening fast enough in my opinion yeah\nthe needle is moving inch by inch not\neven inch millimeter by millimeter let\nme go with my lovely canadian system but\nyou know it's moving like a little bit\nby little bit but i i get so angry\nsometimes where i just want to push it\nyou know because it's not fair to expect\na whole community of people to look at\ndavey and feel represented i used to\nthink oh no like you don't feel\nrepresented by the show but we worked\nreally hard on it it's a really good\nshow we do so much but then i was like\nno that's selfish of me i'm falling into\nthe trap that reality is the white\ndominant you know industry of hollywood\nfilm tv wants me to to make these people\njust deal with it but they shouldn't and\ni shouldn't i shouldn't have to settle\nwith davey being my one you know\nmain character role that was truly\nbirthed by\na leader in the industry mindy kaling i\nshouldn't have to settle for that i\nshould be able to get all the roles you\nknow and keep going with my career\naudiences audiences shouldn't have to\nsettle for just davey or nolani or\nkamala or even a nissan season two they\nshould be able to get all the different\nkind of characters if you are so proud\nin your identity if you are so proud of\nit and that is how you identify it means\nit's a story worth telling and nobody\ncan say otherwise it is definitely worth\nscreen time in some way or another you\nknow yeah that's so powerful thank you\nfor sharing that my torila it's such a\npowerful statement and\nreally you know it's emphatic in the way\nyou said it it's it's it's strong it's\npowerful it's bold and that's the way it\nneeds to be said i remember when i first\nmoved to la and i'm obviously born and\nraised in london hence the british\naccent and all the rest of it but when i\nmoved to la i remember going to get my\nhair cut\nand i remember my hairdresser saying to\nme they were just like\nwhere are you from and that's normal i\nalways get asked that because if i look\nat my accent and they were like they\ndidn't know that indian people sounded\nany different or looked any different to\napu in the simpsons like that was their\nlike\nlike their their take on you know what\nindian people are and so they were just\nlike are you indian are you sure and i\nwas like yeah i'm indian my parents are\nboth indian uh yeah i'm sure yeah\nlet me go fact check i'll be right back\nand then you can cut my hair okay and it\nwas so funny because i was just like i\ncouldn't i was like and that's and i sat\nback to think about it i moved to la\nthree years ago and i sat back to think\nabout it i was like\nyeah wow like for a certain generation i\ngrew up on the simpsons too and i was\nlike yeah anyone who watched the\nsimpsons like that was the only\ncharacter\nthat they saw being indian right and so\nyeah\nroman tv influence what we see in the\nworld it is a reflection of what our\nworld is like right so\nyeah it makes sense that they're coming\nin thinking like that's the reality it i\nmean if they ever just checked out any\narticle or like you know just maybe\ncommon sense or just understood\ncolonialism you know maybe but if they\nonly ever watched cartoons\nthen that would be what they think yeah\nexactly exactly but\nwhat's beautiful is that you've not only\nyou know\nyou're not only doing things on screen i\nlove how you're speaking about these\nthings off screen and interviews and and\nusing your platform for a higher purpose\ni know that you also did the amazing\ntable read recently for the fundraiser\nfor india you know supporting your\namazing fundraiser that was so awesome\nwell it was it was i mean now i wish i\nasked you to be a part of it i could\nhave interviewed you then but uh it's\nyou know i just thought it was so\namazing to just see\njust so many\nuh people using their platform\nespecially you know what you and the\nwhole team did i i think was amazing\nbecause you know\ni think for so many people you are\nrepresenting and i love your i love what\nyou're saying like what you just said\nwas so humble and so beautiful about how\nyou don't want to get caught up in the\nthe way people want you to think that\nit's enough and there should be i love\nthat but at the same time you are also\nthrough the show doing an amazing\nservice and effort as well like you know\nit's important for me to say that and i\ni love the way you're saying it but i\nwant to acknowledge that but then for\nyou and the team to do that for india i\nthought that was such a beautiful\noffering and i wanted to get an\nunderstanding from you like you seem to\nconstantly want to use your platform and\nyour ever-growing platform\nfor higher purpose for you know fighting\nfor the right for education for for\nstanding up like you said your mom told\nyou to always stand up uh i wanted you\nto tell me about something that what was\none of the first things you tried to\nstand up for back in the day or\nsomething someone that you try to stand\nup for and it maybe didn't go how you\nwanted or maybe you learned something\ninteresting from it i mean like yeah\nwith all the activism that does stem\nfrom how my parents raised me like\nthat has always been who i am before the\nshow came out i actually had a picture\nof like a walkout that i did for public\ncuts to public education on my instagram\nlike there were some photos and i had\nsome people ask me are you going to take\nthat down\nand i'm like no\nno way that's still my stance don't cut\npublic education education is the\ncornerstone to any thriving society\nbut\nyeah i mean i'm still just a 19 year old\nkid that's learning every day and is\nvery much so capable of mistakes\nwhenever i talk about this i realize it\ncontributes to the pedestal that i feel\nlike i just\nstarted putting myself on and then the\nfarther the fall becomes but i have to\nalways remind myself you're just 19. you\ncan make mistakes and when you're older\nyou can still make mistakes we all can\nstill make mistakes but back to your\noriginal question\num okay so one of my close friends\nuh i don't actually remember this but\nthey vividly do and they love to bring\nit up every single time we meet new\npeople\nand apparently so\nmy friend\nfellow thummel\nuh girl she would always dress up in her\ntraditional clothing have a but like she\nwas you know braided up\nthat's how she came to school every day\nin elementary school and her mom was\nlike always taking her home for lunch\nand you know she's the best shout out to\nvarsha but\num some people would make fun of her for\nthat i saw her and was like oh\nokay cool like i would wear my brother's\nhand-me-downs that was like how my\nfamily rolled we weren't gonna buy new\nclothes for me you just get a baggy you\nknow monster car shirt that's cool i\ndon't care\nbut\ni'd see her and i'd be like okay cool\nyou basically like look like one of my\ncousins so\nthat's nifty but then these girls were\npicking on her i saw one day they were\npicking on and they were like bullying\nher and like just making fun of her and\nlike getting really up in her space and\ni saw that she was getting anxious\napparently i keep saying apparently\nbecause i don't remember this but\napparently i went up to them\nand it's important to mention um shout\nout to my cousins they all taught me\nlovely colorful language at like the age\nof seven\nso i went up to them\ncursed them out and said just you know\nleave her\nalone\nand um yeah then they got like you know\nthey're like all right fine whatever\nlike\nmy trees like whatever getting all mad\nand then they walked off and then i just\napparently said you good\nshe was like yeah and i'm like okay and\nthen i walked away\ni wasn't like friends with her at the\ntime we became friends in like high\nschool but i was like okay\ncool\nthanks and then i just left\nshe vividly remembers this so there you\ngo there's my time i i love it\ni love that i love that my three it's\nbeen so much fun talking to you i know\nyou've got an extremely busy schedule\nand so many interviews you're doing so\nwe're so grateful you spent time uh with\nthe on purpose community but i want to\nend with our fast five so we end every\ninterview with the fast five round that\nhas to be answered in one word to one\nsentence maximum so uh no longer do you\nnot notice how much i talk i loved it i\nloved that you talk it was great i love\nthat you too all right so my three\nramakrishnan these are your fast five uh\nthe first question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever received\nstick to your morals\ndon't take no for an answer yeah that's\ntwo sentences crap\nthat's fine what what is the worst\nadvice you've ever received i don't know\nbad advice i i feel like i would\nprobably want to get rid of that out of\nmy brain as quickly as possible you know\nwhat bad advice\ndon't make a fuss about it\ndo not like that's not even like advice\nlike it's not like i even took it but\nyeah don't make a fuss about it great\nyeah that's a good answer all right\nquestion number three uh what's the\nfirst thing you do in the morning and\nthe last thing you do at night ah really\nunhealthy go on my phone\nwhat do you do on your phone\num it's either a watching cartoons or\ntick tock social media\nbut mainly cartoons\namazing i love it all right question\nnumber four uh what's the biggest lesson\nyou've learned in the last 12 months\nit's okay to make mistakes you're a work\nin progress and that's because my mom\nalways calls me that she always says\nwhenever anyone praises me to my mom and\nsays your daughter's so lovely oh my\ngosh i love her my mom just says\nshe's a work in progress\nshe's unfazed it could be a compliment\nfrom mindy herself and my mom just says\nwork in progress next time i see your\nmom i'm going to try the opposite i'm\ngoing to well first time i see your mom\nmaybe not the first time i see your mum\ni think i'll i'll be good the first time\nsee your mom i think if i ever get to be\na mother again if i get the wonderful\nfortune i'll say i think my three is a\nwork in progress i want to see how she\nreacts yeah yeah just spin it on here\nyeah no i love that that's beautiful and\nand uh i i one of the things i really\nappreciated in this conversation is how\nmuch you kept repeating\nhey i can make mistakes i'm 19 i'll make\nmistakes hey even if you're older you\ncan make mistakes and i love that\nbecause i i completely agree with you\nlike we're all doing things that we were\nnever trained to do\nwe were never sure we were going to do\nand we don't know how women weren't\nmeant to be watched by millions totally\nlike we can all unequivocally agree
