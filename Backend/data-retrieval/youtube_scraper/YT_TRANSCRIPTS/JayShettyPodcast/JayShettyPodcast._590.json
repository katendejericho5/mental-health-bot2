i'm\nsitting down with the one and only\neditor-in-chief of women's health liz\nplusser and talking about her new book\nown your morning you know how much i\nlove mornings you know how much i

beautiful book\nand i can't wait to dive into it with\nyou oh jay it is so awesome to be here\nwith you in person too i feel so lucky\nand grateful for that amazing\nintroduction and just\nsuper grateful for your friendship and\nyour support and for you being a\ncontributor to this book too it's like\nit's all happening right now and i'm i'm\nfilled with love and light and happiness\nso\nit's awesome to be here with you you are\na powerhouse you're a leader\nin the health and wellness space you're\na\nyou know you're an editor-in-chief you\nhave this huge responsibility\nbut your background wasn't in media or\nwellness your background was that you\nwere an investment banker\nand i love that about you\nbecause\nit's the\ncolliding of two completely different\nworlds at least from an external point\nof view but i'd love you to take us back\nas to liz\nat college\ntrying to figure out what liz wanted to\ndo yeah and how you ended up as an\ninvestment banker i will go back even\nfurther and say that an interest in\nfitness and health and nutrition has\nalways been part of my dna i grew up\nplaying sports\ni got really into running and training\nfor marathons and sort of how fuel um\ncould help you perform at your peak so\nthat has always been\nhugely important to me but honestly jay\nwhen i was in college where i was an\nenglish major but i also took a lot of\neconomics classes and really always\nloved business and learning about it\nit even though i was an avid magazine\nreader back then like the person who\nspent all her allowance money\nat the supermarket buying all the\nmagazines like i grew up doing that me\ntoo it never occurred to me that you\ncould do something you love and get paid\nfor it like i thought work had to be\nhard i went through the interview\nprocess as a senior i went to princeton\nand sort of the investment banks and\nconsulting firms descended upon campus\nand all my friends were going to them\nand i had enough\nbackground and economics and math\ncourses to get an amazing job offer even\nat the time i was like i cannot believe\nthis is happening you should see that\ni'm an english major right\nbut to their credit i think they saw\nvalue in somebody with a slightly\nuntraditional background and perspective\nand then i moved to new york and it was\nlike my ticket to come to new york city\nand start my life and be able to pay for\nan apartment and all those things\nand\ni i learned very quickly that it was not\nmy life's passion and i'm actually in in\nretrospect so glad that i didn't land in\nsome job that i was like sort of okay\nwith it wasn't that bad it wasn't that\ngreat like i viscerally knew in my heart\nthis is not this is not meant to be my\nmy life's work and having that\nexperience and feeling that in my gut\nreally catapulted me to\nstart learning about what do you want to\ndo and like networking with people and\nasking everybody about their jobs and do\nyou like them and the further i went\ndown that path the more this crazy idea\nof like\nwell i love love love magazines i love\nhealth and wellness\ncould i explore that could i go there it\nsuddenly the more i learned the more i\nwas like i think this is this is where i\nwant to go so\num fast forward to today as you\nmentioned i'm the editor-in-chief of\nwomen's health um it's literally a dream\njob i actually when i was 23 years old\nhad a dream that i would have this job\num so it's um i still wake up every day\nand i feel the\nimmense responsibility and just joy and\ngratitude that i get to do what i do\nevery single day but i'm also like\nreally glad that i went down that little\nrabbit hole of investment banking\nbecause i have some quirky skills that\nactually are quite valuable in my line\nof work yeah tell us about those because\ni think often when people are seeking\ntransitions\nwe almost have this very binary view\nright what i'm doing right now is\nuseless i hate it it's not what i want\nto do\nit's not my passion it's not my mission\nthis thing over here is what i want to\ndo right and we can be very negative and\nneglectful of the skills the learning\nthe growth so i was sharing earlier with\nyou\nmy corporate experience at accenture\nyeah it wasn't my dream\nbut what i learned was so powerful yeah\nthe mentorship i received the incredible\nopportunities i got because i was a part\nof that company\nand the great initiatives they had the\nrelationships and network i have yes\nback at the company and the people that\nleft and are still there and\ni look back at that and think that's\nbeen a strength for me\nin living a life that's truly authentic\nto my passion and my purpose totally so\nwith you tell us about some of the\nuseful skills you brought along with you\nthat have been integral to your purpose\nyeah well just as you were talking i was\ni was thinking about my colleagues from\nmy my\nearly investment banking days and i'm\nstill in touch with a lot of them they\nwere really proud of me and supportive\nwhen i completely changed industries\nsurprised but also very very supportive\num and i was just thinking about how\nit was a very male dominated group that\ni was in as finance\ncan be\nbut\nthe woman who led our group was a\npowerful compassionate amazing woman\nand\nshe was incredibly supportive i remember\nwalking into her office and like taking\na thousand deep breaths beforehand to\ntell her i'm going to leave this awesome\namazing group and job to go do this\ncompletely different thing so i will\nalways just have like a soft spot in my\nheart for the the guidance and support\nand tips that she gave me on my way out\nshe was such a\nlike a luminary in my life even at that\nage and i have gone on to be so lucky to\nhave so many other women who have been\nmentors and helped me along the way\nso there's that piece of it on the\ncompletely opposite end of the spectrum\nwhen i was talking about the quirky\nskills i was thinking about how good i\nam at excel and building excel\nspreadsheets i love that that's not\ntraditionally something that editors and\nchiefs do very much but you kind of\nactually do like i now because i'm um in\nthe role that i am i very much am\nfocused on the content and the creative\nside but i also have to look after the\nbusiness and are we using our resources\nand our precious editors brains and\ntimes in appropriate ways that\nare good for the brand not only for our\nreaders but also to make the brand\nflourish and be healthy so i can pull\nout a spreadsheet and like run the\nnumbers on something in an instant um\ni made a lot of decks you know in\npowerpoint back in the day and i\ncontinue to love doing that and love\nlike sprinkling magic dust on them um\nand tinkering with them i have also\nfound that when\npeople discover what my experience was\nand where my my first job was\nin my industry everyone's like impressed\nand appreciates that i bring a slightly\ndifferent\nnot completely traditional\nperspective to my work i think that's\nsomething maybe for your audience to\nkeep in mind wherever they are in their\njourneys is that um\na diverse perspective and i mean that in\nall of the ways that is really help\nhealthy and valuable no matter what you\ndo or where you are yeah i read a really\ninteresting study probably around four\nyears ago now and it was by mit and they\nlooked at employees networks online and\noffline\nand they found that employees\nwho knew people\nwho knew people who knew the same people\nhad less innovative ideas and were able\nto bring less creativity to the table\nbut employees who had a network that was\nmore diverse\nwhere you'd be confused by how they know\nboth those types of people yeah and so i\noften say that when i have ideas or\nthoughts i often think well what would a\ntech giant say so what would mark\nzuckerberg or steve jobs or someone like\nthat think about this and then what\nwould the dalai lama think about this\nand to me that opposite spectrum of\nthought is where i try and work from so\ni'm always trying to combine strategy\nwith sincerity or assertiveness with\naffection and i feel like the more polar\nopposites you can\nput together\nthe more interesting your work becomes\nand so when i hear you say that i love\nthat i am terrible at excel so even\nafter being a consultant\nokay i avoided excel\nat accenture like the play yeah i did\nnever did it i stayed away from it i\nstuck to my strengths and skills and i\ndid a lot of powerpoints and all that\nkind of stuff but what gave you the\ncourage to make that shift in transition\nbecause you went to an incredible\ninstitution\nyou're almost trained to go off and do\nsomething in a particular way how did\nyou disconnect from any expectations any\nopinions any noise any\nany thoughts that people would have had\nlike you're probably gonna make less\nmoney you work so hard all these things\nthat you would hear\ndid you hear them and if you did how did\nyou deal with them and if you didn't how\ndid you deal with it for yourself oh i\nlove all of this and it's it's fun\nthinking back on it because it's been\nalmost 20 years now so for starters i\nshared my dream literally my dream\nwith a group of strangers who i met\ntraining for a marathon i did\na marathon through team in training we\nwould get together in central park you\nknow people from all over new york city\nall different ages all different careers\nbut you make\ngreat great friendships\ni believe um when you sweat next to\nsomebody literally and when you have\nthat's true ten miles to run together\nyou've got a lot of time to talk about\nall the things so\num this group already knew that i was\nstruggling with my happiness\nin my career but when i remember i had\nthis dream\nabout being an editor at a health and\nwellness publication and we had a 15\nmile long run that next morning on\nsaturday morning and you know a couple\nmiles in as we started warming up i\nshared it and i think maybe in my heart\ni knew that these people knew me well\nenough by now um that\nthey would be honest and open with their\nfeedback and i am so glad that they were\nlike you should do that like i could\ntotally see you doing that so this was a\ngroup of people who like knew me through\nrunning but they just got it instantly\nwith my personality and they thought it\nthey they gave me sort of the courage to\ntake the next step which was then to\nstart investigating and talking with\npeople and like we were talking about\neducating and myself and learning more\nabout the industry there was plenty of\npain and struggle and you know dozens of\ninterviews that didn't pan out and\npeople that were not willing to take a\nchance on an investment banking analyst\nand finally it did work out and it was\nthrough a ton of hard work and\nnetworking and also jay i'm going to be\nhonest it was a lot through like some\nprivilege and luck because of um where\ni've been in my life so i don't i don't\ntake any of that lightly and like i own\nit that i made the transition and then\nit was like terrifying like okay i've\nliterally put everything on a limb you\nknow i'm going out on this limb like\nwhat if i don't like it what if what if\nit's not all i think it's gonna be\nand\nit was awesome like from day one and\nthis is day one when i was like fetching\ncoffee and like processing contracts for\nfreelance writers but just like the\nenergy of creating so my first job in\nthe space was as an editorial assistant\nat self magazine um in the fitness\ndepartment and\ni it was just amazing from the start\nlike sparks were flying i was happy\nyes i was doing a lot of grunt work but\ni was learning so much and i was willing\nto roll up my sleeves and be the one who\ndidn't know and hadn't gone through the\ninternships and all of that one last\nthing i'll say is that you've heard me\ntalk about my husband matt before and we\nhave a crazy chaotic life he's got a big\nfull-time job we have three children we\nhave a puppy at home\nlike rewind back to\n23-ish year old liz who is contemplating\nthis change and matt and i have been\ntogether since her senior year of\ncollege so he's\nwe've known each other since we were 18.\nwe um we were in latin 10104 together on\nday one of college\nmatt was very much of the mind that like\ndon't think about the salary if you love\nthis as much as i think you're going to\nand you think you're going to that's all\ngoing to work out eventually so\nhaving the support of a partner who\nloved me and knew me and cared about me\nand was like\nyou've got this you can do this i know\nit's scary i know it's a lot less money\nbut\ntake the next step that was hugely\nimpactful amazing thank you for sharing\nthat with us yeah i love hearing that\nit's\ni think it's so refreshing to hear about\nthat where we can hold space for our\npartners and\nwe can\ncreate space for people to become who\nthey want to be rather than feel\npressured to or shoehorned into\nsomething else and and even though you\nmentioned privilege and luck i i do also\nbelieve there's\nyou know there is a lot to be said for\ndoing the grunt work yeah often if\nthere's privilege there's a\nfeeling of i shouldn't be doing this\nright but it sounds like in your journey\nyou've actually done a lot of that\nand been okay with that\nlet's speak about that for a second\nbecause i feel the same way yeah\nthat there isn't a substitute for that\nand often our dream job or passion is on\nthe other side of some grunt work yes\nthat feels beneath us\neven though i don't think anything's\nbeneath anyone right but often that\nperception is actually what limits\npeople and i feel that more and more\ntoday than ever before where there is a\ncertain disconnect tell us about\nhow you made that fun or how you made it\nmeaningful or how you felt at the end of\na day of getting coffees and doing\ncontracts but how did you keep going\nbecause now you're at the top of the\nchain yeah but you started at the bottom\nyeah so how did you keep feeling that\nmomentum at every stage because you\ndon't get to the top in a year or even\nfive no no it takes a minute it was very\nmuch about feeling the vibes and the\nenergy of that office and i was um\nfortunate enough to work at a place that\nthe most junior of editors were allowed\nto come into the brainstorm meetings and\nsee and hear things that's red it is and\ni um i was\njust sort of like\nso bold and courageous of like pitching\nstories and i remember waving my hand\nlike six months in saying i haven't i\nyou know i have this\nfeature story idea those are the the big\nlong stories with lots of pictures in\nthe middle of the magazine and i know\nit's crazy i know i'm brand new here but\ni actually want to be the one to write\nit and my boss let me do it i mean it\ntook a ton of hand-holding and by no\nmeans was did that mean i was like ready\nto be promoted to senior editor because\ni'd pinned a feature but working toward\nand having those moments or\nopportunities was enough to keep the\nspark and the energy alive and so to\nkind of bring it full circle since now\ni'm at a different point in my career i\ntry very hard to keep that in mind with\nmy awesome team members\nand try to nurture an environment where\nno matter where you are on the totem\npole or the masthead\nthat every single one of us has\nsomething to contribute and a great idea\nis like\nembedded in each of their their brains\num and also to give them access to\nthings that are interesting to them even\nif it's not quote unquote part of their\nlike you know little box job description\nso i'm trying to pay that forward\nbecause that was really helpful to me in\nmy career and i'm sure you feel this way\ntoo just because we are where we are in\nour professional careers doesn't mean\nthat we're not still rolling up our\nsleeves and doing the grunt work like a\nfew years ago\nwhen i started at women's health i was\nonly overseeing the print\nside of the brand and we integrated\nprint and digital and then i began\noverseeing\nthe website social media video all the\nthings and i had experience in the\ndigital space from my previous few jobs\nbut when that formally went into effect\ni actually\nasked to like build stories in the in\nour cms system and go through the seo\ntraining and like get the like 101 and\nto experience what it was like to be in\nthe system and\ni'm not like trying to pat myself on the\nback but i think it's important to as\nleaders\nto remember what like the nuts and bolts\nare like on the ground level um i think\nit gives me more sensitivity and\ncompassion for what every single team\nmember is going through every day and\nit's also just a good reminder that um\nwe all have so much to learn and there's\nthere's plenty of sweat left you know um\nno matter where we are in our careers\nyeah thank you so much for opening up\nabout that because i love what you just\nsaid that\nsweat\nis in every stage of the journey yeah\nthere is no substitute for it ever\nforget just the beginning it's it's\nnever going to go away but at the same\ntime i think for a lot of us we need to\nfind the meaning and the sweat early on\nwhen you feel the sweat isn't in stuff\nyou care about so i think you've really\ngave a lot of people a listening today\nhopefully a lot more motivation and\ninspiration to stick with it because you\nhave to look at it you have to look at\nyou have to play the long game you have\nto look at the long term when you're in\nthose situations\nnow i want to talk about your book own\nyour morning which is what we're\ndiscussing today uh i want to before we\ndive into the book which i really hope\neveryone's going to get after listening\nto this episode is\nlet's talk about when did mornings\nbecome a thing that you thought were\nimportant because people can be morning\npeople and we'll talk about what it\nmeans to be a morning person\ndiscovering that your morning is a\npowerful time to set up a successful day\nwhen did that happen for you and what\nwas it that made you convinced that\nowning your morning had to be important\nyes so this has definitely been a\njourney for me and lots of\nexperimentation to arrive at the point\nwhere i am now but\ni'm actually going to go back in time to\nthat that first job we were just talking\nabout a few minutes ago in investment\nbanking\nthat was a job where\nanything could happen and i feel like a\nlot of people can relate no matter what\nindustry you're in anything could happen\nduring the day a deadline could be\nthrown on my desk at 5 pm a friend would\ninvite me to an event like the\npossibilities of the day both good and\nbad were endless and\ni learned very quickly that um so sweat\na workout is an essential part of my day\nhas been since i was a kid um but i\nlearned that if i said okay i'm gonna\nhit the gym on my walk home from work\ntonight maybe up to nine out of ten\ntimes something would happen i would get\nderailed i wouldn't be able to get there\nand then the like perpetual\nlike uh cumulative effect of not getting\nthat workout something that powers me up\nmakes me feel clear and calm and\nconfident i felt like oh so blah you\nknow within like a week of starting that\njob it's not rocket science but i was\nlike oh i get it i have to set my alarm\nclock for way earlier and get to get\nmyself to the gym and showered etc\nbefore i hit the work day and then i'm\nso much better prepared for all the\ntwists and turns that are in store for\nme during the day and\ni cannot control what happens during the\nday none of us really can but we can for\nthe most part control what happens in\nour mornings um and so that was the\nbeginning for me that i when i got in my\nworkout and did the things that powered\nme up in the morning the whole rest of\nmy day\nwent a million times better and i've\nsort of been\nhacking this over time and researching\nit and learning about it and it's been a\nlife's passion for me and that's\nso that's my so now i'm i'm a very early\nriser\ni don't run a marathon every morning but\ni do\nhave little micro actions i take that\nnod to the things that are most\nimportant to me and i'm a much better\nhuman the rest of the day because of it\ni love it i love it and now the first\nchapter i loved the title when i first\nsaw this\nand you very emphatically\nsay to everyone\nyou are a morning person yes and i know\na lot of people hear that and go\nno i'm not yes because there's such a\ncynicism around or\nnot even a cynicism there's just uh\npessimism around our own selves of like\nwell i love staying up late and me and\nmy wife hear this all the time my wife\nwakes up at 5 a.m every day yes i wake\nup at 6 a.m\nwhen we're with our friends a lot of\npeople say to us well but we sleep at\nlike 2 a.m or 1 a.m\nand you know i'm gonna be waking up at\nlike eight or seven or whatever it may\nbe\nand this isn't about better or worse\nthis isn't about comparing this isn't\nabout oh we're more healthy or it's it's\nnot that it's a conversation about what\ndo you want from your life yes when you\ntell everyone emphatically anyone can\nbecome a morning person\ntell us what are the\nsigns that someone's a morning person\nand then what are the steps we can take\nto become one if we're sitting here\ngoing liz i'm really not a morning\nperson yes i hear you um and i'm so glad\nyou brought this up because you are\nexactly right i am also an early riser\nyou know this about me but i wake up at\n5 17. but this book is not about like\nyou need to be waking up at 5 17. there\nis no judgment whatsoever if you are in\nthe camp of i actually want to wake up\nat 8 a.m and that works for me i'm i am\nwith you my goal is to help you make the\nmost of the time you spend after you get\nout of bed\nto um set yourself up for the best day\npossible and to be honest jay and what i\nhear a lot from people is they actually\nwish they could wake up a little earlier\nbut like your friends\nthey're night owls um and it's just not\nin their nature\nso two quick things um as i share in the\nbook i was not a morning person i i very\nmuch love to sleep in especially as a\nteenager\num there is a lot of science that\nsuggests that um we have a chrono type\nso you might be more predisposed to\nenjoy popping out of bed in the morning\nor to staying up late at night so early\nbirds night owls some people get their\nrush of energy in the middle of the day\nthe cool thing is it's constantly\nchanging over time so even if\na couple of years ago\nthat's how you were or you are there\nright now it might change just naturally\nwhich is i think interesting i feel like\nthat's partially what happened to me\nbut secondly there are a lot of things\nyou can do if you do want to wake up\nearlier to set yourself up the night\nbefore um and also like what you do when\nyou get out of bed exposing yourself to\nlight we can get like this is what the\nbook really breaks down\nif that is your goal to wake up earlier\nand you think you would be healthier and\nhappier for it i this book can help you\ndo that um it really is possible i think\nalso when people think about becoming a\nmorning person they think they have to\nsleep less right and that's not the\nthing and the point is you can still\nsleep as much as you want you're just\ngoing to try and sleep earlier\nso that you can still have that amount\nof sleep and so i think a lot of people\nstruggle with the idea of being a\nmorning person\nso i feel like i've always been a\nmorning person but i'm also someone who\nreally appreciates sleep me too wants\ngood sleep\neven though people are like oh jay but\nyou were a monk can you wake up and i'm\nlike yeah but i love sleep i really and\nsometimes\ni wish i wasn't a morning person because\nsometimes i'm like i wish i could wake\nup past a.m like i can never wake up\npast seven days and so i wake up\nnaturally i haven't used an alarm clock\nfor a very long time and my body will\nwake me up uh usually between eight\nhours to eight hours fifteen minutes of\nsleep\nand i'll naturally wake up when you talk\nabout uh people becoming a morning\nperson\nwhat are some of the things that we need\nto\nstop doing in order to help us become\nmorning people is there some of the\ntechniques and tools you can share with\nus absolutely so you're exactly right as\nmuch as you wish or want to become a\nmorning person it's not just like you\nwake up\noh here i am morning person so for\nstarters let's talk about the night\nbefore which i know is a little bit\ncounter-intuitive in a book about\nmornings but i did devote a couple of\nchapters to it first of all you're\nexactly right it's important to know how\nmuch sleep you need and that can help\nyou back into what time you need to go\nto bed i know everybody is sick of\nhearing this but the the truth is\nthere's so much science about exposing\nyourself to blue light which we get from\nour devices\nin the evening\nit is going to amp up your melatonin\nproduction which makes it harder to fall\nasleep and harder to stay asleep so\nright there if you want to have an\nawesome morning tomorrow you want to\nhave a good night of sleep so like do\nyourself a favor\npick up a paper book or stop scrolling\non your phone you know ideally at least\nan hour before you hit the sack um i\nalso talk in the book about sleep\nrituals i interviewed\nall sorts of sleep experts and looked at\nall the latest and greatest research on\nthis and um there are simple things you\ncan do such as making your room a little\nbit cooler that helps you sleep more\nsoundly personally i i like to take a\nshower before i go to bed just i\nhave this vision that it's like rinsing\nthe good and bad energy off me and kind\nof creating a clean slate for me to get\nall the restoration that my night of\nsleep has in store for me let's talk\nabout alarm clocks for a second too\nso i'm sure you know this because you're\nalso super into sleep the later phases\nof our sleep cycle are called rem sleep\nand that's that's like where the magic\nhappens and all the restoration happens\nso if you're the type of person who\nsnoozes your alarm button for like an\nhour or even just a time or two you're\nactually disrupting that really powerful\nsacred time of sleep so i\nam really\nencouraging folks to think hard about\nwhat time do you have to get up like\nwhat's the latest you can get up and set\nyour alarm for that like that is your\nsleep spot and sweet spot and then back\ninto what time you need to go to bed um\nthose are just a few examples but they\nwill all help a lot they will help\ntremendously i love that that's such a\ngreat piece of advice because often we\nhear like oh yeah set your arm half an\nhour before your ideal time and actually\nwhat you just said is we're disrupting\nour own sleep yes and so i i couldn't\nagree with you more i i think it's\nunhealthy to set up too many alarms and\nalso the repetition what we don't\nrealize is we're creating a pattern\nwhere we don't listen to our alarm and\nso now that alarm is becoming less and\nless useful\nbecause you're so used to just pressing\nthe snooze button and so it's losing its\nimpact because you reject it it's like\nsomeone giving you advice and every time\nthey give you advice you're like nope\ndon't want it nope don't worry no don't\nthat person's advice becomes less and\nless useful over time so now an alarm\nbecomes less and less meaningful whereas\nif it only rings once\nand it rings at the time when you know\nyou want to be up you're going to\nrespond hopefully yes and actually a\nnote on alarm sounds um because\nrings tend to be what we choose or like\nthat angry bleeping sound and so one\nother\num\ntip or suggestion for folks who want to\nget up earlier just like have a more\ngraceful entry into their day pick a\nsound that you like that makes you happy\ni use the chimes on my iphone\n[Laughter]\nwhat i love about this book list is that\nit's so practical and i want everyone to\nsee that because often when we hear\nabout books on health and wellness\nthere's good ideas and maybe a couple of\ngood thoughts and pointers but\nliz's book is full of exercises and\ntakeaways\nand i really appreciate that when i see\nthat in a book list because i just find\nthat\nsometimes we're even like i've heard\nthat idea before oh i know that\nbut that's never been the issue yeah we\nknow we need to sleep earlier and wake\nup earlier we know that we need to put\nour phones down right but we need\nactivities and exercises to actually\nhelp us do that and i'm really glad that\nyou put some in are there any favorite\nactivities or exercises there in the\nbook that you're just like this one\nreally worked for me or this one really\nworked for a friend could you share one\nwith us the chapter about learning what\nyour personal core values are that one\nis near and dear to my heart um i think\nit's\nsets this book apart from um other\npublications or books that have dabbled\nin mornings uh because to to your point\nwhen we first started this conversation\nmy goal is not to get you up at 5 17 a.m\nlike i do my goal is to make your\nmorning more magical and what i learned\nis that when you're really clear on what\nyour values are and what fills you up\nand lights you up and then when you can\nactually take little micro actions\nnodding toward them every single morning\nyou are just prepared in ways you cannot\neven imagine to be a better parent\nemployee pet parent like sister brother\nfriend all the things so there's one\nexercise in that core values chapter i\nmean i take you through several\nactivities to sort of hone in on what\nthey are for you but the one i think is\nsimplest and fastest and you could even\nopen up your your phone right now or\nyour computer right now and do it\nwithout having to um put pen to paper is\nto take a calendar inventory and look at\nwhere you're spending your time how many\nhours a day are you in meetings\nhow much time are you spending having\nlunch\num are you working out like get clear on\nthat and that will help you hone in on\nlike one what are the things that you\nenjoy and maybe you love those meetings\nwhich is great maybe that means\ncollaboration and teamwork are one of\nyour core values but this is also going\nto help you find where you have some\nroom for improvement because maybe\nlunch isn't on your calendar and what\nare you going to do for yourself today\nyou know\ndo you need time to take a walk or to\njournal during your lunch break um do\nyou need time to make yourself a healthy\nyummy sandwich\nso\nanyway that that's one exercise that can\nhelp you get clear about what your\npersonal core values are and then the\nrest of the book is really like choose\nyour own adventure um or you could read\nthe whole thing and get ideas but say um\nfitness or meditation which i know is so\nintegral in your life are things that\nyou want to add to your morning and they\nalign with your core values then there's\nadvice for how to actually bring those\nto life every morning yeah i love that i\nwant to ask you this because\ni get asked this a lot and i'm always\nconscious of it when i'm answering the\nquestion and now i get to ask it as\nsomeone who's actually dealing with this\nso\nyou're a mother you're an\neditor-in-chief\nyou're a wife\nyou play a lot of roles in your own life\nand\ni find that in my opinion\nmothers especially with young children\nhave the hardest mornings i look at my\nmother and that's where i remember it\nfrom my mom used to\nwake us up get us dressed for school me\nand my younger sister she'd make our\nbreakfast she'd make our lunch she'd\nthen drop us to school\nand she was an independent financial\nadvisor at the same time so she was also\nhad her own mini company that she was\nsetting up so my mom was and then she'd\npick us up from school make us dinner\nand help us with our homework so i lived\nin a house with a superpower powerhouse\nmom that i love and adore\nand i just saw now when i think about\ni'm like how does anyone do all of that\nlike how is that even possible\nand today life's supposedly become\neasier and we have more support and we\nhave more help here and there we have\ntools and technology but as a mother\nas a\nexperienced professional as a successful\nprofessional\nhow are you getting through your morning\nhow are you still waking up at 5 17 or\nhow did you manage it when your kids\nwere slightly younger i want to hear\nabout the messiness yeah because i think\noften\nmothers also are the ones that end up\njudging themselves the most about not\nbeing there for their kids and then not\nfeeling like they can perform and then\nfill out all the responsibilities on\nthem too\ni'm so glad you asked about the\nmessiness because um i also want to be\nvery clear that although i've got a good\nthing going with my mornings that does\nnot mean that every morning goes as as i\nenvisioned that it would without you\nknow a little tornado here a little\ndisaster spilled milk there\num i'm also kind of chuckling because\nhere we are it's fall my kids just\nstarted the school year again which is\nawesome so all three of them are my cat\nschool they are yes so um for the first\ntime in a long time on monday the school\nbus you know it pulls up at 804 a.m and\ni'm like oh this i have to like get\neverything together like this is no joke\num because for a long time they were\ndoing school from home and you know if i\nwent to my first work meeting wearing\nleggings so be it um so\ni i knew i was going into my office i\nhad some reasons to be there so i\ncommute from brooklyn to manhattan um so\nit honestly jay it was like i had to put\nall the stuff i talked about and own\nyour morning into practice like\npractice what you preach liz um and for\nme that meant doing a lot of prep the\nnight before\npulling out what my outfit was going to\nbe having my children do the same having\nthem pack their backpacks i made the\nlunches the night before because\noh there's just like one more thing and\neverybody has opinions you know they\ndon't want the\nwhatever they\nwith my kids they're very picky jelly\nsandwiches i can't believe i'm admitting\nthat but\ndespite it all despite it all it was\nlike a morning of madness and i did get\nthem to the bus everybody got to school\nthey had lunches in their backpacks but\nwhen i got to my desk my hair was still\nwet like i was slightly disheveled and\nfrazzled and i did not feel like i\nwanted to that morning and that's okay\ntoo i i knew in that instant if i hadn't\ndone the stuff the night before if i\nhadn't been trying all the tips and\ntools that i write about in the book\nthis morning would have been\nlike you know if it was a\nseven on a scale from one to ten it\nprobably would have been a two or a\nthree and that's no fun and i have a a\njob to do that i love to um help women\nlive their healthiest happiest lives and\ni have to like show up and be ready for\nthat so\nmy mornings are not perfect i just\nposted on my instagram recently\na reel that was sort of like instagram\nversus reality like you know me like\nsipping my coffee and the reality\nversion is like my giant bernice\nmountain dog puppy is like\ntumbles in and knocks it over and i have\nto like clean it up so i get it we're we\nall that's real life like that's that's\ngonna happen to each and every one of us\nhow do you make and prioritize time for\nyourself you're leading a team with the\nkids a company like how do you actually\neven prioritize and make space for that\ntime i know you woke up at 5 17 as much\nas you can which is incredible\nbut how do you make sure that that's a\npriority when you are serving so many\nother people yes it goes back to the\nheart of this which is mornings are the\nonly time i can really control and to\num\nhave space to fill myself up and to take\ntime for myself and i i think it's a lot\nlike what you hear on airplanes about\nhow you have to put on your own oxygen\nmask yeah\nyou've stopped and filled up your own\nyour own teacup first yeah yeah i\nremember i used to just keep\ngiving and going and giving and going\nand then i asked myself this question do\ni want to give people my best yeah or do\ni want to give them my leftovers\nand i realized i was just giving people\nmy leftovers yeah\nbut these were people that i love yeah\ngive the people that you love your\nleftovers and that's when i started\nrealizing that self-preservation\nwas so important and my morning was the\nmost important time to preserve because\nof the only time that was truly sacred\nand mine and i could carve out and i\nfound that even recently this week i've\nbeen thankful enough to have a beautiful\nmorning routine it's almost back\ninto flow again yes and i'm feeling all\nthe benefits of it and i'm prioritizing\ngoing to bed earlier saying no in the\nevening\nand there's parts of me that want to go\nout and do this thing and i have to keep\npulling back\nwhat happens see here's the challenge\nwhen we talk about morning routines a\nlot of people think\noh yeah they must wake up every day at\nthe same time like we talked about the\nmessiness how do you get back on track\nyeah because i feel like we all get on\ntrack maybe for three days maybe we even\ndo the 21 days and it's meant to be a\nhabit and it will stay forever but then\nwe fall off\ni get on and fall off all the time me\ntoo\nhow do you get back on once you've\nfallen off oh i'm very glad you brought\nthis up this reminds me of one of my\nfavorite quotes which full disclosure i\ndon't know who said it or where it came\nfrom but um it's really stuck with me\nover time and the quote is let's make\nbetter mistakes tomorrow oh wow\nthat was like my mantra on on monday as\ni arrived at work with slightly damp\nhair i was like okay okay we're gonna\nlearn from this liz but um\ni i too get off track or i have\nsomething happen in the evening and it\nmeans i can't wake up at the hour i want\nto i'm always looking for reasons um to\nreset and the beautiful thing is\nit doesn't have to be a huge life\ntransition like starting a new job or\nmoving into a new home or you know a\nchange in relationship status those are\nall awesome reasons to have a reset um\nit could be as simple as the changing of\nseasons but also jay i think it could be\nas simple as like\nit's a new week or it's a new day\ntomorrow you don't have to wait for\njanuary 1st or the changing of the\nseason or\na huge massive shift in your life you\nhave the power to choose that tomorrow\nis going to be better and different and\num i would recommend\nembracing those moments of like oh that\nmorning did not go like i wanted it to\nor i stayed up way too late last night\nand nothing went like i like i hoped it\nwould have a moment and reflect on that\nlike sit with that and now now you get\nto do something about it and you get to\nmake tomorrow better yeah i love that i\nthink what you're saying so true that\njudgment and guilt don't get you\nanywhere nope\nwhen i when i judge myself or i guilt\nmyself because this has been such a bad\nweek\ni'm now just creating more guilt and\ncreating more judgment\nand then now i'm feeling worse and now i\ndon't feel like getting up tomorrow\nit's a it's like a death spiral you're\njust gonna get it's such a vicious cycle\nand it just keeps going and so i find\nthat actually me saying yeah i gave\nmyself a week off last week but tomorrow\nis gonna be different totally it's such\na healthier way to move and make\nprogress\none of the things i think i love that\nyou talk about in this book is power\nbreakfasts\ni love talking about\npractical things to actually do eat in\nthe morning i'd love to hear the science\nabout it\ni struggled for a long time with\nbloating in the morning and so for a lot\nof time i'd wake up and i'd eat really\nwell at night i don't eat late i\nconsider myself to have a really good\ndiet but i think over time i haven't\nnecessarily\nbeen mindful and so things have happened\nbut i remember waking up feeling bloated\ni remember waking up feeling no matter\nwhat i ate in the morning i would end up\nfeeling you know just not good\nand then finally and the very recently\nthe two things that solved it was celery\njuice\nand\nchia seed pudding cool so chia seeds in\nthe morning and celery juice has\ntransformed my life i feel the celery\njuice is almost like a cleansing i feel\ncompletely clean and internally and\nfresh and then the chia seed pudding is\nreally grounding and so to me that's\nreally worked for me i wanted to hear\nwhat you found through the science of\nbreakfast because i think so many people\nskip breakfast or they grab a bagel on\nthe way or they're eating on you know\nwe're not commuting anymore but i think\nbreakfast is an untalked about meal or\nunheard of nowadays yes i love the\nbreakfast chapter in the book and i love\nactually\nthe morning magic essay that was penned\nby\nthis woman kate merker who oversees\nfood for women's health there's a\nmorning magic essay in every single\nchapter but kate talks about the ritual\nof making toast for her family and her\nkids um and she talks about how it fills\nthem up the smell of it the ritual of it\nthey put\nabout chia pudding is that it's gonna\nlook different for every single one of\nus yeah that's why i asked because i was\nlike i don't think everyone's eating\nthey're no and i get asked this a lot as\nthe editor of women's health like oh do\nyou intermittent fast or um do you skip\nbreakfast and should i be should i be\neating before my workout or right\nafterward and\njay there's like there's a study\nfor every everything and\nwhat it really comes down to is what\nworks for you and you felt icky in the\nmorning you felt off and so you probably\ntried all sorts of different things\nand that's what you have to do you have\nto experiment i i will never say to\nsomebody yeah you should do your workout\nfast in a fasted state which yes there\nis science that suggests you'll go into\nthe fat burning zone more quickly if you\ndo sweat\nwithout eating first however\nif you feel weak\nor you can't give a hundred percent in\nyour workout because you didn't put any\ncalories in your body then who cares\nwhat that research study said it's not\ngoing to make a difference but maybe\nyou're like me and i actually i feel\nlike i get stomach cramps and i feel off\nif i eat right before i work out but it\ntakes trial and error and\nexperimentation and it might take trying\nsome different\nsome different foods and\njust seeing what what works best for\nyour body but like you over time i've\nexperimented with all sorts of different\nmeals and the timing of them and what\nworks best for me is making myself a\nsmoothie right when i get home from the\ngym\nso this is like while i'm making my kids\ntheir breakfast which might be scrambled\neggs it might be\ncereal and apples it could be a little\ndifferent every day for me i like to\nhave a banana with some\npeanut butter powder and some whole milk\nand ice and sometimes i'll add cinnamon\nor some other\nanti-inflammatories like that but it\nit's um\nit fills me up it's satiating it feels\nrefreshing after i've moved my body and\ngotten all hot and sweaty and i feel\nlike energized and ready to tackle the\nday but it took me a long time to arrive\nat that that meal that to learn that\nlike this is what helps me really\nperform at my peak and all the hours\nthat follow i'm so glad you made that\npoint and hearing the editor-in-chief of\nwomen's health say that is so refreshing\nand helpful because i think that's\nexactly it that none of us are the same\nright none of us have the same goals or\ncore values as you said right and\ntherefore fat burning may not be your\npriority your priority may be feeling\ngood right uh your priority may be\ngetting energy you're probably maybe\nlosing weight or gaining weight whatever\nit is like it's just your core values\nand your priority has to be and we have\nto be able to experimenting i think\nthat's what i'm hearing from you is just\nhow many different types of things have\nyou tried i remember trying oatmeal i\nremember trying cereal i remember trying\navocado toast\ni remember trying just dates and nuts\nand and finally i found a win with this\nand i feel so good about it again i i\ndon't go around saying hey everyone\nshould do this i think you should try\nthese two things that i've found to be\nbeneficial and celery juices lots of\nbenefits but at the same time you may\nhave it and be like jay i feel terrible\nafter that right and and i love that\nyou're just giving us permission to say\njust try stuff yes and stop thinking\nthat it has to be this way yes well that\nis very much the ethos of women's health\nis we are we are determined to help our\nreaders live healthier happier lives and\nour job is to give you science-backed\nexpert-based\num\nsoundly researched ideas and tips and\nsuggestions but the truth is the magic\nhappens when something resonates for you\nand you decide to try it and then it it\nunlocks a whole new part of you you feel\nbetter you feel happier and that's going\nto look different for every single\nperson yeah absolutely you talk a lot in\nthe book about obviously a journaling\npractice too\nwe've spoken about this before\nand i am such a big believer in\njournaling i think it's such a powerful\nuh practice my wife as well owes\njournaling she talks about journaling in\nthe same way as you do she feels so\nconnected to it yeah and she will often\ndo a lot of free journaling where she\njust\nlet everything out and everything go and\ni want to hear how can someone start\na journaling practice if they feel\nscared by it yes and i identify with\nthose people because it seemed like just\none more thing to take on um\nbut\ni have aspired to journal for many years\nand i\nthis summer it really clicked like as a\nnon-negotiable\nritual that i do every single morning um\nand the way i wrapped my head around it\nwas by giving myself permission to stop\nafter two sentences if i didn't have\nanything else to say or just wasn't\nfeeling it um\nand that was like the game changer for\nme and i think you can apply that to a\nlot of different areas in your life like\neven workouts i've told people just just\ngo to the gym or start the workout for a\nfew minutes and if you feel just oh i'm\nnot feeling it today you can stop why\nfour minutes where did you come over so\nfour minutes there's actually very cool\nscience about four minutes\nphysiologically that's how long it takes\nfor our body to acclimate to the work of\na physical exertion\nyour oxygenation changes your\njoints and muscles lubricate\nyou essentially you warm up so\nit's the difference between being warmed\nup and coming in cold and\nnine times out of ten when i make it to\nthe four minutes\npoint on those days i just am not\nfeeling motivated and don't feel like it\nby four minutes in i'm like but i feel\nlike a new person i've got this and i go\nahead and do the whole workout same\nthing with journaling though some\nmornings i'm like i don't have time i\ndon't have anything to say\nit's okay liz just two sentences is\nenough where did you get into two how\ndid you figure out two i literally\npulled it out of thin air it felt like\num\nlike\ni gave it some effort but also short\nenough that it didn't overwhelm me and\njay i have never stopped at two\nsentences\nit always goes beyond that once you get\ngoing i love those two pieces of advice\ni think it's so important we always set\nlike a a target\nbut what we need to do is set a minimum\nyes right it's like the opposite it's\nlike we're always used to saying like\nthis i want to write a page a day\nbut we don't just say well let me just\nwrite two lines\nit's like a reframing of that yeah it's\na reframing and actually you're so right\nthat you develop more confidence more\nexcitement more enthusiasm when you\nbreak what you thought you were going to\ndo\nrather than when you fall short of a\ntarget so if you even wrote nine lines\nout of ten that would feel worse than if\nyou stopped at two\nyes i love that one of my favorite\nstudies is about um the power of\naccomplishments and taking a moment to\nreflect upon them it's a psychology\nprinciple\nthe psychology of momentum\nwill be extremely powerful and\neverything else you tackle the rest of\nthe day absolutely yeah i was watching a\nvideo recently\nwhere one of my friends jason goldberg\nhe was talking about a study in the\nolympics and he was saying that people\nwho get bronze are happier than those\nwho get silver\nbecause people who got silver were so\nclose to me it's so fascinating that\nthat pains us so much that we feel less\nhappy whereas when you got bronze you're\nkind of happy because i made it to the\npodium yes and so i feel like every day\nwe need to just make it to the podium\nand and not try and aim for this number\none because when you aim for that number\none you kind of just set yourself up for\ni'm not saying we shouldn't aim high\nthat's that's not the point i'm making\ni'm just saying that on a daily basis\nyou don't need to be number one you just\nneed to make it to the podium i uh this\nis gonna become a new liz mantra make it\nto the podium i love it i'm obsessed\nwith that yeah it's from that study that\nthat he shared in the video and i\nthought that was fascinating uh one of\nthe things that i love in this book that\nyou talk about also\nis winning your weekend yes uh and when\ni read this i couldn't agree with you\nmore because\ni think i think about that every week\nwhere i'm like the quality of my week is\nbased on the quality of my weekend and\nthe quality of my weekend is based on my\nweek and as monks we were taught that\nthe quality of your day is based on your\ntwo hours of meditation and the quality\nof your two hours of meditation is based\non your day yeah and so they're\nsymbiotic yeah and often i think we look\nat our weekends as a way of making up\nfor the week\nhow do you win your weekend and how does\nthat transform the week definitely um\nweekends are so powerful and i'll just\nspeak for me personally weekends are the\ntime when i actually i do not set that 5\n17 alarm i'm going to sleep as late as\nmy kids and dog let me\nbut i i am also\nin many ways bringing to life those core\nvalues that i bring to life every single\nweekday morning too um i want to spend\nquality time with my kids\ni like to go to a farmer's market and\ntake the time to you know like pick up\nthe fruits and veggies and meet some of\nthe the farmers who are there and think\nabout what what do i want to cook this\nweek get excited about putting um all\nthe the fall apples into a beautiful\nbowl on my kitchen counter top and the\nother thing is jay for me on weekends i\nhave to be clear about\nall the plans and invitations and things\nthat could come my way and it's so easy\nto be like well that sounds like fun you\nknow this party or this event or this\ndinner and that stuff can be really fun\nand being social and being around people\nis wonderful and can have tons of health\nbenefits but i also try to be really\ncareful about not overextending myself\nand making the weekend like a new\ndifferent form of hustling i have to\nbuild in time to just\nchill and relax and sometimes that means\nsaying no to going out to dinner with\nfriends you know just being honest that\nwhat what my body and heart and soul\nneed are just some like alone time\nwatching the latest marvel movie with my\nmy kids and my husband and petting my\ndog how have you got better at saying no\ni think that's something that so many of\nus struggle with and when you talk about\nowning your morning winning your weekend\nsaying no\nis such a big part of that because the\nnight before like i know me and my wife\nbecause we've found our morning groove\nright now we're making sure that we're\nin bed by 9 30 in the evening because\nthat's really important to us but we're\nsaying no to so many things it's it's so\ntrue um i think a lot of us feel like to\nlive fuller happier lives we need to add\nthings and you're exactly right removing\nsome things and\ndecluttering um is just as powerful and\nimportant so\ni as a um a lifelong people pleaser who\nsquirms at the thought of somebody being\nmad or upset or disappointed\nit's taken me a long time to learn this\nthat\nthe the kindest and most authentic thing\nto do is to say no quickly and not let\nthe invitation sit there and fester\nwhere it's occupying your brainpower\nprobably stressing out your friend who\ninvited you and is like what's up why\nisn't jay responded to me like can he\ncome does he want to come you know and\nyou don't have to\ngo into the um\nthe paragraph long reason why you can't\nbe there you can just simply say thank\nyou so much for the invitation i'm\nreally sorry that i have a conflict and\ni can't come but like i'm looking\nforward to seeing you blah blah blah\nyour version of that in your own words\nin an authentic way but um that's been\nvery powerful for me is rather than\nletting it sit and thinking about it and\nthen there's like more more drama and\ninternal like oh\ni can't say no now that's been you know\num just handle it in the moment and that\nthat does require that you get clear\nabout what your weekend is going to look\nlike are you going to have like one\nsocial commitment um\nis next weekend one where you actually\njust need to lay low and not have any um\nand then when the invitation comes in or\nthe thing pops up you're more prepared\nto answer in the moment and imagine like\nthe\nthe amount of space that that will\nrelease in your brain and the emotional\nenergy it unlocks for you to not have\nthat sitting around hanging over you i\nlove that i love that i want to\nencourage everyone who's been listening\nand watching today to make sure you grab\na copy of own your morning we'll have\nthe link in the caption and everywhere\nelse and of course i really want to see\nwhat you're all learning from this\nsession so i want you to tag me and liz\nand i want you to hashtag own your\nmorning liz you've been so generous with\nyour time\nuh i want to end as we do with every\non-purpose episode with the final five\nor the fast five okay which are the\nrapid fire questions where you have to\nanswer every question in one word or one\nsentence maximum so you have a bit of\nflexibility oh i like i like a challenge\ngood i i know you do so the first\nquestion that i have for you is\nwhat is the best piece of morning\nroutine advice you've ever received\nuh i mean i literally wrote a book about\nit\nyou're making me say one word pick one\nokay\ni'll say one word one sentence yeah okay\nlight light light\nokay do you want me to expand yeah when\nyou'd expect a sentence yeah it is\nscientifically proven that exposing\nyourself to light asap after waking\nnaturally makes you feel more energetic\nand alert i love that beautiful\ni wake up at 6 00 a.m so and you wake up\nat 5 17 when it's not very light i mean\nit's this is getting more challenging as\nwe're moving into um winter time and\nit's dark for the morning but light like\neven a bright light from a lamp um\nthat's good for you too yeah i love that\nquestion number two what's the worst\npiece of morning routine advice you've\never heard\nthe worst piece is that there's\nevery single one of us yeah that's a\ngreat answer third question how would\nyou describe your current purpose\nand question number four what's the most\nrecent thing you've been tinkering with\nor playing around or experimenting with\nin your morning routine\nwow i love that\nto take me down a notch when i'm a\nlittle overly adrenalized and hyped up\nthat's brilliant i really like that one\nthat's so awesome i think we all listen\nto the same songs again on the same\nplaylist so important i love that okay\nfifth and final question if you could\ncreate one\nmorning routine habit that everyone in\nthe world had to do\nwhat would it be\ni think we could change the world if\neverybody began their day with gratitude\ni personally write a gratitude list it\ncan be short it can be long but that is\nsome incredible energy to begin your day\nwith i love that liz plus for
