    "transcript": "we always look at jealousy as a negative\nthing if we see a jealous person we say\noh they're toxic stay away from them\nthat's negative behavior maybe it's\ngossip based\nand what i've learned to realize over\ntime is that jealousy can actually show\nyou what you want to pursue\nbut at the same time that only works by\nlimiting your options so you could also\nbe just be jealous of everyone because\nyou want to be everything\nbut if you actually discover your\nstrengths and your skills you start to\nrealize that that's that's reachable i\ncan do that and so when you find\nyourself being jealous or envious of\nsomeone\nuse that as an indicator as a signal of\nis that something i really want or is\nthat something that's just attractive\nbecause it can just be a shiny object\ntoo but i think it can be a nudge in the\nright direction"
