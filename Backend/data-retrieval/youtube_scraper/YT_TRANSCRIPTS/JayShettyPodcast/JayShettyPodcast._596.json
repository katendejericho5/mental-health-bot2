it\ntry it because you're gonna rise to the\noccasion\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you who

the most and pick their brain\nand today's guest is someone that i've\nwanted to do that with for a long long\ntime i remember reading his books years\nago we've been in touch for quite some\ntime to try and get this scheduled and\ntoday i'm so grateful because he's made\nthe effort to be here physically present\nwith us in the studio he's none other\nthan robert greene the author of some of\nmy

notebook\nout for it's one that you want to get\nyour pen and pencil out for and i'm so\ngrateful robert thank you so much for\nbeing here thank you so much for having\nme jay my pleasure no it's an honor to\nhave you here honestly i've been looking\nforward to it me too me too so i mean\ni'll tell everyone the story me and\nrobert were about to record three or\nfour months back\nand we both had a friendly conversation\nand i think you were asking me where i\nlive and i was saying i live in la and i\ni live in hollywood and you were saying\nyou live in los feliz and we were like\nwell we we're like 15 minutes away and\nso we said let's do it in person and i'm\nso happy that we made that possible and\nall the effort you took to be here so\nthank you yeah my pleasure i love\ngetting out of the house so it's\nactually fun for me amazing well\nyou know your work is legendary\nit's you know to say it's a best-selling\nbook or anything is an understatement\nyour work is\nimpacted the way people think and live\nand make decisions and people look to\nyour books as law books and textbooks\nthey don't see them as\njust story books or a quick read they're\nreference books almost\nand\ni guess my biggest question to start off\nis where did your obsession with power\ncome from you know i guess is you'd have\nto go back to my early childhood\num\nmaybe you know i felt as a child a\nlittle bit helpless around my parents\nin some ways i was a very sensitive boy\ni still have that that issue they were\ngreat parents but they weren't the most\novertly affectionate\nand so i was always kind of\nwondering and observing them and trying\nto be careful around them i didn't do\nanything to upset them so i became kind\nof an observer of people\nand my main thing was\nas sort of a protective device to not be\nheard and to be able to have a degree of\ncontrol over the people around me so i\ndidn't feel like i was\nyou know going to get yelled at or\nsomething like that and then as i\nentered the work world\num you know i kind of it was sort of a\nrude awakening for me because\ni had studied\nyou know literature and languages my\nmajor was ancient greek\nand\nyou know things that are completely\nimpractical in this world and then i\nenter the work world with all of my\ndreams my illusions my fancies and it's\nlike slapped in the face this is not\nwhat i expected\ni had many different jobs i lived in new\nyork i did journalism\nthen i lived in europe i traveled around\nbecause i couldn't really find out what\ni wanted to do i worked in a hotel in\nparis i taught english in barcelona i\ndid construction work in greece on an\nisland in greece i worked in a\ntelevision company in london\nyou name it i did it and i had all kinds\nof bosses i saw all kinds of power games\nand manipulations going on and so taking\nthat knowledge from my childhood of\nobserving people seeing how they operate\nseeing what's really going on behind\ntheir minds because people wear masks\nthey don't tell you what they're\nthinking they don't want to admit that\nthey want power that they want to\ncontrol you or manipulate you in some\nway and so i was always kind of a\ndecipherer of people and what their real\nthoughts were and to me figuring people\nout is a form of power\nand then i worked in hollywood which is\nkind of the ultimate power environment\nyou know because nobody in hollywood\nwants to admit that their goal is power\nthey want to make it all worry about art\nor about creativity\nliberal causes blah blah blah but really\nthey wanted power it was the most power\nhungry environment i had ever witnessed\ni observed a kind of a double face think\nquality going on on the one hand they\nwould present this front to their\nemployees to everyone else but really\nthey were practicing all of these\ngames these kind of power games going on\nand so that's what sort of inspired my\nfirst book the 48 laws of power because\nmy my sympathies are more on the side of\nthe underdog\ni don't have a sympathy for a hollywood\nexecutive for a michael ovitz for a ceo\nof a company i have sympathy for the\npoor guy like myself who is thrown into\nthese environments doesn't understand\nhim is a bit naive right it doesn't know\nthe rules of power that these\ngenerally white men at least back in\nthat era seem to know\ninstinctively\nand so\ni wanted to like reveal\nto everyone what goes on behind closed\ndoors the real games of power that\npeople play\nso it's not that i'm obsessed with it\nbut i feel like people like myself are\noften too naive they don't understand\nwhat they're about to get into they\ndon't understand how rough and brutal\nthe world can be\nand i actually wanted to kind of help\nthem and reveal the kinds of things that\ni learned the hard way i love that\nlearning journey because so much of what\nwe seek are the gifts and gaps from our\nparents you know whether they give us a\ngift and we chase that gift or they they\nhave a gap in their parenting we try and\nfill that gap and it's amazing how\neverything seems to\nreally really stem from that where\nhow do you define power in the way you\nguide people in this book towards power\nbecause i think\npower has\nchanged power has shifted its meaning\nhas evolved and i wanted to know what\nyou define as power well people have\nthis misconception of power they think\nit has to do with you know ceos and\npresidents and it's kind of ugly and\ndirty i have a much different conception\nof it it's something that has to do with\nyour daily life now i have the idea that\nmuch in our lives we cannot control\nyou can throw a number out 95 percent\nyou can't control disease you can't\ntroll the people that you meet it's by\nchance that you met your wife and you\nfell in love and you ended up marrying\nher you kind of fall into jobs there's\nmuch in life that is way beyond your\ncontrol but there's a margin that you\ncan control right and it's mostly about\nyour relationships it has to do with\nyour children\nyour spouse your partners your\ncolleagues at work your bosses\nand the feeling that you have no control\nover them that they can do whatever they\nwant that you have an idea and you want\nto sell it to them or you want somebody\nto stop their annoying behavior and you\nhave can't control them they're\ncompletely oblivious they won't listen\nto anything you say\nis to me the worst feeling for a human\nbeing to have\nright where animals that need that sense\nof i can influence my environment i can\ninfluence the people around me and the\nsense of helplessness is a very very\nprimal feeling it's like when you take\nan animal and if you have dogs or cats\nand you put them on their belly they\nfeel exposed they feel terrified and\nthat's when they attack you well that\nposition is like being on our belly i\ncan't control my teenage son he's into\ndrugs my husband or my wife isn't\nlistening to me ugh my boss is doing you\nknow you want the ability to be able to\nat least defend yourself or to have some\ninfluence or power over them it's a\nsmall margin because there's much you\ncan control but to the degree that you\ncan have some of that power and you can\nand then there's one other aspect\nprobably the most important aspect that\ni'm forgetting here is power over\nyourself\nself-mastery right because a lot of the\nproblems that you have in life you can't\nreally control yourself\nyou're you're subject to all these\nemotions these moods these things that\ngrab you that obsess you that possess\nyou your mind has these recurrent\nthoughts you have no self-control and it\ndrives you crazy you have a habit you\nwant to get rid of you take some program\nsome class and three months later you're\nback at it\nah you know what is it so the sense that\nyou can control yourself\nto a degree and the sense that you can\nhave some influence over people is power\nand the more you have it the greater the\nfeeling you have because you can get\navoid that helplessness that makes all\nof us kind of crazy yeah i really love\nhow you\ngrounded that definition of power in\nself-mastery because\nthat seems to be where everything else\nloses control you know it's like if\nwe're out of control then\neverything seems out of control and so\nso much of our\nlust or envy or greed or anger has the\nability to\ndistract and derail us completely when\nthere's no\nself-power right and why do you think it\nis you mentioned that why do you think\nit is that we all have an and i can\nrelate to this\nand i think you know when you referred\nto yourself as as someone who struggled\nand you know couldn't figure it out and\nwas surprised by what happened and\nyou know i i would say the same that you\nknow i grew up uh being bullied for\nbeing overweight and i was the one a few\nindian people in my entire area that i\ngrew up in in london we're in london i\nwas in north london so majority area of\ntottenham and wood green\nyeah which are not considered\nsouth asian areas\nand when i look back at that time in my\nlife\ni also feel like i\nat one point in my life was an underdog\nand\nwhy do you think it is that so many\nunderdogs have such a negative view of\npower i feel like so many people today\nwhether they consider themselves\nunderdogs or not\nwhen we think of words like power or\ninfluence\nwe think of them as negative things we\nthink of them as being as you said like\ndirty or toxic or plagued\nwhy is that and\nhow do you healthily\ntransform your belief around power well\nthat was sort of what i wrote the book\nabout but a lot of it comes from our\nculture which i think plays a very often\na very negative role in our lives it\nteaches us the wrong kinds of lessons\nand so back in the days when it was\ntelevision now it's whatever you watch\nand whatever medium you know all of the\nvillains in the world were these power\nhungry people and in black coats with\ncars with the with the windows kind of\nblacked out you know and doing all sorts\nof evil ugly things that's what we think\nof as power it's like a cultural trope\nthat we've all digested you know this\nkind of machiavellian character who's\nout to kind of destroy people\nnobody thinks of power in a positive\nsense and it's madding it drives me\ncrazy it's incredibly hypocritical\nwhen self-help books are written\nand they're trying to say that\npower or ambition or influence are ugly\nthings when the writer himself or\nherself is actually a very powerful\nperson who has influence who has control\nit's awful it drove me crazy it's why i\nwrote the book\nyou know so i try and tell people look\nwho's one of the great saints that we\nhold up in our culture mahatma gandhi\nright i certainly venerate him he's an\namazing person and i read very deeply\nabout gandhi and i wrote about him in my\nthird book the strategies of war\nand his goal was to throw the english\nout of india so they could finally\nexperience in independence because the\npeople had been subjugated for so long\nthat they had forgotten what it meant to\nbe human in a way right a very noble\ngoal but he realized quickly on how\ndifficult it would be\nso he had to be strategic\nand so he had things like the salt march\nwhere he very much plotted in advance\nthat he knew\nusing his method of civil disobedience\nwhere once the police came out you were\nnot to fight you were to accept them if\nthey beat you you accepted it you never\nfought no violence\nbut he knew\nthat that back in the day before\ntelevision that the media the newspapers\nwould cover their\ntheir english bobbies or whomever they\nwere beating these these people up and\nit would play horribly in england\nbecause people in england thought that\nthey were very liberal and open-minded\nthat they weren't these horrifying\nimperialists he was strategic he knew\nthat he had to get maximum publicity for\nvery ugly confrontations years later\nmartin luther king another icon who also\npracticed civil disobedience did utilize\nthe same tactics in his campaigns in\nselma and montgomery at one point\nit was very controversial he had\nchildren\nof the age of 13 14 involved in this\nmarch\nthat they would get beaten up people\nwere in his group cascading for this how\ncould you be like that he knew that that\nwould play on television now to the\nwhite audiences around america they'd be\nhorrified if you want power in this well\nif you are fighting for a cause if you\nwant some kind of justice you have to be\nstrategic you have to think like that\nyou have to think in terms of power\npeople just don't give themselves up\nyou know if we have the metoo movement\nnow men are not going to give up all\ntheir control in a place like hollywood\nyou have to hit them you have to be\nstrong you have to be forceful it's a\npower game and i can't stand people who\nare naive who think that just being\nthemselves just being virtuous is going\nto get what they want in life if you're\ngoing to fight for something you have to\nbe able to meet the enemy on their terms\nof power so that's sort of how i like to\nexplain to you there's nothing unhealthy\nabout gandhi or or mlk as far as i know\nyeah no thank you so much for sharing\nthat perspective i it i definitely feel\nvery aligned with that i've\noften said to people when people have\nasked me like jay how have you\ncreated what you've created or how are\nyou building your work and businesses\nand i've always said that to me\nsincerity and strategy have to go\ntogether sure that uh\ndata and intuition have to go together\nlike it's you can't have one or the\nother and so to only be sincere\nand loving and compassionate and kind\nwell actually a lot may not happen\nand to only be strategic and influential\nand powerful you may end up lose your\nsoul lose your soul exactly well\nbeautifully said like you lose your soul\nbut when you have two together and it is\na fine balance and it is a\nyou're always juggling both and you\ndon't get the perfect amount you're\nalways in percentages and proportions\nbut\nthe idea that\nyou you can't ignore this side there's a\nbeautiful quote you reminded me of from\nmartin luther king where he said those\nwho love peace\nneed to learn to organize themselves as\nwell as those who love war right and i\nthink that's beautiful yeah and i think\nthat's what we're saying that and that's\nwhat i saw when i\nfirst started to share the messages i'd\nlearned from living as a monk\nand the vedas and that tradition for me\nit was if i'm not strategic about this\nor if i'm not\nfocused or organized about this then i\nmight as well give up now\nbecause it's not going to spread itself\nno and so i'm really happy to hear your\nperspective on that how do the laws\nbecome things that you use\nversus getting lost in what we just said\nof losing your soul\nin power now driving you because i\nalmost feel like when you start using\nthe rule the laws\nyou end up feeling a sense of power and\nthen that power can consume you often it\ncan become toxic some people start that\nway they start with an agenda and they\nutilize the powers wrongly but want to\nspeak of someone who\nstarts off in a more noble cause but\nthen now the laws are using them versus\nthem using the law you have to\nunderstand there's an offensive and a\ndefensive side to the laws okay and i\nalways tell people who have these kind\nof compunctions about\ncrush your enemy totally i don't want to\ndo that neither do i okay so if you're\nreading a law and it kind of triggers\nthis\nah i can't do that then it's not\nsomething you should do anyway it's\ngonna it's not gonna fit your way of\ndoing you have a certain style a certain\nbelief system\ncertain values i'm not telling you to go\noutside your values\nbut look at that law which is probably\nthe ugliest in the whole book crush your\nenemy totally and understand that in the\nbusiness world that law prevails 95\npercent of the time when a company like\ngoogle or any tech company has an enemy\ntheir mo their\ngoal is to get rid of them completely to\nbuy them out so they have no competitors\nright look at amazon but even smaller\nbusinesses dealing with rivals it's a\ndynamic in the business world so you\nneed to be aware of it and not be naive\nyou don't have to practice it but you\nneed to be aware of it other laws are\njust simply trying to show you\nwhat how you know we're we're animals\nthat kind of base our opinions a lot on\nwhat we see and perceive we don't often\nthink too deeply we kind of take people\nbased on their appearances\nso there's a law of power in there\ncalled always say less than necessary\nvery kind of common sense law and the\nidea is that if you're in a meeting with\npeople\nthat man or woman who talks less\ngenerally has an aura of power\nparticularly a boss they seem enigmatic\nmysterious and when they do something\nsay something everybody's hanging on\ntheir words what did that mean would say\nwhereas people who talk a lot give the\nimpression that they're weak they signal\nweakness they can't control themselves\nso they can't control themselves how can\nthey control anything in the business\nworld right\nso we sense that in people so be aware\nof that you're probably talking too much\nin a lot of circumstances and maybe you\ncan control that and so this is kind of\na way of defending yourself in an\nenvironment where people will tend to\nsee you as weak if you can't have any\nself-control right so there are if you\nsee that a law that's ugly that makes\nyou skin crawl you don't want to do it i\nhave no problem with that i there are a\nlot of laws i don't practice in there\nbut you need to be aware of them you\nneed to be aware that other people are\npracticing them so that you don't become\ntheir victim then there are other laws\nthat yes you should practice right like\nappealing to people's self-interest when\nyou're trying to influence them or\nor despise the free lunch where you\nlearn to pay for things and be generous\nwith your time and your money for people\nso it depends on the law but i hate it\nwhen people say oh what an evil book\nthose are people who haven't read it\nbecause the half the laws are more than\nhalf have nothing evil about them and\nthe other half are about opening your\neyes i never say you have to practice\nthis i'm just making you aware of\nreality of what goes on in the world is\nit possible to and and i agree with you\nfully i i think if you read the book you\nyou can't see it as an evil book or a\ncontrolling or manipulative book at all\nyou know that's and you can tell clearly\nit's not your intention it's not who you\nare like and and that's what i want to\nask you how much of a role does\nintention play\nin\nsome of this work because i i wonder if\nyou\nthought about that when you were writing\nit do you think about it now in terms of\nhow your intention\nfits in with the law\nor your reason why you're doing it the\ncause behind the law that you're using\ndoes that impact or affect the quality\nof the effectiveness of the lord does it\nmake a lot\nwork better does it does it have any\npower does intention have any power you\nmean if your intention is for something\ngood or for something correct correct\nwell it depends unfortunately in the\nworld today and you know i've had this\nexperience and we read about in the news\na lot of people\nwho have a dark side whom we might\nconsider rather immoral in their\nbehavior get pretty damn far right yeah\nand they use these laws and they don't\npay any consequences so there's no kind\nof ultimate justice in this world\nalthough there might be in a religious\nsense i don't deny that at all but in a\nsecular world there's no consequences to\npay for it so people\nif they have a lot they do crush your\nenemy totally and that's their goal they\nmight end up being even better at it\nthan somebody who doesn't really want to\ngo there but then kind of tries it\nhalf-heartedly right\nso um i'm not here to say that\njustice and goodness always prevails\nbut the people who have those kind of\nintentions the true sharks in the world\nthey don't need my book\nright\nthey know it it's in their dna they grew\nup at the age of five or six seven it's\nalready been implanted in them and i\nwrite about that in my last book the\nlaws of human nature you can see that in\ncertain people at a very early age\nthe great therapist psychoanalyst\nmelanie klein identified the greedy baby\nat the age of six months wow that was\nalready sucking so hard on the mother's\nbreasts and she saw that this this type\nof baby turned into the type that was\nactually very aggressive in life so it's\ninbred very early on people like that\nhave patterns of behavior they cannot\ncontrol but those people with those kind\nof intentions who are very manipulative\ni believe very firmly they don't get\nultimately they hit a wall\nthey piss so many people off they don't\nknow the soft side of power they have no\nself-control because all they know is\ngrab grab grab push push push they don't\nknow when to yield they don't know when\nto step back\nright they've only learned one way and\nso that becomes their downfall what i'm\nhearing from you is that\nthe intention it's in one sense\ncould could weaken it if it wasn't\nused effectively but\nyou know you're also saying that if\nsomeone does have a positive intention\nor a good intention then it is likely\nthat they may be happier with that power\nto some degree definitely oh definitely\nand i think that's what i find so\nfascinating i see what you mean yeah\nright does it like yeah it's the\nrelationship i i guess we both know a\nlot of powerful people who would\nconsider themselves to be not happy yeah\nand and i i ask myself then what is the\nrole of power in the world\nbecause i feel like a lot of people in\nyour situation when they didn't feel any\npower at home or they didn't feel a\nsense of significance at home often\npower or significance become pursuits\nfor pleasure and for happiness but power\ndoesn't lead to happiness what does\npower lead to well i'm not sure i\ncompletely agree with that because under\nthe way i've defined power where you\nfeel like\nokay so let's say you have a spouse\nwho has a very annoying pattern of\nbehavior\nall right and in my books i train you\nbeing direct and yelling at them never\nworks it never works you have to learn\nthis the the art of insinuation of\npersuasion which often is stepping back\nwhich often involves teaching them a\nlesson mirroring their behavior right\nand so\nyour intention\nis not ugly or or bad it's that you you\ncan't live with this person unless they\nalter their behavior right and so\nyou you think about it you strategize a\nlittle bit you take some steps\nand it works yes got it right i\nunderstand yeah so in a relationship\noften that you know can spell into some\ndegree of power or let's say\num you ha you're in a nasty divorce case\nand there's a child involved and your\nemotions are to screw that man or woman\nwho is so mean to you\nand you're gonna have this nasty fight\nand then you realize oh my god this\nchild that i love is really gonna suffer\nfrom it and then you step back and you\ngo no\ni have to not just react it's gonna it's\ngonna lead to some an uglier cycle of\nbattles i need to be a little bit more\nstrategic about this i need to pursue\nthis in a softer way right and so you\nend up feeling better about yourself so\ni'm not saying all the laws are gonna\nmake you feel better about yourself but\nthe degree\nthat you can control your environment\nwhere you're not helpless at work or in\na relationship or with your children\nwill give you a degree of happiness it\nwon't fulfill you the way maybe that's\nthe difference here it will give you a\nsense of satisfaction it will relieve\nthat anxiety it won't make you fulfilled\nthe way your career will if it's done\nproperly but it will\nhelp you lose that continual gnawing\nanxiety that you can't change people\nthat you can't change yourself so i do\nthink there is an element\nof happiness however you wanted to yeah\ninvolved with power no and i think i\nthink that's why going back to your\ndefinition of power and that's why i\nasked\nashley eleon that's that's exactly it\nthat when i was referring to my point i\nwas saying that\nwhen people have a negative intention\nand their definition of power is warped\nthen power can end up feeling\ndissatisfying when you get there because\nit it didn't really get you what you\nwanted right right because you couldn't\nforce someone to love you or you\ncouldn't force this person\nbut but actually when it was done in a\nin the way you're saying like when you\nrealize that actually if i don't exert\nthis power\ni'm actually using this power to save\nthis situation to to enable this\nsituation to improve i think that's if\nyeah i think that's what i was\nuh pointing to and so yeah we're on the\nsame page there's one a couple of\nuh\nlaws that i love that i wanted to pick\nout for you so to just mention a bit\nbecause i think these are\num really really interesting so this one\nis law 29 plan all the way to the end\nright and i wanted to ask you how one\nactually does that and i know you talk\nabout in the book which i want to say\nfor people but\nfor for today's conversation i'd love to\nhow do you plan to the end\nwhen sometimes it's really hard to know\nwhat's next and what the end is and i\nthink so many people today are you know\nin jobs for less time they're moving\nquicker there's so many more\nopportunities new technologies how do we\nwhat does it mean to plan to the end\nwell it's a thought process so you as\nyou as you what point out well enough\nthat things come up that you can't\nforesee circumstances things change and\nthe ending that you plan for doesn't\nhappen the way you want it to that's\nfine but to the degree that you go\nthrough a mental process and you think\nabout the ending and you have a goal in\nmind you're going to be much more\neffective in life so when something\ncomes up you're planning to go here and\nit forces you that way you're better\nprepared to take that circumstance and\nmake it maybe veer a little closer to\nthe point that you want right so\npeople the main point of that law is\nthat we are all go around with these\ndreams and these thoughts and these\nplans that are so vague i'm going to\nwrite a book\ni'm going to direct a movie i'm going to\nstart a tech startup that's going to\nmake billions of dollars blah blah blah\nand then we maybe go through a kind of\nhalf-hearted process yeah my book's\ngoing to be about this yeah my business\nwill be like that right and then you\ndon't really plan deeply enough you\ndon't think because your plans are are\ninfected with wishes\nright yes and to me the\nthe kind of um the model of that\nis the invasion of iraq by all of these\nextremely prudent strategic men like\ndick cheney etc\nthey thought that that we would be\ngreeted as liberators with people with\nflowers in their hand and then lo and\nbehold whoa this nasty nasty war in\nwhich hundreds of thousands of people\nare killed ensued they didn't realize\nthat their plans were infected with\ntheir dreams with what i call the rosie\nscenario\nso when you're going to go\nsell this movie that you want to you're\nimagining that people already love it\nyou've already convinced yourself but\nyou don't realize that people are cold\nthey're indifferent so if you plan to\nthe end you think about the goal you\nthink about the other people you think\nabout steps a b c d e to get there\nyou're more concrete and then when\nthings come up as mike tyson said\neveryone has a plan until you get hit in\nthe face right okay you get hit in the\nface yeah all right i got to change my\nplan a little bit yeah you're able to\nadapt but if you're not thinking clearly\nabout the end you're in deep deep\ndoo-doo yeah that book will never get\nwritten or if it if you to start it no\none's going to be interested in it etc\nyou have to plan more deeply and the\ncloser you can visualize the ending and\nbe realistic the greater your chances of\nthat's i i succe makes complete sense\nand i\ni think we've\nwe've almost lost that ability today i\nmean i i i yeah i've rarely hear that\nand that's why i wanted to pick that one\nbecause i feel like today and i guess i\ncould see you nodding for anyone who's\nnot watching the podcast right now i'm\nseeing bro uh yeah it's the idea we've\nlost that today there's so much of like\noh well just try this for a second and\ntry this for a moment and give this a go\nand it's almost like when you don't\nyou're so right not only do you not get\nit done\ni feel like the hurdles seem much bigger\nyeah because you just didn't comprehend\nthem right but today when people people\nwould argue and that's what i'm\nintrigued i'd love to hear your opinion\na lot of people would say\nbut\nrobert if i comprehend them then i just\nget disenthused or or i get i feel\nlimited and i just feel like it's\noverwhelming discouraged discouraged\nthat's what i was looking for yes\ndiscouraged i feel so discouraged and\noverwhelmed and it's too much for me\nso how do you think about the end but\navoid that feeling well i guess you\ndon't you can't avoid that feeling\nbut you work through it well i i mean do\nyou want just the dream do you just want\nthe the vision of that of the great\nthing you're gonna achieve or do you\nwant the reality right and so\nyou know if you're going to let's say\nyou're you you want to write a book i\nknow that's very lazy because that's\nwhat i do well i'm writing my second\nbook right now so this would be very\nhelpful okay\nall right it's a pretty enormous thing\nusually i mean if you're if you're\nsomewhat ambitious right and it's going\nto involve a lot of work and thinking\nand planning right\nbut um if you overdo the thinking if you\nthink about it every little thing is\nplanned ahead of time then the process\nkind of loses its joy and its excitement\nit seems over planned right\nbut you want to have a vision whenever i\nstart a book i have an overall vision of\nwhat i want the reader to feel from it\nwhat i want them to learn from it right\nokay and so then i plot very carefully\nthe ways to get there\nbut\nyeah it's going to take three or four\nyears yeah it's overwhelming yeah it's\ndaunting so what you do is you back off\nand you create little micro goals so\ni have\nplanning all the way end means to the\nend of july\nright yes yes i'm going to plan to the\nend of july and by july 31st i'm going\nto have written 10 pages i'm going to\nhave done this chapter i've done this\nresearch\nthen maybe if it's then it doesn't seem\nquite so daunting and then you can maybe\nextend it out a few more months and lo\nand behold the little baby steps you\ntake you're suddenly halfway there wow\nit's really not as difficult as i\nthought so you break it down people it\njust drives me crazy can only think in\nterms of black and white\noh plan all the way the end oh think\nabout that no it's planning all the\nsteps along the way yeah there's a\nbalance involved right so if you do\nthese little baby steps and you give\nyourself goals\nyou know if you have to work on your own\nyou're starting a bus\nyour own boss\nit's maddening because nobody's pushing\nyou you have to create continual\ndeadlines i do this to myself\nby this date i have to have this much\nwritten right and it kind of\nengages your spirit it gets your\nemotions going it makes you realize you\nhave a deadline you have to get there\nand it energizes you whereas that vague\nfeeling of oh i want to write a book\nokay blah blah blah\nit it's actually more daunting is less\nenergy involved because you never feel\nlike that i call it in my war book death\nground strategy\nwhen an army's back is against a\nmountain or the ocean\nthey fight like hell to get out of it\nbecause there's desperate and it's\neither\nwin or die\nyou have to have that approach with your\nbook or something if i don't get this\ndone by july 31st i'm in trouble i\nbetter hurry up and do it so break it\ndown and don't don't\nalways every single day think of oh my\ngod it's gonna take so many years etc\nthat's in the back of your head you have\na vision but you have other little ends\nthat you're continually planning towards\nyes yes absolutely yeah and i think like\nthat's the challenge right like when\nyou're writing the page you're thinking\nabout the book\nand when you're writing about a chapter\nyou're thinking about the book launch\nand it's like you're thinking about\nsomething way bigger than what you\nactually have to do right now but it's\nto what you do right now that's going to\nget that bigger thing and i think if all\nyou did was wake up and say i just have\nto write a page today which is that\nmicrostep you're speaking of then i\ndon't think i have to write a book\nwriting a book is daunting and\noverwhelming but writing a page or\nwriting a paragraph if that's where\nyou're at like wherever you're at a line\nyou know like that's if that's the case\nthat baby step is\nwhat you want to wake up and fix satan i\nthink it's the same with\nyeah with anything whether you're\nlaunching a podcast whether you again\ni'm being lazy uh whether you're whether\nyou're launching a like you said\nlaunching a company whether you're you\nknow whether you're\nstarting a new brand or whatever it may\nbe the problem is we're thinking i need\nto do this i need to do that thing on\nthe front cover of forbes magazine and\nit's like that's not what you're doing\nlike this is what you're doing right\nyeah i mean people who are great\ncraftsmen and i have a book called\nmastery yes which i discussed the\nprocess of creating something\nif you look at crafts people somebody's\nbuilding a house or an architect they\ncan't sit there and just suddenly have\nit happen they have to go brick by brick\nby brick they have to lay a foundation\nthey have to focus on the foundation et\ncetera et cetera but at the same time\nthey have an overall vision of what the\nhouse will look like so if you're only\nfocused on the day-to-day\nit loses a little bit of spirit so you\nneed to allow yourself a little bit of\ndreaming\ni dream all the time i'm being\ninterviewed by jay shetty while i'm\nwriting the book you know i'm having i'm\non the cover of some other matt great\nmagazine whatever you know right you'll\nallow yourself to have it because it\ngives you kind of so you need both again\nyou need both you need to balance yes\nbut a little bit more towards the micro\nends and then occasionally\nah yeah when it's finished i'm gonna\nhave this it'll be wonderful because\nthat'll keep your energy up got it yeah\ni i couldn't agree with you more the\nother one i wanted to pick out i mean\nthere's obviously as everyone knows\nthere's 48\nto pick out so\ni'm only picking two and we've spoken\nabout a few of them but you have to get\nthe book to read about the rest of them\nuh we have master the art of timing\ni i find that one fascinating too\nbecause i think today we're living at a\ntime when people either think it's too\nlate\nit's too early\ni'm not sure it's not my time these are\nthe you know these are the things i see\non social media these are the things i\nsee\npeople express\nhow do you master the art of timing what\nis what does that mean well in an\nabstract philosophical sense let's pull\nback a second time is a human construct\ntime does not exist in the universe\nit's eternal there's no clocks there's\nno beginning or end it's just one\nmassive\nthing of time that goes on forever right\nwe humans have created time so it's\nsubjective it's psychological\nso you know the experience that when you\nwere a child a year seemed like a\nmillion years oh my god\nnow a year goes like that\nit's subjective right so you have to\nunderstand that first okay\nso when you're excited about a project\nwhen you feel alive and energized then\ntime is a much different experience than\nwhen you're bored so you can create your\nrelationship to time right\nso\ni'm not ready\nwell there's a strategy for that\nyou should always take action\na little bit before you were ready is\nthe advice i give\nso if you're not ready and it's really a\nhuge task okay maybe wait a little bit\ntake steps to get closer to being ready\nbut\nseveral months before you're ready go\nahead and do it\ntry it because you're going to rise to\nthe occasion\nif you feel like you're almost ready and\nthen you start you go but i better work\nharder because i know that i can do this\nwhereas if you think i can never do it\nyou'll just give up you don't want to\ngive up right\nso i have in the book many examples of\npeople who forced crime i call it\nforcing time so\ni talk about julius caesar and the\nfamous crossing the rubicon right he had\nan army of only like 5 000\nand facing pompei his arch enemy who had\nan army of hundreds of thousands\nand\nto cross the river means he's starting a\nwar\nand everyone's saying it's insane don't\ndo it you'll never make it and he goes\nuh the dye is cast and he crossed the\nrubicon the war was on and he knew that\ndoing that he would have to think every\nmoment give it every all of his intense\nthinking he'd have to reach the\nconclusion and he ended up pulling off\none of the greatest military victories\nin history look at barack obama\na senator who'd only been in office for\none term\nit's 2007 or so\nand he decides to run for president\neveryone thinks you're insane\nyou're not ready for it no one's going\nto believe it you're not you don't have\nenough weight behind you he goes\ndoing this step will force me to work\nharder to gain that energy yes if he was\na state representative it wouldn't have\nbeen time to force it and try and make\nit happen but he'd already had enough\npreparation just enough that he knew if\nhe took that step something would happen\nthe energy the excitement people would\ncatch it it'd be infectious and it would\nwork and look what it did for him so you\ncan be over ready you should always take\naction just a little bit before you\nthink that you're you're ready for it\nright so um\nand then the other thing is to realize\nthat\nwith time is that you want to feel like\nyou're in control of the time that you\nhave yes right so i call it a live time\nversus dead time\ndead time is where you work for other\npeople you have no control over your\ntime is not your own it's their time\nthey possess you you're almost literally\ntheir slave right and a lifetime is that\nyour own you're your master of it you\ncontrol it so when you work for yourself\nwhich i think is the best position in\nthe world to be and although it's not\nfor everybody you kind of control your\nown time every moment is alive it's\nprecious right\nso for me\ni practice this in my meditation in my\ndaily life particularly since i almost\nlost my life a couple years ago is every\nmoment is so valuable to me that time i\nmaybe i could be dead tomorrow and you\nhave to think that way and if you think\nthat your time is limited that you have\nthings to accomplish business to start\nbooks direct podcasts to start right\nyou're going to force yourself you're\ngoing to find the energy if you realize\nyour time is short and you have to kind\nof force it in a way and not be sitting\nback on your heels and continuing the\nwait waiting so i tell people if you\nhave a dream\nmaybe stop waiting so much maybe\nthrow yourself across that river and go\nand take the action and if you fail\nyou will have learned\n80 000 times more than you would have\nlearned in business school you start\nthat tech startup\nit fails\ndon't worry about your reputation you\nyou learn the incredible things in it so\ndon't be afraid of failure and be\nwilling to always kind of force the time\nthat's where one of the the art of it\nyeah no that's really well articulated\nand explained what changed your you you\nmentioned there\nwhat changed\nfor you\nbetween knowing time was limited and\nthen experiencing it and actually\nfeeling with it like because i think\nthat's\nthere's i guess there's very few people\nwho have that experience because for\nsome people it\nliterally ends up being the end from a\nphysical standpoint\nuh but to almost have yeah what does\nthat feel like because i think you're\nsomeone who already knew that yeah you\nknew that you lived like that you wrote\nthis book like you already live like\ntime is limited i have to write books\nyou write phenomenal books and and lots\nof them\nyeah what changed what changed in that\nknowing that theory talking about my\nstroke yes yes yes yes sorry well you\nknow um wasn't trying to be cryptic guys\nyou see the shirt that i'm wearing yeah\ndo you see kind of a weird little jagged\nline i see it\nokay well this is the shirt that i was\nwearing when i had my stroke\nright\nand um i was with my wife we were\ndriving home\nand she saw whoa\nrobert your\nface is all weird you're slurring she\nwas freaking out she said pull over\nthat's the last thing i remember i went\nunconscious\nand the ambulance came and they took\nscissors and they cut the shirt right\naround there they ripped it off me they\nthrew it in a bag then they like put\nsomething in to help\ngive oxygen to my brain because it\nstopped going flowing to my brain\nso\nmonths later i asked my wife whatever\nhappened to that shirt i loved it\nbecause she had given it to me like two\nmonths before for my birthday i love\nthat shirt she told me the story and oh\nman\nand then finally i said\ncan you like sew it together again\nbecause she's a good sewer she said yeah\nokay\nand so she did and so i wear it and it\nreminds me because when i was this close\nto dying there was a feeling inside that\ni had right it was a feeling that i\nit's weird it was almost a taste in my\nmouth and there was a feeling in my\nbones a kind of a softness like i was\nmelting from the inside out and i could\nliterally feel myself\num\nmoving away from life in that moment\njust before i went unconscious right so\nreminding of it with things like so now\nwhen i wear this shirt it's like a\nmemento mori i can re-experience that\nfeeling\nand it's so ironic because two months\nbefore i wrote the last chapter of human\nnature about confronting your mortality\nit's not the same it's abstract this is\nvisceral this is real and people who've\nhad much more powerful near-death\nexperiences than i am\nknow that you don't emerge from that\never the same it changes you right\nso now\ni it was an intellectual concept\nso now when i hear the birds chirping i\nlook out my window the sun is shining i\nlike almost want to cry i'm here to see\nit and i came that close to never seeing\nit again\nyou know or people are irritating me\nno i could be dead and they don't i love\nthem and i can overlook them because\nthey're also mortal they're also gonna\ndie they also have fears it's just\nchanges you\nemotionally from the inside out so how\ncan people do that who haven't\nexperienced death it's not easy\nbut you have to make the leap from an\nintellectual abstract concept to\nsomething visceral and emotional right\nso even before my stroke i meditate\nevery morning i would always have a\npractice of\nmeditating on that moment when i'm gonna\ndie\ni imagine myself it's an afternoon the\nsun is shining and this is my last day\non earth\nyou know and i can even make myself kind\nof cry as i do that and i would make\nmyself it's something real\nbecause we go around and we live in a\nculture\nwhere death has no meaning we don't see\nthe food that we're eating being the\nanimals being killed people die in\nhospitals cloistered away whereas our\nancestors they saw it on the street they\nsaw the animals being killed it had a\npresence you live in this abstract world\nwhere nothing is real where your\nmortality is just\nlike something you don't even process\nget over that jump over that and make\nthat leap make it something emotional\nand visceral it's not gloomy it's not\nmore but it's liberating\nbecause when you think about your death\nand it becomes real you realize i don't\nhave this much time i better work harder\ni better appreciate the people in my\nlife i better love them more i better\nappreciate every moment that i'm alive\nand it just\nopens you up in so many ways so\nit's one thing to have in an\nintellectual exercise it's another thing\nto make it more visceral and that's what\ni'm kind of advocating that's why i love\nthat's a beautiful transition into you\nknow the your new book that's how called\nthe daily laws because that's a daily\nhabit right like that's the only\nto to make that law feel real\nyou need to practice it daily especially\nif you've not had a near-death\nexperience\nand i know that i've practiced that\ndeath meditation often in my life when\ni i don't do every day\ni do it more when i'm making a big\ndecision it really helps me make big\ndecisions i remember when i was\nworking in the corporate world but\nreally wanted to be doing what i do\ntoday\nand sitting there and asking myself like\nhow will i feel about this\nin you know on my deathbed that's very\ninteresting i never thought that's very\ngood yeah i was like if i stay in the\ncorporate world how will i feel about\nthis when i'm 80 or 90 or 100 whatever\nstrategy yeah and then how will i feel\nabout this if i tried and failed and how\nwill i feel about if i tried and it\nworks yeah and every part of me was just\nlike you have to try this like even if\nit fails you'll you'll be so upset at\nyourself for being 90\nand about to die and\nand you didn't try and so i love that\nand and and that's why i love the the\nfact that you've taken out the daily\nlaws\nwhat have been some of your\ndaily life changes since the moment you\ntold us about that beautiful meditation\nhave there been other things obviously\nlooking at the birds with the sun what\nelse has changed daily for you i wonder\nwell um\na bit of humility\nso um first of all\num\nyou know i look at people now who are\nold\nor who have a disability\nand i understand them on a much deeper\nlevel i have much greater empathy for\npeople not just with a disability but\npeople who've lost their job who are\npoor who have no control over their\nlives i have greater empathy for them\nbecause\nin the months afterwards i had no\ncontrol over my body\ni couldn't walk i still walk in a very\nkind of wonky way\nright\ni was dependent on other people it was\ndependent on my wife i was dependent on\nhealth care caregivers\non therapists etc and that feeling of\ndependence is not something i like\nbecause i like somebody really values\nindependence so i had to deal with\nmyself i had to get over\nmy kind of\nradical individualism my radical sense\nof being totally independent because i\nwas dependent on other people and i\nreally could empathize with others who\nhave that feeling of dependency it's not\na good feeling you have to com you have\nto learn to\naccept it in some way and it's not easy\nand so i learned that there was some\nnegative qualities that i had that i had\nto confront\nlike my impatience\nyeah whenever i had a problem or a\nhealth issue i would push past it man\nokay i might i broke my leg well i'm\ngonna do therapy so in two months i'm\ngonna be out and i did it right it\ndoesn't work for this you can't push\npast your way my brain was damaged i\ncan't push past it i have to accept it\nand that's not easy for someone who's\nused to just pushing past things like\nthat\nso i had to deal with\nqualities that aren't really to me very\ngood\nlike i think patience is a good thing i\nthink it's a virtue and i think it's\npositive and being able to accept\ncertain things you can't control so i\nhad to learn certain things about myself\ni had to learn that some of the ideas i\nhad were intellectual where i do have\nempathy for people but it wasn't as\nvisceral as it is now you know and then\non a day-to-day basis i've had to like\ncontrol my impatience and my wife can\nattest i often lose it so i'm no saint\nand i don't prepare to pretend to be\nthere'll be days where i'm like god damn\nit i can't pick up my toothbrush it's\ndriving me crazy\nother days it's like come on you can do\nit's okay you calm yourself down things\nare okay right everything's gonna be all\nright so i've had to deal with my own\nissues on a very visceral real level and\ndeal with them in a way i've never had\nto do before so it's it's an ongoing\nprocess yeah that's such a special\nanswer thank you for sharing that like\nto get into your head with\nwith what it feels like and humility is\nsuch a\nincredible quality and the hardest to\nlearn and the most painful to\nto go through and i i remember when we\nwere talking about\nsickness and health and as as young\nmonks one of our\nduties or roles would be to take elderly\nmonks to the hospital when they had to\nget checked and it was part of that\nroutine to make you see that because we\nwere like 21 years old and\nthought we were super human because\nbecause we were like ah sleep who needs\nto sleep uh you know like food who needs\nfood\nand you thought so highly of yourself\nonly to realize that you were just lucky\nbecause of your age it was just the age\nof the body that you were winning on it\nwasn't anything else it wasn't that you\nwere more self-mastered or disciplined\nuh and and being humbled in that way was\nsuch a\nyou know to witness what you're saying\nlike all of these things have been\nhidden in society they're invisible yeah\nand when pain becomes invisible we\nbecome worse at dealing with it because\nexactly\nwe become immune to it we never see it\nso how do we know how to deal with it\nand so\ni'm i'm grateful that you're sharing so\nauthentically your pain and what you're\ngoing through because\nyou know be very easy for you to say oh\nyeah i'm i'm just living all my\nmessages and and you know all of us fail\nto live our own like as in it's not fail\nit's just it's just hard like\nyou know i i think about it so\nwith the daily laws you've got 366\nmeditations\nuh you said you meditate daily what's\nbeen your daily meditation practice and\nand does it change has it stayed the\nsame oh i have a very boring daily\nmeditation practice i want to hear it i\ndo zen buddhism yes okay i've been doing\nit now for 11 years every single morning\ni can remember the day i started and um\nit's basically actually you sit on it's\ncalled zazen\nyou sit on these pillows\nand you're trying to empty your mind\nright and you know you have a process\nyou learn things from masters i've gone\nto a zen center here in los angeles i\nread a lot of books but it's a\ncompletely\nnon-intellectual process right you can't\nthink your way to enlightenment it will\nnever happen and that's the problem i\nhave and everybody has oh this is what i\nneed to do blah blah blah blah you can't\ndo it it's like this paradox they\ndescribe it in zen as this red-hot ball\nthat you've swallowed and you can't get\nrid of it you can't throw it up it's\nthere it's stuck inside of you the\nparadox is thinking won't get it you\nthere so how do i get there\nso i i'm not going to reveal the whole\nthing but i i have things called a a\nkoan\nwhich is like um like it's like a little\nparable\nand it's a very famous koan in buddhism\nit's it basically it says\nthis one monk asks the zen master does a\ndog have buddha nature\nand the monk and and the master replies\nmu\nand ma in japanese means nothing or no\nbut it really means nothing\nthat's like\noh\nit's nothing in other words you can't\nanswer the question yes and no have no\nmeaning right because in buddhism there\nis no discrimination the discriminating\nmind is the ultimate form of samsara so\nyou need to like get rid of that and\nmeditate on ma\nso for five years now i've been\nmeditating on ma only ma what does it\nmean and it you have no idea the\nrichness that will flow from one little\nsyllable like that and meditating it on\nevery day so my meditation is not\nexciting it's not variety it's the same\nthing every day right and they're are\nsteps involved in it it's a physical\nemotional process less than an\nintellectual one but that's\nto give you an idea about it yeah no\nit's it's beautiful to hear about it and\nuh\nyeah i love the idea of i remember the\nmonks that i used to live with would\nalways say that\nyou know this whatever you call it\nenlightenment or revelation whatever\nwhatever word you want to give it it's\nsomething that's received not achieved\nthey would always repeat that to us it's\nreceived not achieved\nand and you know as\nwe're all trying to achieve it like i\nwant to have it i want to find it what\ndo i have to do whatever think and and\njust knowing that it was received gave\nme so much liberation right in and of\nitself right knowing that it would be\nreceived you know as i continue the path\nright and it would be revealed as well\nas i continue so no thank you for\nsharing i love it i love hearing about\npeople's daily meditation practices i\nwanted to pick out a couple of the daily\nlures because\nwhat this book beautifully does for\neveryone is it literally goes through\nevery day of the year so you can open it\nout on that day\nwhy do you think it was important to do\nthat why was it important to have\nsomething for july 1st\nor you know why was it important to have\naugust 20th or whatever it may be\nwell we talked about a little bit\nearlier about having micro goals\nso um\nwe all have ambitions we all have dreams\nand goals and desires that we want and\nour culture fills us with these kind of\nvague hopes and dreams i'm going to be\nthis i'm going to be that but really\nwhat gets you to where you want are\nhabits are daily habits there are\nnegative habits that you can't get rid\nof smoking drinking\nyou know online porn whatever your daily\nhabit is you can't get rid of it but\nthere are other habits that like\ndiscipline like working every day like\ntaking steps to get reach your goals\nthat are immensely liberating and you\ncan get rid of your bad habits through\ndeveloping positive habits right\nso\nthe goal here is to focus less on the\ngiant dreams and on the everyday process\nof changing your thinking\nyou know i spent a lot of time thinking\nabout\nhow does change occur within a person\nright yeah me too yeah because\nwe all experience from ourselves\nthe change rarely happens quickly as we\nlike\nwe step back we we we revert to our old\nhabits etc\nwhat involves what kind of consciousness\ndo we have to go through the steps to\nliterally change our way of thinking\nit requires hitting at the roots of\nthings it requires how you think every\nsingle day about simple basic things in\nin your life right it's not grand dreams\nit's the day-to-day thoughts that\nconsume you that obsess you right\nso\nthat's what the book is about every day\nis a meditation and it's kind of\nstructured in the beginning to help you\ngo through your career\nmostly things from mastery about finding\nyour life's purpose your like what i\ncall your life's task and how to achieve\nyou know a level of mastery and whatever\nyou do then i kind of take you through\nthe 48 laws of power and dealing with\ntoxic people which we inevitably have no\nyou're never going to go through a life\nwithout facing toxic negative people and\nhow you deal with them it takes you\nthrough how to have influence and be\nable to persuade people and finally it\nends with learning about human nature\netc\nand the last month december\nis a social this is inspired by the book\nthat i'm currently writing about the\nsublime\nabout opening your eyes to the insanity\nof just being alive\nright now in this world that we live in\nso that's kind of the process it goes\nevery day\nfocusing your mind on a thought that\nhopefully will plant little seeds inside\nof you\nlet's talk about the heart of that the\nmiddle of that which was like dealing\nwith toxic people that's actually a\nquestion i get asked so often so i'm\nglad i get to defer to you in this\nscenario and put you to the task but the\nidea of like people i hear this all the\ntime jay i'm stuck in a\ntoxic family my workplace is toxic i\nyou know and some people are honest\nenough to say jay i'm my mind is just\ntoxic like it's not even other people\nright\nwhere do you start where where do you\nwhere do you guide people in that\njourney yeah it's obviously something\ni've been thinking about and dealing\nwith my whole life particularly in all\nmy different jobs i'd had a lot of\nbosses that we would qualify as the\npsychotic boss\nor no matter what you do that never\npleases them kind of thing\nand the best lesson of all so we can say\nthe different kind of toxic type of\npeople most often they're of the\nnarcissistic variety they're people who\nare grandiose or people who are\naggressive passive aggressive who feel a\nlot of envy there's like debrided\ninsecurities on and on they're many\ntypes\nbut the main thing that you want in lot\nto develop in life is the ability to\ndetect them before you get involved with\nthem\nbecause the way toxic people have\nlearned they've learned strategies since\nthey were six or seven years old\nhow to get power\nand they embroil you in dramas they get\ninto your emotions right they entangle\nthemselves in in your life\nthey don't come at you saying i'm toxic\ni'm a narcissist get away from me they\nknow how to appear charming they know\nhow to be interested in you they know\nhow to be moderately pleasing etc they\ncan be they can even be charismatic you\nget involved with them and then it\nstarts to come out and it's too late\nbecause you're emotionally entangled\nwith them they've got their roots inside\nof you and you're sucked into their\ndramas and it's really hard to get out\nparticularly in an intimate relationship\nthat's the worst of all\nthe best thing you want to develop in\nlife is the radar to detect them before\nyou get involved with them\nand it requires a change in how you\nperceive people\nso it doesn't mean i don't want people\nto become paranoid\neverybody out there that i'm dealing\nwith could be toxic because it's\nonly like five percent of the population\nor whatever it is truly like that\nbut you want to be able to see the signs\nbeforehand right and you don't want to\njudge people based on their words based\non their charming personality based on\ntheir glittering resume you want to be\nable to judge their character what's\ndeep deep inside of them right the\nthings that they're not are not so\nvisible at first glance right\nso you have to train how you think about\npeople you have to observe their\npatterns in life before you met them if\nthis person you're about to get involved\nin a relationship tells you\nall of my wives and girlfriends in the\npast they were just such blah blah blah\nblah blah and then you you hear that\nthey don't only last a year or so and it\nwas always their fault\nyour antenna should go up something is\nwrong here this person isn't revealing\nthe truth this probably coming from\nsomething within\nin my 48 laws of power i talk about\ninfection where there are people who\nhave an infecting power on you\nthey've surrounded by all kinds of drama\nthey're they continually present\nthemselves as the victim of other people\nwhereas in fact they're the ones that\nconstantly draw this drama to them\nbecause that's how they survive and\nyou're going to find yourself involved\nwith them and it's going to be horrible\nto get out of the relationship you're\ngoing to feel guilty so develop the\npower to recognize them before you get\ninvolved and i have in the laws of human\nnature\ntons of advice about that paying\nattention to people's nonverbal cues\nto\na narcissist tends to have a very\nanimated face but a kind of a deadness\nin their eyes\nthey're they're kind of listening to you\nbut you can hear that they're actually\nthinking about themselves or they're\nthey're they're not really connecting to\nyou\nthrough the eyes\nthe face is alive but the eyes are dead\nright there are signs non-verbal cues\nthat will show you that you're dealing\nwith someone who's not i hate the words\nlike sociopathic psychopathic but who is\nyou know generally very inner\nself-directed right\nthe other thing i have to say is\nit's easy to judge and say oh the\nnarcissist the to people but we all have\nthese qualities yes we all have\nnarcissistic qualities we all can be\npassive aggressive right so some of it\nyou can recognize in yourself and there\nare ways the ways to get out of it\nbut the main thing is to not get\ninvolved with these people if you're\ninvolved\nlet's say you have a spouse or whatever\nthe best power you can give is the\nability to withdraw your emotions from\nthe moment and god knows that is not\neasy it's a day-to-day thing it's a\ndaily process where you have to tell\nyourself these little kind of scripts\nthat you tell yourself it's not me it\nhas nothing to do with me it's not\npersonal they have issues from early\nchildhood that have given them these\ntoxic patterns in life they're trying to\nmake me feel guilty but it's nothing to\ndo with me it's not personal over and\nover and over and over again every\nsingle time so you have the ability to\ndetach yourself emotionally from them on\na daily basis\nif you're in a job\nand you have a toxic colleague or a\ntoxic boss if you can get away from them\nif you can quit your job if you can move\nto another part of the office do it\nbecause\nit's worth it it's not worth collecting\nten thousand extra dollars a year\nbecause with this boss because it's\ngoing to damage you emotionally it's\ngoing to take you years to recover\nthree years with a toxic boss you may\nnever recover so if you can quit the job\nnothing no no no job is worth that kind\nof abuse it's going to hurt you it's\ngoing to damage you right and the same\nin a relationship as well\nif you can't get out\nyou have to develop a habit of\ndetachment and not taking things\npersonally and oddly enough\nwhen people sense that in you like a\ntoxic person's senses that they can't\npush your buttons\nit has a powerful effect on them i'm not\nsaying it's going to cure them\nbut they thrive on the ability to push\nyour buttons to see you getting upset\nand angry just makes them so excited in\na perverted way the fact that you're not\nthat you're not taking it personally\nthat you're calm\nthat you're centered that you're\nthinking to yourself it's not personal\nit's not personal\nit's going to have a powerful effect on\nthem it may not end the dynamic but it\nwill have more of an effect that you\nwant than constantly falling for their\nploys and their games are getting\nemotionally sucked into their to their\ndramas yeah it's almost like\nyou see the\nyou see the magic trick right like you\nor you're seeing like the\nthe puppet strings yeah and you go i'm\ngonna cut these strings off now like you\nknow and and that's\nlike you're saying it doesn't\nnecessarily solve it\nbut\nthat person's well aware now that that's\nnot going to work on you right right and\nand you're so right that that reactivity\nwe have with people that\nit's like they want that drama they seek\nthat drama because that's what gives\nthem their sense of significance and so\nyou're right that it may not stop that\nbut it definitely makes them think\nand it definitely makes them check\nthemselves in question they're used to\ngetting away with things they're used to\npeople not seeing through them\nand just repeat to yourself toxic people\ndo not announce themselves they do not\nwear little horns on their head saying\ni'm i'm so devilish or whatever they\ndisguise it\nso\na person who is overly charming on that\nfirst encounter\nwho's so nice who's listening to you who\nwants to help you and please you that's\nnot natural\nbecause we've all developed a habit of\nbeing slightly wary of strangers\nand i've learned through my consulting\nwork and my own experience that that\nperson who's trying too hard on the\nfirst encounter they're generally\num hiding something they're generally\nconceding intentions that they don't\nwant to give out right their method\nof throwing dust in your eyes is to\nappear the opposite of what they are\nand you're going to fall for that so\nwhen people try too hard with one\nquality or reveal too much of a single\nquality they're often concealing the\nopposite so be aware of that as well\nyeah and that's and that's what you're\nsaying like it's so hard to know whether\nsomeone is a\ngod an agenda or someone who's just\ntruly\nnice like it becomes hard\nit becomes hard to suggest i i remember\nwhen uh there was someone i was building\na relationship with and and i said to\nthem i was like you know i\ni've just really got along with them\nand they talk about this all the time\nnow and i said something like you know i\nthink\ni i think we'd be really good friends\nand they said that they'd never heard\nanyone say that to them because it just\nseemed so like lame to some degree to\nsay that to someone but i've always\nlived that way so i've always been\nsomeone who like i will tell you exactly\nwhat i'm thinking right now and\ni will in in that sense not exactly what\ni'm thinking right now but exactly what\ni'm feeling in a relationship i i've\nalways enjoyed communicating\nbecause i saw people communicate so\nbadly about who they wanted to be\nfriends with and spend time with i was\njust like i want to tell this person i\nwant to spend time with them and if they\ndon't want to spend time with me i want\nto hear it now too because i don't want\nto go home thinking about and that's how\ni was when i started dating it was like\nif i was attracted to someone i would\nalways tell them\nbecause i actually preferred the failure\nthan the idea of them not knowing and us\nmissing out on an opportunity to have a\nrelationship so i guess my question is\nis there a way of knowing if there's\nsome sincerity or or or is that just an\nenergetic intuitive thing that comes\nwith time you know this is why i have a\nchapter on nonverbal communication and\nloss of human nature\nwe have an animal part of us right\nwhere\nwe feel certain things about people\non that first encounter or second\nencounter that's not rational that's\nintuitive\nand then we don't trust it yes right\nand often it happens in a microsecond in\na flash you meet somebody and you sense\na chemistry or something a little bit\nwrong right\nokay but with you if i met somebody like\nyou who seems very genuine and sincere\nand i can read it in your face and i\nfeel it i don't need to be wary\nbut\nparticularly with women dealing with men\nbecause quite frankly the more dangerous\ntoxic type will be made\nwomen will often have an intuition a\nsense\nof something isn't quite right but they\ndon't trust it and they go on but we all\nhave that feeling\ntrusted\nand you could be wrong\nbut it doesn't hurt to be a little bit\nwary of someone it doesn't mean if\nsomeone is being like you friendly i\nwant to be your friend that you have to\ngo running away immediately yeah it just\nmeans\nmaybe it's an ulterior motive here yes\ni'm reading body language that tells me\nno that they're sincere i can let down\nmy guard but there'll be a tiny\npercentage of me which in the days to\ncome wants to see if they truly yes\nwhich is fair because there are people\nlike it's a it's a com classic\ncase of envy\nwhere a person\nwho is envious of you\nbecomes your friend that's where most\nenvy relationships occur is between\nfriends right\nand they they make a point of being your\nfriend they're very friendly they love\nyou they want to help you they want to\nassist you\nwow this is great because we never get\nenough of that in life\nand then six months down the road\nthey start turning against you start\ndoing things that completely confuse you\nnow probably in your first encounters\nyou could have detected something about\nthem already\nbut people can be tricky\nso you know with with you i would kind\nof sense a complete sincerity and i\nwould let down my guard\nbut there are other people that you have\nto be a little bit wary of it doesn't\nmean that you cut off contact\nbut you have a little bit of distance\nand the moment you see\nbehavior that kind of contradicts that\ninitial impression\nwhoa\nall right and maybe you don't become\nfriend you don't get involved with them\nbecause getting involved with a person\nlike that is is going to cost you a lot\nin the end yeah i couldn't agree more\nand that applies to business love\nrelationships and i've i've made\nmistakes because you fall in love too\nfast\nyou\neach scenario you just you're moving so\nfast and so quick and you're involved\nwith someone before you even know it and\nyou never get a chance to say oh do i\nnotice something you know on twitter\nabout this person\nso no i'm i'm with you what are the\nthings that\nrobert we talked about like people not\nhaving power not understanding power\ndeveloping about i guess what are the\nthings that you believe destroy\nsomeone's power by themselves\nso i don't mean things like\nreputation and envious people and what\nare the ways we destroy our own power\ngenerally by not having the ability to\nadapt to circumstances\nokay\nso\nyou go through life and if you're\nsuccessful or have some success you kind\nof depend on certain skills certain\nstrategies that get you where you want\nto be\nand then you find yourself in a position\nthat's new\nand circumstances that are new and you\nkeep doing the same thing over again and\nit doesn't work\nand you get angry and you get frustrated\nand you blame other people this guy's\nnot listening to me this isn't working\nit's because you're not adapting right\nso you need to have this\nit's a kind of a zen or it's it's asian\nstrategy\nmindset of every circumstance is\ndifferent you have to have a sense of\nflow every thing that you encounter\nevery problem is new\nwhat worked in the past won't work again\ni need to adapt i need to be able to\nflow and be fluid and adaptable\nthat's the main thing that trips people\nup it's the wall they continually hit\nand i've seen it time and again\nin business with ceos i was on the\nboard of directors of a publicly traded\ncompany\nand\npeople who are very powerful get to a\nposition by being very aggressive by\nbeing very charming by being blah blah\nblah and then they reach a managerial\nlevel where they have a huge company\nand those skills don't apply anymore\nand they keep trying to push those same\nbuttons and it gets them in trouble and\nthey hit a wall\nso your ability to adapt and alter your\nthinking depending on your circumstances\nwill make you not hit those walls i\nthink that's the main thing and then the\nother thing that happens\nis grandiosity kicks in i have a chapter\nin human nature about the about\ngrandiosity and basically what happens\nis success is very very dangerous\nsuccess is much more dangerous than\nfailure\nfailure makes you look at yourself\nwhen i failed with my body and my after\nmy stroke i had to look at my own\nlimitations\nwhereas success is like a drug\nit's like a continual hit of coke or\nwhatever\nwow i'm a god people love me everything\ni say is wonderful everyone's going\naround thinking god you're so great\nrobert one yeah\nand slowly your feet reason higher and\nhigher off the ground you lose contact\nwith reality and boom you fall down\nbecause you don't realize\nthat success often has a great degree of\nluck\nyou're discounting the luck involved\nyou're discounting the role of other\npeople that helped you to get there you\nthink it's all about you\nright so you take actions that aren't\ncalibrated to reality because you think\nyou you have the midas touch and you\ndon't\nso those are some of the main barriers\nto power i think got it yeah those are\ngreat answers there's a there's a\nabsolutely brilliant i loved what you\nsaid earlier about\nthinking everything every situation is\nnew having fresh eyes and fresh ears to\nto to look at a problem to hear a\nproblem and you're reminding me of a\nbeautiful zen story i'm sure you know it\nof the i'll be i'll do the quick version\nbut the idea of the the person who wants\nto cross a river so they build a raft\nthe raft helps them cross the river now\nthey carry the raft wherever they go and\nnow they come up to a wooded forest and\nthey're trying to get through and the\nraft won't let them get through\nand they realize they have to let go of\nthe raft if they want to go through the\nforest yeah i never thought of that so\nthat's great yeah the idea that you get\nso attached to\nuh this raft saved my life i have to\nkeep it on me forever right\nyeah and you know i i can relate to so\nmuch of that in my life like you know\ni i often feel that i allow myself to go\nthrough a\na renewal and a\nalmost and i don't like the word\nrebranding because it seems so external\nit's almost like what is the word for an\ninternal rebrand but it's like the idea\nof i allow myself to just be like who do\ni want to be at this stage in my life\nand\nand what do i truly want to dedicate my\nlife to and this time in my life too and\ni feel like i'm at that stage right now\nin my life and because i've i've far\nsuperseded things that i thought i would\nhave done and\nand now i need and want to create the\nnext challenge and the next um you know\ni'm looking forward to something that's\nbig and that's that's very healthy\nthat's good yeah i'm like looking what's\nthat next big thing that's gonna make me\nlearn new skills and and exactly what is\nthe thing that i want to learn in order\nto you know and so i'm there right now\nand when you were saying that i was\nnodding along and laughing because\ni can just so relate to that and and\nthankfully because of\ngood mentors and coaches um\nyou know it's i'm always i'm using\nsuccess to look inward too as opposed to\nonly failure and of course there's\nplenty of failure in success too so\nthere's you're always doing both but the\nidea is to always look inward\nand and so yeah i'm just i'm i'm\nactually just sharing that with you\nbecause i could relate to it so strongly\nwell um you know the temptation i had\nafter the success of my first book the\n48 laws was to kind of keep repeating it\nto do a 48 laws of power number two\nwhich is what a lot of writers end up\ndoing because they're worried about\ntaking on something different they've\nkind of created their audience they\nbetter just sort of keep to it with\nsuccess you become conservative\ni better just do what's working right\nand then but times change there's a\nzeitgeist there's a spirit of the times\npeople have moved on but you haven't\nand your your 48 laws of power number\ntwo won't work\nyou know so you need to change and i do\nthat with every book that i write\neach book has to be different as to\nreflect the spirit of the times has to\nbe a challenge i have to learn new\nskills i have to go outside of my\ncomfort zone so i think that's sort of a\nsimilar thing yeah definitely and i\nthink i saw that because\ni looked again what we were talking\nabout earlier when you study the people\nyou admire\nin any field or the companies or\nwhatever it may be you see that you see\nthat constant renewal\nand\ninitially it's very uncomfortable for\nthe audience as well it's uncomfortable\nfor the community\nbecause\nthey're not used to changing and they're\nnot used to seeing people grow in that\nway\nand and i think that discomfort is both\non the behalf of the individual who's\ntrying to grow and be more of themselves\nand and it's there for the community too\nand but but it gives birth to something\nphenomenal like you're saying the the\nconservative approach would have never\ngot you there\nand so i i love that idea and yeah just\nit's it's been a fun time for me trying\nto figure it like i'm almost enjoying\nfeeling like i'm at the beginning of my\njourney again wow and there's some\nthere's some joy in that that's great\nyeah there's some sacredness and\nspecialness of like oh i forgot how this\nfelt you know you have to write a book\non that that's your book that's your\nnext book\ni'm writing my next one already so this\none may have to be laid it down because\ni'd read that book tomorrow that's great\nidea wow wow well yeah we'll have to uh\nwe'll have to yeah share notes and\ncollaborate on that because uh i was\nsaying offline i want to share this with\nwe\nme and robert we're talking about this\noffline but i want to share with you is\nthe idea of you know i'm really enjoying\nthis conversation with robert because\nwe're almost toggling between the binary\nand finding the gray\nand robert's fantastic at getting and\nand that's what i enjoyed talking to you\nabout so much you're so fantastic at\ngetting into these subtle nuances\nuh because we you know all of us try and\nbe like should we do this or should we\ndo this like is this the answer is this\nthe answer what's the number one thing\nand it's you know all of that stuff just\nsounds good but it doesn't mean anything\nand i feel like today we've really you\nknow dove into some of those\nuh in-betweens and nuances so yeah\nthat's great so i wanted to share thank\nyou for doing that because you've been\nguiding us that way rob i wanted to ask\nyou is there anything that you feel you\nhaven't shared or something that's on\nyour mind or intuitively in your heart\nthey're like jay i have to share this on\nyour podcast or anything right now\nthat's calling you\nwell the book that i'm working on the\nlaw of the sublime\nwhich is taking a long time is probably\ngoing to be three years away for so\nmaybe more\nso it's almost a little bit too much to\ntease people with now but it's something\nthat's it's very important to me because\nback in 2005 2006 i had meant to write a\nbook on the sublime it's a concept that\nfascinates me\nand i got derailed by other projects i\ndid a book with 50 cent yes i did\nmastery\nhuman nature and then i had my stroke\nand the last chapter of the human nature\nis about the sublime about confronting\nmortality\nand so i go this is the time to write\nthis book because it means so much to me\nand it's been brewing in me for 16 years\nso there's something very\nyou know\npersonal about it and the idea is\ni think a problem that a lot of people\nface today\nis that their minds are locked\nthey have only one way of thinking about\nthings they've become so conventional\nand i know it's something i'm not being\njudgement because i have the same\nproblem\nso rigid about this is the way the world\nis this is how things have to be this is\nhow my life has to be this is what\nmeaning is this is where value is in\nlife\nand i compare it to like a circle\nand being a social animal our thoughts\nhave to sort of stay within the circle\nof what ideas are accepted of what\nbehavior is accepted what conventions\nand codes there are and the sublime is\nwhat lies just outside that circle\nwhat isn't really something you're\nsupposed to think isn't so something\nsupposed to do\nisn't a behavior or a value you\nnecessarily are encouraged to have\nbut when your mind touches it tickles it\na little bit\nlike whoa it jolts you alive there's\nanother way of thinking there's another\nway of being in this world how exciting\nright and that's what makes people\nsearch for transcendental experiences\nwhat maslow called peak experiences\nthat's why they climb mountains and\nalmost get close to death and falling\nbecause it gives them that jolt of being\nalive it shakes them up\nand so\nthe ultimate thing be outside that\ncircle is death itself it's the ultimate\nunknown right\nand the word sublime means up to the\nthreshold of a door\nand that door is the door to death\nitself and so when you peek at it and\nyou look at it that's the ultimate in a\nsublime thought right\nokay so that's that of the model but i\nhave these different categories and i\nwant to make you the reader aware\nthat you take so much for granted and i\ndon't want this to be in a polyanish way\nbecause the sublime has an element of\nterror and darkness and fear involved\nbecause death is the is the paradigm\nhere\nbut\nyou don't realize\nin your day-to-day life i've just\nwritten these first two chapters and\nthey're in the daily laws so you'll see\nabout them i've given you some excerpts\nfrom the new book\nbut\nit's insane that you live in a world in\nit the way it is right now if you study\nthe history of the cosmos and how\nunlikely it is that the earth ended up\nbeing the way it is and how rare it is\nthat there may not be life on other\nplanets if there is the rarity of the\nlife that we know of the the prog the\nanimals the evolution the technology\nthat we have\nand then if you look at the course of\nevolution and how improbable it is that\nhumans ever evolved even existed if an\nasteroid hadn't hit the planet\n60 some million years ago dinosaurs\nwould still be around\non and on and on\nmultiplied by the 70 000 generations of\nhomo sapiens that preceded you\nif one of so let's say your parents had\nnever met you would not be here jay\nyou'd maybe you'd be combined in\nsomething else\nokay and think of the narrow possibility\nthat your parents hadn't met\nmultiply that by 70 000 other\ngenerations trailing all the way to the\nfirst homo sapiens\nit's astronomical the odds that you\nexist that you're breathing that you're\nlooking at a world with plants and\nanimals etc\nis staggering and you never think about\nit\nso i'm trying to make you think about\nthings that you never think about in\nthis book and i want you to completely\nalter and make that going beyond the\ncircle sort of more of a daily\noccurrence for you so that's what's on\nmy mind a lot right yeah i love that\nwell i look forward to that i purposely\ndidn't dive into it too much because i\nknow that's right we we need to wait for\nit and i i hope we get to have another\nconversation when that comes out\nbut uh no we look forward to that and i\ni i can agree with you more the\ninconceivable is is such a beautiful\nmeditation in and of itself to meditate\non the inconceivable nature of where we\nare and what's possible and what's\naround us and\nit needs to be part of our daily life\nfor that\nuh entrance into the the splendor and\nand how sublime it can be so yeah i love\nthat and and we look forward to that uh\nrobert we end every on-purpose interview\nthe final five these are the fast five\nrapid fire rounds so answers have to be\none word to one sentence maximum\ni may go off on a tangent but let's see\nso robert green these are your final\nfive the first question is what is the\nbest advice you've ever received i\nremember\nyears ago my\nbrother-in-law said something about\nlearning to watch the grass grow\nbasically the idea\nof things only happen over time\nand i was 21 at the time and i wasn't\nlistening\nand i've learned since then that the\nmost beautiful things occur slowly and\nwith patience and if you can sit there\nand watch the grass grow\nthat's that's pretty great that's\nbeautiful uh what's the worst advice\nyou've received\nuh\nyou need to capitalize on on the 48 laws\nof power and make a lot of money\nwhich i ignored\nthat's brilliant that's a great answer\nthat's a great answer uh third question\nwhat's your current purpose\ni have\ncertain books i want to write that are\nvery mean a lot to me i want to\ncreate them before i die\nbecause i know that my life is short\ni may not have as much time as i want so\nthat's\nto realize all the books that i wanted\nto write question number four is uh\nwhat's something that other people value\nthat you don't it's gonna sound uh not\nright but i'll say it anyway\nit's money\ni mean i have it's easy for me because i\nhave enough of it and i'm comfortable\nbut it's never been my goal\nit's never ruled my life\ndoing what i want to do\nall that money means to me is freedom to\ndo what i want to do i never focus on\nwhat i can do to\nincrease my bank account yeah so um\ni i don't really value it and it drives\nmy mother crazy for instance\nthank you for sharing that i love that\nuh and question number five if you could\ncreate one law in the world that\neveryone had to follow what would it be\nbe yourself be as weird as you want to\nbe stop listening to other people and\ndoing what they tell you just follow\nwhat your soul tells you what makes you\ndifferent and be weird\nwe need more weird people who are more\nindividuals who are unique\nwho create art and businesses that\nreflect themselves so just be you be\nweird\nlet a thousand flowers blooms they used\nto say in china that's beautiful robert\ngreen everyone on on purpose make sure\nyou go and follow robert across social\nmedia and we'll have the links to all of\nrobert's books uh in all the\ndescriptions the daily laws is out as\nyou're listening to this episode and of\ncourse the 48 laws of power and the laws\nof human nature mastery and robert's\nother books are available too robert\ni want to thank you for just being uh\nsuch a wonderful uh guest on the show\nfor making the effort just for those of\nyou who don't know
