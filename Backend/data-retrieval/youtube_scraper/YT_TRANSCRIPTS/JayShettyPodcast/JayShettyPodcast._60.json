    "transcript": "the beautiful Zen saying that you're\nreminding me of this Zen saying says\nthat letting go is hard but holding on\nis harder and often all of our pain is\ncoming because we're holding on to who\nwe were holding on to who we wish we\nwere holding on to what people used to\nlove holding on to what people validated\nwhat people approved and we're holding\non to that and not realizing that\nUniverse the god energy is trying to\ngently take us away but but our holding\non is what's making it so aggressive and\npainful and that's when you know if\nyou're holding on to anything really\nreally tight and it's being taken away\nit's going to hurt you and and I think\nthat's what we all go through we don't\nwant to gracefully accept growth and so\nwe sometimes get aggressively pushed out\nand pushed through it"
