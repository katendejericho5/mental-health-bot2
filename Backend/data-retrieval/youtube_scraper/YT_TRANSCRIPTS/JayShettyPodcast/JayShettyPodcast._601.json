love being a content creator\ni love being so much more\nthan that\nand that's such a big part of my\nidentity it still is a massive part of\nmy life it's it's the foundation of who\ni am but it's not all of me\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you for learning listening and\ngrowing with us every single week now\nyou know that i'm always trying to find\nnew minds new people thought leaders who\nhave insights that can help me learn\nlisten and grow and then i want to share\nthat with you and today's guest when i\nfirst read about her i was blown away\nimmediately and i knew i had to have her\nin the studio for this conversation and\nso we finally are here she came all the\nway she's with us in person i'm talking\nabout none other than maya shankar now\nfor those of you that don't know she's\nthe senior director of behavioral\neconomics at google and is the creator\nhost and executive producer of the\npodcast a slight change of plans where\nshe interviews fascinating guests that i\ncan't wait to talk to her about she\npreviously served as a senior advisor in\nthe obama white house where she founded\nand served as chair of the white house's\nbehavioral science team a team of\nscientists tasked with improving public\npolicy using research insights from\nhuman behavior maya thank you so much\nfor being here uh your resume is\nphenomenal you have an incredible set of\nexpertise i secretly wish i was a\nbehavioral economist so i'm hearing that\nthat comes from my\nbehavioral economics has been like my\npassion since i was 15 years old and i'm\nnot smart enough to be one uh but i get\nto sit with you today and get to pick\nyour brain so thank you for being here\noh my gosh thank you so much for having\nme it's such a pleasure to be with you\nand to be in person with you uh which\nfeels so special at this point in time\nyeah and we've already been talking\noffline and getting on so anyone who's\nlistening to this podcast you're in for\na real tree uh maya is so warm so\nuh relaxed so just just such you have\nsuch a warm energy about yourself i know\nyou were saying that about my wife but\nyou you have the same i need to tell\nyour listeners um so knocked on the door\nand ravi jay's wife opens the door has\nno idea who i am um i'm with my friend\nmadeline and she's greets us in\nabsolutely the warmest way she's like\nhello welcome to my home i have no idea\nwho you are but i'm going to be effusive\nand warm anyway and i was so struck by\num her presence and and that kind of\nenergy and then of course you walk up\nthe stairs and you have exactly the same\nvibe so i know why you guys are married\nit's very sweet to see that in action\nwell we felt the same from you\nimmediately as well and i feel like\nwe're old friends already yeah in the\nway that we're talking and i want to go\nback because i do want to use this as an\nexcuse to get to know you better uh but\nlet's go back to the beginning of your\njourney and i read that you were off to\nbecome a really successful violinist\nand that was the path that you were on\nuntil you experienced an injury\ni want to hear about that journey your\nfascination with music\nand\ntell us about how it all started out\nyeah so when i was six years old my mom\nwent up to her attic and brought down my\ngrandmother's violin that she had\nbrought with her all the way from india\nwhen she immigrated to this country so\nit's one of those few things that she\ncarried with her and when i was six she\nbrought it down from the addict and and\nshowed it to me and\nshe'd only meant for me to see it she\nsaid oh you know i want you know this is\nthis is your potty's instrument right\nthat's how you say grandmother and\nthummel and um i i looked at it and she\nnoticed that\ni was so quickly taken by the instrument\num i very quickly asked for a pint-sized\nviolin of my own and she went to the\nstore and got me a quarter-sized violin\nand\ni was infatuated i mean my mom never had\nto tell me to practice every day i'd\nrush home from school go upstairs open\nmy instrument and i assure you jay i\ndidn't feel that way about everything i\nwas studying in school but the violin\nwas something that just felt like it\ncame so naturally to me\nand so when i was nine years old\nand i was that classic kid with really\nbig dreams and no idea how to get there\nmy mom and i were in new york and\nnow\nmy parents have no connections at this\npoint into the classical music world um\nand so you know my dad's a theoretical\nphysicist my mom helps immigrants get\ngreen cards in this country they had no\nidea how to facilitate you know this\ntransition for me um but then my mom is\nsuch a fearless go-getter so we're\nwalking by the juilliard school of music\nin new york one saturday i happen to\nhave my violin with me and she said\nmaya why don't we just go in what do you\nmean why don't we just go in we don't\nhave an invitation that's why we don't\ngo in that's nuts and she's like let's\njust go in let's see what happens what's\nthe worst thing that can happen i was\nlike well i'll tell you the worst thing\nthat can happen i'm gonna get rejected\nand it's gonna be terrible and my mom\ndidn't care she was like we're going in\nso we walk into juilliard uninvited\nand we stumble upon um a fellow\nclassmate and my mom says hey would you\nmind if uh my daughter auditions for\nyour teacher uh today i know you know we\ndon't have the formal invitation but\nthat would be wonderful and they were so\ngenerous and kind and i auditioned for\nhim and he accessed me into a summer\nprogram and then six months later i\nauditioned for juilliard and get\naccepted so\nwow\nyeah my mom is she's taught me so many\nlessons but one of them was don't wait\nfor\nyou know that silver plate just create\nit right\num and so\nthat began my journey of just being so\nin love with violin and when i was a\nteenager itzhak perlman asked me to be\nhis private violin student and i'm sure\na lot of your listeners can relate to\nthis but when you're in a deeply\ncompetitive environment like juilliard\nyou don't really know if you have what\nit takes to succeed and so when perlman\ntook me on as his student that was the\nvote of confidence that i needed that\nlike oh maybe i do actually have what it\ntakes and so i was even able to convince\nmy parents that i should you know i\nwanted to go pro and they were finally\nlike okay fine you don't have to do the\nliberal arts education you can go to a\nconservatory for college so i had\neveryone on board\nand then like you mentioned when i was\n15 i had a son-in-hand injury and um\nbasically overnight doctors told me that\ni could never play the violin again\nand\nas you can imagine i was just completely\ndespondent because\nthe violin had played such a formative\nrole in my life up until that point\ni felt like i was first and foremost a\nviolinist right it was my identity\nand\nyou know there's this interesting\nuh insight from cognitive science which\nsays\nuh which is about this concept called\nidentity foreclosure and refers to the\nfact that\nwe can get really fixed in certain\nidentities especially in adolescence i\nmean it can carry through into adulthood\nbut certainly in adolescence\nand i fell prey to that i kind of felt\nlike\nfor the first time ever i was asking all\nthese existential questions about myself\nlike who am i you know who am i without\nthe violin i'd never thought to ask\nmyself that question before\nand in many ways um\nhaving being forced to pivot at that\nmoment in my life\nhas given me a much more malleable sense\nof self a much more malleable identity\nand i think that's served me well as\ni've you know\nendured life's twists and turns yeah wow\ni mean i can't imagine what it feels\nlike\nto be that age and be told you can't\nplay an instrument again and you know\nsomething that you've built up such a\nclose relationship with over nine years\ni mean tell us about what you were\nfeeling how did it affect your\nconfidence because i'm guessing at that\ntime as well when your identity is\nwrapped up in\nbeing a performer or being a violinist\nand you have this incredible mentor and\nthen that's taken away what is that what\ndid that feel like and\nyou know what what did that kind of push\nyou towards what what changed about you\nat that point yeah it's a fantastic\nquestion um\ni resisted it for a while i was the\nimpatient teenager that was like i'm\ngonna get through this damn those\ndoctors i don't care what they say well\nactually those doctors were super right\nand i needed to just have listened to\nthem from the beginning\nbut i think what it taught me was\nsomething\nvery important which was\nit was much more stable and sturdy for\nme to attach my identity\nnot to\na specific thing\nbut to the traits of that thing that lit\nme up\nand so when i dug deeper i realized you\nknow my child brain thought well i love\nthe violin i love the instrument i love\nthe way it feels i love the sounds it\nproduce but actually jay the thing that\nreally got me ticking\nis the fact that my instrument allowed\nme to forge\na close emotional connection with people\nalmost effortlessly so imagine i'm a kid\nright nine years old\ni go onto a stage there's thousands of\npeople in the audience that i've never\nmet before they've never met me\nand within moments\ni'm\nallowing them to feel something they've\nnever felt before right we have\nsome sort of\nemotional intimacy and bond that's\nforming between us just because the\nmusic that i'm playing\nand\ni realized like well that's what i'm\nactually passionate about it's human\nconnection i mean that's probably why i\nresponded so much to your warmth right\nbecause that's genuinely what makes me\ntick in life is connecting with other\nhuman beings trying to understand what\nmotivates them what pains them what\nbrings them joy\nand i feel like that led me down this\npath to studying the human mind in all\nof its intricacies right the science\nbehind the human mind and in many ways\nit led me to this new podcast i've been\ncreating a slight change of plans where\ni have this license now to go into a\nroom\nand interview people like hillary\nclinton and tiffany haddish and others\nand say hey uh hillary apropos of\nnothing um\nwhat is your biggest insecurity what's\nthe hardest moment of your life you know\nyou can cut through all the pleasantries\nand just really dig deep and i think\nwhen i look over the course of my life\nthat is the common thread it's this deep\ndesire to emotionally connect with those\naround me and i've just tried to find\nthat in other pursuits and\nyou know for those listening i feel like\nif you're going through a hard time\nwhere you're being forced to pivot try\nto identify\nwhat features or traits of things that\nyou like and then try to engage in an\nexploration to figure out where else\nthey might exist in other domains yeah\ni'm so glad you raised that point i\nthink that's so powerful like we get so\nobsessed with activities and identities\nshaped around activities and it's not\nabout activities it's about the aspects\nthe subtle things the\nthe role you get to play the\nrelationship you have with that thing\nthat makes a difference i i often say to\npeople like people think like\nyour purpose is to be a speaker or your\npurpose is to be a podcaster and it's\nlike well none of those are a purpose\nthey are vehicles and they are platforms\nand their\nmodes of sharing a message but the\npurpose is the reason why you do it and\nyour intention and what you put into it\ni think we all get so lost with like\nwell what's the activity that i want to\ndo so i love how you broke that down and\nsimplified that but you also gave me a\nfew good uh you also gave me a few good\nquestions to ask you now based on what\nyou've been asking other people so i'm\ngoing to be using them on you i was\ngoing in that direction i wanted to know\nsince then what do you think is the most\ndifficult\nexperience you've personally gone\nthrough since then so that was obviously\na big thing at 15 16.\nwhat since then has been probably the\nbiggest personal challenge that you feel\nyou've been faced with\nyeah i mean in many ways\nit's hard to identify a discreet moment\ni think the biggest challenge one faces\nis\ngrowing into themselves\nand\ni think for me if i were to summarize\nthe biggest challenge in my own life it\nis it is the acceptance of certain parts\nof my personality that i wish were\ndifferent that i just need to be okay\nwith and to manage in life in spite of\nthose things right um give me an example\ni'm incredibly impatient i want\neverything to have happened yesterday\nand that impatience can have lots of\nnegative i mean my mom would always say\nwhen i was a kid that she's like before\ni know it you were running across the\nstreet you wouldn't wait for like the\nlight to turn she's like i was always\nterrified something was going to happen\nto you so\ni've always seen my impatience as being\na negative thing\nbut then i think about the parts of my\nlife in which that impatience has really\nserved me well so a good example of this\nis\num so quick backstory so\nas i mentioned to you i discovered\ncognitive science and i ended up\nbecoming an academic so\ni did my phd i did my postdoc in\ncognitive neuroscience\nand i remember there was this moment um\ni was in the basement of i was at\nstanford at the time so i was in the\nbasement of fmri laboratory and i was\nscanning this guy's brain i'd probably\nbeen in this windowless room in the\nbasement for about five hours at this\npoint\nso he comes in and within moments i'm\npeering into his brain and i'm thinking\nto myself\ngiven my personality i feel like the\norder of operations is a little off here\nlike i don't know whether this guy has\nkids i don't know what he's passionate\nabout i don't know if he has children i\ndon't know what his favorite ice cream\nflavor is these are important questions\njay i don't know anything about him and\nyet i'm peering into his brain which\nfeels really intimate so i remember\nthinking to myself\ni'm too social for this like i i need to\npivot in some way\nand i didn't know what to do because\nwhat does the postdoc in cognitive\nneuroscience do other than become an\nacademic become a professor\nso i ended up talking with my\nundergraduate mentor who i know you know\nlaurie santos i didn't realize that yeah\nyeah so she was like i love laura\ni did not know that i don't know how i\nmissed that yeah she's one of my closest\nfriends and um has been an incredible\nmentor to me ever since freshman year of\ncollege i can share the story how we met\nat some point later but anyway um i call\nher up and i'm i'm saying to her\nuh laurie so the thing i've been doing\nfor the last 10 years i'm kind of in\nlike a jk moment where i no longer want\nto be doing this but what the hell do i\ndo next should i try to become a general\nmanagement consultant like i don't\nunderstand what i can do so she tells me\nmaya um there's this incredible work\nhappening in the white house right now\nwhere they are using insights from our\nfield from the science of decision\nmaking and it is changing people's lives\nso for example\nthey are\nchanging the default settings in this\nschool lunch program that helps\nlow-income kids eat lunch every day and\ninstead of it being an opt-in program\nthey're making it an opt-out program so\nthat all eligible kids are automatically\nenrolled without the need for a\nburdensome application or this stigma\nassociated with signing up your kids for\na public benefits program\nand now parents only need to take a step\nif they want to actively unenroll their\nkids from the program so as a result of\nthat change 12 and a half million more\nkids were eating school at lunch every\nday\nso i'm thinking to myself um so this\ngets to the impatience piece right\nthinking to myself oh my gosh\ni want to have that job um but that job\ndoesn't exist it just was work that was\nhappening there's no role for a\nbehavioral scientist\nand so i go home that day\nand uh i laurie makes you know some\nconnections for me and you fly to dc and\nwalk into the white house like you\nwalked into julia that's that's what\nhappens right it's actually pretty close\nto that day\ni sent a cold email to an obama advisor\nhe doesn't know who i am i'm riding off\nthe coattails of famous people like\nlaurie santos and cass sunstein who\nwrote the book nudge and they're helping\nguide the way um but i basically\ninterview with the white house official\ntwo days after i send this email\ni moved to dc without having a formal\noffer letter i remember i sold\neverything in california other than my\nbike i signed a one-year lease in dc and\ni was like i'm here whether you all like\nit or not because i need to be here so\nthat impatience kicked in and then it\nreally kicked in when i was at the white\nhouse where\ni had this big grand goal to build a\nteam of behavioral scientists and i\nwasn't given a mandate or budget to do\nso and that impatient personality really\nhelped me thrive there where i refused\nto take no for an answer i push people\nevery day i was like every day matters\nin this administration and look we had\nno idea what's coming next but even from\nthat vantage point you know every every\nday mattered so much and so\ni um\ni feel like accepting the parts of\nmyself that i haven't always liked and\ntrying to figure out if there are silver\nlinings to those traits like my husband\nand i will often do this even in our\nrelationship right where i'll be like\ni'll be like jimmy\nyou're being too much of a people\npleaser like you need to just say no to\nthe person and he'll remind me he'll be\nlike you know maya the fact that i can\nbe a people pleaser sometimes does make\nme a very loving husband you know i am\nvery kind i'm like oh you are really\nkind and loving you're so right and so i\nthink my husband jimmy has helped me\nif we can do that with each other remind\neach other that traits are complicated\nand complex and they have pros and cons\nand we should give ourselves the same\ncompa you know we should we should\nconstantly remind ourselves um and he\nyou know he was teaching me by role\nmodeling it with himself um i should\nremember that there are also some pros i\nlove that is he a behavioral economist\ntoo he's actually uh a software engineer\nokay right okay i was just like where is\nhe like you know but he's very wise i\nfeel like he is a behavioral economist\nat times can i can i ask you that same\nquestion though which is is there a\ntrait in you where\nyou didn't always embrace it but you've\nlearned over time that there might be a\nyou know it's a double exposure no it's\nreally interesting when i think about i\ni have to stop to think about if there's\na trait i i feel that way about when you\nstarted talking about that the first\nthing that came to my mind was\nand i've been feeling this a lot lately\nand i've been talking about it's this\nidea of when i lived as a monk\ni was trying so hard to be a monk\nand now i've realized that that's just\none part of me i love being a\nmessenger through media i love being a\nthinker i love being a content creator i\nlove i love being so much more\nthan that yeah and that's such a big\npart of my identity it still is a\nmassive part of my life it's it's the\nfoundation of who i am but it's not all\nof me\ni'm an entrepreneur i'm a married man\nand i and i love being married and i\nlove being an entrepreneur and i love\nstrategy and marketing and i love all\nthese things which wouldn't you wouldn't\nthink a monk\nlikes all those things and so it took me\na lot of time to kind of unravel\nwhat that identity was where i saw\nmyself for such a long part of my life\nor such a deep part of my life as a monk\nand now to realize that's a part of me\nand not all of me yeah and and i think\nso i'm i'm trying to think of a trait to\ngive you a more specific answer\ni think i've always been pretty\nself-assured and so i think i've turned\nstuff probably earlier than yeah people\nwould and that's\neither that's my illusion or delusion\nand i'm okay with that but yeah i'd say\nthat intensity i always talk about\nintensity as one of my traits i'm a very\nintense person if i'm focused i'm very\nlaser focused i\nand that causes a lot of issues because\ni can have tunnel vision i can be\ncompletely\ndedicated and obsessed with something\nand not care about everything else for\nthat time but i've also realized that's\nwhat helps me\nlearn and grow quicker and accelerate\nand move forward and so i i actually\nthink if you look at every one of your\ntraits you're right you'll find a pro\nand a con for every trait we have\nexactly and and you have to\ni think we have to learn how to\nuse them\nin a way that helps us serve ourselves\nand serve others as opposed to use them\nin a way that\nforces other people to have to change\nand i think that's the part i think\nthat's the part that i'm becoming more\nand more conscious of as a trait is the\ntrait of\nbeing extremely focused on something\nshouldn't stop you from being aware of\nother people's feelings and i think if i\ncan get that subtlety right\nthen then i'm gonna win yeah but if i\ndon't have that subtlety i've worked\nwith so many clients that that's exactly\nthe subtlety they didn't have and then\nthat led to destruction their families\ntheir marriage their personal lives or\nwhatever it may have been in the pursuit\nof greatness in a certain regard does\nthat make sense it does make sense and\nit's making me think too as i'm\nlistening to you share this with me\ni think well of course you should\nembrace that jay that's what makes you\nso special and unique and rare\nand of course there's a silver lining\nlike look at your life look at the\npositive impact you've had on so many\nand what i'm realizing is that i so\neffortlessly\nsee other people through that lens but\nbecause i think as people as humans\nwe're just so hard on ourselves we\nrarely turn it around and say\nwell why don't you view yourself with\nthat same complexity yes and maybe\nthat's the that's been the hardest thing\ni've gone through is trying to use that\nsame amount of compassion with myself\nyeah and and if it's not our place to\nsay i also think it's it's the\ndifference in gender and men and women\ntoo i do think that\ni have\nmale privilege in that you are just a\nbit more self-assured and more confident\nbecause it's been reaffirmed whereas\nfrom the studies i've read and you could\nprobably speak to this a million times\nmore than i can but women are more\nlikely to look at a job description and\nthink oh my gosh i can't do seven out of\nthose ten things whereas a man will look\nat and go oh but i could do three out of\nten that's good enough and that kind of\ndiscrepancy i don't know how you feel\nabout that and how that affects it but\nyeah no i definitely i mean\nthe studies are really compelling\nshowing that there are disparities and\num you know it's reminding me\nnobody's immune to those effects so i\nremember so for my podcast a slight\nchange of plans you know i had the honor\nof interviewing hillary clinton\nand what that interview taught me is\nthat\nhillary clinton didn't come out of the\nbox hillary clinton she had to go\nthrough her own\npersonal journey and development and\nalso resolve a lot of the insecurities\nand anxieties that you and i are talking\nabout right now so i remember she was\ntelling me she was sharing this story\nabout how\nshe just left the white house as first\nlady\nand she'd always been tethered to her\nhusband's identity right\num\nthat had been the role that she had\nplayed and she was very productive in\nthat role but it wasn't her role\nand she\nso fervently believed that women should\nrun for offices and be in leadership\npositions and be in power so she was\nmotivating all these people around her\nto do that\nand one day she was an event\npromoting women in sports\nand\nthis basketball player leaned down and\nwhispered into her ear\ndare to compete mrs clinton dare to\ncompete\nand she said she was astonished in that\nmoment because\nno one had said it to her like that but\nshe realized suddenly\nmaybe i'm too afraid to do the thing\nthat i've been asking everybody else to\ndo maybe i don't think i'm good enough\nmaybe i don't know if i have what it\ntakes and if people will like me and if\ni have the right presence for politics\nand\nthat was so powerful to hear from\nsomeone like her yeah you know wow even\nhillary at times felt this and then to\nsee where she's come from there i mean\ntalk about inspiring right she was able\nto overcome all of that\nand um go on to accomplish incredible\nthings and\ni think that experience showed me that\nwe all have this kind of i mean it\nsounds so cliche but it's so true it's\nlike we all have some degree of\nself-doubt yeah and it's just a matter\nof finding ways to manage that and\nlearning from other people's experiences\nabsolutely i want to i want to backtrack\na bit to\nfirst of all having south asian parents\nand being encouraged to play the violin\nand go to juilliard and then like just\nyour whole journey i'm i'm fascinated by\nyour parents sound amazing you're\nwonderful tell us a bit about what it\nwas like like what did you feel that\nother children in the south asian\ndiaspora were encouraged in the same\ndirection did you feel like an anomaly i\nwanna i wanna hear about how you felt on\nthat journey because it's very unique\nyeah i mean\ni'm not sure whether other south asian\nkids were following that journey at that\ntime\nbecause i grew up yeah i was going to\nsay i grew up in a primarily caucasian\nwow um hometown and we were one of the\nfew families of color anywhere um\nhow did that feel with like tell me a\nbit about that because i think that the\nsouth asian experience in england is\nvery different than the south asian\nexperience in the u.s so yeah\ni i think\ni was so eager to assimilate everything\nfrom you know i have like textured hair\nand\ni remember going to a birthday party and\nall the girls with the smooth shiny hair\ngot got like the pretty scrunchies and i\nwas given a headband it was like the one\ngirl that didn't get i mean\nclearly i'm over this jay it's not like\ni still remember it i don't know i'm\nlaughing and i'm laughing that's the\nworst\ntotally but it's like these small things\num i just so desperately wanted to be\num like the girls that i saw at school\nand you know my dad remembers when i'd\nwrite all these stories as a kid i\nwouldn't use indian names for my\ncharacters it was always katherine and\nlindsay and katie and you know and so um\nit took me a long time to really feel\ncomfortable in my skin and i think one\nthing that actually\nhelped me on that front is well one i'm\none of four kids so i always felt huge\nsense of tribalism like it's my family\nagainst the world you know um and my\nparents were always deeply proud of\nbeing indian and i loved that i mean\nespecially looking back you know it's\nlike my mom is a brilliant chef she made\nus amazing meals at the time i was like\nwe should just get pizza and i'm like oh\nmy god i had gourmet food in my home\ngrowing up how could i not have\nappreciated it um so they were fiercely\nproud of being indian and\nwhile i rejected it as a child i think i\ngrew into it and then you know now i'm\nfiercely proud to be indian\nand it's funny one of the jobs that i\nhad right before grad school was working\nat sesame street\nand um i worked on the indian version of\nthe show no way and yeah there's an\nindian version of what i love about\nsesame street jay a lot of people don't\nknow that i love it\nis that\nit\nchanges young children's minds\num in ways that families can embrace so\nfor example in this was back in the day\ni don't know the show how the show's\nevolved but in the south african version\nthe main muppet character is hiv\npositive she's always taking her\nmedications on time it's reducing the\nstigma around hiv\nand then in israel the main muppets one\nis an arab muslim and one's the israeli\njew and they're best friends and they\nboth love hummus and they bond in all\nthese ways and in the indian version the\nmain character chumky is always wearing\nher backpack she's committed to going to\nschool it's all about you know young\ngirls thriving in school\nand so\nwhat i did was um i worked to\ndomesticate the indian version of the\nshow so that families in the united\nstates could have it\nso that young kids growing up could feel\nthe sense of pride that i wish i had\nfelt it as a youngster if it only came\nlater so they could grow up hearing\nlanguages like hindi in their homes and\ngrow up seeing young kids young muppets\neating indian food eating with their\nhands you know um and so\nyeah i mean it was a very interesting\nexperience for my parents to come here\nand you know my older three siblings had\na lot of exposure to thumbel our mother\ntongue by the time i came around you\nknow they were like i think the kids\nshould just assimilate you know like no\neverywhere we're all just figuring this\nout for ourselves um but i did spend my\ngraduate years um in england i did my my\nd fill uh and it did feel like the south\nasian experience was very different\nthere so i don't know if any anything\ni've shared resonates or doesn't\nresonate with your experience yeah no i\ni think a lot of it does actually like\nthe idea of i think in your early years\nto kind of be embarrassed or shy or\nunconfident about your indian experience\nso like when my mom would make me an\nindian lunch to take to school like i\nwould eat it in the corner and hope that\nno one could smell it or whatever and\nand now i feel the same way as you do my\nmom made amazing food and you know i\nyou're right we had gourmet meals at\nhome and i'm i was when you were saying\nthat all i was thinking it was josiah\ni'm a massive fan\nyou know but the idea of just\nlike starting to understand the value of\nthat culture and then sharing it out but\ni love what you were sharing about\nsesame street i didn't i had no idea so\ni wish i had that to watch too i didn't\nhave any of that to watch when i was\ngrowing up so i can imagine the the\nimpact of that\ntell us about\nyou know you've been studying human\nbehavior that's your fascination it's\nyour it's your deep passion you've done\nit at the highest levels and are doing\nit at the highest levels what's\nsomething that you've learned through\nthat about human behavior\nthat scares you about humans like what's\nsomething that's kind of like\ndifficult or uncomfortable\nas a researcher to come across and then\nyou're trying to figure out or reconcile\nhow to\nhopefully aid it or cure it that's a\nfascinating question i've never been\nasked that before and it's such an\nimportant one to ask because we have to\nbe honest about the human condition and\nhuman nature\ni think the scariest thing um given the\nstate of the research right now is that\nwhile it can be easy to inspire behavior\nchange in people\nit is incredibly hard for people to\nchange their minds\nand i think\nas a culture as a society we are\nexperiencing this in spades right now in\na time when things feel incredibly\ndivided and divisive and\num you know we can't even have a normal\nthanksgiving dinner anymore right it's\ntragic\nwhat i've learned is that\nyou know we know that people can\ndisagree even on empirical matters right\nlike is climate change real or\nis the coronavirus real or does gun\ncontrol reform actually reduce gun\ndeaths\nand it's tempting for people who have a\nmore empirical mind to think well i'll\njust give them more facts this is just\nthe result of an information gap right i\ncan easily fill the gap just by showing\nthem the data showing them the evidence\nbut we know from research that this is\nmissing a huge part of the puzzle\nand the piece that's missing is people\ndo not generate their attitudes and\nbeliefs just based on facts\nthey generate their attitudes and\nbeliefs about the worlds in part based\non their membership to different groups\nand the values those groups hold\nand so there's this\nreally interesting um study it's\nactually from the 50s and it involved uh\ncontroversial referee calls during a\nfootball game\nand they had people who were fans of\nopposing teams watched this footage of\nthese controversial calls and even\nthough they were watching exactly the\nsame footage\ntheir assessments\nof these calls vary considerably based\non their group membership based on their\nteam loyalty\nso those people who were fans of one\nteam\ntended to feel like the unfair calls\nwere in their direction and vice versa\nright\nand what's astonishing to me about that\nresearch and the reason i mention it is\nit's not like these folks are\nconsciously aware\noh i know that i'm not able to be biased\ni know that i'm seeing a warped version\nof reality of course not this is their\nreality and it shows how potent these\ngroup memberships are\nthat they can actually affect people's\nperception of reality\nand so what that means in practice is\nthat when it comes to bridging divides\nwe need to use different techniques than\njust throwing information at people yes\num one of my favorite uh findings from\nbehavioral economics to your point about\nwhether we can ameliorate some of these\nconcerns\num comes from a domain called moral\nreframing\nand it's research that shows that\nit's much more effective to\nhold people's values as fixed\nand present\nan argument or present a position in\nways that affirm those values rather\nthan threaten them\nso for example\num\nif you are trying to convince\na conservative to care more about the\nenvironment you might frame it as\ncaring about the environment\nmeans preserving our nature's beauty our\nnation our natural beauty right it is\npatriotic to care about the environment\nyou're talking with a liberal you might\nfocus on the fact that investing in\nclimate change uh reform\ncan actually help elevate those with\nsocioeconomically underprivileged status\nright it can help them thrive\nand so\nin both cases it's the same policy\nobjective you're trying to get people to\ncare about the climate\nbut you are taking into account what\ntheir existing value systems are so if\nthey don't feel that in agreeing with\nyou\nthey're threatening their tribal\nmembership yes and that helps me build a\nlot of empathy for people right now\nbecause\nlet's take the coronavirus right it's so\neasy to think\nit's just a mask it's just a damn piece\nof cloth like just wear one already i\npromise you it'll make you safe but when\nyou look at it through the lens of\npsychology through cognitive science you\nrealize\nwearing a mask for a person can carry\nhuge symbolic significance\nand it could potentially threaten the\nrelationships in their life that they\nhold most sacred and so when you have\nthat in mind i just think it's the in\ngeneral i think studying the human mind\nis the greatest empathy builder that\nexists out there because the minute you\nuncover\nwhy it is that a person has a particular\nbelief\nthen there's an element of understanding\nyes that allows you to approach the\nperson differently and for them to\napproach you differently potentially and\nfor you to try to make uh to meet\nhalfway you know yeah i couldn't agree\nmore that was a beautiful answer by the\nway and and\nyou know as as scary as it is\nyou are right that the study of the\nhuman mind is potentially the only\nantidote because then you start to see\nhow you're caught in the in your own\ntrap yourself and i think that's the\nhardest part as you're saying with those\nfans they couldn't see\nthat they were being really biased or\nyou know that they were getting lost on\none side because of their affiliation\nand they just couldn't see that and not\nbeing able to see that not being able to\nstep back and be an observer\nand take your\ntake the home jersey off take the away\njersey off and just be the referee\nyourself\nand it's that's almost like we need\nreferee vision like you need to be able\nto see the game as hopefully an unbiased\nreferee would to be able to truly make\nthe right calls\nand sorry yeah yeah no i i completely\nagree with that i also think\nthe wonderful thing about being in my\nfield is that\nit is serving up solutions um and is\ngiving us\ntactics that we can use in our\nday-to-day life when we converse with\nthose we disagree with so\num i was talking about this with adam\ngrant who i had on my podcast recently i\nlove adam huge fan\num he's wonderful and i was talking\nabout how i had interviewed daryl davis\nfor for my podcast and daryl davis is a\nblack jazz musician\nwho\nwas approached by a member of the ku\nklux klan when he was performing at a\nbar one night wow\nand\nthe guy at the bar said hey i love your\nmusic man it's it's incredible and then\ndaryl finds out that this man is from\nthe clan\num and he he he starts to ask himself a\nseries of questions like\nhow is it that these people can hate me\nwithout even knowing me and so he he\nends up pivoting in his life talk about\na slight change of plans um and ends up\ninspiring\nhundreds of people to leave white\nsupremacy groups\nand\nit's an astonishing story of how someone\nwho\nhas every card stacked against them even\nin terms of personal safety having these\nconversations conducting these\ninterviews with members of the clan\ncould find a way to penetrate\ntheir minds and ultimately get them to\nmake one of the greatest leaps we can\nsee in terms of mindset change which is\ngoing from\nbelieving in absolute vitriol\nto\nturning their backs on the clan\nand what i loved about my interview with\nhim jay is that\nso much of what he was sharing is\ncorroborated by the science so we know\nwhen it comes to changing people's minds\ncertain tactics are very effective\nyou want to show genuine curiosity for\nwhy that person has their beliefs\nyou want to increase your question to\nstatement ratio so you're asking them\nwell how did you arrive you know at this\nbelief in the first place and\nwhat evidence would in theory change\nyour mind what would you have to learn\nin order to think differently about this\nand one reason i love that question is\nthat it presupposes that they ought to\nbe willing to change their mind in the\nface of evidence which is not something\nwe can always take for granted\nand then there's other techniques like\nyou try to affirm that you're not\nquestioning their morals they're not\nquestioning their values or their\nhumanity over the course of the\nconversation you're just simply trying\nto understand why it is that they\nbelieve in something and i think the\nmost powerful one and this is something\ndaryl shared with me is\nhe doesn't like to say that he changed\npeople's minds he likes to say that he\ninspired them to change their own minds\nand the science there corroborates that\nbeautiful poignant statement which is\nyou want to recruit their own sense of\nagency you want to make them feel that\nit was them who decided to change their\nminds you arm them with new perspectives\nwith information with your own personal\nstory but let them wrestle with all that\nand then\nthe sturdiness of a mindset change that\na person themselves inspires is\nfar greater than trying to impose a set\nof beliefs on someone yeah i can agree\nmore i often find that when\nwhen we're presenting something to\nsomeone and they're not taking up to it\nwe think it's because of their weakness\nand often it's our weakness in the\npresentation right it's like if\nsomething's not been clearly articulated\nor presented to someone or in a way they\ncan digest it they may not remember it\nand they may not understand it\nbut the responsibility of that force so\nmuch more on\nthose of us that feel we know\nand are sharing this new way or\nalternative path yeah and and i found\nthat so much so in you know the work i\ndo when i'm working with people on which\neffectively is changing their behavior\nand\ni\nvery early on a lot of people ask me\nlike don't you get frustrated when\nsomeone doesn't start meditating after\nyou've been telling them about\nmeditation whatever it may be and i'm\njust like i don't because i know how\nlong it took me\nto start meditating to tell you now that\ni don't meditate even though i know i\nshould do it that's awesome because i\nknow you're gonna be empathetic yeah i\nknow exactly because it's just first of\nall i know how long it took me\nsecond of all i know i know how hard it\nis and i've seen this research on\npeople's minds and i haven't done it but\ni've seen it and read it and i can also\njust\nrecognize that\ni still haven't said something that\nlets the penny drop for them right like\ni i there's somewhere where i need to go\nand then and usually what i found is\nit's not what i say or even what i do\nit's an experience they need to have and\nthat's kind of the question i've always\nbeen asking is what experience has this\nperson not had yet\nthat will help them change their mind\nbecause if they have that experience\nthen that's theirs kind of what you're\nsaying like then that's theirs to keep\nbut if their experience is only through\nwhat i tell them\nthen that's not their experience it's my\nexperience and so for me it's always\nbeen about creating and facilitating\nexperiences and experiments for people\nto help them get their own research and\ndata and their own conclusion\nuh rather than saying or doing anything\nand so i'm always fascinated by\nhow you can use experiments and\nexperiences to\nto help people have a new you know a\nnewfound solution that they didn't even\ncomprehend before yeah i love the way\nthat you just said it that's my\nexperience not theirs and it reminds me\nyou know one of the women that i\ninterviewed for a slight change of plans\nher name is megan phelps roper and she\ngrew up in the westboro baptist church i\ndon't know if you're familiar with this\nchurch but it is\num the southern poverty law center i\nthink refers to them as the most rabid\nhate group in america so they are\nhomophobic anti-semitic basically they\nhate everybody who's not a member of the\nchurch and\nthey do abhorrent things like show up at\nmilitary gay like gay military funerals\nthey wanted to protest the sandy hook\nshooting i mean it's horrible\nand megan grew up in this church her\ngrandfather was the founder\nand she was absolutely indoctrinated i\nmean she was steeped in the ideology\nfrom a very very young age and she grew\nup to become one of those one of their\nmost ardent\nvocal\nadvocates for the church\nand\npeople engage end up engaging with her\non twitter actually in this very\ncompassionate way that you and i have\nbeen talking about where\nthey tried to just help her understand\nthat maybe there were a few holes here\nand there that's how they you know the\nvery slow process and they would\nreaffirm her humanity and um they would\njust point out some inconsistencies like\nthe moral reframing stuff that i was\nsaying but they would they wouldn't say\nmegan what you believe is batshit crazy\nthey would say you know actually there's\na few issues here and there\nand\nwhat she says so she ended up leaving\nthe church in her mid-20s which meant\nleaving her family behind and\nleaving basically everything she ever\nbelieved to be true behind and i asked\nher this question right i said\nhow do you think about your family\nright and the fact that they haven't\nleft like what gives you hope how do you\nthink about your former self you know\nand she said\ni don't try to detach myself from my\nformer self even though\ni disagree one million percent with what\nthat former self was like because\ni\ncan then feel close to the person that i\nwas\nand the person that i was was someone\nwho was persuaded by absolutely terrible\nideas\nand then one day saw the light\nand that gives me hope that if my family\nexperiences the same thing that i\nexperienced if people treat them in\nexactly the way they treated me maybe\nthere's hope for them too\nso it's exactly what you just described\nwhereas where she knows i can't just\ni'm not able to just tell them that this\nis wrong\nbut i'm hopeful because i saw that\njourney in myself i am a convert and so\ni believe that if i can just\nset up the right environments for them\nto get that kind of exposure they could\npotentially leave too yeah it's that\nidea of like people don't have a remote\ncontrol that has the fast forward button\non life so you can't see the future\nimplications of your current action yeah\nand you can see it around you but it\nnever feels you it never feels like it's\nabout you and so i the reason why it\nresonates so strongly with me is because\nand we spoke about this a bit earlier\nbefore offline but i was someone who\nexperimented with a lot of drugs when i\nwas young but i never got addicted\nobsessed or never really got into doing\nsomething for a long period of time and\nthe only reason why that happened is i\nmet one of my friend's aunt who was an\naddict\nand i saw her have a fit in front of me\nand it was such a traumatic experience\nwhere we thought she was going to die\nand she didn't thankfully we you know we\ncall the ambulance and everything else\nbut it was like it was such a like\ntraumatic live event of seeing someone\nwho was an addict to a particular\nsubstance to then go through that in\nfront of us as young man and for me to\ngo okay i'm never messing around with\nthis stuff ever again and it was like an\nexperience and it's the same way i think\nabout what you were saying earlier that\nfacts don't work like we know every\ncigarette pack has the label the label\nand it's never worked they're like you\nknow that doesn't stop people but when\nsomeone loses someone in their life or\nwhen someone hears about someone i'm\ngetting an unfortunate diagnosis because\nof one of their habits\nit it starts to change their mind tell\nme about\nsomething that we talked about traits\nthat you've started to see both sides of\ndo you think that works for everything\nor have there been certain behavioral\nchanges you've made in your life that\nyou felt just had to be transformations\nfor you so i think for me\nuh exercise has been the thing that\ni really had to introduce behavioral\nchanges around\nbecause i've seen\ni almost don't do it for fitness reasons\njay i do it for my mind\nand it is so powerful for my mind like\nthe days that i work out versus the days\nthat i don't feel totally different to\nme um\nand\ni've actually used some behavioral\nchange insights to motivate me to\nexercise so i'll share one of those with\nyou yeah um it's an insight that was\ngenerated by my friend katie milkman\nwho's a professor\nwho studies change and it's called\ntemptation bundling and the logic behind\nthis is to\npair up an undesirable activity with a\ndesirable activity\nand you're only allowed to do the\ndesirable activity\nif it accompanies the undesirable one\nwow\nso one of my favorite things in life is\nto discover a new pop song okay\ni'm into all of it like of course taylor\nswift\num i guess casey muskrace isn't pop\nshe's someone i interviewed my podcast i\nlove her music but she's you know she's\ngenre defying yeah um but i love\ndiscovering a new song but i know\nbecause of the way the brain adapts that\ni'll only get like 30 or 40 really good\nlistens out of a song before it becomes\nold hat right right and so\ni save it\ni only listen to these songs when i'm on\nthe treadmill or i'm lifting weights or\ni'm on the elliptical and my poor\nhusband because he'll be like oh my gosh\nwe're cooking dinner let's play the new\ncasey mustard album and i'm like we do\nnot play recreationally okay it needs to\nbe saved for these sacred moments when\ni'm working out\nand so\nuh it's been wonderful to like you know\neven though i study change for a living\neven though i'm a behavioral economist\ni fall prey to all the same human biases\nthat we all fall prey to of course and\nso i'm using these strategies every\nsingle day in my life to try to optimize\nand reach some of these longer terms i\nlove that one so wait is there research\nthat actually says you're only going to\nget 30 to 40 plays out of some is there\nreasons that goes along no this is just\nthe maya formula i have no idea what it\nis for you jay\ni think given your your your monk days\nyou're probably closer to like 100\nbecause you'll see dimensions of the\nsong that i can't possibly appreciate\ngiven your death and my relative\nsuperficiality um but for me it's about\n30 and then i'm done that's amazing that\nis such a no but you know that's\nbrilliant i love that that is the most\ninteresting unique piece of advice that\ni think you know that's gonna help so\nmany people who i can imagine everyone\nnow talking to their partner or their\nfriend today going i turn that song off\nright now like i'm only i'm only using\nit for those painful moments in life\nthat's genius i love that and and that's\na maya shankar original special i love\nthat it's brilliant uh\ntell us a bit about what you're doing on\na day-to-day basis i i find like you\nknow you have this role at google\nand you're studying human behavior on a\nday-to-day basis i find there's two\nquestions here the first question is\ntell me what you do on a day-to-day\nbasis what's fascinating about it\nbecause i have no idea what you do on a\nday-to-day basis uh the more the more\ninteresting question for you probably\nwill be the second one which is what is\nan area that you think behavioral\neconomists haven't\nreally uncovered or understood yet\nbecause\nso when i've read books about behavioral\nscience or behavioral economists it's\nbeen about the relationship between\nmoney and human behavior the\nrelationships between\nuh everything from lying and stealing in\nhuman behavior through to you know about\nthe different character traits\nor the idea of giving and service and\nhuman behavior but i'm wondering what's\nan area that you're fascinated to\nuncover and you think we're just\nscratching the surface on we don't\nactually know a lot about\nyeah but i love that question i think\none area and this is actually something\ni was also talking about with katie\nmilkman is\nhow durable some of these behavioral\nchange insights are yes such a good\nquestion it's so hard because\nbehavior change that's a one-time thing\nlike the decision to sign up for\nretirement or get your covet vaccine or\nremember to call your mom on her\nbirthday that's a\nmaybe a once a year type of commitment\nor maybe a once-in-a-lifetime type of\ncommitment and then you're done and from\na public policy perspective we become\nexcellent at this so i remember when i\nwas working in the obama white house um\ni was able to\nwork on a lot of these nudges where you\nshift just one thing\nand then the person's life potentially\nhas changed forever so i talked to you\nabout the school lunch program right you\nmake that one change and now millions of\nkids are getting lunch at school every\nday or i worked with military service\nmembers\num in order to\nhelp them get enrolled in retirement\nsavings plans and again that's like a\none-time decision and then they're done\nthe ones that are much harder are the\nday-to-day behaviors where we have to\nbuild these habits over time and sustain\nthose habits over time and we just\nhaven't cracked the nut fully\non how to encourage long-term behavior\nchange on the things we value most and\nthat's because\nwe're human jay right we're set we're\nfallible\nwe fall prey to temptation left and\nright and it's just very very hard to be\na highly discipli disciplined person\nright that's probably one of the reasons\nwhy you recommend everyone that they\nmeditate because i can help with\nsustained behavior change um but it\nwould be wonderful to see\nadditional innovations yeah um within\nthat space yeah i love hearing you say\nthat because\ni found that at least through my own\nmechanisms and work i've kind of found\nlike a\ntrifecta that gets closest and the\nchallenge is that a lot of behavioral\nchanges you said is\nnot around anything that is consistent\nand so for the three levels that i found\nthat at least in my work that really do\nhelp people are coaching consistency in\ncommunity that have a massive impact on\npeople and we built a program three\nyears ago now that was centered around\nthese three areas and through our\nresearch and studies we've been able to\nsee how people have become happier more\nsuccessful more financially free through\nthe program yeah and of course we're\ndealing with we're dealing with\nthousands of people not millions of\npeople in that program\nbut it's it's phenomenal to see how\nthose three things together coaching\nconsistency and community are so\npowerful that coaching gives you that\ninsight and advice consistency is the\none i think is ignored in in everything\nit's like like you said you do that one\nnudge and that doesn't create a\ncascading life-changing effect and so\nthat consistency of weekly check-ins and\nthen finally the community aspect of\nhaving a group of people that you're\ndoing it with has been so powerful but\nyeah tell me what you're doing on a\nday-to-day basis and what you're\ndiscovering and learning i think the\nconsistency\npiece that you just mentioned is really\ninteresting and there's one potentially\npowerful antidote for this that comes\nout of behavioral economics research and\nthat's called the fresh start effect\nand it's the idea that when we have\nthese really big\nlife changes these big milestones like\nwe move to another town or we buy a home\nfor the first time or we get married or\nwe have kids or we take a new job\nthose moments in time can serve as\nbreaks from our past and all the habits\nthat we used to have in many ways\nwe can take on a new identity in this\nnew role and what research shows is that\npeople are far more effective at\nintroducing\na new kind of consistency or sustained\nbehavior change when their surroundings\nare physically different they don't have\nsome of the same cues and reminders\nevery day that might inspire them to you\nknow eat the chocolate cake versus the\nfruit salad and um their commute to work\nis different so now maybe they're gonna\nwalk versus take their car\num and so\ni do believe in the power of fresh\nstarts and\nyou don't just have to wait for a major\nmilestone sundays can serve as fresh\nstarts like certainly january first can\nserve as a fresh start um every monday\nis a fresh start for me i'm one of those\npeople there yeah me too they're just\nlooking i'm just waiting for a new day\nexactly but we found for example that\nmilitary service members again this is\nwork i was doing in the obama white\nhouse were more likely to sign up for\nretirement savings plan on the first day\nof spring when they were reminded that\nit was a new beginning and a new start\nto their to their future lives and so\ni really do believe that if\nif your listeners are struggling with\nthat kind of consistency and are looking\nto build a new set of habits that better\nalign with their long-term goals look\nout for that mo those moments in your\nlife where you're breaking from the past\nand you can re-establish yourself and\nthe kinds of behaviors that you aspire\nto associate yourself with can be more\npresent yeah i can agree more i think\ni've always used a new job or moving to\na new town or joining a new group as\nbeing an opportunity to redefine my\nidentity in that space of who i want to\nbe\nbut uh yeah no the idea of just using i\nremember when i moved from so i got\nintroduced to\nspirituality like just on the cusp of\nleaving high school and going to college\nand so college is where i got to\nredefine who i was whereas at high\nschool i was a rebel and a troublemaker\nand all the rest of it and then all of a\nsudden i went to college and i was like\nthe kid who meditated and and everything\nelse and it was so great for me because\ni was no longer\nheld down by that baggage of the\nidentity i had crafted for myself where\npeople expected me to be a certain way\nand then of course\nafter leaving being a monk and coming\nback into the world it was easier to\nalways come back and be like oh i don't\ngo to that or i don't drink or i don't\ndo this because i'd had this life\nexperience whereas if i would have\njoined the corporate world before maybe\ni would have had a very\ndifferent experience so i i completely\ncan relate to so much of that advice\nyeah i love seeing this insight play out\nin your life i'm wondering you know when\nyou went to college was it a really\nintentional action to change like yeah\nwere you seizing that moment it was it\nwas because i think i'd i'd created such\na role that i played at high school\nwhere i was like i said the rebel the\ntroublemaker the person who\nwas a funny drunk like i just had a role\nthat i'd created it was a role it wasn't\nme it was just just a identity that i\nenjoyed being yeah because people\nenjoyed that version of me\nand none of my and i took a gap year\nbefore i went to\ncollege which was great because all my\nfriends went off to their respective\ncolleges and\nlived their first year lives and all the\nrest of it and i went to a college where\nnone of my school friends went and so i\nhad a complete blank slate where no one\nknew who i was and there was no history\nand i could completely reframe\nwho i wanted to become and so i ran a\nphilosophical society every week at\ncollege and i i meditated and everyone\nwould come to me to learn these skills\nand techniques i was learning from monks\nand it was almost like i i could be the\nperson i wanted to be and i think that\nhelped so much you know this reminds me\nof another insight from behavioral\neconomics it's called identity priming\nand it refers to the fact that\nour behaviors often align with the\nidentities the social identities that we\neither\nassociate ourselves with now or aspire\nto associate ourselves with and\ni think your experience underscores the\nimportance of especially when you're\nyoung\nnot allowing people to give you labels\nbecause the moment you're given a label\nthe rebel\nthe funny drunk whatever it is\nyou feel some degree of pressure to\nassimilate to that or to ensure that\nyour behaviors are aligning with that\nidentity day-to-day in part it's just to\nreduce cognitive dissonance within\nyourself right you want to believe that\nyour identity means something and that\nyou're living it out every day and um\nyou know this was true in in when i was\ntalking with daryl davis who says you\nknow it's sometimes it's important to\nlabel behaviors as racist versus people\nas racist if you feel like they're\nredeemable that they can change um\nbecause if you give people a label they\nwill carry that with them and it might\nnot facilitate the same kind of change\nand i remember when i was working with\nthe re-entry population while at the\nwhite house\nwe were designing guides for people who\nwere leaving prison\nand you know the transition back to\ncivilian life can be a very challenging\none but it's also a fresh start in which\nwe want people to tap into their best\nselves and reach their goals and we were\nvery careful in this guidebook this\ntransition book to not refer to people\nas\nformer convicts or ex-convicts or\nex-prisoners instead we called we made\nsure that the the na the labels we were\nusing were community members job seekers\nthose kinds of labels are\nforward-looking can allow people to use\nthose identities so yeah it's just your\npersonal experience transitioning from\nhigh school to college allows me to see\nhow important it is that we just\nwe don't let others label us and we also\ndon't label ourselves yeah yeah and i\nlove that i love that how simple even\nwhen you were describing that just\nhearing those words changes how you view\nthat person even for the new people that\nare going to get to meet them and i\nthink so many of us are carrying around\nold labels and old baggage and old\nidentities that we don't want to be\nanymore i think i meet so many people\nare like yeah i don't want to be this\nperson anymore but all my friends think\ni'm this person and so i love the idea\nof you know at least starting to test\nwho we want to be in new new phases of\nour life and new places of our life uh\nyou've mentioned the podcast throughout\nthe conversation with these amazing\nconversations that you're having tell me\nabout why you decided to start a podcast\nand why you called it a slight change of\nplan because i love that i love the\ntitle but i want to know the reason for\nwhy you did that yeah\num i think it was in part inspired by my\npersonal experience with change you know\nlosing the violin at a young age and\nasking myself all these existential\nquestions about identity it's in part\ninspired by my\nrole as a cognitive scientist right\nsomeone who\nstudies the mind and i was eager to\nmarry you know these two the the\nnarrative storytelling part of my life\nwith the cognitive science part of my\nlife\nbut the catalyst for this happened in\n2020 and\ni was feeling really overwhelmed by the\npace of change that was happening around\nme and i know everybody was it was this\ncollective moment in the world where we\nall\nso acutely felt a loss of control\nwe realized how much of an illusion\ncontrol is and\nit was easy to feel intimidated\nthat would be the best word i could use\nto describe my state of mind as someone\nwho loves planning and and likes knowing\nhow things are going to end out and then\nalso seeing all the tragedy around me\nand the racial upheaval like it was just\nit was just a hard a very very hard time\nand then\ni tried to put on my cognitive science\nhat and what i realized is\nwhile the specifics of what 2020 threw\nour way wasn't was absolutely\nunprecedented our human ability to\nnavigate change is not\nin many ways our minds are built for\nchange\nand\nthat's really important for us to\nrecognize because\nas\nyou know as a human civilization we've\ndone this rodeo many times before this\nchange thing\nbut there's no textbook out there with\nanswers it's not like in the throes of a\nhuge life change you can go to your\ntextbook and open it up to page 90 and\nbe like oh yes here's the path that i\nshould take\nand so i thought to myself\nwhy don't i\ntry to find people who have been through\nextraordinary change in their lives\nright people like tiffany haddish and\nhillary clinton and casey musgraves and\ntommy caldwell and then just a bunch of\npeople i've either heard about or met in\nin my personal life\nand\nhear their reflections and try to mine\ntheir stories for insights and lessons\nthat we as listeners can take back into\nour own lives that might help us think\ndifferently about change in our own\nlives\nand\nit has been\nan absolute joy to make this podcast i\nmean i've never felt more closely\naligned with something given who i am\nremember i told you about the basement\nof that fmri lab the podcast\nthat is actually the thing that i i just\ni mean i've fallen in love with it and i\nthink the reason is that\nyou can meet people with two very\nsimilar sounding stories\nbut how they define their change moment\nwill be radically different the lessons\nthat they learn will be radically\ndifferent and so i feel like\ni mean this talk about eating a slice of\nhumble pie\ni have been so humbled doing this\npodcast because\nmy guests have taught me so much about\nchange that i never would have\nappreciated absent listening to their\nstories and it's been wonderful to go on\nthis expedition with them about how it\nis people have navigated some of the\ntoughest changes that you can imagine in\nlife yeah no absolutely living living or\nnot living who'd be someone that you are\nfascinated about the amount of changes\nin their life or or those transitions in\ntheir life i mean there's always oprah\nbut that's the obvious one\nyou know what's interesting jay is that\nwhen you meet someone you don't always\nappreciate the full depth of their life\nstories i'll give you one example one of\nthe people that i interviewed for this\npodcast his name is scott\nhe's just a friend and colleague of my\nhusband's i'd had dinner with him once\nback in 2019. and he is a\nself-proclaimed health nut so he sounds\nlike you and roddy now right so he's\nvegan he does intermittent fasting he\ndoes high intensity interval training he\nadds turmeric and chia seeds to like his\nfood whenever possible now look we're\nboth indian so we know that turmeric is\na delicate spice you cannot pour it on\nanything\nthis guy is out of turmeric food so if\nit's in a book somewhere\nsaying that something's\nhealthy he's done it and then in 2020\nscott\ngot a stage four bone cancer diagnosis\nand within weeks he had to get his right\nleg amputated he had to pack up his bags\nmove to\nmd anderson in texas\ndo\n18 administrations of chemotherapy he\nalso had to get a vertebra removed from\nhis spine and i think his tibia was\nremoved from his other leg\nscott's worst nightmare came true he he\nhad literally spent his entire adult\nlife trying to avoid this outcome\nnow i talked to him and i'm interviewing\nhim for for this\npodcast and he's telling me he's in the\nthroes of it all when i'm interviewing\nhim um he actually just finished up his\ntreatment yesterday\nhe says to me you know maya my worst\nnightmare came true but\ni'm sitting here in my backyard sipping\na cup of coffee\nand i'm realizing\nthe emotional thermostat has prevailed\ni am more or less as happy as i was\nbefore the diagnosis\nsure the bad moments are worse i'll give\nyou that\nnausea is intense the pain is terrible\ni have moments of fear\nbut the good moments are just as good\nand he said if i had known that i would\nrespond this way psychologically\ni would never have been as fearful of\ncancer as i had been in the first place\nthat's so stirring to me\nand\nthose are the kinds of insights that i\ncarry with me you know because they give\nme\nhope\nand they make me\nunderstand just how resilient we are as\npeople um not everybody has scott's\nstory you know i'm not sure i would\nrespond in that way but he didn't think\nthat he would respond in that way\nand so i love it when\na guy i just had dinner once\nyou know i can have this kind of\nconversation with and he teaches me he\ngives me so much wisdom and another\nthing he shared with me is he said you\nknow i put so much emphasis my identity\nwas so\nintricately entwined with my fitness up\nuntil this point like i was smart fit\nscott like those are the two labels you\nknow he's like a harvard grad and all\nthat stuff and\nhe said this whole experience is\nallowing me to see that maybe these\ntraits that i\nsaw so core to my identity are more\nnegotiable than i thought he used the\nword negotiable and i love that he goes\nyeah maybe i can't do a handstand but\nlike i'm still scott at the end of the\nday\nand\nthe final lesson that i learned while i\nlearned so many lessons one of the final\nlessons i learned from scott's interview\nwas he said\nyou know my would be a shame if my body\ndeteriorated and my personality also got\nworse so i'm going to use this to become\na better person and to me that was a\ntestament to the fact that this is a\ntrait i see across all my guests\nis we are natural\nstorytellers in our hearts you know no\nmatter what your spiritual or\nnon-spiritual beliefs it is just human\nnature to try to find\nmeaning and silver linings in adversity\nand change to almost justify the\nrandomness of it all\nand um\nhearing scott be so intentional about\nthat growth and and saying\nlook i need to just make the best of it\num i love that and i think that's such a\npowerful story so maybe maybe the to\nyour earlier question i think my dream\nguest is someone\nwho just teaches me something new helps\nme see the world through a different\nvantage point you know they don't have\nto be someone i've already heard of i\njust love seeing the world through\ndifferent lenses yeah absolutely i think\nthat's a beautiful answer and uh i'm so\nglad you shared that journey i just um\non saturday\ni got the news that my my best friend\nwho was my almost like my brother who\nwas a monk he just passed away after\nsuffering with colon cancer for four\nyears but it spread far beyond his color\nand it was everywhere so sorry and so he\nlike i don't know how many cycles of\nchemo he had like 30 or something like\nthat and it was just every time he would\nthey'd feel it's gone away had gone\nsomewhere else\nand\ni\ngot to speak to him on the phone about\nthree days before he passed away and i\ndidn't know obviously you never know\nyeah and i got a message from one of the\nsenior monks who was with him and said\noh we're just talking about you and\nwe're thinking about you and so i called\nhim straight away and it was like\nhe'd gone to london for his treatment it\nwas like 11 40 p.m in london and 3 40\np.m here so i called him up and i got to\nbe on facetime with him and he was like\ncompletely emaciated like hunched over\nbut he was smiling like he just had this\nmassive smile on his face and he was\nlike that throughout his whole cancer\njourney\nand\ni could tell that this was the worst i'd\never seen him because up until every\ntime i'd seen him because he was taking\ntreatment he looked normal\nas in not normal that's the wrong word\nbut he looked his usual self this was\nthe first time i'd seen him uh\ncompletely you know emaciated in bed\nand he was just smiling away and we were\njoking around and we were both telling\neach other stories and memories and he'd\nlost his voice so he could only like\nreally whisper\nand the senior monk knows us both so he\nwas kind of helping speak for him and\ntranslate for him and add for him and it\nwas just remarkable to me to see someone\nuh at the end of their life be so\nblissful\nand all i could see was bliss that when\ni spoke at his memorial yesterday\nit was the most blissful memorial i've\never i was on zoom of course everyone\nwas there in person in england but it\nwas the most blissful memorial i've ever\nbeen to because that was him yeah and\nand that's from what you're saying about\nscott it sounds like a very similar\nenergy of how to deal with this and you\nknow while he was at cancer he was uh\nhe was leading charity initiatives to\nraise funds for cancer raise awareness\nfor cancer he was organizing meditation\nretreats for cancer patients that were\nstruggling with him so that they could\nall grow together because that's what he\nwas doing so he was extending his\npractices out to them yeah and he just\nlived with so much purpose in the last\nfour years and so much service in the\nlast four years and yeah that kind of\nmind is just\nunbelievable and phenomenal like you\nsaid he's not famous he doesn't have\nfollowers no one knows who he is\nhe's not having impacts on millions of\npeople's lives but everyone who knew him\nwould say that he changed their life\nyeah what an honor to do with him yeah\nbest friend yeah i was very lucky to you\nknow he was kind enough to uh be be my\nbest bud for a few years but anyway when\nyou talk about scott i love that answer\nbecause\ni think it's so true that there are just\nso many people in the world who are\ngoing through\nenormously difficult things and and\nhearing their stories gives us so much\nfaith yeah and in part i almost see my\nresponsibility as uncovering the hidden\nstories um\nthere's one there's one interview i did\njust just recently um\nit was with a guy named morgan he\nhe was assigned female at birth and\nhe went through hormone therapy to align\nhis body with his true gender identity\nwhich is male\nand\nfor a while\nmorgan\nis feeling intoxicated by the joy and\nliberation that comes from being freed\nfrom his female body he's a black man\nand he said his joy was punctured\nwhen he was confronted with the harsh\nreality of what it means to be a black\nman in society and his first\nconfrontation with this was literally\nbeing pulled over by the police in his\ngrandmother's driveway\nand\nit's an incredibly\num\ninsightful thought-provoking\nset of reflections from morgan because\nnot only does he share\nwhat it means to have gone through this\ntransition and and um\nyou know embrace his\nhimself um but he ends up joining the\nforce he ends up becoming a police\nofficer wow um\nand\nwith the goal to reform it uh and\nagain those are the kinds of those are\nthe kinds of stories that i live for you\nknow and\ni want to hear them because i feel like\nyou know we talked earlier about how\nbeing a cognitive scientist to me is\nlike the greatest empathy builder yeah\nwell if you marry the science with\nstorytelling it's an unbeatable combo in\nterms of empathy building and\njust understanding the full range of\nhuman experience and\num\nyeah i guess\nyou could probably see it in my face\npeople can't see it but i just love\nobsessed with having these interviews\nbecause i i do feel like every single\none i learn\nit's not even that i learn something new\ni learn a new way of interpreting the\nworld around me it's a perspective shift\nand that's i'm sure you find that when\nyou when you interview different people\nis it changes the perspective with which\nyou look at the world and that's an\nincredible gift to be given yeah and\nit's totally unpredictable like when we\nstarted this conversation\nit's d i felt different to when i first\nread about you\nand it's different to when now we're\ncoming to the end of our conversation\nit's like\nwe can have so many perceptions about\nsomeone and what we expect to learn from\nthem yeah and i can honestly say that\nsitting with you for the past hour this\nhas been a totally unexpected\nconversation in a good way\nand i'm like i think that's the power of\ngetting to listen to stories and\nlistening to people and getting to meet\npeople that you'd never meet before or\notherwise because i think we're so good\nat and\nand i guess that's where behavioral\nscience is so interesting because\nwe do have to box people to make sense\nof stuff but then we need to unbox them\nto actually make sense of them like\nit's a weird paradox right like we\nalways put people in a category so that\nwe can make decisions\nbut then we need to get them out of\nthose to really deeply understand them\nand so you know i wasn't expecting that\nour conversation would go down the\njourney that it has but that's what's so\nbeautiful about it yeah and so yeah i\nwanna i wanna thank you for\nyou know doing your podcast uh for those\nof you who haven't listened to it go and\ncheck out a slight change of plans\nuh it's\nit's beautiful to hear these stories\nthat you've even been sharing with us on\nthe podcast and i can't wait for my\naudience to actually go and listen to\nsome of these conversations i know i'm\ngoing to do that because it sounds like\nyou're just speaking to some people who\nand and in a way that\nyou know is going to be really\ninsightful for people's change and\ngrowth but also for their heart and i\nthink that's what i love i i you're what\ni love about you from the little time\nthat we've spent together is that it\nfeels like you bring a lot of heart to\nscience\nand uh that's rare like it's it's very\nrare i feel like you you're bringing\nyour heart into\nhow to help people change how they think\nand so you know storytelling's one thing\nbut heartful storytelling is is even a\ndeeper step sir thank you so that's so\nkind and generous of you to say and\nsuch a compliment too\nbecause my hope is that i really can\nmarry you know um science\nand and humanity i guess right i mean\nthey're obviously really interconnected\nbut\num that has been my goal with a slight\nchange of plans and it's kind of been my\ngoal living you know it's like how do i\nbring my heart to as many things as i\npossibly can so um it was such a\npleasure to get to talk with you jay i'm\nsuch a huge fan of your show and um i'm\njust i'm just so grateful for the\nopportunity so thank you well thank you\nmaya well we're not done yet we end\nevery interview the final five oh ah so\nthis is the fast five round where every\nquestion has to be answered in one word\nor one sentence maximum\na sentence i believe or at least i've\nmade this up is seven words maximum so i\ndon't know if that's real or not but\nseven to ten words maximum so this is\nyour fast five maya\nyour first question is what is the best\nadvice you've ever received\nfind amazing mentors\ngreat i love that that's a good one and\nyou shared so many wonderful examples of\nmentors that you've had in your life\nabsolutely and the amazing impact\nthey've had on you i'm gonna i'm gonna\ndestroy my rules here but it's important\nto do that\nhow do people find good mentors teach us\nthat because\nyou know i have my own my own thoughts\non this and i share that a lot with my\naudience but i'd love to hear your\nperspective on how people can find good\nmentors yeah it's a good question um\ni've never done it intentionally i've\nalways slipped into the mentee role\nalmost without realizing it but my\nmentors have played a profound role in\nmy life and the way that it happened in\ncase this is helpful to folks is\ni'm always searching for people that\ni admire\nand whose life i would love to lead yeah\nyou know and and who's\nwho bring that kind of heart to things\nbecause that's something that speaks to\nme personally for me maya right\nand then when i find those people like\nlaurie santos um\ni just\ni cling to them you know i\ni i say oh laurie like you know addition\nto you mentoring me um can i work in\nyour lab can we get coffee can you\nactually be my lifelong friend you know\nand and i think um\nas i've gotten older one way to do that\nmore effectively is\ni've just always i mean everyone has\ndifferent philosophies on this but i've\nalways learned i've always blurred the\nline between\ncolleague and friend yeah\nand it's irresistible for me\ni i can't not bring that really personal\nside of myself to my work no matter what\nit is that i'm working on it's funny\nthere was a quick anecdote just sorry\nfrom from my time in obama's white house\nso the government had just shut down and\nthere were all these ethical rules about\nthe fact that\nwe couldn't hang out in our quote\nprofessional capacity we could only hang\nout in our personal capacity because\notherwise we'd be violating federal\nrules um but we were just planning we\nwere you know we were all very friendly\nand we just wanted to hang out as\nfriends so um i was joking with folks i\nwas like ah i can't wait for all of you\nguys to see me in my personal capacity\nand you know one of my friend's best is\nlike oh maya you're exactly the same and\nthen another one of my friends goes\nwe're still waiting to see maya in her\nprofessional capacity so i think that\nsays everything which is i i've learned\nthat line and i think what ends up\nhappening is i just like naturally end\nup becoming friends with the people i\nadmire and then i find that they can be\nthat they have been just wonderful\nmentors um but it's always been i know\nthis might be unsatisfying for listeners\nto be like oh why did it have to be an\norganic process for you my i want the\nlike one two three checklist but i think\nthat's kind of the only way to feel\ngenuine you know you really want\nto be friends with them because they're\ngenuinely curious about the way they\nthink in the way that they live yeah i i\nlove that and i and i love that that's\nyour authentic\ngenuine way that it's happened that's\nbeautiful i think one of the most\namazing things for me is that i\ngenuinely believe you can be mentored by\npeople you've never met\nand so i've spent my life studying the\nlives the words the teachings of so many\npeople that i admire that are no longer\nalive and simply sitting with their\nbiographies and their autobiographies\nand listening to every interview and\nwatching\nevery tv show they went on or whatever\nthey did just looking at the records of\ntheir life\nthere's often times where i'll sit there\nand be like well what would that person\ndo there is an answer it's somewhere\nthere\nand and i've loved that because i would\nhave loved to been mentored by martin\nluther king or steve jobs or some of\nthese people that i never got to meet\nand i can be mentored by the people that\nmet them or i can be mentored by them\nthrough their own\nlives if i studied them deeply enough\nand of course i agree with you that i'd\nsay any mentors that i've had in\nreality have not been calculated\ndecisions it's i agree with you it's\nalways been very natural so yeah i love\nthat i was you actually reminded me of\nsomething i'm totally going off yeah but\nanyway your fast fire has changed uh you\nreminded me of something you asked me\nthat question about what trait has\nchanged and you said something there\nthat actually triggered something you\nsaid uh asking people to be my lifelong\nfriend so\ni've i've always been very much wore my\nheart on my sleeve kind of person i've\nalways been that way because my mum\nraised me that way and i always was\nhonest with people and often you were\nyou know often when you're like that as\na teenager it's not a strength it's seen\nas a weakness like you're weird or\nyou're strange or you're you're needy or\nyou're desperate or whatever it may be\nand i never let go of it because i\nrealized i would rather say what i\nreally want to say to someone and then\nlet it be whatever the result is yeah\nversus\nnot tell them the truth and then realize\nwe could have been best friends\nand so\ntill this day\nuh i've i've got some of my closest\nfriends in my life who when i got to\nknow them the first thing i said to them\nwas like i really want to be friends\nwith you as a tweet as a 30 year old man\noh my gosh i love that\ni do the same thing i think it takes\npeople back but yeah i'm like look i may\nas well just be straightforward you can\nsay no charlie totally i do this all the\ntime i'm so okay with someone saying no\nand actually i feel like i'm getting a\nmuch more honest take on like whether\nthis is going anywhere and now i'm not\nliving in the wood i coulda shoulda\nwhatever i'm living in okay well it\ndidn't work and that's cool yeah and and\ni'm so much more happier with that sense\nof closure and now we're talking about\nrelationships but it's like i'm so much\nhappier with having honest\ntransparent conversations rather than\nthis\nidea in my head that so anyway you that\nwas the trait i think that i've learned\nto really\nsee as a strength and and not see as a\nweakness and you know so yeah i think i\nhave something very similar which is i\nused to see\nmy openness maybe as weakness or\nsomething like that because i am so open\nwith the people in my life that i love\num\neven about just my affections for them\nright like i'll probably be writing you\nlike\na long email after this being like jay\nyou're so amazing um and it's all\nheartfelt and i sometimes felt like wow\nyou're so open\nand um it was it was so interesting i\nwas at a wedding this weekend and um\ni was talking with one of my cousins she\nwas like wow maya you really asked these\nlike deep questions of people and my\nsister-in-law weighed in and she said\nbut maya always gives you her full self\nin return yeah\nshe gives you that depth back and i\nthought that was such a lovely thing to\nsay because\ni do feel like in reinterpreting that\nopenness as a weakness i've seen it as\nwell actually it's amazing to be able to\nshare so much of yourself with someone\nelse and hope that they can return that\nin whatever capacity they're comfortable\nsharing themselves totally totally i\nlove that that i'm gonna make that now\nthe second question i ask you what's the\nuh\nwhat do you think is a wonderful\nquestion to ask someone\nto evoke\na connection and create a relationship\nwith someone if you if you had your\nfavorite question to ask in an interview\nor your favorite question to learn about\nsomeone we're on the second question so\nyeah you can you can you can seven words\nokay yeah what have you changed your\nmind about oh i love you and then if i\nhad nine words i think that was seven\ni'm not sure and why okay beautiful all\nright third question what have you\nchanged your mind about and why\nsounds a little bit meta but it's\ntotally true i've changed my mind about\nwhy it is people believe the things they\ndo\nand that's been in studying the science\nof why it is that people\nbelieve the things they do\nand i've always felt this hits on some\nof the themes we talked about earlier\nthat if we can\nfully understand why\nthen we can generate\nthe how how do we change\ntheir minds given that if we think it's\nimportant for them to change their minds\num and what is the why usually whereas\nwhere does that come where do you think\nyou see the patterns of why people think\nthe way they do if there are any at all\nyeah i think um it relates a lot to the\nthe daryl davis story um and it relates\na lot to what i was sharing about\ntribal membership which is yeah at the\nend of the day i think\none of our most primal human instincts\nis we want to feel like we belong to\nsomething we that's bigger than\nourselves to a community a group\nsomething that validates us and\nwhere we feel an implicit sense that\nvalues are shared that there's\ncommonality yeah and understanding that\ni mean it sounds so simple\noh of course some of my beliefs would be\ninformed by my group membership but if\nyou really think about it that does run\ncounter to\na lot of people's intuition about how it\nis that we generate our beliefs and so\ni feel like\nonce you understand that that it's this\nhuman desire to belong\num\nyou can then\ntailor make better solutions that don't\nfeel\naggressive or confrontational or\nthreatening in any way i love that\nbeautiful all right question number four\nuh what's the first thing you do in the\nmorning and the last thing you do before\nyou go to bed brush my teeth so boring\ntotally fine um it's needed it is needed\nyou're only a huge fan of you know\nhygiene yeah um you have great teeth\nyeah\nuh\nyou know it's usually it's usually\neating a snack before before i go to bed\nwhich is i mean you'll probably tell me\nit's a terrible thing\nyeah\num\nwhat would be the snack i'm intrigued\nnow i try to make it healthy it's just\ngosh i was telling um\ntelling my friend madeline on the way\nover like i get\ni would i wouldn't call it hanger i'd\nsay i get heritable\nif i can make that up okay you just made\nit up i get heritable and\nno one likes me when i'm heritable i\ndon't like me when i'm heritable so\ni just feel like i just need something\nto take a little bit of the hunger edge\noff yeah yeah so i'll have some sort of\nevening sex and thanks i like i i'm i'm\nvery heritable as well and so is my wife\nwhen we know when we're here it about\nfor sure\ni just need to eat a bigger dinner\nthat's the key i know i'm not supposed\nto be right before bedtime but i\ndefinitely can't fall asleep when i'm\nhungry that's very hard for me that\nmakes sense yeah that definitely makes\nsense all right fifth and final question\nand seeing as you've worked in public\npolicy i think this will be fun if you\ncould create one law that everyone in\nthe world had to follow what would it be\nsmile at everyone you see on the street\nthat's beautiful there is a lot of\nresearch showing\nhow\nthese small moments that strangers share\ncan have profound impacts on well-being\nand happiness and a feeling of\nconnectedness\nand\nwhether or not i'm having a good day\ni i make a i make a self-commitment\nto smile at everybody that i see when\ni'm just taking a walk acknowledge them\nin some way or another and it's been\nhard with covet and mass
