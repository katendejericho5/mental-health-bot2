    "transcript": "realize oh crap i can't fit\non the outside but i'm dying on the\ninside high inflammation low\ntestosterone dysregulated thyroid gut\ninflammation and gut issues and\nconstipation all these issues that\ntechnically somebody with like low body\nfat and muscles who can like run and\nlift weights you wouldn't expect to have\nbut really true fitness is not about\ngoing to a little fake box at the\nbeginning of the day and pushing you\nknow fake heavy things around for an\nhour and then walking out and assuming\nthat you're good to go\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you who come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow i am so deeply\ngrateful for our trusted committed\ncommunity that shows up every week and\ntoday's guest is someone that i met a\nfew years ago now we've been going back\nand forth trying to make this happen\nwith both of our schedules with the\npandemic with covid with everything else\nthat's been going on and i have to say\nthat i'm pumped and i'm so excited that\nwe're finally in the same room together\ni'm talking about none other than human\nperformance consultant new york times\nbest-selling author\nuh self-experimenter\nand one of the most wild crazy\ninteresting curious people that i know\nben greenfield ben thank you for being\nhere thank you for showing up and even\njust the few moments we've spent\ntogether i'm already looking forward to\nit it's kind of bittersweet though cause\nlike last time we hung out we were\neating wonderful italian\nbuffet style five-star resort sardinian\nfood surrounded by amazing people and\nmusic that that whole was it mind valley\nwas it mind valley university it was\nyeah it was it was awesomeness fest\ni don't think they even call it\nawesomeness anymore because that words\ndated\nbut yeah they uh they had like it was\nalmost like a disneyland in sardinia\nsome giant\nresort all i remember was the food was\namazing\ngreat parties and then i met you we were\nsitting at a table at dinner and you and\ni had never met before\nand uh vishen lakhani was there and he\nintroduced us and\nthen we thought about doing a podcast\nand that was like two years ago\nliterally three yeah finally the other\nside of the world we finally hook up but\nyeah sardinia you know what was\ninteresting about that like sardinia is\nwell known as being a longevity hot spot\nor like nikoi and loma linda and okinawa\nyou know one of these so-called\nblue zones even though there's some\ncontroversy about the whole blue zones\nand whether or not the demographic data\nwas accurate or whatever but either way\nlike people live a long time\nbut\nwhen you look at the populations that\nthey studied in sardinia it was a lot of\nthe old people up in the dolomites right\nwho were you know hiking up hills with\ntheir goats milk and their wine and\neating you know small cold water fish\nand herbs and spices and teas and\nliving this like outdoor lifestyle\ncombined with social relationships and\nlove and all these things that we know\nnow feed\na good not just health span but life\nspan\nand then we got to sardinia so that was\nlike the picture i had painted in my\nmind but then when we got to sardinia we\nweren't like up in the craggy hills with\nlike old italian people drinking table\nwine over small you know fish and\ntea up in the mountains somewhere this\nwas like a full-on like\nfive-star resort with like golf carts\nand and like man-made beaches inside\ngiant walls and so it was interesting\nfor me i kept wanting to slip away like\nup into the dolomites and be like okay\nwell this is interesting but what's kind\nof like the non-touristy sidelight yeah\nregardless though the the food i think\nwas amazing and probably uh probably\nsomething the the longevity enthusiasts\nup in the mountains would have killed to\nyeah absolutely we were i think we were\ni hope we were eating seasonally i think\nwe kind of sort of i think it was\nseasonally slash what the locals there\nthought would kind of impress impress\npeople which was yeah yes yeah but but i\nmean like you know i've eaten in italy\nbefore\ni guess more like the locals yeah so my\nwife and i early on in our marriage we\nflew into rome\nand\ndidn't have a lot of money it was either\nsenior year of college or right after we\nboth graduated and so this was back in\nthe day when i had to like fax all my\nreservations in and my credit card\nnumber to the to the different places\nthat we wanted to stay and stuff but our\nour harebrained idea was we wanted to\nrent bikes in rome and just like zigzag\nride them all the way up to florence\nand that's what we did we rented bikes\nbut i planned ahead and mapped out the\nwhole route and so i would fax my\nreservations into these agricolas you\nknow which are like farm stays where you\nstay with these italian families on\ntheir farm or like little hostels um or\nbeds and breakfasts that's basically we\nhad the money to afford and so we we got\ninto rome we start riding and basically\nbecause i had already prepaid for all\nthese reservations by faxing them in it\nwas come hell or high water we had to\nget to where we were going that day and\nmost days were like\n35 to 50 miles of riding which isn't a\nwhole lot but these are like heavy\ntouring bikes with with panniers on\neither side these bags where you keep\nall of your belongings your clothing\nyour toiletries whatever and\ninevitably as the trip goes on and we\nlike buy wine and buy cheese and buy\nsouvenirs these bikes would get heavier\nand heavier as we'd go\nevery city there is built on top of a\nhill you know like an old medieval\nvillage with walls and you got to climb\na hill so every day at the end of the\nday the very last thing we'd do when our\nlegs were already toast was just climb\nclimb climb to the top of these hills\nand then hunt down you know wherever\nwe'd actually put in a reservation to\nstay at but i remember the most special\nthing was it was every single day you'd\nfinish you were sweaty you were tired\nyour legs were aching and you knew that\nthere was a homemade italian meal with\nsome table wine that rivals you know a\n50 glass of wine you'll buy here in the\nus and and wonderful people and smiles\nand um and and and a bed to stay in and\ni i just remember every single day\nriding up those hills thinking gelato\nhomemade ravioli red wine you got this\nben you can do this it was it was a cool\ntrip we got all of the florence we we\nput our bikes on a train and then just\ntook the train back down to rome and\nflew home so now i have you know years\nand years later i have twin 13 year old\nsons and when they're 15 so a year and a\nhalf or two from now we're gonna\nreplicate that trip we're gonna take\nthem back so now i've got them kind of\nstarting to train and learn how to be\ncomfortable on the roads you know like\nthe italian roads have no shoulders you\ngotta know to handle your bike on roads\nand know how to ride a big fat touring\nbike instead of a road bike and so\nthat's going to be really i'm super\nlooking forward to that it's like the\nnext trip to italy with my boys riding\nthrough the through the italian fields\nand and uh hunting down florence again\nthat's a beautiful plan i love hearing\nthem and they're lucky boys and i i\nremember that as a young man my parents\nwould drive us\nto italy that was their favorite place\nin europe so we would drive from london\nwe'd get the ferry into france\nand then from france we would drive\nagain to italy so we drive to venice we\ndrive to naples we drive to rome\nwe just drive to a different place and\nwe drive across italy\nbecause we didn't have the money to fly\nthere and my parents preferred doing a\nroad trip\nand\nwe didn't get on any bikes or anything\nlike that but even what you were saying\ni was gonna say we weak family if you\nguys were were were real you would take\nin bicycles yeah yeah yeah you would if\nyou were\ntaking a bike from london bike bike from\nlondon to italy yeah no we were like\neight years old and without birth but\nbut i have good memories of visiting\nitaly with my parents as well so i can\nonly imagine how your boys are going to\nfeel when they're going i think they'll\ndo my only concern is the girls because\ni got like two 13 year old let me be 15\nby then like blonde blonde-haired\nblue-eyed american boys and just having\ntaken my wife there and seeing the\nreaction to you know my wife's\nblond-haired blue-eyed you know the men\nthat are very very forward and a little\ncat calling as she walks down the street\nthen when i took my sons to thailand a\ncouple of years ago same thing like all\nthe thai people just flock around them\nand then the women are practically\nswooning as these little blond-haired\nboys walk through the streets so we may\nhave to bring bring some fly swatters to\nkeep the women\nmemory of you actually was in sardinia i\nknew you were going to be there we were\nboth speaking at the conference and\nyou know i was learning about you and\nlearning about your world i was i'm you\nknow i'm not a biohacker that's not my\nbackground in in the same sense as you\nare and so i was intrigued and i i loved\nyour sessions that you did but my first\nexperience of you was we had an evening\nparty\nand it was like this we were on this\nbridge if you remember at the hotel\nand you literally jumped in\nto like the hotel\nlake slash pool it was and the reason\nwhy i say lake is because it wasn't like\na swimming pool we have i've got to give\nben credit it was and it was evening so\nit was cooler and you dived in and you\nswam\nand you got out and you you made your\nand we were just we were all like wow\nthat is that is the way to enter it so\ni've always remembered this yeah you\nremember it yeah yeah yeah and that that\nwas early on in the trip uh honestly\ndude i love water i know you do i'm at\nhome and water i you know i i competed\nfor years in open water swimming and\niron man triathlon and the biking and\nthe running was okay\nbut i did and i still do just\nlove you could see that i love the water\ni love the ocean i love spear fishing i\ni'm not a big water man\nin terms of like surfing and kite\nboarding and things like that because i\ndon't really have that up in washington\nstate so i can't practice it and i tend\nnot to really be passionate about the\nthings i i suck at so because i can't\npractice them um but but yeah i think\nwater is almost like woven into my dna\nsomehow because my dad you know his all\nof his side comes from australia and i'm\na big believer in the fact that that we\ndo carry a lot of things epigenetically\nin our dna not only trauma but also the\nthings that our ancestors are good at or\nlove to do you know my son\nriver dreams a lot about snow and ice in\nfinland and trekking up snowy mountains\nin the cold and it's interesting because\nmy wife jessa's whole side is like\nnorthern european wow you know up in the\narea around finland and estonia and and\nand switzerland and you know and and\nsome of these more like snowy white\nplaces and it's funny that that's like a\nrepeating dream that he has and i\nsuspect that it's just it's woven into\nhis dna in the same way that a love\nfor water is is woven into my dna and\ni'm actually super excited because right\nbefore i left to come down here to la i\nreceived a package in the mail this\ncompany called uh uh\nfinis sent me\nthese headphones that you can attach to\nyour goggles and they're bone conducting\nheadphones meaning that you can listen\nto stuff while you're swimming or while\nyou're under the water or while you're\nspearfishing or whatever so they conduct\nthe sound through the bones on either\nside of your head rather than your ears\nright so you don't have to worry about\nlike the wires and everything and then\nthey sent me these goggles that have\nlike an in-screen display as you're\nswimming that show you how many strokes\nyou've taken and how far you've gone so\nit you know perhaps it'll just suck all\nthe enjoyment of swimming out of me\nbecause sometimes excess technology can\ndo that but you know just water toys\nlike that i absolutely love and we live\nwe don't live near water\nwe live on about 10 acres of isolated\nforest land up in washington state which\nis great you know we have we have goats\nand these cute little nigerian dwarf\ngoats and icelandic chickens and and a\nbunch of garden beds and all sorts of\nlike old growth forest where there's all\nsorts of wild plant edibles like you\nknow mint and plantain and nettle and\nwhite-tailed deer and turkey and coyote\nand it's a great place but there's no\nthere's no water right there so now i'm\nbuilding this this natural pond and then\njust to to scratch my swimming itch i\ngot one of those the swim pools that's\nlike it's like 20 feet long but it has a\nsuper hard jets yes and you attach like\na um\nit's like an elastic band\nand you can swim against what are they\ncalled there's a name\nyou know it's the ones you see michael\nphelps advertising in the back of\nairplane magazine\nthat kind of thing but then i keep mine\nbecause i'm a huge fan of like the power\nof cold thermogenesis and cryotherapy\nfor you know just for fat loss and your\nnervous system health and your cellular\nresilience i think\nmost people live in the comfort of\ntemperature too much and when we look at\nlongevity data when we look at health\ndata when we look at nervous system and\ncellular resilience\nconstant exposure or can or regular\nexposure to stresses of heat and\nstresses of cold is so good for the\nhuman body so i have a i have a sauna\nand then i have this pool but i keep it\ncold\nwhat i mean by that is i don't heat it\nyeah right so in the summer yeah i'll\nswim at like 60 degrees or whatever it\ngets up to in the winter i'll go out\nthere and swim and it'll be like almost\nbreak through the ice temperatures but i\nget in that thing almost every day and\nswim and that's and it just puts a big\nsmile on my face yeah i've been going to\nthis place called pause in west\nhollywood yeah because\nyeah so i've been going there every week\nwith my wife they're float tanks though\nyeah so we go there every saturday and\nwe do the sensory deprivation tanks for\nabout an hour and then we'll both go and\ndo three cycles of the sauna and coal\nplants together for another hour like a\nmillion bucks\njust we do every saturday morning it's\nuh become our morning routine ritual on\nsaturday we wake up once we've done our\nmeditation 10 a.m we head over and then\n10 a.m to noon we're there\nand it's just been i and you know i've\ni've heard that for a long time and as\nmonks we took cold showers we you know\nwe're in india so it was it was hot\nplenty of the time so you always\nexperienced uncomfortable amounts of\nheat but\ndoing that since i've been back where my\nbody has a climate acclimatized to\nwanting a more comfortable temperature\nand the temperature at home is always\nperfect but also i've started sleeping\nat like 66 67 fahrenheit and that even\nthough it was cooler in the beginning\nthat kind of sleep temperature has\nreally helped and you wake up sometimes\nfeeling cold but i can notice that\nthat's doing some good for my body too\nsleeping in the cold the the effects of\nthat on on\nthe positive effects on sleep\narchitecture have always been surprising\nto me\nbecause um\nit's such simple low-hanging fruit when\nyou look at sleep hygiene\nright we have\nlight as being one component of sleep\nhygiene\nso what i mean by that is your sleep\ncycle begins in the morning meaning that\nthe more sunlight the more of these like\nyou know\nif you're looking at this from more of a\nbiohacking standpoint like the infrared\nlight panels that you can use to\nsimulate sunrise in your office that you\ncan shine on your whole body or an\ninfrared sauna or these these blue light\nboxes that they sell for desktops that\nare used for seasonal affective\ndisorders you know or of course sunlight\nbeing you know the top of the totem pole\nfor any of this stuff like blasting\nyourself with light in the morning\ncombined with turning your room into a\njust a light cave at night like i've\nreplaced all the cans in our bedroom\nwith red incandescent bulbs instead of\nled or modern fluorescent lighting so\nthat's the late evening before that's\nkind of so my master bedroom my son's\nbedroom and our mask and our master\nbathroom are all red incandescent bulbs\nno\nno dimmers because dimmers and we're\nkind of getting into the weeds a little\nbit here but dimmer switches on lights\nthey cause a lot more what is called uh\ndirty emf or high amount of non-native\nelectricity\nthat doesn't jive well with with human\ncellular function and so we don't use\ndimmers but we just replaced all the\ncans with red incandescent the reason\nfor incandescent being that even though\nthere are slightly bigger power hogs on\nthe electrical supply you know it's it's\nnot that big of a deal might be an extra\n10 15 bucks on your electrical bill\nevery month so it's it's nothing too big\nto worry about but they also um they\nthey simulate the natural red spectrum\nof sunlight and the same as our\nancestors might have experienced during\ntorchlight or fire light at night\nso all of the all of the bedrooms\nanywhere where there would be a sleeping\nplace or a place where you might get up\nto pee at night it's all red\nincandescent\nand then all the computers like my son's\ncomputer my wife's computer my computer\nwe have a program installed on that\ncalled iris and iris just kind of sucks\nall the all the high temperature light\nout of the computer screen at a specific\ntime of day so it's very eye-friendly as\nthe nightclub you can have it on your\nphone as well\nno but for the for the phone so i do\niris on the computer and then for the\ntelevision even though we don't watch\nmuch television i have a box installed\non that called a drift box that\ndecreases all the blue light from the\ntelevision and then for the phone\nobviously a lot of phones have built-in\nnative night mode but for the iphone in\nparticular which is what i use you can\ngoogle um iphone red light trick and you\ncan actually set your iphone so it\nliterally just like sucks\nall of the blue light out of the phone\nand turns it dark red kind of like how a\nlot of people who will do a dopamine\nfast will switch their phone to black\nand white for a week which i think is a\ngreat idea um this will switch it to red\nand so you combine all those factors\nalong with preferably and i'll do this a\nlot of time when i travel because i just\ndon't have as much say over the light\nbulbs in the hotel room or whatever\nwhere the blue light blocking glasses\nright at night especially\nand so basically you're just blasting\nyourself natural and blue light in the\nmorning and then complete absence of\nthat same light at night you want to get\nas close to just what would looking at\nfire look like at night\nso so light is one and it's interesting\nbecause light can also be used to shift\nyour circadian rhythm backwards or\nforwards so let's say we weren't sitting\nhere in la let's say we were in new york\nright and so\nmy wake time in new york being you know\nlet's say 6 a.m would dictate that if i\nwere back home on pacific time that's\nlike 3 a.m and if i'm in new york for a\nweek when i get back home to pacific\ntime my body's all of a sudden waking up\nat 3 a.m which is annoying and\nproblematic and i don't want to get up\nat 3am because there's not a lot a whole\nlot going on and i'm i'm a total fan\nlike i'm an early morning guy like i\nusually get up 4 30 or 5. but three is\npushing the envelope three's like you're\ndead by 11 a.m yeah you don't want to\ntalk to people and you didn't happen so\nanyways the trick there is when you're\nwaking up at 3 a.m if you do wake up and\nyou have to get out of bed and you just\nyou just you're going to get up you're\nmaybe whatever go do some yoga or read a\nbook or whatever\nyou trick your body into thinking it's\nstill nighttime by keeping your phone in\nnight mode by not turning on any lights\nin the house by putting those blue light\nblocking glasses that most people wear\nat night on in the morning instead and\nwhen the time rolls around when you\nactually want to send a message to your\nbody that this is the new time to wake\nup like let's say that 6 am then you\nflip on all the lights and you blast the\nbody with light and after two to three\ndays of doing that it's remarkable at\nhow quickly you can shift your circadian\nrhythms\nbackwards or forwards using light\nand again kind of like back to the whole\nbiohacking realm there are even in\naddition those light producing boxes\nthat you can put on top of your desk\nthey make uh ones that you can put in\nyour ears they look like headphones\nthey're called a human charger and they\nblast your\nyour your head with this blue light in\neither ear\nand then there's also a pair of glasses\nthat you can use you don't even need to\nsee that your entire body is a light\nreceptor machine and that's interesting\nbecause you could wear a sleep mask at\nnight but if your room's really light\nlike if you don't have blackout curtains\nor just there's lots of blinking things\nin the room or you walk into a hotel and\nyou turn off the lights and all of a\nsudden it looks like a spaceship because\nthe tv and the wi-fi and everything like\neven if your eyes are covered all that\nstuff hits your skin so when i say dark\nin the room like i make sure it's really\nsuper dark but you were talking about\ntemperature too obviously temperature is\nthat's like the second component of\nsleep hygiene so with temperature i i\nthink you said you're doing what like 65\n60 yeah yeah yeah i find because i you\nknow i i coach some people still for for\ntheir health and for their sleep and\neverything so i get to look at a lot of\ndata from from an aura ring or from a\nwoop or whatever wearable somebody is\nusing\nand i've identified that about 63 to 65\nfahrenheit is even better like if you're\ngetting it so even a bit lower my metric\nis if you're one of those people who and\ni think this is a good idea for staying\ncold who likes to take off all their\nclothes before they get into bed at\nnight or sleep in your underwear\nif you have mild cognitive resistance to\ntaking off your clothes at night before\nyou get into bed because it's a little\nchilly that's a pretty good sleep tip\nright so for me it's like it's a little\nchilly when i take my clothes off yeah\nthat's perfect and then um in addition\nto that i actually\nhave this this um pad underneath the top\nsheet of my bed is called a chili pad\nand it circulates like 55 degree cold\nwater under my body while i'm sleeping\nmy wife doesn't do most of the stuff\nthough so you just have it in your heart\nyeah the shoemaker's wife wears no shoes\ndude so i just don't bug her about i let\nher do her thing she likes to garden and\nhang out with the goats and chickens and\ngo on walks and so she just does her\nthing and i don't force anything on her\nbecause i i know what what'll happen\ndown there if i if i want to give my\nwife health advice i'll tell one of my\nfriends who's a doctor i'll be like text\nthis to jessa and then they text it to\nher because i just i just know she's\ngonna know now when she watches this no\nbecause that's the thing is she also\ndoes she's not gonna watch this she she\nwouldn't even know how to download a\npodcast so that's that's just who she is\nso anyways though so i have the chili\npad on my side and i can and and my sons\nboth have one too and they love it we\nall like so we have these big glorious\nfamily dinners at night and like right\nbefore dinner all of us boys run\nupstairs and turn on our chili pads so\nwe can sleep better so the bed's already\ncold when we get into it\nanother thing that you can do and it's a\nlittle bit paradoxical but it actually\nworks is you can pull on wool socks\nbefore you go to bed at night and when\nyour feet are warm there's these little\nvessels are called anastomosis or\nsomething like that but but it actually\nallows the rest of your body to stay\ncool when you warm some of those tiny\nvessels in the hands and the leg so you\nthink wearing wool socks to bed yeah\nkeep you warm but just like wear wool\nsocks and little else and you can\nactually\nsleep's something that everyone's\nstruggling with oh yeah it's it's i'm\nvery happy so critical please so the um\nthe thing with the um the the cold is\nthat\nif you do kind of like break the rules\nbecause there's all these rules now that\nall the scientists and their\ninstitutions have come up with that are\nannoying us like you're not supposed to\nwork out hard within three hours of\nbedtime and you're not supposed to eat a\nheavy meal within three hours prior to\nbedtime which for me can be socially\nproblematic because i love to have big\nglorious family dinners with people and\ngo out on the town and visit new\nrestaurants and i mean how often let's\nsay you're going about ten how often are\nyou really gonna be done with all that\nlike seven yeah unless you're just like\na total i don't know just a boring\nsocial outcast\nuh sorry to all the people who aren't\neating dinner but basically it's not\nthat hard you just get the body's core\ntemp back down like so if it's the\nwinter and i finish at dinner i'll go\nfor a brisk walk outside in the cold\nweather and if it is uh the summer or\nwarmer season just like a lukewarm or a\ncold shower before you go to bed like my\nsons and i just went down and watched\nthe fights down in vegas when it was\nlike 115 degrees on the strip and we'd\nwalk every night we'd walk home from the\nfights and the shows and everywhere we\nwent and every night before i get into\nbed you know there's a little bit of\nresistance to this but that's okay you\ncan you can you can um overcome the\nresistance but just take a cold shower\nbefore you get into bed and that helps\nto lower the core temp if you have had\nto exercise or you've had a heavy meal\nin those three hours prior to bedtime so\nyou've got the light and you've got the\ncold both the ambient temperature and\nthen your sleep surface and then your\nbody itself that you keep cold\nthe the other two that you want to think\nabout for sleep in addition to light and\ncold uh the first is noise and in the\ncity this is a bigger issue but i mean\neven i i've got roosters that like to\nget up kind of early because they're\nnaturally programmed to wake you up um\nand i've got um i live out in the forest\nbut there's a road nearby that sometimes\nsemis go down and i can hear off in the\ndistance the like the breaking like\nyou know when semis go downhill so i\nwear ear plugs like just soft wax\nearplugs to bed but then they've\nactually done studies on the different\nforms of ambient noise that help you to\nsleep at night you know they make like\nsleep machines that will make white\nnoise and brown noise and and one of the\nforms of noise that they make is pink\nnoise and pink noise it appears is the\nbest background noise to have playing in\nthe background i've never even sleep\nit's just like i don't know why they\ngive colors to certain noises but it's\nthe frequency and the pitch of that\nnoise so i've got an app on my phone\ncalled sleep stream i think it was free\nor the cost was was incidental but it's\ngot all these different like sleep\ntracks on it and i don't i don't use\nanything on it except the pink noise\nfunction so my phone goes in airplane\nmode next to my bed and then i push pink\nnoise on and i put the ear plugs in\nand then i'm covering up all those\nambient sounds that technique works a\nlot better when i'm traveling when i'm\nstaying in a hotel near busy roads\nwhen i'm when i have a roommate or\nsomething like that if i'm at a\nconference and i'm sharing a room with\nsomebody and they're getting up early or\nthey're going to bed late so the sound\nis another component especially if\nyou're a light sleeper\nand then the final component is safety\nand a lot of people don't think about\nthe safety component so your bed should\nbe a place where\nfrom from a nervous system standpoint\nyou're not wired up in work mode your\nsympathetic nervous system is not\nactivated if anything the bed is almost\nlike an anchor that activates the\nparasympathetic nervous system\nwell if you are one of those people who\nhas business books on your nightstand or\nmaybe you open your laptop up\nat night or really at any other time\nduring the day that would give your body\nthe impression that the bedroom or the\nbed particularly is an appropriate place\nto work\ni would say even that television\njust because psychologically you know we\nas humans are still hardwired to see\nthat television and it's as though a\nwhole bunch of other people and other\nexperiences are in your bedroom not to\nmention the fact that there's some\nreally interesting data that television\ncan replace dreaming right so\nessentially we live now in an era for\nthe past several decades where\nall of the colors and imagery and\nimagination and visualization and\ncreativity that your brain should be\nchurning out during sleep at night to\nprocess memories into process trauma and\nto process creativity\na lot of that can be replaced by staring\nat a television before you go to bed at\nnight so i i don't have a tv in the\nbedroom for those reasons and also for\nthe light reasons and also for the\nreason that i want my body to associate\nthe bed with pretty much nothing yeah\nbut sleep and sex and then i'll keep a\nboring book or a work of fiction next to\nthe bedside\nnow\ni used to when i'd get to a hotel room i\nwould just like you know plop on some\nespecially a small hotel room like a\nsuite usually you've got more than\nenough room but you know the small\nhotels a little crappy workstation in\nthe corner or whatever if that i'd just\nlike plop on my stomach on the bed and\nopen up my laptop you know i think a lot\nof people know what i'm talking about\nyou know just lay there on your belly\nand work on the laptop because it's a\ncomfortable spot to do that\nand the problem is that sends your body\nthis this cognitive signal that the bed\nis the place where you work so now i\nalways make sure my laptop even in a\nsingle room hotel room is not in the bed\nand that sends the body a message that\nthe bed is a safe place not a workplace\nnot a stressful place not an email\njumping out from your computer place\nand if you really want to take that\nsafety thing one step further this has\nbecome quite popular now this idea of\ngravity blankets meaning folks will sell\nlike these 10 15 20 or 25 pound gravity\nblankets and it sounds like it would be\ntotally paradoxical to what i was saying\nabout staying cool because it sounds\nheavy but a lot of a lot of folks are\ndoing a good job making like a gravity\nblanket that will stay cool that one\ncompany i was talking about chili pad\nthey even sell a gravity blanket that\nwill like circulate cold water through\nthe blanket but there's something about\nvery similar to like how when you were\nswaddled as a baby you felt protected\nand you felt like you were in this this\nquiet cave it's that feeling when you\npull on the gravity blanket and so when\nyou combine all that stuff the light the\ncold\nmanagement of sound and then presence of\nsafety in the bedroom you create a\nreal\na real real nice nest for getting those\nhours that are arguably the only hours\nduring your life you know arguably that\nthird of your life that your nervous\nsystem should be repairing that your\nbody should not be wired up to have\neverything activated that you shouldn't\nbe exposed to like lots of electrical\nsignals and i'm not one of those guys\nwho's like\ni don't know like go full on move up to\nthe mountains don't use internet cut\nyourself off from everything\nbut it appears that the issue with\nconstant exposure to all these\nelectrical signals that our bodies from\nan ancestral standpoint haven't been\nexposed to for thousands of years\nis\nthe fact that the cells don't get a\nbreak\nright so when we're looking at wi-fi and\nbluetooth and the constant opening of\nwhat are called calcium channels in the\ncell that allow a whole bunch of ions to\nspill into the cell that disrupt\nmetabolism or they give you brain fog\nlater on in the day\nthat's actually all pretty repairable\nthe body's actually pretty impressive\nand magical in terms of how quickly can\nbounce back from certain things just in\nthe same way they could recover from a\nhard exercise session and remove all\nthose muscle fibers or repair all those\nmuscle fibers if you give it rest yeah\nyou give a recovery\nthe the thing is it's the same thing\nwith electrical exposure like if you can\nturn your bedroom into a safe quiet cool\nplace that also doesn't have a whole\nbunch plugged in like wi-fi routers and\nphones etc you're all of a sudden giving\nyour ch your cells a chance to just go\nah\nit's like when people camp you know and\nthey just cut off from all that stuff\nthey feel great when they come back\nso it's not as though you have to live\nlike a luddite it's that sometimes you\nhave to press the pause button give your\nbody a chance to step away from all that\nelectricity for just you know that those\nseven or eight hours or however long\nyou're in there and then emerge back out\nrepaired and ready to tackle the day\nagain yeah that's\nuh you just told everyone how to make\ntheir bedroom into a sanctuary that was\na sanctuary yeah that's what it sounded\nlike yeah you were describing it i was\njust like and that's what it has to be a\nsanctuary it's safe a sanctuary yeah it\nhas to be and i think a lot of people\nbeat themselves up too because you know\nthere's a lot of really great sleep\nresearchers out there now\nyou know you've got guys like matthew\nwalker and\nnick littlehales and um\ngosh who who there's another another\nperson who's been doing a lot of work on\nsleep michael bruce is another guy\nbut over and over again what you see is\nyou're supposed to sleep seven to nine\nhours a night and a lot of people feel\nbad because they don't and i felt bad\nfor the longest time because i didn't\nand i'm like what can i like die of\ncancer early or am i am i gonna you know\nis my body gonna fall apart am i gonna\nlike accelerate aging because i just\ni've got too much going on or my body\njust like my eyes open wide at like 4 30\nand i just want to go crush the day\nright which which i think many people\nwho are dialed in to perhaps some of the\nthings that you talk about like your\nikigai your life's purpose your your\nplan davida you know speaking of\nsardinia this idea of your purpose for\nlife well if you have a really strong\npurpose for life\nsometimes you wake up in the morning and\nyou're just like baby let's go bring it\non\nand for me\nyou know with our big glorious family\ndinners and i read my son's stories at\nnight and i played the music on the\nguitar and i'll make love to my wife and\nread some fiction so you know even with\nall that i can usually do a pretty good\njob being close to asleep by 10. yeah\nbut getting up at 4 or 4 30 that's six\nto six and a half hours\nso the thing is that if you do that\nbut also you take a nap like a\npost-lunch siesta for example\nuh the the siesta even if it's like 20\nto 45 minutes long can simulate what you\nget out of a full\n90 minute ish sleep cycle so the way\nthat i live my life is i sleep six to\nsix and a half hours a night and then\nlike clockwork after lunch every day or\nif i have a meeting after lunch\nsometimes it's slightly later in the\nafternoon i try to push it too close to\nbedtime because you want some sleep\ndrive going into the night i take a nap\nit's like a siesta for me it's 20 to 45\nminutes i i do kind of this is where\nsome of the bio hacking comes in i'm\nlike okay we got 20 to 45 minutes i want\nto make this effective yeah so what i do\nis\na i have something similar to like that\nsensory deprivation float tank that you\nuse down at pause i actually had a float\ntank for a while but it was too much\nupkeep for me\nmagnesium yeah my whole basement looked\nlike a freaking pool house so\ni have what's called a hyperbaric\nchamber which is like this chamber that\nthey use in hospitals for repairing\nwounds and um and and they'll use it for\nlike cardiovascular problems and\nincreasing red blood cells and it\npressurizes you at about what's called\n1.4 atmosphere so it's like you're 23 25\nfeet under the ocean with the pressure\nbut then you're breathing pure oxygen\nand so the combination of the pure\noxygen plus the pressure drives that\noxygen into the tissue accelerates\nrepair you know clears the brain i mean\neven if you weren't napping in it you\nfeel amazing when you get out and so i\nclimb in that and i like it too because\ni have to zip myself up and it's kind of\nlike nobody can get to me it even takes\nlike three minutes to decompress me so\nif the house caught on fire i'd be kind\nof screwed\nbut i i climb into that so i'm just like\ni'm locked off from the world right\nand then i i have a couple of\ntechnologies that i use\none is called a a hap b oh yeah that's\nlike have you seen this it's super cool\ni've been messing around with it for\nlike five months now it uses a magnetic\nsignal that simulates the same molecular\nsignal of a few choice compounds like\nfor simulating wakefulness you could\nchoose like the caffeine setting the\nnicotine setting\nfor for it's got like an alcohol setting\nwhat's it doing so basically all it does\nis it causes your cells to respond as\nthough that particular molecule were\nattached to the cell receptor without\nyou actually ingesting a compound or\ntaking a supplement or consuming\nsomething that's going to stay in your\nsystem for a long period of time so\nlet's say i want a wakey wakey prior to\ngoing out to a dinner party i could put\nit in coffee mode right put that around\nmy neck or on my head get that that hit\nwakefulness producing hit of caffeine\nbut then when i take it off it's not\nlike the caffeine's still floating\naround in my system\nsame thing with a nap so what i like so\nit's in your system only for as long as\nright it's just it's as though i were\nblasting with the electrical signal of\ncoffee without you actually having to\ndrink the coffee which has a half-life\nof you know whatever six or eight or ten\nhours depending on on how you're you're\nyou're genetically wired up so it's\nreally cool and i didn't really believe\ni'll interview a lot of people on my\npodcast i'm like yeah that's a little\nwoo\nbut then i tried it and it actually\nworks surprisingly well so i put it in\nmy my preferred mode for nap is the one\nthat's uh it's called relax but it\nmimics cbd right which is which is nice\nfor me um because it just kind of you\nknow settles down some racing thoughts\ngets me down at the end of the day so i\nput that on\nand then i also have this other device\nthat works kind of similarly but instead\nof using a magnetic signal\nit vibrates and it's a it's a tiny\nvibration that elicits a brainwave\nsignal that could be like an alpha\nbrainwave signal or a kind of like a\nhyped up beta brainwave signal or a deep\nrelaxation like theta or delta brainwave\nsignal and that's called an apollo and\nthat also similar to the hat b has like\na wakefulness mode a social mode i even\nput that that happy one which also has\nan alcohol mode on it i i gave it to my\nson who wanted to try it out at dinner\none night and it was in like social\nalcohol mode he got like super funny and\nhe was joking he was really relaxed as\nsoon as i took it off of him he was just\nnormal again\ni wasn't giving my son actual alcohol\nthis is just like simulating the effects\nso i put the the apollo in relax mode i\nput the hat b in relax mode and and i\nclimb into that hyperbaric chamber and\nthen i've got like lavender essential\noil in there and i i lay back and then i\nplay this this track and i i i discover\na lot of things through podcasting half\nthe stuff i learn is from talking to\npeople i'm learning right now super\nduper smart who'd normally never give me\nthe time of day and i get to pick the\nbrains of these scientists you're doing\nthat for me\nfor like 90 minutes twice a week so it's\nway better than my college education\njust talking all these people and\nfinding out what works and what doesn't\nbut a couple years ago i interviewed\nthis guy who has a company called new\ncalm yes\nhas an app that that plays special\nsignals and this sounds like like\neight billion other apps out there that\nwill play like relaxing signals at night\nthere are a dime a dozen on the app\nstore but this one in particular it just\nseems to work for me\nmost notably\nin in the way that i can put it on like\n20 minutes\nand i i'm dead to the world within like\ntwo minutes of that thing playing\ni'll wake up at the 20-minute mark and\nfeel like i've slept like an hour this\nis something else yeah as a matter of\nfact i asked the guy when i interviewed\nhim\nwell you know could this just replace\nlike the pink noise that i play at night\nhe said no no no no don't do that\nbecause it pushes you through a sleep\ncycle so well that if you put it on to\nsleep at night you'd you'd go through\nyour sleep cycle from let's say like 10\nto 11 30 then you'd wake up wide awake\nat night right so this is something\nthat's better in my opinion for naps the\nother time i'll sometimes use it is if i\nwake up let's say at like\n3 34 and i want to snag an extra 30 40\nminutes of sleep or whatever i'll put it\non that\nso i do the nap of the apollo the hat b\nthe hyperbaric the the oil and then the\num\nthat that hat b\nand\neven though i'm sleeping six to six and\na half hours a night i get up from that\nnap\nand i'm kind of groggy for like\n10-15 minutes but what i do is i go and\ni jump in that cold pool\nright and then i'll have some kind of\nstimulant like i'll just pop a piece of\nnicotine gum or you know have a little\nleftover coffee from the night before\nwhatever and then boom like it's like i\nhave a second day\ni feel amazing i'm fully present with my\nfamily that night at dinner whereas if i\npush through that afternoon slog it's\njust kind of like get to dinner and\nyou're just kind of like i can't wait\nuntil bedtime yeah and i don't like that\nfeeling personally i'm just impressed at\nyour charging skills like you must have\nthe most organizing charging schedule\nfor all these devices\nthey all need to be like i'm impressed\nlike most people can't even charge their\nphone you're like here yeah it's kind of\num\nseven devices like so it's amazing and i\nmean that genuinely i'm not just yeah\ni've got one charging station in the\ndining room that i just kind of keep\neverything plugged into um so yeah i've\ngot like four or five devices that i'm\nkind of charging during the day\nor the reason that i plug them in is not\nbecause they have a low battery life and\nthey need to be charged and this is\nimportant for people to know yeah any of\nthese devices or anything i try i have a\nhard and fast rule that it must be able\nto be placed in airplane mode for the\nreasons that i stated earlier so if\nsomebody's like trying to trying to like\nsell me or have me try like some crazy\nnew sleep system you know mattress self\nself-quantification device or whatever\none of the first questions i ask is well\ncan i disable the wi-fi or can i put it\nin airplane mode so that during the time\ni'm using it especially for rest i'm not\ngetting bombarded by signals i'm so\nhappy you brought this up yeah and so\nmost of them can but the problem is when\nyou place a device in airplane mode\ntypically to reconnect it to your phone\nbecause most of these are run via some\nkind of an app on your phone you have to\nplug it back into a charger and that\nlike\ni'm i'm not an engineer it it takes out\nairplane mode basically and so\na lot of times i do have to like plug\nthings in you know get up from my nap\nplug the hat b and the apollo in so\nthey're ready for the next day\nbut um\nbut yeah it's uh there there are ways\nespecially in our day and age that you\ncan definitely get by without\njust swallowing hook line and sink or\nyou know that the eight to nine hours of\nsleep a night message like there's a lot\nof ways around it yeah tell me about a\ntime ben when like\nfor you\nthis you know you've always been\nathletic you you are an athlete you've\nbeen an athlete you spoke about it\nbefore but you also mentioned that\nyou know there\nthere have been times when\nyou you didn't feel this way and i want\nto hear a bit about that about how your\nlife was before you\nreally understood the body as deeply as\nyou do today\nbecause because i feel like for a lot of\npeople when they see you like to me as\nwell and i really mean this in a genuine\nway i i see you as like wow this guy's\nlike just you know\nreally understands the body really\nunderstands the mind and it and you're\nan expert so you sound like an expert\nbut i know for a fact that you weren't\nborn that way\nand and that's not how you've always\nbeen and i'd love for people to hear\nabout that journey around tell me about\na time when you didn't feel boundless\nwhen you didn't feel as\nlike now it's like you know how to turn\nthis and you play with this and now it's\nan experiment and it's fun and you enjoy\nit tell us about when you kind of were\nlike\ndid you ever feel broken health-wise did\nyou ever feel like everything was just a\nmess were you ever in the place that\nmost of my audience may be feeling like\nwell they're just like jay i i'm just\nstruggling to get out of bed in the\nmorning like i don't sleep oh i've got\nlike bloated i'm feeling gassy like\ntell me about when you felt like you\nwere at your worst as opposed to what we\nsee now\nthere's three things that i want to tell\nyou right now\nwhen i was a kid\ni was homeschooled k through 12. the\nemphasis of my homeschooling was really\nmore on\na classical education centered around\nlatin and logic and rhetoric and the\ngreat books and\ntons of reading which i loved i would my\nhappy place was the library and my\nparents would have to take me out of the\nbedroom and almost like threaten me with\npunishment if i wouldn't come out and\nsocialize with people because i just\nwanted to be in there with my books\ni played the violin for 13 years i was i\nwas present of the chess club i love to\ntake about part computers right and and\ndesign video games and and you know and\nand figure out how my hard drive worked\nand was an early adopter of a lot of\nthese technologies in a very geeky way\nyou know prior to the advent of social\nmedia et cetera you know when it was you\nactually had to kind of have a working\nknowledge of some of these technologies\nand i i i was i was pretty much like a\ngeeky little christian homeschooled kid\ni remember the stuff i got mad about\nwhen i was a kid was like when some kid\nwould like quilt a doily at the at our\nhomeschool talent competition and beat\nout my watercolor painting right like\nand so was it your mother and father\nthat were both oh it was the home school\nlike there was a group of kids and\nteachers both we had a pretty good\nhomeschool collective so i didn't\ncompletely miss out on social life yeah\ni was a weird kid in that i was very\nindependently driven to learn and i am\nstill that way now definitely my parents\nwould literally just give me books and\nwalk away they would literally give me\nthe whole year's math curriculum and\nthen just like make sure i took the test\nmy siblings were not the same and needed\na lot more kind of hand holding but i've\nalways been curious and driven from from\nan independent learning standpoint\nand it really wasn't until i discovered\nthe sport of tennis that i became\ninterested in physical culture at all\nwhen i\nuh\nmy parents wanted to create a really\ncool\nenvironment for all of us to grow up in\nso one day they announced that they were\ngoing to bring in some folks and and we\nwere all going to pitch in and you know\nlearn a little bit of construction and\nlay asphalt and build a tennis court so\nwe built a tennis court and\nthey hired a tennis instructor and her\nname was michelle and i had a big crush\non her which helped with my motivation\nto play more tennis but i also loved\ntennis and i got really good at it and\nit came really naturally to me and i\nstarted to run up the hills behind my\nhouse my dad took me down to the local\nsporting goods store to buy little\n10-pound dumbbells and i started to\nfigure out like you know how to drink\nmilk to get strong and the kind of\nthings that made me faster and you know\nhow to stay hydrated and water and\nminerals and\ni had a couple of mentors a guy who was\nmy my younger brother's best friend's\ndad was a bodybuilder so all of a sudden\ni'm learning about nutrition and working\nout from him\nanother friend is a power lifter so by\nthe time i'm like 15 i was done with\nhigh school so i'm like you know i don't\nwant to go program computers or paint\nwatercolor like i want to go learn more\nabout this body and so i walked onto the\nlocal college tennis team when i was 15\nand um started playing tennis started\nstudying exercise science got a master's\ndegree in in physiology and biomechanics\nand you know wound up opening a whole\nbunch of personal training studios and\ngyms in washington and idaho\nand just have been hardcore in the\nhealth and fitness and nutrition scene\never since then\nso initially i really wasn't interested\nin much of this stuff at all\nbut at that point i spent like 20 years\ncompeting in all these crazy hardcore\nyou know obstacle course races and\nironman triathlons and open water swims\nand adventure races that was my life for\nlike 20 years was using my body as a\nguinea pig using all these races and\nevents as like a battlefield to test\nstuff out i was coaching i was competing\ni was traveling\nand um i\nthought i was the bee's knees when it\ncame to fitness i would say that if you\nwere to look at me and judge me through\nwhat our world considers to be fitness\nwhich i think is a bastardized version\nof fitness i was one of the fittest\nhumans on the planet like like i really\ndid look good in spandex and could ride\nmy bike really fast you know run up\nhills\nand\nto reply to the meat of part of your\nquestion it was about\nnine years ago or so when i really got\ninto self quantification testing of\nblood work testing of biomarkers uh\nsleep nervous system uh you know all\nthese things that we can easily test now\nthat you normally would have had to pay\ntens of thousands of dollars for you\nknow the princeton longevity institute\nor some executive facility you know only\navailable to wealthy ceos we cannot get\nall these tests in our own home\nand i got super interested in this stuff\nand i started to get all these tests and\ni realized oh crap\ni can't fit\non the outside but i'm dying on the\ninside high inflammation low\ntestosterone dysregulated thyroid gut\ninflammation and gut issues and\nconstipation and brain fog and\nall these issues that technically\nsomebody with like low body fat and\nmuscles who can like run and lift\nweights you wouldn't expect to have yeah\nthat's right\nbut really true fitness is not about\ngoing to a little fake box at the\nbeginning of the day and pushing you\nknow fake heavy things around for an\nhour and then walking out and assuming\nthat you're good to go and maybe kind of\nsort of eating healthy like a protein\nbar or trader joe's or whatever\num there's so much more there's there's\nso much more when it comes to the body\nand that's what i began to discover my\nfirst\nbig book that i wrote called beyond\ntraining was just that it was like okay\nso as an athlete there's all these other\nthings like digestion and hormones and\nendocrine system and inflammation and\nblood sugar regulation and immune system\nintegrity and all these things that we\ndon't think about when it comes to what\nit truly takes to have long health span\nand lifespan\nand so what i discovered along the way\nwas all of these things like not i mean\nmen's health magazine or women's health\nmagazine whatever will tell you how to\nexercise and how to eat healthy okay\nmaybe sometimes they miss the mark a\nlittle bit but for the most part it's\nnot rocket science for somebody to go\nout there and figure out okay eat real\nwhole\nfood that's recognizable that preferably\nis as close to earth as possible and\nthen like move your body lift heavy\nstuff and occasionally breathe hard\nplaying tennis or soccer high intensity\ninterval training or whatever like we've\nkind of cracked the code on eating\nhealthy and moving and most people can\nfind that information for free pretty\nreadily\nbut what most people don't pay attention\nto\nare all the things that the body really\ntruly needs to be optimized to produce\natp to produce energy and and this is a\nbig part of what my my last book\nboundless was about\nlike\nuh light and how the photons of light\ninteract with the human body to charge\nup the mitochondria to allow it to be\nable to produce atp the negative ions\nand the electricity produced by the\nplanet earth that dictate when you're\noutside barefoot or you're touching\ntrees and rocks you're soaking up all\nthose negative ions and just restoring\nthe the the natural state of the\nelectricity the body the body which is\nlike a battery is supposed to be in when\nyou get exposed to stressors of heat or\nstressors of cold\nthere's enormous variants that that\nspring up in the human body like uh like\nuh like like uh heat shock proteins and\ncold shock proteins and blood flow and\nnitric oxide when you drink pure clean\nwater that's chock full of minerals\nright trace liquid minerals or sea salts\nor things like that that carries that\nelectrical charge through your body and\ni began to realize holy cow i thought\nyou're just supposed to like go to the\ngym and eat a protein bar to be healthy\nbut oh my gosh it's like sunlight it's\nmagnetism it's water it's earth it's\nheat it's cold it's it's positive\nrelationships and love and gratitude and\nand all these things that we just\nwe forget about when it comes to being a\nfull complete human being and so that\nwas when the light bulb happened for me\nwhen i realized i'm healthy on the\noutside but i'm dying on the inside and\nthere's all sorts of avenues that this\nentire fitness world has yet to explore\nwhen it comes to what it truly means to\nhave you know what i talk about in the\nbook you know what i call boundless\nenergy\nso number number one is no i didn't\nalways like this stuff but i gradually\ndeveloped a love for it and i think my\ncuriosity my independent drive to learn\nand the fact that i was a real geek just\ntended to fuel my drive to learn a lot\nof these things about how people can\nreally feel good\nand then number two i after 20 years\nrealized my own mistake of just like\nbeating up the body and expecting it to\nbounce back and thinking that was true\nfitness\nand then finally c and this is really\nthis is where i'm where i'm really\ndriving a lot of my platform my\nteachings what i what i really want to\nfocus probably for the rest of my life\non\nis the fact that we can achieve all\nthese things we've been talking about\njay\nyou can sleep like a champ and you can\nhave you know if it's important you\nwhatever six-pack abs or veins in your\nabs or you know be able to do a\ntriathlon or an obstacle race or just\nlike rule the crossfit box or\nyou know anything else that might be\nimportant to you have a full head of\nhair defy aging low wrinkles like like\nhow many\nclose to billion dollar industries have\nsprung up around us trying to optimize\nourselves as human beings and yet at the\nend of the day because i see this over\nand over again not only in having\nexperienced this myself but having seen\nthis in many of like the wealthy and\nsuccessful executives i coach and pro\nathletes i've worked with and and people\nwho appear on the outside to be crushing\nit in life at the end of the day\nnone of this is fulfilling none of this\nis ultimately fulfilling\nokay like i i can literally be like pose\non the cover of a magazine whatever you\nknow with with girls draped off of each\narm you know eating 100 steaks for\ndinner every night and experiencing you\nknow what many people would would covet\nas an amazing life but i got news for\nyou i'm not happy in that state and and\ni've i've seen a lot of people also not\nbe happy in that state because there is\na yearning in our soul there is a hole\nin our soul right there is there is this\ndeep longing for some kind of\nfulfillment\nthat in my world\nwe throw fitness and a healthy diet and\nthe way you look and the way you perform\ninto\nother people will throw cars throw money\nthrow sex\nthrow throw\nhomes throw experiences\nthrow\nanything else that seems like it might\nbe that one thing that you've finally\ndiscovered that's going to be the\nultimate key to fulfillment right i\nfinally about to cross the finish line\nof that ironman triathlon oh boy life's\ngoing to be different after this it's\ngoing to be different i've done it and\nnow i can just be on cruise control the\nrest of my life because i've checked\nthat fulfillment box\nbut at the end of the day none of that\nstuff is fulfilling because and and you\nknow i'm i'm\nthe\npeople came before me who have\nidentified this this isn't new\ninformation that i came up with myself\nbut there is this is you know a great\nwriter and theologian named blaise\npascal would describe it as a god-shaped\nhole in our hearts eternity in our\nhearts and the only thing that's going\nto fill an infinite abyss an eternal\nabyss a god-shaped hole in your heart is\ngod\nis\nsome type of fulfillment that's\neverlasting that's eternal\nand\nonce i realize that and realize oh my\ngosh like i could train my body all day\nlong but even though physical training\nis a little bit beneficial\nit's nothing compared to training for\nforever it's nothing compared to\ngratitude to\nrelationships to\nsharing with others to loving others to\nvolunteer to service to community to to\nto worship to having something greater\noutside of you and believing that a\nstory is written for your life\nin and\nyou know now that i understand that all\nof these things that i've learned all\nthese fun little biohacks that we talk\nabout at the end of the day are\ninteresting but not going to make you\nultimately happy\nwell now\nif you have been doing those things if\nyou are taking care of your body right\nyou do have a really good body and brain\nyou're bio hacking your fit and you're\nhealthy and you're eating well\nman\nwhen when\nyou put not what i would call the icing\non the cake or the cherry on the cupcake\nbut really lay that on the core on the\nfoundation\nof a deeply meaningful spiritual life\nthen you're firing on all cylinders and\nso\ni think that's what's really important\nfor people to understand is you know the\nwool socks and the chili pad and and the\nthe hyperbaric chamber at the end of the\nday\nwhat you should view those as is you\nshould view those as a way to equip\nyourself to be more impactful with the\npurpose that you've been given in life\nnot as your source of happiness\nben that was\nso powerful and\ni\nyou know the way you just shared that\nand the way you even talk about\nbiohacking and\nmastering the body\nfrom the beginning of this interview you\ncan tell that it's\nto have these beautiful exchanges with\nyour family to have a meaningful dinner\nand you know when i hear you talk about\nthese things like it resonates so deeply\nwith me\nbecause what you just set up is exactly\nwhy\nwe do need to do these things who wants\nto be at dinner with their family and be\nlike\nhave brain fog and have confusion and be\nstressed out and just be looking forward\nto bedtime or to be spending time with\ntheir partner but not having the energy\nto go on a beautiful walk or a hike or\nwhatever it may be like and that's the\nchallenge we're having that our health\nis negatively impacting our\nrelationships like for those of us who\nare experiencing fatigue for those of us\nwho are experiencing bloating for those\nof us who are experiencing inflammation\nthat's leading to stress and agitation\nin your relationships you think that\nyou're just not getting along\nit is you you cannot disentangle the\nbody and the spirit and there are some\npeople that have taken this to uh to\nextremes like if you look at\nat the the the gnostics right a very\nvery popular religion about the same\ntime that that christianity was rising\nyou know in 50 60 70 a.d they believed\nthat all things fleshly and physical\nwere evil and bad and that the only\nthing important was the spirit and that\nmarriage was bad and that good food was\nbad and anything that even remotely\nwreaked of epicureanism was bad and one\nshould be stoic but stoke to the nth\ndegree and\nthe fact is that the body is sacred\nfood is sacred\nit's not just this physical biological\ninteraction with your taste buds sex is\nsacred it's not just two bodies rubbing\ntogether in mutual masturbation\nuh\num you know\nfitness and even the movement of\nelectrons for the body you know in\ntraditional chinese medicine and you\nknow they they call that the chi the\nlife force the prana the energy and\nwestern medicine we call it the\nmitochondria it's the same thing there's\na deep spiritual aspect to that\nand so we we are bodies with spirits and\nthe body\nmust be treated as a temple that is to\nhouse the spirit and the spirit must be\ntreated as the one part of us that we\ncare for the most because that's what's\ngoing to go on for eternity and that's\nwhat we we really use is our deep fuel\nand our fire every day and so yeah in an\nideal scenario when you wake up in the\nmorning\nin addition to\nimpacting this world fully with whatever\npurpose you've been given with your life\nin a spirit of loving others you should\nalso be asking yourself how can i equip\nboth my body and my spirit today\nto be as impactful as possible and it's\nand it's both and you can have both you\ndon't have to be like a\nyeah you know no no offense jay but like\nwhatever like a skinny yogi\nmonk who's you know who who can't hold\nup a heavy weight without their bones\nbreaking you also don't want to be an\nadonis at the gym who just basically\ndoesn't even know what a gratitude\npractice is or how to pray to god or\nanything like that\nbut human beings we are we are some of\nthe most complex if not the most complex\ncreature on the face of the planet yeah\nmaybe maybe a platypus or something\nmight be up there kind of interesting\nbut\nwe\nwe we have the ability to live our lives\nwith this amazing body and an amazing\nspirit and in my opinion there's no\nreason that you can't have both and man\nwhen you when you get into the into that\nstate of literally having your cake and\neating it too on the highest level life\nis amazing and everybody everybody every\nsingle person listening in right now has\nthe capability to get to that level as\nlong as they realize that most people\naround them have settled for status quo\nand if you realize that you actually can\nrise above and you can train your spirit\nand you can train your body and all of\nthis is is learnable all of this is\nteachable all of this is practicable and\nhabit formationable and i'm going to\nstop making up words now but if anybody\nhas us within their power to be able to\naccomplish yeah well said no and i feel\nthe same way you know for years i\nfocused extensively on the mind i\nfocused extensively on intention i\nfocus deeply on\ngratitude service and and that's where i\nspent most of my life because that's\nwhat i naturally gravitated towards it's\nwhat my\nmonk training was based on it's what\nmy heart was drawn to and everything you\njust shared and and i find myself now\ncoming over to the other side right and\nwanting to learn more about the body\nright and so what you just said is it\nsits very closely with my heart because\ni grew up as someone who dived deep into\nthe spirit and the mind and the heart\nand the soul\nwhich has been the foundation of\nanything that i do today but i have come\nbackwards almost yeah and i'm not taking\nit backwards or forwards i just think\ni've i've come to that realization that\nmy spirit can only do as much as my body\nand it's crazy because as monks the\norder of our priorities were meant to be\nhealth\nsadhana service and so health is health\nas you're saying it your physical your\nbody your temple health sadhana is your\ndaily practices of gratitude intention\nprayer and then savor or service is you\nthen sharing that with the world right\nso the pyramid was meant to be there\nyeah but some of us including me decided\nto skip that first one\nand do two and three\nand i'm almost you know the reason why\nspeaking to you is so powerful and some\nof the things that i've started\nexperimenting with and playing with\nprobably in the last couple of years\nuh have have been totally that direction\nof i now want to understand my body so\nthat i can serve better yep so that i\ncan surf for longer so that i can have\nmore deep loving exchanges that's that's\nthe goal right when you come at it with\nlove others yeah right\nnot how do i look in the mirror no that\nwas that's why i never forgot how fast\nit's loving others and in the very same\nway that the best businesses are not\nnecessarily built on a monetary goal\nbut are built upon a goal of how many\npeople can we serve how many people can\nwe touch how many lives can we affect\nand the money\nwill follow yes i mean for me as a\nbusiness person right like i have to\nmake a living and i'm a content producer\nkind of like you like a lot of my\nbusiness is driven by me educating\npeople and when i write an article or\nwhen i record a podcast or when i'm you\nknow doing an instagram post or whatever\nit is\ni tell myself okay my goal even if there\nis a product a solution that's offered\nhere as part of this post or this\npodcast or this story that someone can\ngo buy my goal is that someone finishes\ndigesting this content listening to this\naudio reading this essay looking at this\npost and walks away a better person\nregardless of whether or not they\nactually purchase anything yeah right\nthey walk away whatever knowing more\nabout the gut knowing more about the\nhormones knowing more about the brain\nknowing more about gratitude knowing\nmore about whatever it is that that i'm\nproducing content about i tell you what\nwhen i write in that way and i teach in\nthat way and i produce content in that\nway\ni don't have to worry about money that\njust kind of follows right like like and\nhonestly it follows in a better way\nbecause you create a more hardcore\naudience that trusts what you have to\nsay because you actually care about them\nand that's why you're getting out of bed\nin the morning and so it should be the\nsame way for yourself when you go to the\ngym and try this if you're listening in\nright now if you go hit the gym tomorrow\nor you go out you know whatever your\nbasement and you know you're breathing\nhard and beating yourself up and doing\nyour burpees or whatever the case may be\nthink about how you're equipping\nyourself to be impactful at work to be\npresent for your family to have a\nlifespan and health span that enables\nyou to be passing wisdom on to your\ngreat grandkids or your\ngreat-great-grandkids that that level of\nmotivation that you experience when\nyou're doing things to love others\nor arguably also doing things to equip\nyourself to to just be able to more\nfully savor this amazing planet that we\nare on\nall of a sudden man compared to like\nwhat's the scale we're going to say\ntoday it's just a much much\nmore empowering way to train for health\nyeah yeah i couldn't agree more man i\ncouldn't agree more tell me before we\nget to the final five questions of the\ninterview we're nearly at the end i want\nto ask you\nif someone you you very\nemphatically stated that anyone who's\nlistening to this anyone who's watching\ncan do this can have both i'm with you i\nagree with you i'm aligned with you\ntell me about what you said earlier you\nwere saying\njay you know i still work with a few\npeople on coaching and you were sharing\nto me i should sleep between 63 and 65.\nthat's going to be better for me\n65 to 67.\nso much of this is habit change you've\ncreated so many new habits in your life\nexperimented for those of you who have\nnot read boundless when you pick it up\nwhat i love about the book is you break\nit down into tiny sections around\nexplaining each part of the science but\nthen giving a practical thing that\nsomeone can do today you have technology\nthat if people want to adopt it\nhabit change is a huge part of what you\ndo where are people going wrong\nin their habit change what have you seen\nthrough your extreme experimenting where\nhabit changes actually worked for people\ni would say what comes to mind for me\nfirst when you ask that question is um\na big big part of it is relevance and\nunderstanding why you are doing\nsomething when i was in high school i\nreally hated math and science and when i\ngot to college i just became a standout\nin math and science because i had a\nteacher first year of college who made\nmath relevant by tying in a lot of\nwealth preservation and savings and\ninvesting components that made math\nsuper relevant to me and so at that\npoint i just developed this wonderful\nlove for math and a habit of studying\nmath because it was relevant that i knew\nwhy i was doing it so understand why\nyou're doing something you know i think\nthat the importance of education when it\ncomes to habit formation is is very\nimportant yeah um\nanother one that that\ni\ni rely upon on a daily basis for either\nstopping habits or making habits\nis making something as accessible and\nconvenient as possible meaning that i am\nprobably like from a fitness standpoint\nand a consistency of fitness standpoint\nprobably\njust about as fit as i've ever been in\nterms of true health and some of those\nparameters we were talking about earlier\nbecause\npartially i really haven't had to leave\nmy house to go to the gym and was kind\nof forced into that because of kovid so\neverything i need is i gotta step over a\nkettlebell to walk into my gym i gotta\nlike walk underneath the pull-up bar to\ngo down the stairs in my house\ni have to um\nbasically like walk past a cold tub\nevery day\nand you know and and you know\nthere there's just healthy food strewn\nall about the house\nthis idea of surrounding yourself and\nmaking everything convenient down to the\npoint where if you're going to go for a\nrun in the morning having your running\nshoes and your shorts right there beside\nthe bed so there's very little\ncognitive resistance to starting that\nwould be the second thing that i found\nto be really useful is making things\nconvenient\ni think the last one is\nfor me personally and i don't know if\nthis is the way for everybody\nbut i like especially when it comes to\nhealth habits to be able to\nstack things so anytime that i'm getting\nhealthy i'm also making myself a better\nperson for example i really rarely\nlisten to music when i'm working out i i\nview my workout as also a chance to\nfor me to go to university right so it's\nalways podcast audiobooks when the going\ngets really hard there's actually been\nsome studies that have shown this to be\na cool tactic that's when the music goes\non like when you need it the last minute\nso you're kind of like saving your brain\nto get to the point where it really\nreally needs the music and it's not\njust kind of um\nused to the music at that point and can\nactually push past um you know i i do\nlike the red light therapy and the\ngrounding and the earthing mats and the\nessential oils and this special like\nwater repair device called a nano v on\nmy desk when but i don't go in there and\njust do all that stuff and have a be\nunproductive time like that's the time\nwhen i bang out my first 45 minutes of\nemails for the day\nso i always figure out a way to make\nsomething more palatable in terms of\ntying that habit into something i mean i\neven like i got out of the habit you\nknow because i'm a big fan of reading\nscripture and reading the bible every\nmorning\nand i i even found myself and this\nhappened a few months ago i was saying i\nread my bible i'm like why am i just\nsitting here reading the bible aren't\nthere other things that i could be doing\nand you'd think that'd be distracting\nbut now i read my bible while i'm\nsitting in a pulsed electromagnetic\nfield chair with a biocharger on and\nit's like i'm still reading but my\nbody's kind of like getting better at\nthe same time so i love to stack healthy\nhabits and it's very rewarding when you\nstack them all and also figure out how\nto still be productive during the day so\nit's not like you're having to rob peter\nto pay paul it's like you're paying paul\nand peter at the same time so those are\nthe top three things that come to mind\neducate yourself about why you're doing\nwhat you're doing surround yourself with\nwhat you need to maintain positive\nhabits while hiding the things that\nwould cause you to form negative habits\nand then\nbasically\nstack habits and make the habit fun or\nmeaningful or productive so you don't\nfeel like you're wasting time engaging\nthat habit i love that ben greenfield\neveryone ben that was amazing i'm like\nyou need to come on for a part two but\nwe can't wait this long as we waited to\ndo a part 1.\nyeah maybe we can go to some other\nlongevity hot spot yeah\nokinawa would be interesting that would\nbe amazing sushi and purple potatoes i\nhaven't been i've spent a lot of time in\njapan i used to race over there a lot\nand i've spoken over there a couple of\ntimes but\ni absolutely i i love the\ni love the food um\nlike depending where i'm at i like the\nculture i would say probably one of my\nfavorite places over there would be\nkyoto right just great great touring\ngreat walks and yeah i'm i'm a fan of\ni'm a fan of sushi although now i i um\ni know we're trying to wrap up but i'll\nfinish here i i've been making my own\nsushi i found this\nfish service called ctopia and they\ndeliver sashimi grade fish to my house\nevery week wow and so it's kind of\nspoiled me i literally just take out my\nsushi knife cut it in strips put it in a\nnori wrap with some sushi rice little\nmustardian whatever i want to sprinkle\non there and so my sons and i make poke\nbowls and sushi all the time now uh but\ni i do i do enjoy a good good actual\nlegitimate yeah japanese sushi\nrestaurant occasions\nof course yeah amazing man well ben we\nend every episode with our final five\nwhich are false five so answers after\none word\ntwo one word one word two ten words\nmaximum okay each answer all right so\nwords have dashes that's the most\nimportant thing yes so the question\nnumber one is what is the worst health\nadvice you've ever received\nit would probably be and i won't have a\nwhole lot of time to explain this too\nmuch but it would be\neat a post-workout meal okay we'll save\nthat for part two\nis that boundless\nall right great question number two\nwhat's the best health advice you've\never received or given or heard get out\nin the sunlight more um\ni need to do that a lot more i was\ntalking to someone in my health life\nrecently they were like because of the\ncolor of my skin i have to really be out\nthere so i'm a sun worshiper i love\nbeing out there but i'm not out there\nenough even though because of my skin we\nhave a giant battery in the sky and\nbarely any of us use it yeah love that\nall right uh third question what would\nyou describe as your current
