    "transcript": "getting to a root of trauma speaking of\nvoices a lot of the voices we are\nhearing like you said those negative\nvoices in our head um the very patterned\nones the habitual ones i call them\nthey're them those are stories they\ncould be a big indicator of the root of\ntrauma in a sense so to be clear um\nbecause i am asked often like do we have\nto know right so the\nthe\ngist of this question is is there an\nuncovering do we have to go back to that\nmoment\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow now you know that\nwe get this amazing opportunity to sit\ndown with minds from the worlds of\ncelebrity and music all the way through\nto experts in their field and thought\nleaders business leaders and today's\nguest is someone that i've been wanting\nto speak to for a long long time i saw\nso many of her interviews i read her\nbook she's a number one new york times\nbest-selling author of a book called how\nto do the work i highly recommend it\nwe'll put the link to the book in the\ncomments so you can go and grab a copy\nwe've been dming away and she's finally\nhere today i'm talking about none other\nthan dr nicole lapera nicole thank you\nso much for being here jay thank you for\nhaving me i've been knowing you and your\nwork so the fact that our paths have\ncrossed right now it's truly an honor\nfor me so thank you well i was so happy\nto see the success of your book and when\ni saw it come up i literally saw\neveryone posting about it and everyone\ntalking about it and i just loved how\nclearly you've been articulating your\nmessage so effectively on instagram all\nthe way through to the book and i'm so\njust happy and congratulations on on all\nthe amazing success it's fun to watch\nthank you it's wild even still to hear\nwhen it's when i am intro that i have a\nbook and this thing that obviously i\ndedicated so many hours of my life to\nit's still\nhard to believe in in a lot of ways even\njust the whole of this journey i would\nhave never imagined i think it was july\n2018 when i popped up my first instagram\nsquare i would have never anticipated i\nshould say kind of the journey that it's\nbeen though it is an honor and i'm\ngrateful for every moment of it well\nyou're helping people think about\npsychology in a completely different way\nand holistic psychology and\ncan you share with us when you say the\nwork\ndescribe to us what you define as the\nwork when you say how to do the work\nwhat is the work from your perspective\nyeah so the work actually you know my\nconcept of it really came out of the\ntraditional way that i had once been\nworking so coming through a system where\ni was trained as a clinical psychologist\ni had a practice i had the clients that\ncame in week after week\non my own side of the personal side of\nthings i struggled with anxiety i think\nnot a lot of us do\nwas in all of the different types of\ntreatment and what i saw several years\ninto my practice was the number one word\nthat comes to mind was a stuckness\nall of these humans myself include it\nthat had increasing amounts of insight\nright awareness oh i might even know\nwhere these patterns come from that no\nlonger serve me and i definitely might\neven have a plan of action to create\nchange to do something different the\nnext time so that i obviously don't have\nto live those consequences yet what i\nwould come to see and\nwith increasing amounts of frustration\nand even hopelessness is that inability\nto as i say bridge that gap so for me\nthe concept of the work the title of the\nbook really kind of illuminates the fact\nthat it does take numerous daily choices\nthat we begin to make each day and that\nthere of course is a reason why so many\nof us are stuck so from that really low\npoint i would go to kind of admit even\nfrom my own personal life and of course\nbeing the hired healer in the room the\nperson who's supposed to impart these\nindividuals with the tools it was quite\nlow i really understood one of the\nreasons why it's because we weren't\nworking what i now call holistically in\nthe field we really just kind of chopped\noff the mind you kind of intro by saying\nwe talked to these minds i was giggling\nbecause our minds are attached to a body\nand until we really understand that we\nare a whole person in my opinion a mind\nbody and soul so many of us are going to\ncontinue to remain stuck\nand so\nwhat actually brought you to extending\nthat out i think we're all grown up with\nspiritually we would call the bodily\nconcept of life like this you're\nengrossed in the bodily conception of\nlife\nwhen was it for you that you started to\nrealize that we were more than this body\nand that we were affected by more than\nwhat happens to us physically when was\nthat for you and how did that come about\nit was pretty much in real time with you\nknow my practice that that was there\nthat existed because on the personal\nside of things you know all of the tools\nthat i thought i had had\nweren't working and i also started to\nkind of have breakthrough symptoms for\nlack of a better word\nanxiety that was somewhat manageable was\ncoming back again feeling very\nunmanageable\nand i actually started to have some\nphysical symptoms i started to faint\ni had never had episodes of fainting\nstarted to forget my words mid-sentence\nlike beyond just i think the very\nnatural oh my my thoughts wandered it\nwas a scary feeling um so it actually\ncame in a moment of panic when like most\nof us do i went online um looking for\nwhat i was convinced at that point was\nprobably something wrong in my brain yet\nat that point i didn't have my why\nbecause when i revisited the\nfew memories of my childhood that i had\ni didn't have those big glaring moments\nthat i was taught in school might map on\nto memory issues or to the same symptoms\nthe peaks and anxiety that i was having\ni didn't have any explanation so i went\nonline like i said as many of us do i'm\nsearching for the medical thing that i\nwas going to find wrong in my brain and\ni actually was met with this whole new\nliterature um\nspecifically around epigenetics in\nparticular i'm coming again from a\nsystem where i was taught your genes\nwere it you had the genetics that you\nwere born with and you really had\nlimited ability to create change so for\nme hearing otherwise hearing that yes of\ncourse we're all born with genetic\ncomponents and then we have an\nenvironment\nwhich has multiple you know aspects of\nit the external events the people around\nus that really do impact those genes so\ni wouldn't say i believed in epigenetics\nat that point um it was an interesting\ntheory like i say it kind of just\nslightly opened the door that a very big\npart of me didn't feel\nwas my story okay this is great all of\nthese amazing stories i read oh these\nhumans create change come back from\nincurable illnesses i'm definitely gonna\nbe the person who that doesn't work for\nyet it at least opened the door of\npossibility and then of course it took\nmany daily small steps as i call them\ndaily's promises that i kept in my own\nlife to begin to find out how to utilize\nthe environment around us how to make\ndifferent choices and how to create\nchange so again i would lie if i said oh\nthat changed my world in one fell swoop\nand off i went absolutely not let me\nthink us humans we have to live the\nexperience to believe it however it\nbegan my journey because up until then i\nwas taught that that that door was\nclosed there was no possibility and for\nthose that are new to the idea of\nepigenetics can you break down for us\nuh what that is and\nhow that's something someone can start\nto work on sitting from the comfort\ntheir home yeah so epigenetics you know\ndoes highlight the fact that we are all\nborn and we have these inborn things\ngenetics that are passed on through\ngenerations however it's the choices\nwe're making how much sleep are we\ngetting how much stresses are in our\nenvironment more in particularly how\nmuch support do we have to deal with\nthis stress what are we eating are we\ngetting the nutrients and really the\nlist goes on and then an interaction\nbetween the genetic you know components\nof us and those choices\nthen we can start to see either symptoms\nwe get that diagnosis we get that\ndisease if you will or again here comes\nthe possibility that we don't so the\nchange begins\ni always say two parts to change the one\npart is awareness beginning to see from\na conscious mind i love how you all of\nyour work on presence i couldn't agree\nmore that it becomes the foundation for\nchange many of us have to just learn how\nto see ourselves day in and day out\nbecause most of us are living from our\nsubconscious we're living that autopilot\nwe're not even really aware we might\nthink we're getting more sleep than we\nare we might think we're eating in a\nmore healthy way than we are so\nconsciousness right creates that\nopportunity then to begin to make those\nnew choices so change in my opinion\ncomes when we become conscious and then\ngift ourselves with choice we make small\ninterventions we maybe try to sleep a\nbit more try to navigate our stress\ndifferently and then again we can\nmitigate those symptoms that many of us\nare feeling stuck in yeah so it really\nis this 360 degree view of life like\nyou've talked about everything from\nnutrition to sleep to the choices that\nwe make and you use this term in your\nbook you say like we are you're your own\nhealer this idea that you're the healer\nof yourself i think for a lot of us\nwe often look outwards for healing we\nhope that someone else will come and\nheal us we go to our doctors or we may\neven go to a guide and\ntell me about that the power in that\nstatement is so true but it's almost so\nhard to accept often i know sometimes\neven in myself\ni i'll get to the point i'm like oh i\njust want to come to come change my life\nright like we always have that feeling\nlike someone's going to come and find me\nand someone's going to come and change\nmy life and\nthat whether that's come from my\nchildhood or wherever it is\nhow do you empower yourself with the\nbelief truly that you are your own\nhealer and how do you really accept that\nwhat does it take to really\nembrace that statement as something real\nyeah and i would agree with you i mean\nthere were so many ways that i\noutsourced as i say\nmy inner knowing a lot of it is very\nconditioned we're taught to do that i\ncould even make a big global statement\nthat i think on the macro level a lot of\nus in society regardless of the culture\nyou come from are taught some level of\nthat externalization right whether you\nlook to your religious sect\nor your family or again the doctor\nthere is someone i think that many of us\nhave been taught from a very early age\nsometimes it's not even directly where\nwe're you know told this person knows\nbetter sometimes it's indirectly or\nseeing our parent figures our caregivers\noutsourcing their knowing to someone\nelse that then we begin to do the same\nthing and i was one of those people i\nmean one might even say i was trained in\nthe profession to be that outsourced\nguide for someone else and it never sat\nwell for a couple different reasons a it\ndid feel very you know it kind of\ncontinued to precipitate this\ndisempowerment this idea that someone\nelse knows better and it actually\nbrought up a question for me which is\nhow could someone else know better when\nthey didn't live our life they don't\nmake sense of things the way our minds\nmake sense of things\nand i learned very early on in my\ntraining that it is natural for us to\nassume to hear somewhat of a similarity\nbetween maybe my story and if you were\nto share with me your story and then to\nassume a much greater similarity oh you\nsaid anxiety i have that so i you must\nhave the exact same version i do yes and\ni learned very early on in my clinical\ntraining or i was it was suggested to me\nnot to do that because we could be using\nthe same words we could think we mean\nthe same things but there's so much\nindividual variation so now going back\nto this concept of this person outside\nof me who has that intimate awareness of\nme\nand or who's able to show up as me in\nthose given moments i mean now it gets\nreally silly logistically right no i'm\nme i need to navigate the next time that\nhappens so i need those tools um\npeeling it back you know i believe that\nthat sense of knowing that healer is the\nstate that we're all born into i do\nbelieve that we're a full you know whole\nbeing worthy even with our essence or\nthat thing that makes us us our purpose\nthat we can then live out into the world\nand then our conditioning happens and\nnow here comes in that young onion\nanalogy right all of the layers start to\nform around us and then we become an\nadult who isn't living from that pure\nstate and again who might have been\nconditioned to look outside of ourselves\nso for many of us it begins as a concept\ni'm sitting here telling you you know\nit's internal peel back for many of us\nit becomes when we take that first step\nthat begins a journey of many stems\nbecause change of course doesn't happen\nlike a light switch like i call it like\nmany of us want to right i flipped the\nswitch and now i'm different though the\nmore we empower ourselves through that\nconsciousness to create that change then\nwe can begin to embrace that reality\nthat we can be the healer that we can\nmake choices that honor our best\ninterests and then that\nkind of peel back those layers and bring\nus back to that state of wholeness so\nagain it begins as a theory as all\nthings do until you begin to empower\nyourself to create these changes in your\nlife yeah you mentioned self-awareness a\nfew times there and the idea of inner\nknowing and self-knowing i find that\nand and this is what you're speaking\nabout the the theory versus when it\nturns into reality but i find that\ndon't you think so many of us sometimes\nwe're like i know when i do that i know\nwhat i need to change and it's not even\nabout shifting into action it's like\nthere's this\nalmost\nit feels like an instinctive pull to do\nthe opposite right and it's so strong\nand from a spiritual point of view it's\nit's described as lust and not lust for\nthe\nfor someone you're attracted to not in\nsuch a gross way but lust in the sense\nof this\nunflinching\nreaction pendulum swing that's pulling\nyou away from where you truly want to be\ntell us what's happening there why is it\nthat we know that we need to eat this\nright healthy food but we are so\nattracted to the unhealthy food we know\nwe should be waking up earlier and\nsleeping earlier to get better quality\nsleep but we're not doing that what is\nthat pull that's kind of just holding us\nback almost it feels like someone's\nliterally grabbing us by the collar and\nand pulling us back absolutely and you\nuse the word in your description there\ninstinctive and i would go ahead and\nargue that it is it's outside of our\nawareness and it feels very alluring in\nall of the ways we might even have\nright really high feelings almost as if\nwe can't resist it we are rendered\nchoiceless yes yes that's it that's the\nyeah and that's real i mean you describe\nthe reality that many of us are living\nand that would describe that stuck place\nthat i was referencing earlier and like\ni said that in my opinion when we when\nwe continue to bear witness to oh here's\nthat old habit again and now i'm living\nthe consequences here they come again\nmany of us begin to feel shameful right\nwe might even have well-meaning loved\nones that are looking over our shoulder\nwondering you know why the hell we're\ncontinuing to do this also continuing to\nincrease our shame and some of us now\neven begin to entertain these ideas that\nmaybe i am broken maybe there is\nsomething just at my core that's\ncreating this and what is at all of our\ncore as humans is the desire to remain\nin the familiar\nright and so what happens and again our\nfamiliar all of the things that have\nhappened to us beginning at a very early\nstage have i like to talk about the\nbrain and kind of what actually happens\nbegins to lay down pathways quite\nliterally neurons right that fire\ntogether wire together so what happens\nis we have all of these very rote very\npatterned ways of being that many of us\nhave been rehearsing since since birth\nright we always do that same thing\nusually again this begins out of pain\nout of experiences where we've had to\nadapt right the things that we're doing\ncome from a certain place yes they might\nhave some long-term consequences but\nusually in the immediate we were\navoiding something some form of pain\nsome form of discomfort and or we were\nattempting to feel loved to feel\nconnected to our immediate family or the\npeople around us the people who were in\ncharge of meeting our needs however we\nrepeat and repeat and repeat and then\nthose pathways get really strong so then\nwe come say to you know we decide we\nwant to change we've lived these\nconsequences long enough we see some\nsort of helper or we read a book and we\nhave a new game plan of action\nnow we're again using a different part\nof our mind we're in that conscious part\nof our mind however that drive to that\nfamiliar is still there it lives in our\nsubconscious and it's very strong so\nwhat happens as i put is we meet that\nresistance either that overwhelming\nfeeling that drive that compulsion like\nyou described it some of us it just\nstays in our thinking mind all of the\nreasons why this isn't going to work\nit's so silly you should stop doing this\nbefore long if i listen to either of\nthose things the thoughts i'm thinking\nor the feelings i'm having that are new\nthat are unfamiliar before long i am\nback in those ruts and it's not because\ni feel good it's because i feel like i'm\nused to feeling and anything out of\nthose bounds can feel threatening a lot\nof our stuckness again is coming from\nthat drive to safety the reality that\nthe unfamiliar according to our\nsubconscious is threatening because we\ndon't actually know what comes next so\nthose patterns are what is safest\nkeeping us again stuck in those patterns\nyeah it's crazy how it works i mean i\nwas reading a\nyou know i've read the studies that say\nyou have 60 to 80 000 thoughts per day\n80 of them are negative and 80 of those\nare on repeat and it's the repeat part\nthat really makes me go wow we need to\ndrive a train\nthrough this\nor we need to somehow break this pattern\nbecause this pattern will just keep\nrepeating and keep cycling and keep\nstrengthening and so we need to slowly\nweaken the pattern i wanted to ask you\nthat\nis it that we slowly chip away\nand weaken the pattern or do we need\nsomething big\nlike a freight train to come drive\nthrough it which which one is it and is\nit both is it neither is it you know\nwhat's the process so the pathway to\nchange the kind of what happens can\nhappen you know a slow gradual descent\num has happened for me you know i\ngradually went across life i checked all\nthe boxes that i thought were going to\nmake me happy there wasn't a cataclysmic\nmoment when i was 28 or whenever this\nbegan that kind of initiated it it was\nslow and gradual some of us are\ninitiated into change when something\ncataclysmic happens we lose the\nrelationship we you know life does shift\nand change so both ways can be pathways\nin um the pathway through change i think\nis slow and gradual because what happens\nagain because we're always looking to\ncreate safety\noverwhelming change changing our life\nfrom top to bottom between now and\ntomorrow could send us right back into\nthat same adapted mechanism that we've\nlearned at one point to keep us safe now\nthis isn't to say that people listening\nhaven't had success changing lives from\ntop to bottom of course though when\nwe're working with the principles of the\nsubconscious our drive to stay in that\nfamiliar it's those gradual victories um\nbecause what we're looking to do is\ncreate the consistent habit like i was\nreferencing earlier there is no light\nswitch there's no making these new\nchoices you know here there maybe this\nweek maybe not next week we want to\nintegrate these new choices into our\nhabit into now what we do how we eat how\nmuch we sleep so consistency is key\nsmaller choices are much easier to\nmaintain consistently than five or ten\nnew things all at once yeah one of the\nthings i'm just thinking about this\nbecause it's been something i've been\ndoing recently so during my time as a\nmonk we did a lot of tough physical\nausterities and what i found through all\nof that is that my mind strengthened but\nmy body\ndecided not to want those physical\nausterities\nand and so i i for a while i just was\nlike nah i'm good yeah i'm good and then\nmore recently\ni've\nstarted well it was actually because one\nfriend forced me to do a cold plunge and\nthen do a do jump out of the plane and\ngo skydiving\nand so when i did that\ni was like\noh and and i did it because of this\nfriend i was like you know i want to do\nit with him it'll be fun and so when i\ndid it it broke through an old\ntrauma pattern an old barrier that was\nin my mind which was i don't like\nphysically difficult things anymore\nbecause i did so many\nand when i say so many i mean things\nlike we would sleep on cold stone floors\ncold floors we'd wake up often if we\nwere traveling in puddles this high like\nwe would uh you'd be sleeping in extreme\nhot and cold without even thinking about\nit you'd go days without eating like\nthere were a lot of things that we did\nthat were great for my mind but for my\nbody struggled\nand so\nnow i've started trying to do after i\nhad that breakthrough so i needed to do\nsomething as radical as that like\nskydiving to feel like i could go beyond\nthat physical discomfort\nand recently i got reintroduced to so\nwhat i found was i was like oh wow i had\na breakthrough\nand then four months have gone by and\nsomeone was like do you want to do a\ncold plunge and i was like no way and\nall of a sudden i was back to that old\npattern\nand i went again and i broke it and then\nnow i've been going every week and not\nonly am i spending longer in the cold\ni'm feeling more comfortable in it i'm\ngetting i'm understanding how i can use\nmy breath work and meditation in the\ncold\nand and what's been fascinating for me\nis i'm like i want to go every week on\npurpose\nbecause if i go every week then that's\nno longer a fear anymore and i see every\nweek that my time gets longer my breath\ngets better i'm able to heat my body by\nbreathing because of my breath work i'm\nstarting to see the power of my mind and\nmy breath work over my body uh in those\nscenarios so i i what i'm saying is i\ncan relate to what you're saying and\nthat's been something very real for me\nin the last few months that i've been\nworking through but you talk a lot about\nthese old deep-rooted traumas and how\nthey block us how do we uncover the root\nof a trauma i find like so often we're\ndealing with the branches or the leaves\nor the you know the fruits of a trauma\nthe negative fruits the poisonous fruits\nhow do you figure out what the root of a\ntrauma is yeah really good question i\nwas giggling when you were sharing all\nof that because i very much my body i\nrun yeah i did not have all of that\ntraining and doing difficult things so i\nwas an athlete and still and i share\nthis often within my community that\nfirst thought when i go on that hike\nthat the elevation right starts right\nfrom the beginning i'm not even 20 steps\nin i'm like maybe i don't really want to\nbe hiking today and right just for me in\nthat moment identifying that's the old\nvoice and i can gift myself with choice\nright i can choose to say you know what\nmy body is fatigued right now and i will\nlisten to it or i can identify it as\nbeing you know that old voice so\ngetting to a root of trauma speaking of\nvoices a lot of the voices we are\nhearing like you said those negative\nvoices in our head um the very patterned\nones the habitual ones i call them\nthey're them those are stories they can\nbe a big indicator of the root of trauma\nin a sense so to be clear because i am\nasked often like do we have to know\nright so the gist of this question is is\nthere an uncovering do we have to go\nback to that moment or those many\nmoments that began this trauma and i'm\noften asked because when i share my\nstory\npart of it includes a large absence of\nthose early memories of really memories\nup until the more recent past for me so\nreviewing my childhood for me in that\nkind of movie screened way to find the\nroot is quite difficult right because i\ndon't have those so you know the natural\nquestion that follows is if i can't find\nthe exact root can i heal it so while\ni'll say those stories are helpful those\npatterns those reactions that we have\nthose activating moments they can all\ngive us clues\nto actually have the particular moment\nin all of its details is in my opinion\nnot\npossible for some of us and not\nnecessarily fully necessary for others\nbecause what we can work with is the\npattern we're stuck in because it\ncontains it right the book the body\nkeeps the score was one of the first\nright offerings of this idea this\nconcept that our body is remembering so\neven if my mind right can't put on that\nmovie and say oh that's where it began\nto happen\nmy body is reenacting it in a moment\nthat's similar to that moment so our\nstart point can be what are those\npatterns right if i can drop into my\nmind first becoming aware of how busy it\nis how much how many many thoughts are\nrunning through it and then i can begin\nto watch and most of us will begin to\nsee the story the story that we've made\nof us the story that we've made of our\nrelationships our path in life whatever\nit might be the patterns is where we\nwant to begin our exploration and again\nwe can just start with where are we\nstuck right what happens when i feel a\nreally big emotion that's a great place\nto begin looking oftentimes that's\nsomething interpersonal right that\nhappens in our relationships when i\nstart to feel something really big and\nthen we can drop in okay what is the\nstory i've told myself about this really\nbig thing\nwhat am i doing right to create safety\nin this moment and then of course can i\nbegin to make new choices so to get to\nthe root we can start where we are and\nwe can start in those very patterned\nways the things that we can see\nourselves day in and day out once we're\nwatching with consciousness where we're\nbecoming stuck that can be our entry\npoint for the work got it that makes a\nlot of sense thank you for clarifying\nthat i think that's such a great\ndistinction between the root and the\npattern\nand the recognition that you don't need\nto do that\nif you can't and it's it's not possible\nand that's not going to stop you from\nhealing which i think is going to be\nso good for so many people to hear\nbecause i think you can almost get lost\nin the trap of like yes where did this\nstart where was that moment was it this\nwas that and that can just debilitate\nyou even more i guess and ultimately the\nknowing of the story still remains in\nour thinking mind right i can go back\nand maybe even just tell the story as\nsometimes our therapy does it offers\nlike this continuous\ntelling of my story but again kind of\nbringing this whole conversation full\ncircle until i learn how to embody a new\nresponse in that moment my story remains\nin my mind right so even on earthing the\ncause of it won't shift then how my body\nreacts in that moment won't allow me to\nthen integrate a new feeling or make a\nnew choice so that i can actually create\nchange got it that makes sense what are\nsome of the\npractices and methods that you've\nused learned ones that you've shared\nwith people practical things that people\ncan do that you think have really moved\nthe needle for people in this regard\nwhether that's awareness of a trauma\nwhether that's starting the healing\nprocess what have been some of your\nfavorite ones i'm intrigued yeah so i\nthink the most impactful one is the one\nthat keeps coming up with that idea of\nconsciousness um first being becoming\naware of how unconscious\nmany of us are living by now we've all\nheard the word autopilot we all know\nthat upwards of 90 of our day we're in\nit um it becomes really impactful when\nyou actually see it right when you see\nyourself no sooner opening your eyes and\nshifting right into that same thing you\ndo first thing every morning right being\nable to bear witness from the conscious\nmind creates in my opinion the greatest\nimpact because what most of us see is\nhow unconscious we are how we're not\neven giving ourselves the opportunity to\nmake a new choice because we're not\nthere we're not in the present moment\nwe're not able to shift our attention\nfrom wherever else it might be\nfor many of us it's lost in our thinking\nmind ruminating about the fight this\nmorning worrying about tomorrow um if\nyou're like me you might just be\nsomewhere else i call it my spaceship i\njust know i'm not here um so for many of\nus building those choices in throughout\nthe day um suggestions i often give\nbecause we all walk around with a phone\nset an alarm for random times throughout\nyour waking day right so you don't even\nremember that you set an alarm at 1 30\nyour phone's buzzing why is it buzzing\nthis is for your consciousness check-in\nthe first thing we can do is note where\nwhat were you paying attention to were\nyou really immersed in what you were\ndoing or who you were talking to chances\nare probably not yeah you were somewhere\nelse right now this gives you the first\nopportunity to use either another tool\nyou've already spoken of your breath\nright to use that to focus your\nattention on your active breathing or if\nyou're doing something somatic maybe\nyou're eating maybe turn your attention\nto actually tasting the meal in front of\nyou that you're otherwise shoveling down\nthe more we create more moments of that\nconsciousness of a the awareness of\nwhere is my attention and then be that\ncontrol the more now we're becoming\npresent to what is and now we can really\nindividualize the work that we're doing\nif i become present to a hyperactive\nbody so for me this was the commonplace\nonce i landed my spaceship i realized\nhow stressed out my body was my heart\nrate was always elevated a bit i had a\nbit of shallow breathing right so now i\ncan maybe use breath work i can\nintentionally change the flow of my\nbreath and actually create a new feeling\nin my body so for many of us again it\nbegins with choice and within that\nchoice we can begin to reconnect for for\nso many of us the what happens next\ncomes from what your body is telling you\nright what is your body feeling are you\nfeeling expansive and excited\nbased on what you're doing or aren't are\nyou feeling constricted and scared and\nif you're feeling the latter can you\ncreate a change can you breathe\ndifferently can you meet a need maybe\nyou're hungry once you tune in you can\ngo get a snack can you feed your body\ncan you tend to your body when we're\nconscious we can hear our body and our\nbody has a lot of wisdom that so many of\nus aren't paying attention to for many\ngood reasons because being in our body\nwas a fearful place a scary place we\nmight have been an abused when we were\nwithin our bodies though again building\nthat bridge creating that reconnection\ncan help us then figure out because i'm\nsure listeners like great i'm in my body\nwhat next um the clues are there the\nmore we again peel back that onion and\nlearn how to listen i love what you said\nabout creating a new feeling in our\nbodies\nbecause i think that\nthat's really what we struggle with we\nthink feelings come from how people\ntreat us\nor where we visit or the place we just\nwent to\nbut feelings are created and monitored\nalso by us and again it comes back to\nthe point about choice but the idea that\ni i say this all the time like before i\ngo on stage i haven't done it for so\nlong and i miss it but whenever i go on\nstage i still get nervous\nand i've been public speaking since i\nwas 11 years old and have done it\nreligiously and i will still get nervous\nand i have learned to realize that that\nshows i care and so i feel good about\nthat so now when i feel that nervousness\ni'm not feeling nervousness i'm feeling\ncare and compassion i'm thinking i care\nabout my audience i care about how i'm\ngoing to serve today i care about my\nconnection with them today so that is\nwhy i'm feeling this way and then\nusually using breath work i'll change my\nheart rate and the way it's feeling and\nthat\ncreates a feeling as opposed to\naccepting the signal feeling that i'm\nreceiving which is nerves anxiety or\nwhatever it may be of course it becomes\nharder when it's been so repeated and\nthat's what we've been breaking down\ni want to know when you when you talk\nabout\nholistic i want to hear more about the\nspiritual soul side of your work\nand where you've found that integration\nbetween that and science and the deep\nresearch that you've done over the years\ni'm intrigued to find what are some of\nthe parallels or what are some of your\nown personal spiritual quests or\ncuriosities that you might be on right\nnow\nthat you could possibly share with us\nyeah absolutely and i appreciate you\nasking um because that is the third\ncomponent right so we've mined we've\ntalked about body and i do believe that\nthere's a soul a spiritual entity\nwhether we want to call it that or\nessence\nthat makes us us and i'm speaking this\nfrom a die-hard scientist that if you\nwould have asked me about a decade ago\nif anything religious based anything\nspirituality based i would have turned a\nblind eye to it i wouldn't have believed\nin it\nbecause again it wasn't at that point to\nmy knowledge at least mapped on in the\nscience of knowing um so again this\nwasn't something for me that was an\nalways part of my journey this was\nsomething i've come to discover um and\nwhat i've come to discover in the\nsimplest way that i describe what soul\nor spirit is to me\nis the uniqueness that makes each of us\ndifferent\nright there's something in me that's\ngoing to give me the life experience the\npersonality that the meanness that's\ndifferent from you\nand at this point whether we agree on\nthat it's coming from a spiritual place\nor a soul-based place or whether it just\nis an essence and is thing i think many\nof us in the collective are beginning to\nhonor that there is something else a\ndeeper sense of knowing scientifically\nwhere i believe this inner knowing maps\nonto is a major organ that gets very\nlittle um you know kind of time in the\nspotlight or at least is getting more so\nthese days is not our brain at all it\ncomes from our heart\nagain that whole place that i keep\nreferring to i believe it's when we're\nfully connected to our heart space\nwe now know that our heart has an\nincredibly strong electromagnetic field\nit's sensing the world around me it's\nsending out signals to the world around\nme even beyond the magnetic field that\nmy brain entails so our heart the the\nmeanness i believe is contained in that\nscientific space um very grateful for\nthe heart math institute whose major\ngoal is to put out this type of research\nbut again i think it's peeling back the\nlayers understanding that there is a\nsteeper place of knowing that is\ninteracting with our general way of\nbeing whether aware of it or not\neveryone wants to know where's my\nintuition where's my purpose right for\nfor this conversation and again i\nbelieve that comes from that heart space\nso many of us though or disconnected\nfrom it or have grown distrustful of it\nthat we don't look to it to listen so\nbeing holistic again means honoring that\nthere there is something deeper there is\na place in me not in someone else that\nknows what my path and my journey is and\nagain it's cultivating that connection\nand beginning to listen and then of\ncourse walking forth in that truth\nregardless of what the world around me\nis doing or saying about it which is a\nwhole other you know kind of aspect of\ndoing and living in the work that i\nthink many of us are up against these\ndays yeah absolutely thank you so much\nfor sharing that too and i love i love\nhearing\ni think for so many years there were\nwhen you look at some of the most\nphenomenal scientists of all time like\nwhether it's einstein or you know others\nwho've been able to bring together\nspirituality and science so wonderfully\nand i always love hearing that kind of\nintegration and integrated approach\nbecause i do think we need both\nto have a healthy and powerful and\ninsightful conversation about how we\nfeel\ni love what you're sharing about the\nheart how do people start to notice the\ndifference\nin the voices in their head between\ntheir heart\ntheir mind their ego stories like is\nthere a way have you found a way have\nyou come across something that has\nhelped you notice the difference between\nwhen your heart is involved in a\nconversation yeah and i think so again\nfirst is the practice of looking and i'm\nsaying that very intentionally because i\ndon't think for many different reasons\none of which being intimidation we don't\nlook inward we don't take a moment to\nturn off the now endless distractions of\nour external world and even give\nourselves the opportunity to begin to\ndifferentiate those voices we're always\nstimulated externally or in our thinking\nmind right so for some of us even\nsuggesting right turning it off even\nbefore you go to bed and not bringing\nyour phone in and just giving yourself a\nmoment of quiet when we can turn inward\nfor many of us oh it's too close to\nmeditation and it's too scary in there\nand i don't want to so for a lot of us\nit's just beginning to practice you know\nwalking through that discomfort so that\ni can begin to drop in and listen\nto more specifically answer the question\nour heart talks not in erratic it\ndoesn't knock us over the head right and\nsomething that feels overwhelming\nit's kind of there and it's just like a\nsofter though still\nunderstandable and hearable message\nanything that feels frenetic anything\nthat feels repetitive right our hearts\nnot gonna on repeat tell us the same\nthing like our monkey mind is right so\nour heart is gonna be that just like\nkind of behind their slow urge\nthat's not going to feel i think the\nspike of energy that many of us are used\nto or again the repetitiveness that many\nof us are used to hearing in our\nthinking mind and all of this becomes\nclearer when we begin to spend time\ninward right when you begin to notice\nthe nature of your thought whoever's\nlistening and how your thoughts kind of\nare reiterative and are very kind of\namplified in some ways and then learning\nwhat it's not sometimes can lead us on\nthe road to what it is yes that that\nmakes a lot of sense i like that and and\nyou're so right it does take that\nlike i know that i the way i try and do\nit is for a long long time and i've\nprobably mentioned this a couple of\ntimes but\ni'll write down every choice i have or\nevery\nopportunity i have in front of me when\ni'm trying to make a decision for\nexample\nand i'll write above it\nthe word of where i think that's coming\nfrom\nso\nit could be like ego like i'm make i\nwould choose that because\nit would be good for my ego like my ego\nwill feel good or i would choose that\nbecause\nit will make me money and that would be\nthe reason so wealth or money would be\nabove it and then i'm like oh i would\nchoose that because i love it like i\nwould choose to do that because i love\nit i choose to do that because whatever\nand i found that that's really helped me\nbe really clear about looking at\nlooking at like what is what would make\nme choose that like what would be my\nreason for choosing that option\nopportunity job\nitem of work whatever it may be\nand then even if i accept it because all\nit is is money or\nego i'm well aware now\nthat this is probably not going to make\nme happy but it's going to get me this\nthing that i think i'm doing it for and\nthat very honest transparent feel\nallows me to be at ease and honest about\nmy choices and also deal with the\nrepercussions of them when things don't\nwork out or whatever it may be\nor even when you do what you love and it\ndoesn't work out you know you did it\nbecause you loved it and and that's all\nyou wanted from it and so i think that's\nbeen a really good way for me at least\nto\ndistinguish between whether it's my\nheart my head my gut i love that and\nwhat's important that you're you're\nreferencing too or you're acknowledging\nor honoring is the honest\npiece of it and i say that you know in a\nvery intentional way again because\nthat's hard it's hard for us to peel\nback our own onion and to look at our\nhonest truths and to to to label it and\nbe with it for what it is so many of us\nbegin to contort things and you know out\nof shame out of again perhaps many\nmoments where we did share truths in\ndifferent ways and they weren't received\nand or we were you know made to feel\nvery badly about them so you know in the\nwork i talk about i think a lot and i\nyou know attempt to practice at all\nareas that self-honesty first um being\nhonest with what it is for me in any\ngiven moment or what it isn't just being\nhonest before then we can even gift that\nhonesty to someone else because a lot of\nentry points to the work\nis i'm not feeling satisfied\nin life in my relationships in\nparticular i don't feel meaningfully\nconnected to others or the world around\nme help right and we want to or many of\nus the pathway in or so we think is to\nchange the world around us right find\nthat meaningful person find that\nmeaningful purpose maybe even or that\npath and again that only comes when\nwe're first honest when we figure out\nwhat our honest truth is gift ourself\nwith that live into that\nand then we begin to\nhave the opportunity to live honestly\nthen in the world and then of course\neverything begins to shift because\nwhatever it is that we're experiencing\nis authentic to us yeah i find there\nisn't isn't partly our\nour rejection of self-honesty or the\ntimes we avoid being honest that's part\nof our story's defense mechanism right\nbecause if you're really truly honest\nwith yourself\nyou might have to change something\nand we don't want to and so the mind or\nyou know\nand that's why i'm asking you where is\nit coming from that desire to be like\nwell i i'm not going to be honest to\nmyself because then that breaks my story\nthat i've been telling myself so if i've\nbeen telling myself the story i'm a good\nperson\nand that helps me function in the world\nnow that i've made a mistake if i accept\nthat mistake then maybe that's gonna\nbreak me\ndoes that make sense yeah and and so\nhow do we kind of\nnurture this idea of self-awareness and\nself-honesty without feeling it's going\nto lead to self-destruction i think a\nlot of people at work even in our\nrelationships it's like if i've always\nbeen the person on time if i'm late\ntoday i don't want to tell people i'm\nlate because it's going to destroy what\ni've\nlived to built up right if that makes\nsense and i think\ni i think about it in a very real way\nwhere you know i look at the life i've\nlived and it's so like polar opposite\nand random and paradoxical and\nbut i'm like i'm so happy with\ngetting to express all parts of myself\ntoday that are in love with media and\nthat i i am a monk you were just sharing\nearlier today that you know you're like\ni'm a rust fan like a lizard of russ's\nmusic but i'm a holistic psychologist\nand it's like i think the fun is in the\nparadoxes of people\nand actually i i would suggest that i\nthink if everyone looked at themselves\nthey'd find that they were paradoxical\nand the paradox is what we're scared to\naccept because it doesn't clearly define\nwho you are and so it was easier for me\nto be a monk than who i am today where\ni'm like yeah i think like a monk but i\ndon't live like one\ni adopt the practices of monks but i'm a\nmarried man i'm an entrepreneur and i\nenjoy all parts of that and i'm learning\nto allow myself to accept all parts of\nmyself\nuh but but i i wonder why we're so\nscared of the paradoxes and how we can\nopen ourselves up to actually realize\nthe paradox has so much joy and\npotential in it does that and you can\ndisagree with me too i was smiling\nreally big because it's i mean it's\nbeautiful and what you're describing is\nhow i describe the ego we all have this\nstory of ourself that was formed at you\nknow began its formation in childhood\nbased on very real lived experiences and\nthe feelings that we've had about them\nthough it's a very contained it's only a\nstory about an aspect or a part of who\nwe are however it drops into our\nsubconscious anything that goes against\nit feels threatening feels scary\nactually shakes my core sense of self i\ndon't know who i am\nand to others right and so we then live\nour life in defense of that story though\nfor many of us that story like i said is\nis so small it might not even apply to\nthe current situation or the current\nchoices that we're making day in and day\nout so the goal really is to expand is\nto allow in right through honesty\nthrough witnessing all aspects of\nourself because we all have all of those\naspects of ourself and the way it mainly\ncomes out is when we see an aspect of\nourself in someone else and then we\ndon't feel negatively about ourself\nbecause we deny that that's even in\nthere and then we project all of that\nnegativity onto that person so that's\noftentimes where i offer is a great\npoint of exploration and i'll share one\nwith you all\nfor a very long time watching people\ndance on the glorious thing that is\nsocial media would make my blood boil\nwatching a human just let loose you know\nvery kind of in self-expression moving\ntheir body my ego would say all sorts of\nthings because at that point i didn't\nidentify as a dancer i'm definitely not\nsomeone who moves my body not\ncomfortably and for sure not in public\nright meanwhile i made it about this\nperson that i don't know and their\nintention for dancing that i could never\nknow come to know right that my wounding\nmy\nnot feeling comfortable in my body again\nbegan very early on in childhood so i\nwouldn't dare to be that person that\ndanced in public yet i felt so strongly\nnegative of others who did of course for\nme that was a pathway in to begin to\nexplore this story that i've now began\nto unpack that's a great place to look\ngreat when are you feeling so negatively\nabout someone else might be at that\nplace of shadow or that part of you\nthat you're not willing or able to be\nhonest and again we do so out of fear\nout of felt threat or protection of what\nif the world does see this side of me or\nwhat if i do allow this side of me to be\nalive right now and again honoring that\nfear that once was because according at\nleast to the way i framed the work it\ndid come at a time in a place that was\nadaptive however now we can begin to\ncreate change and embrace all of us all\nparts of us that makes a lot of sense\nand i'm glad that we're i'm glad that\nwe're aligned on that and uh you were\nsmiling as i was speaking i was like oh\nyes someone understands it\ntell me about\nhow do we stop letting other people's\nopinions define our choices because you\nwere just talking about that right now\nas well the idea that\nyou know like you\nwere maybe you're scared of putting\nyourself out there and now we're judging\nothers of why they put themselves out\nthere how do we stop letting other\npeople's opinions define our choices\nyeah really difficult i first want to\nhonor how for many of us that is part of\nour conditioning for all of the reasons\nbecause we had to right put other people\nin front of us or so we thought at some\ntime um a lot of it is kind of\nculturally driven um and again\nit becomes our conditioning it becomes\nwhat we do and then we fear right kind\nof doing our own thing we feel being\njudged we fear being misunderstood we\nfear all of the things associated with\nliving in truth that might differ\nfrom the world around us um and again\nthere's no hack way\nexcept to practice right to get so\nconnected to your truth that it doesn't\nmean that it won't feel painful or\ndiscouraging when someone maybe\nmisinterprets or doesn't view you the\nway you imagine yourself to be in any\ngiven moment though it also doesn't mean\nthat you have to take their opinion or\ntheir perception over your own right\nthere's always that space i call a kind\nof you know hearing and taking in the\nfeedback\nbecause feedback can be helpful um\nfeedback from someone who's not me\noffers me the the distance that i might\nnot be able to see the objectivity that\nsometimes comes with the distance and\nmaybe the cold hard truth that sometimes\ncomes within that objectivity that can\nhelp me however only if i so choose so i\nalways kind of describe a process of\nhearing right the feedback and then\ntaking it and then deciding for yourself\nright trying on for psy seeing if it\nmaybe you would like it to not apply and\nmaybe it does though not just taking it\nbecause someone else told you to or\nsomeone else is perceiving you in that\nway it really is up to us see hear what\nsomeone's saying and now observe for\nyourself do you\ndo that same that thing that they're\nsaying you're doing that you know in\nthat moment you are the one who gets to\nchoose and especially of course for\nthose of us who are living on social\nmedia with many different eyes of many\ndifferent people at different distances\nfrom us\nthe feedback can can be there it can be\noverwhelming\nand can it can be very misunderstanding\num though when you have that confidence\nwhen you know right that you're aligned\ninternally and when you do see all the\nmoments if we're honest that you are\nmisinterpreting other people you can\nmake space i think for other people\ndoing that for you yeah yeah yeah that\ni love that that's what i found it's\nlike i almost find\nwhen i can't be when i'm judgmental of\nothers like you were saying about the\ndances etc the idea of when i'm being\ncritical or judgmental of someone even\nif not verbally or externally but\nmentally\ni find that i usually am critical and\njudgmental of myself for the same\nreasons and when i can't give grace to\nmyself when i can't be compassionate to\nsomeone else i can't be compassionate to\nmyself when i can't be compassionate to\nmyself i can't be compassionate to\nothers\nand that's just been such a\nit's such a difficult thing to play with\nbut when you kind of have that light\nbulb moment it becomes so clear it's\nlike oh wait a minute how would i want\nto be perceived if i'd just gotten\nthrough that whether it was a divorce\nwhether it was a breakup whether it was\na a failure or a mistake externally it's\nlike\nhow if i\ni've made mistakes we've all made\nmistakes like how would i want someone\nto deal with me and how would i be\nfeeling and i think that\nhow do we start to empathize with people\nwe don't know\nand people who we think are very\ndifferent from us because i think we\nit's easy to be compassionate and\nempathize with the obvious i someone\ndoesn't have\nfood or a home you can you can offer\nsome compassion and love\nuh someone has anxiety just like you do\nyou can offer some compassion and love\nbut when you see someone else who's got\na different struggle\nand a different challenge we actually\nreally struggle as humans\nto have empathy how do we start creating\nempathy for people that we can't relate\nto or or don't agree with sometimes yeah\nso i think you know i\nsometimes talk in universal sometimes\ntry to avoid it this is one universal\nthat i do believe very strongly in um\nregardless of the very distinct\ndifferences that meant you know our\nessence we are all different i believe\nat our core\nwe share you know three very you know\nhuman needs\nto be seen\nto be heard and to be loved and i\nbelieve that unifies all of us and most\nthings that we're doing outwardly that\nmight be the cause of that negative i\ndon't love using the words positive and\nnegative but that less than savory\nreaction\nright are oftentimes the outward attempt\nof that human at getting one of those\ncore needs met in that moment so the way\nthat we can unify the collective as i\nthink the work is um the final chapter\nin the book\nis called interdependence this idea of\ncoming back into right as our\nauthentically honored selves now into\nthe collective\ni believe we're social creatures all of\nus humans regardless if you come from a\nself-identified collectivist culture or\nnot we are humans in relationship um and\nagain like i said we're not all showing\nup authentically and honoring ourselves\nin this relationship though we are in\nthat connectivity and at our core again\nlike i said we want that group cohesion\nwe want to be seen and honored and loved\nand again many of us have all these\ndifferent adaptations and ways we go\nabout it\nbut i think that can be one of the ways\nthat we honor the humanity in each of us\nis that our\nlit life is our best attempt you know\ngiven all of the past circumstances at\ngetting those core needs met so even if\nwhat you're seeing is unsavory in your\nopinion or in your experience\nwe can understand it i think through\nthat lens now of course it doesn't mean\nright opening the door to abuse showing\nup when our boundaries have been crossed\nit still is creating safety to continue\nto get our needs met which sometimes\ndoes mean outside of that relationship\nwith that possibly unsavory person at\nthis time\nthough again we can create the empathy\nby focusing on this similarity yeah i\nlove that thank you so much\ndr nicole it's been so talk so amazing\ntalking to you i'm wondering if there's\nsomething i haven't asked you or\nsomething that's in your heart right now\nthat you feel everyone needs to hear\nthat you want to share that maybe even\nsomething you've been reflecting on\nlately would there be a message that you\nthink everyone needs to hear and\nexperience i think the message that i am\nalways offering to share first is\nhonoring you know all the listeners out\nthere the curiosity the maybe connection\nto your work but just showing up i think\nwe diminish all of the things that we do\ndo for ourselves each and every day or\nwe write them off as not enough so the\nfirst thing i want to offer is that\nhonoring of\nthe small choices that you are already\nmaking in your life and again honoring\nthe moment that you're living in your\nlife because you're there your journey\nhas brought you there for a reason maybe\nit's not a moment you want to stay in\nthough within that moment like we've\nbeen talking about this whole episode\nallows us to to begin to make those new\nchoices so anyone listening can start\nright where they're at right there's no\nprerequisite for healing for changing\nfor doing the work this moment might be\nthe moment you become present the moment\nyou develop that consciousness and then\nbuild together those moments and i'm\nhere to share still on my journey not\ndone i don't believe there is that dumb\nplace\num though i'm not where i once was and\ni'm excited now to see into that unknown\nthat which was once scary and to be\navoidable i'm curious i'm curious to see\nwhere my journey goes yeah i love that\nthank you so much for sharing that i\nthink that that message on honoring is\njust so powerful you know we we can get\nnine things right that week and we'll\nfocus on that one thing we got wrong and\nmake it huge and make it feel like nine\nthings we got wrong and so i love that i\nwant to to honor our audience uh as\nnicole's suggesting honor each and every\none of you in our community and family\nfor showing up and being here and\nlistening every single week so thank you\nso much uh nicole we end every episode\nwith the final five as you know uh the\nfast five so i'm going to ask you five\nquestions that need to be answered in\none word to one sentence maximum right i\nbelieve a sentence is roughly seven\nwords maybe i don't know i just made\nthat up uh so are you ready for your\nphone i'm ready and i will attempt i am\nwordy so i will attempt to keep it short\namazing all right question number one\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived um not to assume\ngood i like that advice what's the worst\nadvice you've ever received\nworst advice i ever received is that\nconsciousness or being present\nmindfulness isn't important\nwow\nadvisor in my when i was trying to do my\ndissertation involving mindfulness i was\nactually told that verbatim i knew that\nthere was something suspect about that\nkind of advice where did that come from\nfor them i'm intrigued and you don't\nhave to go into if you don't want to um\ni believe it came from a mindset of\nlike genetics that was it um you know\nyou had this\nchip and there was nothing else that was\ngoing to override that um kind of\nsquashing the\npower of consciousness that i was\nstarting to kind of wonder and it took\nme many years to be able to utilize that\ni would be lying if i said oh i tucked\nit in my belt and just became conscious\nnonetheless and\ncontinued to change and i didn't um\nagain it took me years to action on that\npractice though that was told to me and\ni'm happy i did not listen of course\namazing all right question of i i made\nyou extend that answer so you're doing\nthat's not my fault yeah that is not\nyour fault i'm taking this yeah that was\nmy i was like\nuh question number three\nhow would you define your current\npurpose\nhow would i define my current purpose um\nliving heart centered i think that's\nwhere i am at on my journey and it also\nis informing a lot of the teaching and\nthe work that i am and will continue to\nbe putting out beautiful question number\nfour uh what's the first thing you try\nand do in the morning and the last thing\nyou do at night first thing i try and do\nis not look at my phone\nand take a moment for me um i say try\nbecause there are moments where i don't\nand the last thing i do at night is\nsame thing i don't bring just be\ninternal yeah love that all right fifth\nand final question if you could create\none law that everyone in the world had\nto follow what would it be\nliving from the heart connect with the\nheart i don't know how to law that but\nthe law would be the heart is important\nmake friends with it\ni love it dr nicole
