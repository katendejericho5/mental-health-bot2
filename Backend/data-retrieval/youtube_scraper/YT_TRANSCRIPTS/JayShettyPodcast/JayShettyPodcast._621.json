so much for making the time i know\nyou have a busy schedule but i'm glad\nwe're getting to do this yeah no i'm\nexcited i'm so excited to be on your\nshow so thank you for having me yeah\nabsolutely i mean i i meant what i said\nwhen i was just sharing that as i've\nbeen reading your book i was learning\nthings about you that i did not know\nand i couldn't put it down because\nthe way you deeply describe some truly\nlife-changing moments\ni think it's going to impact so many\npeople in the world so i thanked you\noffline but i want to say online as well\nthat thank you for writing this book as\na service\nbecause i think it's going to move and\nmake a difference in the lives of so\nmany people i i want to start off by\nsomething you talk about in the first\nchapter we're going to dive straight in\nuh you start off by talking about how\nthe question changed from\nwhen are you going to have kids to why\ndon't you get a surrogate right like\nthis question changes in your life tell\nus about the transition of experiencing\nwhat it felt like when you were\nstruggling to have children and then\nhaving the question change and it still\ndoesn't make you feel better instantly\nand it doesn't improve tell us about\nthat experience from your perspective\nyeah well well first i think when it\ncomes to women's reproductive health\num\nit you don't most people don't um they\nknock at the door and they don't wait\nfor anyone to answer they just come on\nin your house they're looking through\nyour cabinets they're under your you\nknow you're under your bed they feel\ncompletely entitled\nto\nyour truth whatever that may be\num\nso i never really had the luxury of\nnot\nsharing certain things um because if i\ndidn't share it you know they would turn\nan ivf cycle\ninto a pregnancy and they would report\non me being pregnant um\nand it was just it was like you know me\nchasing my tail so i just got to the\npoint where i'm just going to be as\ntransparent about you know as much of\nthis as i can\num\nbut people feel very comfortable\nyou know asking you is it like whether\nyou're married not married if you're\nwith a guy\num that people or or if you're coupled\npeople feel like the next and only step\nis you better forgive us i'm very big\nand that baby better be awesome and have\nthe cure for cancer like it there is no\nmight you do anything else\num the world is very suspicious of women\nwho\ndon't\nhave children for they don't even care\nwhat the reason is you don't have kids\nthey assume the worst about you you are\nthe scum of the earth what woman\nwouldn't want to have kids\num so so much of this process for so\nmany people is just fraught with\na lot of pain and a lot of um entitled\nbehavior on the part of those around us\nso\nimmediately as soon as you know i had\nbeen with dee before we were even\nmarried it was so when are you guys\ngonna have a kid when are you guys gonna\nhave a kid and for me um as someone you\nknow we'd both already been married\nbefore i i wanted to\nyou know wait until we were in a better\nplace in our relationship\num but no one wanted to to to be patient\nit was a constant barrage win win win\nyou better give us this freaking baby\num\nand then i started feeling not only the\npressure i was putting on myself and my\nbody and starting to feel very defective\nand feeling like\ni was unworthy of motherhood unworthy of\na baby babies were rejecting me\num\nyou know all of those feelings that take\nus right back to childhood of you know\nof um you know wild insecurities um\nbeing very concerned about what everyone\nis thinking um and and making decisions\nbased on outside noise right\num so by the time i had gone through\nyears of of ivf cycles and\nconstant miscarriages that i that i\ntalked about in the first book um\ni was just kept ready to keep going\nlet's try another cycle whatever\nwhatever it takes so by the time i met\ndr kelly beck um who's based in los\nangeles and\nshe is a fertility specialist but she's\nnot a one-size-fits-all fertility doctor\nlike\nsome\num a lot of doctors are very\nconcerned about their success rates and\nlive bursts and they don't they're not\nreally that concerned about\nfinding the why\nof your infertility it's just i'm gonna\nget you a baby and i don't care how it\nhappens right um\nand with kelly with dr kelly beck she\nwas like\nwell let's figure out what's wrong first\nand then we can make a an educated plan\nthat's based and tailored to you and i\nwas like what is this you speak of\nbecause i had been to literally every\nleading fertility doctor in the country\nand so\nfirst examination she was like oh\nyou have adenomyosis and everyone\npronounces that differently so if you\npronounce i don't know meiosis\ndifferently all good we're saying the\nsame thing\nit's\nendometriosis of the muscle\nso as an embryo is trying to implant\nthe um the adenomyosis grows around it\nand it will snuff it out like\nlike a blob\nso\ndr beck was like okay these are your\noptions um\nyou can either go with a gestational\ncarrier aka a surrogate or we can start\nyou on lupron but with lupron it puts\nyour body into early menopause which\nwould quiet the adenomyosis we would\nimplant an embryo and hope hope that it\nwould grow faster than the adenomyosis\nreturned and that was the first time\nyou'd heard that yeah 30 is a whole lot\nmore than zero which is what i was\nbatting but the idea of a surrogate just\nfelt like failure\nand it felt for me a face a fate worse\nthan death\nis public failure public humiliation and\nmy body betraying me where i needed to\nbring in\nsome other person to get the job done\nfelt so public and it just felt like\nsuch a public\nfailure public humiliation public loss\nand i was willing to do anything to\navoid that so i went through like\nanother\nyear\num of ivf treatments didn't didn't do\nthe lupron but\njust continued you know on another year\num\nbut then i was like you know what give\nme the lupron i'm doing it i'm going in\ni'm going in\nand my husband\nwas like\nyou've done enough\nand i was like you're not calling it i'm\ncalling it you know you have a gang of\nkids i don't have any i have awesome\nstep kids but i don't have any of my own\nso it's really easy for you to say\num\nand he said as much as we want this baby\nas much as i want this baby\ni want you\nmore\nand\nabout that point i\nwas like i begrudgingly\nagreed to\nsurrogacy\nand then that is its own\nfun journey um that led us to our\ndaughter cavia james\nyeah thank you so much for for sharing\nthat because i think\nthe pressure you speak about is\nis so true and it feels like everyone's\ngoing through it but not everyone shares\nthat and then you think you're the only\none i know so me and my wife uh we've\nbeen together for eight years now and\nmarried for five\nand we constantly get this question of\nwhen are you going to give us a child\nand that's everyone you're right it's\nnot just your family it's not just\npeople that are in your life it's it's\nanyone and everyone you meet and often\nit can be\nsometimes it can be well intentioned\nsometimes it's just past time talk like\ndon't have anything else to talk about\nbut you know for us when we'd made a\nvery conscious decision that we were\ntrying to build our lives we moved\ncountry we moved state like we moved\nfrom london to new york and then new\nyork to l.a and now we're in l.a and we\nfinally found our feet\nyou know for us the the biggest thing\nhas been just\ntrying to go at our own pace in our own\ntime\nand i've also heard of so many friends\nwho've been told when their marriage is\nrough they've been given the advice\nwe'll just have another kid and it will\nwork out and it's almost like using\nchildren as an excuse using children as\na mending mechanism using children as a\nhope like this whole process seems to\nput so much stress and pressure on\neveryone what to speak of what you've\nhad to go through\non the receiving end of that and and i\nappreciate that you're sharing that i\nreally do because i'm hoping that it's\ngoing to make people more mindful\nwith what we say\nespecially to women\nand is going to make people more\nconscious about approaching that\nconversation tell us about i mean\nrecently you did a thing you cut your\nhair\nand you said on instagram that most\nwomen do big changes like this when\nthings aren't working out or when things\nare lost but you've done it for you when\nlife is going awesome\nwhat have been the biggest changes from\nthat moment we just talked about which\nis where the book starts to today when\nyou're cutting your hair you're saying\nlife's going awesome like things are\nmoving in the right direction what have\nbeen the biggest changes or shifts that\nhave happened\nuh i mean the the biggest shift was the\nbirth of you know kavia james um\nwhen they say no one can be prepared for\nyou know motherhood or the birth of a\nchild you really can't you really you\nreally really can't you can read all the\nbooks you can watch all the podcasts\nlisten to all the podcasts\nbut every baby is different every child\nis different and they come in\nlike\nyou know pretty much who they are um\nso you're\nyou feel helpless in a different kind of\nway but you're tasked with\nyou know\nguiding and shaping and nourishing and\nnurturing these lives but we don't know\nbecause every kid is different so the\nhandbook that you thought you know was\noh i got the book okay parenting for\ndummies whatever um\nthere is no chapter on your kid because\nevery kid is different and you have to\nget very comfortable with being\nuncomfortable and not having the answer\num\nso that has been a big shift because i\nliken myself a learned person um i love\ni love education i love learning i love\nyou know traveling and learning new ways\nof doing things new ideas\nbut yeah there's nothing that can\nprepare you for how vulnerable\nand clueless you feel um i have never\nasked for more help than i ever have\nsince she's been born i've never relied\non this many people uh probably since i\nwas an infant um and i feel\nit's not normal for me\nout of sorts um but i had to get used to\nthe new normal um and being okay with\nembracing my vulnerability\nas my superpower\nand i had a lot\na lot of therapy\nyou know a lot of therapy to to just\nwork through so many of these new\nchanges and then you know cobb's a year\nyou know year and a half she's talking\nshe's moving she's you know got her\nlittle crew of little toddler friends\nand oh wait it's a global\npandemic\nand now we are all\nin the house\ntogether\nand\nyou know sometimes when each person sort\nof works outside of the home you\nyou have an idea of people's parenting\nstyles you know and work styles um but\nwhen you have to work\nyou know study\nuh\nparent\num socialize all at the same place at\nthe same time\nyou'll learn a lot about each other um\nand i had to get to know\ndwayne's parenting style and he had to\nget to know mine um\nturns out as much as i am like kind of a\nby the book super anal person\ni'm more of a\ni mean what's really the okay\nokay she's gonna be in her pajamas all\nday who cares\nwho cares and he's like i care i care a\nlot i care a lot\nso you know just getting\nsharing space all together you know\nthat's never been our life i've had a\nvery sort of transient life since uh\nmy last couple semesters of college i\nhave been an actor you know going where\nthe work has taken me so i've never had\nto really be home like that or like this\num you know\ndealing with my parents uh siblings our\nchildren\nyou know it was more in and out you know\ni had like\nspot treatments of parenting not like oh\n24 7. okay oh no you're still here all\nright\nwell\nthat has been a big transition yeah and\nhow to\nextend grace and receive it has been a\nhuge transition that's that's beautiful\ni i love how you talk about you know\nit's almost like inviting and receiving\njavier james is such a beautiful\nspiritual\nyou know incredible experience and the\nway you talk about in the book and i\nhope that everyone who's listening will\nwill go and read that section because\nit's\nit's so amazing to hear just how\nwith grace grace is the right word you\njust said it about how you felt what\nwould you say has been the biggest thing\nyou've learned about duane at this time\nand what do you think is the biggest\nthing\nyou've learned about yourself during\nthis time because of javier james what\nhave been the big learnings about him\nand about yourself\num yeah there's there's we talk about\nthis also in the book um you know\nbecause dwayne obviously you know he\nplayed uh in the nba for 16 years and\nyou know he moved um though we don't\nlike to talk about those chicago that\nchicago year and the you know the\ncleveland few months um you know he was\nin the nba for 16 years and our whole\nschedules revolved around his schedule\nand making sure that he had everything\nhe needed to be comfortable and\nsuccessful and for him to thrive um and\nwhen he retired he was like babe\nnow it's your turn\nand i discovered\num because most of my work that i do has\nbeen away from home\nthey have no idea what it takes for me\nto be successful what it takes for me to\nbe comfortable what it takes for me to\nthrive so i've had to be i've had to\nlearn how to communicate\nmy needs and manage expectations um\nbecause our world as a family\nrevolved around dwayne's nba schedule\nand his you know his games his practices\nthe countless you know\ntherapists and specialists and trainers\nand this and the other we all had to\nrevolve around him and so what he said\nit's your turn i took that pretty\nliterally because i definitely oh\nawesome\noh this is going to be amazing\nand and it really wasn't um\nthey never saw what it took you know\nthey didn't come to my set and like we\nall go to his games you know we know we\nknow what his greatness looks like um we\ncan see him on tv but\nyou know my my projects they don't come\nout for a year later or whatever so and\nthey've never been on set so they just\nhad no idea and it you know it kind of\nculminated in this day where i had zooms\nback to back\nyou know i'm struggling i'm struggling i\nsee him walk by and i'm like oh yo can\nyou can you get me a glass of water\nplease\nand he goes\ni don't work for you\ncome again\num\nand i'm thinking i didn't work for you\neither but like i did what was necessary\ni did what was on my part i didn't i\ndidn't i didn't realize we were keeping\ntrack i didn't\nand you had i had to realize like\noh support looks different\nuh real different and when it's you know\ni don't want to i don't want to speak in\ngeneralities\nbut a lot of times i've heard a lot of\nwomen relate to this that when it's when\nit's you know the man's turn\nto return the favor yeah it just looks a\nlot different and\nwhere they feel like put out or y'all\nyou know a lot of men feel put out and\nlike they're losing or they're being\nweak by\nhelping by being an active participant\nin their household and in child-rearing\nand in you know um you know marital\nsupport um or relationship support\nit there they receive it amazing but\nwhen it's time to give\nit it felt somehow feels differently\nright\nand getting through those\nchallenges without me um you know\nsmothering him with the pillow uh has\nbeen a challenge\nthank you for being so honest because\nit's again i i think you're speaking\nabout something that every single person\nexperiences in in one way or another and\nyou know what what's remarkable is\nobviously that even though that may have\nbeen the transition point of now it's\nyour turn\nyou were still having an incredibly\nsuccessful career during that time and\nyou were still doing amazing things and\nyou know it's almost like\none wouldn't know\nthat everything was revolving\naround\nhis basketball career because it's not\nlike you weren't winning too\nbut it's amazing to see how much that\nwould have taken for you to balance and\nthen finally when it comes back how do\nyou have that conversation what you just\nshared with me is so beautiful and you\nknow as\nuh as a married man who i'm i'm trying\nto be\nuh\nwhat i would hope my my mom would be\nproud of me being because she raised me\nand she was an amazing mom and i've seen\nmy mom like run a household and work way\nharder than anyone around and so i've\nalways felt the need to want to support\nso i'm always trying my best how do you\nhave that conversation with your partner\nand how do our listeners have that\nconversation with their partner where it\ndoesn't become this give and take\ndemand but it actually starts to you\nknow we know there's no ideal but\nhow does it start to become a healthier\nspace of collaboration if that even\nexists how do you get them what what do\nyou do to try shift in that direction\nlisten i'm not even in a front like it\nwas easy because my instinct was be like\nare you kidding me you know\nand then it's an argument but yeah i'm\nstill thirsty i still don't have the\nwater yeah you know what i mean so i had\nto be like\ni love you\nand\nthat hurt me\nand i want to figure out how to talk to\nyou about this so we can figure out how\nto\nnavigate this\nwhich i totally read somewhere not even\ngoing to pretend like i came up with\nthat but this idea of when\nyou're like\nyou want to do that\ni love you\nwhat that was\nwas not ideal and it hurt me\nbut is there a way that we can come up\nwith something together that we're both\nokay with\nuh totally worked um\nbut i can't take credit for it uh but\nit's super effective but if you lead\nwith love and it's like i'm not trying\nto hurt you i'm not trying to squash you\ni'm not as my husband says cut your\nballs off i'm\ni'm trying to figure out how we how we\ncan move through this world together\nnot one walking in front of the other\ndragging them behind or you know um one\nperson sort of dictating to the other\nbut how do we walk side by side each of\nus getting enough of what we need\num a lot of that just boils down to\nuse your words like we tell the talker\nuse your words that tantrum is cute i\nthink i know what you're talking about\nyou got to use your words calm down\ntake a time out if needed\nuse your words\nand let's come back to this\nand\nit's been night and day and but a lot of\nit is as women we are conditioned to be\nnurturers we are conditioned to be\ntrauma and emotional and physical labor\nmules that is just\nwhat our latin lighted light lot in life\nis and that's how we're deemed a good\nwomen good woman\nbased on like how much we can take\nbasically none of it\nthere's not a lot of upside on that\nbut men are judged by do you provide\nthat's it do you provide\nbut in our household we both provide we\nboth bought this house\nso\nmama\nis going to work and mama needs some\nthings too\nso\nthis is what i need i want you to know\ngabrielle that everything you're saying\nis resonating we have\nuh a bunch of my team who are some of\nthem which are men producing the show\nright now and they're all nodding\nlaughing\nagreeing you are you're connecting so\neverything you're saying is is\nresonating with not just me but but a\nlot of the guys who are listening right\nnow as well and\nuh i i think that's so true one of the\nthings that i've always tried to think\nof it as is\ndo i really see myself spending the rest\nof my life with this person\nand if i do is what i'm about to say in\nthis moment how i want them to feel\npotentially for the rest of our life\nbecause they could they could take this\nmoment and they could never let go of it\nif it really hurts them if if i really\nsay something insensitive my wife could\nthink about this for the next 10 20 30\nyears because it hurts us so deeply and\nthat's going to ruin the next 10 20 30\nyears of my own life so even if it's\nselfish\nit's it's a great reflection of being\nhonest and just being like if i'm going\nto spend the rest of my life with this\nperson if i'm going to wake up in bed\nnext to them next week and next year\ndo i want them to feel that this is how\ni feel about them\nuh and you know that's been something\nthat's really helped me where i'm always\ntrying to like fast forward into the\nfuture and go how does how does me\nsaying this right now because it's\ncomfortable make my right life really\nuncomfortable in the future\nmy the first\nmy first marriage because there's been\nmore than one yeah you know we were at\nour our marriage you know uh therapist\num putting in that last dish effort and\nshe said to me\nyou know you seem to be very focused on\nyou know winning and losing and who's a\nwinner who's a loser\num\nyou do realize in order for a marriage\nto be successful you need to both\nwin\nso you know some days you're going to\nwin some days he's going to win some\ndays you're going to lose you know vice\nversa\nbut you really seem to be very focused\non\nmaking your husband\na loser and i'm like yeah\noh that's probably why it's not working\num i think i would have gotten that\nlesson but it's like you know i come\nfrom sports just like he comes from\nsports and it's like we don't play that\nyou get a freaking trophy just for\nshowing up like that's\nno like like you know i don't know if\nyou guys saw the the two olympians who\nyou know went out with like a like a\nshared gold medal no not in this house\nwe're gonna play till the bitter end you\nknow i want megan rapino taking my pk\nlike listen that's just what it is right\num i want a winner i want a loser and\nyou're gonna take this l um\nbut i have to always remember\nif i want a successful marriage i can't\nwant you to be a loser\nin this\nso you have to re-prioritize if you want\nsuccess\ndo you want to win or do you want to be\nsuccessful because those two things\ndon't always go together yeah i think\nthat's really well said how does that\ntranslate that energy and that spirit\ntranslate to the kids because i how are\nthey taking that on how are they taking\non both of your competitive spirits uh\nbut also understanding the difference\nbetween success and winning how are you\nhow are you working that through oh they\nlook at us like we're nuts um they\nthey're in that younger generation where\nit's not about winning it's the\nexperience it's the journey i'm like\nthat's cute um\nwhat you know like it's a whole\ndifferent generation where it's not\nabout the outcome it's about you know\nyour path it's about you know are you a\ngood person are you compassionate are\nyou a good global citizen and i'm like\nokay yeah yeah but who won and they're\nlike that's not not what's important\nso you know we have to catch up to them\nyou know um\nit's definitely our generation and you\nknow the older generation that is like\nnah yeah pansy like nah\nsomebody's gotta win you know and they\njust don't subscribe to that you know\nat all yeah i wonder i wonder whether\nwe're gonna find somewhere in the middle\nwhere it's like we've realized that\npeople can win\ncompassionately or succeed\nempathetically or be number one but do\nit to serve like i wonder whether we're\ngonna meet in the middle somewhere\nwhich which almost feels like the right\nblend of those two worlds of like well\nmaybe we can have winners that are the\nmost compassionate and they're doing it\nfor others and they're the most humble\nand it's like the paradox of embracing\nboth of the polarities that seem like\nopposites but actually\nwhat what if people could be both of\nthem right like how amazing would that\nbe and i think\nthose are the kind of winners we love\nand those are the kind of humans we love\nso\nuh yeah let's let's let's try and bring\nthem closer together let's see if we can\nuh we can pull them closer child shall\nlead you and ours are leading us and we\nare you know begrudgingly following\nbehind\num you know but yeah it's but that's\nwhat it's about you know when i saw\nthose two olympians sharing the gold and\nsharing the podium\nthat's what sport is supposed to be\nabout building community working\ntogether you know for the greater good\nof learning how to you know have\nteamwork learning you know everyone\nworking together for a greater goal it\nshouldn't always be about me me me\num\nbut\nyou know i came from the bobby knight\nschool of you know you know like\nwhy are we out here hot like i want to\nwin like what otherwise\ngo read a book\nit's okay to evolve yes absolutely i\nlove that talking talking about books i\nspoke about earlier that you and dwayne\nwrote a children's book called shady\nbaby and i was fascinated because the\nbaby's superpower is shade\nand and i wanted to understand that i\nwanted you to explain that to us uh for\nanyone who's not read the book yet uh\nshady babies the the children's book\nthat you put together yeah tell us about\nwhy the superpowers shade yeah you know\nso for many children the way they're\nable to communicate\nis through body language right um when\nyou lack the language and you lack the\nvocabulary to fully articulate whatever\nwhatever it is that you like don't like\num are uncomfortable with something is\nhurting whatever um when you lack the\nlanguage you got to rely on body\nlanguage so kavia james came out the you\nknow\narrived like\nyou know very clear she didn't like\ncertain things you know you know they\ntell you you got to put your you know\nyour you know support the baby's head\nand their neck and cop was like my neck\nis good like i don't know what to ever\nuse but like from jump she was just very\nyou know and as she got older\nyou know we and we started calling her\nshady baby because she would have the\nthese looks that were just like you know\num so we just kind of called her shady\nbaby but as she got a little older we\nrealized that so many\ngirls of color starting from a very\nyoung age are adultified they are not\ngiven agency over their ways of\ncommunicate of communicating\nmost children aren't just going to be\nshady for no reason they're trying to\ncommunicate to you i don't like that i\ndon't want that um that is harmful to me\nin some kind of way\nand so instead of looking at shade as a\nnegative\njust listen and watch for your children\ncommunicating with you so we wanted to\nshow shade as a superpower we're giving\nthese kids\nagency back to communicate in whatever\nway they they are able to to let us know\nwhat they like and don't like and and um\nand that we can use\nshade as as just another uh way of\ncommunicating yeah that's such a great\nmessage for children because they're\njust trying to find the simplest easiest\nway of telling you how they feel\nuh because for so many people\nwe just look at shade negatively like\nyou said we we think of it how an adult\nwould use shade but for a child they're\njust trying to find the simplest easiest\nway to express and communicate to you\nwhat they're going through and what\nthey're experiencing and so i i really\nlike that line of messaging going back\nto your book uh you got anything\nstronger\nwhen i was reading in the second chapter\ni believe it was and you talk about you\nknow religiously watching the last dance\nwhich by the way i loved as well me and\nmy wife watched it together my wife\nisn't even a sports fan she's not a\nbasketball she likes basketball but\nshe's not a massive sports fan and we\nloved it and she would watch every\nepisode with me because of how\nincredible it was uh to watch but you\ntalk about how that reminded you of a\nyou know\ni mean i i don't even have the words to\nreally describe what you experienced and\ni don't even want to try but\nyour rape experience at 19 years old\nuh\nand you've said you talk about in the\nbook you're like i've talked about this\nbut people are still like wait what they\ndon't recognize because you you're\nsomeone who's gone on to achieve\nincredible things and make a difference\nin the world and you're going off to\nchange legislation and policy and you're\nworking so hard for it\ncan you share with us how you look back\non that experience now as the years have\npassed\nand\nand\nhow you've been able to reconcile or\ncontextualize it for yourself in in or\nin whatever way you have or haven't i\njust want to hear about your thoughts as\nyou look back on it now and the way you\ndescribe in the book again everyone i\nhighly recommend you need to go and read\nit in the book but i'd love to ask\ngabrielle now yeah no so just to give a\nlittle brief backstory just to catch\nfolks up who who hadn't heard the story\nbefore um at 19 years old i was working\nyou know a summer job at payless shoe\nsource um\nin my community that i grew up in up in\nthe bay area of you know california and\num around closing time a man came in and\nyou know robbed the store and during the\ncommission of the robbery he forced me\nand my co-worker into the back area and\nthen\num\nraped me\nat gunpoint and at some point\nput down the gun during the rape and i\ngrabbed it\num turned around tried to\nshoot him i missed and then we had a\nbattle for the for the gun\num and then he just proceeded to just\npummel me pummel me pummel me um\nand then he ultimately\nyou know uh escaped\nso the time i'm talking about in our in\nour book is um\none of the only saving graces that i had\nthat summer of 1992\num\nwas watching the olympics\nand the dream team you know we've had a\nnumber of incarnations of you know dream\nteam redeemed team this on the other but\nthe original dream team where we were\ncoming back to claim our dominance in\ninternational basketball um and you had\nyou know we were fresh off of magic\njohnson um you know\nrevealing to the world that he was hiv\npositive you know had you know we're at\nthe height of michael jordan's you know\nfame um\nand those guys you know\nmoving through the olympic village and\nthrough the olympics just you know\npummeling you know uh folks but just\nfull display full peacock of black\nexcellence\nwhen i felt\nlike nothing\nand i i needed\nsome kind of lifeline i needed i felt\nlike i was drowning in plain sight and\neveryone was walking by me with life\npreservers but nobody wanted to throw me\none\nand those olympians\num\nmagic\nmj gail devers i mean\nthey threw me a lifeline\nin watching their stories and watching\ntheir excellence\nknowing all the things that they were\nbattling and still\npersevering um\nit gave me that lifeline because as\noften i've told the story about being\nraped and then i kind of move into\nbut now i'm a survivor and these are the\nthings that i did but i had never\naddressed\nthat in between stage\nwhere i was just\nbeaten\nand in shock\nnumb\ni couldn't look at myself in the mirror\nbecause i didn't i mean i was you know\nbeaten beyond recognition\ni had just started therapy like i\nstarted therapy thank god like a few\ndays after my rape\nbut that in between stage of how do you\nget from or get on the path from\nvictim to\nsurvivor that in between stage i call it\nmy ghost\nstage where i was a ghost of myself um\nkind of haunting my house that everyone\njust kind of\nlet slide around and no one really\naddressed me or dealt with me it was\njust kind of like i got nothing i don't\neven know what to say no one knew what\nto say i didn't know what to say\nbut something about watching the these\nolympics and watching these olympians\nbe so unapologetically\nblack\nand so unapologetically\nexcellent\nand being open about their struggles\nhelped me get\non the path to\nbeing a survivor\nand it was i i didn't i never really\nrealized or recognized the importance of\nthat time\nbecause it's important in the story if\ni'm gonna tell it\nthat people know\nit wasn't fast there were there were\nmany moments where i was a ghost of\nmyself\num\nbut it's okay to acknowledge that part\nof the journey yeah\npeople don't you can't you can't skip\nover steps when we talk about\nyou know um being survivors there's a\nlot of steps and i\ntraditionally had skipped over\nsome of the more painful ones\nyeah thank you so much for sharing that\nagain gabriel i really appreciate that\nand for for our\nyou know for our community and our\naudience today who's listening and\nwatching to to hear it from you is\nis is so profound it truly is and and\nyou talk about how you like you were\nlooking for heroes on the tv screen like\nthat's what you were looking for\nand\nand i love that statement because i feel\nlike that's often where we look when we\ncan't find it inside of ourselves when\nwe can't find it around us we we look\noutside we look around we look you know\nbeyond our initial community\nand i wonder how many people now look to\nyou and and wayne as their you know\nheroes on a screen and and and people in\ntheir world and especially as you write\nbooks like you do and share the stories\nthat you're sharing with people like\npeople are gonna need you know you're\nyou're doing that you're passing that\nyou're paying that forward and and i\nlove i love witnessing that and seeing\nhow\nwhat you are looking for is what you're\nable to be and you're not even trying to\nbe that it's just happening\nbecause you're sharing these stories\nand you talk about how you had to\nembrace your vulnerability embrace your\nkryptonite\ntell us\nbecause the way you share in the book on\neven in this interview and this is the\nfirst time we've met just for anyone who\nknows you know we've never met before\nwe've never spoken before\ntell us about your experience with uh\nthe shaman and and that journey towards\nuh embracing your kryptonite because\ni think that vulnerability today\nas many words have become a buzzword and\noften vulnerability is still curated and\nand we're not but you seem to have this\nvery\num i'm not going to say effortless\nbecause i think there's effort there but\nit's\nit's a very raw form of vulnerability\ncan you can you explain to us maybe the\ndifferent levels and layers of\nvulnerability that you've experienced in\ngetting to where you are\nyeah no i\ni had always looked at the word\nlet's not even get into the meaning but\nthe word is like\nnot me um\nbut because to be vulnerable is to open\nyourself up for pain and harm\nand it's to be\nopenly weak is how i thought about it\nand so there was nothing about any part\nof that\ni wanted on me\num i wanted to be seen as strong and\nindependent and resilient and and and\njust uh just you know my work ethic can\noverride anything\num i can achieve my way you know to\nwherever i can price my way out of\nthings i can um\nuh educate\nmyself out of things um i don't ever\nhave to be weak i don't i never have to\nbe vulnerable because i don't want\nanything else to happen to me\nand that's just how i've moved through\nthe world cut to\num\nyou know when\nlife keeps throwing you challenges\nat some point i ran into a brick wall\nand i was like perhaps i should stop\ntrying to run into this brick wall and\nlook for other ways around um whether\nthat be therapists\nshamans\num you know uh bringing brown brene\nbrown\nuh you know glennon doyle you know\npeople who who speak on these things um\nin a way that i had never heard spoken\num\nand it and it was easy to apply they\ndidn't make it sound like as my mother\nsays\nno\nare they doing that\nokay well new age do you mean\nso it didn't feel like that it just felt\nclear and i was like oh so you know in\ntalking to the shaman\num\nhe was like you seem to run away from\nyour\num femininity\nand he's like i'm not talking about uh\ngender expression i'm talking about\num what makes women amazing and unique\nyou seem to look at all of that\nas inherent weakness\nwhat if\nwhat you think is weakness\nwhat if those are actually your\nstrengths\nwhat if\nbeing vulnerable\nand open to\nlooking at the world in a different way\nmoving through the world in a different\nway approaching problem solving in a\ndifferent way\nwas actually\nyou know your superpower\nwhat if\ni was like that sounds like you know\nhe's like\njust start practicing anytime\nyou feel the urge\nto do something that women would\ntypically do\ndon't fight it\nwhatever let's\nand i started noticing that\ni'm definitely not on the um\nthe girly girl you know\nuh\nside of things yeah\nyeah\nkind of you know on a cool continuum\nthat's kind of has a cool balance of\nmale female energy\num\nbut what he meant was when you feel\nvulnerable when you feel um\nlike your emotions are going to\nbe readily available on your face\ndon't try to hide\ndon't try to cover it\njust\nbe and so a situation came up\nyou know where i can you start to feel\nit in your throat and\nin your eyes you're like don't you don't\nyou drop\num\ni was like\nlet's just\nsee what happens\nnothing happened\nand better than nothing nothing negative\nhappened the world didn't end\nno one used that against me\ni was understood\nfinally\nand i allowed people to see me\nwhich then allowed them to understand me\nand then they can better communicate\nwith me\num but i had to use um my words and i\nhad to be okay\nwith\nnot being okay\nand\nputting my heart out there\nand when i tell you i've never looked\nback\nthere are still of course times where\ni'm like\nokay they're going to use this against\nme they're going to absolutely use this\nagainst me kind of like how i feel about\nlike releasing my book into the world um\ni don't know if there's enough therapy\nyou know on the planet to really prepare\nyou for\nbasically handing your truth off to\nmillions of people and hope they you\nknow\nrock your baby to sleep\nfeels like tossing your baby into a\ncrowd of you know\nwild hyenas\nbut i'm all i can do is be me and tell\nthe truth and lead with vulnerability\nand\ntransparency\nand hope that i'm building community\nwhere\nthere had been none or very little where\npeople need it the most you know where\nthe people that need it the most are\ngoing to gravitate towards it and going\nto\nbe attracted towards it and\nand find it to be useful and purposeful\nno that's that makes a lot of sense and\nit's uh\nyeah i agree with you i mean you know\nthere's\nthere's parts of your life that you\nalways want to be private of course and\nand privacy is also important and\nsecurity is important as well and but\nthere are parts of your life that you'll\nonly ever fully uncover if you're\nvulnerable about them and i think that\nthat balance and figuring it out\nindividually again like you said earlier\nlike you said hey when you have a child\nno child's the same it's like well all\nof our inner childs are not the same and\nthe\nthe work that we need to do with\nvulnerability and privacy are not the\nsame either and so\ni i think taking that more tailored\ncurated approach\nuh to seeing what we need and how we\ncould slowly peel away and open up is is\nso important and\nyou know helping zaya do that must have\nbeen extremely\nyou know an amazing journey to be on\nwith her\nand and i love how you talk about how in\nthe book how you're not rewriting\nyour your history together but you're\nrespecting\num her wishes and and and who she is i i\nwant you to share that journey with us\nas a parent and also dwayne's\nperspective too because\nthe way the way you describe in the book\nis going to help so many people who have\nthat very limited viewpoint of i don't\nknow if i could do anything to accept\nand by the way i have many we have many\nfriends family friends even in the south\nasian community it's it's uh\nyou know it's off these things are just\noften not spoken about and and often\nkids live with shame for many years and\nyou know to the extent of obviously\nkids taking their own lives and it going\nreally too far and so i want to hear\nfrom as a parent\nhow you both processed and understood\nand\nhave turned into a beautiful opportunity\nfor all of you to thrive\nyeah i mean well our responses certainly\ninitially were you know pretty different\njust based on our our life experience\nand me being older than him by you know\nalmost 10 years um i've just been on the\nplanet a little bit longer and uh you\nknow\ni i work in a different kind of industry\nbut i was lucky enough to be born into\na family where you know when we moved\nfrom omaha nebraska uh to the bay area\nmy mom was like yes\ni've always raised you girls to have a\nworld perspective and not a town\nperspective but now i can show you more\nof of the world and all the different\nyou know communities and uh at eight\nyears old she took us to our first uh\ngay pride parade\nwow guys she bought us little buttons\nthat said straight but not narrow minded\num\nso it just was never really um\nshe never presented it as\na negative thing it's just uh just like\nwe you know in the black community you\nknow this is the black community these\nare just other communities and they're\nall awesome and we should learn as much\nas we can about them so we can know how\nbest to respect respect them and um you\nknow do more than just um uh you know\nwhat's the word when people um tolerate\nfolks you can celebrate people and you\ncan let's let's get all let's all invite\neverybody to this party it's a good\nfreaking time and so i was very lucky to\nbe raised by parents who who move that\nway um and duane you know coming from\nyou know the south side of chicago\nand you know having a mother who's now a\npastor\num you know it was a different\nexperience um in terms of the lgbtq plus\ncommunity and those things were a never\nspoken about and if they were it was in\nto condemn\num you know hateful you know jokes\num\nbut just just scorn a lot of scorn\nso you know when i came into the picture\nuh and zaya was still a toddler\ni was like oh okay\ni\nfigured\nshe and i i will refer to her as zaya\neven though she went by another name at\nthat time\ni recognized she might be part of the\ncommunity but you know\nsee how this plays out\nand dwayne was like no no no\nno no no no and then zaya came out in\nthird grade in chicago and you know but\nby that time zai has been zaya she's\nbeen very consistent you know who she is\nand how she moves through the world\nshe's been very consistent whether you\nwant to see it or not\nshe's been very consistent and she's\nbasically been like you guys have you\nguys caught up yet okay\nand so by the time she came out you know\nnot that he had all the answers or i had\nall the answers\nwe you know we were\naware enough that okay this is her truth\num and then we wanted to make sure that\nour home\num and anywhere that we were that we had\ncontrol over anyway was a sanctuary and\nstayed a sanctuary and so we gave her\nthe agency of of saying telling us who\ndo you want to know who do you\nnot want to know and she made up this\nlist called the never ever list\nof all the people she did not want to to\nus to tell or her to tell\num and then by the end of the night\neveryone had flown off the never ever\nlist because she got such great\nresponses and it was kind of like okay\ncool yeah all right\num so by the time you know seventh grade\nrolled around and she was like and i\nasked her you know i go speak to all of\nher schools as you know we enroll the\nkids i speak to all of their teachers\nand administrators and i'm like here's\nthe thing want to make sure that we have\na strong lgbtq plus community that she's\nwelcome into\num\nyou know i want to make sure just\neveryone's you know on point with\neverything and there's i don't have to\ncome up here with you know\nletting people have it because i will\nand um you know\nnot say i'm proud of this but there\nmight have been a priest that was fired\num\nfor you know\nnot being on the right side of history\nyeah so i'm not afraid to you know\nconfront things but um so i asked saya\nhey going up to the school\nyou know how do you want me to you know\nidentify you\nand she was like\nyou know\nafter back and forth\nwell i'm a straight trans girl i was\nlike\nokay\nyep perfect okay\nstart to leave then i'm like oh um\nwhat name do you want to go by and she\nwas like\nziya\nokay\npronouns\nshe was like\ni was like there are options\npronouns like which pronouns she was\nlike she and her thank you and i was\nlike okay well i just want you to know\nthat i know that there are other options\nand\nbut she just you know i go to the school\nand i'm like i don't even know what\ntheir reaction is gonna be and they're\nlike okay great yeah no problem change\nthe name here no problem\nyou know we've we've you know you're not\nour first family you won't be our last\nand we just want to make sure that zaya\nfeels comfortable and she's prepared and\nset up to win and to succeed in school\nand i'm like\nokay\nhas it been that easy for every single\nspace or person\nhell no\nbut\nif you\ncan't come into our home and love and\naccept and embrace and resp you know um\nyou know celebrate everyone in here then\nyou're not welcome in here yeah and um\neveryone has been\nyou know wonderful there's been some\nlearning curves but\nziya takes everything in stride like she\ngave us a year to make sure that we got\nher pronouns right wow\nswitch she was like i recognize that you\nknow it's a hard thing to switch so you\nguys have a year wow\nthat's incred that's incredibly like\nthat's that's so mature and so kind and\nso like that's amazing that what a what\na phenomenal size amazing that's\nthat that requires so much patience\nthat's really special\nand grace and grace\nreceives it from us and everyone else\nand she extends it as well\nbut you know it\nthere have been you know\nchallenges you know to that and and\nwe've had parents who said\ni just don't know know how to love them\nyeah oh i love them\nyou know and when you're looking at the\nstatistics of the suicide rates in the\nlgbtq plus community but specifically\nfor trans kids\nand trans people of color\nthose rates you know quadruple\nand\nher life\nis not up for debate\nyour child's life\nis not up for debate their identity is\nnot up for debate they are who they are\nand it is our job\nto love them and nurture them and\nrespect them and guide them um and love\nthem so fiercely\nto offer as much\nyou know insulation as we can because\nthe world has not been as kind and that\nis our job\nso so beautifully said gabriella and\nit's uh yeah it's amazing to hear how\nmuch\nlove and grace has come out in this\nconversation just
