    "transcript": "i honestly think i maybe have a\ndifferent\nview of failure than other people do um\ni think that it's one of the things\npeople are most terrified of in the\nworld especially in my community so many\nwomen in my community petrified of\nfailing\nand i always think like\nif you can understand that 99 of the\ntime you're not afraid of failing you're\nafraid of other people seeing you fail\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every single\none of you that come back every week to\nlisten learn and grow\nnow this is a guest a friend that i've\nbeen talking to dming messaging with for\na bunch of years now and i've been\nwaiting for this moment to actually sit\nwith her in person i'm a huge fan i've\nadmired her work for a long long time\nwanted to be in the same room we've\nactually never crossed paths uh in\nperson but we're finally here in the\nstudio i'm speaking about none other\nthan three times new york times\nbest-selling author and the founder of\nthe hollis company rachel hollis rachel\nthank you for doing this oh my gosh i'm\nso tickled i'm tickled just to get to\nhang out with you and the fact that\nthere are cameras is also great i know\ni've i've genuinely been looking forward\nto this and you were kind enough to have\nme on your podcast last year yeah yeah\nyou had to do it digitally yeah i know\nbut it was still wonderful i i felt like\nwe really got along and connected and\nyeah even now you've just walked in and\ni'm already like i feel like i already\nknow you like genuinely 100 and i\nanticipated that so yeah no this is wild\nyes same it's honestly wild too just\nbecause with everything that's happened\nin the last year year and a half maybe\nat this point we haven't i just haven't\nhad the chance to connect with\num colleagues or with people who sort of\nhave the same mindset or kind of\nstriving for the same thing so it's\nalways a treat to get to connect in real\nlife yeah definitely i'm excited to talk\nto you offline as well right this and\nmore and as much as we can but we\nliterally just discovered something\nwhich has to be where we started\nso rachel literally just said to me jay\ni need to tell you what i was doing\nyesterday yeah and i was just like i did\nthe same thing so why don't you so there\num dr daniel ayman is someone i've\nadmired his work forever i've read his\nbooks and i always wanted he's a\ndoctor of the brain yeah he's a clinical\nneuroscientist thank you i knew you knew\nthe words\nhe's been a guest on the show twice okay\nso if anyone yeah love his work um but i\nhad always wanted to have it done and\nmy friend trent do you know\nokay so trent's a really dear friend and\nwe were texting he got scanned recently\nbecause i saw him when he was here right\nyeah so he was here and he was like oh\ni'm in california i'm having some scans\ndone and i was like by who because i\nfeel like if you're sort of in this\nindustry there's one person you go to\nand so he connected me and i nerded out\nwhen i got to talk to uh dr amon for the\nfirst time just because in my life what\ni want most is to understand myself\nemotionally physically why do i do the\nthings that i do and how can i become a\nbetter version of me and i just feel\nlike the more information i have for\nthat the better also\na ton of mental illness in my family my\nolder brother was schizophrenic and took\nhis own life and um there's just\ndepression and anxiety and so many\nthings that run in this and um i just\nwant to understand if there are things\nthat i can be doing to better live each\nday and so i felt like my favorite book\nby dr amon is um i think it's the end of\nmental illness yeah which i just found\nfascinating um essentially the idea that\nthe brain is the part of the body that\nlike if you broke your arm they would\ntake an x-ray of your arm before they\ndid anything to try and make it better\nbut if you go to a doctor and you're\nstruggling with mental illness or\nemotional issues they don't look at your\nbrain they just start prescribing things\nand\ni'm a huge proponent of taking the\nmedicine that you need and getting the\nhelp that you need but i just i know in\nmy brother's case\nthere was a lot of medicating and and it\nwas a different time and my parents\nreally didn't have the information they\nneeded to help him um but i just think\nhe would have been better served by by\nmore info so that was why so i went\nyesterday and got brain scans and found\nout that you and your wife you were\nthere two hours before us so crazy\nthat's actually crazy yeah we went so\nour reason was i mean that's a beautiful\nreason to go and\nyou know i'm sure there's so many people\nlistening and watching right now going\noh my gosh like i need to know more\nabout right\nwe went because\ni've realized that\nwe like like what you were saying we\njust know very little right like about\nus yeah\nand i'm just always like i want to learn\ni want to be curious\nand i really struggle with\nnot knowing that i could be acting in a\ncertain way or behaving in a certain way\nbecause of something that i have no clue\nabout right but actually i could be\ndoing something about and i think the\nother thing that changed for me for a\nwhile was\nwe were always told to like live a long\nlife and that was like a big thing when\nyou were growing up like\ni don't know at least in my culture it\nwas very much like you get blessed to\nlike live a long life right and i was\nthinking but actually i want to live a\nhealthy life yeah the length is going to\nbe up to god and whatever that needs to\nbe but the health is up to me yes of how\nconscious i am\nabout how i live yes and so i think for\nme going to get my brain scanner and i\nwent with my wife yesterday\nwe were going there for that reason yeah\nyou know what are we doing wrong what\nare we doing that's harmful what are we\ndoing that's good for us yeah and but i\nlove your reason i mean that's such a\ni think for so many people who have had\npeople in their life who've struggled\nwith\ndepression or mental illness and not\nknown where to start yeah and we don't\ndiscover anything yet so we don't have\nanything to share sorry yeah we don't\nknow i know we just set you all up right\nrachel i have nothing to say i don't\nknow well but i do think you know one of\nmy big fears is\nbeing so intentional about trying to\nlive in a healthy way\nbut there are times in my life where\ni've found let's say i'm taking a\nsupplement that i think is really good\nfor me and then i'll find like something\ni'll start to feel off or go wrong and\nthen i'll go have blood work done and\nfind like oh well\nyou know you're anemic and um i am i'm\nanemic and i have low blood pressure so\nlike you actually shouldn't be taking\nthat supplement because it's going to\nmake this thing worse so i hate the idea\nthat without information we actually do\nthings that are harmful that we think\nare helpful because i really just feel\nlike that it's so discouraging when\nyou're making choices that you think\nlike maybe they're choices that are even\nhard for you to make or you're eating in\na certain way and you're trying to like\ntake care of yourself and then you find\nout like oh it was yeah it was actually\nthe opposite it was so discouraging so i\njust i am enjoying an example of\nsomething like that you've done because\ni think that's yes i can relate and i'm\ntrying to think about our audience like\nyeah what's something that you thought\nso i grew up what's popping into my head\nis i grew up in a family my family's\nsouthern on both sides oklahoma and\narkansas and\num really not conscious of health and\nany not mental not emotional not\nnutritional nothing\nso i grew up in a family that you know\ndeep fried everything covered in gravy\ncovered in cheese right it was delicious\num and sort of the idea in my family\ngrowing up was if you made it at home it\nwas healthy um it was if you ate out\nthat was unhealthy and so um just just\nno awareness around nutrition and i\nremember very specifically\nafter i had my first son he's uh 14 and\na half so it's been a while but um i had\ngained a lot of weight in my pregnancy\nbecause i just had no idea how to take\ncare of myself or what to eat or um and\ni just want to say for the record\nbecause this is very important to me um\ni hate how often weight is used to\ncontrol women and make them feel shame\nand so\nthis is not a conversation about weight\ni don't care what you weigh live your\nlife you're beautiful but for me i'm\nfive two\nand i was 52 pounds heavier than i am\ntoday and at five two that's a ton on my\nframe and\nphysically very uncomfortable pain like\nin pain just all the things and i\nremember after i had jackson it was the\nfirst time in my life that i\nthought i need to lose weight\nand i had no concept of even how to and\nno idea and absolutely did things in\nretrospect that were horrible for my\nbody like fad diets or um protein\npowders or things and i mean like slim\nfast i don't mean like what we have\ntoday that's good for us\nand um i remember about going through\nlike a month where i was like on a diet\nand i didn't weigh myself because i was\njust trying to make you know great\nstrides and whatever and finally getting\nto the end of the month and weighing\nmyself and i think i had gained a pound\nand\ni was devastated like first of all i\nprobably my son was probably four months\nold at the time i'm exhausted i don't\nknow what i'm doing and now i've feel\nlike i've been restricting myself and\nfeel like i've been doing things that\nare good for me and actually it was\nopposite because i really didn't\nunderstand food at all so i was eating\nthings i thought were healthy\nand they weren't and i was it just it\nwas a whole mess and it's been years of\nlearning a different way\nbut\nwhen you're already tired you're a mama\nand you like feel overwhelmed and now\nyou just did then you're like screw it\nlike why am i even trying i may as well\ngo to taco bell because at least that\nburrito is gonna make me happy instead\nof sort of making these choices so i\njust i i grew up without\num education from my family about what\nthat looked like and my personal\ndevelopment journey really was a journey\nof me trying to arm myself with\ninformation that i never had and i found\nthat information in books and podcasts\nand youtube videos and um it changed my\nlife yeah no that's that's such a great\nexample by the way like i love that\nstory and journey because it's so\nrelatable for so many people right no\none grew up with parents who knew\neverything about it right every vets\nwhen i married my wife i was just like\nhow do you know all this yes that's her\nworld yeah and i didn't grow up in that\nway either i grew up eating four\nchocolate products a day oh my gosh so i\ngrew up i used to eat a chocolate\nbiscuit a chocolate bar yeah a chocolate\nyogurt and a chocolate ice cream every\nsingle day and it was amazing\ni'm like addicted to chocolate for life\nyeah like it's it's such a strong thing\nyeah and it's funny i actually told dr\ndanny lehmann this i said to him when he\nwas on the podcast i said oh you know\nnow i've become really good at\ncontrolling my sugar intake and i do a\ncheat day once a week and he said yeah\nit should be called a cheat day i was\nlike what he goes you're cheating your\nbrain\nand he just he like flipped it on me\nlike he did that matrix i was like he\nwas just like yeah you're cheating\nyourself because he was just like it's\nnot a good thing right because you think\nthat your sugar a week is a treat\nbecause it's actually cheating your\nbrain and i was like oh man i still do\nmy once a week\nhonestly we were talking about it we're\nlike he's go when we have this\nconsultation he's gonna like tell us\nlike you never have coffee again never\nbecause i did yesterday honestly i was\ntelling you i couldn't have coffee\nbeforehand and i had flown out from\naustin\nand so\ni could not believe\nhow\nmuch brain fog i had yesterday without\ncaffeine\nlike i i\nhe texted me yesterday and said how'd\neverything go and i was like i am\naddicted to coffee i i am i because i\nhaven't tried to live without caffeine\num since i was pregnant the last time\nand i cannot believe how much i need\nthat for focus and in fact as much as i\nam high producing like you know my i'm\nalways doing i am the i'm an achiever i\nlike do all the things\nthe lowest scoring thing on you know\nthat computer test\nwas focus\nlowest scoring for me and i had\nsuspected that because i can accomplish\na lot but i get distracted easily and so\ni'm dying to know like why or what am i\nwhat do i need to do and i'm afraid he's\ngoing to be like never have coffee again\ni think that's all of us though i really\ndo believe that the evolution and i love\nsocial media right like without social\nmedia i wouldn't even\nhave this community we have and be able\nto have this podcast so i'm not someone\nwho\nlikes to bash social media or i think it\nyou know it has its pros and cons as\nanything but\ni find that as social media apps evolve\ni find that they do worse for my focus\nand distraction consistently so i saw\nthe difference between\nthe difference between instagram and\ntick tock for my brain right and i'm\njust being aware like i haven't even had\nthat test right right but i saw that the\nmore time i spent on tick tock\nthe more i would need distraction the\nmore i would feed distraction the more i\nwould choose distraction and i've\nrealized that for me at least i'd love\nto hear yeah i'm trying to take this is\ni'd love to hear what yours is for me\ni've found that when i don't look at my\nphone first thing in the morning\ni'm able to control that urge\nand when i go on breaks i was literally\nin miami for two weeks recently\nand the work that i was doing meant from\n9am to 5pm we couldn't be on our phones\ni was working with the client and so i\nwasn't on my phone and not being on my\nphone from 9am to 5pm which is very\nabnormal for me in my life and i'm\nshowing yours too yeah it was a\nphenomenal feeling\nand so for me i've i've been able to\nfigure that out by realizing i feel so\nmuch more clarity and focused when i\ndon't pick up my phone in the morning\nwhen i do do like a social media fast\nright regularly throughout the year\nwhat have you been doing apart from the\ncoffee like what have you been doing to\nhelp improve and i guess why do you want\nto improve your focus is a good question\ntoo because some people are sitting\ngoing well i'm i'm happy just doing this\nbut\nwell oh my gosh so there's so many yeah\nso many things sorry so i'll just start\nhere i literally just went i love it um\nso i think three weeks ago i\nnot only did i remove tick tock from my\nphone but i closed my account wow i\nliterally deleted it\nand um it was a very conscious choice\nbecause of how like i would go on fast\nwhere i'm like i'm not going to open\ntiktok for a month or whatever but\nthere's i mean obviously it's designed\nin such a smart way\ni just will lose an hour and a half yes\nand i would sort of tell myself\num i would only do that like let's say\nit's night and the kids are in bed i\nhave nothing to do and i'm like okay i'm\njust gonna watch for five minutes and\nthen i lose an hour and a half\nand i'm i know there's a lot of people\nwho would say like well who cares\ni care because\nthe greatest value in my life is growth\nand\nin order for me to grow i have to\nconstantly be feeding my mind i sound so\ncheesy right now i feel like if i was\nwatching i'd be like okay whatever but\nfor me that's books\nand i never run out of non-fiction books\non my nightstand on you know tables in\nmy and so i have all these stacks i\nreally want to read\nand that hour and a half that was my\nreading time because when i'm done i'm\ntired and now i need to go to bed so\nfor me it was a very conscious decision\nof\num you you have to know what it is you\nwant and this is fun and this is\nbeautiful and it's a cool way to connect\nwith people but i just knew\nthis is not serving me well and\ni had tried\nnot having it there but i i don't know\nif you ever feel like this like if you\nhave an account on social and you're not\nposting on it there's almost this like\nweird guilt that happens\nand so you feel like you have to and i\njust thought nope i'm just removing i'm\nremoving this distraction from my life\nso why focus matters to me is\nthere's so many things that i want to do\nmeaning\nthere are 10 books inside my brain that\ni want to write and\nscreenplays and\nthings i want to try and stuff i haven't\ndone before and\nthe only way i'm going to pull that off\nwith a company to run and for children\nis the ability to focus and get into\nflow state and get that work done and be\nhighly productive and then move on to\nthe next thing\nso for me\ni am constantly trying to figure out how\ni can do those pieces better and i\nreally feel like this is part of wanting\nto have a brain scan too i feel like my\nfocus has gotten so much worse in the\nlast few years and i don't know if\nthat's the result of social or the phone\nor\nwhat it is but i just know that if i can\nget back into\nthe focus that i had maybe four years\nago whatever was going on\ni was so much more productive and i\nreally want that back i can actually\nrelate to that so much like everything\nyou're saying i'm just like i feel the\nsame way and that's been what's making\nme yeah so conscious of it especially in\nthe last 12 months right i think we've\nall consumed more content in the last 12\nmonths than ever before and for me as\nwell like so i this is this is real and\ni know it sounds like crazy but it's i\nhadn't watched television like a tv show\nin the last 10 years before me either\nbefore kovalev before covered and then\nnow i have and i sort of hate it yeah\ni've i literally noticed myself i i've i\ndidn't watch tv i watched movies so i'm\na big movie fan but i hadn't watched a\ntv show right or watched something\nconsistently or binged or any of that so\ni do watch movies just to clarify uh\nbecause i talk about movies a lot but\nbut tv shows i hadn't and i feel so\ndifferent mentally yep now that my habit\nbecame every night me and riley would\nfinish our day and we'd turn on a show\nwhich we didn't do for such a long time\nwe've been married for five years so\nfor five years of our relationship we've\nhaven't done that at the end yeah we've\nbeen doing that nearly every day for the\npast 12 months and i feel different\nright like i feel slower i feel\nmore lethargic i feel less alert i don't\nfeel my best self well it's interesting\ni was talking to i was talking to my\nboyfriend about this which i'm fine to\nsay that i have a boyfriend just not\ngoing into detail so i was talking to my\nboyfriend about this the other day about\nhow important\nboredom is for imagination\nso when we were all growing up\nyou were just bored sometimes and that\nwas life yes right and in the boredom\nyou know when you'd have those times\nwhen you're a little kid and you'd be\nbored and you sort of like wander around\nthe house and like try and figure out\nsomething to do and then you'd end up\ndoing something clever interesting or\nlike you'd make up a game or what\nkids don't have that anymore there's a\nmillion things that can distract them\nfrom being bored\nand he said something really interesting\nhe's like no kids are still bored\nthey're just bored and distracted which\nis way more dangerous\nbecause they're they're still bored\nscrolling on their phone\nbut now they're not even conscious of\nthe boredom yes and what is that doing\nto the next generation of not being able\nto be creative thinkers or sort of go\noutside the box and i have this\nconversation with my kids a lot because\nthey have i mean they have like our old\nphones my ex and i like it'll be like oh\nhere's an iphone 4\nthat you can like try and make work um\nbut they definitely have phones and\nthat's very much a part of their life\nand\nthey get so frustrated with me because\ni'm like no you need you need to be yeah\ni i can't figure out what you're going\nto do with this time this is your time\nto you can\nread a book\nfigure it out and as much as they're\nfrustrated by that process me removing\ntech and making them go do something\nthat's also when\nmy youngest will always gravitate to\npainting\nright the oldest will always go and\nstart playing with legos or building\nsomething that he's like too cool to do\nbecause he's 14. but they'll always\ngravitate to these things that they\nwouldn't do otherwise\nbut i wonder how much we need that as\nadults as well\nlike how often are you bored\nhow often are you just like sitting sort\nof letting your mind wander\num i feel like we're missing that\nbecause we just it's such a we're always\nhere like grabbing for where's the phone\nyeah we're bored and stimulated which is\nweird right it's like how can you be\nstimulated but be bored but we are right\nthere's actually a great book by the\nschool of life called how to be bored\nit's a really small book well\ninteresting yeah i came out a couple of\nyears ago and i spoke about with\nyuval noah harari the uh the author of\nhomodeus and xavier yeah yeah we spoke\nabout boredom on the podcast and and we\nwere gonna start the boredom movement\nwe were like you should have x amount of\ntime every day where you allow yourself\nto be born yes and you allow yourself to\nnot do anything and maybe like you said\nwith your children we'd actually do\nsomething innately creative and magical\nand beautiful maybe you won't maybe\nyou'll just be bored just be bored but\nyeah but it's healthy for the mind and\nthe brain i wonder what dr daniel was\ngoing to tell us\nbut i i wanted to ask you that this is\nsomething i've actually wanted to ask\nyou for such a long time because and you\nmentioned it you mentioned you love\nreading books yeah stacks of books yeah\nand you've had\nthree\nphenomenal successes as best sellers\nyeah but that's not where your author\ncareer began no and i remember reading\narticles about you and just looking at\nlike and i and i forgot the exact number\nso forgive me but how many books did you\nwrite before so girl wash your face girl\nwash your face was my six six that's\nwhat i was gonna say six books before i\nwas gonna say six or seven but i don't\nwanna get right so go wash your face\ngirl stop apologizing didn't see that\ncoming these three books\nmulti millions of copies sold extremely\nsuccessful like the guidebook for\nliterally every person i've seen online\nbut then there's five books before these\nthree\nand like four people right you have a\nnumber yeah do you have a number of yeah\njust as a rough i'm not asking for a\nsales figure i mean more just like how\nmany people would care i mean that i i\nit's hard with so the very first book i\nwrote oh they've all changed now yeah\nright yeah that's hard i'm like oh they\nsold hundreds of thousands now oh yes\nyes but back then you know here's how i\nwould think of it um so uh when you're\nan author just saying this for peeps who\nare at home who might not know um you\nget an advance so a publisher gives you\nan advance um to write a book and then\nif you sell out that advance and you\nstart making royalties i know you know\nthis no no it's useful it's very easy\nyeah so um just as a point of reference\nmy advance for my first book which was\nparty girl was one thousand dollars and\ni was like i am rich i have made it like\ni'm killing it in life um so that was\njust this tiny fiction book that i\nwanted to write about and i still love\nso much and fiction is still such a\nbig place in my heart actually just\nfinished my first screenplay that's\namazing i didn't know that yeah\nand i've always wanted to do it and i've\nhad the idea forever but that's again\nthis sort of like\ncreativity and ability to focus is like\nhow do i shift my brain from thing to\nthing\num so yeah so i started in fiction and i\nthink that'll always be a part of i love\nthat of of like love for me and it\ndoesn't even have to be successful\nhere's the interesting thing maybe we\ntalked about this when we did the\npodcast um\nbeing an author was never ever something\ni planned to be known for yes i just\nlove books and it was my hobby and so i\nwould write a book and in fact party\ngirl i self-published no publisher\nwanted that book and i self-published\nand then it started to sell and it\nstarted to do well and then a publisher\ncame and said hey we want to buy this\nand turn it into a series and we'll give\nyou a thousand dollars wow hot damn\nwow um so it really was just supposed to\nbe this little thing i did on the side\nand\ni honestly\ni don't know how this will sound but\nlike i miss the obscurity i miss writing\nand not having anyone care what i wrote\nabout because there is a freedom as a\ncreative to do whatever you want to do\nlike do you remember when you first\nmaybe started creating content and you\ncould freaking do anything\nand now everything's under a microscope\nand how did it perform compared to that\nand what and so i feel like you lose\nsome of that artistic you know joy in\nthe process yeah i love that that's been\nactually it's really interesting every\ntime and i've been having this\nconversation a lot more recently like\npeople have been asking me like what's\nthe big thing you're doing this year\nright and that's a question i'm sure you\nguys right what's the next book yeah i'm\njust like well really if i'm completely\nhonest the big thing i'm doing this year\nis self-discovery like rediscovery like\ni'm so i'm in such a\nan a strange land for myself this year\nand i'm loving it yeah because it's the\nfirst time where i'm just like i just\nwant to figure out what i care about\nright like i really want to just\nexplore and be\nyou know refined what i\nwant to dedicate my life to for\nthree to five years or whatever it is\nlike and i'm just in that space\nand i can see how uncomfortable it is as\nan answer to some people are like well\nyou can be doing this\ni'm like well we're doing a lot of stuff\nthat i love like i love the podcast i'm\nsitting down with amazing people like i\nam writing my second book and i'm loving\nthe process but there's also a part of\nme that's allowing myself to just unfold\nand unravel again and a lot of it to me\nis and i said this to my friends the\nother day we had a group called with all\nmy friends in london who i miss\nand i was saying like i literally feel\nlike i'm back at the beginning of my\njourney again so many i do too yeah\nthat's wild yeah i do too and it's\nreally like liberating and refreshing\nand\ni i love that you said that and i'm so\nhappy it's it's nice to know that you\nknow you're not alone even even when you\nare well i feel like i'm experiencing\nthat too or did experience that maybe\neverybody did coming through 2020\nbut in 2020 i got divorced and\ni\nhad been with him for 18 years\nso he's literally the first date i went\non i nev i never been on like my\nboyfriend right now is the second man\ni've ever been on a date with wow\ni didn't know that yeah wow that's\namazing pretty wild\num but what i'm\nseeing in real time and\nit is like\nhow often we think\nthis is gonna sound i don't know how\noften we think like this is what life is\nand then you go through something\nhopefully we just went through this\nglobally but you go through something\nthat shakes that\nand you realize like oh\nwait i can redefine my life at any\nmoment i can change the way that i see\nthings or do things even um\nin my relationship um you know what he\ndoes for a living\nand it's not a normal job\nand it involves a lot of travel\nlike a lot\nand even that is very interesting for me\nto wrap my brain around like at first i\nwas sort of like well how is this gonna\nwork because i only know one way of\nbeing in a relationship with someone\nand now i'm i'm like oh or\nyou can reframe the way you see this\nlike how lucky are you first of all he's\namazing he's super hot but also he is\nbut also\nlike what a cool job and what sort of\nadventures are we gonna get to have\nbecause of the travel and all of those\nthings and i'm reframing how that looks\neven um\nsort of reframing we all did this with\nwork\nand i know you've worked from home but\nfor most people that was a new\nexperience last year and now i feel like\nsuddenly\nbusiness owners besides me are like wait\ndo i need an office i don't think i need\nan office i mean i need a studio but i\ndon't need everything i thought i needed\nto do life in a certain way so\ni'm really loving\nthe redefinition of how i'm going to\nshow up in the world\nand like you said discovering what that\nmeans\ni also think um coming out of 2019 2019\nwas the most insane\nconstantly on the road speaking all the\ntime i don't know if you've had seasons\nlike that um and\na you know second book in a row comes\nout and press tours and just it's\nmadness it was untenable it was not\nsomething i could have kept doing and it\nwas also the most financially successful\nyear of my life\nand\nwhat i love\nis the reminder i want to acknowledge\nthat in 2020 so many awful hard things\nhappen for so many people lost jobs lost\nbusinesses less family members like\nthere were so many pieces of that that\nwere brutal\nbut as a human having gone through a lot\nof really hard stuff in my childhood i\nreally do live my life trying to figure\nout how an experience\ncan be for me like how can this\nexperience um what can i learn from even\nthe hardest seasons and so i'm looking\nat 2020 and i'm grateful\nfor the knowledge\nor the reminder that it can all be taken\naway\nit can all be taken away the business\nthat you thought couldn't be touched the\nspeaking career that you thought was\namazing your health your relationship\nlike all of these foundations i had in\nmy life were\neviscerated in 2020 and\ni will\nbecause i know this about myself i will\nhold that knowledge for the rest of my\nlife that like i'm going to be so\ngrateful that i get to sit in this room\nwith you because there were 18 months\nthat i didn't get to sit in a room and\nlike talk to friends\num i i'm a little worried i don't know\nif you how you feel about this but\ni feel like human nature is that\neveryone wants to forget what we just\nwent through i mean i you know if you go\nto an airport and if you've been to an\nairport in the last month\nit's wild they are packed people are\nlike i'm going on vacation i'm living my\nlife and i get it\nbut at the same time there were\nbeautiful pieces we did slow down we\nwere more present we spent time with our\nfamily we called our grandma we did\nthese things and i'm\ni just don't want to forget\nthe the redefining and the shifting and\nall of these things that we learned last\nyear that's my big thing going forward\nis like just hold this\nand so i was actually gonna follow up\nwith that but i think you answered it\nthat's that's how you process the idea\nthat\nthe lesson you said you learned was that\neverything can be lost at any moment\nyeah which can feel like a very\noverwhelming painful thought for a lot\nof people and and it is\nyou know in a valid way but you're\nsaying that the way you hold that\nthought is saying let's not forget yeah\nwhat we did this is precious yeah this\nis precious this is like let's hold this\nlet's be conscious of this\num\nit was actually a big part of what i\nwrote about in the last book because\nunfortunately i've experienced a lot of\nloss like i've lost a lot of people i\nlove in my life um\nand when you go through when you lose\nsomeone in death i think you're always\nreminded of how\nshort life is and that it can be taken\nin so fast and you don't expect it and\nso i think you're more when you come out\nthe other side of grief like that you're\nmore aware to like to say i love you\nevery time to give people hugs to look\nthem in the eye to be conscious of those\nmoments\nand that's what i'm hoping\ncoming through last year that i just\ndon't miss\nlike i remember the first time i i have\na very close group of best girlfriends\nand they are\nmy sisters my squad my like everything\nand i went through however many months\nwe all did where we were on lockdown and\ni couldn't see them\nand i will never forget we all met up in\npalm springs\nso i had seen them last at the beginning\nof march and it was july and i know\nthere are people who went longer than\nthat and so i'm conscious of how blessed\ni am but i remember coming out of the\npalm springs airport and my three best\ngirlfriends are waiting there and just\nrunning and like holding them and\nsobbing because we just\nhadn't been together and i just don't\nwant to miss that i just don't want to\nlose\nthose pieces i even thought this you\nknow i'm in this newer relationship it's\nlike five months\nand um\ni was telling him today i was like i\nwant us we're both big journalers\ni'm a big journalist we're so cool\nbut we both journal every day it's a big\npart of our morning routine and um\ni was like i want us both to journal\nwhat it feels like at five months\nbecause it already feels different than\nit did at\ntwo months\nand i don't want\nto lose this\nbecause i know\nwhat it feels like to be in a\nrelationship for 18 years and lose\npieces because of kids and life and\nhardships and\npain and all this stuff that you lose\nlike i'm gonna sound so cheesy right now\nand that's okay but um\nwhen we first started i love how you\nkeep saying that you preface your\npreference\ni'm like embarrassed so um when uh when\nwe first started dating\nwell first of all i'll just tell you\nthis because it's great we we're not\ndating we were friends you know he lives\nin austin\nand it was just supposed to be this\nfriend that like we got coffee and we\nwould go walk around the lake that was\nlike we were just friends and both of us\nwere not we're just wanting nothing\nand then we would go have we would get\ncoffee we would walk around the lake and\nthen i would get back to my car and it\nhad been like four and a half hours and\ni was like that's weird\nwhat a good friend this is\nand then i just started to feel\nlike oh my god i think i have a crush\nlike i'm eight\nlike it was so lame whatever but when we\nfirst started dating i remember i was\nembarrassing but i would literally\nlike i would look at his eyes and i\nwould just like\nlike have a panic attack and i was just\nlike he's so beautiful and his eyes are\nso beautiful and i'm just like lost in\nhis eyes that he'll be like are you okay\nand i'm like what i couldn't even hear\nwhat he said\nand yesterday i was like oh my god when\nis the last time that i looked at his\neyes and freaked out about how beautiful\nthey are and i know that sounds\nwhatever but i just thought it's just\nlike being conscious of these things\nbeing conscious of my daughter's four\nand she's so sassy and she like puts her\nhand on her hip and she's like got an\nopinion and\nshe's adorable and honestly i'm so\nscrewed when she's a teenager but\ni just want to be conscious of this\nstuff because life is speeding back up\nso fast and i don't want to miss it\num there's this have you ever read the\nartist's way yeah cameron so she has\nthis quote which i'm going to butcher\nright now but like\nbasically that the quality of your life\nis the quality of your ability to pay\nattention to pay attention to the\ndetails and to see\nall the little things that are happening\naround you so that's my that's my goal\nthat's a great lesson that was a\nbeautiful affirmation for all of us i\nthink the way you were sharing that\nlike i think we were all thinking about\nlike oh what if what have i what am i\ngoing to miss or what am i going to\nforget right\nor like what is it the law of\nfamiliarity yeah that it happens so\noften that you just take it for granted\num\nwe have a mutual friend who has a really\nand i'm not going to say his name but\ni'll tell you later but like he's a\nreally insane house here in the\nhollywood hill hills just\nabsolutely insane and i remember going\nover there for the first time and he and\nhis wife have worked so hard and this is\nlike such a celebration of how hard they\nworked and it's the most insane view\ni've ever seen in l.a like ridiculous\nand\ni remember walking in the first time and\nbeing like what the\nhell like what on earth and he's like\nexactly you know what i'm talking about\nright it took me\nso i'm like walking through with them\nthey're like yeah and it's whatever and\nhe's like\nand just i feel like\nwhat i'm most nervous about is the day\nthat i walk into this living room and\nthat view doesn't take my breath\nand the only way to counteract that is\nto be conscious of not wanting to have\nthat happen yeah\nyou know\ni i think this with them\nlike interacting with fans or readers or\nlisteners of your podcast if you've ever\nhad those moments where maybe you're\ntired or you're on press tour or just\nsomething's happening where you're like\ni you're depleted\nand\nyou maybe are like oh i've had those\nmoments where i'm like oh i have to go\ndo a book signing right now right\nand i make myself remember i make myself\nremember\nthe first\n25 book signings where two people came\nand i was related to one of them right\nlike\ni make myself remember what it feels\nlike to sit at that table and have\nnobody come up and ask you or nobody\ncares about your book nobody wants to\nread and like you've worked so hard\nbecause if i can put myself back into\nthose places i will always be conscious\nof appreciating these\nyeah i love that and and it's so and it\nis like you know this this is we know\nthis\nbut we still don't get it right\ntomorrow is going to be\nthe three-year mark of me moving to la\noh really yeah so did you move from\nlondon from new york i was in new york\nfor two years so i went from london to\nnew york for two years and then moved to\nla three years ago so i've been in the\nstates for five years and\ni hope every day and i do this right now\nbut again what you're saying i drive\nthrough la street and people think it\nwas always interesting people always\njust like oh why do you live in l.a it's\nsuperficial or materialistic whatever\nand i'm like i live here because i get\nto see blue skies every morning i didn't\nget that in london i know what that\nfeels like\nit barely rains i can i can wear\nanything i want every day i don't have\nto think about carrying an umbrella\nright and i was like i look at the palm\ntrees every day in like the mirror\nthrough my car yes and i'm just like i\nlive in a place that i would have\ndreamed to go on vacation\nand so there's such a like appreciation\nfor nature and the heights today i went\non a hike around we have a hike close to\nwhere we live yeah and it was just like\nthat to me is how i want to feel and i\nhope i feel like that forever but you're\nright the only way you feel like that\nforever is by not forgetting yes and so\ni think everyone right now i want you to\nsit down i want you to take a moment to\ndo what rachel just said\nand take a moment to just ask yourself\nwhat am i scared of forgetting oh good\none you know like what am i scared of\nforgetting yeah from this last 12 months\nit's been painful for all of us i've\nlost people rachel's says she's lost\npeople we've had family friends and\nmentors and people that we've lost\nwhat are you scared of forgetting that\nwas a gift at this time i think that's\nsuch a beautiful\nreflection for people to do yeah and i'm\nso glad you shared that with us because\nwe do need to hear it again and again\nyeah i mean i think another this is sort\nof going back to an earlier thing you\nsaid about not looking at your phone in\nthe morning um\nprobably the greatest practice in my\nlife and i've done it for a decade\nuh is journaling every single morning\nand a lot of times those are where i\nremember\nit's that very conscious moment of i\nmean this is a julia cameron thing too\nbut um doing the morning pages so having\nto fill a certain amount of pages every\nsingle morning and sometimes you have\ngreat things to say and sometimes you're\njust like it's cold i'm tired you know\nyou can't\nthink but those are when i have those\ndetailed moments and for the longest\ntime i never reread the journals and\ni've started doing that every time i get\nto the end of a journal i'll start at\nthe beginning and read all the pages how\nmany do you have a lot wow that's cool i\nhave a lot yeah and it's such a\nbeautiful\ncollection for me of um\nof just life and what was happening and\nhow i was feeling and i heard someone\nsay recently\nshe was like you'll never get to be with\nthis version of yourself again\nand i just thought that was so beautiful\ni heard it at a time when\nyou know when i started dating\nthis person um and i didn't have a lot\nof experience and i felt so nervous and\nyou know i can get on stage and speak to\n18 000 people zero problem like hanging\nout with oprah we're all good but going\non a date\ni felt like i was gonna die like i felt\nlike i was going to have a heart attack\ni didn't know how to act i was so\nawkward i didn't feel like myself i just\nit was it was a joke um\nand i was really hard on myself\ninternally about that like how can you\nbe this person who's achieved all these\nthings and you can't sit and have dinner\nwith this man without acting like an\nidiot\nand i was so frustrated and i heard that\nquote and i just loved it like\noh you're never gonna be with this like\nnervous giddy version of yourself again\nyou're never like if if it doesn't work\nout with this person and you date\nsomeone else that time surely you won't\nbe as nervous as you were here so could\nyou just\nallow yourself to be graceful and\nappreciate this version of you who she\nis today\num and that really helped me to sort of\nsit in the process but if you're already\njournaling about what you don't want to\nforget i i can't there's no greater\npractice i have in my life is is just\nwriting down the thoughts i love that\nyeah and for anyone who who doesn't see\nthemselves as a writer try yeah because\nit will come out and if you really can't\nthen what i do is voice note yeah so i\nvoice recorded myself all the time i\nfind it easier to talk find it easier to\nlisten to myself i can always listen to\nmyself on 1.5 yeah or two\nif i'm listening back and i find like\ntalking out loud to myself\nhelps me remember things in a really you\nknow visceral way that's awesome and so\nyeah i think journaling is a huge\npractice writing or audio whichever one\nworks for whoever's listening but you\nknow you were talking about you've been\ndoing my relationships and\nyou know people have gone through so\nmany big relationship\ntransitions during covert you you went\nto a huge one\ni feel like transitions are hard but\nthat's what life is made of yes right\nit's like life is made of transition\nyeah and transitions are usually\nwhere we feel\nwe need the most help it's where we're\nat our weakest where we struggle like\nwhether you're moving house getting\nmarried getting divorced breaking up\nmeeting someone new\nall of these are transitions yeah and\nthese are the most life-defining moments\nyes how how have you learned to\ntransition better as life has progressed\nbecause we never perfected we never get\nit right yes\nhow have have you have you got better at\ntransitioning in life do you feel you\nhave what has helped you i think i've\ngotten so much better because\ni don't rush it\nthat is the biggest lesson i have\nlearned in 38 years is\nhad i gone through\na divorce 10 years ago i would have\npushed myself to like okay get over it\nfigure it out it's been four weeks and\ni really was so proud of myself in the\ndivorce that i let\nmyself sit in the pain\nand it was so painful and it was so hard\nand i let myself feel every emotion i\nlet myself feel\nsuper sad i let myself feel very angry\nat him and very angry at myself and i\njust let it all sort of\nflow through me and kind of um\nalmost like\nwatching yourself experience those\nemotions instead of like drowning inside\nthem\nand that was i think so much more\nhealing and i think is a huge reason\nthat i can't speak for him and and how\nhe processed but i know for me that's a\nhuge reason\nfor why i think our relationship is so\nhealthy and good and why we were able to\ntransition our kids so well through the\nprocess\num so for me i think\nin transition just allowing yourself to\nlike be in it\nis a big one\nand i also when you were talking about\ntransition i was also thinking\nit's not just the transitions that sort\nof make us it's also\npoints of tension\nit's areas of tension which essentially\nif you are going through a change that's\ngoing to feel tense\nbut\nthose areas of tension in our life are\neither going to make us\nsomeone better or we're going to get\nworse there is no there's no sort of\nstasis there's no i think a lot of\npeople think they can hang out in a\ncomfort zone but you're either being\npushed and becoming better or you're\nbeing pushed and becoming worse and if\nwe can\num\ni think there's a lot like if we can\nsort of\nnot embrace tension well actually yeah\nlike my tattoo says embrace the suck\nbecause i really do believe\nthat\nthe best version of me comes on the\nother side of the hardest seasons\nand that feels like\ntransition or change or\nor whatever it looks like is just\nallowing myself to be like we're gonna\nembrace this we're gonna embrace all the\nparts of this and hopefully come out the\nother side as a better version of me\num\ni do really believe that\num i i assume that you are like a\nmanifesto goal setting like you have an\nidea of like who you want to be in your\nlife right um and not even necessarily\nwhat you want to achieve but just like\nthe kind of man that you want to be\nand i think that when we call our shot\nlike that when we start to dream and\nenvision and and have a plan for where\nwe want to go\ni do think the universe shows up to aid\nus in that process\nbut it isn't necessarily a an easy\njourney or a comfortable one i think\nthat\nmost of the time people call the shot\nand then everything goes to hell in a\nhand basket everything gets hard\neverything feels impossible they're like\nthey use that as an excuse or they see\nthat as an example of oh well that goal\nwasn't for me or that dream wasn't meant\nto be mine when the reality i think is\nthat the universe was like oh no no no\nyou said you wanted that thing\nand so we've put things in your path to\nmake you strong enough to climb that\nmountain\nlike you had to go through these things\nto have that but you just you gave up\nhere you quit because you thought that\nthe hardship meant that it wasn't\nsupposed to be yours when really i think\nthat the hardship was meant to grow you\ninto who you meant to become absolutely\nis that is that what kept you going when\nyou were writing\nfive books right because that's just\nthat to me is the perfect example of you\nliving what you just said right like\nthat to me is such a great you know if\nit's like when i look at you and\neverything you've achieved and all the\namazing work you do to me when i when i\ni remember reading that story years ago\nand just going wow like six books like\nthat is not a joke like there's nothing\nabout that that is easy\nyou know we talk about like you know\nit's like oh\nand i think a lot of people can relate\nto this today because we live in the\nworld of like i put out three videos and\nnone of them went viral so like what i\ndo like you know we live in this world\nlike oh but i've been posting every day\nfor a month and nothing's happened or\nand i feel people have this how did you\nwrite five books and keep going was it\njust that you loved it and you were\npassionate were you getting better like\nwhat was what kept you going to get to\nthat point i think all those things\nright i did love it i was very\npassionate about doing it and i felt\nlike i was getting better\nand\ni honestly think i maybe have a\ndifferent\nview of failure than other people do um\ni think that it's one of the things\npeople are most terrified of in the\nworld especially in my community so many\nwomen in my community petrified of\nfailing and i always think like\nif you can understand that 99 of the\ntime\nyou're not afraid of failing you're\nafraid of other people seeing you fail\nand that's about your ego that's not\nabout your work\nand so for me i have a\na really different definition of what it\nis to fail and i get it wrong i freaking\nget it wrong all the time like i i'm oh\ngosh back in april said something on\nsocial media that was so hurtful to so\nmany people and i was devastated i'm\nstill devastated i could like cry\nforever you and i\ntexted about this the last couple months\nbut i also think that like i have to get\nit wrong\nand i hope i freaking hope that people\nsee me get it wrong and then keep trying\nto learn and do better like i think as\nhonestly as a white woman in america i\nhave to\nacknowledge when i mess up\nwhen my privilege is showing understand\nthat i didn't understand and do the work\nto figure it out but i feel like there\nis\nthis this sort of\nway of being right now that it's like if\nyou get it wrong like go just quit\njust stop just just if your book flopped\nthen don't write another one if you put\nout five pieces of content nobody cared\nthen that should be it if you say\nsomething that you shouldn't have said\nlike but\nmy god how are we going to improve how\nwill we evolve as human beings if we're\nnot willing to get it wrong and honestly\nas painful as that experience was and it\nwas so painful because\nmy worst nightmare is\nhurting someone especially without\nintention like\nall of that\nbut i\nfreaking have i am like i'm a different\nmom because of that experience i've had\nmy two of my best girlfriends are black\nwomen and like have had to have the\nhardest most painful conversations with\nthem and how that has evolved our\nfriendship because of that what it looks\nlike to have\nyour kid come home from middle school\nand be like oh i saw a youtube video or\nsomeone\nwas making fun of you like that as a mom\nthat's devastating but then okay great\nlet's have a conversation about what it\nlooks like for us to have privilege and\nown that and\nman i'm never gonna get better as a\nhuman being if i don't go through that\nprocess all of us\nso i guess i just have um\ni really oh this is going to sound like\na bumper sticker but i really i only\nthink it's a failure if i didn't learn\nfrom the process and that goes for books\nor content or podcasts or relationships\nany of it um you know when i got\ndivorced i got such awful backlash from\nso many people\nand\nyou know that my marriage failed i'm\nlike my marriage\nis a massive success four beautiful kids\nfour kids through foster care\n18 years together like beautiful\nmemories grew so much dear friends\nstill raising a family to get like\nthat's not a failure maybe that's your\ndefinition of failure this not mine\nand so i think that\ni guess maybe the advice i would give in\nthis is if we could all\nbe more graceful with ourselves and\nredefine\nlike earnestly and humbly um go into\nsituations where you're really your\nintention is to grow i mean i told you\nmy number one value in life is growth\nand i will tell you that when you call\nthat shot you know i've for years i've\nhad i have i'm a nerd and so i have\nwritten down all my core values um but\nif that's true\nyeah it's the only way yeah yeah that's\nyour defining core value it's the same\nsort of thing like all right the\nuniverse is going to give you some\nopportunity to grow\nbut yeah i think that that is the most\nimportant piece is\nthat you have to redefine\nwhat failing is i mean failing is\ngetting to the end of my life\nand not having tried and not having\nwritten these stories down in my head\nbecause i was worried about what people\nwould think of me for you know wanting\nto write about superheroes or wanting to\nmake a movie like who freaking cares\nbecause i think that when you get to the\nend of your life\nyou're the only one there\nit's just you yeah you know and i don't\nwant to get there and think like oh i\ncould have\ni could have done that thing or i might\nhave had that or\nmaybe there was more work for me to do\nbut i was so scared of what people would\nthink or are so scared of getting it\nwrong that i just thought it was better\nnot to try yeah yeah thank you so much\nfor sharing that yeah i think it's yeah\nit's\namazing just hearing someone go through\na difficult time personally\nprofessionally and then to share in the\nway you have\nand\nyou know it's it's hard because it's\nit's that balance between what you've\njust said is it's that balance between\nbeing humble enough to learn from others\nright but there's a part of you when\nyou're creating\nto not get tied up in people's opinions\nright so it's like knowing like for\nexample when you make a mistake yeah to\nbe able to learn from it\nand you know i think about it i've made\nso many mistakes i'm not perfect and and\noften when you're trying to teach the\nchallenges that\nyeah it's you're on a pedestal now and\nit's difficult to then make mistakes yes\nbut\nwe're trying to learn as we're trying to\nhelp and there's no you know like i\ndon't think i don't think anyone on the\nplanet is perfect yeah and i don't think\nwe should aspire for it and i don't\nthink\nthere's anyone who gets anything right\nall the time yeah my best girlfriend we\ntalked a lot about this she does a ton\nof work in um\nracial reconciliation and understanding\ndiversity and it's it's what her\ntraining is in and um\nshe had this great line she was like\nrachel there's a difference between\nyour intent\nand your impact\nthose are two completely different\nthings like your intent was this but the\nimpact was this\nand in you not knowing that the impact\nwould be this that is the definition of\nyour privilege and like you not being\naware of that thing so there was that's\nso well explained i love that\nbecause i think what i definitely had a\nmoment of getting trapped in this\nnarrative and i'm sure other people do\ntoo is you're like but\ni wasn't that wasn't what i and it's\nlike no no it doesn't matter\nit doesn't even matter what you said it\nmatters what they heard right and like\nif you care about the community and what\nyou're trying to do and the work that\nyou're putting out in the world and you\ndid hurt someone it doesn't matter what\nthe intent was it only matters what it\nfelt like to them and so\ni have to own that and hold space for it\nand\nlearn from it and grow and all of that\nbut i'm curious then how\nwhat that looks like for you as a\ncreator i was talking to trent about\nthis too and i think a lot of us in this\nspace like we've all been in social for\na long time we all built our careers in\nit and i think what is maybe hard to\nunderstand\num unless you kind of were back at the\nbeginning is i'm guessing for you i know\nthis is true for me and trent\nwe sort of almost like a comedian\nworking out a joke at the local bar\nwe worked out our bigger form content\nin social posts so you would sort of\nlike have an an idea and you'd put it\nout there you'd throw it out you didn't\ngive it a ton of thought you just be\nlike here's this thought right\nand then based on the feedback maybe\nyou'd have a a dialogue with your\ncommunity or something would like go\nwild you were like whoa i wasn't\nexpecting that to go viral it was sort\nof how we learned what to do longer form\nor what to like evolve and make bigger\nand that doesn't feel like it\nis a possibility anymore i don't know if\nyou feel like that\nyeah first of all when we\nwhen we first started like\nyou didn't know you didn't try you don't\ntry to make something go viral\nyeah you just you create something yeah\nthat you really value and believe in and\nyou like and you enjoy and it's\nand you put it out there and you see the\nfeedback and then people like it or you\nknow whatever they don't like it and to\nme it was always\nyou know i was always looking out for\nlike where's the positive energy where's\nthe positive comments because i'm trying\nto put so my intent was positive yeah\nand when the impact was positive yeah\nmore than uh critical or like oh we\ndon't like your hair or you pronounce\nwords weird or uh you know you don't\nknow what you're talking about who are\nyou yeah like when it was that kind of\nstuff i was like all right well i'm\ngoing to keep trying my best yes\nwith my intent and hope and\ni think that now i'm\ntrying\nto do that more and more and i think\nwhat i've and you've said this and this\nis where i think we're we're aligned on\nthis is\ni've gone from living\na life where all that mattered to me\ngrowing up was being educated because\nthat's how i was raised\nand i was very fortunate enough to go to\ngreat educational institutions and none\nof them were paid for it they were just\nexam based and study-based and academic\nand then i went off and lived as a monk\nand that was completely the opposite\nbecause i gave up all my\njob offers and work and then i was a\nmonk for three years and then i've left\nwent back into the world of business and\nthen now married and an entrepreneur and\neverything else\nand i feel the most myself today\nwith my hair like this\nbecause you're jerking rather my hair\nlike this wearing the clothes that i\nwear living in the way i feel the most\nof myself today yeah and there's a bit\nof monk in there there's a bit of\nmanagement in there there's a bit of\nbusiness in there there's a bit of\nacademic in there there's a bit of uh\nhopeless romantic in there which i've\nalways been my whole life and that's who\ni am and i just want to i know that i\nstruggle with having to choose\nbecause i don't want to choose it so i'm\ntrying i think is the answer\nto be more and more putting out all\nelements of myself yeah\nand that can often be difficult for\npeople because people go well jay you're\nthe monk how are you the entrepreneur\nright i'm like i used to be a monk and\nthis is what i learned from being a monk\nthat i practice today every day but hey\nthis is what i love about\nentrepreneurship and business and\nstrategy right and i love both and i\nalways say to people like you can't have\nstrategy without sincerity and you can't\nhave spirituality without um strategy\nand you can't have\nuh data without intuition you need both\nyes and i i feel like i'm being forced\nsometimes to pick yes like jay are you\nare you gonna be the monk or you're\ngonna be this and i'm like well i am\nthere are parts of me that are still\nmonk-like i'm not a monk of course i'm\nmarried there are parts of me that uh i\nalways say you can think like a man\ncannot live like a monk so there are\nparts of me that still think like a monk\nbut there are parts of me that think\nlike an entrepreneur i think like a\nstrategist and\nand that makes me happy and i feel\nfulfilled and i feel real honest to\nmyself yeah so i don't know if that even\nanswers your question i do i'm allowing\nmyself to be like it's what you're\nsaying if i want to i'm and i'm not\ngoing to do this don't worry anyone if i\nwanted to be an athlete like a soccer\nplayer which has always been my number\none love in terms of sport\ni want to go and be a soccer player like\ni'm going to try i'm not going to try it\nbut but i'm going to try because if\nthat's what i want to be and express\nmyself in that way yeah then why not\nyeah so anyway i've got to a point where\ni don't want to limit myself as to how i\nexpress myself\nand i'm trying to reconnect with that\ni'm trying to be comfortable with that\nand it's uncomfortable it is because\noften you feel forced and squashed and i\nthink that people feel that even outside\nof social they definitely feel that in\ntheir very real lives that it's sort of\nlike well you're\nyou're an accountant yeah why do you\nthink you can also play guitar like why\nand the reality is that the most\nbeautiful versions of ourselves are\nthey're whole there there are many parts\nof us it's not just this sort of one\narea and i do think that there is this\ndesire on social or this thing that\ncomes through and this exists with the\nwith the community and it also exists\nwith the algorithm frankly that\nthey want you to stay in your lane yes\nthey want you oh but you're if like if\nyou and i put something on social and\nwe're using words that the algorithm is\nused to seeing us use that's going to\nget shown to more people than if you're\ntalking about right\nwork or business or whatever and so\nthere's all of these things that again\nit's these points of tension\nof yeah you could be really happy like i\ni i could\nkeep writing girl wash your face\nover and over and over\nand make a crap ton of money and have\nthat be my life forever\nand and there are people who do that and\nthat's amazing and awesome but because i\nstarted\nand writing was never supposed to be my\njob i never want it to be\nabout\nwhat is gonna make the most money or\nwhat is the box that i can check i mean\nmy last book\nwas\ni mean you know god bless the publisher\nwas like okay you want to write a book\nabout grief and pain when i'm known for\nwriting things that are funny\nand so it's like you're gonna come out\nof nowhere with this book about all of\nthese hard things and that book did\nnothing compared to what\nthe two books before it did but i would\nrather um\noh there casey musgraves has this great\nline in one of her songs where she says\ni'd rather lose for who i am then when\nfor who i ain't\nlike i'd rather like get it wrong in\nyour eyes but i showed up as myself\nthen keep doing the thing that the world\nwants me to do\nso i i love that and i think that\nas a fan of yours and i think like any f\nanybody in your community like you want\nto see the whole you want to see all the\nparts of it right like the people we\nadmire really\nwe want to see all of who they are as a\nperson not just like what's the pr spin\non your life and my biggest thing of\nthat is like i think\nwhen you allow\nyourself to\nhave that opportunity you allow others\nin your life\nand when you allow others to have that\nopportunity you allow yourself and i\nthink the more you know does that make\nsense yeah usually what happens is\nwe project so if we feel we're not\nallowed to be all of ourselves right we\ndon't let anyone including our kid and\nby the way\nuh this doesn't just\ntransfer over to your partner or a\nfriend or someone who follows you on\nsocial media it transfers over to\neveryone in your life because you can't\nsuddenly not live a value yes right you\neither live a value in it transfers and\ncascades all over your life or you don't\nlive a value and it doesn't cascade yeah\nand so if you live the value that i\ndon't allow myself to be fully myself\nyou're not going to let your wife your\nhusband your partner your kids your\nparents your aunts or uncles whoever it\nis be themselves fully yeah or\nalternatively if you go around saying\nwell that person is that person and\nthey're not that you're then blocking\nyour own self yeah from being two things\nand i think that's where that's what it\nalways hits me by i'm like we me and my\nfriend were talking yesterday\nand we were having a very frank and\nhonest conversation about\nanother one of our mutual friends who's\nstruggling and\nit was so easy because those\nconversations so often roll into\njudgment\nand criticism\nand feeling holier than dao and like oh\nat least we don't have that problem yeah\nand it's crazy because you can do that\nby people you know\nand me and him just sat down and i and i\nsaid look what i want to do actually to\ngrow this conversation and you said the\nvalue is growth i said i just want to\ntalk about all my flaws right now in\nthis area because i was like only if we\ndo that yeah\nwill i not walk away from this\nconversation thinking i'm better yes\nbecause if i think i'm better guess what\ni don't have to become or grow right\nbecause i already think i made it just\nby talking about someone yeah and so we\nspent the rest of the conversation\nreally talking about our own challenges\nand impediments and flaws in in that\nparticular area we were discussing we\njust realized i was like\ni'm just that person just doesn't know\nabout yeah my flaws yeah so well i think\nthis too with kids is\nit has always been so important for me\nas a mom to give my kids autonomy over\nthemselves\num like they can wear whatever they want\nyes they show up\nthey're so fun to watch\nlike my oldest is in middle school and\nhe is so himself like\nhe wore a\nrevolutionary wig to his school pictures\nhe like shops the goodwill and like\nwears funny t and i just\nnever had that kind of confidence at 14\nyears old he's so himself\nand i was really conscious of that\ni wanted it for them but mostly\ni felt like if they had autonomy over\nwho they were they would give it to\nothers\nso i didn't i grew up in a a really\nreligious yeah like i grew up in a\nreally religious um home and environment\nand city\nand\nit was very much like we know\nthe right way to be and if you're not\nthis way you're wrong\nand i just never wanted my kids to have\nthat i want them to believe that\neverybody is\nvaluable and good and cool and has\npotential and gets to do and be whoever\nthey are\num so yeah i love when he was like can i\nget a wig for i was like yes\nevery year this should just be the thing\nman like let's go and that starts there\nwith wigs and autonomy and then leads to\nforgiveness so yeah if i can forgive\nmyself right i'm more likely to forgive\nothers right right if i forgive others\ni'm more likely to forgive myself well\nto be totally honest i was\nbrutally hard on myself when that\nhappened like i was maybe the lowest\ni've ever been in my adult life i'm for\nreal\nand um\ni because i just felt so ashamed like i\ni can't imagine hurting someone like you\nknow you know how much this work takes\nand how hard this is and showing up and\ndoing all this these things with the\nintention of putting goodness out into\nthe world and positivity and um the\nworst for me was\nfeeling like\num i've worked so hard to create a safe\nspace for my community and having people\nwho felt like it wasn't safe anymore\nlike because i showed up in a way that\nwas different than\nwhat felt safe or right to them and i\njust was dead i was devastated i was\nheartbroken um and i spent\nfor real like a few weeks just like\nwallowing there's no other way to say it\ni was just wallowing in misery and so\nashamed so mad at myself and then one\nday i was like this is not helpful this\nis not helping anybody like you're just\nfeeding into your own narrative you're\nfeeling sorry for yourself you're like\nspinning out you're all of this and so\nyou have to own yes like in life\nsometimes you will make a mistake you\nwill hurt someone else like you have to\nown this you have to hold space for this\nand you have to learn from this\nexperience or it was all wasted like it\nwas all for nothing all this pain all of\nthese people that you hurt this way that\nyou felt embarrassing your kids\nembarrassing your best friends like all\nof this stuff you have to hold this and\nlearn from it or it was for nothing\nand\nit took i mean i i just i want to say\nthat because i don't want anyone to\nthink like oh you flip a switch and then\nyou're fine that's why i was talking\nearlier about transitions for me are\nabout allowing myself to feel it points\nattention yeah i needed a few weeks to\nlike\nbe a weenie and then i had to like okay\ntime to grow like which makes sense\nthat's what you're saying that that\nlevel of\nlike sitting in the paint yeah is all\nproportionate to how big you think the\nimpact yeah ended up being yes right\nif something has massively impacted\nothers\nit is going to take a deeper longer\nprocess of reflection to grow yes yeah\nand so it's in proportion to the impact\nyes and i think in those situations i\ndon't know if you've ever gone through\nsomething like this everybody wants\nlike what's what are you gonna say or\nwhat's the statement or make a podcast\nor whatever and i just i kept telling\neveryone like\nit would be disingenuous it would be at\nthe time right like if i don't actually\nlearn from i can't show you what you\nneed to see right like i can write a\nperfectly\nyou know appropriate response right we\ncan all do that we can write the thing\nand put it out in the world or\ni can actually\nlearn i can actually grow and you can\nsee i hope\nthe evolution as i continue to grow as a\nwoman and and\na sister and a friend and a mama like\ni i want you to see through action\nlike who i am not because i just really\nquickly like gave you the answer\ni just yeah so it was not a fast process\nand it did involve\na lot of self like yeah you're going to\nhave to forgive yourself because you're\nnever going to get better in this and um\nif you don't yeah thank you yeah thank\nyou yeah yeah no i i think that's what\nhappens right it's like the world's\nforcing us\nuh to provide an answer but it's\nactually the behavior that is is what\nyeah is what we're working on yeah\nthat's always what i found like for me\nit's always been about like well what do\ni need to change what do i need to\nfigure out what do i that's always been\nmy focus because that's what actually is\nthe what the universe is trying to tell\nme to do yeah um so well it's sort of\nthat i there's some quote and i don't\nknow who said it and i'm going to\nbutcher this one too but it's\nessentially like an apology without\naction or an apology without change is\nempty it's not real you know if you have\nsomeone in your life who is\ni think we do this in relationships all\nthe time they're like they say they're\nsorry i'm sorry that i did this thing\nbut there's no change they're not then\nit's not actually\nreal\num and it i think it's a really powerful\num thing to process whether you're\nyou know guiding your kids through a\nissue with their friends or you're\ndealing with this in your marriage or\nwhatever it looks like if you\ncontinue to do the same thing that\nsomeone has said this is hurting me\nlike\ni'm going to continue to make mistakes\nin my life of course i'm going to\ncontinue to make mistakes because i'm\ngoing to keep trying and if you're\ncontinuing to try you're going to\ncontinue to make mistakes it's just what\nit is but if you've told someone like if\nmy community says to me rachel you said\nthis thing and this was hurtful and this\nmade us feel these ways and i don't\nchange based on that then i was never\nreally sorry\nif you told your partner that um you\nknow when\nthey lose their temper they do these\nthings or they have too much to drink or\nthey're smoking or whatever and that it\nis hurtful to you and it's sincere and\nyou have a conversation and they say\nthey're sorry and they keep doing it\nagain and again and again it's not a\nreal apology\nand so i do think that there's something\nwe that we need to hold on to of like\nwhat does it look like in our lives to\nactually make change\nbased on what we said\nor who we said we didn't want to be like\nit's as important to know who you don't\nwant to be as this person that you do\nwant to reach for yeah i remember i\nstarted in my spiritual community i\nstarted uh\nmentoring young men quite early on and i\nremember saying to all of them and i\nstill say this to people when i coach\nthem today or when i work with people\nlike one of the first things i say to\nthem after we've agreed to work together\nor or connect is is always just know\nthat i will let you down\nand and the law is just it's it was\nreally\nuseful to me to see their response and\ni'll say i will let you down not because\ni don't care not because i don't love\nyou not because i don't want you to be\nyour best not because i want that to\nhappen but because i'm human yeah that\nwill happen yeah and if you're okay with\nthat then this is this is real right but\nif you have some other\nthen this is actually not gonna work and\nit's been really interesting to me i\nremember when i first used to say that i\nwas probably like 22 or something and\nand there were some people who who\nchanged their mind about me being their\nmentor wow based on that and i used to\nbe like this is great yes because now we\nknow\nat least we're both safe like yeah\nthey're safe now because i've told them\nthe reality of it and and i'm safe now\nbecause i feel and so that's always been\nmy approach to it is just just being\nokay with that yeah and putting it out\nthere and just you know not having any\nother false expectations yeah i'm\ncurious\num\ni'm jump i have just a question for you\num i was curious as you were talking\nabout that because i know you do mentor\nand you coach a lot and that mixed with\nwhat you're doing in the wider community\nin on social and\nyou know with videos and pockets and all\nof it how do you\nmaintain\nyour own energy in the midst of giving\nso much to other people yeah that's a\ngreat question yeah\nyou're like there's a million dollars\nquestions no it's no it's\noh as in this is the obvious answer but\nit's true and it's the start it's\nongoing like it's everyday right so me\nand my wife had a conversation this\nweekend\nand she was just like to me\nuh and my wife's great at this and she\nwas just like i think you need to\nrecommit to these practices like to do\nthem deeply to do them better\nand my ego was just like all right like\nyou know you want to just you just want\nto be like well i do all this and i do\nthis and i was just like nope take it\nseriously and then i recommitted to\ncertain practices and behaviors that i\nmay not have been doing with as much\ndepth and i feel so much better for it\nright and so i think having a wife that\nis\nreally grounded and rooted is is huge\nand so that's just a blessing and i\nlucked out but having that is so\nimportant uh i think another thing for\nme which is probably like the biggest\nthing is my i still speak a lot to my\nmonk mentors and they are just so not\ninterested in anything i do externally\nand i remember my\nyou know one of my monk teachers he said\nto me said\nhe asked me a question he said what are\nyou up to this was probably about i\ndon't know maybe like three years ago\nand he was like well what are you doing\nand so i gave him a long list of like\nall the cool stuff i was doing\nand and he said something really\npowerful to me he said you know for all\nof this i have no expectation and he\nsaid he said i have no expectation for\nwhat you're doing all of this he goes i\nsimply demand the purity of your heart\nand it was just like it was one of those\nmoments where like my heart sank like\nyeah and and it was like a punch in the\ngut and i was just like but it's so much\neasier to give you all this like it's so\nmuch easier to offer all of this\nuh and i think that happens in\nrelationships i think\nuh at least the men that i know are\nalways thinking oh but i'm doing all of\nthis yes and their partner's just like\nbut i just want to feel loved right i\nwant to feel seen i want to feel heard\nand and the men in my life and me it's\nvery easy to be like no but we're doing\nall of this yeah i say you want to be\nthe magician because that's actually\neasier like it's actually easier to do\nthat than do this and so\nhaving my monk teachers in my life has\nbeen a really great one because they're\njust so oblivious to everything and so\nabove and beyond all of this world that\nthey're just a good reminder\nuh and and i think\nlike you're right failures and mistakes\nkeep you on the path so there's another\none like that's partly why they're there\nand i really spend a lot of time alone\nyeah like i really that's my biggest one\nfor regenerating energy and i think\npeople find it uncomfortable because and\ni'm really honest with you i had a\nfriend i have a friend staying with me\nright now who opened the door for you by\nthe way\nand\nhe's such a sweet guy he's been you only\nallow beautiful people around you by the\nway because between you and your wife\nand that guy who opened the door i was\nlike what is happening he's my wife's\nbest they basically grew up together\ntheir moms are best friends and when\nhe's in l.a stays with us but he's been\ntrying to get us to so he's always like\ncan you come visit me can you come do\nthis and i'm always honest with him\nbecause he's such a close friend and he\nlives with us when he's in la so i spend\nplenty of time with him but i'm always\njust like i can't because if i got that\ntime that you want me to come and spend\nwith you i'm gonna take that for myself\nyeah and it's so awkward and\nuncomfortable to say it to people but\ni've got so used to it today i got a\nmessage from someone and they were just\nlike i'd love to spend more time with\nyou and i messed them back saying i\nwould too but my schedule just won't\nallow you yes and when it does i'll\nreach out yeah and i know you do this\nand it's like\ni really love time alone and i crave it\nand i seek it and i\nit's such a big part of my dna\nthat i will i recharge alone i can't\nrecharge around people and when y'all\nstarted dating were you really upfront\nwith her about that yes yeah i feel like\nthat's so important because it's like\nyou're establishing those boundaries in\nthe beginning yeah so there is an\nexpectation of okay i'm the same way i\nlove being alone and so does my i don't\nknow why i'm referencing up the ceiling\nand that was one of the first\nconversations we had was sort of like\nwe're gonna love this time together and\nwe're gonna be really honest about when\nwe do need to decompress\nand there are definitely times where um\nhe'll have come back from a trip and i\nwant to like tackle him immediately and\nhe'll be like i need a day yes and it\nlike i'm sad because i want to see him\nbut i also totally respect and get it\nand that was something that we\nestablished from the very beginning is\nthat like when you're coaching people do\nyou ever\ngive advice on if you've never\nestablished a boundary and maybe it's\nbeing alone or whatever it looks like\nfor you\nhow do you establish a boundary when you\nhaven't done it before yeah i i think\nit's exactly what you just said like it\nis just a status update like it is like\nsaying like this is a new thing for me\nand by the way it doesn't mean i love\nyou less right it's it's saying what it\ndoesn't mean yes as much as what it\nmeans to you and i think the mistake we\ndo reload we say\nthis means so much to me yes i want you\nto value it because it's important to me\nyes and we negate how it is important to\nthem yes so if we say oh how it's\nrelevant to them so if i had a new\nupdate for radi\nand riley had a new update for me\nactually today but if if i had a new\nupdate for her i would say to her riley\ni have this new update and i just want\nyou to know this does not mean i don't\nlove you yeah this does not mean i don't\ncare care for you it doesn't mean that i\ndon't love spending time with you it\njust means i'm exhausted yeah that's\nwhat this means yeah and that helps\nsomeone rather than saying you know what\ni'm so overworked and i've been doing so\nmuch that i need this time yes and that\nperson's going oh so you'd rather have\nthat time than time with me yes and\nthat's what they're thinking yeah and so\nyou can help the person with their\nthought process\nby answering all their unsaid questions\nyes without them saying it so it\nobviously doesn't always work out that\nperfectly yeah but i think that it's a\nstatus update and you can change i think\nat the beginning of lockdown radhi and i\nhad completely different expectations\nthan we've ever had before exactly we've\nnever lived together for this long yeah\nin one place yeah and so we had to set\nnew boundaries around cleanliness about\nchores about housekeeping all that kind\nof stuff that we haven't had to do for a\nlong time because we're always moving\naround yeah and so i think every time\nthere's a change or a transition or a\npoint of tension it's because you\nhaven't made someone aware of your new\npriorities right and how it affects them\nyeah it's it's the same as us doing\nthings like going on tour or writing a\nbook like i always preempt i'll always\nsay to we've been talking about like we\nhaven't seen our family for a long time\nyeah and so we've been trying to go back\nto london and me and radha have been\ntalking and i was like but if we go back\nthen\nwe have this priority and so we're\nthinking ahead and i'm like just you\nknow this is what we plan to do in\nseptember yeah i\ni just don't think there's any\nsubstitute for\nbeing honest up front and and resetting\nyour actual needs yes as opposed to\npretending yeah that yeah that's fine\nand then expecting the person to know\nyou're stressed out and then figure it\nout right and that's a long answer to it\nright no and i think it's a it's sort of\nlike a habit or a muscle to build like\nanything else that if you haven't done\nit before it is really hard to learn to\nsay no yeah and\nto allow yourself to frustrate people or\nhave them be disappointed or maybe even\nhurt their feelings unintentionally\nbecause you need to hold that space for\nyourself\nbecause i i am so with you if you are\ndoing something where you're serving\nother people you're around a lot of\nother energy or however that is you have\nto have that time where you go\nsort of refill in whatever way makes the\nmost sense for you\num because i think that other people\nwill\nwe we see life right as as we are not as\nit actually is and so even um what i\nthink of is like when i'm going through\na hard season if i'm going through grief\nor when i went through the divorce\nanytime i'm going through something hard\ni want to be alone yeah i do not want to\nbe around and it is how i process yes\nand i have girlfriends who they process\ngrief for pain in groups yes and so all\nthey want to do in the world is bring me\nsoup or wine or sit with me or talk it\nout\nand it is so hard to navigate\nthey're really trying to love you well\nand they're trying to love you in the\nway that makes sense to them and having\nto be so clear\nabout\nthank you and i love you and i promise\nyou i'm gonna call when i'm ready but\nthis is how i need to handle these\nthings yes um and it you are allowed to\ndo those\nprocesses exactly how it works for you\nand it's\nnot selfish and i think that that's what\nis put on most of us is that you wanting\ntime alone\naway from your wife or me wanting time\nalone away from my kids that that would\nbe a selfish choice because you're not\nshowing up for those other people when\nthe reality is\nnone of us can serve those we love well\nif we're depleted totally i feel like i\nwant to and i also want to give my best\nto people right so you're just exhausted\nand drained i i think about it like gary\nchapman's love language yeah it's almost\nlike this is pain languages right like\nhow do you process pain yes and like i\nknow that radhi likes to have sp if\nwe're having an argument rather we'll\nwant to have space and time to reflect\nyeah and i want to talk it out like i'm\nlike all right let's figure this out\nyeah let's figure this out and she's\nlike i just don't i need to just think\nabout it like i just need to reflect and\nthink otherwise i'm going to say\nsomething i don't want to say or\nwhatever it is and it took me a while to\nrealize that that wasn't because she\ndidn't i'd always be like you don't want\nto talk about because you don't care as\nmuch as\nand that's the problem you see it as a\nsign of care i go oh just because you\ndon't want to talk about it right now\nthat means you don't care about this\nrelationship as much as i do yeah this\nis not true yeah you you care about it\nas much as i do yeah that's why you\ndon't want to that's why you're being\nintentional yeah what is your love\nlanguage by the way my love language is\nokay so i\nit's adapted and i've talked about this\nso my top love language and i realized\nit was from when i was growing up was\ngifts and it was because my mom we\ndidn't have a lot but when we were\ngrowing up on my birthday my mom would\nalways get me the one gift that i'd\nand it was such a big moment and she'd\nalways surprised me but here's where it\ngot interesting i realized that the\nvalue was not gifts it was surprises oh\nit wasn't the actual thing yes it was\nthe feeling that someone had thought\nabout me in in like disguise and then\nmade me feel special so it was surprised\ni put surprise at the top but it's gifts\nin the five yes uh and then the other\none has always been words of affirmation\nyeah words of affirmation is huge for me\nyeah it took me ages for my ego to admit\nthat yeah\nbecause it felt so like oh that's so\nlame like i want to be told like and i\nwas like no i actually really like to be\ntold by the people i love how i make\nthem feel yes and that's great like\nbecause i'm good at giving words of\naffirmation too and i want that so those\nare my topics yeah how about yours so\nit's interesting mine was words of\naffirmation forever\nand then\nhowever this sounds but when my career\nreally exploded beginning of\n2018 um\nall i got were words yes and so it sort\nof stopped having meaning i agree that\nmakes sense um and so my\nnumber one now is acts of service like\nif you bring me a cup of coffee if you\num you know help with the dish it like\nif you just do something that's really\nhelpful that is it just makes me feel so\ntaken care of and loved and appreciated\ni just that's that's a big one for me\nand\ninterestingly um\nwhen i first went on like when i first\nstarted hanging out with the guy um i\nwas explaining to him what what love\nlanguages were because he had never\nheard of it because you know me i don't\nknow if you do this but i'm like what's\nyour enneagram number\nyeah um so\nwe're walking and i'm trying to explain\nall these things and i with love\nlanguages you don't need to take a test\nyou can tell someone and they're like\nso he's like oh i'm words of affirmation\nso i'm thinking great that that feels\nwhatever and then as every time we would\nhang out he would be like oh i saw this\nand i thought of you or like oh you said\nyou like this kind of coffee or what\nevery time you show up at my house with\njust some little thing and i was like no\nyou're gifts you're not words your gifts\nbecause he just did it always and on a\nrandom whatever i like showed up at his\nhouse one day with coffee and he acted\nlike i had brought him a million dollars\nand i was like oh your gifts yeah buddy\nthis is actually what you care so here's\nhow it but it's just such a powerful\ntool for friends or even members of your\nteam to understand how to like love them\nwell and lead them well and doing it for\npain too that's why i think we've\nuncovered what you're saying today like\nknowing that oh when we're in pain yes\nrachel needs space yes but rachel's\nfriends need to talk yeah\nand this friend needs two friends this\nfriend needs drinks and a party right\nfriends right distraction yeah whatever\nit is and like we judge\nhow we process pain and how we want to\nbe loved yeah and it's it's not selfish\nit's it's real and so yeah i'm really\nglad that we stumbled upon that because\nit's a good one maybe that's your next\nbook hang languages yeah no i i don't\nyeah it's just i i do think there's\nsomething about\nlearning how people process pain yeah\nand being okay with how they want to do\nit yes which is beautiful yeah and not\nmaking that process not making their\nprocess of pain about you yes because we\ndo do that all the time it's like you\nwere saying earlier about someone\nwanting space or someone asking to hold\na boundary\nand you somehow making that about them\nand what you need in this process or um\ni think this a lot in a new relationship\nbecause\nmy um do you know about attachment yes\nyes okay\nso\num i'm anxious attachment yeah it is\navoidant anxious\n[Applause]\n[Laughter]\nand he's like whatever the chill one is\nhe's just like chill and happy and fine\nand i'm anxious about everything and i\ndo if you if you don't know what we're\ntalking about you're listening to this\nyou gotta look it up there's a great\nbook called i think it's called the\nattachment attachment or attached\nfor you\nhe would do something or ask for\nsomething and i would be like oh\nhe doesn't like reading more i said\nsomething soon whatever\nand so what's really helpful for me\nwhen i'm having those moments or just i\nthink this in life is just to ask like\nact as if or give the benefit of the\ndoubt or what if what they're saying is\nactually totally truthful now certainly\nthere are times in life where we're\ninteracting with someone and our\nintuition is telling us this is not a\ngood person there's something wrong here\nyou need to listen to that but i do\nthink when it's sort of my mind running\naway with me that it has been so helpful\nto just hey rach act as if\nthis person is good and honest and and\nmature and has done a lot of therapy and\nis literally just telling you what they\nneed instead of playing games with you\nyeah um because you have no reason to\nbelieve otherwise and\nthat can shut off my anxiety about that\nmoment or me making it about me\nthat fast because i'm like oh yeah\nyou're being ridiculous\nyeah no i i think there are there are\ncertain things like the love languages\nattached the attachment styles like if\nyou know them\nin an early stage in a relationship yes\nfor you and your partner it can save you\nso much time\nand unfortunately\nwe feel geeky or cheesy or lame to talk\nabout these things but it's like that's\nactually what's going to help yes\nbecause if you know your partner\nhas an anxious attachment style you're\nnow going to be more conscious of that\nyes you're going to know\nhow to behave with them and speak to\nthem in their language in a way that's\ngoing to help them feel secure right i\nthink it's called secure\nno i think it's called attached no no no\ni think it's called the secure\nattachment style yeah i think it's\nattached avoided and secure i think\nthat's the word yeah yes you are correct\ni think that's the word yeah that's the\nthird word secure like and but that's\nthe whole point right it's like if you\nknow\nthat someone is an avoidant person a\npersonality type attachment type you\nknow how to make them feel more secure\nyes rather than being like oh they're\njust weird or they've got something\nwrong with them right you know right all\nthose terms well i it's interesting have\nyou ever i don't know if this sort of\nfalls in i feel like we read all the\nsame books\ndo you know um um\nis it tim grover tim grover yeah\nso i am not into sports but i love\nunderstanding how athletes at the\nhighest level function i'm just\nfascinated by it don't know anything\nabout football it is another level right\nlike tom brady right i don't so if\npeople i don't know anything about\nfootball but\nhow in the world\nat his age\nand even more importantly and more\nimpressive to me is how can you have won\nthat much\nand still have the drive to keep winning\nlike i'm with a new team oh my gosh like\nfascinated by what it takes\nbecause i think\nif you've ever pushed to sort of a high\nlevel in your career let's say or maybe\nfor an athlete or whatever what you\nunderstand is that\nstaying at that level or even evolving\npast that level is a million times\nharder than it was to get there\nit's so much more difficult because it\ntakes like\nsomething other and so i'm fascinated by\nuh kobe or michael jordan or just serena\nwilliams like how in the hell do they\nmaintain so\ni don't know if you'd like these books\nbecause they're pretty intense but i\nlove tim grover's work and um\ni was i interviewed him the other day\nand i was geeking out so hard and i was\ntelling him that the first time i read\nuh his first book which is called\nrelentless which is this pers relentless\npursuit of excellence and trying so hard\nand whatever i\nit was like a\nout of body experience like i felt like\ni was reading\nsomething i could have written and i\nfelt i don't know if you've ever had a\nmoment where you're\nreading something or listening and\nyou're like i thought i was the only one\nyeah and he was explaining things that i\njust had never sort of this\nsounds terrible and someone can do\ntherapy with me later but like\nthat i would achieve something and maybe\nyou have a bit of this as an achiever\nbut i would achieve something and\nimmediately what's the next thing\nthat's done like we did it what's the\nnext thing and um i so i was reading\nthis book and i loved it it's the only\ntime in my life i finished a book and\nimmediately started it again wow and i\ngave it to my ex-husband\nand we were married at the time and i\nwas like this book\nexplains me like this is it read this\nbook\nand i was telling tim that he dave was\nthey've read it and i remember him\nlooking up and looking at me like i was\nan alien\nlike\nwhat the hell like what\nand\nthat's nothing against dave yeah yeah um\nbut i was telling tim this like oh i\nfelt seen and like and then he read it\nand looked at me like i was an alien and\ntim was like oh\nthat's actually\nway more\na reflection of you yeah\nand you being in a relationship where\nyour partner didn't know who you\nactually were\nlike that's way more telling about you\nthan it is about him right right and i\npart of that is we got together so young\nand i just had evolved so much you\nchanged so much i mean you've got like\nright i mean how old were you in your\nfirst date you said i met him when i was\n18. yeah so it's like at 18 you really\ndo not know who you are no like no one\nno\num but i just thought that was so\ninteresting of how many times in\nrelationships\nyour\nyour partner\nreally sees you as who they think you\nare instead of who you actually are and\nhow much\ntension in a relationship happens\nbecause you're trying to be you\nand they think that you're actually this\nper i don't know i just i thought that\nwas so fast well i think sometimes\nyou're and i'm so glad you brought this\nup i and i want to read that book i\nthink sometimes\nyou actually are becoming more of the\nversion they think you are\nso you're i think in a relationship\noften like if your partner sees you as\nloving and caring and homemaking right\nyou start becoming more of that to try\nand be who they love yes and they do it\nback and that's considered a good thing\nright but actually what ends up\nhappening is there's a whole part of you\nthat's being underserved yes and then\nwhen they discover that they're like who\nare you i don't even know who you are\nyes and and i can relate to that so\nbecause i met\nme and rodney met when i was 20 21 but\nwe\nstarted dating when i left being amongst\ni was 26. okay and so\nbut when i left being a monk that's when\ni felt the most self-aware so when i met\nradi i was really clear i was like this\nis what i care about my purpose comes\nfirst this is where what i and it wasn't\nabout achievements like i didn't have\nlike goals it was more just like this is\nwho i am\nand i'm more likely to choose this over\nthis if we had the choice yes and and i\nremember having all the and i have not\nchanged a bit like i'm the exact same\nperson and rather we will testify to\nthat we should be like yeah you're the\nsame guy married just maybe on steroids\na bit but but like you know you're the\nsame person\nand raleigh has actually changed more\nso radhi's changed more when i met radi\nshe was very much like she just wanted\nto be a homemaker\nand now it's like she's like got her\ncareer growing she's doing really well\nand it's and i've found that because i'm\nso\nstill and steady in my space\ni'm able to appreciate and support yeah\nas opposed to feel threatened or scared\nor confused right or like you're not the\nperson right because i'm seeing her go\nthrough what i went through back then\nand i'm seeing her find herself yeah\nwhich is actually so beautiful to watch\nbut it's only beautiful to watch if\nyou're doing that yourself exactly and\notherwise it's really scary because your\nworld starts to change right it's like\nyour world's getting shaken yes because\nall of a sudden that that person you\nthought was\nthis\nis not that anymore and i i know for\nwomen in my community especially and i'm\nsure this happens with men but i know\nwith women there's often this\nmassive tension of their beginning to\nchange and evolve and their partner\nusually a man\nis really struggling and it's exactly\nwhat you're saying because that man\nmaybe hasn't gone through his own\nevolution and so she begins to change\nand he's terrified so it's like well if\nyou're gonna change are you gonna change\nin such a way that you leave me behind\nand then it's sort of like holding on\ntighter and\nyou know\nthat honestly that was a a massive um\ncatalyst for why i'm not married today\nis i mean there's a million factors\nobviously but\nhe met\nan 18 year old and when we got married\nwhen i was 20 i guess yeah yeah\num\ni all i wanted was to be his wife and to\nhave babies and to\nhere's the home and i'm gonna work but\nobviously this is what it is and\nthat's sort of like who he signed on for\nyes that's what it is and he was a\nmassive cheerleader of mine and a dear\nfriend and whatever but it just kept\nshifting\nto such a place where it felt like\nin order for this thing to work i had to\nkeep pretending to still be that woman\nand i'm not like she's gone she's so far\ngone and i can like play that role and i\nwould play that role but then there was\num so much resentment there because i\nfeel like i'm trying to fit into a\ncertain box in order to accommodate the\nvision that you have of me and then when\ni step outside of that box or i do\nsomething\nthat feels threatening and just is too\nmuch space to hold there so\ni it's interesting one of the things i\nhope most for my kids and this is maybe\na random thing\nbut i hope that they find the person\nthat they want to partner with long term\nlater in their life like i hope that\nthey have that time to\nfigure out who they are in a way that\ni really didn't and i think is very\ncommon in definitely like in southern\nculture and sort of how i grew up oh my\ngosh heck yeah even in indian culture\nyeah yeah and so you are growing up\ntogether but that can cause tension if\nsort of one of you is growing in a way\nthat the other is not yeah yeah i'm so\nglad yeah and i'm so happy that\nlike you said like you've both and you\nknow i i love dave yeah and it's like\ni'm so happy that you've both\nseen how\nthis isn't a failure oh and your\nfriendship and your connection for your\nkids just i think it's\nit's so beautiful to see that and and\ni'm i'm glad that we need to stop seeing\nthe end of things as failures right it's\nlike do you see the end of your favorite\nshow\nas a failure yeah you don't it's a\ncelebration and there's nostalgia and\nyou miss it but it wasn't a failure\nbecause the show ended yes there's no\nshow with never-ending seasons there's\nshows that have eight seasons four and\ntwelve well also it's crazy to think\nthat success is length of time oh which\nis terrible it's a terrible relationship\nlike metronome for people people who've\nbeen together for 25 years and they're\nmiserable terrible metric for a\nrelationship yes absolutely and that's\nwhat i when when bill and melinda\ndivorced recently yes and i don't know\nwhy i said that like i know that yeah no\nno neither do i i don't know either uh\nbut when melinda gates said that and\nthis you know i'm again i'm not\ncommenting on their\nanything else i don't know them i'm just\ncommenting on this one statement yeah uh\nshe said that you know we realized we\nhad nothing more to learn from each\nother oh wow and i was just like that's\nbeautiful i love that yeah i was like\nwhat a great and you know it was like\nthe picture that had been put up in the\npress was like a broken glass picture of\nthem right right i was like come on like\nyeah that's actually a really good\nlesson like if we're not learning from\neach other then we probably shouldn't be\ntogether yeah and i i don't know i just\ni love that you guys have found that way\nand it makes me really happy as you know\nas a friend of both of you yeah and\nseeing that and just seeing how\nwonderful you all both are independently\ntoo yes and i think like it's so\nrad\num watching him in his new relationship\ntruly like from the beginning i'm just\nlike hell yeah like i think it would be\nreally surprising to people how much\nwe sort of talked about that or what it\nlooks like and to i think there's\nsomething so beautiful about\nhim having someone who is meeting him as\nhe is today\nand because that's a gift for me in my\nlife this man met me right now not 20\nyear old version like 20 years ago me\nbut like who i am right now today this\nis who\nhe's getting to me and the same for dave\nand having a girlfriend who's just like\nyou're the best so this is awesome and\nit's so cool to see\nhim have someone who like shares\nhis hobbies and the things that he's\ninto whatever like look at this this is\nso great\num so yeah i just i refuse to see it as\nsomething that's bad because i think\nmy god it has been such a ride and we\nwill be family for the rest of our lives\nwe've got four kids like we're a family\nwe're about to have\na crazy thanksgiving with like i love it\nhis girlfriend all her family my like\nall it's just we're figuring it out\num and there's something beautiful about\nthat process but\ni don't think that's possible if you\nsort of see it all as this negative\nthing or this it all went awry or it all\nwent badly and it's not to say that it\nwasn't painful and it's not to say it\nwasn't hard on our kids and all of the\nthings to navigate and figure out but um\nyeah this was just what that chapter of\nour lives looked like yeah i love that\nrachel i could talk to you for hours and\nhours and hours i'm in love with this\nbroadcast\nyeah i am going to\nlean into the final five these are your\nrapid fire fast five oh my gosh okay so\nyou can only answer the questions with\none word or one sentence maximum okay\none sentence is like ten words okay i'm\ngonna try and do one i don't know what a\ndefinition is of a sentence uh but\nrachel hollis these are your final fives\nokay\nokay question number one what is the\nbest advice you've ever received\nthe best advice i've ever received um\nokay\nthis was not given to me directly but my\nfavorite quote and this is i'm going to\ntake his advice was from oprah\nwhen i was a teenager i saw her say this\nand i thought it and lived it ever since\nthere is no such thing as luck there is\nonly preparation meeting opportunity at\na moment in time and i've spent my life\npreparing for those moments that's\nbeautiful i love that and it was so\ngreat to see you both on stage as well\nso i love that okay question number two\nwhat's the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\ni know exactly what it is um my mom\nalways told me that um if if your\nhusband doesn't get you what you want\nfor christmas\njust tell him like if you want something\njust buy the gift yourself she would\nalways just tell me like basically sort\nof saying you can fix him and kind of\nmake him who you want to be\nand i am conscious of this now because i\nnow know what it's like to date someone\nwho gets you exactly as you are and that\nyou don't have to explain anything to\nand so i consider that really bad advice\nyou shouldn't try and mold someone to be\nwho you want them to be beautiful all\nright question number three how would\nyou define in one sentence your current\npurpose\nto\nmake as many beautiful memories as\npossible with the people i love i love\nthat that's a beautiful purpose all\nright question number four uh what's the\nnext thing you're most excited to learn\nor what's something you're currently\nlearning that's new to you and\nthat's exciting\nletting go of my attachment to the\noutcome hmm that is a big one for you\nright now\nwe can talk about that\nquestion number five the fifth and final\nquestion is if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\nwe are not allowed to care about what\nother people think of us\ni've been amazing i think that would\nchange the world and i think that if we\ncould give that to our children\nto not be concerned with other people's\nopinions it would change everything\nit's amazing rachel hollis on on purpose\nrachel thank you so much for doing
