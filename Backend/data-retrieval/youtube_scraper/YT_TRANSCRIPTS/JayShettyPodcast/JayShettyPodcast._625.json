    "transcript": "why not me and why can't i be\nintelligent why do i feel so unworthy i\nwould say that that is still something i\nstill struggle with you know when you\ndon't see yourself in\npositions of power even in entertainment\nthe way that you know you see women and\nyou see people of color portrayed that's\nhow you're going to see yourself in a\nway in a lot of ways and that's also\nmore importantly how other people will\nsee you and so they're going to treat\nyou accordingly and you just kind of\nhave to break through\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe

enough to share with\nus how you and your family have been\nable to cope through this very difficult\ntime and having so many people being\naffected\ni basically got it from\nbeing in a small\njuice shop\nand uh\nthere was one other person in there that\nwas sick obviously and uh and so that's\nhow i got it and i was one of those\nfortunate cases where it wasn't um you\nknow severe symptoms uh\nbut\nuh and it you know truly isolating and\nbeing careful and wearing a mask\nreally does\nkeep other people safe and even in my\nown home that's that was the case\nyou have to wear a mask\naround especially elderly people\nand you and you just have to be safe and\nyou just have to get vaccinated um so\nit's not worth it i can say like just\nbased off of the\nwhat happened to my family it's just not\nworth it and and if if you can get\nvaccinated i highly recommend it\num just to in any way keep yourself from\ngetting as sick as people did in my\nfamily yeah well we're sending our\nprayers and love to you jessica and\neveryone in your family and and everyone\nin thank you who's listening and\nwatching who also lost someone during\nthis time and you know i've shared some\nof my stories on the podcast of people\nthat i lost as well so thank you for\nsharing that really important message\njessica as well from\nfrom your experience you know you've\nplayed so many roles in your life you\nknow you're an actor you're an\nentrepreneur you're a mother you're a\nfamily person like you you play so many\nroles what i'm interested in is\nwhich one of these roles has created the\ngreatest growth and development in your\nlife which role has had the biggest\nimpact on you\nas an individual jessica i would say all\nof it right\nbased every stage of my life um\ni feel like i've always had i think you\nwant you have to have the mindset or or\nthe mental\nfor ev you know wanting to evolve and\nwanting to get better and i think i was\njust born with that right\num and i also was\npretty early on i had a consciousness\nabout purpose\nand and this this feeling that you know\nwe're all here for a reason\num life is precious and\nat any moment right it can go um or\nyou're here and so what are you gonna do\nwith the life that that you're given the\nopportunity to live so\nas far back as i had any sort of\nreal understanding of of myself and a\nconsciousness i felt like\ni had a i had a purpose i didn't know\nwhat it was i came from very simple\nhumble\num\nfamily\nand uh\nyou know i what i've done in my life and\nwhat i've i've achieved was in no way\nshape or form given to me\nhanded to me i mean i think if anything\nthere was nothing but\nblocks and challenges and walls and\nreasons why i shouldn't\ndream or even have the audacity to think\nthat i could become anything\nevery stage of every piece of my life i\nfeel like i'm always looking to be\nbetter and do better so when i\nactually got the opportunity to\nbe an actress at the age of 12\nand um i started working on the on a\nregular basis\num i would you know\nwhat i prayed a lot you know whether\nit's god or spirit or whatever it is\nthat people pray to\num i felt like if i could just channel\nlike\ni want to do good i know i'm here to do\ngood i'm not sure what that end goal is\nbut i promise that if i get\nany breakthrough um i will do good with\nwith my success and i always attributed\nsuccess with with being\nable to do good\nand uh and then when i became a mom\num\nyou know that\nreally my sense of self and i would say\nmy insecurities as a person\num over\nsilly things um\nreally sort of\nkept me i think from fully realizing my\npotential before i became a mom but when\ni became a mom those insecurities sort\nof went away\nand\nand i think it unlocked a piece and then\nhaving a successful\nbusiness also\num\nunlocked another piece\nfor me that is such a\nbeautiful\nfoundation to start anything from\nbecause it's so open i think often we\nstart thinking that a purpose is\nsomething specific and it's dialed in\nand it's focused and there's a clear\ngoal\nand often that can actually take us away\nfrom that innocence and that joy and\nthat impact where do you think that came\nfrom for you was it your parenting was\nit something you experienced as a child\nwhere did that\nintention to do something good come from\nand that desire to have a positive\nimpact come from you know i think\nbecause it was\nsuch a struggle and so hard for my\nparents they were young when they had me\nand every day was a very it was a very\nkind of tumultuous environment just\nbecause they were in survival mode every\nday struggling to get by and they also\ndidn't have\nnecessarily the maturity or the tools\nto have context\nso if it's like they were they were just\nkind of like grabbing at anything right\nand and they were constantly sort of\nlike getting in their own way or\nyou know it was just a lot um and their\nrelationship is very much like they love\nto fight and make up fight and make up\nfight and make up and that's their\ndynamic right\num and you know it it was uh\nconfusing for me as a kid because i\ndidn't know that that was their dynamic\nyou know and i also didn't know that\nlike\ni think i just wanted uh peace and i\nwanted security and i wanted a sense of\num\nsecurity to me meant that\nyou could then have\npeace and not be so stressed out\nand so\ni think that to me was like how are some\npeople born into families where\nit's not like this\nand and others are and then given just\nyou know i can't do anything about the\ncircumstance i was born into how can i\nsort of like\nchange that narrative or create the life\nthat i that i felt um\nyou know i wanted to live\num and i think in the process of wanting\na different\nway to to operate right\num\ni also\nknew that like my parents in a lot of\nways were\njust sort of like products of certain\nsystems when you have to support a\nfamily\nhow can you sort of like get ahead um\nand\nthey were learning as they were going\nyou know it's sort of like flying the\nplane and fixing it at the same time\num and so you know they they did the\nbest they could\nand um\nyou know i have a lot of it wasn't until\ni became a parent i think that i had i\nreally understood\nhow difficult it was for them\num just being so young and not\nnecessarily having the tools and not\nhaving\nyou know their a setup right to thrive\nyeah no i i couldn't agree with you more\nwe\ndid a podcast last year and it was\ncalled\nthe six reasons you need to\ndevelop the emotional skills your\nparents didn't have a chance to develop\nbecause the idea is they didn't have\nthat opportunity they didn't have the\nhindsight they didn't have the\nexperiences do you find that as being a\nparent that you're able now to\nshow your children like this balanced\nview of peace and obviously anxiety and\nstress and pressure and all the\nincredible things that you're achieving\nbecause you're a high performer you're\nextremely busy are you are you kind of\nhaving that conversation with them so\nthat they understand you a bit more tell\nus a bit about that yeah there's there's\ndefinitely a like\na woke-ness or a self-awareness that\nhappens when people\nit's like before it was only the select\nfew they get to be global citizens\nwe're now uh because of\nyou know\naccess that people have to information\nwe all are global citizens there is um\naccess to so much information about how\nto\ndo things better and be better and be\nmore effective be happier right um and\nso you know\nlike this podcast right\nthere wasn't this podcast and my parents\nwere you know young there were we live\nnow in a culture where um so many\nso much of the stuff that just wasn't\nsort of serving humanity has been broken\ndown and there's this generation um\nthat's sort of\nthinking through like\ni guess sort of like\nyes we built\nthese civilizations based off of like\nnecessity a lot of these things that are\npower and ego driven right um but now\nwe're in a place where it's a more about\ncompassion mindfulness right openness\nand that's how we're going to thrive\nand and you know continue to thrive as\nas a human race\num and and so i think\nyou know for my kids\ni try to exemplify\nuh whatever that is and and at the same\ntime you know they are very aware of my\nfaults right they're very aware that i\nyou know get stressed and i you know get\nirritable and i don't sleep enough and\nall of those things um but\nyou know we have a we have a dialogue\nabout it and and\nyou know i try to create a space of\ncompassion um\nobviously\nfor\nfor them but also you know just for them\nto to sort of like\nknow that i'm trying i'm at least trying\nyou know\nit's a wonderful thing i think if\nchildren know that you're trying like\nyou said kids are so self-aware i don't\nhave children yet uh with my wife but\nbut we plan on having them and it's\ni i can only look at it from seeing my\nfriends or having been a child myself\nand always wondering like you know kids\nare so aware but if you make them a part\nof the dialogue and they they feel like\nyou're honest with them and everything\nthat you just mentioned i think that\ncreates such a it creates a healthier\nhonest space in an open space rather\nthan an unhealthy environment where\nthere seems to be too much hierarchy or\ntoo much control or too much limitation\nyou said creating an environment of\ncompassion i think\nyou know for children to grow up in an\nenvironment where they can be\ncompassionate on themselves too\ni i think that is such a you know that's\nsuch a brilliant\nbrilliant energy to grow up around i i\nwonder jessica when you were going\nthrough transitions because\nwhen i look at your work and your career\nand your journey and your purpose there\nhave been so many transitions along the\nway\nuh which transition made you feel the\nmost\ninsecure\na sense of imposter syndrome i feel\nthese are things that people people\nstruggle with that so much today people\nare you know everyone's trying to\ni think everyone's been trying to switch\ntheir career they're trying to become\nsomething they didn't train to be there\nand and i feel that you'd have some\nreally good words that's the story of my\nlife\num i felt like i had imposter syndrome\nalways uh in everything at every stage\nuh from like you know going to school\nwith kids who i you know\nwhen i got out of the when we got out of\nthe military uh when i was nine we moved\ninto my grandparents house and it was\nlike a predominantly\nwhite\nyou know middle-class uh suburb and\nthere just weren't people that looked\nlike us you know we were living in my\ngrandparents house that was like a very\ndifferent circumstance than most people\nmost people had like you know domestic\nhelp and they had like all the things\nand their parents were had you know\nthese established careers and were a\nlittle bit older and\num and they were you know mostly white\nand so coming from like uh\nwith us you know i'm we're living my\ngrandparents would stay with us half the\nweek and you know my parents are\nin a way like children when they're\naround the parents right and then we're\nthe children as well so\nthere was like this very different so i\nfelt like an imposter syndrome there for\nsure and then when i started acting i\nwas like\nyou know\ni guess\ni always felt like maybe i did i guess i\nfelt like i didn't belong and hollywood\ndidn't\nmake space for people that looked like\nme or were me you know they'd called me\num exotic right it was like even the\nword uh mexican-american or like\nyou know\nlatina like that was like\nsuch a specific thing to be\nthat and it was like\nnot me and i was like wait a minute but\nthere's a lot of people that are like me\nthat are here you know um in this\ncountry but it's just hollywood didn't\nrecognize it and so i didn't even have a\nplace in hollywood and i remember um\ntwice uh um presenting at the uh at the\noscars\nand i just felt so uncomfortable\nbackstage i was like i just want to get\nup i just want to do the thing and i\njust want to leave\nand i was like and i was with my husband\nwho was my boyfriend at the time and i\nwas like oh my god and and i there were\na few actors\nthat could tell how sort of nervous i\nwas and they were so sweet and then i\njumped into being an entrepreneur and\nagain i'm in rooms where i'm the only\nwoman i've never done this before\neveryone has like\nyou know fancy degrees um from business\nschools and ivy leagues and\ni've you know never had a desk job\ndidn't do any of that i stopped i got my\nged and i you know um started working so\nyoung and so\ni'm sitting here um\nagain trying to find my way and\nabout three years into honest\ni\nlearned the operations of the business\ncompletely and in all the meetings where\nmy you know business partners were like\nno no no you do the\nthe that thing and we're gonna do this\nthing and i uh basically\nsaid no i'm gonna i'm gonna figure this\nout i'm gonna learn and i learned um and\nthen i challenged them\nthat didn't make sense and\nthen i was like you know what i'm maybe\nmaybe i do belong and maybe i am smart\nand maybe i do deserve to be here\num and maybe people are just judging me\nbased off of like their own insecurities\nyou know but it took me quite a bit to\nsort of like get to that place and at\nthat point i i was like 30 so you're 33\ni think i was like 34\nwhen it all kind of like\nstarted to come together and i had two\nkids by then\nand uh two careers you know\nand and it took me a hot minute you know\nyeah that's amazing what i i think\nthat's a great lesson for all of us in\npatience around\nyou know we are going to feel that\nimposter syndrome we are going to feel\nthat insecurity and\nwhat i'm\nwhat i'm hearing from you is it's not\nreally like oh this is what i did and\nthis broke it through and this is what i\ndid it was more just you had to be\npatient with yourself and you had to\nallow it to naturally\ndevelop when you found your home in\nhonest and your kind of like sacred\nspace in creating honest that feels like\nsuch a strong foundation to to who you\nare today and such the bigger part of\nyour story and a big part of your story\nyeah it wasn't like an overnight it was\nsort of like along the way and then when\ni started like making space for like\nwhy not me and why can't i be\nintelligent why do i\nwhy do i feel so unworthy you know or i\ndon't deserve this\num and\nyou know i think over the years i'm\nstill i mean i would say that that is\nstill something i still struggle with\nyou know when you don't see yourself in\npositions of power\nand um even in entertainment the way\nthat\nyou you know you see women and you see\npeople of color portrayed that's how\nyou're going to see yourself in a way in\na lot of ways that's and that's also\nmore importantly how other people will\nsee you and so they're going to treat\nyou accordingly\nand you just kind of have to break\nthrough\nyeah and i guess that's what you're\nsaying that confidence is just built on\nnot thinking about what everyone else is\nsaying or thinking or believing that's\nthat's literally the only thing that\nbreaks you through yeah cause they're\njust products of their own stuff yeah\nright\nyeah everyone's living in their own echo\nchambers and their own ceilings and\ntheir own yeah absolutely absolutely i\nobviously you called your company the\nhonest company i was interested to ask\nyou something i i hope you've never been\nasked before but the around the idea of\nyou know what's the most difficult thing\nyou've had to be honest with someone\nabout\nyou know when it when has it been most\ndifficult to be honest with someone\nbecause it's such a beautiful value and\nbeautiful quality but at the same time\nit can be a really hard quality to\npractice and i don't just mean in your\ncompany i mean just generally like tell\nus how you handle that when you have to\nreally be honest with someone but it's\nit's a challenge i've learned i think\nover the years how to\num\nprobably starting with myself um it's\nlike that inner dialogue of how you talk\nabout yourself\nand how you\n[Music]\nsort of like treat yourself\nand give\nspace for yourself and when i started\nspeaking honestly to myself and being\nreal with myself in a kind way\nit it helped um then me do that with\neveryone around me\nright um but when i'm my inner dialogue\nis so like boom boom boom like harsh\nthen that kind of that's the way the\nhonesty comes out\nright with\nthe way that i\ncommunicate and interact with other\nfolks um it's it's a beautiful value to\nbe honest but i think\nit can be like you said\ntough to take when it's delivered\num\nthrough the lens of harshness\num what what has been heart what has\nbeen who's been or what's been the most\ndifficult thing about honesty\ni mean i don't know i actually really\nlove honesty\nand for me it's sort of the starting\npoint to being able to then move forward\nif you're not if you don't have that\nclarity of honesty of any situation or\ncircumstance\nthen you're just living in a delusion um\nyou know then it's hard to like grasp\nyou're sort of on shaky ground feels\nlike a solid foundation to then move\nfrom\nyeah absolutely no i can agree with you\nmore i love the idea of\nthe more honest we are with ourselves\nthe easier it is to be honest with\nothers and i think honestly something\nthat we often say we want but then when\nwe receive it we're like no no don't\ntell me that you know it's we we kind of\nhave this like you said the double-edged\nsword is a perfect way of describing it\nas a value in quality because often\npeople will say i wish people were more\nhonest with me i wish people would tell\nme the truth\nbut then when they hear the truth or\nsomeone's honest with them\nit's quite hard to to take it in even if\nit's yeah yeah so you're saying it's\ninteresting like you i i've heard you\ntalk about when you were in the\ncorporate world you got a coach\nand you probably had to see yourself in\na very honest way\nin a way that you probably never saw\nyourself before and that is\nsuper humbling because i've done this\nthing you know the professional because\nit's sort of like a therapist\nbut it's mixed with\nwe're going to\ntherapy sometimes feels like it's an\nendless\nsort of winding road and this is like\ntherapy with a goal\ncoaching in the corporate world is\ndefinitely more forward-facing it's more\nbuilding it's more development and it's\ntaking you somewhere and\ni've\ni've always been grateful to surround\nmyself with coaches and experts and\nmentors in specific areas\nso that they can be honest with me with\nthe area that\nthey are\nknowledgeable in or have wisdom and\nexperience in have you found good\nmentors in your life how did you find\nthem or do you find that\nyou've had to kind of learn along the\nway what's been your journey with that\nwith coaching mentors and outside help\nand support\nit's weird like when i put the energy\nout there that i'm open to learn and i\nhave like an awareness of like something\nthat needs to be worked on\nit's like the universe brings them in\nthey bring in the people or the\ncircumstances\nor the\nrelationships or the conversations right\nand it's not just one thing it's sort of\nmultiple things right it could be like a\npattern that um\nmy daughter and i are having uh and then\nit's also like i have a conversation\nwith a friend who's you know\ngoing through an illness and it hits it\nthere again and then\num i\ngo to the doctor and my doctor brings up\nthe same thing you know and you're just\nlike okay the dots are connecting\nthe\nthe spirit guides are coming in and\nhelping me here\num you know whatever that is god a\nspirit um\nand so you i think you know if you're\nopen to being better and evolving\nthe universe will align to bring you\nuh all of those teachers right and i\nthink there's also like you you talk\nabout meditation but there's also\nwhatever that meditation is for someone\njust to like give yourself the space to\nsort of like sit\nand um and try to focus on that um\non sort of like the the stillness\nwhich is very hard for i think type a\npeople\nyeah yeah to like be still well you you\nsound like a i mean from what you're\nsharing you sound completely like a\nspiritual type a person uh in a good way\nin a good way and you know i can hear\nthat you know while you've been speaking\nthe language you use\njust so naturally flows between spirit\nand strategy and\neffort and energy like you know it's\nlike you're you're in between both of\nthose like you've used words and\nlanguage from both a spiritual and a\nstrategic sense and i wonder where that\nyou know being that little girl at 12\nyears old who was who was praying and\ndidn't know even what to and saying i\nhope i can do good in the world like now\nthat you've seen the universe god\nwhatever you want to call it reciprocate\nwith you\nand you felt that how much more\nstrength does that give you in that\nprocess i want to hear a bit about maybe\nthat spiritual side that you shared\nearlier on\nwhen you've seen that being returned in\nyou trying to do good how does that feel\nit sort of like reassures me\num that like\nthe journey\nis real in those\nsort of like trusting my gut\num and having um it's sort of like\nputting in the work\num then when the opportunities arise you\ncan then\nbe there and be ready for it but you\nhave to put in the work and prepare\num and so i think i was so focused on\nputting in the work and i never knew i\nwas like are the opportunities ever\ngonna arise you know who knows\num but it's true that when you put in\nthe work and you're trying\nyou will get\nthose those um\nopportunities um to progress\nand and um and doors will open\num if you're being honest with yourself\nright um and being authentic and so for\nme i think i before it was sort of like\ni think this is it i think this is how\nthis works where now i'm like i know\nthis is how this works so then if it it\ngives me sort of peace of mind that also\nit doesn't have to be such a grind and\nsuch a struggle\num\nand my world used to be very black and\nwhite and i live much more in the gray\narea now um\nand um and where i was like all or\nnothing\ni'm trying to be a bit more soft\nin my approach\nand more of a warm hug\nthan us a strong punch\nwhich is\nwhat i used to be\ndo you think that's natural in like the\njourney of like building something to\nthen having\nbuilt something successful of course do\nyou think that's natural do you think\nthat\nthat transition of that hard punch to\nthat warm hug as you said it\nfeels like a natural transition\nand it kind of has to go in that order\nor do you feel not everyone has to do it\nthat way is that i don't think people\nhave to do it that way that was just my\nway right it's your life circumstance\nright and and your fight-or-flight mode\nand your survival\nuh sort of instincts that is really sort\nof like how you cope or or deal with\nthings\ni appreciate what got me here but i know\nit's not going to take me to that next\nstage\nand i don't think everyone's journey is\nthe same but i do think that anyone who\nseeks to be successful in life has to\nhave\nrelentless\nperseverance\nas someone who's so energetically\nfocused as someone who's so\npresent with yourself in what you're\ncreating and the energy you want to put\nout what do you think are some of the\nthings that\nyou want the people around you to\ngain from you learn from you whether\nit's your children whether the people\nthat work with you on a day-to-day basis\nwhat are the some of the\nsome of the uh exchanges and values that\nyou're hoping that you can give out to\npeople\ni don't know\ni\ni feel like i've never\ni maybe i i'm not there yet it's i\nactually\nlistening\nto you and and you i mean\nlet's put it this way i feel\nuncomfortable even saying that i have\nfans\num and i'm in entertainment and that's\nlike a normal you know and i\ni don't know it just makes me feel like\nwait what being forward uh\nor progressive or\nthinking ahead of\nlike what is the impact that i want to\nhave on people\nthat are around me on on the daily\nuh\nis is maybe like my next\nmy next thing to think about\nyeah or process\nbecause i just i feel like i don't know\ni've been so focused on all of the other\nthings i i think the thing that i do\nintuitively\nis\ni see people's potential and i see who\nthey could be\num\nand not and and and i think i'm learning\nhow to\ndeliver\nthat\nwhen people are ready because people\naren't always ready for it right people\naren't always like\nready to\nto or or willing or wanting even\nto\nreach their full potential or to\nbe their their best self and and but i\nsee sort of like the\nthe shining\nbright light of of someone's potential\nand it's so clear to me when i see\npeople\nthat that's what i see in them i see\nthis\nother side of themselves and and i\ninterface with them in that way\num but that isn't always like\nwhat they're actually\nready for um so\nbut i um\ni think i need i'm learning how to be a\nlittle bit more self-aware\nto only talk to people about that\nwhen\num when they're when they want it\ninstead of just like here's what you\nshould do with you know um because it\ncan be a little bossy as well that's a\nwonderful and honest answer and i didn't\nwant anything else i honestly just\nwanted to know how you felt about that\nand so\nyou know hearing that\nthat's what you want to work on next and\nthat's what you're\ntrying to grow now and develop now i\nmean you know i think that's so\nwonderful for our audience to hear\nbecause\ni think\nwe're all going step by step we all have\nthings to work on and if that's the next\nthing that you're focusing on that's\nthat's brilliant and i don't think it's\ni don't think we're always fully\nconscious i think there is this\nexpectation and that's what i'm loving\nso much about this conversation is that\nthere's often an external expectation\nthat someone has everything figured out\nand everything's perfect and\neverything's going on and we obviously\nknow that's not true\nbut but often that's the perception and\nand to just hear that hey i'm trying to\nfigure this out and i'm learning about\nthis and and this is what i'm listening\nto i think that is just such a healthy\nthing\nfor people to hear does that make sense\nyeah yeah for sure i mean i think\npeople will see your life through their\nlens and through their experience\nwithout having the context of\nwhat you go through in your\nconsciousness right as you operate in\nthe world\num you know i look at like\njeff bezos and i'm like that guy's got\nit figured out you know like he seems\nreally happy\nhe's going to space or richard branson\nyou know and i'm like they're they're so\naccomplished they've like\nmultiple times have gotten hit after hit\nafter hit of like goodness and business\nand\nthey also are like you know\ndoing\ngood with their platform you know like\nit's like they\ni don't know i and so for me i guess\ni could see how through my experience i\ni project on to others and so i could\nsee how that could happen\nyeah i love hearing that you know at\nevery stage we're all projecting on to\nsomeone else\nand and i'm sure i don't know jeff bezos\nbut i'm guessing that\nyou can do in business and then now\nyou're looking at another industry and\nyou're looking at an athlete or you're\nlooking at an actor or a musician or but\nhe's also just like a very like he feels\nlike a very joyful person just like a\nhappy guy\nyou know\nand that's like to me i'm like i love\nseeing happy people i'm like yes i will\nlet you know once we have him on the\npodcast definitely i'll uh i'll uh i'll\nlet you know but uh tell me tell me\nabout have you ever struggled with or\nhave you ever worked through\nperfectionism i feel like being a\nperfectionist is something that happens\nin art it happens in business it happens\nas a ceo as an entrepreneur tell us a\nbit about that because i think my\naudience and community often ask me this\nand i'd love to hear your opinion on\nthis it's yeah like i'm struggling with\nyou know being a perfectionist and\ngetting things perfect and getting\nthings right tell us about your journey\nwith perfectionism\ni am 100 a detail-oriented perfectionist\num but i would say that\noftentimes that's used as an excuse to\nnot actually do anything because you're\nconstantly tweaking\nsomething before you\num\njust do it\num\nand commit and my uh\nmy partner at honest my ceo he\ndropped this really amazing nugget like\nearly on like a month into\nus working together when he came on to\nbe um the ceo of honest and he was like\num\nit's the 80 20 rule like it should be 80\nthere\nand you know\n20\nwhatever it's not right it's not totally\nbuttoned up but you're going to learn so\nmuch once you put it out there and\nyou're gonna have to sort of\nbe malleable enough to sort of like\ntweak and change as you go\num from there but you just have to like\nput it out there and and try it\num before you even really know because\nyou could be\nperfecting and and you know\nall these details matter so much but\nthen you put it out there and you were\nputting all of your energy into the\nwrong thing right no one cares\nat the end of the day about all those\nthings that you cared so much about um\nand so\num i think\ni think you should be\na detail-oriented person and you should\nhave a point of view and you should have\nlike conviction about your point of view\nbecause you know we're not robots right\nthat's what matters um but at the end of\nthe day it can't hinder you from\num\nputting yourself out there or trying\nsomething or innovating you know\nyeah yeah absolutely i think i think\nthat's a great piece of advice and\nhearing that early on i'm sure made a\nbig difference\nuh\nto your path and to your journey and you\nknow just a couple of seconds ago you\nsaid you love you love happy people\nand i was wondering what you think\nsome habits that you've seen in the\nhappy people that you've known the\npeople that you've met around you in\nyour own life what are some of the happy\nhabits that you think happy people have\nhabits that you have you seem happy uh\nfrom from my perspective and in this\nconversation you've laughed a ton and\nsmiled a ton and you know you're not\ntaking everything too seriously and\nallow yourself so tell me a bit about\nwhat are the\nuh happiness habits that you think that\nyou've practiced and ones that you've\nseen even in the people around you that\nyou you admire and aspire for\nyeah it's interesting like to me\nhappiness\nis more like and like it looks like a\nglow like an energy\nit's more of like an energy\nuh\nfor me association like\nchildren are very you know they're like\nthese bubbles of light you know they\njust sort of like\nyou can see these little like\nlight auras you know you could see their\naura\njust these like golden bright white\nlights of of\nyou can see that happiness right and you\ncan\nfeel when someone is just like\ncool with themselves and just happy and\nthey emit this\npositive energy we're all energy right\nthat's science right we're\nthere's we're all negative and\nand and uh positive energy but if you\nare putting more positive that's what's\ngoing to emit from you\nyour sort of energy field right um and\nuh\nyou know there's like it was interesting\nmy my niece um when she was 10 or 11 she\nwas did something for the science fair\nand she's like a\ndevastatingly beautiful girl and like\nwickedly talent talented but she's very\nshy um and she did the science\nexperiment that she got into like some\nscience fair and she basically took two\nplants and one plant she gave loving\nwords to and the other plant she\nsaid hateful words to and in like a few\ndays the same plant treated the same way\nwith the same water same light\neverything the one with the negative um\nenergy or you know the negative words it\nit died like it literally was like the\nsoil dried up it died it was done and\nthe other one was like growing like\nflourishing\nand um\nit's just so true that you emit\nthis uh\nsuch positivity and love\nright so happiness to me looks like\nlove and light\num and\ni i don't know\nsometimes people are just quiet and you\ncan see it yeah yeah i think you're\nright i think you're right and i i love\nthat i love that she chose to do that\nexperiment that that sounds that's\namazing what a wonderful experiment to\ndo and uh yeah for like a little girl\ntoo you know yeah it's such a special\nexperiment and to kind of get that proof\nso early on in life that energy's real\nand what we say to ourselves is real and\nwhat we say to others is real you you\nsaid earlier and and i love this answer\nthat you gave when i asked you about you\nknow what energy do you want to give out\nto people and\nyou you actually flipped it on its head\nand it was a great answer is that you're\nlike well actually i just noticed\npotential in people\nand and i was wondering when you see\nsomeone\nwho you see potential in but they don't\nsee potential in themselves\nhow do you respond to that i'm sure you\nmeet people like that all the time where\nyou see that i used to be relentless\nabout pushing people towards it and\nthey then built up a sort of defense\nwith me because it was like they weren't\nready for it and so i've learned over\nthe years to maybe keep it to just keep\nit to myself\nand kind of like nudge people and more\nlike ask questions\nand let them come to it themselves\nbecause like the more they feel like\nit was their idea and you just sort of\nlike serve up the prompts for them to\nsort of think about it and reflect on it\num and they're either gonna bite and be\ninto it or they're not\nand that's their journey and like even\nthough you know they're not happy even\nthough you know they're stuck even\nthough you know like it could be so much\nbetter but if that's their life choice\nyou kind of have to also respect the\njourney you know\nyeah definitely you you've said a few\ntimes another another pattern that i'm\nhearing is\nyou know and and i really appreciate it\nis your approach to like just not\nforcing people to change or not\njudging someone or not making someone\nfeel like you're preaching to them or\nteaching them or\ncoaching them like i can see that from\nyour approach\nthat's not how you think about it and\nyou really want people to come to things\nat their own time and in their own pace\nand even even in their own way that it's\ntheir idea as you just said\nis that something you think you've\nexperienced as well and that's why you\nbelieve in it so much or is it something\nthat\nor is that something that you saw\nbecause\nmaybe you were quite preached to and\ntaught and judged and coached and you\nrealized that that people didn't respond\nto that so much i think it was more of\nlike\nme learning\nhow people like i was like who are the\npeople who i've seen potential in and\nthey've like sort of they break through\nand they actually like move in that\ndirection and then i see potential in\nothers and they're like\nno\num and and so\ni guess it's just being mindful of\nmaybe my kids maybe it's my kids\ni think my kids have taught me a lot\nabout that the more i tell them\nsomething\nthe more they resist and they look at it\nas parenting and i'm just bossing them\naround and\nmy honor\neven told me last night it was so so\nannoying and over like something so\nstupid anyway um\nyou know she's\nshe wants to redo her room\nand i'm like\ncool so i'm like pinterest board like\nshow me your inspo\nand\nshe was like and my friend she just\nredid her room and she has like all\nthese plants it's very bohemian and i\nlove it so\nmuch it\nand i was like did her mom help her with\nit and she was like yeah and i'm like\ncool\nhow does that make you feel and she was\nlike it doesn't make me feel like\nanything i think it's great her mom's\nreally nice and i was like cool and she\nwas like mom i just want this to be my\nproject and i don't want you to you know\ntell me what to do or i don't want your\nadvice on you know what you like she's\nlike i want to come to these thoughts on\nmy own you know and she's like so um\nshe's so sweet her little soul but you\nknow she's\nthe way she puts it to me it just makes\nit so clear how people process right\nyeah um\nand so\nthat's that's how i get a lot of my\nlessons is just the way that my oldest\nespecially reacts\num off of\nme on simple things and then you can\nkind of apply it to more complex things\nyeah yeah definitely i i love that\nexample i think\nit's amazing i i think that's partly why\nwhen whenever i talk about children i'm\nlike yeah you've got to be ready to you\nknow when whenever i think about having\nkids i'm always saying to myself i've\ngot to be ready to be humbled and taught\nand coached by them and and have to\nlearn by them yeah if i'm not ready for\nthat then it's not the right time yet\ni just don't know if you're ever ready\nor not ready i don't know i just kind of\nfeel like\nyour kids\nchoose you because they're they're\nthey're going through their journey\nright um and your souls sort of like\nchoose each other in a way at the right\ntime\num\ni spoke to a\nuh this\nthis woman she's a\nseer\nand and i see her once a year as sort of\nlike a gift to myself and she talked\nabout my son for\ngosh\nseven years before he came like she saw\nhim and there was another one in france\nwho also saw him and\num\nand\nthey described him perfectly and they're\nlike it's not the right time like he's\ngonna come at this time and this is\nthe dynamic of your relationship with\nyour husband and then your other two and\nthat's when he's gonna come in\nand\nthey were right\nyou know spiritually we were all in such\na different place\nand our family dynamic was in such a\ndifferent place when he came through um\nbut they saw him\nlike waiting and i was like you know\nmeanwhile i you know i was like i am not\nhaving two more kids you know and then i\nwas like i'm not having one more kid\num\nand so it's interesting how they sort of\nchoose you\nand they're waiting for the right time\nabsolutely thank you so much for
