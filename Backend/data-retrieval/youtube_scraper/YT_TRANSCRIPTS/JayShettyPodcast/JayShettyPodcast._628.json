those people\nyou've attracted\nmy heart's like\nthank you that is so sweet honestly\nbecause when i found out that you you\nwere going to come on the podcast and\nthat we connected and i wanted you to\ncome on the fact that you wanted to come\non to me it was amazing\nhonestly because\nwe we used to live in the same building\nyes and we bump into each other in the\ngym all the time and you used to bump\ninto my wife and i'd just be like\nhi\ni love you\nand you just remembered my wife in the\nelevator all the time like nice sweater\nyeah and you just you know i've also\nbeen following your journey and you\nprobably didn't even know that no i had\nno idea and i've been following you\njenny and i've been so\nhonestly and i mean this from the bottom\nof my heart been so blown away by your\nactivism and advocacy for mental health\nawareness thank you your work for\nwomen's empowerment uh the beautiful\ncommunity that you just launched last\nyear called we are warriors which we're\ngoing to talk about today\nthat your work is so beyond what many\nknow\nand i'm so glad that i get to sit down\nto help you share that story because i\nreally think that and and i felt it only\ntoday\nyou just have this amazing energy that\nsurrounds you wherever you go and so i\nwant you to know that thank you so much\ni feel like i um one of the things i do\nis i like spread myself like very thin\nbecause i feel like\ni'm sure a lot of people can relate to\nthis there's like so many different\nlives i want to live that i\njust dabble and then i don't give\nlike\nthis year i've been like let's just\nfocus on one thing at a time like that's\nkind of like what my team is saying and\nso i'm like i'm i'm focusing on one\nthing at a time but it's there's a like\nas you know as if you've been following\nmy journey i've have just so many\ndifferent passions and loves and i also\nlike\nlike there's just so much to fix here\nlike to i'm just i'm like oh my god like\nthe second i was like looked around\nbecause you know how like you're kind of\nin your head and then at one point\nyou're just like oh like you're like\nearly 20s like whoa\ni was like\nif you don't\nif you don't feel you have a purpose i\ncan point out five like right like there\nis so much that like just needs service\nand help and\num i when i first\ni almost felt paralyzed when i like\nfirst saw how many well one like\non the mental health aspect just like\nour relationship with our parents and\nlike how that stems and how we just\ncontinue this weird cycle and how can i\nhelp break these cycles so we can create\nlike new beliefs new patterns and help\nheal especially for females\nin general because we've been suppressed\nbut just in all aspects of\nwhat are healthy relationships what is\nnormal because the normal we've been\nliving is not healthy so what is the new\nnormal right so it's just like going\ninto those subjects and then of course\nlike i'm like earth\noh no\ni didn't even know i'm so sorry and like\ngoing into like plastic the past plastic\npandemic and like\nand then learning the like how the thing\nthat has blessed me so much social media\nhas actually\nbeen hurting so many people and that\nof the girls that have been following me\nand it like broke my heart just like\nthere's just so many things that broke\nmy heart and those it almost like when\nmy heart broke and i was like there's a\npath and then i just would keep like put\ngoing through those things and\nthen i you know i grew up as a model and\nthat was like all i knew and so my\nself-worth was very much on like well\ni'm pretty and that's that's my offering\nlike i'm pretty\nand so i felt very um\nscared because i was like i want to\njust like reach my hand out out of this\nbox that i've been in\num and there's a lot of back you know\npeople being like why does she have\nanything to say about any of these\ntopics but i was like can we all just\ntalk about them then so like it's okay\nbecause there's just a lot\num\nand then that's i i would just it was\nalmost like i would just like step kind\nof like a mermaid coming out to like you\nknow just like stepping like i can turn\ninto i can speak on different things and\nso just finding my way through\nthe puzzle my god sister always says\nthis and i believe it she says there's\nno problem only puzzle pieces and like\njust trying to figure out what goes\nwhere\nthat's been like a series of last couple\nof years been very interesting i love\nthat we're going to talk about each and\nevery one of those because you've just\nshared so much with us and and i want to\nthank you for just your vulnerability\nacross the whole time like you've always\nnever been scared\nof\njust diving into what your heart cares\nabout\nand i think that's beautiful to see but\nlet's start with\nwhat was\nalexis's first passion ever when was the\nfirst time you felt that passion that\ninterest that curiosity about something\nback to when you were tiny like whatever\nyou want to go to yeah i mean\nso i was homeschooled my entire life\ni've never set foot in a classroom and\nso that really gave me the opportunity\nto just like go deep into like my own\ncreativity\num and you know it was the three three\ngirls all being homeschooled there's a\nlot to handle my mom are you the eldest\nof the youngest i'm the middle child and\nyour parents decided to do this with\nthree my mom my dad was like okay\nmy mom was like i'm doing this um she\nwas very\num i feel like the term woke is very\nmuch overused but she back then like i\nmean she homeschooled herself through\ncollege it was very very\ndifferent back and then it was just not\num accepted\ni\nspent so much time\nbeing in front of the camera like\ncreating music videos like it was all i\nwanted to do and because i didn't i\nwasn't around the only people i was\naround were the people that accepted me\ni just went full force into whatever\ncreative thing i was doing and it was\nreally interesting because my mom\nshe was obsessed with\nbeing like what are you interested and\nthen we'll learn subjects based off of\nthat subject so for instance i fell in\nlove with ballet that was my first i\nwould say that was my first passion and\nshe was like hey we're gonna learn\nhistory through ballet and so there's\njust this like um desire to learn that i\nwas just super accustomed to and so when\ni would talk to my friends being like oh\nyou're going to school what are you\nlearning and they just like roll their\neyes and like hate it and i didn't\nunderstand that because i was like\nthat's what we're here to do is learn\nlike and it's fun it's like so exciting\nso i was very blessed to have that kind\nof an upbringing um your mom's genius my\nmom that's amazing the longer the more\nin my adult life i i'm getting i'm just\nlike my mom was so aware like it's cr\nand\ni i'm like living we'll get to that part\nbut like i'm i'm living for her now as\nwell because\neverything that all of her beliefs i'm\nfulfilling and like hopefully just like\ncarrying it on carrying her legacy but\nwith ballet it was\nit was a love at first you know because\nyou're a little girl you're like i'm\ngonna dance on the cardboard box and\nlike i would like perform little things\nfor my mom is that the ballerina voice\nyeah i don't know what voice that is\nyou're gonna hear that voice brilliant\nyeah i've been hearing it\ni love it i don't know where it comes\nfrom but\num and so my mom was like okay you want\nto do this you want to do ballet so i\nstudied for\n15 years i'm still studying now so i\nwould say now\n24 years now i've been studying but like\nit was i stopped around 16 because\num\ni mean first of all just shout out to\nballet because that where if anyone is\nwho is a dancer is watching this like\nyou you guys know the type of work ethic\nthat you're taught we also know the\ntrauma\nyou're given so um it's a it's almost\nlike a wand and then a sword at the same\nlike edges because my work ethic is out\nof this world all i know is how to put\n100 of myself in and that's what ballet\ntaught me had this really strict russian\nteacher yuri shawn yuri\nit was just i was constantly\nlike please i just wanted to please like\nplease please please and so i got into\nthis deep people-pleasing habit um and\nthat stem from my first passion which\nwas very interesting because it bled\ninto everything else that i fell in love\nwith um and then it almost like\nand this is so interesting and i was\njust reflecting on this with a friend\nlast week\nit reversed\nall of the work that i'd done in my\nhomeschooling years to create my own\nidentity and almost because it's like if\nyou're constantly like\ndo you like what i did i can do it\ndifferent let me know\nlike i can be better for you um you\nstart to lose your identity and\nso\nthat happened so deeply to the point in\nballet\num that i i still remember the first\nmoment where i was in ballet class and\nit was just i was at a breaking point um\nbecause one i think around the age of 16\n15 you can kind of tell whether or not\nyou'll be accepted into like a company\nor something by just the way your body\nis made and my hips were never that\nflexible and i would always like just\nhurt myself to try and get myself there\nand it just never worked\nso one time in class my teacher was just\nlike just grabbed my leg and threw it to\nthe back and was like no and like yelled\nat me so hard in my like something\nhe like she like threw i i was on the\nbar and he just took my leg and threw it\nto the back and he was like no like no\nalexi no\nand it just broke my heart because i was\njust like i can't do this anymore i love\nballet so much but i can't i can't\nthis is like ruining me\nand so it was very interesting because\nright at that moment where i was like i\ndon't think that ballet is for me on the\nlevel that i wanted\nmodeling i was scouted like literally\nlike within a year and a half before i\nquit\nballet and then that was\na new path that i was like\ni can do this like i can smile and like\nyou know like i can this is really fun\nand i remember\num i got signed first time\nfirst paycheck i was i for 14\n14. and it was like 15\nwas around the time i quit ballet yeah i\nwas like 15. and then\nmy agency was like so do you want to go\nlive in tokyo for six months to a year\nby yourself i was like sure like my mom\nwas like well i raised you so\nsure you know like if i can't trust you\nthen i don't trust myself and just like\ngives you an idea how amazing of a\nmother who she was so it was like it\nalmost went i just\nto to bring this all back around\nmy passions i grew up so\nquickly from all of my it was just like\nyou're an adult world you're an adult\nworld you're living on your own you're\nan adult so by the time i was 16 i was\ni already felt like i was\nan adult yeah an adult and it felt\namazing i was like\nmom\neverything's amazing like i'm doing i'm\ndoing all the things that you want like\nhere's a new dishwasher like i got you\nlike whatever and so it i felt on top of\nthe world around 16 i was like finally\ngot my like it just was working out so\nbeautifully i was working every day\nand i was like and not to go through my\nwhole life story but this is kind of an\nimportant place um story moment um we're\nhere for it\nwhen\ni think it was mother's day\n2014\nmy mom\nclaps on the floor\nand\ni was like\nbarry can i didn't we didn't know what\nwas wrong with her i mean my sister was\nlike i don't know what's wrong with her\nwe got my mom to the hospital and the\nnext day they were like she's terminal\ncancer she's gonna die in like a couple\ndays\nand we were like\nwhat\nand like i think anyone knows like\nespecially females with their mothers\nlike she was my first reflection so like\ni\ni didn't understand i mean you you don't\nunderstand death at the that age you're\njust like i'm too close to beginning of\nlife to understand death and that was\ncrazy so i think that almost because she\nshe ended up passing away\nwell she refused all cancer treatment\nshe's holistic she was a holistic health\nnutritionist so she like refused\neverything everyone was like you're not\ngoing through chemo and she was like\nthat's gonna kill everything in me like\nno\nwhich i i love her for that she was just\nso powerful and she was so\nstuck on her beliefs and i mean they\nsaid she was only gonna live two weeks\nshe ended up living another like six to\neight months wow so that's like i i was\nlike i gotta give it to you mom like\nthat that's amazing\num and so i kind of i got to learn how\nto live life\nwithout her while she was still there\nalmost because she was like in bed\num but i didn't i didn't quite\nunderstand\nhow much i would lose myself from losing\nher and that was like i think\nit was like on top of\nthe\nthe people-pleasing aspect in each of my\neach steps in my career and then losing\nthat reflection of just\neverything i wanted to be\ni almost had to like start again it was\nweird i i still remember like being\nin my\num car parking lot just like\nhaving this whole breakdown being like i\nhave no idea who i am anymore like this\nis\ncrazy\num\nand so yeah\ni just like went on a rant tangent but\nthat was like i think a defining moment\nin like one who i wanted to be\nto uh how i wanted to serve\nand then three\num\nhow like how could i how do i break the\nboxes that people put me in because my\nmom was so good at breaking boxes she\nwas like oh you think college is the\nonly way nope like oh you think like\nwestern medicine's the only way nope\nlike and so it was just\nthat inspired me to like go down all of\nthe paths that i'm currently now\ncreating so it was like crazy sorry that\nwas a really long tangent no it wasn't a\ntool thank you so much for sharing that\nlike thank you for thank you for sharing\nthat honestly what's coming out of my\nmouth i don't know\nbecause at 14 you know you're obviously\nnot making sense of it in that way at 14\nit's\nit is the most heartbreaking thing that\ncan happen to anyone at any age\nbut to have it at such a young age and\ndefining age\nand then losing yourself where do you\nthink\nthat took you at that time today it's\nobviously taking you to some beautiful\nwonderful things which we'll get on to\nbut at that time you've mentioned the\npeople-pleasing mentality a few times it\ncomes from trying to impress your ballet\nteacher\nwhere does that then take you\nand how does that affect your modeling\nbecause that's the next stage yeah i\nthink with the people-pleasing thing\nit's almost like turning it around and\nbeing like now how can i harness this\nfor myself right because i know how hard\ni work now can i not work for that can i\nwork for me so like that was like the\nswitch um and i've always found i was\nliterally talking about this last night\nbut i i kind of i believe and i hope i\ncan state this correctly but\nhow low you go is how high you'll go\nand i keep seeing that in life like if\ni'm whenever like i hit like a low like\njust patch i'm just like oh do you own\nme\nlike what are you gonna do to like make\nthis up like let's go and then of course\nit like it'll launch me into a next pad\nso at the time i didn't realize that but\ni do think like the reas like going\nthrough the passing of my mom and\neverything was i literally just look\nit's her wedding ring but um\nthe it was the reason i got launched\ninto such like a fast like\nblas like completely blessed life was\nbecause he was like okay\njust wait i got i got you like i got you\nand now i can almost like with\neverything with everything i've done and\nlike especially with weird warriors like\nthat community was the manifestation\nlike that's something my mom would have\ncreated right because\nwhen i went on because it was modeling\nand then social media started coming up\nand i just remember\nphotos of me when i was very very young\n15 going viral on the internet i didn't\nunderstand it and i was working full\nfull-time as a model i didn't really\nunderstand what was going on tell us\nabout that experience yeah that was that\nwas great i mean i was i was just so\nhappy i was just so i was like i'm\nworking e-com nine hours a day\nback like i was just like i was living\nunder like my dream because i was\nfinancially independent i could help my\nmom out like everything was going\namazing and then on top of it i was\ngetting this like\nthis this attention that i never thought\ni would get and so there was it was i\nthink 2013 or 14 and then 2015 hit\nand and that was interesting because i\nhad to i went through my mom passing\nlike publicly so that was like i think\nthe first\nunderstanding that the second you share\nyour vulnerabilities it's almost like\nit's setting you free that's why i'm so\ni always whenever i go on interviews i'm\njust like can i think new thoughts here\nbecause i would like that i love\nthinking new thoughts yeah i don't i\ndon't like repeating you know\ni hate preparation it like scares me i'm\njust like no it's gonna ruin whatever's\nmeant to happen i so agree i i say that\nall the time and i hope i hope i help\nyou do that today but that's the same\nfor me if i'm ever being interviewed i'm\nlike i want to say stuff that i've never\nsaid before exactly like that's what\nexcites me it's like can this be so\nyou're in a room with a friend and\nyou're just like i just thought of\nsomething yeah what if like that's i\nlove that yeah well please go there yeah\ngo on any tangent you want to go let's\nsee what will come out um\nbut yeah so it was the modeling and then\nsocial media came along um instagram\nstarted blowing up i started traveling\nwith an ex-boyfriend of mine we were\nsuper super young the reason we\nconnected actually was his mom passed\naway from cancer as well so we had this\nreally deep connection i would call it a\ntrauma bond now but yeah it was um very\ndeep and so we started traveling and and\npicking up this attention and so\none of the things i can now look back at\nit as an adult and be like well i was\ntrying to like put him in the place of\nmy mom and he i was trying to make him\ntake care of me the way my mom did and\nso it was just like it was going it was\nnot go it was not going to be a stable\nrelationship right and so and then he we\njust we didn't know what love is right i\nthink around those times until right now\ni'm still un learning what love is to me\npersonally and so finding who matches\nthat same understanding of connection\nso that was crazy because\ni was\ntrying to replace my my mom with a guy\nand then it blowing up in the public eye\nand so i just i remember like we like\nposted this video and then the next day\nit was like all over the news and i was\njust like what is happening like i don't\nunderstand and then people are like\nwe're calling them influencers and i was\nlike what what does that even mean i\ndidn't i didn't understand because i was\nlike i'm a mo like i've been a model my\nwhole life\nand so it just it blew and i honestly\nlike i can't i wish i could tell you\nmore about what happened during those\nyears but i think\ni i've fully like disassociated like you\nknow how like with trump you just like\ni've disassociated like between like\n2015 to 2017 i was\ni don't really remember much but it was\nins i just remember how quick everything\nhappened and it was just like\nplaying this it was my first time uh i\ndon't want to say it was my first time\nacting but it was my first time playing\na role and i was like this is\ninteresting because i feel a lot of\npressure to be this\nperfect thing all the time\nwhen in fact i was actually the complete\nopposite and that's why i i manifested\nthis this character i was playing online\nbecause i wanted to be here so bad\nbecause i was a wreck and and i i came\nto a moment\nwhere like the relationship wasn't going\nwell um the traveling was too much on my\nbody because we were going we would just\nspend like three days in one place and\nhop around it was just like the most\ninsane filled up a passport in like two\nyears so it was a lot on my body as well\nand i just remember\nit was my body that gave out first and\ni've always my mom always told me to\nlisten to my body test myself always say\nmy name over again until i can hear\nmyself again like all of those things\nshe's taught me but i forgot all of it i\nthrew ev all of her knowledge all over\nwisdom tell us some of those things walk\nus through some of those that you let go\nof because i think they'd be really\npowerful yeah okay so one of the things\nthat she always whenever i would hang\nout with a friend um i would come home\nand she'd be like\nare you there i was like what do you\nmean and she was like you sound like\nsophia are you on sofia's identity right\nnow say your name\nand so i would say alexis and she's like\nsay your full name so i'd say my full\nname and i'd keep saying it until i'd i\nhear my\nvoice drop like back into my identity\nand then she'd body test me and she'd be\nlike she'd say i am alexis and she\npushed me down and my um it just kept\ngetting stronger i do this with\nsupplements as well when i'm holding a\nsupplement i'll hold it down and press\nit down to see if my body recip like\nlikes it or whatever it is\num\nshe would\nshe was a firm i\nshe would um play the secret in the\nminivan whenever we like\ngo on our errands and i'm just like\nwhat is this\ni don't understand and she'd be like we\nhave magic honey and i was like what\nyeah so i was like i want to manifest\nsomething and you know at the time you\nknow i'm like 12 being like i want to\nmanifest a red ball and so i like spent\nthree weeks trying to manifest this red\nball this is still like my favorite\nmanifestation story ever but like i\nstill think it's like my best\naccomplishment in my conversation\nbecause it was so like specific i knew\nexactly what it felt i knew what it\nlooked like i didn't know where it was\ngoing to be but i just knew i was going\nto find it and\nthree four weeks later i found it at the\npark and i was just like\ni like freaked out i was like mom this\nspoke she was like football i was like\nthe ball i thought in my head when you\nsaid that we have magic powers\num so that was like that was weird i\nlove that so yeah it was like\nshe was always just planting these like\nseeds of she would never tell me\nwhat it was she would just have me\nquestion whether or not that felt good\nto me like that the truth itself she was\nlike\nhow do you feel about us having you know\npowers beyond just our hands and i was\nlike that sounds amazing and she was\nlike all right well then\nthat could be a possibility like why\ndon't you try like why don't we we\npracticed this together so it was almost\nlike i was like um\nyou were like partners she was like my\nfriend i would say more so than a mother\nwhich i wanted to\nreplicate within all of my relationships\nall of my friendships like that was like\nshe was\nso just so powerful in that way\num\nbut yeah amazing yeah sorry you you were\ntelling me i don't know what i was\nsaying i said you said that at that time\nyou let go of all of these things that\nyour mum had taught you\nthat's that's why i want to decide so\nyeah so just like let it go i didn't\ndidn't believe in magic anymore i didn't\nlike it was um\ni like saying magic better than law of\nattraction because i feel like that's\nbeen like overused but i'm\ni like magic yeah magic it's way more\nfun um\nso i got to the point where\nmy body\nfailed on me and so i got super sick i\nremember i was bedridden for like\nthree weeks\nand i had an amazing support system and\nobviously we all know how special like\nour support system is and i kind of was\ni didn't see them at the time because i\nwas just in this relationship i was\ntraveling at but they were always on the\nsidelines like my god sister and my\nsisters and like my godmothers i have so\nmany grandmothers it's like actually\ncrazy and i'm so blessed it's just like\noh are you my mommy like literally like\ni'm just like i love shout out guys you\nknow who you are um\nbut\nthey slowly the second they saw that my\nears because my mom would always say she\nwas like um if someone's not ready to\nhear you don't bother trying to speak to\nthem and so\nthey finally kind of came around and\nwere like are you ready to listen i was\nlike i'm ready because i was like in bed\nand\nthat's when i started to really like i\nwent through\nlike deep we ended the relationship and\nthen i went through this crazy\ni was a healing journey it was almost\nlike um\nhow would i explain it like i took\nmyself through my own\nlike\nretreat i would say like i did like i\nhad things i would do every morning like\ni journal like take out the trash\njournal every morning like get out all\nof my thoughts see what my patterns were\nthat created my identity and see then\nwhat patterns i wanted to hold on to or\nlet go of and so that was a lot um and\nthen at the same time\ni was like i want to go deep into this\nmodeling thing like i want to do i want\nto do this i want to finally do what\ni've always wanted to do i felt like i\ngot sidetracked with so much traveling\nand it was exhausting me and i felt like\ni was living in someone else's dream\nlike i wanted to do this and so\ni went deep into modeling and i was like\nsuper excited i did sports illustrated\nand like all these amazing things um but\nthere was\nbut my mental health was getting worse\nand i was like what is it happening i\ndon't unders like alexis i almost felt\nlike embarrassed i was like wow alexis\neverything is happening why are you a\nwreck like i was trying to hide it\nconstantly with even my closest friends\nbecause i was like this doesn't make\nsense and this is like actually\nridiculous and i'm being dramatic so i\nneed to stop um to the point where\nmy god sister ally\num\nally\nuh ally um she was like i think you uh\nshe was like you need to come to hawaii\nyou need to come to hawaii and you need\nto get out of\nhollywood you just need to like\nget out of this\nthing that's so attracted to\nthe essence of you that is not\nall of you like i want you to fall in\nlove with all of you and so i went to\nhawaii and actually lived there for nine\nmonths and that was when i really went\nlike\nit was so hard like self-healing is not\nfun no it is not no everyone everyone's\nlike the five minute journal like how do\nyou feel today great like no like i'm\njust like\nwow i ended up\nfalling in love with poetry because i\nwould just like get so deep into one the\npain\nthat i would almost find i would get a\nhigh this is weird i'm sure artists and\npoets know this but like you get like a\nhigh off of like\nseeing some a pain in you that can be\ntold in a way that everyone can and\nyou're just like what what like and so i\ni just like wrote and i was like in the\njungle i would just spend all day\nmeditating like we my sister would make\nme\nlike go to a tree and scream at a tree\nand like just we like just going through\nthe whole thing to almost like\nshe she would she used the\num\nshe said she said to me one time she was\nlike it's like an onion she was like we\njust have to take off all the layers\nthat were put onto you like from\nliterally the moment you got here she's\nlike i'm not just talking about like\nwhat you think is your trauma she's like\ni'm talking about everything because no\nmatter what it's like we get here in\nlife and we're just like perfect we're\npure\njust experience we're just here for the\nmoment everything and then slowly but\nsurely we start getting like well this\nis how we should feel about this this is\nhow we should feel about this this is\nwhat happens when we do this this is our\nidea of love and like it just goes goes\ngoes so we went so deep into the healing\nto where i almost felt like a clean\nslate again\nand the second that i felt that\ndancing with the stars called me and\nthey were like you should you should\ncome back telling me and i was like\nit always happens like no i'm like as\nsoon as you're doing your deepest\nhealing you get this like huge\nopportunity\nexactly\nand i was like\nah\ni don't know if i want to do that and i\nwas very uncertain because\ni'm i'm always very wary when it comes\nto reality tv um because you know they\nthey can just like change things you can\nchange things differently like so so\nintensely to the point where i'm just\nlike that wasn't even me\num\nbut i remember i remember one of the\nbooks i read simon sinek he was talking\nabout the why and i was like well if i\ncan just have a why with everything i do\nthen i don't have to be worried about\nthe outcome because i had my intention\num\nand i remembered it being one of my my\nmom's favorite show on the planet and i\nwas like\nand so i went back to la and did the\nshow and that was like crazy i got to\ndedicate a dance to her which was insane\nand like i was just there for the\nexperience i honestly to be honest i i\nactually didn't\nwant to win i mean you get wrapped up in\nthe competition but i was like i don't\nwant to win i just like but i love that\nyou did it because it was\nfor you your mom loved the yeah it\nwas so fun got to dance for her and it\nwas just like that was a crazy\nexperience so it's almost like\nand this is what i kept seeing and\naround this time\ni was questioning what do i want to be\nfor the world this was around the time\nwhere i was like speaking my head out\nbeing like i don't have to\ni\ncan i offer more\nto this world than just the way i look\nbecause they keep telling me that's all\ni have but like maybe i have more and\ndid you really feel that that people\nwould just you felt that people's\nresponse was that that's all you have\nwas that very like yeah is that like a\nvisceral feeling cyber bullying is like\na real thing it's\ntell us about that because i think that\nyou're someone obviously who's stood up\nfor so many important causes like you're\nsaying now you've had\ncyberbullying trolling\ncomment sections whatever it may be tell\nus a bit about\nwhat you experienced and then how you\nfound your way through it and i get that\nit's an ongoing thing yeah no for sure i\nmean\nit was it was really helpful when i\nstarted to self-reflect because then i\ncould just see the pain that people were\ninflicting on to me and i was like it's\nalmost like if you're pretty you can't\nbe smart you can't have because it's\nit's too much and then you're too much\nof a threat and then it's like that\nscares and i was just like it made me\nsad so at first it\nhurt me because i was like they're right\nlike i would believe them i'd be like\nthey're right like i should just you\nknow stay in my lane\nand then after a while i was just like\nno the only way and this is what i've\nbeen coming to learn with the community\nis like the only way i can authentically\nhelp you is to be that is that is i\ncan't preach to you i can't teach you i\nhave to be it and if i want everyone\nliving and knowing that they're\nmulti-dimensional beings and knowing\nthat they can do so much at the same\ntime then i have to honor and\nsee that in me and that's terrifying\nbecause then that means i actually have\nto like stop leaning because they were\nright i was leaning on this thing\nof like what society was telling me that\ni was and so i almost had to like take\noff my like training wheels and just be\nlike you're on a bike now\nyou're going downhill\nwe have breaks you've never used them\nyet but like this is what we're doing\nand that's when i started to\nfigure out like no i don't want to\nconquer the world i want to like help it\nand then how can i serve because i've\nwhenever i think of\nmy idols and just people who i look up\nto\nyou know when i was younger it was like\nthe victoria's secret angels and now for\nme it's like my godmothers like oh my\ngod you guys are in like actual warriors\nlike true warriors and so\nwhy do you think that changes and and\nobviously victoria secrets themselves\nhave gone through a massive evolution\nrecently like but why do you think that\nchanges as you grow older because i\nthink that's\nsomething that a lot of\nyeah\nyoung adults teenagers and then when you\nbecome an adult you you start looking at\nyour family differently your parents\ndifferently their sacrifice\nwell yeah because you start to i feel\nlike you start to just like actually see\nthem like you almost come up to like the\noh like you're not just like looking up\nmy mom one of my things my mom\nimplemented in me was\nlike you're not\num she was like i would prefer it if you\ncall your friend's parents names by\ntheir first names just like do it and\nsee how they feel i was like what so i\ncan call him mark\ni don't have to call him mr you know\nwhatever and she's like he's like no\nlike we're human like let's let's i want\nyou to be on everyone's terms and i want\nyou to see how that feels\num\nwell i mean for looking up to victoria's\nsecret models i still think like what\nthey created back in the day was\nbeautiful and it was it was art you know\nit's just like something to celebrate\nand it was a type of woman that we could\ncelebrate we can celebrate all types of\nwomen's but\num\ni think it was more so their energy of\nlike i own this space that i'm living in\nand\nit was it was new to me because i was\ngrowing up in a living situation where\nmy mother was very much so like\nlet me just\nshe's like it's like we're the water and\nshe's the tub and she's like let me just\nlike form to however you guys need um\nand so it's very much a people-pleasing\ncomplex of just like i'm going to be\neveryone's everything and the perfect\neverything for them\nwhich ultimately is the reason why like\ni think her health declined because you\ncan't sustain that it's unsustainable\num\nand then there was a lot of things that\ni didn't see within her so i think\nfor me heroes are the people that\nhave\nare continually admitting why they're\nnot almost if that makes sense like it's\njust like\noh no i but not\num like still being like humble and\nstuff but just\ncontinuously\nknowing that there's always something to\nlearn\nthere's always something you don't know\nlike my mom always said stay teachable\nstay teach always stay you were you\nnever know like the person who is like\nahead of everyone else is the one that\nknows that he knows nothing like is that\nkind of the vibe and so that's what i\ngrew up in and so that kind of energy i\nstarted to be attracted to more than\njust like i own this space yes it was\nmore so like these these these people\nwho would\nsit in silence and like that's when i\nreally started getting into like\npodcasts and and reading and i just went\ndeep into that space\num\nbecause the stories i mean\ni think at heart i've always been a\nstoryteller like my whole life has just\nbeen a series of stories that i can your\nmother sounds like an amazing\nstoryteller\nyeah absolutely and so\nlistening to people's experiences was\nthe best way that i learned um and then\ni started to look up to those people so\nit just it changed from like this is the\nthe image that i want to perceive to\nlike these stories inspire me and like\nthat's why this person inspires me so it\nchanges over time it evolves and like\nthank god it does cause like to be\nhonest it's exhausting\nonly only thinking you're known as your\nlooks like that is like actually the\nmost soul exhausting thing because you\nconstantly are in this state of fight or\nflight and it is like i've been starting\nto say this affirmation i think i\nstarted about a month ago but i always\nsay like my looks are the least\ninteresting thing about me like i always\ni can't say that all the time i'm just\nlike i don't this is like not what i'm\nfocusing on right now it's not what i\ndon't care\num\nlike it's a tool but i don't that's not\nwhat i will rely on um that's not what i\nwant females to rely on that's something\ni want them to celebrate and all image\nall um\nanything celebrate it um but it\nshouldn't be like a something to lean on\nlike that's the unhealthiness and so\nwhen i created wear worries i can just\nlike briefly touch upon this when i\ncreated yeah i was i think around 2018 i\nstill have it in my notes it was really\nweird i was like scrolling through my\nnotes one day and i went all the way to\nlike 2017\nand it literally said in a sentence i\nwant to create a community that i can\ntalk to and help evolve like once a week\nor and then also like in all of my like\nlike intentions of my notes it was like\ni want to help evolve human\nconsciousness that was like one of them\nand it was just like\nwhoa like i had no idea what i was\nsaying like notes are powerful you guys\nlike\nhas all the best ideas in the world of\nanyone in there i know you never look\nback you're just like this is gold and\nyou never look back but like when you do\nlike you guys after this go through your\nnotes like like go through your notes\nlike go through your notes i agree\nthey're crazy you'll see one like things\nthat you manifest that you didn't even\nrealize and then two just parts of\nyourself that you're like i'm pretty\ncool like like i don't know i said that\nyou know\num\nso that was like the first i think\nmanifestation of the company and growing\nup like in the fashion industry i felt\nvery um\nlike everyone was like you could create\nthis brand or you could create this\nclothing and then but like my my love\nfor the environment i was like we don't\nneed another bikini i just\nthis does not feel in alignment like\nthis is not so how can i\ncreate something that is meaningful that\ndoes have a promise but but the company\nitself is the promise like it's not like\na brand having a promise and so\ni knew from being homeschooled that the\neducation system is\n[Music]\nyou know i would love to help\nreconstruct that or take that down\ncompletely but um\njust saying just say yes we will work on\nit\nwe need to work on it because um it's\nit's so it's so outdated and not the\ntools that you will need and it breaks\nmy heart seeing i think i was yeah in\n1920 i was seeing all my friends come\ncome out of college or drop out of\ncollege being like well that was a waste\nof time and i'm like that's\nheartbreaking to me that is absolutely\nheartbreaking to me and like how can we\nfix this yeah it's like 18 years of your\nlife\nand your prime life i was like you can\nlearn at any point in your life but\nyou're only going to be 18 once and so\nit's like it's like experience i would\nsay experience more than be in a\nclassroom but and it breaks my heart and\nso i knew\nthat i wanted to help on that level i\njust\ndidn't know what i didn't know how after\nlike telling my story on dancing with\nthe stars i was like storytelling this\nis like this is so much\nthis is so much more me than anything\ni've experienced before and then what is\nwhat is versions of storytelling and i\nwas like\noh acting\nand the reason i never fell into acting\nis because i'm born and raised in l.a\nand so just like being here i'm just\nlike well do i want to be like everyone\nelse you know like it just it was\neveryone else was doing it and so i\nalmost i wanted to go against the grain\nlike as if mauling wasn't going against\nthe grain but like in my head it was um\nyou were the rebel yeah it was the\nfrappe\num but i didn't i didn't realize\nhow much i loved storytelling and i\nalmost and acting is very interesting\nit's like used it's a tool it's used to\neither get closer to yourself or farther\naway from yourself and i love the idea\nof finding myself in characters because\nlike we really are we're a blank slate\nand then we build our identities and\nwe're like this is me\nand so it's like the way jim carrey\nperceives it i truly do perceive it as\nwell i'm just like i'm so excited to\nlike find new parts of myself in this\ncharacter and so i fall in love with it\nreally quickly\nand so that's when i was like\noh my god i can't why didn't i think\nand so i i went on to acting and i was\nso excited and everything was going so\nwell um booked my first film and and\nthen\neveryone was like hey um\nso there's this uh\nthing that's people are calling it i was\nlike what is happening\nand i was on set from my film\nand everything got shut down like i was\nin oklahoma city and they were like we\nhave to shut down everything i went to\nnew york just to like go there for a\nsecond it was a ghost town it was i was\nlike i've never seen this and i'm sure\neveryone knows what i'm talking about so\ni don't have to go deep into it but it\nwas\ncrazy and i was tripped out and i was\nmortified and i'm sure a lot not more i\nwas i was so s yeah mortified i was so\nsad yeah because\ni'm sure a lot of people felt this like\nthings were moving and like we were it\nwas things were moving and girls my age\nyou know 21 22 23 we're like at our\nstage where we're like young adults and\nlike yeah people are graduating yeah\nlike things are moving and like we're\nstarting to really understand our career\nand that's truly what i felt and then\neverything just stopped\nand i was so sad and then at the time i\nwas also going through a breakup so it\nwas just like this horrible\nlike\ni have nothing to distract myself from\nthe pain of this lesson\nand then also\nyou have to let go of something that you\nnow have fallen in love with so there's\nlike two things i fell in love with that\ni had to let go of and i was like\nnever easy\nglobal pandemic around that yeah and\nthen it was like i was texting my like\nare you guys okay like what's going on\nso that was really crazy and so my god\nsister\nonce again i was like\nhey you should come to hawaii like i'm\nhere hawaii is your place it's me and me\nand hawaii have such an interesting\nrelationship because she's like you\nready to come home i'm like no i don't\nknow i want to be here in hollywood and\nshe's like\nyou need to remember i'm like no i don't\nknow and so it was like that again and\nso i felt that happening again and i was\nlike no i just went through this in 2000\ni don't want to do like a rebirth like i\ndon't want to i don't want to go through\nany pain even though i was already in\npain and clearly i needed to go and fix\nsome things and within myself\nyeah yeah yeah um and\nyes i went back\nto hawaii and it was actually\nvery it was uh it was amazing but in the\nbeginning it was very hard because i\nbasically had no idea what i was doing\num no one did i\ni felt horrible because i was miserable\nand yet i was in a beautiful place so i\nand then that was like there was this\nguilt as well of not being able to\nenjoy it and and i didn't feel right\ncomplaining about any of it but i was\njust in a lot of pain\nand that's when\ni started to\ngo back to what if i'm feeling this way\nlike who else is feeling this way and\nwho else has been feeling this way for a\nvery long time\nand so\nwe are warriors just kind of started it\njust it really it it's interesting it\nstarted as a workout program i was just\nlike i'm just going to create a workout\nprogram but with this workout program\ni'm going to be doing live calls every\nweek with the girls to like like\ntalk to them and keep updated with them\nand\ni'm it just the first live call it was\nvery much about the workout stuff and\nthen the second life call we just\nstarted started kind of talking about\nlike lots and beliefs and experiences\nand and it and i saw the opportunity\nthat i had i mean i had hundreds of\ngirls on this live call and i was like\nthis is the kind of change and i think\nand i've said this before and i'll say\nit again because i believe it's so much\nwe think impact is like so much about\nnumbers and views and and if we don't\nhave a million views on this video it\nwasn't a success or whatever it was\nbut in retrospect that kind of impact\ndoes not work at the same of having 30\ngirls on a live call and i'm talking to\nthem directly about their trauma and\ntheir experience like that i know for a\nfact and like not to get in my head\nmyself but like it's just so powerful\nand profound it's deep it's real it's\ndepth yeah it's real and like substance\ni know that\nmy conversations with that girl is going\nto\nhelp them be a better friend a better\nmother a better like everything because\ni'm helping change their fundamental\nbeliefs and helping them work through\ntheir trauma and so\ni didn't know that i could even do that\nbut because i went through my mom\nbecause i went through all these things\ni can look at pain as pain\nand be like now how do we want to\napproach this what's the story you're\ntelling with the pain and then what is\nthe actual pain and so like separating\nthe two and then figuring out how we\nheal both of them was very it's very\ninteresting and so yeah i felt\num like there was something there and so\ni just slowly started to grow it yeah\nwhat i love about that though is that\ni i think what you just showed there is\nsometimes you just have to start yeah\nlike you don't you don't know exactly\nwhat it's gonna be but if you really\ncare about it and you're present it's\ngoing to teach you how it needs to\nevolve exactly and now you know not to\ntalk about numbers but but to show how\nmuch it's grown it's like you've got\nover 3000 people in over 70 countries\nand it's amazing congratulations\nwhen you first told me about that and i\nremember seeing the articles in forbes\nand just seeing the coverage and i was\njust saying this is amazing like this is\nso special\nand\ntoday when i'm here listening to your\nbackground and your\nmother's coaching of you and schooling\nof you\nand and i could see just how present she\nis and her wisdom is in your life i'm so\nexcited for you to be sharing her\nthrough this as well and that's what you\nsaid that this is what she would have\ndone yeah tell us about what what what\nyou're doing and you're like oh this is\nwhat my mom would have like tell us a\nbit about that she has taught me that\nit's not about\ntrying to help a thousand people it's\nlike it really and this is so cheesy but\nlike i keep saying it to the girls as\nwell in the live calls i'm like you guys\nif you can just make someone smile in an\nelevator life will be a lot better like\nwe're at the point where it's just like\nlet's just enjoy this experience like i\nknow that there's a lot going on and i\nunderstand that and we need to help\nwhere we can but we're all suffering and\nso we should look at that like suffering\nis like what we connect on\nand so then how can we\nbreak through like the the the veil like\nif i can just like crack a joke and make\nsomeone laugh like almost like break the\ncharacter of like i'm just the guy\ndelivering food like that's\nso healing and it's like having an\nhonest it's like you're fueling people\nup so it's almost like you can be\nchargers for these people like you can\nand so\ni am\nbeing chargers for the girls so that\nthey can go out and then be charges for\neveryone else and so\nthat's\none of the things my mom and she was the\nbest listener on the planet tell us\nabout the community more like tell me a\nbit about like\nyou know what what are the ways in which\nwe are warriors is helping the community\nwhat kind of\nsessions do you have online what are the\nkind of themes and topics what are the\nformats structure because i'd love for\nour listeners to get involved yeah and\ni'd love for them to have an opportunity\nto hear about it from you\nyeah so\num we are warriors it's like a\neducational personal wellness\ncommunities so i think communities are\nthe future of social media or at least i\nhope so because then it's like a group\nof people having a common goal that they\ncan accomplish together and i i think\nlike communities with goals is like a\nvery powerful thing and that's what i've\nbeen seeing um and even being\nhomeschooled i was in a community of\nhomeschooling homeschoolers so it's just\nlike very powerful\nso we are warriors it's a set of\ndifferent challenges each month i like\nthe idea of challenges because it gives\nus a finished goal like a finish finish\nline\nand it's exciting\nand so for instance like last month and\nwe tackled different subjects as well\nthat was one of the things because when\ni think personal wellness i think\nthere's like a 365 degree approach\nand i do think fitness is a huge thing\nfor girls just having the motivation\nlike\nfitness is like keeping up with my\nroutine and my body has been the reason\ni am who i am today and i understand\nthat but we like we think of it as vapid\nwe don't think of it but like it\nactually creates it it sets up the day\nfor me\nand so\ncreating a community where the girls\ncould do that together was very special\nso but then i wanted to like expand on\nthat so like in april\nwe had um nicole lapin for the finance\nchallenge to talk about like taxes and\nstuff so i wanted to i just wanted to\ntake girls through courses that i\nknow will help them that are actually\ngoing to help them yeah and it's almost\nlike\nfilling the gaps of the education system\nlike whether it is talking about like\nwe'll have a whole month on mental\nhealth we have um right now we're in\nbeauty month right now where i have like\none of the top skincare women in the\nworld and she's like here having live\ncalls with these girls talking to them\nand coaching through them and then for\nme i can tackle more of like the\nspiritual aspect of like well why is\nthis manifesting on your cheek let's\nlook at that and like\nhaving those deeper conversations where\nwe can really tackle\nevery essence because i realized it was\nlike\nit doesn't matter if you work out every\nday because if you hate yourself it it's\njust it's almost like there's a huge\nwall in between you and your goal and so\nit has to be both there it has to you\nhave to have the manifestation with the\nphysical action\num and so i'm just right now i'm just\ntesting that with different subjects um\nwe i want to have an environmental month\nwhere we have like different people come\non to talk about things that are going\non in the planet um not overwhelming\nbecause not something too overwhelming\nbecause what happened to me i went deep\ninto\nthe plastic pandemic and i almost got\nparalyzed like tell us tell us about\nthat like how can you get so\ninvolved in something that actually\nparalyzes you because it's just that bad\nlike if you i read i think over 10 books\nin the course of a couple months about\nplastic and kind of like what's\nhappening and how we're basically\nfinding it in pregnant lady and their\nplacentas now because the micro plastics\nand we need a credit card a week and\nlike\nit's\nit's it's so scary that it almost it\njust like it i i didn't know i could i\ncouldn't even be me i couldn't even be\nhappy because all i saw was that i was\nlike okay well maybe that's not the\napproach because what happens is like\nyou paralyze and then you just want to\nforget about it so i i want to like\nslowly like ease them in not so much\nabout the facts because the facts are\nreally hard to take in yes we'll talk\nabout facts but it's more of like what\ncan you what are the little things that\nwe can do what what brand can we bring\nalong that backs this that can partner\nit and then we can all just kind of get\nbetter together like is the vibe for me\nis like let's just get better little by\nlittle together like it has to be\ntogether though because what i've seen\nwith the girls is like and what's cool\nabout the community is like they host\ntheir own live calls too like i'm not\nlike if a girl for instance we have\none girl who's um going to law school\nand she's like anybody who like wants to\nlearn about like law and or have\nconversations so they'll have law\nthey'll have conversations so it's\nalmost like um\ni didn't want the community to feel like\nthey're looking at experts yes the goal\nis\nthat they find their inner expert and\nthen they can kind of like shine in\ntheir own live call and that that's when\ni've seen the most transformation\nbecause they can actually put it to\npractice absolutely which like i don't i\ndon't see school does for many people um\nso\nthat's the transformation that we've\nbeen saying is just one the connection\nthat these girls have is actually crazy\ni'm so honored to be a part of it and\nlike facilitate the space for them to be\nall best friends\num and two like the goal is to like\ncreate physical events and like really\ni\ni really think that entertainment and\neducation should go hand in hand like\ni don't under i'm like why do we have\nlike billions of billions of dollars\ngoing into entertainment and yet we\ncan't add like 20 percent of that into\nlike just put education within the\nentertainment yeah it should be fun it\nshould be exciting like it's like i said\nin the beginning like it's what we're\nhere to do is learn and like create\nlearn create learn create it's just like\nthis circle and so it's like\ni don't know finding how to\nre-reignite their passions is\nfor themselves like fall in love with\nthemselves and then reunite the passion\nis\nreally really powerful to me and then by\nhelping these girls like i know that\nwhen they're they become moms they're\nthey're gonna understand not to give\naway their identity because one of the\nthings that i see in moms like so much\nof the time is they just like\nthey just become mom\nand i and i'm like no you're still\nthis girl before you were a mom and\nyou're still and i i i think one of the\nthings that i wish that i wish or i wish\nfor\nall of this to help is\nto make sure that these girls\ncontinue on with who they are and then\nit's like who they are and then they're\nall of the subcategories all of the\ncharacters that they play go below that\num\nbecause i've seen it too much in\nmarriages like the the female just loses\nher identity and then becomes resentful\nit's what happened in my family i've\nseen it way too many times with the\npeople around me i'm just like how can\nhow can we heal this and this is like\nactually an ongoing conversation in my\nhead so\nit's just like yeah no i'm really glad\nyou brought that up i'm working on my\nsecond book right now and i talk a lot\nabout how\nyou know in a partnership\nin any relationship the goal is to\nalways help each other find each other's\npurpose exactly because if you're not\ndoing that like when i think about me\nand my wife when i met my wife i was\nquite clear about what i wanted to do\nand she had loads of talents and skills\nbut didn't quite know what she was going\nto do with them\nand over the last five years of us being\nmarried she's really come into her own\nand she's\nreally growing and flourishing and\nthriving and it's been beautiful to\nwatch\nbut i fully agree with you that it's\nyou can't think that oh no but your\npurpose is just to do this or your\npurpose is just to look out look after\nthe home or your purpose even as a\nwhoever the role is doesn't matter what\ngender you are but the idea of oh your\npurpose is just to make money for the\nhouse like that's not a purpose like we\nall have so much more to do so i love\nthat you brought that up\nbecause you get lost in your role yeah\nyou you get lost in your roles that's\nlike a real thing and that's what i'm\nlearning from acting as well i was like\ndon't get lost in your roles like don't\ndo that like i've i've heard people do\nmethod acting that have actually lost\nrelationships in the real world because\nof that\nand so when i hear that i'm like wow\nexactly well it's a great example of\nwhat we do in real life as well yeah\num because i do think like at some point\nwith like a long-term relationship or\nfriendship whatever it is it's like you\nchoose\nto have them come with you\nand if you're not choosing that then the\nrelationship didn't work not because it\nwas like you didn't bring them along or\nthey didn't or you didn't see where they\nwere going and wanted to come with them\nit is as much as like we love the\nbutterflies and we love all that this is\na team partnership yes like if you go we\ngo yeah you know yeah\nwe go and you can't be someone's purpose\nlike don't try and make it like no i am\nyour purpose like what i do is your\npurpose and my purpose is the same as\nyours it doesn't work it doesn't work\nlike that like you can't\nproject your purpose onto another person\nand expect them to just want to live for\nthat right exactly exactly and then this\nis all of these things i've been\nlearning recently like in the last\ncouple of years especially with like\ngoing through like so many public\nrelationships and having\nthat be\noh god public relationships are\nterrified oh my god after i was like i'm\ngood after\nafter my last public relationship i was\nlike i'm good i'm so good i'm gonna just\nbe me in my own little world no one gets\nno um because\nnot only\nare you creating roles in the\nrelationship but now you have the public\ncreating characters of the people that\nyou are so it's like you're fighting\nlike\nyou're\nit's like you're having conversations\nwith like four different versions of the\nperson you're dating and you're like oh\nmy god like and half of them aren't even\nreal yeah\nit's like a foggy mirror you're just\nlike hello um so that's been really\ninteresting and then i always feel that\nrelationships are\nthe\nbest reflection as to where you are\nright because they're just like i'm just\nyour walking reflection right now that's\nwhy we're in this together right so i i\nalways get excited\nwhen i\nbecause i'm starting to just meet so\nmany amazing people and i think that's\nlike what i've been learning as well is\njust like\nthere's no there's no villain anymore\nit's like we can\nstay together or we can leave\nin good faith and good heart and like\nit's just it's not you know in high\nschool you're just like\nwhat\num now it's just like oh good like you\nyou did me a service by leaving because\nyou were being disserviced to me and you\nfor staying because you didn't feel so\nit's like at the end of the day it's all\nperfect like what can i it's all perfect\nyeah and then trusting that like what\nhelps you trust and accept that when\nmost of our minds hold on to the\nbut it could have been like this or\nbecause i feel that's what it is right\nit's always this battle between\nimagination and reality\nand a lot of us prefer our imagination\nyeah but then we have to yeah and then\nwe have to deal with reality and i oh\ni've read something actually i want to\nread this to you because i think you'll\nlike it wait let me find it let me find\nit i have to read it to you because i\ndon't want to mess it up you know it's\nit's you know when you like try and say\nsomething\nso this is by\njohann wolfgang and he said few people\nhave the imagination\nfor reality ooh\nand i read that and it literally\nlike it really that's like there's\nsomething it packs a punch right it's\nlike\nfew people have the imagination for\nreality and i was thinking\nwow wow like i think my imagination's\ngood but if i had a really good\nimagination i'd be able to accept and\ntrust my reality well you're kind of\nlike i'm a great storyteller and the\nuniverse is like\nsit down\nsit down you can tell it later once it's\nover you can say it's yours but it was\nmine like that's like fully like what i\nexperienced that's beautiful\nyou know it's like\nsit down like you you write it while i\ncreate like you know what i mean like\nyou remember it you tell the story it's\nours you know but it's mine but it's\nours you write i'll edit it yeah and so\nlike that's kind of the relationship\nthat i always see and per your question\nearlier\nimagination and reality it's\ni always at this point with heartbreaks\nthere i don't see it as heartbreak\nanymore i see it as growing pains and\nthat's sometimes even worse because\nyou're just like i was i was good\ni was good with just this like i didn't\ni didn't i don't want to grow like i'm\ngood like i'm tired i just want to like\nwatch netflix and chill like i don't\nwant to evolve anymore\neven though i like just got here in\nretrospect but like it's still and so if\ni look at it as growing pains\nand then\nyou know as because we're all artists\nwe're all artists and so what i'll do\nnow and it's actually so intoxicating is\ni'll\ncreate\ni'll write poetry i'll write music\nbased off of the experience i mean we\nknow all of the biggest artists in the\nworld are like let me tell you about my\nheartbreak\nand then they get they blow up because\nof that and i'm just like\nthat's in all of us and so every single\ntime that i have a new experience of\nheartbreak or just not working out or\nwhatever it is\ni'm like there is\nthere is gold in this pain there's gold\nin this pain and i cannot wait to get it\nout i'm just like\nso i get i get this weird like i get\nheartbroken then i get really excited\nso it goes back and forth it's almost\num\nand i always i always tell people i'm\nlike when someone leaves your life\nit's okay to feel like you're grieving\nand death because the character that\nthey played in your life it's not there\nanymore and so you are grieving someone\nthat's no longer there like you are like\nwhen i get broken up with someone i\ntruly love and i'm crying and i'm in\nthat space it is\nvery similar\npain to when i lost my mom and so like i\nalways reach when any time like my\ngirlfriends me and she's like crying\nstop me i'm just like this is valid\ndon't worry like feel it like feel it\nbecause you lost a character that you\nthought was in this season but it's not\nand like you thought he was going to be\nyour season finale he's not but it's all\ngood there's a season\n60 there's season 40 like you know\nthere's so many seasons in your life so\nit's just\ncoming back to\noh so if if he wasn't meant to be here\nthen\nwhat i attracted was more parts of\nmyself i became more me because he came\ninto my life and that is the biggest\nblessing i could have ever asked for\nlike i\nam a product of everyone that i've dated\nand i've and i've found i've fallen in\nlove with them\nand then those parts that i fall in love\nwith i've like\ni like i took them for myself and so\ni almost i'm getting to the point now\nwhere i don't grieve it anymore because\ni'm like well the person that i was in\nlove with i became\nand so that's so interesting how even if\nthat person wasn't there no the parts\nthat you thought you fell in love with\nlike how powerful it is like\nrelationships always fascinate me\nbecause i've always been a relationship\ngirl and\nseeing\nhow much\npeople grow after relationships it's\nlike i mean you guys have ever seen like\ndon't break a girl's heart you know what\ni mean like it have i just i just\nwatched my sister do this and i'm just\nlike\nshe's gonna be so good after this like\ni'm so excited like i get so excited for\nher because like i just like i love it\nupgrade like\ngirls get hotter like it's just like\nit's such a vibe i i get i get so\nexcited because we need it's almost like\num the fire\nit's like it breaks your heart open so\nyou can light fire and i'm just like yes\nlike let's go so\nit sucks it always sucks um but once\nagain like back to that same belief that\ni had like the more he pulls you back\nit's like a slingshot he'll just like\nlaunch you for it so i just at the\nbeginning of 2020 i was just like\noh this is painful\nthis is painful i wonder what's gonna\nhappen and\nnow it's like i can honestly say i've\nhelped more people than i ever would\nhave meant imagined and\ni'm also like playing with this belief\nand like i think all companies should is\nlike\ncan we just like stop this idea that\nlike\na company or a brand\nliving forever is success because it's\njust it's not like it's not sustainable\nthings evolves and so i always tell\nmyself i'm like whether this company\nstays whether it does that's not the\npoint that was never the point the point\nis is i've helped i would say over now\nlike 10 000 girls truly like actually\nhelp them like speaking to them talking\nto them one-on-one and that i will carry\nwith me they will carry with them like\nthat's good enough\nso it's like it's almost like this is\ngood enough it's okay it doesn't have to\nlast forever none of these things have\nto last forever i feel like we're so\nin in companies in general even though\nthis is a community but like companies\nit's like we're so thirsty\nto just be the monopoly and i'm like no\nyeah what is this world going to look\nlike if we're all trying to be\nmonopolies we can't yeah like\nare you good are you safe you have a\nroof over your head you can host people\nlike you're good\nyou're good like let's now how can we\nreturn the face and do more and it's\nlike\nso i\nthat's kind of where i'm at with weird\nwarriors is like it will continue and\nit's going to be amazing\nbut\nthe impact is already there and i'm so\nhonored to like do have that impact on\nthem you know it's just because it's so\nreal no you i'm so glad that you're\nowning that\nand accepting that because i i couldn't\nagree with you more i think we're\nfascinated with\nlongevity and lasting till the end and\neven in relationships you stretch out\nfar longer than it needs to be just\nbecause we think end means failure\nfailure and and you're so spot on that\nthe impact\nthe end is insignificant really it's\nit's all about what's happening right\nnow in this place right today yeah i\nforget i'm like it's right here fam yeah\nif you're making an impact yeah if\nyou're making an impact on all of these\nwomen today\nand they're impacting each other and\nyou're empowering\nthem to also become their own experts\nand discover their skills i mean\nthat's beautiful yeah and i'm so glad\nthat you made that point because i think\nour\nour obsession with making something last\nis unhealthy everything yeah it's\nunhealthy it's unhealthy it's unhealthy\nand you're only 24. yeah right now yeah\nyeah which is amazing like that's that's\nthat's the insane part here i feel like\ni'm speaking to the oldest soul in the\nworld and then i have to remind myself\nand it's that's that's such a wonderful\nthing because you know you're carrying\nyour mother's energy in such a special\nway yeah no it comes through it's like\nit's it's so\nclear yeah that that you know and it's\ncool too because like for anyone who's\nlost someone\ny'all have a speed dial up there like\nyou guys can just like\ni literally i'm like mom\nand she's\nshe's right there and so i'm like you\nhave the strongest connection to the\nother side or whatever you believe it's\nreally truly whatever you believe\nbecause i'm pretty sure all this is made\nup i mean we're just like i'm sitting on\nan idea right now which trips me out\nsometimes i don't know like it's weird\num but\nit's like we have such a deep connection\nto the other side because we have that\nperson on the other side and so i\nutilize that as much as i can and\nwhenever i forget\num\ni just like i'm like how can i remember\nhow can i remember i think that's where\ni am right now i just i i will\num it's always the environment too so\nlike\ni'll juice incense i'll make lights\ncandles and i'll just sit down and i'll\nremember like whether that's just\nsitting in silence it's helping me\nremember but\nor just writing until something else\ncomes out that's what it's or talking to\na friend about it like i\ni think i'm at and i think we're all at\nthat point where it's not it's not so\nmuch you're learning something new\nit's almost you're just remembering\nwhat was already there on top of\neverything else per what my sister said\nabout the onions and just unraveling it\nand so um\nit's constantly coming back to that but\nlike i still you know still suffer like\nwe all suffer like it's all good it's\nall good\nhow have you got through that you know\nyou talked about this earlier and i\nthink\nyou've experienced this like you've and\nand i love what you said because we were\nwe were connecting on this beforehand\nand i i sometimes feel the same way\nbecause i thought i was going to be a\nmonk and that's\nliterally what i\nbuilt up so before that i had so many\npassions but my parenting was ignore the\npassion do the safe thing\nand so my passions were music my\npassions were spoken word and my passion\nwas philosophy do you still write spoken\nbooks i do i do yeah it's it's such a\npassion for me and i feel like a lot of\nmy videos and a lot of my content is\nstill\nwordplay and and has so much i still use\nthis spoken word in a different way\ntoday exactly and so that's so much a\npart of my life but it was like do the\nsafe thing and so i was studying\nbusiness and i thought i'd be an\ninvestment banker or a consultant or\nwhatever any of that stuff and then i\nbecame a monk that became my dream\nand\nmom dad yeah literally like from all of\nthat to that but even letting go of that\ni would say i'm most myself in what i do\ntoday\nand being a monk was part of that but\nit's not all of me\nand being in media which is what i am\nnow is not all of me it's a part of me\nand then being in the world of business\nwas a part of me it's not all of me and\ni think you are so right that we limit\nourselves we feel society limiting us\nand we feel we have to choose to be one\nthing and i think that the fact that\nyou're 24 years old and you've allowed\nyourself\nto continue to do this and you still do\ntoday i think that's so wonderful\nbecause i think a lot of people stay\nstuck until\nagain\nwanting to make something last yeah\nwanting to make something last and like\nevery single thing and i i will say this\nwith absolute certainty like every\nsingle thing that any of you guys have\nbeen doing and that you feel like was\nthe thing and then it's not it is\nserving yes\nwhat your thing is like ballet i spent\nliterally 20 almost 20 years every day\nfour five six hours a day i would be on\npoint and my feet still hurt you know\nlike it's just like but\nbecause of that it's translated into\nstorytelling i know how to use my body\nmy work ethic is insane i understand i\nknow how to take direction there is\ni know how to feel when i move like it\nis literally serviced me in everything\ni've done and so it's just it's almost\njust like being okay with\nletting it go but then you don't\nactually let it go it's always there\nthat's the thing it's like it's always\nthere serving you yeah um\nand so that's that's how i feel with\npretty much everything i do my mom said\nanother thing my mom said is like she\ngoes um just be passionately curious\nbecause\nput so much pressure on us so my mom\nwould always just be like just be\ncurious\nlike just like follow your curiosities\nand if if it doesn't lead you anywhere\njust be like oh that was interesting and\nthen go over here and so that's that's\nwhat i do and like given i do i still of\ncourse have big dreams but like i let my\ncuriosity\ntake me\nlike\nand i don't\nthe big dream is not the goal it's like\nthe little moments that get up to it\nright right so like when i'm\nwhen i'm having a director meeting and\ni'm like talking to them about\na role or whatever it is it's like my\nintention in that call is to make the\ndirector feel good not to get the part\nand so just like having those little\nindirect of like wow that's such a huge\nthing you just dropped yeah\nthat's a huge thing it's who you are\nit's who all of us are it's like if you\ncan\nstop going well this is my goal to like\nmy intention i think intentions are\nactually the most underrated most\npowerful things i've ever like i still\nlearn about how we have an intention 24\n7 with everything every single thing we\ndo we just like sometimes we're aware of\nit sometimes we're not and so when you\ncan put an attention an intention on\nsomething before you do it it's\nit's crazy how powerful it is so it's\nlike i always make sure because at the\nend of the day and this is kind of what\nwe're all looking for i think even more\nso than the diploma than the thing and\nthe degree is someone that we connect to\nsomeone that we feel close to someone\nthat we almost feel like we've already\nmet before like that essence comes from\nthe intention\nof making that person feel connected\nnot from\ni hope i'm right for this i hope i'm\nthis and so like i whenever i hire from\nmy company that's my intention i was\nlike i don't really i don't care where\nyou went to college like\nwhy would i care like i care about who\nyou are like what like what's your like\nwhat's your intention like\nhow are you gonna be fun to work with\nlike are we gonna because ideally i want\nyou to be in this for the long run and\nso do i wanna be talking to you for the\nnext five to ten years like what does\nthat look like and so having that\nperspective on when it comes to jobs\nwhen it comes to\nmeetings anything ever is like the human\nconnection should go first no matter\nwhat no matter how bad you want it like\nthe human connection is first um that's\nactually\nbeen the best like magic trick my mom\ntaught me because it's like it it always\nit always provides what i need and then\nwhat the other person needs so for\ninstance i was like\nvery excited for this role that i almost\ngot a couple weeks ago i was very\nexcited won't say any names\nand\nhe was so sweet and we were talking\nwe're having such a good time and i\nreally understood the character and it\nwas really great but then you know\nbecause i don't i'm not very experienced\nin the space he was like we're gonna\nchoose someone else and i was like\nthat's completely fine but then i was\nsitting in meditation and i had this\nurge to write him an email and i didn't\ni didn't know why because my goal wasn't\nnecessarily to get the part i just\nalmost felt like the the connection of\nme and him wasn't finished and so i just\nsent him a thank you and i was like\nthank you so much for speaking giving me\nyour time like learning about me because\nwho i am matters because you need to get\nto know if i fit the character like all\nof these things and because of that it\nalmost solidified our relationship and\nthat but that wasn't my intention my\nintention was just like this isn't over\ni don't know why and i'm just gonna sit\ndown and see so like listening to\nalmost like letting it overpower whether\nor not\n[Music]\nwhat happened it's like if you don't\nfeel like it's finished like go in there\nwith the intention\nthat\nyou want to just solidify the mirror\nthat you guys are reflecting towards\neach other as opposed to like the\nopportunity that's kind of on the\nsidelines yeah um so that's been a huge\ntool huge it's like actually like the\nprobably the reason i'm here to be\nhonest\nso\nshout out tool did you say\ni love that today i've discovered how\nfunny you are which is great which is\nreally awesome which is really awesome\nso i i love that we're going to have so\nmany memes made out of this interview\nfor you\nthere's going to be so many great ones\nalexis is there something that i haven't\nasked you about that's like on your mind\nyou're like i have to share this i want\nto share i want to say this uh before we\ngo into the final five but i want to\nknow if there's anything that you're\nfeeling intuitively as you are just\nthank you so much like actually thank\nyou so much i'm gonna deteriorate just\nlike saying it but thank you i feel like\ni don't know\nit was weird like once i finally\nsolidified this\npodcast with you\nthere something like clicked inside of\nme and i was like\nlike i am becoming the person i want to\nbe and like i and so just like thank you\nfor showing that to me because it really\ni i'm not yeah i just thank you i have\nno i just like words don't they they're\nnot it right now so but thank you\nyeah so just that's it that's all i have\nto say\ni love that i love that that means the\nworld to me and and i'm and i'm hoping\nthat\nthat synergy and synchronicity continues\nand you know this is the beginning of a\ngreat friendship so\nthat's that's that's my hope i i really\nbelieve that\nhonestly the podcast for me has either\nbeen a place where\ni had a lot of relationships offline\nthat people didn't know the types of\nconversations we were having and so the\npodcast was a great way of me sharing\nhey i'm really good friends with the\nperson this is what we talk about\nand i want everyone to hear it\nand then it's also been the opposite\nwhere it's been like here's someone i'm\nreally interested to get to know\nand i wanted to start a friendship and\nso it's perfect yeah and so the podcast\nfor me has been so much more than and\nit's what you're saying about a\ncommunity more than a company or a brand\nlike the podcast for me is not a\nshow like that's that's not the point of\nit like it's it's a it's a way i can get\nto know humans that i'm interested in or\ni find interesting and help people learn\nabout them so actually i should be\nthanking you\nbecause\nyou know i think sitting down with you\ntoday has just\ncompletely blown my mind and opened up\nmy mind to just so many possibilities as\nto\nhow\nsomeone\nwho's navigated so many stressful\nsituations and i think the closer you\nget to it the more you realize how hard\nit is so when i was a young kid and i\ngrew up in london i knew no one in the\nentertainment industry i was not in la\nor hollywood everyone in my area was you\nknow\nnot going off to work in anything to do\nwith the world i mean now\nand because of that you look at people\nand you go oh life must be easy for you\nyou guys have money you guys have fame\nuh you guys are attractive you you life\nwhy are you complaining right and as\ni've got closer to the industry closer\nto people that i coach that i work with\nclients of mine\ni've only just had more compassion\nfor everyone\nboth the people that are\nlike me sitting back there judging and\nthen both the people are in this\nsituation because i realized we're all\njust feeling some type of pain\nand the more we can rise to that point\nwithout judgment\nthe better it's going to be for us\nbecause we can evolve together yeah if\nwe expect anyone who's successful to be\nalways happy then what we're saying is\nwhen i become successful i have to\nalways be happy\nand that pressure is right back on us\nit's interesting how that works and it's\nalmost like um\nyeah anything that we direct outwards\nis an exact manifestation of what's\ngoing to happen inside of us and so we\nhave to be so careful with our words\nlike i don't why do you think they call\nit spelling\nspells like i'm like wow\nthat's that's good i've not heard that\nbefore i like that that's good the words\nare like i am oh my god\nwhen i hear girls say like i am\nugly or i am i'm just like\nno\nno like you can no i i refuse to let you\nsay that about yourself because you\nwould never say that about your daughter\nyou would never say that about your\nfriend and so it's\nit truly is like having these honest\nconversations with anyone at any level\nhas been eye-opening to me and that's\none of the reasons why i've always loved\nthe podcast so much because i got to\nactually just see\nthe person and not the characters that i\nsee them play\nin life um\nso that's really it's really inspiring\nand then also knowing that\npain happens on any level like pain is\npain you know like\nme\nlosing someone from a breakup is just as\npainful as me losing my mom to death and\ni was like that was a weird that was\nweird i was like and you almost feel\nguilty or like you feel like can i feel\nthat do i allow myself to so it's like\nyeah validating on any level because\nthat's actually what connects us as well\nand and i almost feel like until we\num we have\nthe goal right now is to to connect at\nevery level of being human and then from\nthere i mean i i'm pretty sure like an\nevolution would happen which would be\nreally cool that'd be really cool i'd be\nlike whoa\ncan you imagine if we had everyone at\nthe same time be like love yeah\ncan you\nthat would be crazy i've heard i'm sure\nyou've like heard of those stories where\nlike um\nthey have like monks praying at same at\nthe all at the same time like three\nthousand months or whatever and like the\ncrime rates goes down in the city\ni've definitely heard i've seen studies\non that before yeah same um but just\nthose kinds of scenarios would be like i\nthink that's\nthe i that that's what that's what my\nwork\nwould ideally my like\nhard work i guess is what it's there for\nis to like have just\nmore moments of like just people being\nan absolute like love and even when i\ncan facilitate like we were talking\nabout hosting and how like it's like\nthe big house if you're not\nputting everyone in it like posting it\nlike why do i have balcony i'm not gonna\ndo anything on it like i'm gonna have\nall my friends like there and like host\npeople and like why do i have more than\none bedroom so i can let my friends be\nthere and like just hosting and having\nthat environment where like we come\ntogether and bring like real connection\nit is so it's it's helping the planet so\nmuch more than we know i've got two more\nquestions for you before we go into the\nfinal five because i've just there's so\nmany things i can talk to you about uh\nthe first question i want to ask you was\naround your passion for acting now\nso\nyou know what right now is making you so\npassionately curious about acting what\nis it about\nroles what is it about your development\nas an artist\nthat connects you so much to acting\nit's it's almost like proving to myself\nhow many\ndifferent\nperson or identities i can be i think\nit's like\nwe almost i feel\neven though i seem outgoing i'm actually\nquite terrified all the time\num and i would say i'm like an ambiver\nlike an in-between\nbut when it comes to\nacting i don't have a choice\nlike i have to show up as this person\nif i'm nervous like it doesn't matter\nand like once i'm not thinking about\nlines once i'm like in that state where\ni just like have it memorized to the\nheart and i can just be there\num\nit's it's similar to flow state i'm sure\nyou've written i've read all i love flow\nstate\nyeah i love this it is the goal yes for\neverything always\nso it puts me in flow state basically i\ndon't there's no time i don't remember\ni'm not thinking about myself i'm not\nthinking about my body i'm not thinking\nthere's it's just i'm just here\nand like similar similar to the way like\nwhen you surf like you're on a wave it's\nlike it's those like 30 seconds of just\nlike i blacked out i wasn't even there\nno and you're saying that you can\nactually surf so you've actually had\nthat experience\nlike most people use that analogy but\nwe've never served so but you actually\nsaid\nyeah yeah just like any but you can\nactually surf yeah i deserve decently\nnot good enough to the point where i'm\nlike\nthat guy in the surf being like where'd\nyou catch my wave bro i'm like but just\nthose moments like i think i'm right now\ni'm just searching for those moments in\nmy life i'm just like\nwhen am i am i going to forget time here\nam i going to free up time here and so\nacting is just one of those things that\ni've\nseen is such a powerful\nand also it's it's best because i get to\nlose track of time with another person\nand i feel like like connection is so\nstrong for me and so it's like i\nremember oh my god this was such a cool\nmoment on my first set\num it was an older actor he's been\naround for a long time i'm sure you know\nhim i don't remember his name but he was\nvery very kind and we had a scene\ntogether where he was kind of just like\num\nlike getting in my face about something\num basically saying that i like wasn't\nworthy or what i don't know and i was\njust like i got this i got this\ni got this scene don't worry guys um\nand he was like getting my face and i\njust remember a moment where like we\nlike lost i just it was i just wasn't\nthere and he wasn't there and it was\njust a pure moment and i wasn't acting\nand i was actually feeling everything\nand then afterwards he comes to me and\nhe looked at me at crafty's the little\nuh snack area he was like you get it\nhe was like you get it don't you i was\nlike\nyeah and he was like keep doing it kid\nlike keep doing it it's amazing\nand he was like you get it\nand he was like\nhe almost it was almost as if he like\nsaid like\nyou're closer to\nsource in those moments like and so he\nlooked at me like you get it and i just\nflipped out after because i was eating\nbanana being like i did it i did it\ni get it and so after that i was like\nokay this is like what i meant to do now\nfor now i guess\nand like we'll see where that goes\num but yeah i just once again like the\nintention\nthe paths change but the intention stays\nthe same\nso i think that's what keeps me that\nagain loved that i just love that yeah i\ncouldn't agree more yeah i think that's\nbeen a challenge for so many people we\ntry and keep our path the same\nand then but we don't know our attention\nyeah but keeping your intention the same\nand the path changing oh i can so relate\nto that so back to those notes yeah like\nany intentions that you guys have like\nany of it just\nwrite it down so at least you just know\nyeah you just know because i forget my\nintentions of course yeah you have to\nrepeat them daily i repeat them daily in\nmy prayer in my affirmation\nat the beginning and end of the day i\nhave to exactly exactly and then from\nthere it almost like i\nand this is this may be a weird belief\nbut i've been seeing this a lot in my\nlife all the best things in my life i\ndidn't work for\nand i keep seeing that as a pattern i'm\nlike maybe god maybe god doesn't want us\nto struggle like the way like\nit's because everything that i've\nstruggled for wasn't meant for me so\nthat's been really interesting if almost\nbeing like\nyou take the rings like you take the\nreins i'll create the intention but you\ncreate the story and like i'll trust the\npath and like whatever that is like\nlet's go like let's make it fun right\nbecause like i i do feel like\nthe more you can give\nto god to like if he gives you like a\nball a red ball for instance like\nlike if you have fun and you're playing\nwith it he's going to be like oh he's\nshe's playing with it i'll give her\nsomething else like and it's just like\nit's almost like entertain like show him\nor show the universe that like you're so\nstoked of what it gave you that it wants\nto give you more like you almost you\nknow when like you have i have a puppy\nher name's angel and whenever i give her\na treat she's so stoked that i ever\ntreat that i'm like i gotta give you\nanother one\nand so like i almost feel like that's\nand then when i walk my dog and she like\nis not least trained yet so she'll just\nbe like like choking yourself out trying\nto like go everywhere and i'm just like\nis this what i look like\noh no i learned so much from dogs also\nwhen a dog\nmy dog is obsessed with a ball\none ball in particular it's gross i\ncan't believe she still has it i'm just\nlike oh my god um\nso obsessed with this ball and i'm like\nthat is amazing and literally her only\ngoal with this ball is to give it back\nto me so that i can throw it so she can\ncatch it so i can give it back to her\nshoot there's there's no point to this\nwhatsoever and so it showed me i was\nlike\ndo it just for the act like don't do it\nfor like the the idea the goal or the\ndream just just do it and so like\nwhenever i play ball with her i practice\nthat i'm like i'm acting just because\nit's fun because i just do it or i'm\ncreating this company because it's fun\nand i just this is just what i do like i\njust it's just fun and like because\nevery single time i've gotten caught up\nin like the huge image of things is like\nwhen i've lost sight\nof my heart's path and i'm just like ah\nyeah so\nbut the greatness isn't within that path\nlike for sure but it's never like the\nsame path as you would see because it's\nliterally just you playing with a ball\nand you're just like what's the point\ngod yeah like just wait like just keep\ndoing it for fun yeah yeah keep doing it\nfor fun you're doing it for fun and so i\nalmost and like now that i'm 24 i'm i'm\nin this adult life and i'm just like\ndo i need to get serious now\ndon't don't do it it's a trap it's a\ntrap\nbut it's so strong you i feel it heavy\non me now like i need a schedule i need\nto wake up this time\nand god's like no you're not lazy if you\nsleep in that's a belief let's get rid\nof that like no you're not like did you\nno it's just\nliterally i'm now taking off layers that\ni just got i'm like whoa what is this\nwhat and now that i'm coming into my\nmid-20s i'm just like\nwhat\nis this not supposed to be fun anymore\nbecause like that's what i've heard and\nthat's what i like see a lot of times\nbut i just refuse because it's so\ninspiring to meet\ni have a few friends that are like i\nwould say like in their 50s or 16s and\nthey're like\nchildren having the best in their life\nyeah their life and everything works out\nfor them everything works out for them\nand i'm just like\nthat is\nif i'm gonna tell a story i'd rather it\nbe like that yeah i've added play back\ninto my life so much like play is like\none of my number one values that's why i\ngot a dog in life yeah you're going to\nthe park yes not for the dog for you but\nyou're going to the park yeah i just\nwant more play in my life and there was\na there was a beautiful quote by richard\nbranson where he said that\nyou know you don't stop playing because\nyou get old you get old because you stop\nplaying\nand and i love that because it's it's\nbeen so big for me i'm at a place in my\nlife where i'm like i play is a huge\nvalue and it sounds insane and people\ndon't get it i just got back from miami\ni was there for two weeks and we were on\na really busy schedule we were working\nfrom like 8am to 9pm every single day\nbut at 9pm every day we'd go and play\npaddle tennis from 9 to 11. yes and i\nfelt like a kid every night where i was\njust waiting to be out in the paddle\ncourt and i was just like have you ever\nplayed paddle tennis okay it's amazing\nit's it's i i am the biggest advocate of\nthis sport i've introduced many\nbut but play is just such a big value\nfor me now yeah and even when i'm with\nfriends i'm like what can we do that's\nplayful that's playful like we've been\ni've been doing crazy things with\nfriends like archery and like painting\nlessons and whatever it is because i\njust want to play you just want to play\nand it it it's\nit's where we create new passions play\nis where we create new passions so also\nboredom i i\nalways am like bornhem is so valuable\nespecially now with our phones and like\nall of this instant gratification and\nwe've heard a million times and it's all\nknown now but like\nfor real though like i can't even drive\nwithout being like\ndon't text and drive but look at all\nthese billboards yeah you know it's\nweird i'm just like they're telling and\nit's just all of this is trying\neverything is trying to get your\nintention everything is trying to get\nyour attention like to the tea\nand so i'm like okay\nhow do i work against this and it's only\ngoing to get probably more intense i\nwould assume so\num\nso that's like literally i'll say it\nagain that's why i got a dog that's like\nfully why i got a dog because i was like\ni need something that's i'm gonna get\nbad news on the phone i'm like okay bye\nand then the dog's just like\nokay here so you know how like in any\nlike disney like movie like pixar\nwhatever there's always a sidekick yes\ntangled the chameleon like there's a\nbunny and the abominable snowman yeah\nthere is always like this really funny\ncomical relief olaf in frozen yeah\nspirit animal yeah\ni was like i need to i want a sidekick\nlike i want that idiot that's just like\nrunning and hitting a wall while i'm\ntrying to like do business like i can we\nneed that like that's so cool yeah so\nlike movies are so powerful in the way\nthat they like kind of they give us\ncharacters to like replicate and so i've\nalmost like whenever i watch a movie i'm\njust like i like that character like\nthat character is really cool like one\nof the shows that i actually like loved\ngrowing up with is entourage yeah okay\ni've got a funny story to tell you about\nandroid so i was a monk when entourage\nwas famous so i never watched it so i\ndidn't know what it was so my wife just\nmade me watch entourage so we literally\njust finished it\nit's one of the best shows ever it's\namazing yeah\ni would watch it i i would watch it\nagain i loved it i literally just\nwatched it this year exactly so it's\nlike you have like the characters around\nyou that are just like they're\nthey're so needed and you don't know why\nbut they're so needed like they're so\nimportant to the story and that's how i\nlook at all of my friends i'm like you\nguys are so like\ncreating your your your your show like\nis like in in a healthy way of course\nbecause but it's taught me a lot like\nas much as hollywood is very um toxic\nand and dangerous in ways but it's also\na great way to get to understand how you\nwant your life show to go like it's just\nlike i can find\nparts of myself in different\nlike uh have you watched dave yet no oh\nno no i have what what's the first\nseason not the second gator yeah i need\nto get it in my life yeah like he's so\nfunny i was just like he's just like\nhe's there always making jokes always\nthere always holding it together always\nholding strong like you need that per\nand sometimes it's you that's that\nperson but i always that really helps me\njust like understand the the thing i'm\ndoing so but the sidekick thing is like\nactually you guys like it really helps\nlike i can't tell you how many times i'm\nlike so upset and then angel like\nrolls over it falls off the bed like\njust i love it the funniest the edge is\namazing\ni love it all right alexis i'm going to\ntake you through our final five okay\nthese are the fast fives you have to\nanswer them in one word to one sentence\nmaximum that's all you can say\nokay so you can do you can't even read\nthese you can no no no no you didn't\nread them yeah no no you should i didn't\nyou shouldn't read them\nokay so the first quote and i i changed\nthem on the day anyway so it doesn't\nmatter if you do read them because i\njust ask what i want to ask okay let's\ngo okay so question number one is\nuh what is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\ni would i would just have to bring it\nback to what my mom said about being\ncurious instead of passionate\num it takes the edge off of so many\ngreat um so much pressure yeah it's just\nlike just be curious\nand stay teachable be curious and stay\nteachable\nawesome great answer what's the worst\nadvice you've ever received\nlike you can only i would say like you\ncan only be one thing in a life is like\ni've just been learned i've just been\ntaught so much that like\nyou're an accountant\nor you're a lawyer\nor you're an and now we're living in a\nworld where it's like you can be all of\nthose things you can be all of those\nthings and so i just\nsaying like oh you can only be one thing\nin life is probably\nthe most wrong thing anyone's ever said\nto me for sure that's a great answer\ngreat answer all right uh third question\nin one sentence explain what is your\ncurrent purpose or intention um\ni think my intention currently\nwould be\ni almost want to say in this and it\nchanged honestly this week is to just\nshare\nmore of myself by\nby learning about myself publicly i\nwould and it's usually because a couple\nmonths ago my intention was like\nto help evolve consciousness in whatever\nway but now i really feel like\nit's my and i hope this isn't taken the\nwrong way but um\ni'm just really excited to to share\nmyself like i'm i've worked so hard to\nbe who i am and i'm not like afraid nor\nscared to say that i love myself and i'm\nreally\nhonored to be who i am and like i'm\ngonna continue to work and continue to\nbe better but like sharing more of\nmyself without the fear of rejection\nwould be my intention and so like in all\naspects of vulnerability\nyeah\nthat's a beautiful answer thank you i\nlove that yeah that's awesome all right\nquestion number four is\nwhat's the biggest lesson you've learned\nin the last 12 months since launching\nuh we are worries\nfor yourself oh yeah um\nfor myself i mean for myself i would say\num\nyou are what you've always wanted to be\nthat's really that's really weird when\nyou like when as soon as you decide you\nwant to be something you already are\nthat it's now it's just about proving to\nyourself that you already but you\nalready are like you already manifested\nit and for like the girls\ni would say um\ni've learned a lot about teaching and\nhow that works because i've always been\ncurious like how do we teach kids and\nhow do we keep it to stick and or keep\nit sticking when they learn it and like\nthat um\nbest way to teach is to be the example\nand we've heard that so many times\nbut i've had to personally step up as a\nmentor\nand\nshow that it's not about\nme listening to a story and being like\nthis is what you did wrong this is how\nyou should evolve it's like me being\nlike hey guys so this is usually how all\nthe live calls are\nhey guys\nso today this this happened to me this\nweek let's talk about this subject of\nletting go but knowing when to let go\nand then\nironically every single girl in the live\nwas like\ni was feeling this way too this weekend\nso there is this like innate connection\nof like if you can grow from each lesson\nthat happens the day or the day of and\nthen just like be present with the\nexperience and then show education in\nthat way\num that's when you can help people\nevolve the quickest i believe i think\ni'm just like at a speed thing like it's\nall like quick so you have to be it i\nlove it awesome fifth and final question\nokay\nif you could create one law in the world\nthat everyone had to follow what would\nit be\nuh you have to go outside\nat least an hour a day\ni think would be\nbecause that's what i do in nature in\nnature\nbarefoot preferably um\none to just acknowledge it yeah\nto acknowledge it um and also to like\ngrow a love for it to like care to see\nit\num and it's also for your health i mean\nwe get like we're like oh why is our\nhealth decline i'm like when we're\neating fake food we're watching fake\nthings where um you know have we don't\nhave the best air anymore because of\neven plastic itself like there's a lot\nof\nthings that we have to combat now our\nwater is not that good like there's so\nmany things that we find invisible but\nit's like always there and so\nmaking the most of it even\nif it's\ngo sit on a rock talk to an aunt like\ni've done very weird things when it\ncomes to nature but like it's very like\nwhat's the weirdest thing you've ever\ndone i'm asking you a sixth question i'm\nbreaking all my rules ah what's the\nweirdest thing i've ever done\nwell one time i like would talk to a\ntree for like an hour so that was weird\nthat was like i was very outside of my\ncomfort zone do you ever do it when\nyou're like doing something so weird you\nget goosebumps yeah alexis for sure stop\nlike for sure but you feel like\nit's activating something like whenever\ni get goosebumps i'm like something's\nhappening yeah and so i just\ni pretended the tree was like\nlike mother nature i mean i guess it is\ni didn't pretend but i pretended it was\nlike you know pocahontas with the tree\nlike that was like kind of what i was\ntrying to go for\nand i just like talked to it for i would\nsay about an hour and it was the most\nlike beautiful thing it was also really\ncheesy and stupid but i it was yeah just\nhaving a conversation with nature\nherself was really cool\nit's beautiful yeah everyone alexis ren\nthat's your final five done everyone if\nyou wanna go and join the we are worries\ncommunity we're gonna

cool see what i mean\nyeah and i love that i just want to\nleave that with everyone that thing that\nalexa said blew my mind like it was\nreally powerful\nso\nshe said something about once again\nthere are two things now that now that i\nwas saying there was one thing there\nwere actually lots of things there were\nlots of things but there were two things\nuh\nthere is gold in pain that really stuck\nwith me you said that there is there is\ngold in pain\nand the second one was that you know\nlike being passionate or being curious\nabout something is when you forget time\nand that was and that's what we just did\nlike i literally looked down i'm like\nyou've been here like we started\nrecording about one hour 15 minutes\nprobably one hour 45\nand yeah we've we've been talking
