something wrong um\nthey attributed everything to my lack of\nsleep and that i worked too hard and all\nof these things and\nand then they eventually found out that\nit was thyroid cancer and\ni call it my baby cancer because there\ni knew from the very beginning that\nthere is a very small\nvery small minute chance that it could\nbe life-threatening\ni did know that but what i didn't\nrealize\ni

then and then like two\nseconds later yeah i do i feel like it's\nthe\nthe quickest way to feel somebody's\nenergy and their warmth and\nand to let them know that it's a safe\nplace and so i i try to give\nreally meaningful loving hugs i love\nthat now i'm scared what you could read\nthrough my hugs yeah\nnow like oh my god like this is about\nyou this interview yeah\nbut no this is such a wonderful\nopportunity for me\nand the audience to get to learn more\nabout you your story your background\nand we almost wouldn't be having this\nconversation if you\nended up becoming a swimmer it's true\nright very true i thought that that's\nwhat i was supposed to do you know i\nthink so many times when we're little\nand you find something that you\ngravitate towards because you're good at\nit\nit's not really necessarily something\nyou enjoy doing and i think there is a\nvery big difference between\nwhere you find your joy and what you're\ngood at and sometimes\nthere is a it's they're not the same\nthing you know and for me\ni was i i was a very good swimmer and i\nhated it um so when i got hurt\nit was like this weird crazy blessing in\ndisguise where it finally gave me the\ncourage to say to my parents\ni don't really want to do this anymore\nand it was my path you know that was\nsort of where i saw myself going and\nand it took me a while to figure out\nwhat i wanted to do after that but my\nmom was very\ninstrumental in getting me out of the\nhouse and getting me like\nto to go try new things and she found\nthis\nthis ad in the paper to go be kirsten\ndunstan's body double\nand she was like let's just get her out\nof the house like she's so sad right now\nand\nand so i went down and they had said\nyou're you know you're too\ntall you're too big to be kirsten dunn's\nbody double but um do you want to\naudition for this part do you know how\nto act and of course\ni was like absolutely i know how to act\nand i was terrified and i went home and\nmy mom helped me memorize that and i\nbooked the job\nand sort of like never looked back yeah\nwow yeah i love that and i love how\nit's sometimes something negative that\nhappens to us that actually awakens us\nto what we're meant to do\nyeah and we're all so different i was\nbegin and because you spoke about\nswimming i was speaking at a conference\nlast week and\nmichael phelps spoke spoke uh after me\nand he was talking about mental health\nwhich is he's such a big proponent\nyeah which is incredible but you know he\nwas talking about how all he wanted\nto do was swim and all he knows how to\ndo is swim in here we have someone\nyou're saying that\nactually i could do that but i was good\nat it but i didn't love it like i wasn't\npassionate about it i wasn't passionate\nabout it it didn't give me any joy i\ni hated going to practice i just i\nreally didn't enjoy it but i didn't have\ni didn't grow up in a family where we\ntalked about emotions and so for me\nto go home and say to my mom and dad you\nknow i don't enjoy this i don't get\njoy out of this i don't i don't think\nthat they would have understood that i\nthink they would have just been like but\nyou're good at it i don't understand\num and so it took that injury for me to\nbe able to pursue something that i\nactually something\nwhere i could actually experience joy\nwow i love this actually and i know you\nsaid that you\ndid one of my courses recently yeah but\nwhat you're saying right now is\nresonating so closely with me because\ni've got a new course coming out and in\nthat i talk about this quadrant of\npotential\nyeah and i talk about how we waste most\nof our lives in this box\ncalled what we're good at but don't love\nyes and and where we really want to be\nspending most of our time is\nthings that we're not good at but do\nlove yeah or things that we're good at\nand do love and now you've found that\nwell that's the thing is that i think a\nlot of times the thing that you're good\nat you have to struggle\nto love and and when you love something\nbecoming good at it is easy it's because\nyou love it\nso i think that that's that's one of the\nmain things that i my dad used to always\nsay to me that find what you love\ndoing and then figure out how to make\nthat your career that was his\nhis best advice to me that he'd ever\ngiven me because in it so many people\nsay very similar things about like you\nknow\num you'll never work a day in your life\nif you find something you enjoy things\nlike that but he really\nhammered that home for me and and um and\nthat's\ni think what led me to to acting where\ndid that journey start then from being a\nbody double to now\nbeing in the industry for two decades\nyeah and like working to improve your\nart your skill that mastery that you're\nspeaking about\nlike obviously acting came upon you and\nit became a thing but then how did you\ngo through that process of\nreally developing your skills in your\nheart you know it's i\ni like to say that i'm an overpaid\ncompulsive liar\nand i i think that acting is all about\nconveying an emotion and getting someone\nto believe it\num and so for me i never studied\ni just um i learned how to fake it for a\nvery long time\nand because that's all i knew how to do\num and then\ni was on battlestar galactica and i\nwasn't taking it very seriously and\neddie almost actually pulled me aside\nand he gave me\nthe lecture of all lectures and said to\nme that if you actually tried\ni think he would actually be really good\nat it and i was like what do you mean\ni'm already here and\nand he he was very serious he was like\nyou have an opportunity\nthat so many people wish they had and\nyou've got to take it seriously\nand i wasn't you know at that point i\nwas 21 years old\nand i was just having fun and i realized\nthat you can\nyou can have fun while still taking\nresponsibility and and taking something\nseriously\num and but it was a weird road for me it\nwas very\nstrange i i um i did fall sort of right\ninto\na job which was great um but i\nfought a lot against the the norm and\nwhat people wanted me to be they saw me\nas this little blonde girl and they\nwanted me to play a very specific role\nand i wasn't drawn to those roles i\ndidn't have the courage to say no\ni don't want to do that i want to do\nsomething else until battle star came up\nand it was this role that was this tough\nyou know take no prisoners honest woman\nwho wasn't scared of anything\nand it's who i wanted to be i was not\nthat person but i was so\ndrawn to her as a role model for myself\nthat i was desperate to play her and i\nwouldn't take no for an answer\num and i think i auditioned for it like\nsix or seven times and i just wouldn't\ngo back\nlike i just wouldn't quit i just kept\ngoing back um\nand i don't know how i got it but you\nknow by the grace of god i did\nbut it was it was one of those weird\nthings where\ni never i never took no for an answer in\nthis business if somebody told me no\nit i never took it personally i just\nwent okay great let's move on to the\nnext one\num and i didn't have a plan b\ni i didn't think failure was an option\nand i think that that was just the\nblissful ignorance of a child\nbut i i just didn't think\nthat failure was going to happen and so\ni i pushed through\num and my parents allowed me to do that\nyou know they sort of saw how driven i\nwas and just went okay i guess she's\ngonna do this\nyeah i love that so you're saying\nactually you auditioned six to seven\ntimes\nand so you heard that no that many times\nyeah\nwhat do you think it was for you that's\nhelped you push through\na no every time you hear it and i love\nthe way you said that you know you\ndidn't take it personally\ntell me about how you were able to\nbecause i think\ntoday when we hear the word no we all\ntake it personally it's very common and\ni know a lot of people\nlistening right now or watching right\nnow will think well when i hear no i\njust think like oh i'm not good enough\nor\ni don't have what it takes like how did\nyou take that no yeah it\nyou know i think one of one of the best\nthings we can teach our children\nis that not everybody's going to like\nyou and that's okay\nyou know i my mom was like you're not\nyou're not going to be everyone's cup of\ntea and that doesn't mean there's\nsomething wrong with you it just means\nthat\nyou know they're a different person\nthey're going in a different direction\nand so\nwhen people told me no i just it\nit it lit this fire inside of me that\nwanted to\nkeep going but i didn't take it\npersonally because i've always thought\nthat\nacting was art and it's subjective\nand i can look at a picasso and not get\nit\nyeah you know i mean and and so people\ncan\nhave an opinion about me and not get it\nand that's okay it has no bearing on\nmy self-worth and and who i am and\nwhat i have to give to the the industry\nof\nof acting or life in general you know\nand i think that um that is\nis one of the things that my mom and dad\ninstilled in me from a very young age\nwas\nwas that that you know who you are\nis not what you do and who you are\nis so much more important than anything\nelse you're ever going to do\nyou know my dad said at the end of your\nlife you don't want to drop the mic and\ngo oh that was fun i lived a great life\nfor myself\nyou know he's like at the end of your\nlife you you you question\nwhether you loved greatly whether people\nknew that you loved greatly\nand that's your contribution and and so\nit was it never to live for yourself but\nto live for others\nwas a big thing and when you live for\nothers you don't take it personally\nif one person says that you know\nyou're not good enough yeah i love that\nyour parents sound like incredible\npeople\nthey're incredible people that have\nscrewed up a lot i think that you learn\nfrom mistakes and my parents never hid\nthose mistakes they they\nmade mistakes and went wow that was a\ngreat mistake let's sit down and talk\nabout it\nand so that's sort of how i attack it\nwith other people whereas like i make a\nton of mistakes i made five today\num but that's the only way you learn you\nknow you can learn by watching other\npeople's mistakes but you can also learn\nfrom your own\nand i've made some pretty big doozies um\nwhat mistakes did you make today\ntoday today let's see you said you made\nfive today you have to come you don't\nhave to tell me all five you don't have\nto tell me all the time\ni drank way too much coffee today it's a\nlittle mistake today but no\ni am i do i make little mistakes every\nday but\nit's how we learn it's how we grow and i\nloved what you said about failure that\nyou\nnever accepted failure was possible and\nwhat i'm gaining from that i'd love for\neveryone who's listening and watching\nright now to recognize this is\nfailure is when you stop trying of\ncourse right and so like you kept going\nthat's why you didn't accept failure\nwhereas what we do is we take that event\nas\nfailure yeah when actually failure is\nwhen you stop trying so the fact that\nyou kept pushing\nyeah meant you were saying hey i'm not\ngoing to fail of course and whereas when\nyou take that no\nas a failure and lots of us do we take\nthat no as equivalent to failure yeah\nand that feels a lot harder to take so i\nlove that point well we don't really\nknow\nwhat our destiny is and what our journey\nis until the end of our life\nyou know that is the the perspective\nthat hindsight gives you\nbut you don't know what it is until the\nend so you don't you can't\npossibly know if you failed until you're\nat the end\nyeah so so why should we say oh gosh\nthis didn't go the way that i wanted\nso i failed yes you know it didn't go\nthe way you wanted\nso something else is going to happen\nabsolutely it doesn't mean you failed it\njust means this one thing\ndidn't go the way you wanted yeah but in\na it'll become very evident as you go\nalong\nwhy it didn't work the way you wanted it\ntotally yeah absolutely i'm so aligned\nwith you i actually don't know\nanything in my life that's happened the\nway i wanted yeah right\ni couldn't i couldn't think of one thing\nyeah that's happened in my life the way\ni wanted it to\nand so i've often said to people i'm\nlike you get to where you want in life\njust not in the way you imagined it\nyeah and the journey is just so\ndifferent from what you imagine so\njust become detached from how you want\nthat journey to look\nbecause it's going to surprise you or\ndelight you it will confuse you\nand i feel that you have to be open to\nthat path yes\nand that's what gets us well and that's\nwhat adults try and tell us when we're\nchildren right they try to tell you\nthis is such a small part of your life\nlike it it doesn't matter and when\nyou're young you don't believe that you\nknow it's only as you get older you\nstart to realize that\nnothing happens the way you want it to\nhappen and\nthat is the beauty of life like we are\nin control of our own destiny and we\nwe can we are a series of our choices\nbut but the choices you make you are\nalso on a ride\nand you don't know where you're going to\nbe tomorrow um and\nit's sort of like a choose your own\nadventure story you have the choice\nto go right but the story is going to\nkeep going and then you're going to have\nto choose again\nand and so you have no idea what's going\nto happen so failure isn't an option\nbecause i don't believe failure exists\nyeah i love that so powerful incredibly\npowerful amazing you've already\nin the in the few minutes we've been\nspeaking you've already dropped so many\ngreat messages\nlessons for our audience it's amazing i\nwanted to talk about this because i\nbelieve\nit must have been one of the most\nchallenging things to go through and at\n27 you went through\nthyroid cancer yeah right which is i\ncan't fathom\nhow tough that is and how much it\naffects so much of you\nwalk us through that experience of\nfinding out\nand how that started to affect because\nyou already had battle star galactica\ngalactica you'd already had that\nbreakthrough etc tell me about how that\naffected\neverything from your mind your body your\ncareer and\nhow you started to push through when i\ngot thyroid cancer it was\ni knew something was wrong with me um\nand i just couldn't put my finger on it\nand i kept going to the doctor and i\nkept\nyou know saying no there's something\nwrong there's something wrong um\nthey attributed everything to my lack of\nsleep and that i worked too hard and all\nof these things and\nand then they eventually found out that\nit was thyroid cancer and\ni call it my baby cancer because there\ni knew from the very beginning that\nthere is a very small\nvery small minute chance that it could\nbe life-threatening\ni did know that but what i didn't\nrealize\ni guess at that time was how\nlife-changing it would be\nit was the first time in my life where i\nfelt completely out of control\num i was scared i was depressed\ni was i was terrified actually\num because it felt i was all of a sudden\nreminded of how fragile life was\nand so i went through this time and i\nhad\nthis deal with with my my boyfriend at\nthe time my ex who's still a very good\nfriend of mine\nthat i gave myself 10 minutes a day to\nfeel very very sorry for myself\nand to cry and to scream and to yell and\ndo whatever i wanted to do\nand then i wouldn't do it again for the\nrest of the day and\nthat became a very very important thing\nbecause\ni think that we can feel sorry for\nourselves sometimes and we lose\nperspective\nin that sorrow of how lucky we still are\nwith the thing that is considered our\n[ __ ] excuse me\nbut um what i did was i realized like\nhow lucky i was in that moment and so we\ncame up with this thing called the three\nthings\nand my three things is that in any\nsituation in your life\nwhere you find yourself angry or\nfrustrated or sad or anything come up\nwith\nthree ways little ways they don't need\nto be massive three things that could\nmake this situation much worse\nand it can be very if you're in traffic\nand you're gonna be late for a meeting\nand this thing's it feels like the worst\nthing that could be happening at this\nmoment in your life\ncome up with three things that can make\nit worse you could have a flat tire\nright now\num it could be raining and you could\nhave a migraine headache\nthree things three little things that\ncould make this one moment\nso much worse and all of a sudden you're\nyou feel lucky and blessed that it's\nonly that you're sitting in traffic\nand you can do that with so many big\nthings in your life so many little\nthings but i find that\nif you sit back and it gives you\nperspective and i learned that because\ni call it my baby cancer because\ni reminded myself constantly that it\ncould be so much worse\nand so it allowed me to feel grateful\nthat it was only just that\num but it changed my life i'm on\nmedication for the rest of my life\ni um i still have three tumors in my\nbody\num that they have chosen just to watch\nand one's in my\nhead and two are in my throat still um\nand those are life-changing every six\nmonths i have to go to the doctor and\nhave what's called um a contrast mri\nand so the tumor in the pituitary gland\nwhich is\na little gland that sits like in between\nyour eyes like above your nose like\nright in front of your brain\nit it produces a hormone called\nprolactin and prolactin is the hormone\nyou produce when you're pregnant\nand so because i have a tumor there it\nhas made it\nvery very difficult to have children and\nthen the thyroids taken out so that's\nanother reason\nand so all of these things that i didn't\nthink about when i was 27 that you think\nare just givens\num were were changed\nso much by just that diagnosis of\nthyroid cancer but it made me\nso\nhappy that i'm still alive\nand at 27 which seems late so many\npeople are faced with this\nso much younger and in so much more of\nof\na life-changing way but i realize at 27\nthat every single day we get\nis a gift and i\ni became in that moment not afraid to\nage aging is a gift\ni at that moment not afraid of what\npeople thought about my body\nnot afraid of all these things that had\nthat had plagued me in my career for so\nlong at that moment i was like\ni am going to live the rest of my life\nwith complete utter\ntrue honesty to myself everyone around\nme because i'm so lucky i'm here\nand so it gave me that that was such a\nbeautiful gift talking about not knowing\nwhat's gonna\nhappen in life like i wouldn't have\nchosen that but it became the thing that\nthat formed who i am now wow\nthat's amazing i love that because it\nsounds like when i'm listening to you\nyou've taken this and you said in your\nown words a gift\nand you've let it be such a driving\nforce in your mindset towards life\nyeah rather than seeing it as a as an\nissue or something negative yeah you've\nreally transformed it\nit's it's yes i think so i it just i\ni see it's so easy to get caught up in\nour own lives i still do it\nbut if we stop long enough and find that\nperspective of how blessed we are to\njust\nhave a roof over our head so many people\ndon't you know i\ni think that that is the thing that i\nfocus on the most in my life and in my\npractices and in my meditation is just\nhow blessed i am\nto just be here um\nand so but but that was thyroid cancer\nthyroid cancer was a doozy\nlife changing absolutely yeah of course\nand do you find that\nthat 10 minutes you'd set aside to kind\nof vent cry it's a drought\ntell me about that process like did that\nwork was that a useful\nhabit and practice during that time it\nwas really useful and i actually found\nthat\nit usually didn't go 10 minutes you know\nand if\nif i i would it usually was crying and\nit was usually screaming into a pillow\nand i i would yell a lot i'd call my mom\nand i would\ni'd get very down on myself and but it\nusually wouldn't last more than 10\nminutes\nusually i usually got sick of hearing\nmyself complain\nand and then if if outside of that 10\nminutes i came up with something that\nbothered me i would remember it for\ntomorrow\nand then i'd would forget it that's\namazing because it it's it\nevery argument and every complaint and\neverything that seemed so\nbig in that moment the next day\nwasn't it was trivial yeah um and\nand so the 10 minute thing i still if\nanything big comes up and\ni i i think everyone should try it if\nyou're having a bad day give yourself\n10 minutes today to just go for it\nwhatever you want to do if you want to\ngo hit a punching bag hit a punching bag\nif you want to cry\ncry scream scream do whatever you want\nbut get it out of your system in 10\nminutes go to your car your car's the\nbest place to do it because no one can\nhear you\njust don't drive like that yeah don't do\nit while you're driving\nexactly um it's such a great place\nbecause you can scream so loud\nand sometimes what i found was when i\nwas screaming so loud i actually would\nstart laughing\nbecause the sheer absurdity of it just\nscreaming at the top of your lungs we\ndon't do that enough\nas as adults we don't scream you know as\nchildren we scream so much\nwhen we're upset and as adults we learn\nto keep it all in\nso it's it's sometimes i found that 10\nminutes is really great\nyeah i agree and i think we forget that\nthat when you just that's such a\nbeautiful way of looking at it that when\nwe were children we would just\nlet it all out get it all out but when\nwe become adults we hold it in\nand when you're holding it in all it's\ndoing is brewing yeah right it's not\ngoing it needs to go somewhere yes so\nit's either causing a block physically\nor mentally\nfor the future and so i love that could\nyou imagine adults on the ground having\na temper tantrum i know like kicking\nand screaming it would probably actually\nbe really great it would just i mean\nmaybe in the privacy of your own home\nlike don't drop down on the street\nin manhattan and start screaming or in\nyour car as you said\ni like that because it's soundproof but\ni often say that to people when you\nrepeat your\ncomplaints out to yourself yes you start\nto laugh at them\nyeah or you start to recognize them with\nperspective even if you don't laugh at\nyou yes\nso often i have coaching clients or\npeople that i work with\neither write out their pain and their\ntrouble and then read it out to\nthemselves\nand so often on the second or third\nreading they're like i can't believe i'm\ncomplaining about this yeah\nor i have people record it on a voice\nnote and play it to themselves\nyeah and then you hear it as if someone\nelse is saying it yeah and and you know\nwhenever\nwe hear other people's challenges they\nsound bad but ours always sounds so much\nworse they do but when you hear\nyour own from the perspective of someone\nelse sharing them with you\nagain they get put into perspective and\nyou're like oh actually it's you know i\nknow what we can do about this you know\nand you start\napproaching it as an observer yeah as\nopposed to feeling like you're the\nvictim well it's a great thing to do for\nbody image too\ni learned this um body image for me has\nalways been very hard\nyou know i was told from from the moment\ni came to\ncalifornia to be an actress that i was\ntoo big i was called chubby\ni was called the big girl i was called\neverything crazy\ni was just they called me the big girl\nfrom the show with richard dreyfuss like\ni was called\nall of these things that were used to\nexplain who i was\nthat were just physical and and also\nso mean like number one you're you're\ninsinuating that\nif i was the big girl that something\nwould be wrong with me but then you're\nalso\nusing that to describe who i am as a\nperson which was so heartbreaking\nand so i had a therapist one time say to\nme that the next time you're going to\nsay\ngod i'm ugly or god i'm fat or whatever\nit is\nto actually do it in the mirror and so i\nstarted doing this many years ago where\nif i had a day where i was like god you\nknow\nmy ass looks terrible i would say it in\nthe mirror and you laugh because you\nrealize you would never say that to your\nworst enemies face why are you saying it\nto yourself\nyeah you know you are like you are the\none person you have to spend the rest of\nyour life with why are you being so\ncruel\nand and so that to me was so important\nso even now\nwhen i'm like have you know anything\nthat i want to say negative about myself\ni walk to a mirror and i say it to my\nface\nand you just go god i would never say\nthis to someone don't say it to yourself\nwow yeah and what have you started\nsaying to yourself in\naddition or substitution or is that what\nit is when you hear something negative\nyou go to the mirror you say to yourself\nand then you laugh at it because yeah\njust\nyou would like you said you would never\nsay it to you no you don't could you\nimagine\nyeah oh my god you would never say that\nto anyone\nyou know the thing that i started doing\nwas if i found something where i wanted\nto say\nmy three things rule i guess i just put\nthis with everything in my life\neverything's in threes\nbut but it's is point out something you\nlove about yourself point out three\nthings that you love about yourself like\nit could be as simple as like you know\noh i love my cheekbone or i love you\nknow i have\ngreat hands or whatever they are just\ngive yourself a compliment you know like\nwe can we can always find something in\nourselves that we\nappreciate absolutely i always say to\npeople i'm like you're not you would\nnever say that to your younger brother\nor younger sister no\nlike you would never go up to them you\nwould never go up to anyone in your\nfamily or anyone you know and say that\nand if they said that about themselves\nyou'd say\nno that's not true like worse you need\nto work on this or maybe we should try\nthis but you wouldn't say yeah sure\nthat's exactly what you are\nno because again like what you said\nearlier that doesn't define\nwho that person is no and and it's\nsomething that's always in flux and you\nsaid\nalso thyroid cancer changed your\nrelationship with food it did right in a\nbig way\nit did very much so so i you know\ni used to binge eat as as a young adult\nconstantly it was one of those things\nthat they think the industry brought it\nout in me i also think i probably had a\nbit of this when i was a child\nbut i would go and i'd sneak food i\nwouldn't work i wouldn't eat all day\nlong\nand then i would go and i would just eat\na ton of food\nand then i would go to the gym for hours\nthe next day to counteract what i had\njust eaten\nand it was just this vicious cycle um\nwhere i had to when i had the thyroid\ncancer i had to sit down\nand figure out what healthy meant to me\nwhich which was very different than for\nsomebody else but what it meant to me\nand and my relationship with food and i\nhad to slow down\nand actually start to question what\nwhat i was hiding and that's when i\nstarted going to therapy a lot\nwas was when i was actually hiding this\nsort of\num in relation to the thyroid i had this\nsurvivor's guilt almost\nthat my cancer i felt so guilty\nthat mine was such a small\ncancer because i would still have to go\nto\nthe the doctor's office and see patients\nthat\nthat had these\nterrible forms of cancer that they were\nreally really fighting through and i\nalways walked in there and felt so\nguilty\num and i i had to work through\nthat and and that was not easy it took\nmany years to sort of\num let go of that there was shame in it\ntoo i felt so\nbad and and didn't know how to\narticulate that tell us about that\nprocess of giving up guilt and shame\nbecause i think in so many different\nways we all experience that\nit may not be in the same way as you do\nbut i think guilt and shame are those\ntypes of feelings that actually never\nget let out it's the ones we hold on to\nthe most well because we think you're\nugly\ntotally exactly they're just the hardest\nto explain to someone\nyeah and express to someone and expect\nempathy back\ntell us a bit about how you kind of\nbroke those down and and dissolved them\nin your life\nfor me it was forgiving myself and\nhaving compassion for myself\nyou know i didn't have any control over\nwhat other people were going through\ni only had control over myself and and\nhow\nit it affected me on the inside and i\nhad to\nforgive myself for for\num taking life for granted ahead of time\ni felt like i\nyou know was was taking my life for\ngranted in that moment\nand and i forgave myself for all of that\nbut that was just it was just having\ncompassion for myself and realizing you\nmay not have an answer for this you may\nnot\nbe able to deal with that guilt you may\nnot that that may not be something you\ncan figure out but that's okay\nand and it has no bearing on who you are\nas how\nif you're a good person or not like that\nwas it i kept thinking god\ni can't be a good person if i feel shame\nand i feel guilt and and\nthere's nothing i can do about it and um\nthat was the\nthe biggest thing is that we practice so\nmany of these beautiful\nloving techniques towards strangers and\nother people and our\nyou know like you said our younger\nsiblings and things like that but\nwe are we never do that for ourselves\nand i think that if we if we\ndid that and so for me it really had to\nbe about\nlearning how to love myself\nand and learning that i had no control\nover anything around me\nonly that yes um and not my health\nfor for a lot of you know i didn't have\ncontrol over\nthat part of my health at that point um\ni just had to\nto love myself and and then i tried to\nevery time i would go to get treatment\ni would look around me and i would try\nand\nsend as much positive energy as i could\nto people\num and that's what led me then to\nmeditation\nand a form of um i i believe it's called\ntonglen\nwhen you actually you you\nyou breathe in a negative and you\nbreathe out a positive\nand and so i tried to do that a lot\nwhile i was in there and then\ni the only thing i could do for those\npeople is live my life\nso to the best of my ability and that's\nthat's what the therapist\ntaught me yeah that's awesome i love\nthat that's\nit's so powerful especially that point\nyou were making about\nthis distinction of what we're\nexperiencing whether it's\nguilt or shame or ego or pride or\nanger or envy i always tell people it's\nlike wearing a bad outfit\nyeah like we're just putting on all\nthese layers but we're not that layer\nlike just like we're not our clothes\nwe're not our envy we're not our guilt\nwe're not our shame\nand as soon as you realize it's not you\nand you can actually take it off yeah\nand and put it away right right you\nstart recognizing that actually it's\njust about taking off these layers\nand and i'm not that guilt otherwise we\njust feel like oh i'm so guilty or i'm\nembarrassed or we keep saying i am to\nstuff that we're not yeah\nand then we get lost in that belief\nsystem yes that i am this emotion\nyeah no i i that was one of the main\nthings is that i had to just let it go\num and i had to write down a lot of the\nthings that i felt guilty about and i\nfelt shame about\num and in order to sort of let it go and\nrealize that it didn't define\nme and then i became more honest about\nit as well and i started talking more\nabout um if i make a mistake and i\nrealize it\ni will immediately try and say oh my god\nwhat did i just do\nand i find that that you know people are\nmuch more receptive to\nthe mistakes that you make if you\nidentify that oh crap i just did that\nabsolutely yeah and i love how that\nbrings us to one of these things that i\nabsolutely love about you is how you're\nso vulnerable and open on social media\nand you're just able to share who you\ntruly are through your page\nyou're able to share all the medical\nchallenges that you have physical\nchallenges that you have\njust reality too not even a challenge\njust as it is and\ni love the fact that you're using your\nplatform to speak about these messages\ntell me about what you were sharing\nearlier when we were just speaking yeah\nand you talked about the word\nresponsibility\nyeah i'd love for you to expand on your\nbelief around\nwhy you think you have a responsibility\naround this\nyeah when i was on the show here\nin new york mike i was on a show with\nrichard dreyfuss and\ni was 20 years old and i had pink hair\nand people recognized me everywhere i\nwent just because of this pink hair\nand it was right after 9 11 and this\nwoman\ni was eating with my family and this\nwoman\ngot very angry at me because i didn't\nhave a pen to give her an autograph\nand it was a very weird surreal moment\nfor me but what she said to me as she\nwas leaving was she said that\nyou have a responsibility you gave up\nyour right to privacy because you chose\nthis\nand that to me at the time\nfelt like how dare you say that to me of\ncourse i have a right to privacy\neverybody does\nbut there was a it stuck with me for so\nmany years because\nshe was right you know i chose this i\nchose this life there have been moments\nin my career where i\nsensed a shift where i could tell that\nthat i was becoming more recognizable\nand i kept going so i could have stopped\nbut i didn't you know and so therefore\nbecause of the platform i have i\ndo have a responsibility for the the\nthings that i put out there into the\nworld\nbecause it's it has the ability to reach\nso many people\num and that to me\ni take very seriously i life to me is\nall about connection\nand and what a great opportunity i have\nto connect with\nall of these people that may have\nfollowed me because they watched a show\nthat i did\nbut we can connect on something that is\nso much more important\nand and i want them to know\nwho i am and to see me at my worst i\ndon't want them to\nhave to sift through my highlight reel\nof my life\nyou know i want them to see the\nthe days where i don't have makeup on or\nthe days that i have a headache or the\ndays where i\nfeel insecure about myself or the days\nwhere i'm\ndepressed or i'm sad or i'm healing from\na broken heart or i'm doing\ni want them to see those things because\nit gives them a voice by me using\nmy voice because so many people feel\nlike\nthey they don't matter or they don't\nbelong to a community and\nand and so i i really\ni have a career because of these people\nand\nso if they want to be a part of my life\nand if they want to to\nlearn from my mistakes by god i'm going\nto give them that\nyou know um because i\ni don't know it's just there's something\nvery\nspiritual to me that when i\nconnect with someone on something that's\nso much deeper and so much more\nimportant\nthan everything else you know i mean\nthese people come to me\nthey send me direct messages about so\nmany things that we're all\nstruggling with and for some reason\nthey have felt comfortable to express\nthis with me\nand that is an honor that somebody would\nlet me see a piece of them\nthat that they're scared to show other\npeople\num and so i want them to see that part\nof me\num tell me about some of the examples\nthat you've seen of\nmessages you think are most important\nfor you to share right now\nyeah you mentioned a few there but tell\nus about some of the bigger themes and\nalso just\nabout some of the things people open up\nto you about and what your responses are\nand how you've been kind of nurturing\nthat community too\nthe thing that most most people come to\nme about\nis so many women are struggling with\nbody image\nso many women are struggling with that\nthey're struggling with self-love\num they are struggling with mental\nhealth\num and\ni'm not an expert on these things you\nknow all i have\nis the experiences that i have gone\nthrough in my life\nand then i also have the ability to\npotentially go\nseek more answers for them because i\nhave the ability to find these people\nand they're at my fingertips but\nbut that body image thing was that's one\nthat you know because i've played these\ncharacters that are\nsynonymous with strength and self-love\nand sort of like you know people think\nthat that\nis me um it is it is yeah\nbut i learned how to be me by playing\nthese women\nwow you know i was not the girl that\nsaid whatever she wanted when i was 21\nyears old\ni learned how to do that by these women\nand these words that were given to me by\npeople that are\nthat were so much more evolved than me\nat the time and and still are\nbut i i that's who\nthey were for me and so that's these\ncharacters i don't know so people come\nto me with that that is one that just\ndestroys me it is one of the hardest\nthings to see\num girls and boys and women struggling\nwith\nwith this body\nimage that is so pushed upon us by\nan industry that is selling perfection\num\nand perfection doesn't it doesn't exist\nyou know it doesn't exist or it doesn't\nexist the way we think of it\nno no and there's no one\nlike you in the world totally like that\nalready\nis so special you know i said this to\nsomeone that reached out to me the other\nday\nthere is nobody like you in the world\nyou are\nthe only person out there that is you\nand she said well what if you're a twin\nand i was like still\nyour dna is changing every single second\nyes like even if you're an identical\ntwin\nyour dna is your cells are different\nbecause they're constantly shifting so\nthere's nobody like you\nlike that is the most special gift that\nyou could possibly be given\nthat you're a one of a kind so there's\nno body that's perfect there's no body\nthat's better than yours there is just\nthe one that you have\nand that that is that's important that's\nand i say that because i still struggle\nwith that these are things that i say to\nmyself\nevery day um so when i say them to\nmyself\ni then go say them to them um because it\nit seems i'm inspired to do so at that\nmoment you know yes\nabsolutely and i think we all are in\ncharge of what we believe\nwe're aspiring for yeah like we have a\nresponsibility to ourselves\nfor what we're holding up as perfection\nright\nlike what is that picture we are\ndeciding that yeah and whether you've\nconsciously built that or it's been\nunconsciously built by your\nbackground experience parenting\neducation whatever you've been exposed\nto\nit's so important that we reconstruct\nthat for ourselves\nbecause i find like that picture if\nthat's not removed\nand if that's not deconstructed and\nreconstructed and redefined\nbased on what you really value and\nbelieve in right then you're still not\ngoing to have another version because we\nall need something to aspire for\nwe all do yeah and that usually should\njust be\na more aligned version of ourselves\nright\nyeah we make it this external\npicture face body job role\ncriteria right and and if you don't\ndeconstruct it i think that requires\nsome time is that\nyou have to spend some time to\ndeconstruct the picture of perfection\nyou currently have\nand reconstruct a new one because you're\nright what you said that was not defined\nby you\nmore often than not it's not refined by\nus no you know we are we are raised a\ncertain way with a certain set of values\nand a certain set of ideals\nby everyone around us that isn't us you\nknow and by the moment that you know you\nget to a certain point in your life\nwhere you realize that you are now\nresponsible for your own\nwell-being and who you want to be\nwas not defined by you absolutely and\nthat is\nis a really interesting thing to sort of\nfocus on that you then have to go back\nand almost like\nyou know print out like a a collage what\nyou want your life to be like based on\nyou know who you are at that moment\nexactly i grew up i grew up overweight\nwhen i was younger and to my indian\nfamily\nthat was considered healthy right and\nthen when i\nlost weight and then i'd go back to my\nindian family they'd say oh my god you\nyou look like completely malnourished\nand you haven't eaten and because\nthat's the value of body image in that\ncommunity yeah certain time and this is\nwhat i mean by just everyone's going to\nhave their own definition\nof what beauty is what perfection is and\nif you've let all those definitions\nbecome yours\nthen now you're living for subjective\ndefinitions of other people yes\nso no i think that's such a valuable\npoint that you've raised and i'm so glad\nthat you're not only using your platform\nbut we were speaking a bit about earlier\nand please share whatever you can just\nhow you really believe it's your\nresponsibility to shift the way things\nare done even in the industry which\nwhich gets me really excited because i\njust feel like\npowerful influence like you know you're\none of the most five iconic people\nin the whole sci-fi space which is so\nexciting and cool and i'm just like\nwhen you see icons shifting the way they\ndo things that have been done the same\nway for decades\nthat's when i believe things start to\nshift right it's like when a ceo says\ni'm now sleeping eight hours a day right\nlike that makes sense and how simple\nthat is\nit's such a simple thing like we're like\noh what like oh right\noh yeah i mean okay yeah but we're\nhoping that people do things and say\nthings like that because then their\nteams do\nyeah and then when we see actresses and\nicons like yourself will come out and be\nlike\nwell actually i want to use this\nplatform for a voice\nnot just for the art right and and tell\nme about\nhow you've been using that in some of\nyour activism work that you've been\ndoing\nwell i realized that i couldn't change\nthe industry\nthe thing that i had control over was\nthat i could\nadd to it and and so you know like for\nanother life we're you know having a\npremiere party\nof course everyone knows what a premiere\nparty is um but\nwhy not add a philanthropic arm to it\nwhy not\ngive back at the same time because we\nknow they're going to want to do this\nso why not just add something to it that\nmakes\na difference and so that's sort of what\ni've been trying to do\nis that just not change add to\nand shift um and and so that's sort of\ni think that we do have a responsibility\nto sort of like just\njust change ourselves and then others\nwill change with us\nyeah i think and i think that's such a\nbrilliant for everyone who's listening\nand watching there are so many gems in\nthis conversation right now coming from\nkaty they're\nthey're incredible and this one's really\npowerful that\ni think we waste a lot of energy trying\nto change stuff\nright and don't realize that we can just\nadd another layer so often people would\nsay to me like jay don't you want to\nchange the education system\nand i was just like no i'm just going to\ncreate an alternative education system\nbecause that is such a hefty goal\nchanging something seems so impossible\ntotally and\nyou can literally lose all your energy\nget completely drained\ntrying to change this big piece\nthat actually you don't have any remit\nover or maybe you're not even qualified\nto like i don't feel qualified to change\nthe education system\nas a whole like i don't i i don't think\nso but but i do know that there are\nparts of it\nthat i can add and enhance yes and and i\nthink that's the beauty it also\nliberates you of this\ncrazy pressure we put on ourselves like\ni'm going to change hollywood or i'm\ngoing to change the education world or\ni'm going to change the industry or\ni'm going to change technology it's like\nthat's such a heavy burden yeah\nand you feel liberated when you're like\nactually this is the part that i really\nbelieve i want to\nimpact and i'm going to start here well\ni think that so many people think\nso so grand in in which is\na beautiful thing um but they think in\nin such massive ideas and you're right\nif you i can't change the entertainment\nindustry\nbut i can add to it you know there is a\npiece that i can\nthere's a crumb that i can leave behind\nand that is changing that is changing it\num and that is that is you know i think\nif we think smaller sometimes that it it\nbecomes much more manageable and\nless pressure yeah absolutely i love\nwhat you said earlier about how the\nroles you've played\nhave actually inspired your strength and\nand and i loved that earlier and i i\ndidn't pick i i picked up on it then i\ndidn't say i'm saying it now it's just\nhow you were saying that\nyou were so committed to getting this\nrole because you were so excited to play\nthis role right\nand and i wanted to find out so now in\nnetflix's new show\nanother life yeah which is very exciting\nwhat is that role inspiring in you\nas a person in your own life oh my gosh\nthis woman is you know with tell us\nabout the character yeah\nno the the character is is so now i've\nyou know um i'm older now so now i'm\nsort of i started in this industry as\nthe youngest person on a movie set now\ni'm the oldest which is amazing\ni think it's such a beautiful thing um\nbut it's it's\nthis woman is the commander of a ship um\nand she's\nbeen given a very young crew um to go\nout\nand save the world basically and she's\ngiven a young crew because they're\ndisposable\num and um it is\na very very fun role for me but it's\nheavy\nit's very heavy you know she is the the\nleader\nof the crew and and i i took that\nresponsibility very seriously because i\non longmire\num robert taylor was a phenomenal\nnumber one at the lead of the show he\nwas a phenomenal leader because he\nshowed up every single day\nhe did his job he was happy the crew\nloved him\nand that was such a great\nrole model for me um and so i took\nput a lot of pressure on myself probably\ntoo much pressure actually thinking back\non it now but\ni put a lot of pressure on myself to be\na role model for some of these younger\nactors who a lot of them this is their\nfirst big role\nand and i wanted them to sort of learn\nhow to be in the industry and how to be\non set\nand and um you know what things not to\ndo what things to do\nand and so i am you know it's one of my\nbiggest pet peeves in this industry\nthat they let actors cut in front of the\ncrew in the lunch line\nit to me is completely\nrude and and i don't think that it is it\nis responsible as an actor who\nwho is you know probably not as tired as\nthe crew member who's been working just\nas hard if not harder than you\nand doesn't get to go back to a cushy\nlittle trailer and have their lunch you\nknow so why don't you let him go first\nso he can eat his lunch and then like go\nyou know have some time little things\nlike that that i wanted\nit was it's a gift to be able to sort of\nlike impart that to\nyounger people because things that\nmatter to me\nand and um um because a lot of people\ndo what they're told they can do um\nand so it's a fun role so so the way\nthat i'm acting on set as katie\nis very similar to my character nico um\nwhich is the commander and she's sort of\nteaching them how to be\nastronauts that's awesome yeah and how\nhave they taken to it\n[Laughter]\nsome of them better than others um no i\nmean it's it's\nreally well i mean this is a it's a fun\nshow it's a really great cast and\nand we were really lucky to there's some\nsome beautiful\ndiamonds on this show that are we're\nlucky to have yeah\nthat's awesome no i love that and i and\ni think those are the\nexperiences that you value maybe not\neven in that moment but many years along\ni know whenever i've been mentored or\ncoached by someone even when i first met\nthem and i didn't really\nwant them to do that for me yeah and\nthen in 10 15 20 years i look back and\ni'm like\ni'm really glad they taught me that yeah\nyou know and it's i think that's the\nbeauty of anyone who's a teacher or a\ncoach a mentor or in any sense like\nin any field you're showing that in any\nfield our example\nright is contagious and will spread yeah\nright\nyou're not their coach or their guide\nbut it's spreading and i just really\nfeel that\nwhen you're playing that role in any\nsort sort of way\nour responsibility is to facilitate\ngrowth and give opportunity but not\nexpect it\nyeah because that person may take five\nten fifteen twenty years to actually\nrealize\nhow powerful a lesson that was so you\nwere gonna no i was just gonna say it's\nyou know we\nit was a role that i'd never had of\nbeing this sort of like mentor\nand in a way and i didn't do it right in\nevery way\nand you know i had you know\nmy boyfriend looked at me at one point\nand he said you know you need to\nunderstand\nthat sometimes when you're listening to\nsomeone and you then\nimpart wisdom on them based on an\nexperience that you had very similar\nwhat you're saying to them\nis that i did it i was fine you're fine\nand you're not\nvalidating how they feel in this moment\nand he said you need\nyou need to stop doing them and it was\nreally nice it was great advice but it\nwas really hard i got sort of frustrated\ni walked away for five minutes i was\nlike is this gonna be a fight\nand i walked away for like five minutes\nand then came back and i was like you\nare so right\nthank you so much for telling me that\nbecause i\ni did that part of this very wrong and\ngod you know god forbid that you know\ni've made someone feel like what they're\nexperiencing and feeling\nisn't valid um or that it's not\nimportant because i did it\num that's that was a that was a good\nlesson\nthat was a very good lesson for me to\nlearn um not to hear\nbut to learn yeah awesome lessons are\nnever fun to hear\nexactly i love that that's awesome well\nkatie this has been\nsuch a fun conversation for me i feel\nlike everyone who's listening and\nwatching\ngenuinely if you've been listening\nattentively like i have i've learned so\nmuch from you today i feel like i talk\ntoo much\nno not at all not at all keep talking if\nyou remember when you said that i hadn't\nmade mistakes i didn't have too much\ncoffee no no\ni think this is what happened no you\ndidn't talk too much this is amazing\nlike the amount of principles and amount\nof\npractices that you've given us i think\nare going to be so valuable for everyone\nlistening so\nwas there anything that i didn't ask you\nthat you wish i did because you know\nwhat this opportunity is for if there's\nanything that you like jay i really want\nto address this or talk about this\nplease this is\nfree you know no quick fight around\nanymore i want to give you that\nopportunity is there anything that we\ndidn't touch on that you really want to\nshare\nwe didn't you know i'm i the one thing\nwe didn't touch on um\nis that i'm starting a youtube channel\nyes let's talk about yeah yeah let's\ntalk about it um\nfor me instagram i do find that there's\nso much\nthere and and so much of sifting through\nto find\num the content that that touches on a\ndeeper level and i wanted to\nto reach more of my the fans that are\nreaching out to me but on\nlike a a longer platform um instagram\nseemed a little um\nit didn't seem intimate enough for me\nright um and it didn't seem\nlike the right place to talk about some\nof the things that i want to talk about\nwith people\nand and show what motivates me what\ninspires me\nwhat scares me and and do it in a fun\nway and so\nthat that is new for me i'm really\nexcited for people to see\nmore of of that aspect of my life and\nsort of um go along that journey with me\nand what kind of format can we expect is\nit\nlike following you around is it insights\nis it is it any sci-fi twist\nwhere's that there might be there might\nbe we're going to break it down into\nseasons actually\nso we can actually do different seasons\nwith different themes and talk about\neven more\ndifferent things but for the most part\nit's sort of like\ni wanted it to be the\nhollywood anti-hollywood i wanted it to\nbe wellness and lifestyle\nand what motivates me and you know that\nwhat i said what scares me and things\nthat move me\num and wrapped up in a fun little box\nyou know it's it's um stress relieving\ntechniques which you know but under the\nguise of baby goat yoga yeah you know\nbut like things like that that are fun\nto watch\nbecause i think that sometimes when\nsomething is fun to watch and it's\npalatable\nit's much easier to change somebody's\nperception of something absolutely\nthe the name of the company is actually\nblood sweat and coffee that's the name\nof the channel it's sort of amazing\nfor everybody we end every interview\nwith a final five which is\na rapid fire quick fire round okay so\nthis is where you can't talk too much\nyou're not allowed\ni i may i may i may digress at points\nor golf on a time i'll be as fast as i\ncan but i promise i won't talk too much\nthe number one question is uh what's\nyour dream role\nor what would have been your dream
