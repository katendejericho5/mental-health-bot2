and\nsomehow then the planet's never aligned\nuntil now\ni know i remember messaging with you on\ninstagram i think i was actually in\nlondon at the time a few years back\nand there was a video that we were going\nto do together it was one of these\ndating videos that you were doing and\nyou're like oh do you want and i was in\nlondon but i don't know how we kept\nmissing yeah we even had a brief phone\ncall where we like connected and got on\nreally well and\nyeah we're both mutual friends of lewis\nhowes and it just yeah it's\nit's fun though to finally be in the\nsame room and do this it's fun yeah and\ni feel like it's a momentous occasion\nbecause england's playing in the final\non\nsunday like we've been brought together\nas two\nuh and i have you decided where you're\nwatching the final uh\nyou don't know i have to be in true\nintroverted fashion\ni have to be at home like i like being\nwith my family\nbecause i do like the energy of people\nwho really care yeah\nwhat drives me mad is when you've got\npeople who\nhave no idea what they're talking about\nyelling at a screen\nduring a match yeah and i genuinely love\nhearing all of the commentary\nyeah so like i'm one of those people i'm\ni'm a fight fan like boxing and some\nwhen there's a big boxing match i'm like\nall right everyone can come over but\njust\ni want to hear the commentary so like i\ndon't i hate that\nbar environment of everyone yelling at\nthe screen yeah so yeah yeah i get that\nyeah no i've i've actually\ni lead a spiritual book club on sunday\nand half of it is\nbang in the first half of the game so\ni'm only gonna get to watch the second\nhalf it's hard for me\nto imagine anything more different than\nthe energy of english fans back home\nthan a spiritual\nbook club literally this is like a\nreally it's like an intimate it's a\ngroup of friends that i had a spiritual\nbook club for\nhappens every sunday and it's 11 to 1.\nso 11 to 12 i'm going to be doing\nsorry 11 to 1 and so the game starts at\n12 here so man\nyeah i'll get the second half but no\nthank you for being here man and like i\nsaid i've watched your videos for years\nuh senior interviews uh seeing your\nbooks uh\nseen you know not seeing you on stage in\nperson i look forward to being able to\ndo that uh but i wanted to start with\nthe question i\ni'm not sure if i'm not sure if i've\nseen you been asked this before but\ni wanted to ask you like what's your\nfavorite love story ever\nuh or is is there one that you have\nwhether it's a real life one a client\nuh a personal experience a book is\nyou know what's your favorite story of\nlove that is a really tricky question\nthere's a there's a movie\ni saw recently uh it's a japanese movie\ncalled weathering with you\ni've not seen that it's an animated\nmovie this guy\nhe he created what was at one time the\nbiggest\nuh grossing anime of all time but this\nmovie weathering with you\nis about a young guy and a girl who are\nyou know in this kind of\nthis young love there's this kind of\nmythical story where\nshe that it's constantly raining in\ntokyo\nand she has the power to make the rain\ngo away they call her a sunshine girl\nbut\nand everyone she's surprised because\nshe's the sunshine girl\nand so she's constantly called upon\nby people who are running events or\nfireworks displays or whatever to come\nalong and make it stop raining only and\ni\nspoiler alert for anyone who's not seen\nweathering with you by the way i've come\nback in three minutes\num but there's uh every time she does it\nshe\nshe start a piece of herself starts to\ndisappear\nand it gets to the point where she\ncompletely floats up into the sky\nand no longer has a presence here on\nearth because she's given\nso much as the sunshine girl and\nthere's a moment where he goes to save\nher from\nup in the clouds because he realizes she\ncan't\nyou know even if she comes back down to\nearth\nand never does another thing as a\nsunshine girl and all it does is rain\nall day\nhe still chooses her wow and\nthe for me at least i'm not saying the\ndirector meant this but\nit's so beautiful because it felt to me\nlike a story of a\nof a person who was accepting that\neven if being with you means that it's\nthat it's raining\nyeah i still choose you i don't just\nchoose you when the sun is shining\nand there's something stunningly\nbeautiful to me about that because\nthat's a\nit's a much more grown up kind of love\nthan the one that we tend to look for in\nour 20s\nyeah or as teenagers and some of us for\nthe rest of our lives\nyeah where you know we love someone as\nlong as the sun is shining\nbut when when the chips are down and\nwhen things are tough\nthey start reassessing everything that's\na beautiful answer\ni love that that was wonderful i mean\nlike i love movies too so when you said\na movie\nand i've not seen that movie so that\nsounds amazing i love that what a great\nlove story\nand uh yeah now now i don't know should\ni still watch the movie i\nreally enjoy it and there's another\nmovie he did prior to that called your\nname\nokay and um and there there's something\nvery beautiful about his movies yeah i\nwould check them out yeah okay i'll take\na look yeah no i love that and it's so\ninteresting with\nwhat you refer to there this idea of the\nview we have of\nlove and relationships in our teens in\nour 20s or\nlike you said for some people their\nwhole life how do you think your view of\nlove has changed while\nhelping people create find keep love\ni mean you know you've been on this\namazing journey you've been doing this\nfor what\ndecade now 15 years 15 years right okay\nso you've been doing this for 15 years\nhow has your view of love changed\nover the last 15 years of actually\nworking with people and\nspeaking on stages being interviewed in\nall these places i suppose\ngetting older myself and i realize i'm\nstill relatively speaking a young man\nbut getting\nolder myself it's become much more\napparent to me the importance of\nreevaluating what is\nactually important in a partner\nand we tend to our younger selves we\nwe do have this list of things that we\nthink we want\nthat seem important might be charisma it\nmight be the fact that\nyou know someone uh is super sexy\nbecause they can speak three languages\nor that you know they've achieved a\ncertain status in their life or an award\nor\nwhatever they're they can play the\nguitar\nand we we rate these things as these\nthings that we you know when we think of\nlosing someone we look at all of those\nthings and go\ni couldn't lose them you know they're\nthey're funny and they're charismatic\nand\nand they're super fun to be around and\nthey're sexy and they can play the\nguitar and they can\nyou know speak three languages and and\nit still is a kind of\ninstagram profile version of a person\nand someone recently said to me like i'm\nin a relationship with a guy\nand you know he plays the guitar and i\nfind that really sexy\nand he's really good looking and i'm\nlike\nhe doesn't need in order to be in a\nrelationship with you he doesn't need to\nbe great\nat music he needs to be great at a\nrelationship\nyeah and if you want to hear someone\nplay guitar really well go to a john\nmayer concert yeah\nlike sheeran yeah like you don't need\nthat every day in your relationship\nyeah right what's important in a\nrelationship is someone who is really\ncompetent in a relationship\nand has those skills and those skills\nare hard won\nit's one of the reasons that\nrelationships with big age gaps don't\nwork\nit's not because there is necessarily a\nchasm in the way these two people feel\nit's the there is a huge chasm when it\ncomes to their relationship competence\nand their experience and that really\ndoes\nmatter and if you're with someone who\nhas\nany a far\nlower level of relationship experience\nthen they either have to learn through\nyou\nwhich is going to be a painful process\nthey're going to make a lot of mistakes\nthey're going to hurt you a lot in the\nprocess that you're going to feel like\nyou're gonna have to be careful of\navoiding the role of teacher\nconstantly in the relationship and try\nand be equals in a situation that's\ninherently kind of unequal\num and and you're gonna have to hope\nthat\nthey do learn those skills you're making\nquite a big bet\non the idea that one day they will have\nthat skill set\nsome people take most of their lives to\nget it and some people never learn it\nbecause they're not the kind of people\nthat\nwant to grow and be self-aware and do\nthe work\nand so i i have come to\nreally believe that my view of love has\nchanged\nto the extent that i think firstly the\nidea of\nyou know is it about meeting the right\nperson or is it about\nbeing the right time and i've\nstarted to weight my opinion far more\ntowards time\nwow that when you have\ndecided it's the right time for you to\nreally meet someone\nyou go into love with a completely\ndifferent intentionality\nlove isn't happening to you it's not\nthis\nwave that's washing over you which is\nsuper easy\nwhen a wave's washing over you just\nstand there and just\nbask in the goodness of how wonderful it\nfeels to\nto feel that sort of drug but that's not\nthe same thing as\nas intentionally there's a difference\nbetween winning the lottery and starting\na business\nyou know when you start a business\nthere's a method there's a\npractical there's a pragmatism to it the\nthings you need to do\nin order to build this thing and i think\nthat\nthat to me it's i don't think i've\ndeveloped a less romantic view\ni i actually if anything have more and\nmore and more come to see\na person who's in a place where they're\nwilling to actually\ndo the work of a relationship as\nromantic\nyeah and i think people consistently get\nburned\nwhen they're not\nfactoring into the equation of how right\nsomeone is\nwhether this person is demonstrating a\nthat they are also a time in their life\nwhere they're looking for the same thing\nand b\nthat they have genuine great\nrelationship\nskills like\nyou know we're all going to argue at\nsome point but how do we argue\nyeah right that's that's just one area\nbut it's a huge thing\nso that that to me would probably be the\nbiggest shift i i believe in timing more\nthese days\nand i believe that we increa\nwe undervalue to an incredible extent\nyeah\ngenuine relationship skills and we\novervalue\njust kind of mindless attraction yeah\nyeah i love that answer man that's so\nthat's so fascinating to compare\nperson versus time and i yeah i often\nsay to my friends like the most romantic\nthing in the world is someone who's\ntrying to build\nrelationship competence like that that\nis the most\nromantic expression that someone can\nhave i love the way you talk about\nrelationship skills and we're talking\nabout relationship\ncompetence i find that actually and and\ni can say this for my relationships too\nbefore i met\nmy wife and with now uh relationship\ncompetence always felt like both people\ndidn't have it\ni don't think i was in many relations\nwhere i had it and the person didn't\nactually think for many years it was\njust we both had like me and the other\nperson we both had\nzero relationship competence how do you\nthink people build\nrelationship competence because it\nalmost feels like and you're right and\nyou know i know we both agree on this\nthat\nyou just expect to know how to be in a\nrelationship and you kind of just\nyou're almost expected to know that oh\nyeah you start dating and then you know\nwhat to do next and none of us know what\nto do next or\nnow tell us about how you go about\nbuilding relationship competence and\nwhat are the skills that you\nkind of break it down into for people to\nthink about that well firstly i\nhad very much the same experience as you\ni always thought i was such a great guy\nin relationships i really did like say i\nalways thought i was so\nyou know the line i always used to say\nabout myself is you know i\nyeah maybe i wasn't ready or maybe i\nwasn't in a place where i wanted the\nsame thing but\ni was a great partner yeah while i was\nin it\nit wasn't true no i was i was\nuh what's the word i was a gentleman\ni was respectful i in many ways i've\nalways been kind that's always been a\nthrough line\nof my life but you can be kind and dumb\nyeah\nand you can hurt a lot of people when\nyou're kind and dumb you know and\nso i i look back on myself and it\nsometimes it takes someone who's\nbetter than you at a certain part of a\nrelationship maybe not the whole thing\nbut they come\nalong and and you\nnotice that they\nyou know going back to that example\nargue differently\nthan you do you went into fight mode\nand they they went into compassion mode\nand said look babe i know you on i know\nyou feel like this\nbut here's like the way you're reacting\nright now here's how it's making me feel\nand you go oh that was different what\nwas that it's like you learned a new\nmove\nyeah yeah what was that move i haven't\nseen that one before i'm\nusually i've been in relationships where\ni say this and then you give me the\nsilent treatment\nand then i have just i i feel justified\nin then\nbeing mean because you're going silent\nand now we amp it up and\nand now all of a sudden you you you come\nacross someone\nwho takes you off road and and that's a\nscary moment and when someone takes you\noff road you have two choices you can\neither\nyou can either be afraid of that i know\nthere's\nsomething uncomfortable about it because\nyou're not used to it even\nkindness can be uncomfortable if you're\nnot used to it absolutely\nright but when someone takes you\noff-road that\nthat really is an opportunity to watch\nwhat someone else is doing i think that\nthe same is true in business right it's\nyou you see someone else who just did a\ndifferent thing\nlike in your industry someone did\nsomeone took a a turn that everyone else\ndidn't\nand you can either be the person who\nsays what are they what are they\nwhat's that why are they doing that\nthat's stupid\nor they think that's gonna work like or\nyou can go oh that's interesting no one\nelse is doing that yeah why are they\ndoing that let's\nlet me let me check that out like you\ncould be curious about it\nespecially if you think oh there's\nsomething to that what they're doing yes\nso i think that the exploring areas\nwhere\nsomeone isn't doing the same thing as\nyou\nand it takes you into a different\nexperience it's not bad it's like it\nalmost feels like oh this is\nuncomfortable but maybe it's showing me\nsomething i'm not very good at\nyou know maybe they just maybe\nthey went out with their friends and i\npicked a fight because i'm jealous\nabout something that i think is i've got\nthis portrayal of what's going on\nwhatever\ni went out with my friends and they said\nhey have the best night babe\nyeah and i'm like oh that's weird\neveryone i've been with so far as\nwhen i go out with my friends they get\nsuper jealous yeah and that always makes\nme feel like i've got something to\nresist\nyes but now i just went out and they\nsaid have the best night by the way you\nlook gorgeous\nand i'm like uh okay what's that well\nthat's a new move which is\nthat one you know and you learn\nsomething and that you pay attention\nbecause you go that was really\ninteresting that maybe\nmy god that made me that made me when i\nwas out think about them half the time\nyou know and think\nwhat a sexy confident person they are\nyeah that's how i want to make\nher feel that when she next goes out\nyeah and that apparently that\nthat's how you do that oh that's\ninteresting you learn from it\nso i think that there's a learning that\nwe get from relationships but in order\nto do that you actually have to be in a\nspace of\nof of being willing to put eyes on\nyourself\nyeah and in a constant student mindset\nwhich most of us are not you know we do\ngo into relationships a lot of us\nthinking\nwe know it all we learnt it all from our\nlast relationship we but there's\nthere is ju it's a cliche but they're\njust\nthere's always another level there are\nso many levels to life\nand it fascinates me because i i'm\nalways thinking that i'm just thinking\nmy god there are so many people that are\nso good\nyeah at so many different things like\nnot i'm not saying everyone's better\nthan us\nthey might be good at this one piece of\nthe puzzle but you watch how they do it\nyou go that's really interesting there's\nsomething to learn from that\nbut if we're constantly trying to defend\nour own position\nand trying to feel like what we do is\nthe right way we'll never\nwe'll never learn that yeah and i do i'm\na believer in\ni'm a believer in therapy or anything\nthat gets you to be\nto to look at yourself in a in a\nconstructive way\nand and someone in front of you who's\nnot going to give you the answers that\nyou\nwant you know i remember a long time ago\num me saying to a friend like\ni'm in i was in this relationship and i\nwas like you know this person wants to\nspeak a lot and i've you know i've got\nthis and i've got this and i've got this\nand i was expecting him to be like\nwell she sounds like a lot of work like\nshe sounds really difficult man that's\nyeah like tell me about it and instead\nhe went\ni'm kind of with her on this one yeah\nlike actually it's\nsuper important that you he he was like\nhe actually said to me something funny\nhe goes you he goes\ni go to the gym one tenth of the time\nyou do\nbut i have a body like a bag of milk\nhe said so you get what you pay for yeah\nyou know and in your relationship you\nget what you pay for\nyou know if you want it to be great\ninvest in it and\nand that's that friend or that mentor or\nthat therapist don't ever see them again\nfire them immediately\nthey're worth their weight in gold\nbecause we surround ourselves with\nyou know people you know men surround\nthemselves with the boys club\noh man she sounds different oh do you\nknow that's so high maintenance blah\nblah\nand women surround themselves with with\ntheir friends who sit around and say i\ncan't believe he did i can't believe he\nsaid that to you i can't\nand half of them sometimes are sitting\nthere going\nyou kind of seem like the unreasonable\none here but they don't tell her yeah\nand then she gets further ingrained in\nthis way of thinking in fact\nthey even may amp her up yeah and send\nher back\ninto a relationship charged now\nand and even more defiant and now you\nknow you get\neven more conflict so that those to me\nare some of the key ways to learn and\nand just to be open always always always\nalways be\nover yeah i love that i love that i\nthink it's so true and i love what you\nsaid about how like\nit's not like you're gonna meet the\nmentor in your partner or the coach or\nthe guru but like they may be just\nbetter at one thing but maybe greater\njust one area of a relationship and\nthat's what you're kind of\nmining and picking from my i when i look\nback at what you're saying in my\nrelationship i'm trying to reflect it\nin my teens i realized i had a serious\nissue with\ni just loved being loved and so\ni was kind i i identified so much of\nwhat you said i was always kind i was\nalways\na gentleman i was always like generous\nbut i realized that in my teens i would\ngo above and beyond\nto want someone to fall in love with me\nand that's what i wanted all i actually\nwanted was for someone to fall in love\nwith me\nand it didn't actually matter who it was\nsometimes like it wasn't even that\ni really liked them or knew them or\nunderstood them i just wanted that\nfeeling of\nthis person loves me and what would\noften happen is they would fall in love\nwith me because i would be the perfect\nguy\nby giving them gifts and remembering\nthis and whatever it was\nand and then i would feel like they're\nnot giving me anything back\nnow i feel like the one i'm the one\nwho's doing all the loving and there's\nno love back\nwhich i've only created myself because\nof my crazy cycle\ntotally relate to all of that and i was\nthat guy too and\nthose guys will often look at guys who\nare\nkind of the textbook the textbook jerk\nyeah and be like well he's awful yes\nlike you know he slept with her and he\ncompletely ghosted her and he never\ncalled her again or he disrespect\nwhatever he's\nit's easy to point to that guy yeah and\nbeing like what a piece of crap that guy\nis\nbut we're more dangerous\ni would then break up with them because\ni didn't feel loved\nand then i'd feel like i was the victim\nand that i'd been the one not treated\nwell\nand then my wife broke me because i\ntried to i i did the same thing with her\ni was always like but she wasn't\nimpressed by any of the ways i tried to\nlove her\napart from being me and that was when it\nall kind of like unraveled and i was\nlike\noh i finally found someone who actually\ndidn't want all the stuff i was trying\nto do to get her to love me\nand so my wife was the kind of person\nwho broke through that barrier because\nshe just didn't care\nabout the stuff or the memory\nor the gifting or the extravagant like\nshe hated all that stuff\nand so all of a sudden my technique\nwasn't not it wasn't even a technique it\nwas genuine\nin my delusion but it wasn't working\nanymore\nright and that's when i had to really\nlook at it because i really loved my\nwife and i was like oh i actually have\nto really look at this and so\nshe was the one who broke that and\ntaught me that idea\nthat's beautiful yeah so it took someone\nwho\nvalued something completely different\nthan the thing\nthat the weapon you were used to using\nright exactly the move\nthe move took away all of your special\nmoves yeah all the power\nwas gone you have to fight this fight\nnow with none of these special moves\nyeah\nand then you all of a sudden like you\nsay it's like being stripped there yeah\nnow i get a chance to truly be loved for\nfor who i am yeah not the the\nperformance\nthat i'm doing in the beginning which as\nyou say it's not that it's not\nit's not getting you in yeah it wasn't\nlike i was manipulating it wasn't\nmanipulative\nit's genuinely about\ngetting something for ourselves\ncompletely as opposed to genuinely about\ndiscovering somebody else or building\nsomething or whatever and\nand i did the same thing and it's it's\none of the great\nyou know i deal with my god in my\ncompany\nwe're dealing with i mean millions of\nwomen a month\nworldwide but tens of thousands in terms\nof real coaching\nand the the one of the\nbiggest problems is people falling for\npeople really quickly\nyes falling in love too fast\nwhere it's because they went on a couple\nof great dates with a guy\nand they can look at the date and go he\nwas amazing and\nyou you should have seen what he did and\nhow he was on the date and all of that\nand the thing i have to always break\ndown is\nthat may not have been about you\nit is about something he wanted you to\nfeel\nby the end of the date and\nnot that you know you i i'm a\ni kind of loathe this culture we have\nright now where everyone's a narcissist\nyes we call we're so quick to like label\nyeah he's a narcissist\nshe's a narcissist like i'm like not\never like\nwe all have a narcissistic streak\nabsolutely and we all exhibit\nnarcissistic behaviors at times that\ndoesn't mean we're a diagnosable\nnarcissist but a narcissistic streak we\nall have\nearly in dating and to differing degrees\nis\nthe desire to impress yes\nrather than connect and so we go on a\ndate with someone and you know\nat the height of it if someone's really\non the extreme end they will give the\ngreatest date of someone's life yeah and\nthat person goes away and they're like\nthis guy is amazing or this person\nand they they may have put on an amazing\ndate but you\nyou know nothing yet and what's cool\nabout your wife's\nyou know going through that process with\nyou is\nyou know i can imagine for her it's\nalmost like\nwell i want to see how you are in week\nfour yeah or i want to see how you are\nin month three yeah or and until you've\nbeen there\nyou really don't know how great of a\npartner somebody\nis going to be yeah and that that's what\ni mean by\nyou know when you ask me about what i've\nreally learned about love and and i\ntalked about valuing the wrong things\nthat's one of the big ways that it shows\nup if you are getting\ncrazy nervous on a date you're already\nthat's already a reflection of the fact\nthat you've valued the wrong things\nbecause you're valuing this person's\nlooks or their status\nor what you perceive them to be but you\ncan't you're not valuing them in a\nrelationship\nor in relation to you which is defined\nby\nhow much they give how they connect with\nyou how they relate to you how they see\nyou\nall of that stuff is it completely is\nyou're a zero yeah so how can you be\nnervous if you're valuing\nthe right things you can only be nervous\nif you're valuing the wrong things\nif that to me is the key to eliminating\nearly\nnerves in early dating is that there is\ni almost feel a little fatalistic about\nit which is funny coming from someone\nwho\ngives advice in this area for a living\nbecause you know i\ni do believe that we can influence\nsituations with\nwhat we do but we do have to have a bit\nof a dose of fatalism that the thing\nthat didn't pan out\nwasn't the thing the person who's still\ngreat in week eight\nis showing you the right things but if\nthey suddenly\nghost you in week nine then it doesn't\nmean they would have been great in week\n16. yeah yeah yeah they're like oh but\nthey were the one and i just i don't\nknow what\ni need closure you have closure\nthat action was closure what they showed\nyou is they had eight good weeks in them\nyeah that's interesting yeah that's\ninteresting it's\nit's and it's the same as you'd say in\nsport\nlike if you if you i'm just i was just\nthinking about sport while you were\nsaying that it's the idea of like\na player may have one good season in him\nor her\nand then that player may have had 10\ngood seasons in him or her and sometimes\nwe have these\nplayers where we're like oh she's going\nto be the next or he's going to be the\nnext and then all of a sudden\nthey don't give you that season and in\nsports we get closure by just going\nalright they had potential but they\ndidn't make it\nbut you're right in love and life it's a\nlot hard to have that mentality of like\nthey gave me eight good weeks but they\ndidn't make it\nwhy you and you sit there and you obsess\nover someone who just left you\ngoing you obsess over what they could\nhave been\nyeah that's what it is could have you\nknow\nthis was so promising they were\neverything that i was looking for this\ncould have been and anytime you you\nsomeone breaks up with us\nyou know the heartbreak is the loss of\nthe life we thought we were going to\nhave\nwith someone this is this is what it\ncould have been this is what it\nshould have been yeah and my answer to\nthat is\nit would have been if it should have\nbeen and could have been yeah\nthen it would have been you're literally\nyou're grieving over something that\nwas not it by definition\nit wasn't meant to happen because it\ndidn't happen yes\nyeah yeah it didn't happen so this idea\nthat it\nit was supposed to or it should have is\nis myth fantasy it's science fiction\nyeah\nbut i feel like in relationships we have\nthis fantasy mind\nthat's already written the script and\nthe book\nand the trilogy before the second date\nis over\nand so it's almost like relationship\nseems to be like the one area of your\nlife\nwhere we write decades into the future\nand we can't help ourselves because we\nalmost think that that and it's almost\nlike you're living what you're saying is\nyou're living off the fantasy not even\nof the reality that's right in front of\nyou\nand so even when you're on a date with\nthem you're not even there because\nyou're in your fantasy land\nand of what you think it is and that's\nwhere in in so many ways everything that\nyou are you know your expertise in\nmindfulness and everything you've\nlearned there\nis so important in dating\nbecause in dating you have to be on the\ndate you're on\nmindful dating is be on the date you're\non\ndon't be on date two but really you're\nnot you're on date 32.\nyeah your mind has to be on date two\nwith your body\nyes and when people don't do that\nthat's where they start they start\nconstructing\na fantasy of where this relationship is\ngoing a fantasy of who this person is\nthey know five percent of someone and\nthey've built the other 95\nout of out of uh uh extrapolation\nyeah oh he was really sweet in that\nmoment you know obey's good with kids\ni basically amazed that he's you know i\nbet he's an amazing family man a bit\nyou know and and we've all had the\nexperience of meeting someone who is\nincredibly charming fun to be around\nyou know you went away from like as men\nwe sometimes go\nout and we meet another man and it's\nlike we've been a date on a date with\nthat man and you come home and you go\nhe was so great you know i loved him to\nbits he was\nand he really charmed you and then six\nmonths later the\nthat person has really lost their shine\nyeah because\nthey're flaky you realize they don't\nactually show up when\nwhen you need them to you realize that\nit's they they kind of you know it's\nthat that in the talented mr ripley\nthere's that great lie\nthat's a great movie great movie there's\na great line where matt damon is like\nyou know he's become the new chosen best\nfriend of\nof um jude law's character his name jude\nlaw's character's name's dicky and matt\nmatt damon is is feeling suddenly shut\nout like out of nowhere he feels shut\nout when\nfive minutes ago he was like this guy's\nmy best friend and he loves me and he's\nso\nand he says to matt damon's girlfriend\nat the time\nhe he's expressing how he feels that it\nyou know or\nno he's not even expressing she sees the\nlook on his face that he's sad that he\nno longer has this like\nfriendship that feels real to him\nand she says the thing about dickie is\nwhen when he puts his attention on you\nit's like the sun is shining on you and\nthen\nthe attention moves on and it's very\ncold yeah and\nand that's the experience of a lot of\nthose people but when you're taking\nthe five percent of the sun shining on\nyou and you use it to build the 95\npercent that you cannot possibly know\nyou can't know who this person is when\nyour brother gets sick\nand you need to travel to the hospital\nto be with that person and you need\nsupport in that moment you can't know\nhow that person is when you're having an\nanxious moment and you need someone to\nshow love and compassion towards you\nand this anxiety that you can't seem to\ncontrol and what you really need is a\nloving teammate to be there with you and\nnot to judge you you can't\nknow what this person is like in year\nthree of a relationship\nwhen the you know you need to make a\nshift in your sex life because it feels\nlike that part has become staid but you\nneed to work together to figure out you\ndon't know what that person is like in\nthose stages so\nso thinking that you have all the\nanswers because you've been on\neven 10 or 15 dates with this person and\nhad a wonderful time\nis a is a fallacy a fantasy\nthere's a great um the the relationship\nitself is about\nevery stage of it and the effort that's\nput in and there's a\nthere's a story from bukowski where he\nhe slept with a prostitute every\nromantic story begins with\nbegins this way he's lived with a\nprostitute and she\num he woke up to her having stolen his\npoetry\nand he was so upset so mad terrible yeah\nand um\nhe wrote about it and he wrote a piece\nthat\nwas all about how you could take\nanything\ntake my money take the other stuff in\nthe in the apartment\ntake it all but please not my\nanything but my poetry and the whole\npiece finishes with the line and then\ngod said crossing his legs\ni see where i have created a great many\npoets\nbut not so very much poetry and the\nthe idea is that you know the person who\nhas potential\nin a relationship is the poet\nthe poet everyone's a poet not many\npeople writing poetry yeah\nwriting is the more difficult part a lot\nof people who are great on a date very\nromantic\nvery charming they're a poet on a date\nthe poetry is the relationship and and\nyou shouldn't you know bukowski was\nupset because his\npoetry was taken the thing he'd worked\non\nand that's how it should be in a\nrelationship is\ndon't don't get upset because you lost a\npoet\npoets are a dime a dozen\npoetry is rare people who are willing to\nwrite the poetry of a relationship\npeople who are willing to stick it with\nyou for a year two years five years 10\nyears\nthat's really rare and we need to start\nvaluing the poetry\nfar more than we value the poet yeah i\nlove that what a beautiful analogy let's\nlet's talk a bit about that poetry\nbecause i feel like\nwhat's amazing is we convince ourselves\nmore of the fiction when you\nare lusting after that person's\nlooks fame prestige whatever whatever\nthey have that you're attracted to it's\nalmost like\nthen even if they do a million bad\nthings like you said about the guy\nplaying the guitar or whatever it is\nit's like\nyou're like oh but he's so or she's so\nwhatever but tell us a bit about what to\nlook out for\nso when people are out there and i know\nwhat i love about what you do is that\nand i love this conversation by the way\nso far because\nit's it's it's philosophical and it's\nreal but you're great at getting\npractical too and i see that in all the\nwork you put out\nwhat's some of the practical things that\npeople can look out for i know so many\nfriends who are\nin early relationships or just started\nto date someone or finally met someone\nwhat can they look for in those moments\nor is it looking for anything i mean\nmaybe that's even the wrong place to\nstart\ni think it's so we have a duty early on\nto bring our best\nto the table in as much as we can we're\nall going to make mistakes we're all\ngoing to have\nanxious moments or jealous moments or\nmoments where we let our insecurity get\nthe better of us\nmoments where we let our anger get the\nbetter of us\neveryone's gonna have these moments but\nwe want to try\nand put our best foot forward\nbut i always think that we learn a lot\nin the moments where you have your first\nfight\nor you reveal something about\nyourself and you see how they react\nto it you know do they react with\ncompassion\nor is there immediate judgment\nand and and i don't mean a moment where\nyou kind of\ntry and perform yeah i mean a moment\nwhere you genuinely\nare brave enough to let someone in and\nbe seen\nyes does this person do they see you\ndo they acknowledge you and do they show\ncompassion\nand curiosity about why you are that way\nand\nwhat's happened in your life to get you\nthere do they really are they looking\nto figure you out and who you are is a\nwonderful wonderful sign because\na lot of people are just in a\nrelationship and they're sleepwalking\nyeah\nthey're just they're they're enjoying it\nthey're enjoying the fruits of the\nrelationship but\nyou don't get the impression someone's\nreally trying to get to know you\nyou don't feel seen by that person the\nperson who's actually asking questions\nof you\nthe person who's looking to understand\nthe good\nand the bad in you and who elevates the\ngood\nand soothes the bad that's\nsomething very beautiful to look out for\nthe person who can come back and say\nsorry\nas of course and i apply the same\nstandard to to both sides yeah of course\nbut the person who can\nwho can come back and say sorry you know\nagain\nwe we all when i'm when with one of my\nstaff in my company\nwhen i say you know when i give them a\ndifficult piece of feedback\ni don't expect them to smile in that\nmoment i don't expect them to like\ntake you know in i would hope that they\ndon't\nreact in a really negative or toxic way\nbut\ni don't expect them to have an easy time\nwith that but if that person can go away\nover the next few hours or days\nand then come back and say you know i\nreally thought about what you said and\ni'm going to work on that\nthat's something to look for because you\ncan really like that person\nif you're both that kind of person you\ncan work with\nthat person yeah that's someone you can\ngenuinely\nhave a relationship with because it's\nnot a relationship that's based on\nperfection or never having an argument\nbut it is based on two people who are\nhumble enough\nto genuinely own their mistakes\nor to own the areas where they want to\nget better\num i'm always looking at the ways\npeople argue\nand whether they whether they're trying\nto do damage in an argument yeah or\nwhether they're trying to\nrebuild in an argument and if you're\nwith someone that\nevery time you come out of an argument\nyou feel like they lacerated you\nand there's you come out of an argument\nbleeding\nevery time you know and you're like\nthat why did they have to say that\nincredibly nasty\nthing and it's one thing if they come\nback to\nan hour later and say or even a day\nlater and say i\ntruly regret having said that to you and\ni will do better\nbut if they weren't even acknowledged\nthat that was a really\ntoxic way to have an argument and that\nwas a really nasty thing to say\nthen that's a problem because this is a\nrelationship that's not going to soothe\nyou\nyeah it's going to create more and more\nwounds so that i would say is an\nimportant thing\nand and two people genuinely\ngenuinely at the core of it operating as\na team what do you what do you need\nand can i tell you you know you're\nworking really hard right now\ncan i understand what your goal is\nin doing this and seek to understand\nthat\nand where that's coming from for you and\nwhy that's important\nbut can i also voice to you that\ni'm not feeling very loved right now and\nthat i'm\ni you know maybe it's just my insecurity\nor maybe that\nyou know but i or maybe i don't have\nsome enough as much many things going on\nin my life right now as you do in yours\nbut\ni know one of the effects is it's\ncreating some anxiety for me\nand it's making me feel like you don't\nlove me as much as i love you\nyou know you want an environment\nwhere you can have that real\nconversation\nand it it then to me a relationship is\nno longer about\nright and wrong it's about the\nconversation\ncan the conversation be had that to me\nis\none of the greatest signs of a\nrelationship you should hang on to\nyeah is can the relationship be had\nand can it be had in a beautiful and\nproductive and\nloving way yeah because that's all that\nyou know\num david brooks said marriage is a\n50-year conversation\nright is that conversation does it feel\ngood\nyeah doesn't always feel comfortable but\ndoes it feel like this is a conversation\nthat's making me better\nyeah or is it a conversation that's\nalways making me worse yeah\ni love that and and i think it's it's\nsuch a vicious cycle though sometimes\nbecause i find that\nyou get into an argument like you said\nwhich i think the first argument is such\na great\nuh like it's such a great marker to put\ndown as\nlet's let's reflect on this i think\nthat's such a great way of putting it\nthat you said\nand if you look at that often what\nhappens is the person reacts badly it's\nnatural\nyou react badly too and then you're\nwaiting for that person to make up and\nthat person's waiting for you to make up\nand then maybe you go ahead and put the\nfirst hand in\nbut then now they deal with the second\nbad and now you're waiting again and i\nfeel like we get lost in this like\nwaiting game and i kind of got to a\npoint where i was just like\ni want to make sure that i am leading\nthis conversation so a conversation that\nme and my wife always have is\ni'll always check in with her and be\nlike is this relationship going in the\ndirection you want it to go in\nlike is this going in the direction is\nthis relationship what you want it to be\nand if it's not what do you want it to\nbe and what are you willing to do to get\nthere because\nand i'll always be like well this is not\nhow i want the relationship to be\nand this is what i wanted to be and i\nfelt like that conversation for me is\nreally healthy\nand i'm always happy one thing that i've\ngot to right now and i think my wife has\nthis in different parts of our\nrelationship\ni'm always happy to take the\nresponsibility\nfor the quality of the relationship\nbecause i'm in it in the same way as i'm\nwith my company in the same way as i'm\nfor this podcast\nthe same as them for anything it's like\nit's easy to\nit's easy to sit there and go well what\nare you bringing to the table\nand and i realized at one point where i\nwas like if i care about stuff\ni've got to be okay with grabbing onto\nthe reins and\nthe funny thing is i started to realize\nthat that actually there are plenty of\ntimes when my wife does that\nshe just does it in different areas that\ni don't notice\nand so it can feel like i'm carrying the\nburden\nbut actually that's not true i'm i'm\ntaking responsibility where i thrive\nand actually she's taking responsibility\nresponsibility where she thrives and i\ndon't even notice that\nand that's when i started to feel\nhealthier rather than like i was like\nwell\nwhere you show up like what are you\ndoing and uh i remember\nwhen i was a monk the the teachers would\nalways tell us that\nyou know you may sit in a class with a\nnon-charismatic teacher\nso they're like some of the monks are\nnot gonna be the most charismatic the\nmost\nattentive the most like dynamic teachers\nof the\nthe the text and the spiritual\nscriptures and they were like but if\nyou're a student that's 10 out of 10\neven if the speakers are one out of ten\nin presentation\nyou're gonna get lots but if you're a\none out of ten and the speaker's ten out\nof ten then they're lifting you up\nbut by the way if you're at a one out of\nten and they're at a one out of ten\nthat's all you're gonna get and it's\nkind of like what your friend said about\nthe\nbag of milk you know the idea the idea\nof like taking your own responsibility\nfor if you want to be in a relationship\ni'd love to hear your thoughts on that\nyeah but that speaks again\nyou're so right jay and it's truly\nbeautiful that you have that in your\nrelationship and it's\nand it's also brave because talking\nthose conversations are not easy\nthey and people can say things in those\nrelationships in those conversations\nthat\ncan scare us they can say well i'm not\nhappy because i want it to go in this\ndirection yeah i've heard that too yeah\nlike you know or i didn't realize you\nwere unhappy in that way or i didn't\nrealize you felt like that though\nit takes a lot of bravery to have\nconversations like that and i commend\nyou for that and i and i think\nthat's one of the things a lot of people\naren't willing to do is step bravely\ninto an area where they could be\ncriticized\num but i i think it is\none of the most important aspects\nof a relationship is being able to do\nexactly that\nso no i think it's i think it's a a\nstunning thing\nwell it's uncomfortable like you're\nsaying it's not and and i'm not sharing\nis like we've perfected and we've got it\nright i'm just saying that that's what\nwe've had to do\nin order to like you know we're only at\nyear five year eight in our relationship\nyeah five in marriage\nbut it's like that's what we've just\ni've had to find these\nwhat you're saying like the 50-year\nconversation and the idea you're saying\nof having these\nlike i'm just i've noticed that without\nthese things you could go years without\nchanging anything but speaking of what\nyou said with the the\nidea of the monks that to me goes back\nto the\nyou know what i was saying about timing\nbeing important yeah\ni do believe when you go into a\nrelationship\nwith genuine purpose and even when you\ngo into dating with genuine purpose you\nyou know you go on a dating app because\na lot of people out there listening to\nthis won't be in relationship they'll be\nright now in the crapshoot of dating\napps trying to figure out how to\nnavigate\nwhen we're intentional we bring a\ndifferent energy\nto the things we do we bring a different\nenergy\nto a person and in a relation in early\ndating i think that when you're really\nintentional\nand when you really are like i'm looking\nfor\na real connection here you don't\nactually judge people as quickly\nyeah you don't dispose of people as\nquickly where you just go wrong wrong\nwrong wrong\nwrong wrong wrong you you start actually\nlooking for what could be right\nyou start and i'm not saying ignoring\nabusive and toxic behavior i'm just\nsaying\nthose superficial things we just you\nknow\ndecide no they don't meet this checklist\nthey don't meet this one or whatever\nwe lose that because what we're looking\nfor is is deeper and we start\ngenuinely seeking to like we're on a\ndate and we start going let me\nreally find out who this person is yeah\nlike let me really see them and let me\nnot be judgmental of them so quickly and\nand look to understand them and the\nthe reward for that is that this person\nnow actually feels seen by you\nyeah that's great advice and they now\ngive you a different energy than they\nmay have given on the last 10 days yeah\nyou suddenly they blossom on the date\ndifferently\nbecause of the energy in front of them\nthere's a\nmitch album wrote a line about you know\nif the culture isn't\nserving you then you have to be brave\nenough to create your own culture\nand in dating for so many people i\nyou know i get all the complaints about\ndating these days you know it's\nsuperficial it's\nno one everyone's flaky no one goes on\nreal dates no one's trying no one's\nreally committing no one wants a real\nrelationship it's like okay so what\nyou're describing to me\nis what you perceive to be a culture\nyeah that's not working for you yeah\nbut if that culture isn't serving you\nthen create your own culture\nthat surrounds you and\nand your culture it can be powerful not\nfor the world necessarily because in for\nthat there needs to be a combined\ncultural shift\nbut in your micro\nlife in your micro problems and\nopportunities\nthe culture you create will have an\nimpact on the people around you\nyeah and it the same way you know i said\nif you go into a room at a party and you\nsay i hope this part is good\nwell now you're a victim to however this\nparty is\nyeah you know if everyone seems kind of\nclosed off and mean\nand you know there's cliquey and it's\nlike oh god\nthen you go home and you say oh my god\nthat party was so\nyou know it was one of those horrible\nparties but if you go in and you say\ni'm gonna at the very least be\nresponsible\nfor a part of this party yes i'm gonna\ngo in and i'm gonna\ngive the love and the energy and the and\nthe and the compassion and the\nauthenticity that i would\nlove for people in this room to join me\nin giving some will\nsome won't and by the way that's also\ngood because it will help you find your\ncrowd\nright yeah so you you find your crowd by\nbeing the thing you want to be\nnot by hoping that your crowd elicits it\nfrom you\ncompletely you found your crowd online\nby going out and being an energy\nthat you wanted to be first and then\nthat crowd noticed you it's like a\nlighthouse or the ships\nstart knowing where to come home because\nthey see the\nyou know they see the lighthouse that\nthat\nfor me is that's one of the most\nbeautiful things about giving energy\nearly on\ni see dating you know not just\nrelationships but i see people in dating\nthese days it's\nthe game is who can try less who can be\ncooler who can be more indifferent and\nand that's honestly not the way to do it\nthat's certainly the way to attract\nsomeone of a lower frequency i love that\nyeah right you can certainly attract\nsomeone who wants the game\nwho wants the who's got the demons that\nmake them chase someone who's not into\nthem\nyeah you know and there are plenty of\npeople with those demons but you don't\nwant to be in a relationship with a\nperson like that\nbecause for sure a person like that the\nmoment you stop playing hard to get and\nyou turn around to meet them\nthey're not going to be interested in\nyou anymore because their demons will\ntell them\nthis person likes us now they're not\nthey\nthis person is no longer cool to us yeah\nthey were only called to us as long as\nthey didn't like us\nso you can't ever so messed up yeah but\nit's you know it's that uh\nthat groucho marx thing i wouldn't want\nto be a member of any club that would\nhave me as a member\nyeah that describes dating insecurity\namongst people like that is i wanna\nthat person doesn't want me they must be\na catch yeah\nyeah yeah yeah exactly and and so\nwhat we have to do is give when we give\na little more energy\nin dating and say you know what this\nperson who i've known for five\nminutes maybe i'm not\nfeeling much energy here but i'm just\ngoing to give some energy\ni'm going to give an amount of energy\ni'm willing to lose right that's an a\nkey way of looking at it\nwhat you don't do is you keep trying\nwith someone who's not giving you equal\nenergy back\nthat then becomes masochistic right but\ngiving an amount of energy you're\nwilling to lose i always think about\nthat in every interaction that's so true\nyeah given amount you don't mind losing\nyeah it's like going into the casino and\nplaying\nlike roulette it's like all right i'm in\nvegas\ni'll give like a hundred bucks yeah and\nthen i'm not spending anything else here\nin these casinos that's\nit yeah you know for me it's normally\nlike 10 bucks because i just i\ni'm not a gambler but you just decide\nwhat am i happy to lose and\nit's the same with energy it's you know\ni'm dating right now\ni want to find someone amazing someone\nbeautiful\ni'm gonna give to everyone i interact\nwith an amount of energy i don't mind\nlosing\nand some people i'm gonna i'm gonna\nbring out\nthe people who who now are willing to\ngive it back because all of a sudden\nthey might be jolted out of their little\ncoma that they've been in\nbecause they're disillusioned with\ndating and they feel like no one's\ntrying and\nso they went into their shell but they\nnow they see you with a different level\nof warmth and playfulness\nand and and just positivity and they go\nhuh who is this this makes me feel good\nand then they come out a little bit and\nall of a sudden you see who they are\nyou wake them up a little bit and then\nthere's a bunch of people you won't and\nthat's okay because you were willing to\nlose that much energy\nyeah but what people do instead they do\na far more dangerous thing\nof being afraid of the rejection\nfrom people that they approach or talk\nto in the first five minutes\ngod forbid i get rejected in the first\nfive minutes\nbut then they'll meet someone where they\nhave a bit of connection and chemistry\nbut who isn't trying who isn't giving\nthem equal energy\nand they'll keep pouring energy into\nthat person month after month after\nmonth\nwhen they're not getting the same in\nreturn yeah and they think\nthat's safer than going out there and\ngetting rejected by a new person\nyeah but actually this is the dangerous\none yes they're being rejected in five\nminutes by someone who doesn't even know\nyou who\nwho on an app how much can someone\nreally reject you anyway yeah and we all\nknow our experience we've all chosen\npeople\nin life who on an app we might have\nswiped right past\nabsolutely right so we know from our own\npersonal experience that if we get\nrejected on an app it doesn't even mean\nthat person wouldn't like us in real\nlife\ntotally yeah but we're so afraid of that\nrejection that's\nmortal fear is that rejection and yet\ncontinuing to waste months or years on\nsomeone who's\nwho's giving us unequal energy is\nsomething people\nhappily do they spend that time like\nit's nothing\nbecause that's the reason because it\nfeels safe because it feels like there's\nsomething at least\nthere's some connection there's some\ncomfort well there's a couple of things\nit's\nfirstly it's comfortable right it's what\ni know doesn't mean i'm happiness and\ncomfort very different things\nit's not happy i'm not happy i'm not\ngetting my needs met but it's\ncomfortable yeah\nright so i'll stay in it for that reason\nit's the fear of i'll never find anyone\nagain which is a\nfallacy because you found this person\nyeah you did it already yeah yeah you\nknow and\nby the way this person's not so unique\nthat they're the only person in the\nworld that's going to find you\nattractive\nyeah yeah right like they're attracted\nto you because you're attractive yeah\nbut that's the crazy thing right we have\nthis massive paradox between\nthere's now unlimited choice more than\never you feel like you have\nway more choice than you had before but\nthen we have\nlimitless fear to go with that that we\nmay not find anyone ever again\nlike it's that weird thing right like\nit's the idea of like i i don't so i've\nnever\nhad to online day or app day right i\nbecame a monk when i was\n21 and then my wife's been the only\nperson i've been with since i left\nso i the last really impressive age to\nbecome a monk\nyeah right i feel like that's uniquely\nimpressive is becoming a monk at 12.\nwell i started at 14 so i had seven\nyears\nof of being a single of runway yeah\nbecoming a monk at 80 yeah yeah yeah no\ni\ni think i did it because of having\nhaving to figure out some of this stuff\nbut\nbut i the last time i went on a date was\napart from my wife was about what like\nlike 12 13 years ago so\ni never had to date from an app the\nclosest thing we had was high five do\nyou remember high fives no\nhigh five was like an early facebook\nwhere it showed you 200 to 300 friends\nin your network\ngot it and it was facebook but it was\nmost people most guys in their teens\nused it for dating but\nthe idea of you you feel there's so much\nchoice now\nlike you just like you said you're just\nswiping away you're looking at profiles\neverything but\nat the same time you feel like you'll\nnever find someone again\nwhere's what's happening there what are\nyou seeing there when you're speaking to\npeople i think there's a\ncombination of things it's people aren't\nexperiencing\nfor a lot of people they're not\nexperiencing what they see as an endless\nocean of choice\nyeah what they're experiencing is an\nendless ocean of disappointment\nwow of constantly talking to people with\nit not going anywhere\nbeing ghosted talking to someone and\nthey that person never actually takes\nthem up on going on a date\nso it's like we're living a computer\ngame version of dating but\ni'm not actually meeting up in real life\nor you know meeting someone\nit seems to be going well for a few\ndates and all of a sudden they disappear\nand you know they're or they're not\ninterested anymore it fizzles out and so\nit's it's a lot of disappointment but\nbut the ironic thing about that is that\non the flip side people experience that\nchoice in a negative way so what they\nfeel\nis the person i could be going i'm going\non a date with having\na choice wow and and that brings out all\nof my insecurity\nbecause i feel like i'm never how\ncan i possibly compete with what bo\nburnham\nsays is everything all the time yeah i\ncan't compete\nwith that i can't compete with you\nhaving access\nto everyone in a 10 mile radius\nor more if you choose to have more\nthat's something\ni i how do i possibly live up to that\nand\nthat to me is at the root of so many\npeople's lack of confidence\neven their lack of authenticity when\nthey go on a date because they're trying\nto be\nthey stop trying to connect and they\nstart trying to be something they think\nthe other person\nwants them to be and now it's a\ndeparture from themselves\nnow to me the lesson here is the same as\nyou know one of the things i really\nenjoy about working with people in their\nlove lives\nis that there is it's so transferable\nand universal to other domains\nso if you look at this this problem of\nwe're afraid you know\nwe can't live up to the choice that\nsomebody else has\nthat's actually true in business too\nit's true in content creation\nright like i i've had it in the last\ncouple of years i've had moments where\ni look at just how many creators there\nnow are\nand just how much video content is\npumped online every day\nthat i i feel like i've overeaten and\nwant to be sick\nyeah and i'm like it can get to a point\nwhere even though\nbecause in one sense being good at\nsomething creates confidence\nright if you feel like you're a good\npartner and you're attractive\nand you have good qualities and so on\nthen you feel\nlike a version of competence and the\nsame is true in content creation i've\nbeen doing what i do for 15 years\ni feel very competent when it comes to\nspeaking into a microphone going on tv\ngoing on stage making videos and yet\nthere's still moments where i've had\njust this little feeling of like\ndo i need like does the does the world\nneed another voice\nyeah everyone is speaking all the time\nand i mean this is a side note rant but\nlike you know it's so funny i was\nwatching\nthere was like some thumbnails for mo\nfor a\nmajor podcast and and this is no slant\non it because i\ni understand what happens with this but\nit was so funny because i was like\nthere was one thumbnail that was like\nyou know be kind to yourself\nand then the next one was um achieve\nthrough\nsuffering there's like another one\nthat's like\npush past your limits and and ignore the\nrealistic\nand there's another one that's like\nmotivation is bs and it was all the same\npodcast\nyeah but it's like every next thumbnail\nis like a piece of wisdom that\ncontradicts in some way\nthe last piece right that i think is\njust i think we're all force-feeding\nourselves content at the moment\njust untenable but when you're a creator\nin an environment like that you can get\nto a point where you're like does the\nworld need me\nyeah yeah like if i just stop talking\ndoes it matter everyone else is saying\nit anyway\nin a thousand different ways and\nwhat i tell myself is\nthere is someone that uniquely\nvibes with my personality and\nthe way i deliver the message i need\ni it's not about me worrying how do i\ngrab that person's audience\nor how can i appeal to everybody it's\njust about me saying\nyou know what william zinser there's a\nwonderful book for life and writing\nsomeone once said to me every book on\nwriting is a book on life but there's a\nwilliam zinser wrote one of the seminal\nbooks on writing\nwhich i forget i think it's on how to\ngreat writing or something if you look\nup williams in so people will find it\nbut\num he says you know when you go to\nhe said you may be a aspiring travel\nwriter\nwho when you think about going to tokyo\nto write about tokyo\nyou think that thousands of travel\nwriters have been to tokyo and written\nabout tokyo\nwhat do i possibly have to add\nand he says but the world hasn't heard\nwhat your lens on tokyo is\nthe world hasn't heard your take\non tokyo and that might contain\nsome idea or way of looking at things\nthat\nother people haven't actually done or\nthat you may say the same thing but you\nmay say it fresh\nyeah and and so i tell myself that when\ni'm creating content that\nit's not about appealing to everyone it\nreally is about saying\ni my take on this is\ninteresting for its own sake to the\npeople that vibe with me\nthe same is true in dating that i see\nthat\nyou there is a specific audience for you\nand it doesn't have to be 99.999\nof people yeah if you're looking for a\nserious relationship\nit just has to be one yeah those are\namazing odds that's a great analogy i\nlove that that may\nthat it resonates you're so right on\nboth levels\nand and you're spot on it's it's weird\nthat in dating too we want to be\nattractive to everyone yeah we want\neveryone to feel just as a content\ncreator you want everyone to feel a\ncertain way about you and so\ni think that's such a great way of\nlooking at it and yeah i love the idea\nthe\nthe writer you mentioned around the\nvoice on tokyo yeah i always feel that\ni'm like\npeople we need more faces and more\nvoices and because\nthere are just so many people that you\ncan connect to that i can't connect to\nand vice versa\nwith everyone else and i see that all\nthe time that\nwhatever and whatever field you're into\nright like i always say like there's\nenough space for\nthe best athletes the best actors like\nthere's so many actors\nthere's so many actresses but there's\nalways a new person that kind of makes\nit in and wins the upcoming actor awards\nactress award because you kind of want\nto discover and you also want the idea\nof discovery\nand and i think people almost make it\nlike i think we've always made it about\nlike\noh who's your top three who's your top\nfive and the people that\nactually are watching and listening they\ndon't see it in a hierarchy they just\nare like oh i listen to this group of\npeople right that's usually how people\nthink about it i feel like even if\nsomeone asked me like\nwho are your favorite authors i don't i\ndon't have a categoric like\nnumber one author there's a group of\nauthors that i love reading from yeah\nand and i feel like that's how people\nand in relationships obviously\nlike you're saying it's it's a much\nsmaller pool but\nyou having that intention is going to be\nmuch more clear\nbut tell me about your take on changing\npeople uh i i wonder how much you get\npeople saying i'm with someone i met\nsomeone\nthey have potential i think i can change\nthem there's a quote from i think it's\njacob\nm broads where he says consider how hard\nit is to change yourself\nand you'll understand how foolish it is\nto think you can change somebody else\nand that\npeople should really let that sink in\nbecause at in the beginning of january\n60 70 80 of the world decides they want\nto get fit and healthy\nyeah how\nwhat percentage of those people get fit\nand healthy yeah\nthose are people who want to change\nthey didn't make that resolution for\nnothing they made it because they\nwant that yeah it's not someone saying\nto them you should really lose weight\nand then going i'm\nfine that's someone saying to themselves\ni should really lose weight\nand they still can't do it now\nconsider being in a relationship with\nsomeone\nwho's not even admitting that they need\nto change\nand thinking that they're going to\nchange\nit's hard it would it would be on your\nheart on behalf and i'm not saying it\nwould be wrong to trust someone when\nthey say this but\nit's still speculative if you are in a\nrelationship and you say\nmatt i'm gonna change that's still\nspeculative for me\nyou might yeah it might be too hard yeah\nbut it might be worth me staying if we\nhave a lot of love between us\nand you're saying i'm gonna change\nbecause i say you know what\nthat's if if you're really committed to\nthis then\nthen game on let's do this yeah but\nin order for that to happen you have to\nfirst acknowledge there's something\nto be changed and then show desire to\nchange it and frankly\nto have any real credibility show a plan\nfor changing it\nyeah when two people are in a\nrelationship or two people break up\nand a woman comes to me and says you\nknow um\ntwo weeks later he came back and he said\nhe'll never you know\nhe he wants me back and whatever and\nhe's not gonna hurt me again i always\nsay\nan important question to ask is why\nwould it be different this time\nnot from an emotion not from a like\ncharged place yeah yeah a real\ncuriosity i get that you're telling me\nyeah has that person even thought about\nthat part right like two weeks later\nwhich is a suspect\ntime anyway right because this is like\nyou're very much in the panic stage of\ni'll say anything to get you back right\nnow yeah\nthat's not considered but fine this is\nwhere we're all we're two weeks out from\nour breakup\nyou're telling me you want me back and\nyou'll never hurt me again\ni get you want me back but\nwhat is it that's that's different this\ntime\nthat's what i need to understand to feel\nsafe\nto go down this road with you again and\nand so i think people can and do change\notherwise you and me would be out of a\njob\nbut change\nif you are not the author of your own\nchange\nthen the idea that your partner is\nsomehow going to will you\nyeah to change you know\nit's like telling your partner i want\nyou to do therapy\nyeah and then i'm going okay yeah\nexactly\nand that's the reason most people do go\nright i find at least from from people\nthat i\nspeak to or work with like you hear that\nso often the number one reason people do\ngo to therapy\nis because their partner kind of forced\nthem into it they kind of agreed to it\nand that's and that's a problem because\nyou're hoping\nthat they will see the value in it once\nthey get there and they might\nyeah but you someone needs to have some\nskin in the game\nyeah and and so i just think that\nhere's what i will say because there are\nso many people in relationships\nor in situationships if you want to call\nthem that\nthat are convincing themselves they're\nconning themselves that somebody else is\none day going to be different\nand at that point you have to say to\nyourself\non what basis have you decided this\nwhat is it that this idea that they are\nthat some\ngrand change is imminent what is that\nbased on\nyeah is it based on them having said to\nyou hey i know\nthat in these last few months or or\nyears or whatever this has been a big\nproblem in this relationship and i know\nthat's because of me\nand this is something i am committed to\nchanging yeah\nhave they said that because if they\nhaven't\nyeah i have to ask\nwhere is the logic here yeah\nunderpinning your argument that they're\none day going to change\nyeah oh this isn't about them\nthat they're going to change or that\nthey've even expressed a desire or a\nwillingness or a commitment\nto change this is about\nyour demons calling the shots yeah\nthis is about your fear of losing\nsomeone\nbecause maybe they don't want to change\nbut\nwhat what's really happening is you\ndon't want to lose\nsomeone you don't want to be on your own\nagain you don't want to\ntake the risk that there's something\nelse out there where you can get your\nneeds met on a higher\nlevel and then it becomes about\nexploring yourself\nand and saying well this person's been\nthis way for years and i've complained\nabout it for years\nso is is this still about them can i\nreally keep saying this is about them\nthat's so powerful man that that that\nreally like\nhit a chord and i hope that everyone is\nlistening and watching you know that\ndrops and sinks in for them as well\nbecause\nwhat you just said there i think that's\nthe dilemma that most people are in do i\nstay or do i go\nyeah and you've just answered like you\nknow that's how you know like that's\nit's clear you know i sometimes look at\nvideos of\nof myself from years ago and i cringe\nbecause i\ni'm like i you know it's not\nwhat i'm saying might be factually right\nyeah yeah yeah\nbut the way i'm saying it i i was once\num\nlooking at old hairstyles it's the same\nthing it's like looking at old-fashioned\nscents oh there's oh my god\nthat looked good yeah yeah i thought\nthat yeah i was in beverly hills when i\nfirst got to la i was about 25\nand and i was making a video in front of\nthe beverly hills sign\ni was like i'm gonna get the beverly\nhills sign in the background and\nand and it was a video about getting\nover heartbreak right\nand i think it was like the three tips\nfor getting over heartbreak\nright which by the way as soon as you\nsay three tips\nfor getting over heartbreak you already\ndon't understand\nbecause anyone who's deep in heartbreak\nis not coming to you going what are your\ntips\nthey're going save me from this\nexistential crisis doom\nyeah i am in where life doesn't feel\nworth living right now yeah\nyou know and i was making this video and\nat the end of the video a guy came over\nit's like a three four minute\nvideo because of course you can sum up\nhow to get over deep\ndeep loss in three minutes he came over\nand uh\nhe said to me you've never been\nheartbroken have you\nsomeone who's just watching just listen\nto the whole i didn't know he was\nlistening but he was like in earshot the\nwhole time\nand he was like you've never been\nheartbroken have you now\n25 year old know it or me i was like in\nmy head\nbecause out loud i went no i have and\nyeah i\nhave yeah and i like sort of shuffled on\nin my head i went who do you think you\nare of course i'm like what does this\nguy know yeah\nlike oh you know so much more than me or\nhe was right\ni had never been truly i'd had time i'd\nhad things that\nlike hurt me yeah sure i'd never been\nlike\ncrushed yeah and\nhaving had that experience in my life\nnow\nthe video i make is very different\nhow i talk about that is extremely\ndifferent\nyeah and the reason i say that is\nbecause\ni am aware that\nthese things we're talking about here\nit's very easy from a distance\nto say to people this person hasn't\nchanged\nin a long time what makes you think\nthey're going to change now and why are\nyou still there\nyeah and the why you're still there is\nbecause\nthis stuff is so hard change is so\nhard leaving a situation so hard\nit's doing it changing anything\nis hard like this is one of the things\nthat i\nsort of one of my gripes i suppose\nsometimes with some of the\nself-development rhetoric\nis that it makes things sound so much\neasier than they\nare and it sort of it it trivializes\nwhat are\nreally difficult things you know most\npeople if they could just turn off their\ndepression or their anxiety\nif there was just a switch where they\ncould go they would do it\nyeah and and it's a terrible\nthing to feel so the fact that they are\nfeeling it must mean it's very difficult\nfor them\nto not feel that yeah and the same is\ntrue of a relationship\nif someone has stayed in an unhappy\nsituation for a long time\nthat must mean it is incredibly\ndifficult\nfor them internally to make peace with\nthe idea of leaving and and what's\nhappening of course is\nin this moment where it's evident to all\nof their friends and family that they\nshould leave\nand that they should never look back\ntheir abandonment issue that's been\naround their whole life\nis screaming at them yeah screaming\nusing any tactic it can to get\nthem to stay and when they were in the\nrelationship the way the tactic it used\nmaybe was\nto go into people-pleaser mode and\neven though this person's not treating\nme right i'm going to do anything i can\nto make them happy\nmake every compromise make every\nsacrifice bend over backwards\nsubjugate my own needs to try and serve\nyou\nall all in order so that i can\nkeep you yeah and then at a point where\nyou get so unhappy\nand you say oh my god this person's\nterrible i've had to\nlose myself in this relationship to make\nthem happy i'm gonna leave\njust to the point of leaving just as\nyour friends are like\nthank the lord they did it yeah they\nleft\nyou go home that night and that\nabandonment demon\nrealizes a different tactic has to be\nplayed\nso it says maybe they weren't so bad\nmaybe like we're asking for too much\nmaybe like you know they did have really\ngreat qualities didn't they i mean they\nwere\nthey were loyal and they're a lovely\nperson a lot of the time and they're\nthis and that and that\nthat voice starts using a different\ntactic with you\nbecause the only thing that voice wants\nis\ndon't be abandoned yeah and it'll do\nanything in its power\nto reach that goal it will ruin your\nlife\nto achieve that goal because it only has\none goal and the goal is don't\nis not make you happy the goal is make\nsure you're not abandoned\nyeah and and so this stuff is\nso difficult and it's why people\nshould that in those moments if anyone\nis listening to this and\nand if you're listening to this and\nyou're in an unhappy situation\ni get it i get how hard it is and\ntaking the time to really say one of the\nthings that can help\nis to say this\nthis demon would come out with another\nperson too\nso it's not really about this person to\nthat extent at least\ni can de-personalize this and go it's\nnot really about losing this person it's\njust about losing a person\nyeah and and oh\ni can carry this demon with me to the\nnext one and the next one and the next\none\nso but i i i think people\npeople should be compassionate to\nthemselves but\nif they're struggling to end something\ndifficult\nbut extend that compassion to your\nfuture self\nyeah because extend\ntruly extending your compassion to your\nfuture self\nis doing something that gives him or her\na shot\nat a happy and a peaceful life and if\nyou know that the all the evidence has\ntold you you ca\nit does not reside here then\ncompassion towards your future self is\nleaving even if your present self\nit's deeply painful that's so powerful\nman that's\nthat's amazing i'm so glad that you\nbrought it to that and\nyour reference to just how people could\nswitch it off that\ni remember when i read that statistic\nthe first time that we have 60 to 80 000\nthoughts per day\nbut 80 of them are repeated and that's\nthat was the one that really hit me and\ni was like yeah that's what's happening\nlike\nif someone's saying that to themselves\nwhat you just said about abandonment the\nidea of if someone keeps repeating to\nthemselves without even knowing\nsubconsciously don't be abandoned don't\nbe abandoned don't be abandoned don't be\nabandoned\nand that's just repeating over and over\nagain when you hear the advice of like\noh yeah you should be able to leave or\nwalk away of course it's hard because\nthat's\none thought amongst sixty thousand\nthoughts or whatever it is\nyeah and so it's it's it's a complete\nrewiring that needs to take place and\nit's not just about cutting the wire\nright like we're so\nwe're just oh yeah i'm just gonna cut\nthat thought out and it doesn't work\nlike that it's completely shifting it\naround and so\ni love what you just said that you know\ni'm so glad that you took this\nconversation there\nbecause without that actually it's not\neven possible to rewire\nbecause you're just trying to cut a wire\nthat can't be cut it's not possible to\ncut it and even if you\ncut it in the form of ending this\nrelationship the issue's still there and\nyou'll latch on to the first person you\nfind on the way out\nexactly exactly matthew we've talked\nabout so many things today uh\ni want to ask you is there anything that\ni haven't asked you to share before we\ndive into the final five is there\nsomething that's in your heart in your\nmind that's intuitively there for you\nthat\nyou feel like you need to share with\neveryone today before we dive into the\nfinal fight i suppose\num if i may yeah there's\ni've i've been working on something\nrecently that\ni know these subjects can as you said\nseem very abstract\neven when you talk about when we talk\nabout confidence\nit's a very hard thing to latch on to\nand figure out why okay i want to be\nmore confident i want to be confident\nenough to leave\nor i'm single but i want to be confident\nenough to approach that person\nit's a very hard thing to grab onto what\ndoes it mean to be more confident how do\ni actually do it\ni put together something that i said\nif in 30 days i wanted to\nif i had a gun to my head and it was you\nhave to improve someone's confidence\nin 30 days what would you do\ni said well maybe i'd create five\nchallenges that were specifically\nengineered around i love psychology of\nconfidence\nand my theory with this is if you can\ngive yourself\na genuine me not like\nyou know completely transform everything\nabout your confidence in 30 days because\nwe all know that\njust bs no one's the world is full of\nthese\nkind of hyperbolic promises but\nif people can i i believe that when you\ncan create like a crack\nin the doorway and that shows you what's\npossible\nthat momentum leads to something bigger\nand bigger and bigger i don't think\nsomeone starts by saying\ni know i can be a millionaire i think\nsomeone starts by saying\ni made two grand this month i bet i\ncould make two and a half next month\nand then making two and a half and go i\nthink i see your way to four\nyeah you know that to me is how belief\nis built it's incremental\nand so i said if i can get people a\n30-day\nsignificant incremental shift in their\nconfidence then whatever goals they have\nthis year\nthat will give them the momentum to\ncharge into those goals differently yeah\num so i put together a place where i've\ngot\nthere's an initial kickoff call that i'm\ndoing with everybody where i'm going to\ntake them through those five\ni love that challenges we're going to do\nthem go through them together\nas a blueprint for 30 days and then the\ntimer of the 30 days is going to start\nand everyone's goal as a community is to\ndo those five challenges over those 30\ndays\nthat's awesome literally engineered them\nbased on the psychology of what i've\nlearned about confidence over\n15 years um if i may\ni would say i'd love that where can\npeople sign up yeah it if you go to\nmhchallenge.com that's my initials\nmhchallenge.com\nthere's a place where people can sign up\nand they can join that challenge but we\nalready ran it once\nand it was the the results have been\nreally beautiful because everyone's\nwriting in\nyeah it just ticked off together i just\ndid this i just did this\nso it's been a very unifying thing for\npeople and we're about to\ndo it we're running it again now so\npeople can come and join our mh\nchallenge\ni love it everyone who's listening and\nwatching make sure you do sign up at\nmhchallenge.com i don't want you to miss\nout on that that sounds\nthat sounds awesome and it's so much\nmore fun doing it with other people and\nyeah taking it through these five\nchallenges and we know our life changes\nby\nby those practical things thousand\npercent yeah thousand percent like i've\ni've never changed without being i've\nalways said to everyone there's\nthree things coaching consistency and\ncommunity like those are the three\nthings if you want to\nchange any area of your life if you\ndon't have coaching you don't have\nconsistency and you don't have community\nyou're not going to change it yeah and\nso that's exactly what this is so\nmhchallenge.com is the place to sign up\neveryone and uh\nuh matthew i've got the final five for\nyou so these have to be answered in one\nword\nor one sentence maximum okay a sentence\ni don't know what the official\ndefinition is but i make it\nseven to ten words so

and you\ngo wow i want to i want to be as good a\nlistener as jay is right now\num and and to watch you you know we have\nmutual friends but to watch what you\nhave done over the last\nfew years is a is a truly\nextraordinary thing to to behold\ni know\nwhat kind of resourcefulness and\ninitiative\nand proactiveness it must have taken\nfor you to build this thing that you've\nbuilt which is\njust extraordinary and um\nyou know i i don't i'm sure you hear it\nmany many times a day but it is\nyou know from one creator to another i\nlook at it and it is\nit's something very special what you've\ndone so congratulations well thank you\nman i appreciate it it's very kind out\nuh really that means a lot to me and i\nfelt how genuine that was and uh\nwell i the reason why i was listening

make sense and so\nit was easy to listen to you and and i\nthink that's part of a relationship you\nwant to\nyou want to sit down with someone that\nthat makes it easy you enjoy the\nconversation yeah
