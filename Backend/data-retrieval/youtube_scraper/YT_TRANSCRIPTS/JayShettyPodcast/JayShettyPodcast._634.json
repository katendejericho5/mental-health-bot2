nice to see you and and\nalways so wonderful to\nto share and to talk with you it's it's\ni wish it was in person but hopefully\nnext time\nget to give you a big hug even your\nlovely lady\nwe'd love that we'd love that but no\nit's it's so good to be back with you\nand just\nyou know what what we're just talking\nabout naturally right now as well\ni think the world's had such a\ndifficult year everyone's had a\ndifficult 12 months\nno matter who you are everyone's had a\nchallenging time and you were just\nsaying that\nyou've almost just reunited with your\nfamily after two years i mean that must\nhave been such a\nemotional feeling like what was that\nlike to see your family after two years\nyou know it was beautiful and i think\nthat you know sometimes we take things\nfor granted\nright like and i think when you don't\nget to see your parents for almost two\nyears and the people you love the most\nand\nyou just realize how you know what a\ngift\nis every moment that you get to spend\nyou know that\nevery moment that we are alive every\nmoment that we are we get to spend with\nthe people that we love\nand that you just realize what a gift\nour family our loved ones and what what\nwhat a\nwhat a wonderful thing is to is to feel\nthe the warmth of the hug\nand a kiss and to be able to to be\nsurrounded by\nyou know by love and i think you know as\nhumans we are people who are meant to be\nliving in community we are meant to be\nyou know touching and holding and loving\nand i think\num you know that's essential for our\nwell-being for our mental health for\nfor our prayer life you know for us to\nso it was it was wonderful i i just i\njust have\nso much gratitude and and and just\nhaving\nto you know having this time with my\nparents is extra time because in brazil\nit's winter right now and\nbeing able to bring them here with me\nand have them with me for the next\ni'm actually gonna be with them for the\nnext two months i just\nfeel like the luckiest girl in the world\nyou know\nand uh so so i'm just gonna\nhug them until they're sick of it\nthey'll be like get away from me\ni'll be like i'm glad that we could give\nthem a bit of a break by you coming on\nthe podcast so\nthey were probably really happy exactly\nthey're like just get just get away from\nus for a second\nwe can't take you anywhere no it was\nit's it's it's wonderful and just to sit\nand talk with them you know it's like\ni think to to to honor them and to\nyou know how often do we get to have\ndeep conversations with our parents you\nknow and\nand to listen to their life stories i\nthink we're diving really deep into that\nand i think for my dad\nsomething came up where he felt the\nnecessity i think he realized how\nfragile like he was like oh it can\nhappen at any moment\nyou know something can happen and he\nfelt like he wants to write his story\nabout\nyou know he was telling me things about\nhis childhood and how he grew up and\nabout his father and about his\ngrandfather\nbecause you know we are also our\nancestors you know like the only reason\nwhy we are here is because of them so\nthere's pieces of them\nin us you know and and to and to learn\nabout those things that\nhe never you know there was never an\nopportunity or\nthat or never came up that he he had a\ndesire to talk about those things and\nnow he does\nso that was you know a gift that came\nfrom that you know because i think\nthere's always two sides to\neverything i think something is you know\nthere's always the yin and the yang you\nknow and and i feel\nthat that was the something that came\nvery strongly for my dad this deep\ndesire to share\nmore and and i'm grateful for that\nbecause i'm learning a lot more about\nhim and why he is the way he\nis and which in some ways is why i am\nthe way i am\nyou know and my mom because so it's\nit's amazing it's it's been kind of like\na wonderful\ndive into into you know\nin a way a deeper relationship with my\nparents so\ni'm grateful for that i love hearing\nthat i think you know i i often think\nthat my parents as well\nthey don't really tell me a lot about\ntheir childhood because they don't think\nit's that\ninteresting or important or they just\nsee it as normal and\nas i've gotten older i've realized that\nactually hearing about your parents and\nhow they grew up and\nwhat made them what they are is such an\nimportant activity and exercise in the\ndevelopment of\nthe children yes and and for their own\nhealing and development too so i'm so\nglad you raised that because\ni'm hoping that listings that people are\ngoing to ask their kids sorry ask their\nparents a lot more questions\nand kids are going to go up to their\nparents and say hey tell me about this\nor tell me about that\nyeah yeah i feel that it's definitely\nbeen\nlike a wonderful experience for me and\nand i think it also definitely makes me\nfeel like\nyou know the impact that we have in our\nchildren really without knowing like you\nknow them sitting here and looking back\nand saying like wow we wish we would\nhave done better\nand i think it's not about judging\nourselves but it's about\nyou know recognizing that we are all\nlearning because i think when you're a\nkid you look up to your parents and you\nfigure like\nthey know everything right and and they\ndon't they're trying to figure it out i\ngo to my kids often and i say\ni'm sorry you know sometimes i lose my\ntemper\nor i'm rushing about something or\ni'm not listening as with with with the\npresence\nthat that that i really want to at that\nmoment\nand then i you know and then i i judge\nmyself for that and i feel really bad\nand\nand and i think judging and you know you\nknow\nbeing it's not i think it's about\nlooking at it and saying how can i do\nbetter so i go to my children and i say\ni'm sorry you know it takes me a second\ni'm like i'm sorry mommy wasn't here\nfully when you needed me at that exactly\nexact moment but i'm here now and i'm\nsorry you know\nmommy's learning too this is the first\ntime i'm a mom\nand i'm i'm doing the best that i can\nbut\ni would i would love for you to help me\nto\nto point something out you know whenever\nthere's something that is\nthat you wish that mommy could do better\nor you or you see that\nthat you know like express your feelings\nto me tell me how you're feeling about\nthis because\nif you can tell me and we can have a\nconversation then we can work through it\nand i\nyou know i by no means i come in like\ni'm your mother and i said so so this is\nwhy you have to do this no i'm like\ni invite them to say you know hey you\nknow i i i'm doing my best and i'm\nlearning so\nso let's learn together you know let's\nlet's do this together\nand and i think it's been amazing\nbecause my kids talk to me\nwhich with my parents i didn't feel like\ni could you know\nspeak with them about anything i felt\nlike there was definitely more like it\nis because i said so when you do it as i\nyou know\nand i think with my children you know\ncoming from that and feeling like i\ndidn't really have a voice\nright um i want to give my kids a voice\nand and and you know of course there is\nthings like you're not going to jump\nfrom\nthe second story you know there's limits\nyou know we got boundaries here we got\nwe got to have healthy boundaries\nbut i think it's it's really important\nto to for me to listen to them and\nlisten to their feelings most\nimportantly because i think\nif we can teach them to open up and talk\nabout their emotions and talk about\ntheir feelings\nthe chances are they're going to grow up\nto be adults who are going to be able to\nreally connect to their feelings and\nunderstand that is\nthat is this beautiful rainbow of\nemotions\nand that's all part of it and it's all\nbeautiful and it's all just here to\ninform us something\nand to show us like oh why am i feeling\nlike this why is this trying to show me\nwhat is this emotion trying to show me\nnot to\nrepress the emotion but to look at it in\na nourishing way in a lovingly way\nand saying and look for going deeper\nwithin and asking why am i feeling that\nway right now\nand it's only right now right because at\nevery moment we are moving and we are\nchanging and we are flowing and that's\nwhat life is right\nyeah it's just a moment so yeah\ni love hearing that i love hearing that\ni i think it's\nso refreshing to hear it i think\neveryone right now\nneeds to hear it the most because we're\nall feeling so much and experiencing so\nmuch we've never\nwe've never probably felt this many as\nyou said\nemotions on the rainbow as we do now\nbecause\nit seems like all of our\nour internal conversation is just\nalive right like we're reflecting more\nwe're thinking more we're experiencing\nmore\nbecause we've been in this position and\ni i wonder for you one of the things\nthat you speak about very\nemotively and beautifully is your love\nfor the environment and even when we\nstarted our conversation today\nyou were like i'm close to the\nenvironment right now and i feel\nso like i could hear the birds and look\nat my cacao tree right now that's my\nliving room that's a cacao tree\nyou see that one in the back right there\ni love cacao\nyeah have you ever eaten a cacao the\nactual fruit\nthat's no heat of it oh no yeah he's\nlike\na white meat that comes from inside of\nit\nand it's very i mean it's delicious it's\nreally sweet and then from the meat you\ntake the seed and you can dehydrate it\nand put it in your smoothies or you know\nmake chocolate and cookies\nbut the actual fruit of it is this white\ngooey\nthat is around the seed and it's\ndelicious so it's right there\nso it makes me happy i mean that sounds\namazing i want some\nnow okay next time i i'll go see you\ni'll\nbring you some from over here for my\nplantations but\nbut yeah i mean i think nature i mean\nquite\nfrankly like i don't like i feel like we\nare nature i don't think we are separate\nfrom nature\ni i think um i think when\nwhen we forgot that we were nature is\nwhen we start creating all the problems\nthat we are living\ntoday i think when we we thought that we\nwere separate and more powerful\nhow we could control nature um or we\ncould just\nor the nature was here for us to use\nyou know it's it's i think when we\nwe got out of balance you know i think\nthis\nthis i think to be if we can go back to\nthis\nto this respect and this love and this\nand this\nfeeling of connection to nature we can\nthen\nreally find this connection and this\nfeeling of love for ourselves\nbecause i i think it's it's it's\nintertwined you know i think that uh\nnature is here\nuh as the highest frequency of a living\nbeing right nature\nit's our biggest teacher because she\njust\nshe's in balance if it wasn't for human\nactivity right she's perfect like\nthere's\nin nature everything works out exactly\nas it needs for all of life to thrive\nyou know for every\nliving being that that that is that\nwe're sharing this planet with and\nand and she's perfect in the way that\nshe knows you know\nand is when he must reign when he must\nit's just that you know\nwe as humans um i think unfortunately\ngreed and this desire for\ncontrol and to conquering you know it's\ni think it's i think hopefully we're\nshifting more\nto uh to a time of collaboration and\nand i think we need them more than ever\nnow you know of\ncoming together in unity and community\nand\nand and i think if we can do that um we\ncan\nreally live much happier lives that's\nwhat i think\ni think you're right i loved what you\nsaid there about how nature\nknows exactly what to do when\nand and it's all entertaining connected\nbecause\ni often think like everything in nature\nis serving\nlike everything everything in nature is\nalways giving like a trees giving shade\nand a\nfruits giving taste and a flowers giving\na scent and like\neverything in nature's giving giving\nserving serving\nand when you said about humans like it\nis true that humans are about getting\nand\nholding and keeping and yeah that greed\nthat you mentioned\nlike we're not in line with nature\nbecause we're not serving anymore\nuh when we're serving we're aligned with\nnature when do you\nhow do you think people who feel like\nnature's not really like\nthey feel disconnected from it or they\ndon't they don't really quite understand\nlike when you said we\nare nature how do you think someone\nexperiences that in a simple way like\nwhat's been\nwhat's been your way of helping people\nexperience and understand that\ni mean i think being present i mean for\nme\nit's it's it's just like everything\nright because since i was a little kid\nlike i grew up in a small village so\nbeing their feet in nature and and\nclimbing a tree to pick up a fruit or\nyou know just the sun rises every day\nand sets every day the opportunity to\njust witness it you know the beauty of\nit is amazing to\nto hear the birds sing it's just it's\nit's just\ni feel like it's it's always it's always\nhere reminding us be present\nbe here the wind in our face the you\nknow it's just\nfeeling the sun like you know even when\nit's freezing outside and it's snowing\noutside you can feel the sun in your\nface\nlike how is is like a warm kiss\nyou know it's it's it's all these\nelements everything it's here it's like\nthe grass on your feet feeling the earth\nthe coolness of it feel like how he\nsupports you feel like\ni don't know for me everything about\nnature is\nthe gift you know everything i mean\nevery moment i look at the food in my\nplate i'm like\nwow look at the variety of look at the\nvariety of\nfruits and flavors and colors and\ni mean you know like you know just in a\nsalad you can have like 10 different\ncolors of greens and\nthe oranges and carrots and beets and i\ndon't know it's like\nit's it's it's abundant you know that's\nthe thing i think we have to remember\nlike\nbecause you understand that we are\nco-creating our reality\nand and and we are basically like little\nradio frequencies right we are like\nantennas and the universe that doesn't\nunderstand better good\nis he understands frequency so if we are\nvibrating in this frequency of love of\ngratitude of connection\nwe just create we attract more of that\nin our life more of those things just\ncome into our life and then you're\nnoticing it\nyou can eat a plate of food just\nswallowing without like appreciating\nand and that's not going to bring a joy\nor you can eat it with like\ngratitude for every litter for the\nfarmer who made it\npossible to be here for the sun who\nnourishes for the\nfor the soil who nourishes it for the\nfor the bee who paul and i you know for\nall of this and then suddenly that\nthing that could be sewn so like when\ni'm eating a plate of food\nbecomes like i'm eating a plate of food\nlike\nhi it's just as a and then life becomes\nmagical you know\nit's just a it's just a perspective it's\njust a way of looking at\nlife in a state of awe and like wow like\nit's\nit is because that's what it is is\nabundant and\nif we can be in that state we're gonna\njust create them more in our lives\nand in the life around us is just how it\nis because\nas we become brighter everything becomes\nbrighter around us as we become more\nlove\nmore filled with love more filled with\ngratitude\nmore wonderful things happen in our life\nand more we can expand that and more\nin our families in our communities and i\nthink that's how\nwe transform the world you know i think\nit always starts with us and it starts\nwith us\nyou know having the moment to to\nto really look at at the gift\nthat life is and and and at every moment\nnature is on on on everything right\nis it's literally i mean it's everywhere\nno that is such a beautiful answer\nbecause\nactually just hearing you speak about it\nthat was infectious and contagious\nlike it was just you have to be around\nsomeone and\nyou when you were doing that you and my\nwife radhi when you talk about food in\nnature\nyou're literally this on the same\nfrequency because\nrather the other day we were driving and\nshe was like oh my god\noh my god i was like are you okay like\nwhat's wrong like i'm driving safe like\nwhat's going on she was like\nlook at the moon look at that yes you\nsee but to live in that is to live like\na child right\nyes because then you're like oh my god\nit's like\nand i love that about her like i see her\nvideos and when she's cooking and she's\nhe's so beautiful it's so like it is\njoyful because it is\ni mean how amazing is that we have food\nin our plate how amazing that\nwe have this this this abundance and\nthen i think nature\nis abundant really that's the natural\nstate of of nature\nand i think for us to as humans i think\nthat's where where we who we are\nif we are in balance if we are connected\nto our spiritual essence and not to all\nthese different things from outside\nbecause\nusually i don't know if you notice but\nlike if you watch bad news suddenly\nyou're having a great day then you watch\nthe bad news\nand then suddenly you're consumed with\nfear and then now like your state\nof of of your emotions and everything\nhas changed and now you're in the\ndumpsters and you're stuck there and\nyou're like you know\nso i feel is like you know one thing\nthat's very important is to like witness\nto to to see where your attention is\ngoing like where is your energy check in\nwith yourself am\ni am i vibrating in what frequency am i\nvibrating in fear am i vibrating in love\nmaybe put post-it notes in your house in\nyour mirror in your fridge\nsome places in your house just asking\nyourself this question\nand what it what frequency am i\nconnecting with right now and then\njust just to be be aware of that because\ni think the only people\nis like the way you shift the channel\nright you switch the channel in the\nradio station as you're driving and\nsuddenly you listen to an awesome song\nand then like\nsome like what's that you just it was\njust\nmy vibe you changed my vibe you switch\nthe channel\nand now you go back and you find a vibe\nyou want to be in right you're not going\nto sit there listening for two hours to\na song\nwhatever however long this song that is\nlike you're like oh this horror is\ngiving me a headache right\nyou're gonna change the station and\nyou're gonna tune into a new\nsong that vibrates with the frequency\nthat makes you feel good so you can be\nin your car singing you know and having\nfun\nso i think that's the same thing in our\nlife right we are\nexperiencing something at every moment\nthings are coming at us\nyou know situations you know we are\nexperiencing\na variety of emotions and feelings and\nsituations\nthroughout the day and i think if we can\ncheck in with\nwhere our frequency is and and decide\nthen consciously\nbeing present to understand where it's\ntaking us and if we want to be there\nthen that's okay but if we don't want to\nbe there\nto shift that and change you know that\num\nthat frequency so when did you discover\nmeditation as a tool is it something you\nalways had is it something that was new\nand and where did it develop because i\nknow you've meditated for a long long\ntime now and\nyou know we we spoke about that at\nlength last time and we connected over\nit\nbut please tell our audience like yeah\nwhere did it start and\nand what path have you taken with it\nwhat role does it play in your life\ni mean meditation is like one of those\ntools that i'm very grateful i have in\nmy toolbox you know we go through life\nand we go through different challenges\nand then we we acquire different tools\nto deal with whatever situation\nwe are going through at that moment and\ni think meditation was one of\nthe most precious tools i i acquired\nthroughout my\nmy journey here um you know over almost\n20 years ago in my early 20s you know i\nhad severe panic attacks and depression\nand\nand i didn't really know what was going\non with me because i looked at my life\nand i was like everything is perfect and\nand but i was feeling depressed and i\nand i\nyou know and and i developed a very\nintense anxiety for like over a year i\nwas dealing with it\nand and uh and meditation just came into\nmy life then and\nand not only meditation it was actually\nyoga at first\nand i started practicing yoga and then\nbecause i was having this depression and\nand um\nsevere panic attacks i share with the\nteacher i was going through she's like\nactually the best thing for you would be\nlet's start with pranayam\nto you know alternate nostril breathing\nmostly specifically\nto help you get back into your body\nand balance your left and your you know\nit's so good to like just get you\ncentered and and then we're gonna do\nsome meditation and then we're gonna do\nthe asanas which is the movement so my\nhour class was like\nabout 15 minutes of pranayam 15 minutes\nof meditation and 30 minutes of\nof uh you know the asanas and and that's\nhow i\nstarted my meditation practice um yeah\nalmost 20 years ago oh my god i can't\nbelieve\nlike lord wow yeah i know time flies\nand um and and since then it's been an\nincredible tool in my life because you\nknow i went to every doctor everything\nto to try to\nto believe i was going through but after\nabout two\nthree months of practicing daily you\nknow is it the commitment you make to\nyourself it's like\nnothing is going to happen if you do it\nonce in your life and you're like why it\ndidn't work\nright it's like it's like everything\nelse in life if you want to achieve\nsomething it takes focus it takes\ndedication it takes commitment\nright and and i committed myself to that\nbecause my other option was to feel\ni mean i didn't really have another\noption i felt like either i was gonna\ndie of a\nyou know or or um that was my\nthat was my my way my i chose life\ni chose to to to do something for myself\num every day that every day i felt\nbetter and a little better and a little\nbetter and then after that i to be\nhonest with you i cannot leave without\nit so i would say it's an essential part\nof my life\ni wake up um especially after becoming a\nmom you know where like your time is no\nlonger yours there's a part\ni say is like after you become a mom is\na rebirth because there's\na part of yourself that dies for this\nnew\nyou to to to be born because before it's\nall about you know what you want to do\nand you want to do it yeah sometimes you\nmake you know\nyou let your husband decide or but\nmostly you know you kind of do what you\nwhat you know what time you want to eat\nwhat time you're going to go to sleep\nand\nthen when you have kids it's like it's\nbecomes all about this\nlittle ball of love and and and you\ndon't sleep and you know so so it\nbecomes even more important i think to\ntake care of ourselves because how can\nyou give from a from an empty\nvessel right if your glass is empty uh\nhow are you gonna drink from it how is\nanyone gonna drink from it so\ni i just meditation you know i wake up\nat 4 4 30 in the morning\ni i meditate every day for 20 minutes\njust\nyou know it's just part of like feeling\nmy glass\nyou know start the day nourishing myself\nso then i can\ngive nourishment to my kids my dogs my\nhusband my family the world like\neveryone that\nthat i want to share my my love with you\nknow and\nbut i noticed that that it really gives\nme a lot of energy you know just to have\nthis practice\nof of meditation and then i do 30\nminutes of yoga usually asanas\nevery morning before the sun rises and\nthen i just sit\nin silence and i just look at the sun\nrising and then i just take in that\nenergy\nand i just you know one more day i get\nto be here\nand i think to start the day with that\nkind of\num intention and gratitude is like it\nchanges everything right because then\nyou already start the day and if\neveryone is like mom i want this mom i\nwant that the dog is\nscreaming the cat's fighting and like\nyou were like okay\nlike you know your your glasses also\nlike you can start emptying little by\nlittle and i think\nyeah it started at that you know like\nalmost 20 years ago but but\nyoga and pranayam and meditation they're\nstill tools that are very much a part of\nmy life\nand very essential i feel for my\nwell-being and for my\nfor my sanity to be honest with you for\nmy\nfor my uh they're just essential they're\njust tools that i'm never\nyou know i'm never giving back they're\nmine\ni i really i really use those tools a\nlot and i'm very grateful i have them so\nyeah well i think anyone who's done\nsomething for 20 years\nyeah is it proof that you know it's like\nyou don't let something last for 20\nyears if it's not\nreally improving your life i wonder i'm\nasking this\nas advice for when me and radhi have\nkids\nuh how do you introduce your kids to\nmeditation\ndo you do you wait because it feels like\nsometimes children feel forced into\nthese things and they feel like\nyou know it's not obviously creative for\nthem have you introduced them to it i\nwonder\nyou know it has been very natural it's\nnot is i agree with you 100\ni don't think it's something you're\nforced because i i think for anybody\nright if you force something to a child\nif you force something to an adult like\nyou don't want anyone forcing\nyou anything i think it's it's i think\nforce is never the way\ni think the example is always the way so\nfor example\nmy kids i have a picture is so funny of\nmy daughter when i was\nbecause i was practicing yoga obviously\nwith my kids when they were in the belly\nand when they were babies\ni have this funny picture my sister\nactually took it i was so happy she was\nthere\ni was doing you know i was just\npracticing meditation my little my\ndaughter came she was like\ncrawling she came into the same position\nas me i mean she was less than a year\nold\nso it's just how they witness or like\ni'm sitting in meditation just\nin silence and my kids will wake up and\ngo sit in my lap like they know because\nthey've seen this for\nall their life right and they don't say\nanything they just come and they sit or\nnext to me\nor on top of me and then they just stay\nthere sometimes they stay for five\nminutes ten minutes i don't know\nsometimes you know\nthey just kind of come on their own time\nand um\nand i think that's how has always been\nyou know\nor sometimes you know they see me like\ndoing my asanas and they come and they\nwant to do it with me\nthey usually don't stay around for a\nlong time you know they never complete\nthe the practice but they're always\nyou know not always but i would say a\nlot of times\nthere was exposed to it and they will\ncome and do it as they please like i\nsaid sometimes they will come and sit\nfor 10 minutes sometimes for one minute\nsometimes they will do three hours on us\nand they leave you know so it's it's\njust and then it's just part of their\nlife and then whenever they're ready and\nthey feel they want to do more then i'll\nbe\nvery happy to do it with them but it's\nbut it's not something that i\nyou know it's just something that is\naround their life and they're used to\nseeing and they\nwalk in and out of it let's say it that\nway yeah\nwell what i love is that recently uh\nyou're giving everyone the opportunity\nto meditate with you because you've\ncreated this\nbeautiful series with insight timer you\npartnered with the app to\ncreate these meditation sessions so now\nyou don't have to be your kid\nor or your husband to meditate with you\neveryone gets an opportunity to meditate\nwith you\nwhich is really special tell us a bit\nabout why you felt\nnow is the time for you to create some\nof these recordings and meditation so\nthat people can meditate along with you\nwhat was it about them tell us about\nthe themes and what you hope people are\ngoing to get out of them\nyou know i like i said you know\nmeditation has been\num really a a very very important tool\nin my life\nand has brought so much uh so much like\ni can't even explain you know has given\nmy life back in so many ways right\nfrom depression and anxiety to to having\nthis appreciation and this\nand just this life that i have today i\ndon't think it would have happened\nwithout\nthese tools and and i feel and i wanted\nto share that especially when\nyou know we were this is what we just\nexperienced this past year is\nis you know it's like i it's not\nsomething that\nnone of us were prepared for we can be\nprepared for is\nand you know unprecedent like we never\nexperienced something like this before\nand all i wanted so much was to was to\nshare some love and\nand to and to try my best to\nand what it is like you know i anything\nthat helps me i always want to share\nwith people that i love like you know i\nwant to share with my sisters i want to\nshare with my friends and\nand i feel like meditation it was such a\npowerful tutu\nthat transformed my life more than\nanything else and i felt\nhow can i share this with as many people\nas possible and i and i\nchose in the whole idea with inside\ntimers because it was\na free pla it was for free right so\neveryone could access it and i was like\nbut it was also a you know it was also a\nchallenge for me in some ways because i\nwas coming from this deep desire of how\ncan i share but i usually meditate in\nsilence right i just\nuse i have used inside timer for years\njust a bustle you know and then i\nusually\nlike to choose the monks the sound of\nmonks or the sounds of nature\nbut then i just use the timer and\neverybody had done\na guided meditations but then my friend\nsaid said gisele you know you always\nmeditate why don't you do that and they\nthis opportunity came up and i say well\ni'll try and then my first one was hope\nin times of uncertainty because that's\nexactly how i felt that we were living\ni said and i feel like hope is is the\nmost important is the spark of life that\ncan never die that's what\npushes us forward that's what keeps\nguiding us to\nto to create and to be the creative\nbeings that we are\nso hope is essential like so i the first\none was hope in times of uncertainty and\nit was just about\ni just started writing about how i felt\nabout hope you know and\nand what i wanted what i you know it was\njust about\nhow can i share this this feeling how\ncan i send my love out\nand and maybe this will make someone\nwho's feeling alone and who is not\nfeeling hopeful to feel\nlove and to feel hoping to feel\nconnected so it came from that place\nof wanting to share to to to to just\nhelp in any way that i could and i felt\nlike i couldn't see quite frankly any\nother way to\nto help so i thought maybe i'll try this\nand\nso so i did that meditation and then i\ndid one for children which was actually\nvery helpful to me because\nmy daughter she's going through this\nphase where she's afraid of the dark so\nshe never can sleep in her room alone\nshe shows up in my\nmy bed like four times a night to the\npoint that now she's my roommate she's\nsleeping in my bed because i'm like i\njust need to sleep\nbut i was actually i created the\nmeditation\num for kids and\nand when she's afraid like initially\nwhen she starts in her bed i put it for\nher\nand when i leave it she listens to the\nvoice and is very suiting\nso she falls asleep so he actually has\nbeen working for me because then i can\nleave the room and i can just put the\nmeditation\nand i go back like 10 minutes later and\nshe's like\nand she's sleeping right i mean she\nstill wakes up\nsometimes in the middle of the night but\nbut at least she falls asleep you know\ninstead of like two hours getting her to\nsleep\nbecame like 10 minutes so it was helpful\nso i\ni just i just kind of he was very\nintuitive you know whatever i felt like\noh i want to write about this or i feel\nlike at this moment it was just very\nlike it just\nkind of came up and then i thought i'll\ndo a meditation you know\nlike now my next one that i'm gonna do\nis gonna call\num i want to do one about stress and\nanxiety because i\nfeel like that's really present right\nnow in the collective i think that's a\nlot of people are going through a lot of\nyou know um a lot of a lot of stress in\nso many ways you know and and\nso my next one i already start writing\nit is going to be about\nyou know how my take on how i can i can\num\nhopefully alleviate that in some way\nthat's my intention at least i hope it\nit works so\nthat's beautiful i'm sure it will work i\nmean it sounds so wonderful\nand and i love hearing about it and you\nknow after this i'm going to go\nstraight on and listen in and i can't\nwait for the new one to come out as well\nthere's already\ni believe you've already recorded five\nup there and there's more coming out\nyeah there's already plenty of uh\nincredible recordings you've done and\nyeah i can't wait to listen to that one\nand\nyou know i know that you recently also\nhosted a um hour-long live stream\nabout starting a meditation routine and\none of the most amazing things i saw\nand that live stream was on insight time\nof the app and\ni when i i've had a meditation routine\nnow for probably around\nit's been about 16 years now that i've\nhad a meditation routine\nand it's been one of the biggest the\nbest commitments of my life\nand also last year i saw so many people\nstarting a meditation routine during\nthe pandemic to help them cope tell us a\nbit about\nhow you recommend it to people how to\nstart a\nmeditation routine and also i guess the\ngood thing is that your meditations on\ninsight timer can be a part of people's\nroutines as well they can\nlisten to them at the beginning of the\nday at the end of the day whenever they\nneed it so\nyeah tell us a bit about how to start a\nroutine for me\npersonally you know like i said like i\nlike to do my routine early in the\nmorning when i know i'm not going to be\ninterrupted\nwhen everyone is at sleep because i know\nfor sure there's going to be no dogs\nbarking no kids scream you know nothing\nis going to\ntake that that moment of silence because\ni think especially\nas you start silent to be in a silent\nspace\nit's it's it is helpful right meant to\nbe in a place\nso so um but but i love the inside timer\nand even the different types of\nmeditations i created like for example\nhope\nin times of uncertainty you can listen\nto any time but i did one that is\nreflections like\nbefore going to sleep so it was more\nfocusing on people they were having\nthey were tossing and turning in bed and\nthey were having a hard time sleeping\nthat was more focused for that and\nthen i did a morning meditation which\nwas more about\nyou know starting your day with the\nsense of like let's go get it right the\nstate of gratitude and presence and\nso each of them had a different focus\nbut inside timer doesn't have just the\nmeditations i created the great thing\nabout them they have\nso many different types of meditations\nfor people who\nenjoy having a guided meditation which i\ndo think is very helpful for someone who\nhas\nagreed the monkey mind you know i think\nwhen you are\nyou know you know a lot about the monkey\nline too right he's like we we all have\nit so i think\nwhen when you have the monkey mind all\nthe time and especially in the times you\nknow we are overload with\ninformation and this information right\nnow i think it's hard to shut off the\nmind so\ni would suggest finding a time during\nthe day\ni would suggest the same time every day\nlike everything in life right if you can\ncreate like a\ni'm big on schedules because i feel like\nwhen i have a schedule\nit's like this is what's happening at\nthis time at this time at this time i\nfeel like i can get a lot more in\nand i feel like it gets organized within\nthe schedule there is flexibility\nbut it's nice to kind of visualize and\nwrite it down and organize it okay at\nthis time\nis the best time because then you also\ngive yourself better chance of\nsucceeding right because you know like\nfor myself\ni know that the best time for me to be\nearly in the morning\nbecause that's in my life what works\nbest but i think every person\num has a different lifestyle so i think\nit's about really being honest with\nyourself and when you are writing down\nyour schedule of your day\nto figure it out what's the best time\nfor you and then i would suggest to do\nit at the same time\nevery day and i think um\nyou know if you can start with a guided\nmeditation and once you feel very\ncomfortable with that\num you can you know like i really enjoy\njust sounds of\nnature or you know just put a timer\nuh so you know that you know that for\nthe next\n10 15 20 30 minutes however much time\nyou you\nyou decide you're gonna do and i don't\nthink there's any right or wrong\nyou know how much time you do it i think\nthe longer you do it the more\nbenefits you will feel you know but i\nthink more important than the length\nis the consistency i would say yes yes\nbecause i say it's more about it's like\nyou brush your teeth every day right it\ndoesn't work if you brush\nyour teeth 10 times tomorrow but if you\ndidn't brush it for like 10 days i mean\nimagine the situation of your teeth\nso it's kind of like the same thing it's\nlike it's like if you don't sleep every\nnight you don't get to recharge\nand i think in the same way i see\nmeditation it's almost like\nthe same benefits that sleep gives to\nyour body which is allowing it to rest\nin your mind and to recharge\nmeditation best for your brain for your\nspirit it allows it to like\nrelease all that chatter and\nand and and i think that's what um the\nbet you know that's\nit's as important as sleeping it's as\nimportant as eating i mean to me\nit is and i feel like when you find you\nknow that's why i'm doing it for\nalmost 20 years and i think that\num if people commit to it they will\npretty soon find out\nthe same thing that you and i have found\nout about the power of meditation you\nknow\ni love that that's such great advice i\nlove what you said about consistency\nuh versus the idea of lent the idea of\ndoing it at the same time every day and\nfor anyone who's listening or watching\nand of course wants to go and listen to\nthose\nmeditations right now you can go and\ndownload insight timer and and take\nthe experience for yourself and i always\nsaid that to everyone you have to\nexperiment you have to try it out like\nyou won't know until you do it and for\npeople who've been meditating for many\nmany years\nit's because someone made us try it and\nexperiment with it and that's why\nit's become a part of our lives so\nyou've been so\ngenerous and kind with your time today\ni'm so glad we got to\nsteal you away from your family and\nand your children and everyone else but\nwe're gonna end with our final five\nwhich is our rapid fire\nfast five round so every question has to\nbe answered in one word\nor one sentence maximum that's it okay\none word in one sentence let me try that\nokay yes all right are you ready giza\nthis is your final five\nall right okay what is the best advice\nyou've ever received\ndon't take things personal ah that's\nreally good i like that\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\noh my god you blocked it out\ni probably blocked it out i don't know\nwhat's the worst advice i guess i didn't\nlisten to it\ni was like no i'm not gonna listen i'm\nnot gonna remember that's not worth it\ni love it question number three uh what\nis your current purpose how would you\ndefine your current purpose in life\nto be the best version of myself i love\nthat\nall right question number four what's\nsomething that you're trying to learn\nright now everything uh\nwhatever comes my way no i'm trying to\nlearn how to\nthe most impactful and fastest way to\nregenerate our planet\nyeah i love seeing you share about that\ni'm excited to see what you uncover\nuh fifth and final question if you could\ncreate one\nlaw that everyone in the world had to\nfollow what would it be\nwhen you give is when you receive i i\nwant to say like how can i say this the\nbest way it's like\nwhen we can give from like this place of\nour open heart right i know it's one\nword but it's hard to say that it's\ni guess in one word it's giving is\nreally receiving right it's like i think\nthe more like\nthe joy that comes from giving is the\ngift right\nit's the biggest gift so when we can\nthat was not one word well it's like one\nword no it doesn't need to be one word\nthat's right there was just one\none law if everyone had to do one law so\nyou were right that it doesn't have to\nbe one word one sentence fine\ndiscovering that the receiving isn't\ngiving right like\ndoes that make sense like i want to say\nlike giving is\nis the actual gift is when we can just\ngive from our hearts\nthe joy that comes from that it's the\nmost\nis the biggest gift we actually give\nourselves i feel\nit makes perfect sense it makes perfect\nsense and that would be\nthat would be an amazing amazing lore\ngiselle you've been so\nwonderful and gracious again with your\ntime and i literally your your energy is\ninfectious like through the screen\ni'm like it's so contagious i feel like\ni feel like there's no way i can't\nnot love the environment now there's no\nway that
