watching\ntoday this is one of those stories\nthat's going to make you dream again\nit's one of those stories that helps you\nrealize the value of hard work\nand the value of what it takes to really\nchase your dreams and i think both of\nyou embody that\nso so let's dive straight into it and i\nwant you to talk about the first thing\nis i want you to tell me about a funny\nmemory\nthat you two shared at film school when\nyou met in saint lucas\nwell you know saint lucas in brussels\nwas a very artistic school and he was\nactually full of white people and we're\nwe're moroccans and really yeah yeah\nyeah yeah\n100 and and you know\ni was very shy and not really sociable\nand i didn't talk a lot and i also\ndidn't know how to dress well\nso i was like in my corner and then came\nsomebody that was really loud\ni wasn't i wasn't that loud but yeah but\nit was it was like the fresh prince came\nin\nyou know fresh prince of brussels\n[Laughter]\ni was talking to everybody uh and uh and\ni was like\nwho's this loud guy yeah and but i was\nlike\ni only saw like white people i was like\nwhat what's\nwhat's going on and in the corner i saw\na deal and i was like\nis that a moroccan is that a maracas i\nwent to him and said yo\nyou moroccan and i said yeah\nand then we became brothers we formed\nthe gang right away then yeah\nthat's amazing how old were you guys\nthen i was 18 then yeah\nso it's been like 14 years yeah roughly\nof being friends\nexactly yeah that's a real friendship\nman it's amazing that\ndid you ever imagine then when you guys\nwere 18 you're at film school you both\nsee each other two moroccan like\ndid you ever imagine that you would make\nmovies together one day\nwell yeah i was i always thought i was\ngoing to be a\nlonely filmmaker yeah and i was i\nthought i was gonna be like a dictator\nmy my first movies i was like handling\nthe on camera my\ni did everything myself because i\ncouldn't like give it to somebody else\nso yeah you have your like your own\nvision like that you know\nbut but when we we became friends we\nwere helping each other out with movies\nand step by step we realized that we had\nthe same ideas the same\nvision also when we would read like a\nscript or or a story\nwe in our head i would explain to him\nhow i see it visually\nand how cut together with what kind of\nmusic and he said i got the same thing\nyeah it was like\nsuper freaky yeah it was i i it's it's\nreally phenomenal to have a feeling like\nthat like\nsee somebody's seeing the same thing\nyeah that's that's\nthat's like uh it's scary at first yeah\nscary you know first of all i was\nthinking\nwhat the [ __ ] you know like i i gotta i\nbeat this guy\nyeah in the beginning you're thinking\nlike is this person just agreeing with\neverything yeah\nlike that's amazing that's very rare by\nthe way i just wanted to say\nand i'm saying this for everyone\nwatching this is the first time that\nwe've ever done a double guest\nhistory yeah yeah this is historic for\nthe podcast\nand you've already raised the bar the\nchemistry here right now\nnow next time we have double guests it's\ngonna be hard work to beat you guys\nbut how did you what did you learn about\nyourselves and each other in in\ndeveloping that collaboration because i\nfeel like\nwhen you're 18 we have this childlike\ncollaboration of like oh we'd love to\nwork together it'll be cool\nbut now that you're actually doing it as\nadults and you've made multiple movies\ntogether\nyeah he said what have you learned about\ncollaboration and working together in\nthe process\nwell being uh collaborating because i\nwas like a dictator and i wanted\nand nobody can touch it i i learned to\nlike listen to all the ideas and and be\nopen and\nand absorb everything so but i was i was\nlike\ni everything yeah perfectionist and and\nhe learned me\nmostly of you have to let it go\nsometimes and let it lose as\ni'll be working for everyone on one\nthing and for me i was the country i was\nat that time really happy too fast like\nthat's good enough\nand he was like no man you got to like\npay attention to the details\nso his crazy perfectionism and my lazy\nnonchalance just let it happen that that\ncombination made it work like a very\ngood balance yeah\nyou know it's so good hearing that\nbecause i think there's so many people\nwho are listening and watching right now\nand they're either trying to do\neverything on their own or i know a lot\nof people who just say to me jay i need\nto be in a team like i need to work with\npeople around me and energy\nand it's fun to see how both of you\nactually thought you were independent\nyeah but you found your complimentary\nskills and and and that's really good to\nhear that\ni love hearing it yeah like yeah\nteamwork is like central in everything\nwe do\nit's it's actually the the most\nimportant thing if we start a project\nthen it's just like a family like a team\nyeah and bring the best out of everyone\nto bring the best yeah\nproject because when making movies it is\nlike you're in a in a football team\nbasically you\nwell the premier league is practically\nthe belgian league it is\nexactly exactly oh yeah i got to\ninterview hazard last year\nyeah you've got an amazing team but uh\nokay move away from football we'll get\nback to more serious stuff\nbut it's interesting i don't know if you\nuh read bob iger's book\nso in in bob iger's book he talks about\nhow like\nat one point steven spielberg quentin\ntarantino\ngeorge lucas they would all get together\nyeah and watch each other's movies\nand give each other feedback yeah like\nit's amazing to hear that like i mean do\nyou feel that now that you're in l.a and\nyou're spending more time here like\nwho do you guys go to for mentorship and\nfeedback and who are you learning from\nwell\nyou know obviously working with will and\nand you know\nthat's that's like for us that's like a\nmentor you know you grew up with him as\nan actor but also a great filmmaker with\nso many ideas\nand being with jerry brookheimer or you\nknow the iconic\nproducer one of the most famous\nproducers in the world so those people\nthat we work with\nthat was already like our first circle\nbut now that we're here there's so many\ndirectors that we'd love to meet that\nthat\nthat we don't be a big fan of of\nscorsese if we could meet him one day or\ntarantino or you know\nbut also newer generations you know\nsteven chazelle's hears us or barry\njenkins would love to be your boys\nso these we did that in belgium where\nthere's also a new generation of\nfilmmakers that are starting to break\nout also internationally in television\nand and we're all friends and we all\nwatching these other stuff and it's\ngreat to see that we're basically all\ncoming together in hollywood\nnow so on the belgium fronts you all we\nalready have that\nyeah okay this is awesome before before\nwe dive into the main part of what i\nwant to talk about today\ni want to hear the one thing that annoys\nyou the most about the other person\nand and the one thing that you love\nabout the other person\nwe start with the annoying annoying but\nthere's a lot of things yeah\nthere's a lot of things yeah yeah i know\nit's difficult to choose one but you\nknow i mean there's like a small thing\nyou know it's for some reason he always\nlike like slurps i\nmean like you know sucks on his food\neven when he's not a soup\nyeah and he always like like when he\neats\nit with his mouth open and that sound is\nso annoying it is like\nit's like there's only one sound and\nthere's a so that makes me nervous\nyeah that's really sorry that you say\nthat so you can't eat dinner together\nyeah no it's difficult i mean\nyou don't just you're in your zone we do\na headset and we don't talk to each\nother you know\nso that's what about love what do you\nguys love about each other well one of\nthe things that that could annoy me but\nactually\nis awesome is the fact that he's uh\nbesides the movie\nyou know where his perfectionist is\nreally like let live and let live\nreally like you know um\nhe's a good guy he's he's really chill\nhe's really sometimes you know i get\nworked out i'm\nstuff about the small thing i talk to\nhim and say yeah i'm so angry\nand he's like come on man just take it\neasy be grateful be chill\ndon't worry about it and i'm like i wish\ni was like you but it calms me down you\nknow and the fact that he's really\nvery calm and and and chill and serene\nwell the funny thing is i like when\nactually when you're mad\nbecause then you then then he has his\ndriving force that that\ntakes me gives me a lot of power to to\nto go and and\nthat mad or when you're mad you put it\nalways in in\nin work positive yeah analyze it in some\npositive thing\nin positive energy you know so so that's\nthat's why it's good that we have this\ndynamic thing because it's you know he's\nwhen i'm\nstressed out yeah he's like a defend\nmaster you know\nand and the energy booster yeah well no\nit's good you can tell that you guys are\ngreat friends man and and i want to dive\ninto it now we want to talk about\nserious filmmaking stuff because\nyou guys are incredible filmmakers\nyou're innovative\nyou know when when i saw bad boys for\nlife and i remember you sent me your\nbelgium movies too which i'd seen\nso when i when i watched them i was\nblown away by\nwhenever you see sequels being made now\nof movies\nit's always quite it gets harder and\nharder and harder yeah\nand usually the quality of the movie\ngoes lower and lower and lower and lower\nyeah\nand obviously i knew you guys before i\nwatched the movie and so my hope was\nthat you were going to bring something\namazing to it\nand you did like i think everyone who\nwatched it genuinely believed that\nthe storytelling was incredible the\nvideography was\nawesome like it was fresh it was new but\nit still kept the same like\nroots and grounding of what we all grew\nup watching bad boys but let's\nlet's tell me that journey and we'll do\nthe bad boys journey and then we'll go\nbackwards on\neverything you did in belgium tell me\nthe journey of\nyoutube being at film school together\nwatching things like fresh prince\ngrowing up and martin after school\nand then you get this call that changes\nyour life that brings you into this\nworld like tell us about that journey\nwell yeah for us when if you when you're\nin art school mostly they train you to\nmake a very author\ncinema which is good it's a good thing\nit's but it's mostly like art house\nmovies\nand movies that you go to film festivals\nand and stuff like that\nso hollywood is not really a good word\nthere hollywood's like no you're not in\nthe right school you know\nhollywood's not cool no it's not not\ncool at all you know and\nand we as you know we we we would\nsecretly say\nyou like you like action movies yeah\nyeah yeah\nyeah do you like jerry brookhaven movies\nyeah yeah if you're like bad boss yeah\nyeah yeah hey what if if one day if they\ndon't make it when when are they gonna\nmake a third bad boys movie that was\nwhat we were starting to say and\nat film school yeah yeah and year after\nyear we say if they don't make a bad\nboys movie we're gonna make that because\nback then we were 100 sure we're gonna\ndo\nfilm school and then we go we make one\nmove in belgium and right away we're in\nhollywood and we make bad boys three so\nthat was all the time\nthe thing that we would talk about is\nbad boys three specifically we were even\nsaying that we were like the bad boys of\ncinema back then\nlike we related so much to mike and\nmarcus yeah so yeah we were always here\nwell have a little bit of mikey me but\nalso marcus yeah\nit depends you know sometimes sometimes\ni'm mike yeah i'm mostly marcus like\nbut sometimes everyone want to be better\ni'm not\nbut everybody wants to be like mike yeah\nbut everybody's mostly marcus\nyeah but funny and sweet and warm and a\ngood guy\nbut tell us about that process then so\nyou've had this dream you're talking\nabout it you're thinking about which\nwhich\nwhen you first told me that yeah that\nblew my mind because i was just like\nit's so\ncool when you've talked about something\nand it's not like\nit's not like it's it's quite a rare\nthing to pull off yeah right it's like\nfirst of all they've got to be ready to\nmake another movie\nsecond of all you gotta be the guys who\nget picked tell us about the process of\nbeing\npicked chosen selected getting the\ngetting the job how did it work yeah\ni just wanted to uh tell another little\nstory\nso when when i was 12 years old i grew\nup i was like small and then i grew up\nreally tall and i became really skinny\nand at school i was like a nerd and\neverybody laughed with me\nso i was like a big nerd and after\nschool i always saw the fresh prince of\nbel air and the fresh prince of balleria\nstarted to think like\ni have to be like that guy you know i\nhave to be like open and\nand and just like so because of fresh\nprince i started to think like\num i can be of movie maker i can do this\ni can be cool\nbe cool and and yeah basically because\nhe was silly billy like\nyeah and will smith saved his life yeah\nbasically because of him i started to\nopen my mind to\nwhatever i can be whatever i want to\nyeah and\nto have to make a movie first hollywood\nmovie with will smith it's just like\nyeah bigger than life yeah and it\nbasically it all started when we met\neach other there was a book\nwhich was called black which was about\nuh gangs in brussels and it was a romeo\nand juliet story between a congolese\ngirl 15 year old girl that falls in love\nwith the moroccan guy from a rival gang\nand it was a very hard very shocking\nstory based on true events\nand and when we read that book right\naway we knew\nokay this is going to be our do the\nright thing our our la\nand our our you know mean streets this\nis this movie\nthis movie is going to be our ticket to\nhollywood no matter what but we were in\nthe first year of film school and we had\nflunk that first year\nwhen we read the book so it was like\nfour years ago as a student\nso we were like okay we need to make\nthis movie by any means necessary\num because this is gonna be the one\nthat's gonna bring us to hollywood and\neveryone's in hollywood we're gonna ask\nfor bad boys three so\nthat was like yeah the ticket that was a\nplan yeah it was really like that and\nand they were going they were already\nplanning to make a movie out of that so\nwe were thinking oh\nyeah in belgium game over we are still\nstudents so we're year after\nyear we started to make better short\nmovies and every short movie was\nbasically a sort of adaptation of that\nbook\nup until we start to win a lot of prizes\nwith a movie that was called brothers\nand then we got the opportunity out of\nnowhere to direct\nthe adaptation of that book black and\nthat's what we did then we did we did\nthis movie came out in 2015 and he blew\nup in toronto film festival it won a\nprize there and that's our out the doors\nof hollywood\nopened right away and the first producer\nto see the movie was\nby a chance of god jared brookheimer and\nwhen we thought\nit worked yeah this movie has been seen\nby him his eyes and then they said well\nsmith also watched your movies like the\neyeballs of williams\nis on our stuff and that's where we got\na meeting to meet\njerry brooke like one of the first\nmeetings in hollywood was at jerry bruce\noffice\nit was 2015 and that's and then they\nsaid what do you want to do guys\nbad boys three and that's it no it's not\navailable\nwhich is the same situation as with\nblack but we were like okay\nyou're gonna steal that project somehow\nand uh and year after year you know we\nwere\nalways like you know chasing it and\neventually the director\ngreat guy joe carnahan he dropped out of\nthe project\num and then bad boys all of a sudden in\nthe mailbox\nthe script of bad boys and like it's\nreal\nand the fact that you know when we were\nlike 19 it was\nwe we really wanted it but it was a\ndream and we never thought it was really\ngoing to happen\nbecause when you say yeah we're going to\nadapt that book and then that boot is\ngoing to go to hollywood and then will\nis going to see the movie and then\nyou're going to give us bad boys 3.\nwe say that as 19 year olds it's just\nyeah\nwe say a lot of stuff yeah we say a lot\nof stuff but when it really happens\nlike so at the point where we got bad\nboys for live description in our in our\nmailbox\nwe were preparing a belgian movie but or\nthe international\ntitle is gangster and we were like two\nweeks or three weeks from the shoot\nso jerry said are you available to make\nbad boys\nand then we said no no and we turned it\ndown\nand we turned it down i didn't know that\nit was the most difficult note ever\nbecause you were already signed up yeah\nyeah and like the whole crew was ready\nall the actors and it wasn't yeah and\nand i\ni could never imagine i could say no to\nyeah i never believe that we dream\nyeah like i can't believe we're going to\nsay no to bad boys for life\nto will smith to jeff brooke to martin\nlawrence and we did that and it was just\nthat's just life man it's just if it was\nnot written for us it was now written\nfor us and\neventually in 2018 he came back like hey\nwe're going to do it again and\nthen we said yeah yeah yeah now we're\navailable and that's\nthat's how it all happened so it's\namazing it was it was meant to be\nthat's incredible tell me about what it\nwas when you read the book black\nand you thought this needs to be a movie\nlike what was it about the story\nwhat was it that connected with both of\nyou that you felt\nso confident that that was gonna be your\nticket yeah\nin into the directing world well for us\nbecause we're from moroccan origin\nmoroccans in belgium it's sometimes\ntough you know there's there is\nracism there is poverty among the\nmoroccan community there's a lot of\nalso there's crime there is you know\nthere's a stigma so\nso there were no really public figure of\nor filmmakers or\nactors that were that looked like us you\nknow everybody was white basically and\nalso the movie world as well in the tv\nworld\nso that's why film school well the only\ntwos and you read that book\nand you just know okay there's never\nbeen a story told like that\nin belgium these stories aren't told and\ntell us a bit about the story\nyeah the story it it was you know it was\nabout this this\nthis african and arab community in those\npoor neighborhoods that we really know\nbecause it\nit's close to us it's close to our\nfriends to our families even even like\nat school when we made short movies it\nwas like\nin that world yeah so it was we were\nmaking all these little stories in that\nworld and\nthis book is yeah telling and actually\nyou heard about the real story of\nthis girl that that basically when a\ngirl is in a gang like that\nin belgium she's just an object you know\nshe she's forced to have sex with\neverybody of that gang and it's a very\nharsh hard reality that\nnobody really talked about and nobody\nwanted to see us that because\nall the victims are gang members even\nthough they're just 15 16 years old\nand we felt compelled to really tell\nthis story because\nit's a reality and and and they they're\nthese are victims they are also their\nstories are worth being\ntold to the world yeah it's and those\nstories were like\nit was in the newspaper just one line\nnobody talked about all that violence\nthat was happening in that world so\num it it is and because all these\nvictims are from that world and it's not\nlike\nthey don't care they don't care so\nhaving this story and telling this story\nfrom a black girl's\nperspective was just uh we felt like\nthis story has to be told\nand at the same time the casting there\nwas all the actors never played in a\nmovie before because\nin in acting schools or in the casting\nagencies you didn't have the diversity\nand and we needed to find them on the\nstreets and and there were some singers\nsome rappers\nthat eventually got the party and for\nthe first time they\nyou know people could go to the cinema\nand watch um the diversity on the screen\nreflected yeah i'm just going to explain\nmore about that\nprocess while i was at school i saw this\nmovie city of god and yeah\nyeah yeah and i saw like everything\nabout that moved\nmaking off and all these actors were\nfrom the favelas so\nit it i i had just this personal\nconnection with that movie because\nit was like uh you don't see the\nmoroccans or black on\non on on the tv screen so we were forced\nto\nyeah to find actors that or people that\nnever acted\nand this project this movie was exactly\nlike city of god we had to like search\non the streets\nand we knew there is such a big pool of\ntalent that nobody saw yeah\nso we did like three four months of six\nmonths of intensive casting on the\nstreet we went everywhere i came for\nevery actor i can tell you an amazing\nstory\nand and also nobody believe like really\nwe're gonna play in a movie because it's\nit's it's it seems something so\ninaccessible to them\nyeah and uh and yeah then we\nprofessionalized them they played in a\nmovie but\nthe thing is like for each role there\nwere like so many good\noptions yeah there was like over too\nmuch talent\nso it was really difficult to find the\nbest of the best so\nwhat we did at that point because after\nwe had all the actors there was so much\nother talent we said we have to start\nthis\nour own casting agency and put them\nuh you know giving them the opportunity\nto to do other\nyeah uh you know give the chance because\nyou know the thing is that\nthat these actors they never thought\nthey would play in a movie before well\nwill smith saw their performance and\nthen people like jennifer lawrence saw\ntheir performance and margot robbie and\nthey're big fans of them and\nwho can say that you know that the\nbiggest stars in the world\nwere in awe of their performance people\nthat were just on the streets never\nthinking that it would be part of\nof the movie industry and that that\ncaused like their new generation of of\nof dreamers basically now now you have\nthese guys\ngirls and guys in those neighborhoods of\ndifferent origins that believe that okay\nyou can be an actor or even a director\nor even a screenwriter that was very\nimportant to us\nanother filmmaker that was like a big\ninspiration that was spike lee\nyeah and he was like one of the first\nbig black\nuh directors and and he\nall these actors like denzel washington\nand and\nmorgan i uh uh or wesley snipes\neven even uh martin lawrence he brought\nthem to the big screen yeah\nand though when i was young i saw saw\nyou know\nspike lee was such an inspiration i was\nthinking like one day\nthat's how we basically started and then\nwith black we we had the opportunity\nto do that yeah there's so many\nbeautiful messages in your\nin your lives whether you guys see them\nor not like\nthere's so many beautiful ones like\nfirst of all just having a vision a\ndream a plan like it wasn't just like\noh we want to do this it's like you had\na plan you're like we're going to do\nthis and this is going to happen and\nthis\nyou know it's like you had a plan you'd\nenvisioned it and you'd seen it\nbecome true whether you believed it or\nnot at the time it was there and then\nthe fact that you're both so purposeful\nwhen i hear you talk about this\nit's not like a strategy or a technique\nor like trend it's like\nyou guys really care about telling these\nstories like yeah\nyou really believe in the fact that\nthere are these people with no voices\nthere are these people that are\nmarginalized and\nyou know not really understood and and\nyou genuinely believe that they deserve\na voice\nexactly and to hear you both do that so\npurposefully is amazing tell me about\nyou said there's loads\ntell me about just one of the stories of\none of the actors that just blows your\nmind or\none of the actresses that you worked\nwith that you just like\nthis person can't believe it because i\nknow what you're saying that if someone\ncame up to me on the street\nespecially in those streets yeah and\nsaid oh do you want to act in my movie\nyou just laugh at them yeah right yeah\nexactly and so so tell us about some of\nthose fast just one yeah\nyeah a couple of them well one of the\nstories like the leader of the black\ngang\num is his character's ex and when i i\nhad\na phase in my head you know every time i\nread something i\nsee a face and i was just you know\noutside of the\nthe place where we're doing the casting\ni was just smoking my cigarette outside\nand\nand i saw a guy pass with that face\nand i was like this is not true\nand he stopped and he looked at the\npaper casting black\nhe looked at it and he wanted to move on\nand i said wait stop\nis it come over here you can do a\ncasting right now he said no no i have\nto go to my work i have to like go in\nfive minutes i said\nno no just come inside just five minutes\nand then you can but i'm gonna be too\nlate i said come on\nso he went inside and he got one of the\nbiggest roles of the movie\nyeah and we were like searching for\nmonths and every time i saw the\nactors playing this character they were\nalways like yelling\nyelling it's a violent character yelling\nand he was the only one that like\nwas super quiet when he talked and it\nwas\nso dangerous and the thing is that the\ncharacter in the movie\nis like an ex-child soldiers because a\nlot of leaders in those gangs are exiled\nsoldiers and\nand our actor he was not a child soldier\nbut he lived\nthe civil war in burundi so so so the\nscenes that we\nshot with him was looking at at you know\ncivil wars\nuh footage on the tv screen he felt that\nhe he understood completely character he\nwas very close to the real character you\nknow so what a coincidence\nyes it was like a sign another story i\nwas just you know uh just in the center\nof brussels eating my my\nmy bread and and the world and this\nthere is this character who's like a\nwhite guy but he wants to be like a\nmoroccan you know street he wants to be\nlike\nhe's he wants to be the most moroccan of\nthe gang yeah but he's a white guy\nand i was just eating my my bread and we\nwere searching also months for\nfor that character and there was this\nguy next to me with his two friends and\nhe was like talking he was like\nlike the character and i said to him hey\num and he was talking about this girl on\nthe other side of the\nthe street and i said to him tried to\nget his uh\nher number he said no problem man i'm\ngoing to get a number\nhe went there tried to get his no i\ntried to get her number\nhe came back and i said you got her\nnumber he said no\nhe said but next time another girl i\nsaid okay you must be an actor yeah yeah\nand he got the part so it was it was\ncrazy to see these characters you know\nalive\nhere and they eventually played in the\nmovies and and also uh\nuh yeah the story is about this black\ngirl and and we were\nthe the the character that plays the the\nmain black girl she\nuh was the only one from the whole\ncasting that found her only way\nher way to us yeah we didn't search her\nshe came to us and she was a fan of the\nbook\na huge fan of the book and and it's\nbecause of that that she eventually went\nto the casting because she was such a\nyou know she loved the character ever\nsince you know she\nas a young girl read it and and always\nthought that one day there should be a\nmovie about that book\nand that's how she became the main\nactress of the movie and now she's you\nknow she's she's playing in other movies\nand\ni can tell you a story about each\ncharacter\nyour guys stories literally sound like\nmagic\nliterally because when you're like oh\nthis girl she loved this book and she\nwanted you know\nit it just it's so beautiful to hear it\nlike it really is like it sounds like\nyou listen to music speaking to you guys\ntalk about it because it's\nit's like it is just the imagination of\nwhat happens when you dream but tell me\ntell all of us about the days when it\ndidn't feel like magic\noh yeah well tell us about the days when\nlike you were starting out\nand and you once the magic like this\nthis magic wasn't there like there was\ntime when money was low\nor when the production budgets were too\nlow and you're sitting there i mean\nwe've talked about this you're sitting\nthere editing for hours and you're\nstressing out yeah tell us about like\nwhat kept you committed to your dreams\nwell it's\nwhen when yeah when there wasn't a\nfeeling of magic yeah the thing is that\nit's it's um\nyou got a lot of fear you know you got a\nlot of\nbecause there's no guarantee the dreams\nyou dream so big\nand it's so unbelievable it's like you\nnow you\nwhy would we be with will smith making a\nmovie\nwith martin lawrence i mean that's for\nspecial people it's for big stars you\nknow\nespecially with you don't have an\nexample of people like us from belgium\nat\nthis young age so there was no precedent\nto it and\nwe had no money and our family were\nreally poor\nand but my family was okay but you know\nwhen you start to study\nyeah you live on your own no money no\nmoney and my family was really poor and\nthey didn't have any money and\nand and movies is basically a job for\neither the super rich because you got\nmom and dad giving you know it's like\nfunding your hobby or for the super poor\nbecause you ain't gonna get any money\nfor years\nand and it's not something that you you\nyou cannot do that on the sides\nyou gotta do all the way go all the way\nfor movies if that's really your passion\nyour dream\nyeah you got to spend all your time in\nit which means that you don't spend your\ntime\nearning money and and and you know it\nwould\nthat was that but it was also the thing\nthat would make us survive it's like\nwhen you say\nit was our purpose you know it was\nreally the the thing okay\nwe're in a difficult situation it sucks\nwe're i'm i'm sleeping\nin at his place which is the place of\nhis parents\non somewhere you know in the attic you\nknow on a matches on the ground\nbut at least we are filmmakers and you\nknow that one day\nwe're gonna laugh about this we're gonna\nlaugh about this now it's a struggle\nand and it's that dream and that passion\nand and\nthat that makes you feel alive that\nkeeps you going no matter how hard the\nstruggle is and when we speak to young\npeople to students when they ask us yeah\nwhat's your advice\nour advice is always or we say you're\ngonna you're gonna fall flat\non your face and ground it's gonna hurt\nbut you got to get up\nand continue just just don't be\nsurprised when it's going to hurt it's\ngoing to hurt a lot\nbut all of that is going to make you\nstronger and\nand through all the struggles through\nall the you know the heartbreaks and the\npain and all of that\nthat's why when people say hey how does\nit feel now that you made bad boys and\nit's a success we always say we're\nrelieved\ni mean yeah you can think you're happy\nof course you're happy and you're really\nlike\nwe went we went it was a hell of a\nvariety it was dangerous like an action\nmovie you thought you were going to die\nyeah yeah and eventually you survived\nthat ride\nand and yeah you know making bad boys\nwas the hardest year of of our lives\nso it was maybe the worst year of my\nlife you know everybody's like oh it was\nsuch a\nfun movie it was probably also really\nfun to make it yeah\ni don't know i think i went deep man i\nwent really deep in in darkness in in\nsadness and and i would ask well hey\nwell you know it's like our dreams that\ncome true i didn't feel\nand you know it was going to be a\nnightmare sometime and he said it's\nalways like that\nit's a big change big achievements and\nit's going with a lot of pain it's gonna\nhurt\nand uh and you know it's well said that\nit's like you know you're on a mountain\nreally now fast and high and you cannot\nbreathe\nbecause you know there's not a lot of\noxygen and you're like\npanicking and the thing is you want to\ngo down quickly but he said no\nstay there you stay on that level and\nget used to it\nand starts to to breathe no panic and\nthen after a while you get used to it\nand and the pain and the heartbreak and\nthe doubts they go away because like oh\nyeah\nokay i'm getting used to it and people\naround you some people around you will\nbe on the same level and\nalso learn to adapt with you but some\nother\nwill like no no go down and pull you\ndown and they said no\nstay on that level that's that's what\nwill said to me when i was really\ndrained\ni've been crying for an hour on set and\nsay whatever's going through\nyour head it's going to be all right\nit helps having him motivate you and\nyeah it was like a godsend you know\nthere must be a sign something\nfrom the universe or god that from all\nthe stars you could work with\nit's him it's a motivational speaker\nwell\nhelping because he was sometimes you\nwould have lunch meetings and not talk\nabout the movie but he would talk about\nlife and how you know\nyou know how to heal yourself and and\nand as around that period that\nthat i got to know you you know a person\nvery dear to me\ntalked uh about you and and she said you\nknow you should listen to jay shetty and\nand i was like who's that guy and\nand like you know you just gotta do your\nown stuff don't listen to all that\nthat's things and and then i started to\nlisten to you and it was like\nlike medicine it was like whoa this what\nis that he's like it's\nit's as if where were you all my life\njay\ni needed you all my life and it opened\nup a whole world to me of the\nthe the healing and and and growing\nand the on the spiritual level you know\nbecause i always thought\nwhen i when i achieved something and\nsame for you you achieve something and\nthen you're going to be happy and then\nyou'll be going to be good\nlike oh yeah okay we're struggling we\nhave no money but one day we're gonna\nmake our first movie and then we're\ngonna be fulfilled and then it doesn't\nhappen we make our movie but you're not\nfulfilled then oh yeah we're gonna make\na better movie\nand then oh we're gonna go to hollywood\nand then we're gonna make bad boys and\nwhen you make bad boys for life with\nthose two stars and you're on the top of\nthe game and still you're not happy\nyou crash and then you know you gotta\nfind something else you're gonna find\nsomething deeper\nand listening to you it was it was so\nfunny that adil is like\nbefore you before bad boys he was like\ntotally not motivational he didn't like\nall the quotes he didn't like it all\nthose\nall those meanings he was like trash\nbecause i was like into it on instagram\nand i started to like getting to the\npodcast and i was like\nand all of a sudden i see a deal like\nlistening to you to you\nand i'm like you're listening to jc well\nfor me it was like when i started\nlistening to you it kept it a secret\nso when we met i didn't tell him because\nhe's gonna say i'm so crazy you know\nand then we saw the picture that that\nyou and i took on instagram\nyeah he said you know shitty you're a\nfan too\nit's like you can't\nyeah yeah and it's like it's crazy that\nwe talk about everything but you were\nour secrets\nthat is the best story about me\nthat's hilarious thanks for sharing that\nmy spirituality because uh we're muslims\nyeah yeah\nit's also been a strong force throughout\nour uh\nthroughout the pain and every time when\nyou when you don't make it\nyou just accept the fact that god has a\nhas a plan for you and\nand that's something that i always hold\non to like\nyou want to achieve that dream but\nimagine i did everything i can that's\nthe most important thing at the end of\nmy life i have to know\ni have to talk to myself and say you did\neverything for your dreams and if it\ndidn't work out it didn't work out it's\njust\nis this the way yeah yeah anything and\nif you believe in that\nyou accept everything you start to\naccept everything in god's hands or in\nthe universe\nyeah whatever spirituality you have it's\ni think it's important to\nyeah to have yeah that's true in the\njourney to your dream and you see that\nin so many incredible people's lives\ntheir\nfaith and belief in god or the universe\nwas such a\nimportant thing for them look at the\npeople that made the biggest changes in\nthe world yeah exactly they all had that\nyes\nand and so you can see how important it\nis for all of us\nyeah in the way because you both are\nchange makers like you're filmmakers but\nyou're change makers\nbecause you're trying to make films that\nchange people's lives you're not just\ntrying to\nmake films no like messages are so\nimportant tell us about so you talked\nabout the advice that will was giving\nyou which is beautiful to hear because i\nknow they're saying like well as\nwe're so philosophical we had that\nconversation that we were together at\nlike it was brilliant\nbut it's like tell us about the advice\nthat you had to give will in mind tell\nus about that process\nof when you're sitting with like you\nknow like you respect these guys like i\nhad to make that trailer with them right\nlike for me you weren't there that day i\nneeded your help like i was\nwhen i got the call to be on that\ntrailer so it was it was the production\ncompany that sony was working whatever\nthey're like we want you to be in this\ntrailer and we want you to come in\nand we want you to be a life coach or a\ntherapist for for will and\nmartin and it's kind of like couples\ntherapy and they were very respectful\nthey were like\nyou know like we don't want to make\ncoaching look bad or like are you and i\nwas like no this is great it's fun\nand you know i was like holding the\n[ __ ] this is amazing i'm so excited\nand and so i want to put that i won't\nput that scene in the movie\nand i was literally i was so nervous\nbecause you know i'm like\nand i've spent time with will before but\ni was like i was so nervous to like be\nin an\nacting setting with him i was like what\ndo i know man and so i went to acting\nclass for four days in a row yeah two\nhours\nyou did it really well by the way thank\nyou but i went every day to acting class\nbecause i was like i can't go in there\nand\nnot feel comfortable and confident yes\nexactly and it's just like i went in\nthere and i was like wow like this is\ngonna\nyou know it's it's when you've looked up\nthe same with me i grew up on fresh\nprince my favorite show of all time\ni've watched a million times every\nepisode so i feel everything you guys\nare saying\nhow hard is it to then go in there and\nthen have to give advice give feedback\ngive direction\nyeah as directors tell us about that\nwell it's you know\ni was seven years old when the first bad\nboys was made\nand now you got to 25 years later you're\nthere\nand you have will smith and martin\nlawrence who play these characters\nwho know everything who know the\nindustry 30 years in the biz and\n30 years that's our age and and then\nwe just do rats from belgium yeah we\ndon't know and then and then you're\ngonna have to say to will and martin\nlook you could do this better and they\ncould easily say\ni've been doing this for 30 years you\nknow and and they never did that they\nnever said that because\nunbelievable how humble they are yeah\nthey would ask\nus well and martin so how do you think\nis it good and i mean in the beginning\nlike\nyou're willing because we're not gonna\nyou know say anything but\nbut the thing is that they chose us they\nchose us to be their directors\nso they want you they want you to direct\nthem and yeah sometimes well\nyou know the first week will tested us\nhe tested us\nthere was something he didn't want to do\nhe didn't want to wear the badge you\nknow the cop badge on the chain\nfor some reason he didn't and every time\nhe had it for us it was super cool to\nhave the miami bed yeah you know\nbecause of the second movie you know\nthey have that and then you know every\ntime he had a good argument\na filmmaker's argument like a scene said\nno we're at the bar we're not on an\nintervention so no reason to do it so\nokay and now the senior said yeah we're\njust walking here\nwe're not in an intervention no reason\nto do it all right and there always\nthere was only one scene left\nif we don't have that it's never in the\nmovie and it was an intervention scene\nso we go to well and it was the first\nweek of shoot so well it was your bad\n[ __ ] on the chain\nand we said oh no no we're not gonna do\nthat because because\nbecause because what it's an\nintervention scene and then you say\nin front of the whole crew everybody is\na this is\nso unnatural this is so wrong on so many\nlevels\nand we're like and then you know\nheartbeat goes fast you know he's like\nwell he's\nhe's talking you know he's like agreeing\nwith you pretty angry\nand then this is wrong this is wrong and\nthen and then\nmartin can wear it martin i would wear\nthe battery well he can wear it then\nboth 45 minutes and after 45 minutes\nvisit you\nyou gotta wear the badge well it is a\nokay i will do it\nfor you only for you but know that it's\nwrong\nit's so wrong the whole crew was looking\nat us\ngoing to be directors yeah yeah and that\nand that process was the whole time\neven with the script if we had an id he\nwent like why and and like\nasking so many questions we had to like\nnormally we think till a certain point\nbut he pushes us to go all the way like\nwhy as a filmmaker's creative standpoint\ndo you want to do that and if you really\nas a creative you want to do that\nhe fights for you he falls on the sword\nfor your ideas so\nthat was really great wow that's awesome\nman that's great to hear and this is\nthis is what i love about this\nconversation that we're having is that\npeople see like\ngetting the movie seems like an\nachievement but actually the challenge\nstarts there yeah\nbecause you're now in the big league\nyou're now working with\npeople that you admire and on top of all\nof that\nyou've got to realize the fact that now\nyou're being judged\nfor real directing real filmmaking on a\nhigh level which\nseems like a high chance how did you\nguys prepare yourself\nto to learn how to be open to\nrecognizing that now the challenge\nstarts\nand still allow your creativity like you\nknow when you were doing black you had a\nlot of guerrilla filmmaking you were\ntrying a lot of\ntaking a lot of risks you're like how\ndid you let that energy stay or did you\nactually\nhave to change energy well whether we\nhad our\ncamera man uh robert have a great guy\nwho did all our student short movies and\nall our\nit's like still work with him yeah yeah\nyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it\nlooks like it looks\nalso a story yeah we basically we said\nto to sony\num okay we only have one requirement our\nour dop director of photography our\ncamera man\nit's it's rob is a guy who did all the\nbelgium movies without him we don't do\nthe movie and we were prepared to turn\nthe movie down\nif we didn't let you know he said we\nain't gonna do the movie without rob\nand all of a sudden this 15 year old\nlooking guy\nwho never made a big hollywood movie\nmakes a 100 million dollar movie with\nwith these great stars and that was you\nhave to imagine as a studio and jerry\nbrookheimer and you have\ntwo young guys who never made a like a\nbig hollywood movie\nour biggest budget is like 3 million and\nthis is like 100 million\nand then the cameraman is also somebody\nwho never did this like the the who's in\ncharge for all the image\nyeah the same guy like us and and but\nhaving\nhaving us three basically helped us in\nin eventually thinking\nit's the same as making a movie in\nbelgium because yeah the first couple of\nweeks\nyou don't breathe you don't sleep you're\nlike it's like dead or alive\nit's like it's also weird because it's\nlike a dream you don't\nit's weird to be on set of a big\nhollywood movie with like 250 people and\nbeing in a movie yourself yeah\nyeah like this iconic we always thought\nthis is like an episode of punk\nmichael bay's gonna come and say yeah\nyou know that's show actually guys i\nmean because\nit's like you don't fit you don't belong\nthere you know it's like you enter the\nmaking of or something and and but the\nthing is the eyes of the world\non this movie uh whereas when you do a\nbelgium movie it's only the eyes of some\nbelgians you know if\nyou tank nobody's gonna know but there\nif you crash you crash\nhard and there's there are so many fans\nin the world that grew up with that you\ndon't wanna i mean yeah\nand the thing is that it's like as if\nyou're okay you're in the war or you you\ngotta jump in the water and either\nyou're gonna like\nlike sink or you gotta swim even you\nthink i cannot swim all that ocean\nyou're gonna have to learn and do that\nand it's and and\nbefore you know when you do that that\nswitch um\nnot thinking too much actually not\nthinking not overthinking basically\nnot overthinking yeah but you guys broke\nthrough imposter syndrome because that's\nwhat so many people struggle with that\nwhen you finally made it yeah into what\nyou always wanted and now you're like\nwell maybe i'm not actually meant to be\nat this table like maybe we don't\ndeserve to be here like\nwhat makes us deserve to be here what\nmade you trust the process like what\nmade you feel like\nyou were like no actually we've worked\nfor this and we're going to deliver\nsomething because\nwhen you watch the movie i mean there\nare so many great parts in the movie\nwhere i'm like\nlike i love the part where you think\nit's a funeral but it's the wedding yeah\nright i love in the beginning where you\nthink it's a car chase but it ends up\nbeing that they run into the hospital\nyeah like to me like all those moments\nare genius and they're brilliant and\nthey're shot so well\nthat you completely are in and you think\nit's something and i'm like\nyou you definitely owned it yeah yeah\nyeah i owned it like there was no part\nof me if i didn't know you guys let's\nsay i didn't know you guys\nand i went and watched the movie i would\nnot have known that someone who'd never\nmade\na hundred million dollar budget movie\nmade it i would just never have known\nlike you wouldn't even think of it yeah\nright but but that's why i'm happy i\nknow you guys\nyeah because it just makes me believe\neven more that\nimposter syndrome is just a belief set\nexactly it's it's a thing you know i\nmean\nthe impostor syndrome would be just once\nin a while like we would look at each\nother\nand look at the dp and he said it's\nweird that we're here right\nyou look at the monitor you have will\nand martin and jerry's like whoa that's\nsome freaky dick and then it goes away\nright away because you got to work\nand the thing is that that you got to\npower through that but also it's it's\nthe crew and the cast is around you the\ntrust that you get from people\nthat become family and when you feel\nlike you're you're between friends and\nbetween family\nthat is what really helped us the most\ngoing through that imposter syndrome\nfeels feeling safe and feeling the trust\nand the love\nof everybody around you and and and\nthat's\nand that's the same thing for with you\nyou know we we were scared of coming to\nthe podcast because we listen we're big\nfans huge fans of your podcast we\nlistened to that and we're like\nwhoa how deep everybody's speaking how\nsmart and\nwe're like intellectual lightweights but\ntalking now with you\nis like we feel like you are broke yeah\nwe're family yeah we're family and\nthat's what helps us going that trust\nand\nlove and that caring and respect that\nhelps us you know just you know go with\nthe flow basically yeah\nyeah how many days i had doubts\ndoubts doubts like i was thinking i am\ntotally not good\nso many times but it's the people that\nsurround you is like a\nsuper important aspect in this in this\nprocess yeah and you guys are natural\nstorytellers like even when you're\ntelling me the story of the actors and\npeople behind\nhe's like you guys are brilliant like\nthat is you know it's\ni felt your energy when we met and when\ni wanted you on the podcast is because i\nwanted people to feel that just\nand i love how genuinely vulnerable you\nare about being excited about what\nyou're excited about yeah\nbecause i think what happens sometimes\nis sometimes people make it or go\nsomewhere\nand then they act like all cool about it\nyeah you know like oh yeah it's just you\nknow\nit's just meant to be no it's just that\ni remember like for me it was things\nlike\nfirst time i went on when i went on\nellen yeah like that for me was just\nlike\nflipping ellen like watch my interview\nand wanted to come on\nlike that's so cool like and it's like\nit's so fun to celebrate stuff\nyeah yeah because i feel like sometimes\nwe get scared of celebrating because we\nthink it makes us look less\nyeah yeah but actually it's just you're\nright we're just kids who just\nyeah living these incredible lives and i\nlove feeling like that\nyou know listen to the podcast with jada\nand it was like oh my god he's\ninterviewing jada and i'm like i don't\nthink we know jada yeah yeah\nit's that's the vibe that we have it's a\ngood it's i i like seeing it with you\nguys yeah and i want people to\nexperience that too that\nyou don't ever have to pretend to be\nsomeone you're not or\nyou never have to lose that excitement\nand that you know authenticity has\nalways been something very important to\nus and we did\neverything to keep the same authenticity\nin a hollywood movie because we could\nhave done\nmaybe any action movie but the thing\nabout bad boys is that these two\ncharacters\nit's us it's a we told with this movie a\nvery personal story what it means to be\nlike the right to get a diet together\nwhat i mean sometimes when\nyou know you're almost on the verge of a\nbreakup you know you don't want to do\nthe same thing you have another vision\nsometimes there were\nperiods where we didn't want to make\nmovies together like this is over ma'am\ni got another vision and\nand in the end it comes together and by\nreading that script of those two\ncharacters we felt like\nthis is us i think every every human\nbeing in the world\nsearches that same connection with\nsomebody that friendship that\nyou know that you know if times go up\nthat\nthat you have somebody yeah having your\nback and\nand that friendship that mike and marcus\nhas is\nis so universal and so beautiful and so\npersonal at the same time it's\nit's uh it's just a it's just it was a\nvery personal story this is a\n100 million dollar action movie what\nwere the other messages i i think that's\nimportant because you've already done\nyou've focused on making movies that\nhave messages\nbefore this yeah i felt when i was\nwatching there were a ton of messages\nlike the one you just shared\nwhat were other messages that you were\ntrying to that you know maybe\nwe never needed to watch it again and\nnotice that and what were some of the\nmessages that were big for both of you\nwell it was you know working with will\nis like the the the grower\ngrow or die message basically even\nthough i mean when you make\nall movies as a certain have a certain\nmessage and you don't want to like\nmessage you know it becomes cheesy but\nyou know it's like the underlying theme\nand it's\nif you want to have an arc where people\nevolve and this mike larry character he\nhas like he's\nat the start of the movie a certain way\nhe wants to\nremain strong and young and and and\nwants to remain the\nimage of mike larry yeah and forgets how\nto become just\nhimself yeah my the normal mic larry and\nseb\nin fact that he's growing he's growing\nis he's\nolder and he's any and it can be a\nweakness weakness\nis not just it's not actually really a\nweakness being able to show a weakness a\nvulnerability\nis a strength and that is something that\nhe learns and that is something that\nwe too when we were you know starting\nbecause when you're morocco you're very\nlike macho culture yeah\nyeah you're a man you know after if you\nkeep\nthis like in a kind of cocoon or fling\non that thing\nand you don't let it go basically you\nbreak yourself you crash\nand that is something that we learned\nyou know during the making of this movie\nwhere we all crashed\neventually it's like you know you gotta\nyou gotta\nlet it go and you gotta find you gotta\nfind ways to grow and to heal yourself\nand\nallow yourself to be vulnerable and and\nto be open and\nyou really you really changed yeah yeah\nyeah yeah he wasn't like that before but\nthat was bad boys really changed him\nyeah this experience at home as\na as a person he's so really yeah during\nthe\nyeah you guys really disrupted i feel\nlike you know just what you're just\nsaying right now like\nthat's what i noticed in the movie when\ni was watching it that you were able to\nshow the weakness of the character we\nall grew up\nadmiring or wanting to be like yeah yeah\nand and showing that it was actually\nbetter for him to be vulnerable to that\nyes\nrather than just continue to pretend and\ni i thought that was really\nit was bold as well it was a bold move\nyeah but it was also very culturally\nrelevant right now\nto show that in a man and being more\nvulnerable yeah\nvery relatable you know very reliable\nfor all of us and and i really feel you\nguys have disrupted the industry because\neven when i hear you say stuff like oh\nwe're not going to do this if it's not\nour dp\nyeah right like if you're not bringing\nyour crew with you yeah and\nand i'm excited to see and and i don't\nthink you guys are ever going to change\nbecause you're just\nwho you are like i'm excited to see how\nyou continue to\nrepresent diversity how you continue to\ntell stories of\npeople that are not told enough what\nkind of stories are exciting you right\nnow in general not just the ones you're\nmaking movies on but\nhave you heard any stories recently or\nread any books or anything like that\nthat you're like\ni'm fascinated by this right now there's\na lot of there's a lot of stories that\nare you know obviously now in this time\nin culture it's it's a great opportunity\nto to\nto tell stories of people of different\nethnicities different backgrounds\nstories that you didn't usually see that\nmuch you know on on the big screen and\nfor us because it's important we're\nwe're muslims we're arabs we're morocco\nafricans you know things like that are\nvery important to us\njust just as fans seeing that they're\nmore and more female filmmakers\nyou know this year it was a lot of of of\nwomen filmmakers and it's gonna be more\nand more in every kind of genre just\nseeing that evolution is so\nexciting and to be a part of that yeah\nto be just to be a part of this new\ngeneration of filmmakers that's so\ndiverse\nand and see parasite in the total not in\nenglish language that's when the authors\nhistory that's a milestone for\ncinematics\nyeah it sure just us we don't want to\nmake movies only in english we want to\ntell stories if it's in china we want to\nkeep it in\nchinese language or in germany it has to\nbe in german so the fact that yeah it's\nvery diverse and very exciting these\nkind of stories that's that's what we're\nlooking for now\nand uh yeah i mean we would love to make\nmovies back in belgium as well you know\nabout our community and and alternate\nthat with with uh american movies and\nand\nin a very naive way we believe that\nmovies can save the world\nyeah and i mean i'm with you yeah\nexactly\nfor us there are two reasons one reason\nis just as filmmakers when you are when\nwe did bad boys you have 250 people on\nthe crew\nand nowadays we all say there's people\ndon't agree anymore people are polarized\npolarizing all that\nbut we gotta say that when you make a\nmovie you got 250 very different people\nfor different backgrounds different\nethnicity different history\ndifferent political views your religion\nthey're all super different\non the paper they would say they never\nwill get along yeah they're like totally\nyeah\nthere would be war and on our movie\nthey're all together\nlike a family working for the same goal\nworking for one vision\nand we're all friends and then you see\nthat\neverybody's so different but everybody's\nworking together\nand it's not what you hear sometimes you\nknow that it's like you know everybody's\nlike\non their own no a movie set proves that\nwe are all\nable to go in the same direction for the\nsame goal and it's maybe very naive\nbut i just see it as a proof it happens\nthat's true and\nin theory there would be enemies but on\nour crew there are allies and friends\nand family and they care about each\nother\nand on the other hand movies is\nsomething very empathetic you know you\ncannot\nmake a movie or watch a movie if you\ndon't have empathy and empathy is\nsomething that you talk a lot about\nand it's just crazy that everybody in\nthe world\nno matter where you are where you are\nyou have empathy for this character that\nyou don't know it's a character you\ndon't know\nit not it may be also a fictitious\ncharacter a character from another\nplanet from another era\nand you feel for that character you fall\nin love maybe for that character you\nyou you hope that a character is gonna\nmake it you're gonna cry that character\ndies and that's\ncrazy that that proves that movies make\npeople human and and that empathy exists\nthrough movies so that's why in in this\nvery\nchildish way we we think movies save the\nworld no it's not childish man you guys\ni feel the same way the reason why i\nstarted doing podcasts or media or\nvideos and\nall of that was because i felt that\nmedia changes our vocabulary yeah\naround an issue around a theme like when\nyou were able to show a\na man's vulnerability like now it's like\noh wait a minute i think i'm my glory\nbut he's growing when he's doing that or\nmaybe i should do that right it's like\nwe mirror what we see in media all the\ntime\nyeah and i feel like media\nis always going to lead the way because\nmore people are going to watch movies\nthan read books more people are going to\nwatch movies than\nuh then uh come to a course or a\nworkshop or a seminar it's always going\nto be the same way\nand therefore i'm so happy that people\nlike you are making movies because i\nfeel like\nour faith is in good place you know we\nneed storytellers who want to tell those\nstories you want to\nhave deeper messages but in a smart and\nentertaining way and\nand i think you guys do it beautifully\nso we're going to do\nwhat we always do on the podcast as you\nknow it because you listen\nyes uh we've added another segment\nrecently which i don't think you would\nhave heard yet because it's in the new\nepisode it's called fill in the blanks\noh fill in the blank\nso i i read a sentence and you both have\nto fill in the rest of the sentence so\nwe'll\nwe'll go both of you whoever goes first\ni don't mind you decide who goes first\nokay being a director is similar to\nbeing a captain of a boat exactly and\nsometimes it can be the titanic\nokay oh exactly no you can't say that no\nyou're not\nbeing director is similar to is is uh is\nis pretending you know it\nokay good good answer a great movie\nstarts with a great title\nokay oh i would say i would say a killer\nopening scene\nokay good all right the best way to\nmanage actors\nis being a psychiatrist a lawyer a\npolitician\na diplomat all the skills that's gonna\nbe everything\nall right uh there is no film without\nempathy oh nice camera\nall right good all right working with a\npartner is\nlove writing together dying together\nnice i like you guys all right the one\nfilm\ni wish i made is star wars\nwell there's a lot but i would say but\nyou know star wars is such a\nsuch a big universe between us star wars\nis like\nthe greeks have their mythology we have\nstar wars just between\nit it became a religion even though i\ndid yeah yeah it came out of one mind\nyeah and yeah the whole universe it's\ncreated it's unbelievable\nit's infinite i would say jurassic park\nuh martin lawrence and will smith are\nboth\nbrothers for life for life nice\nwhen i first started directing i wish i\nknew that\nno matter how big the movie is going to\nbe that movie is not necessarily going\nto make you happy or bring your\nhappiness it's going to be something\nelse\nyeah beautiful and and no matter how big\nthe budget is\nthere is never enough money never enough\ntime\nnice that's good answers these are great\nthese are good my proudest moment has to\nbe\nlots but i think i think being able to\nto show the movie to my dad basically\nyou know\nto have him in he was sitting in the\ntheater next i know i know it's nice to\nmeet you yeah and he knew also\nhis wife is a big fan of you so you know\nyou're a secret fan you're secret fans\nof you but\nbeing able he's there you see the movie\nand he's the first\nmaybe also the first time he met will\nsmith because the very first single\ni got was miami by will smith and he met\nhim for the first time in miami oh wow\nmy proudest moment is\nthat i always kept going and\nkept going yeah that's right that\nthat it's the the movie is made it's\njust uh\namazing my proudest thing i love it man\nall right these are your final\nfive your fast five which you guys know\nabout so the first question i'm gonna\nask you is\nif someone gave you a 300 million\ndollars in funding what movie would you\nmake and who would you cast\n[Music]\na new star wars new universe\nnot based on any books it's just like\ngeorge lucas you come up with something\nnew and then you have nerds doing fan\nfiction and\nmaking warmth clothes and toys yeah yeah\nand it goes on generation to generation\nfrankenstein basically you know in the\nmovie world so that\ni love it that's a good answer okay uh\nlet's do this question\nwhat advice would you give to young\nfilmmakers\nout there you got to stay true to\nyourself and do something with your\nheart\nyeah because if you make something just\nfor the for your for the sake of it so\njust for the money\nyou okay you may earn a lot of money but\nyou're gonna lose\na year of of mindfulness of of your soul\nand all that so it's got to be something\ntrue to your soul\nyeah something that feels the soul and\nbe be prepared to\nhave a lot of pain just you're gonna\nfall a lot and be prepared to\ndon't be scared to make mistakes don't\nyeah because\nmaking mistakes that's when you learn i\nlove it it's good answers\nall right um question number three your\nfavorite movie and why\nmy favorite is jfk by oliver stone ah\nbecause it's uh yeah i was very young i\nwas nine years old when i saw that and\nit's a historical movie about something\nthat really happened\nabout conspiracy theories and it makes\nyou think and it's a movie that has an\nimpact um also in real life because you\nknow in 92 the congress had to release\nlike\ncheck out you know we didn't kill jfk\nokay if you cannot make a movie that has\nan impact in society in real life\nthat is really you know that's that's\nwhat we want to do so jfk yeah for me\nit's um\na french movie called la anne um and\nit's about uh yeah the the bonus ghetto\nin in\nin france uh in paris and um for me\nbecause i grew up with hollywood movies\nand this was the first time i saw a\nmovie with\nuh you know a moroccan or a black guy\nfrom\nlike the same world as me and i\nand it was shot in a way it was like\ncinema it was like\nin a hollywood way it was shot and then\ni understood that\nmaybe i can do that too maybe that made\nme made me believe that i could do\na movie and i think that's the most\nbeautiful thing you can do as a\nfilmmaker or any artist is\nif you can inspire somebody to do it\nthat's that's\nwhat lyon did for me awesome question\nnumber four out of five\nwhat's happening with beverly hills cop\nfour yeah\nadam sandler what's happening i saw the\nstory so\nwhen bad boys when we didn't get bad\nboys we got beverly hills club four so\nwe thought it was gonna be the movie\nwe're gonna make in 2016.\ndidn't happen then bad boys came and\nbecause bad boys worked out\nand now we got beverly hills cup four\nand we're working on it yeah\neddie murphy so the way we look at will\nsmith\nwill smith looks the same way at eddie\nmurphy\nit's the tom you know and making making\na movie with a legend like that with\nnext level\nand adam sandler he he's just the\ncoolest guy ever the sweetest guy\never and he said hey if we find\nsomething to work together let's do it\nyou know yeah\nwhat he did in uncut james was so\nunbelievable\nyeah and yeah he has so much to to offer\nyeah yeah i love it all right\nand final question all right so we can\nstop being in this sauna right now\ni love sauna but dr daniel amen who was\non before he told me that this is good\nfor our brains\nokay so yeah yeah that's why i'm using\nokay fifth and final question what is\nthe biggest lesson you've learned in the\nlast 12 months\nfor you it doesn't have to be\nprofessional whatever\noh yeah one well when i'm in a meeting\nor i have some a good idea somebody says\nsomething good\nor bad or i think it's good or bad i\ngotta say\nlet me think about it because\ni didn't do that enough and when you're\nin belgium with a small movie\nyour reaction or your decisions don't\nhave that much consequence as a 100\nmillion dollar movie\nand whether i was enthusiastic for\nsomething or i hated something\ni should have just said first let me\nthink about it\nbefore i say yeah oh no so that's what i\nlike\nlet me think about it for me it's um\nlet me say it it's sometimes i mean\nor in a meeting and i'm thinking\nsomething and i'm like\ni'm i i think i have to say this but i'm\nnot going to say it\nright and and that makes a big\ndifference because sometimes it's too\nlate and then you say\ni had to say it so don't regret say\ndon't be afraid\nyeah so i'm starting to learn that don't\nbe afraid of saying what you think\nand you know the worst meetings that we\nhad is because he didn't say it and i\ndidn't say let me think about it\ni love him i love it you guys
