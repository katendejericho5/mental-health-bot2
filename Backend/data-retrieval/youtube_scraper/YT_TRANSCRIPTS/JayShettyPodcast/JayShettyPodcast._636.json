    "transcript": "if you listen to most conversations it's\nobvious the person is not thinking or\nthey would never say what they're saying\nor if you stand back and observe their\nbehavior\nthey would never do what they were doing\nif they were thinking so i think you\nknow the greatest problem today is just\nrecognizing that we are being controlled\nby\nideas that are somebody else's ideas\nthey're certainly not ours\ni think it's our responsibility to\nrecognize that and break out of it\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that come back every\nweek to listen\nlearn and grow now one of my favorite\nthings i'm seeing at the moment\nis reading all of your incredible\nreviews on our podcast\nevery week thank you so much for leaving\nthem they make a big difference\nto our podcast now today's guest is\nsomeone that i've been excited to speak\nto\nfor a long time you may have heard his\nincredible videos on youtube\nyou may have even done some of his\namazing programs and whether you have or\nhaven't heard of him\ni'd love to tell you a bit about him\ntoday's guest is none other than bob\nproctor\nhe's the new york times best-selling\nauthor of you were born\nrich an internationally acclaimed\nspeaker and a motivational coach\nhe's devoted his entire life to helping\nothers reach their goals\nand realize their full potential bob\ncurrently offers\ncountless programs to transform\nindividual lives\nthrough the proctor gallagher institute\nwelcome to the show\nbob proctor bob thank you so much for\ndoing this my pleasure james glad to be\nhere\nabsolutely it's uh wonderful to finally\nbe with you i've watched your videos for\na long time and\nuh come across your work and as i was\nsaying that to you before you you said\nto me jay i've been around for a long\ntime\nuh i've always valued the insights and\nwisdom for people who've seen their been\nthere\nuh done a lot of things what's the\nbiggest lesson that you learned in the\nlast 12 months that maybe you haven't\nlearned\nin your life i think i'm becoming more\nfamiliar with\nthe importance of the internet over the\npast 12 months\ni i sometimes feel like i was guided jay\ni built a studio\nit's uh it's actually a small tv station\nnow i say that because i had a couple of\npeople from a tv station\nin the studio and i said it's sort of\nlike a tv station they said no bob it is\na tv station\nwe have multiple cameras here we have\nour own editing we can broadcast all\nover the world from here\nit's um it's very\nuh really well put together and i think\nthe thing i've learned over the past\nyear\nis that you have to learn how to\ncommunicate\num through different mediums\nor you're going to go out of business uh\nin our business anyway\nand we have been exceptionally well\nset up for this situation that we're all\nexperiencing in the world today you know\nand as a result we're able to reach a\nlot of people and help a lot of people\nand a lot of people need help today\nthere's a lot of mental nonsense going\non in\nin the minds of masses that\nthey've never faced before and so i\nthink\na lot of people need a lot of help and\nthat's what we're trying to provide\nwhat do you think's changed bob where\nsince when you first started supporting\nand helping people and now you continue\nto do your work so effectively\nhow have people's challenges evolved and\ndo you see it as being the root\ncause being the same or or have we\ndrastically changed in the pain we\nexperienced\nno i think the root cause is much the\nsame i think it's the programming is the\nparadigms\num culture is a paradigm\ncountries have paradigms companies have\nparadigms\nand of course individuals have paradigms\nand those paradigms are very deep-rooted\nand they really control us and the\nbizarre part of the whole thing is that\nwe didn't write the code\nfor the program that's controlling our\nlife someone else did\nand someone that was not very well read\nat all\nwe have a program in our subconscious\nmind\nand much the same as the programs in the\ncomputer\nand that program in our subconscious\nmind controls our behavior\nand for the most part in 90 some\n90 high percent of the cases the program\nwas written by people who are totally\nignorant\nas to what they were doing they had no\nidea what they were doing\nand that\nit's a very difficult thing to change\nyou don't just haul it out like you\nwould out of your computer it\nit really has to be altered and has to\nbe changed\nand it takes a respectable understanding\nto do that\ntakes a lot of discipline which is the\nprobable reason so few people do change\nvery much in their whole life\nyou know and it's rather sad because\nlike as i always believe we're god's\nhighest form of creation\nwe're all exactly the same i don't care\nwhere you're from or\nyou know how you think you're different\nwe're really not any different we're\nreally all the same\nthe mind operates first of all there's\nonly one mind i think that's where we\nshould probably\nlook and we're all an expression of that\nmind and i see mind as a\nmovement not a thing and we're an\nexpression of that movement\nso i think there's a tremendous\neducational job has to be done and the\neducational institutions that are set up\nin the world are not doing it\nand they've never done it properly\nit's created uh i think what they've\ndone is add to the\nthe problem that exists you know\ni was watching a video of you uh\none of the series you post on your\nyoutube channel is from the vault where\nyou shared these\nolder videos of you speaking many years\nback\nand and in one of them you were talking\nabout how when you were shared\nthis wisdom was shared with you that if\nyou didn't like the results\nyou had to change what you were doing\nand who you were\nand you said that that starts with\nself-study\nand what you were just speaking about\nright now you were just saying that the\ncode and the pattern that we're all\nfollowing\nwe didn't even program it ourselves how\ndoes someone start\nself-study because i feel like people\nare trying to read books and they're\nwatching videos and they're listening to\na podcast\nwhat is the real journey of starting\nself-study\ni think there's a lot of people trying\nto study this and they're going about it\nthe wrong way\ni think there's a lot of people writing\nbooks that really don't understand what\nthey're saying\nand their understanding is very shallow\ni think the secret to understanding how\nto really get to know ourself we have to\ngo to people that have demonstrated by\nresults they really know what they're\ntalking about\nlike i always say that 80 of the people\nthat are teaching have never done what\nthey're teaching\nand if you haven't done it i don't think\nyou really understand it\nso it's not what you know it's what do\nyou do\nand for years companies were paying\npeople\nbased on what they thought they knew it\nwas gone by a degree\nand the degree didn't indicate they knew\nanything at all\nand that they had gathered information\nbut i think we have to go by what they\ndo\ni was very fortunate when i started to\nstudy\nthe first man that helped me the first\nperson that helped me was a man\nand he's the one that introduced me\nto this book this i've got to help with\nan elastic now let's think and grow rich\nby napoleon hill\nand he knew what he was talking about\nand he said if you do exactly what i\ntell you you have anything you want well\ni didn't believe that\nbut i believed he believed it and he did\nand he did know what he was talking\nabout so i was\ni feel i was particularly fortunate\nin that i met someone like that\nand i think probably it was an\nunconscious thing in the beginning\nif i followed anyone from then on i\nlooked what they were doing before i\nstarted to listen to them\ni looked at their results before i\nstarted to pay attention to them\nand that has been sort of a\na guiding principle in my life\ni believe if you want to learn something\nyou have to go to someone that knows\nmore than you do\nand that's really what i've done\nand i've had five or six people that\ni've followed\nover the past 60 years it's been 60\nyears since i started to study this\nand uh i followed that principle and i\nthink it's a\nit was a good sound principle to follow\nyeah i think it's a brilliant principle\ni i can relate to it in my life\nuh mentors and coaches have been a\nincredible part of my life\nmy journey to becoming a monk for three\nyears as i lived as a monk\nuh mostly in india that decision was\nmade\non the basis that i met a monk who i\ncould see\nwas living by the principles that he was\nspeaking about yeah\nand and that's that's ex so i can relate\nvery strongly to what you're saying\nuh how does someone seek out\nthe teachers the coaches the mentors the\nbooks the guides that they really want\nin their life when you've read that book\nobviously\nmany people have read that book and many\npeople speak highly of that book\nbut there's a difference between knowing\nreading and then doing\nand knowing reading and applying how did\nyou read it in a way that you started to\napply what you were learning because you\ndidn't meet\nnapoleon hill but it still had a\nprofound impact on you\nsee here's the book\nit's falling apart\ni didn't read it i keep reading it\nit isn't something i read i'm reading it\ni read it every day now that was a\ncommitment that i made\non the 21st of october 1961\nray stanford said if you read that every\nday do what i tell you he said you have\nanything you want\nwell of course i didn't believe that and\ni said i would do it\nand i don't know why i did it because i\nnever did\nanything that i said i would do up to\nthat point my word wasn't worth anything\nif i said i'd do something well probably\ni wouldn't do it\nbut for this i don't know why and i i\nstarted and i've never stopped reading\nit\nand i think we're\nprogrammed the wrong way like i have a\ngreat library of books here in the\nstudio i have one in the house\num i learned a lesson from earl\nnightingale\ni have here\na book holder it holds a book open\non my desk and\nearl nightingale had one sitting on his\ndesk\nthe first time i met him it was in 1966\nand i spent an hour with and i asked him\ni said what is that on his desk he says\nwhat is what they said i pointed to\nplaces a book holder\nhold my book open and i said why\nwhy do you have it like that he says\nwell i\nhe smiled he said i'm i'm going to read\nthat until i\nunderstand it he said what the book no\nhe said that page\nand i questioned him i said what do you\nmean\nhe quoted something he said no amount of\nreading or memorizing it's going to make\nyou successful\nit's the understanding and application\nof wise thoughts that really count\nso he said i learned a long time ago\nthat\nif i kept reading the same thing\ni would start to understand and i would\nstart to apply it\ni immediately started to look for a book\nholder\nand and uh the secret is to read the\nsame thing over and over and over again\nthis is a page that was written\nprobably around 1920 it's by thomas\ntrowerd i don't know if you're familiar\nwith him\nand he was a great author it's the\ncreative process the individual\nstarts out it says an old saying that\norder is heaven's first law that's just\nif that's the only thing i read\nwhat does that really mean you know yeah\nand\nso i learned a long time ago that if you\nwant to\nlearn you've got to understand what it\nis you're\nreading and you've got to apply it\nand the proof is in the pudding is there\nare the results there\nand if the results aren't there then you\nreally haven't learned anything\nyou've got to change the results so it's\nby their fruit shall know him i think\njesus said that i could be wrong and i'm\nsomebody else might have said it\nand but that was good advice by their\nfruits you'll know them\nyou can tell by the results they're\ngetting\nwhether they know what they're talking\nabout\nand i think the trick is to keep reading\nit over and over and over\nrepetition is the first law of reading\nthat's how we became programmed\nit was repetition first of all we're\nprogrammed genetically\nlittle mom's dna dad dna came together\nand that formed the nucleus of us and\n280 days later then we made our debut in\nthe planet and\nthe programming then continued by the\nenvironment that we're surrounded by\nand if you take a look at the results\nyou know\nalmost all welfare recipients are third\nfourth fifth generation\nwelfare recipients and it continues\nuntil someone\nbreaks out of that which takes a fair\namount of\nstrength and understanding and\nprobably criticism yeah i'm so happy\nthat you've\nbrought up this really powerful point of\nrepetition because i think\nour programming is to always seek\nsomething new and to seek\nsomething fresh and to try something new\nbut the repetition i i remember and i\nsay this often that at one point in my\nlife\ni would listen to steve jobs stanford\ncommencement speech\nevery single day and i listen to it\nevery day for about nine\nmonths in a row where not only\ndid i know the words off by heart but\nthe words had a chance to actually\npenetrate through to my heart and i\ngenuinely believe that that changed\nso much of my programming because the\nwords in that speech are just\nabsolutely phenomenal and powerful\ncoming from someone\nwho had such a big influence and i\ncompletely agree with you that whether\nit's that reading a line and i love\nreading too\nbut in that case it was listening it was\nhearing someone say it repetitively\nevery single day and it just\nreally moved my life in such a powerful\nway so i'm so glad that you\nyou raised that point you know something\nyou just said is very important\nthe repetition you were saying listening\nand hearing listening and hearing of\ncourse are two different things\nwe uh hear with our ears we listen with\nour emotions\nthere's an enormous difference in the\ntwo we can be\nhearing all kinds of stuff but not\nlistening to it\na person can be talking to us we can\nhear them but not listen to them\nand the trick is to listen to something\nand it's through the repetition and the\nlistening and the listening\nthat would have impacted your life\ntremendously\nlistening to it that long yes thank you\nso much for\nclearing up that distinction i i think\nyou're spot on that\nthey are completely different things\nwhat's what's the programming bob do you\nfind today\nis the biggest block what's the paradigm\nthat's the biggest block\nin people's minds and lives today\nthat if someone's listening or watching\nright now that they should be aware of\nand start to work through first of all i\ndon't think many people understand what\na paradigm is\nand and um and then when they do\nunderstand what it is it takes them a\nrespectable amount of time to\ntry and understand what their own\nparadigm is\nand then how to change it like i'm\nfrequently asked\nhow do you recognize your paradigm well\nthe best way to recognize your paradigm\npossibly the only way\nis to really observe your own\nperformance\nyour own behavioral patterns um your own\nthought patterns\nhow you meet and greet how you treat\npeople and how you treat situations\nyou react or you respond to situations\nour behavior is controlled to\nan enormous degree by reparative our\nparadigm i see is a\na multitude of concepts that are fixed\nin our subconscious mind\nthat control almost all of our habitual\nbehavior\nand almost all of our behavior is\nhabitual so it's\nalmost all the person's behavior is\ncontrolled by their paradigm\nand if they start to pay attention to it\nand ask themselves why am i doing this\nwhy do you do this why do i do this\nwe're doing things that don't produce\nresults\nbut we keep doing them\nand sometimes they do produce results we\ndon't want\nbut we keep doing it\nand people have got to think\nyou know i listened to earl\nnightingale's recording the same as you\nlisten to steve jobs speech\nare you familiar with earl nightingale's\nstrangest secret record\nit's such a magnificence no not that\nspecifically\nit's 40 minutes the best philosophy that\nyou'll hear\nand right in the beginning he quotes\nalbert schweitzer being interviewed by a\nreporter in london\nand i asked what's wrong with man today\nand he thought about it for a while\nand he says man simply doesn't think\nand i believe that's true if you listen\nto most conversations\nit's obvious the person is not thinking\nor they would never say what they're\nsaying\nor if you stand back and observe their\nbehavior\nthey would never do what they were doing\nif they were thinking\nso i think you know the greatest problem\ntoday is just\nrecognizing that we are being controlled\nby\nideas that are somebody else's ideas\nthey're certainly not ours\nand um i think it's\nour responsibility to recognize that and\nbreak out of it\nsee i think i am a soul i don't think i\nhave a soul\nand i think the soul is perfect and that\nperfection's forever\nseeking expression with and through me\nand so it's essential that i recognize\nwhat i'm doing and\nattempt to improve my own performance my\nown behavior and\nmy own awareness because awareness is\nall there is\nand i believe your purpose in life and\nmy purpose is the same as god's purpose\nit's become\naware of why we're here\nand we're forever seeking a greater\nawareness and of course as we develop it\nwe show it in our results like i always\nsay a person doesn't earn a hundred\nthousand dollars a year because they\nwant a hundred a year\nthey're earning a hundred a year because\nthey're not aware of how to earn a\nhundred a month\npeople are not alone and lonely because\nthey want to be alone and lonely\nthey're alone and lonely because they're\nnot aware of how to develop meaningful\nrelationships\npeople don't live in sick bodies because\nthey enjoy it they live in sick bodies\nbecause they're not aware of\nhow to maintain health in their body\nso awareness is really the key\nand the paradigm is blocking that\ni think the the paradigm blocks our\ngrowth and our\nlevel of awareness we learn the wrong\nthing like we're taught you know read\nthe book put it away get the next book\nread that book put it away\nand they asked you questions you know\nwhat yeah he knows it you know in the\nnext quest\nthey don't know anything they read all\nthese books\nbut their behavior would indicate\nthey've never read anything no i i i\ncouldn't agree with you more\ni think using your language of paradigm\nwhen when i started to\nunderstand the habits and the\nconditionings\nthat i had and still have as you said\nit's an ongoing process you always\nbecome more and more\naware of what's blocking the full\nexpression of the soul\nbecause the soul's trying to express\nitself but it's covered over by\nall of these other conditionings and\nparadigms viruses\nsorry viruses yeah viruses yeah exactly\nthat you can't really access the true\npower of the soul\nor the true presence of the soul because\nyou're covered over in the\nin the tradition that i studied living\nas a monk it was always described as\nuh a mirror with lots of dust on it so\nwhen you try to clean the mirror of the\ndust the dust first comes in your face\nand it irritates you because it's like\nthat virus you just mentioned\nhow do we keep how do we keep positive\nand motivated in the journey\nof cleansing our paradigms towards our\nsoul\nhow do you keep a sustained level of\nenthusiasm\nin this journey that actually requires\nquite a lot of profound internal work\ni think you were said the right word\nthere in enthusiasm\ni think people are looking for\nexcitement yeah yeah very well\nand there's quite a big difference\nabsolutely\ni've always pointed out when you see a\nperson that gets excited when something\ngood happens you're going to see\nsomebody gets depressed when something\nbad happens\nand there's a great lesson in that\nbut rather than getting excited we\nshould get enthused\nwe want to look where enthusiasm come\nfrom it comes from\nin theos which is in spirit and\neverything just is and if we can look at\nit it just\nis it's neither good nor bad it just is\nwe're not going to get excited we'll get\nenthused\nand if we look at the negative it just\nis\nit's not going to depress us because it\njust is\nso i think the trick there is to\nunderstand the difference between\nenthusiasm and excitement and\nhow do you maintain the enthusiasm i\nthink the\nonly way to maintain it is to\ncontinually study who you are\nnever stop studying and now\ni don't think you just sit and study do\nnothing else\nyou have to study you have to study\nunderstand and you have to apply it\nso it all comes out in results\nnow i have found a great way to measure\nresults\nis in money you can measure it to the\npenny\npeople say happiness or health you can't\nmeasure a person's happiness\nand you cannot measure their health you\ncan go and you can have a checkup and\nthey'll say\nguy's in perfect health he walks out of\nthe doctor's office a bag he drops dead\nhe wasn't in perfect health at all it\nappeared he was\nand but in earning money you provide\nservice\nbut you got to control the money you\ndon't let the money control you\nand then if you fall in love with the\nidea of providing service and it's in a\nprofit-making way\nyou can earn a lot of money well then\nyou can put that money to work to do\ngreat things with\nand that's sort of the path i'm on\nand uh like my partner and i we build\nschools over in africa\nand we do them through cynthia kersey\nout there in los\nangeles which is the unstoppable\nfoundation\nand um we take a lot of joy in that\nwe have people from the company go over\nand see the work that we're doing\nyou know that they're contributing to so\ni think you\num you've got to keep checking your\nresults and you have to keep\nraising your own level of awareness and\nthe only way to do that is to\ncontinually study\nand but control your life don't let life\ncontrol you\nso you're living from the inside out\nwhich sounds very esoteric or\nphilosophical\nbut it's the only way i can explain it\nbecause that's really what you're doing\nsee when you talk about money bob uh you\nknow i feel aligned with that too\nthe idea of i i grew up in a mindset of\nwhere\ni often thought that you know money was\nthe root of all evil or that money meant\nsomeone had to do something negative to\nget it or you always had just enough to\nsurvive\nand i i find that we still see that\nparadigm\nexisting in society but see when you\ntalk about money and even when i learned\nwith the monks where we really\nunderstood the value of money\nyou see it as a as an energy source of\nservice you see it's\nwhat it is yeah exactly you see it as an\nenergy source of service of helping of\ngiving of providing\ntell us about that mental shift that's\nmade\nbecause i feel that you're obviously a\nteacher in the law\nof attraction and and you know\npopularized and shared that concept\nhow about when what are some of the\nmyths with the law of attraction when it\ncomes to money\nbecause i find that there are a lot of\nmisuses or misapplications of the law of\nattraction\nwhen it comes to money oh listen when it\ncomes to law of attraction\nit's almost synonymous with ignorance\nhardly hardly anybody understands the\nlaw of attraction\nthe uh the secret of course\nyou know really blew up the law of\nattraction\nin a big way caused a lot of people to\nthink about it but we didn't explain it\nproperly on that movie\ndidn't get into it in depth and most\npeople don't know how to get into it in\ndepth\nattraction um is not a\nit's a secondary law it isn't a primary\nlaw\nthe primary law is the law of vibration\nand the law of vibration decrees that\neverything moves nothing rests\nwe live in a notion of motion\ncirculation being one of the first laws\nin the universe\nwhen stuff when circulation stops death\nsets in\nwell we operate\non a frequency you do i do and what\nwe're really attempting to do\nis raise the frequency that we're\noperating on we want to operate on a\nhigher frequency all the time\nbecause that's where the real beauty of\nlife is\nwell this thing we're living in is a\nmolecular structure in a very high speed\nof vibration\nand the brain is an electronic switching\nstation that alters the vibration we're\nin\nwell we operate on a frequency and the\nonly thing we can attract\nto us is that which is in resonance with\nus\nso the reaction is actually attraction\nit's like emerson said the law of cause\nand effect was the law of laws\naction reaction is the law of cause and\neffect\nwell our thoughts feelings and actions\nwe send off\ninto the universe it's a vibration the\nuniverse\nsends it back it responds in like manner\nwell the response of the universe is the\nattraction\nyou can only attract to you what\nvibrates in harmony with you\nso if we see things coming into our life\nthat we don't like\nlet's understand what we don't like is\nin harmony with something inside\nso we better try and understand what it\nwas or what it is\nand then get rid of it\nattraction's a secondary law and\nwe've got to understand it is very real\nand you only attract to you what you're\nin harmony with\nwhen you want something that's on a\nhigher frequency you've got to operate\non that higher frequency\nbecause all the thoughts and things that\nyou require are on that higher frequency\nmost people i say are living on an am\nfrequency trying to listen to fm music\nit doesn't work how do you know\nwhat vibration or frequency level you're\noperating at\nbecause people often judge their\npeople judge their performance by their\nproductivity\nby their efficiency we're not trained as\nyou said with your paradigm again going\nback to that\nwe're not trained to observe our\nfrequency and vibration and people are\nnot sure so if someone's listening and\nwatching us\ntoday how do they know what their\nvibration or their frequency is how do\nthey diagnose that\nwell i think the only way to do it is by\nthe results you're getting\nit'll tell you right make sense\nsee the results do tell the truth they\ndon't lie\nspirit manifests through its polar\nopposite always\nwe're spiritual beings spirit flows to\nand through us\nand we'll do anything for us whatever we\nask it'll give us\nand we're asking in thought so what we\nwant to do is take a look\nwhat have i been thinking take a look at\nyour results you'll know what you're\nthinking\nthat's how you can tell the frequency\naround you want to start\nfrequencies vibration vibrations feeling\nwhen you say i feel bad what you're\nreally saying is i'm not in a very good\nvibration\nyou say i feel particularly good you're\nsaying i'm in a pretty good vibration\nconscious awareness of vibration is\nreferred to as feeling\nso i think the way to really understand\nthe frequency and the vibrations you're\noperating on is by the results you're\ngetting\nyeah if you're continually having\nproblems in all areas of your life\nyou're on the wrong you're in the wrong\nvibration\nyou know very low level of vibration\nand we can change it now i teach that in\nthe seminars i have\nways of illustrating everything and\nit's important and as people get into it\nthey really like it see i think when you\nhear the truth you'll know it\nand i came across i don't know\nit came to me i guess i was searching\nfor a way how to explain that\nwhen you hear the truth you'll know it\nwell there's music in this room right\nnow there's music in your room you may\nnot hear it but we know it's here\nit's being broadcast it's in the room\nand we don't hear it because our ears\nare not operating on the frequency the\nmusic is being broadcast on\nbut if we turned on a radio the radio\npicks up on that frequency\nspeeds it up as a zippo way up onto a\nhigher frequency and we can hear it\nwell it's the receiver on the radio that\npicks it up\nsends it off on a higher level where you\nhear it when you hear the truth the\ntruth resonates with the essence of who\nyou are\nand when it resonates it sets up that\nvibration\nit comes out on the conscious level as\nknowing it is no\nyou just know that's right yeah when you\nhear the truth you'll know i know it\nthat's true well that's true when you're\nreading something\nwhen a person says something to you you\nhear it you just\ni know that's not true\ni know that is true it resonates with\nthe essence so we there is perfection\nour spiritual dna is perfect\nand when we hear the truth it's like\nthat's the receiver\nand it clicks in you know\nyeah we're pretty fascinating\nexpressions of life you and i and\neverybody else\ni mean the beautiful part is like i've\nstudied this\nlike a scientist probably\nmore serious as the time goes on but\nfor 60 years starting on the 21st of\nthis past\noctober this is my 60th year and i study\nthis every day\ni mean this is i'm obsessed with this\nand at one time that bothered me\nit doesn't and so\ni i just don't stop studying it and it's\nso beautiful\nbring that that other thing up instead\nof bothering me\ni used to think you hear things and you\nthink the positives they're negative i\nhear obsession i thought that was\nnegative\nsomebody told me i was obsessed with\nsomething or i thought i was obsessed\nbut then i got a hold of lloyd c\ndouglas's book\nthe magnificent obsession and i i\nthought\nhow could it be negative it's\nmagnificent you know\nyeah so i got the dictionary out and i\nlooked the word up\ni don't know why i hadn't done it before\nthat and it says\nan obsession is the persistent\ndisturbing preoccupation\nwith an often unreasonable idea\nit's a magnificent definition\nand i'm obsessed with a beautiful\nconcept\nwho am i that's that's the obsession\nyou know yeah it's a great obsession um\n[Music]\nit's it's the beginning of all knowledge\nright it's the seed of all knowledge\nlike everything starts from that true uh\neverything starts from that question\nand and it's it's yeah it's the\nbeginning of all knowledge and\nand seeking of of true knowledge i loved\nwhat you said about the truth always\nresonating\ntell us a bit about bob around the\napplying the law of attraction to\nto love in our lives because i find that\none of the biggest paradigm blocks that\na lot of us have and i know a lot of my\nlisteners feel challenged with is\nthe finding of love the keeping of love\nthe\nuh growing of love in a relationship\nwith another person\nuh it can be one of the biggest\nchallenges as you said our spiritual dna\nis perfect but our\nmaterial experiences in dna comes with\nbaggage and\npain and stress and we end up attracting\nor vibrating at a level where we\nattract something that that actually is\nwhat we need at the time but\nisn't what we really truly want tell me\na bit about your experience in that area\nin your field or study in that area\ni think that love\nis resonance when two people are in love\nthey're on the same frequency\nintellectually emotionally and\nphysically\nmost people that get married are not in\nlove\nthey're in habit\nor that stay married or not in love\nwhen two people are in love they enjoy\nthinking about the same ideas\nconscious mind deals with ideas\nthey get emotionally involved with the\nsame idea so they're setting up the same\nvibrations\ntheir heart is on the same frequency and\nphysically they enjoy\ndoing the same things they have a great\nphysical connection\nthat's when two people are in love\nthey're in harmony intellectually\nemotionally and physically\nyou can fall in love with your business\ni'm in love with the business that i'm\nin\nintellectually emotionally and\nphysically i'm in it\nright up to here you know\nso that's where i see love comes in i\nthink i don't think most people are that\nare married or in love\ni think they see each other and he\nthinks god she looks pretty good and she\nthinks he looks pretty good and\nthey go to bed and go to heaven for 15\nminutes and they say we're in love\nwell they were actually having some fun\nbut they weren't in love but they\nthought they were and so they get\nmarried and they have nothing in common\nreally\nand some of them will\ngive the marriage a quiet funeral and\nget on with life and others will\njust stay there and live like that but\nthere isn't any love there may be\nrespect and things like that\nbut i see love is when it's harmony it's\nresonance\nyou can love a person you can love an\nidea\nyou can love a vocation you can love a\nplace\nyou know it's like paul the apostle he\nsaid the greatest thing is love and he's\nso right\nwell that's when everything you're in\nharmony with everything\nin all aspects of your life um\nand pretty well the way i'm living now\nit's taken me\n87 years to get here you know\nbut life's pretty good yeah i can tell\ni i feel it from the way you speak it's\nit's definitely there which is beautiful\nwhere where does anyone who's listening\nto us today bob will definitely feel\ninspired and moved what would you want\nsomeone to do\nstraight after they stop listening to\nthis episode\nas they go back into their own life\nafter listening to you today\nwhat do you want them to do what are you\nwho do who do you want them to be where\nwould you like them to start\ni'd like to ask them to ask themselves\nwhat do i really want\nin this life what do i really\nwant and take a pen\nand write it down\n[Music]\nwhat do i really want in this life\nthey might start out what do i love\ndoing\ni think that's where you start your\npurpose in life is what do you love\ni'm living my purpose see your purpose\nis why you're alive why you get out of\nbed in the morning\nand some people never figure that out\nthey never even give it any thought\nwhen it's probably the most important\nquestion a person can ask themselves\nif you start out what do i really love\ndoing that's a good place to start\ndo you know i had a a doctor here\nprobably a couple of years ago now in\nphoenix he was in a seminar and he said\nhe was telling me he was thinking of\nquitting the medical profession i said\nwhy are you going to quit\nwell he said you got to put in a lot\nmore time to earn less money today and i\nsaid well i've heard that\nhe said the medical profession's all\nmessed up and i said well i've heard\nthat too\ni said why did you become a doctor\nwell he said i'd love it why would you\nwant to quit\nwell he said because you can't earn i\nsaid wait a minute\ni said if you're doing what you love if\nyou never earned a\ndime you're spending your days doing\nwhat you love to do that's the trick of\nlife\ni said your problem is you think you\nearn money by going to work you work to\nearn money you don't work during money\npeople earn the most money don't work at\nall\nyou earn money by providing service but\nyou\ngain satisfaction from doing what you\nlove\nand there's two forms of income one\nsatisfaction the other is money\nit's a material thing but i said if\nyou're not getting satisfaction what you\ndo you should quit it\nbecause they said that's where it comes\nin that's why we should figure out what\nwe love to do\nand then dedicate our life to it i got\ninto this business\ni had been studying it for quite a while\nand i had the opportunity already\nmentioned a visiting early night yale\n1966\nand i was leaving his office right at\nthe end and i said earl\nwhat is the big deal in life well he\nsaid there isn't any big deal bob he\nsaid\nit's simply a matter of sitting and\nfiguring what you love to do and\nthen dedicate your life to it so the\nproblem with most people is they never\nfigure out what they love to do\nwell i'm telling i could feel the hair\ngoing up in the back of my neck i knew\nexactly what i love to do\ni would love to do what he was doing i\nwas and i wanted to do it with him\ni had a very busy company at the time we\nwere operating canada the us and england\nbut i knew that i was finished doing\nthat i was going to come back i was\ngoing to work with him\ntwo years later i was his vice president\nof sales i wanted to do in the what he\nwas doing being the business he was in\nand that's where i made the decision and\ni love it i\nlove what i do now that's what people\nshould be doing what do i love to do\nthen dedicate your life to it now you\nearn money by providing service you can\nearn money while you're sleeping\njust figure out how to serve people you\ndon't have to be there you don't have to\nphysically be there and do it\nyou can serve people while you're\nsleeping and get paid\nand that's how you're in money so you\ngot to learn how to earn money but that\nhas got nothing to do with\na life of living what you love that's\nthe first place\nso if i was telling anybody sit down\nfigure out what you love to do and then\nmake up your mind you're going to\ndedicate your life to it\nwhat stops most people what they love to\ndo\nthey think you can't earn any money at\nit that doesn't matter\nforget about the money that's another\nsubject figure out how to earn it go\ntalk to people and not earn money i know\nhow to earn money i can teach people how\nto earn money\nbut that is not the thing is to provide\nservice\nso the most important thing what do i\nlove to do\nsit down what would i really love to do\nhow would i love to spend my life\nthat's what we should do and\nunfortunately\nmost people never get involved in that\nexercise\nthank you bob yeah no i i couldn't agree\nmore i think\nyou know i was very fortunate when i was\nyoung to try out so many things and\nexperiment and explore and experience so\nmany things that\nit becomes more obvious what you love\nwhen you've allowed yourself to try your\nhand at many things because\nit's the same i always say it's the same\nas finding what's your favorite food\nthat you love\nyou have to try more foods to know which\nis your favorite food and\nit's the same with activity and and work\nin life we have to try out lots of\nthings\nwhat gave you the confidence when you\nwrote your book you were born\nrich tell me about that title tell me\nabout\nthat confidence that conviction of\ntelling people that they were born rich\nwhere does that where does that come\nfrom what does that mean\nwell i think it comes from awareness\nit's funny you mention it because almost\neverybody tried to talk me out of it you\nknow\nshe can't taste it teach that and\nwell the truth is everyone is born rich\nwe are born with deep reservoirs of\ntalent and ability within us\nwe're born rich most people are just\nshort of money the riches are in the\ntalents and the abilities that we've got\nwithin us\nand um i'd argue with a lot of people to\nkeep that name but i just made in my\nmind it's the truth you were born rich\nand um that's all there is to it\nfunny thing about the book you know i i\ni don't type i can type on this\ncomputer to get online but the type of\nletter\nman it would take me a long time so i\nwrote the whole book by hand\nand something i learned about paper\npaper swells\nwhen it gets old it swells well i had a\nfile it was about that thick\nit was the book and i had finished it\nand it was in a big file folder\nand i was in a cab and i left it in a\ntaxi\nand i couldn't tell you the color of the\ntaxi let alone the name or the number of\nit\nand i didn't have anything on it that\nwas the end of the book\nand i remember telling my wife she said\nwell how come you're not\nupset i said linda it's so bad it's got\nto be really good\nyou can't have something that's really\nbad that is really good it's the\nopposite side of the same thing\ni said the book probably wasn't any good\nso i started i wrote it over again you\nknow\nand uh it's turned out that must be\npretty good a lot of people have read it\nyou know that's incredible yeah that's\nawesome i love that story bob you've\nbeen so\ngenerous with your time today uh we end\nevery interview with what i call the\nfinal five this is the fast five\neach answer has to be one word to one\nsentence maximum\nfor these five questions so if you're\nready i'm i'm ready to go\nright okay question question one what's\nthe best\npiece of advice you ever received study\nevery day\nsecond question what's the worst piece\nof advice you've ever received\ndon't trust people um\ngreat awesome thank you\nquestion number question number three\nwhat's something that you know to be\ntrue but that other people might\ndisagree with you\non so what's something you're quite\nconfident about but other people may not\nquite understand there's greatness\nwithin\nevery human being\ni'd like to qualify that too yeah please\ni went into\nkingston penitentiary in canada it was\nmaximum security it's closed now i guess\nit was something like alcatraz\ni went in there one saturday a month for\nfive years\nand i was told by security and everybody\nelse\nyou can't let everybody come to me and i\nsaid listen\nif i'm coming in to speak everybody\ncomes that wants to come\nand i saw some real bad people\nthey were classified as real bad people\ni saw them change right around\nbecause i taught them all the same thing\ni had one that was in solitary\nconfinement for seven and a half years\nwhen i first met him he had been\nsentenced to 27 years\nyou know that man got out on a parole\nwith me\nand they i had the canadian government\ntear up his parole about two years\nlater and it was a seven year parole and\ngive him his passport so he could move\nto england with me\nand that was my positive proof because\nhe was considered a real bad guy\nthat's amazing yeah and so i really\nbelieve there's greatness in\nevery one of us there's goodness in\nevery one of us and when we really\nunderstand that that's what we're going\nto look for in people\ni love that i love that beautiful thank\nyou for sharing that story\nuh question number four out of five\nuh what's something you wish you knew\nearlier\ni wished i knew the value of studying\nearlier\noh how i wished i had known that i was\n26\ni was a terrible student i hated school\ni wouldn't listen to the teachers i\nwouldn't read the books i wouldn't do\nanything anybody told me i was\nundisciplined\ni thought i was a smart guy it was just\nso dumb\nand i was down\ngoing down the wrong path and like that\nwhen i met ray stanford and he gave me\nthis and he talked to me\ni started to study i love it\nnow i thought when i started i was\nfairly old\ni was 26. now i'm 86 i'll be 87 in july\nnow i realize how young i was how\nfortunate i was\nbut even with that awareness i still\nwish i'd started\nto study at a very early age
