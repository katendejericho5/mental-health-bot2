you and\nyour beautiful wife\nyes i wish she was here today she's in\nlondon so she doesn't get back\nokay so tomorrow and so yeah she would\nhave loved to see you when i told her\nyou were coming on today she was very\nhappy yeah you've really\ni still remember that day when you\nsurprised her of being on the show\noh yeah because i i just want to start\nthere because so so i met jada\nwhen i was asked by facebook to host the\nlaunch of red table tour\nright and we met behind the scenes for a\nfew moments\nand that became this conversation that\nconnected us yes and then we went on and\ni mean red table talk is just phenomenal\nwe all love it we're so happy you're\ndoing i want to dive into that\nbut then we come to the show and\nliterally that whole morning my wife's\nlike what should i wear\nand i'm like you're not even going to be\non camera like i was just like\njada's into like i was like i'm going on\ncamera you're not going i did that whole\nman thing right\nand i was just like you're not even\ngoing to be on camera i was like why are\nyou worrying so much\nright and we get there and then you're\nlike you know you and your team are like\nwell you should both do\nyeah i was like you have to you gotta\ncome you gotta come on yeah i'm holding\nmy head in my hand\nanyway but you've always been so loving\nto both of us and we've learned so much\nfrom you and the family and anyway thank\nyou for being here but i want to start\noff\nwith talking about your childhood okay\nbecause we've talked about it a bit\nbefore as well and yeah\ni want to hear about what was so\nformative about your childhood into who\nyou are today what are the\nexperiences that form\nform the parts that you love form the\nparts that you're working through from\nthe parts that you're editing\nyeah let's start there it's so funny\nbecause the\ncomponents of my childhood um and the\nexperiences that i had in my childhood\nthat have formed\nwhat i love are also the same\nexperiences that have formed\nthe characteristics within me that\naren't so pretty\nright so i had a lot of adversity\nduring my childhood you know and\nmy mother was a heroin addict and my\nfather was\nan addict alcoholic criminals he would\ndescribe himself\nand um so i did a lot of\ngrowing up um having to teach myself\nlet's say the ways of the world were\nkind of thrown at me in the streets of\nbaltimore\nyou know what i mean um\ni think that because i had uh\nsuch independence at such a young age\ni really\num i could really\nsee who i was and who i wasn't right\nthere were a lot of strengths i was able\nto\nacquire at a very young age a lot of\nwhat we would call mother wit you know\nwhat i'm saying it's like that knowledge\nthat you\ndon't learn and you know the textbooks\nat school but through life right and so\ni would say that i got prepared for a\nlot of things at an early age\nyou know that at a point of time in my\nlife\nit i didn't necessarily see it as a gift\nso i went through a lot of depression\n[Music]\nin my early 20s and just\nfeeling like life isn't supposed to be\nthis hard yeah\nyou know what i'm saying and like yeah\nyou know and\ni really as life has gone on i just\nrealized\nthat's kind of what life is and that\nyou're not unique\nyeah you know that people are suffering\neverywhere\neverybody has a story you know and then\ni was able to\ntake my life experiences and find the\ngood in it which was\nthat's the very thing that made it\npossible for me to come to la by myself\nat the age of 18\nand work out a career for myself\nand and craft a life for myself yes you\nknow what i mean but i\ni i have been working through and am\nstill working through um you know and\nunderstanding that\nlife is not an enemy you know and that\nadversity is not\nmeant to steal\nthings from you it is actually meant to\nhelp you find the things within you that\nhelp you find the giant within actually\nyou know but that and just learning how\nto\nlay down my warrior you know the yeah\nman yeah that's just yeah that's that's\nbeen\na consistent struggle you know\nbecause as soon as i'm in trouble as\nsoon as i feel hurt the first place i\ngo to is fight right right\nand so yeah i've had to really\nlearn how to uh\nlay down that warrior and even in my\nwithin the biggest hurts\nsit with that pain with an open heart\nand that is ooh jay\nthat's the\n[Laughter]\nyeah so that that's you know i i\ni love the warrior within me yes and\nspecifically the spiritual warrior that\nhas\nyou know come out of my life experiences\nbut that street warrior\nthat street warrior is a humble doozy\nyou know and she can be cruel and she\ncan be\ndeeply unloving yeah you know what i\nmean and so that that that's the shadow\narea within myself\nthat i am at least now far more\nconscious of than i've ever been\nand even if she comes out i can grab her\nquick\nbefore she's right you know what i mean\nso\nyou know it's all about just getting to\nthose deeper levels of consciousness\num you know you you might not\nnecessarily be able to\ndissolve those um aspects of your\nyou know shadow as quickly as you want\nbut as long as you're you know as i get\nmore and more\nconscious of those uh shadow aspects\num i can just get the reins\nof it a bit faster and replace it with\nabsolutely something that's closer to\nlove yeah\nyou know but i also realize that i'm\ni think one of the biggest realizations\nthat i've made is that\ni'm actually learning how to love\ni think that a lot of us yeah both\nyourself and\nothers yes yeah\nyeah this this is jade everyone like\nthis you know you have\nyou have a show where you interview\npeople and i'm so glad that we get there\nthe tables have turned today there's no\ntable but the tables have turned today\nand i'm so glad that we get to hear you\nlike just in five minutes you've\nbasically given us a whole thesis\non on how to grow in our lives i'm so\nglad we get to just hear you talk i'm\njust listening today i'm like\ni just want to listen because the world\nneeds this\nand it needs to hear you say you're so\nkind you're so patient with everyone\nelse\nit's like yeah so thank you i i want to\ndive into you know i was just saying\nthat\nyou're so patient when i when when i\nwhen you interviewed me or whenever i\nwatch any of your interviews you're just\nyou're such a listener and the best\nquality i take away from you willow and\nadrian from that day was just\nyou three are like the best listeners\nyou you\nengage people in a way that makes them\nfind stuff they didn't even know\nthat was in them right and and my only\nhope and i'm asking you to bless me to\ndo this i'm trying to do the same back\nfor you today you always do it though\njust because we're in front of cameras\ntoday no i mean seriously\nbut i mean i really mean it but let's\ndive into what you said because\nlet's start i mean there's tons of stuff\ni want from what you just said life is\nnot the enemy\nyeah such a powerful statement yeah i\nfeel like\nfrom what you just said you went through\nwith your mother and your father yeah\nthere are people who are listening who\nhave similar experiences\nthere are people who have no idea what\nthat feels like\nbut all of us in our own way like you\nsaid feel life is the enemy at some\npoint\nyes how did you face that\nfeeling that life is the enemy how do\nyou face that in the first instance\nyou've talked about the transformation\nbut\nwhen you first get a grips with it how\ndid you grapple with that\ni really started\ncoming outside of myself and\nlooking at the world and having\nconversations with people\nabout their life and realizing i wasn't\nthe only one that was\nhurting so powerful you know what i mean\nin that mostly everybody you're that\nyou'll meet is hurting at some capacity\nbut hurt is hurt so everybody's trying\nto measure you know hurt as much as i\ndid\n[Laughter]\nyou know hurt is hurt and so once i\nrealized that that was the thing that we\nhad in common\nyou know that and that's not the only\nthing we have in common\nbut that's usually you know those trauma\npatterns are usually the things that we\nrun into fiercely that that create\nmore suffering and more conflict between\npeople right\nand so i really started looking at that\nand realizing oh wait a minute hold it\nhold it hold it\nokay now you have to get out of your ego\nyou have to stop thinking that\nyou are so special that you're the only\none that hurts this\nway yeah because that's ego on the other\nside i think that\nyou know what i mean yes yeah and i\nlike i had to really confront\nhow egotistical i was in my martyrdom\nyes thank you right we never\nreally talk about that side of ego\nwe always look at the boisterous you\nknow\nfull of themselves kind of but\nthat other spectrum of the ego that to\nme\ncan be a bit more insidious\nbecause it's not it's not\nrecognized in the same way as how we\nidentify\nyes ego and when i\ncame upon that one\nand i mean fiercely egotistical in\noh how i suffer and no one suffers like\nme\nit was like all of that and bringing\nmore\nsuffering into my life in order to prove\nand to build on that martyrdom\nand i i mean i was floored i was floored\nin that discovery\nof myself and that face\nof my ego that had really\ntaken the lead of my life yeah i\nlove the way you just put that i i think\nyou i i completely agree because\nthe ego wants to be the most anything\nso we look at the ego like you're saying\nwe look at the ego as like oh i'm the\nbest at this\nright am the most accomplished\nright but then on the flip side what\nyou're talking about which is the\ninsidious as you said\nit's the i'm the most pained yeah i'm\nthe most\nhurt i've had the most wrong done to me\nyes\nand so exactly it's that ego just\npushing it aside and\nunfortunately like you said because we\ndon't think of that as ego right\nwe actually and what you said which\nwhich really just blew my mind now\nyou're like\nactually we go and collect more pain to\nprove that we are the most pained that\nwas my life\nthat's crazy and you put it that's\nexactly what it is\ncrazy i didn't mean to say about you i'm\nnot talking about you i'm saying about\nmyself no\ncrazy you can call me crazy any day jay\nbecause it's you know it it\nit is a level of insanity and i had to\nreally look at that\nyeah me too you know and i\ni had to um\nmake a lot of changes in my life\nand have the courage to make those\nchanges\nyeah because you know more than anybody\nit's not easy\nto grapple with those\nideas and energies within absolutely\nyeah\nand there's that's beautiful the second\nthing that really stood out when you\nwere when you were sharing the\nearlier notes with us when you said you\nhad to lay down the warrior\nand when you say that what i hear is\ni hear so many people thinking like\nthey're fighting for justice\nyeah but they're fighting for justice\nfor themselves we're fighting for what\nwe think is right\nwe're fighting for what we believe is\nright and when you say i have to lay\ndown that warrior that always wants to\nfight and get going and\nthat sounds like a very tough thing to\ndo\nagain because everything about you when\nyou're fighting feels like you're doing\nwhat's right like i hear that so often\nwhen people are\nbut i know i'm right and i know they're\nwrong and it's like we know we're like\nso\nit's so factual in our head yeah but\nyou're actually talking about actually\nlaying down the warriors giving you more\npeace\nyes so tell us about that process\nyeah and it's not even let me tell you\nwhat's deep about that inner warrior\nwhen it comes to\nspecifically dealing with\nrelationships that are close to you you\nknow whether they're friendships whether\nthey're\nmarriages whether they're parent-child\nrelationships right for someone like me\nwho's dealt with a lot of loss and\nheartbreak in my life\none of the things that i did in order to\nsurvive it was\nto create this\nwall and kind of this invincibility\nthat warrior right that comes and goes\nyou can't take me out so bring it\nright so\nnow when you are confronted with\nheartbreak\nwith someone who you say you love\nand the warrior wants to come and go\nwhat's up\nwhich you got yeah\nso that's not loving and it's surely not\ngoing to create more love\nbut it's been the defense mechanism\nthat's protected me\nfrom the wolves the bears\non the street yeah where i grew up\nyou weren't allowed to be open and\nloving\nright yeah yeah you know it's like\nthat'll get you killed basically\nyeah which you had to be was sly\nslick you know what i'm saying you had\nto have one up on everybody else\nright and so it's such a tough way to it\nis\nand you you definitely you know you you\nalso\nhave to in order to protect yourself\nin the war zones that i grew up in it's\nlike you know\nthere's a little killer that's inside of\nyou you know what i'm saying\nand so all of these\num aspects of my personality that have\nbeen nurtured and even coming out to la\nat a young age and dealing with all\nthese\nall these suit what i call pseudo-wolves\nright um but yet and still\nhaving to have that killer instinct on\npoint\nyou know and that's kind of where will\nand i connected\nyeah that inner killer yeah you know\nwhat i'm saying\nit's like we know how to fight\nyou know what i mean and so um\nso then when it's time for he and i to\nactually\nhave some openness\nright because of what we've nurtured\nyeah\nand i have a lot of people around me\nthat i have relationships with\nthat come from those kind of backgrounds\nenvironments and it makes it\nvery difficult to\nget to loving kind\ncompassionate gentle spaces\nwithin and without\nright and so even learning to have\nthat because that killer instinct will\nturn on you\nand that's what you don't realize it's\nlike you think you're protecting\nyourself from other people\nand from the world but at the end of the\nday you're shutting yourself from\nyourself\nwow right and to the point you don't\nknow you\nyou're not even connected to\nyour soul your heart your like\nand when when i had to wake up and out\nof that fog\nof how i had been operating\nand my heart and spirit weren't actually\nin the lead\nthat is such a hard confront yeah when\nyou have to look at\nthe things within yourself that don't\nconfirm\nwho you thought you were yeah and then\nyou have to look at how it's affected\npeople you actually care about that's\nthe work\nyeah that's the work but it's beautiful\nthat you could see it\nand separate it yeah because i think\nhalf the time the challenge is people\njust see it as\nthem it's not right like that yeah yeah\ni am just this\nlike if you had just accepted you're\nlike oh i'm just baltimore i'm just\nstreet i'm just\nthis is just who i am yeah now and and i\ncan't change it\nbecause it's who my conditioning is but\nthat's what i'm saying like\nit's it takes such a moment to be able\nto separate and go\nwait a minute i can either lead from the\nheart i can lead from\nthis or i can be led by\nwhatever it is right yeah like the\nopposite i think it was really\nmy i guess when i turned\n40 i really got serious about my\nspiritual practices and\nand and my spiritual connection i always\nknew that there was a power higher than\nme\nbut i wasn't connected\nso it's different knowing that there's a\nhigher power and then actually taking\nthe time to cultivate\nthat relationship you and i have talked\na lot about yes\nand once i started really cultivating\nand that that takes such a discipline\nand\nand such a deep trust right\ncultivating that relationship with that\nhigher source\nand started to realize the beauty\nand the depth of love that was in that\nthat's in that source i said well this\nis what i\nam yeah because this is where i'm this\nis what i'm made for yes\nyes all this other stuff has been\nacquired\nwow yeah this is actually where i'm\nright this is actually\nthis is this is it i think i'm from this\nbut i think that i'm\nof baltimore no no no no the source\nyeah right and so\ni've been stepping towards\nyou know shedding all the\nideas of what i believe that i am\nso it's just been a lot of ego death you\nknow it's a\nconstant\nego death i feel like every day\nyeah some aspect of myself is dying\nand that i completely understand\nyou know why some people just choose not\nto do it\nyeah because it's almost like a part of\nyou\nmourns every time even a bad part dies\nright because they're good friends yeah\nand believe it or not\nthey feel close yes they feel close\nbecause it's been a part of you for 10\n20 30\nyears whatever it is and so every time\nit dies you feel like you've lost a part\nof who you are\nyes but we're saying that it's not\nreally really you\nyou know so it's almost like you have to\nsend off those\naspects of yourself with and one of the\nthings that i've learned\nyou gotta love those shadows\nyou gotta love them they might\nyou know it's like\nthose shadow pieces got me they helped\nme survive\nmaybe not at the highest level but i'm\nhere yeah and you know you just send\nthem off with thank yous\nyou know for this next part\ni i just don't need that but thank you\nfor all of it the good the bad the the\nchallenging the the you know the joyous\njust for all of it\nand so i feel like\nin the bigger scope of the spiritual\nspectrum\nwhen we can embrace our own shadow\nit decreases it dissipates the that like\nnegative energy that's put into shadow\nright yes yes yes so\nultimately in the collective shadow\nwe can help yes bring light\nyeah you know as we're dealing with our\nown personal shadows\nthank you so much for that that the\nthank yous\nto your shadows like i love to your\nshadows that is so powerful because i\nfeel like\nif you try and drop something out of\nhaste yeah or out of like\nresentment yes pick it back up as\nquickly you do\nbecause you don't really detach and so\nthat's so powerful thank you for that\nlike just that\njust as simply as you put it just just\nlove your shadows and love them to leave\nright like love them as they leave not\nnot this like\nnot this like resentment oh i don't need\nyou anymore\nyeah get out of here like that that kind\nof warrior again yeah absolutely\nthinking that you're protecting yourself\nbut actually you're just making it\neasier for them to creep back in\nthat aversion is just version yeah is\njust as\nyou know i've listened i've learned that\nany extreme you know i\nwas the queen of extremes\nand now i'm trying to be the queen of\nneutrality oh\ni like yeah and i love it yeah no no big\nhighs no big lows\nyou know because it's all on each\non each side is pitfalls yes you know\nand so um you know\nfor me to just i'm always trying to\nuh find that\nmental place for right perception\nyou know so any extreme gets us into\nfalse ideas of some kind\nyes yeah it's so true it is it is so\ntrue you're so right because that in the\ngita it said that\nattachment and a version are two sides\nof the same coin yeah\nso now the git is my book yeah i know i\nknow it's my book too\nyeah it's my book too yeah it's yeah and\nthat that statement\nis so powerful because we think oh those\nwho are attached\nare going down the wrong path but it's\nalso those who are\nfalsely averse uh or what sometimes the\nbooks call it as monkey renunciation\nyeah\nright yeah the monkey just like\nplayfully will say oh i don't need that\nbanana i don't like\nit but really and it's hot it's like\ncraving it yep and it pulls it back into\nits life\nso yeah that's a really it's a tricky\nday\ndance that's i like that yeah but i like\nthat word\nbecause when you see it as a dance it is\nit's a dance\nall of it is you know i mean\njust realizing that you know the the the\nother thing\nyou know we're having this conversation\ndays after\nyou know the tragic death of kobe and\nthe feeling and the idea of impermanence\nis absolutely terrifying\nand the ego and i even went through this\nafter hearing about kobe\nand having certain situations in my life\nand realizing how the ego just came in\nand shut me down\npeople were talking about how they were\nopening up\nand what happened and what i realized is\nnow\nhaving in my life right now having to\ndeal with the idea\nof impermanence how so not only do you\nhave to\nwalk in this life with openness\nbut knowing that there's no ground\nunderneath you\nand the way in which the ego wants it to\nto be yeah so\nas soon as that happened my ego came in\nand said we gotta get control\nyeah we gotta get control\njust like shocked shocked into\nget control and i was like oh but it was\nsuch\nit was like it just showed me that next\nlevel\nof purification that needs to happen\nwithin and the acceptance of\nimpermanence\nand knowing that i don't have the ground\nunder my feet in the way in which my ego\nwants but what i have\nlearned is that the ground under my feet\nis that of a higher source\nthat's the only ground to walk on\nit's the only ground it's the only safe\nground\nit's the only thing that\none can truly rely on\nand that our human interactions are for\nour lessons\nyeah not for reliability in that way\nyou know if you come across\nrelationships and people that\nyou can rely on fifty percent of the\ntime\nsixty percent of the times ninety\npercent that's a win yeah it's huge\nit's true yes and i think that\noftentimes we come into these false\nideas\nof what our human relating is supposed\nto be about\nah yeah tell us about that okay yeah\ntell us about that\nthis is probably one a lot of people are\nnot going to want to hear\ni think it's good i think the more we\ntalk about and this is what you're\nyou're an expert at this\nand you do it out of compassion right\nwe're talking about these things\nas people who've who are going through\nit\nyou know we've always talked about in\nthat way like when you're saying all of\nthis i'm like i did that i did that\ni did that i do that i still do that you\nknow it's\nit's it's not coming from a place so\nyeah tell us from that place\nso from that place and just recognizing\nthat what i've learned i've learned this\nfrom my own faults\nand where i think i've shown up for\npeople or\nyou know um or where i've failed people\nyou know um and realizing\nin in my own relating with people\nthat relationships\nare simply there to show us ourselves\nwell yeah and i think a lot of times\nwe go into relationships we you know we\ngravitate to\nfriends or we gravitate to lovers or\nhusbands and wives and what have you\nand we're like this person\nis supposed to know how to love me yes\noh wow right and so when the inevitable\ndisappointment comes up inevitably\ninevitable\nyou know of how this person has failed\nyou how this person has hurt you how\nthis person has betrayed you\nhow this person hasn't been the most\nintegris we could go on and on and on\nright now\nwe are taking it personally and we're\nlooking at something is wrong with me\nor something is wrong with them but\nsomething's wrong\nyes right yeah once again\nthe ability to lay the ego down\nyeah and look at the mirror\nright and say what is this showing me\nabout myself\nso it's so hard to do because at the end\nof the day no matter what's happening\nnow and now i'm not talking about people\nhave been victimized in a certain manner\ncorrect right\ni'm talking about right i'm talking\nabout\num consensual relationships\nthat go awry yes no matter what\ni've had to realize that no matter what\ncircumstance i'm in\nand no matter what's happened i have to\ntake responsibility\nthis is going to help a lot of people\npushing through that\nyeah that's a hard one yeah it is hard\nlike and i guess it's even harder when\nyou have kids i think one of the most\ndifficult aspects of in in\nmy history of relating um\nin those moments that i wanted to hang\non to victim or i want to hang on to\nblame\ni would have that moment where i had to\nlook at the situation and go\nwell you let this into your life so why\nyeah let's look at that because at the\nend of the day jada\nthat's all you have control over yes\nright\nso when i had to start\nlooking at how i was relating to people\nhow i was being affected\nand how i was affecting them but then\nmaking the choice to only look at\nmy part yeah oh jay jay\nthat responsibility that level of\nresponsibility\nbut what it reveals to you\nabout why you're making the choices that\nyou're making and inviting\ncertain dynamics and people\ninto your life because at the end of the\nday\nit's your invite wow\nyes it's you invite them into yourself\nyou invited it\nyou chose it so now you have to look at\nthe why because\nthat same saying of nobody can do to you\nwhat you don't allow\nah yes absolutely well when i tell you\nthat's a painful one to have to oh\nbecause first of all it goes against\neverything we've been taught\nabout what love is supposed to look like\nwhat romantic love is\nhow am i right yeah i was like i don't\nneed to look at me he's the one that\nwent out and did that\nyeah yeah but she chose them so let's\ntalk about it\nso well booked yeah it's your invite\nit's like it's like if someone comes to\na party\nat your house right and you didn't like\nhow they behaved\nyou could be upset with them or you\ncould be like but i sent them the invite\nright like that's why i love the word\ninvite\nbecause it's the same thing but you've\ngot to look at the fact i invited them\ni'm the one who told them to come right\nand maybe in the back of your head you\neven knew that they would probably do\nsomething like that but you still\ninvited them yep\nwhether it was an obligation expectation\nwhether it was lust whether it whatever\nit was that\nyes and that part what you have to\nreally look at is like\noh i invited this person in because blah\nblah blah blah blah\nand then when you look at why they were\ninvited in the first place then you\nrealize why the circumstance is what\nit is\nbut i realized in my own life if i\nwasn't willing to take responsibility\nfor that my life would not change\n100 and we stay stuck\nin certain patterns when we're not\nwilling to look at ourselves\nyeah yeah it's a herpes yeah that is\nthat's but that's i mean that is the\nbest way i've ever heard it\nbeing put because i think we we hear\nthat self-reflection piece a lot\nbut it's it's really that what you've\njust put the like\nthe magnifying glass on of just it's\nyour invite you made the choice\nyou selected it and when you realize why\nyou did that\nthat's what's your actual enemy like\nthat's what you're actually up against\nyes you're not up against that person\nyou're up against\nthis conditioning or habit or pattern\nyes that is making you choose that type\nof a\nperson in your life and we're it's never\nthe person that's the thing i realize\nit's always me yeah\nit's all ways\nme and i can make a choice\nand what i realize is that that's self\nlove that's real selfish that's\nreal self love it's not just when we can\nhave the love\nlove ourselves enough to have the\ncourage\nto look at ourselves and be honest\nlook at our patterns look at our creates\nand then make the changes have the\ncourage then to make the changes that we\nneed\nthat reflect a more loving\nembrace of ourselves nobody can do that\ni don't care how much they love you now\nwhat we can do is be responsible enough\nto\nbring people in our lives who do um who\nassist in\nnourishing yeah\nthat's self-love but people can't create\nit and i think a lot of times we try to\nlook for relationships that buoy us up\nah relationships that confirm\nideas of what we think we are\nokay yeah yeah right yeah yeah yeah\nabsolutely\nand we rely on people\nto confirm us yeah versus\nrelying on ourselves\nand the self-love patterns that we have\nthe courage to create\nto confirm us absolutely\nabsolutely and i've heard you say that\nthat actually when you surrounded\nyourself with people who are honest with\nyou\nyes that that's what really helped\nright because if you're always\nsurrounding yourself with yes people or\nconfirmation people\nthen you're just creating that bubble of\nconfirmation yeah but but you actually\nwere saying that\nhow about how do we there's two things\nthere because i find like\nattracting people to be honest with you\nrequires two things\none is that you're ready we all say like\ni want real feedback right but it's like\ndo i\nreally want your feedback like how and\nthat's why you've got to ask that to the\npeople that you really want it from like\nyeah you can't just throw that around\nlike you don't just go out the streets\nand go give me feedback\nright but but one thing is you've got to\nbe ready for honesty\nand the second thing is you've got to be\nable to give honesty\nto others and yourself too because if\nyou're struggling to give honesty\nthen how do you think that person feels\nabout giving it to you or to anyone\nand so we create this cycle of of this\ncircle of dishonesty and\neven if it's not dishonest like we're\nnot trying to lie to anyone right it's\njust\ni'm just going to hide it and harbor it\nexactly with that that's a lot\nof what happens in relationships that\npeople spend a lot of time\nfiguring out how not to be found out\nyeah\nright so whether it's like oh i don't\nwant this person to know\nyou know this person i really care about\nto know that i'm actually scared in this\narea i don't want my friend to see\nthat i actually don't\ndon't know what i'm doing whatever it is\nwe spend so much time masking yeah\nyou know feeling as though we need to be\nsomething\nyou know one of the things that i will\nsay\nabout long-term relating\nis that you do get worn down\nto a place where things can get\nso raw\nin the most beautiful way that there's\njust no more room for pretending\nand that you know each other so well\nyou can't hide and then you come to a\nplace\nin your relating where you go\nam i just gonna leave this and then\ngo someplace else create another\nrelationship where i can be more\nconfirmed\non what i'd rather see myself as\nyeah and create more of a buffer right a\nbuffer to hide it\nor am i going to stay in this\nand get to my true self wow and that's\nusually what\nthe decision comes down to right\nand it's a hard\nit's hard confront and you know even in\nwhen i see that people decide to go\ntheir separate ways like oh i get it\nyeah i get it because this is it\nis so excruciating\nyou know but if you can find the\nfriendship\nand that's another thing you there\nthere's this friendship that\nthat blossoms you know that\nsuper you know just basically um\nexceeds whatever romantic\nideals or you know\ni whatever fantasies that you had about\nyour relationship right and there's this\nthis friendship and this this this\nspiritual partnership\nthat starts to be created once you are\nwilling to\nwalk the landmines\nof the traumatized\nchild together because that's all it is\nthat's what it comes down to\ntwo traumatized kids trying to figure it\nout yeah what are they gonna figure out\nand when you sit down and you go okay\nwe're gonna walk this land mine together\nnow you might lose a couple limbs you\ngood with that\n[Laughter]\nthey'll grow back they'll grow back you\nknow we can we get to the other side\nthey're gonna grow better\nyou know what i mean they'll be better\nyeah and they'll be better they'll be\nbetter they'll be stronger you know but\nand i think that's the challenge for so\nmany people that\nand and i think this is not this is not\nmutually exclusive but it's like i think\nfeel i hear a lot of this and\ntell me if you feel the same way i hear\na lot of one\npartner trying to go on this path yeah\nand one struggling yeah as always right\nlike it's always kind of like that it's\nrarely that it's like oh here's two\npeople\nand and you know with me and rodney it\nwas very much like\nwe did it we did some processing\ntogether but we also did a lot of\nprocessing separately\nand i wasn't even conscious that she was\ndoing it right\ni didn't even know like if i'm\ncompletely honest i'm like there were\ntimes when\nwe were just distance and working on\nstuff\nindependently yeah and then when we both\nfigured out our own time we came back in\nour own timing and\ncontinue to push forward and so but i\nfind for a lot of people\nthey they feel that they're trying\nthey're trying to face themselves\nthey're trying to take on those lessons\nbut then they're like trying to pull\nsomeone\nup right and and then they're like\ntrying to get everyone through the land\nmine\nright and and it's kind of like it feels\nlike a lot of pressure\nthat that sounds like a hard place to be\nwhat's your thoughts on that like what\nhave been your\nrealization i'm not looking for a\nsolution right it's like what's been\nyour reflection realization seeing\npeople go through that hearing that and\nwanting to support and help them too i\nwould say that\nin relationships and when it comes to\ngrowth\nit's that see-saw there are times when\nyou know sometimes your partner is gonna\nhave to pull you\nyes sometimes you're gonna have to pull\nyour partner sometimes you do have to go\nyour separate ways\nand figure out a whole lot of things\nbecause the first thing you have to\nfigure out is who you want to be\ndefinitely who do you want to be\ndefinitely\nthat's what it comes down to that's what\nit comes down to what kind of life do\nyou want to have\nwho do you want to be yeah and then you\ncan actually communicate that\nright because half the time we're just\nexpecting people to be mind readers yeah\ni felt like that for so long i just\nwanted people because and it was because\nmy mom could always read my mind\nand this is what really helped me i just\nstarted to look at\nand and this is something that really\nhelped me which i hope it helps anyone\nwho's listening or watching right now\nlike\ni sat there and i was like what do i\nemulate that my parents did with me\nthat i am now projecting onto my wife\nor my partner whoever it is and when i\nstarted to do that i started to see all\nthe good things\nand all these things that i don't want\nto be but i'm like oh because my mom\ncould always predict\nand read my mind when i was young i\nalways expected my partner to be able to\ndo that same thing\nright with no information with no\ncommunication with no\nwith no help from me they should just\nknow and\ni had the opposite right i wanted to\nhave\nthat mirroring from my parents and\nbecause i didn't have it\ni expected it from will right and it's\nso it we end up doing the same\nit comes down to that like\nus coming out of our you know uh\nwhat do you call it the the the the\nchild\nyeah it's a traumatized child or\nyou know uh in your case\nyou know it's you had a you actually had\nan experience that you were trying to\nrecreate repeat you know exactly\nand so a beautiful one at that yeah and\nbut a rare one too like how can i just\nsay you can't just be like you got you\ncan't expect\nanyone to live up to that you know it's\nand and also it's like\nwhat are you expecting that person to\nlive up to why right but you know that's\na part of all the the the uh\nideas of romanticism too that when\nsomebody really loves you they know\nthey just know you know\nthey just know they just know if they\ndon't know then it's not like that\nplease it's not true it's not true but\nso many of us\noperate off of that idea movies media\nand music yes\nit's just oh yeah they just yeah\nit's a lot of fantasy that's such a\ngreat point you're so expected\nyou really do know and you're like and\nand this magic\nfairy dust them knowing and\nand then you put it all on that so even\nif someone treats you really badly\nbut they knew what gift you wanted or\nthey knew what you wanted to do on your\nbirthday you take that as\nthis the thing even if they treat you\nlike crap\ncrap in between yeah it gets messy\nyou've defined for us so many\nwords today i feel like you've really\ngiven us either defined or you've\nyou've deeply taken us to the\nyou've really taken us to the depths of\nso many words today like genuinely like\nwhen we talk about ego we talk about\nself-love what is your\nand you ask me this too and i'm\nintrigued by yours what is your\nmost current and i say most current\nbecause we're trying to evolve\nright what's like your most current\ndefinition and understanding of love\nlike what where where is that at right\nnow and and how is your\nviewpoint of where it is well i can tell\nyou\nprobably more clearly what i know love\nisn't\nlet's start there okay good place to\nstart yeah because i'm still\nin all honesty i'm still trying to\nfigure out\nwhat love is yeah me too yeah you know i\nthink it's a journey\nand i think that right now where i've\nstarted is self-love\nyou know and like on the deepest most\nexcruciating level\never right but i what i'm very clear\nabout is that i have no love to offer\nanyone if i don't love myself\nand i'm talking about on a very deep\nlevel\nright um through and through because i\njust got to a place where\ni wanted to\nheal myself so that i have that to offer\ninstead of all my trauma i'm\ntired of hurting people and that all\ncomes from um\n[Music]\nmy traumas and so i was i've made it a\npoint\nto just do some really deep healing\nbecause for this next part of my life\ni just i i want to leave a legacy of\nlove\nyou know what i mean um and so what i\nwhat i have realized love is not is uh\nromanticism yeah when i tell you i've\nthrown that\nout the way i'm like\nthat ain't it yeah right yeah\ni don't want any parts of it yeah the\nfull stuff\nall the falls magnified projected\ni need you to be this i\ndon't want it\num and so what i'm what i'm looking to\ndo\nyou know i'm in the process of learning\nto\nlove myself and love others and i know\nthat true love is not unkind\ni know that true love is compassionate\ntrue love is not always easy\nthat's for sure right but\nit's not cruel\nand ego has no place\nso that's what i know it's not love that\nright\num and what i do know also and this is\njust\nme i feel as though true love has to go\nfrom here to here\nto there so it's actually\nthat that higher source\nit has to come from my connection\nto my connection through the higher\nsource\nback because this right here i'll mess\nit up every time\nbelieve it believe it i'll mess it up\nevery time\nyeah and it's and it's not enough like\nit's like\nit's just it's it's and i i think it's a\nbrilliant design\nyeah of the highest yeah you want to\nlove you better come know me\nyeah you really want to love somebody\nyou really want to know yourself\nreally want to love yourself you better\ncome know me yeah\nyou can try this yeah you could try\nacquiring all these things and\noh i'll give you all the riches you want\noh you can have all that\nsee if it buys you love see if it gives\nyou\nthe love you're looking for\nand it doesn't it's a brilliant design\nand it's masterful because it works for\nanyone and everyone\nthat's when you know it's a design like\ni love that yes i've never heard it put\nthat way but you've really\nwhen you describe it as a design almost\nlike a law\nyes it's like a law it's a law it's a\nlaw\nand so that law is so\nwhen you think of it as a law you just\nrealize that there is no\nlike because i feel like when when you\nfirst fall in love\nyeah you you think you're the exception\nlike there is no couple who does not\nthink\nthat they are the exception me included\nyes\nyeah when i first got married i was just\nlike yeah i'm the exception right you\nknow like i'm like i'm like\nyou know like my ego is like really\nproud like i'm like yeah i did it\ndifferently\nright my friends got it wrong i'm gonna\nget it right you know that feeling\nyep then you get into it and you're like\noh okay\nbecause it's a law it is it's not it\ndoesn't matter who you are it doesn't\nmatter how evolved you think you are it\ndoesn't matter how spiritual you think\nyou are like\nif you think you are all those things\nthen you've missed the whole law you\nmissed the whole\ncone yes that's it you've missed it yeah\nyou missed it\nand and i love that you've said it's\ndesigned and it's law\nwhen we look at those language it's just\nso clear like\nit's designed this way don't try and be\nthat one person who breaks that design\nor\navoids it it doesn't work like that\nthat's the ego and the arrogance that\ncomes with thinking i can do better\ni can do better and you know i know\nbetter i'm smarter than\nand then you know all those kind of\nromantic feelings they're so\npowerful and so strong that you know\nyou it makes you feel like you've\nreached\nan a height that is beyond what it\nactually is\nyeah it's actually not\nit's a heightened state that's not\nin the highest ranks of love yeah it's\nactually in the\nin a pretty low rank you know once you\nreally\nget into it you know and how have you\nchanged that imagery because i feel like\nwith you and you know i recently you're\nin vietnam\nright you know i know that you travel\nspiritually i know we want to go to\nindia together\nyes like there's just you've started\ncrafting your life in a way where your\nimagery is changing what i mean by that\nis like\nwe have like when when we hear the word\nlove we have a mental picture based on\nmovies media music when you have a\nwhen you think of romance you have a\nmental picture right on what it looks\nlike because of\nmovies media music we have these mental\npictures but you've been changing\nwhere you visit what you read who you\nspend time like you've it's not just\nlike you're just\nyou're not just thinking about this\nstuff no my point is that you're making\na real\neffort to travel but also travel\ninternally yeah with books with\nlistening with teachers whatever it may\nbe\nto to go there it's not just like you\ndon't you kind of start thinking this\nand then it\nhappens if that makes sense yeah does\nthat make sense it makes a lot of sense\ntell me about any experiences that\nyou've had where\nyou've you've traveled or you've been\nthat have just left like a\nor even and it could be traveled through\na book anything that had left a\nbig impression on you where\nthere was something which gave you more\nfaith in what you're saying that gave\nyou even more strength in what you're\nsaying about how\nlove goes up and then back\nif that makes sense it makes all the\nsense in the world\nand i would say\n[Laughter]\nmy deepest travel has been\nin my bedroom in meditation\nyou know meditation people think about\nit in in\nreally lofty terms right so\ni'm going to take meditation out for a\nminute and just say\nin my bedroom in stillness love it\nbecause if you can just be still right\nand then stillness is where i learn to\nhave a very intimate relationship with\nmyself\nand a very intimate relationship with\nthe higher source\nright in those moments when i'm in a\ndeep\npainful struggle\nand i have to sit in the fire of that\npain\nand i have to look at what's coming up\nwhy it's coming up\nand just have the patience to sit with\nmyself\nand eventually that higher source comes\nin\nwith an embrace of some kind\nthat helps me understand why i am where\ni am\nand helps me\nsee what i need to change within\nwhatever trauma pattern within\nthat i need to change in order to\ndissolve a cycle that i'm in a cycle\nthat i'm trying to get out of or\nor a pain that i'm in usually when i'm i\nrealize\nif i'm in an enormous amount of pain of\nsome kind\nthen i have a false belief\nso i sit in stillness and i listen until\ni can recognize\nthe false belief and it may not come in\none sitting\nright it might take two might take three\nbut it always comes because once the\nuniverse knows\nyour intention you know what i mean and\nwhat you're in search for\nhonestly what you're in search for\nthe universe gives you the answers\nright and so that's been my biggest\ntravel yeah is\ninward best answer\nbecause that's available to everyone yes\nthat's what i love about it yeah\nas soon as you said that just like it's\navailable to each and every one of us\nit's not about going you don't need to\ngo anywhere and i i've often\nyou know like i've often said like a\nmonk is simply a traveler except the\njourney's within\nyeah like that's the real travel that's\nthe real trap you don't need to and what\nyou just said so beautifully about\nstillness and and the way you describe\nit and what you were saying that if i\nyou just say if you said if i'm\nexperiencing any pain\nit's because of a belief yes right it's\nbecause of a belief that\ni have and that's so powerful like that\nis so profound\nand when you went a step further it's\nlike\nit has to be what you said about\nintention with the universe it has to be\na request not a demand usually our\nquestion to the universe is not a\nquestion it's rhetorical it's like\nwhy is this happening you're right\nthat's not stillness that's not what\nyou're saying\nyou're not you know when you're sitting\nthere you're just like why is this\nhappening to me what's going on like why\nam i\nlike that's not stillness that's not a\nquestion a question is like\nwhere's this pain coming from yes why\nwhy\ndoes this show me show me i'm always yes\nsomeone now speaking to the other day\nthey called an innocent request\nlike you know it has to have that that\nintention of that innocent request\nyeah please tell me like exactly it's\nnot like tell me\nno it's gotta be now because that's that\nenergy that\ncloses us it has to be the most the\nthing that i've\nrealized in my journey is surrender\nthat's how true right and i'm only at a\nvery\nelementary level of surrender you know\nand trying to get to\nuh i'm every day jay\ni'm i'm i'm trying to deepen my bow\nyou know to my heart\nto the heart of others to the highest\num just trying to find those levels of\nsurrender to\nbring me um\n[Music]\nthe peace and the love within that i can\nshare with\nothers you know and i think for me too\ni've learned that\nlove is not red it's blue\nlove is really cool\nif it's all fiery and passionate you\nknow\nit's like you can have moments of that\nright\nyou get moments of that but if you\nexpect your foundation\nlove has to\n[Music]\nbe calm gentle\nand it has to have a certain stillness\nin order to really\npenetrate in a way in which\nyou can embrace all the beauty\nand all that's ugly as well\nand i think that people think love is\nsupposed to just be beautiful\nand fluffy well when we get to true love\nyes\nit is all of it yeah you can smile\nat it all right\nthat's what blue love gives you red love\nall kinds of aversions yeah\nall kinds of nah not that no you can't\nbe that\nuh that's not acceptable uh-uh it's got\nso many conditions yeah conditions\nyou know i say blue love is the\nunconditional love and that's where i'm\ntrying to live\nyeah you know and it's it's it's a\nheadache getting there\nyou know but that's one of the reasons\nwhy i'm looking forward to\nour trip to india yeah um you know\ni'm about to put my good my big girl\npants on because\nyou know india is one of those but yeah\ni know but you know india is one of\nthose places\nthat you got to embrace it all\nit's so it's a lot of suffering i mean\nyeah\ni have a very very difficult time\nlooking at and being confronted with\nsuffering yeah\ndefinitely and india has a special kind\nit does right and\ni am looking forward to that confront\nyou know because\nit's going to be\nthat next place within me\nto be able to that blue love i'm talking\nabout\nwhen you look at it and you understand\nthat\nin the um\nin the what i call the spiritual\necosystem yeah there can be no aversion\nno that can't you know and so\nyou know just being able to embrace it\nbut it it also has shown me\nthat that's where my codependency comes\nfrom always trying to\nprevent suffering you know what i mean\nand only to create it\nyeah exactly exactly it all went to\ncreate\nmore yes that is so interesting\nall of us wants to prevent suffering but\nactually that is what ends up\nus creating more suffering wow that is\nso i never thought about it i've created\na lot of suffering in my life\nwith people that i care about in trying\nto prevent\ntheir suffering they're suffering only\nto create more oh\nyeah it's a pain that that that's been a\njagged pill to swallow for me\nyou know but it it's lessons really\npainful lessons i've had to\nhave in order to see my codependency i\ncouldn't see it\nno yeah i was like what how do you hurt\npeople by helping you\nyeah yeah how does it make sense it\ndoesn't let me show you\nbow yeah how does that feel yeah i don't\nlike it\nthere you go yeah and that's the amazing\nthing about\nabout india what you were saying to to\ngo back a few steps was like\nindia is a place where nothing's hidden\nnothing you see someone being born on\nthe street\nand you see like people dying in\nsuffering it's like nothing's\nhidden and it's this extreme and it's\nthe extreme\nyou know yeah beauty yeah and rich you\nknow\nin india everything is right\ni mean the extremes of it all yeah\nyou know what i mean and it it it's a\nlot for me\nyeah it's a lot to have yeah you know\nbut it's\nit's it's where my lesson correct\nyou know everything everything i tried\nto like\nit's again the extreme point comes back\nto everything because it's like\nyou can push things too far yeah and you\ncan do things too soon yeah\nand and the right time doesn't really\nexist like there's never going to be a\nright time but it is\nyou know you have to take that sense\ncheck and the more self-aware you become\nyou know when you're stronger and\nreadier and you're prepared and so how\nhave you done this with\nwillow and jaden because i think you\nknow i've i've had the fortune of\nspending\nsome time with willa yeah and she's an\nold soul she is\nlike she's incredible and i've got to\nspend a little bit of time with jaden\nyeah and i\nlook at him more from afar in the work\nhe's done and i'm always telling you how\nimpressed i am and how\nhow incredible it is to see the work\nhe's doing uh for the world\nyeah and and so for me it's like how did\nyou and again like and i know you don't\nsee this when that's when i'm setting it\nup it's like i'm not asking this from\nthe point of view like jada you're\nperfect and how are the kids perfect\ni'm not i'm not asking from that\nperspective because i know you wouldn't\nwant that either right\ni'm asking it from the perspective of\nlike when i met them\nthey seem like people who are curious\nthey're they are knowledgeable for sure\nfar beyond their years but they're\nexperimenters they're open they're not\nthey're not fearful they're okay with\ngetting it wrong you know\nthere's an openness there and a\nplayfulness\nin a good way uh and and i've just been\ndeeply\nand i wouldn't even use the word\nimpressed i think i've just been so in\nawe when i'm with them and and just that\nthe humans they are\nyeah and how they connect and interact\nand and so i mean of course you should\nbe very proud that\nthey're just such unbelievable and this\nwe haven't even talked about their\ntalents no\nbut i'm talking about them as people\nyeah like how how have you\ntried and how have you and will tried so\nmuch to\ngive them the values of curiosity of\ngratitude of\nlove of kindness because they're\naspiring for these same things in their\nown ways\nyeah but they're aspiring for these\nthey're not aspiring for other stuff\nyeah from the conversations i've had\nwith them like no they're they're\naspiring for what we're talking about\nnow\nin their own way yeah um\ni i i wish i could take credit for for\nall of that\nbut they they really came to me\num you know they were given\nto me let me even change that\ni've been they were born through me\nthey aren't mine oh beautiful yeah um\nbut they came like that yeah you know\ni would have to say a lot of that is the\nblessings of the highest\nyou know and um\ni will say that will and i in regards to\nthe foundation that we created for jaden\nand willow and i'll talk about trey\nafter um\none of the gifts that my mother gave me\neven in the chaos of addiction\nwas that she stood out of my way yeah\nand i was allowed to self-actualize\nearly right\nand try a lot of things out\nyou know and and and and\nyou know win and fail by my own hand\nand will and i wanted to offer\nwe offered that to willow and jaden as\nwell they self-actualized\nyeah very early\nright uh my my belief is the greatest\ngift\nyou can give a child is to give them to\nthemselves as fast as possible\nright and that's scary too it's for a\nparent with their control\ntrying to prevent suffering i mean\nthat's why i asked it straight off\nbecause\nit's been you know and it's true you\nknow it's been really trying\nbut you have to have the courage to\nbe you know i i look at the um one of\nthose little bumpers\nthat are on the in the bowling alley oh\nyeah you put the bumpers up\nso the ball's not going to fall in the\ngutter yeah yeah yeah you're not going\nto go that far\nexactly so as they were growing up\njust realizing how close the bumpers\nneeded to be and as they got\nolder just being able to move them\nfurther further\nfurther further until now they just fell\nout\nnow they can play without it you got it\nyeah you know what i mean and\num trusting that the same\nthe same source that's that looked over\nme and has protected me is the same so\nthere's\nlet me tell you something there's no\nbetter parent\nand i got that firsthand yeah so i\nbecause of my experience because i was\nreally parented by\nwhen i didn't even know it yeah when i\nthink back on my childhood in a kind\nof crap\ni was into how many times\nhow many situations i put myself in that\nwould have\nme being here is a miracle and i'm not\njust saying that to be like on some\nwhatever right that's real talk that\ngoes for will and i both\nright and so when i started to look at\nmy life in that way\nand how i've been protected\nand the harsh lessons i had been given i\nwas like well\nthe source is a fog better parent than i\never could be\nlet me just fall back yeah and just you\nknow\nwe're gonna put these right these\nbumpers up and just witness\nyou know and and the great thing is is\nthat when\nthings get real for them they call us\nyeah\nof course and they ask of course but\nthey have that friendship with you they\nhave a friendship\nwith us both and a real trust yeah\na real trust that i'm so grateful for\nand i think it's because\ni never really treated my\nkids like children i didn't even know\nhow to do that because that's not how i\nwas raised\nyou know i just didn't you didn't i\ndidn't relate to them like that because\ni wasn't related to like that\nyou know what i'm saying like my father\nat seven told me hey listen\ni'm an addict i'm an alcoholic and i'm a\ncriminal i can't be your dad\nwow at seven right and so i had a lot of\nrespect for that\ncause i was like okay i know what it\nthank you that's seven\nat seven seven i was like oh okay okay\ncool it wasn't like oh i can't have my\ndad\nright it was like i don't know where\nyou're at i know where i right\nhe verbalized it he didn't play no games\ni\nuntil my until today\nthat's how i am if you could just be\nstraight up with me we're good\nthat's amazing you know what i mean and\nso\ni did not play games with my kids i\ndidn't really know how to be a\nkid parent yeah you didn't test him i\ndidn't yeah it wasn't like\nwho you know was just like hey listen we\nin this together mommy's gonna make some\nmistakes you know what i'm saying so\nwhat's poppin what's going on with you\nyou know what i mean\nit's like and i just kept them at my hip\nyou they went where i went\nthey would they were just at my hip\nconstantly but i didn't do\nthe like i wasn't the soccer mom i\nwasn't like the\ni was like look um mom's got a gig in\naustralia\nwe're all packing up and going to\naustralia for a year and you're rolling\nwith me\nyeah you're gonna be on set with me you\nknow what i mean\nand they you just said mommy's hit they\njust when i went on tour doing my metal\nmusic\nhey mommy's going on tour yeah we bout\nto be doing some metal stuff\n[Laughter]\nwicked wisdom yeah wicked wisdom um\nit's new experience this is gonna be\ngood for everybody\num you rolling with me so you know\nand just living life together yeah you\nknow\nand allowing them to\nexperience and express\num and make\ndecisions about their lives at very\nearly ages even like\njayden's always been a night owl could\nnever get him to go to sleep at a no\nyou still can't he would never lay down\nuntil i did\nand as he got older and you know he'd be\nworking or he had\num school or what have you i wasn't\ngoing to fight him about going to bed at\na particular time\ni just wasn't we would we would\nnegotiate how long he could play video\ngames\nyou know i remember those conversations\nyeah you know but\ni would have i would go so you know i\nsaid i want you to pay attention to\nyour um\n[Music]\nyour level of energy throughout the day\nyou know with you going i'm you go to\nbed whenever you want\nbut you have to be responsible for that\nyeah so he would\ngo to bed and then you know figure out\nhis bedtime\ntotally right so even just little things\nlike that in like eight\nseven years eight seven years old or if\nthere was a violation\nyeah you know not asking them\nwhat do you what do you think we should\ndo about if if you were the parent in\nthis situation\nhow would you handle i like that\nquestion that's a great\ni told you off the video games at eight\nyou tried to be slick\nand you played till nine yeah you\nviolated our agreement\nwhat would you do in my position\noh mommy i think\ni probably\ni'd probably tell my kid they couldn't\nplay video games for two weeks just put\nhimself into it that works for me yeah\ndoes that work for you yeah i said okay\nare we in agreement no video games for\ntwo weeks\nyeah yeah so also instead of me putting\nboundaries in on them\nteaching them how to do it for\nthemselves oh wow i love it which i\nthink is a big one\nthat's huge i mean as an adult yeah most\nof us don't know how to put boundaries\nand not trying to put shame on mistakes\nthat was another big one\ni hate it being felt\ni hated feeling like i had to have some\nkind of shame on mistakes i made as a\nchild yeah and so i really\ni always told my kids like tell me the\ntruth\nand we gonna work it out yeah and we\nalways did so i never\nhad to um\n[Music]\npunish in a certain way it was just like\nwe're gonna talk about this and then i\nwant you to tell me what boundaries you\nput on\nin on yourself yeah in an honest way\nthat's such a powerful way\nyeah there's so much self-development\nand self-growth in that for them already\nyeah i mean that's yeah that's i i look\nat my parenting and\nmy parents were always how i described\nthem with me at least\nlike until 14 it was there was a lot of\npressure there was a lot of\nuh what's the right word there was a lot\nof constraints right what it i was meant\nto be\nand then when i turned 14 for whatever\nreason i started to rebel and get stuff\nwrong and make my own mistakes\nand fight for my independence right and\nfrom that\nday on my parents started to slowly back\naway and be supportive from a distance\nyeah and that's what my parents have\nbeen since that day but that's because\nmy parents were waiting for me to be\nable to tell them that hey look i'm\nready\nnow yes i don't really want you to be\nthat for me anymore yeah and i want to\nmake my own decisions and so when people\ntalk about how was it becoming a monk or\nlike\ndoing this it's like actually it wasn't\nthat hard because my parents were just\nsupported from a distance they never\nreally\nthey've never really tried to make my\nchoices for me after 14. up until that\npoint they were\nvery involved yeah and then when they\nsaw that oh he's not gonna listen like\nhe's not\nyou know they're gonna let me and so\nit's interesting how but i love what\nyou're saying this about\nself boundaries self-discipline because\nthat's what it is it's called\nself-discipline\nyeah the only way you're discipline is\nby someone else exactly in your life\ngrowing up so you never know what\nself-discipline\nis you've actually helped your children\nlearn self-discipline\nabsolutely that's huge you talk about\nat 14 your your parents backing off yeah\njaden at 50 made a request to leave the\nhouse yeah yeah\nthat was one of the most excruciating\ndecisions i made in my life\nwas letting him lead yeah but i knew he\nneeded it\nyes i knew and i told will i said we'll\nbe\nlucky to keep him in this house till\nhe's 16. i knew that when he was three\nyeah you know what i'm saying and so at\n15\nand very respectfully\nwas like it's time for me to go i need\nto go out here and feel the rain\nand i knew he was right and i had to let\nhim go at 15.\nyeah and that's always hard for a parent\nbest decision ever yeah still yeah i\nalways knew that i mean i was in the\nrain at 12.\nyeah and i was like if he can't if he\ncan't survive the reign in calabasas at\n15.\ni was a five in the rain at 12 in\nbaltimore yeah\nyou know what i mean and so i also\nlove that i had the experiences that i\nhad in the extremes\nthat i had because i have been\nwilling to allow my kids to\nengage in life in a certain manner\nwithout being utterly fearful\nlike some parents like people say to me\nall the time you let him go at 15 like\nyeah yeah he had the resources\nhe made his own money yeah you know what\ni'm saying it's like\nyeah if he can't if he can't survive in\nin in\nyou know what's been created for him and\nwhat he's created for himself\nthen that's a beautiful way of looking\nat it yeah i'm like he i was like i\ncompletely utterly trust that he he's\ngot this yeah\nand he did yeah exactly he did and he he\nis he's cool\nyou know i love that when i'm hearing\nyou talk and everyone is listening to\nyou talk what i want everyone to realize\ntoday is\nwhat i love about when jada shares about\nwhat she's going through and going\nthrough still and what we're working\nthrough and we're working together it's\nlike\nand i don't like using this because it's\nso cliche i'm trying to find better\nlanguage for it so we can do it together\nbut it's like\nit's the real deep work like it's it's\nnot this isn't like\nthey're fluffy it's not fluffy like\nself-care like just tell yourself you\nlove yourself every day like it's not\nthat like please do not\nwhen when jd took that self-care if\nyou've listened to this episode you know\nit's not that\nlike this isn't just the like be nice to\nyourself like\nbeing nice to yourself means looking at\nall your demons and your and the pains\nand\neverything like that's what it really\nmeans to be nice to yourself like if\nyou're being nice to this room you clean\nit\nclearly you go into every corner you\ndon't just say oh you're a beautiful\nroom\nyou you clean it and you purify it in\nevery place and when you talk about red\ntable talk is the table of purification\nyeah and the table of transparency for\nme it's like what i see you doing is\neverything you're doing even hala you\nknow and so all the work that you're\ndoing now it's like\nit feels like you have infused all of\nwhat you've learned\nand grown in and you're now trying to\nshare it trying through your work\nyeah no but you i mean beautifully\nsharing it like i mean\nthe conversations you've had at the\ntable like all the work you're doing now\nit's\nit's just completely infused with\npurpose and with\nwith a desire to help but not preach\nyou're not preaching there's no\ni can't preach and you can preach you\ncan breathe\nyou can definitely preach but you're not\nyou're not doing anything you're doing\nthe most compassionate\nkind of i've only ever met this day\nthere right right so it's like for me\nwhen i'm looking at you i'm so and\nthat's what's always and i said this to\nyou and i said it to wilm\nyou know when we were together i was\nlike what what you both\ndo with your platform and the growth\nyou've had and the incredible careers\nyou have but\nthe fact that your heart is doing this\nlike to me\nthat's that's what excites me so much\nlike that's what gives me so much faith\nand hope and like\njust just so much like vigor to even do\nwhat i do\nwhen i see both of you do it and i'm\nlike despite everything you could do\nanything you wanted right now\nyou could do anything and you know that\nyou can do anything you don't have to do\nanything but you want to do this\nyeah and that just shows how important\nit is yeah i feel like\ni just feel like um\nthe more that we can share about our\njourneys\nyou know it's like because we're all\njourneying you know at some capacity\nand so it's just like i know that in my\nlife when people had the courage to\nreally talk to me\nand i'm saying really\ntalk to me yeah it helped\nchange the trajectory of my life with a\nconversation\nbut it has to come from\nreal places and experience you know\nclarissa pinkola has this um this saying\nthe the uh the well-written upon woman\nright and i look at people in that way\nit's like\npeople sometimes are so shameful or feel\nso ashamed about experiences that\nthey've had or\num things that they've done or pitfalls\nand\num i always say you have nothing to\nshare if you haven't been through\nsomething yeah\ntotally you know what i mean it would be\nsuch a boring story yeah and it's like\nthat's where we get the real deep\nlessons you know\nand i had a friend of mine who was going\nthrough a really bad divorce and\ni was telling her i was like man\njust know this there are some really\npowerful blessings on the other side of\npain\ni promise you you know if we're if we're\nwilling to\nembrace the experience in that way\nabsolutely\nyou know so amazing thank you thank you\nyou're an amazing interviewer\nis there anything that i have not asked\nyou that you wish i did\nno and you're like jay if i was seeing\nyou\nbecause you're an amazing host of\namazing interviews yeah\nthis has been great thank you as always\ngreat talking to you\nall right i mean my conversations with\nyou are by far some of my favorite\nconversations that we've had and we've\ntalked for hours\nwe have we can go that's for sure so we\nend\nevery interview the final five yep and\nthese are rapid fire questions okay you\nhave to answer in one word\nor one sentence maximum okay so we're\ngonna find this hard\nokay because we can talk\nso these are your final fines okay\nuh what's something you once took for\ngranted that you value now\npeople beautiful what's the one\nquestion you ask yourself the most\nprobably would be who are you yeah\nbeautiful okay question number three\nwhat's the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nor read or heard or been given\nlaugh now because you're gonna laugh\nlater oh okay\nruby d nice i like it okay question\nnumber four the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\nyou're like the worst advice i've ever\nreceived is from myself\nthat's beautiful yeah yeah yeah anything\nthat you say to yourself yeah\nit's like it's i've given myself some of\nthe worst advice\njesus yeah yeah just like uh\nyou know going in and showing you know\nwho's boss you know whatever\nlike all that you know it's just the\nworst advice\nthat's that's that's special though yeah\nthat's special though\nmost people will remember something bad\nthey've been told but no i've given\nmyself\nthe worst advice yes\na fifth and final question if if you\ncould give\neveryone one practice or one habit that\nthey should\npractice in 2020 every day a daily\npractice or daily habit and a simple one\nit can be anything\nwhat would you want the world to do\nstillness\nany amount of stillness you can give\nyourself whether it's five minutes\nwhether it's three hours\ngo someplace be quiet turn your phone\noff\nturn off everything and just sit in\nstillness so you can hear\nyourself right and if the longer you\nstay\nyou will hear beyond yourself\nright yes into those higher\nreach into that higher right but\nthat would be my advice just find the\ncourage to be still\nit's beautiful yeah i love that thank\nyou so much\nthank you thank you this has been so\nwonderful like\ni i feel like everything you shared\ntoday again as always was
