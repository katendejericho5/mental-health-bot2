they're not doing it\nbecause then they pay attention only to\nthe fact that you told them you're not\ndoing it\nyou're wrong it's you again and then\nthey will basically do whatever human\nbeing does which is defend themselves\nbecause nobody likes to be attacked\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that come back\nevery week to listen learn and grow\nnow i'm really excited for this\nconversation because i've been speaking\nto this guest for a while to get\nthis to happen and i'm really excited\nbecause i know that this is a theme\nand a topic and a subject that is\nsomething you have\nso many questions about psychotherapist\nand new york times best-selling author\nesther peral\nis

esther is also an\nexecutive producer and host\nof the popular podcast where should we\nbegin please give a big warm welcome to\nnone other than esther perel esther\nthank you so much for doing this\nit's a pleasure to be here it's been a\nlong time coming\ni have to say it's been it's been too\nlong and this is truly one of my\nfavorite books and i was just saying\nearlier to you\noffline that we have so many mutual\nfriends and\nyour name pops up all the time and i\ncan't believe we haven't met yet\nbut i'm i'm so looking forward to having\ndinner with you one day soon\nuh but i want to dive right in we'll\nmake it happen we will we will\nuh i want to dive right in because\ni mean relationships is just the core of\nour being in the core of our lives and\nas you know\nthey cause us so much joy but they also\ncreate can create so much pain in our\nlives\nand you know you always say the quality\nof our relationships\ndetermines the quality of our lives i\nwant to ask you\nwhen did you start to first experience\nthat when did you first start\nto notice that that i noticed it because\nthere had been such tremendous\nloss of loved ones\nof family members of my parents entire\ncommunity\nyou know because they came out of world\nwar\nii and the holocaust as the sole\nsurvivors\nthe absence of the connections was what\nhighlighted the importance of the\nconnections we talked about people who i\nwill never meet\nand have never met we talked about what\nit means to\nexperience the decimation of a community\nto be immigrants to create new community\nto make new friendships\nwhat does it feel like to love again\nwhen you've been so dehumanized what\ndoes it mean to trust again\nto play again to fall in love to make\nlove\nand i think that i would say i was four\nyears old when these conversations began\nfor me that i always thought people\npeople people you can have money you can\nhave education\nif you don't have the loved ones the\npeople the real relationships the ones\nthat make the eulogy\nand not the cv as david brooks often\ndistinguishes\nthat that is where the heart of the\nmatter lies\nyes i think i i mean it's such a\nbeautiful answer and you can see how\nhow these beautiful purpose that you\nhave today comes from so much\nuh pain in one sense and challenge and\nand these these stresses and presses and\nif anyone who's\nstresses and precious or if anyone's\nlistening or watching right now\ni hope you're hearing how you may be\ngoing through a really tough\nrelationship or a tough loss right now\nbut often that can be the birthplace of\nso much\npower and so much greatness i wanted to\nask you esther from your perspective\nwhat do you think is the biggest\nchallenges that we\nfaced for our relationships during the\nquarantine and lockdown\nbecause i feel like this is just the\nbiggest part of our lives that has been\naffected has been our relationships\nuh you know what has been the biggest\nchallenge for our relationships during\nthe quarantine\nor that you're hearing from clients\npeople you're working with\nand the communities that you're serving\nwhat are you hearing\nit's a great question i would divide it\nin three\nmain categories the first thing\nis that lockdown quarantine\npandemics disasters are relationship\naccelerators what it means is that\nwhen you deal with a massive global\nevent like this\nit puts you in touch with mortality\nwe are it is a it is a pandemic so life\nis short\nlife is fragile and so you begin to\nrearrange your priorities\nwhat truly matters who is really\nimportant\nwho are the few people i'm going to make\nsure to stay in touch with\nthe accelerator says i've waited\nlong enough i'm out of here i want\nsomething else\nthe accelerator also says what am i\nwaiting for\ni like you let's move in together\nso you get the beginnings and the\nendings really\nheightened the pandemic also highlighted\nall the cracks that existed in the\nrelationships\nbut also highlighted all the lights that\nshines through the cracks\nin the relationship so people got to\nreally experience their strengths\nbut also their challenges with each\nother\nthe pandemic highlighted how much when\nyou live with a partner\nyou have a rhythm you know you move away\nfrom each other you leave for the day\none of the people travels both people\ntravel you come back it's like an\naccordion you expand you get some air\nyou get\ninput from the world and then you come\nback together here\npeople who live together were 24 7 on\ntop of each other\nwith no air now you know i've written\nmating in captivity\nto say that fire needs air this was\nmating in captivity to quarantine\naddition\nnowhere at all coming into the\nrelationships people\nneeding to flatten the curve and ending\nup flatlining themselves\nthen what lacked as what was missing as\nwell is that a relationship\ndances between the need for security and\nstability\nand the need for novelty and exploration\nand risk-taking\nand experiences and we could not do any\nof that this year we had to completely\nstifle the erotic the erotic in the\nsense of what makes us feel alive\ncuriosity\nadventures novelty change risk taking\nthat whole side of us had to be shut\ndown so that we could feel stable\nsecure and safe and that made people\nreally feel\nthat the life the energy was being\nsiphoned out of their\nexperiences and out of their\nrelationships and for those of us who\nwere alone\nthis prolonged isolation with the\nprolonged uncertainty about how long the\nisolation will even last\nreally was crippling to people the\ndegree of loneliness degree of longing\nthe degree of touch hunger that people\nhave experienced i don't think we've\neven\nbegun to understand the long-term\neffects of all of that and this is just\ntalking about adults\ni haven't even begun to talk about what\nthis has done to the little ones\nthat live with us that is such a great\nanalysis that is without doubt the best\nanalysis i've heard of how the\nquarantine has affected our\nrelationships thank you so much for that\ni think i was listening and i was just\nnodding\nthe whole time i was like that is so\ntrue that is so true and i'm sure\neveryone who's listening is feeling the\nsame way\nuh you know when we think about\nrelationships\nduring these times of extreme pressure\nthere are those of us\nthat are trying to be the perfect\npartner the perfect parent\nthe perfect person at this time and\nthere are those of us that are just so\noverwhelmed\nthat we can't even feel like we're\ngetting ourselves together\nwhichever side you're on from that\nperspective\nhow do you approach a relationship at\ntimes of pressure\nwhat is an effective way to approach\nrelationships\nat times that are completely unexpected\ncompletely\nyou know no one could have predicted\nthis was going to happen what do you\nwhat are you meant to do at that time\nwhat's the right thing to do if there is\none\nwell i will start by saying that the\nwriting if you want to call it like that\nis certainly not to try to be perfect\nand to think about optimization at all\ntime there is other things\nyou know i did a whole season for the\npodcast where should we begin\non couples under lockdown couples in\nnigeria\nin sicily germany in new york that were\nin the middle of\napril and may but this could still be\ntoday this is not\npasse at all about what were the\ntensions that they were experiencing\nwhat were the\nthe questions so you had the couple that\nis on the verge of divorce and that\nsuddenly has to be together just as one\nperson is about to move out\nand basically they have to just be civil\nthey don't have to be perfect they just\nhave to be kind\nthen you have the couple in sicily where\nthe woman goes to work in the hospital\nand the husband suddenly became the\nfront-line parent with three young\nchildren\nand every time she comes back from the\nhospital she's just afraid that she's\ngoing to contaminate them and she scrubs\nherself so that she\ncan protect her family because she is as\nwe've come to call her\nan essential worker then you have the\ncouple who was separated for a year and\na half\nand suddenly in the pandemic she says\ncome back\nyou know and they realized that they\nreally didn't have a really good reason\nto separate that in fact they had\nso much more to to stay together so\nthe stories are very very it's not\none thing but if i was to say what are\nsome of the things that have helped\npeople\nbecause i think that's what you're\nasking right what is help people\nbe together in the in the better way\npossible\ni would say three things have been\nextremely useful actually\nfour one is boundaries the loss of\nboundaries\nthat we have experienced especially when\nyou sit at the same table\nand all your roles mother teacher parent\nlover friend sister of daughter of\nboss you name it are all in the same\nspot\nwithout any delineation you don't know\nwhere one thing stops and the other\nthing starts\nboundaries boundaries between work and\nhome\nboundaries between the table that is\nused as an office\nand the table that becomes the dinner\ntable boundaries between weekdays and\nnights\nyou know just boundaries to recreate\nstructure and then routines\npeople really needed to stay connected\nto their routines new ones that they\ncreated\nyou know old ones that they really like\nthese routines became\na marker of continuity of stability of\nconsistency\nand then rituals rituals that people\ncreated\nyou know i always say if you cook every\nday it's a routine it means you have to\neat\nbut if you actually suddenly make a very\nnice table and you pretend that your\nkitchen has become your favorite bistro\nthen you have turned the routine into a\nritual the routine says we need to eat\nthe ritual says there's something\nspecial between us\nand these small\nthree categories of events have been\nextremely\nhelpful in people being able to be with\neach other\nyou know and with the people that they\nstayed connected with in their pods\nadd to that kindness just civility\nnot perfection when somebody brings you\ncoffee you can be very nice and just say\nthanks for bringing the coffee\nbut you can do even better when you say\nthanks for being such a thoughtful\nperson\nand especially at a time of isolation\nwhen you don't have 20 other people that\ncan give you feedback and the person\nthat gives you feedback is the one\nthat's\nall the time right there with you with\nwhom you have to suddenly do all those\nthings at the same time\nit's very important to feel that they\nget you\nthey see you and you're not just a\nfunction\nbecause those are the validations that\nwe get when we leave home as well\nand here we suddenly asked one person to\nreplace an entire community\nthat's incredible that those are such\ngreat tips rituals\nroutines and boundaries uh\nthree really really powerful steps and i\nknow that when\ni was thinking about at the beginning of\nthe pandemic me and my wife had to reset\nour new expectations and boundaries of\neach other\nof our space of our home and what's one\nway you did this\nwhat's one of the ways that you think\nyou made a\ntweak that really was helpful so\none of the things that me and my wife\ndid was she said to me that now we're\njust living in the same spaces\ni need to make sure that i feel that\nyou're helping this space remain\nwhat the space is so she was like you\nknow before we would leave our laptop\nout or we would leave our\ntrainers or our sneakers in the living\nroom because we were going to the gym or\nwhatever she was like\nnow that we're enclosed we need to make\neach space\nfeel like the space that it is because\nwe no longer have the freedom that we're\ngoing out to the gym or that we're\ngoing out to see a friend so we need to\nmake sure that we're cleaner that we're\ntidier\nthat we're making sure that we're\nputting everything away now we're not\nordering food we're not going out to\nrestaurants\nso we need to make sure that we've\ncleaned up everything straight\nafterwards it's very basic things\nbut these things often get lost when\nyou're all going through your own\npressure and stress\nand to me those simple resetting of\nexpectations and boundaries\nwas so useful we also made a rule that\nwe wouldn't\nwe would only work in certain areas of\nour home so\nshe had her work area and i had my work\narea in the beginning\nwe were both on the same dining table\ntaking both of our phone calls\nand trying to get the other person to be\nquiet and it wasn't working\nand so for me it was integral that we\nhad that conversation but here's the\ninteresting esther that i wanted to ask\nyou\nis when couples are having those\nconversations\nthey think it's bad we get worried we\nthink oh no my partner should just know\nthis they should\nthey should just understand this and we\nalmost get scared when we're having\nconversations like that\nbecause we think that we should just\nknow we should just be aware\nhow do we get beyond this false idea\nwe've created that difficult\nconversations\nshow weakness when actually difficult\nconversations help build strength\nyou just said it you know difficult\nconversations\nwhen you get through them um\nyou feel emboldened you feel more\ntrusting and you feel more confident\nyou know the one time where the other\nperson\nknows what you need what you want what\nyou care about\nwithout having to say anything is when\nyou're in utero\nbefore you're born and just as soon as\nyou're after you're born you know\nafter that the whole your whole life\nis a dialogue in which you begin to\nexpress\nyour thoughts your wishes your needs\nyour hurts and you begin to intuit what\nother people need from you\nwe are relational creatures the only\ntime where somebody guesses for you is\nwhen you're a baby\nand you can cry and then there is five\nthings which the\ncaregiver can decide is probably what\nyou need\num i think what you did was it looked\nsmall\nbecause if you think about this as the\nlaptop you know\nand the shoes it it and you think that\nit's about the shoes\nthen it looks you know trivial but you\nmiss the point\nbecause what you're really doing is you\nare creating\nan awareness of the other you say we are\nboth people here\nwe each have things that we need to do\nwe have to show up i respect your work\nyou respect mine i am aware of your\npresence i don't pretend you're not here\ni think of you even when you're not\nthere i know what you care\nwhat you m what matters to you and what\nyou care about even when you're not\ntelling it to me because you've told it\nto me before i carry you inside of me\nand vice versa it's that the\nconversation if you think that it's\nabout the shoes you miss the point\nthe shoes are a representation the shoes\nthe stuff you know the table all of\nthese things\nand in addition to why it is important\nis because\nit says where you stop and where the\nother person starts\nand that sense of boundary is extremely\nimportant because every relationship\nis made up of my relationship to myself\nas i am with you\nand my relationship with you while i\ndon't lose myself\nit's both and it's how i hold on to me\nand how i hold on to you\nvice versa how i hold on to you without\nlosing me\nand how i hold on to myself without\nlosing you that's the dance\nand this conversation that you are\nhaving with your wife is\nall about that and when you put it this\nway it's no small feat\nyeah absolutely i love how you unpack\nthat it's so much more\ndeeper and it has so much more of a true\nimpact on each other when it's performed\nin that way\ni'm sure there are a lot of people\nlistening right now as they're going\nyou know what i'm doing all of that but\nmy partner is not\nresponding right like they're not\nputting they're not thinking about me\nthey're not aware of my presence\nthey are priorities prioritizing their\nwork\nthey are not being aware and being\nconscious and being intentional when\nsomeone is feeling that way this is\nprobably the number one question you get\nasked\nalways but when someone is feeling that\nway that they're doing everything they\ncan they're trying to\nclean up and do this and do that but the\nother person doesn't respond\nwha what happens what what do you do in\nthat situation\nwell there's a few things you do see the\nbeauty\nof couples is that you have another\nperson to blame\nand to think it is it's a it's\nunavoidable it's irresistible\ni am doing my share you're not you know\nit's like when people come to couples\ntherapy\nthey come to my office and they often\ncome to tell me\nhere's my partner let me tell you what's\nwrong with them fix it\nyou know and fundamentally\ni mean it's a drop-off center you know\nthere is a reality in which this is the\none of the\nthe hidden truths of relationships if\nyou want to change the other\nchange yourself if you continuously go\nand say to the other person you're not\ndoing you're not listening\ni keep asking you why don't you pay\nattention etc\nyou're going to get the same response\nyou're going to get defensiveness you're\ngoing to get what about you\nyou're going to get tit for that etc etc\nif you want to call the attention of the\nother person\nmaybe there's a way in which you\nactually think to yourself\nwhat's different way i can say this\nhow do i remind the person that when we\npay attention to each other things are\nmuch better\nhow do i make a request that doesn't\nturn into a protest\nmeaning instead of criticizing the other\nperson\ntell them what you want and tell them\nwhat you don't without\nimplying that they're not doing it\nbecause then they pay attention only to\nthe fact that you told them you're not\ndoing it\nyou're wrong it's you again and then\nthey will basically do whatever human\nbeing does which is defend themselves\nbecause nobody likes to be attacked so\nthe temptation is to say how do i make\nmy partner different\nand i say start with the one thing you\ncan control\nis is there anything i can do different\nthat is more likely to elicit\na different response from my partner\nit's the one thing you can control is\nyou start there\nyeah great advice great advice and\nand you're so right about the blaming\nyou know we're always looking for\na in in any scenario and and often you\nknow i want to be empathetic and\ncompassionate that it can be true\nsometimes that you could be doing\neverything you possibly could and\nsomeone is not conscious or\nfocused but then again it comes back to\nwhat you just said which is you still\nneed to go and do what's right for you\nand and do what's best for you if you\nneed to feel connected and loved you may\nspend more time with family or more time\nwith your friends or\nspend more time on the phone to get that\nfuel you need now\nmoving forward esther i know a lot of\npeople are struggling with what you call\nre-entry anxiety right the idea that\nwe're entering back into the workplace\nwe're entering back into\ndating we're going back into being\nin person uh you know what are the\nsymptoms\nof that re-entry anxiety that people are\nfeeling that you so beautifully\nexplained and have coined\nand also how can we start what are the\nsk\nactually this is the question i want to\nask what are the skills that we lost\nin the pandemic and what are the skills\nwe gained\nbecause i think people are unaware of a\nbeautiful question right it's like we we\ngained some really good people skills\nduring the pandemic and we lost some too\ntelling me about the re-entry anxiety\nand what we lost and gained\ni think that what many people have\nexperienced\nwell there's a range there's people who\nhave experienced acute\nloneliness and they have been talking\nway too much with themselves\nthey've heard their own echo they're in\nan you know in an echo chamber me and me\nand for them suddenly hearing\nthe real voices of others can be quite\nuh shocking then you have people who\nhave reduced their part\nand basically the acquaintances have\ndissipated\nand they have really stayed in touch\nwith a few\nimportant social ties for them\nthe reentry is you know oh god\ni'm meeting you shall we hug do we kiss\nvaccinated test it\nyou know what's the protocol do i trust\nyou\ndo you tell you know are you just saying\nthis because you know we're here at this\ngathering together or is this really\ntrue\nyou know what's the what what can i ask\nyou know\nso that's the first thing then there is\nare you huggable that's a question\nmany people are asking are you huggable\nbecause we arrive with this\nyou know i haven't held you i haven't\ntouched you in so long\nyou know and the hugs that you see\npeople do it's just like usually you see\nthem at airports when people come back\nfrom many years\nof not having seen their loved ones you\nknow and they hold each other for their\nlife like that\nthen there is you know how\nthe fact is basically many of us have\nonly seen each other from the chest up\nfor a year and a half you know what's it\nlike to suddenly be\nembodied just fully embodied you know\nwe can't hide in the same way and then\nyou know what is the chat gonna sound\nlike\nchat is a four-letter word what's the\nchat gonna be when i see you\nso i see you and for the first time we\nactually\nhave a whole different range of\nconversations every gathering where i've\ngone\nso far where people are meeting it's\nlike oh this is my first time\ni haven't seen that many people in a\nlong time i'm so i\nhungered for this or this is weird i've\nnot been so close to so many people in a\nlong time i don't know how close i can\ncome to them\nyou know there is all these experiences\nthat people are talking about where were\nyou\nwere you with your family were you with\nyour loved ones how was it for you\nand you know what were the important\nmoments have you lost anyone\nis everybody okay you know and when it's\nwhen\nloss could be loss of your plans your\nweddings your birthdays your\nanniversaries loss of\nfamily members loss of income loss of\nyour apartment\nloss in the multiple sense of the world\nyou know\nand i think that's what people are\nexperiencing in the re-entry\nis what is okay to talk about how do we\ndeepen the conversation people are\nslightly less in the mood to be just\non the surface completely and you know\ni had a very interesting experience\nabout this because\ni during this pandemic at one point i\njust began to feel like i\nmiss my friends i miss being you know\nyou know in my other homes and abroad\nand\nand i thought you know i'm writing about\nplayfulness\nbut i'm but i want to create something\nplayful i\ni want i miss my dinner parties how am i\ngoing to do something\nof that sort and i kept noticing\nyou know there's very little surprise\nthere's very little\nyou know mystery unknown the unknown is\nbasically something you worry about and\ni thought i'm going to create\na game you know i i want to actually\ncreate\na game that reconnects us with our\nstorytelling\nit was it was and what i ended up doing\nbecause all of this i did on zoom i came\nup with\na thousand questions on zoom but it was\nall zoomed so you can't play\nplaying is me looking at you that smile\nyou know that mischief that\nit's all this and so i brought friends\ntogether in a pod\nthat i've known for 25 years and we\nbasically started to play test every\nnight after dinner\njust what what are the really important\nconversations we want to have what are\nthe stories we feel we need to tell\nand it was it was very\nmoving actually it was like um\nyou could see so\nwe a social atrophy you know when\nthere's a social muscle you haven't used\nfor a long time\nand slowly it opens up\nit loosens it strengthens and people\nare laughing and sharing and asking\nquestions\nand building on the stories of others\nand basically recreating social threats\nthat's i think what we are going to do\nin this re-entry at this moment\nand um basically i you know it\nit the question was always the same\nwhere should we begin\nyou know and uh and it was like i want\nto know about this\ntell me about that you know yeah what\nare some of your favorite questions from\nthe game where should we begin can we\ncan we\nplay or try to play some part of it so\nthat we can\nand then you can let my audience know\nwhere they can find the game so that\nthey can actually\nuh get it and play it too i'd love i'd\nlove for them to have that\nit's really a game it's not just\nquestions and yes so\nin the game there are prompts because i\nwas thinking this is what happens at my\ndinner party\nhow do i i need this like i want to feel\nthat thing and generally you have a tone\nat a dinner party right like you\nset an intention when we started so you\ncan have\nthere's a set of prompt cards the prompt\ncards basically\ncan say share something that nobody\nknows or that change your world view\nor that is embarrassing or that was\nheartbreaking or that you would never\ntell your mother\nthat's the prompt that's the emotional\nlens with which i'm gonna then\nput a card in front of you a rule that i\nsecretly love to break\nnow imagine that you get the thing\nsomething embarrassing\nand i put in front of you the card a\nrule that you secretly\nlove to break because we all all the\nplayers put a card in front of the\nstoryteller\nit's a it's a game where there is one\nstoryteller at the time\na phone number that i would like to\ndelete\n[Laughter]\nyeah everybody has some phone numbers\nthat kind of linger with them in their\nlife you know\nif i wasn't working as\ni would be a if you caught me at my\nfridge\nwith the door open in the middle of the\nnight you would catch me\nyes my most irrational fear is\nand it is a combination between the\nprompt cards\nand the story cards and then we have\ncoins so that if you want to evade my\nquestion i can\nimpose on you push you to answer the\nquestion that i want\nyou know and then you have deeper\nquestions you know i've never told you\nthe story\ni've never told you the whole story\nabout everybody has stories that they\nhave fudged\nyou know and what is it like my guilty\npleasure is if i could change something\nabout the way that i was raised\nyou know or i'm most judgmental when it\ncomes to\nand then we go a level deeper a dream\nthat i've never shared out loud\na blind spot that i have a mistake that\ni will never make again\nor i haven't told anyone about the time\nwhen\nand then we have a whole set of\nquestions around sexuality and intimacy\nyou know a text message that i fantasize\nsending\ni wish that somebody had told me x about\nsex\nmy sex life was never the same after and\na sexual situation that i have always\nwanted to try\nso you can play the sex cards or you can\ntake them out if you play with\ncolleagues\nbut basically what i tried to do i\nthought what are the many dimensions of\nmy\nlife what do i want people to ask me\nabout\nand what am i curious about and we all\nhave a storyteller inside of us and\nanybody who has ever been a child knows\nthat one of our greatest pleasure was\nsomeone telling us a story before we go\nto bed\nyes i love that i'm so glad where can\npeople find the game if they want to go\nand get it i know i'm going to order it\nstraight after this\nthe game will come out in june\nit will be called where should we begin\nlike the podcast a game of stories\nokay and when it is out j i promise i\ntell you and then you can tell\nyour entire community but it will be\navailable directly through my website\nwhere should we begin\nokay perfect we'll we'll make sure that\nwe put the link\nin the comments when the episode goes\nout and then when it's available because\nthat sounds and i thought of it as a\nre-entry game it's a game for connecting\nand reconnecting that because i i\neverybody's asking me what do we talk\nabout what are the conversations we can\nand i just said let me create it because\ni i see it in my office\ni see it on the housework podcast as\npeople are going back to work and\nall the work related questions and yes\none thing is love\none thing is work what happens when\npeople start to go back to work right\nnow and\nand and you know\nand all what that evokes in us and i\njust thought okay\nlet me let me select\num but the thing that was so important\nwas the shift between the time when i\ndid it on\nzoom and then doing it in person and\nthen doing it with strangers and doing\nit with people who i\nthought i knew or who we thought we knew\neach other and to realize\nhow much we still had to discover\nyeah i think that that's one of the\nthings about friendships\nlove relationships is how do we remain\nreally curious\nyeah i love that i'm so glad that you\ndesigned a game around it i always think\ni always think people approach these\nconversations feeling it's very heavy\nand they feel like it's going to be\nquite stressful and they think it's\ngoing to be like really weird and then\nwhen you have a game it's like all of a\nsudden you know we drop our guard we\nwe start laughing we get playful i love\nthat i i i can't wait to play it myself\nand i've been saying the same i was i\nwas doing a corporate\nkeynote recently and i was speaking to\nan executive\nuh who was briefing me on you know what\ni would be talking about and what the\naudience was like i know you do lots of\ncorporate speaking as well\nso it was one of those briefing calls\nand\nhe asked me a question he said he said\nto me jay what's the coolest thing that\nyou've done in the last seven days\nand all of a sudden i was so alert and\nfresh\nbecause no one had asked me a question\nlike that for\ni don't can't remember the last time i\nanswered a question like that most\nquestions are like\nhow are you how's your day going you\nknow\nit's the usual stuff and the small talk\nand as soon as he asked me that all of a\nsudden like i felt alive\nand so i can only imagine that your game\nwill do the same thing and the other\nthing was\ni was encouraging a lot of people to ask\nmore interesting questions because\notherwise of course the people in your\nlife are boring\nright we ask them boring questions so\nhow can people be interesting\nand i was also encouraging people to\nlook i want to repeat this\ni want to repeat this if you ask boring\nquestions\nyou will feel that people are boring\nyeah if you ask\nyou know interesting questions questions\nthat\nbreed energy in you like you just\ndescribed with this guy\nyou ex you receive a completely\ndifferent person right in front of you\ntotally really crucial i actually came\nalive\nand even the idea of and i was going to\nsay with your beautiful painting or\nartwork you have behind you\ni was encouraging people to be more\ncurious\nabout what they see in the zoom coil\nwith people so i was sitting with\nanother client\nand he had a paintbrush hanging on his\nwall\nbehind him like you're speaking to me\nnow and and he he was a he was a\ncorporate client and he had a paintbrush\ni don't know him that well\nand i said hey look i don't want to be\ncreepy or weird i'm just\nintrigued i'm curious i've never seen a\npaintbrush on someone's wall can you\ntell me where it's from\nand and he started laughing and and he\nsaid to me said oh you know what no one\never asked me that\nand and i was like all right well do you\nmind telling me and he said i have it\nthere\nbecause my first ever job he's probably\nin his 50s now\nhe said my first ever job when i was\naround 14 years old\nis i used to paint fences and paint\nwalls and paint\nhomes and so this paintbrush reminds me\nof where i started\nand and you know it just opened up and\nthen i told him what i did as my first\njob i used to be a paperboy and deliver\nnewspapers in my area\nand it just was such a refreshing\nconversation\nthat i'm still talking about it right\nnow and so i can't\ni can't wait for people to play you know\nwhere should we begin it's\nit sounds wonderful i just wanted to\nshare those with you because i\ni can't i couldn't agree with you more\nobjects are super important\nobjects tell stories you know i ask in\nmany sessions\nbring an object that represents the part\nof your relationship\nthat you would like to to harness to\ndevelop further\nto maintain and bring an object that\nrepresents a part of your relationship\nthat you would like to let go now it can\nbe your relationship with your partner\nit can be your relationship to money it\ncan be your relationship to sex\nbut objects are wonderful catalysts you\nknow you start to talk people bring\nthings i did a conference this year on\non sex\ndeath and money and for each one people\nbrought objects that represented\nthe relationship the taboo to death to\nsex and to money\nthe stories that people with the caption\nthe objects that they chose\nit is it was a book it really was a book\nso this brush is very telling\neverybody has a brush everybody has a\nversion of that brush\ni love that thank you so much i i how\ncan uh yeah how can\ncan people be encouraged to try out that\nactivity at home to think about what\nobject\nrepresents their thought around sex\ndeath or money and\nand what does that indicate for them oh\nyou know when people did\ntheir relationship the biggest one was\nthe relationship to money actually\ninterestingly surprising to me i thought\ndeath or sex would be way bigger\npeople had it went from you know\na checkbook because my father lost all\nhis money and could never pay his bills\nto a pair of shoes that represented\neither the shoes i would never allow\nmyself to buy\nthe shoes i finally felt i deserved to\nbuy because i've worked so hard\nthe shoes that i've never dared wearing\nbecause they were so expensive i've kept\nthem in the box\nand the shoes i continue to wear while\nthere are holes in it because i don't\nfeel like i deserve to get new ones\nshoes were very important wow\nyou know about money you know the ring\nthe ring that i received you know for a\nwedding that marriage that lasted for a\nyear or two so people told stories of\nhomelessness of destitution of hard work\nof of of intergenerational legacies\ninside the family around what was lost\nand what was gained\ni mean that's it a little object\ntold stories of generations\nso you can do this at a table with a\nsmall part with your friends\nthere's a few of them actually in the\ncard game as well but\nbasically bring an object that\nrepresents what you discovered most\nabout this year for example what was\nmost important to you this year\nbring an object you know and what you\nwill notice have done that one people\nhave brought\nthings that involve baking because\nthey've been baking why what was that\nsourdough thing\nit's not the bread it's the fact that\npeople needed to create something\npeople needed something from nothing\nthat became something it's an antidote\nto death when you bring\nsomething into the world creativity\nthings like that\npeople brought things related to nature\npeople brought things related to\npainting writing you know art and the\nimportance of art\nto pets and to children because children\nwere the ones who could remain\nimaginative you know they put three\nbooks on the floor and it becomes a rock\nthat's beautiful i love those examples\nespecially the shoes i\ni'm gonna go and uh try that out with my\nwife later on and see what we would pick\nuh for each i love that tell me esther\none of the things that i see\na lot of my closest friends go through\nand experience\nis that they're all you know they're\ndoing well for themselves that they're\nsuccessful they're\nin their own way but they have this\ndesire to be in love and often they fall\nin love\ntoo fast or they fall for someone very\nquickly\nonly for that to end very quickly as\nwell\nuh they have this rush to want to find\nthat right person and when they think\nthey've found someone they're all in and\nthen\nwithin a month things are kind of going\nbackwards again\nwhat is the intention or the mindset\nwith which one should approach\nlove and relationships when seeking out\na partner today\nwe have guides on how to have the\nperfect\nuh online dating profile and how to put\nthe perfect caption to describe how you\nlook and how you\nwhat you like and what you're looking\nfor and what you're interested in\nwhat really should be going on in that\npreparing for a relationship and love\nphase\ni have bad news for your friends i'd\nrather you tell them than me\nso uh get it\nyou know i i've been working for uh\nalmost 40 years now helping people with\nyou know\nthe challenges of their relationships\nthe first thing i would say\nis love is a verb\nit's not a permanent state of enthusiasm\nit's not about finding the right person\nit's about\nbeing the right person you know if you\njust want to be dazzled\nyou will have an adventure you will be\ninfatuated\nyou will fall in love you will have a\nlove story maybe\nbut you won't have a life story and a\nlife story\nis different from a love story the many\nlove stories that are never becoming\nlife stories you know people have had\nbeautiful things experiences with others\nof a few days or of a few years for that\nmatter but\nthey don't really integrate to become a\nlife\nand a life has more than just a feeling\nof love it's to build something\nit's sometimes to raise children\ntogether it's sometimes to bury parents\ntogether\nit's sometimes to deal with illnesses\ntogether it's sometimes to move\ncountries and migrate together it's\na lot of other experiences that make a\nlife it's building a business\nlosing a business or building a second\none after the first one\ndid very well all of that if you\njust think of it as i see you and i have\nbutterflies inside of me\nand then after a few months i see you\nand i don't feel the same intensity\nanymore\ni'm sorry to say but your conception of\nwhat is love\nis not one that will give you that what\nyou are looking for\nyeah so so well said and\ni love that idea of i think so much\nwe're always about like does this\nfeel right and does this feel good\nand i've been thinking about that a lot\nlately i've been thinking how i'm not\ni'm and i'm still trying to\ninvestigate this thought i'm not this is\nnot something i'm\nsure about i'm i'm sharing it as a\nmm-hmm\nas an experiment and it's the idea of\njust i'm not sure\nif asking myself how i feel\nis always the right question\nbecause sometimes you feel like doing\nsomething and sometimes you don't feel\nlike doing something but it's often\nthe times when you show up even when you\ndon't feel like doing something\nthat something builds something is\ncreated there's\nthere's something there's more of a\npossibility an opportunity\nso i'm just investigating that thought\nrecently around\nhow people go from feeling madly in love\nto then feeling out of love when\nactually they were never\nin love in the first place like you\nrightly said they may have had a life\nstory\nor love is love is something that you\nactively cultivate\nyes you nourish it you do things that\nexpress it\nthat show the other person that you're\nthinking of them\nthat they're important to you that you\ncarry them inside of you even when\nthey're not there i mean\nto just think you know it's an in or\nout it's very very narrow\nnow the other thing is when you say you\nknow\nhow do i feel i think it's a very\nimportant question to ask\nbut it is one of many questions our\nemotional\nlife is one narrative then we also have\na values life\nhave i acted right have i done according\nto my principles\nhave that have i done right by virtue of\nthis person\nto whom i owed something you know you\ndon't always feel like going to the gym\nbut you rarely regret afterwards because\nit feels good\nso sometimes the feeling comes after the\nact that's it not always as a preceding\nof the act\nand then sometimes it's not how do i\nfeel but\nuh what am i thinking that is coloring\nthe way that i feel\nso you have behaviors actions thoughts\nfeelings and then you have a spiritual\ndimension to what you do as well\nand to just sit with the emotional truth\nas the only truth i think we miss\na few other parts of life we miss the\nvalues we miss the morality and we miss\nthe spiritual\nand all four are part of our life this\nis why i love doing this podcast i don't\nhave to investigate that thought anymore\nyou just answered the question for me\nyou just\nyou gave me exactly what i was looking\nfor that is such a brilliant answer and\ni i love how you explained the idea that\nand that's kind of what i was\ntrying to think about and i was playing\nwith was the idea that sometimes you\nhave to do something and you get the\nfeeling afterwards\nand working out is def you spoke my\nlanguage that's for me\nuh i i say to my wife every time i get\nback from tennis which is what i do to\nexercise\ni say to my wife i say never let me miss\na tennis lesson every time i get back i\nalways tell her never let me miss a\ntennis lesson\nbecause i always feel phenomenal when i\nget back but in the morning if i'm not\nfeeling up to it\nyou know my mind can trick me and so we\nhave to remind ourselves so that's such\na brilliant answer\nesther what you've you know you've\nadvised couples for so long you've\nworked on relationships you've seen\nevery different type of relationship\nwhen you've really looked at the heart\nand the core of it\nwhat are the deepest truest\nmost root reasons that relationships\nfail\nwhat what is it at the heart of it like\nyou said you've unpacked everything so\ndeeply today\nwhat is that deep root of why\nrelationships fail\ni haven't thought about that but i'm\ngonna say that invert in light of what\nyou just said\ni what i did when i answered you is\nshare a thought\ni i never think i'm right i sound very\nconfident but that doesn't mean that i\nknow\nthis is how i think of it today and if\nyou come back and we have another\nconversation\ni may answer the very same question\ndifferently and i think that that's very\nimportant for all our listeners here\nto these are not questions that have a\nblack and white answer\nand it's so important to be able to hold\nnuance and ambiguity\nwhen we think about these things so when\nyou ask me what are the\nkillers of a relationship i do turn to\nthe work of john gottman very much\ni would add a few but you know he talks\nabout the four horses of apocalypse\nand one thing is criticism\nthis constant negative sentiment\noverride\ncriticism and that's why i said before\nremember\nbehind many criticisms is a wish\nask for the wish don't give the\ncriticism or you will never get the wish\nlove to stonewalling stonewalling\nyou know and that lets the other person\njust feel like they don't exist they can\ntalk they can weep they can scream\nthey can even hit you and there is no\nanswer there is no answer\nthe third one is defensiveness i can't\nsay anything\nthat you don't answer defensively you\nnever own anything you don't take\nresponsibility for your actions it's all\nabout blaming the other\nor externalizing and it's always\neverybody else's fault and everybody\nevery other circumstance that made me do\nand i'm just a victim\nand i've never done anything and then\nthe big one the fourth one is contempt\nand i that's considered the killer of\nthem all contempt\nbecause when i am contemptuous i look\ndown upon you\ni despise you i belittle you i diminish\nyou\ni devalue you and i basically do one of\nthe most important things is i take away\nyour meaning\nand we are creatures of meaning we want\nto know that if i'm here or if i'm not\nhere there's a difference\ni matter and if you manage to make me\nfeel like i matter none\nthat one is the you know the real\nzinger so i think these four basically\nsum up uh the death of a relationship\ni can give you smaller ones smaller ones\nyou know\nthat that i'm that because not everybody\nis at that end\nso the smaller ones for me are\ncomplacency\nfreaking complacency people would never\nyou know you have a lot of entrepreneurs\nand a lot of people who\ndo their best at work when that listen\nto you\nand most of these people would never\ntreat their clients the way they treat\ntheir partners\nthey give the best to their clients and\nthey give a smither\nof that attention to their partners or\nto the people at home with them\nthat laziness complacency\nlack of curiosity just\nroutine management inc i do this\nyou do that and when is the last time we\nactually looked at each other and\nchecked in with each other and said and\nhow are you today\nnot how was your day how are you today\nbecause i think of you you know that and\nthat\nis the many many couples that come to\ncouples therapy feeling like the life\nhas been siphoned out of the\nrelationship\nso then when they say i mean i still\nlove you but i'm not\nin love with you or i feel like you know\nwe have nothing to tell each other or\nit's kind of a dead end between us i say\nwhat are you doing to enliven yourself\nwhat do you do that brings energy and\nand aliveness and vitality and curiosity\nif you do none of this it's like leaving\nsomething in the fridge for months on\nend it dries up\n[Music]\nwell sad so well sad i i love all of\nthose examples and i think\nthe interesting thing about the first\nfour that you mentioned also\nis that like you said behind the\ncriticism is a wish\nand often behind the stone walling is\njust a genuine desire for space\nbut when you don't express that and you\ndon't communicate that\nof course the other person thinks you're\njust ghosting them and that it's about\nthem\nthat's right and and as you can see that\nbehind each of our behaviors\nthere is a deeper desire that may be\ngenuine and maybe necessary and even\nbehind your contempt\nthere's some sort of internal contempt\nthat's that's bringing that out there's\nsome sort of\ninternal criticism that's going on and\nand you know it's okay\nit's so crazy because when you hear it\nit sounds so simple and it sounds\nso obvious but one of the things that's\nreally helped me and my wife is\ni i do this thing where i i and i really\nliked what you said about how we treat\nour clients\ni try and do this check-in thing with\nher all the time and i'll be like how do\nyou think our relationship's going\nyou know and i i always ask her that\nquestion how do you think our\nrelationship's going like what you know\nwhat do i need to improve what do you\nthink you need to improve what are you\nworking on whatever i'm working on\nand it's funny because you never do that\nupdate or status update with your\npartner because\nyou like you you just assume that you've\nalready made the decision and now it\nstayed\nthat's right we married and now the\nthing is just going to go on like that\nfor 30 years\non rolls on wheels as i mean it is a\nvery strange the\nthe type of exceptionalism that people\nthink about when they think about\nmarriage or committed relationship this\nnotion that\nyou know that you made the decision at\n25 20\n35 and this thing is just going gonna go\non with you\nintact i mean it is really strange\nit is such a strange thing but it's\nsomething we all we all live with i\ni know so many people who have\nunfortunately\nexperienced infidelity or been cheated\non and you know you write about this\nas i said this is one of my favorite\nbooks uh that you've written i highly\nrecommend it to anyone i mean i\nrecommend any of esther's books uh\nwe'll put the link in the comments um\nwhen you're\nworking with people who've been through\nthat a lot of people\ntake it so personally that it demolishes\nthem and destabilizes them\nfor the future what parts of it do you\ntake personally\nand what parts of it do you distance\nfrom how do you respond to that\nexperience and i know that it's case by\ncase but\nhow do you know which parts of it you\nshould\nuse to improve versus how do you know\nwhich parts of it\nyou shouldn't i think that my\nfirst entry with you into this topic\nwould be this if i ask\nyou have a huge vast audience that is\ncurrently listening to us\nhave you been affected by the experience\nof infidelity in your life\neither because you had a child whose\nparent was unfaithful or who left\nfor another partner either because you\nare yourself the child of an illicit\nlove story either because you have been\nunfaithful\nor you have been cheated on or you are\nthe third person\nin the triangle the secret lover or\nbecause you're the friend on whose\nshoulder somebody's been weeping\nfor days or the one to whom somebody is\nconfiding\nif i'll ask your entire audience now\nabout 85 percent of the people will tell\nyou that they have been affected by the\nexperience of infidelity\nabsolutely so the story of infidelity is\nnot just a story of two people\nof one cheater and one betrayed the\nstory of infidelity is the story that\naccompanies marriage from the day\nmarriage was invented\nand it travels in families and it\ntravels all over the world\nand my exploration of infidelity\nwas using this betrayal this violation\nof\ntrust as a way to understand modern love\nbecause infidelity hasn't always meant\nthe same\nand doesn't mean the same depending on\nthe various cultures and the various\nmodels of marriage that we have\nbut if i live today in the west and i\nwait till i'm in my 30s to choose you\nand i've had loads of people before you\nand i ever met\nwhich means monogamy is not one person\nfor life but monogamy for me is one\nperson at the time\nand i have been on apps and i have had\nto deal with all my fomos and the\nthousand people i could choose from and\nyou're the one i've honed in on now my\ndevelop\nmy sense of trust for you what you\nrepresent for me\nis all those people i didn't choose\nand with you when you ex and i\nexperience infidelity\nit's like the shattering of the grand\nambition of love\ni thought we this is it you're the one\nand you're my soul mate you know we\ntoday have brought\nthe divine into the social and i call\nyou soulmate i don't turn to god i turn\nto you\nand you did this to me and i feel like\ni've lost my entire sense of self\nsome affairs really are expressions of\nrelationships that are in trouble we\nnever talk\nwe never touch when's the last time we\nmade love to each other\nyou despise me you control me i could\nyou know the breath of reasons for why\npeople\nwant to run away and then some affairs\nhave very little to do with the partner\nunfortunately or just as a matter of\nfact\nthey often have to do with the fact that\npeople\nwill breach and betray\nin search of something that they have\nlost\nlost parts of themselves lost\nyou know they have descendants that\nalways say to me is when somebody would\nsay\ni didn't just want to find another\nperson i wanted to find another self\ni didn't want to leave my partner i\nwanted to leave what i had become\nand i didn't know how to change with my\npartner\nthat's not a justification at all but it\nexplains to the partner\nthis is not about you're not smart\nenough rich enough tall enough thin\nenough this has nothing to do with you\nto the extent that this can help you\nunderstand why this happened\nmy work with you is going to be not on\nthe facts\nand if they did it standing or lying\nflat my work with you is going to be on\nunderstanding the meaning\nand infidelity tells a story what is the\nstory\nthat this affair what does it mean not\nwhat did you do\nand therefore how is this relationship\ngoing to be able to either\nlearn from it grow from it or make a\ndecision to leave because of it\nall options are open right now your\nfirst marriage\nis over your first relationship\nthat we can decide together you will\ndecide if you want to have another\nrelationship with each other\nin light of what has happened and we\nwill need to heal\nlike many other crises there are ways\nthat you can heal from this\nand trust each other again and love each\nother again and maybe even\nbetter than what you were before i can\nhold that space for you\nso powerful when when does someone know\nthat it's time to break up and move on\nversus it's time to still try and build\ni think a lot of people that i meet and\nand this is in\nany breakup it could be leaving a job\nit could be breaking up with a person it\ncould be\nleaving a long-term commitment whatever\nit may be\nwe always you always find people say i\nstayed in it for six months too long\ni stayed in it for two years that i\nshouldn't have i was in it for six years\nthat i shouldn't have\nwe spend so much time making that\ndecision how do what are the signs that\nyou know that it's now time\nto move on and call it quits or it's\ntime to actually build and try our best\nbut that presupposes that once you know\nthe science you're ready to act\nand what you've just told me is that\npeople often knew the science for a long\ntime but they needed to prepare\ninternally and sometimes externally to\ndo the act\nyeah to do the leaving so we sometimes\nknow\nfor two years that this is probably not\ngonna last\nbut then there is a process of preparing\nand um when people say i you know why\ndid i stay so long\ni say you left when you were ready to go\nyou can you know because after the fact\nit's easy to say i should have left\nsooner\nbut why sometimes i was there two years\nbefore so i can tell you two years ago\nwhen you thought about you know what\nwill happen the day that you walk into\nthe house and there is nobody there\nyou couldn't bear the thought so we\nneeded to prepare you\nfor that we needed to prepare you to\nknow that you won't be seeing your\nchildren every day\nwe needed to prepare you to realize that\nyou were going to\nbe working again after not working for a\nlong time we needed to prepare you to\naccept that there is another partner\nhere that is going to be loving your\nchildren as well\nand these things are or if you want to\ndo about work we needed to prepare you\nthat you had done the thing that you\nloved all your life and you were gonna\nlet go of this\nor you needed to prepare to accept that\nyou had done the thing that was right\nand you were finally\ngoing to do the thing that you really\nwanted and they were not both the same\nand once you lay down like this people\nactually close the gap\nbetween the i knew it and it took me so\nlong\nyeah esther i love that it's uh it's\nsuch a joy\ntalking to you i i'm just loving just uh\nthe back and forth and being able to\nfind so many of the answers i've been\nthinking about in speaking with you and\nreflecting together right\ni could do this with you for hours but\nuh we have\ntwo last segments that we do on on\npurpose that i want to do with you one\nis called\nfill in the blanks so i'm going to read\nout some sentences\nand you have to fill in the blanks to\nstart off with so are you ready\nokay i'll try i'm very proud of those no\nno you're going to be great\nyou're going to be great okay true love\nis\ntrue love is living\nwith those differences that you think\nyou can never\ntolerate i love it uh\ngreat answer okay great partners are\nfunny they know how to bring in humor\njust when you're about to bite that is\nmy wife my wife is a genius at that\nshe's so and it comes naturally to her\nuh\ni have one like that too i bless him for\nbeing able to\nmake me love at the moment that we could\ngo down that path that is just like\nabsolutely uh conflicts in relationships\nare defeating\nbut but part of relationships conflicts\nare part of relationships and yet they\ncan be so defeating\ncouples therapy is couples therapy\nis the place where you create\na safe and provocative environment\nto check yourself as you walk in\nand stop focusing on checking your\npartner\nand leaving yourself out of the game\namazing great answer see that was that\nwas great\nthat was phenomenal so i'm now gonna ask\nyou the final five these have to be\nanswered in one word or one sentence\nmaximum so\nuh same as same as last time you did\ngreat job so these are your final five\nuh what is the best relationship advice\nyou've ever received\nit's perfectly fine to go to sleep angry\nah okay great answer okay what is the\nworst\nrelationship advice you've ever received\nyou have to tell your partner everything\nso what do you not have to tell your\npartner let's let's just dive into that\nthat's an interesting answer\ntell us tell us a bit more about that\ncertain truths are cruel and overrated\nask yourself is it wise\nis it kind not just is it true\nwhat you want me to say jay you really\nare an awful\nyou know you look awful it's like i'd\nnever want to touch you your smell\nbothers me\nuh i can't believe i'm sitting here with\nyou every day\nthen leave got it make sense that's more\nthan a sentence\nno no no no no i was encouraged i wanted\nto learn more i was encouraging you too\nthat was great\nall right question number three you're\nthe dumbest person\nyou've ever i've ever been with i can't\nbelieve that you\nthat this is the way it's it's the stuff\nthat is insulting\nyou know i never want to make love to\nyou again\nif i'd never had sex with you for the\nrest of my life i wouldn't be bothered\nis there a value in saying these things\ndoes\nanybody see anything positive but this\nsometimes people think that\nin the name of truth in the name of your\nquestion before i should tell you how i\nfeel\nwell some of your feelings you should go\ntell them to somebody else\ni love it it's so great all right\nquestion number three\nuh what's something that you know is\ntrue about relationships\nbut people are still disagree with\nthey're still trying to get there what\nare you so sure is true\nabout relationships but most people in\nsociety they haven't quite got there yet\nor they may disagree with it that at\ntimes when it\nfeels like it's a mission impossible\nrepair is possible beautiful\nquestion number four what's the biggest\nlesson you've learned\nin the last 12 months i've relearned it\nit's not that i never thought of it but\nthat\nhelping others is one of the most\npowerful ways for me not to feel scared\nor helpless\nmyself i could so relate to you i love\nthat i can so relate to you\nokay question number five the final\nquestion\nif you we don't need the sound effects\nguys that was the sound effect that was\nthe one use\nesther's sound effect uh if you could\ncreate a law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\nit would be the law of decency and\nrespect\nfor the humanity of others don't use\nthem\ndon't abuse them they're people\nthey're like you if you lose your sense\nof morality by being violent or\nenslaving people\nor humiliating them you lose your own\nhumanity\neveryone esther perel the author of the\nstate of affairs\nrethinking infidelity and the author of\nmating in captivity uh\nnew york times best-selling author\nplease please please go and grab a copy\nof this book if you loved our\nconversation today\nhopefully you can also get the game by\nthis time as well i'm excited\nand you can of course listen to esther's\npodcast uh\nthat i highly recommend that we will be\nputting a link in the comments too as\nwell esther thank you so much\nfor giving so much of your love and\nheart and energy to the on purpose\ncommunity today\ni hope we get to do this in person again\nvery soon i'd love to\nsit with you and just talk for hours is\nthere anything that i didn't ask you or\ndidn't let you share that's on your\nheart and you really want to tell people\nthat you really want to share with\neveryone\nyou know what i often enjoy is to ask\nyou like you know i so often think like\nwhere do\nwhere shall we begin right that's the\npodcast how's work where should we begin\nthe game\nand i think here is how we began and you\nasked me\nyou know a question that brought me to a\nplace that was very surprising\nto me where did i first think about the\nimportance of relationship in my life\nwhere did you first think about purpose\nit was uh you know i i grew up just\ncompletely\ndidn't even know purpose existed like i\ndidn't even know it was a real thing\nright\nyou just kind of uh you just kind of\nassume that life is what it is you go to\ncollege school you go to college you go\nto university you get a degree\nyou get a job you get married you play\ngolf like you know\nthat's what life looks like at least\nfrom\nwhere i was brought up and you're just\nworking hard\nfulfilling that and i think the first\ntime i thought about purpose\nwas when i met the monk for the first\ntime so when i was 18 years old\ni heard a monk speak and i write about\nthat in my book and\nhe was living with purpose so not only\ndid i start\nthinking about purpose i got to\nexperience\npurpose and i think that's what's so\nhard about relationships\nis that we don't always get to\nexperience\nfulfilling relationships in our life\nthrough other people\nand so we don't even know what it looks\nlike and i have to be honest and say\nthat\nthat was the first time i thought about\npurpose because this monk was super\neducated\nhe could have been making hundreds of\nthousands millions of dollars\nbut he'd given it all up to serve\nhumanity\nand i thought and what made you\nreceptive to him\ni think it was just the idea that at\nleast at that time i'd\nmet many people who were i'd met a few\npeople that were rich i'd met people who\nwere\nfamous i'd met people who were strong\nand beautiful and attractive\nbut i don't think i'd met anyone who i\nfelt was happy and purposeful\nand what made me receptive was that i\nfelt that he was happy and purposeful\ntruly\nin his heart and it was something you\nhad to feel and experience\ni mean i'm still friends with him today\nhe still has it today\nbut i always feel that when i'm with him\nthat he always feels happy and\npurposeful\nand and that experience is so rare i\nfeel when you're around someone\nso i think that's you know that for me\nis probably the first time i started\nthinking about purpose\nand uh today i just i also believe that\na relationship needs a purpose so\ni love these worlds colliding and a lot\nof my personal work in purpose has been\nmassive for helping me in my\nrelationship so\nuh yeah hopefully that answers your\nquestion yes\nyes it's it's it's really beautiful\nbecause\none thing is you know where were you in\nyour life but the other thing is\nhow come he could speak to you\nhe there was a space that was waiting\nfor him there was a need a longing a\nwish\nand i think that's exactly what happens\nin people's relationships too\nit's just that they often come very\nbruised and very wounded\nfrom all kinds of relationship\nexperiences in their childhood\nand they and they first need to uh\nbasically re you know take the parts of\nthe childhood that still lives inside of\nthem\nand put it aside so that they can create\na different script\nyour purpose is a story and\nrelationships are stories too\ni love that that's such a such a\nwonderful reflection and such a\nsuch such a beautiful way of looking at\nit and uh\nyeah i just always feel that we all have\nthe opportunity\ntoday even more so because of podcasts\nlike these and interviews and\nconversations\nwhere we have more opportunities for our\nautopilot to be disrupted in a good way\ni i think you know for me i had to go to\nan event and this speaker was speaking\nat an event but today\nyou can just hear something on youtube\nor a podcast and all of a sudden your\nmind is just\nmoved in a different direction i think\nwe have such a benefit today\nthat we can connect and i'm so grateful\nthat i got to connect with you today\nbecause\ni'm sure you've done that for a lot of\npeople today where you've shifted\ntheir mindset or their paradigm so i\nthank you esther and i i deeply look\nforward to meeting you\ni i want
