amount of mentorship\nyou're going to receive is\nabsolutely incredible today's guest is\nmark\nrandolph the co-founder and first ceo of\nnetflix he's a veteran silicon valley\nentrepreneur advisor and\ninvestor mark was co-founder of netflix\nserving as their ceo\nas the executive producer of their\nwebsite and is a member of their board\nof directors\nuntil his retirement from the company

numerous tech ventures most recently\nmark co-founded\nanalytics software company looker data\nsciences\nand his new book which you'll be talking\nabout today is called\nthat will never work i love the title\nthe birth of netflix and the amazing\nlife of an idea\nthat will never work mark thank you for\nbeing here oh it's a pleasure jay thanks\nfor having me yeah it's awesome to have\nyou here and i\ni love that title by the way i think\nit's brilliant i\ncan't think of the amount of times i've\nheard it i can't even remember the\namount of times i've heard it\nand who was the first person you ever\nheard it from well i've been hearing it\nall my life for the most part because\ni've been one of those guys with these\ncrazy ideas uh probably the most famous\none is my wife\nwho you expect to be deeply supportive\nbut\nyou know but it happens to all of us you\ncome running down with a great idea and\nwhat did everyone say and she said that\nwill never work that'll never show and\nthen that'll never work\nyou know but and now of course it's a\njoke between us because i've\nlearned that she's kind of a reverse\nindicator that if she doesn't like an\nidea\nall right i'm onto something right right\nthat's interesting my wife is\nmy mainstream test so if i'm thinking\nabout something\nand wondering whether i think it's\nscalable or whether a lot of people will\nbe interested into it that's when i go\nand ask my wife\nso so we have the opposite effect but\nactually in the conference you said that\nyour number one rule in life was staying\nmarried\nwhy was that such a priority for you\nwell you know people tend to\nget get this whole business thing and\nlet it take them over you know they\nthink this is what's important that\nsomehow if i make so much money i'll be\nhappy\nor if only this i'll be happy or only\nthat i'll be happy\nand you've got to put these things to\nperspective the the goal is\nbalance at least my goal is balance\nso long long time ago i said i know\na lot of guys who are on their sixth\nstartup and their sixth wife\nand i don't want that to be me so it i\nmean\nwe're kind of jumping almost to the\npunch line of my life\nwhich is like the thing that i'm most\nproud of in my life is not\nstarting this company with a 150 million\nsubscribers\nor any of the other things i've\naccomplished it's that i did all that\nstuff\nand stayed married to the same woman\nthat my kids\nknow me and i think like me\nand i get a chance to pursue the other\npassions in my life at the same time\ni absolutely love that i think that's\nsuch an amazing message and i'm so glad\nthat\nyou're saying that that's the punchline\nand that's the real success i think\nthat's beautiful hearing for\nanyone who's an entrepreneur listening\nor anyone who's a business person\nlistening\nfor them to hear that is such incredible\nadvice so thank you for sharing that\nmy pleasure yeah i think it's awesome i\ni want to dive in this this interview is\ngoing to be really phenomenal because i\nthink what you do so beautifully with\nyour life like you just did\nis you have everything from business\nmentorship you have life mentorship\nyou're able to really think about and we\nwere just\ni was just getting mentorship on disney\nworld\ni'm going to disney world this year and\nand mark was walking me through how to\nhave the best\nexperience at disney world so i love the\nbreadth of your experience\none of the things i wanted to start with\nand this is because i've been fascinated\nby this story\ni've read about it a million times on\nthe internet i've seen so many versions\nbut i get to ask you\nabout what happened with blockbuster and\ni know you've shared it before but i\ni love it because i would love to hear\nit from you because i've only ever read\nand heard about it well certainly but\nthe the first thing you've got to\nrealize is that people kind of have this\nvision that netflix\nhas always been the netflix they know\nnow that it's in every country in the\nworld that it's streaming video that it\nmakes its own\ntv and radio that it's a euphemism for\ngetting laid i mean that\nthat stuff all came later there was a\ntime when if you wanted a movie from\nnetflix\nwe mailed it to you and we were a dvd by\nmail business\nand uh it's kind of weird how often i\nmeet people especially younger people\nwho have no idea where netflix\nstarted totally uh and actually this\nagain you got to stop me i'll go on\nthese weirdos\na day before yesterday netflix announced\nthat it shipped its\n5 billionth dvd which\nblows my mind anyway\ngoing way back um our company idea\nsucked i mean we launched this thing and\nthe idea was to do\nvideo rental by mail and it didn't work\nand it took us two and a half years to\nfinally\ncome up with a business model that\nactually made sense and\nhere's the how blockbuster gets involved\nis that when all of a sudden you figure\nsomething out things take off and it\ngets incredibly expensive\nand we didn't have the money so i think\nthat year we were on\ntrack to do about five million dollars\nin sales which is\nnot bad but we were also on track to\nspend 50 million dollars wow\nand you know you you don't need to be a\naccountant to know that that\nis not very sustainable so there's a a\nterm\nuh in business called pursue strategic\nalternatives\nwhich is code for we got to sell this\nsucker right\nand fast and our strategic alternative\nwas blockbuster\nand blockbuster was in a totally\ndifferent place so we were on track for\nfive million they were going to do six\nbillion we had about a hundred employees\nthey had\nuh 60 000 employees they had 9\n000 stores so we were nothing so\nwe called these guys up and said um we\ntried to get a meeting\nnothing like crickets so\nquiet better business and then as it\nhappens we were on this corporate\nretreat\num and we were not far from here we're\noutside\noutside of santa barbara at this dude\nranch called the alisal ranch\nand i mean i'm i'm dressed up today\nuh i shaved for you jay that that is my\nreal life that's my\nsign of sincere respect i feel terrible\nnow\nno no if you if you only knew how\ninfrequently that happens you realize\nthat's my genuflection um\nbut so we're pretty casual in silicon\nvalley and so when you go on retreat\nyou gotta work at it and seriously all i\nhad with me on this three-day retreat\nwas shorts\ni had some t-shirts i was in flip-flop\nsandals that was it\nand of course that is when blockbuster\ncalls and says we'll see you tomorrow\nin dallas we're going\nhow are we gonna get from alisal ranch\nto dallas by tomorrow morning\nand so we did that um thing\nthat prudent entrepreneurs do which is\nwhen they're 50 million dollars in debt\nand we chartered a private jet\nand here's the here's okay now i'm going\nto share the little bit of netflix\ntrivia with you which\nvery few people know the jet was owned\nby\nvanna white i don't know if you know who\nvanna white was she's the woman who spun\nthe letters on a wheel of fortune oh wow\nso i did not know that\nyeah and i'm going wow spinning letters\npays pretty well i guess\nso we're on vana white's jet we all fly\nto dallas we go up into this\nbuilding this huge building\nand we walk into this massive conference\nroom um\nand blockbuster guys come in john\nantioco\nthe head of blockbuster ed stead is cfo\nand they're in there\nyou know they're casual but they're like\nhollywood casual with the three thousand\ndollar\nloafer kind of casual right um and i'm\nin flip-flops\nand shorts and a t-shirt and i remember\ni was kind of jealous because\nreed hastings my business partner was\nthere and he had on a hawaiian shirt\nget buttons um anyway\nmake the pitch we're gonna we'll combine\nforces\nuh you guys will run the stores we will\nrun the online business we'll find\nanother buzzword synergies we'll all\nlive happily ever after and they ask\nquestions and finally\num they asked the big question which is\nhow much should we\npay for you what do you what do you what\nare you talking here and reid\nwe had talked about this on the plane we\ngo well we're in the whole 50 million\nbucks so\nreed goes 50 million dollars\nand nothing nothing in fact\ni'm looking over at john antiocho and\nhe's like struggling not to laugh\nand we're going ah\nand so obviously the meeting went\ndownhill real quickly but\nit's a fun story but the real\nrevelation took place on the jet home\nand we're all kind of\nsitting quietly and i know our cfo was\nthere barry mccarthy and i know he's\nsitting there going\nall right how am i going to make the\ncash last longer and reid\nhe's not a dwell in the past guy he's\nalready off in the future of what some\nother business problem\nand i'm going like oh now what do we do\nthis was going to be our way out\nand finally i go oh okay so i\nyou know tink the glasses and uh\ngo gentlemen one thing left\nnow we have to kick their ass so that\nwas\nthe moment when you go that my dad used\nto say\nyou know mark sometimes the only way out\nis through yes\nyes and um and this was that moment when\nwe go okay if we're gonna make this\nhappen\nwe're not gonna have to rely on this\ndeus ex machina of\nblockbuster saving us we're gonna have\nto figure this out on our own\ni love that and were there other\ninteractions with them as well for the\nsame purpose so that was the only one\nno there was no future discussion of\ncollaboration\nbut there was kind of this friendly um\nrivalry between the two companies\nand and it's funny now you know um you\noccasionally read stories the newspaper\nabout some grizzled veteran of the\nvietnam war going back to\num ho chi minh city and meeting up with\nthis\nand so we i still have like um email\nconverse and phone conversations with\nthe guys that we were fighting with\nat blockbuster telling war stories\ntogether i love that oh that's beautiful\nthat's awesome now tell me like you've\nobviously entered this book\nthe amazing life of an idea and i think\ntoday i hear this a lot and i'm sure you\nhear it even more than i do\nbut everyone has an amazing idea and\neveryone has a cool idea\nbut in your work you talk a lot about\nhow\nit's not just about the idea and the\nidea is actually a very small part of it\ntell us about that thought process and\nwhy it's such an important message yeah\nit it's um\neveryone has an idea and a lot of ways\nwhich is why i wrote\nthe book is because you know there's\nthis\nmy daughter graduated from college you\nknow four years ago and i was sitting in\nthe audience and i'm just going waiting\nwaiting and then i hear it which is the\nfall your dreams\neveryone hears that stupid thing because\nbut then no one ever tells you how\nhow do you follow your dreams because\neveryone has one i mean it's not just a\nbusiness idea\nwe've all got something that we want to\nmake happen\nbut no one knows where to start and what\ni try\nand tell people is your idea is\nnothing it your idea is not going to be\nwhat happens your idea is your starting\npoint and\nit's called the amazing life of an idea\nbecause i'm trying to show people that\nthe original idea we had video rental by\nmail was a terrible idea\nbut that wasn't the point the point is\nthat when reid and i had this idea of\nvideo rental by mail\nwe didn't go home and go great let's\nwrite up a business plan\nand let's do a powerpoint slideshow we\nsaid\nwhat can we really mail a dvd to someone\nand so we just turned the freaking car\naround and went down to santa cruz and\nbought a passy klein\nmusic cd and mailed it to reid's house\nbecause we\nrealized thinking about it was worthless\nyou have to start and try something and\ndo something\nso the po i rambled again no yeah you're\nallowed do it right\nas much as you like it's great that's\nwhy my head works um\nbut the point is that these ideas are\nfleeting the idea\nyour idea it's a bad one i don't know\nwhy it's a bad one and you don't know\nwhy it's a bad one but i guarantee\ni've never ever seen a successful\ncompany ever that's successful\nthe way their original idea was the\npeople that are successful are the ones\nwho take that idea\nand start and then they find out why\nit's a bad idea and then if they're\nclever\nthey try something different based on\nwhat they learned and if they're clever\nthey try something different and\neventually you end up with a netflix\nyeah your mileage may vary sure sure but\nthat process\nis the ability to pivot consistently the\nability to correct\nshift direction but i find that so often\ni i think the thing that i see the most\nand i think what people struggle with\nthe most is knowing\nwhen to pivot yes and and\nwhen they're going in the right\ndirection and how long is too long or\nhow short is too short\nand i'm sure you've seen this time and\ntime again with all the companies you've\nmentored and\nadvertised it's probably the it's\nprobably the question i get asked the\nmost and unfortunately it's also\nprobably the hardest one for me i wish\nthey'd asked me one that i was easy\nbut it's really when do i know when to\ngive up yes\nand i think what happens is people\nfall in love with their idea\nthey get this idea and it's it's like a\nbaby and\nit can be the ugliest thing in the world\nbut to them it's going oh my god it's\nbeautiful\nand they project it forward they're\nholding the baby but they go oh gosh\nit's going to be the smartest it's\nthe first kid he's going to walk way\nbefore his age group and they can\npicture it\nyou know in in high school hitting the\ngame-winning home\nrun or graduating from college first\nbut it's just a baby and it could just\nas easily end up\nyou know doing heroin behind the\n7-eleven\nyou can't tell you can't fall in love\nwith the idea\nwhat you have to do is fall in love with\nthe problem\nand the reason i say that is because the\nproblem won't get old\nyes and you'll never give up on the\nproblem eventually\nyou'll figure something out and\noccasionally yes you do run out of time\nor not of money\nor you go i have no more ways to solve\nthis but it's\nmuch more evident to you than knowing\nwhen to keep when to stop hammering on\nyour idea\nyeah i love that emphasis i think that's\ngreat and and i think about that so\noften that whenever you hear about\nentrepreneurs solving problems and that\nbeing the root of where everything\nbegins and i think so often we're like\nwow\nwhat's my idea or what's my passion or\nwhere do i want to start and it's like\nbut then i don't know how this links to\nthe real world and the only way it links\nthe real world is if it's solving a real\nproblem\nand i think it's so true that you can\nalways go deeper into solving a problem\nand you can't get tired of it if the\nproblem still exists and i think it's\nabout finding a problem that we really\nbelieve in\nyeah because i think that's that's part\nof the challenge too is we often find\nproblems because\nthey're cool or they're interesting or\nthey're trending but they're not\nnecessarily a problem that we're\ndeeply committed to so i'll play i'll\nplay a little game with you please i'd\nlove to hang with the people\nthe people who are listening so um i'll\ntell a quick story\num because and i'm going to tell you the\nstory because there is a way to come up\nwith ideas that are\ngood ideas ooh i like this and it's a\nsimple one\nit's by training yourself to look for\npain\nto despite being an optimist to train\nyourself to see the world as an\nimperfect\nplace and i don't mean solving these\nglobal problems like\ndon't try and cure malaria or look at\nsomething that you know\nreally well that you bump into every\nsingle day as you're you're promoting\nyour business or\nworking with your own with your family\nokay so\nthe story is about this uh this job i\nhad\n40 years ago and i was a house painter\nthis is during my\nuniversity years and different world\nobviously you know no technology\nwhatsoever\nand back then when you would buy paint\nit came in those cans i remember yeah my\nparents used to\nput a lid on it and that kind of stuff\nand that was fine and now 40 years later\ni go to paint and paint still comes in\nthat stupid can\nand it's lame because it first of all it\nrequires a screwdriver to open it\nright and then when you pour it it all\ndrips down the side of the pant\ncan and it fills up a little limb and\nyou got to stir it with a stick\nand then you gotta paint and\nyou spill paint all over you and it's\njust the most disastrous\nexperience yeah um and then of course\nwhen you gotta\nclose the can you hammer it put a hammer\non it i mean it's ridiculous\nbut what happens is if you're picturing\nas i'm talking this about painting and\nyou're imagining painting and you're\ngoing yeah that paint can sucks\nsome people go that's stupid what why\ndon't they sell paint like in a\nmilk jug or even better like the kind\nthat um you put detergent in the\ndetergent comes in\nor where it sits in a counter with a\nlittle spout that it all pours out from\nor why isn't there an aftermarket lid or\nwhy isn't there a magnetic stirrer\nbut people automatically begin filling\nin these blanks and it's a story that\nhappened to me\nthat it's an amazing thing when people\nbegin looking at the frustrations in\ntheir life without even thinking about\nit these ideas\nyes pop into their head and it's coming\nback to focusing\non the problem yes because the problem\nwill never get\nwill never get stale and so much of what\nhappened at netflix\nwas just bumping into one problem after\nanother and as soon as you solve one\nwell lo and behold there's a new one yes\nand\nit's why being an entrepreneur is such\nan amazingly\nexciting business because it's perpetual\nyeah\nand i just want to point out to everyone\nwho's listening and watching right now\nwhat mark said that was really powerful\nbecause not only is mark talking about\nfinding the problem which\nyou may have heard before you may be\nthinking about before but something he\nspecifically said it was like\ntrying to solve a problem that you know\nwell and i thought that was a really\npowerful point because i think sometimes\nwe can get lost in problems that we\nactually are very\ndistant from and don't deeply understand\nand have no familiarity with\nand i think we are better at coming up\nwith solutions for things we are very\nfamiliar with\nyeah you started off by saying that you\nknow you might have an idea but you're\nnot sure how it fits into real life or\nhow even the problem fits into real\nworld\nbut you do you figure those things out\nby actually starting to try and solve\nthem yeah\nand they take you places it is\nabsolutely a\nfollow where it goes it's a murder\nmystery it's a\nit's a crossword puzzle it's a jigsaw\npuzzle it's such an\ninteresting process of seeing where this\nproblem\ntakes you yeah and then lo and behold\nsometimes it goes into an\narea and you go well i'm solving a\nproblem for seven people\nand you go okay that's not viable yeah\nfine but sometimes lo and behold you\nstumble onto something\nthat everybody wants and uh\nand that's that's luck and that's okay\ntoo but that's interesting you've just\nsparked a thought in my head that i\ndon't actually think of often or i don't\nhear often at least and it's about how\nthat the number one thing needed to be a\ngood entrepreneur or an idea creator and\nsomeone who takes an idea into\nimplementation and execution is\nwanting to continuously problem solve\nand and we don't actually hear about it\nlike that often that someone who's an\nentrepreneur needs to constantly be\nhappy to move from problem solving\nproblem solving to the next problem\nyeah and just keep going down that road\nand i think the\none of the things is a lot of people i\nmean it's\nback when i was a lad jay you know not\nnot that long ago\nthere wasn't this thing there was a\nthing called an entrepreneur but there\ncertainly wasn't\nsomething that you became and it was\nnever\nsomething that you would go to school\nand get a\ndegree in you know inconceivable\num so in some ways it's good because now\nnot everyone who goes to a university\nthinks they have to be a banker or a\nlawyer or a doctor\nthey actually think wow i could actually\nbe an entrepreneur\nbut the problem is a lot of them want to\nbe it for the wrong reason\nand they want to do it for this the\nglorification which is also a shocking\nthing to me\nthat they think it's the way to get rich\nor it's the way to be famous or\nyou know you're going to be on shark\ntank or it's it's\nthat is not what it's all about i mean\nwe're here in uh\nin l.a and it's like the people who move\nhere from\nall over the world to be an actor or an\nactress because they think they're going\nto get rich and famous\nwell i hate to break it to you but not\ngoing to happen\nor at least the odds are extremely far\nagainst it but if you're\nin some city and you're going i love\nperforming i love taking on characters\nyou're doing it for the right reason but\nthen it doesn't make a difference\nwhether you're\nrich or famous you're still getting that\nenjoyment and entrepreneurship is the\nsame\nand again long way back to where we\nstarted\nit's because of that thrill of solving\nthe problem\nif that's the reason you're doing it you\nwill never be unhappy\nin that job absolutely and how do you\nsee it like i know a lot of people who\nsay to me like jay\ni'm just stuck with overthinking i just\nprocrastinate all day however you push\nso many people to\ntake their first step or to overcome the\nfear of getting started because i've\nheard you say before that and i love\nthis by the way if you have an idea\nyou learn more in an hour of doing it\nthan in a year of studying it\nabsolutely and it's like how do you get\nsomeone to just how have you seen and\ni'd love to hear your thoughts on this\nhow have you pushed people into action\nso there's a there's two things there's\none thing that you say\nand you say just do it like stop\nthinking start doing but that's very\nsimilar to the\nfollow your dreams so i'll give you a\nlonger explanation\num i mentioned before that people\nfall in love with their idea but what\nhappens when you fall in love with your\nidea\nis you naturally embellish so you start\nwith this idea and it's simple\nand it could be done pretty easily but\nyou don't do that you leave it in your\nhead\nand you add something on and all of a\nsudden you've added it's a you know a\nhouse but you've added on\na wing and now you put a second story on\nand then you add on the tennis courts\nand\nyou go let's put in this beautiful\ndriveway and let's put in the skateboard\nramp\nand pretty s and you have gargoyles and\nturrets and you've got this\ncastle in your head now then\nwhen you go to price it out you go\nthis is going to cost a lot of money\nand this is going to be really comp i'm\nnot even sure he can build it like\nit's too complicated and too big so the\ntrick is not to build the castle in your\nmind but to take your immediate your\nsmall idea\nand do it and if your idea is i want to\nbuild a castle\nthe cleverness is not what's my idea\nthe cleverness is how can i figure out a\nquick simple and easy way\nto validate it\ni'm trying to think here whether i dare\ntry and give you an analogy\nfor that go for it it's a little dorky\ngive it a shot and if i see you kind of\nyour kind of eyes kind of glazing over\ni'll kind of know that maybe i'm losing\nyou\num so years ago i was working with a\nyoung entrepreneur in san francisco\nand um he was uh at a party\num late one rainy well that's\nevery night late one rainy evening in\nsan francisco\nand what happened to him is something\nthat happens to everybody\nat that situation which is the party ran\nout of beer\nand then they all been arguing about\nwhose turn it was to go out and\nbuy the beer find an open liquor store\nall that stuff\nand he goes idea entrepreneur idea\npain um my phone\nknows where i am my phone knows my taste\nmy phone can have a database of all the\nopen liquor stores that deliver\ncredit card hit a button beer shows up\ngreat idea this is a bunch of years ago\nyeah and\nback in the day to test that idea you\nwould have had to actually build the app\nestablish relationships with all kinds\nof\nliquor stores you'd have to do a\nmarketing campaign he didn't want any of\nthat crap\ndidn't want to spend the money didn't\nwant to have to code anything\nso he parsed apart the problem and he\nsaid am i really wondering\ndoes my phone know where i am no i know\nthat am i worrying about\ncan i build a database of no i liquor\nstores i can do that\nwill people trust me with their credit\ncard i know that what don't i know\nand what don't i know what i don't know\nis does anyone care\nyes and more importantly if they order\nonce will they order again what's the\naverage order size\nso now here that's the setup yes here's\nthe clever\ncreative way of quickly simply and\neasily testing it\nhe goes huh and what he did is he\nprinted up\nbusiness cards that said nothing more\nthan need beer\ncall me and then he went and stood\noutside these apartment buildings in san\nfrancisco on friday and saturday nights\nwhenever someone in the right\ndemographic came along\nhe'd give him the cards and say hey if\nyou need beer call me\nand then he'd go back and he'd wait and\nthey'd call and he'd get in his bike and\nhe'd go to the liquor store and he'd buy\nthe beer\nhe'd go to the apartment and he'd put on\na viking\ncostume don't ask okay and then up he\ngoes\nand delivers the beer and he figured out\nhow to test this idea\ni love that not by building the app not\nby raising money\nnot by getting a co-founding engineer\nbut by printing out\nbusiness cards i love that he collided\nhis idea with reality\nhe did the equivalent of what reid and i\ndid we mailed that first music used\nmusic cd\nhe quickly and easily found out is it a\ngood idea\nand it wasn't yeah because everyone was\ndrunk\nthe orders were small they were all\ntaking place at one o'clock in the\nmorning there was no repeat business\nbut he realized that with a business\ncard and more importantly\nhe had real people telling him what\nworked and what didn't work and someone\neventually said\nyou know i i have an office i'm an\noffice manager during the day and we do\nthese big beer\nparties and i'm carrying cases up and\ndown the stairs\nand he goes huh maybe i'll pivot to\ndoing pivot to doing this\nand that didn't work either and then\nsomeone said would you stock my fridge\nfor me and he pivoted to that\nand it worked right and he took this\nmeandering path\nof an idea and the idea that worked for\na little resemblance to the one he had\nat the beginning\nit was another example of the amazing\nlife and idea it was the amazing example\nof\nanother example looking for pain another\nexample of\nhow to test something quickly simply and\neasily\nin many cases without even actually\ndoing it absolutely that's such a great\nanswer by the way i'm so glad you went\noff on that\nthat journey that was brilliant and and\nagain i'm learning so much just by\nthis this conversation is unbelievable\nso far if you've been listening or\nwatching right now i really hope you're\ntaking notes again\nall of this conversation you'll learn so\nmuch more by reading the book that will\nnever work\nwhich we're discussing right now by mark\nrandolph so\none of the things i love that you point\nout there which is which is so\nspecial i feel is testing that which you\ndon't know\nright like it wasn't about building a\ndatabase because you know you can do\nthat i loved all the\nthose examples you know you can build a\nnetwork of liquor stores that that\npeople have done that before\nbut it was testing the part though you\ndon't know and i think you're so right\nthat so much we waste all our time and\nmoney and resources\nin building the website building the app\nbuilding the platform\nand not even testing the idea at its\nroot core\nwhich actually doesn't cost any money\nand that's what i love about your idea\nthe most\nthat people always say well i i need\nsome investment or i need\nor i need someone to let's get dead on\nthat is exactly it\nevery i am now the master of collecting\nexcuses\nokay everyone's got some reason i can't\ndo it like and\nthat's a great i can't raise the money\nyeah what's because you designed a\ncastle which takes too much money\nfigure out a simple way to try it i\ncan't do it because i don't have a\nbusiness degree\ni don't have a computer science degree i\ndon't have a technical co-founder and\nthese are all\nexamples for people starting tech\nventures yes but\neveryone with their idea\nhas an excuse yes and what you have to\nbegin recognizing is this is a\nlegitimate excuse or not am i just\nscared absolutely and it's okay to be\nscared\nit's the nature of it's risk-taking\nis not doing something crazy\nscary dangerous risk-taking is starting\ndown a path where you can't see around\nthe corner\nyou don't you don't know what's next and\nnot being afraid\nto re-route along the way yeah that's\nthat's the fun part of it\ni mean it's not just jumping off a cliff\nyeah here's another mask talking about\ncliffs let's go the opposite direction\nlet's go up the cliff yeah so i do a lot\nof i'm a climber i'm an alpinist for\nmost of my life yes\nand in rock climbing um and now people\nclimb the gym so maybe\npeople might recognize this that when\nit's easy\nokay two things are in place one is you\ncan see all the way to the top\nand the holds are big enough that you\ncan not only climb up but if you don't\nlike it you can climb back down\nall right so the next level of\ndifficulty is you can still see all the\nway to the top see the whole route\nbut it's so hard now that you can climb\nup but you can't climb back down\nright now the real scary stuff is when\nyou can't see all the way to the top\nand it's so hard that if you climb\nhalfway up you can't climb back down\nbut the other piece about rock climbing\nis that you can't\nalways see all the way to the top from\nthe bottom\nso what you have to do is you go up the\nfirst four or five holds\nand oh now i think i can see the next\nfour or five\nand you go up those and all of a sudden\nthe root reveals itself to you\nthat is what taking an idea down a path\nis like\nit requires that courage to start even\nthough i'm not sure\nexactly how i'm going to get there yeah\ni mean i\ni'm going to gather your i'll go on a\nlimb here you're probably a reasonably\nadventuresome eater\njust because of the travel stuff that\nyou've yeah sure so you go into a\nrestaurant sometime and you see\nsomething on the menu\nand you go i have no idea what that is\nyeah\nbut you order it yeah to try it out yeah\nexperiment\nif you have that level of risk taking\nyou are fine right\nbecause something comes what the hell if\nyou don't like it you don't need it\nyeah right you know but occasionally you\nget amazed\nyeah and that's what's so wonderful\nabout trying things yeah that's\nbeautiful\nso well said and where is where on the\njourney is\nfeedback useful and what feedback is\nuseful because i think\nbecause i think you know you've you\ntalked about obviously a wife you talk\nabout this conversation with blockbuster\nand of course countless more but just\nthis i think a lot of us struggle with\npeople's opinions and how people's\nopinions hold us back or focus back\nand i'm not talking about the excuse\nkind i'm really focusing on feedback and\ngoing\nwhat type of feedback is useful and and\nhow do you\ndecipher whether that feedback is useful\nor not whether that's\nfrom a potential investor or a customer\nor client or whatever it may be\num none of it is useful\nwhy is that that's that's too simple a\nway to say it\nbut what you're hearing is mostly right\nnothing is useful or a different way to\nsay it and especially pertinent since\ni'm down here in\nhollywood is nobody knows anything\nnobody knows anything and that's the\nimmortal worlds\nof william goldman famous hollywood\nscreenwriter\nand ironically he wrote 20 movies and\nwon academy awards but is known for\nthose\nthree words from his adventures in the\nscreen trade book but he meant\nthat no one can tell how well a movie's\ngoing to do until after it does it\nit is absolutely true in any new venture\nno one knows and so anyone who tells you\nwell i think this or i think that\nthey don't know what they're talking\nabout the only feedback\nthat's valuable is the feedback that\ncomes from trying it and seeing how the\nreal person you want to respond\nactually responds\nthat's the only thing that counts\ninvestors no they don't know and they\nalso don't necessarily have the same\ncriteria in mind for success that you do\nyour spouse god bless them they have the\nwant the best for you but they don't\nknow either you just can't tell\nno one can tell a good idea from a bad\nidea the only way to do it is to try it\ni'm sorry i know that no it's great\nthat's it i wish there was a shortcut\nso i guess i guess looking at it from a\ndifferent perspective it's like when are\nmentors useful like you obviously mentor\npeople and guide and and how do you know\na mentor is useful that's a great\nquestion what type of yeah what type of\nquestion should you be asking and since\ni'm a mentor myself\ni guess i don't want to dismiss all of\nmy advice\nbut most of my advice is designed around\nhelping people\nget started and when they're starting\nhow to keep them on the right path of\ncontinually getting\ncustomer feedback yes and again i don't\nwant this to be too\ncommercial because this advice is good\nfor anybody who's trying to solve\nsomething yeah\nwhatever you think your problem is\ntrying to solve even if it's a problem\nof your own\nyou want to collide that with the\nreality as soon as you can and that's\nthe feedback\nbut yes having a mentor who understands\nwhat you're up against\nand has confidence in you and that you\nenjoy spending time with\nthat's the three uh the three critical\nthings\ninteresting i mean that now i can't\nremember at the very beginning of our\nconversation but\num in many ways\ni am le i do a lot of work with early\nstage\nfounders so i'm a mentor or you can call\nme a founder coach\num but what's interesting is most of my\njob is marriage counseling\nis that because the real challenges\nare those oh that's where this came from\nwe were talking about the beginning\nabout life balance\nyes how do you do this at the same time\nkeep yourself healthy and keep yourself\nsane and maintain your relationships and\nkeep your hobbies alive and so it's\nfunny\npeople can be brilliant marketers or\nbrilliant technologists and the thing\nthey struggle with is that\nwow and at least in the tech world where\ni spend a lot of my time the most stable\nconfiguration is two founders\nattacking a business but it's one from\nmars and one from venus\nyes and they're spending more time\ntogether than they would with their\npartners and you realize that helping\nthem keep that relationship healthy\nis critical and hard they have to\nit's incredibly lonely being a ceo\nbecause you\ncan't necessarily reveal everything to\nyour employees and you can't necessarily\nreveal everything to your board who is\nyour boss\nand so there's really no one who\nunderstands that you can talk to\nthat's another role that a mentor plays\nyou're kind of gathering\nnot just the role a mentor plays but how\nmuch of making a company successful\nis emotional and psychological\nyeah not technical and accounting\nyeah i love that answer let's dive a bit\ninto the marriage counseling because i\nknow that my audience is\nso focused on learning about\nrelationships and i love learning about\nit too and i'd love to hear from your\nperspectives and learn from you as well\nwhat have you seen have been the\nkind of like the building blocks of\nmaking sure that a\nrelationship with your spouse or your\ngirlfriend or boyfriend or whatever it\nmay be\nhas been able to be maintained through\nthe growth and momentum\nof a successful company so\none thing i've learned is um i can't\nspeak for humanity i i know what's\nworked for me\nyeah i'd love it but again i just want\nto make sure that\nyou know that there's not it's not a\nmiracle and i'm not a i'm not a\nguru in in this sort of thing but\nwhat works for me is radical honesty\num and what's interesting is that\nradical honesty is the principle that i\nuse with my wife\nit's what i use with my kids but it's\nwhat reid hastings and i\nuse with each other it's what i use with\nmy employees\nit's there's life is way too short to\n people and\nmore than that people are smart and they\ncan tell when they're being spun\nand there's something incredibly\npowerful about\nspeaking from the heart and honesty\ndoesn't mean just delivering bad news\nit means delivering good news it means\nrevealing your vulnerabilities it means\nadmitting i don't know\nsomething it means saying you're right\nand i was wrong\ni mean it but it's an incredibly\npowerful thing\num and i can't i can't recommend it\nenough\nyeah yeah absolutely but again it's not\neasy yeah\nand in terms of time and energy do you\nfeel that in the growth of the\nstages of a company it's is it\nimpossible is it\nlike literally impossible to spend\nquality time with your partner or is\nthere a\nis there any balance or you know what is\nthe reality of it i guess\nit's it's it is difficult i mean i i'm\nnot gonna sugarcoat it\num having a startup having launching\nnetflix\nwas like having a second family a family\nwho woke up in the middle of the night\nand cried\na family that required you to go away\nand take care of an emergency\nand you also have your real uh family\nand i had young kids who were waking up\nin the middle of the night and crying\nand were requiring me to travel away in\nemergencies\nso it pulls you in all directions and\nit's almost like the big rocks model of\ntime allocation you've got to pick the\nthings that are critical and make sure\nyou carve out\nthe space to fit those in and at netflix\nin those first few years even before\nthen my wife and i had this\nprinciple that every tuesday\n5 p.m sharp i would leave the office and\nshe had a babysitter and we would have a\ndate night\nyeah we just go downtown we'd go for a\nwalk we'd glass of wine go see a movie\nbut we'd spend time together away from\nthe kids away from\nthe business and it was really hard at\nfirst\nto preserve that time because it's a\nstartup and everyone's always grabbing\nyou\nso in an emergency emergency meeting\nbefore five yeah either talk to you on\nthe way to the car\nyeah but the magic of it is that once\nyou've defended it successfully for a\nmonth or two\neveryone realizes it's futile to even\nask\nand more importantly they all begin\ngoing like well nothing's gonna happen\non tuesdays after five i can now\ntake some time off on tuesday after five\nabsolutely and it ends up\num giving them space but perhaps the\nmost important thing\nis it models for everybody\nwhat the culture really is it models\nwhat the priorities are\nabsolutely if the ceo of the company\ncan do this well then i i guess i can i\ncan too yes\nand culture is not what you say yeah\nit's what you do\nyeah so we can talk all we want about\nhow we believe in family and balance\num but then no one ever takes vacations\nand everyone is there until midnight\nevery night that\nthat's saying one thing and doing\nanother which besides not modeling the\nbehavior\nalso says that you are insincere yeah\nliar so you know the um\nprobably the most important lesson that\ni've learned from\n40 years of being an entrepreneur is\nand this is going to sound strange but\ni am not that special i've\nreally come to realize that so much of\nwhat i've done are things that anybody\ncould do\nthat these things which i try and beat\ninto people\nare not rocket science they're not\nthings that take a great education you\ndon't even need to be that smart\nit's an attitude it's being willing to\nstart it's being willing to take a risk\nand those are things that\nanybody can do and i've just realized\nalmost everyone i speak to\nthey're smarter than i am they're hard\nworking more hard working than i\nam um they're better prepared than i am\num and they just need to get going\num and if i can let people know they can\ndo this\nthen i will really have accomplished\nsomething in my life\nthat's beautiful mark and thank you so\nmuch for placing such a strong emphasis\non life as opposed to just business and\nas opposed to just\ninvestments and mentorship and\nentrepreneurship but really putting that\nemphasis on relationships and love and\nconnection and service so thank you so\nmuch for doing that it's my pleasure\nyeah\nand i i think i love that about setting\nand preserving these rituals that's kind\nof what it is it's like\nit's not i think when we leave it open\nlike oh yeah we'll try and find some\ntime this week to spend time together\nyou never do yes right it's almost like\nit needs to be\nstructure lets you be spontaneous i feel\nlike i feel like if you just leave it to\nspontaneity\nthen you'll never find any structure but\nwhen you start with structure you can\nfind spontaneity so maybe one day you\nwent for a walk or you went for a dinner\nor you went for a movie\nand you could do whatever it was but\nsetting that structure is so helpful and\nuseful\ni really agree yeah and you know it and\nhaving rhythm\nrhythm yes rhythm helps as well i mean i\nknow that you have you have this nice\nrhythm set up\nso you know okay mondays i'm i'm busy\nyes\nbut other days you can grab time for\nother things i mean it's a\nit's just a matter of figuring out how\nto make your life work\nwith your work yes absolutely no i love\nthat great advice and and then\nagain what you mentioned the second\npartnership which is usually this\nco-founder partnership and you and\nreid hastings used to commute to work\ntogether yeah right tell us about that\nbecause that's fascinating is\nis that pretty common in in the startup\nworld of\nco-founders no community and\nit's cool i love it i think it's great\nit is i mean and\none little piece of it is that so much\nof a startup is luck\ni mean there's certainly a lot of things\nabout the netflix story which were luck\nthe dvd player actually being widely\nadopted was luck\nthe fact that blockbuster said no was\nluck\ni mean you can you know i'm here\nbecause i did a bunch of things right\nbut i also had a huge amount of things\nbreak my way\nbut one of the lucky breaks was that\nreid hastings company bought\na company that i had helped start um and\nthat was luck but then the real luck was\nthat he ended up\nhappened to coincide live in the same\ntown as i did\nand that we began carpooling back and\nforth and so we became\nfriends in this weird\nway that would probably not have\nhappened organically\nand then the other lucky thing is this\ncompany that reed was running that\nwhat my company it was again acquired by\nsomeone else\nand we were both being fired so there\nwas another lucky break\nso a lot of things conspired to all of a\nsudden have reed and i\ntogether on a 40-minute uh to\n40-hour commute knowing that in six\nmonths\nor so we'd both be out of jobs wow and\nthat began the process of saying\nwhat reid was saying i'm going to go\nback to uh back to school\nget my higher degree in education and\nchange the world and\nme saying i'm going to go start another\ncompany\nand then him saying i kind of want to\nkeep my hands in this whole\nentrepreneurial thing\nso how about this i will be your angel\ninvestor\nand we decided to come up with an idea\ntogether and that i would he'd fund it\ni would run it and away we'd go\nand that began these crazy car rides um\nover the hill as we call it going over\nthe mountains uh every day from santa\ncruz to sunnyvale\nbrainstorming ideas brainstorming\nideas about pain we had about ideas we'd\ncome up with\num and going back to that amazing life\nof an idea\nmost of the ideas we came up with were\nterrible\nyeah i mean this is not like we're going\ngosh we've got to think of an idea about\nmovies because we're both passionate\nabout movies we were throwing all kinds\nof\ncrap at the wall i mean one of the\nthings netflix almost was\nwas uh personalized baseball bats\nlike made on a computer-driven milling\nmachine right like just\nyour exact specifications jay um another\nuh was\ncustomized shampoo like you send mail in\na lock of your hair\nand we'd formulate it just for you but\ni'd then go into my little office and\nresearch them all day and then the drive\nback i would tell reed what i learned\nand\nlittle by little um went through\nhundreds of ideas and even one of them\num\nwas let's do video rental let's try\nvideo rental by mail\nbecause video rental big category and i\nhad previously in my career done a lot\nof\num mail order stuff and direct mail\nuh getting stuff you knew stuff i knew\nyeah then i'd seen the problems and\nboth of us had seen the problems with\nvideo rental who hadn't\num but back then video came on those vhs\ncassettes\nyes i remember yeah you know i'm your\nage you probably watch lion king about\nsix thousand\ntimes yes yes yes yes on your vhs\ncassette um\nbut uh it didn't work like too heavy too\nexpensive too fragile\nand so that idea got abandoned and then\non to the next crazy idea\nand that's where the dvd came in because\non one of these rides reed mentioned\nthis new technology dvd\nand they go wow what is it like well\nit's this little disc the size the music\ncd\nand we're going huh thin and light it's\ncheap\nyeah sheep this this might change some\nthings but then that's where it comes\ndown to\ndon't think act so rather than this big\ndebate\nabout who can we ask whether mailing a\ndvd is too fragile and who can we let's\nbuild a business plan and let's imagine\nhow we're going to build the website we\nmight screw it let's just take the first\nstep and see if you can actually mail\none of these things to yourself\nwhich is when we turned the car around\nand drove back to santa cruz and went to\nlogos record and tape used music store\nand bought a\npatsy klein music cd and then two doors\ndown to the stationery shop and bought\nthe little pink gift envelope that you'd\nput a greeting card in yes and\ncd in the envelope and dress to reed's\nhouse in santa cruz and pop it in the\nslot\nand go to work and then 24 hours later\nreed shows up doesn't even say a word\njust holds up\na little cd unbroken that got to his\nhouse for 29 cents\nand we went there might be some merit to\nthis\nvideo by mail after all wow\nso you see that in all the examples\nyou're sharing with me we know that the\nmore we experiment\nthe more we fail right it's the more we\nexperiment the more you're gonna fail\nbecause the more mistakes you're gonna\nmake the more you're gonna have to pivot\nthe more you're gonna have to figure\nthings out\nhow have you and reid consistently gone\nthrough failure after failure after\nfailure\nand and how when was there a time when\nyou were failing where you just felt\nlike this is\nnot gonna happen like this is not\nworking and how did you get through that\none\nso um\nevery failure is\na learning and people\ngo tell me your biggest failure and i\nfeel like a\nfool because i sit there like oh i can't\ni can't think because you were learning\nbut yeah i don't frame it that way\nwhat's your biggest lesson there you go\nyeah i mean i got a million of those\nyeah because so many of my ideas were\nterrible\nyeah um biggest lesson okay\nit's the power of focus\nand the courage of walking away\nfrom today in exchange for tomorrow\nand that sounds so simple\nand boy it's hard and when we launched\nnetflix it sold dvds and it rented dvds\nand about two months in we were crushing\nit\nmillion a hundred thousand dollars in\nthat first month\nall selling dvds and that was a disaster\nbecause we knew amazon was going to come\nin and that was not sustainable and we\ndid this for months and months and\nkept couldn't get rental to work and\nthen finally realized that\ndoing the sales is not is paying the\nbills\nbut ironically it's making it harder to\nget rental to work because it's\nconfusing for customers\nwe're spending all of our time on sales\nand not focusing on rental\nso there you come down to the\nrealization if you're going to do\nsomething\npick one thing and do everything you've\ngot on it\nbut then comes the courage which is what\ndo you focus on the sales which is\npaying the bills but it's eventually\ngoing to go out of business\nor do you bet at all on this unproven\ntechnology there's renting dvds by the\nmail which was showing no signs\nso we in one day\npulled the plug walked away from selling\ndvds entirely\n99 of our revenue turned off like a\nlight switch\nbut it focused the mind on how to make\nrental work and this scale's large\nthat everyone has this problem where\nthey're doing something that's working\nand they know that's not the future\nthat's not what people want in the\nfuture\nyeah but they're scared to do it and you\ncan take it at a personal level\nyou really want to take a swing at doing\nthis\nbut god i have this job and i it's\npaying my rent and\nand you're trapped and that is the most\ntragic\nthing i can imagine yeah people feeling\ntrapped\num and i'm not naive i'm not saying you\nknow walk away\nyeah just pull the plug but start\nstart dreaming about it will leave you\ntrapped even longer\nyou have to recognize it's really hard\nto do two things\nreally really well yeah yeah i know i\nand i agree with you i think you know\ni've had mentors\nwho've said to me before that you know\nwhen you're really in pain that's when\nyou will find your potential and\nthat's when you'll be able to break\nthrough and i used to always be like oh\nyeah that makes sense but i'm proactive\nlike that's not true like you know and\nthen i realized that actually when you\nfelt\nthe plug was being pulled for you or you\npulled the plug for yourself that's when\nyou really dug deep\nyeah and you almost work harder because\nnow you can't come back\nto what you had the day before in terms\nof your example you're not coming back\nto\noh yeah we already know we make x amount\nof money through this right you've now\nmade it\nimpossible for yourself to rely on\nsomething that doesn't have a future\nand now you've got to find something and\nit's in that point that you're more\nlikely to find something\nbecause you don't have a choice\nabsolutely and i think it's almost like\ngiving yourself no choice whenever\nthat's right for you\npersonally is is a good way to go\nbecause i've found that when i've had no\nchoice\nthat's often been the time when i've\ndone my best work absolutely yeah and it\nis it's a courage thing too\ni mean you can wait a desperation but\nyou can also say i'm going to just give\nit a shot do you\nyou know ernest shackleton is no i don't\nknow ernest shackleton he's\nhe's kind of my hero okay there's he's a\npolar explorer\nokay and this is the turn of this turn\nof the last century\nand he wanted to be the first person to\ntravel\nto travel by land over uh the antarctic\ncontinent so i will not tell this whole\nstory it is the most\nunbelievable story though but anyway he\nhas this boat it's the unsinkable\nwooden boat and he's dr sailing to drop\noff him in his expedition and they get\nstuck in the ice\nand they go no big deal so they all pile\noff the they will wait for the spring\nwhen it melts so they all pile off and\nthey have camps on the ice\nbut of course the ice crushes the boat\nand the boat sinks\nso now they're all sitting on this ice\nfloe and it's pretty cushy\nthey've got have dog sled races and\nthey've got all kinds of food and they\nhave wood from the boat for fires\nand he's watching this ice flow as the\nspring comes\ngets smaller and smaller and he's going\nwell i can sit here in my comfortable\nsurroundings\nyeah until all of a sudden we're all\ndropped in the ocean or i could take\nadvantage of the fact that it's spring\nyeah and there's open water and i can\nput my entire expedition in our three\nlifeboats yeah and see what happens\nand it thus begins one of the most\nunbelievable\nstories of uh adventure and leadership\nyou could ever ever tell but it's i i've\nalways thought about that yeah this guy\nwho\nlooked around and everyone's comfortable\nand said we can't\nsit and be comfortable yeah it's what\nhappened at netflix what happens\nall over the place i love that thank you\nso much\nyou're amazing you're an incredible\nstoryteller uh you're fascinating to\ntalk too i'm excited for everyone else\nto read this book\nthat will never work i genuinely believe\nthat if you've got a big idea you've got\na small idea you've got no idea\nthis book's gonna help you navigate the\nprocess of getting started\nand then navigate the process of\nactually making it happen and i think\nthose two are so\ndistant it feels sometimes they feel so\nfar away\nbut uh this book will definitely\ndefinitely get you closer mark we end\nevery interview with the final five\nso i ask you a final five rapid five\nquick five questions so you have to\nanswer each question in one word\nto one sentence maximum if i allow you\nto go on then you can and i probably\nwill because\nno you don't know so here are the\nquestions\nthe final five number one what's your\nfavorite slice of pizza\nstart easy oh uh\nplain cheese man nice yeah question\nnumber two the best\ntrail you've ever hiked or your favorite\nhike of all time because i know you uh\nit's the uh uh\noh crap it's the the one along the coast\nof of italy\nthe connect the cinque terre okay\nwonderful it's a small why that one\nit's a small trail that can these five\ntowns which are only accessible by\nfishing boat really old towns and\nthey've built this network of trails\nthat connects the five towns\nthat run right along the ocean amazing\nspectacular i love that okay awesome\nquestion number three\none company you wish you started\nuh am i allowed to hit a buzzer and pass\nuh yeah i i guess another way of\nrephrasing it is\na problem you wish you would have solved\nwas there a problem that you try to\nsolve but then you've seen someone else\nactually solve it really well\nif there is if there isn't then you can\npass and i'll do it i'll choose another\none what does it say about me that i\ncan't immediately jump to a one-word\nanswer about it no that's good because\nof course there's hundreds of things\nwhere i go oh my god that was so clever\ni wish i'd done that\nyeah i can't that's okay that's cool\nwe'll substitute that for another one so\nyour question number three is\ntell us about the canada principle yeah\none\nmore than one sentence yeah you can have\nsomeone said uh\nsometimes it seems that you can easily\nget a 10 lift for example as we could\nhave by expanding to canada\nbut it's always harder than you think\nand that if you take that same\n10 of time or effort or attention and\nfocus it on your core problem\nyou'll reap much bigger rewards another\nway of saying it\nbeware of low hanging fruit because it\nrarely is\nnice wonderful great piece of advice\nawesome question number four your\nfavorite\nshow to binge watch or your favorite tv\nshow uh\ni made everyone else we have so much\naccess to almost done with sex education\nokay oh my god that is hysterical and\nfantastic yeah\nawesome yeah no i was thinking one of\nthe one of the problems i'm just going\noff on a tangent here\ni think one of the problems that i\nalways think about when you talk about\nthe paint can\nwhat what i was thinking about was\nstruggling to find what to watch at\nnight\nthat's that is literally the problem i\nthink of all day long i'm literally me\nand my wife\ncould sit down and we could spend an\nhour trying to figure out what to watch\nespecially when it's two of us i can\nfigure out what to watch when i'm on my\nown there's two of us and then you don't\nwatch anything because it's too late\nwhy is that so hard what someone out\none of your listeners has to like\ntotally go fix that\nyeah but here's another principle which\nuh isn't is that\nif something seems obvious\nthere's something you don't know right\nso go on\ntell us more that it's just that if it's\nsomething what you have to do before you\nhave this great idea\nand you go it seems like there should be\nan obvious solution there's something\nyou're missing\nso you've got to do is do the research\nand say who has tried this\nyes what is the unknown barrier that i\njust don't see\nyes otherwise you end up just repeating\nthe same mistake someone else has made\nbefore\nabsolutely absolutely so someone out\nthere please go and solve this yes\nplease yeah and tell me about it yeah\nyeah yeah yeah exactly i wrote mark\nabout it by tomorrow hopefully\ni love it and the fifth and final\nquestion is what is one habit you're\nmost proud of breaking\nmost out of breaking of breaking yeah\nany habits that you've broken in your\nlife that you think were good\nmental physical sure a recent one is uh\nthe cell phone\num addiction okay tell us about that no\ni mean uh\nit's it's such an obvious one but\neveryone is afflicted with it and now\nit's almost like being a non\nnext smoker which i was never a smoker\nbut now you see people and you go oh my\ngod what are you doing\nthe constant pulling it out this uh\nhabitually yeah and it's just taken me\nthis sense of saying\nleave it in your pocket leave it and i\nfinally actually got to the point where\nnow i\nno longer have that urge to grab for the\nphone at every time i have a spare\nmoment\nand it's it's partly this wonder\nwonderfulness the this wonder of\nstopping\nand taking it in i mean it's a medi it's\na standing meditation\nwhen you're in line or when the plane\nlands\nand everyone goes on their phone no just\nlook around\ni mean it's such a it's a cool it's a\ncool replacement\nyeah i'm really really digging it so\nyou know i i i was um\n[Music]\nthis was unfortunately not too long ago\nbut i was flying someplace and i was\nflying first class\num and something was wrong\nyou know i don't know something with the\nseat or i didn't get my first choice of\nmeal\nor the little wet little towel was too\ndry or something\nso stupid and i remember us complaining\nto my wife and i had this\nthis revelation like you stupid bastard\nhow\nhow dare you how could you possibly\nbe complaining about something like that\nand it was this moment\nwhere i realized i am so unbelievably\nlucky\ni have to appreciate everything\nabout how unbelievably fortunate um that\ni've been\nthat i've had this idea that actually\nturned into a real\na real company that had the chance to\nspend time with my wife and my family\nand have all these things happen i\ndo not deserve anything else especially\nnot to be complaining about that\nso i think i take back my stupid\nanswer about the cell phones that is not\nthe most important habit the most\nimportant habit i broke was\npity yeah and
