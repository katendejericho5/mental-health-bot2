a while so i'm\nglad that we're we're both finally here\nright now\nfor sure and uh i'm just wanted to say\nthat when i've been looking through your\nbook i've been looking through your work\nwe were just chatting outside for a few\nmoments you seem like a wonderful\ngentleman like i\ni love your energy uh i think the work\nthat you're doing is really incredible\nand genuine and i think that\nthe way you're presenting this message\nis so refreshing fresh and simple\nand and i really value that thank you so\nmuch for doing your work yeah i\nappreciate that jay i think\nyou know look i've been seeing patients\nnow for nearly 20 years\nand for me i've always i've always taken\nseriously how do you really communicate\nwith people so they actually do\nwhat you would like them to do i've\nnever had that view that actually\npatients aren't doing what i've asked\nthem to do i've always thought how can i\ncommunicate better to inspire them to\nmake changes and i think when you can\nreally simplify things down\npeople feel hey you know what i can do\nthat because i think so many people feel\nlike health is\ntoo complicated i think one of my big\naims is to try and simplify it\nyeah and i think you're doing a\nwonderful job of that and i think you're\nso right i've always looked at it as\nlike\nif you look at the teacher and the\nstudent or the doctor and the patient\nit's almost like\nif a teacher or a doctor is at a ten and\nthe patient or the student really wants\nto learn and they're out of ten then\nyou've got this incredible relationship\nand then\noften what you find though is that the\npresentation is like at a five\nand the patient's at a three and then\nyou're both struggling to kind of make\nanything happen so\ni'm totally with you and i'm gonna be a\nvery what's wrong with i'm gonna be a\nvery sincere patient today\nas i ask these questions on behalf of\nmyself and my audience well fantastic\nand and i know for me health was always\nsomething that was never\nemphasized in my family i always i grew\nup quite overweight actually\nuh and i was like until 14 years old\nand then i lost a lot of weight because\ni got into a lot of sports and just\nnaturally started to lose weight\nthe interesting thing was that then i\ndeveloped this almost like\nyou know this feeling of just like\nhealth to me just meant not being\noverweight\nyeah and i didn't realize there was so\nmuch more to it tell me about some of\nthe reasons\nof the way we think health is so complex\nand some of the things that block us and\nhold us back with our health\nyeah i think what really holds us back\nis\na i think the fact that people online\nare arguing over what is the best way to\ndo something i think that is one of the\nreasons that leads to inactivity\nbecause people think okay i want to\nimprove my diet let's say for example\nand then they they read one blog or they\nsee a social media post from one doctor\nor one\nhealthcare professional that they like\nwhich is in complete contrast to what\nanother one who they also respect and\nadmire says\nright so i think this confusion leads to\ninactivity\ni think that's one reason i think the\nother thing is right good reason the\nother thing for me\nis that i think we just we overly focus\non one area\nokay like everyone talks about their\ndiet of course diet is important but\nit's only one component\nand i guess like what i did in my first\nbook is i talked about\nfour key pillars of health yes the four\nareas that i think\nhave the most impact on the way we feel\nbut also that we've got a fair degree of\ncontrol over i think that control piece\nis important because\nthere's so much out that we can't\ncontrol like you know air pollution for\nexample so i really prefer to focus on\nthe things that we can\nchange and so my approach is very much\nabout look\nhave a look at your own life look at\nthese four areas which one of those\npillars do\nyou need the most work in most people\nintuitively know but\ni tell you jay what a lot of people do\nlet's say they change their diet\nand they're feeling a lot better then\nthey'll sort of like their diet is like\n80\ngood they'll focus even more on another\nfive percent improvement another\nyou know i oh i'm having a little bit of\nsugar on saturday i need to cut that out\nand they're forgetting the fact that\nthey're already sleeping five hours a\nnight or they're chronically stressed\nout and so\ni prefer people to take a much more\nbalanced approach\nsure change your diet but don't neglect\nthe other areas so for me it's all about\nsmall changes in these four areas which\nmake a\nbig big change and i've seen it time\nand time again it is not about doing the\nmost extreme diet\ncutting everything out never going out\nsocially because actually you can't eat\nanywhere\nit's about putting things in perspective\nand small things done consistently\nmake huge huge differences and and\nwhat's the starting point like if you're\nsomeone who's i guess more on the other\nend where you're kind of just like your\nhealth's just been kind of something\nthat's going on you kind of\neat wherever you want and you're pretty\nflexible everything what's the starting\npoint like what's been your place of\nlike\nthis is a good place to start like this\nis a fairly easy level playing field for\neveryone to get going on\nyeah so it is highly dependent on the\ncontext it's highly dependent on the\nindividual\num again i would ask them to look at\nthose four areas and think about which\none\nthey feel they need the most work in\nfood\nmovement sleep and relaxation great so\ni think that's a useful place to start i\ndo and then you sort of focus on the one\narea let's say you think actually you\nknow what i'm not\nreally moving my body much okay fine\nmaybe you want to start there and so\ni give an example like i was in um my\nclinic seeing patients a few years ago\nmaybe seven eight years ago now and i\nsaw this\nchap i think it was maybe late 30s early\n40s\na little bit overweight um struggling\nwith energy struggling to concentrate\nyou know just general stuff going on and\nhe wanted some help\nand at that time i thought you know what\nwill really help you i think some sort\nof strength training is going to help\nyou because it helps\nchange your mood or give you energy um\nand he really liked that and he said\nokay dr\nchelsea what do you want me to do then i\ni think that's a great idea\nwould you like me to do 45 minutes three\ntimes a week at the gym and i said hey\nthat would be amazing yeah fantastic he\ngoes off feeling inspired and full of\nmotivation\nfour weeks later he comes back i see him\nand i say hey look\nhave you got on and he said ah doc you\nknow what uh work's been busy\nthe gym is quite far away it's quite\nexpensive i've not actually done\nanything\nso jay i never thought in that moment\nwhy has he not done what i've asked him\nto do\ni just thought wrong and you've clearly\nnot given him\nadvice that he feels is relevant and\npractical in the context of his own life\nso in that moment i literally\ni took my jacket off and said right i'm\ngoing to teach you a\nfive-minute workout that you can do\nin your house without joining a gym\nwithout buying any equipment\nand without even getting changed it's\nwhat i call like the five-minute kitchen\nworkout\nand i said i would like to do that twice\na week he goes off\nand um he comes back a few weeks later\nbut before he left he said\njust twice a week just 10 minutes a week\ni said yeah that's all i want you to do\nwhen i review him four weeks later i\nsaid how are you getting on he said\nthat's jashi i love it right i started\noff doing it five minutes twice a week\nnow i do it 10 minutes every single day\nin my kitchen\njust before i have my evening dinner and\ni think\nthe reason i use that story is this\nwhatever change we're trying to make in\nour life\nit doesn't have to be like this big\nunattainable goal we can break it right\ndown to the simplest possible\num you know the simple possible way of\ndoing that\njust do small things consistently and i\nfind\nthose five minutes twice a week suddenly\nbecomes 10 minutes seven days a week so\nnow that guy who would never work out\nis doing 70 minutes of strength training\na week he's losing weight he's got more\nenergy he feels\nbetter about himself that then impacts\nhis relationship with his\nwife because he's feeling better about\nhimself suddenly he's no longer the\nperson\nwho can't make changes his identity\nstarts to shift\nand i know jay you're a big fan of\nmeditation i have made deals with my\npatients before\nto do one minute a day now again that\nmay sound well what's one what are they\ngonna do\nbut i found when i asked people to do 20\nminutes a day they'd do it for two days\nthree days four days then suddenly it\nwould get busy one day\nthey wouldn't be able to do it and then\nthey suddenly become identity wise oh i\ncan't do that meditation's not for me\nand there's one particular patient\nactually um\nin actually yeah where did she live i\ncan't remember where she lived\nbut one particular patient who said\nmeditation is not for me\nand i knew that actually her stress\nlevels\nwere the main driving uh factor in her\nhealth her weight\ni think was coming from her stress and a\nlot of her hormonal symptoms were\ngetting flared up\nand she said i can't do it i've tried it\nand i said okay\ndo you think you can do you know how\nmuch do you think you can do\nin a day i said do you think you could\ndo 10 minutes i'm not sure\nso that you could do five minutes maybe\nand then i said okay how about one\nminute do you think you can do one\nminute yeah\ni could definitely do one minute i said\nokay so let's make a deal now you're\ngonna do one minute of meditation\nbecause it's the uk she um she gets them\nin the morning and puts\na cup of tea on right she she goes\ndownstairs since the kitchen puts the\nkettle on i said okay what do you\nnormally do when you put the kettle on\num i'll just probably jump onto my phone\nand\nscroll social media or something i said\nokay fine\nwhen you put the castle on each morning\ninstead of going on your phone why don't\nyou do your one-minute meditation then\nwhy don't you stick it on to a habit\nthat you're already doing so you don't\nhave to find time in your day\nanyway she does this and amazing within\ntwo months she's doing like 20 minutes a\nday because what happens\nthe one minute each morning suddenly\nbecomes a habit she starts to feel good\none minute becomes two minutes two\nminutes becomes five five becomes ten\nnot because i asked her to increase it\nbut because she starts to feel good so\nlook i have so many tips but the point i\ni've realized that when you keep the bar\nsuper low people feel good about\nthemselves\nthey do it and then they start to raise\nthe bar naturally themselves\nyes yeah no i think that's great advice\nand thank you for sharing those i love\nthose and\ni've always said to everyone like i\nthink all habit change are small things\nthat are big priorities yeah and usually\nwe do it the other way around we dry do\nbig things and they're all a small\npriory so we're trying to do this big\nthing like you're saying like go to the\ngym like every day\nfor an hour a day you're trying to\nachieve this big thing but it's like\nthrown in underneath all your other\npriorities where if you just try and do\none small\nminute a day but make it a big priority\nanother thing that i'm fascinated by\nthat that's really helped me\nwhen i'm sharing and teaching and and\ndoing it is not the big goal but\nthe deep immersive experience okay so so\nand hear me out i'd love to get your\nthoughts yes so what i say to a lot of\npeople is just\nwhen i hear the oh yeah i'm doing 10\nminutes of meditation a day but it\ndoesn't do anything for me it doesn't\nwork for me\nfor people who can what i recommend is\njust like if you can go away and do\na day retreat for meditation or if you\ncan go to the gym\nwith a personal trainer just for three\ndays and you get a really\ndeep experience of what it feels like to\nreally work out\nto really have an awesome experience to\nto really know how to use the machines\nand what to do and what to do with your\nmind when you've had that really deep\nimmersive experience that leaves such a\nlasting impression on us\nthat we now go i want to get back there\ni want to do that yeah and sometimes\nwhat we're doing is if you only ever do\n10 minutes it's like it takes me 10\nminutes to switch off my mind every day\nyeah let alone meditate\nyeah so it's almost like if you push\nyourself a little more in the beginning\nand get a bit of a taste or an\nexperience it's even like with anything\nif you wanted to learn how to surf\nand you did it one whole weekend yeah i\nguarantee you even if you fell off a\nmillion times\nyou'd still have had one glimpse of how\ncool it would be yeah\nexactly you do it again but if you only\nserve for 10 minutes\nyou you won't get to that point and then\nyou'll feel like oh well i can't surf\nyeah i think i think jay it's such a\ngreat way of looking at it because\nyou know circling back to one of your\ninitial questions it's like well why\naren't people doing this why\ndo we struggle to make these changes and\ni think sometimes we just don't know\nwe're not doing enough to know how we're\ngonna feel and we and we're a bit\nconfused we're like\noh i need some medicine well i don't\nreally know how to do it am i doing it\nright am i meant to be shutting off my\nmonkey minds and\nactually learning how to do it like\ninvesting\nyeah sure it might take a bit of money\nbut also really investing your time\nto spend like a day or two days learning\nhow to do it\nthen i think you can tap into like five\nminutes a day if you want to because\nyou've got something to\nyou know to reference it by or you know\nif someone wants to take up yoga for\nexample but they're a bit confused\nsure there's many great youtube channels\nthat people can go and learn i totally\nget that but there's also something\nsuper powerful about going to a local\nclass\nyes 100 like go to your class maybe a\nfew times\nconnect with like-minded people but then\ngo you know what\nactually maybe i can do 10 minutes of\nthis every day yeah maybe i can do this\nwith my partner for 10 minutes every day\nand i think\nit's really not as complicated as we\nthink and that's\ni think that's my key message that i\nreally try and get across to everyone\nwhether they're the ceo of a company\nor whether they're a single mom on\nbenefits working\ntwo jobs i'm super passionate that all\nof us have\nyou know have the right to good quality\nhealth information\num i think the same things are affecting\npeople in all walks of life sure the\nstresses and the life of someone who's\non benefits\nare working two jobs and a single mum\nmay be very different stressors\nfrom the ceo of a company but\nnonetheless some of those solutions\nare actually very very similar no i love\nthat point and one of the things you\npointed out there which i think doesn't\nget talked about enough\nis you talked about being with\nlike-minded people and how have you seen\nwhen you've worked with people the\ndifference between people who try and do\nthings collectively\ncollaboratively and with that\naccountability versus people who are\njust doing things individually like\nhow have you seen that because i think\nthat's a really important point you\nraised there yeah look\ni had a really um really phenomenal\nexperience so my first two tv shows was\nsomething called doctor in the house\nand these are people who were struggling\nwith the health\nand often been under their primary care\ndoctor often been under a specialist\noften were taking loads of pills\nand they still weren't feeling good and\ni would go into their houses for four to\nsix weeks and try and help them and i'm\nyou know super grateful that i managed\nto help\nall of them sometimes get rid of their\nconditions but certainly\nsignificantly improve the way they would\nwould you live with them as well i would\nactually yeah that's insane\nyeah i would i would not the whole time\nyeah stay a few nights which i think\nfrankly is probably a bit awkward for me\nand the family to have this kind of\nwellness doctor in their house observing\neverything\nbut i tell you you do learn stuff when\nyou do that you see\nstuff in a way that you just wouldn't\notherwise have seen you pick up on\nvarious things\nrelationship dynamics stresses that are\ngoing on\nhow people eat not only what they eat\nhow are they eating\ni'll tell you one thing from that that i\nreally discovered and this is probably\none of my top tips actually\nis i went around all these different\nfamilies around the uk\nit's the same here in america people\naren't eating together\nright i would go into families or\ncouples and\nit would be dinner time like the dad\nmight be in the kitchen\neating the mum might be on one end of\nthe sofa watching\ntelevision the daughter the teenage\ndaughter was on the other end of the\nsofa\non facebook while she was eating and the\nsun was somewhere else i remember\nso so well and i would make a\nrecommendation to all of these guys\nso guys look i know you guys are busy\nyou've got different routines\nmaybe just for one meal a day if you can\nsit around a table together put your\nphones off and see what happens\nnow what was really interesting whether\nit was a family or whether it was a\nyoung couple\nright all of them reported back to me\nhey you know what like i'm eating better\nbut i feel closer to the people around\nme like\nthis uh this couple the guy said to me\nyou know what it's\ni can't believe how much it's changed\nthings because i'm talking to my wife\nnow i'm actually finding\nout about her day and we're we're\nfeeling closer we're getting more\nintimate\nand all stem from just easing together\nand this is something i'm so passionate\nabout that\nas i know you are many times these days\nwe're with the people who mean the world\nto us right we're with our friends\nwe're with our partners we're with our\nkids we're physically with them but\nmentally we're not in the same room\nwe're sort of lost in our\nphones and look i'm not criticizing i\nwill do this sometimes\nokay so i'm not trying to say i'm whiter\nthan white here no i have this issue as\nwell it's a constant battle\nbut even when we're with these people\nthat we love we're not present\nyes and i think that is a key thing for\nus and it's not about getting rid of\nyour phones right it's simply about\nhey a bit of priority like maybe at meal\ntimes\nmaybe actually when you have when you're\nout for dinner with your friends or when\nyou're sitting at home with your family\nor your girlfriend or your boyfriend\nmaybe just put the phones away it is\nsuch a simple thing\nit makes a huge huge difference so that\nwas sort of one element oh yeah i love\nthat\nyeah it's all no no that's a great\nanswer i'm really glad you brought that\nup and\nit's interesting that you observed that\nwhen you were living with family\nbecause that's something we don't see\nyou know you don't think you don't think\nof that as being a block to health and\ni know that for me and that's one of the\nreasons what we're talking about earlier\nlike\ni have a commitment with my wife and\nthat was that i would have dinner\nfour to five nights a week with her yeah\nand so like when we first moved to new\nyork and moved to l.a i was getting\ninvited to all these networking events\nand all these cool places to be\nand like dinners with this person\ndinners with that person and it was\nalways just like\ni was like if i can't take my wife with\nme i don't want to do that because then\nwe don't you don't see that person\nright and this one meal a day that\nyou're asking people to do\nit's not that difficult to do one meal a\nday jay look it's such a good point we\nthere's so much um opportunity out there\nthese days many of us\nuh you know we as i do we look at our\ninstagram and we're like oh god that\nguy's doing that cool thing or that\noh i should do that i want to do that\nyou feel like you're missing out if\nyou're not doing this stuff\nbut we really got to focus internally\nand go i would ask people\nlistening to this podcast who are the\npeople that are actually really\nimportant to you\nhave you spent real quality time with\nthem recently if you haven't that's okay\njust be aware of that and try and figure\nout what can i do\num can i give you another example that\nwhere the illustrator says so\nso i saw this 36 37-yard chat in my\nclinic\nand he was from the outside really\nreally successful right\nown business um driving a sports car\nhe was working late into the evening on\nhis business\nemails saturdays sundays working all the\ntime\nand he gave me to see me and he said\ndoctor chassis look look\num things are starting to change like\ni'm i'm quite low in energy sometimes\ni can't maintain my concentration a lot\nof the time\nsometimes i struggle to get out of bed\nand sometimes i'm feeling a little bit\nlow\num is this what depression is and i said\nokay look let's try and figure out\nwhat's going on so look we spent a lot\nof time talking\ni did some tests they were all normal\nand\nit became super clear to me that he\nnever saw any of his friends\nnow he was actually quite lucky he lived\nin the place where he grew up\nso he had friends who lived nearby but\nhe never saw them he said\nyeah i kind of i see what they're up to\non social media so like he would see\npictures of where they were going\nhe would see pictures of what they were\nwhere they were going on holiday\nhe see pictures of what they had for\ndinner last night but he wasn't seeing\nthem\nand i said to him look i tell you what\nare you open to this what i\nthink will be really helpful for you so\nin the next six weeks i want you to see\nat least\none of your friends once a week and when\nyou see them i'd love you to consider\nputting your phones away\nand just being really present for the\ninteraction and you know he was pretty\ndesperate because he was at a low stage\nso he said yeah okay i'll give that a go\nsix weeks later he comes back in and i\nsay hey look um how you getting on\nhe said doc i feel like a different\nperson my energy's up my mood's better\ni'm\ni'm smashing it at work i feel really\ngood i said\nokay great what did you do he said well\nthe very first time i played five aside\nfootball with my friends who i've not\nseen him for years\ni said okay and then he goes but after\nthat we didn't really have time\nevery sunday morning we went to the\nlocal cafe and we just caught up for an\nhour\nand we just caught up for an hour over a\nlatte\nthat is all he did so my question is did\nthis chap have a mental health problem\nhe certainly had symptoms that were\nconsistent with that sort of diagnosis\nor was it worthy that he had a\ndeficiency of friendship in his life and\nwhen he corrected his friendship\ndeficiency\neverything comes back online he feels\nbetter he's working better\nhe's more productive you know he's got\nmore energy and i think that's a very\npowerful story because\nwe are told that we're living in this\nultra-connected time that we've never\nbeen this more connected and sure\nin a digital sense i absolutely agree\nbut when it comes to\nreal deep human meaningful connection\ni'm not sure we've been this isolated um\nand i think\nyou know i don't know you may have\ndiscussed this on the podcast before\nstudies have shown that actually the\nfeeling of being lonely\nis as harmful for your health as smoking\n15 cigarettes a day\nthat and if people are wondering why\nthat is can i would you mind if i\nbriefly explain that yeah i'm listening\nyou've got to understand that your\nstress response is there to keep you\nsafe\nright that's what it's there for it\nevolved millions of years ago so very\nsimplistically two million years ago\nyou're in your hunter-gatherer community\nuh getting on with your\nyour business doing whatever you're\ndoing if the wild predator was to attack\nor to approach\nyour stress response would kick into\ngear so many things would happen in your\nbody\nright um your blood sugar will start to\nrise so you can run faster\nyou're amygdala that's the emotional\npart of your brain\nthat would go onto high alerts so that\nyou're hyper vigilant to all the threats\naround you\nyou know that's an appropriate response\nwhen you are literally in danger\nthe problem today is is that our stress\nresponses have been activated\nnot by wild practices but by our daily\nlives\nso if your email inbox and your to-do\nlist is stressing you out every day\nyour body might be pushing your blood\nsugar up every day which is going to\ncause low energy\nobesity and ultimately lead to type 2\ndiabetes if\nyou're stressed out every day your\namygdala is going to be on high alert so\nyou're going to be hyper vigilant to all\nthe threats around you\njay that's an appropriate response\nthere's a predator there that's an\nappropriate response if we're in\ndowntown l.a\nat night walking down the street and we\nthink someone might be following us\nyou want to be on high alert but if\nthat's happening day and day out to your\nlife\nthat's what we call anxiety yeah right\nso once you understand the\nfundamentals of the stress response you\ncan understand why 90\nof what a doctor like me sees in any\ngiven day is in some way related to\nstress\nso if we go back to this loneliness\npiece\nif you were lonely why is it so toxic\ntwo million years ago if you were not\npart of your tribe\nif you were outside your tribe your body\nis super smart\nyour body's figured out that hey i'm now\nvulnerable to attack\ni better prepare in case i do get\nattacked so your body becomes inflamed\nyour immune system gets ramped up all\nthese things happen to protect you\nthe problem is that's happening to many\nof us these days\nfrom feeling lonely from this lack of\nreal human connection\nit literally changes our biology this is\nnot\nkind of the soft stuff right this is the\nreal hard biological stuff that we're\nnot talking about enough i know you\nmake a huge effort on your content that\nyou put out to talk about this stuff\nbut it is so so important and i go back\nto this 37 year old patient of mine\ni could have diagnosed him i could have\nmedicated him yeah why i've just been\nasked yeah and\nfor me that may be appropriate in some\ncases right\nbut i'm always trying to get to the root\ncause of the problem and he\nhad a friendship deficiency yeah that's\namazing by the way i love that because\ni think it's so refreshing to hear you\nprescribing something lifestyle based\nyeah rather than something medical and\nlike you said sometimes it is that and\nthat's fine\nwhat i'm fascinated by and i think you\nexplain that incredibly well\nand i've heard that many times before\nbut i think you did a great job of\nactually making it really clear for\neveryone listening what does someone do\nwhen they start sensing that\nbecause that anxiety that you just said\nis so widespread right now\nright it's looking at your notifications\nit's feeling lonely\nit's comparing on instagram like you're\nlost and you're feeling that anxiety and\nit's almost like\nyou just talk about it's like oh it's\njealousy or it's envy or i'm just\ndealing with comparison or whatever but\nactually it's this\nanxiety and there are biological changes\nin the body yeah\nwhat does someone do on a daily basis\nwhen they're\nit's like literally what you just\ndescribed is we're\ndealing with our level anxiety as if a\nwild predator is attacking us every\nsingle day\nif not multiple times a day yeah so that\nsounds scary\nbecause you're reacting to that level\nwhat do we do to bring that down and to\nbring it into reality so i think there's\ntwo ways to look at that one\nis when it's happening what can you do\nyes and then there's also well what can\nyou do to sort of reduce the likelihood\nthat happening in the first place i like\nthe preparing part let's do both let's\nsee\nokay so the preparing part okay so i\nthink a useful way\nthat i like to describe this to people\nbecause you know yes i've written a book\non stress but stress is a very\nwoolly term right and it means different\nthings to different people so\nwhen i was writing i was trying to\nfigure out how can i\nyou know how can i accurately\ncommunicate it in a way that people\nunderstand\nso i have this concept of micro stress\ndoses and macro stress doses\na macro stress dose is you know\nsomething really really significant you\nknow like a\na relationship break up a bereavement\nmaybe some trauma something like that\nyou know that is\num a significant dose of stress that\nprobably needs some form of therapy or\nsomething\nyou know you know you have to deal with\nthat and process that in other ways\ni contrast that to micro stress doses or\nmsds now we are all getting hit by\nthese msds every single day and i define\none of these\nmsds or a microstressos as this it is a\nsmall hit of stress that in\nisolation we can manage it's no problem\nbut when they start to accumulate one\nafter the other after the other after\nthe other they start to get us closer to\nwhat i call\nour own personal stress threshold when\nyou get to your threshold\nthat's when the problems happen that's\nwhen that innocent email from your boss\nbecomes\na problem that's when that sort of um\nyou know that's when you have a row with\nyour partner\nthat's when you scream at your kids\nthat's when actually\nyou overreact to something or you're in\nthe car and someone cuts you up and you\nstart to lose it\nright because you're at your threshold\nbecause stress is fundamentally normal\nso i make the case that you wake up\nand many people will leave the house in\nthe morning\nbefore before they get out the house\nthey've been hit by\n15 microstress doses doses i give an\nexample which i think people might\nresonate with so\na very typical example today is this\npeople are a bit stressed out like at\ntheir work or in their life\nand so they don't want to go to bed\nright they just like they want to unwind\nso they stay up late watching netflix\nokay there is no judgment here okay i'm\njust simply explaining\nso you're up late saying watching\nnetflix and you get to midnight and you\nthink\noh man i've got work tomorrow i better\nget to bed okay so you go to bed you put\nthe alarm on for 6 30 on your phone\nso at 6 30 in the morning boom the\nalarm's gone off\nyou're in a deep sleep that is micro\nstress house number one\nyou look at the alarm clock and you\nthink ah i've got a bit more time okay\nyou put it on snooze\nsix minutes later it comes on again my\nquestion says number two\nthen you think i better have get out man\nso you quickly check your email and go\noh man there's three work emails from\nyesterday i didn't do them\nmsd number three then you quickly go\ninto social media so just have a quick\nlook\noh man someone's had a go at me on my\nlast post msd number four\nthen you realize oh my god i've been in\nbed for half an hour doing this stuff i\nreally need to get out of bed now and\nmsd number five and you can easily see\nhow before you leave the house\nyou have been hit by 15 msds and that\nmeans\nyou are closer to your own stress\nthreshold which means it won't take\nmuch in the day to tip you over now how\ncan you change that well\ni've saw your video recently on morning\nroutines and your morning routine is\nphenomenal\num i think morning routines are a\ncritical way to make you more resilient\neven if i can't change the amount of\nstress in your life\nthis will buffer you and make you more\nresilient so you can deal with them\nso i think a morning routine is critical\nfor people when they wake up\nand if people think they don't have time\ni can tell you i've got busy patients\nsometimes even a five minute morning\nroutine will work of course if you've\ngot an hour or i think you have a two\nhour one j which is\nwhich looked incredible but i want to\nmake this accessible that someone thinks\nyou know i've got i've got moms who have\nto take kids to school who are rushing\naround\nand i give them a framework on how to do\na morning routine so my framework is\nthis i say look\na morning routine can be anything\ndifferent things to different people but\ni think\na useful way to look at it is to think\nabout the three m's\nfirst term is mindfulness the second m\nis movement\nand the third m is mindset and it's just\na simple framework so\nfor me for example at the moment i will\nwake up\ni used to use my phone to go on the calm\nmeditation app\ni'm actually not doing the meditation\ni'm doing some deep breathing uh so\nwe're sort of breathing form of\nmeditation so i actually don't need my\nphone\nat the moment but if you need a\nmeditation up that's cool i just say you\nknow put your phone on airplane mode so\nyou're not seeing everything that's\ncoming in\nbut i'll do 10 minutes of deep breathing\nthen i'll do like 5-10 minutes of\nmovement let's say some hip stretches or\nsomething and then i'll do\nmindset and mindset can either be\nreading something positive so i'll have\nfour\ni'll have a few books there that i'm\nenjoying reading and things that make me\nfeel good\nand i'll read a few pages or i'll do\nsomething called affirmations now look\ni've got young kids so i try and get up\nbefore my kids so that i can do my\nroutine but my daughter has a\nsixth sense of when like daddy's up and\noften she'll creep down\nand often she'll be there when i'm doing\nmy movement so she'll just join me and\nthen if she's with me\nbecause i i also want to do the mindset\npiece we do affirmations together so\nyeah we'll sit together hold hands after\ntwo minutes we'll say\ni'm happy i'm calm i'm stress-free i'm\nhappy i'm calm i'm stressed we'll say\nthat for two minutes at the end of those\ntwo minutes\nshe's got a big smile on her face i feel\nincredible and what's more important is\nthat feeling lasts\nand buffers me for the entire day those\ndays when i think oh\nyou don't have time today you've got to\nget going i start to react to things i'm\nnot as focused i'm not as present\nto really break it down for someone\nlistening to this who thinks\ni get it but i don't have time i've got\none patient\nin particular who does five minutes and\nshe uses my three m's\nthe first piece for one minute she does\ndeep breathing she does a breath that i\ntaught called the three four five breath\nwhen you breathe in for three\nyou hold for four and you breathe out\nfor five she does that for one minute\nthen she does two minutes of movements\ncoming back to what you said before she\nhad been to like one yoga class in her\nlife\nbut she learned a couple of moves that\nshe likes so she does her favorite moves\nfor two minutes\nright this is what we talked about the\nimmersive experience to learn it right\nso one minute of deep breathing two\nminutes of yoga\nand then she does two minutes of reading\nshe's got a list of books there you know\na pile of books\nand she picks one after two minutes she\nreads she has told me this has\ntransformed her life\nshe doesn't scream at her kids as much\nshe's much more present\nin the day and for her her\neczema has got significantly better wow\nthis is why i'm so passionate about this\nstuff\nright x-men is a skin condition but\nfundamentally it is a\nit is a slight dysfunction of one part\nof the immune system\nwhen you're stressed it impacts the\nimmune system right so for her\ndoing this morning routine has\nsignificantly improved a skin condition\nyeah and this is you know this one i'm\nso passionate about this you know\nthis this sounds like small things you\ngive it a big priority as you say\nyeah and it really leads to a lot of\nimprovements yeah i love that and that's\nso stretchable because you can do it in\nfive minutes you can do it 10 you could\ngive yourself 15\nand you could grow it but it could be as\nsimple and i love the three things\ntogether\ncan i ask you jay actually i'm super\nintrigued because in your two-hour\nmorning routine\nyeah i do all three of those things i\nwas going to say yeah because\nso what what do you do yeah so i i wake\nup and\nmy biggest practice is my meditation\npractice which includes everything from\nbreath work\nto visualization through to mantra and\naffirmations so my my meditation a whole\nlot\nyeah i do all three types of meditations\nbreathing visualization and\nmantra affirmation and so i do all three\nof those and then i go to the gym\nso i do about a gym for about 45 minutes\nevery day every four days a week\nso for me it's like that's my morning\nroutine and mindset is a huge part of it\nand i try and find\nmy mindset isn't necessarily in the\nmorning because my days are so flexible\nbut i would get at least 30 minutes of\nreading in a day\naround something i love and and this\nisn't just this isn't just something i\nstarted doing\nnow like and this is the point i keep\nreminding to everyone and yes i don't\nhave kids so\ni've always put that out there and said\nlook i don't have kids i'm not gonna sit\nhere and say it's gonna be the same when\ni have kids\nso i'm just putting it out there but the\nother thing i've said is that when i've\nbeen working when i've been working at a\ncompany i didn't just do this when i\nbecame an entrepreneur i've\ni've done this for years and i've\navoided\nwatching two extra episodes in the\nevening so that i can get that time back\nin the morning\nand i think that's the difference i\nsleep much earlier so when i wake up\nearly and get two hours at the start of\nthe day\nthat's because i want to sleep at 9 30\np.m my man i mean i\ni've really i tell you what's changed\nfor me when i had kids is it shifting my\nbedtime earlier because\ni've realized for me and this actually\nthis point's super important for people\nyou got to figure out what works for you\nyes right for me\ni'm a much better person i'm a better\nfather i'm a much better dad\ni'm a better husband when i have time\nfor myself in the morning yes if i get\nup at the same time as everyone else and\ni'm sort of reacting\nme too it doesn't work so well for me\nsame so i've shifted my bedtime earlier\nso that i can get up earlier before them\nyeah and you know if you do have kids\nwhen i i you know i've shared that my\ndaughter sometimes comes down\nyou know what i kind of also feel that\nhey i'm helping her to see\ndaddy prioritizes his self-care daddy is\ni hope i'm showing her well you're doing\nit with her that's amazing this stuff is\nimportant so it doesn't have to be\nbecause ultimately i could get\nfrustrated and if i'm honest i used to\nget frustrated and if she was around\nthen yeah i'd be like oh man i really\nwanted this time to myself\nand that sort of tension is stressing me\nout which is counter-productive and now\ni've learned\nhey look i'm doing a lot of personal\ngrowth anyway but i've learnt to kind of\naccept things and actually\nreally accept what's going on and being\nlike okay my daughter said cool so\nwhat's the message i can learn\ncool get her involved yeah and um it's\nreally fun\nand i hope this leads to her putting\nthese practices in of her\nown volition when she's older you know\ni'll tell you in a few years\nif she does it no i'm sure she will and\ni love that and and let's talk about\nthat sleep piece because i think for so\nmany of us when you've had a long day at\nwork\nyou had a stressful day at work you come\nhome you've put the kids to bed\nand you just think i need to decompress\ni'm going to put the tv on\nand it may be 10 p.m by then or whatever\nit is and you get lost like you said\ntill midnight or 1am whatever it is and\nthen you wake up\nwhat is there any decompression in\nwatching a show\nor actually would in my opinion the\nsleep and the decompression through\nsleep\nis so much more powerful than the\nentertainment value you think you feel\nbetter\nby watching two episodes of your\nfavorite show yeah i agree look i think\ni think we're looking at symptoms here\nthat's\nthe symptom of being so stressed all the\ntime\nis that we need to find ways of\nrelieving that stress whether that's\nsugar whether it's alcohol whether it's\nbinge watching netflix\nwe're trying to hide a numb like\nsomething\nelse that's going on in our life and\nthat's okay if you're conscious of it\nbut\nsleep you know i hate prioritizing those\nfour pillars of health\nbecause it's against what i stand for\nbut if you push me\ni might argue that sleep might be the\nmost important because when you sleep\nwell\nit's easier to do all those other things\nit's easy not to be reactive it's easier\nto eat well it's easier to be more\nyou know all these things are easy when\nyou sleep well the biggest problem in\nsociety regarding sleep is simply this\nwe're not prioritizing it right we think\nit's optional\nwe do other things and when we when\nwe're done when we've exhausted all\nother possibilities\noh i better get some sleep in but once\nyou stop prioritizing sleep and making\nthat the foundation of your day and\nthinking oh well i need to get up at\nthis time therefore what time do i need\nto go to sleep\nyou will find very quickly your life\nchanges now\none thing i'd love to share is that i've\nbeen seeing patients for almost 20 years\nnow\nand in almost every case a sleep\nissue is usually a lifestyle issue\nthere are very very few cases relatively\nthat are what we call a primary sleep\ndisorder which needs a treatment\nmost things we are doing something in\nour lifestyle that we do not realize\nis impacting our ability to sleep at\nnight caffeine is a big one we all know\ncaffeine can be problematic\nfor sleep people don't realize that if\nyou if you go to starbucks at midday\nand buy a large latte at 6 00 p.m\nhalf of that starbucks latte is going\naround your blood in your brain\nat midnight a quarter is going around\nyour brain right so\ni say to people enjoy your caffeine if\nyou want it enjoy it before noon if you\ncan\nif someone thinks caffeine does not\naffect them and they're struggling with\ntheir sleep i\nchallenge them for seven days to just\nhave it in the morning\nand just see what happens if it doesn't\nmake a difference fine but if it does\nnow you're empowered with information\nand you can choose what you want to do\nwith that my job is not to tell somebody\nwhat to do\ni feel my job is to empower them so they\nstart to experience it for themselves so\nthey then\ncan be in charge they can be sovereign\nand decide oh i'm going to do this\nyeah so that's a big one what you do\nbefore bed\nis super important right and you know\nyou've got to wind down\nfor any of your listeners who do have\nkids they will recognize\nthat you need to give your kids a little\nroutine what do you do before bed with\nyour kids\nyou don't give them a load of sugar to\namp them up you don't put on the tv\nreally loud and actually get them really\nemotionally charged you don't put the\nlights really bright\nyou you lower your tone you soften the\nlights\nyou know you might put some music and\nyou might read them a story\nwe as adults think somehow we're\ndifferent from kids but we are not\nright if you i have a rule like one hour\nbefore beds\ni try 90 minutes but really it's\nnormally one hour before bed\ni make a mental switch in my head and i\ngo off from\nmy day time to my nighttime i am now in\npreparation\nfor sleep i'm switching off my laptop\ngoes off\num mostly i'm not perfect sometimes sure\ni do it right and it always affects my\nsleep\nyeah but i do you know i'll listen to\nmusic i'll read\nin bed like my wife and i have a little\nrule that we try and sort of\nhelp motivate each other to do which is\nto charge our phones in our kitchen\nif i bring my phone in my into my\nbedroom i cannot resist looking at it of\ncourse\ni just can't resist yeah no one can so i\nyou know i live in a house so downstairs\nis where my phone\ncharges and then when i you know when i\njust switch off and reads\ni actually fall into a really deep\nslumber now i just want to share a\nlittle very quick story for people who\nthink that technology does not affect\ntheir sleep quality one of my buddies\nactually who lives out here in\ncalifornia\nand i actually met him a couple of days\nago but a couple of years ago\nhe said to me wrong look i get all this\nstuff about technology and blue light\nbefore beds\ni feel sorry for those people who affect\ni'm totally cool with it\ni said okay cool anyway then he bought\nlike a an aura ring like one of these\nyou know these fancy tracking wings i'm\nnot saying everyone has to buy that you\nknow\nbut he bought an aura ring i think they\nare very good and he phoned me up about\na year ago he's like\nwrong oh my god i've just had a look\nevery time i do work\nemails i'll go on a social media just\nbefore i go to bed the amount of deep\nsleep i get\nhas almost vanished wow right so he\nneeded\nironically he needed technology tracking\ntechnology\nto tell him and that changed his\nbehavior so you may fall asleep\nbut it's not just the quantity of sleep\nit's the quality of sleep\nyeah try for a seven days again i\nchallenge people to try\nsee if you can phone your phone switch\nyour phone off for one hour before beds\nand see what happens i bet i almost\nguarantee that you will feel different\nin the morning\nyou will feel calmer and also there's\nthis phase just before sleep i've been\nlearning about from\nreading some neuroscience is that the\nphase in your brain i think it's called\nthe hypophagic states of consciousness\ndon't\nquote me on that if that's incorrect but\ni'm\nthat that what you do just before bed is\ncritical your brain\nprocesses it when you sleep so if you've\ngotten\nin in a battle over donald trump online\nright or\ninto a row with your friend on facebook\njust before you go to bed\nguess what your brains can be thinking\nabout tonight right then\nyou gotta protect that if you feel that\nyou are the most important person in\nyour life and i hope people\nwho follow your work are starting to get\nto that point where actually they put\nthemselves first\nthe best thing you can do is prioritize\nyour sleep yeah and that starts one hour\nbefore it\ntake ownership of that time you do that\nfor a few days you will feel the\ndifference you will feel bulletproof in\nthe rest of your life\nyeah this is great advice by the way i\nthink this is awesome i'm so glad we're\ngoing deep on some of these things\nbecause\nuh and it's it's nice to hear you say a\nlot of the stuff that i so deeply\nbelieve yeah\nuh and explain it so incredibly well one\nof the things i love about what you're\nsaying is you bring in lifestyle you\ntalk about loneliness and friendship\nyou also talk a lot about purpose and\nit's for sure feeling around lowering\nstress and the role that purpose plays\nand often\npurpose isn't really used in a health\ncontext but you really bring it in\nand and i love that i mean the podcast\nis called on purpose but\nabsolutely but i i feel so much that\npurpose is so closely linked to health\nand tell us yeah tell us from your\nperspective and your findings yeah you\nknow this is\njay started the book with purpose as the\nfirst quarter of the book because i\nthought fundamentally\na life which has no meaning and purpose\nis inherently a stressful life\nright yes you can do all the other\nthings but ultimately if you don't have\nthat reason to get up\nand you don't have that direction in\nyour life i think things can be very\nvery challenging\nnow the science back side up you know\npeople with a um\nand i'm sure you're probably going to\ncover this in your book i would imagine\nbut people who don't have a strong sense\nof purpose\nhave poorer health outcomes they have\nlower levels of income\nthey have low levels of happiness all\nthese things come\nfrom something that we we might often\nhave thought is a little bit soft right\nthis is the stuff and this is why you\nknow i love i'm super proud of my first\nbook but my second book i think really\ntackles\nthe issues in health that we're not\ntalking about enough\nyou know what i mean and that's why i\nthink meaning and purpose is so\nimportant now\nwhy is purpose so important we've sort\nof explained that but\ni remember a few years ago on facebook i\nsaw one of my friends post this\nthis idea of icky guy which i'm sure\nyou're familiar with this japanese idea\nvicky guy and then these four\ncircles and they said icky guys where\nthese things meet in the middle\nand there's four circles for where try\nand find something you do in your life\nthat you love that you're good at that\nthe world needs\nand that pays you money and i remember\nlooking at that and it was just a couple\nyears after my dad had died so i was\ngoing through a huge sort of\num i cared for my dad for like 15 years\nwith my mom and my brother and\ndad dying was one of the biggest shifts\nfor me and i that's really set me on\nthis path to kind of personal growth and\ntrying to figure out who i am and what\ni'm doing\nand i looked at that and i thought icky\nguy yeah i want ichika in my life i\nfancy a bit of icky guy\nand i would talk to it about i would\ntalk about this concept with my patients\nand a lot of my patients would say yeah\ni like that but it's just too\nintimidating i don't know where to start\nyeah and when i was doing the uk book\ntour for the book in january i was in\nlondon\ni was taking a q a at the end and this\njapanese student put a hand up\nand she said dr i just want to share\nthat i've grown up with this concept\noh wow and i have found it so\num i've actually found it really hard i\nfound it an\nimpossible bar to live up to and i found\nthat so interesting because i love the\nconcept\nbut then i'm always thinking about well\nwhat if my patients or what if my\nfriends are finding it too difficult\nso i simplified it i tried to create a\nnew well i did create a new framework\nthat i called the live framework in my\nbook to help people\nultimately get more meaning and purpose\nin their life now i love ikigai right\ni'm just\ni'm not criticizing it i just did it if\nyou're like when i worked in oldham\nlike for seven years which is you know\nthe practice i worked in was a lot of\npoor patients\nuh a lot of them were on benefits they\ndidn't really have the thought of\nactually finding one thing that\nticked all those boxes was just like pie\nin the sky right\nso the live framework i really enjoy we\ndon't necessarily go through it all\nnecessarily but\nit's l i v e l for love i for intention\nv for vision and e for engagement now\nif we just take the first one because i\nthink this is really practical take home\nfor people\nthe first one is love the research shows\nus super clearly\nregularly doing things that you love\nmakes you more resilient to stress\nbut conversely being stressed day in day\nout\nmakes it harder for you to experience\npleasure in day-to-day things it kind of\nworks both ways\nand so i always talk to my patients\nabout passion what are you doing in your\nlife that you really love\nagain i mean another patient example\nwhich i think brings it to life\n51 your chat maybe i don't know if\nthat's i don't know how old your your\nlisteners are right i don't know that's\na bit old or not but i think there's a\nthere's a very\nthere's a very powerful story here 51\nyear old chap comes in to see me\nhe's the cfo of the local plastics\ncompany\nyou know good job good money he's\nmarried he's got kids he lives in a\npretty big house\nhe comes in to see me again worried\nabout depression he said dog you know\ni struggle to get out of bed sometimes\ni'm indifferent about things you know i\njust lost that get up and go\ni feel quite down sometimes i said okay\nokay fine you know\ni try to tease out what's going on i\nsaid how's your relationship with your\nwife\nyeah it's so served you know we don't\nsee each other that much it's fine\nvery very indifferent i said um how's\nyour job\na job you know just pays the bills you\nknow i don't really enjoy it but\ni need it pays the mortgage helps put\nfood on the table\ni said okay you know have you have you\ngot any hobbies\ndoc i don't have time for hobbies i'm a\nbusy guy i don't have time you know i\nsaid what about the weekends weekends\ni've got to do the housework\ngot to do all the chores take the kids\naround to their sports clubs\ni said okay did you ever have any\nhobbies\nyeah well you know as a as a kid as a\nteenager i used to love playing with\ntoy train sets i said okay do you have a\ntrain set\nright and he's like yeah i think so i've\ngot one in the attic\nbut it's really dusty i haven't seen it\nin years i said okay what i'd love you\nto do tonight when you get home\nis get your train set out now look i\nappreciate this may not be the advice he\nwas expecting from his doctor you know\ni love it um but this is the advice i\ngave him then i didn't see him for a\nlittle while which is not uncommon we\nhave so many patients we can't follow\nthem all up\nthree months later i was in my clinic\ncar park about to do some home visits\nand i bumped into his wife and i said\nhey how's your husband doing\nshe said dr chelsea i feel like i've got\nthe guy i'm married back again\nhe comes home from work he's posturing\naround on his train set\nhe's on ebay trying to buy collectors\ntrains and he subscribes to this like\nmonthly magazine now he's just like a\ndifferent person\nyeah i still hadn't seen him three\nmonths later\ni see him he'd done some blood tests he\ncame in for a check with me and before\nwe went into that i said hey\nhow are you getting on it's like doc i\nfeel like a different person i feel\nhappy i feel\nenergized i absolutely love it thank you\nso much i said\nyou know how's your how's your\nrelationship with you why it's like\nwe've never been closer things are super\nsuper good so what about your job\ni really really enjoy my job now so what\ndoes that tell you you know you ask the\nquestion again\ndid this chap have a mental health\nproblem sure\nhe had symptoms i could have diagnosed\nhim with something\nor was what he really had a deficiency\nof passion in his life when he corrects\nhis passion deficiency\neverything else comes back online yeah\nhe feels better with himself\nnow he's enjoying his job now he's\ncloser with his wife\nnow he's got more energy and it started\nwith him playing with his train set\nso for people listening to that i would\nlove them\nand actually to make it super easy\ni challenge all of my patients to say\nlook\ncan you give yourself a daily dose of\npleasure\neven if it's just for five minutes right\nfive minutes\nit could be a walk it could be listening\nto a podcast reading a book\nit could be watching one of your like\nvideos one of your feel-good videos like\ngoing to your account and watch one of\nthem to make you feel good\ndoesn't matter whatever you enjoy doing\ngive yourself i want to give a daily\ndose of pleasure\npete i want people to give that the same\npriority as they might give the amount\nof vegetables they have on their plates\nyeah\nwhen we talk about health we're not\ntalking about pleasure we're not talking\nabout passion\nit is so important and you know again\nanother question i'd ask people is\nthink about in your own life when did\nyou last do something\nthat you love that you did for you not\nso you could post about it on social\nmedia\nright and again i'm not criticizing if\nyou want to do that but understand the\nthings that you do\nbecause you want external validation and\nunderstand the things that you do\nbecause it makes you feel good if you've\nnot done it for a while\nlook at your schedule make a phone call\nput something in your diary so at least\nit's there\nyeah i love what you've done there\nbecause i think you've just\nand i talk about this a lot it's taking\npurpose off a pedestal yeah because i\nthink that when purpose is like this\nbig elusive intangible thing i was\nspeaking at a\ncorporate hr conference this week at\nmicrosoft in seattle\nand i was talking about the need to give\npeople inside companies micro purposes\ni was like stop trying to get everyone\nto find this like one purpose that\noverarches their life and give them\nsomething just get excited about even if\nit's for three months\nyeah so what can you get excited about\nright now like you can get excited about\ntrain set right now yeah\nyou don't need to figure out like\nwhether you're gonna build a train track\nor anything for real\nand and i love that because i think it's\nso grounded in reality\nand so often it's stuff that we left in\nour\nyouth i mean one of the reasons why i\nstarted making videos again is because i\nasked myself that question i was like\nwhat would my younger self be sad that i\nstopped doing\nand my answer to that was writing and my\nanswer to that was being creative and my\nanswer to that was\nyou know expressing myself through the\nwritten word and spoken word\nand that's kind of why i went back to it\nand and that's where i get the most buzz\ni get the most buzz from\nputting together words that can help\npeople and you know being creative\nbut it's like a ripple effect yes why i\nstart small\nis if someone starts to reconnect with\ntheir passion\nyou know what that will start you that\nwill lead you to connect with yourself\nand more\nand you may make different decisions\ninto yours you may not know what your\nmeaning and purpose is now yes\nstart with passion and it will start to\nbecome clear yeah i'm with you\ni'm with you absolutely it's and it's as\nsimple as that like it is it's as simple\nas that it's just start with what you\nlike doing right now even if you don't\nlove it yeah\nstart with what you just like doing and\nwhat you like getting involved with and\nsame with the people around you i think\nwe're not\nwe're not decisive enough with our lives\nand our time about like you know so many\npeople say to me like\ni spent 75 of my time with people i\ndon't like i'm just like shift that you\ndon't need to you don't have to like\nthere's no need to do that so\nthank you for getting us started on i'm\nso glad we dove into purpose hey not at\nall because i think it's\nit's such a powerful way and what was\ntell me about intention\nintentionally i want to know yeah\nbecause i like what i mean by intention\nis again my if someone is already out\nthere living there\ntheir purpose this may not be relevant\nright yeah i'm trying to bring it down\nto people who who\nwho put it on a pedestal and think i\ncan't do that i think for most people\nit's on a pedestal\nfor sure exactly and so intention is\nabout\ndoing something each day with complete\nmindful intent\nit doesn't need to be a whole day of\ncourse i'd love it to be your whole day\ni don't live my whole day with\nreal mindful intents i i hope at one\npoint i'm able to yeah but i can't\nso i say choose one thing let's say you\nlove\ni don't know coffee right or tea\nwhatever\nyou know i mean i'm in la now so i feel\nless about talking about tea i feel more\nlike talking about coffee which is what\neveryone does\nin the us um but\nwhen you're drinking it when you're\nmaking it right\nmake it with real intent and purpose\nmaybe for five minutes in the morning\nfocus on your coffee ritual like\ni used to have a real coffee problem\nthat was a crutch for me and what i used\nto do\nis i would it would be a real\nritualistic part of my day i'd get up\ni'd put the kettle on\nand i'd weigh out the beans on a scale\nno i didn't have social media i didn't\nhave music on it was all quiet\ni'd literally watch the water pour on it\nand it starts to froth\ni put the on the on the cafeteria i put\nit on top\ni just sit there for four minutes just\nwatching it smelling it\ntaking in the aroma and then mindfully\ndrinking it\nright the japanese have tea rituals it\ntakes like an hour to prepare a cup of\ntea right it's a real\nit's not about the tea it's about the\nprocess around it and what that\nsymbolizes\ni'm just trying to ask somebody to find\nsomething\nmaybe it's a cup of coffee maybe it's a\ncup of tea that they prepare\nand drink completely mindfully\nbecause i find when you do that it\nbleeds into the other aspects of your\nlife\nit's not about that five minute session\nnecessarily it's what it does it's been\nlike\nmeditation isn't it like meditation\noften you don't get all the benefit in\nthe moment\nyou notice it later like you notice when\ni switch to white watkins once on my\npodcast who's a\nmeditation teacher and he goes the\nmistake a lot of people make is they try\nand assess that\num the result of the meditation\nimmediately when they finish yes\nyeah i'm sure you may feel calm but\noften it's in the\nother 23 and a half hours in your day\n100 where you get the benefit and so\nthe intention piece is simply choose\nsomething right\nand i think coffee and tea are quite\ngood examples of people\nyeah these are things that we all do\nyeah and just do it mindfully with\npresents\nyeah that is a full meditation you know\nand and\nit's to try and take even meditation off\nits lofty pedestal\nand bring it right down and i guarantee\nyou do that\nseven days in a row only for a few\nminutes you will notice yourself being\nmore mindful and present\nat other times yeah absolutely no i'm\ntotally with you on that and i i talk\nabout that a lot\nin my work right now as well of just\nlike\nyou've just got to do what you're doing\nanyway whether it's showering\nbrushing your teeth coffee cooking like\nyou do any of those acts mindfully you\ndon't even need to find that\nand what i loved about what you said is\nthat what we try to do is we go i don't\nwant to focus during this activity\nand i want to focus during this one and\ni think that's a mistake\nbecause when you focus on something as\nsimple as making your tea or your coffee\nlike you said it bleeds into it and now\nyou're focused in everything whereas if\nyou go oh while i make coffee i'm just\ngoing to do it quickly yeah but then\nwhen i get to that meeting i'm going to\nbe really focused\nit doesn't work got it wrong we flipped\nit yeah yeah exactly pay attention to\nthe small things\nand the big things will start to take\ncare of themselves totally yeah\nabsolutely and we try and do it the hard\nway around i'm going to focus for an\nhour\nbut i can't focus for a minute yeah it's\nlike we're going to go to the gym and\nwork out for now it's like well\nmaybe just start five minutes a day yeah\nright and so\ni you know jay the overall issue the\npoint for me is you know\nwith all these patients these tens of\nthousands of people i have seen\n80 of what we're now seeing right 80\nis in some way driven by a collective\nmodern lifestyles\nit's that simple and that's not being\njudgmental i'm not putting blame on\npeople i get it\nlife can be very tough it can be very\nstressful very busy\nbut if you focus on those small things\nand do pick pick one thing you heard\nabout in this podcast\nnot all of them pick one thing that\nresonated with you yeah if you heard\nsomething that didn't resonate with you\nfine leave it\npick the one thing that did like i would\nsay the five minutes and passion i mean\ndo you you know you don't need a\nprescription to do something we love\nright yes\nstart there and see what happens in the\nrest of your life yeah\ni love that that's amazing wrong and\nranga we end every episode with the\nfinal five\nwhich is our final five rapid fire quick\nfire round so it's like one word to one\nsentence answers try to keep myself\nyeah i say that and i'm like yeah i feel\nthe stress you feel the stress do your\nthree four five\ni'm doing my three three four five so\nthese are your final\nfive uh number number one question are\nsome people truly more creative at night\nyes oh okay tell me more i'm intrigued\nlike if some people are like i need to\nstay up at night to be more creative to\nyou know\nwhat do you mean like that yeah i would\nsay no oh\nbecause i think we kid ourselves that\nwe're not ours so many of us\ndo kid ourselves and we use light to\nkeep us up and then we get that second\nwinds\nbut you can easily change your rhythm so\ni'm going to say no okay\ngood i'm glad thank you for that i\nappreciate it um\nlet's see this i'm picking some good\nones for you\nparts of the breathing\nwhat's something you're trying to learn\nright now i'm trying to learn\nhow to use social media as a way as a\nmirror\nto help me know when i've got an issue\nto process so if i see\nsomething on social media that i get a\nrise from instead of getting annoyed\ni'm now using it to look at hey why is\nthat bottle\ni love that i love that what a great\nanswer amazing that's a brilliant answer\nquestion number three what was one of\nyour habits that was the hardest to\nbreak for you\ncoffee okay i was drinking way too much\ncaffeine there's nothing wrong with\ncaffeine necessarily but i was using it\nas a crutch and when i identified why i\nwas using it\nnow i managed to pretty much cut it out\nokay question number four you're very\ngood at this by the way question number\nfour if you weren't a doctor what would\nyou be doing\nmusician oh really what do you
