    "transcript": "we're living in like you know an\nepidemic of loneliness and it's just\naccelerating\nwhere there's we are so connected but\nthe possibility of loneliness is even\nmore and loneliness is\nthere's pain and you can't measure it\nand i just think\nthis thing of looking at somebody\nis the beginning of getting out of pain\nyeah\nhey everyone welcome to on purpose the\nnumber

taking\nout time to choose\neducation the fact that you're choosing\nto learn choosing to develop yourselves\nthis is the right place to be and\ntoday's guest is someone that i've been\nfascinated for so many years\nwe've had the fortune of having\nincredible curious conversations\ntogether and today\nwe actually get to video it and record\nit on audio so that you can witness it\ntoo\nhe's truly got one of the most\nfascinating minds i've ever met\nthe first meeting i had with him was\nnothing short of brilliant\nand i just want to tell you a bit about\nhim now listen very very carefully brian\ngrazer is an academy award-winning\nproducer\nnew york times a best-selling author of\na curious mind\nwho's been making movies and television\nprograms for more than 25\nyears his credits include and this is\njust the tiniest list in the world\na beautiful mind 24 arrested development\nempire eight mile\nfriday night lights amongst so many\nothers his films and tv series have been\nnominated wait for this\n43 academy awards and 195\nemmys and brian's new book face to face\nis what we're talking about today\nit's the art of human connection\nsomething i know is so\nimportant to every one of you so please\nwelcome to the show\nbrian grazer brian thank you for being\nhere thank you\ni'm so grateful to have you here thank\nyou of course this is such a pleasure\nand honor to\nbe sitting with you hmm i'm psyched yeah\ni was really excited\nwe both just got back from our vacations\nonly last night i was\nback from provence and got up early and\nyou were back from am i allowed to say\nbora bora yes yes yeah\nokay absolutely i was on a three year\nlate honeymoon\nyou're very busy then oh absolutely\nabsolutely but i want to kick this off\nby asking a curious question of my own\nand i know curious conversations are\nyour fascination\nyes but you're actually a painter like\nthat's something that you dabble in tell\nus about how you got involved in that\num i got involved in painting through my\ndaughter\nmy daughter was only her name is sage\nshe was\nthree four years old at three i was\nplaying invisible barbies with her\nwhere you're playing with the barbie and\nthen she takes the barbie away and she\ngoes\nwell the barbie's now got red hair and i\ngo i can't see the barbie and she's well\nit's invisible\nso i thought i have to transition her to\nsomething that i\nmaybe we could do together you know\nbecause that was i was looking at my\nwatch\nso i think it now five years old we\ndecided we'd paint together\nuh which is something i've never done i\ndon't i've never\nplayed with ceramics or painted or\nanything before and\nso i had room to have an art studio and\nwe became painters together\nand she soon ceased to paint\nand i just continued to paint and still\ndo\nto this day paint and i use um primarily\nacrylic then oil and then oil stick\nand often pencil to highlight or\npunctuate\nfaces faces or usually faces\nuh nuance amaze pressure so paintings\nwhat brought your human connection\ntogether\nyes painting is what brought our human\nconnection together and we became\nlike completely embedded with one\nanother on this painting\nand tell me tell me about that what is\nwhen you say the art of human connection\nwhat is human connection\nto brian grazer like what does that mean\nto you um it means\nwell first okay first there's the the\nset point of human connection which\nbegins with eye contact\nand um and and there's a whole story\nabout eye contact and\nwhy i became i had a heightened\nawareness to it\num but um basically\nhuman connection begins with looking at\nactually\nlooking at somebody but looking at\nsomebody\ncalmly and\nwithout ambition just looking at them\ncalmly and feeling them it doesn't mean\nyou have to pause it doesn't\nyou have to know any weird thing but you\njust have to really\nlook at them and and be relaxed\nand be interested and that makes\nsomebody feel like\nit validates them as a human being it\nmakes them feel human\nand conversely you will feel human so\nit just begins with that generous act\nnow\nonce you've established that you're at\nleast\non the very very beginning of the\npathway to getting to know somebody\nto getting to ask questions\nfor them to feel like i can answer those\nquestions\nand once you're on the pathway then you\ncan\nreally just let biology take over\nyou know and and you\nfind things that are very interesting\nabout them\nthey with you but what i'm personally\ninterested\nin doing is getting to the place where\nwe both\nare you know on a one-on-one we're both\nreaching into our most authentic self\nyeah where whatever that truth is that\nlies deep\nembedded in you whatever that is to have\nsome of that revealed\nand i do this now\nal always without any thought about it\nand\nand there is pluses and minuses to this\nand i always tell people it's like you\nwhen you're reaching inside of yourself\nand you're really accessing that\nyou do say things that are stupid and\nyou make mistakes you're fallible you're\nand you're you have to say i'm willing\nto have that fallibility\nin myself happen but if somebody feels\nyour soul\nthey forgive that and they often really\nenjoy it and they\nit usually becomes the thing that is\npart of the connective tissue in this\nconnection that you're having that was\nbridged through just this initial set\npoint of looking at somebody\nwow that's unbelievable i don't think\ni'm ever going to look at someone the\nsame ever again after that definition\nthat's amazing the part that i've really\npicked up on\nlistening to you that really connected\nwith me was without ambition\noh i think that's such a beautiful point\ni've always felt one of the reasons why\nfrom my monk experience that i benefited\nso much is i felt i spent time with\npeople who had no agenda for me\nyes and like being around someone who\nhas no agenda for you doesn't want\nanything from you or isn't trying to\nmanipulate and this is\nwhat i find fascinating about when you\ntalk about it in this book\nand and for anyone who's going to read\nthe book afterwards this is what i find\nfascinating about the way you present it\nit's not a technique or a tactic for you\nno it's not like this\nmanipulative strategy for you no it's\nlike a very\ngenuine authentic what you just\nmentioned there that's what it sounds\nlike to me\nyeah how do you help people live it in\nthat way as opposed to like oh brian's\ntaught me i'm going to use this tactic\nto get\nuse it as a way of getting it how have\nyou come to that place of realizing that\nhuman connection is beyond tactics and\nstrategies and sales\nthat's such a great question it's a\ngreat question and i have a couple funny\nanswers\none is i've had people even recently\nyou know um you know given like my movie\nand television success they go\nwow what a great strategy yeah i go that\nwasn't a strategy it's just what\nhappened\ni have no strategy i mean i have desires\nand i have um there's intentionality\nuh within the movies and television and\njust my actions there's intentionality\num and and that's sort of the beauty of\nit\nof it all like that intentionality leads\nyou\nis is fired up by something and it leads\nyou someplace\nokay so let me go back to your original\nquestion so i found that very early in\nmy career i'd um\nit was just right before i ever produced\nanything so i\ni had to be just about turning 24\nbecause i turned\ni produced something at 24 but i was\ndying to meet this guy who ran movies\nand television for cbs\ni'll even say his name his name was\ndonald march\nand i wanted to meet donald march and he\nknew me\nand i called him once and it took him\nlike at least two weeks to call me back\nso i thought if i could get into this\nbig hollywood party\nthen donald march and people like donald\nmarch will call me right back\nso i found that first of all i was i did\nget in\ni found that i was incredibly\nuncomfortable being at this party\nand i felt that it was a plan it was a\nconstruction\nit was like very artificial to me\nso i did see donald march this is really\ntrue\nand i totally screwed it up\nand i i got to the i screwed it up like\nbecause i was nervous\ni was out of my honest real zone\nand he literally never called me back\never again\njust because i said stu you know it just\ndidn't feel right you know and\npeople can feel when things are not\nthat aren't that aren't real they can\nfeel constructions\nabsolutely particularly if you're paying\nattention yeah absolutely\nso i kind of vowed at that time that i\nwas never\ngoing to go to hal to any party\nas an ambition i would go if i thought i\ncould have a good time\ni thought if i could be naturalistic and\njust like this could be really fun\nor this could be a really interesting\nexperience or this could be a really\ninteresting adventure when it's just a\nre when it becomes a real thing that i'm\ndoing\nbut when it becomes like you know uh\nrecently someone said fly to saudi and\nhave this one meeting\nand i thought that's not me i ended up\ngoing to saudi incidentally\nand had this an unbelievably wild\nexperience but and\nwhich was incredibly valuable but i\ncouldn't go in surgical as a surgical\nambitious strike yeah yeah so\ni just don't think it works yeah no i i\nagree with you\nit's so funny i was just saying before\nthis podcast i was talking to my team\nand i was just saying\nfor me every podcast is a genuine\nconversation yeah i can't approach it\nwith like\ni gotta make sure like we have to ask\nthis to get this answer and like when\nyou start constructing it like that it's\nlike\nyou lose the conversation so yeah what\nto speak of\nbusiness and meetings and tv and movies\nit's like\nanything that's artificially constructed\nno i i absolutely love that and\noh go and i had this other flashpoint\nthought when you said it's a\nconversation that\nit made me think of this it was my\ninstinct about that party stuff\nwas further ratified when i had to give\na speech to all the firemen in america\nall the fire captains in america\nafternoon have after having produced\na movie about firemen called backdraft\nwith uh\nbilly baldwin and robert de niro and\nseveral others\nand um we were in washington dc\nand and we had to each say something\nyou know the director ron howard um\nand the chairman of the studio had to\nspeak\nand the chairman of the studio was\nreally\nvery high intellect you know very high\niq\nvery high intellect very articulate very\nvery\nand he came walked out on stage right\nbefore me\nand i thought wow what's this big brain\ngonna do\nand you know what he did he froze and\nhe basically said things that were like\na speech\nand got no reaction and i thought in\nthat flashpoint moment\ni don't have to be that i don't have to\ncompete with that kind of intellect\ni can just like speak from my heart and\nlike feelings about\nhow i feel about the selfless nature of\nfiremen themselves and\ni got a tremendous reaction without\nhaving to do that and it was really\nbeautiful incredibly beautiful actually\nyeah i love that and by the way i just\nwant to say when i was reading through\nthe book\nyour storytelling is unbelievable like\nwhat you do on screen\nand the fact that you can do it on the\nwritten page is unbelievable like i feel\nlike i got to know people through this\nbook and\nthat's what i was going to ask you with\nthe title face to face what are\nconversations\nthat in your experience do you believe\nmust happen face to face that today\nwe're not doing because of the\ndistractions of\ntechnology or the opportunities of email\nwhat are the conversations that you\nbelieve are non-negotiably\nhave to happen face to face\nbut that we're choosing to do different\nwell mine with you\noriginally yes absolutely i was\nimmediately magnetized to your\nincredibly powerful eyes um like and i\neven commented i remember\nlike i just couldn't believe the sparkle\nand clarity of your eyes\nand i didn't know that you were uh i\ndidn't fully appreciate that you were a\nmonk\nand that completely became compatible to\nme i thought wow no wonder\nhe had such kind forgiving eyes\nand it was really again very attracted\nto that\nand um so all of my real curiosity\nconversations\nwhich incidentally you know mine with\nyou there was a professional nature to\nit but i viewed it as a curiosity\nconversation\nbecause i didn't you were you're very\nvery very well known\nand particularly by young people and\nthat's who introduced me to you but\ni knew of you but i didn't know of your\nmassive popularity and even like today\nas you i didn't know was the number one\nhealth podcast in the world it blows my\nmind um\nso i mean because that's just so\npowerful so i think\nany any conversation with somebody\nthat you feel matters you know\nlike i would go on this curiosity where\ni still do this every two weeks meet\nsomeone that's expert or renowned\nand anything i don't do and i\nthey're nobel laureates they're\nscientists they're all art forms there\nwere\nthere's jay there's many people and\ni am those conversations must be\nexperienced through eye contact through\nlooking at somebody face to face\nand that be by that\nby creating that bridge then you have\nthe privilege to be curious then you\nhave the privilege to ask\nquestions and you have the privilege of\ncreating this\namazing kind of alchemy that can happen\nand\nand all of the great insights that i've\never gleaned\nhave come from these kinds of\nconversations\nand i always just felt like each one of\nthese conversations yours included\nis just like a dot in a greater\nconstellation of dots\nand i just have faith that they'll\nconnect someday yes\nthey don't have to directly connect they\ncan just live in your mind and be part\nof the way you curate your life\nyes um and so so any of those\nconversations are essential\num have to be face to face absolutely\nand it's so fascinating you say that\nbecause i feel like\ni'm not sure i know so many people who\nmake time for curious conversations in\ntheir lives\nso it's almost like when you say that\nthese are the types of conversations we\nhave to do face to face\ni'm almost going through and thinking\nhow often do we make time for that is\nthat something you've made time for\nforever is this a habit that you\ncultivated and practiced for decades\nbecause i think a lot of people would\nlook at it and be like oh brian of\ncourse you can do that now because you\nhave really cool friends to hang out\nwith but i'm guessing this is something\nyou've been doing for years and years\nand years and years yeah i did this\nstarted this the day i graduated college\nactually um so i've i've done it\ncompletely dead broke uh owing people\nmoney\nso just graduating college owing\nmoney on everyone when you go through it\nbut but and then\ni've always i've always done this and i\ncreated it as i\nas a discipline that i would not fail at\num\nyou know i would i would not i would\nalways do i'd be obedient to this\nand um and i would have to grovel\nand beg and you know when on the movie\nmy very first movie splash i did some\nother things preceded it\nthat made me well known but not well\nknown enough i mean\ni wanted to meet edward teller the\nfather of the hydrogen bomb\nand and for a bunch of reasons i don't\nhave to agree with somebody\ni just have to be interested in them or\nthe excellence or\ntheir process but it took almost three\nyears\nfor him to finally say yes jonah salt\ntook\ni mean years but i just kept\nif you do enough homework which you have\nto do\nand you're persistent and you're\npolitely persistent\noften i would have to wait till like one\nof their asset that one of\nthose people's assistants had just quit\nand they have a new person i can\nactually\nfollow to their car or something i don't\nknow but\nso no i've done it for my whole life\nyeah it's\nreally a way to enlarge in my life\nso it enlarges my mind and large\nenlarges\ncreates elasticity in me you know\nemotional capability\nand then of course it just you gain\nthese fantastic insights that\nyou can transport to something yeah no\nit comes across it comes across so\ngenuinely in the way you tell it in the\nbook but also the way we've connected\nand\ni think that's what everyone who's\nlistening or watching right now the one\nthing i'd love for you to do\nif you're sitting back at home or you're\nin your car is start scheduling curious\nconversations like start finding people\nthat\nyou're curious about not just\nprofessionally like notice the\ndifference here it's not about\na professional meeting it's not trying\nto get a deal it's not trying to close\nsomething it's about\nfinding someone that you're genuinely\ninterested in that sparks your curiosity\nlike you said could just be a dot that\none day might connect\nyeah and i love that and i'd highly\nrecommend that we schedule for me the\npodcast is that yeah like the podcast is\njust like this\nbeautiful way of just getting to like\ndive into someone else's mind\nwith no need apart from wanting to learn\nand grow so\nyeah i couldn't agree more that it's\npowerful one one of the things that\ni'm really intrigued by is uh\none thing that i think you can help us\nwith we live in a generation today\nwhere people's attention spans are just\ngetting\nsquashed and so today now you're not\ncompeting\nagainst another person you're competing\nagainst a phone\nso the phone has access like can anyone\nbe more interesting than a phone\nbecause a phone has access to everything\nright that's the question\nhow do you how you develop patience to\nstay\ninterested in someone even when you're\nwondering what is the connection here\ni'm not even sure i'm\nlearning like when you're finding it\nalmost difficult how have you\nstayed interested in someone when you\ndon't have a common denominator because\ni feel\ntoday we look for commonalities and if\nwe don't find it we're like well\nthere's nothing to learn yeah does that\nmake sense it makes\ntotal sense it makes total sense well um\nhow do i stay interested uh\ni well first of all you don't have to\nstay interested there could be\nthere's a point where if you feel like\nyou're forcing it\nor they're forcing it then you don't\nhave to you know you just always want to\nbe polite because you\nwe all want good will we all want the\nwind blowing to our back\nyes you know but um but it's often\nit's it's very unique like only just\nbefore our trip\num about six weeks ago i had an uber\ndriver\nand i i said um and what's good is they\ndon't initiate conversation\nso i will initiate i said where are you\nfrom and he said he's from serbia\nand so we've got this conversation\nit led me to the com it led me to\nmartial arts\nand i said well i've taken many\ndifferent martial arts i mentioned he\ngoes\nhave you taken this russian martial arts\ncalled\nsystema i said no so i go\nuh will you drive into my house so\ninstead of just dropping me off\nhe drove in i got all of his contacts\nbecause he also said that his\nmother-in-law\nhas seen me before and i believed you\nknow i felt\nsafe you know and then um i then said\ncan i\ncan will you charge me to teach me this\nmartial arts form called systema\nhe said he would so i had him come over\neven\ni had a broken wrist at the time and i\nstill did it\nand learned systema which was a very\ndifferent kind of\na form of martial arts and i was really\nglad to do that but i didn't know that\nwould happen\num wow i didn't know that after the\nparis terrorist attacks\nseveral years ago that that that uber\ndriver was dropping us off at the\nat the ritz hotel and\ni asked him this question about the tax\nand i said\nwell i want to know how it made people\nfeel\nlike just how does it make you feel\none-on-one on the street not just\nwhat the news is and he said shame\nand i thought that was really\ninteresting to me\nand i understood it because i understood\nthat it\nmeant to them that they don't have the\nstrength themselves to protect\nthemselves\nso it's about protection because they\nwere victims recently of two\nterrorist attacks yes so you just learn\na lot\nif you just are open-minded yes yes so\nyou can learn from anyone and ever you\ncan learn from everything\nit doesn't need to be yeah someone that\nyou've admired or looked up to it could\nactually be\nyeah you just have to not get ahead of\nyourself and hope that it has some\nmaterial reason for you right and then\nit kind of hap something\nsomething almost always good happens and\nyou're so right\nlike in your health podcast it's like\nwe're living in like\nyou know an epidemic of loneliness and\nit's just accelerating\nwhere there's we are so connected but\nthe possibility of\nloneliness is even more because of of\nwhat you just said\nyeah and the thing that\nthat you could speak to i mean is that\neverything\nthere's a metric for it uh within our\nwithin our medical system\nexcept internal pain and loneliness is\nthere's pain and you can't measure it\nand i just think\nthis thing of looking at somebody\nis the beginning of getting out of pain\nyeah and it might be the beginning of a\nmovie or a television show or\nor just confidence itself you know like\nhaving confidence\ncan really you know is really valuable\nyeah and\nlet's touch on confidence because i\nthink you're so right that\nlike sitting and talking to someone can\nactually be really like scary and almost\nfeel like you're naked like if\nyou feel like someone's looking at you\nand especially when like you said like\nyou talked about\nlooking at someone you know with\ncompassion without judgment\nbut often we're looking at people and\nit's very piercing or you feel pierced\nby people's look\nhow do we develop like okay stepping in\nface to face but how do we kind of break\ndown those\nbarriers that we have of feeling really\nscared to be looked at\nor to see which i think so many of us\nhave like we look away when people look\nat us like we try and avoid\neye eye contact because we feel kind of\nnervous by it\nyeah yeah well i i think\ni think you you would could probably\nattest to this is that yeah\ni mean everybody the number one of the\nnumber\nnumber one two or three fear is public\nspeaking yes\nyeah i could not i was well my first\nyear in college\nas a freshman i was in a public speaking\nclass and\nit was 125 kids his name was mr french\ni can say this there's some names i\ncan't say and mr french took me aside at\nthe end of the class and he said\ni i really would like to recommend that\nyou discontinue\ncollege oh wow it was like the most\ndiscouraging thing i really\nbe because i couldn't i couldn't do it i\ncouldn't public speak\ni couldn't speak in this class so he\nreally thought i should go to an\noccupational school and discontinue\ncollege\nand um so that's how acutely\nyou know nervous i was but somebody said\nto me one day\njust think you're to yourself like\nyou're just giving somebody a gift\nstart off by saying i'm grateful to be\nhere that will be\nthe beginning of how you can loosen up\ni'm grateful to be here i'm grateful\nyou're here having me\nand it's the same thing with eye contact\nyou don't have to say i'm grateful but\nyou can feel like\nyou know what everyone is feeling what\nyou're feeling if you look at somebody\ncalmly and go hey how you doing\nsomething good will happen it will be\nvery very unusual if something good\ndoesn't happen yeah so that's so true i\nlove that so i think of it as\nas just a nice thing to do just yeah\nthing\noh 100 100 and i think you're so right\nthat it can be an internal thing\nyeah it doesn't need to even be\nverbalized it doesn't need to be\nvocalized it can be internal\nyeah absolutely absolutely and if you\nstart feeling that\nit's kind of like um i had some\nvery famous guy say to me i knew you\nbefore you made your very first movie\nnight shift and now you've made all\nthese movies and won oscars and stuff\nlike that\nbut i know you brian have you ever\nlooked in the mirror and kissed the\nmirror\nand i said no i haven't\nso it just means like take a minute to\nlove yourself a little bit\nyes and then give that to other people\nyeah absolutely no no 100 100 and i\nthink that that's so much of it\nthat if we've never looked at ourself in\nthe eye it's hard to look others in the\neye\nyeah yeah right like it becomes more\ncomplicated it's like if we've not been\nable to truly see ourselves\nthen how can we allow others to see us\ntruly as well\nyeah and and and i feel like no you\nyou've inspired just now i've never said\nthat before i'm just never said it i've\nnever said that\noh my god i thought you just must have\nalready i've literally just no no i've\nliterally just said it right now in this\nconversation\nyeah it's just you know to to be truly\nseen one has to see themselves first\nto allow others to truly see you and i i\ndefinitely\nexperienced that in uh there's a\nbeautiful\nanalogy in the vedic literatures of a\nmirror of the mind and it said that\nwhen we first try and see ourselves the\nmirror is very dusty\nand so you can't see yourself so when\nyou try and wipe the dust the first\nthing that happens is the dust comes in\nyour face\nand so it's actually quite a tough\nprocess to start seeing yourself and\nthen finally when the dust disappears\nyou can then see yourself clearly so a\nlot of us are going through that dusting\nphase\nof trying to see ourselves clearly and\ntherefore the people that we want to\nshow ourselves to we can't because\nwe're still trying to see ourselves yeah\nwow that's very heavy i love\ni love don't worry if it's too heavy i\nlove that i well i\nyou know just like it's also just as a\npersonal validation\ni kind of felt like what i said to you\nis what i felt but now it's further\nvalidated by\nyou know um well i i you know body of\nwork well when i was reading through the\nbook all i was doing was nodding\nall the time but what i found different\nand what i love about the storytelling\nand i'm trying\ni know you're telling some great stories\nfrom there and i want everyone else to\ngo and get the book too but\nthe thing in the book is that the way\nyou tell stories is is it's\nit's effortless but it's also from your\ndeep observation and analysis right like\nit's you you deeply observe\ndetails yes from what people are wearing\nall the way through to their lips\neverything matters\nyeah and it does and that's what i loved\nabout the book and that's what i'm\nvalidating back is that i truly believe\nthat becoming an\nexpert in observation yeah is is\neverything because if you\ngenuinely are observing the scene and\nthe unseen\nyeah no that's really smart i love it i\nlike i learned from you no no no i\nlove it you're inspiring everything\nwe're doing i mean you went through the\ndiscipline of becoming a monk\nwhich is i and i so admire that it's um\nbut it's it's really true you have to be\ndeeply observational yeah well we'd have\nthe awkward task of having to walk down\nthe same path every day\nand having to find something new on it\nyeah like that was one of our tasks like\nwe were trying to walk down the same\npath and have to find something unique\nevery day\nyes wow and it was like it's hard after\na while like it sounds easy but after a\nwhile no you really have to look\nand and i think that's what i'm seeing\nin you is that you're meeting all these\npeople that everyone in your industry\nmeets but you're able to meet them\nuniquely\ni do that's what you i definitely do\nyeah many people have met all the people\ni've met yes but don't\nsee what i see or feel what i felt from\njust like could be a millisecond just\nsome little\nnuance or a question that they turn away\nfrom and you wonder why and\nit means something yeah absolutely how\nmany days did you do that particular\nthing though\nthat we did for about 30 days so it's\nand you had to articulate it yes we had\nto explain every day and and often they\nwould\nthey would play with us in the sense\nthat we were asked to find a new stone\nevery day\nand so what you would do what your what\nyour material manipulative mind would do\nis you would find two stones and then\nyou'd say okay i'm going to show this\none today and tomorrow i'll talk about\nthat one\noh my gosh and then and the next day the\nmonks would say okay now we're not\nlooking for stones anymore we're looking\nfor new flowers\nand your ego mind loses and you're like\noh man like you know and it's just great\nbecause it just crushes your\nyour ego and your manipulative mind to\nshow you that life doesn't work like\nthat like\nyou've got to really be present it's not\njust about manipulating the answer\nanyway so yeah\nyeah so you can't start developing\npatterns and outsmart it correct that's\ncorrect and we think we can right yeah\nwe think we can how have you let go of\ncontrol in these conversations i feel\nlike\nwhen you're in these difficult meetings\nor you're in situations even when there\nmay be abyss\nhow do you let go of control because\nwhen i'm reading this it sounds like\nyou're able to really detach\nyeah from where things are going and\nallow it to naturally flow\nhow have you given up control over these\nthat's a good question um and i know\nit's\ntaking something about it well i think\nuh i i know what you're saying uh i\nthink i trust that i'll have something\nto add\nbecause i do come to all these\nconversations\nprepared so how do you prepare tell me\nthat\nwell i would read something about\nsomebody you know i would read\nbut but i i leave some things unsaid i\nknew you were a monk when we met\ni knew that you did that um and i knew\ncertain very important facts uh although\ni didn't know there was a number one\npodcast in the world\nbut i knew some very important facts but\ni wanted to be fresh and have it be real\nso when i meet you i can discover with\nyou\nand you will say something to me that\nwill lead to something else that i don't\nknow the answer to\nyes and that becomes really fun and it\nbecomes exciting and\nand becomes like you know i don't want\nto sound weird but it becomes like your\nbest\ndate then like you're you're in the zone\nof something\ncool you know like in that vertical line\nbut you don't know where it's going and\nhow it's gonna how it's gonna produce\nlife\nyeah and so that's really fun for me\num i you know i am scared sometimes of\nif there's nobody that fits silent\nbut i just get through that how do you\nhow do you deal with\nawkward silences and conversations i\nthink that's something that everyone\nwho's listening right now knows that\nwhether you're on a date\nor you're at dinner with friends yeah\nthere's so many awkward silences and\nyou're sitting with\nhugely influential people and there's\nthose awkward silences how do you\nnavigate those i'm not beyond like\ngroveling girl i might just go like oh\ncome on what are you thinking about\nor and if i get nothing\nthen i'll say i'll do the i will i will\nturn\na fact into a question i'll go did you\nknow the following thing did you know\nthat song from gucci mane just dropped\nlast week or i'd say\num i was just i went to the atacama\ndesert\nand have you ever been they go no and\nthey just\nno i go well i went because i was\nsearching for the greatest night sky in\nthe world and my wife\nsaid it there's two places and one of\nthem is the atacama desert\nin northern chile so we went to it wow\nor i could say everyone can go like\nhow's your family where's your vacation\nwhat do you like to eat\nwhat do you hate to eat you can go you\ncan invent stuff\nyeah and this is part of what you're\nsaying like i feel like there's such a\nneed for us to become better\nconversationalists\nyes there are and and i feel like we've\nstarted talking in abbreviations\nand acronyms because of social media so\nlike absolutely i i like you know like\nyou would it's such a normal thing\nwhen your partner is out to message them\nand just say milk\nlike you would just say milk in a\nmessage and they know that that means\nget milk\nyeah and you know what that means but\nthen when you turn that into a\nconversation and you start talking in\nlike you see them walk out the door and\nyou're like milk with nothing else and\nthere's nothing else and it's like so\nmuch of our conversation gets shrunk\ninto\nabbreviations and acronyms yes it does\nand no doubt\njust stuff and i'm just like but there\nis a need what i feel you're doing is\nyou're telling us to expand our\nvocabularies and our minds to\nactually dive into a real conversation\nand stop talking\nlike we do on small tests trust that an\nact trust\nthat an actual conversation will produce\nsomething of value yeah\nyou don't have to know what it is but i\nguarantee you'll produce something of\nvalue\neven if it's awkward at first yeah and i\nlove preparation and trust i think\nthose are great practical takeaways for\neveryone listening that preparation\nand trust together yes is a beautiful\nsynergy\nyeah you have to do preparation yes you\ndo because then you're not\nthat's not fair to the person you're\ncalling up or texting\nor emailing can i meet you you have to\ndo some preparation\nyeah correct correct and there's no\nshortcuts yeah and just for everyone's\ninformation this is the research we do\nfor all our guests like we go\ndive in like it's prepared and and at\nthe same time i love the reason why i'm\nvalidating preparation and trust is\nthat's how i approach this conversation\nof\nwe're very prepared we're very\nresearched but at the same time i just\nwant to have a real exchange yes\nand so i'm not tied to that framework\nbut the framework gives you a foundation\nto then\nbuild on yeah right i mean look look\nthere are times yes\nthere are times where i'm interviewing\nsomebody and i know their body of work\nbut\nthey just written a book and i sometimes\nsay to my wife veronica\nshould i tell him i read it and then\nwe always conclude no say i heard about\nit i heard it was amazing but i haven't\nhad a chance to read it yes\num but you can choose whatever you want\nto choose that's my choice because i\ndon't want to get busted yeah because\nthen it just kind of undermines the\nwhole\nthing so absolutely so you can't do\neverything\nbut you can do enough you can do\nsomething\nyou know you can we can all prepare a\nlittle yes\nyeah i love that one one of the things\nthat fascinates me about your work is\nthis theme of redemption\nyeah like this consistent theme that\nkeeps coming back up and i think that\nwith communication even within\nface-to-face communication redemption is\nsuch a need in our lives\nyeah because i think we think we regret\nwhat we've said\nwe feel pain by what we've said or heard\nfrom others\nlike communication has so much weight to\nit when it's been done negatively that\nredemption is something that we all need\nwhere does that why is that theme so\nstriking for you and\nand how have you seen that kind of play\nout in your work well okay\nso redemption um\nwell first of all my goal with making\nmovies or television shows or whether\nit's friday night lights\nwhere they lose the game originally in\nthe movie or you don't always have to\nwin\nat things um but it's good\nredemption to me would be uh\nyou know an emotional resolution\nthat is a plus so\nyou don't have to get the girl you just\nhave to do your best\nyou don't have to get the girl you just\nhave to have dignity you just\nin other words i i just want either the\nmovies or television their shows are\ndocumentaries and\nyou know um pavarotti which we just\nfinished it wasn't a perfect person\nbut there's redemption in pavarotti so i\nwant to show that i want\ni want people to i want to send out good\nvibes into the world\nhowever it goes even if it's just me\nsaying hey to somebody hey\nlike or um i don't want to\nthere's so many examples i just want to\nhave good vibes\ngood vibes out there i i i realized\num this is a big digression but i i kind\nof learned\nthe message of this when as first of all\nas a kid i'd have my parents\nperiodically take me to a movie\nand it was always like a huge drag to\nget in the car it was very inconvenient\nthen my dad would be mad because he\ncouldn't find a parking spot\nand then all of a sudden there's bad\nvibes and then we have to wait in line\nand then we get\nour ticket and then we have to put our\nsweaters down or someone has to save the\nseats while someone gets the food\nanyway before the movie starts the whole\ntheater the auditorium is usually\nkind of tense and bad vibes so that was\nmy\nmemory of the movie-going experience\nof course i loved all those james bond\nmovies and stuff nonetheless\nthat's what i remember and then i\nremember the same thing happened when\nyou got out\ntrying to get your car to the parking\nspot all that stuff\ni see the movie e.t\nin the cinerama dome this famous theater\nin hollywood\nactually we're quite close to it i've\nbeen there yeah it's yeah\nand it was very new at the time and all\nthe same things were happening hard to\npark\nand i'm thinking oh my god the movie's\nover\ni sort of thought of course people are\ngoing to step on my feet i'm just a\nlittle guy\nit was so strange everybody the whole\nvibe was really good nobody pushed\nno rush to the car the energetics of the\nentire\nauditorium had changed had transformed\nto something else\nand i thought wow that's amazing if i\ncan be\nsome way have that be my goal to try to\nmake\nmovies or television shows that make you\nfeel better you know yeah um\nbecause that gives you confidence and it\nand confidence\ngives you the ability to hatch new ideas\nand\nyou know so so that's kind of how\nredemption factors into it in the movie\nlike eight mile that i produced about a\nrapper you know i've watched that movie\nway too many times\neminem's behind that you can't see it oh\ni know yeah\nso yeah and so that movie is not like a\nman be you know it's not a\nit's not it's you know it's a serious\nmovie you know it's intense\nthere's you know words and this and that\nand uh there was there's acts of\nviolence and stuff\nbut ultimately it's an aspirational film\nit's a movie about a kid that had to\nbecome self-actualized to sort of\nemotionally survive it wasn't even about\nhim\ngoing off to be the biggest hip-hop star\nin the world in fact that isn't what\nhappens in the story of the movie\nhe just was able to say yeah i am white\ntrash liberate himself from all his\nemotional injuries so that he can\nactually look at people\nand know himself and dust off the mirror\nas you said\nso yeah you know it it's there's all\nthese different sizes shapes and forms\nin which you can do that\nyeah no and i love that and i definitely\ngot that message from that movie i mean\ni must have watched that movie growing\nup i don't know like\na million times and it's every time i\nwatched it personally\nit just gave me more permission to be\nmyself wow like that's what i was\ngetting from see that's cool yeah it's\nlike permission to be yourself\nbecause that's what you see his\ncharacter be rabbit go through of just\ngetting permission to then finally stage\nand say be on stage\nand not be better or be worse yeah just\nto be yourself\nyes and i think that that's that's\nreally to me where human connection\nstarts is when\nyou give yourself permission to be\nyourself and you give someone else the\npermission to be themselves\nwithout judgment ambition all the other\nstuff you mentioned of just\nwithout like crowding it into like you\nhaving to be a certain way and them\nhaving to be\nyeah well that's so well said because\nthat is sort of like\nthinking of your best date or your best\nmeeting with somebody\neven just a business meeting your best\nmeeting is when\nthat happens right when those guards go\ndown and\nboth people feel permission to be\nthemselves but i thought you did that\nwhen i first met\nyou obviously i'd i mean some of you the\nmovies you've made are some of my\nfavorite movies rush too\nis one of my favorite movies i love that\nmovie and it's\nfor me those have been so when i got the\nopportunity to meet you and my team had\nmentioned to me that we could me\ni you know for me it was like i was like\nwow i'm meeting someone that i've like\nadmired for a long time\nreally look up to you i was nervous\nbecause i was meeting someone that you\nknow that that's important to me in some\ncontext\nand and it's just you were so good at\nhelping me be myself because the first\nthing i think you said to me when i came\nto your home was just like\noh gee i've been listening to you all\nweek and like you're like i've been\nlistening to your youtube videos and i\nheard you say this and i was just like\noh wow like i just feel at ease because\nsomeone's giving me context that they've\nthey're aware of\nwhat i'm doing and and they're meeting\nme and i just felt wow someone who's so\nbusy\nsomeone who has so many huge things\ngoing on\nhad the time to do that yeah and i'm\nlike if you've got the time to do that\nto make someone like me feel at ease\nthen for me\nwe've all got time to do that yeah for\neveryone that we meet you know and so\noften i think\nwe have meetings where we've done no\npreparation for the person yeah\nsomeone walks into a room and you're\nlike all right so tell me why you're\nhere right and it's like it's horrible\nyou're like always pitching yourself\nand it's like i think people don't want\nto pitch themselves\nyou're not your best when you're\npitching yourself no and and i think\nthere's a pressure to pitch yourself and\ni love being in scenarios where\ni'm not pitching myself because that's\nwhen i can truly give myself permission\ni feel you really did that for me\nwhen we met and i thought that was a\nbeautiful thing to point out because i\nfeel\nthe fact that you did that for me i'm\ni'm hoping people listening and watching\nwe can all do that for everyone in our\nlives\nyes just giving people that yeah what a\nmemory you have because i do remember\nbefore the day we met a lot of people\nsaid oh my god you're meeting jay shetty\nand then on and on and it was like all\ndiverse groups of people are going oh\nyou're meeting jay oh you're meeting jay\nand i thought\nwow i've really missed out by not\nmeeting jay clearly\nso then um jamie said okay you know\nwhatever day it was\nso i crashed course in like the last\nthree the three days prior to this\nmeeting\ni watched and listened to so many of\nyour pieces now that\nwow i get it you know like i actually\nwas able to\nwell it was very easy to connect into\ninto you so um yeah yeah no thank you\nbut no i really felt that and i think\nthat that's such a powerful thing to do\nthat for someone is to help them\ni think sometimes we have to let our\nguards down but we have to help other\npeople let their guard down too\nyeah and i think that is an environment\nand a space that we create which i think\nyou create\nand i think that's why so many of the\nmost successful people in the world that\nare mentioned in this book\nare able to do that with you as well oh\nthanks yeah\ni think well the thing i did do another\nthing i feel like i have so many stories\nyeah everything go for it but when i\nstarted my career and i got and i\nall of a sudden i i had uh you know some\npower and money and all that\nyou know i was very aware of powerful\nmen for the most part having that\nelevated desk when you walked in\ni mean all those hollywood cliches are\nreally true\nyou know you'd go in to see like in the\nday you know there was\nsam goldwyn or you know louis b mayer i\nmean it was very long before me or daryl\nzanik\nand they had known to have elevated\ndesks you know like\nso when you walked in you felt smaller\nand you sat across the desk and\nand even in my time in the 1990s it was\nstill carried out that way guys that\nwere really powerful\nthey all had bla bla vinyl furniture\nlike really lethally tough\nblack stuff and um and i remember\nthinking i'm gonna do just the opposite\ni'm gonna i'm not gonna even have a desk\nor i had one way off in the distance and\neverything was always like sitting\naround a very\ndemocratic kind of a vibe where it's\nlike a coffee table\na big l-shaped couch and you just sit\nand chill because you\nget the best out of artists when they're\nnot scared yes so i thought\nthat's the that's the way i'm going to\nget my competitive edge yeah not by\nintimidating somebody and making them\ncertain that they know that i'm powerful\ni'm going to just the opposite i love\nthat that's awesome\nthat's so beautiful and you did that our\nfirst meeting was at your home yeah\nyeah i was like okay i'll it okay you\nknow and i just think that you you\nreally live that and i think that's\namazing because\ni i always feel that the people that\nchange culture are the people that\nchange culture like you have to change\nthe culture\nto be someone who makes a difference and\ni think today so many people are scared\nbecause they're following the rules like\nthey see their agent\ntreat the younger agent badly so they\nthink when i become the senior agent\nthat's what i'm gonna have to do\nyeah and i think we just perpetuate that\nculture we don't break cycles and we\ndon't break generational curses\nright like we just let them perpetuate\nit's amazing to see you just like go no\ni'm\ni'm going to change that what gave you\nthe courage to like what gave you the\nboldness to\nto do that um well look i\nlike everybody else want to feel special\ni want to earn\nmy right i want to earn you know i want\nto earn\nfeeling special yeah and i want to and i\nwant to be acknowledged for it\num so you know there was a time\nwhere like the five main big producers\nall four of them all looked sort of\nsimilar\nyou know they had they did action films\nthey were very\naggro um they yelled at\nassistants and stuff and you know they\nwere very aggressive\nthrew plates of food on them there's a\nlot of famous stories\nnow i don't even want to say that i'm\nbetter than that i was just different\nthan that i'm not constructed\ni don't have a lot of sort of\nconfrontational stuff going on in me\nuh in that way so i thought how am i\ngonna have a nick do i need a nickname\nor\nhow do i do this um and i and i quite\nhonestly i\na lot of them had you know beards i\ncan't i could not grow a beard quite\nhonestly\nso i thought how am i going to do it so\ni did want to\nyou know have something and so that's\nwhen i sort of popped my hair up\nbecause my daughter sage thought oh that\nlooked great wearing a swimming pool\nand i thought well okay that could be\ndifferent\nyeah yeah and um so but i\ni didn't really you know um\ni i just kind of felt like and my career\nstarted with making a mermaid\nyes yeah i mean if my if my career\nstarted by with an\naction film or it started with um\nsomething that was\nless risky you know less against the\nsystem or\nyeah you know like that seemed less\ncrazy like everyone\nthought a mermaid movie is if you're\ngonna pick what could be a dumb idea\nthat would be\nthe dumb idea yes so i had a lot of\npeople hundreds of people sort of say\nthat was a\nvery bad idea and so the fact that it\nworked\nvalidated this sort of movement for\nmyself to just\ncontinue to try my finding my authentic\nself\ntrust the theme that lives inside of\nthat authentic self\nand have that be transported in to\nmovies or television\nthat i do and so most of my movies and\ntelevision shows the ones i work on\nthat certainly that work have a theme\nand usually the theme is rooting for\nlove rooting for friendship\nbrotherhood is always a thing to me you\nknow\num and self-respect and identity is\ncritical you know it's the avoidance of\nshame\nyeah so many movies are kind of access\naround\nof respect you know having\nmen men want to feel respected we all\nwant to feel respected women want to\nfeel respected\nyeah and so you have to allow people to\nhave that\nidentity um and best the good things\nwill come from it\namazing that's beautiful brian we end\nevery interview with the final five\nthis is a rapid fire quick fire okay so\nanswers have to be\none word to one sentence maximum uh\nthat's a cap\nand i will probably i will probably make\nyou expand on stuff but\nbut we'll try and stick with that right\nthis is your final fight\nyes the first question is the movie\nyou've re-watched the most\ngodfather okay nice second question what\nis one\nmovie you wish you created um\noh my oh god what is that with michael j\nfox i love that movie uh\num uh you know what it is\nback to the fact that i'm sorry back to\nthe future because i had made many many\noh sorry i'm gonna stop\nback in the future i wish i would no\ncamera well because i had produced a lot\nof hit comedies but when back to the\nfuture was made and i thought i thought\nwow that blows my mind that takes comedy\nto a\nwhole other level i just thought the\nintricacy the genius\nto create something you know retrofit\nback that story\nwas brilliant i thought it was really\nbrilliant i wish i could have made that\nmovie\namazing question number three if you\ncould have a conversation a curious\nconversation with anyone\ndead or alive who would it be someone\nyou haven't spoken to yet\ni would really love love\nto meet really have a conversation with\nthe pope\nwith the pope okay side question not one\nof the final five what would you ask him\nwhat would be one question that you'd\nask him\nhow does he have the strength and\nability to\nchange which is almost an inflexible\nsystem nice\nyeah amazing okay great i'm sure we can\ndive into that on another day too\nquestion number four what's one of your\nfavorite scenes from the house of cards\nbecause i know you like this shirt oh my\ngod i do love house of cards uh\ni don't have a favorite scene but i\ni do like i did like when kevin spacey\nwould become so\nevil so badass that it's shocking you\nknow i guess\ni like things that are unpredictable and\nhe he and that became unpredictable\nso amazing and i liked it it was a big\nsurprise to me because i offered robin\nwright to be in a beautiful mind i think\nshe's an amazing actress\num but she declined and uh i shouldn't\nsay that but anyway\nshe did and i've always been a big fan\nbecause she's brave and she's\nshe she's super badass in that show yeah\ni love it and the final\nand fifth question of the final five is\nif you could give one message to\neveryone listening what would that be if\nyou had to give a final message to\neveryone listening\nit's a one step to look at somebody in\nthe eyes\nplease do it amazing i love it how\nbeautiful what a beautiful message to\ngive to people just\nforget facetime forget messaging get in\nfront of people\nget face to face have more curious\nconversations\nhave conversations without ambition that\nline is going to stick with me the rest\nof my life\nso
