the children are raised after\nthey've checked off\nall the lists now they're like i was\nnice but what did i get for myself\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health

power her name is dr shafali and a\nnew book is called a radical awakening\nturn pain into power embrace your truth\nand live free dr shafali welcome to on\npurpose\nthank you jay and i'm so excited to be\nback with you thank you for coming in\nperson i'm so grateful\ni couldn't miss the opportunity no like\nwe've been friends\nfor five years now so the first time we\nmet was when we tweeted each other\nand i remember we were both like this\nperson looks like me\nand and we were messaging away and then\nwhen me you and my wife are together\npeople are like what's going on i know\ni know unfortunately they always call me\nyour aunt and no they\ndon't how is your nephew jay and i go\nno they don't no they don't but honestly\ni you were one of the first people to\never reach out to me when i first\nstarted my journey\nand helped me so much supported me so\nmuch\nencouraged me so much and i just saw you\nyou know writing three new york times\nbest-selling books you were\nyou're oprah's favorite parenting expert\ni mean you know just so many\ngreat accomplishments and today we're\ntalking about your new book\nand you've been sharing with me a little\nbit and with my research we've been\ntalking about how\nthis is dedicated to women yes to find\ntheir power\nyeah tell me about why this was the\nright book right now\nwell not only because it was the emblem\nof my own\npersonal finding of power but we\nwomen and not to denigrate men but we\nreally are the container the nurturing\nemblem for our children and because we\nprimarily raise our children we're the\nconnectors we are the nurturers of the\nearth\nwe carry the feminine principles so\nstrongly within us\nthat if we are subjugated as we\nare today in the toxic patriarchy that\nwe live in\nthen there is no hope for our planet so\ni\nwrote this book to awaken us women to\nignite\nour own sovereignty so that when we step\ninto it\nthe earth can heal i love this already\nbecause i there's a few things that come\nto mind and i know you\nbeautifully weave together eastern\nprinciples\nand you know you're a therapist and\nmodern psychology and science\ntell me a bit about how do you think\nwomen's power\nhas been dampened and weakened over time\nand what have we lost as a society\nbecause of that\noh my goodness so i imagine\nthat pre-recorded history women held\na more powerful pedestalized place so\nthis is my\nfantasy of that time however since\nrecorded history especially since the\nlast 10 000 years of the agricultural\nrevolution and then the industrial\nrevolution\nand our modern digitized technological\nrevolution\nwith each passing of era\nif you notice sociologically we have\nmoved away from the earth\nso to speak and you can see now we're\nliving in a virtual reality what does\nthat mean\nour intimacy within the tribe within the\ncommunity\nwithin the shared space of the earth\nother species and us that connection is\nbeing severed\nwe are so far removed now from\nreal reality i mean we literally can see\nreality\nin a helmet we don't have to go there\nwhat do we lose\nwith each pivotal turn away from these\nconnections\nwe lose our connection to ourselves with\neach movement away from\nthe earth our mother we move away\njust like a child grows up without its\nmothering so in the same way a child\nwho's brought up in an orphan is\ndisconnected\nfrom its mothering we as a humanity are\nmoving away from our mothering right i\nmean it's clear we have damaged the\nearth we have destroyed\nthe planet so with this\nmovement away into masculinity\nnow masculinity is beautiful i talk\nabout how we women\nwho are so embedded in our feminine need\nto embrace the masculine\nbut when the masculine becomes extreme\nas we are right now in a toxic\nmasculinity\nwhat happens is that we force the\nbeautiful feminine\ninto a toxic femininity so we are at\nextreme polarities and you know\nthrough eastern meditation dualism is a\ncurse\nso we're living in a polarized world in\na dualistic world\nand we've cut women from their power\nbecause it's a toxicly masculine world\nwhich doesn't favor the feminine and we\nwomen are in our feminine\nso in a very microscopic level let's\njust bring it down to\nmy family my child what happens in the\nhome\nwe women are taught to relinquish\nour inner voice so within the patriarchy\nof the culture there's another\npatriarchy\nwhich is in the parenting which is what\ni talk about right\nparenting is patriarchal hierarchical\ndogmatic and linear\nso just between parent and child even\nmother and daughter\nthere is a denigration of the daughter\nspirit even by the mother\nbecause she is subsumed in the bigger\npatriarchy\nso this linearity and hierarchy\nis toxic so i've been talking about\nconscious parenting\nas a whole being subjugating of children\nnow take that and put it within a toxic\npatriarchy\nthe girl child in particular the\ndaughter is really\nnow at the bottom of the totem pole yeah\nthen the girl child of color\nis even at the you know so we are living\nin a very stratified\nculture and it all goes down and affects\nme\nin my daily life yeah so even me\neducated you know phd i\nwas being swallowed in my own lastness\nso that's when i woke up in my 40s no\nearlier\nto realize that if i am lost to my own\ninner knowing and i am laying vanquished\nto my own power what must it be like for\nothers\nand that's why i wrote this book you\nknow each one of my books is\nreally ignited by my own journey as i'm\nsure yours is\nbecause until i feel it and until i've\nlived it i can't teach it\nyeah so i really uncovered my own\nlastness\nto find my foundness and this this book\nreally speaks to how every woman and man\ncan reclaim their last voice we have\nlost\nour true authentic voice as women\nas a culture as a species and our earth\nis losing its voice\nit's everywhere i mean this is a wake-up\ncall\na crisis in humanity but there is\nlight if we wake up to the light and so\nthis book\nspeaks about that journey from darkness\nto light and how each one of us can find\nour light\nyeah i love hearing this from you and\ni'm i mean that genuinely because\ni remember when i got married and which\nwas\nwe were just talking about it was just\nfive years ago but i've been with my\nwife now for about eight years that\nwe've been\ndating and together and in our culture\nwhen a woman is invited into a home it's\nconsidered like you're inviting\na goddess into your home right like\nlakshmi devi or right\nsaraswati that's actually the culture\nright and that's\nactually the mindset is that you're\nactually allowing this abundant\ngoddess to come into your home right\nthat's what it's meant to be right\num but often it's not translated in that\nway\nin actions and behavior yes and i know\nthat in my own way i can tell that when\ni've allowed\nand when i've worked with my wife\nto allow her abundance and to\nallow her to be her best self and her\ntrue self\nit's like the most beautiful bond you\ncan experience\nand if i ever get lost in the idea of\ncontrol or taming or\nyou know like just if you're trying to\ncontain is the right word as you said\nlike\nif i see myself having any of that which\nis not i'm actually not like that at all\nbut\nfrom society and what you hear if i ever\nsee myself trying to become\na container of that energy it actually\nloses its power and beauty\nright uh and and that can be as simple\nas loving my wife's spontaneity\nright to her actually being fulfilled if\nthat does any of that make sense\nabsolutely so women have been bridled\nyeah because of these institutions so in\nthis book i talk about how\nmarriage once a contract\nnow has become an engagement and where\nwomen are talked about as possessions\nand\nas objects of control and so if you veer\nout of that contract\nespecially in cultures like ours heavily\npatriarchal and\nunconscious then the woman is really\nderided and so she's lost\nso her only two options are to suffer\nand stay uh you know or to face\nostracism\nif she defies the norm so institutions\nthat we have created under this toxic\npatriarchy\nhave begun to encage us and until we\nreframe\nwhat marriage really means and you know\ni just went through a divorce\nso i had to reframe what divorce meant\nand the fears that came about because of\nmy fear of ostracism\nreally challenged me and made me realize\nthat we can't do this to our women\nwe are not property and we need to be\nallowed to be unbridled in our power to\nlive free\nso so these institutions are designed\nfor ownership\nand possession and control including\nparenting\nyes including education all these\ninstitutions\nthat we've created suffocate the true\nspirit\nand with the demise of the authentic\nself comes the demise of each other\nand then the demise of the earth what is\ndone to us we do to others\nabsolutely i love how you were speaking\nabout the beginning like mother nature\nand how\nthat disconnection is the disconnection\nfrom the feminine energy but also\neven as a man when we're suffocating\nthat energy\nyeah we actually also don't get to\nexperience it beautifully and deeply and\nwonderfully\nright right like that's from from\nlooking at it from a masculine\nperspective\nit's like if i'm stifling or suffocating\nfeminine energy then i actually don't\nget to experience the essence\nof how amazing it is right because in\norder for\na traditional man male to allow his\nfeminine wife to be blossoming in that\nenergy and to have ma\nthe woman to have masculine energy as\nwell takes the man to now explore these\naspects within themselves so that is\nthreatening for\nmen who don't want to do the inner work\nand they don't want to touch the\nvulnerability that that brings\nso they now get denied from that\nbeautiful process of growth themselves\nso this book really is not only an\ninvitation for women\nsitting on their couch right now feeling\ndislocated in their lives feeling\ndisenfranchised feeling scared\nto open up to their power but in doing\nso\nthey now challenge the men in their\nlives\nto now integrate themselves yeah let's\ntalk about\nthose women that you're just mentioning\ni'm sure a lot of them are listening to\nthis podcast or\nwatching us right now and they're\nlistening to you and saying dr shafali\ni'm\nyou know i'm in one of those marriages\nright now or i was raised in that way\nor maybe my parents still control my\nlife and\nmake my decisions for me where does that\nperson start their radical awakening\nlike what is the beginning as you say in\nthis book\nyou build the path tell us about that\nfirst step\nfor someone who who is like listening to\nyou right now and saying\ni get it i'm i'm there this book really\nspeaks to that\nlonely desolate place that all of us\nhave experienced\nuntil we break free we've all\nexperienced desolation of the spirit\nbecause we've been disconnected our\nparents controlled us\nwe grew up with a prescription list we\nwere raised to be people pleasers\ngood girls skinny girls you know we were\nwe women if we're honest have been\nraised with such\na standardized prescription list\nyou know of how to be and brown girls\nblack girls we all raised to be\nfollowing the standard of beauty the\nstandard of goodness\nand we've been suffocated our fathers\nmay have done it\nthe culture may have done it but now we\ndo it to ourselves\nso the radical awakening that i talk\nabout in this book is first about\nunderstanding what has been done to us\nmy culture and our parenting our early\nchildhood\nand then what we do to ourselves so now\nwe do it to ourselves right we look in\nthe mirror\nand we look at our big earlobe and we\nobjectify ourselves and denigrate\nourselves\nwe look at the wrinkle here nobody's\nlooking at it now but because it was\ndone to us\nwe do it to ourselves because they\nsuffocated us\nnow we suffocate ourselves so for the\nwoman out there\nwho's sitting there knowing that she's\nliving in fear that she's faking it that\nshe's\nlying to her partner that she's being\ninauthentic\ni would tell her that there is a path\nout\nof this i was one of those women who was\nliving a role\npleasing everyone around me just to keep\neveryone happy\nso for that woman i i would tell her\nthat it is scary\nbecause she's waking up to the\nrealization that her life has been false\nshe's been living in a false fake self\nand that's scary\nbut now so she looks ahead and she sees\na tunnel like\nwho am i without the role who will i be\nwithout being the mother the wife the\ndaughter\nbut as she goes through this tunnel and\nthis book is\na uh an accompaniment with her\nin that tunnel step by step then after\nthe darkness of the tunnel\nthere is of course light at the end\nthere's no tunnel that is interminable\nbut it feels like it's never ending but\ni want that woman i want that woman to\nknow\nthat every woman has felt like that\nbefore she's undertaken the greatest\njourney of her life\nand the greatest journey of her life\nwill take her to the reclamation of her\ntrue power\nand it's worth taking that journey i\ni i mean it it just sounds necessary i\nmean i'm not a parent yet and i don't\nhave a daughter but\ni would i would want anyone in my life\nto feel like they got to\nlive their true self and release their\npower i just think that\ni think people as a whole are so much\nmore beautiful when\nthey're getting to live their purpose\nand their power yes they're more\nattractive to themselves and to other\npeople\nyes and i don't mean attractive on a\nphysical basis i mean energetically\nattractive like yes\nyou just you notice when you meet\nsomeone yeah\nwho is experiencing that personal\nconnection to that power\nwhen you and if you feel comfortable\nsharing when when you\nwere battling going through the divorce\nand feeling ostracized like\nor experiencing that what was the\nhardest part about that\nyou know jay you and i growing up in\nindia in particular which is\nwhich has facets of the extremes of\ntoxic patriarchy\nno better than anyone what pressure\nwomen have\nto keep the home happy and safe\nand protected you know and keep it away\nfrom the judgment of others we are\nraised to not\nair our dirty laundry so to speak so\nhaving been\nconditioned and every woman in some way\nor the other is conditioned\nto bear the onus of keeping it all\ntogether of connecting\nof keeping the family safe and happy so\nwhen a woman dares like i\ndared in my imagination to step out of\nconvention\nto break the mold to to step out of the\nbox\nof my 25 year old relationship\nthe first and immediate fear is of\ncourse\nhow will i be loved how will i be\nvalidated will i be ostracized what will\nother people say\nbecause we've been conditioned to be\ntethered to the opinions of others\nso the first thing that comes up when\nyou want to be yourself\nis the battle between yourself and\nothers who am i for others\nversus who am i for myself this is the\neternal conflict this is why we don't\nmake\nbig monumental decisions in our lives\nwith courage\nbecause we're always weighing what other\npeople will think\nand how they will feel versus following\nour own voice\nso how do we negotiate this conflict\nwith compassion\nwith consciousness so that was my second\nchallenge\nokay i don't want to do this with anger\nand\nunconsciousness i want to be able to own\nmy own sovereignty with right and might\nbut with compassion so it took me two\nyears to negotiate\nthis you know we don't want to be\nimpulsive and reactive we want to\nprocess so i wanted to process\nwhy was i playing a role for so long\nwhat was the purpose of my role so my\nrole\nin my life was to be the savior\nto be the ultimate you know good girl to\nfollow\nthe way and in that i lost myself\nit was not anyone's fault on the outside\nit was not even my fault it was just my\nconditioning\nso women out there should not blame\nthemselves or shame themselves or blame\ntheir partners\nthis is about the awakening of the of\nthe self\nso you have to go through this period of\nliving asleep\nto wake up so so my fears were\nabout battling the conditioning\nversus the evolution and conditioning is\nalways suppressing the authentic self\nand the authentic self is longing to\ncome out so how do we negotiate that\nso it took me two years of arduous inner\nwork\nbecause i loved everyone in my system in\nmy old system i didn't want to just\ndiscard them\nthis is not about discarding anyone this\nis about truly divorcing the inauthentic\nparts\nof our old life so that's what i was\ndivorcing i wasn't divorcing my partner\ni was divorcing my own inauthentic self\nbut culture\ndoesn't have room for that you know it\nsays that you're shaming\nyourself or you're failing so i had to\nnegotiate those labels within my own\nbeing\nand come to the realization i'm not\ndoing anything wrong i haven't failed i\ni'm actually speaking my truth so i was\ngetting married\nto my true self and divorcing my\ninauthentic self\nand that's what marriage and divorce\nshould be about yeah\nabsolutely so well sir thank you for\nsharing that by the way i really\nappreciate that and i hope it's going to\nhelp a lot of people listening because\nit's\nyes it's such a strong attachment to\nthat conditioning\nthat feels like that's the right thing\nand that breaking that is the wrong\nthing\nand especially in in the traditions that\nwe're speaking about\nwhat when you start identifying those\nfears and you beautifully explained that\nlike\ntwo years can you imagine i'm just\ntrying to imagine living with something\nfearful for two years\nworking through that conditioning what\nkeeps you\nmotivated and inspired in that arduous\ntwo years\nof fear of judgment\nwhat keeps you going at that time so all\nmy work\nhas been about claiming the authentic\nvoice\nso when i finally woke up i didn't even\nknow\ni was not authentic i was as authentic\nas my consciousness\nallowed and you and i speak about the\nconsciousness quotient\nwe need to understand that all our\nquote-unquote mistakes in the past\nwere made under a certain consciousness\nquotient\nwe should not bemoan or regret or have\nguilt\nso you don't know what you don't know\nand until you wake up you don't know\nyou're asleep\nso i didn't know i was asleep till i\nwoke up\nthe minute i woke up to the fact that i\nmay have been inauthentic and i need to\nnow\nfly to a different space within my being\nwhat kept me motivated was that goal how\ncan i live my most\ntrue self all my work has been about\nchasing that\nso i had to really look at am i able to\nnow\nhold myself to my greatest standard\nwhich is\nam i living my true self or am i living\na lie\nso i did an exercise and i think people\ncould do this at home we'd love that\nwhere i declared i committed that\ni would pay attention to the things that\nwould come out of my mouth\nand if in any way it was in the role of\ngood girl\nor pleaser not being fake because i\nwanted to avoid conflict\ni wouldn't speak okay so i began\nobserving\nwow let me see how much is a lie\nand i literally couldn't speak because\neverything was\ntethered to the other person's desires\nand it was such a moment of excitement\nbut also\ntrauma to realize i don't know who i am\nyet\ni'm in my 40s i'm a mother of a teenager\nand i can't access my true voice like\nthis\nit takes me so much processing to go\nwhat do i want\nso if i am like that a psychologist a\nmeditator\ni realize there are plenty women out\nthere who are just\nlost to that inner access we shouldn't\ntake so long to find out what we want\nbut because we've placed everyone else\nbefore us our true self gets buried\nso that was my my chase was like\ndare yourself to go through this dark\ntunnel\nyes you will lose relationships yes\npeople will think you're\nthis or that and defy yourself\nto untether to live your true self so i\nknow now\nthat people may judge me and have ideas\nabout me\nbut that's not my focus anymore it is so\nmy inner liberation so that's my prize\nyou know now has it come at a price of\ncourse\nbut i was willing to pay that price for\nthis price of being free\nyeah yeah yeah no that that i mean that\nthat last line of what you just said of\nlike\npaying the price for the price of being\nfree\ni mean that just i mean that touches me\nso deeply when you hear that because\nit's\nit's almost like yes the path is painful\nbut\nthe power that you get to hold at the\nend of it as your own\nbut one of the biggest fears and you\nmentioned is just there one of the\nbiggest fears i feel for a lot of\nwomen is that they're putting everyone\nbefore them\nand a lot of women who are seeking their\npower would go oh but i have a\nchild that i'm not sure how they're\ngoing to react to it yeah\nmaybe it's almost like i and again you\ncan correct me if i'm wrong and i'm\ntotally open to being corrected but\nthe way i'm observing the fear is if i\nstand in my power\nthat could make my child or someone in\nmy life feel powerless somehow\nyes yes and that feels like a a\nreal fear because as you said like women\nas mothers so often are not thinking\nabout themselves at all\nyeah and so you kind of stay in pain\nfor the benefit of someone else i'm so\nhappy you brought that up because that\nis one of the most practical mountains\nbefore anyone who has a family if they\nwant to\nreconfigure the family our first concern\nas women is our children\nyou know we've been raised as mothers we\nare mothering in nature\nso even in my own life my daughter was\nmy primary concern\nand then you're conditioned to feel\nselfish if you put yourself first\nespecially women especially mothers 100\nand then there's a whole other practical\nside of money which\nis a big impediment because the way our\nculture is set up\nin these nuclear families women are not\nonly cut off from their\nsorority they don't have other women to\ncount on\nthey're they're raising their families\nalone they're also cut off from\nfinancial power\nright so most of these families have the\nmen in charge of the\nfinancial power so women feel bereft\nthen she's not being raised\nin a tribe anymore she's not raising her\nchildren in a tribe so now she's\nalone so there are many considerations\nfor women why they don't want to\nreconfigure their family\nso how do we negotiate that right so of\ncourse if your children are\nyoung if your children are teenagers all\nthis makes a difference my kid was a\nteenager so\nit was very different for me i was\nfinancially autonomous it was very\ndifferent for me\ni was on this path already it was\ndifferent for me so\nthere's no diminishing of the enormous\nhardship\nwe face to reconfigure family all i\nwould give women\nis the offering that the reason that\nthey're particularly finding it hard\nis not just because it is hard but\nbecause of how we've been conditioned\nto look at it right so i would encourage\nwomen and i do this all the time in my\npractice\nif you are in pain to the point that\nyour spirit is being suffused\nyour daughter is going to see that your\nson is going to see that\nso whether you like it or not you are\npassing down\nenormous trauma so keeping the family\ntogether for the sake of how it looks on\npaper\ndoesn't absolve the continuance of the\ntrauma\nso when i tell women that they go okay\nif i'm going to stay in trauma\nand pass down trauma for the sake of the\nappearance\nis that more worth it to me or saying\nforget the appearance\nlet me heal and pass down healing\nlet me tell you our kids want us healthy\nthey don't want us traumatized and the\nnext thing kids don't want\nis to feel like they have to fix it or\nthat they are to blame\nso if you arrive at wholeness\nwithout giving your kids this your kids\nare going to be\nokay now is it what they desire no but\nare they going to be traumatized\nno i mean i've done this in a way that\nhas kept me whole\nand my kid whole to a certain degree and\nthen i can teach my kid\nthe only reason you're feeling broken is\nbecause culture tells you you're broken\nyou're not broken\nthe family is reconfigured the family\nhas shape-shifted\nthat's a good thing that's a healthy\nmove towards our\ngreater selves how is this a bad thing\nso then i get an\nopportunity to teach her how culture has\npressurized us women to stay within\nthese\ninstitutions out of shame and we don't\nwant to live like that\nso it's a wonderful opportunity but the\nwoman has to come\ninto that realization of power yeah yeah\ni loved what you said there because\nin essence what you're saying is you can\nkeep your family together\nbut you're actually tearing your\nchildren apart yes right it's like\nbecause you're passing on that trauma\nright\nand that trauma of keeping a family\ntogether\nyes can actually create more trauma ext\nbut that's the thing right it's like\na lot of people would hear that and\nthey'll say okay dr shivali i won't\ni won't let my kid know that i'm yes i'm\nfeeling anything\nyes because they won't see it but kids\ndo see that they can tell\nright but i tell women who are really on\nthe fence\nthat it's not the time right this is not\nabout feeling the slightest unhappiness\nand bolting\nthis is not about blaming the other\nperson\nthis is about truly understanding our\nown co-creation in this\nif you bash the other person that breaks\nyour kid\nwhether you're in a marriage or you're\nnot in a marriage if you\nact in brokenness either hidden or\nexplicit that breaks your kid\nso when women are trying to negotiate\nand barter you know i can handle it\nthat means they're not ready so that\nmeans\nthey need to sit in the stew longer you\nknow i stayed in it for a long time\nthere's no rush this is about the\nevolution of the authentic self\nthere's no timeline it doesn't look a\ncertain way and it's\nnever about the other person this is\nsomething i really need people to\nunderstand\nas they radically awaken that they need\nto take ownership\nfor their co-creation because then\nthis is like what gandhi did in india he\ntold\nindians to take ownership of their own\npower make your own clothes\nmake your own sugar and salt don't rely\non the british empire\nthat's how he emboldened the vanquished\nto stand up so the oppressed can never\nblame the oppressor there is no such\nthing at the end of the day there's\nphysical oppression\nbut all mental oppression has to be\nlooked at\nby the one who is feeling mentally\noppressed so women need to first\nask themselves am i still blaming the\nother if they are\nit's not the time to divorce wow because\nthey're going to carry that\nvictimhood into the next relationship\nwhen they can stand\non their own two feet of looking at\ntheir own co-creation\nnow they've healed themselves now they\ncan leave\nso i tell women no no where are you\ngoing now of course if there's extreme\nabuse\nthey must leave yeah but if it's mental\nabuse\nthey need to see how they are\nco-creating the dance right\nheal it own it then leave the empathy\nwith which you're\ncoming across that perspective of it's\nnot just like oh this is the end and it\nhas to stop here and\nyou know i and the idea of not blaming\nrequires a lot of\ngrowth because that's such a natural\ntendency for all of us when we've been\nwronged or mistreated\ni find though that sometimes what\nhappens is\nmen will also move on faster yeah and\nagain i find that and i'm only speaking\non behalf of friends i know and\npeople in my life that have experienced\nthis i'm not saying this for all women\ni'm just saying it for people i know\nthey will then again feel that they are\nnot lovable\nand that they are not beautiful or\nworthy or enough\nyeah so let's talk about that yeah so\nyou're right typically\nmen move on but women have to understand\nthat men are more compartmentalized\nthey are more logical and linear and not\nin touch with the interconnections of\nall their psychological complexities\nlike we women are\nso when men move on that has no bearing\non you\nwho's left behind that's just the man\nwho's continuing on his\ncompartmentalized ways which is probably\nwhy you wanted to leave in the first\nplace\nyou know but at the bottom of it all\nis that we are still seeking something\nfrom our partner\nand what we're seeking is that love and\nworth\nwe are hungry for love and worth and\nthis is the bottom of the bottom right\nand and i call it the pill that kills\nand the pill that kills is our\nunworthiness\nso all of our relationships the intimate\nones the friendships\nthe parenting processes all hold a\nmirror to how unworthy do\ni feel and that's what this whole\njourney of life is about\nat the end of the day take away the\nbotox take away the bentley take away\nthe fancy education\nit's about am i worthy we've been\nlooking for worth\nthrough the marriage through the shoes\nthrough the degrees\nthrough the books or whatever and as\nlong as you look for worth\nin the wrong places you haven't come to\nthe evolution of your authentic self\nso so not blaming the other is just part\nof that\nreleasing of the external release the\nshoes release the makeup release the\nuh the success the achievement the\naccolades now who am i\non my own that's what women need to\narrive at who am i\nwithout my roles who am i without my\nroles\nyes yeah that is such a big question\nbecause\ni feel like for everyone on the planet\nwe all define ourselves by our roles and\none of the things i love about that you\ndo in the book\nis you have this whole section called\ncracking the matrix and\nyou list about and i'm just going to\nshare this with everyone you list\nall the different lies that women are\ntaught\nand so here you have met multiple\nchapters lies about love\nlies about marriage and divorce lies\nabout our sexuality\nlies about motherhood lies about beauty\nand youth\nand lies about niceness i wanted to go\nthrough some of the lies because i think\nthat\nit's fascinating because i think half\nthe thing is being\naware of the lie yeah and most people\ndon't even know that they're being lied\nto\nexactly so when it comes to i would love\nto hear let's start with lies about\nbeauty and youth\noh my goodness because it's the biggest\ni feel that's one that\nour generation my generation the\nsocial media instagram generation\nexperiences the most\nwhat are the lies about beauty and youth\nthat we need to be beautiful in a\nparticular way\nand we need to be eternally young and\nlet me tell you\nculture has done a number on us but who\ndoes a number more on ourselves\nthan ourselves we\nexcoriate ourselves we like whip\nourselves like you don't know\nwhat we women do when we look in the\nmirror you have no idea\ni agree i definitely do yeah you just\nshow up\n[Laughter]\nand the things that go on in the\ndressing room\nthat is the female side of the greek you\nknow on the stage\nlike in our talks you should see what's\nhappening in the female side\nnow who's doing that to us right we have\ndone this to ourselves\nand i get it because it was done to us\nwe were looked and we are objects of\ngreat beauty and desire\nbut we don't want to be objectified and\nnow we've internalized the\nobjectification\nyou know so what was our nature you know\nall females\nare the ones that the males run after in\nthe animal kingdom\nright because the males want to spread\ntheir sperm\npart of nature it's part of our biology\nbut what culture has done to us now is\nthat it's\ntold us we can only be desirable if we\nlook a certain way and it is a whitified\nstandard of beauty it's changing now but\nfor the most part when\nyou and i were growing up you know in\nindia the\nmost famous cream was called fair and\nlovely\nfair meaning white okay like they use\nthe word fair for white\nso it's so heavily laden with whitism\nand patriarchy that we women are now\noppressed by this idea of beauty\nso how do we break out of it right\nit takes all of us to not wear makeup it\ntakes all of us\nand we're not only now wearing makeup i\nmean makeup is the most mild thing we do\nnow we're altering our faces we're\ndisguising our buttocks we're\nyou know taking the saggy jaw we are out\nof control\n20 year olds are going to botox clinics\nso now with\nevery passing decade the standards are\nbecoming more\nanimatronics you know more perfect and\ntweaked\nand curated and the the more the\ntechnology the more the subjugation\nso we women have to rise together and\nall of us have to agree because that one\nwoman who ruins it for us you know like\nwe've all decided to wear jeans and then\nshe wears her\nstilettos now she messes it up for the\nrest of us right we\nwent for the school drop-off in pajamas\nbut then that woman wears her you know\nhair all made up now she makes us\nfeel bad because we feel bad we\nwomen now compete with each other and\neach time we compete with each other and\nup the other oh you just got your\nbreasts i'm gonna get my\nbutt and then i'm gonna get my underarm\nand then i'm gonna get my ears\neach time we do that we don't realize\nnot only do we not stand together as\nsisters\nwe genuflect on our knees to the\npatriarchy\nwe've given you men so much power by\ncompeting with each other\nyou know we need to make men in general\nand i talk heterosexual\nused to the idea that we are going to\ngrow old we have wrinkles\nwe sag and we're not perfect the more we\nfeed into the idea of perfection we feed\ninto patriarchy\nbecause who suffers in front of the\nmirror we do\nwho gains you do the men do\nso in our own way by oppressing\nourselves\nunder insane ideas of perfectionism\nwe give our power to the patriarchy that\nwe complain about\nbut listen it takes a lot of courage i'm\ntalking a lot but i wanted to make sure\nmy hair was okay\ni wanted to make sure i looked all you\nknow fabulous\nso i fall into it myself i'm not going\nto pretend i am not falling into it\ni'm going to watch it though i'm going\nto watch\nhow far i go i have ideas about like oh\ni can wipe away all my wrinkles let's do\nit\nbut i watch it i don't i don't indulge\nin it\ni watch how that voice is my internal\noppressor\nand then i talk to that voice and i go\nno a few wrinkles is good it's good\nyou are growing old why do you want to\nlook like a 20 year old\nshefali you're approaching 50. accept it\nso i have a dialogue\ni want women to engage in that dialogue\nand not\nrush to mutate themselves because when\nthey do that\nthey deny who they are right here right\nnow\ni am a 50 year old woman i'm not ashamed\nto say it\ni don't want to fake it anymore so when\nwe women can\nit's not easy okay now i just said i'm\n50 now i'm like oh\nbut you know but you have we have to do\nthat so that we don't pretend\nyeah i don't want other women to look at\nme thinking oh\nwow wow she looks so young no i don't\nlook young\ni have wrinkles all over the place\ncellulite all over the place i'm going\nto say it on on your podcast because i\nwant women to embrace\nall the sagginess and stop making\nyourself perfect\nfor men or for your partner nobody\ndeserves\nperfectionism because that's an ideal\nit's an illusion\nyou're faking it so don't give it don't\npretend you can even give it\nit's not something to be given and no\none deserves it anyway yeah\nthat's beautiful thank you again and i\nappreciate you just no but i i know what\nyou're saying you're not telling people\ndo not dress up or not look nice that's\nnot what you're saying you're just\nsaying\nthat if you're not observing where it's\ncoming from and why\nyou're doing it yes what the intention\nis and who is it serving\nyes ultimately and how much and how much\nyeah how much\nyeah i mean what there's no end there's\nthe knee there's the mid thigh yeah i\nmean you've seen women yeah\nit's like now we are buying product to\nmake ourselves\nsomething other than who we were\nnaturally\nand by doing that again we disconnect\nand we actually feel more insecure we\nthink it's going to\nah that nice butt is going to make me\nsecure it doesn't\nit doesn't yeah because it's an it's a\nvoid of\nunworthiness that can never be filled by\ninjections\nor by people that was so powerful that\nwas beautiful i mean that's just one of\nthe lies\nthat we dived into that was so powerful\ntell me about the lies about niceness\nbecause i think that's one that a lot of\nwomen are struggling with right now in\nthe workplace\nuh even on camera and interviews i know\nthere's been a lot of\ninterviews that i've been going seeing\nviral old hollywood interviews\nwhere celebrity actresses were\nmistreated yes on talk shows yes\nbut they continue to be nice oh my\ngoodness uh to the man who is\nmistreating them right and you can see\nthem squirming yes\nyes but she can't see him she can't say\nanything she can't stop him she\nbecause it's his show yeah right so we\ngirls\nhave been raised subliminally\nsubconsciously to understand\nit's the man's show i remember going to\nthe dentist when i was in\nindia and the man literally kissed me\ninappropriately touched me but i was\nlike it's his office\ni didn't say it i didn't say a word of\nprotest because it was his show\nso we are raised as young girls to let\nmen have their show let the show go on\nand you just be quiet\nand that's the myth about niceness and\nboys don't have that\nboys are encouraged to be rambunctious\nand oh you know he's so naughty and\nlet him talk you know he's a boy so boys\nget away with it i'm not saying you get\naway with\nall of it but you get away with way more\nthan us girls somebody's will be boys\nboys will be boys girls have to be nice\nquiet kind\nobedient polite right we have to sit\nwith our legs really tight and\nwe have to do this and we have so many\nprescriptions\nso what does that do that teaches us\nthat\nif something is being done that is\nviolating us our boundary\nor our emotional health we are trained\nto be nice\ndespite that like our first antenna\nis how can i be nice how can they see me\nas a nice person\nto so to be seen as the [ __ ] right and\ni'm not encouraging that we should be\ncalled the [ __ ] but to be seen as that\nis the curse is the anathema we don't\nwant to be seen like that\nso in my own personal journey i had to\nbecome comfortable\nbeing called the [ __ ] and then i\nrealized oh i'm only called the [ __ ]\nwhen i'm not being nice\nwhen i'm nice no one calls me the [ __ ]\nso i had to go through this process of\nbecoming comfortable\nbreaking the barrier of being nice or\nbeing seen as nice\nso we've been told that niceness will\nget us love we'll get our security will\nget us belonging will get us worth\nit's a lie the more nice you are and\navoid conflict avoid the deny you know\nyou deny that you're being violated\nat the end of many years of being nice\nyou actually die\nin your spirit you know yeah you were\nnice but now what\nyou're dead in your spirit and women\nonly feel like that\nafter the children are raised after\nthey've checked off all the lists now\nthey're like\ni was nice well what did i get for\nmyself\nso that's a tragedy if we live our whole\nlife being nice but not being authentic\ni love that these are beautiful i hope\neveryone who's listening and watching is\nhearing this and and just realizing how\nmuch of this is so deeply ingrained\ni know i'm listening to it and i i catch\nmyself doing it all the time i think\nfor me because i was raised primarily by\nmy mom\nand and i have a younger sister i was\nexposed to their experience\nof this as much as i could be without\nbeing a woman myself\nuh and and i think that made me hyper\naware\nand it took me it takes me even now i\ncatch myself\nnaturally having male privilege without\nnoticing it right like you don't notice\nthese things i remember\nit was a few years ago now when i first\nrealized i was like oh wait a minute if\nmy\nsister wanted to be a soccer player she\ncould never even have dreamt of it\nbecause there were no female soccer\nplayers like\neven something as basic as that that is\nso basic right\nbut when you take that to the depths of\nwhat we're speaking about here\nwe're talking about the opportunity to\nbe yourself\nforget about an opportunity to be a\nsoccer player or\na career you're talking about the\nopportunity to actually be your true\nself\nyeah i mean that's so far because we\nhave to first feel safe\nyeah you know the other day uh three of\nmy girlfriends were in\nan elevator and a male came inside the\nelevator\nand he just came in so casually\nsauntered it and sauntered out\nthat's male privilege if a woman came\ninto an elevator with three men\nshe'd be really nervous she'd be waiting\nfor the elevator doors to open or for\nsome woman to walk in with her\nwe are constantly scanning our\nenvironment we grow up in constant\nthreat\nof predation this is just the way it is\nhowever\nbesides that physiological threat we\nhave mental oppression\nof all these lies that we've been told\nof how to be and to be in service\nyou know and we want to be in service\nwomen naturally are nurturing\nbut we don't want to be in service of\nothers to the obliteration of ourselves\nyeah absolutely of course i want to\nask you this last question shafari\nbefore we switch to our final five\nyour last chapter is called embracing\nemptiness\ni love that because i think that what\nyou do so well is\nyou don't paint like a rosy picture of\nstuff like you never have since we've\nmet even in your\npersonal dealings like you're not a\nyou're not a\nrosy picture painter kind of like oh\nthis is how perfect evolution looks or\nthis is how perfect a radical awakening\neven the word radical right it's not\nbeautiful in the external sense of what\nwe think of as beauty\nwhen you end a book with a chapter\ncalled embracing emptiness\ni'm like wow like that that's a real\nchallenging statement yeah\ntell us about how one needs to and why\nand how one\nembraces emptiness yes so you and i have\nreally\nembodied to many aspects um\nthe eastern principles of de-identifying\nfrom the external right so every\nspiritual quest\nat its core is about teaching us\nthat our masks of our false self\nbring us great suffering why because\nwe think that's who we are so we\nthink we are dr shefali or jay shetty\nthe podcaster or the\nfancy author or we think we are that\nand we identify with that so the woman\nmay identify as being young or the\nmother or the\ngood one or the peacemaker\nwhen we identify with anything that is a\nrole to the external world\nwe have unendurable suffering because\nwhen that role is taken away then we are\nleft with who am\ni so buddhism in particular and i don't\nlike to call it buddhism because it has\nan ism\nbut what the buddha taught in essence\nwas to detach from these external\nidentifications\nand when you do you discover that you\nare limitless you are space you are\nenergy you are the i am and the we are\nand that we are all interconnected so if\nyou\nand me and him and her\nare all causing and affecting each other\nwe're all cause and effects of each\nother\nthen there is no autonomous me so the\nego dissolves\nright so once we have this panned out\nperspective\nthat we're all interconnected there is\nno i\nas in a solid ego therefore there is no\nj sherry or dr shivali\nyou begin to realize the myth of it all\nand the illusion of it all\nand then you begin to let go and\nuntether\nand strangely as you untether you become\nmore connected\nbecause you see that you and me are one\nand we're all mirrors of each other so\nif i hurt you i will hurt myself\nso this is the eternal spiritual quest\nto\nbecome empty of the ego to arrive at the\nemptiness of the individual ego and\nsurrender to the cosmic connectedness\nthat we are i love that description\nthat's so beautiful that and the the\nfact that this book\ngoes from our complete\none hour but women's suppression and\ncontrol\nto that spiritual evolution i mean\nthat's beautiful that's phenomenal that\nyou're able to\nguide someone and i've come to your\nevents where\ni was blown away i went to one of your\nevents in new york probably about five\nyears ago\nand there were people that came on stage\nto share\ntheir journey with you and it was\nunbelievable to hear people just like\ntalk about how you had privately helped\nthem either through your practice\nor through your books and your work and\ni can't wait for this book to help so\nmany more people it's gonna be\nphenomenal and uh i highly recommend a\nradical awakening to absolutely everyone\nwe're gonna put the link\nin the comments so i want you to order\nthis while you've been listening to this\npodcast\nuh we are gonna ask dr shafali her final\nfive\nbut please at this moment go and put in\nyour order for the book\nuh i promise you you won't regret it i'm\nsure it's gonna be\nsomething that's really really going to\nsupport you i loved what dr shivali said\nthat she's created a\nstep-to-step guide through the tunnel\nand that's where we need it most right\nthat's where you need it most the real\nhand-holding\nuh so dr sivali i have your final five\nthat i want to ask you\nthese questions have to be answered in\none word or\nfive to seven words maximum so like a\nsentence uh so these are your final five\nthe first question is what's the best\nadvice you've ever received\nto be free is the greatest gift\nlove it what's the worst advice you've\never received\nbe nice be polite be sweet\ngood uh question number three what's\nsomething that men just don't\nthat men can't be fully empathetic or\ncompassionate for towards women\nwhat can we not understand about a\nwoman's experience\napart from giving birth and stuff\nobviously yeah\nyou can't maybe understand how oppressed\nwe\nare by male desire\nby standards of beauty and how that's\noppressive actually and\nwe need your help to tell us like don't\nwear makeup or don't wear those high\nheels we need you\nto not encourage um our psychosis\nyeah so yeah that's a role we need to\nplay it's so funny because every time i\nsee my wife not wearing makeup i always\ntell her how cute she looks\nnot out of i'm not even conscious i just\nthink she's adorable yeah\nbut it's it's so funny because she's\nalways like well you think i look cute\nlike this i'm like yeah i do like you\nlook great like but\nit's that's how deeply rooted it is that\nthat you don't even think you can look\ngood without\nbeing dressed up and ready uh fourth\nquestion what's your biggest lesson from\nthe last 12 months\nthat there is no future\ni think these last 12 months being the\npandemic has taught us\nlive in the present there is no future\nyou know\nyeah and fifth and final question if you\ncould create one law\nthat everyone had to follow in the world\nwhat would it be\ni think my law would be you can't have\nchildren\nuntil you do some serious serious\ninner work wow and yeah if you're too\nold yeah\nyou can't have children you adopt\nwow that is a challenging law but but i\nknow what you're saying that\nyou're saying that that responsibility\nrequires certain\nuh skills and abilities and qualities i\nmean if there's no qualification for it\ni think it was it was adam grant\nactually adam grant posted this\nreset study the other day and it was\nshowing like how much experience is\nneeded to get a job at walmart to get a\njob at this\nand then to be a parent it was like and\nnow you have created the next generation\nand you don't know what to do with them\nand you pass\ndown your brokenness i mean the reason\nwe are in the state we are\nis because of broken parents yeah\neveryone who's been watching
