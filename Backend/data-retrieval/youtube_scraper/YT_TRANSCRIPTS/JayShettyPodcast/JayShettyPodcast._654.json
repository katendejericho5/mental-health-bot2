    "transcript": "i'll i share a picture of us i don't\ncare how many likes it gets\nif people like it that's fantastic i\nhope instagram gets rid of the likes\nyou know like we just do it because we\nlove it\nwe want it it comes from our soul comes\nfrom our hearts and our desire to share\nwhat comes through us\nnot because it fills a void\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\ni'm so grateful\nand appreciative of the fact that you\ntake out time out of your days\nevery single week to learn to listen to\ngrow\nand to focus on self work and love in\nyour life and you know that i'm\ncommitted\nto finding and bringing you the guests\nthat i believe are living a life\non purpose that are doing things with a\nheart of service\nand wanting to have a meaningful impact\nin the world\nand today's guest i can truly say is\nsomeone who's dedicated\nto that vision and that mission he's a\ndirector\nactor producer and entrepreneur and is\nfocused on creating a service based life\nthrough entertainment\nand media he stars in the award-winning\njane the virgin\nwhich many of you have probably seen or\nheard of and been fans and followers of\nand also he's the founder of wayfarer\nentertainment he's an\nincredible human being who i connected\nwith probably about a couple of years\nago\nbut we've been trying to make this\nhappen so for me this is a huge moment\ni'm so grateful to have with me justin\nbaldoni justin thank you for being here\ni appreciate you so much man no i mean\ni'm really happy to be here\nof all the things that uh that come my\nway this was one that i was like this\nhas to\nthis has to happen because i appreciate\nthe\nthe on purpose aspect of everything that\nyou do\nand uh it's like you know this is it\nthis is why we do it\nright this is why we do everything so\nthank you man no thank you man that\nmeans a lot coming from you definitely\nand i want to dive into so many areas of\nyour life today\nand i want you to start with what you\njust said now like when did you get to\nthat point\nwhere you realized everything was about\nservice and on purpose\nand how did you get there i don't think\ni'm there\ni think that's one of the things we'll\nprobably uncover is i don't think we\never really get there\ni think that there have been moments in\nmy life\nthat were both caused by me\nuh uh making\npoor decisions that led me to a path of\nhaving no choice but to realize that\nthis life is not about me and then there\nwere things that happened that were just\ncompletely\ncompletely out of my control but i don't\nknow if we ever get to a place where\nwe realize that life's just about\nservice because that's just not the way\nthat the ego works and\nthe way that our brains are built to\nwork so i feel like i'm\nevery morning i wake up some days i get\nit\nand there's some days that i don't and\nthe days that i don't it's about\nthen making sure i wake up the next\nmorning and seeing if i can get it\nand i think that's just the journey that\nis life right it's just\nno i don't think we ever arrived maybe\nyou have arrived if anybody maybe you\nhave\nuh but i definitely have not um\nso yeah man i think that it was a\ncombination of a lot of things so i'm\nwith you i've not arrived either i\ncompletely agree with that i think you\nhave to\nwe have showers every day because we get\ndirty we have to brush our teeth every\nday because they get dirty we have to\neat every day because\nwe get hungry and so we have to feed our\nsouls and minds and\nconsciousness every day too in the same\nway in my faith there's a\nthere's a quote that says uh at the end\nof each day we have to take ourselves\ninto account\num and we have to look at all the things\nthat we did that would be pleasing\nto god and then ask for strength to do\nbetter\nand then look at the things that we did\nthat day that were about us and maybe\nwould be displeasing\nand ask for the strength to do better\nright\num so we want to repeat the things that\nwe did well but we want\nto do better and you know improve on the\nprevious day and that's it\nlittle by little day by day it's what\nwe're told yeah so you know and both of\nthose things that you said there are so\nimportant because you have to know what\nyou're doing well too\nright you've got to repeat those again\nand make them happen again in your life\nand that can't happen if we don't\nreflect\nand if you don't actually think about\nlike i love the idea of\ntaking things into account baha'i by the\nway and yes yes and uh so this idea of\nlike taking ourselves into account the\nactual quote is\nthat take ourselves into a account um\nas one day will be summoned to a\nreckoning\nright or now it's art summoned to our\nreckoning this idea of like we're gonna\nhave to\nlike look at our lives and all the\nthings that we've done\nand all the decisions that we've made\nwhether they be for us or for somebody\nelse the pain that we've caused\nand one day we will have to we'll have a\nreckoning with all of those things\nso by taking ourselves into account\nevery day right little by little\nwe're like we're kind of like uh\nbeing proactive in that process and not\nwaiting until the day we're standing\nunder\nyou know before our creator and having\ndo the same thing so uh\nso yeah man so then you mix in our\nbusiness and this industry and\nand all the interesting things that come\nwith it and you're like you know\nit's a battle every single day which is\nwhy i say i'm still trying to figure it\nout\nand work on it just like everybody else\nyeah but that's what fascinates me so\nmuch and what i love about what you do\nis that you're able to be in an industry\nthat's seen a certain way that may\nfunction a certain way but you're able\nto bring that soul to it\nand you're working hard to bring that\nservice element to it and that's when i\nfirst reached out to you and i kind of\nwant to go back there because\ni think you've done so many interesting\nthings in your career and your journey\nand and i'm sure many people already\nknow about some of them but even if they\ndon't i want to highlight them and\nunpack those stories with you\nbut when i reached out to you i saw you\nhad given this ted talk\nabout being man enough and and i looked\nand i was just like wow here's a guy's\nlike\nyou know from the perspective you were\ntalking about it like you've been an\nactor asked to play\nvery alpha male roles and then you're\nlooking and reflecting and taking into\naccount\nyeah and and you're noticing and you're\nobserving that like oh wait a minute\nthis isn't me\nlike i've almost been pretending to play\nroles and be someone that i'm not how\ndid you start\nunpacking that in that journey to get to\nthat talk first of all that talk was i\nthink i still have\nptsd from that talk in the sense that it\nwas one of the scariest things i've ever\ndone\nespecially at ted women like being in a\nroom with 1500 of some of the world's\nmost powerful women and then being a man\nand giving a talk that's like feminine\nfeminist adjacent\nright uh i and then also the ted stage\ntalk about self-doubt like what do i\nhave to offer the ted community\nright i'm an expert at nothing except\nmyself and even that i'm trying to\nyou know figure out um so i\nthat was a that was a hell of an\nexperience and my son was born eight\ndays or nine days before that\num and we were shooting jane and it was\njust this crazy time\nbut i think for me it was about\nlook you get to you get to hollywood\nand hollywood decides what they want you\nto be right suddenly i'm playing these\ncharacters and i'm auditioning for these\ncharacters\nthat couldn't be farther from the way\nthat i viewed myself\nand also uh these are characters i'm\nplaying the types of people that also\nmade my life very difficult when i was\nyounger and caused me a lot of pain\nuh so i realized early on i remember\ncalling\nmy first manager uh\nsent me an audition and like the title\nwas like uh super hot\nand i i i remember i called him and i\nwas like i don't i think you sent this\nto the wrong person i don't think you're\nlike i said well it just wasn't how i\nsaw myself and i was a bit of an ugly\nduckling and\ni had you know girls never really liked\nme and all the things grew at the wrong\ntimes and eyebrows weren't cool back\nthen and definitely not the big nose and\ni was super skinny and\nvery insecure and had acne and you name\nit like braces in high school\nand i was bullied a lot and i was picked\non a lot and i would compensate\num with overconfidence when i was\nyounger\nbut all those boys from the time when i\nwas\nin elementary school to even\ni still struggle with it today i always\nfelt like i wasn't included like i\nwasn't a part of\nthe group like i wasn't a man like i\nwasn't man enough right\nand then suddenly i found myself being\nlooked at\nfrom a superficial lens as one of those\nguys so i was inducted into the club\nbecause at some point in my early 20s i\ni finally like grew into myself maybe\nbut it was never comfortable so i\nremember early on in my\nacting career playing these roles but\nhaving no idea like\nhow i would talk or say things or walk\nor because even my\nwalk i was you know was made fun of at\none point by kids when i was in seventh\ngrade\nand these memories are burned into my\nsoul\num and you know so\nyou know i'm i'm playing like uh i'm\nplaying like a really cool frat guy at\n20 years old i\nhad no idea i wasn't invited to frat\nparties when it like i\nknow like how do you how did i do that\nhow do i do that and\nand i found more and more every time i\ngot a job i was it was like\nliving in conflict and then i realized\nthat i was actually living in conflict\noutside of the work\nbecause i would become a different man\nbased on who i was with\nso i would change my personality the way\nthat i carried myself the way that i\nwalked\nbased on the company that i was in i\nwould become a chameleon to be accepted\nto be liked\nand uh and all of those and then i\nnoticed my behavior with women as i was\ndating and\nrelationships and i just started to\nthink about all this stuff which\nunfortunately we don't often think about\nbecause\nthe world is built to distract us so in\nthinking about it i realized that i was\nhaving a\ninnate issue with my masculinity um\nit was much deeper than that but that\nwas at least a part of\nthe issue and then i saw a lot of other\nmen having a very similar issue\nand then the more i learned about\nfeminism and women's rights i realized\nthat that was also\na big contributor if not one of the main\ncontributors to the oppression\nin that certain way and uh and so i just\nstarted to like dig into it and learn\nand\ni i don't know how but you know ted\neventually asked me to come speak and\ni wanted to use my platform to talk\nabout it because i just felt like man if\nwe could get\nif we could get more men to open up and\nthink about this stuff and\nand go inside instead of projecting\noutside and\ni don't know maybe we'd have a different\nlooking world you know and that's just\nthe surface layer\nunderneath all of it i believe is there\nare spiritual issues that need to\nfundamentally change\nbut you can't change those things like\nwith the snap of your fingers so\ni chose masculinity as kind of like the\nsurface level\nthing for me to discuss and talk about\nand also because it was parallel to my\njourney\nplaying a character that was also kind\nof trapped and struggling with his\nmasculinity yeah absolutely and what\nhave been some of those\nchallenges it's so funny when i'm\nlistening to you there are so many\nthings in common\nuh that i've talked about before that\ni'm listening i'm just like wow like\ni was super bullied at when i was young\nbecause i was very overweight\nand so i really really yeah i was i was\nvery overweight and\nmy wife had the same thing so me and my\nwife even though we didn't know each\nother at that time but\nwe both grew up on that side of the\njourney and experience of how\nwe were bullied growing up so\ninteresting cause my wife and i were\nbullied for being skinny\noh wow it's a funny thing the policing\nis very interesting\nand we oftentimes forget that and it's\nin\nin my god god bless my wife but we were\nwatching um\nwe were watching a megan trainer song um\nall about that bass yeah because my\ndaughter is obsessed with that music\nvideo\nshe's four years old and everyone's\ndancing\nand she's and we're watching this video\nand she kind of\nand maya is liking it and you know and\nand some of the words are you know uh\nkind of not attacking but but\nprovocative for skinny girls kind of\nmaking skinny girls\npossibly feel bad for being skinny right\nand we don't realize there's a whole\nother\ngroup of women and men that are bullied\nfor looking a certain way and my wife\nhas a lot of trauma from growing up and\nyou know she couldn't put weight on if\nshe tried and so she's telling my\ndaughter things like\nyou know it's okay to be who you are and\nyou know what if you're skinny when you\ngrow up that's also beautiful\nand but also explaining that their\nbodies are beautiful and all of our\nbodies\nand it's so funny that like we don't\nthink about the the policing on both\nsides and where that comes from\nso but yeah but the result is the same\nthe result is like\na lot of insecurity in your 30s and your\n40s and your 50s you know\nthroughout your life yeah and i can\nrelate to the chameleon aspect too that\nyou're mentioning\ni can totally relate to that but we\ndon't often think about it right\nyou're like i've said it like i've\nrepeated it because i came\nto understand that fairly early when i\nchose to go and become a monk which was\nthe most random decision of\neveryone i grew up with yeah i want to\ntalk about it it was it was no we could\ntalk about another time not today but\n[Music]\nthis is like you but uh but the reason\ni'm bringing up is just i think\nas we're reflecting i'm hoping everyone\nwho's listening or watching right now i\nhope you're getting an opportunity to\nreflect maybe you have already maybe you\nhaven't\nbut if you're listening or watching\nright now the reason why i'm sharing\nwhen i'm listening to you\nis i've also played that when i was on\nred table talk recently and i know you\nwere too and\naren't they wonderful they're wonderful\nthey're amazing yeah the whole family is\njust\nbeautiful and incredible and and i was\ntalking about this i was talking about\nhow like i was switching my\npersonalities\nto appeal to women and appeal to the\nopposite sex i would switch who i was of\ncourse\nso that a certain type of person would\nlike me where have you found what have\nyou found from giving that ted talk\ndoing that research\ndoing that work up to that point in your\nlife what did you find out about\nidentity\nand on that deeper spiritual level i'd\nlove to hear that from you\ni love how you said that you were not\nusing but engaging a viewpoint around\nsomething more surface level to talk\nabout something deeper\nwell i think all of our issues are\ninherently spiritual\nbut um we can't you can't snap your\nfingers and fix a spiritual problem\num unless people are willing to go\nthere and as you know having been a monk\nand\nme you know every day waking up and\nstruggling\nthe the inherent the connection that an\nindividual has with their creator\ngod the universe i mean even god is a\nbuzzword now for people\nlike god is triggering to people which\nis a bizarre thing like\npeople are so anti-religion now that\nthat and because they've had such\nterrible experiences um in whether it be\ntheir churches or\nyou know with various groups that people\nare very\nhesitant to even talk about god so now\nwe're using words like the universe\nright who created the universe i don't\nknow something did\nso i used the word god but it's so hard\nto\ntackle a spiritual issue when we're not\nrealizing we're actually spiritual\nbeings having a physical experience um\nso that's why choosing you know that's\nby being look so it's social justice\nit's all of these things they're all\ninterconnected if you strip it all down\nright whatever the problem that's\nplaguing the world\nit all comes down to spirituality and\nthe way we view each other is\nother or the way that our ego takes over\nor our drive for power\nmoney or success and our for and\ncompletely forgetting\nthat we are here really to serve each\nother\nand to be of service to our creator\nthe universe god whatever whoever you\nwant to um\ncall it uh so some of the things i've\nlearned\ni've learned that i don't know anything\ni am\nyou know after the ted talk i found it\nreally interesting because we were\ntalking about this outside\ni never planned on\nbeing a public spokesperson for anything\nlike i'm not a thought leader\nright i'm not someone who's going to\nlike change my instagram bio and call\nmyself a thought leader\nand like make that my world um i\nactually\ninherently kind of i'm a little allergic\nto that phrase right\ni'm not a leader in anything i was a guy\nwith an idea that started talking about\nthe things i cared about\nbecause of the way social media works\npeople then attach certain labels to me\nbecause also the way the industry works\nthen it becomes a little pavlovian on my\npart or your part you start to do more\nof that thing\nbut inherently i kept it as pure as i\ncould and then suddenly you're asked to\ngive more thoughts and more opinions and\nthen\nyou're on the ted stage and you don't\nknow what the hell you're doing there\nthat's my journey\nbut afterwards what ended up happening\nwas i didn't expect there to be so much\nnegativity\nand i didn't realize how polarizing uh\nthe masculinity issue was and how\n[Music]\ninterconnected it was with the political\nclimate\nand the culture divide that's happening\nin our\ncountry and around the world right um\nas an example feminism is now a\nweaponized word\nand if you're considered a feminist then\nthen people\nassume they know your political ideology\num the same thing with masculinity right\nyou're a liberal snowflake you're this\nyou're this and i found myself getting\nvery attacked and i am not good with\nthat\nbecause of how i was\nhow i was treated as a young boy there's\na lot of open wounds there\nthat i've been working on healing for a\nlong long time so as we were talking\nabout out there\ni could have a million people tell me\namazing things\nbut i could have one guy tell me\nsomething with just\nkeyboard courage with some anonymous\nname\nthat i happen to read on accident and my\nday is ruined\nit doesn't matter how enlightened or or\nor prayerful i am there's a part that\nhasn't healed from being that kid that\nof course i will eventually hopefully\nget to a\na better place but none of us have been\ntrained to really know what to do with\nsocial media this way\nso i found myself having a lot of\ninteresting reactions to the talk\nbeing loved and supported by women\ngetting tons of texts from women when it\ncame out\nvery famous women women that i hadn't\nseen in 10 years 20 years\na few men uh i was\nbeing yeah right you were one of them\nbeing promoted on all these\nfemale-facing\nmagazines and websites and things and\nthen the male reaction was really\nnegative\nand i was confused because it ended up\nperpetuating the same\nissue which was this feeling like i\nam not good enough for my own gender\nwhich happened as a boy and now here i\nam talking to men\nas a man because at the end of the day\ni'm an athlete i'm a dude i work out i\nlove like i love\nsome of the aspects of masculinity i i'm\na sports fan i'm like you know all of it\nbut i also want a sensitive and i'm an\nemotional person and all i'm saying is\nthat you can be both and maybe we can\nuse\nall of those aspects of masculinity that\nmake us strong men\nto explore the hidden inner parts of\nourselves to become more full humans\nand and the response was like was\nterrible\ni didn't realize that yeah it was i\nreally didn't realize that and i got\nreally sad and i didn't understand\nand i realized that without knowing it i\nhad used certain words\nthat sensational media has weaponized\nfor a political agenda like toxic\nright not saying toxic masculinity\ndoesn't exist\nbut that word now if i say it\na large part of the population will not\nlisten to what i have to say even though\ni'm not\nusing it in a politicized world i'm\nsaying the aspects of masculinity\nthat encourage policing and bullying\nthat encourage us to change our\npersonalities maybe to treat women\npoorly\nthose things are toxic and by toxic i\nmean they're bad for you in the same way\nthat\nlike a harmful chemical causes cancer\nright that's all it is but that word can\nbe weaponized\nand then we're living in a very\nsensitive time where\nthings are very polarizing and we are in\nthe middle of this culture\nwar um and i found myself in the middle\nof that and i realized that man i should\nhave done a little more research because\nthe men that i actually want to reach\nthe men that i want to talk to the most\nare the men who are rejecting the\nmessage\nand then i was in an echo chamber i was\nin a silo i was talking to the people\nthat already\nbelieved in it um so that was a that was\nsomething that i learned\nthat's beautiful now with my work around\nmasculinity and man enough\num i'm i'm changing a little bit of the\nway that i talk about it\nbecause women don't need to hear what i\nhave to say\nthe women are doing the work themselves\nmy work is with men as a man\nhealing also some of the things that\nhave happened to me and that i've been\nworking through\nand hoping that that by displaying\nvulnerability and by talking about\nthings that are hard to talk about that\nyou and i have been through\nthat it gives other men permission to do\nthe same because at the end of the day\nmen are killing themselves at a higher\nrate than women men\nare are dying of heart disease and\ncancer\nmore than women we are we isolate\nourselves\nwe clearly cause a lot more wars and do\nour doing a lot more damage\nand i just feel like there is a lot of\nopportunity for healing\nand that's at its core what it's about\nit's about healing yeah\nabsolutely man you've said that so well\nand when i saw it\nand when i'm reflecting on it now\nhearing from you for me it was just\nreally clear that you were speaking\nabout something that was around\npersonal growth personal healing\npersonal transformation from the\nperspective of\nhey have you had a look at yourself in a\nwhile are there parts of you that\nyou would like to change are there parts\nof you that you haven't explored are\nthere parts of you that you've forgotten\neven exist\nthere you know i are you really being\nthe person you want to be are you\nwe haven't been trained to do that\nabsolutely no we haven't at all nobody's\ntaught\nus that absolutely our fathers didn't\nteach us to like\nlook at ourselves and observe our\nbehavior we didn't learn that stuff the\nmovies are not teaching us that no the\nmagazines are not teaching us that what\nare they teaching us\nhow to get the girl how to make your\nbody look good so you can\nget the girl and we don't even think\nabout that language what does get the\ngirl mean\nnow we're already thinking about women\nas a possession getting a thing\nan object so without even realizing it\nwe're like brainwashed to think a\ncertain way\nyeah you know versus attracting a\npartner or a mate\num it's just it's not in our programming\nwe've been socialized\nand women have been socialized to\nrespond as well i mean there's two sides\nto this equation\nwhich is why we both and i've noticed\nthis had to change our behavior\naround various groups especially women\nto become the man we think they want us\nto be\ninstead of being just who we are yeah we\nwere born to be and who were born with\nfull of [ __ ] and baggage as we are\nyeah absolutely and i think what i took\nfrom it was just that encouragement to\npeople to\nunpack your own bags you know like we've\nall got to do that healing ourselves\nno one's going to do it for you like no\none's going to walk into your life and\nfix you\nand and it's great anyway but i i just\nwanted to say that i personally\nthought what you did was awesome i\npersonally think hearing from you today\nas well and i'm hoping everyone who's\nlistening and watching\nis taking that in from a point of\nself-reflection like that's what i'm\nlearning from this it's like let's look\nat ourselves\nin the mirror and not look at our bodies\nin the mirror just that let's look at\nthat inside in the mirror and go\nokay what do i like what do i want to\nwork on where do i want to grow am i\nhappy with this\nam i pleased with who i am absolutely we\nall have that feeling\nyou know this feeling when you're in\nlike a social setting\nand you say something or you interact\nwith somebody and then you leave that\nperson\nand you're like oh my god i was such an\nidiot yeah or why did i say that thing\nall of us have it they're like people\nare like they're in the room\nand i was like yeah it's good yeah but\nnobody but nobody talks about it\nright yeah the thing is we all have it\nbecause\nall of us are trying to like figure out\nwho we are\nand if we just and if you and if you\nhave that moment and you're like wait\nwhy did i say that thing that wasn't me\nright what was i trying to prove\nwhy did i change my that little\nlike self-awareness can take you on a\ndeep deep journey into like\ni don't want to say enlightenment but\ninto uh\nthat self-reflection and awareness and\nyou can't start to change something\nunless you\nrealize that it exists in the first\nplace and you come to terms with it so\nabsolutely anyways yeah and it's both\nthose things it's looking back and going\nlike\nwhat how how did i say that to that\nperson and then looking at what we say\nto ourselves too\nyeah it's like reflecting at the the\nvoice in our heads and going like wait a\nminute did i say that to myself like is\nthat how i'm talking to myself now\nyeah and then if you say oh i'm such an\nidiot yeah what is that like then now\nclearly that's how we're treating\nourselves you know it's funny my wife\noften times says to me\nstop treating my husband like that yeah\nright yeah like this like this beautiful\nthat's awesome i love that like she's\nlike\nhey be nice to my husband\nright that's because she sees me do that\nto myself like that\nbecause i can take the self-reflection\nand then i can go too far and then she's\nlike hey\nright and then now it's fun because i\nget back to her all the time yeah\nbecause we're all doing that to\nourselves right\nthat's what marriage is at its core and\nwe can talk about marriage yeah yeah go\nfor it\nmarriage is two people coming together\nand putting all their [ __ ] on the front\nlawn and having that be the fertilizer\nfor their new home yeah you know it's\nlike\nthat's what it is yeah 100 no i love\nthat and\nwhat's interesting is you know you've\ngone from obviously using your platform\nto spread a message but just recently\njust now you were saying that actually\nyou've been taking social media downtime\ntoo you've been taking breaks from\ntech yeah i'm just i'm just rea i just\ndon't think that we're\ni just don't think any of us realize\nalso the damage we're doing\nto ourselves you know it's funny i had a\nquestion for you go on\nyou are you're a king at social media\ni'm i look at i'm i marvel\nat what you've been able to do and what\nyou've been able to build\nespecially because you're doing it and\nit's all\nthe same it's all the same with the same\nintention i can tell i know you're\ni can feel intention only god knows\nintention but i have this thing where\ni'm allergic to like self-help gurus and\nlike\ni can i just ha it's like it's like no\nno but like there's like a\nthere's a thing because i because\nwe're all flawed right and it's so easy\nto\nput ourselves on a pedestal and it's so\neasy to then suddenly with the millions\nof people\nor the 20 or 30 or 40 people in a church\nor a congregation to start to think that\nthat's about us\nand not about what's coming through us\nso i\nand this is just me putting this on you\nbut i feel your purity and i\nand i sincerely thank you for that\nhowever\ni don't know how you do it because\nyou're creating so much content\non such a massive scale every single day\nand building businesses also for helping\npeople\nthat i look at you and i'm like how are\nyou able to\nto to like separate you as\nyour person from like this\nworld that hinges on commenting and\nliking and putting out content and\ni don't know how you do it um so first\nof all\ni would love for you uh because you knew\nat some point it was going to be\nflipped no i didn't i was i think i i'm\nonly\ni learned i'm not an expert on anything\ni'm not a\nguru or a self-help person i'm here to\nget help and to learn and all i do is\npass that on but i don't know how you do\nit\nbecause our brains are not wired for\nthis thing\nlike we haven't been wired for this um\nbut yet you're doing it in such a\nbeautiful and pure way which is why\nas i see your numbers rise and you get\nthis is the number one\nyou know podcast on itunes i have so\nmuch joy for you because i'm like oh my\ngod finally someone that i actually\nbelieve really cares is doing it but how\ndo you\nhow do you separate and like not go to\nbed at night thinking about\nthe post you're gonna have to do\ntomorrow like and the and the\ninteraction and the engagement that you\nhave to have like to get people to swipe\nup how do you do that so i think the\nfirst thing i'm going to say is i'm\ngrateful man thank you i really\nappreciate that coming from you like it\njust\nit was very hard it was very it's very\nheart-touching like i'm feeling the\nromance and the genuine like i'm just\nvery grateful to hear that from you like\nit means it means a lot because\nit's not been easy and it's a daily\npractice and the first thing i want to\nsay is i have an awesome team\nso that that is a huge part of it and\nas things grew i really understood that\ni couldn't do it on my own\nand that if i tried to do on my own then\nthat would get very difficult so i think\none of the biggest things was\nrecognizing i had to find people with\ngood energy\nfind people who didn't just want to do\nthis because they got paid to do it\nbut they were also doing it because this\nwas deeply connected to their mission in\nlife\nand it was helping them fulfill their\npurpose and that's what i've always said\nto everyone on my team it's like i want\nyou to be doing a role that feels\naligned with your purpose as much as\nit's aligned with mine because it's not\ngood enough for you to be here because\nyou get paid to be here like that's not\nand so i'm very fortunate to have an\namazing team that that is doing that\nso that i'm not having to think about\neverything all of the time so i think\nthat's one big thing but\nfor me i've had that daily practice for\na long time and i've talked about it\nbefore but i i call it seeds and weeds\nand that's my check-in system and that's\nthe check-in system from my\nvedic tradition hindu tradition of\nchecking\nthe seeds and weeds in my life so the\nway i take account\nis i ask myself at the end of every day\nat the end of every week or at the\nbeginning of a new venture or new\nbusiness or a new project\nand i ask myself am i doing this as a\nseed or a weed\nthe seed is a positive intention which\nis a pure intention\nand a weed is a negative intention an\nintention that i know\ncould start off amazing but we'll end\nthat so a negative intent\nso as an example yes give me an example\nlike greed\nego if i'm doing i'm doing this for oh\nthere's a deal coming and i'm gonna do\nthis just you know what it's gonna make\nme a few grand i'm going to do it\ncorrect\nso i would put that there and that and\nthat's different for different people\nlike yes i'm in a\ni have to take point and say i'm in a\nprivileged position where now i can\ndecide to do that right\nand there was a time when i stuck to\nthat even when i couldn't\nbut i appreciate that i get it yeah it's\ntough i'm just putting it out there as a\nas a disclaimer for other people i'm not\npushing that on anyone but for me\nfor me i know for a fact that if i'm\ndoing something just we were talking\nabout it earlier with guests\nlike i want to have guests here that i\ncan have these conversations with like\nthere may be a guest\nthat may get me the good numbers and\nlike\nbe really good for my brand but it's\nlike if i've got nothing to talk to them\nabout\nor if we're going to sit here and just\ntalk about their new cd right they're\nnot they're under\nanymore but you know you talk about then\nthen i'm just like sorry\nthis is showing my age but you know the\npoint being that like if that's all\nyou're going to do like that's not\nexciting to me\nso we me and my team when we're talking\nabout guests that we want to have we sit\nthere and talk about like\nwhat would be the talking points and\nlike you know jess will do the research\nand be like okay well\nlet's talk about the meaningful stuff\nlike we're trying to look at like how do\nwe\nyou know and so i think for me a big\nthing is i don't want to do things out\nof ego\ngreed just for money right my own pride\nor just for perception so i'm looking at\nhow can i do things out of kindness\nlove compassion service right impact\nand and i can still be as strategic\nabout it and that's the\nmissing link i feel and this is all\ninspired by one statement by martin\nluther king\nhe said that people who love peace\nneed to learn to organize themselves as\nwell as those who love war\nand that's the missing link that we can\nall be as\nspiritual and as deep and as pure as we\nlike or trying to be\nbut if we're not strategic and if we're\nnot fo and you know this because i see\nyou do it\nif we're not focused and we're not\norganized then we're doing a disservice\nto this beautiful message and i think\nwhat you pointed out so beautifully is\ni actually feel being a messenger of a\nmessage that is through me\nis actually liberating it takes some of\nthe pressure off sure it does because\nnow i'm like no it's not about me being\nperfect and now it's not about\nme having to live up to a certain\nstandard and now it's not about me\nhaving to be perfect all the time and\nsay the perfect things all the time\nand look perfect all the time and all of\nthat stuff\nand and i think that's where it takes\nthe pressure do you still\nhave yes the human moments\nyes where you struggle with\nlike oh that didn't do as well as i\nwanted it to or oh that person didn't\nrespond or\nor just finding yourself maybe in a\nmoment where you want to be just purely\nconnecting with another human thinking\nabout\nyou know the strategy of something\ntomorrow or\nyou know do you still have those moments\nyeah so i i would say that i definitely\nhave the moment of\nassessing i love assessing performance\nyeah\nbecause i also think when but it's the\nlens through which you're assessing it\nso\nlet me explain what i mean so i'm\nassessing like i would look at a post\nand be like oh people didn't like that\nvideo as much\ninteresting but i'm not going oh people\ndidn't like that video as much oh my god\ni'm so sad i don't like me\ni'm depressed about it i'm my self-worth\nis now falling down like\noh my god maybe like my views are gonna\ntank now and people are gonna unfold\nlike i'm not that's not the line of\nthought\nmy line of thought is okay what can i\nlearn why didn't they like that like\ndid we did we spread the wrong message\nwas it not meaningful enough like\ndid we did we use the wrong thumbnail\nlike i'm like i'm trying to learn from\nit\nand and ultimately it's coming from as a\nstrategy as a business as organizing\ncorrect but what's so interesting is\nthat\ni look and i see instagram and it's a\nstrange\nintersection of people's personal lives\nand business\nand it's very difficult to separate the\ntwo\nright because we're almost inextricably\nlinked as personalities and as human\nbeings\nyes and as business and monetization\nplatforms\nand that's what's never been discussed\nor talked about yeah\nright you're right so as an example you\nmight share\na post of you and your wife that has\nnothing to do with your business\nyes but then 90 of your other content is\ngoing to be about your business\ngranted your business specifically is to\nmake a difference in the world\nand you have to help people and mine but\ni know that's that's been one of\nand not to bring it back to me but\nbringing it back to me please bring it\nback\nno that's been one of the struggles that\ni've had is\ni had to take a step back and i had to\nsay like\nwait what am i saying and what am i\ndoing because it's such a powerful tool\nbut as we know tools can be used for\ngood and tools can be used to destroy\nand i'm seeing so many\nnegative things happening in\nin people's lives as individuals i'm\nseeing the dating\nworld i feel i feel\ni have so much compassion and sadness\nfor so many of the people that i'm\nseeing trying to navigate\num themselves in this like\nsocial media uh instant gratification\ndating world i'm seeing we're seeing you\nknow epidemic\nlevels of depression amongst young\npeople right because of the likes\nand because of you know these are i mean\nwe were lucky we didn't have social\nmedia when we were\nyou know i'm older than you but we\ndidn't have it\nlike imagine that pressure you know um\nso i so yeah so i look at it and i just\nsaid like okay\nwhy am i taking this picture yes it's\nthat simple\nit is that simple why am i doing why am\ni taking this picture and what i've been\ndoing\nyou know and i took it a little too far\nbecause i really haven't been posting\nnearly as much as i\nused to is i i kind of took account as\nto why i was doing\nsomething which really comes down to\npurity of intention\nright 100 why am i posting this\ndo i know it's going to get likes or am\ni posing this because i like it\nyes and if you can just strip it down to\nthat\nand start to battle the pavlovian like\nuh\ninstincts that come up when you're\nthinking about it um\nthen i think that you're on the right\ntrack and so that's kind of the world\ni'm in now which is\nsharing far less far less personal\nmoments although i share personal\nmoments but i'm sharing them because i\nlike them\nand i'm acknowledging and i'm aware of\nthe thing in me\nthat for some reason doesn't feel\naccepted when\nthe strategy as the business person\num isn't getting the response that\ni feel like it could or should because\ni'm not\nlike you in the sense where i i don't\nhave a platform where i'm quite\nliterally trying to affect and change\npeople's lives all day long i'm i'm\ncreating a different kind of content\nbut my world has come together with my\npersonal life and my business\nand it's a very tricky thing and you're\nseeing a lot of influencers and\ncelebrities dealing with this kind of\nthis this strange intersection of like\nbusiness and personal life\nthe promotion of brands it's a very\nlucrative thing for people in our\nposition like with this privilege but at\nthe same time\nat what cost and what are we saying and\nhow are we doing it and what are we\nshowing\nand it's really trying to figure out and\ni'm on the journey of trying to figure\nout how i can do it in a pure way\nyes because it's a necessary thing yes\nbut i i need it to feel pure because i\nmy my filter and my my accounting system\nis straight up like if this doesn't feel\nright or pure i can't do it\ntotally physically can't do it no matter\nhow much you're going to pay me yes\num and that's and that's kind of the\nthat's kind of the problem\nyeah so that's kind of my issue with\nsocial media right now\nand uh and i'm also i'm also i don't\neven think you asked me this but i've\nalso been struggling and thinking a lot\nabout\njust overall intention and i'm seeing\nthis i'm seeing this trend in\nespecially young people that want to\nchange the world\nand i don't know if anybody really knows\nwhy they want to change the world\nand that's troubling to me in an age\nwhere everybody's trying to be more\nauthentic\nnobody is and that's scary for me\nthinking about my daughter's generation\nwhich is why we at my company at wayfair\nand personally we don't say authentic\nanymore we say sincere\num you know and i and i believe that you\ngot to ask two to three why's\nalways yes sure why do you want to\nchange the world\nbecause well why do you want to do that\nbecause the third why is going to be\nbecause i want people to remember that i\ndid\nor and you know you look at this hustle\nmentality this world that we're living\nin on\nyou know where we're showing our lives\nto everybody and then i just look at\nthem saying well\nwhat's driving you to do that why are\nyou sharing that why are you\nbroadcasting live on instagram who are\nyou talking to and what are you trying\nto say\nright and sometimes i think about the\nfuture and wondering like if an alien\ncivilization came down\nand discovered the remains of our of\nlike of our\n2019-2020 what would they see they'd see\nbillions of people all over the world\nbroadcasting themselves and taking\npictures of themselves instead of\nseeing the moments around them and the\nother day it was funny i took\nwhen i took a month off we talked about\ntaking a break took a month off after\nfive years of building\nthe show and everything else to be with\nmy family\nand the last few days i just left my\nphone somewhere completely\nand i was sitting in this restaurant by\nmyself getting some food for my kids who\nwere down the street\nand i didn't have my phone and i just\nremember looking around\nand i was just smiling because like i\nwas watching people\nand i went oh my god i've been missing\nlife\nand i looked over and i saw they had\nthis like jenga set\nand i went over and i got and i just\nlike played jenga by myself\nand i would have never done that because\ni would have been on\nsome social platform or writing down\nsome idea\nor answering an email and i would have\nmissed the beauty that is right\nin freaking front of us and that's kind\nof the struggle that i'm having my inner\nbattle with it because we've never been\ntrained like we talked about masculinity\nwell men have never been trained to hold\nthis conversation\nnever been trained to hold women like\nwith like the female trauma\nwe've been trained to hold our trauma\nwell as human beings we're not trained\nto live in a digital world where we're\nconnected to our phones and\nand and being like liked or\nloved based on what we show like it's\nnot\nthis our brains aren't used to it\nespecially if we don't have the\nspiritual foundation to keep us grounded\nso that our egos don't take over\nso the long response to your question is\nthat's what i'm thinking about right now\nis how can i navigate this world how can\nwe have this conversation\nwhere in the back of my mind i don't\ncare how many downloads this podcast\nepisode gets\nlike i'll sh i share a picture of us i\ndon't care how many likes it gets\nif people like it that's fantastic i\nhope instagram gets rid of the likes\nyou know like we just do it because we\nlove it we\nwant it it comes from our soul comes\nfrom our hearts and our desire to share\nwhat comes through us\nnot because it fills a void yeah um and\ni have a lot of voids\nto fill and that's kind of what i'm uh\nexploring and on the journey of right\nnow i love that man that's amazing what\na\nwhat a great uh i don't know what a\ngreat\ncollection that's really awesome i'm not\nas enlightened as\nmany of your guests because i don't know\ni'm just realizing we're so\nwe're you know we i just no but what i\nlove about it and what what i'm glad\nand this is beautiful like you know the\none thing i love about the podcast is i\nhave no idea where it's gonna go and\nthis is exactly\nright now i'm having one of those\nmoments where i'm just like i love where\nthis is going\nand has gone so far because i'm just\nlistening to you and and all i'm\nthinking is that\nactually that's the beauty of it that we\nare trying to learn about this new world\nand we're exploring it yeah and we\naren't going to make mistakes we are all\ngoing to post something\nthat we know we did for the wrong reason\nand then we're going to reflect and be\nlike okay\ni'm going to try this next time and okay\nthat didn't quite work i got that wrong\ntoo and so i feel like this\nconstant self-reflection and\nself-checking that's all we have and\nwhat you mentioned about the three whys\nlike\ni've often referred to as the y ladder\ni'm like you need to build a y ladder\nyeah and then you can walk up it if the\ny's stack up but if you can't answer\nthem that means you've got no wrongs on\nthat ladder and start no\ntwo y's yeah the first y is never enough\nno 100\nyou got to go with the y of the y yes\nand it's one of the things that if you\nlike my daughter's four\nwhy why why\nthe fourth why there's no answer yeah\nthere's never an answer you can't get\npast the third yeah\nbut like that curiosity that wisdom can\nonly come if we ask ourselves these whys\ni love the y ladder yeah like why why\njust can you if you can get to the\nsecond why you'll find that\nthere's something missing yes and if we\ncan get to the point where we can\nacknowledge the parts of ourselves that\nare uncomfortable and dirty if we can\nget comfortable\nin the uncomfortable the parts of\nourselves that are doing things to fill\nthat void\nthen like man that's a recipe for\nhappiness like no other even if it's\nlike oh\ni don't like how that feels and you\ndon't do it great\nyeah and we don't have to beat ourselves\nup because we failed\nthat's the other part of it like that's\nwhat you beat ourselves because lots of\ngood can come from our\ndoing things impurely and we are going\nto and we are going to nobody is pure\n100\nand by faith we're told that like we\nwill never conquer our ego\nyes ever yes you can go be a monk for a\nbillion years or\n80 years you know what's really funny\nthis also made me think of something\nbaha'u'llah says in the by faith at one\npoint he called the monks\ndown from the monasteries he says\namazing you've found enlightenment\nyou've found meditation\nyou have perfected the art of uh of\nof silence now come down here\nyes and put that into practice yep\nyou're doing that\ni was actually doing that because it's\nit's easy you can spend 60 years in a\nmonastery and\nand practice all these things but can\nyou practice\nit down on hollywood boulevard with\nthree and a half million followers with\na million people or two million people\nthat download your podcast\ncan you practice what you've learned as\na monk\nin the middle of superficiality and\nmaterialism\nthat's what you're literally doing man\nthat's why i applaud you well no that\nthe crazy thing about it is that i've\nsaid to so many people that like\nbeing a monk was like going to school\nand then this has been the exam\nlike i've actually said it like that\nlike this has been the test\nof everything i've learned is the last\nsix years since i left\nthe the ashram this has been the test\nand when we were trained in the vedic\nphilosophy same thing so\ni love the fact that we're so aligned on\nbelief a you'll never overcome ego\nno one's fully enlightenment you're\nconstantly in the path of purification\nit's all about sincerity of purpose so i\nlove the use of the word sincerity\nand and the key thing was also that half\nof our day was silenced and half was\nserviced because we were told it's easy\nto feel humble when you're\non your own like it's easy to feel\nyou've overcome ego\nuntil someone challenges it so if you're\non your own all day\nyou can be like oh yeah i'm over ego\nlike i'm cool like nothing can trigger\nme and then the next thing like in a car\non the pacific highway or whatever it is\nall of a sudden like you know you're\nlike oh my god i'm full of anger and\nyou're you're spot on and and therefore\ni think that it's okay we just have to\nrapid awareness like rapid awareness to\nstuff and that's what i always explain\nto people it's like you're not trying to\nmake something disappear\nyou're trying to spot it quicker and\nthen you're trying to transform it\nquicker like it's just\na speed thing it's not a matter of yes\nor no i think we live in this binary\nworld of\none day i'm impure and one day i'm pure\nand it's like\nwe both know it doesn't work like that\nbut what does work is that i get quicker\nat spotting those moments\nand i get quicker it changes it's funny\nwhen people ask me a lot um\nthe effects that uh making my last days\nhad on me\nyes yeah and i was gonna get into and my\nlast days was a documentary series that\ni\nthat i produce where i've been traveling\nin the country for seven or eight years\ntelling the stories of people that are\nterminally ill\nbut living amazing lives um and there's\nsomething that happens to somebody\nwhen they find out they're dying that\nthe reason i created the show\nwas because i cr i wanted so badly\nfor an audience to be able to have that\nsame moment\nwithout giving being given the diagnosis\nwhat if\nwhat if you could wake up and live as if\nyou were told from the doctor you had\nsix months\nwhat would you do how would you treat\npeople what would you care about\nright that was my dream that was my goal\nwhat i found was the thought of\nmortality\nand being around so many individuals who\nare so\nclose to death was that\nwas that exact thing that you described\nit was the thing that\nin an argument with my wife or a friend\nor\nin the middle of deal points you know in\na business was the thing that made me\ncome back faster because at the end of\nthe day\nit's does that matter why am i reacting\nthat way\nand when i leave here how am i going to\nfeel about it now\nif you're dying and you have six months\nto live it's just it's a totally\ndifferent thing than if you feel like\nyou have another 80 or 90 which none of\nus even know how long we have\nbut this this this coming back faster is\nall that we really need to do\nthat's what i talk that's what my wife\nand i talk about it's great it's\nso what if we get an argument but how\nfast can we come back\nmy personal version of that is how fast\ncan i apologize\ndo i have to wait till the next day or\ncan i do it almost\nthe second that i say it and abdul-baha\nin my faith basically says um\nin the future the crime itself will be\nthe punishment\nthe goal is to get to a place in\ncivilization right where we are so\nspiritually grounded\nthat the very act of the crime itself\nwill be all the punishment that's needed\nlike that's where we want to go oh wow\nlike so like how fast can we come back\noh i didn't feel good\nall right i'm back on course and it's\nlike the pain of committing the crime is\nthe punishment that's it yeah\nit's that way the remember knowing that\nwe knowing that we displeased\nright like that's what that's where we\nhave to to get to which is why when i\nsay like\nall of these problems are spiritual in\ntheir core yes you know like you could\nlook at everything\nlike the prison like you talk about the\nthe\nprison industrial complex like all of\nthese things are\nthey're all broken but they all have\nspiritual fundamental issues that if we\njust looked at them as\nyou know wow wait a second people change\nlike i can change you can change i just\nmight have cursed at that person but\nthree seconds later i was in\ni was so regretful that i did let me go\napologize to that person i'm gonna track\nthat person down and say i'm sorry\nright i think about that all the time\nwhen i'm driving in la because there's\nso much road rage\nyes road rage is getting worse have you\nnoticed by this oh my god\nit's getting worse think about it\nthere's a lot of reasons why it's\ngetting worse but like someone\nsomeone but someone drives by you right\nand they like literally flip you off and\nyou're like did i do something wrong\nliterally right and like i sometimes\nwonder if like\nwhat if that person then slowed down and\nsaid i'm sorry i'm just having a bad day\nbecause generally that person flips you\noff and then you then\nget pissed off and flip off the next\nperson or that ruins your day\nright and it sends you down this spiral\nof negativity but\ncan you do it on both sides can you have\ninstant reflection can you fight with\nyour\npartner or your wife or say something\nstupid and then and then immediately\napologize and say why\nyou're sorry not just that you're sorry\noh man this is why that happened yeah\nthat's what we're getting to how fast\ncan we come back yes\ni love that i'm so glad you brought out\nthat's such a beautiful statement and i\nlove that practical ass\nthe practical aspect of ask asking\nquestions like how fast can i apologize\nit's a brilliant one but it's going to\nbe from a sincere place 100 right 100\npercent\nyou and i tell you as you and i both\nknow our partners know when the\napology is real oh my god yeah\ndefinitely it's like because my wife\nwill tell me straight up like no i don't\nbelieve you\nyeah and then that'll piss me off even\nmore so what do you mean you don't\nbelieve me yeah yeah\nshe's like why and then i'm like all\nright\nall right give me a second yeah right\nand then you come back and what we found\nis like\nthe faster you come back the happier you\nare yes right you're never going to be\nlike completely without it absolutely if\nyou are completely this is another\npodcast but if you are completely\nwithout it\nthen you're not going deep enough yeah\nabsolutely yeah the two things that\nalways have to be specific\napologies and appreciation right you\ncan't do either\nwhat are you thankful for what are you\nsorry for yeah you can't do either of\nthem with being generic\nbut that ties back to the taking\nyourself to account thing as well\nright getting super specific for\nyourself and for your creator of\nwhat am i what did go well what am i\nthankful for\nyeah right yeah now you're going to get\na taste of your own medicine so i one\nthing i was going to say that i really\nlove about\nwhat you're doing and the way you're\ndoing it is that\nwhen i came to your movie premiere which\ni'm so grateful you invited me to\nfive feet apart festival was a beautiful\nevent it was\nso amazing to be a part of it it's the\nfirst movie premiere i've been to\nactually\nso i was really grateful to be invited i\ndon't know i don't usually go\nto the ones i've been invited to but\nthis felt special and i wanted to come\nbecause\ni just feel that you've genuinely tried\nto be of service through your media so i\nwas interested to see how you were going\nto do\nthis one and this is what i loved about\nit pressure i was watching a movie\nwhich in and of itself is a story of two\npeople but which\ni will talk about in a second and how\nyou got there but for me i was learning\ngratitude\ni was learning forgiveness i was like\nyou know if you were watching it\nsincerely you were going to take away\nall these messages\nand i could tell that everyone was\nalmost\nwhat's the right word everyone was so\nengaged to watch it sincerely because\nthe whole\naudience was in tears like the whole\ntime and i\nfor anyone who's not seen it yet i\nhighly recommend going to see it please\ngo watch it\nit's i just saw it on my plane right\nback home too oh no\nit was on my airline so funny i always\ntell people if you're going to watch it\non a plane just be prepared because\nyour partner is going to think you're\nhaving a nervous breakdown their seat\npartner you know literally yeah\nexactly but if you haven't seen it\nplease go watch it i i went out to see\nit\nuh on the night that it came out when\njustin invited me i've seen it twice\nafter that\nand all i'm gonna say is that people\nweren't just crying at the end like\npeople were crying the whole way through\nbut then they would laugh\nand then they'll cry again and then they\nwould laugh and that's what's so\nbeautiful about it that\nyou were able to teach or at least share\nmessages of gratitude appreciation\nforgiveness love all of these things\nthrough crying and laughter and and i\nthink that's very unique and i think\nthat's very special\nthat you could go to a theater go to a\ncinema and watch a movie\nthat was able to bring out all of those\nresponses like i'm sure people after\nthat like called up the person they love\nand which is like\ni love you like you know just i want you\nto know this in a good way yeah it was\nwhat's funny was that was my only goal\nyeah i mean i had a few specific goals\nnone of them were financial\nbut one of them was if people because i\ngot asked this question a lot before i\nmade it and after\nis what would you hope an audience would\ndo\nlike what do you hope the audience\nreaction would be and i always said if\nsomebody\nleft the theater and called somebody\nthat they loved and told them\nthen we will have succeeded or forgave\nsomebody that they were arguing with or\napologized to somebody\nor just noticed how lucky they were to\nbe able to hold the hand of somebody\nthey loved\ngratitude all of these things so that\nwas so thank you because that really was\nthat was the goal and the response has\nbeen incredible i think more than\nanything\nit was a human project you know one of\nthe arabic words for human\nright is insane which has infinite\ndefinitions\nbut of course one of them means they who\nforget\nwhich is funny that like insane means\nlike they who forget\num and the idea and this was you know my\nmy partner my production company is\nmuslim and we were having conversations\nabout this is one of\nlike it's interesting that that's one of\nthe words for human\nis that we forget everything we forget\nour joy\nwe forget our pain like we just\nforget and it's both a blessing and a\ncurse and part of the beauty of life is\nin the remembering\nright the idea that god created us to\nremember him\nright not to like like which means that\nhe'd built us in a way that makes us\nalso forget\nso then the journey to remembering is\nthat much more beautiful and i think\nthat that\njourney in a film should replicate the\njourney in life\nso for me a movie that makes you cry\nstrips away all the stuff and the\nbarriers like it's like the rooming\nquote like all the barriers we've built\nup against love\nyeah it strips it all away and it leaves\nus open so that we can then take in a\nmessage\nso my strength i found early on was\nas a storyteller i both enjoy\nand and and excel at making people feel\nthings\nwhich is why i would say like a mission\nstatement for me is helping people\ntake the journey from their head to\ntheir heart right um\nand that's essentially what the film was\nsupposed to be is if we can strip people\ndown we can make them\nfeel something deeply and this social\nmedia\nlike instant gratification on demand\nsociety\nif we can like just make people feel\nthen we can create\nroom and space for them to have that\nlight bulb go off where they realize how\ngrateful they are\nor how lucky they are or the fact that\nthey can take a full breath\nor how meaningless the argument that\nthey're in is or\nthe depression that they're facing\nbecause maybe they weren't invited to\nthat party that they see all their\nfriends are\nat on snapchat or instagram or how many\nlikes they got\ncan you strip it all away and just sit\nthere and watch something that just\nbrings you back to what matters and\nhelps you remember\nthat was the goal of the movie and\nthat's kind of the goal for all the\ncontent that we're creating is can you\nremember\ncan we remember how lucky we are and how\nbeautiful life is and\ncan be because you can't have happiness\nunless you're content with what you have\nand\nand so uh so i'm happy that the response\nwas that and also it was inspired by\nmy friend claire who passed away who had\ncystic fibrosis who was a walking\nexample\nof that and she was featured in the\nsecond season of my last days and\ni mean she was the one that said like we\nall have the ability to make our lives a\nbeautiful piece of art\nand um and you know the hope is that\npeople walk away from that movie having\nthat experience you know\nand crying a little bit and laughing a\nlittle bit and the laughter like after\nyou cry\nlike something funny is that much\nsweeter yes right and then after you\nlaugh\nsomething sad is that much more\nemotional yeah but that all comes from\nreal people my last days people think\nit's so depressing it's inspiring\nbecause like they're not just sad all\nthe time they use humor have to\nlike in many ways to deflect from the\nsadness and but it doesn't change the\nsadness\nbut sometimes that stuff's funny and\nlike you know\nit's just an extreme situation so yeah\nyeah man it's been a really really\nbeautiful experience and now i'm off to\nmy next one yeah\nyeah you can't tell me anything about it\nbut yes no i can't it's another it's\nanother\njerker yeah okay it's based on another\ndocumentary we're making a movie at\nwarner brothers called clouds based on\nthe life of zack sobiak who was\nuh it was a viral youtube documentary\nthat i had made he'd written a song\ncalled clouds and the week he died the\ndocumentary went viral and the song hit\nnumber one on itunes\nwow and it's basically a story about how\nthis young 17 year old\nchooses to live the last year of his\nlife knowing that all of his other\nfriends are going to college\nand how he chooses to spend his time and\nthe impact that he wants to have on the\nworld\ni love that man and this is this is what\ni'm saying this is this is why i love\nthe work you're involved in because\nit's it may not and you know we both\nbelieve in this education entertainment\nworld of like where you're able to\nenlighten through entertainment\nand i do believe that you know that was\nthe reason why i\ncame into this world and wanted to be\ninvolved was because i really saw that\ntoo that i felt that we're always going\nto want to watch movies\nwe're always going to want to watch\ndocumentaries we're always going to do\nthat but\nif the creators behind these can become\nmore conscious\nyeah if all of us can come with an angle\nof okay how is this\nwhy is this serving anyone right beyond\nwhat you said the monetization or any of\nthat stuff like how is this\nreally helping people because in the\nworld today we have this\ndichotomy between just as we have junk\nfood we have junk media\nand if all you're consuming is junk\nmedia that's gonna destroy your\ninsides in the same way junk food\ndestroys the outsides and and that's\nwhere i am you're the only that's funny\nthat was it was quite literally in an\nearly deck\nwhen i was starting the company and\nbegging people to\nmake things with me that i said it was\nlike we are doing the exact same thing\nin television and media that we've done\nin the\nfood system right which is we're\ncreating the low hanging\nlike this tastes really good it's really\nsugary it's filled with all these\nnatural like\nyou know natural flavors and then five\nminutes later you feel terrible about\nyourself\nyeah and you know there's so much\ncontent that's being created\nthat make us feel better\nabout being worse people and we're\nreally\ninterested and you are too how do you\ncreate content that makes people\nwant to be better yes and finally now\nwe're in a place where that's becoming\ncool yeah which is going to present an\nentirely new set of challenges\nbecause we're gonna find ourselves\nswimming\nin a ocean where everybody is now trying\nto make similar content\nyeah but there's going to be differences\nin the intention of why people are\nmaking the content which is going to be\nthe difference of why things work and\nwhy they don't\nbut for most people they're not going to\nbe able to see that right it's like\ni say this a lot but it's like your\ngrandmother's cooking yeah\nyou could make the exact same thing that\nyou could get at a restaurant absolutely\nbut this\nyour grandma's tastes so much better yes\nthe ingredients could be identical\nyes but she made it with love yeah\nthat's that's the same approach that we\nhave that i know we both share with\ncontent\nand it's going to be really tricky in\nthe next that's my prediction in the\nnext five years\ni think is is there's going we're going\nto be so saturated with like\nyou know that the the the gurus and the\nchange your life and the content that\ndoes good in the world that\nthat we're gonna have to really be\nmindful of the three whys\nyes you know that's why i always ask\npeople like well why why\nwhy because if you because if it's not\ncoming from that other place then that\nmeans that\nit might look the same but but behind it\nyes\nyou know yes the iceberg underneath it\nis it\nisn't really doing anything for anybody\nand then for people like us we're gonna\nhave our own challenges man\nwhich is the more successful anyone gets\nthe more of a test it is\nfor the purity of the reasons we create\nabsolutely um and nobody is exempt from\nthat 100\nand my teacher keeps reminding me i've\nactually invited you to an event\nyeah on the train i'm going to hope\nyou're getting accomplished\nhe keeps me in check because he's he's\n70 years old he's been a monk for 40\nyears\nhe comes out and travels and meets and\nhe's he's with us\nhere at the moment and he's someone who\njust me and my wife were talking about\nthe other day\nbecause he can say things to me that\nif most people said there are people in\nyour life that you need that can say\nthings to you that no one else can say\nyeah and that you will listen to it and\ndo your ego is\nnaturally limited because you have just\nso much respect for them and i feel like\nyou need people like that in your life\nwho you trust to the point where even\nwhen my ego really wants to respond to\nhim and justify myself and it still does\nyou don't you shut up but i just don't\nand i shut up and listen\nand and that's like such a benefit to\nhave someone like that we're very\nprivileged to have those people\nyeah most people don't have those people\nyeah so then for anybody listening find\nthose people if you don't look for\nsurround yourself with people that tell\nyou the truth\nyes i was telling my sister this last\nnight just it's so\nlike truth even if it is\ncan be hurtful is so important\nhowever like in giving of the truth then\nwe have our whole then the you know\nwhat's this quote that i love i was\ntelling her um not everything that a man\nthinketh can be\ndisclosed that everything that a man\ndiscloseth can be considered as timely\nand not every timely utterance can be\nconsidered suitable for the one who\nhears it\nit's a quote from baha'u'llah so the\nidea is not everything that you think\ncan be said\nright and then you just it's like the\nthree wise and then you have to really\nthink about when you're saying and when\nyou're giving that feedback\num but maybe we can also be that for\neach other yeah i'd love them and that'd\nbe amazing no i'd appreciate i think we\nneed more people in that category in our\nlives\nwho can do that and you're forced to\nshut up and listen because you want to\nand\ni want to ask you some some advice now\nbecause even though\nyou know and i'm not doing it i don't\nhave much no i'll tell you why\ni'm not a father yeah and and we my wife\nobviously want to have kids at some\npoint and\nand the reason why i'm asking you this\nis i'd love to hear how\nyou've been trying to\npass on whatever you have or to learn\nfrom your children too\nin this process because i know it's a\ntwo-way thing you know it is man well\ni think our til our children teach us\nmore than we teach them yeah\nespecially in the first few years um\nmy kids one of the things that i'm\ntrying\nactively working on is trying to see the\nworld the way they do\ni don't know why or how we forget the\nwonder\nof like the fact that somehow\nlike these like our body like\nlike we've we've come into existence\nfrom like\nnot from any will of our own doing so\nwe're here\nand all of this is\nhappening and everything was somehow\nbuilt and created and we're just like\nyeah yeah\nthat's hollywood boulevard yeah yeah\nlike no that's hollywood boulevard\nlike but what's underneath that like\nwhoa the sun rises and sets\nthe stars like my kids look at all of\nthis and they're so curious yeah and\nwe're just like that's old news\nbut is it like stars\nreally like is it old news the fact that\nwhat we're looking at doesn't actually\nexist today and it's millions of light\nyears away\nthat those are balls of gas that were\nplanets that weren't what were once\nthere or not there or stars\nit's like like we forget and then we\njust get\nand then we're just like yeah we're like\noh did i get how many likes did that get\nyou know um and my kids are looking at\nthe world with so much wonder and that's\nsomething that i'm really\ninterested in and excited about that i\ntry to remind myself like i\nstop and i look at the world and i look\nat the fact that i'm driving a car\nlike we're driving a car or you're\nflying on a plane like have we ever just\nlike how often do you stop and you look\nat like that thing weighs\na hundred tons and yet it's somehow in\nthe air like it's like the world is\nmagical man like we're spinning my\nmy wife my wife often talks about the\nmoon\nand so maya's obsessed with the moon and\ntrying to explain to her\nwhat the moon is and in explaining to\nher what the moon is you're like\noh my god that's freaking cool yeah like\nwe're actually\nlook what are we looking at yeah how big\nthat thing is\nhow we're rotating and how the moon's\nrotating and there's the sun\nyeah so that's something that's exciting\nto me is looking at the world with\nwonder and i think in terms of what i'm\ntrying to pass on to them\nuh i'm trying to\ndo a few different things one of the\nthings i'm trying to do is\nis show that i'm not perfect because i\nthink the moment that\nwe realize our parents are human is one\nof the hardest moments of\nany person's life yes um\nand i want her growing up and him\ngrowing up to see me as\nas just like what i'm talking about\ntoday which is i'm just trying to figure\nthis out\nand hoping that me asking questions\nand digging in and my wife doing the\nsame will give them a completely new set\nof tools that unfortunately most of the\nworld doesn't have right now which is\nintrospection\nyes um and also of course raising them\nwith faith from an early age but\nexplaining that faith\nhas to be practiced right and by faith\nwe're told that\nfaith is the fewness of words\nand the abundance of deeds you know\nteaching them that it's about doing\nright faith is about doing\num the ways that that's practically\nhappening you know\nis when things happen it's like a\nreal-time explanation of\nwhy daddy's crying or\nwhy mommy's upset and understand\nteaching them that it's not about\nthem or when you lose your temper\nexplaining that\ni'm just overwhelmed and but this is not\nyour fault um\ni'm doing this thing now where i'm\nteaching my son where his heart is he's\n20 months old\nand i was thinking about practically all\nthe things that\ni didn't learn not because my dad wasn't\nable to teach me but because\nit wasn't in his like orbit and so i'm\nteaching him where his heart is\nphysically first and then i'm starting\nto also teach him all the things that\nhis heart can do\nso i wrote a song the other night called\nshow me your heart right\nso we're like literally singing about\nlike show me your heart\num and now they sing it and i say\nwhere's your heart maxwell and he goes\nhere and then it's about saying well you\nknow your heart is the strongest muscle\nin your body\nright of course it's good to have yeah\nmuscles but\nnothing is stronger than your heart\nright i love that um with maya\nwe do this thing when we put them to\nsleep at night and uh\nand i anybody's and i i don't share this\nin a way of saying like this is the\nright way to do it or look at us but\nwe go through attributes because we\nbelieve the only way you can know god is\nthrough his attributes\nright his it attributes um so we talk\nabout all the things that she is\nstarting with brave and strong kind\npatient resourceful powerful\nbeautiful noble and we go through this\nlong list and she repeats\nafter me and after my wife every single\nnight um\nand then we talk about all the people\nthat she loves and it always ends with\nher loving god and then\nher loving herself and being enough and\nnow we're doing that with maxwell but he\ncan't say all the things so but\nhis first words that he's learned are\nthese attributes of god\nright right all of these attributes and\nthen what happens is\nthings happen during the day and we're\nfinding little ways to connect\nwhat happens during the day with the\nwords that she's learning at night\nand the words that he's learning at\nnight so if she shares\nsomething with her brother we talk about\nhow\nmaya c you're giving or c you're\nselfless right\nthese attributes because we believe that\nthat\nmost of the um the most of our\nspirituality develops before the age of\nfive yes\num and uh and so those are some of the\nways and then also just making sure that\nwe're\nthat like they know that we're flawed\nand that's going to be critical as they\nget\nolder is explaining that like daddy\ndoesn't know what to do\nhere or daddy messed up here's what\ndaddy did wrong\num and here's how we're learning about\nit and so that i don't have to fall from\ngrace\nwhen they're in their 20s because it's\ngoing to happen yeah inevitably\nthere's going to be that moment where\ni'm not a superhero right and also\nmaking sure that they know that i can't\nfix\neverything and i can't save the world i\ncan't save everything but i'm going to\ndo my best\num i love that man that's so awesome and\nand i love the fact that\nyou're also setting this it's it's\nsetting an example in a human way\nand i think that's the balance it's like\nyou're setting an example in a human way\nand i love that\nand and i see you doing that and i\nhaven't been with you yet and i really\nwant to when you're next to it the skid\nrow kind of love love that you do\nwow\nbut i 100 want to turn up with you\nbecause i've seen it i've only witnessed\nit through social media think\nthank you for social media to be able to\nsee what you do and i've been traveling\nwhen\nyou've done it here and you've invited\nme in the past and i really want to join\nnext time you do it\nbecause i think it's like this you know\nfor your kids to go up and see that and\nnot see you as\nsuperman as like the perfect person but\nto see you as someone who's wanting to\nmake\na practical difference too like being\nout there doing things i mean that\nto me is is so special because i think\nwhen when children grow up and\nsee their parents doing things that they\ndon't\nneed to do in one sense or whatever it\nmay be or oh yeah there's you know i\ngive money to something or you know i\nwe do this that's good but when you're\ngiving your time and your energy\nlike time is our most valuable resource\nand you know it's one of the reasons why\ni think it's so great that you start\nevery one of your podcasts by thanking\npeople for their time\nbecause when you give your time um\nthat's a true\nact of love it's one of the reasons why\nso i have this quote um\nfrom abdul bihar my this is in my wife's\nhandwriting\nand it says this is like the it's like\nthe essence of\nso much of the way that we try and\nattempt to live where there is love\nnothing is too much trouble and there is\nalways time\nand this idea of of course time is\nlimited\nbut when you love something right\nthere's always time and how is love\nmanifest and deeds\num so that's kind of at its core really\nwhat it all comes down to is what are we\nchoosing to give our time to\num which is one of the biggest struggles\nliving in 2019\n2020 right living in this modern day\nwhich there's so many things that want\nto take our time\nthis could real carnival just for two\nseconds please that's just the\ncoolest day ever it's a day of human\nkindness and from the outside in it\nlooks like a big carnival in the middle\nof one of the worst man-made disasters\nin our country skid row\nwe clearly have an epidemic of people\nexperiencing homelessness in los angeles\nas the\nyou know the data just came out and\nwe're like skyrocketing through the roof\nand it's really uh it was a way to\nfigure out\nhow to use like the perceived celebrity\nand coolness\nto actually create real you know real\nimpact and change and so we started with\ntrying to create an event that brought\npeople all to\nthe worst place in los angeles and\nand physically transformed it into a day\nof\njust joy and love and it's one of the\nmost beautiful things i've ever\nexperienced\nbecause for one day you cannot tell\nwho's homeless and who isn't you cannot\ntell who's rich or who's poor\nwho's who's struggling with an addiction\nor a mental illness or not\nright because chances are both sides are\nit is a day where everybody comes\ntogether and sees each other as one\nyou don't see people on their phones\npeople aren't taking selfies\npeople show up to work to be of service\non both sides and the way it works is we\nuh\nwe have this day where we partner with\nall these service organizations\nwe bring all the people together that\nare competing for the same money from\nthe government and from the state\nand we bring them all together to offer\nall the services in one place\nand we create a day where one volunteer\ngets partnered with one guest who's\nexperiencing homelessness\nand they walk through this experiential\ncarnival together\nand of course there's the superficial\nthings like food and clothing\nthere's like gorgeous barbecue and\ntruckloads of clothing and toys for kids\nbut then there's all the other things\nthere's psychologists there's social\nworkers there's the dmv for id cards\nthere's housing initiatives\nthere's dental there's medical there's a\nthere's eye exams\nthere's glasses for people that can't\nsee um there's blood tests hiv tests\nthere's\ntriage for people that have open wounds\non their feet like\nyou name it it's there there's haircuts\nthere's\nmanicures pedicures feet washing we we\nwanted to create this experiential day\nbut all the guests are providing the\nservice and it's a one-on-one connection\num and that and what came out of that\nwas an idea to take it further\nand we created the it's called the\none-to-one program where we're now\ntaking as a pilot program a hundred\nvolunteers and we're partnering them\nwith 100 people experiencing\nhomelessness\nor extreme poverty that want to be a\npart of this program\nfor one year of friendship that's\nawesome and then we're going to fund the\nfriendship in the sense that we're going\nto give every volunteer\na 500 gift card that can only be spent\non the friendship\nand based on the exact needs of that\nindividual\nso if that person maybe needs maybe they\njust need a night\naway from where they are or a new a new\noutfit for a job interview\nor whatever it or maybe they just need\nto go see a movie\nor they just go have coffee together\nwhatever it is it's about building this\nfriendship\nand then we provide the support to both\nof them via\nall the different service providers that\nwe know because i believe that the one\nthing we're not doing when we're looking\nat the\nthe pro the problem of homelessness is\nwe're not addressing it from a human\nstandpoint which is like forget about\naddiction first of all everybody needs\nhousing i'm a big housing first\ninitiative because you can't get your\nlife together unless you have housing\nright imagine trying to go to a job but\nsleeping on the street\nor trying to show up on time somewhere\nor trying to battle depression or your\nabuse or your substance abuse addiction\nwhich is always caused by past trauma\nwithout having a freaking place to live\nwe are totally backwards the way we're\napproaching the issue however why aren't\nwe looking at it from a place of\nhuman to human connection saying you\nmatter\ni see you i love you you belong in\nsociety\nthere is nothing different between you\nand me i'm not authorizing you\ni'm bringing you in and what can i do to\nhelp we're not looking at it from that\npoint\nyes let's put people on housing let's\nyes let's get people help but let's also\nsee if we can\nlike create awareness by building\nfriendships so we're testing this\nprogram we're seeing what happens we're\nseeing what results come from it\nmy hope is that it can become a scalable\nsolution\nto people that have servant oriented\nhearts that want to actually feel like\nthey're doing something\nand and with people that want to get off\nthe street or want to create and\nwant to have an actual friendship and\nwhat we found is that they're people on\nboth sides that want the same thing so\nlet's bring them together\nand you know we'll see what happens\nthat's beautiful man crazy\ni'm so glad you're doing all this and\nyou haven't figured it out yet i haven't\nyeah it makes me happy i haven't managed\nno i know no i know you're honest and\nsincere when you say that but what i'm\nsaying is\nimagine imagine not that we ever figure\nit out but no imagine as\nyou grow even more and more we're going\nto be so grateful as well to have so\nmany of your gifts in a\nyou know and receive all of them because\ni'm so happy to\nto speak to you today and hear from you\nand hear about all the incredible work\nyou're doing across the board and\nthe fact that you haven't figured it out\nthat gives me a lot of faith\nnor will i ever well and that's what\ni've loved about you know we brought up\nmarvel earlier like that's what i love\nabout superheroes like\nyou know superheroes are not perfect and\nwe have this viewpoint which\nwhen you look from an untrained eye you\nthink of the marvel superheroes as\nperfect\nbut they're not they've all got flaws\nthey've all got origin stories they've\nall got issues\nbut they're still trying to do their\nbest right they're still going out there\nand trying to save the world and trying\nto make a difference with all their\nflaws\nand they're working through their flaws\nin the background behind the scenes when\nyou don't see i've always thought of\nsuperheroes as our parents\nyeah they're just our parents like all\nsuperman is is our father who's trying\nto figure it out\nright yeah um but yeah man but no that's\ni i really appreciate it thank you for\nhaving me no so\nso great i know we probably went way\noverrun no this is perfect we we still\nhave we end every episode with the final\nfive which is the final five rapid fire\nquick fire oh god\nokay that's you can either answer in one\nword or one sentence maximum\nso no more than that i totally fine i\ndidn't i did not i forgot that we had to\ndo this yeah\nokay all right so question number one is\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nall right the best advice i ever\nreceived is from somebody who's\nuh who's very near to passing away\nactually he was\nhe's a very dear friend and i was in the\nearly part of my relationship with my\nwife and we were struggling because it\nwas not easy\num and he told me\nwhatever my emotions are telling me to\ndo\ndo the opposite if it's not coming from\nthe purest sincere place\nof love my reaction my emotional\nreaction to something\nis the thing that i need to run from um\nand that\nsingle-handedly i think saved my\nrelationship which became my marriage\nbecause our insecurities were triggering\neach other and everything that i was\ndoing was not working\nand i just wanted to like overcome it\nand push and uh\nand he sat me down he's like and he was\nand he's and he was a\nhe's a gong master and a martial artist\nand a meditator he would meditate like\nsix hours a day he said\ndo the opposite of what you're feeling\nwhen it doesn't come from love\nso his name uh his name is marvin so\nsending him tons of love\ni love it man that's awesome sending him\nlove too awesome love that question\nnumber two what's the worst advice\nyou've ever received\noh my god\nuh i can't think of one i've received so\nmuch to so many\nso many so much terrible advice um\nyou stump me okay that's cool uh\nyeah i i can't think of one here's what\nhere's here's what's coming up sure\nyeah yeah any advice another parent\ngives to another parent that's\nunsolicited\nokay good actually here's the answer to\nthe question the worst advice i ever\nreceived\nis unsolicited advice nice that's good i\nlike it okay good that's a good answer\nyeah\nokay i'm going to help any one time a\nguest struggles with that i'm going to\nbring that up yeah\nbecause it's not asked for and yeah you\nknow question three uh\nsomething you're trying to learn right\nnow\nsomething i'm trying to learn right now\nyeah something you're like wanting to\nlearn right now that you're working\non learning um i'm rewiring my brain\nright now via\nsomething called neurofeedback because\num\ni actually have a very addictive brain\nand uh and a\nand i struggle a lot with stillness and\nmy meditation comes from moving and i\nwant to be able like you\nto sit in stillness and meditate because\ni believe that\nthrough stillness and through quiet and\nmeditation\nas abdullah says the mysteries of the\nuniverse are revealed\nand so i'm really working right now on\nactively quieting my brain and sitting\nand uh and meditating that's awesome i\nlove it yeah question number four\nsomething that you're trying to share at\nthe moment something you're trying to\nteach something you're trying to give\num something i'm trying to\nteach and give is\nthat uh\ni really believe that service\nis the key to everything\num and and ambition and service can\nsometimes\nbe in direct conflict uh\nand uh and stripping it all down to the\nwise right\nlike why are we wanting to be of service\nso that's the thing that i'm really\ninterested in exploring and teaching\nright now is\nasking people to dig into why they\nreally want to do something\nlike why do you want to be of service\ngreat why why that\nwhy that the three wise i love that and\nquestion number five i've never asked\nthis to anyone on the show before but\nwhen are you and your wife coming over\nfor dinner\nuh as soon as we get an invite so i'm so\nexcited for\nfor all of us to hang out yeah me\ntogether i think a\ninto me at some point yeah yeah although\ni wouldn't be [ __ ] we should we should\ntotally\nbecause my wife and i are really\ninterested in we've had so many people\ncome to us\num about marriage yes yes and this idea\nof goals and thinking that we're perfect\nand all these things and we are\nconstantly trying to tell people that\nit's the opposite of that it takes real\nsubstantial\nuncomfortable work and we only show\nthe 20 of our lives that we want people\nto see\nthat we project and emily and i are\nreally really excited we're going to be\ndiving in and possibly even creating\ncontent around\ndating and marriage because we just see\nso many people that want it but don't\nrealize\nwhat it takes um and i feel like you and\nyour wife are similar there so but we\nhave to be careful because\nus together we're just gonna you know\nwe'll probably end up coming up with too\nmany things and we don't have the time\nto uh to do everything yeah no i love it\njustin you're amazing thank you so much\neveryone who's been listening and\nwatching\nif you got this far i'm so grateful\nthank you so much if you listen the\nwhole way through\ni appreciate it so much it means so much\nto us i'm guessing my prediction is\nmost of you will make it all the way\nthrough because justin is i won't\ntake it personally phenomenal to listen\nto i was\ni'm gonna go i'm genuine and i genuinely\nmean this i'm gonna go back and listen\nthis episode are gonna make notes\nbecause there were multiple times where\ni was like\nif this wasn't a conversation i wish i\nhad a phone in my hand to take notes so\ni wish i was writing notes so i'm gonna\ngo back listen again i highly recommend\nit\nso go ahead go and find three things in\nhere go and find one thing in here that\nyou can practice for the next week\nthat's what i'd love for you to do\nis find one thing in here that really\nresonated with you that really connected\nwith you and for the next seven days the\nnext month\njust try and practice that in your life\nbecause if you can make it relevant if\nyou can make it real\nthen you can just take one thing away\nand start implementing in your life that\nis where you'll make the biggest changes\nnot just posting the quote on instagram\nnot just sharing\nthe shareable moment but actually trying\nto live that every day so i highly\nrecommend that you do that\ni think justin gave us a choice of at\nleast 100\nmillion ideas that you could try and\nimplement so just try and pick one thank\nyou so much justin thank you so much\nma'am so grateful honestly yeah\nthank you man love you man if you want\neven more videos just
