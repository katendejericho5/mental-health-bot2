was going on\nright now and when you do that on a\ndaily basis\nit's not long before reality catches up\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thank you so much for\ntuning in every single week\nto listen learn and grow now you know\nthat i like diving into the minds\nof unique individuals people with\nincredible stories fascinating\nbackgrounds\npeople with insights that are going to\nhelp us understand how we can level up\nour\nown mindset now today's guest is gonna\ndo just\nthat today's guest is russ an american\nrapper\nsinger songwriter and producer he's also\nthe author of the usa today and wall\nstreet journal bestseller\nit's all in your head russ has made 14\nstudio albums in his career\nwith several of his songs going platinum\nand gold his latest album\nshake the snow globe came out in january\nof last year\nand debuted at number four on the\nbillboard album chart russ\nwelcome to on purpose thanks for being\ncrazy it's just like crazy hearing\nthose things out loud i don't know just\nlike tripping me out sometimes yeah how\ndoes it make you feel\nwell like every once in a while i unjade\nand i'm like\ni go back to being 17 and i'm like\nwhat's going on like\nit's crazy i'm super grateful i would\nhave your 17 year old self\nfelt if they knew that this was gonna be\nthe life you lived\nthey would have thought i was lame that\ni didn't do it earlier they would have\nbeen like\nthey would have been like took you to 28\nwhat a loser\nbut um nah like i'm one of those people\nwhere\nyou know when when people ask like\nartists or anyone like oh did you see\nthis coming\nit's like well yeah how else do you make\nit happen i don't even know how you\nwould make\nsomething extraordinary happen if you\ndon't have like an extraordinary level\nof belief\nyeah i feel like there's a difference\nthough between like seeing\nbelieving and knowing like some people\njust know yeah\nbut i think sometimes we believe but\nknowing is like even a deeper like it is\ni know right do you know what i mean i\nagree with that that's interesting\nbecause i definitely\nwhen i was coming up it was it was that\nknowing feeling it was\nthere was no doubt like doubt did not\nexist in my brain i knew that it was\ngonna work and you couldn't tell me any\ndifferent\ni feel like if we look at the world\ntoday especially what's happened in the\nlast 12 months but even before\nthat you see that there are a lot of\npeople who doubt themselves\nwhy do you think we do that to ourselves\nand how did you not fall into that\ni don't know if it's necessarily age or\nif it's\nexposure to outside chatter so when i\nwas 17 it was really easy to believe in\nmyself because there was no one saying\nanything like there was no haters or i\nhad nobody telling me you can't do it\nmaybe some friends like\njoking like oh yeah you're going to be a\nrapper producer but it's like you know i\nthink a lot of it\nis you you're born a certain way i think\nthe other thing is\ngood parenting my parents especially my\ndad always told me i could do\nanything and would like constantly tell\nme i was special\nand all those things and you know i know\nthere's people who think that you\nshouldn't tell your kids\ncertain things like that but for me i\nyou know i really commend my dad for\nputting the battery in my back and\nmaking me think i can do anything i want\nbecause\nthat's why i wrote a book i don't read\nthat much but i was like i could write a\nbook why not\nyou know so it's like i don't know man\nshout out to my dad my dad is like the\nconfidence guru\nso shout out to your dad yeah i love\nhearing about a positive like\nfather role model mine was more\ninteresting my dad was more aloof and\ndetached\ninteresting which actually helped me\nbecause it helped me craft who i wanted\nto be because\nright i didn't have any pressure from\nhim yeah and and so it's interesting how\nwe all\nthat's funny you say that because then\nit just made me think that\nthe other thing is is i was always super\nsuper\ncompetitive and i looked up to my dad a\nlot like he was really good at\nbasketball\nhe was super smart he could just like do\nany he's one of those people like he\ncould just do anything and like\nyou ask him any question he knows the\nanswer to it and since i'm super\ncompetitive\ni was like i have to be better than you\ni have to like beat you at basketball\nlike he would always beat me at ping\npong\npool like you know what i'm saying like\ni just was always so competitive so\ni think that really pushed me he used to\nchallenge me even with like school\nextra assignment projects where he\nalways loves telling this story i think\nit's\nslightly overrated but i'll tell it and\nhe'll be happy that i did\ni think seventh grade there was this\nclass wide or grade wide uh sort of\nlike extracurricular thing like oh\nanswer\n200 of these math questions online and\nyou'll get something\ni don't know and my dad just used to\ngive me a hard time about not applying\nmyself so just to shut him up\ni answered like all a thousand and like\nwon the whole thing but like he always\nuses that story as just sort of this way\nthis thing that i do where a lot of\ntimes\ni'll just do something to prove y'all\nwrong and prove me right\nyou know yeah even if i don't really\nwant to do it but sometimes that's\nenough motivation so i related to the\nmichael jordan the last dance thing\nwhere like\nhe would use any little thing to be like\nthat was enough for me yeah\nyou know what i'm saying like y'all\npicked carl malone as the mvp that was\nenough\nthat's how i be feeling i only need a\nlittle bit and sometimes i make them up\nin my head i'm like\nit's like a make-believe level of\nmotivation\nsource of fuel so yeah i've heard you\ntalk about that before like this idea of\nhaving some level of delusion yes and\none of my favorite people who had that\nand i've studied his life through many\nbooks and teachings is steve jobs\nand so when you read the life of steve\njobs steve jobs had something they call\nreality distortion field where he would\ndistort the reality he experienced to be\nwhat he wanted it to be now that can be\nvery dangerous\nyeah but is that like a real thing\nthat's like a psychological real thing\ni believe so that's for sure what my\nentire life was from like\n17. now you got a word for it yeah now\nnow it sounds good so yeah reality\ndistortion field so tell me about\nwhy do you think delusion is useful and\nwherever you also seem to be dangerous\nbecause i think both is well i think it\nkind of depends on\nwhat reality you're trying to create\nbut i do believe in you know i used to\nwalk around saying all my beats are a\nmillion dollars a beat\nand i'm a billionaire and i just went\nplatinum eight times these are all\nthings i would say\nlike that would have not happened and\nthey were insane me and bugis my best\nfriend who started diamond he put out a\num\na project back in 2011 and we called it\n2020 and i produced the whole thing and\nwe\ndid the entire album from the\nperspective of 2020. so it was like\nwe're on rolls royces and we just made\nmillions like it was\nall just distorted reality but it ended\nup becoming reality so i do believe that\nif you want to change your reality you\nhave to already believe that it\nis your reality but obviously if you\nlike are trying to do something evil or\nill-intent it's not gonna be great for\neveryone else\nyeah just before we started recording we\nwere talking about\nyou know being creative and being busy\nand you said something really\ninteresting you were just like you know\ni'm always creative i've always got\nstuff going on here and then you're like\nthere's some days where i don't\nyou know feeling lazy like walk us\nthrough that because\nas someone who's super creative who's\nloved for your creativity\nand how original your work is and that's\nwhy i've always liked you i've always\nthought your\nsound is very original and unique and\nit's hard to like be like\nit's like oh it sounds like that person\nor sounds like it's like oh no no this\nis\noriginal like that's where i've always\nresonated with your work tell us about\nhow that is something you achieve\neven though there are days where you\nkind of feel like i just want to sleep\nall day or whatever\nyeah it's tough because uh me and\nbowie's talk about it all the time the\nhighs and lows of an artist is really\ndramatic at least for me like i'll have\ndays if i go into the studio and make\nsomething i love\ni'm like on cloud nine like everything\nis great in my life\nbut then i go to sleep and i wake up and\nthat next day none of that matters\nlike i move on very quickly and and i'm\njust like okay now i need to make\nanother one but if i can't make another\none if that day i'm just not feeling it\nor i go to the studio and i try nothing\nworks i'm like this is\ni should just give up this is this is it\ni'll never get a creative\nsource you know what i mean and it gets\nvery like\nyou sink really low sometimes especially\nif you go for me i make so much music\nthat if i don't\nmake a song for four days i'm like this\nis crazy like what's happening i'm\ndepressed\nso it's hard but you got to just\nremember that um\nyou just have to have faith in sort of\nthe creator in the infinite and\nyou know i don't feel like i really make\nmusic i feel like i deliver it\nyou know because i feel like it when i\nhave those moments\nit's just something that's coming to me\nand i'm the vessel and now i'm just\ndelivering it\nand i'm executing it and i'm almost\ndiscovering it in the studio i don't\nknow if i'm creating i'm discovering it\nif that makes sense so you're not always\ngoing to be\nin that place where you're getting the\nmessage and you're getting the energy so\nthis is what it is just hard it's the\nwaiting time in between will make you\nfeel like this is it i'll never make\nanother song\nwhat makes you feel that i love what you\njust said about\ndelivering versus creating i i think\nthat's phenomenal and it's\nexplained really well what makes you\nfeel like you're in alignment\nwhere you can deliver versus forcing you\nto create like what are the things that\nlack of thought right yeah lack of\nthought\nthose times where you get into that\nplace where you're not thinking\nand you're just feeling and like i said\njust delivering\nlike i'm not even thinking about what oh\nshould i say this like you get the\ninspiration\nand you just execute it that's when you\njust enter that flow state and it's just\nspecial\nyou know but it's tricky it's hard\nespecially like i said as i got\nuh not even necessarily older just more\nvisibility\nthere's outside chatter now in my head\nyou know what people are gonna think i\nknow that i'm not just releasing it to\nmy friends anymore like\nyou know so it's it's become trickier to\ntune out everything but\num yeah man just try to focus on the\npresent moment that's like what the one\nthing that i learned this past\nyear was really like how do i slow down\ntime and i was like okay well the way i\nslow down time is to slow down my\nthoughts\nand the way i slow down my thoughts is\nto be present\nyou know you notice if you're just\nmindless and you're\nyou know you're making a sandwich but\nyou're thinking about oh my god what i\nneed to do tomorrow and\nwhat all of a sudden two hours passes\nright but if you really\nthink about like you know you cutting\nthe sandwich and what that's like and\nyou\nstepping on the grass and what your feet\nfeel like time moves really slow\nyou realize how slow time moves so i\njust try to do that i try to stay in the\npresent even\nin the studio you know i don't try to\nuh have my thoughts already beyond when\nthis comes out and this is gonna be like\nthis and how's it gonna go then\ni'm just like man let me just like\nactually hear the music\nand feel the music and just operate from\nthis place\ni love hearing you talk about this man\nbecause you know these are some of the\nprinciples that\ni'm constantly sharing in my work yeah\nbut hearing how it applies\nto a music artist in your career it\nbrings me so much joy\nyeah because it's practical it's real\nlike you've got\ntime pressures you've got you've got\npressures from\nlabels collaborations whatever it may be\nlike there are real\nlife pressures but when i hear you say\nthat and that's how you feel aligned\nhow did you get introduced to this work\nor this set of thoughts and beliefs and\nmindsets was it something that you had\nsince you were a kid or where did you\nstart exploring\nwith the idea of being present\nexperiencing fear\ndelivery the present moment is recent\nbecause you know what i didn't need i\nfelt\nalmost like i didn't need to be present\ni guess when i was coming up because\nthere wasn't anything pulling me away\nfrom the present moment\ni kind of only had the present moment if\nthat makes sense it was just\nme and bugis in the basement making\nsongs and that was it there wasn't\ntours coming up and videos you know\nthere was none of that so\nuh but as this past year and past couple\nyears have been happening i got into the\npower of now book and just\nsort of just the whole ideology around\njust being present\nstarted reading more into that whole\ntheory and i just\ni bought you know i bought into it a lot\nof this stuff people don't\nrealize that a lot of the stuff like the\nteachings the self-help stuff\nyou have to be open to receiving it you\nknow and if you're not open to receiving\nand you're not willing to buy into it\nthen i\nyou know i hear you but god bless you\nknow i can only tell people it works for\nme\num but it worked for me you know being\npresident\nyeah i love that you mentioned the power\nof now and then when you talk about flow\nstate\nyeah for anyone who's listening if\nyou've not read that book it's a\nbrilliant book as well\nflow state yeah it's called flow and for\nanyone who doesn't know\nflow the way it's defined in that book\nis where\nyour skills meet your challenge exactly\nso i told you i saw like a youtube video\nyes that was like enough for me i should\nread the book though yeah no no no but\nyou brought it up and it's\nit's a brilliant concept and you're\nreally experiencing that because most\npeople it says\nexperience when their challenge is above\ntheir skills and so they feel\nfrustrated disappointed when they give\nup yeah all their skills are above their\nchallenge and then they feel bored\nbecause they actually have more skills\nthan what they're trying to achieve and\ni think that's\ni fell into that a little bit which is\nwhy i started working with outside\nproducers because\nit was so easy for me to just like go\ndownstairs\nand make like a rust song you know like\nhave a million beats i can make it be\nboom do this it's like alright cool\nwhatever\nyou know but it kind of i got into like\na rut creatively because i was making\nsongs\nbut i was like i don't even it just\nwasn't even that fun you know\nand i think it was because it wasn't\nthat challenging anymore so\num i started working with outside\nproducers where it was like okay this is\na bit of a challenge and then further i\nstarted trying to get\non beats even if no one hears them i\nstarted to get on production\nthat i don't like in a sense\nalmost to just be like can i make a song\nout of this wow\nyeah just like because i got the studio\nin my house and i don't need anyone to\nrecord me so i can just be down there\nlike experimenting so\nthere's been beats that producers send\nme and i'm like i don't like this at all\nbut i wonder if i can make a song out of\nit and it becomes this cool little like\nfun project and a lot of times\nit's turned into songs that i'm like\nthis is crazy\nwow like i get so much more fulfillment\nout of it\nbecause i couldn't see it coming a lot\nof my songs i'm like\nbefore you know when i'm making the beat\ni already know what the whole song's\ngonna sound like\nand most of those usually end up being\nvery successful so i'm not gonna\ndownplay them\nbut it does make the process not as\nuh on an easter egg hunt yeah yeah yeah\nso yeah yeah i love hearing that because\nthat's putting yourself in an\nuncomfortable situation right\nand most of us avoid that yeah yeah most\nof us just want to hear a beat and feel\nsomething straight away\nright we'll see because people are\naround other people i would never\ni would probably never do that if there\nwas people in the studio yeah with me\nlike\nactually out of all the beats you played\ngive me the one i don't like and i'm\njust gonna\ntry to make something you know what i\nmean yeah i like that's why\ni always tell people whatever your craft\nis make sure you have it in your house\nif you can because those\nmoments of solitude when you can kind of\njust be weird\nand you know experiment and dance around\ncrazy and be nuts\nthat's where you're really gonna you\nknow i have a i have a line where i say\nthe public praises people for what they\npractice in private\nyou know so uh i just feel like\nthat's when you gotta hone in on\neverything is what you're doing in\nprivate so i like when i'm by myself in\nthe studio i'll be getting weird\n[Laughter]\ncan you tell us what's the weirdest\nthing that's ever happened\ni mean it's not that weird but it's like\nwhen i'm by myself i'll put on a beat\nthat i'm like i don't even know what i'm\nabout to do on this and i'll just put\nthe auto-tune all the way up\nand go stand in the booth for 60 takes\njust wailing\nand just making noises and i'll be like\nthis is\nwild or this is trash but this was\nreally cool you know like i sent my\nmanager some song i did\nuh where i made a beat and i just put\nthe auto tune on full blast and just\nfreestyled the whole song and i was like\ni just had to get it out yeah but it was\ncool\nbut like i would never put it out but it\nwas awesome this is so inspiring i i\nthat's i love that approach yeah it's\njust\nit's so refreshing hearing that it's a\nrefreshing process\nyeah you know because you get so rigid\nwith like your process and this is what\ni do and we sit here and i make this\nkind of song\nit's like every once in a while you have\nto shake the snow globe that's where\nthat whole\nconcept came from you have to just you\nknow it's like the tin man\nand was it like turn the auto tune up\nand put on some crazy heat and let me\njust be a maniac for an hour it breaks\nthe formula\nyou work in this formulaic yeah\nproduct line manufacturing and you don't\nyou can't manufacture greatness\nthat's from school yeah that's from\nschool school is such a factory\nsetup you know how were you at school\nwhat kind of i was incredible at school\nto be honest\ni'm not even a lie i was i was like i'm\nreally not\ni was not one of those like yeah i\nstruggled in school and it was difficult\ni was really really good at school\nbecause i wouldn't apply myself but\ni was definitely the kid who like didn't\nstudy never did homework\nbut i would get a's and b's on all the\ntests and so everyone was just like\nbut i would be like you know i was\nsecond i always say this and it's not\neven something i'm necessarily proud of\nbut it just gives context but\nlike a senior superlative i was like\nsecond for most likely to make a teacher\nretire\nbecause i was just the kid in class like\nconstantly talking distracting people\nchallenging the teacher but i had an a\nin the class so i was just super\nannoying\nwhich i know is a surprise to so many\npeople\nand so tell me go back to the point you\nwere making before before i interjected\naround\nwhy you think that factory yes well yeah\nbecause you know you're\nyou have an expiration date as a kid in\nschool\nyou got to be out by a certain time in\nhigh school whatever age it is\nuh go to this department of the building\nwhen the bell rings you know what i mean\nit's just very like\nlike there's no creativity in there you\nknow that's why i'm really big on having\narts\nin schools and you know just because\notherwise you just i don't know just\nlike creates these robots\ni love that you break the mold how do\nyou get to a point though where you've\nwhat i find fascinating already your\nprocess is fascinating to me what i find\nmore interesting though is that your\nyour ability to trust yourself yeah when\nyou come up with something insane\nbecause very few people ever allow\nthemselves\nto do a wild card thing right now when\nyou do a wild card thing in the studio\non your own\nand you discover something like a sound\nor a auto tune or whatever it is\nand you discover a a b or a sound that\nyeah oh i like this\nhow do you then trust yourself\nto go with that when now when you play\nit to someone they might be like all\nright you're crazy russ like this is\nnever gonna work\nhow do you then approach that it's that\nlevel of it's that stain of confidence\nthat's\njust you can't remove i just still oh\nlike nas has this quote\nin an interview i believe where he said\nif it doesn't scare you you shouldn't\nput it out\nso i've always kind of like kept that in\nthe back of my head\nyou know i usually move with that and\ni'm\nand i'm cool with that and i like that\nwith my fans what i've created\nis this trust and this unpredictab\nun predictably unpredictable sort of\nrelationship where they know they can\nexpect me to be\ndoing the unexpected meeting they know\nit might be raps they know it might be\nsinging but they don't know what it's\ngoing to sound like but they know it's\ngoing to be me\nand so i think i've done a very good job\nat painting\nmy canvas and kind of giving people who\ni am so it's allowed me a lot of\ncreative\nfreedom i always tell up and coming\nartists like when you're coming up you\ndon't want it then\nthis is my opinion when you're coming up\nand you're building your fan base\nyou're conditioning them to expect a\ncertain thing\nfrom you a certain sound or whatever and\nyou're\nyou're creating this creative window a\nlot of people if you just come up\nonly rapping right you get your whole\nfan base off of only rapping\nlet's say you know you just you haven't\nreally fully tapped into you yet and now\nyou want to start singing\na lot of fans are going to be like you\nswitched up what are you doing did it\nand you know you could lose a lot of\npeople and they might think that you're\nchanging when really the whole time\nthat's been you you just didn't have\nenough time to discover it\nso i was really proud of myself that i\nwas able to kind of\ngive people the whole scope of my\ncreativity so that\nwhen i do go left field no one's going\nto be like what are you doing\nbecause it's kind of like oh yeah that's\njust being russ like we know that\nsometimes he's giving us red sometimes\nit's yellow sometimes it's\norange whatever you know that's kind of\nwhy i did the artworks all like that too\nyeah just to let you know that all my\nmusic is all different colors it's not\njust\none just spending this time with you\nalready and even when you came in and\nstuff like you're someone who's\nwho's very comfortable in their own skin\nbut at the same time you're not\narrogant and egotistic did everyone hear\nthat\nyeah i'm just that's a first you know no\ni agree too i think i fought into the\nown narrative\nhe doesn't have an ego i don't know no i\ndefinitely haven't no i mean in the\nsense of let's yeah let's talk about ego\nfor a bit because\nand and i mean in a good way i was\nsaying as a compliment that\ni feel that you have a very uh\nyou know what from what i'm hearing or\nat least and i'm only basing on this\nconversation i've had with you but\nit's like there's a stability between\nlike knowing you want to learn more and\nbe better\nyeah but you are confident about who you\nare and where you are which is which is\na beautiful\nplace to be by the way thank you who\ndoesn't want to be between those two\nthings\nyeah uh how have you tempered\nthat ego that we all have\nwith the desire to learn and grow and\nrealize there's more to go\nbut i'm really happy with what i've done\nbecause that's what i'm hearing\nyeah but i want to kind of break that\ndown for people because i think a lot of\npeople\nlive in either extreme either they're\ncelebrating their last win\nright for like seven years right or\nthey're just like i'm the worst i'm\nnever gonna win i'm never gonna win and\nthey don't appreciate where they are\nyeah i think for me to be honest despite\nperception or whatever\num i had to hype myself up i had to be\nthe biggest believer\nof myself that's the only reason why any\nof this worked and i think that\nand because i'm very vocal about it\nbecause i'm putting it out into the\nuniverse so that it comes back\nit could come off like i think\ni have nothing left to learn and no\nnobody can offer me anything and i know\nit's like no y'all just don't know what\nself-belief sounds like clearly\num you might know what it looks like and\nsome people are just more\num quiet about their self-belief just to\nget people to like them otherwise you\nget kind of my perception but\num but no i've always still been a\nmassive fan of people\nand a massive just supporter of anything\ndope anyone\nanyone that knows me from when i was\nnothing to\nnow from two years old to now like if\nyou're dope at anything\ni'm always the first person to like root\nfor you\ndm you send you advice like bro hit me\nanytime\nand even just looking up to people i'm\ni'm a fan out i'm like yo you're\nincredible i would love to work with you\ni'm that person too so i don't know i\njust\nthere's it's the duality you are able to\nhave the utmost confidence in yourself\nwhile still\nalso knowing that okay but this person\nis really dope too\nand if we come together it could be\nreally fire i'm just really confident in\nmyself\nand so i'm not desperate to reach after\ncollabs and things like that but it\ndoesn't mean i don't think that\ni know everything and you know i'm\nalways asking all my like my engineer\nfriends like yo what plug-in is that\nlike\nthis is crazy oh you're fired you know\nwhen people guess\nyou could ask even like kid super when i\nfirst met him the dude who made this\nsweater\nuh he did my gypsy video years ago like\n2014\nand when i first met him he thought i\nwas hella weird because\nor like socially awkward because i kept\ngiving him\nmad compliments because i was so it was\nlike my first\nreal kind of video ish even though it\nwasn't like some big production but\ni was just so enamored by the process\nand i thought it was so dope\nthat i'm just like that's who i am i'm a\nvery complimentary\nperson and like i'm always gonna give\npeople their flowers and he was just\nlike i'm like nah i genuinely feel like\nthat so i don't know i've always been\nable to\nhave that level of duality yeah i love\nthe idea of that that paradox like it\nfeels like uh\nit feels like it's not allowed like it\nsounds like it should\nnot be possible to think both those\nthings\nyeah but actually that's where all the\nmagic happens i agree right like that\nyou\nwe always think no you have to choose\nyou have to decide or you're either raw\nbut actually hearing you say that\nyeah actually i i think both those\nthings yeah uh i i love that and i love\nhow that doesn't stop you from\nappreciating others\nyeah uh who was it that appreciated your\nsound\nearlier on that you think made a\ndifference to you and\nand may you know guided you or was it\njust you for yourself it was me and\nprobably bugis\nlike uh you know for the longest time it\nwas just bugis wrapping and me producing\nand that was uh my closest example\nof like someone who i thought had really\ngood taste\nand i trusted their opinion artistically\nso\nwhen bugis gave me the green light to be\nlike yo yeah you should rap\nit was just kind of like okay well game\nover for everyone else like if bugas\nthinks it's tight\nyou know so and that's how it still is\nlike\num you know you it's it's important to\nhave\nyou only need one but it's important to\nhave at least one person who\nbelieves in you sometimes almost more\nthan you and\nand there is no jealousy or weird\nuh you can't win because then i won't\nwin like it's a very weird thing so\ni always you know commend boogies for\nbeing like the best friend you could\nhave\nin something that i'm doing you know\nwhat i mean yeah let's talk about that\ni like what you brought there about men\nspecifically like and you took me\nstraight back to like my teenagers where\nyeah i'd be best friend with a dude and\nhe'd be like my brother\nbut then we'd go out and he'd be like\nall right let's see you can get more\ngirls today right like that would be his\nmentality or like well like oh let's see\nwho\nwho'll be better at the sport today and\nit was every time i've realized that\neveryone in my life or\nmale relationships if every time a guy\na friend of mine has tried to turn a\nfriendship into a competition\nyeah they haven't lost it in my life\nyeah like they're no longer in my life\nbecause i just wanted to be friends\nwell now don't get me wrong me and\nboogie is dumb competitive okay\nexplain we played basketball together\nlike anything me and boogies will turn\ninto a competition for sure\nbut when it comes to a dream you're\nfollowing after like\nit's never like yo how many streams did\nyour song do bro you know what i'm\nsaying\nit's never been that how do you build\nthat balance what is it about him and\nwhat is it about you that allows you to\nbuild\nthat kind of a friendship because i\nthink that's rare yeah i do especially\nin today's social media world\nstream world i mean followers views\ncomments engagement all this stuff that\nwe all talk about\ni think we're both trying to do the same\nthing you know and we're both\nuh we were both real friends before all\nthis\nand we both understood you know we read\nnapoleon hill\nso we understand the power of a\nmastermind and we just\nas big of egos as me and him have we\nnever let it get in the way\nof like supporting one another and any\nof that you know\nso i don't know i just think it comes\ndown to the person like\nhow real are you you know some people\nare just fake this is what it is\nyeah yeah no and that and that idea of\nbeing able to have at least even one\nperson just one that's all you want you\ndon't need\nyeah because sometimes we try and we\nwant ten or twenty like that\nand you're right for most of us we're\nlucky to have one yeah and that's\nthat's a good enough start you mentioned\nnapoleon hill and mastermind\nwhen what age were you when you read\nthat book 17. bugis gave me the book\nso bugis was putting me on to a lot of\nthat stuff he put me onto napoleon hill\nhe put me on to the alchemist um\nyou know so that's the thing we weren't\njust like the\ni would say the like typical 17 18 year\nolds you know\nhanging out we graduated high school 17\nand we just were locked in the studio\nfrom then until now\nyou know so it was a lot of\nself-discovery but\nout the gate and once we left high\nschool we were reading those books so it\nwas just kind of like\nwe were ready to go mentally like we\nread those books and we\nwere both the kind of the kind of people\nthat\nwe buy into something quick and then we\nlatch on to it and then that's that\nyou know if that's what we believe you\ncan't tell us anything different\nyou know like if i'm go i went vegan for\na year because i\nwatched one documentary and like that\nwas that like once something clicks in\nmy brain\ni'm done you know i mean like right now\ni haven't had bread or grains\nin two weeks because i just like woke up\nand it clicked like my brother\nnutritionist told me and i latched on to\nhim boom that's it\ni've like me and him have always been\nvery good at just\nonce we decide something that's what it\nis he lost a bunch of weight\nyou know 30 40 pounds because he just\ndecided i'm done you know so\nonce me and him decided this is what we\nwere doing with our lives there was no\nyeah but maybe we're not doing it with\nour lives or if\nthis was it and we were both fully\ncommitted and every day and every like\nevery second of our lives was committed\nto this you know\nthat requires such a level of discipline\nto like make a choice and to stick with\nit\nand i find like that's something a lot\nof us struggle with today\ni'm terrible at discipline and i've\nalways been terrible at work ethic\nbut then i realized that it was the work\nand not\nmy work ethic it was the work you know i\ndidn't have good work ethic in school\nbecause i didn't like the work it's not\nhard to get up and do something you love\nevery day\nand i think i think people get judged\noff their work ethic\nincorrectly because they get judged\ntheir work ethic is judged off of\nhow well and how consistent they're\ndoing work they don't enjoy\nhow can you how can you judge somebody\noff of that yeah judge me off of\nyou know what i love that's how i can\nreally tell if you're about it or not\nlike\nyou say you love this you say you love\nbasketball and i know you do\nbut you just you're not putting in the\nwork that's how i know you're not really\nabout it now i can judge you accurately\nbut if you're like if you're a\nbasketball player and you love\nbasketball but\num you know somebody's judging you off\nof how well you do\nuh paintings and every day you're in the\nart studio that's not even fair\ni love that what do you think is the\nmost difficult thing you've been through\npersonally\nlike what's been a moment of time in\nyour life where you felt\nyou were really battling with something\nto overcome it 2018 was pretty rough for\nme\nuh just because when i was 17\nand i had this\nvision of what my life was gonna be and\nwhat it was going to be like to be\non and successful and a musician and\nmoney and fame and whatever\nuh i had this very innocent like\njust the world is made out of like\nmarshmallows and cotton candy\nperspective on it you know\nand when i got on it started off like\nthat but then it very\nquickly turned and i got this very nasty\nside of like fame where there's a lot of\nnegativity\nand hate and narratives and things that\nare out of your control and things that\nare so frustrating trying to fight\neverything because i'm\ni'm a fighter you know and i'm\ncompetitive and i don't i don't like\njust rolling over\nso this isn't a broken version of\nsuccess this just\nis success this comes with it too i\ndidn't like\ni didn't plan for that i thought like\nonce you get on everything is perfect\nand everything is fine because that's\nwhat you think when you're 17. so\num that was tough just like the dose of\nreality of like\noh okay this is not what i thought it\nwas gonna be\nbut that has to be okay because this is\nwhat it is\nthat's such a brilliant thought that you\njust said that it wasn't a\nbroken version of success that just was\nsuccessful\nand it's so interesting because you're\nso right that when we're teens\nwe think we're going to get to a place\nwhere it doesn't matter and even now\ni think a lot of people look at people\nlike yourself and other people that we\nboth\nmay know in our lives and people just be\nlike oh yeah but that that person's life\neverything probably just works out just\nthe way that well that's well like\nthat's what's so frustrating right is\nthat people on the outside looking in\ntheir response to everything any famous\nperson is going through is\nyou have millions of dollars why do you\ncare about anything it's like what do\ny'all think money is\naccording to most people's theory once\nyou\nhave fame and money\nyou have no emotions that's it\nyou're no longer a human is what you're\ntrying to tell me i shouldn't feel\nsadness\ni shouldn't feel anything because i have\nmoney\nand fame it's like okay let's run with\nthat\nfine i'll buy into that for the sake of\nthe conversation\nhowever if you're telling me now that\nbecause of money i'm above\ncertain human emotions then you're\ntelling me i'm above you\nso now when i act like i'm above you\ndon't now also come back and say why are\nyou acting like you're better than me\nwell you just told me i'm better than\nyou because i don't even have the same\nemotions you have\nso which one is it am i better than you\nor do i experience the same emotions as\nyou\nit can't be both that's why i encourage\npeople on the outside looking in to just\nshut up you know it's like\nin a i'll take a more compassionate\nempathetic line but yes\nin the same idea of yes like the idea of\ni love the way you explained that i\nthink it's it's a great way of cutting\nthrough the noise\nyeah because it's it's so easy because\nalso when we think someone is\nsafe yeah from human emotion because of\nmoney and fame\nthen we think when we get money and fame\nwe will also be afraid\nof human emotions so and you're in for a\nrude awakening right exactly we're\nprojecting it on to you but then you're\nsetting the same standard for yourself\nyeah of i hope and i and literally i've\nheard\ni think every person who's rich and\nfamous will say the same thing\nit's just like hey this is this is what\nit really ended up at it's going\nstraight\nno no and it doesn't matter what any\nrich and famous person says\neveryone on the outside looking in won't\nbelieve it yeah they'll be like nah that\nwon't be me though\nyeah it's like you know what i hear you\ni was there too but\nyou know i think i think the beauty of\nunderstanding\nis understanding when you don't\nunderstand and i always say that i think\nthere's\nunderstanding and understanding that you\ndon't understand\nyeah like a lot of people need to accept\nthat you don't get it yeah\nand that is being compassionate yeah\nlike i can hear you but it doesn't mean\nthat i feel you it doesn't mean that i\nget it\nyou know that's that's it that's it well\nsaid man that is so true i\ni think that was yeah that's such a\ngreat definition of compassion that you\njust gave because i think even when\nit's even when someone calls you up and\nsaid hey my my parent just\ni had a friend tell me this my parents\njust got diagnosed with stage four\ncancer yeah\nit's like i i can't empathize i've never\nbeen in that position\nso i can't be like oh i feel you i get\nit right i have to understand\nthat i don't you don't understand i\ndon't understand that is\nunderstandable correct yes yeah yes and\nsometimes that's all\npeople are looking for in those moments\nis just like\ni just want you to be here and present i\ndon't expect you to get it\nyou know it's the people who try to act\nlike they get it that actually\nmakes you feel even more alone it's like\nwow you're really showing me that you\nhave no clues going on\nyeah and i mean when you're talking\nabout this time in your life the 2018\nwhen you're\nexperiencing success not broken success\nyeah\nin your words what are you\nlearning at that time like what is the\nwhat's\nwe kind of know what you're learning but\nwhat's your process of\ngetting out of it yeah of figuring it\nout even before letting you get out of\nit\nletting go of my hold on to what it\nneeds to be that was the ego\nthe ego was like it's supposed to be\nlike this though and it's\nit's supposed to be what it is you know\nand once i let go of all that and then\nthat's why i came out with shake to snow\nglobe because i realized\ni just needed to reset and unjade\ni was like man it is what it is yeah it\njust is what it is like\nit's it's what it's supposed to be and\nas long as i'm still operating from a\nplace of love and a place of wanting to\nshare\num i'm gonna be ai it'll be what it\nneeds to be\nyou know and that time is also what led\nto the book in 2019 it's all in your\nhead\nwhich it was all in my head a lot of\ntimes in my life i\nkind of sometimes accidentally speak\nthings into existence so i had the title\nof it's all in your head\nfor years like i always had this idea of\nwriting that\num from a positive standpoint obviously\nlike you know\nmanifesting and self-belief and all\nthose things but it's funny\nthat i had this title it's on your head\nright you're your own worst enemy or\nyour\nyour own biggest fan you pick whatever\nit is\nand then while i have this title 2018\nhappens\nand i'm losing to myself mentally\nyou know i had to snap out of it you\nknow so\nit was just one of those things where i\nneeded to like\nlisten to my own advice and be like bro\nit's all in your head now you know like\nbut now on the negative side yeah but\nit's a choice at this point do you want\nto fight everything and fight the whole\nworld or do you want to let it go\nyeah and was writing the book quite\ntherapeutic in that because i almost\nfeel like when you're writing a book\ncalled it's all in your head\nit's far more simpler to go inward\nbecause yeah\nyou're kind of dealing with topics and\nthemes that work for you what was the\nbiggest thing that you put in the book\nthat you felt was\nwhat helped you overcome and where that\nwhole book and\nespecially the process of it was like an\ninterview so i had this woman who would\ncome\nand she had the tape recorder and i had\nall the chapters mapped out\nlike what i was you know because it was\nall song titles so i knew what the\nchapters weren't going to be i knew what\ni was going to talk about\num i just needed somebody to help me\norganize all my thoughts\nso she would come with the tape recorder\nand just we would go chapter by chapter\nand she would say okay we'll talk about\nmanifesting what it means to you and i\nwould just talk\nand so it was really like a week and a\nhalf of therapy sessions and then we\norganized all of it together and i you\nknow\ndid my stuff and whatever and it was\nlike man this was\nit that's why i love that book because\nit's really me like that was me\ntalking to a therapist for a week and a\nhalf in a book i love it yeah\nand how amazing is that that people have\nthat accessible to them\nright because if everyone could have a\ndiary of them being in therapy\nright i think that'd be phenomenal yeah\nto be able to look back and\nand work through it you've mentioned\nmanifestation of\na few times and and i think you've\ntaught us some really\nin my opinion again very personal and\nrefreshing ways yeah we hear about the\nword a lot\nand randomly you're obviously someone\nwho believes it lives it knows it\nis experiencing it what is the process\nthat you have practiced for you\nthat has worked for you that others\ncould understand because i think\nthere's a lot of like misconceptions\naround it but for someone who it's\nworking for and someone who believes in\nit\nyeah how would you describe it it's that\nknowing thing you were talking about\nit's not necessarily just seeing it oh i\ncan see myself with money and then like\nthen that's it now you're gonna get\nmoney\nit's more so knowing it and also\nfeeling it and and not just like\nexcuse me not just oh like i said you\ncan see the beach house you bought your\nmom\nit's it's what does it feel like though\nwhat it do\nlike what does it feel like when you see\nyour mom's reaction to getting the beach\nhouse and can you\ncan you feel that can you feel the car\nturning the corner\nto the beach it's about immersing\nyourself in that feeling\nas if it was going on right now and when\nyou do that on a daily basis\nit's not long before reality catches up\nwith\nyour thoughts you know and like i said\nit just has to be something you\nbelieve and buy into this whole theory\nyou know if you believe that we are just\nthe universe experiencing itself and you\nknow we're all\nin tune and connected to the infinite\nand all these things\nthen you're gonna be fine as far as as\nfar as this you know method goes but if\nyou don't\nthen it's not for you you know and was\nthat the best thing you manifested\nthe beach house uh it was one of them\nfor sure\nbut just like this whole career man just\nthis whole life\nwas a complete uh product of law of\nattraction but also being proactive\ni wasn't just sitting yeah no you don't\njust like click your heels and\ngo back to kansas you know what i mean\nlike\ntell us about the work tell us about the\nproduct the actual like\nso we get it the immersion the feeling\nyeah and i know you're doing the other\npart too\ntell us about the strategy the the\nnetworking the\nthe yeah the actual skill yeah because\nyou have to have a skill right well\nskill can get developed\nyou know skill is developed i was not\nthe most skilled when i started at all\nall of it sucked so uh you know you\ndevelop skill through repetition and\nthrough practice\nand putting in the work but yeah i don't\nthink people understand that you\nactually\nneed to put in the work and be\npersistent you just also have to couple\nit\nwith a very positive mindset but\nyou know will smith talks about um\nthe concept of and i've like mentioned\nthis a lot like laying a brick a day\nuntil you have a wall you know i think\nhis dad took them you know the story i'm\ntalking about\nthey like did the break a day like how\nare we gonna build a wall and you go out\nthere and you lay a brick a day\nso i really resonate with that whole\num story and concept and i think it's\nreally true i think a lot of people are\njust focused on the whole bigger picture\nand like\nhow am i gonna be this famous musician\nlike i haven't even made a song yet\nit's like you're not supposed to be\nthinking about like all that to the\npoint where it's daunting and crippling\nyou're just supposed to you know what\ni know i'ma get that i can feel what\nit's like but in the meantime i'mma lay\na brick a damn or make a song a day\nor make a b today or find samples every\nday\nor study every day like as long as\nyou're doing something towards the\nbigger picture a small thing every day\nyou're good\nthat's real that's real and that's how\nit has to be built yeah everyone always\nthink it's like that\nthe wallet analogy that you're talking\nabout you kind of just turn up i was\nthinking about that one day i was\ni was looking out into the city of la\nand i was just thinking like someone had\nto think about this\nright i was in dubai recently i was\nthinking the same it's like it's just a\ndesert it's a no it's a bunch of ideas\nyeah and someone had to think about it\nfirst like they would have looked out\ninto like\ndesert yeah and had to think about it\nbut we don't think about that because we\nwalk into a city\nyou walk into ev like that's what i find\nfascinating is that every day you're\nwalking around in somebody's idea\nthat's how you know thoughts are\npowerful like we're sitting inside like\nthis chair was somebody's idea\nto make it look like this and the\ncushions to be this soft and\nthese shoes like you're just constantly\nsurrounded by other people's ideas\nand i think the really cool thing about\nfree will is contributing your ideas\nback into the infrastructure of what's\nalready going on\nthat's so powerful man yeah what you\njust said now is so powerful how\nhow do we how do we know if our idea is\ngood\nor is that even the right question i\ndon't think that's the right question\ni think i think is it\nserviceable you know does it help\n[Music]\nyou know is it just for you or is it are\nyou\nserving a bigger purpose that's why i\nthink music is really great\nbecause we're you know it's a\nservice for the world we're providing\nyou know big or small however you want\nto quantify it is on you but\nit's definitely a service that we're\nproviding and i realized\nyou know after i got money and fame and\nwhatever\num i was like man the whole point of\nthis like i had i literally said this to\nmyself\nthe other day in the shower that's where\nall my ideas happen\nand i don't feel bad i don't feel bad\nabout that because pharrell said the\nsame thing yeah\num but i literally just blurted out i\nwas like\ni need more money so i can help more\npeople it was just like a thing that\nblurted out\nand i was like i was like yeah that's\nthe whole point\nof all this i had this like epiphany i\nwas like i'm 28\ni made it the only thing left to do\nis obviously i keep making it but it's\nto help other people make it\nyou know and i just think that our goal\nis to just\ngive and i think there's a very\nuh misled sort of\nidea that we're supposed to be getters\nand i think um bugis actually mentioned\nthis concept to me\nabout being a go giver instead of a\ngo-getter\ni think a lot of times especially with\nmusic success fame\nwe're just thinking about what can we\nget you know and\nwhat can i get from the world when i put\nthis song out and so on and so forth but\nit's more so about what can i give to\nthe world\ntell me about a message or a piece of\nfan mail\nor an experience you've had with a fan\nor a listener that made you realize how\nimpactful music is on someone i'm sure\nyou've had some phenomenal\nand you know it's so many man to be\nhonest and i'm so fortunate that it's so\nmany but\nevery day people are sending me messages\nof you saved my life and\nyou meet people and they're crying their\neyes out because it's like you\nhelped them so much and that's you know\nthat's when you realize it's just way\nbigger than you\nyou know it's just way bigger than you\nand\nlike i said i think i'm just excited to\nkeep\ngiving to the world and i know that\ncould sound cliche and like\nyou don't believe that i'm actually that\ngenerous but it's really like\nyou know anyone around me knows like i'm\nalways\ntrying to help you know i'm always\ntrying to like\ngive people money or whatever just\nbecause it's like that's you know my mom\ntold me a long time ago\nwhen i first started getting money she\nsaid uh\nmoney is meant to change people's\nrealities and so if you have the ability\nto do it\nyou should so i get a kick out of just\nlike\nyou know i'll see a fan on twitter and\nthey're like raising money for like\ntheir dance program and i'm just like\nhere you know a kid will send me a dm\nlike\nyou know my mom's funeral and i'm just\nlike why not\nyou know and i don't need to post about\nit it's what you're supposed to do\nyou're supposed to give it back and i\nand i think i'm also a very big believer\nin not blocking the natural flow\nof the universe and i think money is a\nforce of energy\nand when you get it and you're just\nfocused on keeping it you're gonna lose\nit\nso i always get money and give it right\nback and i think that's why it keeps\ncoming in\nyeah i just give it away yeah and it's\ngiven in your own way right like i think\nwhat i love about what you're saying and\nyou're talking about the cliche of\ngiving to me it's you figured out\nhow you like giving yeah and and that's\nwhat matters for all of us because\nsome people are going to do charity work\nsome people are going to build schools\nsome people are going to\nsupport the people around them some\npeople are going to help yeah a person\non twitter or whatever who\nwho can't even pay for their mother's\nfuneral or whatever it is like you know\nthe point is if supporting\nin the way you can yeah and in the way\nyou feel called to\nyeah because that's all you have and it\ntripped me out\nwhen like i said when boogies brought\nthis concept to me\nand go give her yeah go give her and\nand i was like man\ni never fully understood\nthe complete reason why i got so much\nout of life already\nand he was like it's because you gave so\nmuch and i never thought about it like\nthat\nbut you know when you think about you\nknow i have more songs out\nthan some of the veterans in the game\nmost of them you know i got 500 songs\njust like the game i give to try\nlike i give a lot and i don't think\nabout what i'm doing i'm like i'm about\nto give this so i can get it\nyeah yeah you know i'm just like giving\nit because i naturally want to do that\nbut it makes a lot of sense that you\nknow givers get more than the ghettos\nyeah and even when you're giving and\nit's not even being loved or received\nthat way\nbut you continue to give yeah because\nsometimes it's easy to give when\neveryone's kind of like oh we listen\nthey give you the validation but\nsometimes you're just giving because\nwe'll see but if you're only giving it\nto get something back then you're not\ngiving me anything you're loaning it\nthat's what i always tell people like\nwomen i don't care who it is don't give\nme\nlove if you're only giving it to get\nsomething back\nthen it's conditional and it's not\ngiving you're loaning me love\nyou're only loaning me love for an\nextended period of time until i give it\nback\ni don't do that i give love and give\ngame and\ngive money and whatever it is i don't\nexpect anything back\ni give it because that feels like the\nright thing to do and it aligns with my\nspirit\nhow do you feel or how do you respond\nwhen\nyou realize someone just learned it to\nyou when you thought\nthat they were giving i expect most\npeople to act like that right\nbecause most people are like that most\npeople are out for self they're very\nself-serving\nand so i know that\nmost people are operating from a place\nof i'm not doing\nany favors and i'm not doing anything\nfor free and\nso i'm not really surprised i'm not that\nnaive you know\ni think you can be you can be naive if\nyou want to the point of like\ni really thought you were just helping\nme out it's like\nokay you know i don't assume anyone's\njust helping me out i\nlike you get in trouble and you get your\nfeelings hurt when you assume people are\nas kind as you\nor people you know not to be like i'm\nthe most kind person ever but\nyou can get your feelings so if you\nassume everyone is like you\nthat's when you get disappointed and you\nknow and you suffer and the whole thing\nwith suffering it comes from attachment\nso if you get attached to the idea that\noh well they're going to operate how i'm\noperating you're going to suffer\nyou know so i try not to get attached to\nanything really yeah that's the only\ntime people\nsuffer is when there's attachment\ninvolved yeah you know you're not going\nto freak out\nif a water bottle right here gets like\nburned or your table gets burned you're\nnot that attached to the table\nyou know so that's when you got to like\nchoose in life with your\nwhat's worth getting attached to which i\nreally think it's people and animals\npeople and pets that's about it you know\neverything else is pretty replaceable\nyeah off top of my head yeah i'm gonna\nadd people pets and purpose we'll add a\nthird one\nsure yeah people pets and purpose i like\nthat yeah but even the purpose it's hard\nyou know you get so attached to that you\ncan suffer a lot along the way\nif things don't go the way you want them\nthat's that's what happened to me in\n2018.\ni was suffering because it wasn't going\nthe way i was attached to and once i let\ngo\nof that attachment to how i thought it\nwas supposed to go i was fine\nyeah you know sure there's dips in here\nand there but for the most part\ni'm good yeah yeah i always say to\npeople you you get to where you want in\nlife just not in the way you imagined it\nyeah or when yeah or when you imagined\nit and that's the challenge right it's\nlike you have reality\nand then you have your projector screen\nup here yeah you're trying to make this\nprojector screen happen but but this is\nreality right now\nyeah and that's what you're actually\ngoing through just have faith that\nwhatever you want you're gonna get it in\nwhatever life you want you're\nyou're gonna achieve it but it doesn't\nmatter when\nthat should be irrelevant you know you\nhave you can't put\na deadline on your own success it's\ncrazy yeah\nit ruins people you know you know those\npeople that are

way\nand made it so\npractical yeah in your i've had to make\nsense of my whole\neverything like yeah you've really made\nsense of it like\nlistening to you i'm like wow like this\nis you know you can tell that\nruss is reflected and deeply\ninter internalized these concepts\nbecause it's really easy to say the\nstuff uh\nbut the practical aspects of it of how\nyou live it\nyeah is what's blown me away yeah i\nappreciate it well\ni always tell people being a musician uh\nit's such a self-discovery\nthing like you learn just so much about\nyourself and the universe when you're an\nartist\nand you're you know it's just i don't\nit's such\nabout like diving deep into the depths\nof yourself and discovering you\nand it's when you're making when you\nwhen you're the type of artist i feel\nlike i am which is\ni'm trying to talk about the truth i'm\ntrying to help people\ni had to kind of those self-help books\nand just kind of moving through this\njourney i had to\nfind the way to apply all this stuff to\nmy life in a practica\npractical productive way you can tell\nman yeah thank you\nbut yeah we we end every interview the\nfinal five so this is a rapid fire fight\nlive so you're gonna answer every\nquestion in one word or\none sentence maximum fire so that's for\nevery one of them easy for you you're a\nlyricist and yeah you know you've\nyou this will be easy for you all right\nthe

right i agree yeah good all right\nfifth and final question\nuh if you could create one law in the\nworld that\neveryone had to follow what would it be\nthe golden rule bro\nthat they teach you in fifth grade like\ndo unto others as they\nyou know what i mean if everyone had to\nonly treat people the way\nthat they would be treated i think\nobviously the world would be in a much\nbetter spot\nyou'd be much more conscious of like all\nright maybe i shouldn't do this\nbut the thing that's funny about that i\nalways laugh when people think they get\naway with\nsomething you did it there's always to\nme\ni believe the universe is seeing\neverything jay electronic has this line\nwhere he's\nthe universe is listening be careful\nwhat you saying it you know it's like\nyou might

episodes where\nthere were just so many practical\nexamples of\nnot listening to people's opinions\nfinding solitude for your creativity\nallowing yourself to be wild and insane\non your own so you can\ndiscover new things about yourself uh\nthe ability to balance\nconfidence with humility at the same\ntime i mean you've just been dropping\nbars the whole time i really like the\nway you framed all the\nquestions though cause it had me\nthinking in ways i wasn't like i never\nreally thought about the duality of\nthe ego while also being a fan and just\nbeing i never told anyone about
