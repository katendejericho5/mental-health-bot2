asking to rush\nyour way what does a show day look for\nyou like when I watch you on stage\nyou're bold you're powerful you're\nyou're so energetic your performances\nare so emphatic like how do you prepare\nyou're going on stage tonight how do you\nprepare for that from now till then so I\nthink it's um to what need is for\neverything uh few years ago and and\nnowadays I think before I used to just\ndo so many things at the same time and\nit was just this rough\nto conquer things and I wanted to reach\nevery opportunity do everything and it\nwas very like it was a lot for me you\nknow it was too much nowadays uh with\nwhen it's a concert day I like to just\nenjoy the day wake up\nmeditate listen to some mantras or do a\nmassage or something that I know that is\ngoing to put me in a good vibe to\nexchange energy with the people you know\nso nowadays I have have this thing in my\nmind that I want it to be a great\nexperience in the beginning I used to go\non stage just thinking about the result\nthe later what I'm going to get from it\nI wouldn't I wasn't just thinking about\nthe present moment of exchanging energy\nwith those people and nowadays I do so\nfor me it's really important for me to\nget to this place with a good a circle\nof white light around me you know and\nyou said you meditate what kind of\npractices is that you said you do some\nmantras what does that look like for you\nso I have a a a big circle of people\nthat help me I have a shaman a woman\nthat does\nconstellation a woman that does um it's\ncalled a I don't know how to say that in\nEnglish but let me try to English sizee\nthe word it's called a radionic table\nit's like you put some Crystals and\nStones and you do like a cing in in your\nin in your aura or something like that\nso I have these different people and I\ndream a lot so every time I wake up I\nknow what's about to come for example\nyesterday I woke up feeling this crazy\nexcitement cuz in the afternoon I did um\nKundalini session uh activation of\nKundalini and this lady from Brazil her\nname is sais and she does it online I do\nit in person too but I she does it\nonline and it's crazy cuzz your body\njust moves and it's just it's it's so\nspecial so I woke up yesterday feeling\nlike I was going to\nexplode it felt like my body was going\nto do it was so powerful and I I heard I\nI I woke up with this song in my mind\nthat I didn't know exactly what where I\nheard this song before and I was just\nsinging I was like I think it was in a\nyoga class so I called my yoga te\nteacher and I said yo have you played a\nsong for me that goes like this so I\nsing for her and she goes yes so she\nsent me the link and the name was heart\nchakra that meant so much to me because\nI woke up feeling like my heart was\ngoing to explode and when I had this\nsong that was the name so yesterday\nthat's what I did I I was singing this\nsong I did a yoga he was so special\ntoday I woke up different I don't know I\nI had\nsome bad dreams cuz when I believe when\nwe dream our soul they travel to\ndifferent places right and sometimes it\ncan be not as good place so I woke up\nfeeling weird and then I called this\nlady that does this uh con family\nconstellation with me so I said I feel\nweird and she was like okay sit down\nlet's meditate together so she guides me\nand uh she opens this energetic Circle\nand five minutes 10 minutes later I was\nalready feeling amazing again and I was\nlike oh it's so different when you are\nyou have discipline and focus on keeping\nyour frequency high and every time I\nfeel like it's not as high I do\nsomething immediately to make it better\nso for me to go in the concert I need to\nbe feeling on my highest you know yeah\nthank you for sharing that with us and I\nI love that so much because I feel that\nyou know if you're out of milk at home\nyou go and buy milk or if you're out of\nbread you go and buy some bread and I\nthink sometimes we overthink when we're\nout of inspiration or we're out of\nalignment or we're out of the higher\nfrequency and we're feeling a lower\nfrequency we don't realize that all we\nhave to do is reconnect or plug in again\nand that simply brings it back and I\nthink we overthink and we think oh God\ngo I'm not worthy of it or I'm not good\nenough or I lost it or it's left me now\nand we don't realize that it is\nsomething that we can recultivated and\nrebuild and regrow into and so I love\nhearing that today you w yesterday you\nwoke up feeling like this explosive\nenergy and today you woke up not feeling\nthat and that's kind of how something we\ncan all relate to I feel like we all\nexperience that 100% and usually when we\nwake up not feeling that amazing for\nmaybe maybe from things from the\nsubconscious or something like that we\nwe we're stuck in there and we don't\nknow what to do and we don't feel like\ndoing things and that's what happens\nwhen we go on a lower frequency we are\naligned with and I believe in other\nspirits and things like that we are\naligned with other spirits and energies\nthat wants you to stay there so of\ncourse you're not going to have the\nstrength to go there you know but it's\nimportant to keep it and to do it just\nfor the discipline and and then you're\ngoing to start elevating elevating\nelevating and exercises that can seem\nidiots idiotic but it's not like one my\nShaman when I told her she was like okay\nso you open your arms you do a circle\nand I was like doing all these exercises\nputting my my my arms up breathing doing\nit when I was done I was like Wow life\nis great again and it just takes you a\nlittle bit of of discipline to\nunderstand that it's in your power and\nsometimes we like to play victim victims\nsaying like oh a victim like some person\ndid this and that to me I feel bad\nbecause that person did this that person\ndid that and no you have the power to\nfeel good it doesn't matter what the\nother people do or the energy people\nthrow at you all of that is real and\nexists but if you're aligned with\nyourself nothing that the people do or\nthrow at you can reach you because you\nare powerful in control of your all of\nyour own circle of energy you know yeah\nabsolutely well for whatever it's worth\nI can honestly say that from the moment\nyou walked in and we interacted I was\nlike this energy is good so for whatever\nit's worth it's working I felt the same\nhere such a good energy here thank you\nbut it's it's I I definitely felt that\nas soon as I we met and we started\ntalking I was like oh wow this is I was\nso uplifted immediately through your\nspace so whatever's whatever's happening\nit's working uh walk me through what is\nwhat are some of the things that you\nstill find do bring energy down for\npeople or do bring our frequency and\nvibration down like what is it for you\nthat kind of feels that way I think\ncomparation to be compared with others\nit's one of the I think the most the\nmost important thing right now that\nmakes everybody go you know down because\nwe have the internet in our in our hands\nand we're there it it was made to\nconnect us but we're not connected at\nall anymore instead of connecting we are\njust falling apart and spreading\nourselves like and just\nbecoming judgmental and everything and I\njust think when we look at other\npeople's uh Pages Instagram Tik Tok\nwhatever instead of just getting an\ninspiration or like feeling happy for\nsomething you start comparing and\nthinking why I don't have this I should\nhave that my life should be like this I\nshould the and then you never get to be\nyourself because you're so consum\nconsumed by other people's lives and and\nchoices and then you think you need to\nbe this or or then you see another no I\nneed to be that and then you see oh no I\nI should be doing this and never you can\nget with yourself and be like what do I\nreally want to be what do I really want\nto do and dependent on all the other\npeople that I know or that I follow you\nknow and when we compare each others we\nare not being fair to us to them because\nwe are born in different stles different\ncountries different body shapes uh\nSociety has so many rules to follow even\nwith all the Prejudice racism the\nopportunities are not the same so you\ncannot compare somebody that is born in\na country that doesn't have as much uh\nopportunities structure with a person\nthat was born in a place that has 50\ntimes more it's super unfair there's no\nbalance so when you put yourself in this\nunfair situation I feel like your inner\nchild gets mad at you it's like a parent\ncomparing two brothers or a sister and a\nbrother that was were born in different\ntimes different situations they are not\nthe same gender\nand then imagine your parent doing that\nto a kid that's what you are doing to to\nyour inner child wow and then you feel\nsad you feel frustrated and your mind\nstarts because our mind works on the\npurpose of not letting us suffer right\nso when you start comparing your mind\nstarts creating this anxiety to think\nabout solutions for you to not suffer so\nfor me if I'm comparing myself with that\nperson what's the solution I should do\nthis and this and that so I can can get\nclose to it and for me it's it's too\nmuch and I used to be like that I used\nto compare myself the whole time with\nother singers and then I decided to come\nout of Brazil something that nobody was\ndoing I when Brazil we speak Portuguese\nnot Spanish I was learning Spanish\nlearning the culture learning English so\nwhy I was comparing myself to people\noutside or to people in Brazil that were\nthey were not even leaving Brazil I was\nI was uh putting effort in something\nthat of course I would need to step a\nlittle bit behind left leave Brazil a\nlittle bit so of course I cannot compare\nwith the people in Brazil because they\nare not putting they're putting 100% of\nthe time I'm putting 50 because the\nother 50 I'm here studying learning\nother things and I cannot compare with\nthe people that speak Spanish or or\nEnglish because they are in Spanish or\nEnglish they're not in Brazil 50% of the\ntime coming back to Brazil to give this\nand I have I had this always comparing\nalways comparing and um nowadays I just\nfeel like wow I was so I was so mean to\nmyself you know it's it's not fair to do\nthis to you you know and not even not\neven about the things that we can see\nwhich is like nationality\nor physical type but but also family\nkarmas family traumas you know past\nlives so many things that we cannot even\nknow how hard it is for me or for you\nit's just different yeah well said\nabsolutely I think you're so right that\ninstead of connecting we're comparing\nand we get lost in that trap and it\nfeels like a prison yeah and you kind of\nkeep going round and round in a loop I\nmean speaking of comparing you were\nsaying that a few years ago you before\nan event you would have been like doing\nso many things and doing all this and\nnow you're like well wait a minute\nactually I want to meditate I want to do\nthis what changed in two when my song\nwent number one in the world uh I worked\nso hard for that I was the first Latina\nfirst female Latin singer to have a solo\nsong number one in the world and it was\njust like I was everywhere everyone was\nlistening to the song everyone was\ndancing to it and then I got sick I got\nsuper sick and usually when I talk about\nthat people go like but what was it what\nand we don't know I just couldn't walk\nupstairs in my house I was super tired I\nwas super I wasn't strong I I couldn't\nbreathe well it was so many things and\nthen my bladder had issues and then I\ndid a blood test and it was like a lot\nof cancer indicators it was just a lot\nof things that was at the same time\nnothing but it was it was so crazy and\nthen um I tried everything I stayed in\nthe hospital for so many months and just\nseeing all this success and I was not\nhappy at all I was just on this in this\ninternal fight with my Duality because I\nbelieve we all we all have this Duality\nwhich is our ego with our soul you know\nand then I met this Shaman that she does\nthis method called a pregnancy map she\ngets all the information s from your\nmother's pregnancy when you were inside\nof her and then she understands the kind\nthe way your brain works the way your\nhow your soul your inner child suffered\nwhat are your fears your traumas your\nkarmas and then um I went to her Retreat\nfor 5 days uh no cell phone no no power\nno light nothing just nature a lot of\ntherapy a lot of uh crystals a lot of\nlike rituals that are actually like\nmeditation three times a day and then to\neat we wouldn't eat with knife and fork\nit was with the hands to feel what we\nwere eating the food that was planted\nthere and we could be part of it\nthinking about how this food was done\nthe whole process until it gets to our\nmouths and everything so I was there and\num this whole time right she she tells\nyou like things that you want to give up\nleave and things that you want to bring\nto\nyou and I was just um you know when\nyou're so focused on what people are\nsaying or what people are expecting from\nyou that you don't listen to yourself I\nwas kind of like that and I was\num writing like I talk too much I'm very\nlike\noutspoken I'm I just I'm always with\ndifferent guys I talk too much dance Too\nMuch I I'm very like extravagant I move\nmy hands too much I did you know when\nyou just look at what people say about\nyou and you just want to be less I want\nto I want to talk less I want to be\nless I'm too much so I written all those\nthings and then what I want I want to be\nbalanced I want to be calm I want to be\npatient because my brother is very much\nlike that and my mom it's fun cuz\nnowadays me my brother my dad my mom we\nall went on this journey together and my\nfamily too so they all do sessions of\nKundalini with me family constellations\nit's so good um but my brother was more\nof like a calm patient chill like my mom\nand I was very much like my\ndad dance\nparty as they bro they they divorced\nwhen I was one year one year old my mom\nused to be more connected and it was\nhard for me to understand when I was a\nkid and nowadays I super understand but\nit's not about nowadays it's about when\nyou were a child um she used to have\nthis connection with my dad with my\nbrother more and I had more with my dad\nbut he was out we didn't leave at to\nsame house so that was very painful to\nme as a kid um so I wanted to be like my\nbrother and I didn't understand that the\nfact that we are different is the\nspecial you know me as a kid of course\nand then I put all those things and I\nwas so confused and the character Anita\nand me as a person so different cuz I\nthink when when the artist is an actor\nit's easy for the audience to see the\nactor acting and understand oh that's a\ncharacter and I don't know how this\nactor is in life for a singer is\ndifferent because they see you doing\nthat on stage or speaking on\ninterviews and they think oh that's the\nperson yeah right they don't understand\nthat that's also a character that you\nmade to protect yourself that you're\nthat's your public character but your\nreal person is really different most of\nthe time times for me it was really hard\nand I was like yeah this Anita has\nnothing to do with me I I used to be\nchill I used to this very like mean to\nme again yeah in the end of the process\nmy brother went with me because I was\nlike I'm going to this place that I have\nno idea what it is I need somebody to\ncome with me cuz what if it's dangerous\nit was not it was great but in the\nmiddle of it in the end of it my brother\nwas like oh I'm so happy it came and my\nbrother didn't believe any of these\nthings right and uh I was like I looked\nat\nhim and I was\ndisgusted I felt disgusted because she\ndoes a lot of like spiritual it's kind\nof like let's say raiki but it's not\nit's it's more deeper than\nthat and I looked at him and I was like\nI'm\ndisgusted and then um she came to me we\nwere going to leave and she said how do\nyou feel feel and I said awful I think I\nwasted my time no way I was feeling this\ndark energy inside of me was so\nbad and uh she said okay lay down let's\ntalk and I laid down and she put my her\nhands here on\nme and when she did that my and we don't\ntake anything there right no drugs no\nnot micro dosing nothing it's just\nmeditation that's it and me as a kid I\nshowed up in front of me this girl just\nwith my eyes closed you know and it\nhappens inside of\nyou and she was looking at me like\nthis and I looked at her and I was like\nplease stay here there's a demon here\nthere's a\ndemon sing these dark energy around us\nwe need to protect ourselves and she was\njust looking at me like this\nand I was like yes stay here stay here\nand she\nsaid no it's not a\ndemon the little me the little me like\nthat it's not a demon you wanted to be\nlast active less this less that less\njumper less cuz\nI less expressive I am not less I am\nmore so if you want to be less I'm going\nto leave I'm going to let you here alone\nand wow I was\nlike oh my God no no no no no you're\nperfect you're perfect the way you are\nand I was just hugging like you're\nperfect please oh my God you're perfect\nand she was like okay are you going to\naccept that I like to jump I like to\ndance I like to talk loud I like to call\nattention cuz I'm amazing you felt\nlonely and I I survived I'm a genius I'm\nsmart I'm talented and you're not\nlooking at it they want me to be less\nand I was like no I want you to be\neverything you can be please oh God oh\nmy God oh my God oh my God and uh since\nthat day and then when we make pieces\nwith each\nother since that day I\nknow how to go there close my eyes talk\nto my inner sh child and understand\nwhat's\nwrong and hug her and and see and and\nask why we're not happy why what's\nhappening why are we mad why are we\nfeeling\nanxious and then she tells me and then\nI'm like okay let's get it done as\nadults that we are you know and\nsometimes we don't realize that our\ninner Childs can be so\nhurt that start doing things that we\ndon't like and sometimes we ask\nourselves why do I behave like that why\nI'm so mad or why I'm so childish\nsometimes and it's because of that and\nwe need to learn how to\nconnect and then after that I just\nstarted prioritizing different things\nyou know I started to\nprioritize my peace my time take care of\nme cuz I think people congratulate you a\nlot about your professional\naccomplishments\noh you're doing great you're doing good\nyou're doing great and then you just\nfeel like you need that to be somebody\nyeah you need that to be somebody and\nyou don't need I watched a movie these\nday and I love watching movies that put\nme on the good frequency I watch a movie\nthese days called becoming nobody I\nhaven't have you watched that really\ngood becoming nobody and um I I was I\nwoke up like some months ago I woke up\nfeeling and I watched this movie and I\ncame back to my frequency right away cuz\nyou know there are tools that can help\nyou with a song or a movie and um I was\nso there was this emptiness inside of me\nthat I felt like I could fulfill it with\nsuccess Awards streams\nalgorithms and these days a friend of\nmine from Brazil that she was like\nvery poor very like she used to struggle\na lot in life and then few years ago she\ngot everything she\nwanted um money everything success and\nshe texted me these days and I have my\nfriends know that I'm very spiritual\nnowadays and so they always text me for\nsomething what can I do I feel I'm going\nit's so it's funny and and I feel glad\nshe said I feel like I was happier when\nI had\nnothing and I told her I think it's\nbecause when we have nothing we have\nsomething to blame so we say oh I'm not\nhappy because I don't have a house I'm\nnot happy because I don't have money I'm\nnot happy because I'm not\nsuccessful so we just be like okay it's\nbecause I don't have that let's keep\ngoing yeah but when you have it and then\nyou're still not happy there's nobody\nelse to blame but yourself wow and then\nyou feel bad because you're like wow I\nhave everything and I'm not having\nwhat's going on what I'm still looking\nfor you know I got all the awards I\nwanted I got all the streams I got this\nI got that and now I still feel that I\nit's missing something yeah but it's not\nit's because we were doing these things\nnot because we were feeling good or\nenjoying the journey it's because we\nthought that the result was going to\nfulfill us on something that just\nwe we can do for ourselves yeah well\nsaid that's that's really powerful I've\nI've never heard it put like that that\ndifference between when you didn't have\nanything you had something to blame\nwhereas when you have everything you\ndon't have anything to blame and that is\nso interesting because I think people\nwill say like oh money doesn't buy\nhappiness or Awards don't buy happiness\nand it's like sure that makes sense but\nthe real thing is because we haven't yet\nfigured out what does give our life\nmeaning what does give us a sense of\nconnection ction and I guess that's\nwhat's giv you confidence now in your\ncareer at this stage to shift and create\nmusic from a place of I'm going to be\nbold I'm going to be authentic I'm going\nto be myself I'm not going to care about\nbecause I think at one point you were\nsaying I was reading your amazing uh\nhonor for you in variety and\ncongratulations on that it was\nincredible to see and I was reading you\nwere talking about how you know at one\npoint you did get really attached and\naddicted to all those things as you do\nas things are growing and things are\ngoing ahead and you said well now I\nactually don't feel that way I want to\ndo you think that's just a natural\neffect of having achieved so much and\nthen you think to yourself okay now I\nwant to do something more meaningful or\nno I don't think so because uh I know a\nlot of people that they still feel that\nthey need more they they they still feel\nthat it's because they are falling you\nknow say so they still feel like they\nneed more they want more so they want a\nbigger house a bigger car a bigger this\nmore this more that and they are not\nunderstanding what's the point you know\nthey feel like and I think it's because\nnowadays um the streaming the algorithms\nthe Internet it's just crazy how people\noperate nowadays um it doesn't matter if\nyou had the biggest success for five\nyears if nowadays you're not selling as\nmuch if nowadays you're not number one\nanymore and you were people got used to\nsee you number one many times or top 10\nmany times now you're not even going to\ntop 50 they're going to start saying wow\nthis person dead dead and I hate this\nbehavior of an industry to be like oh no\nnot hot anymore this person is hot now\nthat person not hot so that means\nwhatever this person did for these five\nyears I don't know it doesn't matter\nbecause now this person is not hot\nanymore oh cheesy oh bad uh don't\nassociate with this person uh this\nperson dead but if tomorrow\nthis person has a a success oh no it's\nsuper cool come on and that was driving\nme so crazy and I just understood we\nwere um depending on these people's\napproval to see if we had value or not\nand I did not want to be um uh dependent\non that you know it feels like you are\nin the people's hands and I don't want\nthat and I feel like we are only\nsuccessful and happy\nif we know that if I lose everything if\nI'm not number one number 10 number 100\nnumber\n300 I'm still going to be happy if yes\nthen great if no then you need to stop\neverything that you're doing and start\nworking on yourself to make sure even if\nyou lose everything you're still happy\nbecause then you're going to make good\ndecisions so I only um when I started to\ngo on this journey of understanding\nmyself and understanding that I was\ndoing things just because I was so empty\ninside and I felt like I was not good\nenough I needed more people's approval\npeople's love it was like a drug success\nis like a drug if you don't understand\nit's like part of life so when I\nunderstood that I was like I'm just\ngoing to do the type of music that I\nfeel like if I get 10 plays if I have 10\nmillion or a hundred I don't care I want\nto feel good I want to feel H feel happy\nalso I feel like everyone has their\nmoment God gives us the moment for us to\nenjoy this amazing and then we go to the\nnext to evolve on something else yeah we\ndid what we needed here oh great you\nkilled it got all the awards all the\nsuccess let's go to another thing no we\nget addicted because the people in this\nenvironment if you're not there anymore\nthey're going to say this person nah dad\nnot good and then you pay attention to\nthat and you're like no I can't lose\nthis so you keep doing all the things\nthat you were already tired of doing it\ndoesn't give you the same pleasure\nanymore but you keep doing it just so\npeople don't say you\nfailed so I was like you know what I do\nnot care everyone can tell me I failed\noh my God she used to be a success now\nnobody cares I care that's all that\nmatters to me I don't care if nobody\ncares you know there there's a I love\nhearing that there's a beautiful Zen\nsaying that you're reminding me of this\nZen saying says that letting go is hard\nbut holding on is harder and often all\nof our pain is coming because we're\nholding on to who we were holding on to\nwho we wish we were holding on to what\npeople used to love holding on to what\npeople validate what people approved and\nwe're holding on to that and not\nrealizing that Universe the god energy\nis trying to gent take us away but our\nholding on is what's making it so\naggressive and painful and that's when\nyou know if you're holding on to\nanything really really tight and it's\nbeing taken away it's going to hurt you\nand and I think that's what we all go\nthrough we don't want to gracefully\naccept growth and so we sometimes get\naggressively pushed out and pushed\nthrough it yes it's because I think\nSociety has taught us that we need to\nalways be\ngrowing but when they say growing it's\nnot inside it's outside so your house\ncannot be the same house in 10 years you\nhave to be moved to a bigger one a\nbetter one your job cannot be the same\njob even if you're\nhappy no no no you got to be bigger yeah\nbut nature is one thing we we come here\nand we have if we see how animals behave\nright they go to a tree the bird goes\nthere eat what's necessary for him and\nleaves the human goes there and gets\nwhat's necessary for him and let me get\nmore just to just to have just to see\nthat I have more just to show people\nthat I have more but then you're not\neven you don't need it yeah you don't\nneed it but the way Society taught us\nthat we need more we need to be every\nday bigger and bigger then if you go a\nlittle smaller in this area to go bigger\nin another area that people are not\nseeing mhm that doesn't it's not the\nsame value you know I chose now in my\nlife to I understood I went so big and\nit was so good I'm down to keep going\nand if it goes bigger it's cool if it\ndoesn't it's super cool too I'm happy to\nsing to the amount of people that I'm\nsinging now where if it becomes because\nI'm a little less crazy it's fine to me\ntoo because I want to grow in something\nelse it's so good when you do when I do\nmy spiritual things I feel so happy I\nfeel like nothing could give me this\nhappiness it doesn't end it's it just\ngoes and it goes that goes bigger and\nit's unfinishable you know and um\ndoesn't give you anxiety it just gets\nbetter better better and I'm like I'm\nsuper down to be less successful here\nand make more money less not more money\nmake like less\nmoney to get big in this other side\nwhich is inside yeah you know yeah yeah\nI always find that material language is\nbig and better bigger and better and\nthen spiritual language is deeper and\nmore impactful and and that depth is I\nthink what sounds like you're searching\nafter with was this the same time that\nyou were suffering with like\nendometriosis was this was this like the\nhormonal changes bad and then it was\nmore and then I found out there was\nthere that and then it was my bladder\nand then it was it was so many things\nand when I came out I came out of the\nretreat the cancer um levels in my blood\nwas not there\nanymore I didn't have anything it was\njust getting better and now I feel like\nI'm in control I do feel like emotional\nwhen we hold on to emotion and emotional\ntraumas and things like that it can get\nphysical you know and when I do like\nfamily constellations for example if\npeople don't never heard of it please\nsearch because it's so good um when I do\nthat I feel sometimes pain in somewhere\nwhile we're doing the the session I feel\nlike or my bladder or my heart or my my\nstomach and then when it's when it's\nover I feel like woo I cleaned it's\nbetter you know so I do feel like it can\nbecome physical for sure what what were\nthe biggest traumas that have stayed\nwith you that have come up for you that\nyou feel you've carried because you\nobviously grew up in the favellas you\ngrew up you know not in the easiest of\ncircumstances I think you mentioned\nyourself that you're almost treated like\ntrash in Brazil people in the so long\nand so like tell me about what are the\ntraumas you felt you've held on to from\nyour childhood that are now coming up\nthat you're healing now so there is this\none in\ninteresting situation in the path of\nthis healing thing there was this one\nthought that was always coming to my\nmind right I was here being Anita I have\nthree different houses I have everything\nI need okay if I want to retire right\nnow I can and I will live comfortably\nfor the rest of my life but all of a\nsudden I was just here minding my\nbusiness and a thought would come to my\nmind what if I get pregnant and I lose\nall my money and I don't have money to\nsurvive and then I need to uh work in\nthe streets to get food to my babies and\nto and I would be like why am I thinking\nthis why am I doing that\nwhy and then I did this session with um\nmy Shaman and she said this is not your\nthought you got this thought the same\nway we get DNA from our parents and like\nthe hair the eyes the body we can get\nfrom thoughts and energy behaviors and\nwe don't realize that so I told her oh\nfor real and then we did a session to\nclean this right to remove this from me\nbecause it's not mine it comes from my\nfamily so I did the session and I talked\nto my mom I said Mom have you ever had\nthis thought of like that you were going\nto lose everything we're not going to\nhave money this and that and that was\nlike right before my my birthday of 30\nyears old birthday so she said yeah uh\nwhen I got pregnant from you your dad\nlost his\njob and I felt like we were not going to\nhave money to feed you guys and I would\nneed to work in in houses as like a\nhousemate or something to buy\nfood and I was like wow that makes to\nand just spent the whole pregnancy with\nthis fear of not having the money to\nfeed us so she was fearing it and there\nis like I I produced a movie with a\nfriend of mine called me and uh it talks\nabout this the the thoughts the negative\nthoughts that your mom carries in the\npregnancy becomes um\nneuropeptides in your in your in your\nbrain so that's why you have these\nthoughts and I was like wow Mom and I\ndid the the session with the lady and I\ngot I never had this thought again\nand then I was doing my birthday it was\n30 years old so\nspecial and I I I had this place that I\nwanted to do in Brazil and for some\nreason every place I was trying it was\nnot available I was trying everywhere oh\nnot available because of this not\navailable because of that I closed one\nplace no not available anymore so\nthere's this one place just this one\nspot and I said okay let's go what can\nwe do it's the only spot let's go let's\ngo so I sent my dad the invitation sent\nto my dad I said oh Dad the party this\nyear is going to be here he was like oh\nmy god daughter this\naddress is a my dad didn't know about\nthe the talk I had to my mom nothing\nright and he's my best friend but I I\ndidn't mention\nhim um he goes oh my god daughter this\naddress used to be the company's address\nthat I got fired when your mom was\npregnant and I was like I'm dead wow\nlike we're here celebrating my 30 years\nold with the party like full of\neverything that we are always afraid of\nnot having that's crazy and the same\naddress that's\ncrazy where in life this that for me was\nsuch an answer from the\nuniverse right and I was like wow this\nis so meaningful and life is full of\nthese these situations that for mere not\ncoincidence at all yeah that's that's\nincredible it is that's really powerful\nand I love that full cycle moment agree\nand and and I love I mean the movie that\nyou made is that out where can we watch\nthat me the name is me my my a friend of\nmine the one that introduced me to this\nShaman uh she did it and then she called\nshe asked me to help her producing it\nand um sharing with the platforms and\neverything so I was helping her on this\nfinal uh touch of the movie and it talks\nabout this about how you can get\nHeritage from your parents not only in\nyour blood physical but also mental and\nkarmas that come from your mom from your\ngrandmother from because it comes from\nfather to daughter you know and um it's\nimportant to clean it to to work on it\nbecause otherwise we're here with no\npurpose\nwe're not we we get we spend all this\ntime here and we don't figure out what's\nyour purpose what are you here for you\nknow and I always had in my life this\num desire to understand and when I was a\nkid I was very like that already I used\nto dream a lot of about a lot of things\nmy mom tells me that I used to wake up\nand see people and um I was always very\nconnected I used to tell tell them\neverything that was going to happen in\nmy life you had visions of had you say\neverything I used to tell them like oh\nI'm going to sing here I'm going to do\nthis our house is going to be like this\nlike this I I used to give them details\nof everything and um my my dad he was\nalways very stressed with work and he\ntells me that I used to come to him and\nsay Dad don't worry in the end\neverything is going to be great you will\nsee you're so smart you're so cute\nyou're so nice in the end you will see\nyou're not going to worry about any of\nthis I'm going to be a singer I'm going\nto do this and this and that and it's so\nfun when he tells me because I was\nactually describing so precisely what\nprecisely what was going to happen yeah\nI mean you've it sounds like you've made\nso much spiritual investment in\ntransforming your mind your heart your\nenergy your space and at the same time\nyou've also made physical changes like I\nwas learning that you also were on birth\ncontrol and then you left birth control\nand I feel like even those types of\nchanges yes were linked to this kind of\ninternal change that was going on right\nlike walk me through how life has been\ndifferent when you were on birth control\nand then when you left like and walk us\nthrough that decision I just feel like\nit's not natural it was not natural you\nknow and I was just and it's not fair if\nyou stop to think why just a woman needs\nto suffer about about this situation you\nknow it's it needs to be a two people\ndecision and prevention and and Care um\nbut with the hormones was crazy because\nI couldn't be it was just never life was\nnever like this it was\nlike crazy to me and I don't get along\nmy body is doesn't receive this well you\nknow and when I started to accept uh to\ngo into more of a natural life also in\nmy my nutrition I try to eat vegan in a\nlot of moments not 100% I I I I made it\nfor two years and then wow it got yeah\nit was really good I I hope I can get\nagain in the future um but the more I\ncan I think if everyone cuts at least\n30% 30% you you can still eat but just\n30% less of animals uh food\nof and everything it's already so good\nfor the world you know and also for our\nenergy I understand it's hard it's\ndelicious I I couldn't I I made it two\nyears and I'm back but just 30% less\neveryone if we all get together in this\ndecision it's already a big shift for\nthe universe you know that's what I\nbelieve and it changed a lot to me when\nI started to care and and give more\nattention and and priority to this side\nof life cuz before I was just worried\nabout being more successful richer make\nmore money and what what was crazy was\nthat I wanted to make more money be more\nsuccessful but I had no idea how much\nmoney I had MH I didn't check my bank\naccounts and I was just making to make\nit I didn't even know nowadays I'm more\nchill but I know I check my stuff I take\ncare of it but I'm like okay I can chill\nI don't need a bigger house I don't need\na two different cars I'm fine you know\nyeah how was the birth control\nnegatively affecting you hormonally or\nwhat were you experiencing um hair loss\num and then the skin goes crazy and then\nthe mood goes crazy and then you get\nvery depressed in a moment and then very\nhappy and then very angry and then it's\nroll coaster it's a roller coaster and I\njust didn't want that and then and also\nyour\nenergy when it when it gets close to the\nperiod you have no energy I just want\nher to sleep all day it was just so bad\nand now I'm just stable I'm always the\nsame you can feel that difference I can\nfeel totally the difference yeah but it\nit it took from me more than a year to\nget clean from from birth\ncontrol it more than than a year for me\nto stop feeling the side effects yeah\nand it's interesting what you said about\nthat joint responsibility of\nprevention between two people but it all\nfalls on the woman yeah it's two people\ndeciding something right it shouldn't be\njust the woman's responsibility and I\nfeel like if it was the man getting\npregnant it would be very different the\nlaws would be different the the the\nbirth controls would be different\neverything would be very different and I\nthink people don't realize these side\neffects that you're explaining right now\nI feel like it's so common for women to\nbe on birth control but people don't\nrealize like how many other negative\nimpacts it's having in life whether it's\nmood performance yes and I think also in\nthe\nfuture maybe when you're older you're\ngoing to feel more and before I had I\nhad a coper IUD and uh it was so bad for\nmy ethers so bad it was just a lot of\nblood and it's worse for the\nendometriosis it was a whole thing so\nnowadays I just use condom they exist\nthey exist for reason you know I pray\nGod I talk to the universe I plan with\nthe universe when it's the time I use\nthe condom and let's go no no kid\ntoday I just I just um I can feel it and\nuh I think the universe when you plan it\nand when you communicate I communicate\nwith the universe so much I say okay so\nI want to do this this and that and then\nyou can send me the person that I\nbelieve that it's the good person to be\nthe father be the father of my kids and\nthen or the mother and then I'll be\nready to do it but I want this answer\nfor for me to start this I need the\nanswer the universe to give me that so I\nalways talk I write a lot what I want I\ncheck the eclipses um the moon and I\nwrite according to that and then I feel\nlike all of this are\nlike um natural safe rituals that you\ncan do that can only do good for you you\nknow and I like to take bath of baths of\nplants\nroses um where different plants that are\ngood for different I I love the\nindigenous um thoughts that they that\nthey have and and the the way the plants\ncan cure everything and also the energy\nso I use that a lot on me I do my own my\nown stuff yeah that's incredible I love\nit and and you've talked a lot about the\ndifference between your authentic self\nLissa and then Anita and what I want to\nknow what are the differences in your\nmind now as you've been it seems like\nyou've been aligning yourself like what\nare the differences now yes so every\ntime I do family constellations I don't\nknow if you know exactly how this\nprocess goes tell us I know a little bit\nbut tell us because good for this get a\ntherapist that is the professional she\nopens a circle of energy and then\nthere's a lot of people there right they\nknow nothing about your life nothing\nabout your going there to\ntreat so you just tell them you decide\nthe theme so you can say oh I want to\ntreat today I want to treat my anxiety\nor I want to treat depression or\nwhatever so I'm going give an example\nthere was this day I said today I want\nto treat self-love\nand then it comes for me right so and if\nyou go there and you want to cheat\nwhatever these people this 10 people\nthat are there they're going to get in\ntheir bodies the energy of the people\nfrom your family that caused your this\ntrauma in your body in that precise\nmoment MH so let's say you have um\nanxiety and then you say you sit there\nand say oh I have anxiety these people\none person is going to have receive your\ndad's energy it's not that he's going to\nreceive the spirit because your dad is\nalive your mom is alive everyone is\nalive but they get the energy and they\nstart telling you where this moment of\ntrauma was uh done designed draw like\nwritten you know so let's suppose it's\nbecause when you were 10 years old your\nparents divorced and they were not\ntogether they were fighting a lot so\nthey are going to talk as if it wasn't\nthat moment and then the therapist will\npropose like a a solution which is like\nmaking peace with each other\nunderstanding that's the best for your\nkid is to for you guys to understand the\nkid is half of each one and then you get\ntogether and you're just one right and\nthen you're good so I did it many times\nso with this constellation you\nunderstand the importance of valuing\nyour dad and your mom or not not buying\nthe fight of choosing one side because\nyou 50% of each one of that I'm 50% my\ndad I'm 50% my mom I cannot decide who\nwins the fight of their divor because\nthey are older they are adults I am just\na kid that are not the responsible for\nthat and I need to understand and be\ngrateful that they together did me and I\nif I start if I choose a part I'm going\nto be saying by to 50% of myself so I'm\nnever going to be happy I need to be\ngrateful so that's basically what\nhappens in the constellation so when uh\nwhen I do my constellation it's not only\none person that represents me it's two\none person always comes with Anita's\nenergy and the other was Lisa energy and\nAnita is very like like a\nsuperhero let's suppose if Lisa was like\na kid insecure and afraid of being\njudged afraid of not being loved if she\ndraw a superhero that's Anita the one\nthat goes there talk to people nothing\nbad happens to me I'm the best I'm the\ngreatest I do whatever I want and um\nthat's how it came to life um and when I\nwas becoming a singer I put this\ncharacter in real life the problem is\nthat I was working so much to fulfill my\nemptiness and when I was working I was\nAnita that I started to believe I was\njust\nthat and not value what I was as Lisa\nbecause I was insecure a regular human\nthat has regular feelings that can be\nsaid that can be hurt that can be all of\nthat so\nthat was when my balance went like\nthis and it's bad the other 50% cannot\nbe cannot feel like you're a show\nyou know it doesn't matter if you have\nanother one that comes out and\nsay I am\namazing the other 50% needs to believe\nthat cuz the other 50% was the one that\nthat create created this one you know\nfor sure it's the creature and the\nCreator both are\namazing so I needed to accept and see\nqualities in both of it and Anita was\njust like this crazy girl that comes\nthere and also comes from a place of um\nI was assaulted when I was uh a teenager\nand I had to speak about it because I\nwas afraid of someone in Brazil that\napparently found out I don't know how\nand I was I didn't want my\nmy SEC my deep secret to be\nspread not by me so I needed to talk\nabout it um and after that happened when\nI was a teenager I felt like if I was\nlike\nthis no guy would have would have done\nthat to me so I created Anita from this\nmoment of pain and and sadness right\nbecause of that I cannot feel like\nletting is less you know I'm just a\nhuman that has the same insecurities and\nfears and and the feel the the feeling\nlike half of me had of Anita that oh\nyeah that's the only good thing that was\nmaking me really\nbad and uh I also think that maybe\nthat's why me as a character Nita was\njust talking so much about sex about I\ndo this some times I I wasn't even doing\n I wasn't even doing not even 10% of\nwhat I was saying but I needed to carry\nthe person that person I was really\nimportant and that um that hurt me my\nother side for for because we feel like\ncome on I'm not do that's not real\nthat's not real why am I doing this and\nsometimes that would push me away from\nrelationships that I really wanted to\nhave and um\nI\njust and and at the same time this\nbattle would never let me get interested\non anybody cuz I was always feeling it's\nlike a subconscious thing I would always\nfeel like oh yeah I'm going to get hurt\nso I would never be interested on\nanybody or I would be for three months\nand then I would be like ah next next\nbattle next challenge and that's not\nhealthy yeah you know it's different did\nyou believe in right person wrong time\nat the time and now you have I believe\nin that\num I believe that when things are\nsupposed to happen they are going to\nhappen no matter when it can be now it\ncan be later it can come back so I don't\nbelieve I think that's more it but I\nalso believe that the things that\nSociety put in our head can mess up\nrelations all types of relations for us\nfor example\nI'm a singer I'm successful um I have my\nmoney etc etc if I decide tomorrow to\ndate a regular guy that I met\nin in a bar at a\nbar people be like uh that's all she\ncould get o oh my God Anita with this\nnobody G if it's a man a successful\nsinger rich guy meeting a girl in the\nstreet that works in a store or Works in\na bar or whatever they'll be like so\nnice did you see oh my God he met her a\ngirl she was a bartender oh my God and\nhe Val her so much oh so nice it's so\nsweet what a great\nman but if it's a famous\nsuccessful rich woman oh my God that's\nall she could get a bartender G sucks oh\nno no real man Val her U it's kind of\nlike you need a man on your level or\nmore to decide if you're valuable or\nnot so I think with Society and also\nlike for a man if you were with a woman\nmore successful than you they were like\noh my God you see the woman is so much\nmore and then it up this guy's\nself-esteem so I think it's um ying and\nyang situation that Society is not\nunderstanding that women can women can\nbe y or Y or you know yeah yeah yeah and\num I think that messed up with a lot of\ngood opportunities of people getting\ntogether because of society's um\nstatements yeah that's I mean that's a\nreally really interesting point and I\nthink there's so many versions of that\nlike I've met people are like oh well I\ncan't date that person because if I date\nsomeone outside of my community\nthen people will say oh he doesn't date\npeople in our community and or or vice\nversa and I feel like there's so many\nversions of that and the gender\nbreakdown you just shared I think it\nsadly is true and that's why we can't\nlive up try to live up to society's\nexpectations exactly we're always going\nto give away throw away Amazing Life\nopportunities yes I know someone was\nsaying to me they can't do a movie\nbecause people wouldn't want to see them\nwith a certain person and so people are\ngiving up huge career opportunities for\nthemselves\nbecause they're worried about what\npeople will think or what people will\nsay and I mean talking about that you\nrecently paid homage to Native Brazilian\nres religions in your new music video\nyeah and you know which is deeply\nimportant to you and you you have this I\nthink elegant way of balancing your\nbeliefs and even today I think we can\nsee what a spiritual individual you are\nbut not everyone was happy about that\nlike I think it was like something like\n200,000 people decided to not follow you\nanymore yeah now it's 300,000 now\n300,000 right like walk me through why\nit was important to you to pay homage to\nthose Traditions why they were so\nimportant to you and then how do you\nrespond and react to the feeling of\n300,000 people now you said so I already\nknew that was going to happen because uh\npeople are very the intolerance of\npeople of their beliefs and different\nbeliefs is so it's crazy it's crazy um\npeople don't accept from in my opinion\nreligions are it's like veins that go to\na heart they just are in different spots\nthat's beautiful but they get to the\nsame place to be a better human to\nevolve that what's religion is to me and\nI believe in all of them you can see I\ngo to The Shanti Shaman to the the\nchurch with my mother and then my Yoruba\nreligion so my mom is very Catholic\nmy dad my dad's family brings with him\nthe Yuba religion right that this\nreligion comes from heritages of like\nSouls right um this religion was\noriginally in\nAfrica and when the slaves were\nkidnapped by from their countries to be\nbrought to America South America they of\ncourse had their beliefs and relig\nreligions but they were very bad\npunished uh if they were exercising\ntheir religions in um in Brazil or\nwhatever so they would kidnap the slaves\nbring to Brazil and tell them now you're\nCatholic we don't care and you cannot\nexercise your religion here and if they\ndid\npunishment killing not only punishment\nin Brazil until nowadays people get into\nthe temples teros the temples of Yoruba\nto break and kill in the name of\nJesus so I honestly don't believe Jes I\nbelieve in Jesus so much and God\neverything but I don't believe Jesus\nwould come to anybody such a a bright\nSoul would say if you see somebody doing\nthat kill this person I don't I can't I\ndon't believe\nthat I Think Jesus for me is forgien\nforgiveness is love is understanding\neach other's um moment and and how the\nthe speed of each one to evolve right\nit's harder for ones easier for others\nit's faster for ones for others it's not\nI believe Jesus and all the angels and\nall the odas they're all ready when a\nsoul\nasks for forgiveness and for help I\nbelieve they're always ready to help so\nI don't believe there is a a God or a\nJesus that punishes somebody for not\nfollowing their the\nrule I don't believe in that and my\nreligion believes in the forces of\nnature Yuba in Brazil is called\nkandom we believe in\nthere are entities of different like the\nwaterfall the fire the river the forest\nthe the\nrain the sea so that's what we believe\nthe sea Yan is from the sea the fires\nyansa uh the waterfalls is osum the\nforest is oasi so we believe in these\nthings and the nature energies because\nof the fact that a lot of people can um\nimpersonate or feel the the energy in\nour bodies they say it's the demon MH\nbut you can't just say things without\ngoing there and searching for real\ngetting close and understanding okay let\nme see what is this and I feel like when\nI'm in my religion and I follow it since\nI'm a kid because of my dad um I never\nfelt bad I always felt like this peace\nand I can't believe a evil force can\njust make you feel like so connected to\nGod and so good you know and avoiding\nthings that are not good for for you you\nknow when we're there we cannot drink\nalcohol we cannot you know it's it's\nclean it's beautiful we don't believe in\nthe devil we don't believe there is a\ndevil there is a demon we believe in\nhumans that can get to a very very low\nfrequency a very dark place where their\nsouls and then they can become evil and\nmean so I don't want to pass the\nresponsibility I don't want to just say\noh there is the devil and the devil is\ngoing to make me be mean no we're all\nhumans and we have the choice we have\nthe dark side inside of us and if we let\nit go we're going to become that we\ncannot get find other another person to\nblame oh no I did that because the devil\nno you let's take\nresponsibility you know I so we I don't\nbelieve in My Religion we don't believe\nthere is the demon and God there is God\nthere is like beautiful light spirits\nbut there is like people Souls that can\nget to a dark place and it's our\nresponsibility to decide if we want to\ngo there or if we want to go there not\nbecause we are scared of the law and the\njustice of a punishing God because we W\nto be good I want to be good because I\nwant to feel good I want to be a good\nperson not because I'm scared if I die\noh my God they're gonna come and kill me\nno you know yeah and it's it seems like\nthat because you knew that you were\nsimply trying to share and express your\nvalues and your beliefs and your homage\nand you were already disconnected from\nthe fact that people may have a negative\nViewpoint towards it yes I didn't I\nactually did not care cuz I think\nwhoever wants to follow nowadays I chose\nthis whoever wants to follow me follows\nme if it's 10 people if it's a million\namazing I will be happy with 10 I will\nbe happy with a million I don't care um\nbut I just felt like in Brazil it's so\nmuch Prejudice I feel like I like to\nspeak up about a lot of things in my\ncountry not only in my country but\nwhatever I feel like uh I have knowledge\nenough to speak of I do it um or I\nstarted studying and then after some\nmonths years I'm going to speak about it\nwhen I feel like I I know enough it has\nto be a reason why we get famous or we\nget recognized or we get people to\nfollow us we have to use it for\nsomething I can't think like okay God\ngave\nme 65 million people to be looking at\nwhat I'm doing and I'm just going to\ntell them buy this buy that use this use\nthat and make money and be rich I can't\nI feel like I need to give back good\nthings for people to have the same tools\nthat I have to be better humans to be\ngood and if they feel like they\nstruggling something I want to if I have\nthe power or the knowledge to send\nsomething good I want to do it so I\nalways felt this um Mission this\nresponsibility in me and I don't judge\nwho don't I feel like each person has\nyour own nose but\nbecause when you do this that's what\nhappens you lose people you get\ncriticized and some people cannot take\nit and I understand that so I don't\njudge I can take it cuz I don't give a\ndamn I couldn't care less so I do it\nbecause I feel like a lot of people are\nin need of these things um cuz I know\nhow much my religion helped me when I\nwas struggling when I feel like I didn't\nwant to live life anymore cuz it was not\ninteresting cuz I was not lovable I know\nhow much the religion taught\nme that I am part of the nature I I I\nbelong to this so I want more people to\nfeel that if you want to feel great if\nyou don't it's okay you can do you know\nyeah yeah it's one of the things I've\nbeen thinking about lately is when you\nget into the top 1% of any industry or\nany place you get a lot of 1%\nexperiences so some of those are these\nreally tough experiences of lots of\npeople disagreeing with you lots of\npeople may not like what you're doing\nthe choices that you make and then at\nthe same time which is what you happen\nhappened to you recently you recently\njoined Madonna on her tour and did this\nmost historic event of I think 1.6\nmillion people like I think that's the\nlargest ever audience at a concert and\nit's almost like you go from having this\nexperience of you know having hundreds\nof thousands of people unfollow you to\nthen having these moments where you're a\npart of history I mean what did that\nfeel like what was that experience like\nit was great in Brazil uh they do these\nconcerts in kopa Cabana Beach I did once\nit was but it was New Year's Eve so it\nwas five million people oh okay oh so\nyou've done a bigger one no but it's\nbecause it was New Year's Eve come on\nMadonna was it was there no it was her\nshe was the event it and she got a\nmillion 600,000 people it was crazy but\na lot of people in Brazil do that in New\nYear's Eve at the beach and it's amazing\nbut also her\nconcert had a lot of\nconservatives saying like oh my God this\nis so oh the devil the H like she was a\nwoman that abdicated her life to fight\nfor\npeople for their sexualities for the\nLGBT TQ Community for women to be free\nto feel pleasure cuz just men could feel\npleasure and she fought for that and you\nhave to be really Brave to face and in\nthat time when she started it was crazy\ncops coming to her her concert and all\nthe things that she faced\nto that cuz she knew she was bringing\nacceptance to people that wanted to come\nout that wanted to be proud of being gay\nI wanted to be proud of being lesbian of\nhaving feeling pleasure as a\nwoman so to me that was really important\nthat was a woman celebrating like with a\nmillion gays a million and something\ngays at a beach that they were free to\nbe\ngays that was amazing you know not only\ngays but like I mean families\naccepting gays lesbians TRS\nit it was so important but a lot of\nconservatives were like oh this is the\ndevil this is this this is that and I\njust feel like we have the choice of\ndoing whatever we want and we don't need\nto judge our we're not judges of\nanything before judging another person\nwe got to see our own\nsituations so I just don't feel if you\ndon't want to do it you can just go do\nyour thing and let people do what they\nwant want you know we're not judges here\nwe're all Souls looking for evolution\nand um that was a I was so happy that\nshe she invited me I also fight for so\nmany things that I believe in my country\nyou know and I and I try to help as much\nas I can um nowadays mostly indigenous\nin indigenous causes because um the way\npoliticians are killing the Amazon it's\ncrazy the way they're just not giving a\ndamn to the to the Amazon to the\nenvironment it's insane so I like to\nfight for that because Nature has no\nvoice indigenous are not on social media\nthey are not influencers they are there\nthey are very good influencers but still\ndon't have voices um they have\nindigenous Origins so I like to do my\nbest and I was just so happy to be there\nI was so happy that she invited me yeah\nhow did she invite you how did she reach\nout how did that come um we had a song\ntogether on her album some years ago a\nfunk song on her album and uh then when\nshe came to Brazil the first thing she\nsaid okay we got to do\nthis and I actually couldn't and then I\nwas like moving so many things around so\nI could be there it was so important and\nshe also invited uh Pablo vitar which is\na drag queen very good great singer of\nBrazil very successful famous drag queen\nof Brazil that's amazing aming I mean\nyou know when I'm speaking to you today\nand I think when you look at someone\nlike\nyourself it's very easy to forget the\nchallenges and the hardships that\nsomeone's had on the way up you know\nwhen you see someone successful I think\na lot of the time we even if we knew\nthem on the way up we start believing\npeople were an overnight success and\nthat's when you were saying earlier that\nyou know then we start to write people\noff we find the next person whatever but\nyou've talked a lot about you know even\nlike looking at it from a Forward\nThinking perspective you talked about\njust challenges you had with your record\nlabel and then finding the right label\nlike could you walk us through some of\nthe key challenges you've had in even\nbreaking out because I think the odds of\nsomeone like yourself from the FZ who\ndoes this is so rare and difficult and\nyou know I mean I don't know what the\nodds are but I'm guessing it's like you\nknow one in\nwhatever walk us through some of those\nkey challenges that you think you've to\nbreak through on the way up not now but\nthe ones that you've had on that journey\nand maybe the record label one is a good\none to to start with I think no I think\nthe first one was in my country because\nI come from the favelas from the ghetto\nfrom the communities and the Rhythm that\nwe do there is Funk which would be like\nthe hip hop in the '90s here in the US\npeople getting arrested for doing it uh\npeople suffering a lot of prejudice so\nthat was the first one that I was like\nwow people don't want me in restaurants\npeople don't want me in magazines people\ndon't want me anywhere they think I'm\nthe show because I come from this\nenvironment you know from this that's my\norigin um so that was like the first one\nfor me to fight against that and just\nlike um I I couldn't even like find a\nmanagement I was my own manager for so\nmany years you know I just I would be\nthe one going to the brands trying to\nconvince them to support me or to the\nradios to negotiate my songs yeah for\nthem to even play it yes me and my\nbrother to negotiate like concerts and\neverything like that it was just me and\nmy brother for so many years and then\nafter that I think like coming out and\nconvincing label coming out of Brazil\nconvincing label team everybody that\nthis could be something you know because\nthe last time we had a successful artist\nwas 50 years ago with tomin with girl\nfrom\nIan and Venus de\nMor and a\nwoman it was in the 40s with Cara\nMiranda so they were like no that\ndoesn't that doesn't happen Brazilians\nno because when you say like a Latin\nsinger Brazil is a Latin country but we\nspeak Portuguese so it's very different\nthere is a not their barrier because we\nspeak Portuguese not Spanish so the\nsongs that go on in a Spanish Market\ndon't happen in Brazil whatever happens\nin Brazil don't happen in the Spanish\nmarket so for me to convince the label\nor the team my own team my own brother\nthat this would work your own brother\nwas really hard he was like wow you\nfinally when we broke the presice here\nyou want to go to another thing we\ndidn't even take time to rest but again\nmy my emptiness was like no we're going\nto get it we're going to conquer the\nworld and um I just wanted to I like to\ntry new things I I like to challenge\nmyself you know I get bored very easily\nyou know not only of men now it's going\nto finish for God's sake um and I was\nthat's changing now that's changing\nthanks to Jesus thanks to the spiritual\njourney um and there's also it right\nbecause people think women when it's\nwhen a woman doesn't have a relationship\nfor many years because that man didn't\nwant it no babies cuz I didn't want it\nlet's see what happens from now on but\nit was a big Challenge and um my brother\nwas always like oh my God okay let's go\nhe would go just to be with me to\nprotect me but nobody else they would\njust be like I am not going with this\ngirl she was crazy you know and I would\nput my own money W I would just do you\nknow just from what I believe and go for\nit I just think the difference was that\nbefore I was very anxious and pressured\nand nervous about it and always like\nwith this feeling of like no I need to\nget it I need to get it and nowadays I'm\nlike it's okay whatever happens happens\nbut this was a big one and now with and\nthen and then it's funny cuz when I\nstarted to like bring people from the\nSpanish Market to Brazil and then come\nout with my my stuff to outside and\nthings started to go right and go well\nthen everyone wants to figure out how to\ndo it everyone wants to do it\ntoo and I'm like okay and until nowadays\nlike um my album was it's not an easy\nalbum to put out it's a funk Brazilian\nFunk album people don't do Brazilian\nFunk there's no playlist to add my songs\nit's not in it's not in Portuguese so\nthe Brazilian Funk playlist it's not in\nPortuguese here outside there's no\nplaylist of FR or funk in English in\nSpanish neither so you're inventing it\nthough you're inventing that I'm\nbasically doing like something let's see\nif everyone joins this crazy I'm sure\nthey will thing let's see what happens\nthe only reason I could put this album\nout now it's because I was super sick I\nthought I was gonna die remember and I\nwas like you know what I'm gonna because\nI've been trying to do this album for so\nlong but everyone was always like no\nit's it's a fail this album has no place\nto put and and you you see the okay this\nis country this is Pop this is your\nalbum there's nothing where is it going\nto be it's just going to hang\naround and um it took me a very\nlike spiritual place of Detachment to be\nlike okay I'm going to put out whatever\nhappens happens so I was sick I thought\nI was going to die I was like I'm just\ngoing to do an album I like an album\nthat I would do if I didn't care about\nany of these things cuz I'm dying so\nwhatever so I did this album exactly\nlike that and it just got better got\nbetter I didn't die and the album is out\nand um it's funny because uh still has a\nlot of like uh challenges with this\nalbum because it doesn't have a place to\nsit and um but I honestly don't care I'm\nso proud I love the album I can't stop\nlistening to it and most of my albums I\nwould do to try to get streams and I\nwouldn't listen to it but this I'm like\nso proud of it I don't like touring\nbecause it's so for me it's such a\nstruggle to be flying from place to\nplace with no home being in hotels uh I\ncarry a bag just of like cleansing to\nthe hotel I get there I have a sage I\nhave candles I put mantras in the rooms\nvery loud and be like woo clean this\nJesus come clean this bedroom please\nthis bed I put sprays um but for me it's\nlike a a big pressure to be flying from\nCity to City I called all my priests and\nand shamans and I was like help me in\nthis stour cuz now I love this album so\nmuch that I'm like I want to do a tour\ncuz I like dancing to this album I like\nsinging it let's go so we're doing it\nand um tomorrow tonight is my second um\nmy third concert from the store and um\nI'm doing good but I told them help me\nhere cuz I need all this spiritual\nconnection for me to not go crazy cuz\nit's a lot of hotels jumping from place\nto place you know it's not healthy\nmentally it's important the routine and\nto have like grounding absolutely onc\nit's important so for me I'm like okay I\nneed I need support spiritual support\nbut I love this album so much that I was\nlike going to do it because I have so\nmuch fun on stage doing it if I'm\nsinging for uh 2,000 people 3,000 people\nor 40 or\n50 it's the same I just feel really\nhappy I know you talked about the\nchallenge of changing record labels and\nyou talked about this pain point of just\nlike I think at one point you said like\nyou would literally give all your organs\naway if you know if you could get out of\nit walk us through those kind of\ndecisions because I feel like if you're\nnot in the music music industry we don't\nactually understand what's controlling\nwhat and how things Interlink and we\ndon't know what artists are going\nthrough so from that perspective if you\ncould tell us about that transition so\nabout record label I just think I do\nthink nowadays that I wasn't that mature\non the way I did it but maybe if I\ndidn't do that way I wasn't be in the\nposition that I am right now so we would\nnever know it is what it is I would\nnever be like oh my God I never regret\nthings CU I think things happen for a\nreason it's just I really think the way\nthings happen in business should change\na little bit you know um cuz when we\nare when we are chasing something we\ndon't know what's there right so we just\nwe go through deals and\nsituations not knowing what's the\nreality when we get\nthere and that's a very tricky point\nbecause if I'm in this side and I know\nwhat's the reality why would I do\nsomething to a person that I know it's\ngoing to be there and it's going to be\ndifferent you know so I just\nthink business in general not only\nlabels but yes labels too um the\nInvestments the things I don't know if\nit's because I'm more of a business\nperson than just the artist I don't feel\nlike I have the perfect Voice or the\nbest dance or the I think I have a\nlittle bit of everything and then it I I\nget there you know it's a a combo um I\njust\nthink the Investments and the it should\nbe more clear so we understand why they\ndo some type of things and why you\nshould do some type of things but\nsometimes in all the business all the\nindustry and then it's not only about\nrecord labels people come here and they\nsay yeah yeah let's do it and they leave\nand they're like H forget it and this\nshould not be like that things should be\nand for me things are very I like real\nstuff real talk you sit down to me I\nwill tell you the problem\nis and I expect you to say okay so the\nproblem here\nis and I'll be like okay how we get this\nsorted we do this we do do we do that\ncool cool we both do it but sometimes\nmost of the times it's not I sit and I\nand I'm never going to change so I just\nsit down and I'm like here's the\nproblem that doesn't mean I don't like\nyou doesn't that doesn't mean you're not\na good person that means we have this\nproblem yeah and nowadays me and my\nbrother we work together for so many\nyears so when we have issues in a\ncompany we we have a company together we\nhave crazy\nfights let's go to the movies let's and\nwe go cuz we love each other we can\ndiscuss whatever I said is what's going\nto happen whatever he said is what's\ngoing to happen boom and we have the\nability of still look in each other's\nface and be like I appreciate I love you\nlet's go do whatever but people have a\nvery hard time on doing that and I don't\nI will never understand why but that's\nhow things work they just talk here I\ntalk my real\n they talk whatever is necessary for\nyou to shut\nup and then you go home and you see that\nit worked for nothing for no reason you\nspent two hours of your life that you\ncould have been sleeping taking a nap\nliterally and then people have this but\nI think it's an all Industries I don't\nthink it's only in record labels I don't\nthink it's only in music I think it's\neverywhere people when work have a very\nhard time on sitting down and being\nlike the problem for you is this for me\nis this let's do this yeah and then do\nwhat they actually agreed it it's so for\nme it's I don't know maybe I would never\nget\nto understand uh the way business run\nthat's why I go slow and you know with\nmy hard times but I go that's brilliant\nI love hearing that and I can see just I\nwant everyone who's listening if you're\nnot watching when I'm sitting with you I\nI it's so resonant to me that there's\nsuch you it's such a peaceful place with\nthat and what I think's really beautiful\nand special I was in Bhutan recently\nthis year and bhutan's known for\nmeasuring gross national happiness not\nGDP so they measure happiness there and\nthey have spiritual tradition and\nculture it's landlocked between India\nand China it's a tiny country but they\nhave this incredible heart of\nspirituality that runs through\neverything they do uhhuh and the King\nfamously said they measure g& gross\nnational happiness so I was visiting\nthere this year and I met a filmmaker\nthere his name was po very wonderful\ngentleman very very talented and he with\na very small budget for a movie made a\nmovie that got Oscar nominated but\nBhutan wasn't even on the list of\ncountries to have an Oscar nomination\nbut because of him now the movie got you\nknow the Bhutan is now on the list and I\noften think about that with cultures\nTraditions genres that we don't know\nabout yet that there aren't a Grammy\naward for that there aren't you know uh\nlike you're saying like there isn't a\nplace for Brazilian Funk like what\nplaylist is that go on but I think\nthat's what the world is looking for\nright now this opportunity to be\nintroduced I'm always looking for\ndiscovering new I was was I was talking\nabout records I I really got into\ncollecting records and I was traveling\nand I really got into Brazilian Jazz\nlately and I never knew about Brazilian\nJazz growing up and if it wasn't for the\nability to bump into something and so I\nactually think what you're doing for\nmusic for the audio library for for\npeople to have these experiences is is\nreally cool and Powerful because just\nlike Po who's trying to tell the story\nof Bhutan that like you like you asked\nwhere is that a lot of people don't know\nwhere Bhutan is and they don't know what\nit is but because of power now they can\nwatch his movies and understand Bhutan\nand similarly with you someone who may\nnot know about Brazilian Funk is now\ngoing to have the opportunity to\nunderstand what that is and what that\nfeels like and and you think about that\nlike someone had to be first whether it\nwas hip-hop whether it was and it's\nalways going to be harder for the first\nalways harder it's going to it's always\ngoing to be harder for the first I know\nthat and uh even nowadays with funk in\nBrazil it was not playing the radios it\nwas not the events couldn't play Funk it\nwas very hard it could only listen to it\nin the favellas inside of the\ncommunities so it was a big big fight\nnowadays people forget it but at that\ntime me and my brother that we worked\nhard for it to happen we remember very\nwell cuz we know the struggle but I I\nactually used to care a lot if people\nremembered or not nowadays I just don't\ncare I just want to have a good time I\njust want to be happy uh because before\nI was doing it but I wanted the\ncredibility of people saying that I was\nthe one who did it and that there was\nthe time my my therapist which is my\nShaman she\nsaid so why are you doing I was like oh\nbecause you know I want to change\npeople's lives and she was like oh so\nwhy do you care if people acknowledged\nif it was you or not if they changed the\nlife that's it that's what you want it\nand then I was thinking I was like what\nif ego trip that I was right cuz I was\nsaying it was for the people but I was\nvery worried with the PE if the people\nwere saying it was me so in at the end\nof the day if it's for the people we\nshould not care if people are\nacknowledging or not if you if it was\nyou or not absolutely so right now I'm\nin this place of like and and and I\nthink that's what it took it would take\nfor me to be in this in this spiritual\nplace of like to do this album or to do\nwhatever I want to do to be in a place\nof like not care about\nthe response just do what I what makes\nme happy at the moment you know and I'm\nlike very much like that now and I\nunderstand that could be less successful\nmaybe not number one maybe not number 50\nbut I couldn't care less cuzz inside I\nfeel way better than when I was number\none so much happier I'm so happy Foria I\nfeel that for you that's that's\nbrilliant no what a what a beautiful\nplace to be in uh Anita you have been a\njoy\nto talk to honestly I've enjoyed so much\nsharing energy with you exchanging\nenergy with you I feel I feel uplifted\ninspired I feel connected and I think\neveryone who's listening and watching\nwould have felt that from your presence\nand your words and you know the wisdom\nthat you shared as well I think you've\nyou've mentioned in your own words so\ntimes so many times I think you've been\nunderestimated uh people only perceive\nsomeone for the character they play or\nfrom one dimension and my genuine hope\nand intention is that this interview\nwill just just showcase the multifaceted\nmulti-dimensional individual that you\nare and I love the way you're able to be\nplayful and profound all at the same\ntime yeah I think I think people that's\nwhat I want from people now in my life\nand my career I want people to\nunderstand that we need to find a\nbalance we are in the material world so\nwe cannot be just spiritual we need to\neat we need to you know we need to work\nso we can have a house to live in so we\njust need to find the balance so I do\nmake music to shake your ass to have fun\nto jump let's have sex da da but it's\nalso important to come back and have the\nother side too so we can never be happy\nif we only um going to one side the\nother side is always going to feel like\nH but it didn't look at me we need to\nhave the balance the perfect balance\nthat's why we are in a material world to\nunderstand the the balance it between\nthese two things to be able to to walk\naround here and not let these things\nmake you feel like heavy and life is\nonly material or just not only walk\naround here and forget the other side\nexists you know we're here in the middle\nand that's the most important thing to\nbe in the middle absolutely absolutely\nwell said uh we end every on purpose\ninterview with the final five so these\nquestions have to be answered in one\nword to one sentence maximum okay and so\nthese are your final five Anita question\nnumber one what is the best advice\nyou've ever heard or received I think\nit's that I'm in control I\ncommand what people do they come in how\nyou react and receive you commend well\nsaid uh what is the worst advice you've\never heard or\nreceived\noh never give up oh I hate this never\ngive up it's okay to give up oh my God\nit's so okay to give up o if you're\nstruggling give up take a nap rest do\nsomething then you come back when you're\nfine well said all right question number\nthree what's the first thing you do in\nthe morning and the last thing you do\nevery night oh it's the same I have this\nbook five minutes a day I wake up I\nwrite what I three things I want for the\nday I think three things I'm grateful\nfor and um affirmations at night same\npage how three things I was amazing in\nthe day and uh what I learned today I\nlove that question number four what's\nsomething you've learned recently I\nlearned this very important\nthing when a person don't ask you for\nhelp don't\nhelp if the person ask you help\ndon't help someone that didn't ask for\nthe help if she didn't ask she doesn't\nwant or\nhe yeah it's unsolicited sometimes we\nwe're trying to fix because we are\nbuying someone's struggle and this\nperson can feel offended this fr the\nenergy in the family constellation we we\nlearn that when you help a person that\nis not asking for your help it's like\nyou're buying this Karma you know yeah\nI'm going to go off pece slightly\nbecause you inspired a question of me\nhow how has spirituality changed your\nview of dating and relationships\nromantic relationships I feel like it's\nlike a dance nowadays before I used to\nfeel like relationships was what I was\nreading outside seeing outside from\nothers and nowadays spirituality taught\nme that the relationship that you have\nwith\nyourself is going to be the mirror for\nthe relationship that you have with the\nother so nowadays I work at myself a lot\nso I can have a relationship with\nsomebody and when I find somebody that\nis not having a good relationship with\nhimself it doesn't I I already know that\nit's not going to work and I don't\ninsist I let the person know I am here\nI'm working on my yourself and you're\nhere for us to have a good healthy soft\neasy nice thing and grow together\ninside if no then it's not you know but\nI used to think of relationship in a\nvery different way very different way\nthat person needed to add me on all the\nthings that people outside ask oh what\ndoes he\ndo does he do this da how is the family\nwhat if you have kids\nnowadays I just see inside do you treat\nyourself very well if yes then let's go\ncuz I treat myself very well too I love\nthat uh Fifth and final question we ask\nthis to every guest who's ever been on\nthe show if you could create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it\nbe I would create a limit of money that\neach person can have wow that's it\nit that's what you can have now the more\nyou have you're going to pass to the\nnature you don't need to pass I\nunderstand the money comes for those who\nwork out work hard put an effort but\nafter some here you don't need more no\none needs that much you need to share if\nyou want to build a school cool if you\nwan to protect the Amazon cool if you\nwant whatever no one needs I'm talking\nabout necessity no one needs\nbillions billions no no nobody needs the\nnecessity it's not it's not there Anita\na phenomenal answer fantastic interview\nthank you so much it has been such a joy\nit's been wonderful being with you I\nhope that everyone who's been listening\nand watching let me and
