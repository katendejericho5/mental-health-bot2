    "transcript": "i think people's minds are being open to\nwell maybe\nusing genetic edits to make us less\nsusceptible to viruses\nremind me again what's wrong with that\ncrispr is also being used more\nspecifically\nfor detection technologies both jennifer\ndoudna's group and her competitors out\nin\nthe broad institute at mit and harvard\nhave produced these small\nat-home testing kits which will roll out\nin the next few months\nthat can test for any genetic sequence\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\none of you that come back every week\nto listen learn and grow now\nit's not often that i get to sit down\nwith someone whose work i've studied\nas deeply as our guest today but some of\nthe books\nthat i recommend the most in my life\nthat have been life-changing for all of\nyou when you're saying to me jay what's\nyour favorite books\na number of them come from today's\nauthor so today's guest is none\nother than walter isaacson who has\nbeen a journalist and author and\nprofessor of history at tulane he's the\npast ceo\nof the aspen institute where he is now a\ndistinguished fellow\nand has been the chairman of cnn and the\neditor of time magazine\nwalter is the author of best-selling\nbiographies on leonardo da vinci\neinstein and steve jobs and has a new\nbook out today\nwhich is called the code breaker\njennifer doudna\ngene editing and the future of the human\nrace\nuh walter i'm so excited to have you on\nthe show\nlike i said your biographies on steve\njobs and einstein particularly\nuh go down as two of my favorite books\nof all time\nand this one has been the most\nintriguing read i was not expecting you\nto do this\nuh but thank you so much for doing the\nshow jay thank you for all you just said\nyeah i mean every word uh i i put the\nsteve jobs biography into my uh\ntop three books of all time well that's\nbecause of steve jobs\ni just tried to report and uh he's the\none who led the interesting life\nno absolutely but you you captured it\nsplendidly and beautifully but uh\ni wanted to start somewhere a bit more\nwild card uh walter i wanted to ask you\nthat i've noticed that you have a keen\ninterest in basketball\nuh and you retweet these uh little\nbasketball videos all the time uh when\nwhen did you fall in love with the sport\nand who's your team i just actually like\nthe new orleans pelican\nso i'm very much a new orleans person\nand\nuh i'm in mourning about drew brees\nretiring from the saints\ni love zion and the pelicans so\nuh i can't really help you as being a\nbrilliant uh\ni'm not gonna do uh the final four for\nyou and i'm not gonna do any brackets\nwho's been your favorite player of all\ntime you know my favorite\nplayer in some ways was bill bradley for\nmany reasons\nincluding a wonderful book about him\nthat john mcphee\nwrote which is about a sense of place\nwell yeah no i asked because we've we've\nhad some incredible\nuh basketball players and athletes on\nthe podcast before\nuh kobe bryant and dennis rodman uh were\nboth both filming\nalso i mean obviously michael jordan\nwhen i was editor of time and he was in\nthat last\nit was going to be his last series of\ngames\nand they were in the playoffs and it was\na sunday night\ngame and time magazine had to go to\npress on a saturday night\nbut i knew he was going to win i don't\nremember that sunday night\ni knew he was going to win and on\nsaturday night i did a cover\nwe did a cover at time and i you know\nauthorized it\nit's a beautiful picture of him and says\nwe may never see his like again\nand then had to stay up on sunday night\nbiting my fingernails\nbut of course he won the game in the\nlast few seconds and uh\ni knew he would that's incredible\nthat's when you had to predict the news\nright you had to predict the outcome\nuh when you were making decisions and\npapers you got it right but\nthere was plenty of interest uh\ninteresting events of fake news there\nbut i don't go on podcasts and tell you\nall the times i made mistakes i'll just\ntell you the\ntime i got it right with michael jordan\ni love it i love it walter well walter\nlike i said before you've written some\nincredible\nbiographies and i can't wait to talk\nabout the code breaker today as well\nbut how did you get into actually\nwriting about\ngeniuses icons innovators\nbecause it's it's a real task to get so\nintimately deep into someone's life and\nbe able to share their life in such an\nauthentic way how did you\nfirst find that fascination and then\nsecondly develop the skill and the art\nof storytelling\nwell i come out of louisiana here and i\nhad a mentor\na novelist named walker percy not that\nfamous but a great novelist\nhe said that two types of people come\nout of louisiana preachers\nand storytellers he said for heaven's\nsake be a storyteller the world's got\nfar too many preachers\nand i think that's the best way to tell\nstory even a story about\ngene editing and you know rna vaccines\nis not just doing an analytical story or\nopinion piece or whatever is instead say\nlet me tell you a story\nand you make it a journey of discovery\nand so what i like to write are journeys\nof discovery about creative people\nnow you know in my career i've known a\nlot of smart people\nbut at a certain point i realized smart\npeople are a dime a dozen they don't\namount to much\nyou have to be like steve jobs and think\ndifferent and so what is it that makes\npeople creative\nand so with any of my subjects we go\nhand in hand\non a journey and i'd almost call it an\nadventure\nin which we say okay you know here we're\ngoing to go through this together we're\ngoing to grow we're going to learn\nthings\nand we're going to see how the creative\nprocess works\nso if i have a aim\nit's what is creativity and how do\npeople achieve it\nand the best way to do it is not say\nhere are seven lessons the creativity\nor the 12 secrets to creativity i don't\nthose books don't appeal to me what\nappeals to me\nis the way the bible does it it's the\nway biographers have always done it\nis let me tell you a story and you you\nexplain\ncreativity to the journey of a person\nwhether it be\nben franklin steve jobs or jennifer\ndoudna\nor leonardo da vinci yeah that would be\ncool absolutely no i love that that's\nthat's such a great answer and uh\nobviously some of these people you've\nactually spent time with and some of\nthem\nof course you didn't spend time with\nwhat's the difference between that\nopportunity like what's the difference\nin the process because i can imagine\nthat not spending time with someone and\nresearching their life is far more\ndifficult but at the same time it's\nquite challenging to be so intimate with\nsomeone without judging and projecting\nyour own\nview of them onto them so how are you\nable to balance both yeah you do\nend up um when you spend a lot of time\nwith somebody\nyou bond with them and in some ways even\nthough steve jobs had a lot of rough\nedges\ni tried to put it in such a context\nbecause i so thought he was an amazing\nperson\nthat i said okay he drove people mad he\ndrove him crazy\nbut he also drove them to do things that\nthey never knew they would be able to do\nand when you're able to walk alongside\nside somebody\nactually in real life like i did with\nsteve jobs or with jennifer doudna\nyou know about a thousand times more\nthan you can ever know about a ben\nfranklin or leonardo where you're\nyou know looking through notebooks and\nlooking through letters to figure out\nwhat happened\ni mean steve jobs would spend hours\ngoing over his ipod playlist with me\nand why you know two different versions\nof\nyou know glenn gould's variations or you\nknow both sides now\nand the joni collins and judy\nyou know judy collins joni mitchell\nversions\nall these things and even like on the\nipod why the curves or the chamfers on\nthe case\nwere done the way it was for the fingers\nand each so i mean i just knew\na zillion things about everything he did\nthe interesting thing about doing with\njennifer doud is we were\ndoing it in real time it wasn't like me\nsaying explain to me\nyou know what it was like to start apple\nin the garage or what was wozniak like\nwhen you first met him\nwhen i was doing jennifer doudna things\nwere happening in real time she had\nturned her attention\nyou know to fighting the covid epidemic\nand i would be with her in her lab or\ni'd be on her slack channels or i'd be\nyou know looking at resume meetings and\nso\nthe book actually i hope unfolds\nas if you're part of a drama that's\nunfolding for all of us in real time\nyeah that's such a special thing about\nthis book actually because\nyou're right that when we remember\nevents or people in hindsight\nit's it's always clouded with hindsight\nlike there's always a different\nskew or a different perception whereas i\ndefinitely feel that in this book you're\nabsolutely right\nthere were jennifer doudna and also an\nindividual that we don't know so much\nabout so i remember seeing her ted talk\nback in 2015 that's when i'd first\ncome across her and then when i saw your\nbook i thought oh wow this is this is\nincredible but it's also someone that we\nall don't know much about\noutside of the fields that she's the\nnumber one expert an innovator in and\nthat's why i felt like it was more of a\ndiscovery as well\nwhen did you start working with her and\nwhen did you get fascinated by her work\nwell i got fascinated about 10 years ago\nwith the life sciences because i had\ndone the physics revolution with\neinstein\nthe digital revolution with steve jobs\nand i realized that the revolution that\nwill affect\nyou know the current time the first half\nof the 21st century and our kids\nwill not be the digital revolution but\nthe life sciences revolution\nso as you said around 2015 she was doing\nthe ted talks she also came to the aspen\ninstitute\nwhere i worked and i realized she would\nbe a very good central character because\nit was not just about the gene editing\ntechnology of crispr\nit was about the fact that even as a\nyoung girl she had been reading things\nlike the double helix\nand wanted to become a scientist but her\nschool counselor says\nwell no girls don't become scientists\nand so she pushes on that\nand everybody else in the 1990s it\nseemed\nin the field of biology was chasing dna\nin the human genome project\nand she and a few women like jillian\nbanfield said actually\nrna is the more interesting molecule and\nthen when she discovers how you can use\nrna as a guide to edit our own genes\nshe has this nightmare that hitler\nsummons her and wants to learn how to\nuse it\nand so she becomes one of the leaders in\nthe moral\nand ethical and policy debates and the\nmore\ni talked to her and the more i heard\nabout her i said well she's great as a\ncentral character\nnow there are many other characters in\nthe book there's fung jiang and there's\ngeorge church and there's\nemmanuel sharpen jay but jennifer as a\ncentral character\nhelps connect it back to the uh you know\nthe time when watson and crick wrote the\ndouble helix\nall the way through the current period\nwhere day by day we're trying to create\nthese new\nantiviral technologies and detection\ntechnologies using crispr\nyeah i heard her talk about in that talk\ni remember she she was speaking about\nhow\nscared she was about how gene editing\ncould be misused and\nuh you know used unethically but we'll\nget to that\nlet's start by you explaining to us\nwhat crispr is because i think for\npeople to really understand\nthe power of this book and the work that\nyou're doing they really do need to\nunderstand\nabout how central this is going to be in\nthe next revolution as you said\nright and it's a pretty simple system\nbacteria have been using it for a\nbillion years\nand they're not all that smart what they\ndo is whenever they get attacked by a\nvirus\nand that war between bacteria and\nviruses is a worse war than even our\nwar against viruses so whenever a virus\nattacks a bacteria or some of these\nbacteria\nthe bacteria take a small mug shot\nof some of the genetic code of the\nattacking virus\nand the bacteria puts it in its own\ngenetic sequence\nin these clustered repeated sequences\nknown as crisprs\nand so if they ever have the virus\nattack them again\nthey got this mug shot and they can use\na tiny\nsnippet of rna as a guide to go\nand use an enzyme to chop up\nthe attacking virus so in other words\nit's a immune system that bacteria have\ndeveloped and can adapt to each new wave\nof virus well that's really useful these\ndays when it's happening to us\nbut what's also useful is that jennifer\ndoudna and emmanuel sharpen j\nwith their colleagues figured out oh i\ncan take\nthat guide that's moving the enzyme to\ncut\ndna and i can reprogram it and i can\nmake it\ncut dna wherever i tell it to\nand boom that was an aha moment in the\nlab\nbecause they said it could be used as a\ngene\nediting tool on humans so when we talk\nabout crispr now\nwe're talking about a pretty simple\nsystem that simply has a guide rna\nand an enzyme that cuts dna and\nit's a system to edit our dna\na system to edit our genes and explain\nto us how that editing system was used\nduring the pandemic or it's being used\nright now because i think sometimes when\nyou hear about these ideas you kind of\nthink oh that's a sci-fi movie\nuh that's probably something that's\ngoing to happen in the future a lot of\npeople's minds will\npostpone that being practical but it's\nbeing used right now it's been used in\nthe last 12 months\nwell it's been used recently to cure\ngenetic diseases such as sickle cell\nanemia\nin my book there's a wonderful person\nnamed victoria gray in mississippi\nshe suffered sickle cell her whole life\nshe had crispr used on her blood cells\nand she doesn't suffer from sickle cell\nnow\nas a young kid david sanchez 17 years\nold\nloves playing basketball except for when\nhe doubles over with sickle cell\nand they say okay we could also edit\nyour reproductive cells\nso your children will never have sickle\ncell in other words we can make\ninheritable edits it'll be passed down\nthroughout the species a chinese doctor\ndid that two years ago\nand made inheritable edits on embryos so\nthat the resulting twin girls didn't\nhave the receptor\nfor hiv the virus that causes aids now\neverybody including jennifer doudna was\nupset\nwe don't want to be making inheritable\nedits yet we don't know if it's safe\nand we don't know if it's ethical but\nnow that we're being hit with a virus\npandemic\ni think people's minds are being open to\nwell maybe\nusing genetic edits to make us less\nsusceptible to viruses\nremind me again what's wrong with that\nso we have to\nkeep our minds open now in terms of the\ncoronavirus\ncrispr is also being used more\nspecifically\nfor detection technologies both jennifer\ndoudna's group\nand her competitors out in the broad\ninstitute at mit and harvard\nhave produced these small at-home\ntesting kits which will roll out in the\nnext few months\nthat can test for any genetic sequence\nyou know in our saliva you just have to\nspit into a low cartridge\nand so you can say do i have coronavirus\ndoes my\nkid have strep throat is that cancer\nrecurring\nis uh do i have a bacterial infection\nand\nyou know my gut microbiome you know\nbiome\nshould i be eating better yogurt it also\ncan be used to directly kill viruses\nwith vaccines we're using our own immune\nsystem and kicking them into gear to\nfight a virus if we get infected\nthat's okay but our immune systems as we\nare finding out\nare rather tricky and it would be better\njust to have\nantivirals and to use crispr the way\nbacteria\ndo which is uh let's just\nuse it to directly chop up any viruses\nthat we target in our system that's not\nquite ready yet\nbut is working in the lab and will\neventually be the better way we fight\nviruses\nwhat what are jennifer's uh pros and\ncons around\ncrispr and gene editing like where does\nshe feel it's adding value and where\ndoes she start to feel\nthis is actually as you said you know\nethically challenged this this is posing\na negative usage uh challenges depending\non whose hands this is in\nwhat are the pros and cons that she sees\nthat you were able to observe\nand what were you shocked and surprised\nby and what were you happy about as you\nuh saw this journey unfold right and\nthat's a good way to put it because it\nwas a journey that unfolded\nuh what jennifer feels now just like\nwhat i feel now and i hope what\neverybody feels now is a little\ndifferent than we felt\ntwo or three or four years ago after she\nhad the nightmare she's gathering\nscientists and ethicists and religious\nleaders\nand saying how do we stop inherited gene\nediting how do we\nstop things unless they're really\nmedically necessary\ni think and you'll read in the book\nthere's no\nfinal answer here this is a journey so\ninstead of saying\nyou can't just turn to the last chapter\nof my book and say\nlet me see the answer key here to tell\nme what we should do\ni think all of us have to have a feel\nfor this technology\nhave a feel for our own humanity for own\nchildren or\nnephews or nieces or you know and say\nall right\nhow do i feel and i think our thinking\nwill evolve as\neven the pandemic has made it evolve as\nfor jennifer\nand for me thinking has evolved somewhat\ni was\ntotally against any germline\nmeaning inheritable gene edit and i was\nvery much against\nany genetic editing except for very\nclear simple diseases\nbut even before the pandemic when\njennifer gave those talks\nyou mentioned like the ted talk or when\ni was talking about this in a chat room\nsomewhere\ni'd always have and she'd always have\npeople come up afterwards or in the chat\nroom\nand they'd say something like you know i\nhave a 12 year old granddaughter\nand i think she's going to die in three\nyears i've been told\nshe's got a degenerative nerve disease\ncan you get me in touch with jennifer\ndoudna maybe she\ncan fix it or i've got a son and the son\nhas\nyou know muscular dystrophy and it's a\nsimple gene mutation can that be fixed\nso i think sometimes instead of saying\nwouldn't it be\nimmoral to use gene editing you know in\ncertain cases\ni also have to get my mind in the other\ndirection and say\nwouldn't it be immoral not to use it\nin some cases so\ni don't want to preach as i said they're\nstorytellers and preachers i'm just\ntelling you a story\nbut you're going to walk in this story\nwith jennifer dowd\nand many other people and say all right\ni get it it's complicated maybe we\nshould do\nsimple diseases like sickle cell and\nmuscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis\nand tay sachs\nhuntington's maybe there are other\nthings we can do including making us\nless susceptible to viruses\ni think i would personally pause it'd be\npretty easy to add height to your\nchildren\nor muscle mass i mean myostatin as you\nknow can be regulated genetically\nand so you could have more muscular\nchildren if you decide\ni draw the line before doing that\ni think enhancements i think rich people\nbuying better genes for their kids than\npoor people\nis a horror that we have to evolve avoid\njust like in brave new world or gattaca\nand i think editing out the diversity of\nour species i love\nthe balcony behind me on royal street in\nthe french quarter here in new orleans\ni just look down and see people tall and\nshort and you know black and white and\ncreole and you know various hues\nand fat and skinny and gay and straight\nand trans\nand you know sighted and blind and\nyou know and i think okay the diversity\nof our species is a really cool thing\nlet's not mess with that yeah that\nthat's that's fascinating because\nyeah as soon as you get into the\naesthetic enhancements\nit's it's different for its use from uh\nserving but but yeah it's such a\nsubjective thing\nwell to you know of what someone thinks\nis important and\nwhat is available to someone i one of\nthe things that i love that\nyou've helped me do personally and\nsomething that i like to encourage\nmy listeners to do is to study\npeople's lives uh you know i really\nbelieve as you were saying that the\nreligious text the spiritual texts they\nregularly introduce us to stories of\npeople that we can study\ni wonder what have you learned\nfrom jennifer doudner beyond of course\nthe ideas of crispr and gene editing\nwhat are some of the things you learned\nabout the way she lives and the way she\nthinks\nthat you may have started to imbibe\nyourself or something that you admire\nand that you're passing on what are some\nof those\nmore softer aspects one of the things is\nthat creativity is a collaborative\neffort\nand innovation is a team sport and i\nrealize that like steve jobs she's very\ngood\nat creating teams unlike steve jobs she\nhas a different method\nwhich is she likes her teams to really\nlike each other she always if she's\ngonna have somebody come into her lab or\nbe a postdoc\nor be hired they have to meet everybody\nelse and there has to be a chemistry\nwhere they all click\nthat's one form of leadership in team\nbuilding and it works for her\nif you read doris kearns goodwin's team\nof rivals or\nabout franklin roosevelt or steve jobs\nthey often like to have more creative\ntension\nwithin the team well you know what that\nworks too\nwhat i learned from jennifer doudna is\nyou have to look inside yourself\nand say what is my best approach\nat being a collaborator a creative\nteam builder and i'm going to do it my\nway\nand and you know be comfortable with it\nand i learned that i'm not a\nparticularly great\nmanager i like teaching i like writing\nbut when they ask me to run a big\ncompany like cnn\nyou know i i'm not good at being the\nboss\nevery day and managing a lot of high\nmaintenance people\nall the time so i watched jennifer dowd\nnow say well play to your strengths here\nhave creative small teams that get along\nwell\nand that's different from people who are\ngoing to be managing huge enterprises\nwith a lot of creative tension but each\nis a way to make a contribution to\ncreativity\ni love that your answer is not singular\nit's not one dimensional it's the idea\nthat certain people liked creative\ntension in teams and that that's how\nthey succeeded and other people love\ncreative chemistry and\nand that succeeded because i often think\nit's so easy to be like this is the only\nway\nthat teams can thrive and teams can be\nsuccessful but you're seeing\nfrom two phenomenal individuals\nand their teams that actually both have\nworked before\nand i look at ben franklin you know he\nwasn't the smartest of the founders\nand he wasn't the um you know that was\njefferson of madison\nand he wasn't the most passionate that's\nsam adams or his\ncousin john uh but he was a team builder\nhe's the one who can bring them all\ntogether\nand um you know and as i said\ni really don't like those books that\nhave on their cover\nyou know the seven secrets of building\nteams or something or\nyou know creative team building and 12\neasy lessons\ni think you have to learn that different\npeople do it in different ways i did it\ndifferently\nat time magazine and cnn than\nyou know other people did when they were\nrunning publications\nbut i learned from jennifer make sure\nyou understand what you're most\ncomfortable with\nand lead with that strength that seems\nto be a\nrecurring theme the idea of repeating\nstrengths or\nuh emphasizing or going all in on your\nstrengths seems to be a recurring theme\nwhat was\nwhat was it about steve jobs that you\nthink rubbed off on you what\nwhat part of that energy or or abilities\nor skills or or things you saw did\nany of it if any of it rub off on you\nwell there were many lessons from the\nbook i\nwish more of them had rubbed off on me\ni'd love to be\nmore like steve jobs although perhaps\nkinder and gentler at times\nbut one of the things that impressed me\nwas his passion\nfor perfection and for the product when\nhe was a young kid\nhis dad was building a fence around the\nbackyard of the house and\nyoung steve was helping with his hammer\nand his father said we have to make the\nback of the fence just as beautiful as\nthe front\nand steve said well it faces these woods\nin marshland nobody will ever see it\nnobody will know\nhis father said well you will know and\nso steve\njobs even when it came to the circuit\nboard and the original macintosh\nwanted it to look beautiful even though\nhe had made the mac into an\nappliance that the ordinary user\ncouldn't open i mean you know it didn't\nhave\nyou we didn't have a screw you could\nopen up the back and see the circuit\nboard\nbut steve always felt that if you care\nenough about the beauty of the parts\nunseen\nyou're going to have a passion for\nmaking a great\nproduct i think far too often people are\ntrying\nhard to make a profit\nor they're trying hard to get a product\nout the door\nthey don't pause and say i could\nsacrifice a little of the prophets and\neven sacrifice a little of the rush\nbut i can make it really beautiful and\neven in a small way i mean that's why i\nhold my books for a year\nyou know longer than i need to because i\njust want to go over and over again each\nthing\nbut in a small way for example the paper\nquality of the book i kept pushing the\npublisher\ni want color pictures throughout i don't\nwant it to be this little\ninsert of things and i want high quality\npaper\ni learned that with the leonardo da\nvinci book and so\nthis book i said you know take it out of\nmy royalties\nwe're going to split the cost of this\nbut\ni don't want you to charge more than\nmost books i want it to be you know less\nthan most books\nbut i want you to use high quality paper\nhave color pictures throughout a lot of\npictures\nbecause i just want people to feel the\nbook and look at it\nand say oh that's a nice product even if\nthey\nyou know leaving aside whether i got the\nwords all right\ni want the product to look good i want\nas steve jobs said\neven the parts unseen most readers don't\nknow\nthe paper stock and the weight of the\npaper stock and the count and\ni know that from the magazine world the\nmatting and the\nyou know the coding and stuff but they\nsense\neven the parts that they can't fully see\nthey sent okay\nyou tried to make it high quality that's\nwhat i did with this book\nand yeah you don't charge more but you\njust say it's going to be high quality\nyeah you definitely feel that you've\ndone a fantastic job with\nshow the color pictures i don't know\nit's beautiful yeah even even inside\nlike this this is\neven yeah even this is stunning yeah\neven the\nimpact would be beautiful and uh\nhere are some of the color pictures i do\nwant people to see it it's it it's\nabsolutely beautiful to see\nyou know remember a few people are on a\npodcast they're gonna be looking at this\nyeah everyone is listening to this i am\nshowing pictures of the book so you have\nto get the book\nin order to see the pictures this one's\ngreat i love this picture\noh yeah her in a lab holding the test\ntube as a young woman\nyeah tell me a bit about her when it\ncame to that moment in her life when she\nwas told girls\ndon't become scientists how does she\ngenuinely\nremember that moment was she someone\njust completely unaffected by it or\noh no she was affected by it and you\nknow what you'll see in the book\nand i hope she'll forgive me for saying\nso she's still got that streak of\ninsecurity\nof having been a sixth grader and told\nno you can't do this\nand when she's in college you showed\nthat picture of her holding the test\ntube\nat the pomona college chemistry lab she\nthought well maybe i can't do it maybe i\nshould be a french major\nbut she persists and so that's another\nlesson in this book and all the way\nthrough\nwe all overcome some obstacles we all\nfeel like outsiders at times\nyou know maybe there are a few of us who\ndon't have any insecurities\nbut i've not met any and so i think we\nhave to know\nthe insecurities instead of ignoring\nthem well i think that's what that's\nwhat really helped me when i was reading\nyour work on both einstein and steve\njobs was around the\nthe number of failures and rejections\nand setbacks and not just the ones that\nmake it onto movies or not just the ones\nthat you know get glamorized\nin in hollywood but the deep\nunderstanding of just how\ncrazy this is for someone to go through\nthese events that's given me a lot of\nconfidence that whenever i face failures\nand rejections i'm like i'm on the same\npath as\nsteve joseph's like you know it's the\nsame feeling of i can relate\nas opposed to thinking well oh well my\nlife shouldn't have any challenges\nbecause steve's didn't have any\nchallenges often we're not aware\nwhen it comes to someone like uh\njennifer doudna what are the biggest\nchallenges she's up against today\nfrom a from the world of science what\nare the challenges she's having to\nprocess\nuh from her own industry and her own\nwork right now well she's having a good\nyear right now having just won the nobel\nprize and\nsomewhat of a surprise it came rather\nquickly it usually takes some\ndecades to give a nobel prize to a field\nand she's really\nreduced the amount of rivalry and\ncompetition\nwith her rival team at the broad\ninstitute of mit and harvard\nbecause they're both working on crispr\ndetection technologies\nand i think it reminded all of us\nincluding all the scientists and i hope\nall the young readers and old readers\nof this book that sometimes when you're\nin a race when you're in a rival when\nyou're being competitive\nthat's great it spurs you on but then\nyou get reminders that there's a\nnoble reason you're doing this as well\nthere's a higher calling\nhelping humanity and so i think that she\nis driven right now\nand her setbacks are she still doesn't\nhave that\nhome testing kit totally approved and\nready\nto be bought at your local drug store\nthat the antiviral cast 13 it's called\nyou know crisper cast 13 is she's got it\nlicked they know how to make it work but\nit's hard to deliver it into\nthe affected cells in the body so with\nscience there's always another hurdle to\novercome but the cool thing about\nscience and why i like writing about\nthis\nis the scientific method reminds us you\ngot to keep an open mind\nyou're going to do an experiment and\nit's going to fail\nand that means you're going to have to\nrevise your theories well you know what\nwe've been pretty bad at doing that in\nour politics and our civil discourse\nto be able to say well i actually have\nthis belief in theory\nbut i'm seeing new evidence so maybe\ni'll revise it\nyou know we used to do that ben franklin\ndid that that was the whole heart of his\nscientific method of\nforming a republic nowadays we don't do\nthat in our society as much or a cable\ntv\nshout shows as much that's why we have\npodcasts because people can actually\nthink things through\nyeah i love that as a cross\npollination of an idea and a methodology\nand of how things are processed and\ni i think that's such a deep lesson\nboth from a micro and a macro level of\nthinking whether we are talking about\npolicy or government or whether we are\ntalking about our own lives the ability\nto review our own beliefs to review our\nown patterns\nand and that is one of the reasons why i\nabsolutely love podcasts because we can\nthink things through and\nand not have to define and not have to\nmake something\ndefinitive and allow ourselves to\nexplore and experience something when\ni'm\nwhen you when you're writing these books\nand mapping out people's lives at\nwhat kind of measures do you have to\ntake to\nto not project your subconscious beliefs\nonto them and onto the book because i\nfind like that must be to me that sounds\nlike one of the most difficult things to\ndo\nuh is to is to because you must have\nreally learned the skill\nof realizing that there is no truth\nthere is only both people's perception\nof the experience would you agree with\nthat or would you say there's always a\nfact\ni'm not trying to agree with you on that\ni don't know that we'll ever get to\nabsolute\ntruth at all times and sometimes we\nthink we get it the truth and we have to\nrevise it\nbut i think that's your load star that's\nwhere you set your compass needle\nwhich is there's going to be some truth\nin here somewhere\nand i just have to listen to all the\ndifferent sides and\nlook at all the different evidence i\nmean i've got\nthe patent battle in my book between\njennifer doudna and fong zhang\nwell i spend a lot of time looking at\nevidence people\nmay disagree with my conclusions\nabout that epic battle they're going\nthrough over the patent for the use of\nthis gene editing tool\nbut i hope i'm keeping my eye on the\nball\nof trying to get to the truth on this\nand even though i may miss\noccasionally i hope i keep enough of an\nopen mind that somebody says well you\nactually\nmissed this point here's some more facts\ni'll recalibrate a bit\nbut i grew up in a tradition of\njournalism that now seems antiquated\nwhich is it's not about me it's not\nabout my opinions\ni got to make sure i keep my opinions as\nfar as possible out of the way\nexcept for when i'm forming my opinions\nbased on my reporting and the facts\nso i'm not trying to say i'm coming at\nthis with a bias\nthat i believe we should gene edit for\ntay sachs and not sickle cell or\nsomething yeah right\nvice versa i i feel\nthat i've got to be objective and people\nsay well there's no such thing as\nobjectivity\ni go yeah there are actually things you\ncan\ntest and see what's right and what's\nwrong\nand even though we'll never get it\nabsolute truth and we'll never get it\nbeing absolutely objective\nwe can always say that's what we're\naiming for\ni think i think that's a really good\nuh answer to to a to a difficult area\nto understand when it comes to those\nskills walter what are the\nwhat you do a lot of listening in your\nline of work when you're listening to\npeople you're observing people you're\nresearching\ngive us your best tip on listening\nand being present that people can\nactually use in their life because\nthat's a skill that you've obviously\nhoned\nand developed to work with some of the\nmost incredible people on the planet\nhow are you listening in such a way that\nyou're truly understanding them i think\nthat's a skill we all need to learn\ni think a skill that i have if i may be\nso\nbold is to claim it is i'm good at\ngetting people to talk\nyou know whether it's a jennifer dowdner\nor henry kissinger or\nyou know who i wrote about years and\nyears ago\nor steve jobs where i just sit there sit\nthere by his bed when he was ailing\nand i can get him to talk and one secret\nis\njust let them talk you know you don't\nhave to\nask a whole lot of long questions you\ncan just say\ntell me about it secondly you just have\nto be\ntruly curious and all the creative\npeople i know\nhave a natural curiosity and i think\ni'm i may say i'm blessed with it but so\nis um everybody on the planet\nwe're all blessed with curiosity it's\njust sometimes\nwe outgrow our wonder years we lose our\nsense of curiosity\nwe think we know it all and i mean i'm\nlooking i can look out of my window now\nand the clouds have parted and the sky\nis blue and i still\nlike leonardo da vinci did like einstein\ndid i'm curious\nabout why the sky is blue and why it\ngets a darker blue at a certain time\nand that curiosity causes me\nto ask questions and sometimes when a\njournalist asks a question\nthey got a goal in mind they want to\nplay gotcha they're asking a question to\ntry to\nget a piece of news i try to make sure\nthat every time i ask a question it's a\nvery simple question\nand i'm asking it because i'm actually\ncurious\nto know the answer i you know i i think\nthat\nlistening and understanding people to\nthe hardest\nthings that we do but they're things\nthat we have to do every single day and\nso\nany tips we can take on that what about\ntips on asking questions\nuh you said they're asking simple\nquestions what's probably the most\ninteresting question you've asked\nsomeone is it as simple as tell me about\nit or is there something\nmore to that art of questioning that has\nallowed you to\nunlock someone's uh you know their\ndeeper essence through questioning\nshort and simple and sometimes i'll ask\na question\nof why did you do that it could be an\ninventor could be a hedge fund manager\nyou know somebody created an algorithm\nto you know beat the market or whatever\ni'll say why why'd you do that and\nthey'd say okay because i can\nmake money this way because i can i say\nyeah but why\nwhy did you do that and i i like peeling\nback the onion a bit\nso that people have to say well i hadn't\nreally\nthought about deeper motivations or\nwhatever\nbut the only way those questions work is\nif you're actually generally\ngenuinely curious and um\nso uh i i was reading recently just\nbecause there was this new movie about\nwoody allen\nand if you're intrepid you can go find\nit on the internet\nbut when i was at time magazine is when\nwoody allen's suny previn scandal broke\nor whatever\nand so i went some reason another you\nknow i'm going to get people to talk he\nsaid come on over i'll talk to you\nand he talked to me for like two hours\nthe middle of the scandal was all\nbreaking\nand at a certain point\ni just asked why did you do that you\nknow come on and it was like\nand he got more and more reflective\nhe at one point said the heart wants\nwhat it wants\nand i just\nkind of remember that time because it\nwasn't that i was so smart about asking\nthe questions i didn't go in with smart\nquestions\nis when i was looking at them i really\nbecame curious i really wanted to know\nexcuse me why did you what were you\nthinking why'd you do that\nthe best part about that answer is that\nit's available to everyone as you said\nabout curiosity\nis the skill is simply being curious as\nyou rightly pointed out\nit's you know everyone can ask that\nquestion to their\nfriend their family member a mentor an\ninteresting person we talk a lot about\nmentors on this podcast and being able\nto understand the most from our mentors\nand guides or\nor teachers and sometimes we think we\nhave to have this phenomenal\nmind-blowing question to ask that's\ngoing to be earth-shattering and\nthe truth is you don't the truth is you\njust simply want to\nunderstand more curiously and i i love\nthat and i want everyone who's listening\nand watching to\nto adopt that this week is to ask\nsomeone a simple\nshort question in their life so that you\ncan learn something new about them or\nlearn something different about them so\ni love how\nhow accessible and practical that is\nyeah not all of us are going to ever\nhave\neinstein's mental processing power\nor leonardo da vinci's artistic talent\nbut all of us if we really want to can\nbe just as curious about things\nabout all the wonders around us and that\npure curiosity\nled you know a graduate student in spain\nto say\nwhy do bacteria have these clustered\nrepeated sequences\nand jennifer doubted to say well what\ndoes the\nrna do in order to get it to the right\nplace to make the cut and\nthat wasn't done because they were\ntrying to make a gene editing tool or\ntrying to make a vaccine\nthey were kind of curious like whoa\nnature's beautiful\nlet's try to figure it out that that's\nreally resonated with me because\nsame with the other individuals you\nspoke spoke about and have written about\nand jennifer doudna too\nthey weren't trying to necessarily solve\nsomething for a particular goal\nit was the curiosity that led to it do\nyou think\nthat that's an approach that we need to\nencourage\nmore in education in\nuh in the scientific in both spiritual\nfields is that something that we're\nlosing\nis that something you saw more of when\nyou were studying people of the past or\nis that just a trait that\ncomes along once in a while where you\nfind an incredible icon like this who\njust thinks completely from a curious\nplace as opposed to a\nconsumer or a creative space of actually\ncreating something tangible\ni think the most important application\nof that\nis in our policy meaning you know\ngovernment funding\nuniversity research whatever every now\nand then you get politicians\nwho balk at\nresearch funding by the u.s government\nwhich has happened since world war\nii and sometimes they make fun of like\noh they're studying\nyou know the dna of bacteria why are\nthey doing that\nand i think part of the message of this\nbook is that basic research\ncuriosity driven research we don't know\nwhere it's going to lead\nbut that's where you got to begin and\neventually\nit'll lead to discoveries and those\ndiscoveries might lead to inventions\nand those inventions might be useful\nwhen they were\nyou know einstein's uh colleagues\nwere figuring out how do electrons\ndance on the surface of semiconducting\nmaterials\nand how does quantum theory apply to\nsurface states\nthey weren't doing it to invent the\ntransistor\nbut eventually when they figured out at\nbell labs\ntheoretical physicists you know like\njohn bardeen and william shockley\nwho understand the quantum surface\nstates of semiconducting materials\nsuddenly have changed the entire world\nby creating the transistor and then the\nmicrochip\nthat's true of my book now which is this\nadventure to figure out you know\nhow are molecules working in our bodies\nlenses leads to things like\nediting tools and vaccines absolutely\nwell terezas and thank you so much for\nspending time with us today to have this\nconversation\ni want to encourage everyone who's\ndeeply fascinated curious and intrigued\nto\ngo out and get a copy of the code\nbreaker uh\nit's available right now when you hear\nthis episode\nand i truly believe that you know walter\nyou you're very humble and modest and i\nthat makes me appreciate you even more\nbut you have a really unique ability to\nbe able to really get into\nuh people's lives in a really deep and\nintimate way and\ntake us on a journey through their life\nin a very 360 hallway\ni feel like you're great at telling us\nabout the whole person rather than\njust the part that's often the most\npopular part and i i really really value\nyour approach and the way you do that\nuh we end every interview with the final\nfive walter which is a fast five so you\nhave to answer each question in\none word or one sentence maximum uh so\nif you're ready this is your fast five\nare you ready uh yeah i'm not prepared\nyeah definitely not prepared okay uh if\nthere's one person you could have dinner\nwith that's no longer with us who would\nit be\nleonardo da vinci because he was the\nperson who most wanted to know\neverything you could know about\neverything that was knowable and is like\nwhoa tell me about it what what do you\nthink was the most interesting discovery\nhe made\nthrough your reset i think his uh most\ninteresting thing he did\nwas connect the arts and the sciences\nand that's an inspiration for steve jobs\nwho convinced me to write about leonardo\nda vinci\nthat's what vitruvian man that naked\ndoing the jumping jacks in the circle\nand square\nis supposed to symbolize as the\nconnection of art and science\nand that's why the mona lisa has the\nmost amazing smile\nit's because he studied optics he\nstudied nerves he studied perspective\nand he was able to meld art and science\nto make the greatest painting ever i\nlove that that was only one question by\nthe way i got excited\ni got curious i got curious so i yeah\nwhen\nwhen i get curious we can break the\nrules uh the second the second question\nwho\nalive would you most love to have dinner\nwith probably elon musk\num i've now you know i've actually\nbecause of what i do i've been able to\nhave dinner with really interesting\npeople\nand i admire the hell out of bill gates\njeff bezos but i've actually\nbeen able to pick their brains before\nelon i i'd like to figure him out\nnice what what about what would you ask\nhim what do you think's the most\nfascinating\nuh discovery you'd like to make daryl\nwhat are you curious about with him\ni would drill down on battery technology\nbecause i often find that truly being\ncurious\nabout something they're curious about is\na way to connect\nabsolutely beautiful i love that all\nright the third question\nwe're only on question three even though\ni've asked like four questions already\nuh question number three\nis uh what's the biggest thing you\nlearned about yourself in the last 12\nmonths i can't remember whether\naristotle or plato said it but\nyou know we're a social animal and it's\nreally\nhard for me to be\nlocked down i was not great during this\npandemic\ni still went out to dinner with friends\noutside socially distanced but i need to\nbe around\nother people i recharge my battery by\nlistening to other people\nbeautiful question number four as a\nprolific author what's\nyour favorite book and if you can't give\nme one you can have three\nwhat are your top three favorite reads\nin your own life and\nyour own journey the moviegoer by walker\npercy because it's about\nlike any great book including\nnon-fiction\nit's about a person goes on a journey\nand\nwe're all on a journey and that book\ngets it and speaking of great journeys\num moby dick i think uh\nyou could pick huck finn but moby dick\nis the same sort of thing\nand so is the odyssey it's a person goes\non a journey\nand moby dick it just grabs me because\nthe detail and the curiosity and the\npassion\nand uh third book\num\num let me pause i've answered too much\nand i mean i've\nsaid too many sentences i love a lot of\nother books i'm not sure i want to put\nthem in the pantheon with moby dick for\nme\nthat's fine that's beautiful and the\nfifth and final i did just\nread for the you know recently james\nbaldwin i've gotten into\nand tell me how long the train's been\ngone my dad wanted me to read it before\nhe died\nwow and um and i read eddie cloud's\nbook on james baldwin wow that's\nbeautiful thank you and then\nthe fifth and final question if you\ncould create one law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\nbe nice be nice i love it\nuh ever on walter isaacson a new book\nthe code breaker available right now go\nand grab a copy\nwe will put the link in the description\nuh please\nplease please go and read about jennifer\ndoudna i promise you you won't regret it\nuh and and to be honest i i do think\nthis is probably the most\nuh challenging challenging one for me in\nin the sense that because it's happening\nright now\nuh it presents so many more interesting\nconversations and questions in in a way\nthat\ni've never been challenged before so\nthank you so much for all the work\nyou've done walter\nuh i remain a fan and supporter and uh\nreally loved meeting you today and\nappreciate your energy through the\nscreen i look forward to have dinner\nhaving dinner with you hopefully one day\nuh and again i appreciate you so much is\nthere anything else you'd like to share\nwith our audience today that i haven't\nasked you about\nyou're a great interviewer i think you\nknow all the ways of being curious so\nthank you and also you're good at\nfollowing my one rule which is\nyou're very nice if you want even more\nvideos just like this one make sure you\nsubscribe and click on the boxes over\nhere\ni'm also excited to let you know that\nyou can now get my book\nthink like a monk
