becomes so\nchallenging for me to go through all her\ntransitions and changes so\nyou have to be disciplined you have to\ntake it seriously and the actors work is\nis never done i mean i'm in acting class\nwith some amazing actors that you're\nlike\nyou don't need to be an acting class and\nit's like no you constantly have to\nwork on your craft and sharpen your\nskill\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast for self\nwork and love thank you so much for\nbeing here i'm so grateful that you take\ntime out of your days\nevenings wherever you are to invest in\nyourself\nand personal growth this is on purpose\nyou're in the right place\nand today's guest is someone that i\ncan't wait to talk to i'm always\nfascinated by\npeople's meaningful experiences unique\nperspectives and backgrounds\nand today's guest will not disappoint\ntoday's guest is\nabsolutely incredible i'm excited to\nhear about her perspectives and\nviewpoints\non a few things that you really want to\nfind out about too\nand her background is phenomenal she's\nan american tv personality\nshe's a new york times best-selling\nauthor she's an executive producer a\nbusinesswoman\nand an actress her name is lala anthony\nlala thank you so much i am\nso happy to be here thank you so much\nfor having me oh no\nthis is exciting i know and i'm so\ngrateful because we literally got\nintroduced to each other recently i know\nand we're making this happen already but\ni feel like we've known each other\nforever we're just like\nhey it's a great connection and a great\nfeeling and i'm happy to be here\nabsolutely and i'm just warning the\naudience we were just about to get\nunder a cover of sleep because it's very\nzen in this room so\nzen in here it's so zen i was like i\njust need a robe and a blanket\ni love it we'll arrange for it\nafterwards okay if you have time but\nyou're on a busy schedule right now\nyeah you've been around promoting power\nsharing the world of powers let's start\nwith that tell us a bit about that\nso power i've been on the show for six\nseasons and\nseason six is premiering in august so we\nmade a big announcement today on\ngood morning america that it premieres\nin august it's also the final season of\npower which\npeople are disappointed about i know i\nfeel the same way so\nyou know this season is going to be just\na roller coaster ride which is\nwhat power is it never disappoints and\nour fans are\nsuper excited and we're excited you know\nfor the final season\nand just to kind of see where it takes\nall the characters and stuff\nabsolutely well that's what's happening\ntoday i want to go all the way back to\nthe beginning\nof you when you were 15. and you get\nthis break\nat hot 97 yes in atlanta\ntell me about why that experience was so\nmeaningful to you\nand how that was such a great start for\nyou so it started because i've always\njust loved music and i've loved\nhip-hop music from before i could\nremember and at 15\ni remember hearing that the wu-tang clan\nthey were opening up a clothing store in\natlanta and i had just moved to atlanta\nand i was like oh i gotta go see the\nwutei clad like\ni gotta get there you know in line like\neverybody else\nwaiting excited and i saw these people\nlike putting up posters and giving out\nflyers and i was like\nwhat do you guys do and they were like\noh we're interns for a radio station\nand i was like that's a cool job i would\ndo something like that\nand they were like well here's the guy's\nnumber you have to like call or email or\nsomething\nso i ended up emailing and he told me\nthat you had to be\num 18 to get the job\nso i went back to the hood got a fake id\nsaid i was 18 and got the job as an\nintern and that's kind of what\nstarted my career in radio\ntv acting producing film but it all\nstarted with\nyou know my love of music my love of\nhip-hop so\ni'm always just so gracious to music in\ngeneral because that's how my career\nstarted\ni love that kids go get a fake id if\nyou're\ntoo young to get a job no i love that\nbut sometimes what it takes is just that\npassion that persists exactly\nyou weren't gonna take no for an hour i\nwasn't gonna take no for an answer i\nwasn't gonna let\ntwo or three years get in my way so i\nwas like no i i'm doing this and\nit worked and eventually i was honest\nand told the truth but by then i had\nproven myself\nas a hard worker and dedicated and you\nknow secure the job and also at that\ntime at the radio station\nludacris was an intern as well he was\ngoing by the name of chris lovalova\nand he had been there you know a bit\nbefore me and we\nhit it off and we started a radio show\ntogether but it's incredible when i sit\nback now and just see\nhow far his journey has come and then\nalong with mine like\nhe used to just talk about i'm gonna be\nthis famous rapper one day\npeople are gonna buy my album i'm going\nto be an actor i'm going to do all these\nthings and to actually\nsee how you can manifest something just\nby believing it and saying it and then\nit really happens\nis such a fascinating thing to watch i\nlove that and what's the difference that\nyou've seen\nnow that you're saying tracking your\ncareer even ludicrous who you worked\nwith\nwhat have you seen is the difference\nbetween people saying things are going\nto happen\nand then actually making them come true\nwhether it's manifestation or\nbelief what has been the difference\nbecause i'm sure you've heard a lot of\npeople say stuff too and it didn't\nhappen for them i mean i definitely\nthink\na lot of it is the work you know putting\nin the work it's really easy to just say\nokay i want to do this but\nthere's so much work behind it and\nthere's so many\npeople or things that will get in the\nway of\nyou becoming whatever and a lot of us\nget so discouraged like by the time\nthe third door is closed in your face\nyou're like you know what\ni give up or maybe this is not it and a\nlot of it is you know\ntiming and you know things just kind of\nfalling in place for me it's definitely\na strong belief in god and it's about\nbeing blessed because i know none of\nthis would happen without any of that\nso you know things just started kind of\nclicking but i think with some people\nwe give up a little bit too fast or as\nsoon as it gets\nhard that's when we're like okay i'm\ndone i can't do this and\nand i think some of the best things come\nright after\nfear or right after you know those hard\nmoments that's when you finally get your\nbreakthroughs but some of us never get\nto see that because\nwe stop too early yeah you're so right\nmost of us stopped to yeah i think so\nyou're so right whether it's that third\ndoor or fourth door\nyou never know it's gonna be the seventh\nor the seventh year yeah but you've got\nto keep going what's been the fuel in\nyour life that's like kept you\npushing in those moments so i'm super\ncompetitive so i'm just like\nno one's gonna tell me no i'm gonna do\nthis no matter what and\ni have felt the way we just talked about\nwhen it comes to\nmy acting career because for so long\nit's like okay lala from\nmtv or la la the radio host and when i\nwanted to transition into acting\ni just felt like i wasn't being taken\nseriously because i was looked at at all\nthese other things and i always talk to\npeople about\nnot allowing yourself to be put in a box\nbecause people would love to put you in\na box okay\nyou're you know the host of this that's\nall you can do you're on the radio\nthat's all you can do and i'm like\ni don't understand that like i'm in\nacting class i'm taking it seriously i\nhave a passion for it why can't i do\nthat as well\nand so you know it's all about breaking\nbarriers and to this day i still\nhave to do that because i'm still la la\nfrom mtv i'm still la la the radio host\ni'm still la la with all these other\nthings behind my name\nand i just want to be looked at as lala\nthe actress who does an incredible job\non\nyou know the show power and other things\ni've done and continue to\ngrow from there yeah and i love that\nthat's such practical advice for people\ntoday\nbecause whatever our boxes are everyone\nhas them\nyeah everyone has them and whether it's\nboxes from your past\nor from even something like at one point\nit felt like your biggest break\nbut then it becomes your box it's so\nright that is\nthat is true and that's how i felt with\nmtv like i\nhave such a respect for mtv and it did\nso much for my career and at that point\ni was like\ni'm an mtv vj like when i was a vj i was\nyou know 19 years old and that's what\neveryone wanted to do that was when they\nwere like searching\nthe whole country to hire a vj and i\nbecame one and i remember it being like\nthe biggest thing and then as i was\nexiting from mtv\nit became the box because then it was\njust like you're a vj that's all you can\ndo you can do nothing else\nand i just had to continue to fight\nthrough that and i'm glad that i didn't\ngive up\nbecause there were many times where i\nwas like started believing well maybe\nthat is\nall that i can do and maybe after mtv\nthat was it like i reached my peak and\nit was great and that's all that's in\nstore for me but i had to believe\nthat there was more and kind of push\nthrough that yeah i love that i\npersonally find that so inspiring\nespecially because you've done it\nyeah like now when i'm hearing you say\nit and you've done that right broken out\nand\nyou know i was saying earlier you've\nbeen in new york times about selling\nauthor\nlike you've written two books two right\nyes\ntwo huge books you've been out there\nyou're an actress you're an executive\nproducer now like\ni feel like you've really done that and\nso for anyone who's listening right now\njust don't buy into the box don't buy it\ndon't buy into the box that people keep\ndon't buy into the box i'm always\ntalking about that and it's so\nimportant you can do more than one thing\nand actually be great at it like who's\nto say\nyou can only do this and only do that\nlike there's no such thing and there's\nno rules\nin life there's just no rules to any of\nthis we make our own rules and that's\nwhat we have to continue\nto remind ourselves of did you find\nthough that when you were doing that and\nbuilding it\nyou were like mastering one thing and\nthen building the next is that kind of\nhow it went\nfor me i would find like i always said\nwhen it when it started\nfeeling like a job i knew i was ready\nfor the next thing\nwhen i started feeling like okay i got\nto do this again today\nand i wasn't enjoying it as much that\nwas my trigger to say okay\nwell what's next so for me starting a\nradio okay what's next\ntv that seems like the transition okay\nnow i'm on tv i'm a host what's next\nokay acting that seems like the next\ntransition okay what's next producing\nwriting you know whatever so i would\njust know when it started feeling like\na job and i was losing my excitement for\nit so now i'm in a place where\ni'm super excited about acting i'm super\nexcited about\nproducing and my clothing line and you\nknow writing another book and\ncreating my own content so that's what\nall my energy\nis going into yeah you know right now\nabsolutely is this part of your clothing\nlight\nno it's a denim clothing line that's\navailable pretty much everywhere so um\nshout out to everybody that supports\nthat we're doing really well in the\ndenim space yeah no i i love that i\nthink that's such a powerful lesson to\nshare because i think\nso many of us have passions have desires\nand we're like oh but i haven't studied\nthat or i never learned that or i don't\nknow anyone who's done that\nand so when people see like people like\nyourself then they can break out but\ntell me one life lesson or\ncareer tip that you learned from each\nindustry because i think there are very\nfew people in the world that you can sit\nwith who've done a lot of different\nthings right\nsuccessfully and at a high level so tell\nme one thing that you learned from let's\nsay radio let's start there what was one\nthing that radio taught you\nso radio taught me to be confident in my\npersonality because\nradio no one sees you so you have to\nlead with your personality which is\nyour voice and what you're talking about\nyou have to draw people in with\nthat there's no antics of let me show my\nface let me do this this was\nbefore you know podcasts that are being\nrecorded and all this stuff you were\njust in a radio station\nand people didn't have a clue how you\nlook so it was all about\nwhat you were projecting on those\nairwaves and how you draw them in and\nthat's where i think i gained my\nconfidence in\nbelieving in myself and feeling like my\npersonality was enough because\nthat's what was driving people to listen\nto my show\nso that's what i learned from radio okay\nawesome tell us what you learned\nfrom being an actress from being an\nactress i just learned\nthat you can't fake it like you have to\nreally take it seriously and i'm still\nin classes and\nyou know i'm always asking questions\nabout acting and learning more an\nactor's job is never done like you never\nknow everything and then probably in\nmost things but like in radio i got to a\npoint where\ni knew a lot i knew how to work the\nboard i knew how to do the breaks i kind\nof had it all figured out there wasn't\ntoo much\nthat i couldn't do but in acting every\ncharacter is different so you never get\nto a point where you're like oh i've\nmastered this thing i can do it all i\nmean\neven my character on power changes so\nmuch that it becomes so challenging\nfor me to go through all her transitions\nand changes so\nyou have to be disciplined you have to\ntake it seriously and the actors work is\nis never done i mean i'm in acting class\nwith some amazing actors that you're\nlike\nyou don't need to be an acting class and\nit's like no you constantly have to\nwork on your craft and sharpen your\nskill um and that's what i learned for\nacting it's definitely\nbeen the tougher of my career choices\nabsolutely no it doesn't sound easy at\nall and this one's going to be\ninteresting because\ni'm writing my first book right now okay\nso it's going to ask you what did you\nlearn from writing two big books\nso i would definitely say the books i\nlearned that the books became like\ntherapy for me\nit became my own therapy session because\ni was able to just talk about\nfeelings and emotions that maybe i had\nnever talked about before\nthings that i had kept bottled in before\nand i felt like\nduring the process of writing the book\nit became very therapeutic to me it\nbecame like\na therapy session and i wasn't afraid to\nshare with the world\nand um it worked it worked you know\npeople really seem to like the books but\ni think for anyone writing a book and\nincluding yourself\npeople appreciate honesty they\nappreciate authenticity\nthey appreciate that we all have flaws\nlike none of us are perfect and i didn't\nwant to paint this\nperfect picture because i'm not perfect\nand i think people really\nrelated to that yeah and i love that\nabout you i've really loved that\nwhen we were prepping for this interview\nand my team and i were getting together\none of the things i do love about you is\nthat you're so raw\nand open and authentic thank you and\neven today when you walked into the room\nlike i felt your energy\ni was like this is so nice you know like\nwhen you're meeting someone for the\nfirst time even though you don't feel\nlike i feel like i've known you too\nright but it's like that's such a\ncomforting feeling and i think you\nreally give that to people\nand you give that to people through all\nyour work thank you even when i see you\nin movies i'm like oh she could be my\nfriend like you know\nyou know you're a friend of the main\ncharacter then you're like you know i'm\njust she could be my friend and that's\ni think that's a very that's a very\nunique talent i appreciate\nyou saying that and i do appreciate that\nand i found that in this\nindustry and in this world like people\nwant to work with people that they like\npeople want to work with people that are\nnice and sometimes we forget that like\np i can get a job over someone who might\nbe way more talented than me because\ni'm going to be nice to work with people\nare going to want to come to work and\nwork with me so for people out there\nlistening\nyou know it's just such a small thing\nbut kindness really does go\na long way and kindness can be that\ndeciding factor that sets you apart\nfrom somebody else so i try to never\nforget that yeah that's beautiful so\nwhen\nyou i'm bringing this up in context you\nwere 15 you were at hot 97 which is\nan amazing place when i was 15 i was a\npaper boy\nso i used to go deliver papers around so\ni still have five streets in my area i\njust put my headphones on\nand the only person i'd listened to at\nthat time was 50 cent oh my gosh and so\nyeah i just left him he was like\nreporting oh no way\nyeah yeah and so i put the headphones on\nand it was the get richer guy trying\nalbum\nand i would sit there and i would know\nevery word and i would go and deliver my\npapers listening listening to\n50 what's he like to work with oh he's\namazing i've known him since\nthe radio and mtv days so this is uh\nyou're talking almost a 15-year\nrelationship now you know of knowing\neach other and he's\nso talented i knew about the show before\nit came into existence and\nhe talked about it and how big it was\ngoing to be\nand everything he said came to for\nwishing and that's another example of\nspeaking it believing it and doing the\nhard work behind it and seeing it happen\nso\ni'm always super grateful to him for\nbelieving in me and giving me an\nopportunity because um\nit's been great it's been really great\nthat's awesome it's so nice for us to\nsee\nyou know powerhouses coming together\npeople collaborating i think it's such\nan important\nmessage for people everywhere yeah when\nthey see people coming together doing\nthings together rather than like we're\nall on our own islands and our own\ntowers\nright and we don't kind of see each\nother yeah but you know to see that i\nthink is such a powerful message no\nit definitely is and i think you know\nthat kind of energy feeds off each other\nbecause when you're around someone\nthat's powerful or successful like it\nmotivates you and you want to go harder\nso i like to surround myself\nwith people like that that keep me\nmotivated and i never feel like\ni'm doing enough even though i barely\nsleep i slept two hours last night\ni just i'm constantly moving you know\ni'm also a mom and that takes precedence\nover everything but\ni love just being around people that\nmotivate me to continue to be\nbetter i love that how have you done\nthat you brought that up and i want to\ndive into that\nhow have you done that you've\ncontinually evolved your career\nyou're learning you're going to acting\nclasses and you're a mother\nhow have you done that because i get a\nlot of parents listening to the podcast\nright\na lot of people are asking hey how do i\nbalance my passion and my purpose\nmy side hustle and all this kind of\nstuff so what are your thoughts on that\nso i get asked that question a lot and i\nthink for me you know i've been blessed\nto have a great family structure that\ncan help me\nyou know be able to do a multiple do\nmultiple different things but\nmy son is always and will always be my\ntop priority so i think\nyou have to prioritize like you know\nwhat's important and i realize that\nwe can't just do it all at one time so\ni've gotten good at like okay\nthis week this is my outside of cayenne\nmy son this is my priority i'm gonna\nfocus on\nthe clothing line stuff i'm gonna focus\non power i'm gonna like i just have to\nprioritize because there's so much going\non if i'm like\ntrying to do it all in one day i just\ndon't feel like i do\nthe best job at any of it so i think\nprioritizing is like\nthe first step yeah spot on yeah you can\nhave it all just not all at the same\ntime that\nis very true and i've always believed\nthat and as far as balance is concerned\nbalance is a funny thing because i feel\nlike balance changes and at different\npoints\nsomething is losing out so if i'm super\nsuper about the career and that\nyou know maybe it's a little less time\nwith cayenne if i'm all about cayenne\nthen it's less time with\nthe career so some things though it's\nlike a constant you know tug of war but\nyou you find a way to figure it out yeah\nand i think we put too much pressure on\nourselves yeah we do\nbecause we're like oh my god\neverything's gonna be equal this week\nnow i gotta spend equal amount of time\non this\nand my kid and my project and the\nclothing line\nyeah and it's you're gonna fail at that\nyou're gonna fail and i think we also\nput ourselves on these like timelines\nlike\nokay by it could be even an aged\ntimeline by\nyou know 30 i should be married with two\nkids and own a house\nand this and by 35 i should have this\nand then when you're looking and maybe\nlife isn't panning out that way all of a\nsudden you feel like a failure you feel\nlike you haven't\nyou know met these timelines and i think\nyou know we cannot put\nthose pressures on ourselves i mean\npeople have started careers way later in\nlife\nnow people are starting families way\nlater in life you know people are\ngetting married later in life and\nmarriage isn't even a priority to a lot\nof people anymore it's more about you\nknow\ncareer and being independent different\nthings so you just kind of gotta do\nwhat's best for you\nand don't feel like it's a timeline you\nhave to put yourself on or a checkbox\nokay 20 i did this 25 this 30 this\nyou just kind of got to just let it flow\nand everybody moves at a different pace\nyeah it's again not buying into the\nboxes it's just another type of box\nexactly and and those pressures\nare the worst because you're forcing\nyourself\nto make big decisions based on a\ntimeline that some random person\ninvented\nexactly right like exactly you're\nforcing yourself to make the biggest\ndecisions of life career decisions love\ndecisions\nhaving children decisions and the world\nhas changed over the world continues to\nchange over the years so a timeline that\nmight have made sense\n10 years ago now doesn't make sense we\nhave social media now we have different\naccess to different things so\npeople are just moving differently than\neven 10 years ago even five years ago so\nit constantly changes so these timelines\nare so out of date to me now like you\njust gotta kinda\nagain i think it's important to\nencourage people to move at their own\npace\nyeah i love that that's beautiful i've\nmade so many videos on that subject\nbecause it's so\nso prevalent in society where everyone's\ndefining their lives based on others\ntimelines\nanother thing i make a lot of videos on\nwhich i love that you comment on so\nopenly you've written books about his\nrelationships yes\nbecause i see so many people struggling\nwith relationships partly that's because\nwe only post the best stuff we only post\nthe stuff that looks nice and therefore\nwhen we look at everyone else on\ninstagram it looks like everyone's in\nlove the owner of\nthe best time yeah and i'm the only one\nthat's like in a\nyeah that's the situation yeah exactly\nlike that's how we feel like we feel\nlike i'm the only one who's like\nstruggling or not in love or not with\nsomeone or whatever it may be\nwhat are some of the biggest\nrelationship lessons that you've learned\nthat you think are really important for\npeople to hear\ni think that you know you have to focus\non your own relationship and not worry\nabout what everyone's doing and if you\ndon't have a relationship\nthat doesn't mean you're less of a\nperson it just means you're focusing on\nsomething else and i feel like\neverything\nhappens when it does and that's why they\nsay doing it for the gram everything on\nthe gram looks\npicture perfect and spectacular you got\nfilters you got\nface tune you got this you got that\neveryone's just like stepping out of\nvogue magazine\nat instagram like it's not real life you\nknow instagram is to showcase\nfor most people you know your best\nmoments for me i i show a little bit of\neverything but people want to showcase\nshowcase their best moments and it's not\nreal so you can't compare\nto that and only you know what's going\non in your relationship and your\nsituation i think\nthat's what matters and as long as\nyou're happy\nthat's ultimately what matters now if\nyou're not happy it shouldn't be based\non\nwhat everyone else is doing it should be\nbased on what's going on in your\nrelationship\nand if you're not happy then that's\nsomething for you to figure out but\none way to easily not be happy is to be\nconstantly comparing yourself\nto another relationship that you see on\ninstagram and you don't even know what's\ngoing on it takes\none second to smile for a picture or put\nyour arm around me jay let's act like\nwe're so in love\nand as soon as they say step like i hate\nyou like you don't know what's going on\nbehind the scenes so\nnever compare yourself or feel like you\nknow i have a lot of friends too that\nwill tell their partners like i wish you\nwere more like so-and-so or i wish you\nacted more like so-and-so\nbased on a social media picture or you\nknow just what they see on instagram i\nthink that's\na little unfair and i'm not saying\neveryone's unhappy you do have people\nthat are in amazing relationships and\nposting and just living this blissful\nlife and you know\nmore power to them but that's not across\nthe board that's not everybody\nyeah no i think that's a great principle\nnever to compare\nwhat you have going on to anyone else\nbecause you don't even know the story\nexactly you're only seeing one percent\nof it exactly so there's no point of\nstarting there absolutely and another\nthing that i get a lot of my audience\nreaching out about is breakups so many\npeople going through breaks uh breakups\nit's kind of like they feel like it\nconsumes their whole life\nwe've all been through breakfast right\nlike what are your thoughts around that\nwhen people are going through a breakup\nso what have you seen as the best\nlessons for healing and moving forward\ni think you know breakups are always\ntough when you're\nyou love somebody you give somebody your\nheart and it doesn't work out but\ni'm always an avid believer that you\nknow everything happens for a reason\nand while it's going on it doesn't make\nsense but how many times have\nwe look back later and say oh that's why\nthat happened or\ni wouldn't have been here if that didn't\nhappen i wouldn't have\nmet this person if that didn't happen\nlike you have to believe that things\nwork out the way they're supposed to\nand for me the best way to deal with\nthat is you know i\nkeep myself busy you know dive into\nsomething else whether it's your\nchildren or work\nor your passion and just keep good\nenergy around you and that'll help you\nkind of get through but sitting around\nalone or moping or like the world is\ncoming to an end\nthat's not gonna help i'm always like\nstay busy stay active you know just\nstart doing\njust start doing a lot of just\nstart going because that's the best way\nto keep your mind busy and ultimately\nyou'll start seeing that\nevery day it gets like a little bit\neasier yeah no and i think you're right\ni think when you're dealing with\nsomething and you get active about it\nand you don't just sit there and like\noverthink and procrastinate and then\njust over analyze\nright you start moving and then things\nstart coming up it's so true and then\nyou just have more momentum to deal with\nthem\nrather than if you just sit there you\ncan just literally feel like\neverything's closing in on you you\ndefinitely can\nyou definitely can so i would definitely\nsay you know stay moving and in the end\nit all somehow makes sense and again\nwhen you look back you're like\noh that's why that happened or that's\nwhy that didn't work out i felt like\ni mean i've had breakups where i was\nlike this is the end like\ni won't be able to wake up after this\nlike my life is\nover after this and now looking back\nit's like i see why it happened that way\nand maybe i wouldn't be where i am now\nif i stayed in certain situations that\nyou know were holding me back for\nwhatever reason so\nit all works out in the end it\ndefinitely does i i get a\nreal like when i'm when i'm around you\ntoday i'm getting a bit of like a\nspiritual frequency\nit's like you're praying on a something\nwell i will say jay you'll like this i\njust got back from uh\nhippocrates in uh west palm beach which\nis like a spiritual meditation center so\ni went there for a week\num i try to do that or an ashram every\nweek so i'm kind of\nevery week no every year yeah i'm kind\nof fresh off that\nand i just you're probably feeling a lot\nof that because hippocrates\nis all about like mental clarity and\nspiritual clarity and just\nkind of unplugging and getting in touch\nwith yourself and i think in this\nindustry\nit's just go go that it's nice to like\nnot be on the phone\nnot be on instagram and just really work\non you so i was there for a week and\ni always find it to be life-changing and\nkind of sent me\nset me on the path for what the rest of\nthe year\nis gonna look like that's beautiful what\nclarity did you gain from that what was\nit that stayed that stayed with you so\nfar i know it's only been a week yeah it\ndefinitely stays with me every time i do\nit is that like you're not missing\nanything\nyou know when you're not on instagram or\nanswering every email like\nthe world is still standing everything's\nokay like you're not missing anything\nokay you might not know\nwho wore what yesterday but doesn't\nreally matter in the big scheme of\nthings\nso it it allows you to appreciate more\nof the moments of just\nsitting outside and breathing the air\nlooking at trees\nyou know sitting and having\nconversations with people how often do\npeople even talk anymore we were at\ndinner\nlast night and we were literally like\nput your phones down because everyone's\njust on their phone and no one's\nenjoying each other or having\nconversation so at hippocrates you're\nforced to do that and you're also forced\nto mingle with people\nthat in your life you may have never\ncrossed paths with people from\nall over the world people dealing with\nillnesses from you know cancer to\naddictions to all kind of things\nand you're sitting there and you're\nrealizing that everyone is\nso similar and dealing with so many of\nthe same things so i was just inspired\nby a lot of those\nrelationships and conversations that i\nhad there and i really felt like i made\nfriends there\nthat i'll have for the rest of my life\noh that's beautiful yeah i do the same\nthing so i\ni don't know if i've told you before if\nyou knew that i lived as a monk for\nthree years okay i didn't yeah\nso i actually go back to india to live\nas a monk every year for 21 days again\nso i did it for three years\nokay when i was 22 to 25. okay and then\nnow every single year i go back for 21\ndays\nto a national so when is when is your\nnext january usually every january to\nstart my year and then it's the same\nthing it's like go away for three weeks\nand my team's like\nare you sure you want to go away for\nthree weeks like what's gonna happen i'm\nlike no trust me like\nthis my spiritual conviction is so high\nthat\nif this commitment it goes well and\ncorrectly then everything else will fall\ninto place see that\nif you don't get this foundation right\neverything else will fall apart and\nanother thing you'll\nyou'll always find that it never feels\nlike the right time\nyou can always talk yourself out of it\nit's another podcast another movie\nanother this and it's like now's not the\nright time but if you don't\nput your foot down and make it the right\ntime it's never going to be the right\ntime because i can always find\nmore work to do i can always find more\nto put on cayenne's schedule i can\nalways find more but i had to just stop\nand say\ni'm taking this week from myself to\nunplug and just do what i need to do and\ni even felt like a week\nwasn't even enough usually at\nhippocrates it's the same thing as a\nthree-week program\ni couldn't do that three weeks but when\ni was there i could see how people\neasily do the three weeks like you feel\nlike\nyou need that yeah absolutely yeah and\nwhenever i\nwhenever i've done that i've always\nrealized that even if i've missed out on\nbig things\nwhen i come back better things come to\nyou yeah for sure i've noticed that\nevery time and i'm not just saying that\nas a cliche it's real like\nright every time i go there i make that\ncommitment i know i'm missing out on a\nfew things but as soon as i come back\nbetter doors open right right and yeah\nthat is so cool that you do that\nwe're going to talk more about it you\nsee my eyes i'm like i'm into that i'm\nlike do you ever take someone with you\ni'm like\ni want some details yeah yeah exactly\nyeah we should go together i used to do\nretreats to india every year\nwow and take people because i wanted\npeople to have the same experience of\ndisconnecting being somewhere where\nyou're not familiar with and when you go\nsomewhere where you don't know anyone\nand no one knows you\nthe growth is just incredible and that's\nhow i thought of hippocrates like no one\nknow\nknew who i was i was just like everyone\nelse and just connecting and it was so\ncool\nit was about the last day that people\nstarted to like wait are you\nbut up until then it was just like just\nlearning people and being my authentic\nself and not like feeling like i had to\nbe on per se and and that was just such\nan incredible experience\nawesome so we've got our final five\nquestions that we do on every episode\nthese are a rapid fire so you can either\nanswer with one word okay\nthree words or one sentence like that's\nit no more than that okay\ni'm giving you the barriers because okay\nguys sometimes guests like to\nshare more okay okay so the first\nquestion i'm going to ask you is what\nfeels like your biggest accomplishment\nso far my son\noh that's beautiful i love that okay\nnext question what's the first thing you\ndo when you wake up\nthank god for another day awesome what's\nthe last thing you do before you go to\nbed\nthank god for another day love it that's\nbeautiful\nuh what is a mantra that you live by\nlove yourself from the inside out and\nthat's something my dad taught me but\nloving yourself you can tell us more if\nyou okay loving yourself from the inside\nout and i want to\ngive that to our listeners here today\nbecause it's something that i live by\nand it's something that's so important\nyou know we're so worried about the\nouter\nthe clothes the makeup to this or how do\ni look that we forget to love ourselves\nfrom the inside out\nand to me that's where it all starts\nwith so you could see people\nlike with wack clothes hair looking\ncrazy but for some reason they're like\nshining in the room and super confident\nand feel great because they're loving\nthemselves from inside out it has\nnothing to do with\nall this exterior stuff so i have to\nalways remind myself\nto love myself from the inside out\nawesome and fifth and final question if\nyou could get everyone in the world\nto do one habit or one practice every\nsingle day for 30 days what would it be\ni think it would be to look in the\nmirror\nand give yourself a compliment i just\ndon't think we do that enough\nlike we spend so much time wanting\nto get outside recognition or you know\nsocial media recognition\nor likes or comments like we have to\nlove ourselves and give ourselves that\nlove before we expect to get it from\nanyone else or\nyou know feel validated because it comes\nfrom everyone else so\nthat's the first thing i could think of\ni love that no one's ever said that\nbefore\nthat's awesome i like the answer you're\namazing we're gonna have to do another\none of these\ni would love to go deep you know i gotta\nhear about this\nindia trip like i have a lot more that\nwe should definitely talk\namazing but i am so glad that you\nbrought me here today yeah me too\nthank
