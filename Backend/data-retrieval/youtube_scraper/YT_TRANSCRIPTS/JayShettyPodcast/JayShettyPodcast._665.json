    "transcript": "there's very little correlation between\nhow much money you have in the level of\nhappiness past the basics of\nassistance level the element that\nthere's the highest correlation with is\nan element of community\nwho you're with so it's this meaningful\nwork\nare you on a mission and meaningful\nrelationships through a life arc\nthat evolves so that's my definition of\nsuccess\nis more like evolving well\nand contributing to evolution\nhello everyone welcome back to on\npurpose the number one health podcast\nin the world thank you so much for being\na part of this community\nthank you for committing to your growth\nto your self-development\ntaking out the valuable time of your\nlives to use it to become better to grow\nand to learn you could be doing anything\nin the world right now whether you're\nwalking your dog whether you're\ncommuting\nor whether you're at work and trying to\nlearn more thank you for making this\ncommitment to wisdom\nand to knowledge and you know that my\ncommitment to you on this podcast is to\nintroduce you to the people\nthe ideas the messages that can\ntransform your work\nlife and love and today's guest is going\nto do\njust that i'm so excited personally this\nhas been someone that i've been wanting\nto bring to you on the podcast\nfor a long time so i'm gonna have to\ncontain my excitement as well\nbut he's an american billionaire\ninvestor hedge fund manager and\nphilanthropist\nand the author of this incredible book\ncalled\nprinciples now i read this book when it\nfirst came out\nand there were so many incredible\ninsights of wisdom in there\nand today i get to sit down with the one\nand only ray dalia ray thank you so much\nfor being here\nwhoa oh like i don't deserve all that\nbut\nback at you thank you no you're very\nkind you're very kind and i'm so\ngrateful to have this opportunity with\nyou\nbecause i truly believe that i'm so\ngrateful you said on the phone when we\nwere speaking\nthat there are these different stages of\nlife and i'm so grateful that you're at\nthe stage of your life where you are\nsharing everything you've learned with\nall of us because i think there's such a\nwealth of knowledge that we all have to\ngain from so\nthank you for me and everyone else who's\nlistening and watching for taking this\nnext stage in your life well it's a\ntreat and a\nresponsibility so i'm happy to do it\nthank you for helping me\nabsolutely absolutely so today i want to\ndive into\nlife and work and many different areas\nthat you speak about in your incredible\nbook principles\nand the first thing i want to dive into\nis these stages of life you speak about\nbecause when you said that to me on the\nphone the other day\nthey really resonated why don't you\nguide the audience through those\ndifferent stages and phases\nand how you see them changing our life\nwell i think there are\nto simplify there are three stages in\nyour life the first stage in your life\nis when you're learning and you're\ndependent on others\ngo to school come out graduate from\nschool\nit's very different from the second\nphase of your life where you're working\nothers are dependent on you and you're\ntrying to be successful\nand that's uh what\nlarger your audience is uh in in that\nearly stages\nso i'm so excited to speak to them and\nthat whole arc\nis totally different like on the first\narc first part of the life\nyou know you pretty much follow a track\nyou know what schools parents taking\ncare of you whatever it is and then you\nwhat do you what decisions do you make\nyou hardly make any decisions\nyou may you know okay what college do\nyou go to if you go to college then you\ngo to the college and you what major do\nyou have\nand then you come out to this world the\nsecond stage in which really the whole\nthing is wide open to you\nparticularly if you don't go stay on a\ntrack\nand you realize that there's no\ninstruction manual and you can go\nanywhere and you could do anything\nand then it's a very different phase\nit's a more difficult phase\nand that second phase then has an arc to\nit and then um somewhere in the vicinity\nof\nyour last phase that's the phase where\nyou're free to live and free to die\nand your preferences change you change\nyour relationships with others change so\nthat's the life arc that i'm referring\nto and so i'm in the transition from the\nend of my second phase\nto the beginning of my third phase and\nat that phase i just want to pass along\nwhat i've\nlearned to help people who are early in\ntheir second phase\nyeah absolutely and you're so right that\nis the majority of people that are\nlistening and watching right now\nand for me you brought something up\nreally interesting there one of the\nbiggest things is we become\nparalyzed by choice and decisions\nbecause so much of that early phase is\nwhere things were decided for us\nwhat choices were made for us and i\noften feel we bring that mindset to the\nsecond\nphase where we're still looking for\nsomeone else\nto help tell us what to do and what\ndecision to make and what's the right\nthing to do\nhow have you seen through your\nexperiences how have you\ndealt with choice and decision as that\nphase of life changes\nwell i think first of all one has to\nknow their nature\num you might have to discover it\nbut your nature means do you have a\nsense of adventure do you seek security\nare you an extrovert an introvert those\ntypes of things so personal discovery is\nimportant\ni think that who you're with\nand where you are is more important than\nwhat you do\nbecause in the early phase of that\nsecond phase\nit's total discovery so it's\nexperimentation\nyou know you went to india for three\nyears right yes and and that\nbut if you have that sense of adventure\nto let go\nyou can discover that's your opportunity\nbut discover yourself\nas well as to discover what the choices\nare like and then as you move later into\nthat\nyou'll feel the pulls um and\nto feel never trapped we were talking\njust before we began\nthat so many people say um you know i\ncan't be that way\nbecause i my job won't allow it uh which\nis a silly concept\nbecause you have the freedom of those\nchoices even in when you have\nconstraining uh situations\nso i think that's the life arc\nenjoy this wide open choice you can be\nanywhere in the world\nyou can do almost anything let go\nexperiment and then move on absolutely\nand did you feel that same freedom when\nyou started as well\nor do you feel it's changed now do you\nthink there's in my case\nin my case um okay in my case\nuh when i was 12 i\ngot hooked on trading markets so i\ni love that game so i discovered it\nearly\nand then i and then i wanted to but i\nhad this\nsense of adventure i was very i\ndiscovered when i went to\nwork at a company that i working in the\ncompany was not my thing\ni got fired i punched my boss i i mean i\nso and i really then learned the freedom\num not i didn't have any idea that i was\nsetting up a company i just sort of said\ni can do these things probably like you\nyou discovered okay i could do those\nthings\nand then one thing leads to another and\nthen you know uh\nyou build and i always like the variety\nso\ni'm my nature is macro so i like going\nall over the world\nall different cultures understanding how\nthe world works\nand so i found something that clicked\nthrough that experimentation\nyeah but then there's ups and downs\nright lots of ups and downs\nso we need to talk about failure uh you\nknow how great\nfailure is yeah let's let's do that\nbecause i think when i'm hearing you say\nthat\nit's so refreshing because when i hear\nyou saying yeah i had to figure it out\nand i was experimenting and testing and\ni didn't even know what i was building\ni love hearing that because that's what\nmy experience so far\nhas been too as opposed to like a very\nrigid\nstrategic you know that there isn't\nstrategy of course there is but\nsomething very rigid and planned\nthere is a lot of experimentation in\nthat growth where failure is natural\nyeah uh my son uh\nin 2014 gave me a book uh joseph\ncampbell and was called\nhere of us a thousand faces and it\nrefers to the hero's journey\nand this is like at the end of my\nexperience and i\nfollow found that that's very very true\nand so there's this cycle so a\ncertain type of personality wants a\ntaste for adventure\nyou go out and have the adventure and\nthen there are these\nups and downs and then you crash you\nwill have a failure\nif you're adventurous and you're pushing\nthe limits\nyou will have a failure and that failure\nis a can be a transformative experiment\nexperience\ni have an expression that pain plus\nreflection\nequals progress so they call it the bet\nuh the abyss and change\nthe learning of humility to maintain\nyour aggressiveness your audacity and to\nsimultaneously learn humility and that\nhappened to me\ni was um so i you described it i was uh\ni graduated\nuh from school i two years i worked on\nwall street for two years\ni got fired from my job and two years\nlater i'm running my little company\nsomething like seven eight years after\nthat\num i made terrible mistakes in the\nmarkets\num i crashed and i\nlost everything and i was so broke\nthat i had to borrow four thousand\ndollars for my dad to help pay for my\nfamily expenses\nand it was public publicly because i was\non wall street week and i\nmade all those mistakes and that was\none of the most painful pain can be\ngreat\nbecause it changed my whole perspective\nto decision making\nas i'm saying it gave me the humility i\nneeded\nto operate with my audacity in other\nwords to simultaneously be bold and\naggressive\nand also to know that i could\nbe careful you know i i learned that if\nyou're doing risky things anybody who\ndoes risky things\ntight rope walk across buildings or\nwhatever\nit's that they also know how to deal\nwith the risks well\nso how to be bold and then to learn from\nthe failures and it changed my whole\napproach to failure i began to think\nof failures like puzzles\nthat if i could solve the puzzle i'd get\na gem\nand the puzzle was what would i do\ndifferently in the future\nand the gem i would get would be a\nprinciple of how i would deal with the\nfuture\ndifferently so understanding that if you\npress the limits\nyou're going to fail and it's okay and\nlife is a long journey\nfailure has a tone to it that it sounds\nlike it's an\nend no it's part of that process\nof learning and then making that uh\ngreat advance\nbut the humility combined with the\naudacity was helpful because then i\nwould go to try to find\nthe smartest people i could find who\ndisagreed with me\nthat independent thinking and i would\nalso know how to deal with my risks\nbetter\nso i kept my upside without losing my\ndownside\nso that's failure and pain if you look\nat the second order effects if you make\nthe most\nof them they're the most valuable\nabsolutely and i love that balance that\nyou've just spoke about or that bringing\nof the two together of\nhumility and audacity i've never heard\nit like that before and\ni i really value that because i can see\nwhy\nhumility is so powerful but not that\nthat humility stops you from having that\nboldness and that courage\nand almost like how have you maintained\nthat because i'm guessing that being at\nrock bottom\nlike having to borrow four thousand\ndollars can be\nvery painful and then when you're\nexperimenting again and going on your\nnext adventure you've got to be okay\nwith the fact that that could happen\nagain\nor was that humility holding that back\nhaving that happen again\ni think the type of walker crossing the\nuh building is\nis that is the example right yes you you\nyou fall and you fall hard\nnow some people won't get on the tight\nrope again yeah some people will get on\nthe tightrope again\nand then they think how do i do that so\nhow do i be\nbold and aggressive and i pull it off\nand it's the same way right you start to\nthink well\nmaybe i do this or that differently and\ni practice more\nit's that combination of the caution\nand practice that allows you to take it\nto the limits that you never would have\nbeen able to take it to before\nright i learned that once i learned that\neverything changed because i also would\nknow how to\ntake the hits in other words i don't\nmind getting banged\nbut i don't want to get knocked out of\nthe game yes so the willingness to get\nbanged but not knocked out of the game\nis a big part of that\nabsolutely yeah like a good fighter\nright are you just giving that analogy\nfor me it's like\nsometimes a boxer or a fighter needs to\nknow which punches to take\nin order to be able to drop a bigger\npunch uh that's that's part of the game\nand\nthat's what you were saying about\nsolving a puzzle i love that analogy\nbecause i think if we see everything as\npuzzles that there's a way of figuring\nit out\nright you know there's an answer to a\npuzzle yes i think the key\nis to think of reality as\nyou're given reality is reality\nand think of it as working like a\nmachine there are cause effect\nrelationships that make the realities\naround you\nokay now if you go above yourself and\nyou look at that\nhow does that machine work and then\nhow do i interact with that machine to\nget what i want\nand you do that with an equanimity\nmeditation also helped me a lot\nyes i learned to meditate very\nmany years ago um and uh if you\nif you have equanimity and you look at\nit above and you look at with curiosity\nand you say oh i must not be interacting\nwell with that my reality\nand how do i change it and how does it\nwork it's a very powerful way of\napproaching life\nabsolutely and that definition of\nquantum media too\nequanimity means to deal with good and\nbad\nyeah and and so how have you i'd love to\nknow how you\ncelebrate and embrace successes in your\nlife too we just spoke about failure\ni'm intrigued to know how someone like\nyourself deals with success\nwell i think my approach my thinking\nabout success has evolved over a period\nof time\ni i thought about success i today think\nabout success differently\nuh it's like um the way i thought about\nit originally when\ni uh you know you have this failure uh i\nthought that\nit's like there's a jungle out there um\ni want to have the great greatest life\npossible\nbut in order to be successful i can i\nhave to cross this dangerous jungle\nnow i could stay on the one side of the\njungle and have a\na boring safe life but\num unless i deal with the risks um risks\nin return go together\nand it's like going into this jungle so\nwhat would i choose\nwould i choose to go into the jungle and\ncross the jungle and have the greatest\nlife possible but i might\nyeah bad things might happen and then i\nstarted to think when i went into that\njungle i\nof course i had to cross the jungle but\ni started to realize\nhow to cross the jungle most importantly\nwith people\nwho could see things differently than i\ncould\non the mission with me and so they and\nwe would protect each other in that\njungle and that's what it was like\nso life is a lot like that who are you\nin the jungle with\nand they might see things differently\nfrom you and then you\nprotect each other and you go through\nand the thing that i discovered\nwas that as i had these successes and\nfailures and much more\nsuccesses than failures i began to\nrealize\nthat i didn't care as much about the\nsuccess as i cared about the journey\nokay in other words i didn't want to get\nout of the jungle i didn't want to get\nto the other\nside because it might be like i don't\nknow climbing\nmountains or doing whatever you realize\nthere's a new peak and there's a new\nlevel of success\nand it won't keep you happy okay\nyou don't sit there you want to go on\nyes and and\nit is the ups and downs of that journey\nand the striving into becoming better\nthat becomes the new\ndefinition of success and so i started\nto see my life in this life\narc way with my preferences changing\nbecause your preferences naturally\nchange as one has kids\nand as they as they start to think i\nmean everybody that you're dealing with\nis going through a life arc\nif you think about who are the people\nyou love\nwhat is your relationship with your\nparents what are your relationships you\nhave children\nwho will they will have a life arc and\nas you go through that life arc and you\nsee those things changing then you start\nto realize\nthat operating consistent with that life\narc\nis and on that journey to evolve well\nis what success is it's not yes\nthe money it's like money loses its\nmarginal utility very quickly right if\nyou\nstudies of happiness um there's a\nharvard professor\nmany professors i suppose and they tell\nyou the same thing in terms of\nstudying happiness around the world\nthere's very little correlation between\nhow much money you have in the level of\nhappiness past the basic sub\nassistance level the element that\nthere's the highest correlation with is\nan element of community\nwho you're with so it's this meaningful\nwork\nare you on a mission and meaningful\nrelationships through a life arc\nthat evolves so that's my definition of\nof success is more like evolving well\nand contributing to evolution yeah\nabsolutely and i couldn't agree more and\nthose stand so true from my monk\ntraining too so hearing them from you in\na\ndifferent context is so encouraging to\nhear and for anyone who's watching or\nlistening right now\nplease make sure that as ray is speaking\nyou're visualizing his beautiful\nanalogies because as i'm sitting here\nlistening to you\ni'm visualizing being in the forest i'm\nvisualizing being around people i'm\nlooking at the people in my life and\nseeing them as different aspects and\nray paints such a beautiful picture as\nhe speaks so if you're listening right\nnow\nanytime he shares an analogy or a story\nput yourself in that place because it's\ngoing to help you go there deeper\nand i think you do a brilliant job with\nthat ray in some of your videos i saw as\nwell the\nanimations really bring that to life so\ni can see them in my mind tell us about\nhow you've been so\ncareful about curating and constructing\nthat community for yourself you said\nthat\nyou found people in the woods who could\nsee what you couldn't see and you\nprotected each other\nwhich i love it was it was an\nevolutionary process you know\num so you're on a mission you're on a\nmission yes\nand you have people are on the mission\nwith you yes and then you start to\num i started to find um\nwhat do i want in those people and what\nshould the relationship be\nand i first just picked people i liked\nand i didn't realize how we see things\ndifferently\nhow we process things so differently our\nminds work so differently\num and so when you start to see let's\nsay\nthere's a big picture thinker there's a\ndetail thinker\nand we all become frustrated with the\nother person\nbecause they like the big picture says\nwhy are you so hung up with those\ndetails\nlet's go to the big picture and the\ndetail thinker thinks\num you've got your head in the clouds\nyou've got to come down to the nuts and\nbolts\nand they're both right and they start to\nrealize that you need\neach other you start to need the\ndifferent ways of\nthinking so i would convey that that\nmany people see things very differently\nand how do you deal with those\ndifferences in seeing\ntheir disagreements how do you deal with\ndisagreements\nmy approach and i learned is\nwhenever you're in a disagreement and\nyou don't know how to deal with it well\nbecause it's not going well\npause and then step above the\ndisagreement together\nand then say uh what are the protocols\nfor us\nto disagree well how should we do this\nthing always go to the higher level and\nthink\nhow should you do that thing and so you\nget protocols\ni've developed these protocols like a\nprotocol would be like if we're\nnot being able to communicate well\ntogether a standard protocol\nis let's mutually agree on someone who\nwill help moderate this conversation\nand then we'll work things through or\ntalking\nhow do i repeat what you're saying so\nthat i'm\ni'm conveying that i understand and you\nstart to develop those types of\nprotocols\nand start to develop the appreciations\nof\npeople seeing things differently you\ndiscover also\ndifferences in values differences in the\nmore\nthe most core principles of how people\nshould be with each other\nin my case it was so essential that\nwe're going to be\ncompletely radically truthful\nand radically transparent with each\nother right\num and that was my discovery\num and it's difficult but i've also\nlearned that\nmany cases the difficult things\nare only the first order consequences\nthey're difficult the second order\nconsequences is\nthey're rewarding and so by being able\nto have\nthat radical truthfulness and that\ntransparency to demonstrate that there's\nno spin\nwas a discovery so there's an\nevolutionary arc\ni would say um in my culture\nam i building a an organization a\ncommunity that was uh beneficial\ndescribe it in in one sentence yes long\nsentence\nit's an idea meritocracy in other words\nit's a place where the best ideas win\nout regardless of\nhierarchy so an idea meritocracy\nand with the goal in which the goals are\nmeaningful work and meaningful\nrelationships\nmeaningful work to be on a mission\ntogether and\nmeaningful relationships is an equal\nimportance of that\nand that produces this tough love so um\ni'll repeat it i'm saying too many words\nso it's an idea meritocracy in which the\ngoals of meaningful work and meaningful\nrelationships\nthrough radical truthfulness and radical\ntransparency\nanyway that was my wow that's what\nworked for me that's incredible and i\nguess\nall of these tools you were mentioning\nearlier about these protocols\nat a consistently realigning everyone\nwith that because as we start\nwearing away and you start seeing lack\nof transparency or lack of truthfulness\nor\nlack of meaning and mission you're\nconstantly having to realign everyone\nright and that true let's talk about\nthat radical truthfulness and radical\ntransparency\nif you if you can achieve it\nthere's no confusion\nbecause if we're really truthful we're\ntaking all those hidden agendas and all\nthose other things and we're not\nconfused we're putting them on the table\nyes\nand if you understand the art of\nthoughtful disagreement\nhow to disagree well so that you can\nthen\nlearn from each other or get past your\ndisagreement\nin an idea meritocratic way it\nis incredibly powerful\nand the we're not taught that we're not\ntaught some of these things we're not\ntaught the value of failure\ndefinitely not we're not taught um\nwe're taught to be right to be attached\nto\nour views of being right yeah you can't\nlearn\nno if you're attached to being right\nbecause you think it's embarrassing\nbecause you don't know\nso that notion of thoughtful\ndisagreement because if there's\ndisagreement\nsomebody must be wrong and how do you\nknow that wrong person isn't you\nso these are the things that if you have\nthoughtful disagreement\nuh radical truthfulness radical\ntransparency you build trust and\neffectiveness\nyeah and that really sounds like it\nrequires the pulverizing of the ego\nlike that to me sounds like we really\nhave to crush and break down this ego\nbecause our ego's what's\nwe're confronted with believing i'm\nright i'm gonna win\nright whenever you're in a disagreement\nand you handle it badly\nit's you think it's win or loss that's\nright i think\nthe greatest tragedy of mankind\nbig statement the greatest tragedy of\nmankind okay\nthe greatest tragedy mankind because\nit's so much it stands in\nthe way of so many people making\ndecisions well\nand operating well with each other is\nbeing is holding an opinion in your head\nthat's wrong\nand it's such a tragedy meaning it's so\neasily fixed\nthat all you have to do is put it out\nthere and stress test it\nand say i might be wrong and how do i\nstress test it\nand by stress testing it you raise your\nprobabilities of being right\nso i think the education system rewards\nbeing right\nso many things reward that being right\nthat stands in the way of taking in\nall that's out there to really help you\nbe right\ni think that's such a powerful point i'm\njust nodding away\nif you're only listening then i'm\nnodding away because\nwhen you say that i think that's so true\nthat all of our conditioned patterns\nare about being right it's never been to\nunderstand things from different angles\nor perspectives which is what\nreality is much more of than being right\nor wrong or black or white\nand so much of our patterns in our mind\nare always win or loss right or wrong\none or two there's rarely this cohesive\nsynergy that you're speaking about that\nactually takes a lot more work to get to\nthe greater whatever success i've had in\nlife has had more\nmuch more to do with my knowing how to\ndeal with my not knowing\nthan anything that i know because what i\ndon't know\nis vastly greater think about all the\nexperts that you can turn to\nand all the perspectives that you can\nget and how much you can learn\nby being what's being out there and that\nmaximizes\nand it's a kick yeah absolutely\nabsolutely one of the things the other\nthing\nwhich we've already dive into today you\ncalled your book principles\nand i thought that that was quite a\ncounter-cultural way of doing it in a\ngood way in in a and the reason i say\nthat is today\nso much of the language around business\nand work\nor entrepreneurship is around doing it's\naround having it's around\ngrinding it's you know these are the the\nterms and the language that's used\naround business whereas you go back and\nyou talk about principles\nand on the phone when we were speaking\nyou were talking about this\ndifferentiation between\ndoing and then living a principled life\njust explain that to us and why you\nbelieve we have to start with principles\num i'm going to um\nstart by explaining how i learned it yes\nand what principled\nthinking is and how it's different from\nother types of\nnormal thinking most what most people do\nright yeah um\nand there's also a suggestion i'd like\nto pass along to\nuh those who are listening\nwhat i found was that whenever i would\nmake an important decision\ni would write down my criteria for\nmaking that decision\nbecause that situation would come across\nalong again so i could be clear it\nhelped me clarify my thinking\nand when the next time it came along i\nwould start to see\nhow to deal with that and i could refine\nmy principles\nso the book is a compendium of these\nprinciples that i wrote over\n25 years on that situation\nit changed my way of thinking and it\nalso changed my way of interacting\nbecause then i would see everything as\nanother one of those\nrather than be in the blizzard of these\nbits and pieces of things coming at me\ni would start to think oh it's one of\nthose\nyes and i would then operate as what was\nmy principle\nand those principles became like in\ninternalized so think of it almost like\na batter batting against a pitcher\nwho sometimes throws curveballs\nsometimes throws\nfastballs sometimes throws sliders\nand if you do that over a period of time\nyou begin to learn\noh that's a fastball and then you start\nto\nthink okay the fastball i operate this\nand you\nstart to internalize you become better\nand better\nand life becomes simpler for you because\nyou're not seeing those millions of bits\nand pieces\nyou're seeing it out as another one of\nthose\nand you have that instinctual uh ability\nthat allows you to then make that\ndecision and operate that way\nand then you can communicate with people\non principle levels\nthinking you know um it's particularly\nimportant because\ni would say the decline of religion the\ndecline\nin other words even your values\nyou have to think what is your\nreligion if you chose a religion and\nit's not a preconditioned religion what\nare your\nvalues what are your principles how do\nyou think life really works\nand you're making choices for yourself\nthat is the form of those principles so\nwhen you start to think about those\nand you're clear about those and you can\ncommunicate with\nothers you can see whether your\nprinciples are aligned with others or\nnot\nbecause they that you'll if you don't\nget along with somebody\nand those irreconcilable differences are\ndue to the fact that there are deep\ndifferences in principles\nnot differences in interpretations of\nthings and so on\nit's like any great relationship\nthere'll be arguments along the way\nbut it is those core beliefs and by\nbeing\nclear about them it's clear to yourself\nand clear to others\nit's very powerful yeah absolutely i\ncouldn't agree more it just makes it so\nmuch more simpler to navigate\nbecause you're so right that when you\ndon't have that clarity\nall you're being attacked with is so\nmuch noise and there's just so many\nmillions of different pieces of noise\nthat are coming at you\nthat you haven't filtered you haven't\nclarified you haven't carefully selected\nand that's why we feel so overwhelmed\ntoday we're drowning in\nall of that noise what for exactly\nwhere are you going what for\nwhat are you seeking to fulfill what is\nit in you\nyeah and and i think that this is where\ni'd recommend everyone who's listening\nor watching right now i'd love for you\nto take a moment to do that exercise in\nyour own time that\nrey's just laid out of really figuring\nout what are your criteria behind\ndecisions\nwhy you're making those decisions what's\npushing you towards them for me as well\nwhenever i have a number of options what\ni do is i write down all my options and\nchoices i have\nand i write down on top of them why i\nwould take them and often my why for\nsomething would be just pride or ego and\noften above one of them it'll be love\nand depth and values\nwell here's the exercise you're talking\nabout the writing down\nyes okay i'm saying the writing down\ni recommend to your listeners write them\ndown\nokay do your reflections and then you\nwrite them down\nit helps it clarifies it the other thing\nthat happens is\ni think uh of the mind as uh being\nthey're\nalmost two u's in you there is a\nconscious logical you and there's a\nsubliminal\nemotional you yes that you don't\nunderstand that was\nfreud's great discovery yes that there\nis a part of your brain that is really\ncontrolling you\nbut because it's not conscious to you\nyou don't\nknow it's there and it's controlling you\nand\nthe key i think is to align those things\nlike there's intuition or there's those\nemotions\nand when they come up and you're seeing\nyourself doing things\nif you can reflect on yourself and align\nyour subliminal with your cerebral\nyou it it helps you because that you\nhave a double check\num that emotional thing like maybe it's\nan intuition well maybe it's right and\nmaybe it's wrong\nso respect it it's coming up but look at\nit with that logical\nand when you achieve that alignment\nwriting helps you do that\nabsolutely absolutely i couldn't agree\nmore and if you if you're sitting there\ngoing i'm not a writer first try\nand if after trying if you still feel\nyou're not a writer voice note yourself\nspeak it out to yourself and hear\nyourself\nback because when you hear because\nyou're used to listening to other people\nyou'll also be able to start listening\nto your subconscious self\nand that's going to help you really try\nand bring that alignment and clarity\ntogether\nand then you'll start to see that\nthere's a limited number maybe a few\nhundred\nmaybe a couple hundred circumstances or\nwhatever you're going to start to see\neverything happens over and over again\nyou're going to understand\nyourself better it's very\nwonderful absolutely i love that in one\nof these principles you talk about\nthis scale of savoring the experience\nsavoring life\nthen making an impact and i wanted to\nknow how you reconcile the two and\nand how you've seen them well i i think\nthe big choice in life and a lot of big\nchoices in life but\nis uh accomplishment versus savoring\nlife\nokay so you know savoring life is\nuh smell the roses and\nwhat a beautiful day or that moment\nmake sure you uh time with the people\nthat you love\nand all of that and then there's the\nother which is\naccomplishment and impact right\nso there is those kinds of choices you\nhave to discover yourself\nwell where are you and how do you deal\nwith those types of things\ni think to be most effective is where\nthey align\nright okay that's what that's that's i\nthink the key\nright like to to make your work your\npassion one and the same\nright that kind of thing yes so um\nthat that's that's i think that's the\nbest okay your accomplishment\nif you're passionate and then you\ncan maybe have those things aligned but\nthat's that's the choice in life right\nand you could see it in different\ncultures yes\nyeah and today we see a lot of today\nwith all of the generations that we're\nin and seeing in work right now there's\na desire to have it all\nthere's a desire to have great pay\na great job that's meaningful and have\nlots of time off to go on holiday\nand be able to you know go out on a\nfriday night and have a good time and i\nfeel like this desire to have\neverything is quite a challenge because\nthen you\ntrying striving to have all of these\ndifferent paths but\num that's the what the second phase of\nthe life is like\nfirst phase of the life is you know you\nlearn\nand really it's generally a lot of fun\nand also by the way you think you can\nconquer the universe and it's\nthen you come to this other phase where\nit's all open and so on\nand what you find out is there are too\nmany things to do\nyou don't have enough time okay you\ndon't have enough time for each one of\nthose things\nand so the question is how do you\ndeal with that well there are two ways\nyou can deal with it\nyou can of course prioritize and\nyou need to do that but the real\nway most importantly is to\nknow how to get the most out of an hour\nin other words you can put more life\ninto life\nif you know how to get leverage and if\nyou know how to be as\nas effective because if you get more out\nof each hour\nwow then you it's like more life within\nthose\nconstrained number of hours absolutely\nabsolutely i've always described that\nfor me as time management versus energy\nmanagement\nand for me if i can bring all my energy\ninto one hour\nthat's more powerful than me having 10\nhours right of half the energy\nand in but in addition there are\ntechniques right right um\nwell um like for example\ni learned um leverage through other\npeople\num once you learn leverage in my\nparticular case of course i built up to\nthis\nuh um i have about 30 direct reports\nand what it means is it now this is\nafter years of doing i i had nothing by\nthe way um\nbut what i can do is and with the good\nrelationships and how that works\nbasically they can typically work for\nabout 50 hours on\nsomething that i'm trying to accomplish\nfor every hour that i deal with them\nright so i get an enormous amount of\nleverage\nor i know how to prioritize or i know\nhow to\nbreak my schedule knowing uh i mentioned\nmeditation\nor other things to get myself the\nclarity yeah so\nthere are very many many techniques i\nwrote a bunch of them in the books and\nmany other people have other techniques\ntoo yeah but as you start to realize\nthat you can have much more life by\nknowing\nthese various types of techniques i'd\nlove to know some of your talk uh tips\nand techniques around\nprioritization i think that's something\nthat people are so challenged with right\nnow\nwhat have been some of your best\nprinciples or rules around how to\nprioritize something\num i don't want um i don't want to give\npeople my priorities but i do want to\ngive them\nthe notion of to go\nabove it okay like the same rule if\nyou're in a disagreement you go above it\nokay so many people are in the blizzard\nof all these things coming at them and\nthey're in it and they're trying to deal\nwith every one of those\nokay so pause and step back\nand then start to think what are you\nreally going after you have to look\nsubliminally\nit may be deep-seated in your childhood\nit may be but what is that pull okay\nand that that becomes and then how do\nyou apportion it\nyou do need a plan you you need some\nsort of\nself-discipline as you look down and you\nsay well i'm going to spend dinners with\nmy kids\nor i'm going to do xyz\nin terms of those to do's but at the\nhighest level\nyou're saying what do i want what are my\nchoices\nbecause you have to realize and then\nwhat i find is\num if you pause and you do that slowly\nover time\ndon't just try to do it in a minute you\ncan find that you can have\na lot of your cake and eat it too right\ni used to take my kids on my business\ntrips\num what a great education some crazy\nit's an example that sometimes you\ndiscover\nwith time that you can have your cake\nand eat it too\nright yeah so take the time\nyeah patience patience is i think that\nthere there's five steps to success\nfirst is you have to know your goals you\nhave to know what you're going out there\nand that does require prioritization\nthe second is on your way to your goals\nyou're going to encounter your problems\nyour failures your problems\nso that's step two encounter them\nthey're standing in your way\nnumber three is you have to diagnose\nthose to the root cause what is\nproducing your problems\nat the root cause and that may be that\nyou or it may be those around you who\nare not\ngood at things or whatever or you're\ndoing something you need to do better\nor it may be that you're in the wrong\nplace but you have to get at the root\ncause\nup to do that diagnosis once you know\nthe specific thing that's standing in\nyour way\nthat personal discovery process you have\nto go to the fourth step\nand that fourth step is to design a way\nto get around them\nyeah if it may be for example that if\nyou have a particular weakness\nwork with somebody who's strong where\nyou're weak or it may be\na change your job or whatever it is but\nyou've got to get around\nthat specific thing that you've\ndiagnosed as standing in your way\nand then when you have a design you have\nto do it\na lot of people come up with designs but\nthey don't push through and do it\nand i think life is just the constant\nfive-step process\nover and over and over again yeah\nbecause if you're if you can do those\nfive things\nyou will be successful you'll evolve\nfairly quickly\nyeah absolutely absolutely and you add\ntwo methods\nor keys to succeeding which you call\nflexibility and self-accountability\nbecause within that\nwithin those five steps there's going to\nneed to be a bit of flexibility or a lot\nof flexibility\nand self-accountability and i love you\nyou point this out you said don't blame\nbad outcomes on anyone but yourself\nwhich is like huge self-accountability\nyeah i really do believe\ngive you a mindset i do believe that i\ncan do anything\nand that it is just a matter of my\ncharacter and my creativity\nso that it is a personal test of me it\nmay be difficult\nand i have to be creative enough and\nmaybe with the help of others\nand that is largely true\nyou really if you're creative enough\nwith and you don't have to do it\nyourself\nyou can get the ideas from other people\nand then you\nare enough character in it to do it wow\nabsolutely and i think and i think\nthat's the biggest challenge that we try\nand do all on our own\nwe think we have to be everything we\nthink we have to be the face and the\nbackground and the side and\nand everything in between and actually\ncollaboration coming together with other\npeople is so much more\nwhat has brought success in the world\nyes\nwhen you start to realize that actually\nyou\ncan't see it's like\ngoing from two dimensions to three\ndimensions or black and white to color\nthat when you start to see things\nthrough others eyes\nyou can see the world in a totally\ndifferent much\nricher way and you know how to navigate\nit\nit's a it's such a power such a gift\nyeah\nit's amazing thank you so much ray ray\nthis has been\nsuch an incredible experience diving in\nwith you anyone who's listening and\nwatching i hope you've been taking notes\ni hope you\nstopped and did certain activities when\nray and i spoke about them\nand ray we finished every interview with\nthe
