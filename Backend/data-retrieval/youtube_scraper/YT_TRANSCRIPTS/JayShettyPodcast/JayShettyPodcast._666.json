what is it called\nthe upfronts up front in new york\nyes and you're launching season two of\nfearless and i was already a fan of j\nshetty that i was already following you\nwas already the thing\nand you weren't following me yet that's\nokay\ni'm just kidding um but it was so nice\nand then and then we had a nice\nreally great lunch and here we are we\ndid and\ni actually didn't know this but i told\nher that day when we met i was like\nactually i've been stalking you for a\nlong time actually because i i saw you\nspeak at the forbes study under 30\nevents\nyeah exactly so i'd seen you from then\nand then we bumped into each other at\nupw\nin la yep and then and then we met here\nand actually this was this is what\nreally impressed me about ashley she\nwas attending the met for like the 25th\ntime or whatever it is third\nthird first but yeah so she was\nattending the 25th third and everyone\nthat week was telling me how busy they\nwere with the met and getting ready\nthen actually like do you want to do\nlunch one day before the mat like before\na fitting and i was just like\nhere's such an awesome human who has\ntime to have lunch and i\ndon't know okay i i really think that\npeople just want to be like\nthey want to get their relaxation in\nbefore they met because it's such\na crazy day and evening but i always\nhave time for lunch\nyeah always well thank you and you you\nlooked amazing at the mat thank you\nit was so much fun dapper dan really did\na great job yeah oh yeah incredible it\nwas amazing\ni loved it today i'm excited to dive\ninto your journey your story\ni can't wait for my audience to learn\nmore about you and fall more in love\nwith you as well\nso really really excited to do that and\ni want to start where it all began for\nyou\nand being spotted at a mall i know it's\nso weird i think you know\nso that's really where i was discovered\nas a model but if you take it back and\nyou go back to like how i was raised\ni'm from i'm from texas atlanta arkansas\nnew hampshire and nebraska\nmy dad was a business consultant so we\nmoved around a lot and every time he got\na better job is when we were moving\nand um from there i mean my mom\nshe was raised as a farmer in a farmer\nfamily and my dad was\nlow class working class\nkind of family so when they raised me\nand my sisters it was really about like\nbeing humble working hard and when you\nstart something you finish it\nso when i was in the mall and this scout\ncame up to me and said hey do you want\nto be a model it was another opportunity\nthat my mom and dad saw as something\nlike oh maybe she'll like\nthis thing because i didn't love\nbasketball i didn't love soccer\nvolleyball because my mom and dad also\nplayed a lot of sports they just kept\nputting me into sports\ni also was not artistic at all like\nthese are just\nyou know it's like i wasn't good at\nanything and then modeling came about\nand they're like let's try it\nand next thing you know it just kind of\nall stuck with me\nand um i went through what someone might\ncall like a modeling school but it was\nkind of like this expo where they put\nyou\num in front of many different agencies\nand you kind of have to prance around\nand like\ni don't know show your stuff and an\nagency liked me and signed me\nand um it was just like all very surreal\ni had no idea what modeling was i didn't\nknow what vogue was i\ndidn't know what pretty meant i knew\nlike what being\nthe the most the like having being the\nmost popular in high school or\nmiddle school was but i did not know\nwhat beautiful was\nuntil i got into this industry that\ndictated what beauty was\nand then that's when it was like a whole\nnew world for me\nand i moved to new york at 17 i had\nmodeled all through high school and i\ntraveled\ni traveled the world and even when i got\nhome from paris a lot of time my mom\nwould still be like you have to mow the\nlawn ashley\nthis is how i was raised i was like very\nhumble she was like i don't care how\nmuch money you just made\nit doesn't matter you still have to\nbabysit your sister so i was like okay\ngreat well thanks mom\neverybody in paris loved me\num but it was it was interesting because\nit was like two different parallels of\nwhat beauty is\nat home my mom raised me to believe in\nmyself and that my exterior had nothing\nto do with my worth\nand i'm she raised my sisters the exact\nsame way she never looked at herself and\ndegraded herself in front of the mirror\nnever said she needed to go on a diet\nshe was\nvery strong and adamant about those\nthings and that kindness was this\nwas the most beautiful thing that you\ncould wear and then i'm in this world\nthat is only based off of your exterior\nthat\nis about your worth with your hip your\nsize hip measurement with\nhow beautiful your hair is what your eye\nshape is you know you don't you're not\nsupposed to have a voice as a model\nthere's so many\nit was just very strange to me so i knew\nwho i\nwas from my mother and my my father\ngrowing up but then i had to conform to\nan industry\nthat i wanted to fit into and um\nthe reason i think i wanted to fit into\nit because it was a whole new world\nit was like tasting a new piece of candy\nit was\npeople offered you know obscene amounts\nof money they offered you to\nto feel like you were in they offered\nyou the opportunity to\num to be cool and those are things that\ni had never\nfelt afforded and now it's like oh do i\nwant those things what do i have to do\nto get in\nand you you start to see yourself\nkind of make changes in your own belief\nsystem\nto fit into an idea or an ideal\nthat was set that doesn't need to be and\nthat's exactly what happened it was it\nwas just kind of this like messy\nspiral downfall where i had to catch\nmyself really quick before i fell into\nit\nthat's so powerful though that you had\nthis incredible upbringing\nlike i thought i did yeah like your\nrelationship with your mother and\njust how she spoke to you about beauty\nand your family and\ni think that that's so unique and rare\ntoday as well\nbecause i know a lot of people would\nactually say actually because of the way\ni was raised that's where a lot of my\ninsecurities come from i know because as\nopposed to their strengths i talk to a\nlot of moms and i always tell them like\nhow are you speaking about yourself in\nfront of your kids\nbecause that's how your your kid is\ngoing to actually think of themselves\nbecause they know they're a product of\nyou\nyes whether they're adopted or whether\nthey are actually physically yours\nthere is no way that they are going to\nlook at themselves any differently\nand i've seen it in all spectrums with\nmothers that have said\nhave never said anything bad to their\nparent or to their kid but have\ntalked very badly about themselves and\nyou see the product of the child and\num you know and i've met people who've\ntheir parents have talked really poorly\nto them and they're some of the most\nconfident people so\nyou know yeah it can go either way it\nreally can it can go either way but how\ndid you\ntell me this because i think you're\nsomeone who at such a young age\nwent through so many huge\ntransformations yeah so many huge\ntransitions\nyes right it can't be easy being spotted\ntraveling all over the world making all\nthis money being signed all of this at\nsuch a young age being\nbrought into this huge industry which\nalready has expectations\nhow did you start watching yourself\ncatch yourself like how were you\nable to notice when things were going\ntoo far because i think a lot of people\nmiss that when they start working for a\nnew company and they start fitting in\nor they join a particular business\nschool or university and they start\nfitting in or whatever it may be\nfor you you did in the most extreme\nsense so i'd love to know of course\nso just being thrown into an industry\nthat like you said it's the money\nit's the travel it's the experience and\nthen it's also about\nstaying in that kind of like it\nmode and the thing about being a curvy\nmodel\nis that at that time you only were in\nbasically one category and that was\ncatalog so i didn't have to be like an\nit girl on the runway that had to like\nkeep my hair and like a buzz cut and\nlike\nplatinum and then like have it long for\nnext season just to like feel different\nlike\ni just had to make sure that i was doing\nall the things that\nthat the industry expected of me and\nwhether that was talking how they talk\nor um or or losing the weight that they\nwanted me to lose or\ndressing the way or whatever it was but\nthe thing is\nbecause i was raised in a very christian\nupbringing\nand because i was raised with such um\nunderstanding of\nuh of my worth and\nexcept for i wish my mom and dad would\nhave talked to me about sex a lot more\ni really do because because i knew who i\nwas\num thank god i could stand up for myself\nbut because i didn't understand\nsex and what it was to have worthiness\nover myself\nthat's where my downfall was because i\ndidn't have a great relationship with my\nfather\nand in trying to fit in to this fashion\nworld and not knowing who i was and\npeople telling me oh you're not good\nenough oh you need to lose weight oh\nyour hair is\noh or your eyes or whatever it was your\nhip measurement\nit was like oh then i needed to go find\nmy worth and then i would go find my\nworth in food i would find my worth in\nmen\ni would find my worth in gossip and\nthat's when i really realized at 18\nyears old\nthat i was on the spiraling downfall of\nhating who\ni was i was working i was making great\nmoney\nbut when you're working and making great\nmoney but you feel really crappy about\nyourself\nthere's nothing that will bring you joy\nat all\nso i called my mom and i was like mom\ni'm not doing this anymore i'm not i\ndon't want to be a model i want to leave\nnew york city this is just something\nthat\nhas gotten to me and she told me and i\nswear to god my mother is so prophetic\nshe said ashley your body is going to\nchange someone's life and you have to\nfinish what you started\nand i was like i have no idea what\nyou're saying lady\nbut i'm going to listen because we're\nsupposed to listen to our mommies and\ndaddies\nand she said i'm going to come up to new\nyork and i'm going to spend some time\nwith you because i was really just\ngoing through a hard time and she told\nme she's like okay\nyou have to start going back to church i\nwas like what i don't want to go to\nchurch mom but\nyou know you when you're raised in that\natmosphere\nand then your mom is like okay this was\nher rule like\nyou only i only had to go to five\nchurches and one time\nand just to feel it out and the first\nchurch i walked into i saw\nthree people that i had known from my\nchurch in texas\nthat i had um gone to and it was like\nthis it was like a sign it was like\nwow i see family in this church\nso i started going to this church and i\nfinally finally found like\na um a community and it was like outside\nof the modeling industry\nit's it's like i had my whole life\nwrapped up into these people\nwho didn't know me who didn't want me\nbecause i wasn't fitting into an ideal\nso then i started making friends outside\nof it all and it's like i went back to\nmy roots\ni went back to who who am i and\nthank god i did because it took me out\nof that\nnasty feeling of not feeling\nfeeling worthy i stopped having sex i\nwas completely celibate after that\ni um i i i just i started actually doing\naffirmations\nand it was something that my mom talked\nto me about when i\ni had no idea what they were but she\nsaid because\nbecause we are christian and we really\nreally we we really believe that words\nhave power\nand i know that this is like many people\nthat believe this but it's like\none of the biggest lessons in the bible\nand so she broke it down for me and she\nwas like if you keep calling yourself\nugly and fat and\nand not worthy and all these things then\nthat's exactly what you're going to be\nso she said change your words and that's\nwhat i had to do and it really helped me\nas well\nand it was something the words that i\nmade for myself were i am bold\ni am brilliant i am beautiful i am\nworthy of all\ni love you and i love you was the\nhardest one of them all\nand it wasn't like i just said these\nthings and overnighted like bada bing\nbada boom like oh i'm a misconfidence\nit was really it was inner work it was\nouter work it was dedication to knowing\nthat\ni could change the trajectory of my\nfuture by having these words\nbe my truth and having these words be my\ntruth has now\nenabled me to tell my full story\nand have other people's stories come out\nand talk to them about what affirmations\nare\nand and and how your words are really\nkilling you\num so thank god for mom yes she really\npulls me out amazing\nit was really great that's beautiful\nwhat an incredible relationship to have\nthat's\nawesome and i thank you for sharing so\nopenly as well because i think so many\nof us\nstart to validate ourselves through\na partner right through men or women yes\nthrough\nfood yes we start to validate ourselves\nthrough all these different ways\nand we don't even know we're doing it\nand so here you say i'm sure a lot of\npeople a lot of people listening and\nwatching right now are going to be like\ngod i've done that too yeah and i was\nsharing just literally you've you've had\nit for me two weeks ago when i was\nuh doing red table talk with jada i\ntalked about that how i would find my\nvalidation in\nhow i treated women so it wasn't even\nwhat i got from them it was just like if\ni could show off how amazing i was\nduring my teens then that would make me\nfeel more validated if they were\nimpressed by me\ni know and and i think we get lost in\nthis web\nand we're just weaving this web and\nyou're just getting more and more lost\nand trapped and you don't even know\nand you feel so empty and you feel so\nempty even if you're externally\nsuccessful and ticking all the boxes\ndoesn't matter\nit doesn't matter and and the fact that\nyou broke through it because i do feel\nthat\nand i said this to you when we met\nyou've literally\nshifted an industry like you you have\nchanged the industry\nfrom the way i view it and from the way\ni experience it and from the way so many\nother people experience it now and thank\nyou\nand i mean that and the fact that you've\nbeen able to go from a place where\nactually all of these things were forced\nupon you\nto you now having a really powerful\nvoice right being able to share all\nthese messages around it i think\nthat that's the transformation i'd love\nfor you to walk us through yeah\nbecause i think that's the story of\neveryone like your story is the story of\neveryone maybe not as extreme\nright but everyone who feels like yeah\nyou're not good enough you're not going\nto be able to do that that's not\npossible\nor it doesn't work like that right and\nthen being able to break that and i love\nthe affirmation point you made so\nlet's start with that journey of\ntransformation i want to hear about how\nyou did the work because i know you have\noh my god and it's like how do you get\nto the point of looking in the mirror\nand saying i love you and meaning it\nyeah\nbecause i agree i love affirmations too\nbut you have to feel\nyou have to know you have to know it in\nyourself right and it's one of those\nit's it's it's really it's a lot of\ninner work and\nfor me understanding that quiet time in\nthe morning and meditation and prayer is\nlike so\nit is it is the thing that will get me\nthrough the day i will wake up i will\nfeel\nterrible i'll feel my mind will be foggy\nor whatever but that quiet\ntime in the morning whatever you choose\nto do with it that is your time\nand and it is so precious to me so that\nhas some\nbeen something that has been a staple\nfor me\num and uh the affirmations i mean i say\nthem\nin the car before i walked up here i was\nlike i am bold and brilliant and\nbeautiful\ni am worthy and jay and i are gonna have\na great conversation you know it's like\none of those\nit's just in me now so i don't have to\nrecite it constantly but\neverybody's affirmations are different\njust to wrap up the affirmations but\neverybody's are different\nonce you make yours and you say it write\nit on your mirror write it on a paper\nlike actually physically write it type\nit out if you love to type\nlike whatever those things are for you\nso that you can embody it and they can\nchange over time too which i think is\nvery important\num so as you were saying like\nthat i have your words that i've changed\nin industry\nit's hard to go back and be like when\ndid it all begin yeah i can imagine\nbecause for me i was just this like girl\nfrom nebraska\nworking my butt off just trying to like\nyou know sustain\na 4 000 rental\nin financial districts i'm like this is\nwhat people pay like this is insane i'm\nliving\nin 800 square feet this is not okay this\nis why i moved to brooklyn\n[Laughter]\nright um but it was it was just\nit was always such a heavy workload and\ni didn't i was just\ni always felt like i was swimming\nupstream and\neven as my worth developed and even as\nmy my my understanding of who i was and\nthat my worth wasn't wrapped up in men\nmy worth wasn't wrapped up in\nin food it wasn't wrapped up in in my\ncareer\ni still struggled and wanted something\nmore in my career\nand i wanted to be able to make change\nin a different way\nand i think that where a lot of it began\nwhere a lot of it began was i was in a\ncommercial\nthat was banned from television because\nof my size because i was a lot\nin lingerie and a girl that was size 16.\ni was 16 at the time\ni'm a size 14 for all of you wondering\neveryone was like oh my god but people\nare always so just you know we're still\naddicted to numbers right\ngosh anyways that's another conversation\nanyways so i was a size 16 girl in\nlingerie in this commercial and i was\nlike going to meet my boyfriend it was\nbanned from tv\nand that's really where kind of my\ncareer\ntook it took like this trajectory of\nlike oh\nthere's this girl and like maybe we want\nto get to know her\nand that is when i realized okay i have\na voice how do i use it oh\nsocial media okay so i'm gonna use\nsocial media to just tell my truth i\ndon't know what's gonna happen\nbut it wasn't just me that wanted this\nchange it was\nso many people in the industry that were\nlike we aren't just plus size we're\nwomen like\nwe want to we want to have clothes that\nfit us this isn't just about\num skinny women being able to be dressed\nin cool clothes it's about\nevery woman being able to dress and be\ncool clothes so\ni really use social social media as a\nstepping stone\nin order to just have a voice but i\ndidn't know that that was going to be my\nbiggest stepping stone\nso i i remember just like posting photos\nof myself in\nin swimsuits or lingerie and not\nretouching the cellulite\nout shocking and getting all kinds of\nwomen just saying like\nhow brave of you or how courageous that\nyou would actually do something like\nthat i would never\nor like thank you for giving me the\nconfidence to be able to do that\nand um and and i thought okay well this\nis good\nthis is like this is a thing\nyeah yeah people care exactly and then i\nrealized that there was a mark there was\na hole in the market\nfor lingerie and that people were\nlooking at me as a lingerie girl they\ndidn't know my name\nbut they knew that i was a lingerie girl\nbecause of this commercial that was\nbanned so i was like well great i'm\ngonna make lingerie for all of you then\nand because i could take a step back and\nlook at\nwhere there was holes and where i could\nfeel it at the time because at the time\ni was 22 years\n22 yeah 23 23 years old because i\nstarted also lingerie line because i had\nbeen in the same position on the couch\nwhen my husband left for the house in\nthe morning and he came back that same\nnight and i was like\nliterally just still watching real\nhousewives and he's like is this what\nyou want with your life\nand i and i was like what do you mean he\nsaid do you really just want to be\nstuck in this kind of career in this job\nand doing this same thing and i thought\ni don't i don't want that what can i do\nand that's when i\nwent and took a step back and made a\nvision board about\nwho who i want to be what do i want and\nthat's when the idea of the lingerie\nline came\naround and um it's funny because\npeople who have changed industries and\npeople who have made\nsuch impacts in the world i don't know\nthat they've actually set out to do it\ni think it just happens and\ni've just taken every little every\nlittle gap that\nthat has that has that i've seen in my\nindustry and i've tried to fill it\nbecause if i'm feeling it with my voice\nthen that then i know\nthat i'm filling it with a voice that is\nlike so many other people who just want\nto be included who want to have\ninclusivity who don't want to\nbe called different because we are the\nnorm and it's it's\njust a conversation that i've had to\nkeep having but it's\nincredible the strides that have\nhappened along with it absolutely for\neveryone who's listening and watching\nright now\nashley is gracefully sharing her story\nand she didn't even point this out but\nit's like\nyou literally took your commercial\ngetting banned from being on tv\nand turned that into something\nincredible which i love thank you\nbecause\nit's so easy for any of us to hit any\nroadblock hit any barrier\nhit a rejection hit a no for most of us\nlike if our book doesn't get picked up\nor if your tv commercial gets banned or\nif your movie never made it out of\nscript or whatever it is or it didn't\nmake it out of a pilot phase\na lot of us would be like oh my god my\nlife's falling apart like i'm not gonna\nmake it or\ni didn't get into the college i wanted\nor i didn't get the promotion i wanted\nbut you went and took that same thing\nand that actually led to the birth of\nyour\nlingerie yes which is just phenomenal\nlike i love that\nit's just an example of how any\nsituation can be the biggest blessing in\nthe world\nyeah i really i think of no's as maybes\nand i and i turn my babies into yeses\nand i'm\ni know that not just one person is going\nto give me an answer so there wasn't a\ndoor that i didn't knock on\nand i thank my parents all the time for\ninstilling that hard\nworking ethic in me because it doesn't\nmatter\nwhat you're doing in your career you\nunderstand this i understand this\nyou have to work your butt off and and\nyou have to work your butt off even\nharder when you get to the top because\nthen you want to stay there\nso you think you're working hard now\nyeah\nit's true so um i i\ni don't know i was just i i just think\nthat that was a very pivotal moment and\nthen\nit all just kind of started spiraling\ninto these great opportunities\num and also just being able i did a ted\ntalk which was like\nalso very scary for me very scary\nbut it enabled me to have a voice and so\nmany models were silenced\nwe were just told that you know you're a\npretty face be quiet\nand um crazy it is crazy\ni know because i mean we're people like\nwe have\nmany opinions we have many things that\nwe're passionate about we want to change\nthe world\nand uh i actually in my book i i wrote a\nchapter about win models talk\nand uh it's it's really it's interesting\nbecause i had started this group called\nalda and it was me and four other curvy\ngirls who had been switching\nagencies and we did it together because\nwe knew if we went\nto a really big agency that did not have\nany curve models we could really change\nthe industry\nand we made these business proposals and\nwe talked about how much money we each\nmade and how much money that the whole\ncurve industry is making\nand where what the trajectory of the\nindustry is and\nwe took it as like this business\nopportunity to really\nto to tell the to tell the industry who\nwe were not just as the five of us but\nlike who we are as curvy women\nyeah and they took they listened and and\nsure enough six years later here we are\nand oh my god i didn't know that part i\nlove them you're glad you're sharing you\ncan't do it alone there's nothing you\ncan do\nthat you that that is only going to be\nyou there's teams that are behind\npeople there is mountains that are\nthat you have to climb over to get to\nthese places and you need\npeople along the way to help you and i\nalways thank those girls when we stay\nreally close\num but yeah yeah no i love that you\nbrought up that point i was sharing the\nother day that i feel like\nso many of us when you're starting in a\nspace you look at everyone else as your\ncompetitor\nright and you're like okay who's who's\nwinning in this space what's my\ncompetitor\nanalysis yes oh she's number one i'm\nnumber 10 or whatever it is yes so\nactually what you've just shown us this\nbeautiful example of\ncollaboration right collaborators and\nseeing everyone and i remember when i\nfirst started making content\nfor me it was the same i was looking at\nevery content creator as someone i could\npotentially collaborate with\nand i would literally write to everyone\nand just be like hey i really believe\nthat we need to share these messages\nwhy can't we support and share with each\nother and a few years later i've seen\nthe growth of all these\nincredible other platforms and we all\nwork together in the same way so i love\nhearing that because i think\nso often we feel alone and we choose a\nlonely path\nwhen we don't need to know it's so true\nand especially in the fashion industry\neverything is a competition\nand it's about the instagram followers\nwho's got covers you know who's in the\ncampaigns who's on the who's on the\nrunways\nand it was uh really groundbreaking for\npeople to see us all band together\nand even the agencies were shook by it\nthey were like you told each other how\nmuch you made\nhow dare you exactly but we had to\nbecause we wanted to make sure that we\nwere making the right decision yeah\noh god no no no but i was going to bring\nup another\num great story in that even though i did\nthat\ni still had to learn another lesson a\ncouple years later\num where actually it was it was a year\nprior my bad\ni'm getting my my timeline all mixed up\nbut there was a cover that i was up for\nand it was italian vogue\nand italian vogue and fashion industry\nis like being on the cover of forbes\nright in in in art and this side of this\nyes okay\nand it is like oh the creme de la creme\nand i was on hold to be on this job\nand the night before i get the call and\nthey're like you didn't get confirmed\nbut three other brunettes did and i\nwas shook and i thought okay there's day\ntwo and they told me that maybe i'll get\ninto day two\nthe next night they called me they were\nlike actually sorry you didn't get it\nand\ni i honestly went ate a bowl of pasta\nbecause like that was like my method of\njust like coping and healing\nand um i said to my agent i said is this\ngoing to ruin my career\nthese three brunettes like they're gonna\ntake over and they're they're gonna take\nevery job that i've ever worked so hard\nto get\nand he said don't worry about it like\nyou're my money maker you're my star\nnothing will happen to you sure enough\nwhen this cover came out it was like\nboom i stopped working and these other\ngirls just started\ngetting more and more jobs and more fame\nlike whatever\nthat was for them and i\nwas so pissed i was pissed i was angry i\nwas\njealous i there were so many emotions\nthat were going on in my mind\nand there was nothing that i wouldn't\nthat i felt like i couldn't have done to\nget on that cover\nbut except for just be pissed at that\npoint\nand i had this probably three-day\nconversation with myself\nabout what did it what would it have\nmeant to me to be on that cover\nand i talked to myself through what the\nsuccess of my feelings would have been\nall of the the um the highs what jobs i\nwould have gotten\nall of that stuff and i said but it\ndidn't happen\nit wasn't yours and the moment that i\ncould say that to myself\nand realize that that wasn't mine\nand i forgave myself for getting so\nangry it was like poof it was out of my\nmind\nand i could just share it with other\npeople and it was more of like a funny\nthing and a life lesson\nin some senses and and then i and now i\ncan even talk about it today because\nit was it was something that that had me\nso shooken up but now\ni didn't need that cover i didn't need\nthat cover to get to the next stage\nbecause\ngod works in mysterious ways where he\ngives you exactly what you can have and\nor what you can handle\nin that moment and i didn't need it and\nhe wanted to teach me a lesson\non on just being comfortable in my own\nspace and not\nhaving it all yes and i was really\ni mean it took me a while to be okay\nwith that but\nbut now i look back and i think wow i'm\nso glad that i was able to handle the\nsituation that i did\nyeah thank you for sharing both human\naspects\nyeah like like i'm glad i'm glad that\nyou told us about that side too\nyeah and and thank you for sharing both\nstories like the first story showing\ncollaboration community coming together\nbut then actually showing on the flip\nside\nof course we all want to win we all want\nto do well exactly and we will go\nthrough moments of feeling extremely\nangry\nextremely upset and i love that you said\nyou had a three-day conversation with\nyourself yeah\nwhich i think is awesome by the way like\ni think everyone should set more\nmeetings with themselves on their\ncalendar right like our calendars are\nfull of meetings with other people\nimagine you actually had a meeting that\nsaid me right like\noh i should do that yeah we need we need\neveryone to have a calendar on there\nyou know calendar moment that says me a\nmeeting with myself it's the most\nimportant meeting of the day yeah\nand i just think that it's so awesome\nthat you shared both sides with us\nbecause i i do think it's\nbalanced absolutely and it's human to\nwant to win and to succeed and to be\nambitious\nhow were you able from that point on\nthen\nto proof it's all disappeared you're not\nfeeling that envy and that pain anymore\nbut to pave a new path for yourself and\nthen notice as you said in your words\ngod's plan of\npaving a new path and a new lesson for\nyourself how are you then able to open\nup to that opportunity\nwell i think then i just had tunnel\nvision and that i didn't have\ncompetition it was just everything was\nabout what am i doing\nand what do i want to see and it's been\nreally great to be able to work with\npeople\nmy team is incredible and be able to\ncome to them and say okay this is what i\nsee\nthat that needs to happen in my career\nbut this is also what i see that needs\nto happen in the fashion industry\nand how can we fill the void and how can\nwe fix things and change things and it's\nbeen really great to be able to work\nwith designers like\nprobably ron and christian siriano and\nmichael kors and\nand and just be able to to have natural\nconversations about like what's really\nhappening in the industry\nbut then also to have the confidence in\nmyself to be able to do those things and\ni think now is the time people want that\nchange and\nthe body positive the body inclusivity\num\nconversation has just poof blown\nup yes and um and and now\nnow more than ever we're seeing women\nand men\nhonestly which has been really cool of\nall shapes sizes ages colors\num i mean name the gamut it's like the\ninclusivity is like\nreally where it's at um but\nstaying true to who you are is\neasy when you know who you are and\ni think that i'm 31 and through my 20s i\nhad to really get to know myself\nand i had a lot of like what felt like\nmaybe a carpal tunnel because i was just\nwriting\na lot about journaling about who i\nwanted to be\nwho what my goals were and and all these\ndifferent things and\nand and when i look back at those\njournals i laugh\nbecause i feel like i was so immature\nlike i really like wanted such\nlittle things\n[Laughter]\nlike i really like i look and i think\nwow\ni was so close-minded but i'm so glad\nthat i have that proof\nto myself how much i've grown\nand and it's it's it's nice to look at\nthe fashion industry and say like wow\nthings are really moving\nand then be able to look back at the\njournals and be like wow\ni i mean it's just incredible to see\nlike the maturity of like everything\nall at once um so\nyeah i think that just really knowing\nwho you are and getting to know yourself\nis really key\nin whatever industry that you're in and\nwhatever mountain you're trying to move\nyeah absolutely so well said so well\nsaid and\ni think one of the things that you're\nreally raising that's important to me\nhere is this principle of\nwe think we have the grandest and\nbiggest plans for ourselves\nand then the universe god yeah whatever\nwhatever you want to call it comes and\ngives you\nsomething way bigger way bigger and you\njust had to stay on that path and every\ndelay really has a blessing\nyeah but you've just got to be able to\nwait and be patient and consistently\nkeep pushing and working\nand i think so many people just get off\nthe path before you're actually revealed\nthat hey wait a minute like your\nyour ideas were good but they were much\nsmaller and there's better things in\nstore you have to believe it yeah you\nhave to believe it no i love that and\nyou're so right if you don't know who\nyou are\nyou can't keep hold of that and you've\nhad your fair share of\nthe negative comments too like when you\nwhen you posted your\nyou know when you started to post more\ntransparent authentic images of yourself\nand i love how you have this thing\ncalled teachable moments yes\nand i want you to tell our audience\nabout it because i think so many of us\nlike\nyou don't have to be a supermodel or an\ninfluencer or a creator\nto be worried about trolls and negative\ncomments everyone gets them\nyeah whether you get one or you get 1\n000 or you get 100. yeah and we all get\nthem so tell us about these teachable\nmoments\nso for me i think the natural like human\nreaction would be like\njust to have anger back and and you know\nwhat good would that do you know it's\nnot gonna do anything for for me or for\nthe person\nreceiving it so i always like to think\nof it as\nlike you like you said like you quoted\nme already a teachable moment because\nnot everybody understands where you're\ncoming from not everybody understands\nwhy you're posting a photo that you are\nor whatever so if somebody wants to\nwrite something very ignorant like stop\nmaking fat look cool you're gonna kill\nsomebody\nthen i can write a message back saying\nthat well first of all fat is necessary\nfor a body\nlike in order to live and thirdly i'm\nnot making\num fat fat also can be cool and if you\nwant to call me fat great i'm not\noffended by that word\nyou know and and just having this like\nconversation and like break down\nwhat that person actually said because a\nlot of times that person behind\nthe the keyboard is already so broken we\nknow this yes\nbut i also like to have these teachable\nmoments\num like that for the younger generation\nthat's watching because i want them to\nknow\nyou can stand up for yourself and you\ncan do it in a polite way\nyou don't have to say you know something\nnegative and ugly back\nyou can say oh thank you so much for\nyou know identifying the fact that my\ncellulite is out today thank you so much\nand it's just like who cares but that's\nalso\nyou know in this generation of instagram\ni'm so glad i wasn't raised in in and so\nyoung\nin that world because there's so much\nwrapped up in a double tap there's so\nmuch wrapped up in a comment there's so\nmuch wrapped up in\nin the followers and i i always\ni don't care how many likes i get like\nthat to me doesn't ever bother me i just\nalways want to make sure that i'm\nreplying to some of my dms and my\ncomments to make people know that\nlike hey i see you yes like that's all\nthat matters\nand um and if they see that i have uh\nquote clapped back in a teachable way\nthen so be it because i think that\nthat's how we should be clapping back\nyeah absolutely and and i and i think\nyou do that in an awesome way tell me\nhow\nwait what are what are negative comments\nthat you get negative comments yeah\nbecause you're not showing your\ncellulite\nokay no no uh i'll tell you one of the\nfirst ones i got which i'll never forget\nbecause it was genius i thought it was\nhilarious\nso it said like i bet he has a\nwind-blowing machine for his hair to fly\nlike that\noh my god so like someone literally\naccused me of like by and i was like wow\nthat's such a good idea but\ni was just outside that was when i first\nthat was like one of the first videos i\nmade\ni didn't have a team it was one guy with\nhis camera and me it was a super windy\nday in london\nand i'm sitting on the on this rooftop\nand then literally my hair\nsound was really good right the sound\nwas really good yeah\nand it's just like yeah so so that was\none of them that i got\ni think so that's something common i get\nsomething based on again it's always\nphysical\na lot of it's physical exactly and and\ni'm like okay i can laugh at that that's\nthat's funny that's cool and then often\ni'll get things like\noh well it's easy to say and then again\nthat's a teachable moment too and i'm\nlike yes i know it's easy to say i get\nit that you're really going through it\nbut this is at least opening the\nconversation like how much can i share\nwith you in a three to four minute video\nexactly i'm trying my best here and\nthat's why this podcast conversations\nlike this\nare beautiful opportunities where we're\nreally diving into so many of these\nthemes\nin depth yes with someone like yourself\nwho's going through in an extreme way\nand so for me the three to four minute\nvideos have been windows for people to\ncome into a bigger deeper conversation\nand so i'm open about the fact that i\ncan't answer everyone's problems in four\nminutes and i'm not trying to either\ni'm just trying to start a conversation\nand that's what my videos were about\nit's\nhow do we start a conversation about\nthese themes i believed\nwhen i started making content i believe\nthat people are having these\nconversations offline\nyeah in their personal circles or on\ntheir own but no one was having them\nonline right\nand so i was like how can we urge and\nencourage more people to feel\ncomfortable and confident\nto have them yeah so yeah i get those\nhey haters\nhey haters yeah hey it's teachable\nmoments i love it\nbut but one of the things i really want\nto ask you this and this is something i\nask\na lot of people whose industry or career\nis based on an external accolade\nor award in in your case for example\ngetting a magazine cover like you said\nitalian vogue\ngetting a magazine cover is a big deal\nright\nfor a model it's huge i mean that's kind\nof proving like\nprogress in one sense how have you\nstayed\nin love with the process and motivated\nevery day\nrather than waiting for that release of\na cover\nto validate how you feel about your\ncareer and yourself\nbecause because i think everyone today\nhas this you know balance between like\nprocess and result process and result\nand i'm just i'm asking that to a lot of\npeople at the moment i just think yours\nwould be\nan incredible answer to have because\nyour career is based around an external\nvalidation in\none sense so the question is\nabout like how do i how do i oh wait\nwhere are we going to say yeah no no i\ncan explain it if but you can repeat no\nbut it it's about like the process of\ngetting to that cover\nand then getting it or not when i meet\nyou and of course\ni'm meeting you at a time when you have\nmade shifts you are very successful etc\nbut still\ni i see you as someone who's happy i see\nyou as someone who's content i see you\nas someone who's excited\nand bubbly and you know i see all these\ngood qualities in you\nand i'm guessing that you don't live for\nthe cover i'm guessing that you love\nlife every day\ni'm guessing i'm assuming that right and\nif that's true then it's like how have\nyou\nfallen in love with the process of\ngetting to the cover and not living for\nthe cover and\ni see does that make sense 100 100\nso if you wrap your for me i haven't i\ncan't wrap myself\nup with of my worth and my work because\nif you wrap yourself up in your worth of\nanything\nyou're going you're going to completely\nfail at it\nand that's like wrapping yourself up in\na relationship\nor um i mean literally anything\nso i have been i have made this\nconscious decision\nto be 100 comfortable and confident in\nwho\ni am as ashley and not have the world\ntell me who i am but know who i am\nbecause of how i know god made me\nbecause i know what comes out of my\nmouth\nbecause i know what i i look at because\ni know what i\ndo on a daily basis with the tangible\nthings that i am able to do\nand there are so many covers that\nhave not come there are so many jobs\nthat i i\nwish have and and would would and will\num that have not but i'm not wrapped up\nin that because\ni know what i'm doing is making a change\nin the world that i'm living in today\nand um and i think that if i were to be\nso wrapped up in\nthe the actual process then i would be\nliving in high\nanxiety every day and i choose not to\nlive in anxiety\nyeah i love that answer that's awesome\nbecause that's something no one can ever\ntake away from you\never nobody can ever be taken away yeah\nexactly\nabsolutely thank you for sharing that i\njust i've been thinking about that a lot\nespecially with\nso many people's lives today that\nrevolve around a cover or a movie or an\nevent or a promotion it's always about\nthis result result result\nbut it's hard to get to that place it is\nespecially in an industry that is so\nwrapped up in\nwhat you do have and what people see on\nsocial media\nand um and it's hard to teach the next\ngeneration that as well because\neverything is about like\nthe look and the glam and the the\nand and like the behind the scenes and\nlike\non and also just like showing literally\neverything and not having anything\nsacred and you know none of that bothers\nme none of that affects me\nbecause i know who i am and i know what\nmy mission is and\ni think it's important absolutely i love\nhow that message keeps\ncoming back through everything you say\nwhich just shows how\ncrystal clear it is it's awesome you\nmentioned there and we spoke about this\nat lunch\nabout your relationship yes you've been\nmarried for nine years nine years ago\nyes which is amazing congratulations\nthank you that's awesome i love that\ni've been married every year is a\njourney\nabsolutely you're three i've been\nmarried for three together and my wife\nwas six okay got it yeah we've been\nmarried for three did it feel different\nafter you got married it did\nit feel better i actually loved getting\nmarried it was amazing like i think it\njust\nyeah it was one of the best decisions i\never made\nand i was i was always like i always say\nthis day when i'm like i upgraded\ntotally like life's awesome\nand that's a good feeling too like you\nknow you did better than you could\nshe's beautiful i can't wait to meet her\nshe's she's awesome she's just great\nenergy\nshe's lovely to be around and she's just\nshe's just a wonderful soul so\nand i can't wait to meet your husband\ntoo yeah we'll do a double date but i\nwas going to ask this because my\naudience\nloves relationship advice loves learning\nabout love\nloves learning about understanding\nyourself in a relationship with another\npartner\nyeah i'd love to hear some of the most\nincredible lessons you've learned in\nyour nine years of marriage\nfrom your partner and from that\npartnership well\nsomething that i've realized with justin\nis that\nconsistency is key and the more\nconsistent you are with your partner the\nmore trust you're gonna build with them\num and i think that also putting them\nfirst because when you're in a\nrelationship it's not about you anymore\nit's about that other person\nand um and that's something that you\nknow being i got married at 22\nand i had to learn that lesson because\nat 22 you're kind of selfish\nand justin is so patient\noh my i never knew patience until i met\njustin wow\nlike it is he is the definition of\npatience that's\nawesome so i i i really had to\nunderstand what it was\nto put justin before myself and and and\ni think that\nthe more i put him in front of me the\nmore love and and vice versa the\nmore that he puts me in front of him our\nlove has really grown\nand then we've just been consistent with\nthat wow consistency\nyeah which is so underrated it's so\nunder but you know the reason i even\nlike started to fall in love with justin\nis because he was consistent he was the\nonly guy that i had ever dated that was\nactually consistent\nwith what putting what he said into\naction and his actions in his words\nand how he was consistently calling me\nand dating me and relating to me like\nhe is such a consistent man that it\nthat's really truly what i fell in love\nwith what a beautiful quality to look\nout for\nand that's so for anyone who's listening\nor watching right now you'll never find\nthat in a clickbait article\nso you know that like consistency it's\nsuch a great\nvalue to look for and we all know that\nyou'll only be happy in life if what you\nthink\nsay and do are aligned and you'll only\nfeel peace and\nsimilarly with your partner if you're\nwith someone who thinks\nsays and does and that's a line for them\ntoo\nthat's brilliant that's that's such a\ngreat unique i've never heard that i've\nnever heard anyone say that yeah that's\nawesome no i\ni just think that we struggle today to\nthink about what we want in someone\nagain like what you said if you don't\nknow who you are similarly what we want\nwhat we want is based on the movies we\nwatch what we want is based on the music\nvideos\nwhat we want is based on what our\nparents had or didn't have\nright right so many of our beliefs\naround relationships\ntotally are filling that void i wrote\ndown a list of things that i wanted\nokay in a man and i was like and it was\nlike my top ten\ni wrote it down i folded it up put it in\na box and then like poof a year later i\ngot it\nno question write it down it's okay\nokay but i didn't write down consistency\nhe just came with that oh okay\ndid you take this to all your dates were\nyou like under the table can you imagine\nright now thank god\nmy mom when she was dating um she\ndefinitely had this guy\nshare his list with her and he had he\nhad a little he had a list\nhe had a list and he crossed out long\nhair and put loyal instead\nthat's awesome i love how they're in the\nsame category oh it's like long hair\nand loyal that is brilliant i picked out\ntwo of the most\nasked questions about relationships this\nyear on the internet from google so i\nwant to ask them\nall right so they are the first one is\nwhat does a healthy relationship look\nlike that's one of the most google\nthings about\nthat's so funny okay um most healthy\nreally\nuh what's your opinion no i yeah no i\nthink it's a good question because i\nthink a lot of people want to be in\nhealthy relationships and\nfor me i think that when you and your\npartner are making each other better\nyou know that song you make me better\nyeah like that's real\nbecause if you're making fabulous neo\nthere we go\nyeah yeah we're the same age\nbut i think that when you're making each\nother better and you can put each other\nfirst and then at the end of it you can\nboth adore each other\nlike that to me is a perfect\nrelationship because you've in a sense\ngot it all\nyeah i love that great answer and and\nwe'll play that song some more as well\nyes you make me\nyeah and you gotta grind a little bit\nlike\ngrind on your partner\ni'm just thinking you're fabulous and\nneo grinding each other no no no\nno never know maybe yeah um\nsorry fab listen i don't know either of\nyou no we're not putting that on you\nuh the second most googled question was\nhow can you build trust in a\nrelationship\nconsistency okay yeah oh my gosh i mean\ni think trust in a relationship is\nsomething that\num that is built over time but that\nyou know you talked about how like your\nactions your words and and what was it\nyour thoughts all have to line up but\nwhat i've always understood\nis that if your action your actions will\nalways speak louder than your words\nand you can say that you want to do\nsomething and not\nactually do it so if you're doing what\nyou're saying and you're saying\nconsistent with that\nthen you're definitely going to build\ntrust 100 like that's it like\nmy husband and i trust each other so\nincredibly that it's like\nsometimes we don't see each other for a\ncouple weeks and it's you know we do a\nquick check-in text message every day\nbecause that's a rule of ours but but\nthat's it like because we just trust\neach other\nyes absolutely yeah love is a verb not a\nnoun yes right you have to show it and\nthat's why\ni think so many people get lost because\nyou can have an abusive relationship\nwhere someone says i love you\nbecause we think love is a noun been\nthere done that fear or love\nbut you don't feel it and then you can\nbe in a a relationship that's\nyou know ownership like it doesn't it's\nnot a partnership it's ownership like\nsomeone feels like they own you\nbut they say i love you and again but\nwhen you realize that love is a verb\nyou can then very quickly judge whether\nsomeone actually loves you or not\nand love is a verb y'all yes love is a\nverb not a noun it's so easy to get lost\nin\njust being hearing the right stuff and\nif we've never heard it before\nit sounds intoxicating right it's\namazing it's such a wonderful feeling\nto hear that you're loved even if you're\nnot feeling it uh and and i love that\nway that you're talking about how\nactions are louder than words ultimately\nas well that's same point being made\nthere i love that and then the third\nquestion i had about that was\nwhat's the best relationship advice\nyou've ever received and who was it from\ni know you probably say your mom so no\nit's not this time okay\nno i mean i sadly my mom and dad's\nrelationship only lasted 26 years and i\nthink she learned a lot\ni learned a lot from her divorce as well\nbut um\nmy grandmother actually told me when i\ngot married she goes ashley\nchoose your battles not everything has\nto be a fight\nand not everything should be a fight so\nif you feel that this is a disagreement\ndon't make it into a battle just\nhandle it right then and there and\nthat's what i choose to do now justin\nand i don't even fight it's like and if\nwe do we're just like\nthis is what i think no this is what i\nthink well are we gonna choose to\ndisagree or\nare we going to actually get down to the\nnitty-gritty of it okay great done and\nwe don't go to bed mad at each other\nhave you ever gone back to bed mad at\nyour wife no no\nrules too yes it is like the biggest\nmistake of your life if you do because\nyou\nyou sleep terribly you wake up in the\nmorning you're just like pissed off at\neverything and then you have to it takes\nall day to fix it because you've slept\non it all night\ndon't go to bed mad at each other people\nyeah no it's great advice\nand i love that you said this rules like\nyou said one of our rules\nis when we're away from each other we\nmessage each other yeah we have a few\nrules\ni'd love to hear them yes yeah please\nthere's that we have to check in at\nleast once a day\nyes we don't go longer than uh without\nwe don't go longer than two weeks\nwithout seeing each other\nbecause that's like for us it's like the\nthe breaking point yeah\num and we always respect each other even\nin a fight if it's if there's\nif there's a fight that breaks out it\ndoesn't matter we have to respect each\nother\ni love that yeah don't feel like you\nhave to hurry up it's fine no no i'm\njust i'm just watching the time i need\nto be careful you're like yeah\nbut no no i think that's an awesome\nanswer i i love rules i think rules are\nreally really important and\npeople feel rules ruins spontaneity but\nactually it does no it doesn't yeah\nspontaneous sex we're not talking about\nthat like just make rules for\nand regulations within like the time\nthat you spend together or how you treat\neach other how you communicate\nhow often you communicate exactly just\nset standards right\nsetting standards so that no one's let\ndown and i think a lot of us\nwe think that spontaneity and dynamism\nis lost with rules but actually rules\njust enhance that\nit gives you more opportunity to have\nthose and i've definitely seen that in\nso many relationships that don't have\nrules\nthat actually just start losing\nstandards and then people end up\nsettling\ni know or lowering their standards and\nthen it's lost yeah so\nyour standards yeah don't lower your\nstandards absolutely no\ndefinitely it's so easy to settle in\nrelationships it is it's really really\neasy been there done that\nyeah yeah and we lower our standards\nwhen we're lonely as well\nlike i see that a lot today that i see\nfriends who see all their friends are in\na relationship and then you want a\nrelationship because your friends are in\none\nand so loneliness becomes your metric of\nwhy you want someone\nthen you're just like a serial dater\nyeah or serial sleeper around her\nexactly exactly and what you said about\narguments is so important there's this\nincredible study by\njohn gottman and john gottman and his\nwife i don't know how long they've been\nmarried\nbut they're very very very old and\ni i literally got to see them at a\nconference we were speaking at and i i\nfangirled over them because i love their\nresearch\nand and they're both so adorable\ntogether but their research from the\ngottman institute\ntalks about how the number one skill\nthat keeps relationships together\nis not date nights it's not cruises it's\nnot holidays\nit's knowing how to fight oh wow like\nthat's the number one skill that keeps a\nrelationship together long term so what\nyou just said there\nit's like knowing how to fight and i i\nknow we talk a lot about the love\nlanguages but something i've been\nplaying around with a lot recently is\nthe five fight languages like what are\nthey what are the\nfights so we all fight differently like\nso there are some of us in a fight\nsituation\nwho go quiet and we just need to retreat\nand we need to hide away and we need to\nprocess our thoughts then there's\nanother language where it's like i need\nto talk this out right now like\nthis is it like we need to have this\nconversation\nwhich one are you out of those two so\nfar or you're not like both okay\nokay what it is and then and then a\nthird fight language is the language of\ni need to consult someone oh so people\nare like i don't like to bring other\npeople into my drawing neither do i\nbut but you hear it often where people\nare oh i need to talk to this or i need\nto talk to that\nanother fight language is the language\nof\ninstant blame like you just start\nblaming that person straight away like\nyou don't want to take any\nresponsibility for it\nand of course that's very juvenile yes\nvery but it happens\ni know i'm sure you've experienced it or\nseen it look i've done it\ni'm not gonna sit here and lie to you\nyeah but like jeez yeah hearing you say\nit that that's like an actual trade i'm\nlike i don't do that\nyeah we wish we didn't this is why i i\ntell people whenever you have an emotion\nvoice note it right and play it back to\nyourself isn't that and you\nrealize how silly it sounds if you're\ncomplaining about your partner or an\nargument or anything voice note record\nit\nand play it back to you interesting and\nyou will hear your voice and then it'll\nsound like someone else is saying it to\nyou and you'll be like\noh because what we do is we take our\nemotions really seriously\nright but when a friend's saying\nsomething like oh come on get over it\nright and so when you hear your voice as\nif it's a friend sharing it with you\nyou can kind of go the other thing that\ni just uh bernay brown\nuh was talking about is like what's the\nstory you're telling in your head\nand when you can say the story that\nyou're telling in your head to your\npartner\nand vice versa the stories never line up\nyes\nso i was like oh i'm gonna bring that\ninto my relationship yeah i just love\nthat idea\nexactly because so many people they\nthink so differently\ntotally and that's totally fine too i\nthink we're always looking we're always\ntold\nfind someone who thinks like you find\nyou alike good luck yeah exactly how\nhard is that good luck finding someone\nwith the same love language too yeah\nexactly\nand you don't need to either that's the\nproblem right so\nyeah it's crazy okay we've got time for\na couple more questions\ni wanted to talk about your partnership\nwith ellen\nyeah because i'm about to embark on that\njourney\nso you need all your your wishes are you\nshooting soon and experience\nyeah yeah okay great yeah so very\nexcited about it\nbut you've got season two of fearless\nyes coming out when's it coming out\num so we start shooting fearless really\nsoon and it's just been so incredible\nbecause i've been able to go to some\nlike meet people from even cities that\ni'm from and\nand and just open up a whole new door\nthat they never thought could ever be\neven cracked\nand it's like we're giving opportunities\nto people who\nhave felt like the underdogs who have\nfelt not even worthy to walk\ninto their greatness or into the ability\nthat\nthat they've that they've dreamt of and\num and and being able to work with ellen\nand her team has been\nthis like incredibly eye-opening\nexperience that i've\nabsolutely loved and just seeing\npeople's lives change right before your\neyes is also just\noh you've got people in tears\nit's literally like every episode it's\nlike yeah it's a sound it's like oh\nso it's been absolutely amazing yeah\nyeah i've had so much fun you're gonna\nhave great shoes yeah it's been\nbeautiful to watch too i feel like\nthe the emotion that's captured in in\nseason one\nyeah it's just unbelievable yeah like\nyou're seeing people literally like\nbreak down having to fall to their knees\nor just fall in people's arms and and um\nyou know ricky who transitioned\nit was that was this like incredible\nmoment he had never met a trans person\nbefore in his life\nand then there's laverne cox and here we\nare\nyou know giving him money for for his um\noperations and it's just like\nboom boom boom it's just it's like it's\nheartbreaking\nto see that these opportunities have\nnever been uh afforded to him but it's\nalso just so\nincredible to see that that we were able\nto to give him the space to be himself\nso you know i mean like and everybody's\nstory is just so different that was the\none that\nlike that i kept hearing come back\nthough so i'm excited to shoot\nseason two that's amazing i want to\ngo towards towards the end of our\ninterview now but i wanted to ask you a\nquestion about you've seen\nand created so many shifts in the beauty\nindustry\nwhich ones are you really happy about\nthat have changed\nand which ones are you still trying to\nchange well what i really want to see\nchange\nis that that we don't have to have this\nconversation anymore that everything is\nthe norm\nthat inclusivity diversity is the norm\nand i think that\nthings are shifting in that direction\nbut you know i've been doing this for 20\nyears\nand i've never seen something rapidly\nhappen this\nquickly and and it's it feels like this\nwild success within the fashion industry\nwhich i'm i'm so excited for everybody\nthat's been a part of the process\num so i think that we need to see more\ncurves on the runway i think that\ndesigners once they start understanding\nthat\nnot every model or person or\nor or a customer is not going to fit\ninto this ideal\nsize or ideal beauty or whatever then\nthen more designers are going to be like\noh okay well i don't have to just keep\nputting the same type of person on the\nrunway\ni don't have to just keep it in the same\ntype of person in a campaign so i think\nthat that's what i'm most excited to see\nis like hopefully in the next five years\nwe see even more of a change\nand you know you've seen the industry\nchange as a model her name is paloma\nessler and she's\num she's been doing incredible\neditorials that\ngirls women that look like us that have\nour bodies have never been afforded\nbefore\nand um and there's so many designers\nlike the ones that i had said before\nchristian probable michael that are just\ngiving so many opportunities\nfor curvy women to be able to dress\nthemselves in cool comfortable clothes\nand uh so yes there's a long way to go\nbut we have come so\nfar which is also so great yeah and i\nlove that you've been such a huge part\nof that\nthank you and to be able to sit here and\nhave this conversation with you like i\nthink we should celebrate that because\nit's going to take i hope that this\ninterview is going to inspire more\npeople\nin whatever space you're in whatever\nindustry you're in\nbig or small like it doesn't matter\nabout the scale but it's about starting\nto have a voice starting to make that\nshift starting to stand up for what you\nbelieve in\nstand up what's important use your voice\nyeah and that's in any industry\nabsolutely awesome so we end every\ninterview with the final five which is\nrapid fire quick fire round we do it in\npretty big deals\nyou do answers are only one word or one\nsentence maximum oh god okay\nyeah so are you ready yeah do you want\nto wait did we do
