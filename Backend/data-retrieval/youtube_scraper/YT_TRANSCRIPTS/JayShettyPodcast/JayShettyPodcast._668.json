    "transcript": "it was just the natural anxiety that i\nhad my whole life was causing me to have\na panic attack i remember having a panic\nattack\nat that football game so you know for me\nit was just\na learning experience because because it\nwas it was uh\nvalidating everything my father was\ntelling me and my father was telling me\nthat if i didn't change my behavior if i\ndidn't change my lifestyle i was gonna\nend up in jail dead or broke sitting\nunder the trees\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\ni'm so grateful that you keep taking out\nthe time to invest in your growth\nyour education and for you to move\nforward and today's guest\nis gonna help you do just that today's\nguest is super unique it doesn't really\nneed an introduction but i'm gonna give\nhim one anyway because i think that it's\nimportant for each and every person that\nwe have\non the show today's guest is charlemagne\nhe's best known\nfor co-hosting the breakfast club he's a\nsocial media\ninfluencer and executive producer and\nsomeone who i think has a really\ninteresting way of thinking about\nculture media and what's happening in\nthe world today\nand i can't wait to tap into that\ncharlemagne thank you so much for\nmaking the time man thank you for having\nme yeah thank you for having me for\nbeing here yeah really good man thank\nyou\nyes sir but yeah so today i want to dive\nstraight in i\ncalled the podcast on purpose i believe\nyou're someone who's living a purposeful\nlife\nand i really want to dive into what that\nis but i want to start by setting your\nbackground up a bit because i want my\naudience to really learn about\nwhat you've been through where you've\ncome from and now growing up you went to\njail quite a few times yes indeed right\ntell me about what that experience looks\nlike feels like\nand how you were able to evolve from it\ni said that's an interesting question\nbecause for me\nthe first time i ever went to jail i\ndidn't realize how much trouble i was in\nbecause the first time i went to jail\nwas for sultan brady with an intent to\nkill\nand it was me sitting in the back seat\nwith one of my homeboys\nanother guy that was driving and you\nknow one of my homeboys shot\nat just this car because\nme we had just been arguing with the\nguys we're not really arguing we was in\nthe neighborhood\ntalking to these girls and they drove\nthrough and i was acting like ice cube\nand boys in the hood i had my shirt up i\nain't even had no guns got my shirt up\nlike\nwhat's up y'all got a problem y'all got\na problem so then when we left the\nneighborhood and went to\nuh mcdonald's they followed us they\nfollowed behind us\nand then they pulled up on the side of\nus and so my homeboy shot and\nthey literally came and arrested me the\nnext day from high school and you know\nyou got to think up until that point i\nhaven't gotten into a lot of\ndisciplinary problems in high school but\ni had never been into\na situation serious while i had ended up\nin jail so it's like when they\nput me in handcuffs in high school i\nhonestly didn't even dawn on me that\noh shoot i'm in prison i mean i'm in\njail in county jail in my mind i was\nlike i'll be out\nand by friday in time for the football\ngame you know like i literally thought i\nwas going home that day\nand i remember you know the police\nofficers giving me a statement to write\nand i wrote this\nlong ex lying ass story about how i was\nhitchhiking and\nyou know i jumped in the car with some\nhitchhikers and i don't know who the\npeople were that shot just made up this\nwhole\nbs story you know and i remember the\nofficers coming back saying to me\nyou know we was gonna we was going to\nlet you go but you know you you\nsent us on this wild goose chase and\nthen my father\nmy father was like look you know i'm\ngonna let you sit here for a while\nbecause you know this is what i've been\ntrying to tell you your whole life i've\nbeen trying to tell you that if you\ndon't change your\nyour behavior you're gonna end up in\njail dead or broke sitting under the\ntree and you know\nhe let me sit in there for like 45 50\ndays wow\nyeah i mean he was he was actually he\nwas waiting for the bond to go down as\nwell\nbut he really wanted wanted me to learn\na lesson and you know\ni didn't learn that lesson the first\ntime i went to jail you know i learned\nit more like the second\nor third time i went to jail because you\nknow when i first got out\ni was i actually the day i went out i\nwent right back to the hood\nand my father told me not to do that and\nyou got to think i hadn't smoked weed\nfor 50 days so that's that's kind of\nlike when my love affair with marijuana\nstopped because i remember getting out\nafter those 50 days\nand smoking weed and being so paranoid\nand all i kept thinking about was i'm\nabout to go back to jail i'm about to go\nback to you i'm about to go back to jail\nbut i didn't realize at the time i was\ndealing with anxiety too\nso not only was it the weed it was just\nthe natural anxiety that i had my whole\nlife was causing me to have a panic\nattack i remember having a panic attack\nat that football game so you know for me\nit was just\na learning experience because because it\nwas it was\nuh validating everything my father was\ntelling me and my father was telling me\nthat if i didn't change my behavior\nif i didn't change my lifestyle i was\ngonna end up in jail dead or broke\nsitting under the tree so when you see\nthings happen to other people\nyou know wise people learn from those\nmistakes but you know you know\na lot of times you know you you have to\ngo through things yourself\nyou know in order to to really learn\nfrom them that's why they say small\npeople learn from their own mistakes\nwatch people learn from the mistakes of\nothers\ni wasn't wise then you know i probably\nwasn't even smart\nbut i had to go through all of that you\nknow just to just to learn the lesson\nthat my father had been trying to tell\nme for years yeah what was it about that\nthird time where you were like okay now\ni get it\nlike now i get the lesson it wasn't it\nwasn't even necessarily just a third\ntime remember the second time i got\nlocked up i got locked up for um\ndistribution of marijuana because i sold\nto undercover\nand they had a drug bust on on\nmy the the house we used to trap out of\nrest in peace to my man jerrell garnett\nand we all was in jail and i remember\njust all of us being in the cell and\njust\ni just threw up like a little i wasn't\ndrunk or anything i just i was just\nsick because i'm like oh my god i'm back\nin jail\nlike but i was only there for the\nweekend and then it was just like\nyou know the third time was just like\nman i'm\ni'm just i'm i've put myself in such\ngood positions you know what i mean but\nthen i put myself in such bad positions\nand it's like you can't\nyou know play both sides you know what\ni'm saying you got to really do one or\nthe other so\nit was just me finally realizing once\nagain\neverything my father is saying is true\nif i don't change my lifestyle i'm going\nto end up\nin jail dead or broke sitting under the\ntree when you see people that you grew\nup with who you used to look up to and\nthey really are broke sitting under the\ntree or you got people who\nend up going to jail for five years that\nwas the first time my homeboy he\nactually went to jail for five years he\nwas the first person i knew\nthat had like a a longer prison sentence\nand those five years seemed like forever\nuntil he came home but you know like\nthose those type of situations just\nfinally made me say like yo this is real\nand i'm not going to waste my\nlife and i and i always had this vision\nof the future\nyou know cause i don't know what i was\nreading one day but i just said\neverything you do in your life today\ndirectly\nimpacts what happens in your life\ntomorrow and or maybe i saw it back to\nthe future and i was like damn\ni remember i feel like i believe in the\nspace time continuum so it's like you\nknow you\nyou see what happens if you don't make\nthe right decisions\nyou know in your past that will impact\nyour future and i always\nthought about that you know i thought\nabout what\nmy friends were doing or what my cousins\nwere doing you know and and and what was\ncausing them to be\nwashed so to speak or causing them to\nend up in jail and i just was like i'm\nabout to do the exact opposite\nand that's exactly what i did i started\ngoing to night school i started\nyou know working real jobs like i just\ndid anything i had to do to create\npositive energy in my life i love that\nman because i think a lot of us can have\nthat experience maybe not to the same\nextreme\nof going to jail multiple times but i\nthink a lot of people listening right\nnow watching right now would say that\nwe're not wise we don't learn from the\nmistakes of others we don't learn from\nhearing about the mistakes of others\nwe learn by unfortunately or fortunately\ngoing through the experiences\nand one thing that you sparked was what\nyou said about your father\nthere's there's a statement that says\nthe day that you realize your parents\nwere right your kids are telling you\nthat you're wrong\nall right but i mean do you have that\nsometimes do your kids\nwhen you're coaching your kids or you're\nsharing that wisdom with them or insight\nwith them\ni haven't gotten to that point yet like\nmy oldest daughter is 10. okay\nmy other daughter's three and i got a\nseven month old so i haven't gotten to\nthat point where like my like\nyou know both of my daughters have their\nown personalities they're both very\nstrong-willed\nbut for the most part you know\nespecially my oldest daughter she really\nlistens to me my\nsecond daughter don't listen to me at\nall but she's only three so i gotta give\nher time but my oldest daughter listens\nto me a lot and she listens to me\nwell that's beautiful and intently you\nknow and then\nyou know she just i guess maybe because\nwe're both kansas you know\nmy my my birthday's the 29th of the 27th\nso she's just\nin tune with me in a different way and\ni think that she's grasping the concept\nof\nwhatever happens today will dictate what\nhappens in your life tomorrow because\ni realize she has a lot of plans like\nyou know she's been talking about going\nto harvard for the longest and she\nstarted talking about going to ucla\nbecause of their\ngymnastics program if i'm not mistaken\nor the cheerleader might be chilling in\nthat i don't remember some program ucla\nhad that she's really into\nbut then she says she wants to be a\ndentist and you know she hears me talk\nabout business a lot and the one thing i\ndo is\nif i'm on a like a business call i i\nif she's riding in the car with me i\nhave the phone on speaker because i\ndon't think\ni think kids we learn we we learn like\nwe the stuff we think is in the\nbackground to kids is actually top of\nthe mind awareness to kids so when\nwe're having these conversations kids\nlearn from that kids learn from what\nthey hear us say kids learn from what\nthey see us do so you know if you\nwalking around your kids yelling and\nscreaming and cursing all the time don't\nbe surprised when they start yelling and\nscreaming the cursing but when you\nhaving conversations about business and\nyou know buying\nyou know commercial real estate and\nfranchising and you know whatever\nwhatever it is like she takes\nall of that in like she wrote a\nscreenplay the other day no way\nshe wrote it for she just it was\nsomething for school but it was a\nscreenplay i'm like how do you learn to\nwrite a screenplay\nand she was like because i read a harry\npotter book one time that was a\nscreenplay i don't know it was a harry\npotter it was some book that she read\nthat was in the form of a screenplay\nshe wrote her own screenplay now she's\nshe says i'm writing a book i don't want\nyou to read it till i'm finished i'm\nlike\ndo your thing like i'm not going to\nstifle anything you do creatively yeah\nno go\nit's beautiful man i think that's a\ngreat trip yeah kids don't do as you say\nthey do as you do\nabsolutely that's fine batman yo that's\nso funny you say that i was having\nthat conversation with somebody earlier\ntoday and i was talking about\ni maybe it was yesterday i remember i\nwas talking about like how you know the\nstupidest thing you could tell somebody\nespecially when you're a parent is don't\ndo as i do\ndo as i say no like i'm going to do what\ni see you do\ni'm not like i don't care about your\nyour words and lip service i care about\nyour actions and deeds\nyes and that's how all of us learn like\nyeah we're a visual people\nyou know if you show me how to do\nsomething as opposed to tell me how to\ndo something\ni'm going to learn faster well at least\ni do yeah me too no 100 man and and then\nthis seems like a massive switch in your\nlife because you have this moment or a\nfew moments and you're now saying you're\ngoing to night school\nyou start getting real jobs you shift\ninto being a local radio station how\ndoes that shift happen\nand why do you think you get start\ngetting pushed in that direction of of\nmusic and radio\nthat [ __ ] happened because i believe\nthat positive energy activates constant\nelevation\nand i mean i always wanted to rap like i\ngot i got wolverine tattooed on my arm\nholding the microphone i got this when i\nwas 17. so i always wanted to rap\nand it's you know i got wolverine hole\nin the mic because i thought that the\nmicrophone was going to change my life\nit did just not the way that i thought\nit was going to and so like you know\nwhen you're a black man growing up in a\ncertain environment\nthe people you see who who are\nsuccessful that look like you are\nusually in rap\nor they're usually in you know uh\nathletics\nyou know so so for me i wanted to rap so\ni i would\nbe at these local studios i was at a\nstudio called tnt\nand uh then i was at another studio\ncalled never so deep you know never so\ndeep those are my that's my family\nyou know dr robert evans and his son you\nknow\nbless and for me i met this guy named\nwillie will\nand he's a radio personality and he was\na local radio personality at z93 jams in\ncharlton south carolina and i remember\njust\nyou know i'm like that now if i see\nsomebody doing something interesting i\njust asked them how did they get into it\nyou know what\nwhat how did you how did you get into\nwhatever it is that you're doing\nand i said how did you get in the radio\nman and he was like i went down and i\ngot an internship\nand he's like you went down and got an\ninternship like like it's that easy\nand he was like yeah i'm like you'll not\nbe in school or nothing he was like nah\nthis is 1998 in charlton south carolina\nso\nit you know the entry the path to entry\nwas a little bit\nless difficult than it is now and so\nthat's what i did i went down there and\ni got an internship and\nthat's how i got my foot in the door\nradio and for me a guy who\nnever been to college didn't have no\ncollege degree uh\nmight have just graduated night school\nand had my diploma that was a\nhuge deal for me because that was the\nfirst environment i was in that was\nlike really corporate even though i had\nworked at you know telemark\nuh a a telemarketing place called\nparagon solutions\ni worked at demo in the mall which was a\nclothing store but that\nwas a big deal because it's that's you\nknow for me that's z93\ni'm from monks corner south carolina my\nwhole life with z93 is the heritage\nstation in that area it's still there\nright now so that's what we used to\nalways listen to so for me to\njust be in that building even though i\nwas just an intern you know i was\nyou know driving the station vehicle and\ngoing to get the jocks pizza whatever it\nwas\nthat just felt like such a big deal even\njust driving the truck and people\nblowing their horn at you and\nthey driving down the highway like oh\nz93 like that was such a big deal for me\nso that's that's how i got into\nthat space you know what i'm saying just\njust really following my dreams and\nthat's why i always say\ni'm not afraid to say [ __ ] my dreams you\nknow in my first book black privilege\nyou know i have a chapter called [ __ ]\nyour dreams you know\nit's [ __ ] your dreams if they're not\nyour dream cause rap really wasn't my\ndream rap was just something\ni wanted to do because i saw it working\nfor other people i saw it working for\npeople\nwho looked like me so me following that\ndream led me to be in that recording\nstudio but\nwhat was really supposed to happen i was\nsupposed to have that conversation with\nwillie will\nand willie will was supposed to\nintroduce me to this game that changed\nmy life\nwhich is radio and that's exactly what\nhappened yeah i love that man and a lot\nof people won't know this as well is\nthat mine's the same so i have a\nmicrophone tattooed on my neck\nbecause i grew up wanting to be a rapper\nas well so if you're in the source\nmagazine\nwow i wanted to be a rapper too and i\nused to love\nlove spoken word i used to love writing\ni used to love word and that was the\nsame thing for me\nand i had the same experience because i\nused to do internet choice fm choice fm\nwas london's because i\nborn and raised in london the choice fm\nwas london's\nlike underground grime you know hip-hop\nthat was our space so i was interning\nthere when i was around\n17. and for me it was the same thing and\nthen i realized through the same process\nthat what i loved was moving people\nthrough language\nmoving people through words\ncommunication communication that's what\ni love\nso even though i'm not a rapper now in\nmy life my whole life revolves around a\nmicrophone\nwhether that's podcasting whether it's\nvideo but the point is it's using words\nto articulate a message that moves and\ntransforms people's lives\nsame here that's important that's that's\nvery interesting you say that because\nthat's what i\nhave always known but just started to\nreally\nunderstand like i i tell people i've\nbeen doing radio 21 years but i feel\nlike the past\ntwo years i've been really walking in my\npurpose you know and and\ni think that purpose is you know knowing\nthat when you\ngot a certain platform and you know when\nthat platform gets to a certain level\nlike you're here to deliver some some\ntype of messaging\nyou know and i feel like that's where\nthat's where i'm at now with it in my\ncareer it's awesome man what is the\npurpose where\nwhere is your purpose right now like\nwhat is it exactly and how is it serving\npeople\nthis is exactly what you just said\nserving people you know i i wrote an\narticle\ni used to write for ozone magazine back\nin the day i don't know if you remember\nozone\nbut i used to write for ozone i remember\nwriting this article called what would\nit was it was what would jesus do so it\nwas wwjd but it was what would jesus do\nif jesus was a jock so it was all of\nthose initials\nyeah basically and uh i was saying that\nif jesus was\nalive he would be a radio personality\nslash\ndj because i really truly feel like\nwe're public servants and we're here to\nserve the needs of the public\nyou know we're not public servants like\npolice officers we're not public\nservants like\nyou know uh firefighters you know but\nwe're public servants\nbeing that every day somebody gets up in\nthe morning 6 a.m to 10 a.m\nand we got to get them through you know\nwe help them\nget their day started we give them their\nnews we give them their information we\nentertain them we\neducate them you know we give them that\nenergy\nand i truly feel like that is what\nyou're supposed to do when you have\naccess to these big platforms like\nmalcolm x said\nthe person who controls the media\ncontrols the minds of the masses and i\nmean if you notice we're getting fear\nwe're getting fed a lot of bs right now\nyou know it's a lot of\nfear-mongering going on you know it's a\nlot of uh\nanti-intellectualism going on and i'm\nnot saying i'm the most intellectual\n[ __ ] out here at all\nbut i know the people who are and being\nthat i know who the\npeople who are i got a platform of four\nto five million people\nthat they can talk to whenever they want\nto so so that's what i use\nmy platform for if it's not me\ndelivering the messaging that\nmay impact somebody's life or affect\nsomebody's life i know the people\nthat can so for me that's what my\npurpose is\nto to to serve the needs of the public\nand one of the biggest things i think\nthat the public needs right now\nis we just need to be mentally healthy\nand\nit's so it's so wild to me everything\nthat i'm realizing now i always knew\nlike i told you i wrote that article\nabout being a public servant a long time\nago and\nbefore that i always knew that\neverything was mental like i always knew\nthat and\nit can it can go back to like another\nbad creation saying everything is mental\nuh\nyou know tlc saying everything is mental\nuh you know rizzo's saying everything is\nmental\neverything starts with your thoughts you\nknow like when they teach you in\nkindergarten if you can\nconceive it you can achieve it like you\nhave to be mentally healthy to even have\nthat kind of optimism\nand you wonder why so many brothers in\nthe hood so many sisters in the hood\ndon't have that kind of optimism\nit's because they're dealing with their\ninsecurity and their anxiety and their\ndepression and just\ntrauma and pain how can i think clearly\nhow can this tool that can change my\nlife which is my brain how can i\nproperly use that\nif i got all of these you know obstacles\nand these these\ndistractions in my head that are keeping\nme from thinking\noptimistically so that my my biggest\nthing right now is just to just\njust to spread that word of investing in\nyour mental wealth\nyeah i love that man and that's the same\nreason why i started social media like\nmy\nmy mission on social media is making\nwisdom go viral so it's like how do you\ntake this wisdom that's like\nhidden away it was only for the elite it\nwas only for people who\nwent and had these crazy experiences and\nadventures how do we take that\nand spread it to everyone so that that\naverage kid in london where i grew up or\nthe average kid in new york city where\nwe are right now\ncan come across it and find it too they\ndon't need to go read a book right now\nthey don't need to go and\ntravel halfway across the world to find\nit and so with that how did you start\nbecause you talk about how at 40\nyou had a spiritual awakening how did\nyou get to a point where\nyou started to confront the fact that\nthere were beliefs\npain trauma from your past that you'd\nnever faced before\nand that's what's clouding and blocking\nso many people today our mental health\nor our mental wealth is lost\nbecause we're clouded by all this pain\nfrom the past challenges we never looked\nat\nhow did you start to confront that and\nwhere can people start to\nmath for me you know i started unpacking\na lot of that\nin therapy you know i always say that\nwhen it comes to therapy\nyou know therapy is like having a real\njunky closet so you got just a messy\ncloset everywhere so you start to\npack up the things that you don't need\nand things that don't serve you anymore\nand you get rid of that\nand the things you want to keep you hang\nup nice and neat and then you got room\nto bring new stuff in\nbut you know to get to that point it was\njust me\nnot only asking myself a whole lot of\nquestions having conversations\nwith other people you know it's so funny\nman i got like friends who used to tell\nme that they thought i was a sociopath\nbecause i didn't really show any\nemotions i didn't seem like anything\never got to me you know i i didn't have\nempathy for\nother people and some of that could have\nbeen true but you know i just think that\nall of us are just so selfish so we're\nall just\nstuck in our own world and i mean i'm\nsure you can attest to the fact that\nwhen you really on your grind and you\ntrying to get it like you're not\nthinking about nobody else like when\nwhen i was thinking about everybody else\nearly on in my career\nit was like i had a bunch of stuff\nweighing me down\nyou know and it's like yo you can't take\neverybody with you until you get\nto where you're supposed to go so i\nremember telling my homeboy dj frosty\nwhen i first got the job at the\nbreakfast club i said you know what i'ma\ndo man this time around\nsomething i've never done before i'm\ngonna be completely selfish\ni said i'm gonna focus on me and only me\nand then when i get to where i feel like\ni need to be i'm gonna\nyou know start start bringing everybody\nelse along\nso for me when i started just\nhaving conversations with other people\nright stop being selfish i actually\nstarted listening because that's one\nthing social media did do it it woke a\nlot of people up because\nyou know just our language like you\nwould say little things\ni remember one time i got on on twitter\nand i said something about females like\ni thought you're females whatever\nwhatever\nand it was just like all these comments\nyou don't call women females and i'm\nlike what the\nwhat the [ __ ] what since when don't we\ncall women females but that's just\nyou know new language new information\nand instead of\nat first i dismissed it like i don't\nhear that but then after all i had to\njust stop\nand say okay well let me see why they\ndon't want to be called\nfemale so they broke it down to me why\nthey don't want to be called females or\neven\nyou know conversations with with black\nwomen you know what i'm saying like\nblack we\nwe tend to take for granted you know\nblack women you know like i never\ni didn't i i told my uh i used to work\nwith this young lady named crystal i\nstill had my tv show on common sense\nand she used to be on that i remember\nsaying her one day like i really did not\nknow black women\nfelt the way they felt you know because\nmy whole life\nthe strongest people around me was black\nwomen you know my mother my grandmother\nmy aunts you know\nmy my girl who's now my wife so\ni just wasn't paying attention to what\nthey were saying\nyou know i just assumed that they would\nalways be there for us and i just\nassumed that\nthey were strong enough to handle any\nload but you know\nthey was tired you know what i mean and\nthey was tired of a lot of the [ __ ] [ __ ]\nthat we was doing\nso for me just those type of\nconversations started making me\nbe just way more aware of\nwhat was going on around me and it\nstarted making me be more aware of what\nwas going on with myself and i remember\nhaving a conversation\nwith my own girl amanda seals and i\nremember amanda saying yo brothers are\ndamaged\nthey don't want to admit that they're\ndamaged and they don't want to do the\nwork to get no healing\nand i remember just hearing that word\nhealing\nand i remember saying to myself i'm\ngonna go get me some healing\nyou know what i mean i'm gonna go get me\nsome real spiritual\nemotional mental healing forget the gym\nthree or four times a week you know i'm\nsaying i'm about to start going to the\ntherapist every week and i'm about to\nstart\nmeditating and you know i'm about to you\nknow just just do whatever i got to do\nto really put myself in a mentally\nhealthy space and then i wanted to get a\nhandle on my anxiety\nso like you know panic attacks are\nsomething i experienced my whole\nlife and the last really well not the\nlast really big\nreally bad one but the one i had that\nmade me realize i was dealing with\nanxiety was when i was back at home\nliving\nin monks corner south carolina with my\nmother at like 31 32 years old\nmy daughter was like two my now wife had\nto move back home to mom's corner with\nher parents\nand i just got in fire for the fourth\ntime from radio\nfinally started collecting unemployment\nbecause all the other times i was too\nproud to do it so i started collecting\nmy unemployment checks and i remember\ndriving down i-26\nin south carolina and feeling like i was\nabout to die\nlike same feeling the same shortness of\nbreath same crazy heart palpitations had\nto pull over drink some water\nsaid a quick prayer like please god\ndon't let me die on the side of the road\nlike i promise to go to the doctor\ntomorrow\nwent to the doctor the next day doctor's\nlike you got a healthy heart your heart\nis fine\nyou know but he said um he said have you\nhave you ever have you\nsuff do you suffer from anxiety and i'm\nlike no he's like sounds like you had an\nanxiety attack and i'm like i've never\nhad that before but i thought about i'm\nlike yo my whole life\ni've had these things and then the\ndoctor said uh\nare you stressed out about anything i'm\nlike hell yeah you know what i'm saying\nso in my mind i could always point to\nsomething else\nyou know so i didn't deal with it but\nthen once you get my next gig was the\nbreakfast club\nfour or five years later you richer than\nyou ever been you got\nmore opportunities than you ever had but\nyou still having the panic attacks\nyou're still having anxiety and you're\nlike okay where is this coming from and\nthen finally my wife was like yo\ntake your ass to therapy just go see\nwhat's up instead of\nflirting with the idea and talking to\nother people about therapy go\nand that's what i did and then you know\nwhen you start going to therapy you\nstart unpacking all kinds of [ __ ]\nyeah you start dealing with trauma from\nthings that happened to you when you\nwere young things that you thought you\ndealt with that you hadn't\nyou know you started focusing on your\nptsd from things that happened to you\nwhen you was young and then you start\nthinking about you know the pain and the\nhurt that you still feel\nfrom certain situations you don't\nrealize you have been redistributing\nthat pain to other people for so long\nthat's why you didn't have no\nempathy for nobody else because you\nreally was hurting you've been hurting\nso long that you\nnumb to what it is you actually feel so\nyeah you know i love that man and and\nthat's the challenge right like all of\nus have been\nthrough stuff but we've never unpacked\nit we've never repacked we've never\nunlearned we've never figured it out and\nthat's why we end up\nin this position and the problem is\ndenial we sit there and we deny\nthat we have any experience of stress or\npressure or anxiety\nwhen the truth is we're dealing with a\nlot of it and i love that i love the\nfact that you're making that point clear\nis that\nwhatever you're experiencing you're\ndestigmatizing mental health because\nwe think mental health has to be\nsomething super mental\nright like we think mental health has to\nbe something like schizophrenia\nor like a completely a complete\npersonality disorder or something we\ndon't realize that it could just be\nregular anxiety yeah yeah i didn't\nrealize anxiety was a mental health\ndisorder until i started going to tab\nyeah and i remember when they asked me\nto write you know\nmy second book but they didn't ask me to\nwrite one but they wanted me to write a\nsecond book\nand i was like i really don't have\nanything to write about because at that\npoint\ni was really just trying to figure my\nlife out because you got to understand\nlike\nwhen i started going to therapy i'm 40\nnot might have started going to therapy\naround 38 you know\nearly 39 and for me it was like\nyo can you imagine thinking you had it\nall together\nthinking you knew exactly what what what\nwas going on in the world\nand then you start sitting down with a\ntherapist and realizing you don't know\n[ __ ]\nrealizing that you know you you just\neverything that you you was raised\ntotally wrong from in a lot of different\nways you know he was raised wrong by\nyou know the the influences you had\ngrowing up you know he was raised\nwrong by the music he was listening to\ngrowing up you was raised wrong while\nyour environment\nand you've carried all of this stuff\nwith you into your adult world\nand you're still trying to function with\nwith this level of thinking and this\nlevel of understanding of things but\nyou've lived now like you've lived and\nyou've been around the world and you've\ntalked to a lot of people and you've\nseen other things and you realize like\nnah this ain't\nthey're saying it bro like we we we\nwrong so imagine\nfeeling like you know it all to\nrealizing i don't know [ __ ]\nespecially when you're an influencer\nyeah you're an opinion maker like people\ncome to you to listen to your thoughts\nso and then you have to go through that\nprocess absolutely so the only thing i\ncould do\nis like you know what i got to take\npeople on this journey with me\nsimple as that you know i remember i\nremember telling my book publisher like\nlook you know i've been going to therapy\ni've been keeping a journal um you know\ni've been dealing with my anxiety but\nthen i realized i'm dealing with my ptsd\ni'm realizing i got trauma from things\nthat happened to me when i was younger\ni'm\nyou know talking about being molested\nwhen i was eight you know i'm talking\nabout issues with my father like all\nthese different things you know\nuh fear of not being a good husband fear\nnot being a good father\nyou know fear of you know not being a\ngood friend\nyou know just all kind of different\nthings and so i just started\nturning these into a paint in the pages\nof a book and what i was trying to do i\nwas trying to\ntranslate what my therapist was telling\nme but that doesn't work you know\nbecause\nwhat your therapist is telling you just\nhelps for you to have a better\nunderstanding of what it is you're going\nthrough so one thing that my therapist\ndid help me do\nwas explain what i was going through\nbetter but i brought in a doctor named\ndr\nish to give like the clinical\ncorrelations to everything that i was\nfeeling and that's\nthat's what was that was really the most\nbeautiful thing about the book that was\ntherapeutic for me and i know people say\nthat all the time when they write books\noh it's therapeutic for me but no this\nwas really therapeutic for me because\nthis is not a it's not a book about\nunderstanding like it's not\nit's a book of confusion it's a book of\nunpacking it's a book of\nthis is all the [ __ ] that don't serve me\nno more this is this is what was [ __ ]\nup about me\nyou know and i don't want this no more\nlike here y'all take this this is gone\nyou know cause i'm at stage zero\nright now and guess what happy to be at\nstage 0.\nlike it feels good to not know yeah you\nknow and it feels good to say you don't\nknow\nyeah and i feel like at 40 i'm doing\nmore unlearning than learning\nabsolutely man at this point yeah\nabsolutely and that's that's the biggest\nchallenge today is like that\nability to speed up unlearning\nrelearning yes\nright relearning again and i think so\nmany of us get blocked by thinking we\nknow it all already so i love that man\nit's great message\nlet's tap into some of those fears in a\nbit more detail because i think\nyour unlearning and your healing and\nthose are awesome so\nif we look at something like parental\nparanoia which i know a lot of people\nhave\nlike becoming a parent i'm not a parent\nand that's why i'm asking but i'm also\nasking it because\none area of wisdom that i don't talk\nabout is parenting because i'm not a\nparent\nand i know my audience cares a lot about\nthis so let's talk about that parental\nparanoia\nwhich i think is very normal how have\nyou kind of grown to deal with that and\nwork with that or heal that\nyou said something earlier you said\nsomething about you what do you say\nyou realize you're a parent when you\nrealize your parents today you realize\nyour parents are right your kids are\ntelling you that you're wrong\nyeah and and i guess that was another\none of those\nmoments you know um only because\nyou think about all the times your\ngrandmother used\nto trip out over you all the times your\nmother and father used to trip out over\nyou uh\nwonder where you was at and why you\ndidn't come home like i remember my\nfather\nyou know he gave my my sister older\nsister beating because she broke curfew\nand\ni remember everybody running around the\ntown looking for her trying to find out\nwhere she was and this is\nnow it's just like that is only\nthat's a paranoia that only a parent can\nunderstand\nyou know what i'm saying like the love\nyou have for\nyour children like those are risks but i\ngot three girls so those are that's\nreally your heart\noutside of your body like you're looking\nlike somebody just ripped my organ out\nand threw it on the table and i'm like\ncould you be more gentle with my heart\nmy heart\nso it's just like when my daughter is on\nthe way to school in the morning\nyou know uh her being at school right\nnow like i don't feel any sense of\nrelief\nwell i got a sense of relief not gonna\nknow three o'clock so she's out of\nschool now she got to school 2 30. but i\ndon't feel any sense of relief until i\nknow she's\nhome you know only because i don't know\nwhat she's going to experience at school\nespecially nowadays\nyou know i mean like these kids are\ngrowing up way different than we ever\ngrew up and then you\nsee stupid [ __ ] on the news like school\nshootings and you like man\nyou know like you start thinking the\nworst yeah at all times\nyou know and it's just like those are\nthe things that i'm afraid of\nyou know and even just when your your\nkids get older i remember somebody\nasking me the question one day somebody\nsaid\ni think jamil he'll ask me this jemele\nhill said are you uh\nwould you are you the kind are you the\ntype of man you would want your daughter\nto date or be with\nand i was like yeah probably me from 35\nto 40.\nanything before that hell no yeah you\nknow\nbut but that's honestly think about it\nthink about that question like\nif you got girls are you the type of man\nthat you would want\nyour daughter to date like stuff like\nthat is what will help you\ngo out there and get the healing you\nneed if the answer is no\nyou know what i'm saying if the answer\nis no then go out there and get that\nhealing you need take your ass to\ntherapy whatever it is you got to do\nto you know be the man that you would\nwant\nyeah your daughter to date so like i'm\nparanoid about all that stuff like\ncertain things that i've already\nembraced like i know one day my\ndaughter's gonna have sex\nyou know what i'm saying like and then\nshe's gonna get it it's gonna happen\nlike every woman that we love in our\nlife\nhas sex your mama your grandma you know\nyour sisters\nthat's gonna happen so it's just like\nthings like that i'm about to get a\npanic attack thinking about it but\nthat's just\nlike things like that is what you just\nhave to accept\nyeah you understand what i'm saying so\nit's just like you know\ni always got to remember my serenity\nprayer man and that's just god grant me\nserenity except the things i cannot\nchange courage to change the things i\ncan't in the wisdom to know the\ndifference because there's nothing i can\ndo and that's somebody else told me that\ntoo and that was like one of the most\nfreeing things\nto me they told me that you got to just\nlet go\nyeah like no matter how i can i can grab\nmy daughter like this and hold on to her\ntight\ni've been i gotta let go she's 10. my\nother daughter's gonna\nbe older than a minute too she's gonna\nbe in school like they got their own\nlives that they got to live their own\nlives that they got to lead\nthe only thing i can do is just guide\nthem along the way absolutely man\nabsolutely no you're spot on and and i\nthink that's\nlike you said that's a natural feeling\neveryone's gonna have i always had that\nwith my younger sister so i've got a\nyounger sister i always felt like\ni fathered her to some degree and there\nwas always that feeling in that pain of\nseeing her date or whatever it may be\nand you're right that's just something\nyou have to\naccept yes and there's a big part of\nacceptance needed\nbecause you can't control everything and\nthat's also liberating when you figure\nthat out\nthat not everything is for yours to\ncontrol absolutely and it's not for you\nto control\nthere is certain things to humanize\nyourself by and you realize oh actually\ni'm not that significant because i can't\ncontrol everything\nand i have to learn to accept certainty\nyeah i was gonna write a book i mean i\ndon't think i'm gonna go with this title\nanymore just because the energy of it\ndon't feel right but you know\nat one point i was gonna write a book\ncalled one day your daughter's gonna\nsuck dick and other things you have to\naccept as a father\nwell sure now what's he gonna change the\ntitle to i might not i just don't know\nthat that just feels a little\ntoo crash you know what i'm saying like\ni i know that sounds crazy coming from\nme but i'm not i'm i've i've\ni guess i've grown you know what i'm\nsaying i guess i've grown because at one\npoint i'm like yeah that's the time i\nlove that but then i was like\ni think it'd be a useful book though\nvery very useful but\nsometimes man you know you got to\npresent the message in the right package\nyou know sometimes\nyeah people will dismiss you and and\njust because of that title you know i\nmean which i think is whack i'm not that\nkind of person you know i'm the type\nperson if i see a book like\nthe subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] i'm\ngoing to read that book\nyou know what i mean i'm like oh that's\na dope type like that grabbed me but i\nknow i come from a different generation\ni come from a different culture\nyou know i was going to name my first\nbook i don't give a [ __ ] and neither\nshould you\na self-help guide on how not to give a\n[ __ ] and the book publishers was like no\nyou'll never get in the walmart you'll\nnever get in the target nobody'll buy a\nbook with [ __ ] the title yeah and\nthen here comes the federal artist not\ngiving a [ __ ] mark manson\nsold goddamn over 2 million copies and i\nremember sending that [ __ ] to\ni wrote about that book in my book cause\ni was talking about how\nyou know you sometimes you just gotta\nlisten to yourself yeah\nyou know like sometimes you're ahead of\nthe curve and other people have to just\ncatch up and that's just the way our\nsociety is especially when it comes to\ncreatives\nthat's why you got to let creatives just\nbe creative because they're already 10\nsteps ahead of you but you got all of\nthese\nsuits whether it's tv whether it's the\nfilm world whether it's\nbooks like you just got these suits that\nare old and stuck in their ways and\nbeing that they've\nthey've never seen it work before\nthey'll tell you\nit can't work yeah not knowing that you\nmight be the first\nthat changes the whole game totally\nnobody nobody wants to be game changers\nin yeah\nyeah absolutely you look at bohemian\nrhapsody and freddie mercury yes it's\nlike such a game changer and you look at\nanyone that we look up to or admire in\nthe world\nthey've been game changers they don't\nwrite books about people who are not\ngame changers you don't make movies\nabout people they're not game changers\nbut we've always been taught about how\ndo you trust other people we don't get\ntaught how to trust yourself\nyes right we get to how do you\ncommunicate with other people we never\nlearn how to communicate with ourselves\nyes and so if you never trust your own\nself\nyou're always looking for validation\nlike hey do you think this is a good\nidea hey sue do you think this is a good\nidea hey\ndo you think this is a good idea and\nthen that suit becomes your validation\nand your decision maker absolutely and\nthose are the most\nuncreative people in the world like i've\nnever been more confident in my life\nthan i am right now\nand i'm confident in the fact that i\ndon't know [ __ ] yeah and i'm comfortable\nwith that\nyou know and i'm confident in the fact\nthat i am\na person who truly loves this self and\nthe reason i truly love myself because\ni've done the work\nto truly love myself and it's easier for\nme and i guess that's why i get hurt a\nlot\nbecause i am a loving trusting\nperson because i'm at the point in my\nlife where i just\ni try to see the good in everybody you\nknow what i mean and\nand i don't expect you to [ __ ] me over\nthat's another lesson i've recently\nlearned yeah go for it man\ni used to i i still believe in the law\nof attraction meaning that your thoughts\nbecome things\nbut um i don't necessarily think i\nbelieve in\nenergy as far as like whatever you put\nout you get back\nbecause it will always be somebody else\nout there\nwho's having a [ __ ] up day who will\nruin yours because you gotta think uh\nall we're trying to do every day is\navoid crazy yeah yeah\nwe're just trying to stay out of the way\nof negativity crazy evil but guess what\nsometimes there's people out there who\nare hurt\nand they haven't done the work on\nthemselves and they haven't you know\ngotten to that place where they're\ntrying to do any healing\nand so hurt people hurt people and\nsometimes we run into those people yeah\nand it has nothing to do with anything\nthat we did\nwe just happened to run into you know\nsome of that negativity that day\nyeah so so that's just that's just\nsomething i've been thinking about so\nit's just like you just gotta\nyou gotta do you gotta put that kind of\nenergy out there just because you like\nputting that kind of energy out there\nnot because you're putting that kind of\nenergy out there because you want to get\nit back to get it back yeah absolutely\nand i've realized actually that when you\nput out good\nit does come back to you just not in the\nsame place as you put it yes\nright like it will that energy will\ntransfer back\nbut not in the same place as you put it\nso just because you put good energy into\nwork\ndoesn't mean good energy is going to\ncome back to you through work just keep\na good energy into this person\nit doesn't mean this person is going to\ngive you good energy back and that's our\nexpectation is that we think like if i'm\nnice to this person they'll be nice to\nme\nand that's not going to work like that\nno be nice to that person because you\nwant to be nice to that person\nand put a period on yeah absolutely i\nlove that man and i one thing you\nmentioned earlier that i want to dive\ninto now which is more about\nyour understanding of culture and where\nyou see it going and\nyou spot it you said that i grew up\nlistening to the wrong type of music\nor there was music that you think\ncreated an environment and pushed you\ndown the line you even said when you\nwere thinking about people that looked\nlike you there were certain things\nyeah yeah let's let's talk a bit about\nhow much you think music\nthrough all of its you know whether it's\nbad language whether it's idolizing\ngoing to prison whether it's idolizing\nguns and gangs whether it's demeaning\nwomen or men\neven like where are your thoughts on\nthat and and how do you think that needs\nto evolve or do you think it does at all\nnot i think it i think it has evolved\nokay no i mean i grew up in the 90s\nso i grew up in the era of kingston rap\nmusic so it was\nit was all about you know the\ncelebration of violence it was all about\nthe glorification of the gang culture\nthe glorification of the drug culture\nand the extreme disrespect of women\nyou know i mean you talking about you\nknow whether it was\namg [ __ ] better have my money a snoop\ndogg [ __ ] ain't [ __ ] but hoes and\ntricks you know what i'm saying\nuh nwa i teach you how to suck a dick\nlike you know i remember cameron said\nyou know [ __ ] think to\nuh what do you say [ __ ] think to reach\na [ __ ] you gotta\nsay oh yeah [ __ ] think to reach a [ __ ]\nyou gotta treat a [ __ ] nice through my\n[ __ ] gotta beat a [ __ ]\nthat's like reach a [ __ ] who thinks she\nall that whipper one time ten minutes\nshe'll come back like all of these like\nlike that's what we were constantly\nlistening to all the time and when you\ngo back and you look at like\nsee dolores tucker and al sharpton and\nall of these people who were saying yo\nthis music is\nmessed up it's ruining our kids like you\nknow\nrappers y'all need to do better record\nlabels need to stop pushing this [ __ ]\nwe rebelled against that you know you\nknow what you know what we said to see\ndolores talking what\nshut up [ __ ] you know what i'm saying\nlike like god bless the dead that's what\nwe did we rebelled against that\nbut she was right you know and so it's\nlike a whole generation of\nof of us was affected and influenced\nby that kind of rhetoric and you know i\ndon't think that it's\nuntil you get older and you start having\ndaughters of your own uh you know that's\nwhy i think the me too time's up\nmovement is so good because the me two\ntimes up movement is\nit's like a like like a day of reckoning\nyou know and it's making a lot of people\nyou know look in the mirror and and\nthe culture has shifted and you know\neither you evolve or\ndie you know and that's something i saw\nlike four years ago you know before\nthere was a me two times a movement like\nuh\nlike i said i don't know if it was my\ndaughter uh like my wife checking me\nyou know because i was really on some\nhip-hop\nhoward stern [ __ ] like like that all\nthat got to my head\nyou know when they was calling me the\nhip-hop howard stern and the black\nhoward stern\nand you know when i grew up listening to\nhoward like howard was\non some frat boy you know rapey\nboy borderline rapey culture not even\nborderline rape rape culture\nand so it's for like for me i'm like\nokay that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna\nbe\nshocking i'm gonna say the most\ncreepiest things the women in interviews\nyou know i'm gonna bring pawn stars in\nhere and\ntie them up i'm gonna do like all of\nthat kind of stuff and that\nhas been the most low energy content\nthat i've put not put out there if you\nask me you know like when i'm having\nconversations with people anybody\nbringing that up to me and nobody's\nsaying y'all\nyou did this you did that they talking\nabout the more high level stuff that\ni've put in out there in the past few\nfew years that has really influenced\npeople so it's just like\ni was doing all that for nothing you\nknow if anything all i did was come back\nand\nbite me in the ass later on in life\nbecause when they start\ndigging up old tweets and listening to\nlistening to old commentary\nthey're like look i'm like man i'm not\neven\nremotely that guy anymore like that's\neight nine years ago like i'm\ni'm over here with it but you got to\ndeal with\nthat because that's part of me too i put\nthat out there\nyou know so for me it's just like i just\nsaw i was just reading howard stern's\nnew book\nhow stern got this his whole\nintroduction is literally about that\nhis whole introduction is about how he\ndoesn't consider\nanything he did back then good well he\nwas like that [ __ ] is\ncheap it was it was it was whack it was\ndisgusting\nand he was and and this is a guy he\ndon't you don't got to answer that\nnobody\nno you don't have to admit that you know\nhe was just like that's not\nwho i am anymore he said he said he said\nthis book this book that he put out is\nhis legacy book he was like\nthis is what i want to be remembered and\ni want these long-form interviews to\nbe what people remember me for and so\nit's like\nit's the same thing with me like you\nknow you grow up a certain way like i\nremember having a i remember having a\nconversation with my father\nwhen he was cheating on my mom and i'm\nlike oh you cheating on mom yada yada\nyada i remember him looking at me and\nlaughing\nand saying oh you only got one girl huh\nand then yeah one day you'll understand\nso in my mind from that point i'm\nthinking so i'm not supposed to have one\ngirl\nsupposed to have a bunch of different\ngirls and then you know you also realize\nthat a lot of that is just ego\nyou know men men i said all the time men\nonly sleep around with a bunch of\ndifferent women to feed their ego\nthey're looking for\nsome sort of validation you know what\ni'm saying like their cup is empty\nso they're trying to fill their cup up\nand they keep wondering why i could\nsleep with 10 different women and my\ncups still don't feel full because it's\na hole at the bottom of your cup like\nyou need a whole new cup brother\nyou know so it's just like for me\nall of these things i'm talking about\ncreated just\nuh a culture shift and created a\nspiritual awakening in me like i can't\npinpoint one specific thing that made me\nsay you know what\ni got to be a better human being i got\nto be a better man because i was\ni was on this journey four years ago\nfour or five years ago that was just\nfrom listening to my\nfriends and listening to women around me\nwho\nwho cared about me and and was telling\nme what i was doing wrong\nyou know and you know even even some of\nsocial media not all of it because it's\nnot constructive but some\na lot of it can be constructive\ncriticism because you start seeing\nthings and you like\nam am i that way do i really act like\nthat do i really move like that and then\nyou take a step outside of yourself\nyou put your ego down you like oh i see\nwhat they say\nyeah yeah and i love hearing that man\nbecause i think\njust the fact that you can get that open\nin front of a mirror\nand be okay with the fact and what\nyou've just said about how it's turned\ngetting okay with the fact that you\ndon't need to tell anyone you've changed\nyou don't oh you don't feel like you owe\nanyone anything you've done your thing\nbut to be able to go out and just say\ni got it wrong i messed up that was a\nwaste of time\ni think it's amazing that we live in a\nworld where we have people doing that\nbecause it's so easy to continue playing\nthe facade and faking it the whole way\nand pretending like it never happened\nyeah you can grow and just pretend like\nit never happened\nyeah i mean that's i mean listen i i\nwould never\ngrow and pretend it never happened only\nbecause\nall my favorite stories growing up were\nthe stories of people's growth and\nevolution yeah absolutely\nyou know i love the autobiography of\nmalcolm x and i say it all the time this\ngeneration wouldn't let malcolm\nlittle become malcolm x you know i i\nlove\ni i was talking about kim kardashian\nearlier today i'm like\nman i don't give a [ __ ] how kim\nkardashian korea started\nkim kardashian is out here getting\npeople free from prison she's become\nthis you know criminal justice reform\nactivists you know this prison reform\nactivist and she's using her privilege\nand she's using her money and she's\nusing her\nfame to get people free from prison who\nsaw that coming\nabsolutely yeah it's great i got to work\nright over there on 34th street on park\navenue wbls when i was one of these\nco-hosts i used to watch\nkim and courtney come hang out with my\nhomegirl nicole spence she was wendy's\nbooker like they used to come and just\nhang out in nicole's office trying to\nget an interview from wendy when she was\nlike organizing paris hilton's closets\nand one day\nwhen he was like all right come in and\nshe came in and then\nyou know when when when the sex tape\nhappened she came back to talk to wendy\nexclusively and i\nsaw i remember when kim ran through the\nwhole urban circuit smooth magazine king\nmagazine\nwas out there kicking it with the\nrappers dating the rapper was video\nvixen then\nshe grew a reality tv star and now she's\na\nwife and a mother and she's just one of\nthe biggest brands on the planet\nand she's getting people released from\nprison like\nyou don't know what somebody's ultimate\njourney is going to be you don't know\nwho we really don't we really have no\nidea who's going to change the world\nyou can't ever tell you can't ever look\nat a person and say oh yeah that's going\nto happen\nyou really don't know sometimes it comes\nfrom the most unlikely\nplaces who would have thought a pimp\nfrom harlem\nwould have ended up being one of the\ngreatest activists\nleaders the world has ever seen you\ndon't you you really don't know\nyou know look at jay-z drug dealer from\nbrooklyn mossy\nnow look what he's doing with the reform\nalliance and you know\nand and telling everybody to embrace\nblack ownership and black\nentrepreneurship something that he's\nbeen doing from the beginning honestly\nhe's been\nhe's been on his black ownership tip\nsince the beginning but you're looking\nat this man and you're saying man this\nman is really\nevolving into the leader of the free\nworld he said that one time i remember\none\non on i think was on ignorant [ __ ] he\nwas like\nthe next leo no more like the leader the\nnext\nleader of the free world or something\nlike that and i'm like that's really\nwhat he's\nevolving into this is the guy who made\nbig pimping\nthis is that that's not that's not a\nmore misogynistic video in the world but\nnow this guy's\nmad to one of the most beautiful women\nin the world and\nbeautiful kids and like he's telling\npeople about therapy and\nman it's like that's a beautiful time\nman but i'm saying all that to say\nyou just don't know who's going to be\nwho you just got to let people grow you\ngot to let people evolve you got to let\npeople make their mistakes\nyeah you know we're all works in\nprogress i don't know what i'm gonna be\n10 years from now\nyeah i have no idea and guess what i'm\nfine with that\n10 years ago you asked me i'm gonna be\n10 years from now i'd had a whole list\nof things lined up for you i'm gonna be\nthis\nand guess what it's all true yeah you\nknow but\nyou tell me what i want to do on a\nprofessional level yeah i can tell you\nsome things i want to do on a\nprofessional level\non a personal level i just want to\ncontinue to grow yeah i want to continue\nto heal\ni want to be the best i i can be\nmentally i want to be the best i can be\nspiritually i want to be the best i can\nbe emotionally that's what i want to do\non a personal level the personal growth\nis more important to me than the\nprofessional growth at this point i love\nthat what a powerful message man\nthat's just i love it i'm just listening\nand going this is exactly what the world\nneeds to hear right now because\nwe need to let people grow like we need\nto let people evolve we need to let\npeople change their story\nand write another chapter because the\nchallenge is we want them to stay in\ntheir chapter we want people to\nstay in their lane we want people to\nstay in their box and not give them an\nopportunity to become something else\nbecause we're like oh we know what you\ndid we know what you did before but we\nneed to let them grow well you know what\nthey say they say when you\nwhen you can't stop somebody uh from\nfrom from\nfrom who from being who they are you\nkeep trying to bring up who they used to\nbe yeah absolutely\nyou know and then oh i talk about how\nimagine 15 years ago\nyou were driving down a highway and the\nspeed limit on the highway was 70 miles\nper hour\nso you would do 70. sometimes you do\n75.80 because you know you can get away\nwith it you know\nbut then 15 years later they've reduced\nthe speed limit on that highway to 55\nwhy because 70 was too fast it was too\nmany accidents happening\ntoo many fatalities you know people were\njust really getting hurt so it was safer\nfor people\nto be doing 55 miles per hour okay boom\nspeed limit gets reduced to 55\n15 years later you're grown you're\nevolved you get it you're driving 55.\nsometimes you might do 60. because you\nknow that's what you can get away with\nyeah but imagine\nyou go home and then all of a sudden you\nstart getting tickets in your mailbox\nbecause you was doing 70 15 years ago\non this highway that is now a 55 it's\nlike\ni was doing what i was allowed\nto do at the time that's the information\ni was presented\nthey told me 70 was the speed limit i\ncould do so that's what i was doing\nnow that i found out that the speed\nlimit isn't you know\nuh conducive to me living a healthy\nlifestyle\nor anybody on that highway living a\nhealthy lifestyle i'm gonna drive the\nspeed limit because i want all of us to\nlive\nand on on this journey called life i\nwant all of us to be peaceful on this\njourney called life i want all of us to\nlive\nsafe on this highway called life\nabsolutely man this has been such an\namazing conversation and\nevery podcast we finished with the final\nfive so these are final five rapid fire\nquestions you can answer in one word\nokay three words or one sentence maximum\nokay right easy for you you're a\nlyricist you're a rapper so\nthis is part of part of the play so\nfinal five first question what do you\nthink is the greatest hip-hop album of\nall time\nonly built for cuban links by rayquan\nthe chef oh nice okay it's question two\nif you could change one thing about\nhumanity what would it be\ni would want everybody to love\nokay nice question three what's the best\nadvice you've ever received\nbest advice i've ever received um hmm\ntake your time\nhonestly man i'd have to give that\ncredit to my father\nwhen he told me that if you don't change\nyour your lifestyle you're gonna end up\nin jail dead or broke sitting under the\ntree and then\nthe reason i got to credit that to him\nbecause what he was telling me back then\nis you have to grow you have to evolve\nand that is something that even though i\ndon't i don't have no\nthreat of jail i mean we all have a\nthreat of death you know\nbut i i don't i don't have any threat of\nbeing broke sitting under the tree\nit's just that at every point in your\nlife it's gonna\nbe it's gonna call for a new you and\nit's gonna call for\nyou to grow and it's gonna call for you\nto evolve and if you don't evolve\nyou will die absolutely man question\nfour what's the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\nworst advice i ever received was\n[ __ ] that you're going to be a real\n[ __ ] for the rest of your life\nyou know like this that's just\nstupid you know because because there's\nso many of us i've seen so many people\nfall victim\nto just stuck on that one mindset like\nthey just had to\nstay in tune with the hood and they just\nso much so that they would still hang\nout in the hood like i've had homeboys\nwho got scholarships to go to college\nbut they just\nwanted to come home all the time just to\nhang out in the trap you know what i\nmean and that's exactly what happened\nthey ended up\ntrapped in our hometown you know they\nended up\nyou know they ended up just not\nevolving the way that they probably\nwould have if they would have\nstayed in school and stayed in college\nand actually took advantage of the\nscholarships and stuff that they were\npresented so\nit's just like yeah like you know just\nkeeping it keeping it real and the\ncliche that's the worst advice i ever\ngot the worst advice i ever got was\nkeeping it real\nyeah but keeping it real and the cliche\nterm that the streets give you\nwhich is actually keeping it criminal\nyou know keeping you locked yes cause\nkeeping it real is\nwhat i feel like i'm doing now i'm like\ni don't know nothing i mean\ni'm going to therapy you know what i'm\nsaying i'm afraid of being a terrible\nfather being a terrible\nhusband so yeah that's i feel like i'm\nmore real than i ever been\nnice man question five what's the one\nthing you're trying to learn this year\ni'm actually trying to unlearn more than\ni'm trying to learn i don't think i'm\nreally\ntrying to learn anything i'm just still\nunlearning a lot of a lot of things i\nfeel like unlearning is learning at\nleast for me\nyou know so it's just like i'm still\njust peeling back a lot of layers\nof of of of bs and a lot of layers of\nnonsense and i'm just\ni'm just really just trying to learn how\nto how to love more\ni know that sounds so cliche but it's\nthe truth man like i promise you like\nif we all just first of all i got to\nstart with you your first last and best\nlove is self-love\nif you love yourself it will be so easy\nfor you to love others and you know i\nstarted thinking about this a lot\nwhen the nipsey hustle situation\nhappened god bless the dead\nbecause i never in my life\nfelt empathy for\nboth parties in a situation like that\nyou know\ni knew nipsy you know and if she was a\ngreat brother you know me and if she\nused to\nshare books and stuff like that he was\nlike he's a good man\nyou know and\nof course i was gonna have empathy for\nhim of course i was gonna have empathy\nfor his family\nbut when i heard what happened and then\nmy my home girl\nlisa sent me the goddamn video and i\ndon't watch stuff like that but i didn't\nknow what it was so i clicked on it and\nwatched it\nand i didn't think i was gonna have\nempathy for the guy who\nactually shot nipsey but i did\nand that was a strange feeling for me\nand the reason i had empathy is because\ni understand that\nthat brother was in some type of pain\nhurt people\nhurt people and if we don't start\nhealing each other to deal with that\nhurt all we're going to do is\nredistribute that pain\nto other people and that's what happened\nthat day that was a redistribution of\npain so\nnipsey was a loving brother he was a\nbrother that put out good energy\nit didn't matter it goes back to what i\nsaid earlier sometimes you run into\nnegative people\nsometimes you run into evil people\nsometimes you run into people who\nhaven't healed at all\nand all they want to do is hurt you so\nit's just like\nwhen i saw that i just had a different\nfeeling\nof of empathy you know for and i never\nfelt that way before i never thought i\nwould feel that way about somebody\nlike him but it just really made me say\nman\ni just i just want to go on this just\nthis mission of like\njust helping brothers really really heal\nlike i've been out here talking about\nmental health and investing in your\nmental wealth but no\nlike i really really gotta go out here\nand help brothers\nheal you know i mean so we can stop\nhurting each other yeah absolutely man\nwhen you're when you're\nhurt you end up cutting people who\ndidn't make you bleed oh right powerful\nyeah that all the time when we're hurt\nwhen we're wounded we go and cut others\nyeah even though they didn't do anything\nto us we bleed on people who didn't call\nus yeah\nabsolutely man absolutely
