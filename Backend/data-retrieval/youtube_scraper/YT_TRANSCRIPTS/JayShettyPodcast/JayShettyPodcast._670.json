    "transcript": "the belief that in order to succeed you\nhave to burn out is incredibly\nentrenched in our culture\nit really goes back to the first\nindustrial revolution\nwhen we started revering machines\nand the goal of a machine is to minimize\ndowntime\nbut for the human operating system\ndowntime is a feature not a bad\nhey everyone thank you so much for\ncoming back to on\npurpose the number one health podcast in\nthe world i'm so\ngrateful that all of you are taking out\ntime to invest\nin your health and well-being you could\nbe anywhere in the world right now but\nyou're either listening to this or\nwatching this\nwhether you're walking your dog you're\ncommuting to or from work or maybe\nyou're at work maybe you're taking a\nbreak\nor maybe you're at the gym wherever you\nare thank you\nthank you so much for investing in your\neducation over entertainment but we're\ngonna make this really fun too\nand today's guest is someone i'm so\ngrateful\nand honored to be sitting next to this\nlady just to let you know she changed\nmy life three years ago so you can only\nimagine what an\nimportant moment this is for me but\nshe's someone who needs\nno introduction she's the founder of the\nhuffington post\nshe's the ceo and founder of thrive\nglobal\nand one of the most influential people\nin the media\nand world today her name is ariana\nhuffington\narianna thank you so much for doing this\nhonestly thank you jay\ni'm so happy to be here with you really\ni've been looking forward to it all week\ni'm so grateful honestly because we're\nsitting inside thrive global right now\nin new york\nthese are your brand new offices they're\nabsolutely beautiful thank you\nyour team is amazing as always and\nyou've opened this up as\nour home and made us feel so comfortable\nanytime\nso today i've got so many things i want\nto dive into i feel that you're\nthe thought leader the world really\nneeds today and i'm so grateful that\nyou've taken it upon yourself\nto make your mission to help people\nthrive all across the world\nand i want to go back to your book that\nyou called thrive\nit's a book that i believed when i read\nit i just felt i was like\ni can't believe someone's actually put\nthis all into words it was\ni connected so deeply with it and my big\nquestion which i want to start off with\nis today how can our listeners\nredefine success for themselves what\ndoes it mean to go through that\nprocess that you so beautifully outline\nbecause today we're bombarded by\nso many definitions of success how did\nyou start that process and how can our\nlisteners do that\nwell thank you for starting with the\nmost important question\nwhich was the question and i try to\naddress we thrive the book and that we\nare working on who thrive the company\nand basically you know you and i love\nreading philosophy whether it's the\ngreeks the vedas\nstoic philosophers and the bottom line\nis that what is the good life\nis a constant priority for philosophers\ntrying to define the good life what\nhappened\nin our modern culture is that we shrunk\ndown the definition of the good life\nto success and we shrunk the definition\nof success\ndown to two metrics money and start to\nslash\npower and that's like trying to sit on a\ntwo-legged stool\nsooner or later you fall off yes so what\nwe're\ntrying to teach here at thrive and what\ni'd love everybody listening and\nwatching\nto take home is to redefine\nsuccess to include a third metric\nnothing wrong with the first two\nbut the third is what completes our\npurpose\nand it includes well-being you know\nprioritizing our health and well-being\nwisdom i love your mission of making\nwisdom viral\nwonder you know a sense of wonder about\nthe universe the mystery of life\nand giving giving back that's something\nthat you\nchronicle so often um in your work\nso for me that's what's a complete life\nand so\nanytime you integrate\nany of these into your daily life\nyou're getting closer to a fuller\ndefinition of the good life\nyeah i love that i absolutely love that\nand i think that's\nso clear and it's such a great direction\nfor people because we can almost look at\nthem and be like okay where am i\nstruggling\nyes right so we can look at that and say\nokay which which which leg of that stool\nis missing in my life\nand it becomes a focus area now when i\ndo see that though sometimes some people\nmay\nthink well that's a lot of things to\njuggle\nand maybe i'm working really hard and\ni'm really ambitious\nand that means i'm sacrificing sleep and\nmy health is falling apart\nhow have you found or what are your\nbeliefs around\nreal balance in the striving for making\nan\nimpact in the striving for wanting to\nmake a difference\nhow do we also take care of all of those\njuggling balls it feels like there's a\nlot\nthere is a lot and i think the only way\nis through microsteps at thrive we talk\nabout\nsmall daily incremental steps\nthat are not hard\nwe just need to make sure we take\none step at a time so whatever it is you\nwant to focus on\nand let's say you want to focus on\nimproving your sleep\nbecause you have actually read the\nscience and the data and you\nknow that when you improve your sleep\nyou actually improve your performance\nso even if you didn't care about your\nhealth and you just care about your\nperformance just look at\nelite athletes there's no way tom brady\nwould go to a super bowl sleep deprived\nyeah\nbecause he knows if he wants big\nperformance he needs to get enough sleep\neat right have recovery time as well as\ntraining time so\nthat's really what i've forgotten so let\nme give you one of my favorite sleep\nmicro steps we have over 700 but i love\nthe fact that you are focusing\non making a conversation actionable for\npeople\nso my macro step my favorite microstep\nis speaker time\nat the end of your day that you actually\ndeclare\nthe end of your working day because the\ntruth is that there is no end to our\nworking day\nthe truth is that we could all spend the\nwhole night\nclearing our inboxes so catching up with\nwork\nin our always own world so you have to\ndeclare\nan arbitrary end and because human\nbeings learn through ritual you mark\nthat end\nby turning off your phone and gently\nescorting it out of your bedroom\ni love that it's small but\nkey you know not sleeping with your\nphone are you sleeping with you no i\ndon't sleep with my phone\namazing it's absolutely essential\nbecause if you sleep with your phone\nif you wake up in the middle of the\nnight\nand you can't go right back to sleep you\nare going to be tempted to pick it up\nand scroll through instagram or answer\nsome text\nand it's much harder to go to sleep and\nhave a deep\nreally recharging sleep absolutely yeah\nwhen i first trained myself to do that\ni used to lock all my devices in my car\noutside so i used to literally go and\nput my phone my laptop everything\nbecause i wanted to train myself\nyes out of the habit and i remember\ngetting a real alarm clock at that time\nso that i could still wake up if you\nneed an alarm clock and now i've been\nable to train myself to wake up after\neight and a half hours of sleep a day\nso no matter what time i go to sleep\nusually it's the same time i always\nsleep eight and a half hours and i don't\nneed an alarm to get up\nso i get up naturally my body wakes me\nup and that's been such a beautiful\nconditioning and it's taken me time\nbut it really helps because now you're\nno longer conditioned to\nwake up to anything you can wake up\nexactly i think this is a\nthis is amazing what you just said at\nfirst it may be hard because we are\nbreaking addictions\n100 but then the reward of how we feel\nis so enormous i mean for me now it's\nlike the reward of feeling fully\nrecharged\nis so great i don't really like myself\nwhen i'm sleep deprived i mean i'm more\nreactive i'm more emotional\ni'm less empathetic i'm less creative i\ndon't really want to be around me\nso it's actually something that then\nbecomes a magnet\nto continue doing that are there any\nother habits that you've had to rewire\nin your life\nanything that you saw as a trigger and\nyou started building steps micro steps i\nlove\nthat to building were there any others\nyes like\num i used to be one of the people who\nwould think\ncome january 1st i'm going to start\nworking out for it\nnow every day and then by february 1st i\nwould drop it\nso instead i put a stationary bike in my\nbedroom\nand now every morning i do a\n30 minutes on my bike and i can be on my\nemail\nbecause it's okay you know it's a\nstationary bike so i feel productive\nand you know when i want to go harder\ni'll just do it without going on my\nemail\nbut yeah i made it super simple and now\nhonestly i just like get out of bed\nand i get on my bike it's become like\nsecond nature it's no longer\nan issue because as you know because\nyou're a student of behavioral science\nand discipline is not going to cut it\nwe need to change our environment and\nmake it super easy to make these micro\nsteps\nyes and having the bike right there my\ntennis shoes right there makes it much\neasier\nyeah absolutely you're breaking that\nchain in your mind to avoid that i had\none client that i used to coach\na very successful executive and she\nloved doing yoga but she could never\nmake it so we made sure that she had her\nyoga mat next to her bed so she could\nliterally roll off her bed and onto her\nyoga mat\nand just be like a reminder that it was\nright there she didn't have to go to a\ngym\nor she didn't have to go somewhere else\nshe could do yoga right next to her bed\nif that's what exactly just something to\nbreak the chain yeah i love that that's\ngreat\nand i think it's i'm sure you hear this\nall the time with thrive global yourself\nyou're working with\nathletes celebrities executives\ndirectors you're working with the\nbusiest people on the planet\nright that's that's what you do every\nday and you know that and you've you are\none of the busiest people on the planet\ntoo\nand i'm sure you get people asking you\niran i'm so\nfearful of falling behind yes\ni'm so scared that someone important\nwill send me a message and i'll miss it\nor something will happen in the news and\ni didn't see the notification\nhow are you advising people who have\nthat fear or insecurity that they may\nfall behind\nso that's where changing beliefs is key\nso in all our workshops with\ncorporations\nwe start with changing beliefs because\nthe beliefs we have\nare really like the automatic pilot on a\nship you know\nand what we tell ourselves we're going\nto do or\nis like the captain uh steering the ship\nin one way or another but if the\nautomatic pilot\nis set in a particular direction that's\nwhere the ship is going to go\nso we start by changing beliefs because\nthe belief that in order to succeed you\nhave to burn\nout is incredibly entrenched in our\nculture\nit really goes back to the first\nindustrial revolution\nwhen we started revering machines\nand the goal of a machine is to minimize\ndowntime\nthe goal of software is to minimize\ndowntime\nbut for the human operating system\ndowntime\nis a feature not a bug\nand so we need to show people the data\nshow people the science\nintroduce people to ancient wisdom you\nknow we've done a wonderful series i\ndon't know if you've seen they'll send\nit to you on chinese ancient wisdom\nwe are doing a lot on indian wisdom on\nstoic philosophers our\nconference room here all our conference\nrooms are named after\num philosophers like the marcus aurelius\nroom oh i love that\nis our a board room so\nthe reason for all that is that\nit requires both science and\nstorytelling\nto move people but we have found that\nthe thing that\nmoves people more than anything is\nhearing from successful people in the\narena\nyes it's what you said it's like it's\nalmost like people need to be given\npermission\nand need to hear from people who are\nsuccessful\nwho are not chilling under a mango tree\nso when jeff bezos writes a piece and\nsays why am i getting eight hours of\nsleep is good for amazon shareholders\nthat piece went crazy viral\nand it made a lot of people feel if jeff\nbezos gets eight hours of sleep\nand he's not exactly slowing down\nthat shows that there is something here\nfor me to look at\nor um philip schindler the chief\nbusiness officer at google\nand said to me at a dinner that he had\nthis moment of epiphany\nwhen he came home from a trip\nand his young children he told his\nchildren that is taking you to the\nplayground\nand his five-year-old son said oh no\ncan't the babysitter take us\nand he asked why and the little boy said\nbecause\nwhen you're in the playground you're\nalways on your phone\nand that was his moment of epiphany and\nafter that he stopped\nbeing on his phone when he's with his\nchildren\nyou know he travels a lot it's not like\nwith his with his children all the time\nso he made that sacred time and then he\ntexted me to let me know what an amazing\nimpact it had\nwithin google so people who felt\nthat they could also do that\nthat they could take that step without\nbeing afraid that they are going to fall\nbehind\nabsolutely absolutely and i think you're\nso right that that science story\ntelling and that last piece of people\nliving the example yes\nis the most powerful because when we see\nsomeone who looks like us\ntalks like us walks like us has the same\ndiary as us\nand they can do it and and it's funny\nisn't it that we get impressed i was i\nwas at a\nhangout the other day and i was with a\nlot of other social media people and\nwe were all hanging out together and no\none used their phone for about three\nhours\nwow because we were all just connecting\nas human beings and everyone was\nyou know there are a few people there\nthey were so impressed they were like\nhow are you guys not on your phones and\ni was just like because\ni love this like i love being on a plane\ni pretend that planes still don't have\nwi-fi\nlike i just convinced myself that wi-fi\ndoesn't exist on planes\nbecause i love being able to switch off\nlike what you're saying that it's not a\nbug\nit's a feature yeah it's a feature i\nlove that that's so powerful that\nwhen we feel and that's our problem\nright like we think when we're slowing\ndown we're like oh god why am i slowing\ndown\ni need to you know we panic we go oh no\ni'm becoming less productive\nbut actually that's a feature reminding\nus\nto press pause to slow down to to reach\nthen\nwe can actually observe why and how we\nbecome more productive\num you know why do people say that they\nget their best ideas in the shower yeah\nit's the truth is that our best ideas\ncome from the wisdom within\nand that's why when you talk about\nmaking wisdom go viral\nthat's also part of what allows people\nto connect with\ntheir own inner wisdom and their best\nideas come from that absolutely let's\ntalk about inner wisdom\na bit because i think we both believe in\nit very strongly\ni know that in my life i feel i've\nalways been guided by my inner wisdom\nyes i rarely feel guided by my head i\nreally try and feel guided by the market\nor the industry i'm constantly looking\nto my inner compass\nto be guided i'd love to hear from you\nhow you've done that in your life\nand how you've been able to sift out\nyour inner voice from the noise that\noften\narises from everything around us so for\nme\nthat's kind of the heart of everything\ni'm doing and that we are doing a thrive\nwhich is\nthe truth and that i believe is an\nabsolute truth\nthat every one of us has a place of\nwisdom peace and strength inside\nus it's our birthright\nno matter what we do or where we are or\nwhere\nwe are born we do have that\nand most of the time we are completely\ndisconnected from it\nand that's such a shame it's like having\nbeen given this\nincredible inheritance and not even\nknowing that you have it\nand that's why i love when dick nadhan\nsaid that right now\nwith our addiction to our phones and\nsocial media and games\nhe said it has never been easier to run\naway from ourselves\nand so everything we are doing here is\nhelping people reconnect with that place\nnow there is nobody i know who lives in\nthat place all the time\nof course it's not that's not what we're\nsaying what we want to create is a great\ncourse correcting mechanism\nso that we know i kind of know and i'm\nsure you know when i'm not in that place\nand so the first thing i want to do\nis help myself get back to that place\nwhatever it takes\nbecause from that place i'm so much more\nproductive so much more creative and\nso much more joyful you know we don't\ntalk enough about joy\nbut after all the purpose of life is not\njust to be productive\nyeah definitely no this is not a dress\nrehearsal\nabsolutely so if we can\nalso connect with our joy and our loving\nand suddenly life\num becomes kind of like a little miracle\nyeah absolutely what is what are a few\nthings people can do every day to\nto get that voice back for themselves\nlike you said i think so many of us\nhave run so far away from ourselves like\ntikna ham mentioned you quoted\nthat we don't even know what ourselves\nis anything yes\nright like it's like well what is it\nlike i have 10 voices in my head\nand one of them is a tv show and one of\nthem's my favorite song and\none of them is my mom's voice and my\ndad's voice like what are\na couple of things that people can do on\na daily basis that's going to help them\nget closer to that voice again\nwell i believe and i know you do too\nthat one of the keys is gratitude\nthat doesn't mean not acknowledging the\npain\nbecause the pain is often real you know\nthere's a lot of pain in the world and\nin our lives\nbut also recognizing that\nthe pain is not everything the hardship\nis not everything the darkness is not\neverything\nand being able to hold and when we are\ngoing through a hard time\nthese two realities in our hearts\nas well as our heads at the same time\nyes\nthat for me is the key and so\ndoing again microsteps like starting\nyour morning\num taking one minute in the morning\none minute to remember three things\nyou're grateful for\nor set your intention for the day\nis absolutely key if you don't have one\nminute\nyou don't have a life and the majority\nof people\ngo directly to their phone first thing\nin the morning\nand you don't know what you're going to\nsee yeah no not at all\nand so suddenly the cortisol hormone the\nstress hormone floods your body\nbefore you have even gotten out of bed\nso how you start your day is absolutely\nkey\nyeah and so is how you end your day yeah\nbecause\nevery day is a mixture of good things\nand bad things happening\nyou know i've never had a day which was\nall amazing\nno well maybe one or two but you know\nyeah it's not the norm\nof course so you can go to bed\nthinking of all the things that went\nwrong\nor you can go to bed and thinking of all\nthe things you're grateful for\nyes yes and that changes the quality of\nyour sleep\nyes so what is interesting um jay as you\nknow\nis that in terms of our evolution\nour mind tends to go to the negative\nbecause that's how we survived right i\nmean if we were\num followed by a tiger and\nfocused on the sunset we would not be\nhere yes\nbut right now we continue to live in\nthis fight-or-flight mode\neven though there aren't a lot of tigers\naround i definitely know\nand that's what we need to change\nabsolutely and and i love what you're\nsaying because actually i think\nwhen i lived as a monk for three years\none of the\nbiggest principles we talked a lot about\nwas how when we are asked to be grateful\nfor something\nwe only remember the positive whereas\nactually\na lot of the times when we've been in\nour greatest pain\nthat's been the greatest path to our\npotential yes that actually\nthe pain the suffering the tragedy the\nthe falling down was actually the moment\nof our rise and growth\nand and i've noticed that when i look in\nreflection in gratitude\nor i look in hindsight it's actually the\nlowest point of my life that became the\nbirth of the best moments of my life\nand it's so easy to forget that but now\nand so now when i'm going through\npainful moments\ni'm always saying to myself don't judge\nthis moment as painful\ndon't judge the moment because this\ncould be the moment that leads to\nthe next best thing that happens to you\nand so becoming grateful\nin that pain too absolutely i completely\nagree with that it's like the leonard\ncoyne song\nyou know that the light comes in through\nthe crowd yes\nyes exactly yes and i um\ni know that from my life you know when i\nlook back\ni remember one of the most painful\nmoments in my life was when\ni was very much in love with this\nbrilliant writer\nin london and um\nwe were together for seven years uh\nby now i was 30 and i really really\nwanted to have children\nand he was clear he didn't want to have\nchildren he only wanted to have cats\nand so i had to make this tough decision\ni could stay with him but then i\nwouldn't have children\nor if i wanted to fulfill that dream i\nwould have to leave him\nand it was an incredible moment of\nheartbreak i really left london and\nmoved to new york to put the kind of\n[Music]\nthe ocean behind us and yet when i look\nback now\nthat one thing changed my life so what\nwas like the hardest moment at the time\nbecame the moment that allowed me to\nmove here have my children\nbuild the huffington post lunch thrive\nbe here with you and it all happened\nbecause a man wouldn't marry me\nyeah it's crazy so i say we all need to\nlook back and\nand and look at all the things that were\nterrible heartbreaks and what did they\nlead to\nyes absolutely mine mine i don't think\nyou know this mind funnily enough was\ni obviously moved to new york to work\nwith huffpost when we were together\nand then you left to start thrive and i\nleft half post at the same time and that\nwas one of the toughest periods in my\nlife\nbecause i had all these views and things\nwere growing online\nbut i no longer had my sponsor in you of\nsomeone who\ngreatly believed in my work and at that\ntime\ni really had to be the person who\nbelieved in myself and build my own\nworld\nand so i went through one of the\ntoughest periods of my life because\ni went from having someone who believed\nin my work someone incredible\ninfluential like yourself to having no\none to then having to do it myself\nand it was the best thing that happened\nto me and that was only two years ago\nand now yeah and it was just it was just\none of those moments that i'm so\ngrateful for because otherwise\ni would have carried on doing what i was\ndoing and it would have been nice it\nwould have been okay there would have\nbeen nothing bad about it\nbut it launched it gave me a launch pad\nto a new life\nand so i'm i'm very grateful that you\nstarted thrive global for many reasons\nbut also for the reason because it\nallowed me to be born myself again\ni love that and i think we all should be\ndoing\nmore to tell the stories of these\nheartbreaks\nand what they led to yes because nobody\nwho has succeeded\nhas had like a linear path where\neverything went great\nabsolutely absolutely and i'm really\nglad you brought up having children\nbecause that was actually my next topic\nso i wanted to talk to you about that\nand\ni so i have this thing i talk about\nmaking wisdom go viral\ni talk a lot about wisdom my three areas\nare self love and work\nthose are my three areas which i believe\ni have some insight on or i've loved and\ndeeply want to help people with\nnow there's one area of my life that i\nhave no wisdom on and that's parenting\nright i'm no\ni'm not a parent yet i don't claim to\nhave any wisdom on parenting\nbut i have a lot of my audience in my\ncommunity that loves asking questions so\none of the biggest questions i get asked\nright now is\njay i feel a lot of mom guilt of\nworking on my passion building my\npassion but then having to be there for\nmy children and wanting to be there too\nand i hear that a lot i'm sure you've\nheard it for a long long time but i hear\nit a lot so i wanted to ask\nsomeone who and i've seen you with your\ndaughters you have a beautiful\nrelationship with them\nthey have a beautiful relationship with\nyou it's so real and genuine\nand at the same time you're someone who\nis continuing to innovate\ncontinuing to be a pioneer how have you\nnot mastered that because i know you\nwon't even say you've done that but how\nhave you managed that and how have you\ncontinued to live your passion build\nyour passion impact lives and maintain a\nreal bond with your children\nwell first of all um the mom guilt\nis kind of pretty much universal\nand i really feel sometimes that they\ntake the baby out and they put the guilt\nin\nthat's how universal it is and we've\njust launched a parenting\num workshop and it's going to be part of\na digital product\nthat helps women through microsteps\nand men too because men have it although\nnot to the same extent\nto recognize that\nif you follow your passion you're going\nto be a better parent\nbecause if if you think that by\nnot following your passion i mean first\nof all for\nmost people in the world it's not even a\nchoice because people\nwork they need to make a living but even\nlet's say\nthat was not the issue but this is\nsomething\nthat you love and um\nfulfills your purpose there's no way you\nwould be as good a parent\nif you didn't fulfill that\nand also i find that what matters most\nis when you are with your children to be\nfully there\ni think the worst thing that we do as\nparents is multitasking\nyes you need the idea that i'm with my\nchild i'm having\ndinner or i'm happy with their homework\nand i'm set up tissue looking at my\nphone yes\nthat's the thing that is that is really\npainful for the child i mean children\ntake this\nthis science um\nto heart but also\nbeing able to\nallow yourself to be fully present\nwhether it's with your child or\nat work and when the guilt comes\nrecognizing it's not the truth i call it\nit's the obnoxious roommate living in my\nhead\nyeah you know that voice of self-doubt\nquestioning\nthat doesn't allow us to be fully\npresent and\nand for me my my daughters know\nthat however busy they are they come\nfirst so if they need me\ni will drop anything to be with them\nthat's what really matters to children\nthat sense of\nunconditional loving yeah what i love\nabout\nwhat i'm hearing from you as a future\nfather is that\nwhen i have kids i really believe that\nbecause i'm getting to do what i love\nevery day and i'm passionate about it\ni'm going to have that energy cascade\nonto my children\nthey're going to experience my joy but\nif i was to give all this up and even if\ni was with them 24 7\ni'd probably drive them mad because i\nwouldn't have anything to give them like\nwhat am i going to offer them\nand so i love that and so even if you're\na parent out there and you're listening\nright now\nand it's not about changing your career\nor doing your passion it could just be\ndoing your hobby once a week\ntaking a mom's night once a week hanging\nout with your friends once a week\nwhatever you need to refuel\nyour kids are going to feel that energy\nthat's the key whatever you need to\nrefuel\nand because when we are not refueled and\nwe give\nfrom a place of being empty and depleted\nit's not real giving i mean we all have\nto do it and we all had to do it but\ngiving from our overflow is just amazing\nyeah absolutely giving from our overflow\nthat's exactly\nit and what if we're not overflowing\nthen we are just giving from our\nhalf fill cup yes or a quarter filled\ncup and that's what's\nup or an empty cup and that's why we're\nfeeling drained\nand dried up so what i really want to\nunderstand is how have you\nchanged what you do to refuel over the\nyears yes so from the moment when\nyou were building a company through to\nnow i want to know that because i also\nthink that\na lot of people's methods for refueling\nchange over time\nand we get scared when our methods\nchange\nso when you're in your teens you used to\ngo and party\nand when you're in your 30s i know or 40\nsome people are still trying to do the\nsame thing to refuel as they were and it\ndoesn't work the same way\nit doesn't feel the same so how have\nyours changed well that's part of being\nconnected with ourselves and getting the\nscience i mean\ni was blessed with an amazing mother um\nwho was very connected with her own\nwisdom and ancient wisdom and even\nthough she never went to college she was\nself-taught and she\ntaught my sister and me to meditate when\ni was 13.\nand i didn't do it consistently at the\nbeginning but it definitely was an\nincredible gift\nso i bought into the delusion that the\nonly way to\nsucceed is to be always on to sacrifice\nmy own health and well-being which is\nabsurd you know we claim to be\ndata-driven the data is so clear that's\nnot what works i mean\nlook at the founder myth over three\nquarters of startups fail\nso there's something wrong about the\nassumption that you have to be always on\nto succeed look at elon musk i mean he's\na brilliant visionary\nbut what he's doing by\nexhausting himself and tweeting in the\nmiddle of the night things that are not\ntrue about taking his company private\nleading to sec investigations having to\nstep down as chairman paying a 20\nmillion dollar fine\nhow can this be good for the company you\nare building so whatever it is\nthat we are all doing and\nfinding our own ways to refuel is key\nfor me\nthe foundation of my refuelling became\nsleep\ni even wrote a book as you know the\nsleep revolution\nwith all the latest science about\nwhy it is so essential because sleep is\nnot optional\nit's an incredibly active time for the\nbrain\nit's the only time when the brain can\nclean up all the accumulated\ntoxins from the day and it is essential\nto our health\nand to our cognitive performance so\nthat's my number one thing\nmy number two thing that we teach a lot\nhere\nis the recognition that it takes one\nminute\nto cause correct from stress it's not\nlike a long time but you need to do it\nany\nevery time you you feel you're stressed\nout so we are launching a behavior\nchange platform\nand this product is at the heart of it\nto help people when they are stressed\nto get a recommendation for a micro step\nand the microstep can be as small as\nclosing your eyes here or even not\nclosing your eyes if you're in a public\nspace and you don't want to\nand consciously focusing on your\nbreathing\nliterally i mean i did a one-minute\nmeditation at\ndreamforce yeah when you sat on the\ncloud i sat on the cloud and i've just\nput it on my instagram\na couple of days ago because it is so\nsimple and you know if you practice it\nyeah and take one minute it's just\nextraordinary how you course correct\nfrom strength\nfrom stress and you know nobody is going\nto eliminate stress from their lives\nwhat we're looking for is not to make it\ncumulative\nyes one of the one of the things i think\nwe have to realize is that what you're\npointing out is that there's acute\nstress and chronic stress\nand acute stress is good sometimes we\nneed that kind of like oh my god i need\nto get this done it's important\nwe all feel stressed before we go and\ngive a keynote or you feel stressed\nbefore a big meeting at work\nbut it's the chronic stress it's that\nrepeated stress it's the stress that's\nunderlying and building up like you said\ncumulative stress\nthat's the one we really need to be wary\nof exactly so just to give you an\nexample\nat thrive you know we're not a\nnine-to-five\ncompany you know we have a huge\nambitions people work hard\nbut we tell everybody if you\nhave a project that requires you to\npull an all-nighter or do\nextra intense work\ntake thrive time after that that is the\nkey\ndon't continue working as though you had\nnot\nexpanded extra energy and are depleted\nyes because if you do that just look at\nthe data i think you're going to get\nsick\nbecause your immune system is going to\nbe compromised\nso you may think you're powering through\nor grinding through\nyour body is going to let you down yeah\nand also your decisions and your work\nare not going to be as good as they\ncould have been\nabsolutely and i love your consistent\npoint about the data is showing this\nlike the data is showing this if we're\ndata driven\nthere's no con there's no there's no\ndebate there's no there's no\nthe data that's my opinion yes exactly\nit's not your opinion it's not a\nphilosopher's opinion it's yes\nit's not the opinion of oh let's be\nfluffy and let's believe in well-being\nit's data-driven so wellness is a 4.3\ntrillion category yes but it's not\ndefined\nyes it can mean anything it can mean\nwarm and fuzzy things\nyes nothing wrong with them but that's\nnot what we are talking about\nwe are talking about hardcore\nscience-driven data-driven\nrealities which also happen to be\nto be validating ancient wisdom that's\nwhat i love\nexactly yeah and that's that's i i love\nthat because\nwhen i started reading your books which\ni highly recommend sleep revolution and\nthrive like they're two of my favorite\nbooks\nwhat i loved about them is it's exactly\nwhat i try and do is\nthe bridge between ancient wisdom modern\nscience and practical application how is\nthis\nrelevant now you know how can you take\nit but now and the reason why\ni love ancient wisdom the way you do is\nbecause\nwe are not pavlov's dogs we do have a\nheart and a soul\nyes and so if we really want to change\nbehavior\nwe need to capture our imagination\nthat's what we are building the product\nwe're building\nintends to sort of crack the code on\nbehavior change\nyes the reason why behavior change\ndoesn't work most of the time is because\nwe only appeal\nto people's minds and we're more than\nour minds absolutely\nabsolutely ariana you're amazing and i\nhope we're going to do many many more of\nthese\nand this conversation i believe is just\nthe starting point i just wanted people\nto\ndive into your wealth of wisdom i highly\nrecommend it if you've loved this\nconversation\ni'm a big proponent of ariana's books i\nthink they're phenomenal\nand if you haven't checked out thrive\nglobal yet make sure you check them out\nthey're doing incredible work online\nin companies and bringing all of this to\nthe work environment which i think is so\nimportant\nhaving worked at accenture myself who i\nknow works very closely with you\nit's incredible to see this work\ninfusing into\nthe corporate culture and also i would\nlove to invite\nyour listeners to tell their stories\nah thrive global.com is my email send it\nto me\nand we'll give you a password and you\ncan post them\non jay's channels and on thrive global\nthe question is how can we accelerate\nthe distribution of these ideas\noh i love that that's awesome so irena\nwe end every podcast with what i call\nthe final five\nthese are the final five rapid fire\nanswer it can either be a one word\nthree word or one sentence answer no\nmore than that\nokay so i'm being a bit lenient but this\nis it it's easy for you\nwhat's the first thing you do when you\nwake up the first thing i do when i wake\nup\nis focus on my breath and three things\ni'm grateful for\nme too i love that uh what's the last\nthing you do before you go to bed\nthe last thing is again\nfocus on my breath and three things i'm\ngrateful for\ni love it if i went through your phone\nwhose number would i want to steal\ni think you would want to steal bill\nmaher's number okay\nwhy and because he's such a truth teller\ni don't agree with everything but i love\nhim he and i have been friends forever\nand also because he's unbelievably\nprivate so it's a very hard number to\nget\ni like it awesome i'm gonna have to try\nand grab your phone later who's\nwhat's the most used app on your phone\nso you know i have basically um\nremoved most apps from my phone nice\nso what i the most intimate\nthing i do is texting with my daughters\nand my friends\nand of course i'm obsessed with our\nthrive up yes\nbecause um a i\nintegrate in my life all the micro steps\nthat are fair to me\nbut also because i'm a big believer in\nconstantly iterating and improving it\nyes so i'm giving constant feedback so i\nuse it for myself but i also use it\nas a tool to keep improving it awesome\nand question five of the final five\nis what do you consider your biggest\naccomplishments so far oh\nabsolutely without question my two\ndaughters\ni love that i love them so much my\noldest daughter just got engaged and i'm\nso happy because\nher fiance somebody i love\nthat i actually hired for the huffington\npost oh no way\nthat's amazing i didn't know
