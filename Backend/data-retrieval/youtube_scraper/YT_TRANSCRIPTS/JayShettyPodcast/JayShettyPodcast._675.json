light you're like\nuh my eyes hurt i don't want to do this\nso you go back into the darkness and\nit's just going past that pain that\naddiction\nyeah by being in bed and trying to wake\nup it's so easy to just stay under your\nhead\nand make excuses i'll work out tomorrow\nhey everyone it's so great to be back\nwith you and i can't wait to introduce\nyou to my next\nguest we've been trying to

happen\nyeah somehow\nsomehow you didn't skip you didn't skip\nanything yeah amazing no you're awesome\nand\nand i'm so excited for you i saw the\narticle in variety\nthe other day yeah this is incredible\nyeah i'm very excited about it um i\ncan't believe i didn't even know about\nthe story\num just to kind of elaborate yes yes\nabout it\nwell in 1947 california became the first\nstate to desegregate all school things\nto a mexican-american family\nand people don't really know about that\nunless you know you study chicano\nstudies or\nreally look into our history and brown\nversus board of education is really the\nonly piece of history that we know with\ndesegregating schools\nbut actually thurgood marshall used\nmendis versus westminster\nas a gateway for brown versus board of\neducation and\nyou know i found out about this story in\njanuary\nand i brought it to mandy tv my\nproducing partner\nand we were just on it in trying to get\nthe family to come on board with us\nand they've had so many people approach\nthem about a film\nand somehow they felt more comfortable\nwith\nme than anyone else so now we're here in\nthe\ndevelopment stages and i'm very very\nexcited to finally like bring this story\nto light yeah that's beautiful how did\nyou find the story\nmy boyfriend actually oh yeah so um\ni've been wanting to produce for a long\ntime i've been doing this business for\n13 years now and i just kind of wanted\nto do more than just acting\nand mandy's always been pushing me to\nproduce as well i\nher husband is actually my manager\nand so my boyfriend's super supportive\nand i've been looking for stuff looking\nfor stuff and\nhe came across it somehow and he's like\ndid you know this\ni was like no and so i started looking\nmore into it\nand reading about it i brought it to\nmandy she goes how does\nany no one know this and i got rejected\nfrom school when i was five years old\nfor not being able to speak english\nso that was against my rights as a\ncitizen so\num you know we contacted sylvia mendez\nwho actually was awarded the medal of\nfreedom from barack obama and\ncontacted her went to see her and had\nprobably like a two three hour\nconversation with her and she\nimmediately said no i don't want to give\naway my rights and i was like okay\nlisten\nit's more than just making a movie i\nknow that education\nis very important to you i'm upset that\ni didn't learn about this in school\nand i want this to be a part of our\nschool curriculum\nand the best way to do that is through\nhollywood it has to be told i told her\nabout my getting rejected from school\nwhich she was shocked about because i\nwas in the 90s and this case happened in\nthe 40s\nand she i didn't know this but later on\ni found out that she went to her\nsister's house\nand said i have a feeling about her i\nthink\nthis might be the right move and it was\njust a gut feeling\nmet the whole family and then um we\nabout a few a few months ago we got\nthem to sign paperwork and now we're\npartners congratulations thank you so\nmuch\nsynchronicity of that story yeah it\ngives me so much\nit gives me so much faith in in\nentertainment and its role\nin shifting culture right and telling\nstories\nbecause the way that all came together\nlike your boyfriend\nyeah they trusted you and and that's\nhuge yeah that's massive for them to be\nturning that down but for you to also\nhave had that experience yourself\nright and that's one thing that my mom\nwas always so upset about she goes name\nthe school which i won't now but\nit's not worth it but i was telling my\nmom was like it's so funny at five years\nold this happened to me\nwho knew that that rejection would lead\nto this opportunity\namazing yeah years later i mean you just\nnever know\nabsolutely and what a beautiful\nconnection that yeah do you reckon\nthat's the reason that\nthe family felt like that was one of the\nreasons\ni think it was part of that um us\nlatinos\nwere very big about gut feeling and um\none thing that they said they're like\nyou can't really translate it they said\nwe just had a presentimiento which\nmeans intuition and i think just in\nconversing with her\nand you know growing up in this industry\nbeing very passionate about my culture\nand really wanting this to be a part of\nour education i think is what really\ndrove them and be like okay i love that\nwhere does that latino\ngut intuition come from like where when\ndid you start\nsaying that to yourself when did that\nstart being a way you made decisions in\nyour life uh when my mother\nknew things about me that there was no\nway she would have known about\nand unless it was that like got\nintuition i'm like mom how do you know\nthis\nshe goes i just know like it's just the\nweirdest\nintuition that women develop can you\ntell us one of those examples do you\nremember any of the cut you know\ni mean this might be tmi this might be\nthis is really tmi but it's one of those\nthings where like\nnothing happened i saw my mom one day i\nwent to visit her at a restaurant and\nshe goes you lost your virginity\nyesterday and i was like\nhow do you know that like it was what is\nlike that's\nhow crazy it is like she there's no way\nshe would have known\nyeah but she just knew that was amazing\nyeah well that was the best example you\ncould have given us\ndmi yeah that's crazy yeah wow and i\nlove how true that is for you because\neven your role\nin grown-ish is like challenging type\ncosts\nright it's like challenging typecast as\nin like you're you're challenging\nhow uh ethnicity and backgrounds are\npresented\ni think it is in any role period i mean\ni think before\nwhen i was first starting in this\nindustry i was just so desperate to work\ni was like i'll do anything\nand now i'm more so standing up for my\nculture\num and just my characters and you know\nsaying ah i don't feel comfortable\nsaying that or as a bit stereotypical\nthat's what i meant yeah yeah so i think\nit's with every role right\nand just even myself there was a line\nwe're shooting season two right now\nand um you know i have a scene with\nsomeone where we're talking about\nrelationships and\nhe's saying you know girls get crazy\nwhatever and\nmy line was well girls only get crazy\nbecause and i went to the producers and\ni said you know what i don't feel\ncomfortable saying that because i'm all\ni'm almost condoning the fact that girls\ngo crazy\nso they were very open to that and and\nyou know i was able to say quote-unquote\nwhatever but you know stuff like that\ni'm very much about standing up for\nany sort of body shaming i won't talk\nabout i'm just more open and like really\nstanding up for my\nown personal beliefs that will coincide\nwith the characters\nthat's amazing when did you when do you\nfeel or what made you feel confident to\neven have that conversation because from\nconversations i've had with artists and\nactors before it's very much like well\nthat's the script\nand it's not really something that\nshifts much right so how when did you\ndevelop that confidence or have you\nalways had it and\nwhere's it come from and i think one\nturning 30 really\nmade me be like dad don't care as much\nbut two\nhonestly it's the metoo movement because\nonce these stories started coming out i\nrealized that a lot of things that i\nwasn't okay with but i was quiet about\nwere actually not okay\nso because women started speaking out\nabout their experiences\nand even men too were speaking out on\nthis stuff and the time's up\ni just started being more comfortable\nbeing verbal especially because\nnow people do get in trouble for it so\num and people are very open-minded\na lot i work with the best writers and\nproducers and stuff so\num it's just a conversation i and you\nhear this growing up but it doesn't\nreally hit you until you're older i\nguess or something happens where like\nthe worst thing they can say is no\nso might as well try or you're just\ngonna regret and be like what if\ni should have i should have and i hate\nsaying i should have yeah\nabsolutely and but but i do i really\ni recognize and value that so much i\nadmire it so much because i think\ni i always said that if we don't see the\nculture of media shift then we can't\nexpect in real life i remember when\nyou started to see more lgbtq\nrepresentation media\nthen people feel like they can be\nthemselves yeah exactly you know\noff-screen and offline yeah\nand and i feel like the fact that you're\ndoing that like that makes me so happy\nyeah like it's such a huge thing to do\nand whether that's you representing your\nbackground your walk of life your\nphilosophy your ideologies whatever it\nis\nyeah i think it's such an important\nstance so i just want to recognize you\nfor that i appreciate it\nthank you thank you i think it's\nhopefully going to give anyone who's\nlistening like\nmore upcoming artists also yeah the\nfeeling\nto the freedom to do so and there's a\nway to go about it just do it with grace\nhave a conversation about it like i you\nknow i don't come with an attitude i'm\nnot yelling\num i try to sometimes sometimes it slips\nbut\nyeah you just gotta have a conversation\nbe like this is where i'm coming from\nwith it just with any relationship\ncommunication is key\nyou got to be the change so you know\njust talk about it where did you get\nthis amazing attitude i love it because\nthat's what i've been experiencing on\ninstagram and i'm like\nevery time you post something i'll be\nlike oh my god francie is so like\nevolved\nyeah no in a good way like you just have\nthis awesome energy about yeah i\nappreciate it and i was just like\nwhere do you get it from where where\ndoes it come from honestly lots of\ntherapy\nand church a lot of church yeah nice\ni've been actively going to church for a\nwhile now but i\ni think in 2000 when 2000 what year are\nwe in\n16 2018. in 1615 i was going\nconsistently every sunday and just\nreally soul-searching and having\nconversation just really understanding\nthings a lot differently than the way i\nwas seeing them\nthat's beautiful and that was not\nsomething that you did since you were\nyoung it was something that came later\non\nyeah it came later on when i was younger\ni mean i went through as many people\nhave a lot of trauma uh\ngrowing up and i was just angry and i\nwas going through a lot of pain i was\njust so confused and i started working\nat 17 years old so i went\nfrom being a senior in high school to\nfilling out w-2s not understanding\nwhat i was filling out and at the time i\nwas dating someone that was\n19 years older than me so i was just so\nconfused about life and just\nlost and i didn't actually get received\ntherapy from that relationship till\nabout\ni mean almost eight years later where i\nactually realized\nwhat kind of trauma had gone through\nwhat kind of verbal abuse i had gone\nthrough and\njust really had to grow up because it\ncame to a point where i was just so\ndepressed and i could not\nget out of my closet like that's where i\nwould pray and just cry was my closet\nand i just could not leave and i was\nlike i can't live like this anymore so\nyou know my pastor came into my life\nwho's like my big brother now\nmy acting coach was said i won't coach\nyou unless you go to therapy\nwow and so i was really forced by my\nloved ones to\nseek help and here i am a few years\nlater but i\ni needed it and i wanted it and i've\nlearned that it's really a choice like\npeople can tell you things or you can\ngive advice but if they're not ready to\nhear it like there's no point to it\nyeah and i was just at that point where\ni was ready it's amazing thank you for\nsharing that yeah of course yeah it's\nsuch a such a beautiful message also for\nloved ones to hear that\nyeah that they have to do or play their\nrole\nyeah like you what you just said your\nacting coach wouldn't work with you if\nyou didn't\nyeah and just playing that role but then\nyou're still saying it's your\nresponsibility it's your choice\nyeah it is i mean you got to play their\nrole but also be patient with you\nwhen you know you reject it and or\naccept it because\ni mean just like any other drug i think\npain could be addicting\nand it's so hard to get out of that\nbecause you're so used to living in that\ndark for so long that once you see the\nlight you're like\nuh my eyes hurt i don't want to do this\nso you go back into the darkness and\nit's just going past that pain how's\nthat addiction\nyeah it's like being in bed and trying\nto wake up it's so easy to just stay\nunder your head yeah\nmake excuses i'll work out tomorrow yeah\nyeah yeah exactly that's yeah self-pity\nis so addictive very addictive yeah very\naddictive\nthat's amazing it's nice to see how\ndifferent people find different things\nthat\ncreate that but the therapy and church\nseem to be popular yeah some\nsome something spiritual and something\ntherapeutic yeah helps you talk it\nthrough\nyeah exactly are you are you now\nproviding are you someone who\nis a helper amongst your friends too and\nlike guiding them through their\nchallenges and\nsometimes it depends on the situation um\nif they look for it and want to have a\nconversation for sure i mean\nwe have my friends i have different\ngroup of friends we have group chats\ngoing on and if they come to me then\nfor sure i'm i'm there but sometimes\nit's like you gotta wait to see if\nthey're ready\nor if there's a point where i'm like uh\nwhen you have a conversation what's\ngoing on with you then i will but it\njust really depends you don't want to\nforce it on anyone either i didn't like\nit when people forced it on me\nso i don't do that i'm really big about\nif i don't like something i'm not going\nto do it\nyeah absolutely i think that you have to\ngive people that freedom\nyeah if it doesn't feel like your choice\nyou're never going to follow up\nyeah exactly absolutely yeah i love it\ni've read somewhere that you're talking\nabout the\nchild of an immigrant work ethic oh yeah\nyeah yeah and i love that\nyeah can you tell us a bit about that\nlike what does that say no just like\nwhat\nwhat do you mean by that because i think\nlike that theme is kind of coming out a\nlot more in media now a lot of people\nare like\ni'm a child of an immigrant and i said\non work ethic it's impacting my success\nhow has it impacted yours well let's see\nwhen president trump came into office\njust like many people i was very angry\num especially because while he was\nrunning\nhe talked about my family and i say my\nfamily because i am mexican and honduran\nand we consider\neach other family as aliens\nas rapists as murderers and all this\nstuff and i've always been proud of\nbeing a first generation american\nand speaking spanish growing up i'm\nbilingual\nand then that was tested\nwhen he started running and so i started\nbeing more\nactive and outspoken about how proud i\nam of our culture\nand my father actually was born and\nraised in honduras came out here when he\nwas\nprobably in his 20s after both his\nparents died and\ndoesn't speak a lick of english to this\nday someone told him when he landed\nif you want to make it in hollywood you\nhave to learn english you're never going\nto make it and he said watch me\nand in 2014 he got a star in the\nhollywood walk of fame and still\ndoes not speak english he's been very\nsuccessful\nin his career and i think his work ethic\nand the fact that i had\nhope and what can happen living right\nnext to me is what's really made me be\nlike no we're not aliens we're not\nmurderers like my\nfather helped change the world a bit and\nthat he's a\nlatin man who doesn't speak english what\nare you talking about so i think that's\nwhere\nthat comes about and my passion for it\nand you know\nagain there's other people that first\ngeneration what an incredible role model\nto have right next to you\nyeah that's amazing that's amazing how\ndoes that how is that\nhow has that had pressure or as it just\nhas positives\nuh there's been a bit of both i i mean\nthere's no positive without pressure\nyeah okay yes i like that\nyeah so growing up there was a bit of\npressure i guess\num i didn't understand it growing up\nbecause my father was famous and i\nagain i did i didn't know him walking\ndown the street and people asking for\nphotos i didn't understand it because to\nme it's just my dad and i remember\nbeing like dad we go out today you're\nnot allowed to take pictures and you're\nnot allowed to meet people and if he did\ni would cry and be like you promised me\nnot\nunderstanding um and then it just felt a\nlittle pressure because i\nhad to hold up this persona because i'm\ncookley's daughter and i didn't\nunderstand what that meant\nand then when i chose to be a part of\nthis industry kind of living up to\nhis name a little bit because he's a\nhuge activist and i think that's why he\ngot the\nstar um when his ratings were really\ngreat in the latin market but also he's\nyou know started non-profit and you know\nwhen the earthquake in uh\nel salvador happened he built homes and\nhe built churches and he built schools\nand he went to nigeria he\nhe's he's huge um in philanthropy so wow\nyeah so now if you seeing your success\nif you would\never have kids i don't know if you want\nto have kids but if you were to ever\nhave kids\nhow would you how would you do it with\nthem with with people wanting to take\npictures with you and\noh god are you living there how would\nyou how would you manage that i don't\nknow i've never even thought about it\nsorry i'm like fast no you're fine\nbecause obviously it is a thought like\never since i turned 30 i was like okay\nbecause my mom brought it up she goes i\ndo want to know what it's like to have\ngrandkids with\nno pressure um i don't i don't know i\nmean i think\nyeah i think it's just having to explain\nit yeah yeah\nyeah i don't know a kid's gonna your\nkid's gonna be born with a million\nfollowers already\ninstagram that's like the new thing\nright like yeah i see it with so many\npeople like\nthe child's born and they have a million\ninstagram followers and then they're\nlike\nand they make money yeah and they don't\neven understand\nabsolutely it's crazy to me they're\nadvertising like the latest sneakers or\nwhatever\nyeah i know exactly and once you thought\nof it's cute yeah it's really good\nyeah gosh that's a good question i don't\neven know what i'm going to do yeah okay\nyour mom asked me to ask you so yeah\nyeah no it's it's definitely something\nthat i think about a lot as well it's\njust\nyou know the culture that yeah just that\nbut the culture that\nwe all grew up in it was different for\nme growing up in london yeah\nand you know i remember like my parents\nwould never get me a pair of nike\ntrainers because like sneakers sorry\nuh because it was just like no you can't\nhave those like we can't afford them\nwhatever it was and then i remember\ngetting my first pair and then\nnow i'm in a very different world yeah\nand you just wonder how\ndifferent things impact and even hearing\nyour story yeah\nof of the background and culture you've\ngrown in yeah i'm always just fascinated\nby\nhow people get their incredible\nideologies yeah i remember that too\nwhere\nwe couldn't afford anything and then my\ndad took me to toys r us one time and\nsaid get whatever you want and\ni was like what i don't you're not\nlimited me to like one toy\nyeah yeah and i mean hopefully when i\nhave kids i don't\ni can provide yeah but i think yeah it's\nhaving a conversation i don't think they\never really\ntalked to me about what he did and\nhelped me understand it it was just like\nthis is what he what he does and\nthat's it is what it is right yeah yeah\nthat's interesting yeah that would be a\nhard conversation\ni don't think they understood because\nhollywood wasn't like a thing i mean\ngrowing up in honduras in mexico it was\njust a dream but i grew up with it over\nthe hill\nand uh so i think it's just have a\nhaving a conversation my parents weren't\nvery open\nright with having conversations with us\nthey were very like conservative and old\nschool and stuff i mean i remember when\ni asked my mom what a virgin was she\ngoes\nit means um when you're not married and\nwhen you're not a virgin you are married\nand that was it that's how i found out\nabout sex that's what it was\nwow yeah so they were they wouldn't talk\nto me much\nand then and then she told you you were\nmarried yeah i know\nwow okay right yeah yeah that's\ninteresting that's awesome\ni was i everyone everyone who is\nlistening right now francia learns all\nher lines the day before i shoot\nlike i'm so impressed right now yeah you\nhave an epic memory\nyeah you just hold on me to production\nit's okay because that was no\noh sorry oh yes no no it's fine it's\nactually yeah no it's fine because\nyou know as long as i am prepared when\nwe um run lines and\nwhen we're shooting it's fine but that's\nthe best way that i learn like i can't\ndo it too many times before because then\nyou over rehearse and there is such\nthing as over rehearsing and then you're\nmore in your head\nand it's not as organic i mean like you\nand i are having a conversation right\nnow\ni mean if this were a scene i would have\nlearned it right before because i want\nto actually listen to your dialogue and\nif i over rehearse i'll know your\ndialogue then i'm not hearing you and\nthen i won't react\norganically wow have you as your style\nevolved has your workflow evolved as\nyou've been\nwhat's been like the newest lesson that\nyou've learned in your space\num probably like what i just talked\nabout is listening really\nreally listening improvisation a little\nbit because it's my first time on a\ncomedy\nand you know they kind of give us wiggle\nroom to ad-lib or improvise\nand i don't think i've really gotten\nmuch of that before\nso it's really made me stand up and like\nlisten and be on my toes and come up\nwith something clever\nyeah which that's actually really hard\nso snl people\nshe cries do you think you become\nfunnier in the process\ni hope so yeah i really hope so i get\nsome laughs\nyeah yeah we listen for that um because\nif\nvillage video village is where the\nproducers and the writers say if we\ndon't hear them laughing we're like am i\nnot funny\noh no and when we hear them laugh even\nthough sound hates it we're like no it\nmakes us feel good\nwhat's that pressure like though it's\nlike because that's i guess very\ndifferent to having your lines\ndoing your script here you've got that\nroom right it's like how does that feel\nlike\ntrying to wait for laughs it said to you\nalmost like a stand-up comedian and then\ni know right\num it's better now because we're all\nfamily this is the second year that\nwe've been working together and i think\ni put more pressure on myself than\nanyone did because i\nwas so used to drama and i can cry on\ncue\nbut you know comedic timing is crazy and\nit's a real thing so i was just\nputting a lot of pressure on myself but\ni've chilled out a lot this season and\njust kind of let it happen\nnice yeah nice i'm going to be looking\nout for now there's moments where i'm\nlike\nyeah that's fantasy of being comedic\nhaving those moments when\nwhen i see your work and i and i follow\nyou on instagram as i was saying earlier\nyou seem like someone who really values\nyour physical and your mental health\nyeah\nlike somebody really prioritizes it at\nleast i feel that way\nyeah and what kind of rituals or setups\nhave you put into place\nthat have helped you do that with a\nstressful career with a pressurized\nlifestyle with\ncrazy travel plans as we were discussing\nearlier what's become like priorities\nfor you\nto make sure that both of those work\nwell church on sundays i have to even if\ni'm traveling i've been bad about going\nphysically\num because of work and i'm tired but\nthey\nthankfully um we'll stream it online so\ni'll watch it online even if i hear it\nin the background so that's been\nvery important to me and very helpful um\njournaling\ni'm big about journaling and i try to\nfind time either in between takes\nor in the mornings it's been harder in\nthe mornings but my\nritual was is waking up making my coffee\num going outside to journal and then i\ngo to the gym\nor yoga or something and lately i've\njust been getting some friends to do\nyoga with me i'm trying to get your wife\nto do it with me do it\nyeah she would love that yeah hot yoga\noh my god yeah we just talked about it\nyeah please that was amazing yeah so\nit's like i i just need that\nstress reliever yeah yeah absolutely and\nyou're journaling was there a specific\nprocess that you did or was just\nletting all your thoughts from the day\nbefore or what's that kind of taken or\nis it just very\nopen and random and spontaneous uh it\ncould be random spontaneous but my\njournaling are my prayers because i'm\nvery bad about\nyou know being like dear god so i just\nwrite it and i write\nwhat i do is i write letters to god and\nthen whatever flows flows\nthat's beautiful yeah oh well that's\namazing ever going to print as a book\nprobably not okay these are personal\nyeah it's very personal i know\npeople have approached me about that but\nyeah they're super personal i think\nespecially in this business there's a\nlot of pressure to like\nbe public about things um so that stuff\nlike that i think is good to keep\nprivate which is so weird to me because\nit does\nit wasn't a thing until social media\ncame about because before it was like\nyou know keep your stuff private\nnow it's like you get paid to be more\nopen about your life\nand you know i think some people can\ntend to go crazy because you share too\nmuch\nyou know just like when you're little if\nyou share too much gossip it comes back\nto you so i can't even imagine being in\nthe public light with some of these\nrelationships and breakups i mean\nit's breakups especially because it's\nour you already have to deal with the\nbreakup and then\ndeal with people's opinions on top of\nthat it's just it's it's a lot\ntotally too yeah and sometimes i feel\nlike vulnerability\nis mistaken for telling everyone\neverything yeah and it's almost like i\ndon't know how you feel about that\nthat's how i feel like\nvulnerability to me doesn't mean telling\neveryone everything yeah\nbecause i just don't think that that's\ngoing to be helpful to you or to\neveryone right\nit's not useful yeah to me vulnerability\nis just being transparent\num in what you feel comfortable in like\ni'm being vulnerable right now and\nhaving this conversation but\ni'm not telling you everything about my\nlife you know you don't have to be i\ndon't know\nyeah no absolutely absolutely you know i\nfeel you're being transparent too\ni feel like you're sharing but yeah it's\nrelationships develop in layers\nyeah and you kind of move forward with\npeople yeah\nand naturally your inner circle knows\nyou better etc and\ntrying to get everyone to understand you\nat the same level actually doesn't make\nsense\nno especially at the speed that most\npeople want to do it in\nyeah yeah yeah exactly yeah it's it's\nlike business like i want to get to know\nyou straight away now\nyeah and i'm like chill out bro chill\nand yes you know i have people for i\nhave friends that i've known for many\nyears like our mutual friend\ni call him rez yeah rez shout out to rez\nwhat's up rez\nlook at what you did yeah yeah exactly\nand montana\nso uh yeah i've known him since we were\n14 years old but now it's like\nwe're at a point where we know each\nother so well but it wasn't because we\nyou know started sharing each other's\nsecrets right away we actually weren't\nfriends in high school and he hates that\ni talk about that but i think it's\nreally cool\nthat you know we actually weren't\nfriends in high school we developed a\nrelationship afterwards and now we're\nhere where\nwe just like in intuition we just know\neach other\nyeah yeah it's beautiful and that's such\na nice message to everyone listening\nyeah that it's okay if it takes time to\nbecome friends with people friends\nrelationships everything there's no rush\nthere's absolutely no rush especially\nrelationships i know people are like\nafter the first date what is this yeah\nand i was one of those girls like\nvery much about what is this where is\nthis going i just don't want to waste my\ntime and i understand that but it's okay\nto be friends first i think those are\nthe best relationships\nyeah i've been saying to a lot of people\nas well that just everything is so much\nmore\ngray yeah rather than black and white\nlike it's like this or that\nyeah we might like all in or nothing\nyeah or it's like\nokay what's happening or what it's not\nhappening it's almost like well actually\nthings are so much more gray yeah and\nyou allow it to develop organically and\nnaturally rather than rushing in or\nrushing out\nyeah and but it takes time and it takes\nlike\ntime time yeah and energy like real\namounts of energy and connection which\nwhich i feel like we just feel like we\nhave less and less time so yeah\nwell that's well yeah that's true which\nis true which we were trying to figure\nout we were like\ntrying to schedule a dinner i know like\nmaybe 2019.\nyeah i know we're trying to make it\nhappen yeah\nyeah you gotta meet my boyfriend yeah i\nreally want to tell me why you think\nwe'll get along\nuh i think on a spiritual conversation\nyou guys will get along he's\nvery much about meditation as well so i\nfeel like you guys will yeah get along\nthat way and just\ni just have a feeling okay yeah yeah you\nhave the guy\nyeah yeah well no i need to talk to you\nabout your prayers too i'm i'm a huge\nfan of prayer\ni think prayer is probably one of the\nmost beautiful things\nand i remember when i first started\npraying and this is beautiful talking\nabout it with you i didn't even plan\nthis but\nwhen i first started praying i'd always\nbe like i don't know what to say\nand then now that prayer has become so\nmuch more natural in a conversation\nyeah it's almost like you feel inspired\nto pray\nright like the prayers are coming\nthrough you and to you as opposed to\nright you having to think about what to\nsay or saying the same thing every day i\ndon't know\ndoes that sound similar to your\nexperience what's yours like so\nwhen i first started praying and i'm\ngonna share this because i don't know if\nthis will speak to someone\num obviously i was like just sitting\nthere i'm like i'm talking to myself i\ndon't know what so i started journaling\nand those were my letters to god\nbut it came to a point where i felt\ndisconnected\nand i was like i don't hear god the way\nthat i used to or i don't feel things of\nwhat i used to and i'm having a harder\ntime\nand i was really discouraged really\nfrustrated this happened earlier this\nyear and i was going to my pastor and\nlike i i come to church but i feel so\ndisconnected\ni remember during worship i would cry\nbecause i would feel it and now it's\njust very like\nblank to me and one thing he said to me\nwas\nyou're not praying the way that you used\nto when you used to pray when you first\nstarted\nyou were in a broken place of course you\nheard god differently\nbecause you it was a broken person\nseeking that but now that you have\nchrist in you\nit's just in you you're not going to\nhear him the same way because you're\nalready\nyou're acting christ-like which is what\nwe are taught in church is to be more\nchrist-like so when you're more\nchrist-like it's not that you're\ndisconnected you're just\nliving and walking what you know christ\nwants you to be\nwalking in so it's it's definitely been\ndifferent now because now it's like\nyou know i hear about the fires i'm like\ndear god please with with these fires i\nwas like praying for rain\nlike something you know it's just more\nof a conversation whether it's in my car\nin the shower just like\nyou and i are talking right now it's not\nso much like okay i got a journal i'm\ngonna be quiet and listen to worship or\nsometimes even just listening to music\nworship music is my form of praying and\nit's just a conversation and\njust the way i'm acting or the decisions\nthat i make and how i\nhandle certain situations is my form of\nbeing more christ-like and\nhandling prayer yeah that's beautiful\nand i love that acceptance also of\nwe do change the way we communicate yeah\njust like we do in our relationship yeah\nit's the same thing it's not like\noh because it was good then yeah it's\nlike that same feeling has to happen\nyeah exactly and that that's hard to\naccept because i was like i\nam not as connected anymore what's going\non i'm going to church but it's just\ni'm not so broken anymore where i hear\nit the same that's the difference\nand that's where you know you can either\ntry to go back to being in that dark\nplace\nso you can hear it the same way or you\njust kind of accept the new chapter that\nyou're kind of enduring which is what we\nwork so hard\ntowards yeah you've just opened up a new\nthought for me it's\nit's so often that we actually recreate\nmore drama to feel that brokenness again\nbecause that makes us feel connected\nyeah it's addictive\nyes it's addictive yeah so we can have\nsomething going on or wrong with us like\ni'm like oh i'm not crying in therapy as\nmuch as i used to let me try to make\nsomething up\nor my boyfriend and i are getting along\nthat's a that's weird\nlet me start a fight i hope you don't\nget to do that no\nno no no i've been good i mean if\nanything i'd be like more\nopen like hey i've been snappy lately\ni'm sorry i don't know why i don't know\nwhat's going on\nyeah no we do the same i always do that\ni i think i apologize to my wife like\nall the time yeah i'm so much more aware\nnow\nof the way i'm behaving yeah so it's so\nmuch more easier to catch myself\nyeah behaving in a way i don't like or\nbeing distracted or whatever it may be\nyeah and just being like i'm sorry i'm\ndoing that yeah\nplease forgive me because i'm going to\ndo that when or just being aware and\nactually being able to inform the other\nperson of why you're behaving\nright like oh i'm trying to do this\nright now yeah and that means i don't\nknow yeah\nno the same i mean i've been more aware\nand i'm like i'm sorry and\nand recognizing it before and before i\nused to be like it's your fault because\nyou didn't put the toilet seat down so\nit's making me react this way\nyou know so now more like communicate\ncommunicative as i say communicative\nyeah yeah\nyeah put the toilet seat down gents put\nthe toilet seat down\nyeah make it easy\n[Laughter]\nmake it easy for yourself there are easy\nthings like that in relationships though\nyeah and that's what i think it's like i\nalways found\nlike me and my wife by far the the best\nand the easiest the most amazing\nrelationship i've ever been in obviously\nthat's where we got married but the\ninteresting thing about it is that\ni feel like i never wanted to be in a\nrelationship but we just argued over the\ndumb stuff\nyeah the small stuff yeah because i felt\nlike that was the easy stuff that we\nreally should change adapt clear like\nmake make it easy on yourself yeah\nbecause relationships as you grow\ngets harder in different ways so many\ndifferent ways i think it wasn't\ni thought it was good i was like i'm\ngreat i'm\nbecause i was um celibate and for like a\nyear and a half i wouldn't date and i\nwas like you know\nlet me just focus on myself and grow\nbecause there's no way i can keep a\nrelationship right now\nbecause i'm not happy so after a year\nand a half i met him\nand i still wasn't even ready to date\nbut he came in my life and i was like\nyou know what i can handle this because\ni'm\nso good and then realizing oh you're\nstill a shitty person in some capacity\nbecause even though i'm good i'm selfish\nnow so now i have to\nlearn to not be selfish and communicate\nand you know compromise\nwhich is like the biggest thing is\ncompromising yeah yeah\nis that bad and we're back\nyes we're back after that technical\ndifficulty\nof some roof work going on yeah i think\nbut no we were we were so\nand i love i love where we were because\nwe talked about relationships yeah and\nso much of my audience\nis watching a lot of my videos which are\nabout relationships\ni'm fascinated by them because i had so\nmany failed relationships previously\nsame to my marriage same oh good okay so\nwe're on the same wavelength\nand i failed so many times i made so\nmany mistakes i got so many things wrong\nand i wanted to help people whoever\nwanted to be to avoid those same\nmysteries right\nand allow me to explore content around\nrelationships because i really do feel\nit takes up such a big part of our lives\nand and we were both talking about ours\nso\nwe were diving into just\nawareness on when you walk into a\nrelationship someone's at a certain\nlevel\nsomeone's at a different level yeah and\nhow sometimes some people have to be\npatient and wait\nyeah yeah how tell me when you've got it\nwrong and now when you're getting it\nright when you're understanding yourself\nbetter\nversus when you didn't well i think when\ni first got into my relationship i was\nstill very selfish and very much about\nmy ways and i wasn't necessarily\nlooking for a relationship i hate saying\nthis but it does happen when you least\nexpect it\nso tooth 2017 yes was a crazy year for\nme\ni had just sold my home and i didn't i\ndidn't have a home because i\nwas leaving a film the day i closed\nescrow and so i didn't want to um\nget into a new house and not even be\nthere so\nand i sold all my furniture i just\nneeded to get rid of everything i had\ntoo many\nmemories and energies that i didn't want\nand it was just time for a change and i\nthat probably was the best decision that\ni'd ever made like so many of those\nenergies are just gone\num they're not apart with me and and it\njust made a whole weight just lift off\nme very expensive\nbut also just also very healing for me\nand so i moved in with one of my friends\nmany of you know the story with my\nfriend selena and uh\nyou know i was in that new search of\nmyself\nhad been going to church and therapy and\nyou know clean slate and then you know i\nwent through a kidney transplant\nand i booked grown-ish a few weeks after\nthe transplant and so i was like wow\nlife is\ndefinitely taking a turn just for me\ngetting rid of that old energy\nso it was just like a turn of events\nthat happened and i i didn't even\nrealize that there were certain choices\nthat i had to make in order to\njump into that new way of life that i\nwanted and sometimes it was\nit's hard decisions like selling your\nhome that i had lived in for eight years\nand i kid you not i woke up at three\no'clock in the morning and god was like\nyou gotta sell your house and i had felt\nit months prior\nbut i wouldn't listen and then i was put\nin a position where like i just had to i\nremember having the worst anxiety and i\nwas cringing i couldn't sleep i was\ncrying\nand it was the best decision i'd ever\nmade cleansing myself of all of that\nand i met my boyfriend on set he\ni don't remember meeting him he said he\ndoes but he said he knew just from\nlooking at my headshot and he was like\nwho is that\nand i think that some people were like\ndomes with an actress\num which whatever but uh\nyeah he started talking to me pretty\nimmediately um on set and i didn't\nreally notice it because i again i just\nwasn't\nmentally there i was just trying to do a\ngood job and i had so much stress on\nmyself\nthat no one else put me in of like being\nfunny or just\neven um you know at the time i was 29\nyears old and i was playing 18\nso i was like i need to look young and i\nneed to act young and everyone else is\nyoung it was just like unnecessary\npressure i just put on myself\nand he just knew and um was like two\nweeks into filming he had invited me to\ncatalina island to celebrate his\nbirthday and it was just me and i was\nlike no\ni don't know you you might kill me and\ni was very yeah he was like why not and\ni'm like i don't know you i'm not about\nto get on a boat with you to go to some\nisland that's like weird and i was\nreally shocked because my sister\nwho never usually likes anyone it was\nthe one that pushed it\nand uh even so i was i went and um\nat lunch i was just a brat the minute i\ngot there i was like i get\nseasick just so you know and i was like\nwell i'm here but i don't want to be\nhere just so you know like i was just so\nmean but he was just so like persistent\nabout it and we actually ended up having\na really good time\nand then i ghosted him as much as i\ncould because we were working together\nfor like a month\ni swear i ghosted him for a month i\nwould see him at work and he was like\ntrying to be sweet like you're so\nbeautiful i'm like stop talking to me\nlike i'm you're doing the most right now\nand basically like we're a year in and\nwe're good um\nbut what i was talking about earlier is\nlike he was somewhere where i just\nwasn't yet and i wanted to take my time\nand i was so good about\nrushing into relationships and after the\nfirst date being like what are we\ni didn't understand casual dating yeah\num\nyou know kind of like they do on the\nbachelor where they date multiple girls\nor\nguys at a time i just didn't know how to\ndo that so if i went on a date with you\ni'm like okay cool so when's our next\ndate and\nif i went on date with someone else i\nthink i did it one time where i was like\ndating a couple guys\nand it just backfired on me and i was\nlike i can't\ni don't understand how people do this\nand it's okay like i don't get it\nso with him um i just was like all right\nlet me just\ntake it really slow we went to catalina\nbut i'm just not there he called me he\nactually called\nnot text he called i was like what do\nyou what do you want like i'm not here\nright now\nand he just kept pursuing which is crazy\nbecause\neverything that i had wanted in a guy he\nwas doing and i was rejecting it\nbecause i wasn't used to it i was so\nused to being ghosted\nor being hit up late at night you up or\nyou know being a secret or just\nall the toxic things that you don't want\ni was so used to that and he wasn't\ndoing it and so i was\nrejecting it and i didn't want it and\nthen it took about seven months for me\nto get to where we're at now even though\nlike\ni've been posting about him sooner\nbecause i always knew that i wanted to\nbe with him but i just was still\nkind of hesitant because i i was just\nscared\nand i i learned that like yeah it's\ndefinitely a choice\nit's definitely a choice to work through\nthings with someone and he chose\neveryday to keep choosing me even though\ni was acting like a brat\nbut what was it more than the\npersistence because i'm sure people have\nbeen persistent with you before\nand that's sometimes not enough or was\nthat\nit was he was just it was just different\ni just could not let him go for some\nreason like as much as i tried\ni would still pick up his phone call or\ni would text him like you haven't called\nme today\nit was just different i think also my\nthe fact that my sisters not having met\nhim were so supportive of it\nyeah also yara shahidi i blame her um\nand her mother because they\ntalked him up and they were like you\nunderstand he doesn't do this i'm like\nyes he does i'm an actress and the crew\ni'm sure there's plenty of other actors\nlike you know and so\ni think finding out that this was out of\ncharacter for him was what made me be\nlike oh you might be a little different\nand this is how he got me to hang out\nwith him\num after catalina that he came up to me\none day on set and said can i come to\nchurch with you\nwhat am i saying no no you don't have to\n[ __ ] you can't come to church my space\nsounds it's smooth oh nice yeah that's\nthat's amazing i can't wait to meet him\nnow yeah he's great i love it that's\nbut and now if you read francis messages\nthere's so about him on instagram\nthey're so different and adorable\nand thanks\nbut it's no it's nice to see i just love\ni'm so glad you shared that\nbecause i love how you didn't run into\nsomething rush into something when you\ndidn't feel ready\nat the same time you know\namazing props to him for actually\nwaiting sticking around being patient\nnot washing it\nyeah and and then actually saying like\nyeah this is working for me\nright whereas today i find like it's i\ndo see a lot of\nokay let's talk about this because you\nyou could say from your perspective\ni do see a lot of this today a lot of\nguys are trying to\ndo everything nicely and well and\nand provide you know whatever whatever\nthey're trying to do they're trying to\nlike wine and dine and date and all the\nrest of it\nbut a lot of girls are like resisting\nbecause we're not used to it right\nokay so tell us a bit about that like is\nthat if someone's in that same scenario\nwhat signs should they be looking for as\na female or as a male as a female\nas a female you know i think where i was\ni was at a point where i was just\ntired of toxic relationships and it was\nreally necessary for me to take that\nbreak for a year and a half\nso it was a choice and if you're ready\nto break that cycle and\nyou know you want a relationship and you\ndon't understand why you're single and\nyou don't understand what's not working\ntake a year and which might sound like a\nlong time but\nit took me a year and a half but take a\nyear take six months whatever just\nto yourself because unless you step away\nfrom whatever\nis keeping you in that darkness you're\nnever going to be able to see the light\nso it's like\nyou know your body when you start eating\nhealthy and you're so used to\neating fast food your body adjusts to\neating fast food but when you start\ngoing through a detox you're going\nthrough a lot of pain your stomach hurts\nyou're releasing a lot of things\nand then let's say you eat clean for\nabout a month\nif you even touch a french fry your\nstomach starts to hurt because you've\ncleansed it so much that you're not even\nused to that\nyou know that toxic those toxic foods\nand\noils anymore your body's like rejecting\nit so i think in life and period you\nhave to do that where you kind of have\nto step away and\ntake that out of your your um vision and\nso you can kind of clear your mind\nbe more about yourself and then when you\nstep back into it you have more of a\nclearer vision of who you are and what\nyou're looking for does that make sense\nyeah it makes perfect sense yeah when\nare you writing a book oh gosh\nno genuinely i'm not i'm not i'm not\nmessing around with it yeah it makes\nperfect sense yeah makes perfect sense\nit's the same with any sort of diet\nyeah and what what signs should guys be\nlooking for if they're being really\npersistent they really like a girl\nthey're really making the effort but\nshe's resisting and pushing back what\nshould they really be doing and\nwhat signals should they be looking for\num i guess the signal with me\ni mean that that's it's hard i think\nreally understanding where they are in\nlife\nthe best thing you can do is be their\nfriend that's awesome it's it's\nbeautiful to hear\ni love it and thank you for being so\nopen and honest and it really helps the\nconversation\ni don't think i ever really have i'm\nstarting to more so this year because\ni've just been through such crazy\nexperiences and i feel like people\nreally\nneed to learn it just like um i value\nfrom it when i go to church because you\nknow pastors they pour their own life\nout\nyeah as they're also teaching the bible\num\ni think it's important for us especially\ngiven the platform that i've been given\nto\nkind of speak out about it and it really\ndoes make me feel good when\nyou know girls come up to me or people\ncomment on instagram that like it really\nkind of helped their day a little bit\nand i think that's what it's about\nat the end of the day it's just kind of\ngiving back and helping grow in this\ncrazy little life\nso it seems like relationship's been an\narea where you've really learned a lot\nabout yourself\nyeah work has to in terms of the\nincredible work that you're doing which\nwe spoke about earlier\nhas it been any other area of your life\nthat's exciting you or something new\nthat you're trying to learn right now\nor something that's fascinating you that\nthat hasn't been around before\nlike what like there's so many things\nokay let's let's start let's start with\nactivism let's start with the thing that\nyou're being an activist for something\nthat you're standing up for something\nyou're really passionate about\nright um obviously i'm super passionate\nabout the latino community right now\nwhich is why i'm really excited to bring\nthe mendez story\nto life and then um i wasn't\nso outspoken about you know my culture i\nmean\ni was always like i'm latina and i'm\nproud or whatever but i've had some\npeople come up to me being like\nthank you for talking a lot more and i\nwas like i gotta be honest i was just i\njust was scared before because\nyou know i don't want to complain so\nmuch\nabout being latina and not being able to\nwork because\nyou know i've been very fortunate that i\nam latina and i have been\nwork been able to work in hollywood and\nand it has been difficult but\ni also wanted to praise the people that\ngave me an opportunity\nand also i didn't want to complain\nwithout having a solution\nsomeone challenged me in that one day\nlike okay you're complaining about this\nwhat's your solution so now\num i'm more open to talking about it and\ni've because i've gone through\ni guess sort of a change within myself i\nwasn't so angry anymore and i've learned\nto have a lot more grace in\ncommunicating and stuff like that\nand obviously being a voice for those\nwho don't have a voice\nbeing a first generation um uh mexican\nand honduran american\nuh just kind of speaking up out about\nyou know what we're kind of going\nthrough and\nhow we do bring value into\n[Music]\namerica as some people might think we\ndon't yeah and\nyou i'm sure you're getting a lot of\npositive feedback and support yeah yeah\nit's been crazy it's been really amazing\num the the feedback the support how you\nknow a lot of\nother fellow latinos are like thank you\nfor finally speaking up which\ni'm glad that i waited because\ni'll talk about this and it coincides\nwith that\nmy kidney donation for example many\npeople have been\nhave told me why don't you speak more\nabout that why aren't you an activist on\norgan donation and to me my response is\nit's something that i personally went\nthrough it was a personal choice\nit just happened to be very public\nbecause of who i gave it to\nbut i want to be able to\ntalk about it when i'm ready and i don't\nwant to be feel forced just because i\nhave a platform because then\nwhat i'm saying is not genuine it's not\nsincere and it's still a lifestyle that\ni'm adjusting to\nalso again it was a personal choice and\ni understand my platform\nbut i still on need to personally\nunderstand why i made that choice\nand how i feel about it and kind of\neducate myself more before going out and\ntalking about it\nand there's just so much pressure put on\ncelebrities where it's like well\nyou've done this and you've gone through\nthat so you need to talk about it's like\nno\nwe i i don't i really don't i mean i i\nwill at some point but\nin my own time when i have the right\nwords and it sounds genuine and not like\ni'm a robot and someone was feeding me\nthese lines and because people can tell\nespecially nowadays with social media\nand stuff it's just so easy to tell\nwhat's\nfake and what's real and what's paid and\nwhat's not paid\nthat is such a great lesson yeah like\nwhat you just shared is such a great\nlesson like just a about being ready\nand be about having the right words it's\nnot just a broadcast it's not like a\ntweet it's not just a message of like\nyeah this is what i'm doing right now\nbecause\nif you've been able to process it learn\nfrom there\nreflect on it think about like what you\nsaid like you were just adjusting to a\nnew lifestyle yeah\nand so when you're transitioning it's\nvery hard to articulate how you feel\nyeah exactly explain how you feel and so\nmany people are being forced to just\ntalk about it because popularity etc\njust breaks you through and people start\ntalking about you a bit more yeah\nexactly\nexactly and same with you know growing\nup a latina and now working in hollywood\nlike\ni didn't understand i needed the right\nwords i hadn't gone through\nenough struggle to really understand\nuntil you know recently because\nyou know my dad helped me understand\nthat\ni can do it you know and most people\ndon't have the advantage so i needed to\ngo through my own\nhollywood experience to be able to sit\nhere and be like all right here's the\ndeal\nyeah yeah i love that thank you for\nsharing that\ni think everyone listening that's like a\nhuge huge takeaway yeah i mean there's\nbeen so many takeaways from already from\nour conversation but\nthat's a huge one just about being ready\ngoing through the process\ndoing the work going through the journey\nit's not easy doing the work is probably\nthe hardest part\nit's the hardest part like you know\nbeing in college studying for the final\nit's the hardest part is studying and\nthen once you're done it's like\nokay yeah yeah yeah and then and then\ncomes life and then comes life yeah and\nthen comes other things and then comes\nother challenges and\none thing my therapist said and she\nkeeps repeating it to me until it\nfinally\nhit me was nothing in life is fair\nnothing in life is logical the minute\nyou understand that and\naccept it you'll understand freedom\nand it's very true absolutely do you\nwant to unpack that a bit\nit makes sense as it is but let's unpack\nit okay yeah well what did you get\nso no i love it i absolutely love it i\nthink i say something similar to myself\nbut\nif we take that nothing in life is fair\na lot of people take that as negative\nso a lot of people hear that and go oh\nwell if life's not fair then life's not\ngoing to do anything for me i'm going\ngonna try because\nlife's not fair right because that makes\nme that makes some people not me\nmakes people feel like hopeless and\nhelpless and like yeah life's not fair\neven if i work hard nothing's gonna\nhappen because life's not fair so i'm\njust gonna sit in bed all day\nso let's unpack it from that like how do\nwe how do you understand it in a way\nthat doesn't\ngive you that feeling well i'll speak as\nan actress\num nothing in life is fair sometimes a\nperson will get a job that i was up for\nand i know i work way harder than that\nperson and i know that i put more time\ninto studying and this person just got a\ndui the other day but because they have\nmore followers\nthey got the job that's not fair and so\nwhat i've had to learn that is\nyeah it's not fair but that also wasn't\nthe job for me\nthat's the door that wasn't supposed to\nbe open another door was supposed to be\nopen for example i was on a show\num and i got recast and i was like the\nhell that's\nnever happened to me it was like i just\ngot fired whoa\nand it was not fair i didn't understand\nit was a dumbest\ni actually can't even tell you the\nreason i don't know because i never got\na phone call i never got any sort of\nexplanation\ni kid you not it wasn't fair but then i\nwouldn't be on grownish right now\nso again like i said rejection leads to\nopportunity so i don't know what\nhappened i\nokay so that person doesn't work as hard\nthat lifestyle whatever their choices\nare is not my problem\nand if i focus on that on what isn't\nfair then i'm not able to move on with\nmy life it doesn't mean that you're not\ngoing to have another opportunity it\njust wasn't that one which is\nfine and that's the hard part is\naccepting okay it's fine that i didn't i\ndidn't get that one\nyeah yeah no i love that and that seems\nto be a recurring theme in your life as\nwell of rejection and an opening\noh that's the only thing this business\nis is rejection\nyeah it's more rejection than positive i\nmean\ni you know i've been doing this 13 years\nand my resume\nyou know i'm i'm grateful for it but out\nof the what\nlet's say there's 10 things on my resume\ni auditioned for thousands of them and i\ngot no's\nand i got yeah you know 10 yeses yeah\nit's such a numbers game yeah like\nsuccess and failure and\nand breaking through is such a numbers\ngame yeah it's hard it's not amazing\nit is hard i remember i i before i ever\nmade a video\ni had this idea that i wanted to share\nmindful messages\nmessages that were hopefully going to be\nempowering and positive and uplifting\nand i was pitching it around to all\nthese media companies because i never\nhad any background in the media like\nno one in my family has ever worked in\nthe media i don't have any network\nthat's ever worked in the media i just\ndon't know anyone growing up in london\nall my friends family are like doctors\nand lawyers and dentists\nand so i'm pitching this idea out and\nliterally\n40 to 50 media companies just said we're\nnot interested because you have\nno media background you have no\njournalism background you know\nyou you've never made a video before in\nyour life yeah despite my\nthe fact that i'd studied and taught\nthat for so long right and and one thing\ni always say to people is you just need\none person to say yes\nright you just need one yes yeah and\nwe're so worried by like the thousand\nno's\nyeah lady gaga says that right now all\nthe time she goes 100 people will say no\nto you you just need that\none yes but also you need that work\nethic to keep going so you can get that\none yes and that's what's hard and then\nyou got to sit back and realize\nwhy am i doing this is it because i want\nthe notoriety for it or is it because i\nwant to help people because every job is\nto help somebody\nyes it's not just for yourself obviously\nthere's reward to it like you know for\nexample\nyou know for us you know we there are a\nlot of events and people that we get to\nmeet those those are the rewards that we\nget for being\ndoing what we do but then there's also\nthe other reward of being able to speak\nfor those that can't speak for\nthemselves\nyeah and that's where you got to focus\non yeah and you do that so well\nyeah so much how did you do it though\nwith the rejections\nhow do you do it in a way where you can\nobserve and judge yourself so you know\nyou need to change\nlike because when people when you're\nhearing know often there's one school of\nthought that's like yeah just keep going\nbut then there's the other school of\nthought like am i getting no because i\nalso need to grow\nyeah right am i hearing no because i\nalso need to change or progress\nright how have you factored that into\nyour own work and career\num a lot of honest people in my life\num and again i was just ready to hear it\nand\nchange and learn it and kind of talk\nabout the pain i was going through\num when i first started working with my\nmanager he was very transparent with me\non\nyou know how people viewed me and then i\nwas very transparent with him like okay\nso this is what i've been going through\nand this is why i was acting like this\nand i'm not that person anymore and\nyou know my words can say it but my\naction will say something differently\nand so um now i just\nyou know my the nose that i get the\nrejection that i get i'm like i\ndissected a little bit it's like well\nlet me get feedback\nalways because of this okay all right\ncool then i'll know that for next time\nrather than\njust dwelling and being upset because\nsome have been career changers for some\npeople\nand i'm like this could have been me\nyeah that could have been me\nbut i was too depressed and honestly i\nwould if i would have gotten those\njobs that would have changed my career i\nwouldn't be\nhere today personally i probably would\nhave\nfallen off the deep end somehow because\ni wasn't ready for it\nand that's when i'm like okay god really\nknows when you're ready for something or\nnot because\ni yeah some people get it they're not\nready for it\nyeah absolutely and it's and it's so\nmuch nicer when\nyou can actually have your success\nwhen you're able to actually navigate it\neffectively yeah exactly have it when\nyou can really appreciate it you can\nacknowledge it\nyou can experience it without sometimes\nexternally having this success\nyeah but then internally you're not even\nyou know you're not even actually\nprocessing any of that\nright i think it came to a point where\nit wasn't such a priority to me anymore\ni remember my boyfriend makes fun of me\nnow but when we first met i was like\nwhere comes first\nwork is number one and then it's family\nand then we'll fit you in there\nsomewhere like i was so like work work\nwork work and now i'm like ah you know\nwhat i just want to be able to\neat every day and save and have a home\nthat's all i care about it's not even so\nmuch about\ngetting a job or reaching the capacity i\nwant to go to it's just about being able\nto survive\nand because i've changed my mentality\njust all this work keeps coming and it\nwas i wasn't so focused on it\nand to where i could appreciate it more\nand just kind of sit back and take my\ntime with it\nthat's such a beautiful place to be yeah\ni mean it again goes with relationships\nwhen you're not looking for it it comes\nto you when you're not looking for that\njob somehow it comes to you and my\nboyfriend's\nreally big about that he he's very good\nabout manifesting things and then they\njust\nhappen and i'm like please teach me that\ngift yeah yeah like he just\nquit a job recently and he was like i\ndon't know what's gonna happen he's\nfreelancing and his phone hasn't stopped\nringing\nyeah and it's amazing to me yeah so like\nbecause so many people talk about\nmanifesting as\nhaving a clear vision knowing what you\nwant knowing and\ni have my own thoughts on this but so\nmany people talk about manifesting as\nhaving a clear vision\nwhereas when you're talking about you're\nactually saying when you're not chasing\nsomething that's when people are\nattracting it\nyeah how have you thought that whole\nphilosophy through i think\nit boils down to faith being able to see\nthe things that are not yet in front of\nyou\num so i'll go back to god it's like you\nknow\nfor those that are believers it's like\nyou know that god's always with you you\ndon't ever\nphysically see him you don't ever you\nknow\nyou don't have them by your side but you\nknow that it's there and you know that\nit's there so even like\nwhen when you have a dream in your heart\nand i truly believe that god's not going\nto put a dream in your heart if it's not\ngoing to happen but you have to go\nthrough the growth of it and that's the\npart that like\npeople don't want to do yeah my pastor\nsaid this one time\nhe was like in a crazy how one day\nyou're like all right i'm gonna follow\ngod\nand i've changed and i'm a new person\nand everything's gonna be great and\nthat's when you go through the worst\ntime\nof your life you go through hell after\nyou say yes\nand you're mad you're like it's been a\nmonth i go to church a week every week i\npray i read the bible why is everything\nso bad\nand you know you talk he talks about\npuzzle and how you got to break the\npuzzle and kind of put it back together\nit's like you want god to fix everything\nin a week when you've been messing up\nyour life for 25 years\nand you expect it to be just it's good\nright away so i think it all just comes\nto faith and just having the faith that\neverything's gonna\nfall in place the way that you're\nsupposed to so i think with\nmanifesting it's so much more of like\njust believing in it and letting it\nhappen organically the way it's supposed\nto and not trying to force things\nbecause when you try to force something\nthat's\nwhen it's bad or wrong\nor you just feel terrible about yourself\nlike when you try to force a\nrelationship that you clearly know\nyou're not supposed to be in\nand then you're depressed for five years\nyeah absolutely yeah i know i remember\nwhen i trained as a monk\nso many of our teachings were in the\nsame vein around it when you pray for\nhumility\nyour ego gets crushed yeah so you're\nlike you're praying for humility you're\nlike i want to be humble\ni know that it's important to have\nhumility and not have pride and the next\nthing you know\nlike everyone's like blowing up your\ncomments so like everyone's coming up to\nyou and your ego is getting crushed\nyeah and so when you're praying for\nstrength you're sent challenges\nyeah right when you pray for strength\nyou have to be strengthened and that's\ngoing to take challenges and going\nthrough pain\nyou don't just get strength you don't\njust one day wake up yeah with more\nstrength\nor when you pray for patients yeah and\nthen your patience gets real\ntested yeah yeah exactly yeah blindly\nyeah\ntrusting that things are gonna be okay\njust like we blindly trust an uber\ndriver to get us safe too with our\ndestination\nyeah i remember one of my friends\nactually told me once he was like i\ndon't pray for that stuff because i know\nit's gonna bring me pain\ni know he was like i'm not gonna pray\nfor patients even pastors say don't pray\nfor patient that's the worst prayer\nyou're gonna give yeah yeah all right\nyeah\nyou'll be really pushed oh really really\npushed but you know the other side looks\ngreat\nyeah but everything takes time yeah\nabsolutely and the beautiful thing about\ngetting\nthat ability or that characteristic or\nthat quality or whatever we want to call\nit that virtue\nis that it stays with you yeah you now\nhave that in your toolkit\nyeah like once you've experienced\npatience or lived with patience\nyou can now use that again in the future\nyeah it's not like you lose it\nyeah one of the things that i value more\nis grace once i understood grace\ni've definitely had a lot more patience\nwith people because i understand\ngrace and i'm glad that i went through\nthe struggle of\nunderstanding what grace really was so i\ncan actually walk the way that i have\nbeen walking just from understanding\nthat\ncan you define and share your\nunderstanding of grace for anyone who\ndoesn't\noh god it's so hard to define it\num i think just having a patience with\npeople like for example there are so\nmany mistakes that i've made in my life\nas we all have growing pains or whatever\nand god had the grace to\nstill love me through it and take me to\nthe other side i know there's so many\npeople are like i can't walk in church\nuntil i'm good with god because if i\nwalk in there i'm going to turn into\nflames i'm like no that's like\nthe best time to actually walk into\nchurch and that's when the angels are\nlike hallelujah\nand i think when i encounter people that\nprobably don't have the best spirit or\nthe best\nattitude i just have a grace for them\nbecause i'm like you know what i don't\nknow the pain that they're going through\ni don't know the darkness that they're\nin\nit might look good on the outside but\nsomething might be going on the inside\nand i just i'm just a little more\npatient and just like\nokay yeah i mean sometimes people do\npress my buttons and i do snap i am\nhuman\nbut um i'm very good about going back\nand be like yo what's going on because i\ndidn't like the\nway i reacted to this and i reacted to\nthis because you pushed me this way but\nlike\ni'm sure something deeper is going on\nyeah no it's beautiful well explained\nyeah yeah i know we've always called it\ncauseless mercy yeah\nyeah sometimes it's causeless like\nyou're feeling that\nlove and kind and support and then you\nstart seeing it in the tough times\nyeah and you start seeing it even\nthrough\nyourself being held when you're like oh\nmy god i can't see anything right now\nyeah exactly\num what was it i mean this is so silly\nbut i watch\nwrestling wwe and a wrestler um\nno way still yes i love it well there\nwas a wrestler that every time he came\nout on stage he got booed\nhe got booed and people were mad because\nhe didn't do a lot of stuff outside of\noutside of the ring like interviews or\nmeet and greets he didn't do anything\nand he just came out in the ring about a\nmonth ago now and he said\ni've been battling leukemia for the last\n11 years\nand i it's back and i can't\nfight anymore so he has to go get\ntreatment again and it really just\ntold me and showed me like you don't\nknow what people are going through so\nyou're\nhe's getting booed on stage and people\nare saying he's the worst\nchampion i don't understand why he's\nwhere he's at but it's like\ni think his name is roman reigns i think\nhe just had a deeper understanding of\nwhat life really meant\nand he when he wasn't in the ring he\nwanted to spend time with his family\ninstead of\ntrying to grow his fame even more than\nwhat it already was yeah and it\nthat put it more into perspective again\nlike some everyone is going through\nsomething you just don't know what it is\nand then\nyou came to that where people were like\noh i'm sorry i didn't know\nyeah exactly and even the other side\nlike i have a\ni have a father figure and a spiritual\nmentor back in london\nwho has been giving himself like a\npastor like giving himself\nto people his whole life like serving\nthe community and thousands and\nthousands and thousands of people\nand recently he got diagnosed with stage\nfour brain cancer oh wow\nand it was just like he never ever\nshowed that he was struggling because he\nwas able to like wake up early and serve\nhis whole life and give himself\nand it's almost like a lot of people\ntook that for granted as well and kind\nof\noverused it sometimes you know what i\nmean like when someone's really\ncompassionate and kind and you're just\nlike oh yeah they're like superman like\nyeah it's like no one ever loves\nsuperman or cares for superman or batman\nor wonder woman or whatever it is like\nthat person is almost just living for\nothers yeah but everyone as humans has a\nlimit\nyeah and then people get mad at him yeah\nuh\nwhen i got back from life-size one of my\ncastmates went through that\nhe had a conversation with me a few\nweeks ago and he was like you know i was\nreally upset\nbecause i had a hard time when i came\nhome\nyou know we were filming in atlanta for\na month and\nwe had a consistent job every day i was\nfortunate enough and i'm grateful and\nthis is the first time this has happened\nto me in 13 years where\nwhen i got back home i had another job\nbut most of my cast mates had to start\nauditioning again\nand we're auditioning while we were\nfilming so it's not even like you can\nenjoy a job\nyou have to already think okay what am i\ngoing to do after this\nso he was like you know i went through\nkind of a depression a little bit and i\nwas\nreally upset that my friends didn't\nreach out to me and didn't check on me\nto\nsay are you okay how are you feeling and\nyou know i have sort of a resentment and\ni said to him i'm like\nare they actors because they're probably\ntrying to figure out their own life\nright now\nyou just got back from a job they\nweren't working that whole time so\ninstead of being frustrated just ask\nthem are you okay\nthis is how you usually act towards me\nyou're i'm not getting that from you\nwhat's going on and you know he didn't\nthink about it that way\nwhich we all do we're so used to even me\nlike sometimes i don't hear from my\npastor\nnot understanding that oh he has to help\nrun a church i'm not his only priority\nyeah everyone's going through stuff and\nhe has two kids you know yeah\nyeah and i always remind people i'm just\nlike you know if you're struggling to\nsee the support from others just realize\nthat most of those people can't support\nthemselves exactly\njust taking care of yourself is such\nhard work such hard work yeah\nand and yeah just recognizing everyone\nhas limits everyone has boundaries\nand sometimes you support so many other\npeople that you don't find the time for\nyourself and then you're\nyou're running on on empty yeah and then\nyou have nothing to give\nyeah exactly exactly yeah no super\nimportant okay i'm gonna ask you\nmy last five big questions okay uh oh no\nit's not\nscary it's just last five minutes last\nfive questions i always do in every\nepisode okay of every podcast\ni want to ask you what's the most\nmeaningful thing you're working on in\n2019\nmendes versus westminster okay awesome\nyeah and we're going to see it in 2019\nno no we're not going to no probably not\nyeah\nyeah i i'm really focusing on finding\nthe right writer to

time oh we've got and\ni just want to get you out okay well\ni've got time um\n2019 we want to travel more um i'm 30\nyears old and i have not traveled much\nand i'm embarrassed to say that because\ni was\ni suffer from fomo fear of missing out\nand i was too scared to leave town\nbecause i was scared of missing out on\naudition\nor i was scared of missing out on a\npossible job or what if\nor a party or this gathering and i\nreally and i'm sad because i'm 30 and i\nhaven't done\nanything i'm like i have nothing to talk\nabout and sometimes\ni'll do interviews and be like what's\nyour favorite place to travel to and i\ndon't have one if i've traveled it's\nfor work so i'm really um 2019 i'm\nlooking forward to like\nsaying okay i'm i'm going to travel and\nthis is\nthis is what i'm doing and i know\nthere's certain actors that have missed\nout on\nreally big movie roles because they\ntraveled but i'm i think\nthey're grateful that they took the time\nfor themselves rather than you know\ngetting that job opportunity which is a\ncareer changer but they also have\nother opportunities to have career\nchangers yeah and you're not old\ni'm not i'm not but i also i hate that i\nhaven't traveled like i've had the means\nto and i just haven't\nit's great now you're just going to make\nup for it yeah now you're going to make\ncoffee yeah and i have someone to do it\nwith everybody now which is which is\na beautiful thing to have yeah like i\nsaid it's exciting that all those\ni don't know before but all those times\nwhen you could have traveled it's kind\nof more meaningful now so\nit is more meaningful now but even\nbefore i was so jealous some friends\nwould go to hawaii by themselves\njust to do yoga and i was like oh i wish\ni could i just could never leave\nand i was just so used to being stuck in\nmy bubble i think part of it was my\nchildhood because my dad didn't let us\ndo anything\nso we were just stuck in our house and i\nthink i\nbreaking free from that was really hard\nfor me like i can't sleep over people's\nhouses i was never\nallowed to do any sleepovers so i i'm\nlike no i'll drive home i'll uber it's\nfine i\ni have to be in my bed oh wow yeah so\nwe're gonna break that one\noh i don't know i like my bed\nsomeone's gonna have to like transfer\nyour bed yeah i can't sleep over\nanyone's house\nyeah cool okay nice okay the\nthird big question was around uh so we\nasked you the most meaningful the most\nfun\nthe third one i was actually gonna ask\nearlier you mentioned a book do you read\na lot\ni try to i haven't read as much as i've\nbeen wanting to because i mostly read\nscripts\nmy favorite book right now is called uh\nredeeming love by francine rivers it's a\nchristian book\ni've read that one four times life\nchanging redeeming love yeah\nbeautiful yeah it's about a story in the\nbible and it's\noh gosh i can't remember their\ncharacters i remember the book\ncharacters not in the bible but remember\nabout the\nguy god told to marry a prostitute it's\nthat story but told from her perspective\nand i've gotten four different messages\nfrom it\nbecause of each time that i've read it\nat first the first time i read it\nbecause i was in such a broken place i\nthought it was a love story\nbetween the two people and i was like oh\nmy god this is amazing they fell in love\nall this stuff and then the second time\ni read it i was like oh\nthis is a love story between her and god\nnot him he was just a vehicle\nin order to get her in a relationship\nwith god which\ni i mean i threw the book i was like\nwhoa and then the third time i read it\nthere's a small part in the book and i\nthrew it again\nwhere uh this book's in bad condition\nyeah it is\num where um one of the characters was\nasking her the lead character name is\nangel\ndid you know you could say no i threw\nthe book\nbecause i was like wow it really\nshe had a choice to say no but she\ndidn't know how to and\nit was just it i learned a lot from it\nand it helped me grow a lot as a\nchristian\nreading this book and as a woman amazing\nthank you yeah\nand and fourth question before we get to\nthe fifth or fourth question\n13 years in the industry all of this\nexperience seeing your family your\nfather what's your advice to young\ncreatives young artists\nactors actresses musicians get used to\nthe word no\nand be okay with it it's a lot of hard\nwork\na lot of hard work and i think just\nenjoy the process of it it's not easy\nyou're gonna have times where you're the\nlead of a tv show and then you don't\nwork for four years\nand don't make it your\nbe-all end-all game have a hobby have\nother things going on\none thing that i wish i did and i didn't\ndo and it's still like\nyou know something i want to do is i\ndon't go to college\nbecause i didn't think i needed to and i\nlet an ex tell me that i shouldn't\nbecause why do you need college it's\nstupid um you're gonna be an actress\nanywhere you're working as an actress\nand so i wish i had other things to fall\nback on\nlike there are other things that i'm\nvery interested in and i you know i put\na lot of my energy in it which helps me\nkind of\nbetter myself as an artist so um have\nother hobbies\nbe okay with no and always study rita\nmoreno told me\nstay in school acting school she goes i\nstill go to acting school and she's in\nher 80s you like always study your craft\njust like a doctor you want them to\nstudy medicine every day and be\nup to game you should study your your\ncraft just as much\nyeah because you're dealing with lives\ntoo yeah exactly i mean\nliterally you have to really understand\nhuman behavior in order to do what we do\nyeah which you have to really open up\nyour emotions and be vulnerable because\nthe only reason i can cry and cue is\nbecause i've\nliterally tapped into the pain that i've\ngone through and i've used it in my art\nit was just painful i love that you said\nthat because i studied human behavior\nbusiness school behavioral science was\nwhat i focused on and and all of my\ncontent all my videos is made from that\nperspective\nlike that's exactly what i'm trying to\ntap into whenever i'm making any of\nin much smaller way than you are but in\nany content that i'm making that's\nalways my goal to really understand\npeople yeah absolutely yeah and the\nfifth question\nwhat did we not talk about that you wish\nwe did that we can talk about next time\num life size two oh yeah wait wait wait\nwait wait wait wait wait wait when is\nthis coming\nright now yes this comes out like\nfebruary oh well it already aired so\nlife size two\num i was able to work with tyra banks\nwho i've admired since i was a little\ngirl on one of my favorite childhood\nmovies\nso check that out let's talk about it\nlet's talk about it we've got a bedtime\nwhat time have we got\nokay okay yeah we got a little bit of\ntime yeah um yeah i uh\ni guess tyra was really looking for this\ncharacter for a really long time a lot\nof people like to say that i replaced\nlindsay lohan i did not replace her this\nis a brand new character\nsince airing in february i can talk\nabout it\nit's known that eve is a doll and\nthere's a doll for everyone and there's\na serial number that's under her foot so\nthis is a new eve doll that comes\ninto my life a broken young woman who\nkind of just needs that\npush to grow up and be herself and you\nknow go through that\npain and kind of grow out of it and eve\nhelps her through that\nand i was very honored that tyra came\nacross\nmy tape somehow like i didn't audition\nfor it and mind you\ni talked about wanting to do a movie\nbefore i was shooting season two of\ngrown-ish\nand i got a phone call randomly one day\nas i'm getting my nails done like hey\nlife-size too are you interested i was\nlike what they're doing another one one\ni was excited but two i was like\nwhat part and it was the lead with tyra\nbanks i was like what\nwhat is my life right now are you joking\nme i would have never thought when i was\n12 years old watching this movie\nso it was really fun working with her\nand getting to know her\nand and just being in atlanta and now\nbeing part of my favorite childhood\nmovies it's\ncrazy to me amazing huge fan and also\nit's the beauty of\neverything we just talked about now like\nfull circle yeah you weren't looking for\nit\nyou didn't audition for it no it i\nwasn't looking for it at all and it's\ncrazy because one of our producers um\nworked on dear white people she was she\nis one of the
