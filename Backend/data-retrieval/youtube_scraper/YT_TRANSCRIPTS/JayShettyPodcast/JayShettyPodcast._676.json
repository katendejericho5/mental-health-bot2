care of myself\nmore working out that's something i\nnever did i gained 30 pounds i gained 30\npounds\nit changed me for the better and it just\nit's just it's built my strength up it's\ngiving me more strength to deal with\nthings\nwhen they don't go my way before it\nwould tear me down\neveryone welcome back to on purpose the\nnumber one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and

sean one of the most successful\nrappers out there\nmultiple number one topping charts\nsingles\nalbums on the billboard but what i'm\nfascinated about him\nis his dedication to personal growth\nhis journey with meditation his focus on\nwell-being\nphysical mental spiritual and emotional\nand today we're going to talk about all\nof that right here on on purpose\nplease welcome big sean thank you man\nthat was a\ngreat intro well it was from the heart\nman i feel it like when i started\nlistening to your music\nbefore i knew about your personal\njourney\ni loved your music and then i saw you\nstart talking about\nwhat you were just speaking about the\nbooks you read the mindset you have\nyeah the journey you've been on\npersonally and i thought\nthis is someone even before we were\nconnected i was like this is someone i\nreally\nwant to get to know because it's not\neasy to talk about the things you talk\nabout\nyeah it's not easy to be vulnerable\nin your position with the career you\nhave in the way you have\nand so i can't wait to dive into it\ntoday but i was going to start with\nsomething a bit different because we we\nhave a few more things in common\nyeah i was reading somewhere that you\nsaid that in another life\nyou might have been a film critic yeah\nand i love that because i love movies\ni was going to pick them i like i don't\npick them apart you know sometimes\nlately i've been watching movies just\nbased on how it makes me feel like i\ntake my critical hat off\nand i'm just like i enjoy the good story\nor you know like the hero's journey or\njust like\nyou know great pieces great shows great\nplots you feel me\nwell it's been a movie that you feel is\nlike defined the way you think\nor moved you in a way that in the way\nthat you're speaking about right now\nthat left a lasting impact\nforrest gump for sure that's one of the\nones that like struck me hard the matrix\ni had like a special relationship with\nthe matrix because neal's\nname was mr anderson so that's my last\nname too so i always like\nstruck a chord with me um definitely\nlike i'm a\nhuge i'm a big nerd so i\nlove like batman i love\nall marvel dc uh anime dragon ball z\nstar wars uh star trek\nuh that's something that really my\nbrother kind of got me into early on\nit's just\nbut what i connected with like\neverything about those things like\ndragon ball\nlike star wars they all have to deal\nwith like that power within\nand i feel like that's why i connected\nto it so much it would be like against\nall possible odds they would dig deep\nand go to a new level that\npeople uh you know not only did not\nexpect them to but was\nwas quote unquote impossible you feel me\nyeah so\nthings like that just always connected\nwith like and i'm still the same way\nit's like\nyou know you think you're going to\noutgrow something but i never outgrew it\nand you know\ni don't care what people think sometimes\nyou know my girl would be like nerd\n[Laughter]\nand i'll be like yeah whatever that's\nwho i have it's who i am\npeople don't expect it because you know\nyou're fashionable and you've got\nand then all of a sudden you start\ntalking about movies\ni can talk about it all day but not just\nthat like i said great movies they\nthey go hand in hand like when i'm in a\nstudio creating like i have a setup\nwhere it's like these screens and i'll\nplay like two movies at once sometimes\njust for aesthetic not looking at him\nbut\nit's just i love it man yeah that's like\ndefinitely a passion of mine for sure\nthat maybe i'll tap into more later on\nin life\nyou know yeah i could see that because i\nlove writing i love stories i love all\nof that yeah have you directed your own\nmusic videos as well right yeah well i\nhave a best friend\nlawrence who we actually did just start\na production company who's directed a\nlot of my big videos\nyeah um a lot of my big songs we won\nsome awards together and things like\nthat but for most of my life music has\nalways been my first priority\nyou know but that is something that has\nalso\nuh gotten me in trouble you know it's\ngot me in trouble\nand i'll explain that a little more\nbecause\nbeing from detroit right and i'm from a\nfamily where\nthey were hard workers my grandma was\none of the first female black captains\nin world war\nii she was one of the first female cops\nin detroit\nand then later she was done being a\npolice officer she was a teacher a\ncounselor\nshe was like a strong woman you know and\nmy granddad too\nthey met in world war ii and he was\nhas a similar story of just being so\nstrong and\ni come from a family where it's like\nhard work hard work you know and\neveryone\nwent to college and it's educated and i\nwas kind of the first in my\nfamily to go on a different career path\nyou know my mom used to always play all\nthese like\nuh motown like she would play stevie\nwonder diana ross all these\nuh the eisley brothers like all always\nin the morning and\ni i kind of fell in love with the music\nyou know but\nmy whole life i remember when i was\ngraduating high school\nand i was graduating with a high gpa i\nwas on my way\nwith a full scholarship to college but\ni wanted to do music i knew and i knew i\nwanted to do music and every time i got\nexcited about it\ni would just i could just tell that it\nwas real you know like i could just feel\nthe connection like i don't care\nwhat anybody could tell me like nah you\ntripping don't\nlike man you know you're gonna be out\nhere with with no\non living on the street man if you you\nknow you gotta you gotta\nplay it safe you gotta have a backup\nplan and all that stuff and\nobviously that is a way for a lot of\npeople but for me it was i put all my\neggs in one basket\ndenied you know my scholarship yeah\nmichigan state\nyeah and it didn't work out at first you\nknow it didn't work out for me\nyou know i was like and that was the\nfirst time in my life where i hit\na very big wall of depression a very big\nwall of anxiety a very a\nvery you know pivotal moment in my life\nwhere\ni just didn't even feel like living and\ni'm and this you know not to be dramatic\ni was 18 years old you know but those\nare they are defining moments in your\nlife and when you're around 17 or 18\nbecause you're around the same time\nwhen you saw that monk speak yeah\nbecause i'm also reading your book think\nlike a monk\nand that's a pivotal moment you know\ncoming out of high school\nand all my friends went to college\ni didn't go you know i ended up meeting\nkanye west right rapping for him this is\nmy idol this was my number one person\nwho i wanted to sign to\nand i felt like i manifested that and my\nmom\nis someone who introduced certain books\nto me that i was reading at the time\nwhen i was around 17\nshe introduced me to esther and jerry\nhicks and\nand also the secret you know the secret\nand um\nyou know she was like you know you can\ndo it like you can manifest it\nand i just believed it i was going to\nask you about that moment from a\ndifferent angle people have heard you\ntell the story\nbut the way you're talking about today\nand also i find like our generation\ntoday is so lost in like procrastination\noverthinking over analyzing but you just\nwent there\nyeah and showed up yes without knowing\nif\nit was gonna go anywhere like you were\nready to be rejected ready to\nfail yeah ready for it to fall flat on\nyour face\nyeah because it was like i couldn't look\nback and wish\ni would have could have should've man i\njust couldn't i just\nfelt like i don't know why and that's\nthat was one of the concepts for one of\nmy albums but i just don't know why i\nfelt like i lived the life already and\nlike regretted it and i was like i just\nfelt that in my heart as a young\nyou know as a teenager so i was like i\ngotta make it happen like that was just\nit\nit was no other option you know and\nshe presented these books to me and it's\nlike she she's like a guardian angel i\nfeel like it feels like\nwhen i look back on it it's like man i\nreally am living with angels you know\nlike my mom my grandma\nbecause they would give me books i i\nwould never read you know\nuh give me books trying to introduce me\nto meditation and all these things but\nit was when\ni felt hopeless\nyou know and i hate that it got to that\npoint but i was young too\nyou know i didn't and i was like i might\nas well just pick this book up i might\nas well just\nlet me just see what's going on with\nthis because\nthis has to work and my when you pick\nthose books up and you crack\nit open you realize that the book was\ntalking to you you realize that these\nbooks have energy and that it's\nattracting you it's not just for uh\nit's not just because for no reason it's\nlike they it's literally there in your\nends up in your hands because it's\ndestiny\nyou know and that's one of the things i\nlearned as soon as i cracked it open i\nremember\nreading the seven spiritual laws of\nsuccess and tearing up\nyou know and i remember reading asking\nand just giving my eyes and jerry hixson\nlike\nfeeling my whole vibration change and\nthat is one of the most\num that is the first time that i\nrealized that there are two realities\nthere's a reality that we see with our\num\neyes and our feel and touch and then\nthere is a reality just as real\nwhere it is our spiritual world that we\ncan create and manifest\nand that is the reality with a capital r\nyou know what i'm saying that's the real\nreality that you bring to the other\nreality\nand so anyway i did these exercises man\nlike i never read i only read books\nbecause i had to in school that was like\nmy thing i could relate you know\nand it was some good books right like we\ni remember we were at animal farm the\nhobby all these great books\nthat helped me but i still never read on\nmy own time\nso these were the first books i read on\nmy own time you know i graduated high\nschool\ni ended up me i ended up meeting kanye\nright before i graduated high school so\ni ended up rapping for him\nit's a classic fairy tale hip-hop story\nyou meet your idol you rap for him he\nhears you out\nand i have been recording cds since i\nwas 11 years old man so i have been\npassing out cds\naround school selling them for five\ndollars three dollars\ni have been participating in open mics\nbattle rapping i had gone to the radio\nstation\nevery friday after school even when you\nknow because when i turned 16\nmy grandmother had a stroke and she had\na brand new car\nso it just it was a bittersweet thing\nbecause it was\ntragic to see my grandma you know have a\nstroke and the strongest woman i've ever\nseen\nliterally get old instantaneously\nand then i ended up getting a car which\nprovided me\nto get places that i needed to get to\nyou know to make uh\nto make the moves i was trying to make\nbecause i was a i had that man that\nhustling mentality i was like\ni had to do it you know eminem was the\nonly rapper from detroit at the time\nthat was doing it big and just to keep\nit real i was i got to represent for the\nfor black\nyou feel me and be like and put on for\nmy city and\ni just felt the responsibility man and i\nknow i'm skipping around a lot\nthat's so good man that's so good yeah\nbut um\ni would do this radio show every week i\nyou know and that led me to meeting\nkanye because he was at the radio\npromoting his\nalbum late registration at the time and\nyou know i met him from doing the radio\nshow there every friday\ni lied and said i left my phone in the\nback offices so they would let me in the\nback to go check because i knew that's\nwhere the artist would go\ni got a chance to rap for him as he was\nwalking out you know he was like i'm\nreal busy\nhow did you have the courage to do that\nbecause i feel like people probably see\nyou\nand they're like i want to go rap for\n like you know people want to\nrepeat all the time\nyeah exactly so how did you how do you\nthink you were able to even\nhave the courage to be like i'm just\ngonna find a way in the hallway\nlike you know when he's walking he's a\nbusy guy well because\nwhen i did that radio show every friday\nwe were wrapped\non the air on the radio yeah that was\nthe most nerve-wracking thing i've ever\nhad to do in my life\nit would be like oh my god everybody\nwho's listening to the radio right now\nis hearing me\nand that was a beautiful platform right\nfor up-and-coming mcs to come in\nand display and um\ni would i would write a new verse every\nweek and i was super nervous\nso i had done that for about a year\nstraight already by the time i met him\nso i was used to rapping under pressure\nright so when i saw him\nand was delivering it it was just like i\nhad so many wraps in my head already\nand i was freestyling and i was used to\ndelivering under pressure so i was able\nto\num dynamically you know i delivered it\nas best i could yeah um\nand he he heard me he heard me out and\nhe was like well you got a cd\nand it's like well yeah because i had\ncds that i was selling in high school\ni had my cds ready i had a buy already i\nhad everything ready\nand it's crazy because ever since i was\n11 years old every single thing i had\ndone so far led up to that moment it all\nhappened\nand it was like yeah i had the cd i had\nthis i had that and he\nfollowed through but it took years after\nthat that's what people don't get it\nwasn't like i rapped for him\nand that was it you know i rap for him\nand thought it was going to be like that\nthat's why i didn't go to school that's\nwhy i turned everything down and then\ni stopped getting a response from him\nand then\nall my friends are in college a whole\nsemester goes by and they're like man\nyou could have came to school would you\nyou still at home\nlike what's up what's up with kanye\nwhat's up with your record deal like\nwhat's up like\nthat's the hardest to hear that's the\nhardest and i come from a family my\ngrandma's like why\nyou know you need to go to school like\nthis is the way to a better life you\nknow she grew up in poverty\nand made her way to that point you know\nand she's like education is the way\nand it was the hardest thing to go\nagainst the grain you know and my mom\nwas really one of the only people who\neven though\nshe was a teacher herself right an\nenglish teacher has her master's degree\nshe\nshe know she knew what it was like to\nhave a dream\nand she knew what it was like to chase\nit you know so she believed of course\neducation is important but you can\nalways go back and get it you can't\nalways\nleave your you know take that chance i\ndid the other way around yeah\nso during that time period for like a\nyear and a half or two\nwhat i did was that was the first time i\nintentionally worked on myself\nand i intentionally would read these\nbooks and meditate every day and\nyou know imagine myself like\nliving the life that i was you know\ntrying to live\nand it just uh\ni don't know how to explain it was like\ni feel like i was there\nand what that did was it put me there it\nreally did to make a long story short it\nput me there\nwhat were the work that you were doing\nwith that meditation and visioning\nbecause i'm sure like you said and i'm\nreally glad\nyou brought it up because before like\nyou said i was at the radio station i\nwas\nyeah i was rapping live i was nervous\nlike what i\nwhat i find is that with yourself and\nand stories like yours there's\nmanifestation but there's also a ton of\nhard work oh yeah\nin the background yes it is tell me\nabout that part of what were you doing\nin the background while you're\nmeditating you're envisioning you're\nseeing yourself there\nwhat's happening with rap music and\nmusic well one of the things that i\nwould do in my meditations is i would\nput out the\nlike i would like let me attract the\npeople\nenergy places wow that i need to go to\nthe next level in my career let me\nattract the people and i would meet\npeople i would meet producers\nand we would lock in and you know who\nhad as common\num belief is mine or like you know the\nsame one like i'm trying to get on as a\nproducer like you trying to get on\nless work right and um i would write\nthings down i would just\nit was just my i treated it like it was\na job\nand also one of the things i had to\nput in perspective is that\nit didn't matter how hard\ni was working necessarily it really\nmattered how\nsmart i was working you know\ni had a perception it is hard working\nright\nbut i had the perception that it takes\nhard work\nuntil i realized that some of the most\nsuccessful people i knew\nwould work a couple hours a day yeah and\nenjoy their life\nyes flowing and at the end of my and me\nand my mom we grew up in debt\nand she worked two jobs and she was\nworking most of her life so it just\ndidn't make sense to me\nyou know early on i'm like it's not\nabout working hard it's about\nworking efficiently and smarter so\nthat's one of the things i\ni really learned at that age too so i\nwould\nit's a big lesson you know because a lot\nof the other people who i would see at\nstudios they would be like man i made\neight songs today like\ni'd be like well i'm still i've been\nworking on the same song for like a week\nand a half\nbut it's not about it's not about that\nyou know it's it's about it's about the\nproduct it's about what you\nwhat you're doing and and and uh\nnot about necessarily how much you're\npumping out you know what i mean\nand that was a that was something i\nreally had to um\naccept because your ego will not let you\naccept that sometimes\nwe've been conditioned right to to think\nall these things\nand that's one i feel like one of the\nthings your book talks about\nwe've been conditioned to\nuh think a certain way we've been\nconditioned to\nyou know we we're given like a certain\namount of of uh\noptions guidance options directions\nyou're supposed to do this you're\nsupposed to do that you're supposed to\nfollow the line you're supposed to do\nthat you're supposed to do that\nyou guys got to do you know the our\nwhole lives\nand a lot of that is just\nsome of it's great but some of it just\ndoesn't apply to everyone\nyou know and that's that's one of the\nthings i had to realize and\nuh re do my foundation of my whole life\nyeah and be my architect well said man\nthat's beautiful\ni love the way you've expressed that\nbecause that must have been an\nuncomfortable place to live\nfor one or two years when you feel\nyou're gonna get your break\nit doesn't happen your friends are now\nmoved on yeah\nand everyone's and i'm still in the same\nbed that i grew up in yeah\nyou know i i was sleeping in a twin size\nbed man\ni'm 18 19 years old you feel me yeah and\nuh it was so frustrating and it was a\ntest of my ego bro\nit was a test of my ego but i was a\nvisual i would\nvisualize kanye reaching out i would\nvisualize\ni just knew that it was gonna happen i\ndidn't know how and like i was i'm gonna\nmake it happen somehow and it just\nit did bro and it's like something you\ngot to trust\nyou know imagine you being on a cliff\nand it's like there's no more cliff\nthere\nbut you like hey man there's an\ninvisible bridge\nyou know if you had a if you had a\nguidance next to you like\nyou had your higher self walking next to\nyou and you're like bro there's nowhere\nto walk and he's like i'm telling you if\nyou\ntake a step it's an invisible bridge\nright in front of you and that takes a\nlot of faith to walk on that bridge\nyeah you know that you can't even see\nbut that's what i had to do because\nthat's\nthat's that's the decision i made i\nwasn't about to\ngo back to school at that moment i\nwasn't about to\ngo back to my friends and be like man\ny'all was right like\ni messed up man you know i i couldn't do\nit you know and that may have been my\nego too but i did let that motivate me\nand um that's just that's just how it\nwent\nyou know and then he did reach out yeah\ntell us about\ntell us about that moment how it felt\ninternally around\nwere you like oh wow this manifestation\nstuff works was that a point where you\ndeepened your faith and belief in the\ninvisible bridge where you were like\noh this stuff really works or do you\nthink you already believed that it\nworked and it was just\nabout trust or was this like a\nconfidence point i had to trust at first\nyeah okay i had to trust it first\nbeautiful yeah\nyou know and that's the thing with\neverything you got to trust it\nand uh\nthen it started working you know things\nnecessarily don't work before you trust\nit it's kind of like you got\nyou know i think that's one of the\nlessons i had to learn\nyou know i had to trust in me trust\nmyself trust the process\ntrust god's speed you know that\nexpression is\nuh so popular for a reason you know you\ncan make all these plans my grandma you\nalways be like man\nyou make all these plans god's gonna\nlaugh at you yes yeah yeah you know\nthat classic saying and she would say\nthat to me and\nso many sayings like that just means so\nmuch more now because it's true that's\nwhy it's so popular\nwhat goes around comes around you know\nall these little things that we heard\nthey're true yeah they're true yeah you\nknow uh\nso it's it's been a beautiful time and\nwhen he did\nwhen he did reach out it was just\nit felt like it was confirmation\nthat that trust uh\nwasn't wasted it's all a higher\npower right and that and that is guiding\nus and wants to support us\nyes and does support us not one student\ndoes support us absolutely did you ask\nhim why it took him so long\nno because you know i knew people who\nwere like 30 40 years old that never got\ntheir shot\nso i'm not gonna be like man took two\nyears\nwhat took so long you know but uh\nyou know and it was a process after that\nand\nthings i'm not gonna sit here and say\nlife is smooth sailing\nnever you know it's it's not smooth\nsailing it's like\na constant unraveling\nexperience right and things don't it's\nbeen so many times where other things\ndon't go my way and i've done all the\nwork and i'm like\nwhy didn't this happen how i wanted it\nto happen and then sometimes\ni didn't expect things to do anything\nand it was\nturns out to be one of my biggest songs\nin my career my biggest moments are\none of my great you know greatest\nexperiences or\nthings that i've like okay i put so much\nenergy and power into this and\nnot do what i wanted it to do like these\nare things that\ni go through on an on a daily basis\nbut i had to realize that it's all\nthe the side of life that i'm on is such\na unique\nside and it's the bless the blessed side\nyeah\nand that anything that happens to me\nanything you know whether i it's all\nit's all love it's all beautiful you\nknow and it's something to be learned\nfrom it it's something to be gained from\nit it's\nyou know that you when you win something\nyou learn something when you lose\nsomething you learn something you know\nyou still win something\nyeah you gain something you know so it's\nit's crazy man\nit's really crazy did you find that when\nyou finally made it into the music\nindustry\nthat there were people like you that\nmeditated that\nwere visioning that were working from\nthis\ndeeper core place did you did you find\nthat or did you find\nthat your spirituality was almost\nthreatened or questioned or\nthere weren't people seeing eye to eye\nhow did you feel about that did you find\nlike it was still natural to\nstay true to what got you there because\nyou had a very different journey\nin terms of internal journey towards\nmusic yeah\ni would see both yeah i would see people\none of the reasons i wanted to sign a\nkanye\nbecause his first album inspired me so\nmuch yeah same thing and\ni can tell that his\nwhether he knows it or not he is he's a\nhe is for\nclearly as a manifestor he clearly is a\nspiritual being too you know or you\ncould call it religious\nto me it's uh you know there are so many\nsimilarities right\num but he is he is somebody who is a\nmanifesto he's somebody who's a creator\nright he's somebody who uh i've saw him\nwield ideas from you know the\ninspiration of god or\nyou know whatever whatever he can say it\nis\nbut that drew me to him you know what i\nmean\nand yeah i've seen it in a lot of people\ni've seen it you know when i sit and\ntalk to jay-z it's like i don't have to\nsit and like\ntalk to him so deeply about it i can\njust tell that he has this you know\nthere are a lot of people who i met even\ndj khaled yeah yeah you know\nhe's somebody who is you know\nmanifesting a manifesto yeah you know\nand his story is crazy\ni don't know if you've ever talked to\nhim i haven't i haven't his story is\ncrazy man and\nyou know it's a beautiful beautiful\nstory and we all have stories\nand there are people who\nlike those are people who you would kind\nof like be like okay i could see that\nbut then there are people who\ni also have met or even janae you know\nyou could tell janae is like very\naware for sure and um\nyou know somebody who is spiritually in\ntune you know what i mean\nyeah that's what that's what i love\nabout this conversation and all the\npeople you're mentioning i think\nwe see a we see an external\npr version of who we think those people\nare on the front cover of magazines or\nmusic videos or\nwhatever it may be but behind everyone\nthere's a deeper story\nit wasn't just like that tell us about\nwhen i'm intrigued because i feel like a\nlot of people listening to us right now\nthey may actually feel blocked\nfrom that envisioning right they feel\nluck like they feel like\nthey're just they're not getting when\nhave you felt blocked or\nif someone's listening and they feel\nblocked\nwhat's blocking them like like how do\nthey remove that how do they let go\nwhat are they needing to let go of well\nthis is deep dawg i had to i had to go\nthere with you\nyou're giving me deep talk so i don't\nwant to you know go to dive in\nwell one thing i have learned on my\njourney\nis that there are blocks that are\nsometimes placed on us from our parents\nor from our surroundings\nand whether you believe this or not i\nbelieve it is true\neven from a past life mm-hmm it makes\ntotal sense because i met complete\nbabies who were like this\nis like an old man in here right he's\nvery mature you know it's like\nbut anyway um i have worked with people\nwho have helped me\nremove blocks from my life marie diamond\nbeing one of them\nyou know and that's a whole deeper\nconversation but she has\num in the last few years as someone who\nhas helped um\nwho has been a mentor to me spiritually\nand helped me along my spiritual journey\nand um\n[Music]\nyou know honestly when i look when i\njust think about\nthe blocks that i've had in my life so\nto go back to that to think about people\nwho are feeling blocked\nknow that you have to believe that you\ncan feel\nunblocked because you're giving it power\nby acknowledging like i'm blocked\ni'm blocked you're putting that out in\nthe universe remember like what we said\nthe sayings that people\nlive by that you've heard what goes\naround comes around what you get is what\nyou give those are\nreal things and you subconsciously and\nthat subconscious mind is\njust as powerful as the conscious one\nhe's ah i'm feeling blocked or\nman i'm just i'm down bad you know i've\nheard people just say all these things\nthat they put on themselves like\ni can't figure it out i can't figure it\nout i can't figure it out\nso okay imagine if you're in front of\nthe universe and god and he's like\nwhatever you say i'm gonna give back to\nyou\nwhatever you say i'm gonna give it back\nto you so you sitting up here like i\ncan't figure it out man i can't\ni can't make money i can't do this i\ncan't\nyou know i just i feel like i it's like\neven when i did feel blocked i never\nand if i did think that i never owned it\nand i'd be like no okay i gotta switch\nthat i gotta i gotta feel better so\nthe first key to unblocking something is\nacknowledging that you are blocking\nyourself\nfor sure you know and i do think there\nare some deeper blocks that you got to\nwork harder on to remove like blocks\nthat\nmay have not even been put there from\nyou so you don't even acknowledging it\nor no\nor know how to um remove it and there\nare special people who can do this you\nknow that can help you get rid of it but\ni do feel like\nyou're blocking yourself and you got to\nrealize that\nstop blocking yourself it doesn't matter\nif you\ndon't have money don't say you don't\nhave money yeah like i got money money's\ncoming in\nright now like who i feel feels good to\nbe rich\nif you keep that mentality and you're\nyou're not rich i sh\npromise you if you really believe it\nwhich you have to believe it because\nyou just have to this if you you know uh\nyou will be whatever you want to be and\nit's never too late to\nbe who you want to be yeah absolutely i\nused to have a mentor i remember used to\nrepeat to me the\nnapoleon hill words of like you become\nwhat you think about\nyeah and and he just keeps saying it to\nme and he told me to keep saying it when\nhe first said it i was just like oh come\non like you know how many times are you\ngonna say it\nit's like a mantra when i first became a\nmonk and they introduced me to mantra\nsaying the same thing every day again\nand again and you're thinking oh this\nain't gonna work\nbut actually what you're saying is true\nthat when you repeat you become what you\nthink about\nyeah and when you keep repeating it it\nbecomes your vocabulary it becomes your\nmindset it becomes your thought\nand then it becomes your reality and and\nyou're spawning i love what you said\nabout\nbeing in front of god and you\nsaying i can't do this i can't do that\nand god's given you back\nexactly exactly what you're repeating\nhe's like you're right man you can\nyeah all right yeah you said it yeah and\nthat is such a great way of thinking\nabout it\nas a conversation around how we're\ncreating our reality\nthrough our repetition yeah i can't wait\nto talk to you about being a monk too\nthat's like when we have dinner next\nweek\nsome but um one of the things that you\nthat made me think about this is when i\nwould come home and watch bob ross\non pbs painting the pictures or\nwhen i would watch michael jordan and\nall these and\nkobe bryant and all these inspiring\npeople\nwhen i was growing up mike tyson right\nor just michael\njackson anybody that i can think of uh\ni like i like our like artwork on the\nwall a few people you mentioned\nare up there yeah yeah but when i was\nthinking about that\nit just brings me back to uh technique\nhow much life how much of life is truly\ntechnique and that is one of the biggest\nsecrets i've learned\num when i was going through one of the\nroughest times of my life a few years\nago\ni just turned 30 and i was feeling so\ndepressed bro\num and i just moved into my house that\ni've been in for a few years\nin beverly hills right slashes i got it\nfrom slash from guns and roses\nyou know all these names all of my\nneighbors are you know vanna white is my\nneighbor i'm like talking like this is\nlike\nto me this was like my dream this is my\ndream neighborhood right\nand i was in the worst condition of my\nlife bro i just felt\ni felt it was just too hard for me to\neven get through the day i felt like\nhow did you get there why did it get\nthere after all of this\nenvisioning focus inner work how did it\nget there\nyou know why i got there because\ni lost touch with it a little bit not\njust because of that\ni burned myself out i wasn't paying\nattention to what myself was saying to\nme\ni was doing it for all different other\nreasons\ni need to do this show i need to do five\nshows so i can get this money\ntake care of this person and do it for\nthis ah my management everybody is\nexpecting me i got all these people\ni got people who are on my payrolls i'm\nlike i'm putting everybody before me\nyeah i didn't know how to balance\num work and\nwork because there's a work that you do\nfor\nyour career and there's a work that you\ndo for yourself yes\nno one ever taught me that because no\none knew no one knew\nyou know no one knew like\nthis is something that my dad didn't\nknow this is something my mom didn't\nknow\ntheir mentality is you work as hard as\nyou can you work as hard as you can so i\ncome from a place where it's like\nyou got to keep the foot on the next you\ngot to keep going hard you don't want to\nlose your opportunity\nyeah that was my thinking\nbut really i had already had it yeah you\nknow i already have it so now to take it\nto another place i got to take care of\nmyself so i can bring my best self to\nthe table\nand it's something that life forced me\nto do\nit's something that life forced me to do\nman and i had to stop everything i was\ndoing\nand completely fall back bro completely\nfall back from\nlooking at things about me from being\nonline completely far back from\nall the obligations i had to do\nperformances money i was losing\nlike it was just like i had to fall back\nfrom everything\nand take some time and that's when i met\nmarie diamond\nand obviously i had no i seen her on the\nsecret i was\nyou know i knew about her and my mom\ntaking one of her classes emailed marie\ndiamond and was like hey my son\nis a musician this and this and this\nand then she got an email back from\nmarie diamond she\nmy mom was freaking out and\nmarie diamond said\nthis is so crazy because my son has\nshawn\non his vision board wow she was i've\nnever worked with a rapper you know i've\nnever done anything like this\nshe's worked with big people you know\nbig big clients\nbut uh anyway uh\nthat was a serendipity you know that was\na meant to be thing and\nit came at a time right where i needed\nit and i just\ni got into the technique of loving\nmyself bro\nbringing it back to the point i said\nearlier when i would look at bob ross\nand michael jordan's all technique\nso much of life is technique what you do\nis technique\nbecause it's you know i had to get into\nthe technique of loving myself\ni had to really make sure that i put\nmyself as a priority my meditations came\nbefore anything\nme writing down my intentions you know\nevery day or every other day\nor you know writing my thoughts down\nlike that was a\npriority to me um spend just spending\ntime for myself being out in nature\nright\nworking uh working i started taking care\nof myself\nmore working out that's something i\nnever did i gained\n30 pounds i gained 30 pounds wow yeah we\ngot to show like a beforehand yeah\nyeah we'll get it we'll get it for this\ncrazy i used to look totally different\nit changed me for the better and it just\nit's just it's built my strength up it's\ngiving me more strength to deal with\nthings\nwhen they don't go my way before it\nwould tear me down before i used to let\npeople's opinions about me\nreally did really affect me yeah same\nand now it's like\nwhat was i even what am i even thinking\nright now\nyou know what i mean you could it's\ncrazy how we can look and see\na comment that's like i love you i\nappreciate you you changed my life\namazing man this guy sucks and we be\nlike man this dude just said i suck\ni'm doing something wrong you know it's\ncrazy how our mind immediately goes\nthere because our ego\nyeah you know or maybe because something\nelse but i think it's just that ego\nit is yeah but but i had to get into the\ntechnique\nof loving myself man for real but what i\nrespect about you is\nis it took courage to get there but then\nit takes courage\nto go deep again oh yeah and so the you\nknow like\nit took courage for you to break through\nand get in front of kanye and\nand build your career and then to be at\nthe top\nand to be at a point where it's like oh\nwow like there's so much opportunity\nand to then go oh wait i need to do the\nwork i need to do the work\nthat takes even more courage because now\nyou have something to lose\nand that's and i respect that a lot\nbecause\ni think when i work with people and i\nmeet people who are\nwho are crushing it it's like when\nyou're crushing it then you go no no\nwait a minute wait a minute i still need\nto get this\nright that shows an even deeper level of\ncourage and insight\nand the fact that you were able to take\nthat step back what made you comfortable\nand confident that you had to seek out\nhelp like your mother was obviously\nsending this email to marie diamond when\nwere you like okay i need to find\na coach a guide therapy like open myself\nup to other ways to help because you've\ndone it fairly yourself\nand through books but then all of a\nsudden it's almost like oh you got to\nagain\neven more yeah yeah because it's an\nongoing process it's an ongoing journey\nright\ni i had no choice for me it was\ni i couldn't get through the day without\nfeeling terrible\nand when you get to that point where\nit's hard for you to just do anything\nyou know uh i knew my perspective was\noff i knew i did and i saw\ni sought therapy too you know i saw a\ntherapist i was\nspiritually working on myself and\nit was just the perspective bro you know\ni used to look at things like\noh i got to do this today i gotta do\nthis i gotta do this podcast i gotta\noh man i'm like overwhelmed but now it's\nlike\nno i don't gotta do that i get to do it\ni get to do this\ni get to be man i get to live this i get\nto wake up man and see this well you\nknow\nwe lost nipsey hustle yeah you know we\nlost\nmy mom's best friend just died um i've\nlost people\nclose to me you know uh\nand it's they don't get to wake up\nnope you know they leave behind kids\nthey leave behind a life right\nand i almost felt like i was being\nselfish because i was not living in the\nmoment\nyou're never living in the moment when\nyou're thinking about\nwhat you have to do you're only living\nin the moment when you're enjoying\neach moment right yeah and uh one of the\nthings that i've learned dog is like\nholding on to grudges that's not living\nin love\nyou know what i'm saying like love\ndoesn't hold grudges\nyou hold on to grudges your ego holds on\nto grudges like\nyou got to just move with love and live\nin the moment and when you do\neverything is a pleasure you know even\nif it's a lot\neven if you can't get it all done even\nif you like i didn't even get to that\ntoday\nit's like at least at least you're here\nat though\nmm-hmm you know i love that switch of\nwhat you said from\ni've got to do this to i get to do this\nthat's\nthat's a beautiful switch in the mindset\nman i think so many of us are always\ni've got to do this next i've got to do\ni think that is such a great i'm def i'm\ngoing to remember that forever like\nyeah i hope so that i hope people really\nunderstand that because\neven if you're down bad to everybody\nwho's down bad right now who's watching\nthis\num you know who has no money right even\nif you don't have a\neven if you're homeless right even if\nit's even if it's the worst situation\nyou don't have a\nascent to your name but somehow are you\nseeing is just remember that\nthis is your opportunity every situation\nis an opportunity\nand you don't got to do more work than\nthe next man you get to do\nmore work than the next man you get to\ntake advantage of your opportunity\nand see a spectrum that people don't get\nto see\nyou know you get to you get to live out\nthe uh levels of life\nthat you know people don't get to see\nyou know people don't get to see the\nbottom sometimes some people are born\ninto wealth and happiness and they don't\nhave to you know you get to\nyou get to struggle you get to be\nstronger yeah you get to lift that\nweight\nand you know you you have strong enough\nmuscles to climb the mountain\nand be the master of your life so i'm\nletting you know\nthat you got what it takes you got it\nyeah i love that and you get to be more\ncompassionate and empathetic\nbecause when you've been there now when\nyou rise\nyou're able to love and be compassionate\nto other people's pain\nbecause you were there yeah and you get\nmore empathy and that's such a gift in\nlife i feel\nto feel compassion to that degree\nis a huge gift because you've been there\nyou know what it feels like\nand that only comes from experience\ntotally and and to have that is\nis a gift in and of itself tell me about\nuh\nyou know now where you at like when we\nlook at you now like you've given us a\nreally\nbeautiful deep dive into these moments\non your story\nwhat is what are you visioning today\nwhat are you working on today what are\nsome of those\ntechniques for love and i love that you\nuse the word techniques i think that's\nsuch a beautiful\njuxtaposition between technique and love\nbecause people often think love is just\nfluid and\nfluffy and right you know but you're\nspot on it's it's a science\nand a spirituality it's uh yes it's both\nit's strategic\nand sincere it's it's both right like i\nfeel\nwe live in this world where i was\ntalking about it with a friend today and\ni was saying that the human mind\nneeds to get better at entertaining the\nidea\nthat two opposites or two things that\nyou think are opposite\nactually is where the magic happens so\nwhen you say\nlove is a technique people go no no love\nlove can't be a technique because it\njust has to be\nyou know pure and flowing but actually\nit starts as a technique\nyes and then it transcends yes right it\nstarts that way tell us about some of\nthe work you're doing\ntoday uh internally and externally that\nyou feel is in line with what you're\nsharing well first of all\ni'm like going through this cleanse\nright now yeah this four month cleanse\nthat's on\nthat food cleanse or no it's a\ncleanse um where you take\ncertain supplements you know you're\ndefinitely supposed to eat a certain way\nit's not a super strict like just\nberries or anything like that it's just\nlike it's kind of like the\nthe diet that i already have which is\nlike i don't do wheat you know\nuh gluten there are times where\ni have no choice sometimes and i even\nhave enzymes that are like to help\nhelp with that but uh so it's you know\nit's not it's not a super strict diet\nbut it's a diet where you know you stay\nin the guidelines\nand i'm taking notes for dinner yeah\ni tell my wife yeah and anyway\nuh i'm doing janae's doing this too uh\nit's a cleanse\nand my mom is doing it a lot of people\nare doing it around me\nuh four month cleanse and you clean your\ngut\nand your intestines and your liver and\nyour kidneys and\nyou clean then you clean out parasites\nand the worms and all these crazy things\nthat you know\nthat that's the stage i'm in now i've\njust i'm in\njust starting my second month out of\nfour months and um\none thing i realized is that when you do\na cleanse like that\nright i've never done one in my life and\ni used to\ni mean at one point especially in high\nschool like every night i was eating\nmcdonald's you know what i'm saying i\nwas getting that double cheeseburger i\nwas getting taco bell i was getting\nburger king white castles like i was\non it that's just because it was just\nwhat we had yeah i would be in the\nstudio at my friend's house or\nre-recording in the basement it's like\nthat's just what it was you know\nand i've eaten so much of that in my\nlife when i was younger\nso i was like i really need to do this\nclean so that's that's one of the things\ni'm doing now\nand i do feel like when you do a cleanse\nlike that also cleanse\nenergetically some of that old you that\nyou've been holding on to for years\nyou know um you learn discipline you\nlearn\nit's always like i feel like there's a\nthere's a beautiful story that you just\nreminded me of from what you said\nuh it's it's in a book called the i\nthink it's called the zen\nof archery so it's about archery\nand a student comes to a an archery\nmaster\na zen master who's also an archer and\ngoes i want to learn archery\nand so the master goes okay let's let's\nlearn archery so they\ndraw a target onto a little piece of\npaper they stick it on a tree\nthey make a little bow out of a twig in\nthe string and they give it to the\nstudent and they give them a little\narrow made out of a twig and they say go\nfor it\nand the person just starts like shooting\ntwigs\nand and they're missing and and then the\nmaster says to the student the master\nsays what is your goal\nlike what's the goal and the student\nsays\nmy goal is to hit that target the\nbullseye to hit right in the middle\nright and the master says so you're\ntelling me\nthat your goal is to shoot a twig\ninto a piece of paper and the student's\nlike\nyeah isn't isn't that what we're doing\nand the master says something beautiful\nthe master says\nthat's your target the goal is to be\ncalm enough\nso that you can hit your target i love\nthat and what you just said now like\nyour target is to change your gut\nand purifying detox but the goal is\nthe discipline oh yeah the nourishment\nthat what you just said like that's what\nyou're really achieving\nyeah in the clans yeah and i think we\nget the goal and the target confused a\nlot\nwe we think that the target is the goal\nbut the goal is to be still and to be\npresent\nthe target's just a way of getting to\nthat goal\nso i love that that you're doing i need\nto join you on that i'm i'm big into\ngut health and realizing how oh yeah\nit's like your microbiomes and\neverything it's like it has to do\nthis cleanse specifically has to do with\nthat and i need to i need to\ni i want you to introduce me to that\nperson afterwards who's managing that\ni'm going to tell you mama myra my mom\nshe is\nshe's the one she is a health everything\ni've ever done with health let me tell\nyou\nanother quick story about health real\nquick please and then you don't have to\ninclude this if you don't want no no i\nhad a real bad injury on tour with my\nknee\nright went to the doctor and the doctor\nwas like man we're gonna have to put\nscrews in your knee we're gonna\nyour cartilage is completely torn down\nand your bones are rubbing together\ni could barely walk my mom was like\ni i don't accept that right so let's go\nto\nthis is the second time in my life i'll\ntell you the first time the second time\nit's happened she's like\ni found this place that does uh stem\ncell research\nand this is how we got hip to the\noxidation of the blood\nuh what they would do is they would\noxidize this blood put it in your\nwherever you needed it right for me it\nwas my knee and it would slowly repair\nthe knee and then regenerate\nthe cartilage with the stem cells\nmy cartilage regenerated in my knee 98\n98 regeneration this is not a game and\nthis doctor told me i had to have\nsurgery on my knee and put screws in my\nknee\nuh and this was a more holistic approach\nyou know this was a more of\na uh eastern i guess yeah you know\nmedicine\nalternative yeah alternative medicine\nand um\n[Music]\nthe other time was when i had heart\nproblems growing up\nyou know i had heart palpitations and it\ngot so bad that\ni couldn't walk from one side of the\nroom to the other side of the room\nwithout being short breath my heart\nyour heart runs on electric currents and\nmine was like beating like this\nweird right anyway i passed out in the\nshower\nwent to the hospital they were like man\nwe're gonna have to put a uh\nwe're gonna have to put up what's the\nthing what is this the shock\nthe pacemaker page we're gonna have to\nput a pacemaker in your heart\nor we can cut half of your heart open\nscar it and the\nelectric currents will run through the\nscars man i went to\nthis doctor who's actually my doctor now\nin michigan and\none of the best doctors in the world dr\nbrownstein\nhe gave me magnesium and a couple other\nthings like make sure you take this\nmagnesium\ni go back a week later or like a week\nand a half later to get prepped for the\nsurgery that we couldn't afford\nthey test my heart and they're like oh\nmy god your heart's fine\nyou know they diagnosed me with the\nwhole disease they diagnosed me and said\nmy heart\ni had a diseased heart and then when i\ngot tested again they were like oh your\nheart's\nreally healthy you have a strong heart\nand i couldn't believe\nhow different i told them like all i did\nwas take this you know i told them like\ni took the magnesium and they were like\nno no way\nthat's that's impossible but it's like\npeople got to open their minds up a\nlittle bit more right\nand just i mean all of us i've had to\nopen my mind up so much in my life\nyeah but um yeah those\nbut i love hearing you talk about this\nstuff i think it's great i think it's\ngreat because i think people would\nexternally just think oh yeah be\nskeptical about this kind of stuff\nno and hearing you say it and you having\nreal experience of it what makes your\nyour mom sounds like the most amazing\nthing no i'm not just saying this you\nshould like yeah with her one day\nyeah maybe come over for dinner and talk\nto her she yeah 100 i'd love to like i'm\nnot even joking like everything you've\njust said to me the books your mother\nintroduced you to the people\nlike i'm fascinated by her story bro you\nknow you get we get lucky right with our\nparents\nthey say that we choose our parents yeah\nyeah for sure i believe that\ni chose the right one yeah my dad is\ncool too\nlet's not get it confused my mom is\namazing yeah my dad is amazing too\num in a lot of ways yeah just not those\nways\nyeah different strengths yeah different\ndifferent strengths\ndifferent teachers for different lessons\nyeah yeah a lot of a lot of personality\ntraits i have picked up from him\nyeah for sure you know he he's somebody\nwho loves\nfirst yeah you know and that's something\nthat you don't get he's somebody who's\nopen-hearted\nuh and very gentle you know what i'm\nsaying\nyeah and he grew up in monroe louisiana\nwhere he had to run for his life and he\nwould get beat up for being black\nyou know and you know he's dealt with a\nlot of pain and trauma\nand one of the things that i inspired\nhim to do was go see therapy\nyou know and that that was one of the\nmost emotional moments for me\nbecause it was like i know him and my\nuncle john\nas black men growing up in louisiana\nand all the stuff that they've been\nthrough you know\nthey've you know my dad told me he felt\nlike i i didn't know that\nyou know he was like i didn't talk to\nyou about certain things because i\nyou know guys aren't supposed to talk\nabout certain things we're not supposed\nto open up about that you know it's\ncrazy as that sounds right because it's\ndifferent now people are more\ncomfortable talking about mental health\nnow people are\nyou know there are discussions there are\npeople who will relate right yeah but\nthat really was a stigma that really was\nsomething that you couldn't talk about\n100\nyou know and it it man it messed him up\nyeah\nyeah yeah yeah he he's still working on\nthat right now totally i mean can you\nimagine holding\nit in for that long and not feeling you\ncan share it and\nbeing told you're not allowed to feel\nthat as a man\nand i mean there's a lot of toxicity\nthat comes with that\nyeah and getting and getting beat up\nyeah i mean that yeah you know he said\nhe would run for his life sometimes man\nlike to make it\npast these train tracks it's crazy man\nthat's insane that's intense\nyeah but that's something that you it\nsounds like from your journey you're not\nyou haven't experienced like that's not\nsomething that you've seen that through\nhis experience yeah it's all in my blood\nthough right yeah\nit's like my grandma's not with me\nanymore but she was a female black\ncaptain in world war ii my god that's\ninsane like that's in my blood yeah you\nknow my mom's blood is\njealous all in me my grandma my other\ngrandma had to pick cotton my dad's mom\nshe picked cotton for a job\nyou know and my granddad's aunt was born\na slave that wasn't that long ago wow\nmy granddad died when i was in the\nseventh grade his aunt was born a slave\nso that goes to show you it's not that\nfar removed it isn't right yeah\nas i have on my uh black and proud shirt\nyeah yeah yeah\ni love it yeah no but i love i love how\nyour experience explaining the story of\nyour background and each person\nyeah in your history and and you're spot\non that\nof course they made you so yeah all of\nthat is\nis part of your story yeah just like\nyour parents you know what i mean it's\njust like everything\nyeah and you know your ancestors like\nthey are really a part of us\nfor sure they really are for sure you\ngotta and\ni had to accept that that they guided me\nand that when things don't work out it's\nbecause they are working out better than\ni\ncould even imagine you know when it does\nwhen it doesn't go the way that i\nplanned on it going whatever it is\nit's not that it's not working out it's\nthat it's working out better than i can\neven comprehend\nyeah if my plans worked out the way i\nwanted them to work out\nmy life would be lame compared to\nwhat it is today you know it wouldn't\neven be you no 100 i wouldn't at all\nlike i i think about if my plans worked\nout the way i wanted them to work out\noh my life would be nowhere near as good\nas it is\nno no and that's the thing that you hold\non to we hold on to our little plans\nand we keep chasing them and we keep\nthinking that they're the only way and\nso when a new opportunity or a new\nportal comes up\nwe're scared of walking through that\nportal but that portal is\ni know our greatest journey\nand you've taken it and now you're\nsharing through your music i read that\nrolling stone said\nyour latest album was like a self-help\nbook yeah\nand i was thinking how amazing that you\nknow how amazing that your journey and\nstudy of so many powerful teachers and\nbooks and your own work and your own\nuh growth journey your own purification\nand now you're sharing it through music\ndo you feel\nnow that you're at a place where your\nmusic is\nis allowing you to share all of that\neven more than ever or\ntell us about that journey with music\nbecause your purpose is to change\npeople's lives through music\nyeah my purpose is it's to inspire you\nknow through anything i do\nso whether it's music or a book right\nwhich i haven't written yet but yeah\nit's coming i've been thinking about it\nyou have to yeah it's uh it's something\nthat\ni wanted to just look back on my life\nand be like\ni did all i could in a moment when\npeople not just like me but just people\nwhoever needed it\nyou know at least i said it because it's\na\nit's a lot of music out there yeah it is\na lot of music out there there's a lot\nof music that sounds the same out there\nthere's a lot of music that sounds\ndifferent too\nyeah because it's just tons and tons and\ntons of music\nso i have to represent my mindset at\nleast\nat that point in my life i try and do\nthat with all my albums but on top of\nthat\ni don't want to sound like i'm preaching\ni don't want to sound like true\ni'm talking down or you know i want to\nsound like i'm talking to someone so i\ndo have records that are fun\nyeah you know because i am uh you know\ni am not nobody's perfect\nyou know what i mean all of us none of\nus\nyeah so i you know i you know i i one of\nthe things that i realized\nis that okay i got to make sure i have\nthe balance of having fun in my music\nyeah you know and yeah\nmy next album won't sound like my last\none and one before that doesn't sound\nlike\nyou know the next one you know it's just\nit's always changing up so\nthat's the it's like a picture right\nit's like you can you can like okay\nthis one i'm gonna really paint what i'm\ngoing through right now this one i'm\njust gonna\ncompletely talk about last night when i\ngot drunk you know what i mean\nit's like it's just it comes from all\ndifferent inspirations\ni love that yeah it was i i found that\neven and you're reading think like i'm\non\nright now but when i was writing that i\nwanted to share\nmy weakest points as a monk so i don't\nthere's not many examples in there where\ni share the best days\ni share all my worst days yeah i share\nmy worst meditation\ni share my biggest criticism that i had\nof people around me\ni share my worst uh train journey my\nlike in the book i was like i want to\nshare the worst days wow\nbecause the eas the big days are the\neasy days to share when like i felt\nenlightened and i\nyou know when i had a moment like those\nare easy to share\nright but to share like you know what i\nused to wake up and i hated waking up at\n4am like to share that\nfelt like the right thing to share\nbecause of what you're saying we all\nhave bad days none of us are perfect and\nhave it all figured out and\npeople relate to that right yeah and\nalso you like i feel like\nthat was that's just the truth that we\nneed to hear\nbecause like i was speaking to a friend\nyesterday\nand he was saying you know i feel scared\nabout my future\nand my financial future and this and\nthat and whatever it was\nand i was like dude i i relate like\neveryone feels like that like there's\nthere's no one who\nand as soon as you hear that you go oh\nokay it's okay\nwhen you hear that someone else feels\nthat way i know when people are going to\nlisten to this\nthey're going to go and felt\nnervous rapping yeah like\nwhen you hear that that's oh okay it's\nokay to\nfeel nervous and still do something yeah\ni think a lot of people feel they have\nto feel confident\nto do something yeah when actually most\nof us do things\nwhen we're nervous yeah and you know i\nbro i wake up\nstill totally messed up sometimes i feel\nthere are times where you know i do feel\nvery\nlike down and depressed my vibration is\nlow but\ni'm able to approach it and react to it\ndifferently\nand i'm able to not let it stick on me\nyeah you know one of the things that\nmeditation\ndoes for me it's like it's like when you\nwork out or like\ndo something like go on a hike or\nsomething and you take that shower yeah\nand you just like are clean yes that's\nwhat meditation does for me it\nenergetically literally just cleans me\nand i feel like\ni'm ready it's like having a full\ncharged\nphone it's like i'm ready for everything\nnow i'm charged up\nand uh bathing your soul yeah and people\nhave a lot of misconceptions about\nmeditation you know\nyou have to understand that there's no\nwrong way to meditate\nthere's no wrong way it's not wrong even\nif your mind races\nand you get better at bringing it back\nto your center if you get better on\nfocusing on your breathing right\nyou don't you can't do it and think\nyou're doing it wrong because\nthere is no wrong way to do it you're\ngonna get into a groove the more you do\nit\nthat works for you because it's for you\nit's not for everyone\nelse this isn't like something you get\ngreat it's not like a math test\nmeditation is a personal um\nyou know a moment that you share with\nyourself\nyou know and that brings you in the\nmoment and your mind does race right you\nthink about things you may visualize\nthings\nand but you come back to the moment so\nmeditation for me\nthat's what it is you know and that's\nthat's one of the biggest misconceptions\nwhere i go to these studios i'm talking\nto like\nyou know any i could be talking a little\nwayne i could be talking to like\ni'll definitely be in studio sessions\nwith people like my brother wayne and\nbeing like\nman like so you taking any vitamins or\nlike what's you know\ni'm not even playing like you know you\nknow they look at me crazy sometimes but\nit's just like i do care\ni love that i love that guy you know i\nlove my brothers i love\nwe hit i'm in the studio with hit boy\nwho's one of the greatest producers\nright\nand um i mean you know i'm telling he's\nlike yo help put me on like\nyeah you know i'd be telling him what\ni'm doing he's like yo i want to get\ninto that like\nand there's no wrong way of doing it i\njust want to put that out there there's\nno wrong way of doing it\ni love i love that you're an ambassador\nfor meditation it's\nit's awesome seeing you talk about it in\nsuch a genuine way\nand i love what you just said that\nmeditation is not a math test\ni mean that is the problem with the the\nconditioning\nthat everything's a test everything's\nright or wrong everything's you know\nand and you're so right that you just\nhave to let go of that when i'm sharing\nmeditation with people\noften i find that especially if they're\nmusicians it's like they\nthey want to get the music right or the\nsound right right it's free of that like\nmeditation\nis i mean i'm tone deaf and uh you know\nyeah and\ni can't sing to save my life i love\nmusic but i can't sing to save my life\nbut\nit's meditation's beyond that like it's\nbeyond the\nmental verbal capacities that we have\nbut uh it is that's that's one of the\nthings\ni do uh write stuff down yeah since 2019\nthough i've also been like let me do one\nthing\nevery year that's going to change my\nlife\nyou know how people we have like new\nyear's resolutions so uh\nin 2018 that's when i started really\ntaking\nbetter care of myself right so i was\nlike 2019 my number one goal\nis to take care of my temple take care\nof my body\ntake care of my mind body because it's\nconnected right absolutely so i'm a\nworkout\nand i transformed my body 2019. 2020\nand and by the way i keep these i keep\nthese\none in introduction of something new\nevery year i keep that in my\num you know my daily practice\nyeah it's a habit at that point i create\nthese new habits\nnew habits and 2020 it was like okay\ni want to put all these things into this\nalbum that was my number one priority\nlike i want to create something for\npeople who really need this right now\nright yeah and\nwhile doing all the things i i kept from\n2019 2021 i've been taking voice lessons\nwow so i've been taking voice lessons\nwith my vocal coach peter\nand because i realized that\nnot only do first of all i listened to\nmy old music and my voice has changed so\nmuch\nwow and i'm like okay my voice has been\ngetting stronger right\nso i'm gonna strengthen my voice because\ni can harmonize i can sing not for real\nbut\nyeah i do feel like i have a voice\nthat's hidden in me a little bit right\nyeah\nto not only sing but when i strengthen\nmy voice\ni also feel like it strengthens my voice\nfiguratively\nand even so i started that in january\nthis year\nand it's been helping me a lot it's just\nbeen strengthening\na lot of other things because really\nyour voice this is a shot this chakra\nright here\nfor sure has been getting strengthened\nyou know and this chakra\num which is your you know your solar\nplexus and uh\nit's just been strengthening here for me\nyou know\nand meditation really strengthens hair\nfor me and it also strengthens\nmy roots yeah and my root chakra no uh\nmy third eye shack my crown chakra you\nknow a lot of that but i\ni needed work on my throat chakra you\nknow\nmy heart chakra you know that's another\nthing that i've had to work on\nso that's you know that's just one of\nthe things i'm doing i love it man yeah\ni'm feeling uh first of all i'm feeling\nvery grateful and humbled for the\ngenerous time you've given me today\nyeah i'm feeling i'm having fun i'm\nfeeling uh\ni'm feeling totally uh i've learned so\nmuch and i feel so inspired just\nsitting here listening to you speak and\nand hearing about your journey in detail\ni mean\ni'm being honest i'm being honest i i\ngenuinely do and homer knows i don't\nsay that all the time so uh you know he\ncan vouch for me for that\nyeah uh but i mean that because i i can\nsee how much\ngenuineness and how real this journey is\nfor you and\nhearing about your mother is blowing my\nmind because i'm thinking wow what\nwhat a mother you know to have that yeah\nshe's she's amazing\nyeah amazing it's really beautiful and\nspecial but uh we we end every one of\nthese episodes with\na fast five okay you may have seen janae\ndo this\nuh so this is final five questions where\nyou have to answer it\nuh with one word to one sentence maximum\ncatching so it's\nit's tight and it's tight you're\ndropping the bars already so it's\nit's easy it's easy for you all right\nyeah so the first question for you is\nuh what's the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nit can be a sentence of course\nexperience\nit's the best advice i've ever received\nis experience\nthat's a great answer we never had that\nbefore i love that okay what's the worst\nadvice you've ever received\nyou know what you know what jay yeah\nit's like i block it out yeah you don't\neven remember hold on to it\nyeah you know i've gotten terrible\nadvice my\nso many times i can't even remember i\nlove that that's a great answer man\nwe're good with that we're good with\nthat okay question number three\nuh what's something that you know to be\ntrue\nbut you feel other people might disagree\nwith you on or they're not there\nlike they don't fully get it yet what's\nsomething that you're so\nsure about but other people would not\nreally get it\ni can make a list\nmeditation yeah um\nmention past life ancestors yeah\nuh guiding you past life uh\nblocks removing blocks\nuh that's a lot that's good yeah\nquestion number four what's the biggest\nlesson you learned in the last 12 months\nthe biggest lesson i learned in the last\n12 months\nyou can't kill your ego tell me more\nabout that that's something we should\ntalk about\npeople always talk about ego death and\nyou can't kill it why would you want to\nkill a part of yourself anyway\nyou have to just know how to work with\nit and how to treat it\num you know people always say your ego\nis the most childish part of you\nbut then i also hear that children are\nthe most\nspiritual beings because they have no\nrestrictions that have been set on them\nthey're\njust purely right from the source right\nyeah\nso there has to be a connection between\nthe two and i think your ego\nis an unfiltered um\npart of you that is easily affected and\nvery emotional\nvery sensitive and it's something you\nshould embrace\nyeah instead of trying to get rid of it\nlock it in a room you embrace it and\nrecognize it for what it is\nand when you do and when you nurture it\nin that way\ni think it won't be as a dramatic of an\noutlash\nand that's damaging to you if that makes\nany sense\nthat makes sense to me sometimes well\nwhen i was listening to you what i was\nthinking about was\nsometimes your ego just needs a big hug\nthat like when you just embrace it\nthat's what i'm saying you know and i\ndon't feel ego from you today you know\nfrom the moment you walked into\nmeeting my team and you know it's like\nyou don't i don't feel a sense of\narrogance of bravado in your presence at\nall\nthank you which which just shows that\nyou've just embraced it you\nyou know you get it there and and i like\nthat that's what came to my mind when\nyou were speaking and also when you took\nmy children\ni was thinking you know we we want to\nbecome more childlike and not\nchildish and i think that's the you know\nwhat you were saying there like\nbeing childlike is great like childlike\nis like fresh new\nbut being childish is like tantrums and\nyou know being\nyou know yeah seeing a child like it's\nlike not\nputting any ceilings on yourself you\nknow yeah one like one of the things\nthat we do is grown-ups just like oh\nthat sounds a little crazy or that yeah\nwhen you're a kid i want to be an\nastronaut yeah i'm going to climb that\ntree\nyeah i want to do this you know i want\nto be and it's like they\ndo it yeah and to as much to their\ncapacity but\nthat's something we lose when we grow up\nso um\nyeah i love that childish versus\nchildlike\nyeah you know and that's the same as\nbeing selfish\nin self-care yes and i used to get those\nconfused\nyou know and that's one of the reasons\nwhy i felt like i probably stayed so i\nburnt myself out as far as like\ntrying to do too much is because i\nthought that it was selfish\nof me to be like oh i need to take time\nfor myself yeah\nyou know instead of doing this work i\nneed to do i'm going to get a massage\ntonight i thought that was selfish to me\nbut that's not selfish that's self-care\nthat's self-love\nand you got to know the difference\nbetween the two absolutely you know\nselfish\nis when it affects um\n[Music]\nthe people you love or people around you\nor certain people um in a negative way\nright\nuh you're doing something for a wrong\nreason but when you're just taking care\nof yourself\nto to to be better for those people yeah\nand that's that's self-care yeah i love\nthat that's such a great definition and\ni\ni just hope everyone who's listening and\nwatching this i hope you're taking notes\nbecause\nthat differentiation can actually change\nyour life\nbecause when you give up your self-care\nin the short term to think you're being\nselfless\nthen in the long term you end up having\nto be selfish because it pushes you back\nthat way so\nyeah you're spot on that we have to and\ni\ni can relate to that so much because\nthere was a time in my life where i was\njust extending myself to others\nand i used to think that getting a\nmassage eating well eating on time\nright all of that stuff was bad and now\nit's like i realize well i can't give\nmyself\nor i'm giving people the worst leftovers\nof myself\nwhen i haven't taken care of myself i\ndon't want to give the people i love my\nleftovers but\nthat's what i'm giving them because\nright i've drained myself\nso i love that differentiation all right\nfifth and final question\nokay yeah we were doing it no that's\ncool that's correct yeah you know i\nwanted i asked you i asked you you were\nfollowing the rules but i was like when\nyou said\nthat we have to kill our ego i was like\noh okay i want to know so that was good\nit was good\nfifth and final question is if you could\ncreate a law\nthat everyone in the world had to follow\nwhat would it be\nto not judge um\n[Music]\nyeah not to judge because uh\nhere's the difference everyone has an\nopinion right\nand that's fine you know and\ni remember just going to church and you\nknow people being like only god can\njudge you right yeah\nbut we are all humans and when we judge\neach other\nuh it brings us down man it traps us\nright it's like\nand what you put out there is just gonna\ncome right back to you\nabsolutely you know it's like a\ndouble-edged sword so you're judging\nsomebody like you\nmessed stuff you're wrong this is not\ngood what are you doing like this is not\ngood\nbut that's coming right back to you\nwhether you know it or not and it could\nbe different ways right\nbut to me you can have an opinion\nright and that that's that's a thin line\ntoo between an opinion\nand judging but and a\njudging is when is when you go out your\nway to\nto make somebody feel a certain way\nright and that's something that's become\nso accustomed\nto our society as we judge each other\nwhen really i don't even know if we have\nthe right to judge each other\nyou know we're all made in the image of\ngod\nright and uh\ni don't know if uh judging each other is\nproductive\nnecessarily you know i just don't think\nit's productive i think that it's the\ntime that you could have spent on\nsomething else and if you don't like\nsomething that's different\nyou don't have to comment on it you\ndon't have to judge it you can just be\nlike cool\nlike yeah you know and let it go and put\nthe energy on something you like\nyou know let it go or i think when you\nbring somebody down though\nyou're bringing them down but you can't\nbring anything down without going down\nyourself it doesn't even\nmake any sense absolutely absolutely\neveryone big sean\nthank you for doing this man yeah yeah i\ncan't shut up back we got to do like a\npart two\ni know i mean i can carry on talking to\nyou but yeah yeah yeah like we could say\nbefore another time yeah\nyeah no this has been amazing man like\njust\nhearing you share your heart and your uh\ngenuine purpose with us today like i've\nloved every bit of it it's been so\ninspiring\nand i've learned so much and\ni mean that i mean that from the bottom\nof my heart and i recommend that\neveryone goes and listens to this again\nand and takes notes write stuff down\nbecause there are so many gems in what\nyou shared\nuh that can be truly powerful for people\nat different stages of their life\nbecause you just walked us through\nthe hero's journey yeah and and your\njourney of course still continues as you\nknow\nbut there's so many parts of that and uh\ni want to i want to ask you though is\nthere something\nyou wanted to share today that you feel\ni haven't let you share or that you\nhaven't\nhad an opportunity to get through\nbecause i want to get there i don't want\nto\npre prematurely you know give up so no\nuh if there's something on your mind\nthat you're like oh i feel like i need\nto share this with people well i do want\nto just share that\ni go through terrible days\ni go through dark moments i go through\ngreat days i have\ngreat moments and you know it's not like\ni figured life out\nyou know i i don't think anyone on this\nearth has\never figured life out all the way i\nagree and i don't think it's for us to\nto figure out you know maybe there are\nother purposes for it but i just want to\nput that out there and say that\nyou know you're not alone like whoever\nyou know whoever needs to hear that like\nyou just you're not alone\nyou know obviously\njay shetty got you i got like we're all\nin this
