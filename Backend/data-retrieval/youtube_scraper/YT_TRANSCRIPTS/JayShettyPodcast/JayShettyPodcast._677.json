    "transcript": "in that moment in the supermarket that i\nstand and i see these two brands and how\nto choose\ni choose this bread the mystery of the\nuniverse it isn't the mystery of the\nuniverse\nwe know today a lot about what's really\nhappening\nin your brain in your mind when you make\nthis choice\nand it's increasingly becoming easier\nand easier to manipulate\nthese choices thank you everyone for\ncoming back to on\npurpose the number one health podcast in\nthe whole world thank you for making us\nthe number one podcast in the world it\nmeans so much to me i'm so\ngrateful for all your love all your\nengagement and most importantly for\nchoosing education for choosing\nenlightenment for choosing empowerment\nover everything else in the world you're\ntaking out your time right now\nwhether you're walking your dog you're\nat the gym you're commuting to and from\nwork\nthank you for taking this time to invest\nin yourself\nnow today's guest is someone that i've\nbeen looking forward to for\nsuch a long time so i'm so happy i'm so\nexcited that he's\nfinally here his name is yuval harari\nyou've probably seen it\nin every bookstore in the world if you\ntravel at\nall or if you ever walk into shop you\nwill have seen it\nhis amazing international best-selling\nbooks\nsapiens homodeus and 21 lessons for the\n21st century\nhe's also a two-time winner of the\npolanski prize which he won in 2009\nand 2012 for his originality and\ncreativity and today we get to dive into\nhis\nincredible mind and find all of these\ninsights that he shared yuval thank you\nso much for being here today it's great\nto be here i'm grateful that\nyou allowed the opportunity no i'm i'm\nso excited i genuinely was so looking\nforward\nto this discussion because the\nit's not only about the success of your\nbooks what you've been\nspeaking about in your books have dipped\ninto so many different parts of\nmainstream culture\nand i love that how a thinker like you\nhas been able to do that in today's\nincredible world so congratulations\nuh for everything that you've done and\ni'm hoping this is the start of a new\nrelationship for us as well\nyeah but i'm going to get straight into\nit okay\nand i want to start off talking a bit\nabout happiness because happiness is a\nbig theme\nfor my audience it's something that my\naudience cares a lot about\nand i picked out something that i wanted\nto read that you say in your book and\nyou say\none of the chapters in your 21 lessons\nfor 21st century is\nhappiness equals reality minus\nexpectations\nright happiness equals reality minus\nexpectations and i want to dive into\nthat\nbecause i want to ask you how should we\nset\nexpectations we all have expectations i\nhave expectations doing this podcast i\nhave expectations\nwhen i'm thinking about when you think\nabout anyone investing in their job they\nhave expectations when someone starts a\nrelationship they have expectations\nwhat is your take on how we should form\nset and create our expectations for\nhappiness\noh that's a big one to start with yeah\ndefinitely um\ni think that we need to\nuh we need to relax control a bit\ni mean not to i mean not to say to\nourselves these should be my\nexpectations\nthe first step is actually to\nfamiliarize yourself\nwith what you already expect and with\nthe internal processes\nthat have generated these expectations\nbecause usually we know almost most of\nus know extremely little\nabout really what's going on inside us\nand about what forms our opinions our\ndesires\nour expectations there is a general\ntendency to identify\nwith whatever pops up in your mind and\nwe are encouraged\na lot by our culture and by the\nkey ideologies of the age whether it's\nliberal democracy whether it's\ncapitalism consumerism\nto just identify with our inner voice\nwith our um you know all these slogans\nthat\njust just do what feels good just\nconnect to your heart and all these\nthings and\npeople mistake it to mean just\nidentify just look inside you and the\nfirst thing that comes up\nidentify with that and\nmy my advice would be to really\ntake the time to explore what is\nhappening inside you\nand where do all these things really\ncome from\nso much of our expectations and our\ndesires\nthey don't reflect any inner true self\nthey reflect um a million manipulations\ndone on us either by external forces\nor even by internal forces that we know\nso little about\nso before we reach the point when like\nwe write ourselves the list of items\nthis is my agenda for life this is my\nexpectation from life\ntake a take time a long time to first of\nall familiarize with yourself with what\nis actually happening inside\nyeah absolutely i i think your sport on\ni completely agree with you i\nwas sharing with you earlier that i was\ntraining to become an investment banker\nand\nwork in business growing up and then i\ngot to a point where i looked at that\nand i was like\nis that even me like why do i even want\nto do that and i realized because\nin the part of society that i grew up in\nthat was the most glorified role\nso the people that i was surrounded by\nhad made that seem as the peak\nrole or job that someone in our society\ncould attain\nand so actually it wasn't my goal or\ndream it was just the dreams and goals\nof people around me yeah is that what\nyou're referring to about how we\nthere are a million ways in which we're\nforming our dreams and goals\nyeah that's part of it yeah you know\nthat's that's a very old story\nthroughout human history you're always\ninfluenced\nby your friends your family the culture\naround and\nmuch of what people took to be their\ninnermost desires and expectations\nit actually came from outside today it's\neven more\nextreme because we are increasingly\nacquiring technologies that enable\nexternal\nagents whether corporations or\ngovernment or whatnot\nto really hack the the human mind and\nhack the human brain\nand manipulate us in ways which were\nnever possible before\nwhich makes uh it's even more urgent\nthan ever\nto really get to know yourself um\nyou know the the advice know yourself\nit's the oldest advice in the book\nyou go back thousands of years you meet\nsocrates or buddha or confucius this is\nwhat we'll tell you get to know yourself\nit's the most important thing in life\nand\nbut there is something new today what's\nnew today\nis that for the first time in history\nyou have real competition\nif in the time of buddha you didn't make\nthe effort\nto know yourself nah i'm too busy so you\nmissed enlightenment\nbut you didn't\nyou you didn't face any competition out\nthere\nbecause the kings and the aristocracy\nand the merchants in the time of buddha\nthey couldn't get in your head\nbut today you have real competition you\nmay not have the time\nto get to know yourself because you're\ntoo busy i'm too busy with the family\nwith the work with whatever but there\nare people\nwho have the time and the money to get\nto know you\nthat's their business to really get to\nknow you their entire business model\nis based on that or their entire\npolitical model is based on that\nand and so you now really have\ncompetition\nfrom these corporations and governments\nand it's it's a very simple\nequation or a very simple idea if they\nget to know you\na little better then you know yourself\ngame over they can manipulate and\ncontrol you\nand you will not even realize it because\nthe easiest people to manipulate\nare the people who believe in free will\nthe people who believe\nthat their thoughts and desires and\nexpectations they reflect some authentic\ninner self and they don't question is is\nthis really the case\nright right right so how much does that\nperson have free will\nhow much do you think a person does have\nfree will i would say\nas a first approximation extremely\nlittle i mean i don't want to delve too\ndeeply into the argument about the\ntheoretical possibility of free will\nuh if you if you want we can go there i\nwant to go wherever you are\nbut uh but as a first approximation i\nwould say\nthat even if you believe that free will\nis possible theoretically in some\nsituations\nyou should at least acknowledge that 99\nof decisions don't reflect your free\nwill\nthey reflect something else so i don't\nmind even consenting the philosophical\npoint let's say that there is free will\nbut\nfree will is not something you have free\nwill is something you need to struggle\nfor\nand the the the wrong idea about free\nwill\nis that i have free will any thought\nthat pops in my mind\nany desire that i have this is my free\nwill so it is\nsacred and it represents something\nsublime and this is nonsense\nthe that is this is not the case\nmaybe if you work really very hard you\nwould reach a point\nwhen at least some of the decisions in\nyour life\nwill reflect freedom but it's not\nsomething you can just\ntake for granted now there are a lot of\nforces in the world\nwhich encourage us to have this\nsimplistic\nidea that anything that pops in the mind\nis the reflection of my free will it\ncomes\nmost notably in the economic sphere from\nthe whole consumerist and capitalist\nsystem\nwhich it's built on the premise that the\ncustomer is always\nright i mean you know when you talk to\nthe big corporations\nor to some business magnets and you ask\nthem about their practices and about\nproblematic things they do\nthey their final line of defense\nis always the customer is always right\nyes we are doing these things but the\ncustomers are buying it\nand the customers are the number one\nauthority this is their free will\nif the customers want it who are we\nor who is you to tell the customers that\nthey are wrong\nare you some big brother that knows\nbetter than them so this is like the\nfinal line of defense the customer is\nalways\nright and this is based in a way on the\nidea of free will\nthat the will of the customer represents\nthis sublime i don't know force\nthat manifests itself through your\ndesires like i want\nthis brand of conflicts ah amazing\nthat's\nhuman free willing action and it's the\nthe mystery of the universe manifests\nitself\nlike in that moment in the supermarket\nthat i stand and i see these two brands\nand how to choose\ni choose this bread the mystery of the\nuniverse it isn't the mystery of the\nuniverse\nwe know today a lot about what's really\nhappening\nin your brain in your mind when you make\nthis choice\nand it's increasingly becoming easier\nand easier to manipulate\nthese choices and again the easiest\npeople to manipulate\nare those who think that when they\nchoose this brand in the supermarket\nthey are exercising their free will\nabsolutely absolutely and it's\ninteresting\nyou say that before i go into the\nquestion i'm taking off a tangent was\nhow some of the biggest creators and\ninventors in the world\nhave not thought customer first so when\nyou think of people like steve jobs or\neven henry ford\ni think it was henry ford who said that\nif i asked people what they wanted they\nwould have said faster horses\nright and and so he said i didn't ask\npeople what they wanted and steve jobs\nwould often say that too as well that\nyou are creating\nbecause the audience doesn't actually\nknow what they want but so some of the\nmost powerful\ninventors have actually gone the\nopposite way but in regards to that\npoint that you're making there at the\nend then what does one do\nand i agree with you you're saying that\nthe person who becomes the most fooled\nor deluded is the one who believes that\nthey have the most\nchoice and free will yes so what do we\ndo what does an individual do in that\nscenario in this\ncrazy information filled world where i\nwas saying that the other day that you\nknow before we were targeted by\nbillboards which was only if you drove\nand then it was the television which\nagain you had to own one\nand you only spent a few hours a day and\nthen it was the internet\nwhich you still needed a computer and a\ndial-up connection and now it's all the\ntime right\nso what does one do when they're being\nbombarded with all of that information\noh take time off is that they\nlike the best advice i i can give you\nknow that the first\ntake time off it's extremely important\nduring the day\nduring the month during the year um\ni don't believe in in i mean i i don't\nthink we can or should\ncompletely disconnect i mean we are now\nhaving this conversation we\nhope that millions of people will see it\ni have nothing against\nyou know social media on the internet\nthey have done wonderful things\nfor humankind i don't know i met my\nhusband online\nin a dating uh site that's awesome so\nyes so i\ni've some of my best friends are\napplications\nso i have nothing like inherently\nagainst them\nbut not all the time the first thing is\njust take time off\nthen you ask yourself what do i do in\nthis time off\nso i would say different things probably\nwork work best for different people\nlike i meditate i do video meditation\nother people\nthey do different kinds of meditations\nsome people find that\nout is much more it's a much more\neffective way for them\nto explore the in a reality for some\npeople it could be sports or going\nhiking in nature\nmany things but i would say two things\nin in general about all these things\nwhatever works for you do it quickly\nbecause you don't have much time i mean\nthere is\nthis race going on as we now talk\nthere are these corporations and\ngovernments that are busy\ntrying to hack you and you need to stay\na few steps ahead of them so that's one\nthing which was never the case before or\nwas was less the case\nleft before and the other thing is\nit won't be so much fun\nand some people have this idea that a\njourney of inner exploration\nis is a fun journey oh i'll discover all\nthese amazing things about myself and\nwhat a good person i am\nand i will have these wonderful\nexperiences of bliss\nand peacefulness and oneness with the\nuniverse\nand sometimes it happens i don't say it\nnever happens\nbut a lot of that is\nuh is painful experiences it's boring\nexperiences\nlike you have like to go through a\ndesert of boredom and one of the\ni think biggest obstacles for people\ntoday\nin in the world of the 21st century i\ndon't know how it was you know 2000\nyears ago\nbut today i would say that both the\ninability to deal with boredom is one of\nour greatest weaknesses\nand in almost any meaningful journey\nyou have to go through boredom\nuh whether it's you're traveling to\nanother country and you have to spend\nsome time in the airport\nor whether it's you're having a\nconversation with somebody\ni find from my experience that\nif you're in a conversation that doesn't\nallow\nspace for boredom it will never reach\nanywhere\ninteresting like if you meet i now\ntravel around the world and i meet these\nvery uh uh powerful and famous and\ninfluential people\nand the problem with powerful and famous\nand influential people\nthey don't have time so if you get an\nhour\nwith this person then every minute\nshould count\nand boredom is is the scariest thing\nbecause if the conversation becomes\nboring it's over\ni don't have time for this nonsense i\nhave to run this company i have to run\nthis country\ni ca bondo you go bore somebody else\nwith that search and i love that and\nthen what you find is that you are\nforced\nall the time to all the time think\nwhat's the most interesting\nand important thing i can say and then\nyou reach\nyou usually reach out for the\nthings you've already said a million\ntimes before and you know\nthey're effective and both of you find\nyourself just\nexchanging these slogans and you never\nreach\nanywhere new and to reach someplace new\nin a conversation like\nyou need to go somewhere and and nobody\nreally knows what they're talking about\nand you're wandering around\nand you realize oh it's not going\nanywhere and you come back and you\nwasted\n20 minutes on on something which was in\nthe end it was nothing\nand you you can't do it when you meet\nthe president or whatever\nbut the most interesting conversations i\nhad in life\nit was like this long conversation when\nmuch of\nit was was quite boring yeah so and it's\nthe same when you go to explore yourself\nlike i don't know not necessarily in\nmeditation even like\nyou want to you you go to use sport\nso okay you start i'll go on a hike and\nyou start going and after three hours\nyou feel\nthirsty and it's hot and it's\ninconvenient and there is nothing to see\nand you say oh forget that\ni'll go back and watch some some some\nmovies and\nyou'll never reach the interesting parts\nof the journey either the geographical\njourney\nor the kind of inner journey of\nexploration if you don't allow\nyourself if you don't have the the\ndiscipline\nto go through these boring and sometimes\npainful and sometimes scary bits\ni love that i'm so glad you brought that\nup i think it's such a brilliant point\ni think you're so right because as soon\nas you put the pressure\nof performance on whether that's the\npressure of performance through\ntime like when we know we have a time\nlimit like you were saying when you're\nmeeting influential people\nand you've got like 30 minutes to say\nsomething profound\nyes or you've got like 40 minutes to\nprove that you have more knowledge or\nwisdom or whatever it is\nand so sometimes times are pressure\nsometimes the pressure is not time but\nthe pressure is\nthe people at the table it's like you\nknow that everyone's powerful at the\ntable and so the pressure is\noh my god i know he's smart and she's\nsmart so what do i have to say\nand and i think you're spot on that in\nthose times our lateral brain completely\nswitches off the logical brain switches\non\nand we just say stuff we already know\nand and\nyou don't have moments of brilliance and\nyou don't have a moment that that sparks\nunique thought\nyou don't get into flow state for\nexample you can't you can't generate\nanything new\ni think that's so true and i have to say\nin my training as a monk\nwhich i loved and was an incredible part\nof my life\na lot of it was just discipline and\ndoing the same thing\nover and over and over again in the\nbeginning\nand what you said walking across that\ndesert of boredom\nto then find a breakthrough yeah and\nit's almost just like that painful 99\nto experience that one percent of bliss\nyeah like\nin the movie it always gets condensed\ninto this\nfast track one minute or two minutes\nlike i don't know you have\nyoda training luke skywalker so in the\nmovie it just got\ncondensed into these two minutes you get\nthe point let's move on nothing\nand it was probably very i don't know\nit's fiction of course\nbut probably a lot of it was just you\nknow\nthis tedious thing that you have to go\nthrough through it\nabsolutely are you bored right now on\nright now no no\nall right we're going to get bored for a\nbit guys we've got to get bored for a\nbit so that you've will you know get\nsome space no i i think that's a great\npoint i think becoming\nokay with boredom is such a useful skill\nand i think you're spot on that in the\njourney of self-exploration\nor any journey i just came now from\nsilicon valley and what we\nwhat we just said is the greatest heresy\npossible\nin california in 2019 in la in 2019 in\nsan francisco in 2019\nto say let's just give some space to\nboredom there is nothing more radical\nand\nand subversive than i just i just\nsaw that uh reid hastings some time ago\nsaid that netflix's\nbiggest enemy like he was asked who is\nthe biggest competitor of netflix\nand the answer was sleep so true it's\nnot hulu\nit's not any of the other it's sleep\nthat's our biggest competitor\nso you know boredom if people could get\nalong with boredom\nyou know entire industries will crash we\njust collapse\nyeah no it's so true and and the instant\ngratification industry the\ninstant excitement industry is is\ndriving off that we know that that's\nobvious there's a\nstep let's start here the boring\nmovement yeah let's start the boring\nmovement here i love it this is the\nboring podcast we're gonna call it that\ni love it\nno and it's true i read a study that\neighty percent of us\npull out our phone in a crowd\njust to not feel lonely right like not\neven to do anything\njust when we're walking through a crowd\nwe pull out our phone\njust so that we feel like we're doing\nsomething and that pressure of always\nwanting to do something\njust so high no i love that i think\nthat's such great advice find time this\nweekend to be bored\nright be okay with boredom do you have\nit have you and this i don't expect you\nto have an answer i'm just exploring it\nbecause i love the point you brought up\ndo you have any ways of becoming more\nokay with boredom or letting there be\nmoments in a conversation like\ni'm sure when you went out on your first\ndate with your husband when you met\nthrough online dating i mean was there\nany boredom there or were you like\nhaving to say stuff was he did you allow\nspace for boredom because there's so\nmuch pressure when you date someone\nright\ni don't remember that it was boring\nbut yeah there is definitely a lot of\npressure in in those situations\nto be charismatic to be you know to be\nattractive\nto yeah not not to bore the other person\nit's the worst thing you can do it was\nso\nboredom is unit it's an abstract idea\nwhat what does it actually mean\nyeah what it actually means is our\nparticular sensations\nin the body it's not an abstract and\nwhen you actually\nobserve i mean you see that they are\nextremely\nunpleasant like when you're bored we\ntend to think about boredom as something\nlike\nnothing happens but actually a lot of\nthings are happening\nthere is a lot it's not you know it's\nnot like\nsevere pain it's actually a more\nsubtle kind of pain in throughout your\nbody\nwhich many people find far more\nintolerable\nthan the heroic severe pain\nthat you know again i'll take an example\njust for meditation because because i'm\nmore familiar with it\nbut i know that a lot of people when\nthey sit for meditation and there is a\nstrong pain\nthey it's quite easy for them to deal\nwith that they're actually even enjoying\nit in a way because they feel i'm doing\nsomething very important now\ni'm getting over this pain no pain no\ngain wonderful\npain is good and then when bottom comes\nit immediately breaks them\nthey can't deal with it because it's\nit's again\nit's a very unpleasant feeling in the\nbody it's not abstract\nbut part of it you don't feel heroic you\ndon't feel you're doing something\nimportant\nyou're feeling that you're wasting your\ntime that you're so\nlittle and insignificant and and\nespecially people who say\ncome to whatever practice it is uh again\nit could even be out like you're\nlearning to paint\nand ah now i'm picasso i'm doing this\ngreat work of art and i'm having this\nthis autistic crisis that's wonderful\nbut\nif if you're just bored you don't know\nhow to deal with it it's for most people\ni think it's it's actually\nmore difficult to deal with this subtle\npain\nof boredom than with the heroic pain of\nsome great crisis\nabsolutely i think you spot on that's\nyeah for me boy for me when i'm bored\ni find a i use it as space to breathe\nproperly\nthat's that's kind of what i do and i'm\njust in a gap or\ni'm in a moment where i'm like a bit\nbored right now you know and it's so\neasy\nto do the habit of just picking out my\nphone and\nand i know that and i've noticed myself\ndo that over and over again that\nwhenever i'm bored\nor there's a gap i just take on my phone\nwithout any purpose without any\nintention without any goal\nand so for me i've stopped doing that\nand using that as a moment to breathe\nthere is actually something when you\npick up the phone\nwhat actually happens in in your body is\nthat there is a little excitement ah\nmaybe i get some some email maybe i got\nsome like to my facebook whatever\nand so the moment you pick up the phone\nthere is a rush\na small rush of excitement in the body\nand actually this is what makes it so\naddictive\npeople are addicted not actually to the\nphone\npeople are addicted to the small rushes\nof excitement\nthat they think they can get dozens of\ntimes a day\nevery time they pick up the phone to see\nwhat's there\nyeah and those pleasure centers keep\ndecreasing yeah so we have to do it\nagain\nand again again and again and again we\nhave to accelerate to keep up because\nthat pleasure center is depleting\nevery time and i think that's what we\ndon't realize is that the more you do it\nthe harder it becomes to experience that\nfeeling again yeah because you've just\ndropped it lower and lower and lower\namazing okay we started the border\nmovement today\non this day 26 april 2019\nyou valencia the boredom movement the\nbottom podcast\nokay the second thing i really wanted to\ndive into apart from happiness with you\nwhich which leads nicely to this because\ni think this boredom experience also\nslightly links to what i wanted to go to\nwhich is education you speak a lot about\neducation i've made\na ton of videos about education and the\neducation system\nand my challenges to it just yesterday i\nwas talking to people about how like\nwhen we were educated we were taught to\nbelieve we had to be good at everything\nwe were taught that\nyou had to get an average grade at this\nand an average grade at that and an\naverage grade at that\nand you had to be equally good at\nhistory and science and math and english\nand a lot of the videos that i've made\non these topics have have\nbeen shared a lot so one of the videos i\nmade on this topic has 367 million views\non one video it's been shared like 8\nmillion times or something crazy like\nthat\nand it's because we feel this pressure\nthrough our education\nnow i believe that the ideal education\nsystem\nshould have a head a heart and a hand\na head for critical thinking a heart to\nunderstand\nto experience and then a hand to give to\nserve to make a difference\nand you talk in your chapter about the\nfour c's of critical thinking\ncommunication\ncollaboration and creativity yeah that's\nnot my idea and it's like the the\nexperts in the field\nare increasingly talking about these\nfour c's absolutely so tell me about\nyour thoughts on the education system\nand\nand why you got fascinated with that and\nhow you think that's impacted some of\nour\nmistakes we make now my interest with\nthe educational system comes\ni mean i am in the education system i\ni'm a professor at the university\nso so it's part of my life but\nnow it's mostly from thinking about the\ncoming revolutions\nespecially in the job market that\nagain we're in unique situation in human\nhistory when for the first time\nwe have no idea how the job market would\nlook like in 20 or 30 years\nthat was never before the case in\nhistory i mean\nthere are always things you couldn't\npredict about the world\n30 years from now you know political\nrevolutions\nwars plagues economic crisis nobody\ncould ever predict that\nbut at least about the basic skills that\nhumans will need\nin 30 years in order to get a good job\nand in order to support themselves and\nget along in life\nwe always had quite a good understanding\nof that\nso if you lived a thousand years ago in\nthe middle ages in some small village\nand so people didn't know who would be\nthe king in 30 years\npeople didn't know there might be a\nplague or an earthquake who knows\nbut they knew what they needed to teach\ntheir kids\nif they were to have a a\na reasonable life in 30 years you need\nto know how to plant rice\nand how to take the goats herding and\nhow to make cheese\nand how to make bread and how to build\nthe house and all these\nand today we just have no\nidea what people will\nwhat skills will people will need in the\njob market\nin 2050 anybody who tells you i know how\nthe job market would look like in 2050\nand what skills will be needed\nis uh deluding either\nyou or also themselves\nthe only thing we know is that it will\nbe a completely\ndifferent job market because of the\namazing advances\nin ai and machine learning and also in\nbioengineering\nso more and more jobs will be replaced\nby machines and computers and robots\nsome jobs will be transformed and new\njobs will appear\nnow i don't think we are facing a\nsituation no more jobs in the world\nthere will be\nnew jobs the big question is going i\nmean actually\ntwo big questions one big question is\nabout training and retraining\nthere will be new jobs will people have\nthe\nskills necessary for these kinds of jobs\npreviously when machines replaced humans\nfor instance in agriculture\nso machines replaced humans in\nlow-skilled jobs\nin farms but a lot of new low-skilled\njobs were created in factories\nlike the tractor replaced you on the\nfarm so you moved to detroit\nto work in ford's corporation\nto build a tractor and the new job was\nusually a relatively low skill job so\nwithin a couple of weeks\nperhaps two or three months you could\ntransform\na farm worker into a worker in a tractor\nfactory\nbut today when you look to the future so\npeople say yes\nthere will not be any more jobs for\ntruck drivers because you have\nself-driving trucks\nand there will not be a lot of jobs for\npeople producing\nshirts in textile factories and things\nlike that but there will be new jobs\nin the creative industries whether in\nart or whether in science\nor in in in interacting with people\nbut the problem is these new kind of\njobs will require\nhigh skills so it won't be so\neasy to take an unemployed textile\nworker\nat age 40 and transform her into a\nsoftware engineer that creates\nvirtual reality games and what makes it\neven worse\nis the huge gap between different\ncountries\ni think that in a country like the us\nwhich is bound to reap much of the\nbenefits\nof the coming ai revolution because\ncalifornia along with china\nis one of the of the centers of this\nrevolution\nthere will be immense new wealth created\nat least in some parts of the united\nstates\nso i don't worry for the americans but\nwhen i look at\nother parts of the world countries which\ndepend almost\nentirely on cheap manual labor say just\nsouth of the border\nyou go to mexico you go to el salvador\nto honduras to south america\nwhat will happen there i mean we are not\neducating the young people today in\nhonduras or in\ncolombia to be software engineers so\neven if there are a lot of new jobs in\ncalifornia\nfor software engineers this is not going\nto help the kids who are growing up\ntoday in honduras or\nor colombia so what will they do and\nwe have no answer and that's actually my\nbiggest worry about the education system\nnow\nis from a global perspective the huge\ngap that is opening between different\ncountries in the face of the coming\nai revolution if you were in charge of\nthe education system south of the border\nwhat were the things you'd be thinking\nabout at least i need money\nokay but if you had the money if you had\nthe money what would you be thinking\nabout\nbecause money is not never an issue\nreally oh\nnorth of the border even north of the\nborder it's an issue but south of the\nborder it's you know\nyou go to brazil and uh we are just\ngoing to brazil in a few months and you\nhave people coming to brazil with all\nthese ideas about\nwe should teach kids this and we should\nteach the kids that\nand the local people come and say we\ndon't even have schools i mean where do\nyou want us to put them in\nthat sense money right that you know i\nmean in some places you have\nthe schools run in in a shift system\nlike because you you just don't have the\nfacilities\nso some kids learn from eight o'clock in\nthe morning to two in the afternoon\nthey go home another shifts come right\nright and another shifts come at night\nbecause they just don't and you know\nthis is\nsome things you can't just throw money\nat it\nyou need more than that but the basic\ninfrastructure you basically the first\nthing you need is money\nokay and but there might yeah so looking\nat it from that perspective\nmy hope is that there are people who\nbelieve in those communities and want to\ninvest in them\nuh yeah i i hope so and again the\nthe main thing is that we need a global\nthinking on this\non this because in the last few decades\nwhat we've seen is a\na reduction in global inequality global\ninequality was extremely high\nin the early 20th century when you had a\nfew industrial powers\ncolonizing the rest of the world so say\nuh\nbritain dominating india and much of\nafrica\nand much of the middle east and the\ndisparity was enormous\nand then in the last few decades the gap\nwasn't completely closed\nbut india and britain are now far far\ncloser\nthan they were 50 years ago or 100 years\nago so we have seen\na reduction in global inequality but now\nwe are on the verge of a new burst of\ngrowing inequality just like the\nindustrial revolution of the 19th\ncentury\nthis is what created initially the gap\nbetween britain and india\nso now you have the ai revolution\nconcentrated\nin just a few countries the usa and\nchina are leading the race\nyou have a few other countries which\nwhich joined the race\nmost countries are far behind and the\neconomic consequences will be enormous\nso the danger is that what we've seen a\ncentury ago we\nwill come back and then it's not just a\nquestion say of people in brazil rich\npeople in brazil\ncaring about poor people in brazil and\ninvesting in their education and\nhealthcare and so forth\nthere won't be enough resources in in\nbrazil\nor maybe not brazil but but some other\ncountries\nso we need global thinking on that\notherwise\nit will be a rerun of the industrial\nrevolution\nwith these enormous gaps between a few\ncountries that dominate the world\nand most of humanity which is far far\nbehind absolutely no i agree and\ni guess my thinking from where i'm\nalways coming from is just\nto me the global thinking always needs\nto be towards\nhow we create more meaningful careers\nhow we create more meaningful jobs how\nwe create\nopportunities for people to be better\nengaged yeah\nbecause that's what's going to create a\nhappier more peaceful\nmore cohesive world it's almost like\notherwise there's a rerun in culture of\nyou slot people in to jobs they don't\nwant to do that aren't good for their\nhealth\nmentally or physically that then leads\nto another repercussion of that person\nbeing dissatisfied\nand then that reruns yeah like do you\nthink that where you do you think\nhaving met some of the most influential\npeople on the planet do you feel that\nthat's the dial that's the compass that\nwe're trying to get to or do you think\nthat's just for\nthe most influential people yeah most of\nthem are too busy with the immediate\ncrisis\nright i mean part of the problem and\nthis a little goes back to what we\ndiscussed earlier about boardroom and\nthings like that\nthat they are over excited and i mean i\ncan understand them i mean\ni i'm lucky i don't have a country to\nrun i don't have a multi-billion\ncorporation to run\nyes so i can allow myself the time to\nyou know just read a book or just go for\na walk or go from a\ntake a meditation retreat they can't\nand part of the issue they can't or they\nwon't\nthey really can't i mean they have so\nmuch on their plate\nthey have all these immediate crisis\nand like we had just the the case in in\nfrance\nwith the protests against emmanuel\nmacron and one of the things that the\nprotesters told him and i'm not judging\nwho is right who is wrong i don't\nunderstand french politics well enough\ni was just struck by what they said that\nbecause he uh the the initial cause was\nthat he wanted to impose a new tax\non on fuel uh in order to partly in\norder to combat\nclimate change and this caused a huge\nbacklash\nand some of the protesters told the\npresident\nyou're thinking about uh what will\nhappen\n20 years from now we're thinking about\nthe end of the month we don't have money\nfor the end of the month we don't care\nabout 20 years from now\nand that's a real issue um\nit's in it it's easy and i talk a lot\nabout the need to we need to do\nsomething about climate change\nbut then a simplistic answer okay let's\njust put money on a tax on fuel\nand if this tax hurts disproportionately\npoorer people then this is not a good\nsolution\nso now he has this crisis on his hands\nand he can't just okay\nokay i'll just go on this long two\nmonths retreat\nand i'll uh uh do meditation i do i'll\nhike in the alps\nand i i'll inform myself about climate\nchange and\nhe doesn't have the time he has that he\nhas brexit\nhe has the uae eu elections he has uh\nthe crisis in in libya\nhe has the the the relations with china\nand by the time you reach this\ninfluential place you really\ndon't have the luxury\nto think slow and broad\nand that's a huge huge problem for the\nsystem\nand again i don't have like these easy\nsolutions\npart of the idea of you know addressing\nthe general public\nlike what we were doing here and not\njust going and talking with a few\npresidents\nand and ceos is to realize that yes they\nare very influential people\nbut they are also extremely limited\nby their position of power and\nby the enormous pressures on them from\ndifferent directions\nso even for the influential people it\nwould be easier to do something on\nclimate change\nif you have tens of millions of people\nsaying that this is the number one\npriority and that they are willing to\nmake some painful sacrifices\nuh for that and it's the same with the\nkind of global educational crisis\nthat um you i i hope\nthat more and more people around the\nworld understand\nthat you know the consequences of these\ncrime of this crisis\nwe will see them only in 20 years when\nthe people\ntoday in indonesia and nigeria and\nbrazil\nwho are now in kindergarten when they\nwill be\n30 and 40 this is when the full force of\nthe crisis\nwill hit but if we wait\nuntil they are 40 to do something about\nit it's too late\nyeah we need to think what we are\nteaching\nyoungsters today in order\nto uh to solve the the the coming crisis\nof 2015. absolutely yeah and and i think\nthose uh\ni think that's a very good analysis of\nthis situation because\ni i appreciate that there is no quick\nsolution there is no easy recipe and\nwhen i'm listening to you talk there's\nparts of me\nthat are thinking like it's the way\nwe've constructed these roles of\ninfluence that these people don't have\nthe time and space and the boredom to be\nable to actually\ndo their jobs properly like we've not\ncreated these roles efficiently and\neffectively\nand at the same time the responsibility\non each and every one of us listening\nand watching right now\nto actually become change makers ourself\nto be someone who takes responsibility\nfor action to be a part of the solution\nto\nto actually step up and say no this is a\npriority and we need to go in that\ndirection\ni think that is even though it's not a\nquick recipe i think it's a good wake-up\ncall\ni think it's a good wake-up call that\ncan make us all aware that\nwe can't just wait for this to be solved\nfrom the top yeah because that's not\nreally going to happen especially\nassuming that a lot of our\nviewers and listeners are in the united\nstates\nthen america is still the most powerful\ncountry in the world\neconomically militarily politically so\namericans can do more than the citizens\nof any other country\num and there is still you know this\nexpectation\nthat america will be the leader of the\nworld\nuh in recent years it's been going in\nthe opposite direction\nthat it's really i think that's very\nunfortunate it's abdicating\nand willingly abdicating its role\nas leader of the world for decades you\nknow both from the right and left\nrepublicans\ndemocrats what was common to all the\nspectrum of of of american political\nsystem\nwas that they intentionally\nsaw themselves as the leaders of at\nleast the free world\nand then in the last few years america\nconfidence says no we don't want this\njob anymore\nfor us america first we need to\nfirst of all think about ourselves and\nour own interests\nand nobody wants to follow a leader\nwhose moto is me first\nso the rest of the world i mean is now\nyou know\nsome countries are trying to step up and\nfill the vacuum so in climate change\nnow china is becoming kind of or tries\nto depict itself\nas the leader of the world in trying to\ncombat climate change\nbut then in other uh areas uh it's it's\ndefinitely not\nlike that so we in this moment of\nof real crisis in in human history\nwe find the world without a leader\nand this again this is something that\npeople in the u.s\ncan do more about than in any other\nplace because still\nthe us is kind of the um\n[Music]\nalmost natural leader for humanity\nbecause it is still the most powerful\ncountry in the world other countries of\ncourse have to\nstep in and it would be good to have a\nworld which is yes\nless unipolar when we can't just trust a\nsingle country\nto do everything all the time definitely\nbut\num there is still a huge disparity in in\npowers between the different parts of\nthe world that\nthat's still the case yeah definitely\nbut i i do like that point you made\nthere even though there's a subtle point\nis that\nultimately if we live in that belief\nthat this country is the most powerful\nand they're going to solve everything\nthen we also kind of just debilitate\nourselves and we just go oh well\nif they're not going in the right\ndirection or wait for them to go in the\nright direction and actually what we all\nneed to do in my opinion is\npull our socks up and get stuck in\nbecause there's no\nthe i'm not a big fan of the victim\nmentality or the mentality of\nwaiting for someone else to solve a\ncrisis it's like if you're\nyou know if your house is on fire you\ndon't wait for your mom or your dad to\nfix it you\nyou get involved too right and so if we\nbelieve that there's a crisis or even if\nwe don't believe there's a crisis but we\nbelieve things are not going in the\nright direction\ni would want everyone from every country\nwhether it's india whether it's\naustralia whether it's\nacross europe to step in yeah take\naction\nand in in that sense actually the the\none good thing\nthat comes out or could come out of the\ncurrent\nretreat of the united states from the\nposition as\nleader of the world is that it it kind\nof forces\nother countries and other people to step\nin yes\nand i hope that this this will happen\nyeah good we have the same hope\nyeah we have the same hope i love this\nokay great so we've kind of gone\nfrom happiness and inside to global\nmacro viewpoints i want to go back\ninwards again\nand this is actually from a couple of\ndays ago i read somewhere that when tim\ncook was speaking at the time 100\nsummit an event that happened this week\nhe was speaking about how\nif you're spending more time looking at\na screen than in someone else's eyes\nthen you have a problem you have a\nproblem and you're getting things wrong\nyeah and i know it's just a good line\nyeah it's a very good line and\nand you also said that you know you said\nthat it's so much easier now to connect\nwith your cousin in switzerland\nthan it is with your husband because\nhe's always looking at his phone at\nbreakfast\nyou did write that down it is out there\nyou did say\nso to walk me through that\naddiction we spoke a bit about the the\nexcitement we get from the phone the\naddiction we have from the phone\nbut how have you seen people overcome\nthat\ni mean part of it is also that\nwhen you connect when you connect with\nsomebody through\na phone or through a screen um\nagain it's it's easier to deal with the\nproblematic stuff\nbecause you can just shut the phone once\nit becomes problematic\nand with a real person you can't do that\nso it\nit like real relationships forces you\nagain it's like the boredom thing\nthey force you to deal\nwith the difficult issues\npart of the attraction of all these\nonline communities and online\nrelationships and virtual relationships\nis that once a difficulty arises\nyou can just immediately disappear\nlike you can unfriend your facebook\nfriends\nin a way that you can't enable your real\nneighbors\nif you live in a house and they're just\nthat this annoying family just moved in\nand the kids are making a lot of noise\nin the middle of the night and\nyou can't just say okay i'll press a\nbutton and they'll disappear from my\nlife\ncan you imagine that eject yeah unable\nit doesn't work like so you have so you\nneed to develop these social skills okay\nwhat do i do\nokay i'll go there and i knock on their\ndoor with a cake or something\nand i'll try to have a nice conversation\nand then somehow\nmake them understand that i need to\nsleep and they should keep their kids\nmore quiet or something\nyeah but it's it forces you to develop\nthese social skills\nand um and that's extremely\nimportant and we are losing these skills\ni mean the more time again you spend\nwatching screens than watching eyes\nis you are in this sense kind of\ndowngrading\nsome of our human abilities i've just\nseen this wonderful\nuh presentation by tristan harris who is\nthis\nyes tech philosopher from from from\nsilicon valley\nand he just had this wonderful\npresentation\nabout how technology is basically\ndowngrading\nhumans downgrading human skills\nlike what to do when you have a problem\nwith your neighbors\nright so so actually instead of\ntechnology upgrading us it's downgrading\nour human skills\nyeah it it we upgrade our our\nphones all the time but inadvertently\nit downgrades our a lot of our social\nand personal skills\nyeah and which ones that you think are\nthe biggest ones that we're losing so\none of them is\nyou know deleting our neighbors and and\nyeah i completely agree with you\nwhat are the other ones that we're\nlosing out on that we can be aware of so\nanyone who's listening and watching\nright now\nhow can they become more aware of the\ntypes of skills we're losing\nbecause sometimes i don't think it's as\nobvious to us because everyone's on\ntheir phone\nour careers are now digital yeah we just\ntalked about ai\nand the rise of technology in every area\nof our lives whether it's work\nhealth like your dentist now wants to\nyou to use a toothbrush that can notify\nthem when something goes wrong in your\ntooth right yeah so it's like all parts\nof our lives are becoming automated\nand systemic so how can we become more\naware of the skills we're losing or\nwhich ones are those top skills that\nwe're losing\nwell many of the top skills are social\nof dealing with other people\nso another example which is now actually\ngets a lot of attention and there is a\nlot of talk about this\nis all the issue of filter bubbles okay\nthat people kind of lock them\nor or even inadvertently the algorithms\nthe facebook algorithms the twitter\nalgorithms that youtube algorithm that\ngets to know us\nincreasingly show us uh videos or\narticles or opinions\nwhich are aligned with our own opinions\nand we think that the entire world\nthinks like me like\ni don't know i'm a democrat and i don't\nknow any republicans and i never see\nany republican videos and and then when\nthe uh trump wins the election i can't\nunderstand how could it be there is\nno republicans so who voted for him it's\nall the people not in your filter bubble\nwho voted for him\nand what we are losing is the ability to\nengage\nwith uh opinions with people who think\ndifferently for from us now one\ncrude way of trying to fix that that at\nleast some corporations like facebook\ntried to do is every now and then show\nyou\na uh an article from the diff a\ndifferent\nside of the political spectrum but this\ndidn't work\nbecause it only made people even more\nangry because it wasn't in a in a\nsituation\nwhen you can really engage with the\npeople behind it\nlike you have this your view in the\nworld and you read something from\nanother perspective and you become very\nangry what are these stupid people who\nthink like that\nand it actually made things even worse\nnow again a century ago if you lived in\nsome\nsmall town then the situation was such\nthat you all the time\nencountered people who think differently\nfrom you\nbecause the community uh was made of you\nknow of those of different\nand of different viewpoints and you had\nto develop these skills\nof how to engage uh with\nand and how to cooperate and\npart of what technology is doing is that\nit downgrades\nthese skills it makes life easier yeah\nand it's all these things which are\ndifficult and uncomfortable to do\nlike having a real conversation with\nsomebody who thinks\ndifferently and it's you know it's just\nso much easier\njust to talk with the people who think\nlike me totally absolutely yeah and it's\nthat principle of like non-judgment\nbeing able to view observe\nand entertain a thought without judging\nit yeah and that becomes extremely hard\nright now\nthere was a great study by mit where\nthey showed two people's networks\nand he was looking at their online\nnetwork and saying which one is more\ncreative and impactful and\ninnovative and it was employee and it\nwas employee it be\nand their twitter networks and they\nfound that when you know the same people\nwho know the same people who know you\nback\nyou end up being less creative less\ninnovative and come up with less\ninteresting ideas\nbecause you don't have that challenging\nof thoughts and so i love that one of\nyour\nsolutions to that or one of your\nrecommendations at least that i gained\nfrom the book\nwas this beautiful colored quality of\nhumility\nof being the the openness that we have\ntowards other people's views\nand not this kind of deep religious\nbelief about the truth of our views and\nhow we're always right\ni i love that let's let's dive into\nhumility first of all i'm fascinated\nthat you brought up humility because\nhumility is probably my favorite quality\nin the world uh i find it the most\nendearing thing in the world when i meet\nsomeone who has it\nespecially someone who's very\naccomplished and my favorite story about\nhumility and i'm sure you know this but\ni'm sharing it for anyone who's\nlistening and watching right now\nis from benjamin franklin and his 13\nprecepts\nso benjamin franklin had 12 precepts 12\nthings that he wanted to live\nduring his life that he wanted to aspire\nfor\nand once one of his friends said that\nyou're getting a bit egotistic about\nthese things you're pretty good at it\nso he added the 13th one and then when\nhe was dying supposedly the story goes\nthat he was asked which one he didn't\nachieve\nand he said it was the 13th one and they\nsaid which one was the thirteenth one he\nsaid humility\nhe said that was the one that he didn't\nachieve in his lifetime so humility\nanother thing that what i think about\nmonks in the buddhist tradition or hindu\ntradition\nwhatever the monk cuts from his other\nvices\nhe adds to him to to his to his ego yeah\nyeah i overcome this i overcame that\nexactly\nexactly yeah as soon as we feel we've\nachieved something yeah it becomes a\nstep\non the other side of ego absolutely i\ncompletely agree so i love humility i'm\nfascinated by it\nuh what's your definition of humility\nand and how do we start increasing\nhumility in our lives in a positive way\nwell i mean in in the book it's it's\nmore again in the more\npolitical and historical context and the\nthe idea is\ndon't think you're the center of the\nworld and this is\nactually again in in the book it's more\nabout collective humility\nthe humility of groups of of political\nparties of nations of religions\num one of the curious things to see as a\nhistorian\nis that everybody thinks they are the\nmost important thing in the world\neven you wouldn't believe these tiny\ntribes or insignificant nations\nthey somehow manage to kind of turn the\nwhole history around\nso they turn out to be the most\nimportant thing\nand you know if you think that i don't\nknow if the chinese think they're the\nmost\nimportant in the world then okay i can\nunderstand it to some extent\nbut then then you go say to israel and\nyou find this tiny nation\nutterly convinced that we are the most\nimportant thing in the world the entire\nworld revolves just around us\nand it was always like that that we\ninvented every any everything and i i\nuse the example of israel as in jews\nbecause it you know it's\nit's not so nice to criticize other\nnations and other people it's it's\neasier when you criticize your own\nbut this is not meant as a kind of\nanti-jewish or anti-israeli thing\nwhatever your nationality or religion is\nnow after we\nyou finish watching this do this\nexercise on on your group\nand you know in almost any invention you\nwould mention\nthey would say we invented it first\nthere is even a story\nthat jews invented yoga what do you\nbelieve that\nthe posters of yo i i in jerusalem when\ni was a student i went to\ni was definitely this year i went to\nstudy yoga\nwith this teacher in jerusalem and on\nthe first class he explained to the\nstudent\nyou know that a lot of people think that\nyoga comes from india but no no\nno actually yoga was invented\nby abraham and the postures of\nyoga actually reflect the\nletters of the hebrew alphabet the aleph\nthe bad the gimmel\nand and people and you know i quit after\nthis first class\nthis is not a person i would be studying\nyoga from but\nyou have people seriously believing that\nand when you look at the great span of\nhuman history\nit should be obvious that nobody is at\nthe center\nyes almost every nation or religion\ncontributed something\nbut most things when if you had to live\nyour life based only on the inventions\nand creations of people from your nation\nyou would have a very miserable life\nyou'll probably be dead\ni mean if you have to eat only the uh\nthings that were domesticated by your\ndirect ancestors\nlike i don't know italians you must now\nstop eating tomatoes\nbecause tomatoes were domesticated in\nmexico and not by italians\nand indians forget about these chili\npeppers\nno more chili peppers for you chili\npeppers were also domesticated by\nmexicans\nand mexicans don't put yourself too too\nhigh because you like your\nsteaks and hamburgers they there were no\ncows\nin america before columbus and no horses\nthey came from the old world and so\nforth and so on and so on\nand it's just not just food it's\neverything so\nreally understanding how interconnected\nthe whole humanity is and\nthat yes your people contributed\nsomething but it's a small thing\nit's not the whole thing and it's most\nimportant i think in the field of\nmorality\nbecause again i mean in israel there is\nthis very strong belief we invented\nmorality\nbefore the jews there was no ethics in\nthe world we invented it\nand the entire world owes us this huge\ndebt of gratitude because all the\nmorality in the world came from the jews\nand this you know this is absolute\nnonsense i mean even monkeys\nhave morality even animals it goes it's\nmillions of years ago it's in evolution\nsome at least social rules of do and\ndon't do\nand hunter-gatherers tens of thousands\nof years ago had ethics long before they\nknew anything about the bible\npeople in india in china in australia\nhad extremely\nwonderful ethical systems in many ways\nmuch better\nthan anything that came out of the\njudeo-christian tradition long before\nuh uh they knew anything about about the\nbible\nso yes jews contributed some things but\ndon't\nlet it go to you to your head you are\nnot so important\nwhat a beautiful message to to to end on\non that message i love that message\ni think it's incredible if we all looked\nat our wardrobes our kitchens\nour refrigerators our homes our cars\nwe noticed that it was inspired by the\nglobe it was never one or\nthe other it was never just one place\none country or one region i think it's\nsuch a beautiful message\ni have so many more questions i want to\nask you i hope we're going to do this\nagain on nationalism competition and a\nbillion other things but we end\nevery interview with what we call the\nfinal five quickfire rapid fire\nquestions okay so these are\none to three word answers one second\nthree words yeah or\none sentence maximum once and so this is\nnumber one what is the biggest mistake\nwe make as humans\none word three words one sentence max\nunderestimate our stupidity\nnice i love it okay question number two\nwhat is the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nobserve your breath nice number three\nwhat is the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\njust follow your heart nice okay number\nfour\nwhat's the one thing you want to learn\nthis year or you're trying to learn this\nyear\n[Music]\nhow the other side is think is thinking\nnice i like that\nawesome and number five if you could get\neveryone in the world\nto practice one thing for 30 days what\nwould it be\num i won't say meditation because it's\nnot going to
