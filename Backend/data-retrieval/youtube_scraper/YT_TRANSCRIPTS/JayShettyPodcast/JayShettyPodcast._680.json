    "transcript": "from then literally the minute we come\ninto this world i mean even though we're\nnot quite aware of it when we're that\nyoung but you know we're we're looking\nfor cues from our parents we're looking\nfor cues from our friends our family our\nour school our society\nwho am i do i have worth in this world\nand unfortunately i think uh\nmost people's parents are not qualified\nto be able to even help them\ntruly understand a lot of these concepts\nbecause they were never taught\neveryone thank you so much for coming\nback to on\npurpose the number one podcast in the\nworld i'm so grateful for each and every\none of you for taking out time out of\nyour days\nand nights whenever you listen to learn\nto grow\nto thrive to choose to educate enlighten\nand enliven yourselves and you know that\ni'm always trying to get guests\nthat i think are coming from a really\nauthentic place and today's guest\nis exactly that i'm so excited to\nintroduce you to our next guest who's an\namerican actor and singer\nyou may know him from chuck the\nmarvelous mrs maisel and most recently\nhe actually plays\nshazam in dc's new movie shazam so i'm\nso excited zachary levi thank you so\nmuch for being here uh honored to be\nhere man thank you so much for having me\nj shetty everyone jay shetty that is\nthat's so good i practice it uh at night\nyou were doing accents earlier too and i\nwas thinking wow this\nthis is really was that doing accents\nyou were what was i doing you doing the\nitalian\noh italian that's right that's right you\nalways have to do it with the hands\nthough\notherwise you're not you're gutting it\nyeah you've got it down but no i'm\ngenuinely and i mean this from the\nbottom of my heart i'm genuinely so\ngrateful that you're here\nme too when my team and i were looking\nthrough your work your words\nyour insights the types of things that\nyou choose to speak about whether you're\non interviews or social media\ni feel so aligned and connected to them\nand i was like\none thing i love about this podcast and\nthe reason why we do it is i want to go\nbeyond the actor beyond the singer\nbeyond what someone does day to day as a\nhuman being into the human being like\nyou said\nthe first thing you said yeah exactly by\nthe human being human being yeah yeah\nthank you zach i really appreciate you\nbeing here happy to be here\nbut yeah so i i want to start because\nwhat i love is that i feel like\nthe world's just getting to learn about\nyou even more and more and more and more\nright now and that's very exciting\nyeah uh yeah i mean so you know i've\nbeen i've been blessed enough to be\nkicking around this town\nuh or this business rather for about 20\nyears i mean almost exactly i started\nauditioning\num fulfillment television when i was\nwhen i was 18\nit was april of of 1999 and now\nit's april of 2019 and\nit's been a crazy 20 years i mean this\nthis town\nuh can be incredibly\nuh uh exciting it can also be incredibly\ndark\na very difficult place to try and find\nyourself particularly when you don't\nknow that you're\ntrying to find yourself as i've come to\nfind out\num and uh so to be\nhere now and you know uh i mean i've\nalways had\na really blessed career in that i\nstarted working pretty much\nright away when i was about 18 i started\nbooking gigs\num and i've been able to build you know\nsome some bit of uh\ni don't know a a a social awareness or\npeople\num i i've been living in the public eye\nto some extent but this is a whole\nnother level of\nof what that is and um\nand i i'll say man i i i think\nthe timing of all of it and we can get\nyou know into more details of it\nobviously but\nit's one of the things i talk about so\nmuch on my social media is mental health\nand\num loving oneself and you know self-love\nself-care\nuh and those are things i didn't really\nquite understand until i\ndidn't want to live anymore a few years\nago and then went and\ndid a super deep dive into therapy\nand uh you know had a ton of\nwork that i was doing with psychiatrists\nand psychotherapists dialectic\nbehavioral therapy art therapy\nmeditation therapy\nlife coaching like going to the gym\nmeditation and and prayer and my friends\nand family loving me through all of that\nand really just saving my own life\nand on the heels of that i got this job\nand that is no coincidence as far as i'm\nconcerned i think that\ni the ti as a deeply spiritual person\nwho believes in a creator i believe that\nthis was all waiting to happen perhaps\nuh\nas things time out in the way that they\ndo i think that they do\nin in very big ways um\nand uh in meaningful ways and i think\nthat uh\nthe the timing of me being able to now\nhave this platform\nuh is directly tied to the work that i\nwent and did on my life so that i can\nnow talk about that work and talk about\nthe importance of it and\nuh it's awesome man i'm i'm really\ngrateful that uh not only that i have\nthis incredible new job and that\nit's you know changing my life\nup on a daily basis i mean i still walk\naround and you know most people don't\nknow the heck i am that's\nthat's totally most of the time i i've\nlived in a reasonable anonymity most of\nmy career which has been\nquite an amazing blessing you know\nbecause i don't know what it's like to\nbe brad pitt i don't know what it's like\nto be tom cruise i don't know what it's\nlike to\nnot be able to go anywhere without\npeople mobbing you or whatever or if\npeople do i don't maybe\ni don't know maybe tom cruise walks\naround people don't mob him either i\nhave no idea\nuh maybe you know with the right set of\nsunglasses that i had yeah you're good\nbut um\nbut i do i've always believed that you\nbe grateful for what you have when you\nhave it i appreciated that anonymity if\ni lose some of that moving into this\nnext phase of my life\nthen so be it uh i'm happy for the\ntrade-off to be able to now have a\nmore of a platform to be able to speak\nlove into the world because i think\ni i do believe that god created me to do\nwhat i'm doing to be an entertainer i\nthink i have a specific skill set and\ni've always had this skill set even\nsince i was a little kid i\nwas very good at entertaining people and\nand could keep growing at it and\nfiguring it out in ways that i couldn't\ngrow and figure out other things in my\nlife\nstill trying to figure out how to be a\nbetter basketball player but\num but to be able to\nto to believe that i was created to do\nthat is one thing but after having gone\nthrough all the therapy and the\nlife-saving stuff that i've\ndone and learned and the self-love that\ni've learned\num i really believe more than that i\nthink god created me to\nhopefully just be you know what really\nhas created all of us to be conduits of\nlove\nconduits of life conduits of light\nand if we can get through our own\ntraumas and our own\npain and our own injuries and find\nhealing in that\nthen it allows us to be even stronger\nmore uh um efficacious\nuh conduits and so yeah i i don't know\nit's\nit's all very cool i just i daily i just\ndaily feel like a deep deep deep deep\ngratitude like to the point where\ni i just start crying sometimes you know\nand it's incred it's incredible to go\nfrom a place where i felt such deep\ndespair and i was crying from despair\nto now feeling like i just get i just\ntear up feeling nothing but like\nthe deepest of peace and joy and i mean\nleaving now even just talking about it i\njust get overwhelmed i'm like i can't\nbelieve that this is my life right now\nit's so cool\nthat's awesome man that's beautiful\nwe're three minutes in and zachary levi\nis already talking about self-love hell\nyeah man\nmental health going deep in life talking\nabout humanity i love diana and i'm so\nglad that we've started there like this\nis brilliant\nusually usually i'm like okay like we're\nlike crescendo like we're\nmoving how do we get this out and like\nhere we go with zach and it's like we're\nthree minutes in and you're already\nsaying everything that i know everyone\nwho's listening right now will will\nabsolutely fall in love with you because\nthat's that's what this is about like\nthis whole community is about that now i\ni want to everything what's beautiful\nabout what you've just done for us is\nyou've kind of laid out\nall the things i want to dive into today\nso so i love that because everyone's got\na feel for who you are now already\nand and i want you to be able to tell\nthat story in depth because i'm guessing\nand i love what you said there that when\nyou were crying out of despair\nand now you're crying out of gratitude\nthose two different i'm also guessing\nthat because of your faith\nand and i don't put words in your mouth\nbut i also because of your faith\nbecause of your search for meaning in\nyour own life that even those\ntears how far were they from\nhelplessness versus how far were they\nhopeful\nlike where were you in that space when\nyou were really in that middle how how\nmuch were they helpless but how much\nwere they full of hope\num you know i don't know i mean to be\nhonest\nmost of my life i've been a pretty\noptimistic and hopeful person but\nthere's been\nthere have been seasons excuse me there\nhave been seasons\nof life that have just\ndestroyed me and and and sometimes i\nwasn't even aware that they were\ndestroying me in fact i think a lot of\nthe times we're not really\naware of the destruction that's going on\nuh\nand a lot of that we play a big part in\nyou know i think\ni think a lot of the destruction that we\nfeel in our life is self-motivated is\nself-destructive\nwe don't know that we're doing that\nwe're we're\nwe're trying to feel\nlike we belong we that we have worth i\nthink from then literally the minute we\ncome into this world i mean even though\nwe're not quite aware of it when we're\nthat\nyoung but you know we're we're looking\nfor cues from our parents we're looking\nfor cues from our friends our family our\nour school our society\nwho am i do i have worth in this world\nand unfortunately i think uh most\npeople's parents are not qualified to be\nable to even help them\ntruly understand a lot of these concepts\nbecause they were never taught\nwhich then makes all mental health as\nfar as i'm concerned a completely\ngenerational\nthing these are just handed down year\nafter year after year so\nmy i think that i was given a strong\nenough\nwill and spirit and ego if you will uh\ntalking about like sapiens and all that\nyou know like the ego that we build\nwhich is our survival mechanism you know\nand we get\nbanged around and it's denting us and\nit's forming this thing but\nyou know um i i survived and i survived\npretty well and i found entertainment\nas a way of survival i found love\nthrough entertainment if i could\nmake somebody laugh and i could get\nthose applause i found i was like oh\nthere's my purpose\ni have value now because i can make this\nperson a plot or give them a good time\nor whatever but\nyou know when the applause dies down it\nbecomes a very lonely\nlife uh and then you try to fill that\nloneliness with in\nall manner of things so i think for a\nlong time\nthough i was optimistic and though my\nfaith um\nwhich is kind of rooted mainly in\nchristianity although i would say my\nchristianity feels much more buddhist\nthan baptist\num i i think that i always\ni always had faith a deep a deep faith\num\nand therefore a deep hope with that\nfaith but under all of that\neven or let's say above all of that i\ndon't know i don't know which current\nwas\nyou know which one's sitting on the\nother but um there was a tremendous\namount of despair there's a tremendous\namount of hopelessness um\nbecause i still didn't quite understand\nwhat it meant to just\nlove myself and i think that's one of\nthe i mean honestly that's why i can't\nstop talking about it because after\nhaving gone through what i've gone\nthrough\ni i really genuinely believe that it's\nprobably the biggest\nroot issue that we have in the world in\nthe world amen\nworld leaders right now pick a country\nour country uh here other places the\nthere there are people who are in\npositions of power\nand they're in positions of power\nbecause they've been chasing\nworth they don't they don't know how\nbereft they are of their own self-worth\nthey have been flexing power and you\nknow\nmaking moves and feeling oh if i make\nenough money\nif i have enough power and if i have\nenough money look at some of the biggest\nyou know ceos or\nor most you know wealthy people in the\nworld\ni think they're probably some of and you\nhear these things all the time like well\nyou know the most successful people in\nthe world are some of the loneliest or\nwhatever and you go\nyeah yeah yeah great i would take\nbillions of dollars over over you know\nwhatever that whatever the alternative\nis\num but i i really do think that uh so\nmany of them\neven though they might not even realize\nit are hopeless they don't realize\nthat they are terrified deep down inside\nthat\neven their billions or trillions or\nwhatever they've got is still not going\nto give them\nany actual real value going into\nwhatever\nis beyond this world or even while\nyou're here in this world you know\num so anyway that was a little bit of a\ntangent they're a little bit of a\ntangent but\ngoing back though what i was\nexperiencing\nalthough again like you unpack a lot of\nstuff in therapy but\nyou know i grew up in a home where my\nmom was uh\na a beautiful and crazy intelligent\nuh vibrant dynamic woman who\nhonestly probably could have done\nanything she could have been\na ceo of a fortune 500 she could have\nbeen a doctor a lawyer\nwhatever she was she was an incredible\nforce\num that unfortunately was you know that\ngrew up in a home where\nher mother psychologically abused her\nand her siblings\nand we knew that a little bit growing up\nbut you know you just hear\nmom you know honestly just like yelling\nabout how her mom was such a horrible\nmom\nand that's it's a difficult thing when\nyou're growing up now with a mom who\ndidn't\nunderstand the damage that that did to\nher and so she just carried on that\nabuse\nand she was very psychologically abusive\nto me and my sisters\nnot knowing that she was uh and that was\none of the biggest things i learned in\ntherapy was\nas i was forgiving myself and\nunderstanding how to forgive my mom\nbecause\ni i just started visualizing the\nfive-year-old version of my mom\ngetting you know hit or literally left\non the side of the road when they were\nyou know on some family road trip and my\ngrandma was mad at her it was like\nkicked her out of the car and left her\nthere for hours and you start realizing\nhow much trauma like we we've all we all\nexperienced trauma trauma\nisn't just like some really crazy\nhardcore thing that like oh you got like\nblunt force trauma to the head\ni mean we're dealing with these things\non a regular basis on a daily basis\nsometimes\nand my mom was madly traumatized by my\ngrandmother and\nand she never went and got the help that\nshe needed to get and so that just got\nworse and worse and worse and worse and\nthe life that i grew up with in my\nfamily\nreally really messed me up more so than\ni ever gave it credit for because my ego\nwas strong enough to keep me going\nit kept me going i was surviving and i\nwas surviving it's incredible how\nevolutionarily we've been able to create\nthis whole persona and survive through\nthis stuff\nbut as a lot of people will tell you and\nwhether that's like a mid-life crisis or\nwhatever it is\nyou know you get to a place and mine was\nyou know i basically got\nto i i i had a gnarly childhood growing\nup i\nuh didn't realize just how much that\naffected me and my ability to love\nmyself and therefore love others\ni ended up getting married and divorced\nin a very\nshort amount of time to a girl that i\nthought i was\ndeeply madly in love with and i still\nhave a tremendous amount of love for\num but we were two i think uh broken\npeople\nyou know finding each other which is\nwhat happens in a lot of relationships i\nthink\nbecause if you haven't done the\nself-work and you don't know that you\nneeded to do that self-work\nthen you're gonna keep attracting the\nwrong person and they're going to be\nattracting you as the wrong person and\nso on and so forth and so uh then i\nended up getting\nuh that was a that was a really really\ndark period of my life and then i got\ndivorced and then months later\nyou know in this within the same year my\nmom died very unexpectedly although she\nand i didn't really have a relationship\nfor about 10 years by that point\nand um and it was really like and i\ni i i mourned for a couple of days when\nshe died uh but\ni then kind of you know i was i was okay\nor i thought i was okay i thought i had\ndealt with it um\nand then you know work this business\nagain it's a really gnarly business and\nit can really\nknock you around and beat you up and uh\nand then i\nmade this move to texas because i've had\nall of these crazy amazing dreams of\nwell i think amazing who knows if they\npan out but\num to go build i mean\nuh to go build a film studio that's also\na a resort that's also a commune that's\nalso like\nlike literally i i just i i want to make\na better world\nand i think that we can do that uh\nif we all want it and we have to just\nwant it bad enough and i think that\nif you have a a platform to maybe go and\ntry and do that\nand you've got some means and some\nfinances to go and maybe build a new\ntype of community\nthat can be an example of how we can get\nback to\nknowing each other and loving each other\nand trusting each other and communing\nagain with one another and\nknowing your neighbor and you know kids\nrunning around and\nparents not feeling like they have to\nhelicopter parent them all the time and\nall of that stuff so\nanyway that all brought me to texas but\nthen\ni got there and then i felt after\nmany years of feeling very optimistic\nand feeling a deep faith\ni felt quite abandoned by god to be\nhonest i felt like all of the things\nthat led me there\nuh then left me alone and left me\nsitting\nalone and and very deeply hopeless and\num and that was right around my 37th\nbirthday\nand and uh i\nyeah i just i didn't really understand\nwhat the point of life was\nanymore i felt like i had fought really\nhard to go and be a good person to go\nand love people to be an example to try\nand use my\nmy platform and privilege for good and i\nfelt like all of that amounted to me\nnow being completely alone and\ncompletely\nhopeless and um and thank god\nuh you know i had friends and family\nthat were there and kind of holding my\nhand and propping me up through some\nreally really dark moments and times and\nthen i found this place\nuh that i think was essentially\ninitially\ncreated to be a place where ceos\nof very large companies could that were\ndealing with major burnout major\ndepression\nmajor anxieties uh could go and\njust you know get some major deep\nhealing\nand um and i went and it was three weeks\nof just like the most\nintense um i got there and you know i\nfell through the door of that place it\nwas like i got to 37 and i just fell to\nthe door therapy and i said i don't know\nwho i am\nor i don't think i know who i am because\ni don't know how it got me here\nso i need to know who i am and i need to\nknow how i got here and i need to make\nsure that i that never happens again\nbecause i don't want to die but i don't\nreally feel\ni don't keep liv understand\nand um and through all of those things\nthat i was saying earlier all those\nvarious forms of therapy and\num uh psychiatry and uh\nand even and again like you know doing\nyoga twice twice a week and pilates\ntwice a week and at the gym four it you\nknow\nbecause that's all incredibly crucial to\nour mental and emotional well-being\num those things all essentially and the\nprayer of\nof this uh particularly this one woman\nwho\num kind of i and i i don't think it's\nany coincidence that god has brought\nthese people into my life\nthroughout my journey but there have\nbeen women older\nmaternal women that have come along\nthrough my journey that have been those\nsurrogate mothers for me when my mother\nwasn't my mother and couldn't be my\nmother and uh and this woman\nprayed me back to life and uh between\nthat\nand all of the tools that i was learning\nabout you know\nlearning about how bad my self-talk was\nyou know that's something that i don't\nthink a lot of people even quite\nunderstand\nhow important it is of how you speak to\nyourself dive into that let's do it yeah\nlet's dive into that no and when i'm\nlistening to you\nsorry by the way i know incredibly\nverbose and tangential\nfyi so i'll just keep going unless you\nit's great no no no and i won't because\ni i love listening because i think\nthat's important too\nyou know i think as much as as much as\nit is important for me to guide\ni also like to listen and see where\nyou're taking it because\nand this is this is advice to anyone\nwho's listening to a friend or a family\nmember\nyou learn more when you listen yeah and\ni'm learning so much more about you than\ni could have ever gained if i was\ntalking\nwhich is awesome when i'm listening to\nyou though what i find is that today i'm\nsitting\nin front of someone who i find is\nextremely passionate\nfeels that they're living their calling\nfeels that they're doing what they were\nborn to do\nwhich is very different from the self\nthat you're\ndisplaying or sharing that you were\nbefore\nand so what i want to dive into we'll\ndrive into the self talk today but what\ni want to dive into is\nlet's take you back to that six-year-old\nboy who was getting excited by dance\nsinging\nacting but at the same time had this\nhome experience that you were describing\nwith your mother at the time\nis that when singing dancing and acting\nbecame that outlet became that\nexpression became that\nconnect which you weren't getting at\nhome is that when it was or was it was\nit actually just\nsomething that came naturally i mean i\nthink i i i i can't imagine that there's\nnot\nsome correlation to what my childhood\nwas and\nand then ultimately where i found outlet\num i was the middle boy between\ntwo sisters uh my dad wasn't in the\npicture\ni wasn't i was literally just like uh uh\nuh floating in a sea of estrogen like it\nwas\nmy sisters my mom my two aunts my cousin\nnikki who's like our third sister my\ngrandma family outings were you know\ngoing to\njc penney's and shopping i mean that's\nwhat that's what it felt like and um\nso as a as a middle kid you're\nlooking to you know have a voice and\nhave an identity of your\nown that's one thing uh you know being\nthe only boy\ni was constantly having to kind of\ncreate my own\nworlds of of imagination and\nentertainment\nand um and you know and not really\nhaving\nparents like my dad was gone my mom god\nbless her and god rest her soul\nshe she had a lot of issues and she\nwasn't the best\nshe was really incredible as a mom in\nsome respects and i'm really grateful\nfor those\nthings that she did for example like\nshe was way ahead of the curve when it\ncame to uh\nlike a naturopathic lifestyle we were\ntaking vitamins and\nuh like barley green and not having\nsugared cereal or soda when we were kids\nand\nnow all the other kids are like you\ndon't have cocoa puffs i was like i know\nit's the worst\nbut i'm so grateful that my mom knew and\ncared about all that stuff\nwell before the curve because i don't\nnow have problems dealing with my sugar\nlevels and obesity in ways that a lot of\nother people have been addicted to this\nstuff for so long because sugar is\na crazy addiction anyway again\ntangential\num but so yeah man i\ni think i was always just trying to\nand i was all and i always had like a\nsuper vibrant imagination and i was a\nsuper super energetic spazzy kid so\nall of those things just oh sorry and\nthen because\ni didn't we didn't really have a\ntremendous amount of let's say\nparental supervision or whatever you\nknow the television became\nand and and then also my video games\nthrough the television\nbecame worlds that i explored and lived\nin and loved and\nso i was already being influenced by all\nof my favorite cartoons and tv shows and\nthose became\ni don't know they were my friends\nnecessarily but i loved them and i\nwanted to emulate them and i wanted to\nbe a part of them so all of those things\ni think kind of put me into\nthe the place for that having\num having a household where i\nthough i didn't know it at the time\nwhere i wasn't where i didn't understand\nself love where i didn't where i didn't\nknow that i wasn't feeling fully loved\nor\nfully uh worthy of the life that i was\nliving as a kid you don't\nthese are all very subconscious things\num but certainly i'm sure that led to\npart of me going and wanting to find\nthat\nin strangers find that in the approval\nliterally\nthe approval of people going and sitting\nin seats in a theater\nand applauding me at the end of a play\nor laughing at the jokes throughout it\nthat all of a sudden like i was saying\nbefore gave me uh not just an outlet for\nall of this other stuff\nbut it gave me the validation that i so\ndesperately was seeking and needing\nwhich is by the way\nwhat almost every actor that comes to\nhollywood is dealing with on\nsome level because why the heck s are\nyou trying to go and make all these\ndemonstrations how do we balance that\nlike i love the fact that we're talking\nabout this because how do we balance\nthat\nso we all love\nfrom a genuine place also making other\npeople happy yeah we all\nneed appreciation in our life we all\nneed to feel\nsome level of significance and some\nlevel that we matter\nthat that our work and our words has an\nimpact on others\nwhere have you found that balance\nbetween\nnot letting other people's opinions and\napproval lead\nor mislead you versus when is it\nright and okay to feel that like do you\nknow what i'm saying like totally\ni mean let me i want to hear you i find\nthat i want to hear your voice it's like\nwhere are you finding that balance\nbetween\nknowing that we all like it's the same\nwith me like when i make a video\nof course i want people to connect with\nit of course i want people to resonate\nwith it because\nthat's also my service it's my offering\nit's it's where i get to be an\ninstrument\nyeah and it's where i get to feel useful\nbut at the same time if you only let the\nlikes\nand the views and the shares and the\nreviews of movies\nguide how you feel about yourself that's\nwhere i found it that's my balance it's\nlike\nit's like i should know how i feel about\nso i say happiness or self-love to me\nand i'd love to your definition yeah my\ndefinition of self-love is how i feel\nabout myself when i'm by myself\nyeah right like that's my definition of\nyourself yes\nwhat's your what's your definition of\nself-love and how does it start well i\nthink\nsimilar i i think probably very similar\ni mean i i didn't realize how much i\ndidn't like hanging out with myself\nuh until i went to this really\nincredible life-saving therapy\ni thought i did i mean people talk about\nself-love all the time i was like i love\nme okay with me i feel good you know\nbut it's but i didn't realize that when\ni would be\nquiet when i would just be with me i was\nalways looking for\nthe i would go play video games you know\nbut that's not really spending time with\nyourself that you're you're\nnow a simulated version of you in some\ncool world on another planet shooting\naliens or whatever but\nthat's not really spending time with\nyourself and i but\ni've always been a very very deep\nthinker and feeler so i've spent a lot\nof time and thought\nit just wouldn't necessarily be about me\nand it wouldn't be\nuh kind to me my self-talk\nagain that i thought was just normal\nwhen i would screw up when i wouldn't do\nthings the way that i thought they\nshould be done and this was all based on\nthe way i was programmed\nbad programming by my parents um\ni would destroy myself in my mind and\nwhen i talked to these folks\nin therapy and they were like why do you\ntalk to yourself that way and i go well\nbecause this that and the other and they\ngo well would you ever\nif you're if your friend did something\nthat you thought wasn't great would you\ntalk to them that way and i was like i\nwould never i would never talk to them\nthat way\nthen why would you talk to yourself that\nway and it i don't know why i'd never\nput that together but it\nleveled me i was like i i guess because\ni genuinely don't like myself i\ngenuinely don't love myself\nso what self-love is i mean\ni it's a very difficult thing to kind of\ndefine i suppose but because there's so\nmuch around it but i would say that\nto love yourself is to hopefully\nfinally and by the way and it's a daily\nthing because we can go back and forth\non it right\nit's not like oh it's that's solved and\nwe're done and we can move on\nit's a process it's a journey and you\nalways have to check in with yourself\nand i think that\nyou know for me it's it's been a matter\nof\nyou know one of the things i i i spend\ntime in prayer in the morning and i\nspend time in prayer at night and that's\nkind of my meditative time as well and\num you know i and and a regular part of\nthose prayers\nis thanking god for\nmy heart my mind and my body because\nthese are all things that i have\nridiculed\nuh in various ways over the years and\nnot embraced and not been\ngreat grateful for a gratitude is one of\nto me the\nmost powerful uh bombs\nfor your soul for your heart for your\nmind uh\nto start with that and to say wherever\ni'm at right now thank you for what who\ni am and\nand where i'm at and um and to\nappreciate that and be okay with where\nyou are right now\nif you can be okay with where you are\nright now you can really start to love\nyourself if you're\nif you're not okay with where you are\nright now it's very difficult\nto em to then love yourself because\nthey're they're working\nthey're contradicting one another you\nknow and how to balance that i mean\ni mean one of the things i i've never uh\ni don't have like\nnotifications on my uh social media i've\nnever\ni i i started social media at a time\nwhere i was already\nliving the public eyes so uh\nthat's you kind of get inundated you\nknow with with that many followers and\num so fortunately i've never\nlived my world has never been one where\ni was uh um constantly looking for the\nlikes um\ni i've always even when i was unhealthy\nand didn't know what i i always knew in\nthe back of my mind\nuh that that's not a healthy way to be\nliving your life you can't\nif you're if you're posting things and\nyou're constantly checking to see\nwho checked in and who liked it whatever\nand by the way not that i'm uh\nuh uh completely faultless on all that\ncertainly there's times i'll post\nsomething and i'll go back and say i\nwonder who's i wonder who's chimed in or\nwhatever you know\num but i have never never\nuh found my worth there um\nbut i i have definitely tried you know\ni've\nlooked for and found my worth in in my\nwork\nin you know uh how am i doing good work\ni mean i thought i was failing my life\nfor a long time because all of the jobs\nthat i had done\nnever really put me into the next\nechelon or you know that higher level\nwhere i was\nwith all the cool kids doing all the\ncool kid movies and\na part of those conversations i was\nalways i just always felt like i was on\nthe outside looking in\nand that wrecked me on a regular basis\ni always felt like i wasn't doing\nsomething right or i wasn't good enough\nor\nand i think that's the question like\nwhen i'm listening to that's the\nquestion to me it's\nit's when you're doing something do you\nfeel fulfilled by doing it\nin and of itself or are you only gaining\nfulfillment\nwhen someone applauses right like that's\nyeah differentiation yeah that's\nself-awareness and for me self-awareness\nis like the heart of self-love\nyeah because just getting to that point\nknow yourself\nknow you love yourself yeah to know\nyourself first and then to love yourself\nbecause\nyou can't love someone you don't know\nright like i can't wait\ni know i know you're saying and i and i\nagree i don't know that\nyou you can't you can't fully appreciate\nor\nor love to fully love yourself means to\nlove even all of the failures\neven all of the all of the all of it\nexactly yeah but i do think on a general\nbroad philosophical sense we 100 percent\ncan\nand need to love those that we don't\nknow oh that 100 percent\noh 100 that's all no no 100 from a\nhumanity stand but i'll give you an\nexample of what i mean like today you\nwalk through the door yeah\nand i love you for being a human and i\nlove you for what i've learned about you\nin preparing for this yeah 100 but i\ncan't love you fully because i haven't\ngot to know you whereas the more i get\nto know you in this interview the more i\nfall in love with you\nthanks does that make sense yeah yeah\ntotally yeah and that's what we mean\nthat even with ourselves\nknowledge makes the the love deep\ncorrect that's what i mean that's where\ni'm coming from like when you're\nsubconsciously\nwell that's empathy yeah that's empathy\nyou know but but again\nbut and how interesting though is that\nthen take it another step which is\ncertainly the the more you might get to\nknow somebody the deeper you can love\nthem\nbut that's only if you that's only\npredicated on how d\nhow deep you know and love yourself\nfirst correct 100 which is so\nlike i really thought i was somebody who\nloved\npeople really deeply and i did by the\nway i i've always been\na god i'm so grateful that he gave me a\nheart that for a long time by the way\nreally screwed with a lot of parts of my\nlife maybe a very sensitive\nuh uh a kid that you know i would i\nwould get really wrecked about certain\nthings that would happen in the world it\nhad nothing to do with me and i would\njust\ni would literally feel the pain of\npeople in other parts of the world or\ni mean to be perfectly honest like like\nindia for example i can't wait to go to\nindia and i'm also dreading going to\nindia because there's a part of me\nthat feels like i'm gonna go walk around\nin those streets and i will be\ndevastated because i will see these kids\nand these lower casts and i will be like\nwhere is this\nwhere is the justice where is the love\nfor these people where's the love for\nthe unlovable\nthat stuff just wrecks me but i have\nalways had that\ndeep a deep love for people i didn't\nrealize\nhow much deeper i could love people and\nby the way you're not even\ndeeper but also in healthier yes\nmore focused ways if you're just a raw\nif you're just raw love and you're just\nfeeling\nthat can be powerful but you ca but\nyou're not\nperhaps accomplishing as much as you\ncould with that love and if you can go\nand then work on yourself\nand tighten all this and get this strong\nand then not just be\noverwhelmed and screwed up every time\nsomething happens then you can have more\nof a\nan even uh steady\nfocused strong effective love i think in\nthe world and that's where i think i'm\nnow hopefully going into that phase of\nmy life\nuh you know coupled with wherever my\nplatform might lead me but yeah\num wait yeah but you had said something\nup earlier and i'm trying to remember\nwhat\ntake your time no no no no no well i\ncan't wha\nwe're talking about knowing yourself\nloving yourself\nyeah i mean i no i don't know i'll think\nof it again yeah and that's what i think\neveryone who's listening right now i\nthink is going to take a lot of\na lot of confidence from the fact that\nthe way you're opening up\nthe way you're sharing your journey and\nchallenges and everything i'm hoping\nthat everyone's listening or watching\nright now is listening going oh my god\ni'm there too or i've been there too\nand this is a common experience across\nthe board\nlike getting to a point in life and\ngoing i don't know who i am i don't know\nwhat i'm doing oh yeah i don't know if i\nlove myself like these are all such\nnormal things all going for everyone and\nand\nyou reminded me when you were mentioning\nthis point about being in your solitude\nin space this\nthis study that i love that i share that\ntalked about how when men and women were\ngiven the choice of either being\nalone with their thoughts for 15 minutes\nor give themselves an electric shock\nand 60 of men chosen electric shock\nand 30 of women chose an electric shock\nand when they were asked afterwards it\nwas because they didn't want to be alone\nwith their thoughts\nso we're all in that so now i want to\ndive into so everyone's listening right\nnow we've all been there\nyeah we all find distractions whether\nit's video games whether it's movies\nwhether it's netflix whatever it is\nwe're all trying to relationships\nrelationships oh my god relationships is\none of the biggest definitely\nyeah i i just made a video a couple of\nweeks ago where i was talking about if\nyou find someone in your loneliness you\noften attract emptiness\nyeah right because you've got that in\nyou and therefore that attracts yeah\nso i want to dive into you because\nmeditation prayer\nand therapy are three tools that you\nreally live by and stand by\nyeah i want to hear about each of those\nfrom you including the self-talk element\nof how those key foundational principles\nand you mentioned yoga and pilates\nearlier\nyeah yeah i just want to hear about\nthose kind of like building blocks\nthat have helped you change and\ntransform and grow yeah i mean\nso therapy to me was probably\nthe most important initial uh\npart of it all because you can do a lot\nof meditation in prayer but if you're\num if you're\noh like you like in japan you know how\nin japan uh\nthere's this tradition if there if a\nbowl breaks they put it back together\nwith gold\nright and you can see uh the these the\nveins of gold to the and really makes it\na beautiful piece you don't just throw\nthe bowl away you put it all back\ntogether\nso i feel like the therapy was\nthe gold that was putting it all\ngalvanizing me back together making me\nwhole\nagain and again supplemented by and\nhelped by\nthe meditation and prayer around that\nbut if you if your head's not right\nif you don't see reality the way that\nreality actually is\nand therefore and who you are and how\nyou fit into reality\nprayer and meditation are gonna help\ntreat\nsymptoms but i don't know that they're\ngonna get to the root of\ndigging up all of that bad bad\nprogramming you know\nuh moreover i and i\nand i don't mean this to be offensive to\nanyone in fact i find i i\nfind it to be quite um um\ninclusive uh we're all mentally ill\ni personally feel like mental health is\nsomething we all deal with\nit it's it's we we all have\nit we unfortunately look at mental\nhealth uh\nif we put health uh with physical\nphysical health\nnobody has any problems talking about\nany of in fact there's a whole\nbroad spectrum physical health is\nanywhere or like if you're if you're\nphysically ill\nuh that can mean anything from the\ncommon cold to cancer\nand if you say that i'm ill no one's\nlike oh god you know they're going oh\ngosh what you know what's going on with\nyou\nuh there's not a stigma that's\nnecessarily attached to that nobody's\njudging you necessarily\nfor what's going on in your physical\nwell-being\nall of a sudden you fl you switch out a\nmental for physical\nand you say mental illness and the only\nthing that\ni mean now thank god we're coming to a\nmuch better place in society but for the\nlongest time\nmental illness was straight jacket\nrubber room you're crazy\nthat's it we have to start\nreassessing that massively and\nunderstand that\nto be mentally ill to to use a a uh\ni think a a dental analogy probably is\nthe best i've come up with\nall of us have cavities from time to\ntime\nall of us deal with mental illness\nlittle cavities in our heads\nand and that can be literally how you\nstart your day and you you you pass\nsomebody on the street and they did a\nthing\nand that affected you and now you're\nallowing it to affect you and now that's\nstarted a little cavity in your brain\nand you got to root that thing out\nand for some of us we're much better at\nbeing able to attend to that stuff\nsometimes\nwe don't and then that cavity becomes a\nmuch bigger cavity and then all of a\nsudden\nyou need a root canal some of us out\nthere in the world i needed a\nmajor root canal the way that i saw\nmyself and the way that i saw how i fit\ninto this world\nneeded to be rooted out of my brain big\ntime so as soon as i could do that\ngoing back to the dental analogy once\nthe dentist could get in there and clean\nall that crap\nout and then you know fix that and seal\nthat\nwell then it was a matter of uh going\nexact\nmaintaining that and uh and and\nloving myself and uh through all of that\nand\nthat's where i find the meditation and\nprayer and i and i kind of\nto me prayer meditation are kind of\nsynonymous i i my prayer time is my\nmeditative time\nuh occasionally i will do actual just\nstraight you know kind of um\nmindfulness meditation or centering\nprayer which is very similar\nwhere you either just focus on your\nbreath or you focus on one word and you\nkind of have that mantra and you go\nthrough that\nto really just calm it all down\ncalm the mechanism because we live in a\nworld that is so go go go\ngo go go and it is completely not what\nour biological\nevolutionary uh uh kind of path has been\ni mean we were hunter-gatherers going\nback to like yuval and sapiens and stuff\nlike that\nby the way reading that book helped me\nbecause that context and perspective i\nthink is so important\nin understanding who you are and how you\nfit into this world and why you got\nthere and why you got there\nexactly so so uh you know so i will\nstill have\nsome actual meditation like proper\nmeditation\nbut my prayer time coming before\nthe creator and on my knees and\nand and asking to be able to walk always\nin humility gratitude and trust\nthose three words are the to me\nthe foundation and cornerstone of my\nentire life and me too\nyeah man i love that yeah man in fact i\nwas thinking about getting hgt\nsomewhere on me i don't know i'm still\nworking on it i don't have any tattoos\nbut i think i might\nat some time uh at some point but i\nthink that's an awesome description\nthanks man i love that i love the dental\nanalogy oh yeah\ni love it i think it's brilliant and i\nthink what you're saying is so true that\nwe sometimes think of meditation and\nprayer as as the\nbe all and end all of our transformation\nbut actually initially it requires that\nstep of\nreally uprooting really rewiring the ego\ndoing the work of just\noh killing the ego deepest\nself-reflection yeah yeah yeah\nand and meditation prayer of course aid\nthat yeah but then they become that\nthey become that momentum that keeps it\ngoing right they're the daily cleaning\nyeah the daily cleansing and some people\nby the way and some people are\nare really blessed where they they grow\nup in a household\nwhere their parents gave them a great\nfoundation of mental health they gave\nthem a great foundation of knowing that\nthey're loved\ncompletely unconditionally or or yeah\nuncond\nright unconditionally yeah\nunconditionally i was like all of a\nsudden i was like wait what what is that\ndefinition\num yeah where it didn't matter if they\nyou know in my home if i accidentally\ndropped a glass and it broke on the\nground\nif my mom who as it turned out was a\nborderline personality\nif my mom happened to be in a good mood\nit was like oh that's fine honey if she\nwas in a bad mood it was the end of the\nworld now\ni didn't realize that every time she\nsnapped at us and yelled at us or\nsmacked us or whatever that was i mean\nnot like smacked us but you know would\ngive us a swat on the on the ass or\nsomething\nthose things were all leading me to\nhaving\nliteral trauma switches in my head so\nthat every time i then i drop a glass\nand break something\ni beat the [ __ ] out of myself i beat\nmyself up when i would do that\nso i needed to those are all those\nlittle things where i needed to\nreprogram literally rewire\nthe operating system that my mom had\ngiven me when i was a kid i needed\na an updated operating system and i\nthink that's what therapy\nreally hopefully allows us to do if\nyou're born into a home\nwhere you're given a pretty good\noperating system then meditation and\nprayer may be all you need\nat least for quite some time until you\nmaybe have more trauma or more abuse or\nwhatever where you need\nsome more help but for me the therapy\nhelped to\nclean that uproot that all that and the\nthe\num daily practice of going\nuh and literally falling before god and\njust\nwanting to uh\nremain in reality\nknowing who i am knowing knowing that my\nworth\nhas nothing to do with how successful i\nbecome\nor don't become that there are there is\npurpose for me in this world\nand that's where i think the trust part\ncomes in you know if you're not a very\nspiritual person or you don't believe in\na creator or a higher being or whatever\num\ni perhaps you trust in\nsomething else i don't know for me it's\na matter of trusting that\ni don't have all the answers i don't\nknow where my journey is going to go i\ndon't know how i'm going to be used in\nthis world and in this life\nbut i'm going to trust that as long as i\nkeep doing this work the\nreally the only important work that if i\ndo this then everything else\nwill happen the way that it's supposed\nto happen and uh\nthat gives me a tremendous amount of\npeace throughout the journey as well\nyeah i love that man and i think you're\nright i think we all need to trust\ntiming the process universe oh my god\ncreation like\nyou have to find patience patience\npatience\nright that you've been living in your\nlife and i definitely know that in my\nlife too when i went off to become a\nmonk at 22\nand you know that the reaction from all\nmy friends and family was\nwell you're never going to get a job\nagain like you know you're going to be\nyears behind and i will and all of those\nthings of like well where's\nwhere's your future going to go yeah and\nand for me it was no i trust that this\nis the best investment of my time that\nthis\ntime that i'm going to be spending in\nmeditation and self-growth and awareness\nand destruction on my ego and all of\nthat\nis the best thing i could be doing right\nnow yeah and and almost\nall we can do is trust the president and\ntrust what we're doing right now yeah\nbecause we all don't know what's going\nto happen in five 10 15 years no\nno and in fact i it's so cr i mean it's\neasy for me to say\ni'm i'm in a position now where i i'm\nliterally living\nin the some of the most rarefied air\nthat anyone could ever live in to be\nyou know the titular role in a superhero\nfranchise and\nthis 20 years of incredibly blessed life\nlike\nit's not lost on me that people say man\nyou know i'm so i'm so happy for you you\nreally deserve it and i'm always like\ni appreciate that and i know what you\nmean by the sentiment but i actually\ndisagree\nbecause i don't know that anybody\ndeserves this i mean look at all the\nincredible people\nthat have unbelievable hearts and minds\nthat are living\nin third world countries that have\nnothing\nthey deserve it those people are doing\neverything that they can just to survive\nso\ni don't know that anybody deserves any\nof this but had i\nknown what my life was going to be like\nright now\na year and a half ago before like if if\nsomehow\nuh you know the crystal ball said oh\ndon't worry you know all the things\nyou're worrying about right now no don't\nworry because what's going to happen is\nyou're going to do this and that's going\nto happen blah blah blah and now you're\ngoing to be there\nwell that would have been pretty\nincredible but would have been would\nhave been even better\nis if you know a year and a half ago two\nyears ago\ni would have just to trust\nto be patient with where this is going\nbecause\ni can't i wouldn't change anything a\nyear and a half ago there's so many\nthings in my past\nand my in my past that i would have\nchanged in order to\nmaneuver to get somewhere that i felt\nlike would have been a better place for\nmy life\nbut now that i am where i am where i'm\nsitting where i'm sitting\ni literally wouldn't have changed\nanything i wouldn't have changed the\ntrauma that my mom put me through\ni wouldn't change anything about the\nabuse that i went through because had i\nnot gone through that\nthen i wouldn't be able to sit here\nliterally right now talking to you and\nhopefully talking to people out there\nand saying you're okay we're okay we can\nget through this this is something that\nwe all\nare dealing with it's unfortunate that\nabuse and trauma and mental illness are\nbeing passed down generationally\nbut you it can be helped it can be fixed\nwe can love ourselves\nand we can love each other we can go\nmake the world so\ngroovy if we can just get this out and i\nwouldn't\ni wouldn't be able to talk about it as\ndeeply or as passionately or as\nauthentically\nhad i not gone through all of that stuff\nprior you know 100 percent 100\ni couldn't agree and being patient with\nthat yeah absolutely i'm so glad you've\nyou've driven that i mean you're like on\nfire right now by the way\nas it just it's it's so great to hear\nyou drive that message home because i\nfeel\nall of us need to be open to the plan\nlike you can get to where you want in\nlife just not in the way you imagine it\nyeah\nand that's the challenge that because it\ndoesn't look like your imagination\nyou don't want to walk down that road\nyeah right\nright you want it to look this perfect\nway or a certain way and i've done that\nin my life where\ni thought that success or happiness\nlooked like this\nand then when what i was faced with was\ncompletely the opposite\nit was scary to walk down that path and\nthe same is what you're saying like i\ndon't think we\ni don't think we want to blame this on\nour parents i don't think we want to\nblame it on\nand i don't hear that from you yeah you\ndon't want to blame it on any of those\nthings because those building blocks are\ngoing to give you the journey you need\nto help more people too hopefully\nbecause this is going to be a common\nexperience\nit's going to be a shared experience\nyeah and you can only help someone if\nyou've\nbeen there before well and that's why\nit's important i think that people you\nknow particularly when it comes to\nmental health we need to\nwe need to be brave enough to be\nvulnerable enough with\nour journey and our testimony you're\ndoing this man that well i appreciate\nthat but i\ni it's not even i don't even feel like\nit's an option i it's\nit's it is completely like it's god it\nis\nit is uh uh i i i literally like it it\nexcites me so much\nthat i have that i personally have gone\nthrough what i've gone through in order\nto be able to go talk about this stuff\nbecause i there's so\nthere are so many people out there that\nare that that are um\nthat look i see them on twitter and on\non instagram on a regular basis people\nthat are going through so much that are\nthat are feeling quite lost\nquite alone and that's why i spend as\nmuch time as i do on my social media\nbecause i feel like yes it's on one hand\none of the most destructive things\nthat's ever\ncome across all of us you know we get\nlost in that people are\nit's creating mental illness in a lot of\npeople but we can use it\nfor such powerful good and being able to\nreach out and say yes i deal with this i\nhave dealt with this and by the way\nwe're all dealing with it everyone is\ndealing with it like it\nno one is immune to well maybe the dalai\nlama i don't know\nbut you know what i mean like i it\nbecause this is how our brains work this\nis how our hearts work\nthe wiring is so old-school right like\nas in it's so\nembedded into the way we're wired that\nit takes time to unwire that and unravel\nthat like if something's happened\nfor thousands of years right it's gonna\ntake a considerable amount of time to\nrewire that it's like you don't just\nunwire something if something's been\ntangled in your closet\nfor for days how long does it take or if\nyour room's been messy and hold on\nyeah exactly what you can't do with\nyourself and you don't want to do with\nyourself and so\nand and i love how open you've been\nabout it a few interviews that uh we\nlooked and saw with you talking about\nhow\nyou know comparison on social media and\ncomparing yourself to your peers\nwhich is such a big thing and you were\nopen about the fact that when your\ncharacter first uh gets killed off in\nthor\nand talking about how like that felt\nlike a bad moment but actually now\nwith what you're getting to do you\nrealize that actually was just preparing\nyou for something much bigger exactly\nthis is exactly why you're going back to\nwhat we're talking about about patience\nand trust\ntrusting that even though you might not\nunderstand or agree with what is\nhappening\nin your life right now if you can look\nif you're not trusting your flailing you\nare\nthat's where anger can come in that's\nwhere doubt comes in that's where fear\ncomes in that's where anxiety comes in\ni was i didn't realize how much anxiety\ni dealt with\nprobably my entire life i didn't know\nthat that feeling that i felt on a\nregular basis was anxiety\nuntil i went to therapy and i was like\noh my god that's what anxiety that this\nis what i've been dealing with for so\nlong\num had i know like when i was doing\nthat that last thor um yeah it was\nit was a bummer i mean i you know i felt\nlike i was i was so stoked that i\nmade it into the superhero world and\nthen just to kind of\nyou know for it to do that like there\nwasn't much to do\nand i was definitely feeling a little\nsalty and a little uh\na little down on myself and a little\nlike okay well i guess that's it i guess\ni'll go have to pivot and figure out\nsomething\nelse in my career or whatever that's\ngoing to be but again had i\nknown had i known that you know\num if anybody's like no no zach don't\nworry about it because you're gonna\nyou're gonna die here\nbut then you know two years from now\nthat means that you're just going to be\nreborn in the dc universe i mean\nobviously that would have made me feel\nmuch better back then but i don't think\nthat's how life works\nbecause it's if we know what is going to\ncome then we don't ultimately appreciate\nwhat that's going to be we need to go\nthrough these valleys\nin order to appreciate those\nmountaintops\nand that's a and we go we don't grow to\nbecome that in the best way\nand that and you don't get the growth\nyeah if you don't go through the\nhardship where you have to actually come\nto the end of yourself\nand trust and be patient and know that i\ndon't know i don't know what's coming\nbut i'm going to be grateful for what i\nhave and i will trust in where this path\nis leading me\nthen you don't get the growth and the\ngrowth is the most important part\nyou could become the biggest most famous\nmost rich person in the world but if you\nhave not grown during any of that\nthen all of it's meaningless i want to\nbe you know you said earlier i\ni love the alliteration i don't know if\nyou use it when you start every\ninterview but\nwhat was it an enlightened enlivened and\nuh\nthere was another word you said that i\ncan't educate or educated yeah\neducated and empowered all of those\nthings that\nis the real rich richness the riches of\nlife\nlike i again i know it's it might even\nsound a little trite\nsomebody in my position saying like you\nknow it's not about the\nfame or the popularity or whatever\nbecause i'm somebody who now has\nwho has that and has had that and has\ndone very well financially in my life\num and i'm not saying and i'd give it\nall up if i could but in some ways yeah\ni suppose i would in some ways\nthere's there's deep down in me to know\nto know the to know the depth\nof of the joy and the peace and the\ngratitude that i feel\nnow on the other side of the darkness\nbecause of the darkness if i didn't\nexperience that darkness if i didn't\nif i didn't ever sit in my\nroom literally crying out to god\nto help me to save me to to\n[Music]\nshow me the way because i was so lost\num what i feel\ntoday i wouldn't be feeling you you get\nto the place you get to\nyou and it's not even the destination i\nmean because you know it's all it's\nstill the journey we're still journeying\nand by the way\nwho knows i could i could walk out of\nhere and get hit by a car and that's it\ni could i could uh live well yeah i mean\neither but i mean\nbut i but i think it's important to\nalways be aware that yeah you know i i\nthink that we are\num both infinitely valuable\nand entirely unimportant yeah that makes\nany sense you know invaluable and\ninsignificant exactly\nexactly and if we can always maintain\nthat and know\nthat right now right here is all we\nactually\nhave and to keep digging into the depth\nof the right here in the right now which\nis why one of the reasons i'm so\ngrateful that we're having this\nconversation because\nthis is a right here right now let's be\npresent and let's talk about what really\nmatters\nyou know i can go talk about shazam all\nday long and i'm grateful that we got to\nmake an incredible movie that\nis really genuinely bringing people so\nmuch joy um\nbut you know that's that's all the\ntrappings of what the most important\nstuff is which is let's go\nheal the world let's go make this place\nuh uh uh let's go\nlet's go teach more empathy let's go\nfeel more empathy\nand you were talking about earlier about\num you know the\nthe the knowing how much deeply more\ndeeply we can love someone when we know\nsomeone i mean that's\nempathy empathy empathy empathy empathy\nempathy empathy empathy empathy empathy\nyou know\noh god i just i just it's i love it it's\nthe best\ni love it let's let's uh i i want to we\nalways do a final five\nat the end of every interview but before\nwe do that i do want to talk about\nshazam\nbecause what i loved is you were talking\nabout how like you felt like you got to\nplay yourself\nit's not the child like yeah you know\nman child element to\nthe role and character i'm excited to go\nand see it this weekend yeah yeah i'm\nreally looking forward to it but\ntell me about that playful aspect of you\nand that joy that people are gonna feel\nthrough\nyou being able to be part of yourself\nyeah i i mean i\nlook i i've always um\ni've always been like i said like a\nsuper\nenergetic spazz of\na kid and i and that's never really left\nme and\nuh when i was about four i realized that\nuh i could intentionally make somebody\nlaugh and if they laughed they felt good\nand that made me feel good\neven aside from the applause or whatever\ni loved making people feel joy i loved\nit it's the greatest drug in the world\nand i on i and i feel like genuinely\nlike when i\ndo broadway or whatever like i feel like\ni'm living\nliterally living out my\npurpose and when you feel like you're\nliving out your purpose it is\nthe most fulfilling thing ever more than\nanything\num so uh but but part of that you know\nand i think also just part of\nworking in this business you get to\nhopefully use your imagination and\nshould use your imagination and i\nhave always tried to hold on to that\ni've always try to hold on to joy i love\nfeeling joy i love bringing joy um i\nlove having therefore love having a\ngreat time i love hosting parties i like\ndance parties\ni like singing i like karaoke i like\nriding motorcycles and jumping out of\nplanes i mean i\nthis is just my personality it's always\nbeen and all of those things\num you know i i think i've tried to\ngrow up and be a responsible human being\nin the ways that it's important\nbut i've also you know kind of shirt\nsome of that stuff the word i feel like\num people tend to feel like\nyou know we got to take this more\nseriously or we're going to take or or\nrather take ourselves\nmore seriously which i think we need to\ndo far less of we need to take ourselves\nfar\nless seriously and uh so all of those\nthings i think of i don't know helped\nkind of protect\nthe little kid in me um and by the way\nand maybe even\nsome of my mental illness that i again i\ni'm\nso grateful to god that even all of that\nbad stuff he used\nor he she or it or whatever used to\nmaintain this this essence of who i am\ndeep down inside\nand all of that i just got to filter\nright into the character i mean on top\nof the fact that ever since i was a kid\ni dreamt about being a superhero like i\nthink most of us do\nso it's a total wish fulfillment like\nyou know i feel bad for a lot of the\nactors who play\nthe serious superheroes which by the way\nmost of them are most of them are very\nserious adults\nwho are concerned with saving the world\nand so which i know in real life\nexactly right yeah exactly but you know\ni know that\nchristian bale was probably super\nchuffed that he got to be batman\nbut he had to sit on it he had to like\nbe he was like oh my god i get to be\nbatman and then the\nwere rolling it's like i'm batman you\nknow i got to just\nnot i got to you know literally not rain\nmyself in at all i all that enthusiasm\nthat i felt for like oh my god i'm\ngetting this dream job\ni just got to you know put that right\ninto the character onto the screen plus\nhanging out with the kids um uh which of\nwhich we have a whole incredible\nand talented cast of kids and that i\nworked with all the time and\nuh they would constantly remind me what\nit meant to be a kid which\nin a lot of ways is just not having\nresponsibility they\ndon't they're able to still be silly and\nnot take themselves so seriously until\nthey start getting into like high school\nyears\nand then all of a sudden it's all about\nclicks and cool and all that garbage\nthat\noh my god i can't wait to maybe do a\nschool tour one day and go to high\nschools and say\nstop stop don't don't care about social\nconstructs anymore\nstop it go do all the homework do all\nthe things that your parents and your\nteachers are asking you to do\nthere's a whole life beyond high school\nit's all just one big bubble it's going\nto blow up you're never going to see\nthose people again\noh my gosh there's so much time that we\nwaste wishing that we were a part of\nwhatever this cool clique is and by the\nway\neven that i want to redefine the word\ncool cool all the people that think\nthey're cool or are trying to be cool\nare the least cool being cool means\nyou're trusting\nbeing cool means you're not phased\nyou're not worried about fitting in\nlet's go be actually cool let's not go\ntry and be like oh i need to wear the\nright clothes or i need to have the\nright style or whatever that is that's\nall\nnonsense i can't oh i want all that to\ndie a horrible death\num yeah for real um but yeah so on top\nof all that yeah just like\nyou know getting to getting to to be\nthat kid and bring that kid to life on\nscreen is a lot of fun\nbut um\ni really again like the movie's done\nwell and i'm\nreally grateful that it's doing well not\neven just domestically but\ninternationally and all that\nuh but the thing i'm most proud of in\nthis film and the thing i'm most\ngrateful for is that\ni believe that you know again god is\nusing me to portray a character\nthat is bringing people joy people are\nleaving the theater\nand they are floating a foot off the\nground kids and adults\nare yelling shazam as they're leaving\nthe theater\nand feeling that uh imagination come\nback to life in them again\nand if if uh if what i believe\nis true which is that i was put on this\nplanet\nto to love people and to bring them joy\nand that this is what is now happening\nin my life\nlike i just gratitude just like the\ndeepest gratitude man\nthat's awesome man i love that and\nhearing you say that reminds you of\nsomething i read a while ago is\ni think you went on i want to get this\nright it went along the lines of\nuh we don't we don't stop playing\nbecause we get old we get old because we\nstop playing yes\nand and i think whatever play means to\nyou as you get older\nobviously you may not be messing with\naction figures maybe you are but the\npoint is of\ncontinuously having play in our lives\nand being playful yeah\nand being childlike not childish yes and\nwe see a lot of humans we continue to be\nchildish but not childlike\nyes and i think keeping that fresh eyes\nlooking at things as brand new\nliving as if every day is just some new\nexploration and curiosity\nthat that can stay with us so i love\nthis man i'm going to ask you my big\nfinal five questions let's do it\nuh these are rapid fire quickfire\nanswers so i mean you'd be great at that\nso here we go\nthe first one that i have for you is\nthis is this is probably a\nslightly trick question better but i\nwant to know anyway if you could have\none superpower what would it be\nteleportation oh interesting i thought a\nlot about that okay uh yeah i just think\ni think uh teleportation it would be a\nvery fun uh but also probably the most\nhandy and practical\nuh because you can go you can do\nanything from you know going on a trip\nuh with all of your friends we all know\nfrom the uh lore of comic books that\nwhatever you're touching goes with you\nwith teleportation\nso obviously as long as you can connect\nlike all your fingers and toes to a\nbunch of bags and a bunch of friends and\nfamily then you're all on a vacation\ntogether which would be great\nor if you're just feeling lazy and you\nwant to zap like from your bed into the\nbathroom and then back again\nyou know what i mean it's very handy\nawesome second question you were saying\nyou're even thinking about building like\na communist space yeah\nif if the world if you're if your ideal\nworld idle community ideal town or city\nhad a set of ideals values and beliefs\nand habits what would those be\n[Music]\nwell um minimalism uh that's one of the\nthings\ni am uh a huge proponent of minimalism i\nthink that we\nwe've all we've all been fed a lie for a\nreally long time\nwhich ties directly into consumerism and\nmaterialism and i really do believe it's\na lie we don't need all the things that\nwe think that we need and we are now\nowned by what we own\nand that is another thing that's leading\nus into more\nmental health issues and i i i want to\nget back to basics\nuh so it'd be it'd be community it'd be\nminimalism\nuh it would be love and grace and\ntolerance and understanding and\nforgiveness\nuh and more forgiveness and more\nforgiveness and more grace because\nthose these are seriously lacking in the\nworld right now and empathy and more\nempathy\nuh yeah and just helping people heal i\nlove that yeah i love that if you could\nget the world to practice one habit or\none tool for 30 days\nwhat would that have gratitude gratitude\nnice i like that\nthat's awesome yeah i think that could\nchange a lot too i\ni mean it's again i know it's it's i\nknow it's different for everyone in\nin every place that they're in in their\nlife and i don't expect everyone to have\nas easy a time being\ngrateful for where you are in your life\num but i\ni from my own personal experience to\nstart with that if you can get there uh\nit helps to\nput other things into place and then it\nmakes a lot of your life a lot easier\ni love it question four out of five\nwhat's one big thing you want to learn\nthis year\nanything you want to learn something new\nwell you know i i at new year\nuh i was on a trip with a bunch of\nfriends and we were all\nuh on new year's eve we were all talking\nabout what was if you could have\nuh one word that described your last\nyear what would it be\nand to be perfectly honest i oh i think\ni think\ntransformation was last year's because\nit was it was incredibly transformative\ntime for me\nbut then uh and what would be one one\nword for\nthe next year and the word that i chose\nwas uh patience\nso uh and then my friend actually made\nme this bracelet which is morse code\nuh that says forgiveness or says that\npatience on it and\ni think i think that that's what i want\nto continue to learn this year because\ni've always been\na super deep forward thinker of like\nfuture thinking and like you know like i\nwant to go build this\nfilm studio and all the things that go\nwith it and i i see it all in my head\nand i want it now i want it to be right\nnow because i want to i want to be\nenjoying it right now and i want all of\nmy friends and family and strangers and\neverybody to be enjoying it right now\nand i have to know that it's not up to\nme this timing is not up to me your\ntiming of your life is not up to you\nwe get to play a part in it and a very\nsignificant part in that\nbut there are so many other factors that\nare going on and so i\nreally want to learn to just be more\npatient in this life yeah\ni love that and the final five fifth\nquestion\nwhat's an ideal role or collaboration\nfor you in the future\nsomething that you'd love to know man\ncould be oh so many\nso many um\ni don't know i mean from an acting\nstandpoint i mean there's so many\ndirectors and other actors that i would\nlove to work with and\nyou know uh so i don't know working with\ntom hanks i think would be pretty\namazing he's always been my idol\nyou know since i was a kid um and to\nthat matter steven spielberg you know\nworking for for him as a director\num but i i but outside of the acting\nworld\nuh i i do want to start recording more\nmusic i i don't know with whom or how\nthat's going to work out\nbut then beyond that uh i really do want\nto somehow figure out how to parlay all\nof this stuff\ninto more of a leadership role in\nhelping the world heal you know that's\nthe collaboration that i really want to\nfigure out and\nthe trajectory that i really want to\nfigure out and again i'm just going to\nwait on god and be patient for\nwhat that is going to look like but um\nwe should work on that together\ni would love to j shetty we're going to\ndo it it's going to happen\nwhen you say it like that it feels like\nit's actually going to happen yeah man\ni would love that i would love that no\nbut thank you\nzach like honestly you like really\nbrought it today like the\nenergy this man is like i'm sitting in\nfront of him he's sweating\nliterally i'm sweating like he's\nliterally giving
