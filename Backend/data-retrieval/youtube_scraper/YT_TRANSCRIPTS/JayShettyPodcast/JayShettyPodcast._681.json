    "transcript": "you're both giving up something you both\nwant\nfor something both of you don't want\nthat's what a compromise is\nimagine i gave up what i wanted to do\nall the time\nto be where radi wanted me to be i'm\ngoing to be feeling upset\ni'm going to be thinking i should be\ndoing this or i could be doing this\nand then you develop bitterness towards\nthe other person where you can't even\nrespect and appreciate them i feel like\nyou actually\nmove closer away by forcing yourself\ntogether\nwhen actually you could move closer\ntogether by allowing yourselves to have\nthat space\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nand\nour annual episode with the one and\nonly radi devlucia\nwe do this every single year the first\never episode on the podcast\non the 14th of february 2019 was radhi\nwe did our one year celebration with\nradhi\nand this is now our two-year celebration\nwith radhi the podcast is now officially\ntwo years old oh my gosh that's amazing\nbut also i thought number one you'd keep\nmy seat warm for me\nis it not warm i mean and as seeing as\ni'm like probably the person that's been\non the podcast the most i thought maybe\ni'd have like some of my favorite snacks\nhere but\ni had to bring my own tea didn't i this\nis your house\ni had to bring my own tea didn't i this\nis your house and the snack cupboard is\nyours and you do own this but it's\ndifferent if you bring it for me\nbut i'm so excited to be here um and\nyeah i don't know\num what we're going to speak about but\ni'm very excited yeah so rodney and i\ndon't plan these what we do is we ask my\nteam\nfriends people we know people we don't\nknow\nto come up with questions that we can\ndiscuss and that's what we're going to\ndo today\nwe think 2020 was a incredible year\nfor relationships and the challenges it\nbrought with that so we want to dive\nin today about how we tried to navigate\n2020\nand as always these conversations are\ncompletely raw\nand open and vulnerable where we're\nsharing with you our mistakes the things\nwe got wrong the things we learned the\nthings we got right we're sharing\nall of it in this conversation so i\nreally really hope\nthat you enjoy this one as do i\nso let's go what should we start with\nso the first question the first question\nthat i have\nfrom our team is\nwhat do you find hardest about love\ni was actually thinking about this this\nmorning when i think about\ncoming and speaking here speaking here\ncoming and speaking to you\num and i was thinking about how you know\na lot of the time\nwhen you end up feeling um annoyed at\nyour partner\nor irritated in some way or when they\nreally annoy you\ni actually actually made me realize that\na lot of the time you know they say it\nends up being a reflection of you\nand i think a lot of when i think about\nwhat ends up like when we have our like\npetty arguments or whatever it is\ni feel like it's actually because it\nhits at a sore point of me realizing\nthat it's\nit's my whatever we're arguing about how\ni'm reacting it's my weakness\nand a lot of the time that stubbornness\nand so i feel like whenever we\ni think that's quite that's quite a\ndifficult thing when it comes to\nrelationships or love is that\nthe other person because you spend so\nmuch time with them and because\num you know they they know you better\nthan anybody else that they end up being\na reflection of actually you so every\ntime you end up\nhaving interactions with them that\naren't that great actually a lot of the\ntime you can sit there and be like\nmaybe that had a lot more to do with me\nhow i reacted\nrather than that other person but\nsometimes it's them too\nthat's a really good answer that's a\nreally good answer i think that's such a\ngood point i was\ni think what i'm saying is i would\nsecond that and\nto give another answer to give a\ndifferent answer i also feel the hardest\nthing in a relationship\nis you're always projecting\nyour strengths onto the other person's\nweaknesses\nso you want the other person to be\nmore like you but when you really think\nabout it you don't\nlike you like yeah yeah you love for not\nbeing like you\nbut when you say things like i'll give\nan example that\ni'm super organized disciplined\nlive by the schedule on time\ni and and and at times in our\nrelationship i've wanted you to become\nlike that yeah\nand do things like me and when i've\nreally sat with that and really thought\nwith that i realized actually i don't\nwant you to be like me because i love\nyou for not being me\nyeah and the things that you bring to\nthis relationship\nwhether it's spontaneity whether it's\nbeing fresh whether it's being\nalways alive like that's the strength\nand i think what we do in relationships\nis we dampen our partner's strengths\ninstead of amplifying them yeah and what\nthat does is\nit makes your partner feel like they\nhave to do something different or be\nsomething different but actually if you\namplify their strengths which is the\npart you love\nanyway yeah you're going to have a much\nmore fulfilling and exciting\nrelationship so i think that i find that\nhard because\ni think we all live in our heads yeah\nit's so true and we think the way we\nthink is the right hey what do you want\nto do tomorrow and you're like well i\nkind of have a\nnine to five like six schedule ready to\ngo for the next like six months and i'm\nlike oh\nso you don't want to go shopping with me\nor you don't want to go to like get some\nplants\nand yeah no i agree and and i feel like\nit's\nbut i also think from from that that\nyou know it also helps even if you're\nnot doing even if you feel like it's a\nnegative thing to\num to notice that and to um\nto try and correct it in the same way i\nthink you can also help the other person\ntighten up on that area of their life\ntoo like okay cool you may be super\norganized and i may be\nnot very organized at all but at the\nsame time we can find like a good middle\nground when we're together where it's\nlike okay you know that i like being\nspontaneous\nso maybe randomly you'll be like okay\ncool like what you do you're like oh you\nknow i won't\ni'll just cancel my meeting or i'll i'll\ni won't do this and let's just go do\nthis\nand for me i'm like oh okay and i i know\nthat i try to be a little bit more\norganized where i'm like okay i need to\nmake sure i do this today\ni need to make sure i give you this\ntoday like whatever it is like trying to\ntrying to make that better as well\nbecause even though it's a strength in\nsome ways every strength ends up being a\nweakness in some way too so i think it\nhelps\nyou know kind of balance it out as well\nand and help the other person notice\nwhen they need to probably change a\nlittle bit\nabsolutely okay second question is how\ndid your relationship change in 2020\nhow did you i kind of feel like this\nfelt like our like first year of\nmarriage because\nwe um probably well no not probably we\nhave not spent this much time together\nin our whole entire relationship\nand so i kind of feel like for me it\nfelt like we were on our\nhoneymoon type field where we just got\nmarried and we were learning so much\nmore about each other\nbut but then we ended up um\nyeah just just really understanding one\nanother and settling into each other a\nlot better\nthan we probably even have for the past\nhow many have been married like three\nyears\nfour years we've nearly been married\nfive years nearly five years\nbut it feels like one year um but yeah\nno i think it really made us\num it really helped us understand each\nother better it helped us get into a\nrhythm together which i don't feel like\nwe ever really had a rhythm together\num and so i think it's actually changed\num in most like in i can't think of any\nways that it's changing and negative i\nreally think that it's improved our\nrelationship\nthrough figuring a lot of stuff out but\nit's definitely got to a point now where\ni'm like oh wow this\nthat whole year was definitely a good\njump or a good step up for us yeah i'd\nhave to say one of my favorite things\nwas\nit was the first year where we started\ndoing a lot of\nphysical activity together because we\nalways go and\nlike travel together or something like\nthat but it was the first year we\nstarted actually working out\nand exercising together yeah so we used\nto go on\nhikes up griffiths park and then runyon\nand then we'd go on walks and just so\nmany\nopportunities to be in nature together\nbecause we weren't going to the gym\nand then we were doing in-home workouts\ntogether with a virtual workout\nand we'd put our playlist on with that\nsong that you were talking about the\nother day\nthat's the song of 2020 for me and i\njust think that we were forced to just\nspend so much time together but we\nactually found ways\nto do things we enjoyed together i think\nwe actually realized that\num we were spending time together in the\nwrong ways before\nlike i feel like that's what it made us\nrealize that we thought\ngoing shopping together or going to\nwatch a movie together\nwas like and sitting and watching a\nmovie together were the ways that we\nwould be spending time together\nand then we realized that actually we\njust really enjoyed doing\nwhether it's like normal things like\nworking out but it feels so much more\nfun for us\nthan sitting there and doing something\nthat feel i don't know\ni don't have to explain it but yeah like\nsomething that when we're not talking or\nwe're not interacting\num and the focus is somewhere else\nwhereas this it's like you're completely\nfocused on the activity completely\nfocused on the other person\nand um it was just so much more fun to\ndo that stuff together even if it is\njust like\nworking out and or going for a walk or\nwhatever it is but it felt so\nmuch more interactive and like yeah so\nmuch more fun\nyeah and for everyone who's listening\nand watching this was the year\nthat radhi and i've spent the most\nactual time together since we've been\nmarried\nyeah and since we were dating because\ni'm always traveling\nshe's back at home in london sometimes\nshe's traveling\nand for us to be in this space together\nwe we had to focus on learning about\neach other even more so\nit was a big change for us yeah and\nlike radi said i i think the same i\nthink it just brought about positives\nfor us thankfully\nand you know we we grew a lot closer\nthis year yeah and i do think it's also\nbecause we\nit i don't feel like it it felt natural\nbut at the same time it was natural\nbecause we were both\nvery aware and intentional of how we\nwere interacting with the other person\nbecause of how bad it's gone in the past\ni feel like we have been able to\nuse all of those mistakes that we made\nwhere we were\nreally trying to figure out a way for it\nto be better like we both had the\nintention of making it better\nwhether it was like quarantine whether\nit was whatever it was\nthat like i feel like we'd gone through\nso many times where we tried and it may\nbe like\nwe still weren't understanding each\nother we were like no this time we both\nactually really want to intentionally\nmake an effort\nto have conversations that we maybe\ndon't have to\nresolve things in a way that we don't\nnormally resolve things and so\nyeah i think i think that that's also\nimportant because it wasn't just like oh\nthis was nice like\nit just happened this way i feel like it\nwas definitely something we thought\nabout and tried as well\ni'll do a question for um\ni was thinking about this earlier too\nlike and i was going to ask you\nseparately but i thought why not ask you\non here put you on the spot\num what is like okay for example you\nknow in\na relationship when one person asked the\nother person to do something like i\nalways think about this with you because\nyou always regardless of when i ask you\nto do something\nno matter if you're like let's say\nsomething simple like we're both sitting\nwatching something and i'm literally\nlike to you oh i really want this\nand like i haven't even asked you to do\nit but you'll literally get up and\nyou'll go and do it for me\nor like i'll ask you to go get something\nand you'll like you won't even flinch\nlike you'll go out of your way to do it\nand actually i was thinking about it and\nlike that seems like such a small thing\nbut i actually feel like it's not\nbecause a lot of the time where even if\nit's with your mom your dad whatever it\nsays\noh do i really have to go and get it\nlike can't you just go do it yourself\nbut you i feel have generally always\nbeen like that and so i'm just gonna ask\nyou\nbecause i think it'll be helpful for\nother people too and helpful for me like\nwhat goes through your mind\nwhen even if i'm being really irritating\nor\nbeing a brat like what makes you just\ncontinually do that\nwithout yeah without like moaning\nthe first thing that goes through my\nmind is you are such a brat yeah\nyou are you are closer to that light\nswitch right now\nyou are closer to the water container\nright now\nyeah why are you asking me to do this\nthat that's the first thing that goes\nthrough my life\nand then and then my monk mine comes in\nand\nthere's two sides to it first of all i\nknow you're not asking me\nbecause you're trying to make my life\ndifficult you're doing it because you\nwant to be loved that way\nand i think that when you realize if\nyou're in a loving trusting relationship\nyou start realizing that your partner's\nrequests even if they seem\nunreasonable and irrational a lot of the\ntime that's just how\nyou want to be loved in that moment and\nwhen you see it in that way\nyeah you go yeah of course i want to\nlove you in that way\nbecause you're not doing it to hurt me\nbecause i know you love me you're not\ndoing it to upset me\nyou're obviously not doing it to\nirritate me so then the\nonly reason you could be doing that is\nbecause you need some love right now\nand you need love in that way or you\nneed connection in that way or you need\nintimacy in that way and so you're\nasking for it because\nit's a request for love and\ni think we think of requests for love as\nlike oh give me a hug\nor i need to talk to you we think of\nthose things but actually it's the\nday-to-day moments\nin the small things where someone's\nsaying please love me\nplease see me please show up for me\nplease bring me a snack\nplease bring me a snack and and i think\nwe mistake that language because we\nthink\noh that person's being so irritable so\ndemanding\nso demanding and maybe they are and and\nthat's something that you have to check\nfor yourself\nso if you are that person rather\nthen then you have to check for yourself\nwhether it is demanding and stubborn or\nwhether it is a\nrequest for love yeah for yourself but\ni've made it in my mind that i believe\nyou love me\nand so if i believe you love me then i\nshould believe that this is you asking\nfor love\nand so but if i didn't believe you loved\nme and i really would be so annoying\nthen it would be really annoying yeah\nand so it doesn't mean that i don't have\nthat thought it doesn't mean that i\ndon't get internally frustrated with you\nfor a second\nand then straight after that this kicks\nin and that walks me through it and i\nthink\nwhen people sometimes say to me like oh\nwell\nhaven't you got it all figured out i'm\nlike no the first thought is never\nthe thought that has it all figured out\nthe first thought is always\noh gosh whatever whatever whatever yeah\nit's the second thought\nit's allow it's it's taking that time to\nhave that second thought rather than\nreacting to the first\nyeah yeah so that's the answer to that\nquestion\nthat's great thank you i've always\nwanted that\ni have actually so this question came in\nfrom our team it says tell me about a\ntime\nwhere you think we've made a compromise\nand how did it work out i'm gonna go\nfirst i know the first thing you're\ngonna say is\ni don't believe in compromises in\nrelationships you know me so well\nso that's exactly what i was gonna say i\nwas like as soon as i hear the word\ncompromise\ni have a i have a very interesting\nrelationship with the word compromise\nbecause i believe that compromise makes\nyou feel\nthat both of you are giving up something\nyou want\nfor something you both don't want one\nwhich doesn't make any sense\nrepeat that repeat that rewind\nthat's a good point go on have a have a\nj shetty moment\nso so i have a\nreally interesting relationship with the\nword compromise\nbecause i don't understand what\ncompromise means\nis that you're both giving up something\nyou both want\nfor something both of you don't want\nthat's what a compromise is so it feels\nlike\none person is getting what they want and\nthe other person is not getting what\nthey want that's what a compromise is\nwhereas what i have tried to live by in\nour relationship is\ni want you to get what you want and i\nwant to get what i want\nnow if that doesn't mesh all the time or\nif that doesn't\nconnect all the time then the only thing\nthat's being compromised\nis this false view that we should always\nfeel the same way about everything and i\nthink that just makes\nthat actually makes space for resentment\nit makes space for bitterness it's\nalmost\nlike think about this everyone who's\nlistening and watching think about this\nfor a moment\nimagine i gave up what i wanted to do\nall the time to be where radhi wanted me\nto be\ni'm going to be feeling upset i'm going\nto be thinking i should be doing this or\ni could be doing this\nand then you develop bitterness towards\nthe other person where you can't even\nrespect and appreciate them\nand if you were always dragged to what\ni'm doing you may be thinking well i\ncould be doing this or i could be doing\nthat\nand what ends up happening is i feel\nlike you actually move\ncloser away by forcing yourself together\nwe say that again you actually end up\nyou actually end up moving\nfurther further you actually end up\nmoving further away\nby forcing yourself to be together yes\nwhen actually\nyou could move closer together by\nallowing yourselves to have that space\nso that's my relationship with the word\ncompromise we've both\nbeen very happy for the other person to\nlive freely to do what they\nwant to do and without pressure of being\nlike okay cool it's my friend's birthday\nfor example and if you're not that\ninterested in coming or i'm not that\ninterested in coming with you\nit's not like oh my gosh but you have to\ncome like we're a couple we can't go\nplaces without one another like\nwe're just okay cool like you don't need\nto go and we understand that too it's\nlike yeah it's gonna be boring for you\nlike you don't need to come with me\nand we're very good at making it quite\nclear if something is important to us\nwhether it's family stuff whether it's\nwhatever say okay cool you don't need to\ncome to this family thing but i would\nreally appreciate it\nif you could make some time and and come\nhere and so i think it's also that where\nit doesn't feel like a compromise if one\nthe you know that it's that it's the\nsame thing as what you were saying about\nthe\nbringing me water or snacks it's like\nyou know that the person loves you\nand so if they if you make explicitly\nclear what's valuable to you\nand they still don't feel and you still\ndon't feel heard by them\nthen that's one thing but like if i know\nthat you love me\nand you know what's important to me i\nfeel like you always know when you need\nto show up\nand if for example you haven't and i may\nnot have communicated it to you if i\ntell you afterwards\nit's always like oh i'm so sorry i had\nno idea that's how you felt\num and so yeah i think it's important\none like\nletting the other person know what is of\nvalue to you and whether it's actually\nthat important\nnot being like oh come with me and the\nperson says no and then you're like oh\nokay fine\nlike it's it doesn't have to be like\nthat it can be a oh but please i really\ni like this is really important to me\nso it's being it's communicating and\nletting you know about that and also\nyeah understanding that the other person\nloves you and that\nif they are saying no it's not because\nthey're trying to hurt you it's because\nthey\nmaybe genuinely have something that's\nmore important to go to\nor to do yeah and and i think you're\nright that you\nthat's a really good point because you\nexpect the other person to read your\nmind\nand to know why it should be important\nto you and yeah yeah you often have that\nthought like you should know this\nis important to me but but the truth is\nthat in every relationship like\nno one knows until you explain to them\nand i think in our\nlove relationships and our romantic even\nin our friendships yeah we just\nexpect everyone to fully know what we\nvalue\nyeah it's like with even with family for\nexample just\nif if someone is really close to their\nfamily you expect in your mind that they\nrealize that that's an important thing\nbut if for example\nthat person is not that close to their\nfamily in their mind it's like oh it's\nmy uncle's birthday\ncome to my uncle's birthday and you're\nlike i won't even go to my own you're\nnot you but generally\nsomeone else might be like oh i won't\neven go to my own uncle's birthday\nbecause i'm not that close to them\nso i think it's like you are expecting\nthe other person to live\nhow you live and how you have your\nrelationships or\nhow you value things and it's it's an\nunfair expectation because people have\nbeen through so many different things in\nlife\nawesome all right next question on the\nlist next up\nis we both have such hectic schedules\nin life and lots of work going on and\nall our commitments how do we\nfind time to spend time alone and time\nwith each other\ni can also actually have so many so my\nfamily member's always like but does he\nhave time to spend with you like do you\nguys have time and i was speaking to one\nof my um\nfamily friends the other day and she was\njust like are you sure you guys spend\ntime with each other\nand i was like yeah we spend a lot of\ntime together but but i can understand\nwhy people may think that but\nyeah you know what i don't feel like\nwe've ever really felt\ni i feel like even if we've had the\nmoments where we've had like months\napart\nwe do make an effort that when we are\ntogether especially recently within the\npast year\nor two years would you say you say two\nyears we've started doing yeah we\nstarted doing a thing where we make sure\nthat we have at least a weekend that we\nspend solid together and sometimes\nthat's more time that you spend together\neven if you were seeing someone every\nsingle day for like a month because\nit's condensed time it's it's\nintentional\nand it's um with the sole purpose to\nspend time together and communicate um\nand be together in a meaningful way so\nyeah we definitely um make that time but\nit's also because we choose to do that\nyeah i think we both thankfully\ngravitate towards\nquality time versus quantity of time and\nso\nwe'll both be like well if we're both\ntired today\nwe'd rather not force ourselves to try\nand spend time together and give each\nother space\nor give each other time to decompress\nand this weekend we'll make sure we\nspend time together\nrather than the artificial force of like\ntoday\nwe had to spend time together because we\npromised or we said we would\nand it's like but maybe we're both not\ngot the right energy right now\nwe haven't got that presence right now\nand so i think it's a mutual\nunderstanding\nat the same time i feel like you know\nthey've been different parts in our\nrelationship like i remember\nwhen we lived in new york we probably\ndidn't spend a lot of quality time\ntogether because\nthe only time i had off was the weekends\nand i was busy working sometimes too\nand you were doing all your courses and\nyour work on the weekends\nand so i spent a ton of my weekends\nalone and you spent a ton of your weeks\nweekends\nweekdays alone yeah yeah and\nif you think back that's that's\nliterally was the pattern of our life\nfor two years and then there was travel\nto london\nand everywhere else i was going and i\nthink\nthrough all of that it was always just\nabout savoring those\nmoments it was about really cherishing\nand realizing that we were in a building\nphase and so\ni want to address something here\nactually that i think will be really\ninteresting for people\nis i talk a lot about like\nthe five cycles of life that we all go\nthrough so we have learn\nexperiment perform struggle\nthrive and so these like different\nstages you go through every year\nand when we were in new york we were in\na build\nphase of our life like we were both\nbuilding we just got married\ni'd literally just started my career you\nwere discovering your career\nwe were in a build phase yeah and i\nthink when you expect a lot from your\npartner when you're both\nbuilding it can be really demanding but\nnow we're at a stage in our life where\ncertain things\nwe're performing in where i've got a bit\nof a rhythm and a role and so i'm able\nto give more time and you're in this\ndifferent stage in your life and\ni feel like when you start looking at\nyour life as stages\nyeah as opposed to like everything this\nis gonna be forever\nforever yeah it's like it can't be that\nway and\nthere's actually a really good book on\nthis by gary chapman\nand i think it's called the four seasons\nof love or the four seasons of\nmarriage or relationships and it talks\nabout how\nis yours is your relationship right now\nin the season\nof summer winter spring or autumn now\nwhen i think about this\ni think that all of us want our\nrelationship to always be in summer\ni mean i like winter but oh yeah okay\nyeah\nwe always want our relationship to be in\nsummer in the sense that it's hard\nit's passionate it's cool it's like\neverything's good about summer right we\nall look forward to summer\nbut maybe your relationship's at a point\nin life right now as this book says that\nyour relationship might be in winter\nit's going for a dark period a cold\nperiod where you just got to stick it\nout together\nyeah when i think about new york yeah\nwhen i think about us in new york it was\na bit of winter in spring\nyeah like it was a bit of winter in\nspring and autumn's like where you've\ngot to let go and you've got to shed\nand i think about when we first started\ndating there were moments where our\nrelationship was in autumn\nyeah where we were just letting things\ngo\nand purging and removing energy i know\nwhen you were\ngoing to yoga classes and yeah yoga\nteacher training\nso i just i think that book's a great\nmodel and that reflection that i've had\nfor a while that\nyour life goes through stages and\nseasons\nand stop trying to make every day and\nevery week summer\nyeah i really love that that's so cool\nwhat a great book yeah i had a\nreflection i started researching and\nthen i found the book\nand the way i was thinking about it is\nlike if you know it's winter\nyou take an umbrella out yeah you know\nit's winter you put a coat on\nyeah but if you think it's summer you\nkeep expecting your partner to\nyou know anyway so this is an\ninteresting question what film or tv\nshow do you think offers the best\nexample of a healthy relationship\noh my gosh that's such a good question i\nautomatically in my mind\ngo to um this is us because one of my\nfavorite shows ever\ni've never seen it you've never seen it\nbut it's so good\nand um we love chrissy our good friend\nlove chrissy um but there are actually\nreally lovely examples\nof couples who like make it through\nstuff in that\nwhether it's like the main couple i'm\nsure to be honest most people have\nprobably seen it you just odd one out\nbut um yeah the main mum and dad and\nthen there's\num sterling what's his name sterling\nbrown sterling\nthe actor yeah probably yeah yeah i\nthink that's something sterling or\nsterling something you'll know who i\nmean but their relationship is amazing\nbecause they go through so many ups and\ndowns but they're so good at\ncommunication\nand i i feel like that's a very good\nshow\nto show very different types of\nrelationships even chrissy's\nrelationship with her\npartner her husband on the show they're\nall so different\nin relationships and the way they\ncommunicate but\nthey show very good um yeah\nvery very realistic and and\nuh useful relationships i feel yeah i\nlove that show\nit's so good i actually struggle with\nthis question because i think\na i don't watch a lot of tv shows but i\ndo watch a lot of movies\nand i think growing up i had a really\nunhealthy view of love because of movies\nit's so true so i grew up watching\nbollywood movies\na lot and i remember thinking that\nthat's what love had to look like\nyeah like a flower comes up in the\nmiddle when two people are about to kiss\nyeah they do in bollywood or like you're\nall like dancing around\nand like there's all this like field\nthere's all this puppies\nyeah and like music's playing when you\nfall in love and i'm running towards you\nin slow motion and my hair naturally\nfalls\nlike this yeah and you're coming towards\nme\nand then it cuts because they don't show\nanything else in bollywood films\nyeah back in the day and so so that's\nwhat you i grew up with\nunhealthy projections of love yeah and\nthe the thing that comes to mind when i\nam thinking about this\napart from the last dance michael jordan\ndocumentary which doesn't show marriage\nbut shows like\nlove in a team and camaraderie and\ncollaboration i'll try and find a bit\nmore of a\ni actually think the happy place uh the\ngood place sorry the good thing i always\ncall it the happy place kristen bell's\ncharacter eleanor\nand her relationship with chidi like the\nway it shows\nrelationship dynamics is really\ninteresting\nabout like what is a good relationship\nwhat is support what is friendship like\ni think it answers a lot of deeper\nquestions\nyeah that's such a good show it's such a\ngreat show i'm enjoying it so much and\nwe came to it late but\nbut we're loving it yeah and i just\nthink it has so many good messages so\ni'd have to go with that\nokay cool this is us and happy place\nyeah no was it\nthe good place good place yeah i call it\nthe happy place\nand yeah and i'm going back to what the\nshows i grew up and i grew up on the oc\nand desperate housewives both not good\ngood examples of\nrelationship ideas and and friends you\ngrew up on which again\ndid you get i wouldn't say it's like the\nbest relationship\nstuff it's just comedy and yeah but i\nagree with movies\nit's for girls and for guys i guess i\nguess i didn't think that it was such a\nbig thing for guys\nbecause you never i don't know growing\nup i always think guys just\nlike don't think about like romance in\nthat stage of their life but for girls i\nthink for sure\nyou're just always seeing how like the\nthe girls like the damsel in distress\nand the guy like\nsaves him saves her and i think it's\num yeah movies mess you up\nokay this is an interesting question do\nhave you ever experienced doubt\nin our relationship and how do you\nexpress\ndoubt\n[Music]\ni guess maybe like right at the\nbeginning when\num i'm trying to think i'm sure i'd\nwrite the beginning and then like you\nknow just before you're getting married\nand like everything's like a bit\nconfusing and\nthere's just so much going on because of\nwedding and then you're like oh my gosh\ni have to get married to this\nperson no i don't know\ni want to know yeah i think i think\nprobably just i guess just at the\nbeginning when everything was so\nup in the air because like you know as\nuh\ni'm sure in most cultures but in\narchives it's like the man should have a\njob and the man should be the\nbreadwinner and\nlike which is not true you should have\nno which is not true but and he should\nhave everything figured out before\nyou get into a relationship with that\nperson like everything should already be\nset before you even think about marriage\nand we really didn't have that and so i\nthink probably the beginning\nbut i was so lucky because my mum and\ndad really were just so\nokay that i naturally feel doubts can\ncome into your mind when other people\nget in your mind um\nbut i think i was quite sure i felt like\ni felt like\nstraight away i knew i had a connection\nwith you i knew that your values and the\nperson that you were\num i i just knew we would be able to\ngrow so deeply together\nand that's really what i was focusing on\nand then i was so lucky that the rest of\neverything else fell into place\nbut and i'm so grateful for that but i i\nknew that the core thing that i wanted\nin the relationship was there for us to\ngrow\ndeeper in our spiritual lives together\nand that was the main focus for me\nand then yeah and then we started having\nfun i was like oh he is fun like he's\njust\nnot just like a teacher and like just\nso deep but you also were so fun and and\nall the things that i maybe hadn't\nthought about was important to me slowly\nstarted coming i was like oh that is\nreally important to me gosh i didn't\nrealize that at the beginning that\nthat's what i wanted\num but yes the doubt was definitely\num was definitely\nlike taken away by me constantly going\nback to the fact that i wanted to be\nin that relationship with you for that\nreason and um\nyeah yeah yeah that's a that's a good\nhonest answer yeah i think\ni think my only doubt was\nalways and and it's funny because it's\nso hard to express this because i\nremember\nit was really funny when your family had\nmentioned this to you and it was like\nare you sure he's not going to run back\nand be a monk\nback to the monastery and it's so\ninteresting because my only doubt in our\nrelationship\npreviously not anymore had ever been\nthat\nshould i have been alone yeah so my\ndoubt was never like you or another\nperson or if you were the right person\nyeah it's always been it's either you or\nme being alone\nand and i think that comes from me\nloving being alone and spending so much\ntime alone and i think\nthere was a part of our relationship\nwhere because i was spending long\nperiods on my own yeah i always\nconsidered that and i and i had that\nconsideration of like oh is this what\ni'm meant to be doing like should i have\ndone this like\ni and i think a bit part of my doubt\ncame from a\ncame from a bit of sadness that i was\nlike oh am i taking her away from her\nfamily\nam i taking her you did her dreams\nam i taking like that was where my doubt\nof should i have been alone came from\nwas\noh no maybe i'm like for my pursuing of\nmy purpose\nwhich i'm really dedicated to totally\nyeah\nam i taking her away that was when my\ndoubt came from that\nam i so selfish that maybe i should be\ndoing my purpose alone\nwhy should i drag someone else on my\njourney and i actually think in the\nbeginning i probably felt that way too\nlike i i probably when we went to new\nyork it definitely felt like\ncompromising because i felt like the\nonly thing i really\nhad at that time in my life that i truly\nvalued and felt i was very\nconcrete in was my family and that's\nwhat my whole life revolved around and\nso\ni guess at the beginning because i\nhadn't matured in my\nthoughts of of what this relationship\nwas i did feel like that and i\nand i remember there used to be times i\nwas like well um\ni can't remember but i'm sure that there\nwere moments where in my mind i felt\nlike well we have to go back for my\nfamily to do this because you've taken\nme away\nanyway like you've taken me to new york\nand so now we have to do this because i\nwant to do this or we have to\nlike you need to do this for me because\nwe've done this for you\nand um yeah but but i but i definitely\nnow looking back i realized actually it\nwas all so much more for like it\nso i i don't feel that way at all\nanymore but i can um\nyeah i can i can relate i probably had\nthose feelings a little bit at the\nbeginning that you\nyou're probably feeling from me no it's\ngood i i think these are great\nconversations to have and\nwhat's interesting about these\nconversations though is that\nsometimes you don't have them in the\nmoment yeah if you don't monitor that\nwell that could end up breaking\nsomething\ndefinitely and we're lucky that it\ndidn't i feel like it could have though\nif if i hadn't if if i then didn't\nchoose to like\nfigure out what was going wrong with me\nand i was projecting that all on you and\nmaking it feel like it was\nit was the issue was our relationship or\nthe issue was you but really it was me\nhaving a lack of awareness of myself\nthat i had to i had to do that otherwise\ni think i would have constantly kept\nblaming\non that and constantly felt that way and\ni have so much admiration for you and\nrespect for you because of that\nbecause i think that it's so easy i was\nalways trying to compensate and help in\nwhatever way i could but\ni feel like you doing that\nis what's made our relationship so\nstrong is that you've just really worked\nhard on the last few years of finding\nyourself\ndiscovering yourself working and you've\ntried a lot of things like yeah\nyou've it's not been easy and you know i\ni feel like i found my thing when i was\n18 and\ni've been doing it for 15 years and it's\nfunny for me to think that because a lot\nof people\nonline are like oh jay you've only been\ndoing this online for like three or four\nyears and i've been doing this for 15\nyears\nbut for you i've watched you since that\nwe've met\nwhich was you know sorry since we've\nbeen together which is what nearly eight\nyears now\nand i've seen you like try this try that\nexperiment with this and actually it's\nbeen really amazing why don't you tell\npeople about how you feel\nyour journey's been of discovering your\nreal passion because i think\npeople see you now and you've got your\namazing youtube channel\nand your instagram page and all the\nwonderful stuff you're doing and people\nmay think oh yeah rather just\nand yes you've always had this energy\nthat everyone loves you for and that i\nfell in love with you for\nbut the way you're expressing it now has\ndefinitely evolved\nright yeah definitely i to be honest i\nfeel like i had no idea what i was doing\nuntil till beginning of or like\nwhat march last year when all of this\nstarted happening and it was the first\ntime i had to\nliterally sit there and be like oh crap\ni have no excuse of\noh i can't do this because i have to go\nwith jay travelling like i can't start\nmy own thing because\nyou know i'm never really in the country\nand it's really difficult i just want to\nfocus on what jay has and i'm\njust there to support him and i realized\nas much as that was true and i did want\nto do that\nit was probably a big um covering\nfor me not wanting to actually figure\nout what i wanted to do because\neverything just felt so scary to start\nsomething um and yeah it just kind of\nstripped\nall of that away where i i was like no i\nhave to fill my days with something that\nfeels meaningful\nand and figure out what that is to me\nand how that looks to me\nand so i just started and yeah i\ndefinitely\ntried so many different ways and\ndifferent things whether it was like i\nmade a did a website during that time\nand you know it's not the best website\nbut it's like the website that i started\noff with and i put so much effort into\nit did like 100 recipes within\nwhat a couple of months because i really\nfocused on it and and it just showed me\nbecause i was such a person that\ni would start something in as soon as i\nfelt a little bit overwhelming or even\nfelt like it was\ngetting good or succeeding in some way\ni'd be like oh my gosh that means i have\nto take another step forward and i'm not\nsure i want to do that okay let's just\nshut it down and go somewhere else and\ndo something else and i and i\ni realized that pattern that i had and\nso i was really determined to not do\nthat with this because\ni almost like get in my own way of being\na failure\nin my mind being a failure because i\nchoose to not take the next step not\nbecause anything else comes in my way\nbut because the fear of the next step\nwould always scare me scary enough to\nnot want to take it\nand so it was really amazing actually i\nwas like just looking at myself from an\nlike outside perspective and i was like\noh my gosh i never ever thought she\ncould do this like i never thought i\ncould do that\ni never thought i would actually still\nbe making recipes i thought it was like\nsomething i do for a month and then get\nbored and be like ah\ncan't bother to to keep adding onto this\nwebsite anymore\nbut um yeah and then and then i did my\ndecided to try my youtube thing which oh\nmy gosh took so long to actually\nstart because of fear again\npushing me away from it but i just i\nmean you've always been so amazing and\nsupportive in that constantly like\nyou see everything happening for me\nbefore i even dream about it\nand i think it's just been so nice\nbecause whenever i've had doubts you've\nbeen so amazing at helping me through\nthem\npractically where it's either it's in\nlike a supportive way of just love but a\nlot of the time it's really\ntaking the time to have the\nconversations with me and i avoid the\nconversations\nand you're like okay what do you need to\ndo next like what is it i'm like i don't\nwant to talk about it right now i\nhaven't figured it out and i just don't\nwant to speak about it\nbut you constantly would help like push\nme through because you saw that i was\ncoming from a place of fear not because\ni actually didn't want to\nand i think that's really important too\nit's like i know with a lot of your\nstuff like nine percent of time you\ndon't necessarily need to speak to me\nabout it\nbut there are certain times that you do\nwant to discuss things and\nvice versa like i obviously like this i\nobviously need um\nyou to input in a lot more of my stuff\nbecause i feel like\nyou've done a lot of the things that\ni've done and i really appreciate your\nadvice for it\num but i think there is so much of\nthe support being in so many different\nways throughout the times that i needed\nit\nand um yeah i just i didn't realize i\ndon't know how i did\nhow i got here but i'm really happy that\ni did it i'm so happy because\ni never expected myself to be able to do\nthat ever and i i just genuinely feel\nfor any everybody else that's listening\nto this that\ni was like that's where my spontaneity\nthat can be a strength and\nended up being something that was such a\nweakness for me in the areas where i\nwanted to commit to something\nand um yeah i just i honest and\ni'm not just saying this genuinely if i\ncan do it ask my mom\nshe will tell you if i can do it i 100\nknow that other people can\nwhatever it is that you love doing just\ntry it out and\num yeah if i can do it oh my gosh\nyou all can definitely do it but enough\nabout me\nwhat i genuinely love about the way\nyou're doing it though is that\neven though you have become more\norganized and disciplined and focused to\nfigure this out\nyou haven't lost who you are yeah and i\nthink that's the hardest part and i love\nseeing that in you\nlike each and every video the amount of\neffort you put in\ni know the amount of effort that goes\nbehind the scenes when you're about to\nlaunch a video\nand like your nerves and your excitement\nand you just want to make everything so\nwonderful for everyone\nand i love that i love that even though\nyou've become organized and focused and\ndisciplined and all those things that\nyou've had to learn\nthat you haven't lost yourself in it\nbecause i think that's possible too so i\ni love watching it and\nit makes me really happy and and what\nyou were just saying at the end\nyou know there's there's an old\nrelationship rule of like don't keep the\nscore\nand it's been said for many many years\nof like don't keep score in a\nrelationship\nbut often score feels like oh i did this\nfavor what did someone else do\nand what i've realized is that score\nshould not be kept\nenergetically and so what i mean by that\nis\ni really feel that\nyou carry the relationship sometimes\nemotionally and so i may be carrying it\nmentally\nbut you're carrying it emotionally and\nso if you're only looking at the mental\nscore\nright i'll be going like oh well i'm\ndoing everything why are you not doing\nanything mentally like you're not\nplanning\nyou're not setting goals you're not\ndoing this but that's because i'm\nonly measuring it on my scorecard and i\nthink it's so important to be like well\nthere are so many different scorecards\nthere's physical financial\nmental emotional spiritual there are\nfive scorecards\nfirst of all there shouldn't be a\nscorecard but i'm saying there's five\ntypes of offering\nin a relationship and you're only ever\nlooking at the one you give\nbut it's also useful to think of it in\nthat way like you're saying there's not\nscorecards but i think it's useful\nbecause\ni think naturally we all have tendencies\nto\nwant to be the hero or like want to be\nthe person that like oh but i've done\nthis and i've done that and so actually\nlooking at it in that way\nallows you to see where your strength is\nin your school card but then realize\nhopefully where the other person is also\ncontributing so i think\nyeah um but yeah that's so that's really\na good way of putting i've never thought\nof it in that way yeah no i've thought\nabout that so many times i think\nwhenever i've been in that position of\nlike oh i'm doing so much for this\nrelationship and\nand i do there are times when i feel\nlike i'm like yeah i'm doing this\nand then you just stop and you're like\nthat's just stupid\nbecause there are so many levels you\ncarry the relationship on totally\nand and i encourage everyone to do that\nwith their partner is just\nreally look at like where are you\ncarrying the relationship and where\nare they carrying the relationship and i\npromise you that someone in your\nrelationship is carrying something and\nif they're not carrying anything then\nsure that's\nthat's not a great relationship but i\nthink there are so many relationships\nwhere we miss what someone's doing\ni think that really stops you from um\nand actually having i didn't think of it\nin that way but whenever i do\nthink about when i'm irritated at\nsomething or when i feel that way\nthinking about it in\nyour way and sometimes i have thought\nabout it in that way\nit makes you really not be selfish like\nit makes you\na lot of the times if you feel that way\nyou can end up stopping yourself from\ncontinuing\ncontinuing to do that or continuing to\nbe the person carrying\nthis section but i think when you think\nof it as these other\nfour areas that could that other person\nmay be helping in or carrying\nit stops you from limiting yourself in\nwhat you can give and realizing that\nactually i could be giving everything in\nthis category and that's okay\nbecause he's giving everything in this\ncategory and i don't want that category\nso i'm good for him\nto handle that um and so\nyeah i think like one that just reminds\nme of all the the stuff i always get\nlike even when i put up cooking stuff or\ni'll get d i'm just being like\nyou know does jay ever cook for you and\ndoes jay do this for you and i'm like\nno and it doesn't irritate me at all\nbecause i don't like doing finance stuff\nlike\nit may be such a cliche of like how you\nknow i like being in the kitchen but\nit's out of choice like i love being in\nthis it's not because you're a woman\nit's not because i'm a woman that's what\ni mean\nyeah yeah yeah and like sometimes when\nyou there's been times remember when\nlike some days i'll be like\num someone will you'll be like oh\nsomeone's come to a house and you're\nlike yeah this is her work\narea and some people don't even know\nwhat i'm doing and i'm like\nare we both laughing yeah i always i\nalways show people my office which is\nwhere we are now\nyeah and then when we get a kitchen i\nwould say and this is riley's office and\ni don't mean it\nin a condescending or sexist way at all\nit's actually her office yeah like\nthat's where you experiment and that's\nwhere you create recipes and yeah\nbut but yeah i just think it's it's\nreally it's really important that\nbecause i do\nstill always get people but like does it\nit doesn't annoy you that he doesn't\ncook doesn't it know you they doesn't\neven want to try or make you a meal\nand i'm like no because i really don't\nwant to learn about this that he does\nand he manages and i think it's so\nimportant because you can get so wrapped\nup in\nwhat other people do for each other in\nrelationships\nand what other people are carrying for\neach other in relationships and you see\nthis one aspect of it you're like oh\nwell why doesn't he carry that for me\nand why doesn't she carry that for me or\ndo that for me and\nand i think it's so important because it\ncan really\nyes stop you from giving as much as you\nshould be or want to be giving in a\nrelationship because\nyou're putting up your own barriers and\ntelling yourself that you shouldn't\nbecause he's not giving enough\nexactly all right couple more questions\ngo on then\nuh this is a good one when are you most\nscared\nto be vulnerable with your partner\nwhen are you most scared to be\nvulnerable\nlike when are you scared of like being\nreally honest and open i'm thinking\nsometimes when um you know like if i'm\nsupposed\nit's like you've already given me advice\non something and then like i'm kind of\nasking for\nlike again and i'm like really confused\nabout something again and you're really\nnice about it but\nsometimes i feel like it's you know when\ni know you're going to tell me something\nthat i don't necessarily want to hear\nbecause you've already told me before\nand i don't necessarily want you to give\nme the answer because i know you're\nright\nand that makes me really annoyed so\nsometimes i don't feel like being\nvulnerable about how i'm feeling because\ni know the answer you're gonna give and\nthat i don't want to hear it\n[Laughter]\ni so what do i need to be to help you be\nmore vulnerable\nno i think it's more me no seriously\nno no i think it is this is very much so\njust me\ni think it's me just wanting to be\nstubborn and not wanting you to be right\nthat's like a recurring theme in this\npodcast right now\ni'm not stopping i'm not allowed to say\nit that's the thing\nthat's the rule i've learned let's say\ni'm not allowed to say rodney's reflect\nthat's what i feel most vulnerable\nit's like i'm not allowed to repeat\nsomething she said\nthat makes me look good i'm like yeah i\nshould really tidy up after myself\nforever he's like yeah yeah we should\nhave\nyou know tell me you're not allowed to\ntell me that i should tidy up but i'll\ntell myself if i'm gonna tidy up after\nmyself okay\ni i feel most i'm trying to think i i\nthink the time i feel most vulnerable is\nlike when i spent a lot of money on\nsomething\ni feel like that's it but i'm trying to\nthink of it like\noh yeah like when you tell me not to oh\nyeah make sure you just park properly\nand don't ruin the rims i'm like if i\nwant to win the rooms i'll ruin the\nrooms okay\nno that no but i don't feel vulnerable i\nsay that to you i'm trying to think of\nsome when am i scared of being\nvulnerable with you\nwhen am i scared of being vulnerable\nwith you wait i don't send them anything\nno like if i've just bought like a\nreally expensive suit oh you don't want\nto tell yeah yeah yeah\nexactly yeah if i've just bought an\nexpensive suit for like an award\nceremony because he knows he's got a\ngoody wife\nyeah so i get scared of being like yeah\nthis has a suitcase because i'm wearing\nit and what do i always have like that's\nokay it's for your work\nyeah every time yeah you know you're\nalways nice to me in my mind i always\ni'm like it's for your work it's fine\nno you're nice about it i think i think\nit's a silly thing just because of\nupbringing and stuff it's not you it's\nnot you at all\nyou you never stop me um and then\ni'm trying to think what i'm trying to\nthink of something more i'm trying to\nthink because that was a fun one\nwith your health like sometimes with\nhealth stuff yeah you know why because\nsometimes like\nbecause i'm cooking for him i take\nthings quite personally and so sometimes\nyou try so hard no i know i know as in\nthat's not\nbut i feel like sometimes from you i\nfeel you get a little bit worried about\nsaying if something has\nupset your stomach or if something\nhasn't made you feel right\num whenever you have been any ups and\ndowns with your health\num or when i've given you something and\ni've suggested something and it hasn't\nworked and i'm like but why isn't it\nwork like i just don't understand and i\nthink it makes you vulnerable and i get\nquite defensive\nno no no i don't think so but you're\ntrying to like i i don't think you get\ndefensive i think you try really hard\nand so it's hard for you because you're\ntrying to figure out so many ways to\nsupport me or help me\nyeah yeah and you don't want to you\ndon't want it to go wrong and this is\nwhat it always comes back down to it's\nlike\nwhen you trust the person loves you you\nknow that someone even being defensive\nis out of love yeah\ni am defensive though about it to be\nhonest no but i i don't\ni think that comes from the fact that\nyou're trying so hard yeah\nyeah maybe because i'm just like oh wow\nand it's hard when you're not in control\nof something and you're trying to be in\ncontrol of it\num but yeah i feel like that's when i\nnotice you're you are a little bit\nscared to be vulnerable because\nyou want to tell me but you also don't\nwant to upset me or\nor like that's a good answer yeah yeah\nthat's a good answer i don't\nyeah i never want you to feel like\nyou're trying really hard and it's not\nworking on something because i don't\nthink that's fair because it's not\nnecessarily your responsibility\nor like when you want to play\nplaystation and you pretend like it's\nlike a work meeting with your partner\nand never say that away i really just\nwant to play playstation together but\nyou're like it's for work and i'm like\nyeah it's just because you want to play\nokay another one you're giving way too\nmany\nwell as well okay so we're on to the\nfinal two segments which is fill in the\nblank and final five\nfill in the blank and finally yeah so\nfill in the blank is you fill in the\nblank at the end of the sentence we're\nboth gonna say it all right\nyeah okay are you ready i'm ready i feel\nmost supported by my partner when i feel\nlike we did this\nlast time yeah but not the same question\ni feel most supported by my partner when\nhe brings me snacks when i don't even\nask for them that never happens\nno that's why i just don't feel it right\nnow\nno i feel most that's my answer you go i\nfeel most supported by my partner when\ni bring you cut up fruit no i mean\nthat's a fun one yeah\nbut he likes his fruit cut up when he's\neating it\nlike a little baby because his mum used\nto do it for him when he was younger\nand when he goes back every single time\nhis mom cuts his fruit up into a little\nbowl\nand he has a little assortment of fruit\nbowl every day and he's like you know i\nreally love it when my fruits cut up so\num that's what i've been doing cutting\nup fruit midday\nhalfway through my work day i haven't\nhad it today tomorrow sitting there\ncutting up fruit\nfor this king over here\ncut up fruit makes him make some support\nfeels the boy\nmy honest answer was gonna be when my\npartner's present\nwith me like when i feel like you're\nreally fully present\nokay\ncommitment means commitment means\ncommitment means\ncommitment means\nlike showing up in different ways for\none another when the time is right\nknowing knowing when is your time to\nshow up and knowing when it's their time\nshow up\nyeah i think commitment means\nmutual love boundaries\nagreements connection like when it's\nmutually created\nlike you create a plan together you\ncreate boundaries together you create\nexpectations together\nthat's what commitment means and then\nyou honor those totally\nconflict can bring conflict\ncan bring well let's just say i box\nso conflict can bring god\ni'm joking i don't do that to him um\nconflict\ncan bring deeper love\ni was going to say something like that\nno you weren't i was no you weren't you\nchose boxing\ncomplicated boxing conflict can bring\num really good like makeup meals\nlike whenever we wake up we went oh\nlet's go get some like cocoa butter\ncreamery ice cream\nis that really what happened that's why\nwe haven't had it for so long because we\nhaven't had to make up we haven't really\nhad many fights lately\nlet's pick one now\nfinal five so these are one word or one\nsentence\nyeah stop giving such long answers okay\nwhat's one thing you recently discovered\nabout yourself that surprised you\nthat i can commit to things and just\nmaintain it\ni always knew this but i guess i forgot\nit i love\nexercising with sport i just need to\nplay more sport i need to stop forcing\nmyself so that\nlovely okay what about our relationship\nmakes you feel powerful\nthey're both on the same page like a lot\nof the time\ni'm like oh i like this and you're like\noh me too i'm like oh okay\nlike even if small or big things like we\nare very much so\non the same page and even if we're not\nwe're both kind of okay with\ncoming to an agreement that we both like\nthat's mine\ncool my answer is you you you always\ntrust me when the chips are down\nwhat was the question again like what\nmake what in our relationship makes you\nfeel powerful yeah i got you so for me i\ni what makes me feel powerful is when\nwe're all in you trust me even when\nthings are not working out\nyeah externally that makes me feel\nreally confident and stuff\ni'm glad okay just don't use my chips\nchoose your own\nwhat do you think our relationship will\nbe like by our 50th anniversary\noh lord i didn't choose these what do i\nthink i think the better question is how\nwill we celebrate\nour 50th wedding anyway um my mind was\nthat with my family\nwith our family we'd have a really nice\n50th celebration with the whole family\nall together\non holiday somewhere sounds great just\nlaying here that's my answer sounds\ngreat\nkids would be like just us two on a\nbeach\nwith a tennis court\nand cut throat\nall right two last questions what about\nyour partner have you grown to love that\nyou initially disliked\ni can't think of anything good you go\nfast no i can't think of many things i\njust like i'm just trying to think of\nwhat i\nwhat i now like about you i think it was\nyour like i think\ni've just realized that i think it was\nwhat i said earlier like your lack of\norganization or whatever like i\ninitially that really\nirked me and then now i'm just like but\nthat's what lets you be\nspontaneous like that's what lets your\never freshness come out\nand if you became all of that thing then\nyou can't you know\nnot saying that you can't be organized\nlike you are organized now and you have\nbecome but i mean\nif you became uh an organizational rigid\nbeast and you lose that\nyeah you lose part of that um i think\nmine for you is probably\njust like your general way of thinking\nwas not something that i was used to\nthat's true that's a good one that's a\nreally good one whether it was the\nquality versus quantity amount of time\nbecause i was not used to that whether\nit was\num yeah your general way of thinking\nwhere i used to be like\noh well maybe i don't want to do that\nbut then i realized actually is a really\ngood way of thinking and\num even though it used to like scare me\nto things like that because i felt like\ni was getting rid of a lot of my old\nlike habits and ways of thinking now\ni've actually become quite fond of it\nokay next i love that okay fifth and\nfinal question of the whole interview\nwhat's the funniest thing that's\nhappened to both of you\nthe funniest thing that's ever happened\nto both of us um\ni was going to say i was going to say\nthat go on\nwhere were you a few weeks or months ago\nsomeone put us up on this instagram page\ncalled sibling revelry and what this\npage does\nis that it puts up pictures of siblings\nor couples\nand asks people to vote whether they're\nsiblings or\nor couples and so they posted a picture\nof us and i think 60\nsaid siblings and 40 said couple\nprobably 40\nwho know who we are and it's really\nfunny because all the awkward pictures\non that page\nour siblings are seriously yeah yeah\nyeah so it's yeah that's probably one of\nthe funniest things that says that is\nreally funny that was a good good laugh\nthat was good laugh\num i can think of another one too go on\ni remember when we were traveling to\nsomeone's birthday or something when we\nfirst started dating and we got lost in\nthe middle that's what i was going to\nsay\nno way literally when i went back to go\non no i was thinking of when we were um\noh yeah that's what it was we were going\nsomewhere it was a countryside\nand then somehow we remember we drove\ninto like a barn or like field\narea and i was so scared and that was\nthe first time that i was in a very\nscary situation with you\nand it was the the time i realized like\nhow you will\nalways be and always have been sins that\nlike\ncalm my dad has always been this person\nfor me so it was so cool because you\nliterally took on that role of like\nyou were so calm you're so clean even\neven when you're scared\nwhen i was young even if my dad was so\nscared he would never ever\nshow he was scared and he'd always have\nme like i would never feel scared\nbecause he was never scared\nand you literally had i got a glimpse of\nthat with you and i was like oh my gosh\ni was so scared i was so scared you did\nso good that day\nthat was funny and funny now not funny\nthen
