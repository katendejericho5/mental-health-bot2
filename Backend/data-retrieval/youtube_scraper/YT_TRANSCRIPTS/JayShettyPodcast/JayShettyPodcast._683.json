that gave me that\nperspective of hey\nyou can keep climbing this mountain\nthere is no peak totally so just have\nfun you know there's no pot of gold\nat the end of the rainbow the rainbow is\nthe reward so have as much fun as you\ncan\nyes stop taking things so seriously our\ntime is limited here so enjoy it while\nwe're here\nhey everyone thank you so much for\njoining us again\ntoday's guest

too\nand he's also a really really dear\nfriend someone who i've had so many\nincredible conversations with we have\nwhat we call roof talk we literally sit\non a roof\nfor a couple of hours and catch up about\nlife\nphilosophy experiences they've been\ntruly meaningful to me and i wanted to\nshare that meaning with each and every\none of you\nand he's also launching a new book and\nthe book's called unlearn\n101 simple truths for a better life so\nif you enjoyed today's conversation you\ncan grab\na copy of the book as well so humble\nthank you for being here man thank you\nfor having me man\nexcited to be here humble the poet it is\ngreat to have you here because\nwe've had a couple of conversations yeah\nwe're always talking online messaging\nand i've always found them so insightful\ni always learn something every time we\nspeak\ni feel like i need a notebook just\nhanging out with you you just have to\nhave a notebook taking all these notes\nso get your notebooks out guys because i\nfeel the same way about humble i think\nhe's someone who really really unpacks\nand thinks about life and i love people\nlike that because i truly believe that\nit's so easy in a world we live in where\neveryone sees quotes everywhere on\ninstagram\nyou see motivational sayings absolutely\neverywhere everyone captions their\npicture\nyeah with the latest inspirational quote\nthat if you don't think it through\nyou can think you're deep without being\ndeep oh completely it's like this whole\nfull woke idea\nand it's all woke i like it and it's\nlike because a lot of the stuff is you\nread an inspiring quote and it feels\ngood\nin the short firm and you don't take a\ndeep dive to be like well is this a\nsustainable idea that's going to make me\nfeel better\npast this five minutes like a little\ndopamine drop so yeah\ndefinitely i think for me my whole\njourney came from\nme looking and searching for meaning\nsome level of fulfillment and not\naccepting the fluff\ni usually call it the tumblr quotes and\ni think now it's just become that full\nwoke\nstuff that you see all over social media\nwhere it's just like\nyou know things that you you hear that\nagain it'll make you feel great for\nabout five minutes and then when you\nreally kind of unpack it and try to live\nit you're like this is not pragmatic at\nall\ninteresting yeah whenever humble\ncomments on one of my quotes on\ninstagram like yeah this is a good one\nlike that's how i feel well you're still\nso good i want to make sure i don't like\njust send you a fire emoji i want to\nmake sure that there's some value to\nwhat i got to say\nyour hands up fire emoji yeah no yeah or\nlike the hundred\nyeah 100 100 oh my favorite yeah my\nfavorite is\nso true so true or so deep yeah those\nare my favorite comments\nbut no i i i do believe that you\ngenerally live that\nand obviously used to be an elementary\nschool teacher elements teach the third\ngrade\nin toronto in a neighborhood called\nrexdale and it was\nheavy immigrant area you know a lot of\nkids\nwhose parents were overly educated you\nknow back home they were doctors lawyers\nengineers\nand they came to canada and then their\neducation wasn't converted so now\nthey're\nworking in donut stores and\ngas stations and factories and they had\na really strong\npriority for education but they may not\nhave had the means and such a really\ninteresting dynamic and just trying my\nbest to communicate with these kids\nbecause i really kind of felt like they\nwere me\nyou know my father had a master's degree\nin economics came to canada had no\nopportunity to to use the education so\ninstead\nhe became a cab driver drove cab until\nhe retired in uh 2015\nand he always stressed education because\nhe never got the opportunity to kind of\nrealize his own\nyeah what did you learn about how humans\nlearn by being a teacher\ni think the the first thing that i\nlearned and um\ni even mentioned it in the introduction\nfor the for the book is the fact that\nwe all are almost completely empty\nvessels when we start and i tell the\nstory about telling a child to\nyou know put on your boots and put on\nyour snow pants and\nthe kid will put on his boots and then\nstruggle to get the pants on because\nthey will take what you say literally\nand say it the way you did\nand it really made me become very uh\nself-aware of how many\nuh gaps i fill in every day with my own\nbiases and my own contacts when somebody\nspeaks to me\nand these children are empty vessels so\nwhen you start to see them\nand you communicate to them there's so\nmuch opportunity to\nkind of mold and shape them to to think\na certain way and that can go\neither way that can be a great thing or\nthat can be a negative thing and i was\nreally trying to instead of\nteaching them a specific thing really\ntry to get them to fall in love with the\nidea of learning\nthe idea of exploring and kind of taking\nthings to where they needed to take it\nfor their own natural journey now this\nbook unlearn\nyeah i love the title because it's so\nfunny around the time we met\ni was giving a lot of talks and i kept\nusing the word unlearn as well and i and\ni got fascinated with that word because\neveryone's talking about like in this\nage you've got to be a continuous\nlearner\nand you've got to consistently learn and\nto stay up to trends and all that kind\nof stuff it's all about learning\nlearning learning\nand here you are going counter-intuitive\nand saying no no no guys i've got 101\nsimple truths to unlearn\nyeah tell tell me about that i think\nwhat happened was again i was an\nelementary school teacher which is a\nvery safe\ngovernment job all my colleagues are on\nmy team\nthere's no competition you know and it\nwas and i came from being in the school\nsystem to working in the school system\nand you know i had a creative itch and\nwhen i got into the entertainment\nindustry\nyou know i just got torn apart you know\ni got ripped to shreds the first people\nto\nuh recognize my talents were there to\nexploit me\nyou know i lost a lot of money i got uh\nripped off a few times betrayed by\npeople i cared about\nand what i realized was i didn't have to\nlearn new things to navigate in this\nworld i had to let go\nof a lot of ideas and biases and\nidealisms that i carried\nthat you know i could afford to carry in\nmy previous life\nthat were now weighing me down kind of\nin this so you know\nliving in the structure i kind of look\nat it as leaving the zoo and going into\nthe jungle\nyou know and now you're definitely a lot\nmore free\nbut you know no one's bringing you your\nfood no one's there to keep you safe\nand i realized like i had a lot of\nbiases\nand i had a lot of expectations for how\ni thought the world was going to treat\nme and i had a lot of entitlements and i\nhad to kind of shed those\nand kind of the idea of you know letting\ngo to gain more\ntell me about one of those powerful\nbiases that you had and\ntell me about a moment when you saw it\nnot serving you\nand then when you had to switch it when\nyou unlearned it um i think definitely\nignoring words and paying attention to\nactions you know and i think what i was\ndoing\nwas the opposite i really wanted to\nbelieve something\nso i would ignore actions i would i\nwould ignore patterns and i would really\ncling on to words i was like well what\nthey said\nthey said they would do this for me or\nthey said they meant it they said i\nmattered\neven though their actions completely\ncontradicted that and\nyou know when things blew up in my face\nand you sit there you know they always\nsay hindsight is 20 20.\num that's that was the moment i wanted\nto take ownership and i was like okay\nwait\ni should have seen this coming because\nnow playing it back\nhere are all the pieces that this person\nrevealed to me through their actions\nso i think at that point i said you know\naction scream where's whisper\nso now you know i'm always paying\nattention now for patterns\nin behavior even for myself so i might\nsay you know a lot of things but if my\nactions contradict that my actions are\nwhat matters and\nyou know that that's a very important\nidea whether it comes to our\nrelationships with other people\nbut also for ourselves you know instead\nof us telling people what's important to\nus\nwe could just simply show them our\nschedule because our schedule will show\nour priorities\non a subconscious level and that's the\ndeeper stuff that actually\nreally represents who we are that's such\na practical thing everyone can start\ndoing today and i think that that goes\nback to\ni needed the practical stuff i didn't\nneed the motivational stuff i didn't\nneed the fluffy stuff i needed the stuff\nto make me feel better\nnow i also needed the stuff to help me\nturn my life around\nnow because i was in i was in a very\ndifficult situation\ni had left my my job as a teacher to\nbecome an artist\nand i wasn't in the best financial\nsituation as a teacher\nbecause i was a young kid making money\nand not knowing how to spend it\nand when i became an artist i had no\nidea\nhow my creativity was going to pay any\nof the bills and\ni needed to figure i needed to get my\nmind in the right place\nto kind of figure this out and that\nreally meant\nyou know shedding my entitlements\nshedding many of my expectations\nuh not being so idealistic\nand really trying to find the source of\nwhere did all this stuff come from why\ndo i believe these things\nand is it okay to let go of these\nbeliefs without losing who i am and i\nthink\nthat was kind of the premise of this\njourney of unlearning and i realized\nthat\nyou know to be a lifelong learner so\nalso be a lifelong unlearner\nabsolutely absolutely there was i can't\nremember who said it now you might even\nknow\nthat they said the illiterate of the\n21st century modern literacy i think\nwith bertrand russell was it\nlearning on learning and relearning it\nwas yeah that was i think it's broad\ntraining yeah the illiterate will be the\nones who can't\nlearn unlearn and release yeah for the\n21st century\nyeah absolutely yeah and i love that\nstatement i think it's so powerful\nbecause\nit's so strange how and i'd love to hear\nyour thoughts on this\nwhy does it feel harder to let go\nthan it does to add i feel like\nwe as human beings will\nalways gravitate towards the familiar\nfamiliarity\nis more important to us subconsciously\nthan happiness\nor anything else where does that come\nfrom from your opinion about your\nperspective i think it's a survival\ntactic i think\ngoing back from when we were you know\nnomad nomadic\num i think uh we our brains were\ndesigned to really notice things that\nstuck out\nso we would really be in a familiar safe\nsituation and then you know\nif you walk into somebody's home you can\nsmell things that they can't smell\nbecause their brain's been trained to\nshut off that smell because they need to\nnotice\nthings that are out of place i feel like\nthat's the reason we always know\nnotice what's going wrong and not not\nwhat's going right because we're trained\nto figure out what's out of place\nand i feel like it's the same thing with\nwhen it comes to familiarity it's\nwe you know if we grew up in a household\nand we saw a certain dynamic between our\nparents\nyou know that's our first experience of\nan observation of love\nwe're going to naturally subconsciously\nkind of lean towards that\nin our own relationships if we don't\nhave that self-awareness to kind of\nwant to break that cycle even if it's an\nunhealthy situation\nso i think the familiarity of it is what\nkind of trumps everything and i know\neven on a positive note i\nfor me to improve my quality of life i\nreally\nlean back to nostalgia i really try to\nyou know i wake up in the morning and go\nfor a walk and i enjoy the walk\nnot just because it's exercise but it\nreminds me of being in the fourth grade\nwalking to the bus stop and like a\nlittle bit of the chilly air in toronto\nand\nyou know that when the sun's out at that\nangle just the feeling and the vibes and\ni think a lot of us always we feel\nhappiest when we feel like we're\nchildren again\nyeah that that i totally agree with yeah\ni've been playing a lot more\nrecently you've been playing along\ntrying to engage play into my life yeah\nthat the feeling of play\ncompletely and so whether that's playing\na sport which without the pressure of\ncompetition or winning yeah still\nplaying a sport without the feeling like\noh yeah we've got to win obviously i'm\nstill playing to win but not with that\npressure\ncompletely or or even if it's playing\nmore video games again or whatever it is\nlike just\nfeeling like a child again without doing\nthings with\nrigid structure force completely i don't\nthink we\nwe should never lose that i think we\nshould never lose that childhood\ncuriosity and the excitement and i think\nwhat ends up happening is\nwhen we don't actively seek it then i\nthink subconsciously we just stick to\nthe familiar\nand that's where the danger is because\nwe start to\nmistake our beliefs and our values for\nourselves\nand now we're like well if i abandon\nthat belief i don't know who i am\nanymore\nand i think that's where we get in a lot\nof trouble because now we're some of\nthose beliefs and values are stale\nand outdated or they're not practical\nfor the new lives that we live\nand i think you know if you were in a\ndifficult childhood and you had to\nput on a brave face or you had to have a\ncertain level of emotion to deal with\nthat\nand now you're an adult and you're in a\nsafer environment you don't need to\ncarry those same strategies over now\nwhat helped you then could be hurting\nyou now and we need to be constantly\nreevaluating ourselves being aware of it\nand trying to figure that out and\ni mean i'm picking it up on every way\nshape or form\nfrom the way my mother used to punk me\noff for not clearing out the lint in the\nin the dryer and realizing that i say\nthat to other people to\nyou know picking out my flaws you know\nbased off what people told me when i was\na kid to uh\nyou know i think recently when i was\nwhen i was in high school i didn't feel\nlike i was uh\nyou know good looking enough to get\ngirls or what have you and then when i\nbecame a public figure i started leaning\ntowards modeling\nand it wasn't because i cared about\nmodeling it was because i wanted the\nvalidation like oh look at me now i\nwasn't cool enough in high school\nand then you realize you're like hey i'm\ntrying to i'm speaking to an invisible\naudience\na bunch of people who don't exist you\nknow\nand whoever has said those mean things\nto me when they were 15\nthey probably grew up and they're\nprobably nice people now too\nand i actually had an experience with\nthat i was when i was about 10 years old\nthere was there was this boy who would\nalways\nhe was younger than me and he would\nalways just try to start trouble with me\nand say a lot of racist things to me and\nit really i was always on edge around\nhim and then\nyou know i thought he moved away and\nthen i ran into him at a party\nin university and i don't know if he\nrecognized him or not but he was the\nkindest\nsweetest most accommodating person at\nthe party he was like hey\nwelcome can i get you something to drink\nwhat's going on and you realize you're\nlike\nit what he wasn't he was a 10 year old\nkid being a jerk\nbecause we all do and now he's an adult\nand he grew out of it as well\nand really being able to let go of that\nand realizing how often\nthat situation created tension for me\nmoving forward\nyou know specifically he was a ginger so\ni remember\nlike not being aware that any time i was\naround\nother gingers there would be a little\nlittle bit of tension\nand i think that's what my journey has\nbeen now is being like okay well why do\ni feel the way i feel now\nand what do i think the root of it is\nand it's exploration it's just kind of\nlooking inside this universe\nwithin us to try to better understand\nourselves and when we do that\nwe can better understand the world\naround us i love that man we're speaking\nto an invisible\naudience it really isn't about that it's\nso powerful that is so powerful man i\nlove that\nbecause what you're saying is we're\nbasically creating a reality\nbased on something that's subjective\nand almost unreal to a certain degree\nvery unreal\ni think you know i had another friend um\nshe went to some psychotherapy for her\nfor an experience she had and what they\nrealized the root\nof the issue that she went through was\nwhen she was like\nseven years old her mother left her at\nher aunt's house to go run an errand\nand she felt abandoned because a\nseven-year-old mind to process that\nit felt like abandonment and she as an\nadult\nthe exercise required her to go and\nspeak to her seven-year-old self and as\nan adult she was like listen\nmom left us not because she doesn't love\nus she left us because she trusts us\nthat we could be by ourselves with her\non it was\nit was a sign that that you're that she\ntrusted you and that you could be\nresponsible\nbecause with from the adult lens we can\nsee it from different contexts\nand she's like immediately i felt my\nshoulders drop immediately i felt\nlighter moving forward\nand we don't realize how much of the\nstuff we carry throughout our lives\nuntil you know we face it yes and then\nthe moment we face it it usually hits us\non a physical level where you're like oh\ni addressed it and my shoulders drop i\nfeel lighter\nthat weight on my chest isn't there as\nmuch and i think i've\nbecome put myself on a journey to find\nout how much of that i can do and\nas i learned it from myself and i began\nsharing it\non social media the top comment kept\nbeing\nyou're telling my story how are you\nliving in my head and it made me realize\nthat we're\nall in the same boat we're all dealing\nwith the exact same things\nand me as a writer and somebody who can\nput words together\ni think it's it's it's my my job now but\nit's my pleasure to help people figure\nout their thoughts feelings and emotions\nand simplifying it i taught grade 3 for\na long time i know how to take ideas and\nsimplify them and make it digestible\nyeah absolutely man no you do it so well\nwhen i was reading through the book\nyesterday\ni was just like everything's so well\narticulated yeah and i loved what you\ntalked about even if you repeat yourself\ntwice\nyou're still presenting it through a\ndifferent angle completely and and you\nknow like you said if\nif anything's uh worth saying it's worth\nrepeating and i love that because\nbut even when you're repeating it\nbecause you are a writer and a wordsmith\nit doesn't sound the same you're\nunpacking it a layer deeper\nyeah and that's what i love about what\nyou're talking about right now that this\nunconscious bias that we all experience\nmind big one\nlast year was all around wealth and\nmoney\nso i grew up in a household where we\nalways believed we had enough\nlike that was our language so i never\nhad a lot of money growing up but i\nwasn't broke\nyeah and so we always grew up with the\nlanguage we always have enough\nlike enough to get by enough to survive\nenough for christmas\nenough for this and so i had always\ngrown up with that mentality i'm always\ngoing to have enough\nyeah and it was just so interesting to\nme how i'd programmed myself\nunconsciously to see money as negative\nto see money as as an aspiration as\nnegative\nand not realizing that actually yes it\ndidn't have to be my aspiration but it\ncould be a tool or a resource\nor it could be a powerful element that\ncould be used for a higher purpose too\ncompletely and the feeling around enough\nlike that word enough was just so\nlimiting and so the ability\nthey're so abstract so abstract like\nenough\nwhat is enough enough in london might\nend up being a very different definition\nthan enough in new york\nthen enough in hollywood you know one\nday you know you're hanging out with\nyour with your buddies and\nuh you know you have more than enough to\ngo out to dinner at the local pub\nbut then you come out here and you start\ngoing to some of these bougie spots and\nall of a sudden enough\nisn't enough anymore yeah and you start\nto realize how much of this\nis we create the definition and we have\nso much power to\nredefine these things depending on who\nwe hang out with what values we chose\nto hold dear to us and also how we view\nourselves\nbecause sometimes if we don't feel like\nwe're enough then now we're trying to\nconsume all this external stuff to try\nto compensate for that but\nit never works so what's a good\npractical step for someone to take to\nfirst of all\nidentify their biases\ntheir their unconscious biases or the\nbiases that you make how do you first\nidentify them\ni think the first thing is there's got\nto be ownership um i think in every\nsingle situation no matter\nwhat it is there's always what somebody\nelse may have done to us what the\nuniverse or what\nour environment what external factors\nuh how they impacted us but there's also\na level of responsibility that we can\ntake\nwhat decisions we made what expectations\nwe\nhad going in um what what values and\nwhat things that we found are important\ni think when we start taking ownership\nfor those things\nthen we realize that's where our power\nis you know\nuh if i have if i have a lunch date with\nyou tomorrow\nand you just don't show up and you don't\ncall you don't do anything i can start\nto\nstart putting a lot of blame on you i'm\nlike well jay stood me up\nyou know jay's not a reliable person i\ncan say all these things but that is\njust putting all the power\nin your hands you know when whoever we\ngive the responsibility to we give the\npower\nor i can be like hey what are my\nresponsibilities in this\nwhat could i have done differently and\nwhen we take ownership\ni think we empower ourselves to make our\nsituation better\nand then it's no longer win or lose this\nbecomes win or learn\nand i think when we start looking\ninternally at every situation\nand i have a friend recently he went\nthrough a very\nchallenging breakup and i can i can see\nnow that he's kind of dug himself\nsome light to the end of his tunnel and\nhe's it because what he's saying is\nyou know i don't talk about what she did\nto me anymore i talk about what she did\nfor me and i'm realizing he's taking a\nlot more ownership he's doing a lot more\nself actualizing and i think\nthat's always the first step i think um\ni'm really big on no complaining\ni don't see a lot of value in it um\ntotally i don't see a lot of value\ninventing\nto other people repeatedly i think you\nknow obviously get some stuff off your\nchest\nas an artist i'll take my stuff off my\nchest through my art\nbut um i think we all need to feel\nconnected\nwe all need to to bond to something and\nand self-pity\nis a very easy food way of doing\nso and i encourage people to kind of\ntake that out\nout of their diet and start taking a\nlittle bit more responsibility because\nwhen you take the responsibility it's\nnot simply about blaming yourself\nit's about when you start taking\nresponsibility you have\npower now to start changing things and\nyou can't\nobviously rewrite the past but now you\nare better equipped to\nto start to write your future self-pity\nis like\nfast food you need to take it out yeah\nit feels good in the short run it really\nfeels good in the short run\ni love that and i don't want to hold it\nagainst anybody thank you for feeling it\nand\nand it took me a while to kind of pick\nup on it it's it's convenient\nit's quick and it's cheap just like fast\nfood\nand if you do too much of it it's going\nto bite you in the ass just like fast\nfood\nyou know so just be mindful of it and i\nthink just\nwith a lot of the people i'm speaking to\nand and hearing that is always the one\nthing i try to encourage\nand people don't like to be told oh i\ncan't feel sorry for myself\nin this situation and there is a very in\nmy opinion a very defined line between\nself-pity and self-compassion\nwhat is that yeah i was going to ask\nthat that was my next question i think\nself-compassion is kind of\nrecognizing if you've been hurt that you\nrequire time for that injury to heal\num you know let's say you break your leg\nyou have to understand that it might\ntake you six weeks of\nnot putting any pressure on it to to\nheal\nthat's self-compassion that's\nself-compassion knowing what's necessary\nknowing the patient was necessary\nfor you to get better i think self-pity\nis kind of picking at\nyour cast and and and picking at the\nscabs and really wanting to\ndefine yourself through your injury and\nwanting\nother people to feel sorry for you\nbecause you start to feel connected it\nmakes you feel less alone\num you also feel more connected with\nyourself when you're like well nobody\nunderstands me but me nobody else gets\nit\nand i think when you start to realize\nthat hey i get it it's your first\nheartbreak\nbut you know there are a million\nheartbreak songs\nclearly you're not the only person who's\ngone through this and\nthat doesn't mean your heartbreak is any\nless intense it just means this is a\ncommon thing and you can actually learn\nfrom others who went through this as\nwell\nand if we address this as as a community\nit'll be a lot easier versus isolating\nyourself from other people\nand and kind of going through a negative\ndownward spiral\nyeah absolutely man no i love that\nthat's super powerful yeah i read an\narticle the other day that said\nit takes a village to deal with mental\nhealth yeah\nright and it was just that whole\nprinciple about community and the\nprinciple of that you've just raised now\ni think\nyour relationships matter i think your\nrelationship with yourself\ndefinitely is the most important and it\nsets the tone for the type of\nrelationship we can have with other\npeople\num but we definitely can improve the\nrelationship with ourselves through\nour relationship with other people i had\na friend recently just bring that up as\nwell\num you know they work with a lot of\npeople and they said\nthey had the self-awareness to be like\nit's easier to stand up\nfor other people than it is to stand up\nfor myself i\navoid conflict um i don't want to you\nknow i don't want to shake things up\nbut if i see someone being disrespectful\nto somebody i care about yeah i no\nlonger care\nyeah i can i can i can get in there i\ncan be assertive i can be aggressive\nbut i can't do it for myself and um i\nthink that's something worth exploring\ntoo sometimes we don't think we're\nworthy\nof being stood up for or we're worthy of\nlove uh but everybody else is\nand um the truth is we are worthy of it\nas well you know we're all a work in\nprogress we all have flaws and\nobviously we're gonna like other people\nmore than we like ourselves because we\nknow ourselves more\nyeah you know obviously we see them in\nsmaller doses\nbut we're all worthy of it and how you\ntreat yourself will set the tone for how\nother people will treat\nyou um absolutely man you're like\ndropping\ndropping i'm just dropping the books\nright here you guys can't see it's off\ncamera i'm just re-reading this\nreading about the book guys it's just\nit's just reading about the book don't\nwatch the video\nno it's it no it's amazing man i love it\ni love it because it's\nyou're not just you're not just quoting\nstuff it's when you're sharing it's real\nso\nokay first step is ownership and i love\nthat ownership i think that's a great\nfirst step\nsecond step now that i've identified it\ni've taken ownership what do i do now\ni think recognizing that you are you\nknow you are not\nyour identity is not your absolute\nchoices so if you made\na decision that you're no longer proud\nof that's okay and i think you know we\nlearn from that i think\nin the book i talk a lot about belief i\nthink a lot of people identify\nthemselves through their beliefs\nespecially you know in today's age with\nthe tribalism you know everybody's\ntaking sides whether\nyou consider yourself left wing right\nwing what have you and when somebody\nchallenges your side right now it\nactually encourages people to dig even\ndeeper onto the side so now\nthe gap is is expanding and the distance\nbetween people is getting farther so i\nthink what has to happen is we have to\nlet go of the idea that we are not\nsimply our beliefs and\nwe have to question where did the\nbeliefs come from and i think for me the\nmoment that i really saw this was when i\nwas a teacher\num i i taught in a community where we\nhad a\nvery large muslim population uh and we\nhad we had kids from\nafghanistan pakistan india um\niran a lot of a lot of the other small\nmiddle eastern countries\nand so during ramadan the ongoing joke\nis everyone had to celebrate ramadan\nbecause so many kids would would stay\nhome that day\nit wouldn't be fair to teach you know if\ni had a class of 28 kids\nabout maybe 11 would show up wow because\nthose are non-muslims so we it'd be the\nongoing joke that hey\neverybody gets to celebrate ramadan\nwhoever shows up that day we show movies\nand uh\nyou know um well for eid for that but\nduring the fasting i\ni witnessed you know one girl uh\nkind of uh making another girl feel bad\nfor having a snack\nyou know and you can kind of hear it in\nthe girl's tone of voice\nshe's just regurgitating whatever her\nparents were telling her right\nand because they're too young to kind of\nbe this judgmental\nand i think as we grow older we don't\nrealize that this stuff was taught to us\nlike we didn't come out the box\nbelieving in these things and\nthat forced me to continually challenge\nmy beliefs and be like well where did i\nwhere did i pick up that belief whether\nyou know it\nis something on a spiritual level or\nwhether it's my relationship with\nconsumerism the idea that buying stuff's\ngoing to make me happy\nor whether it's the idea that we can\nlive happily ever after\nor whether it's the idea of soul mates\nor anything whatever we believe\nyeah i think the the number one question\nis where did it come from\nand good question yeah and it's that\nbelief and\nand not to you know if if my parents you\nknow indoctrinated me with a bunch of\nideas\nthat doesn't make them bad it doesn't\nmean i was brainwashed it was you know\nthey had whatever tools they had\nand they were taught by others and we're\npassing it down\nbut if we have that self-awareness we're\nlike okay well that belief\nyou know um so for me a good example was\nuh when i was a teenager i believed\nhomosexuality\nwas a sin i believed it was wrong um\nit took meeting a person who was\nhomosexual and\nhearing their story and realizing that\nthey're a human just like me looking for\nlove\nand then going back and be like well\nwhere did i learn that and it wasn't\nfrom somebody saying\nhomosexuality was wrong it was from the\nreligious belief that pursuing lust is\nevil\nand me taking that and reappropriating\nwhat have you\nand not holding against anybody who\ntaught me that and realized that hey\neverybody was taught what they taught\nbut now that i have the self-awareness\ni can let go of this this is no longer\nserving me\nthis is closing me off to a lot of\namazing beautiful people\num so i'm gonna let that go this is not\nmy identity and i think a lot of people\nthey take their the flag of their\nidentity and they shove it into\nsomething they're like that's me\nand now if you insult that idea you're\nalso insulting me\nyou know if you insult conservatism\nyou're insulting me if you're you know\nif you insult\nthe the l.a lakers you're insulting me\nyou know if you you know if you're if\nyou insult manchester united you know\nyou know people they get very they find\nvalue in that and i think for me\nit meant that i had to start looking\naround and explain\nwhere did i plant my flag what did i\nbelieve\nand um that's an ongoing process it's a\nlifelong thing you don't just pull your\nflag out and now you're free\nthere's layers to it once you you jump\none fence you know\nyou can run a couple meters you hit\nanother fence and it's really about\nthis continuous journey and cycle of\nkind of shedding these old ideas\nuh adding new ones and maybe having to\nshed those soon as well\ni love it man great advice really\npractical anyone who's listening or\nwatching make sure you're taking notes\nbecause\nyeah super practical tips i love it but\nwhen i listen to you and anytime i'm\nwith you\ni feel like you've really dug deep and\ndone the work\nlike genuinely like when i talk to you i\nfeel like you're like i don't know how\nlong you've been doing it but you've\nreally been like going inside\nand like breaking it down and figuring\nit out and reflecting i wonder\nwho was supporting that journey for you\nlike who was\nhelping you pave that way now that\nyou're helping others through your\nwriting through your books through your\nsocial media through your video\nwas there not just specific people but\nwhat was\nguiding that process for you or was it\nreally just self-reflection and\nintrospection\num i think a lot of it was was art\nso i mean i think you know remembering\nthe first time i heard outcast and you\nknow\nhearing andre 2000 say i came into this\nworld high as a bird\nsecond-hand cocaine powder i know it\nsounds absurd and being like whoa\nthis guy just said he you know this guy\njust explained that his mother was\ndoing cocaine when she was pregnant with\nhim and like i've never heard that level\nof honesty and in the hip hop song and\nuh hearing lauren hill you know sing\nsongs and you know she has that that\nunplugged album and\nand the song get out and you know she's\nlike if everything was gold and go\nthat's how i choose to live and just\nkind of thinking thinking that and being\nlike okay how does this\nwhat does this mean to me because\nsometimes you hear this stuff before\nyou're ready\nyeah and then 10 years later those\nlyrics just pop into your head and\nyou're like whoa\nthis is this mattered to me um i think i\nthink there was a combination of that\ni think there was also a combination of\nyou know my mother\num she injured herself she used to work\nat a factory we had moved to to a\nneighborhood in toronto that was around\nthe corner from a factory to kellogg's\nkellogg's cereal company\nshe worked for them so we had moved she\nhad moved there\nso she could walk to work in about five\nminutes and uh\nafter about a year she got hurt and she\ncould no longer work\nand i think she kind of fell into a a\nvery\nuh dark place because she felt like she\nwasn't\ncontributing to the family um i i feel\nlike you know my father\ndidn't have the tools to kind of help\nher go through it\nand she she found well she\nshe spent more time at the goddard you\nknow the the the institutions for sikhi\nand she really took a deep dive and and\nstarted bringing that into the household\nsick means student and so i think the\nthe one good thing was that she would\nshe'd send me to various camps and youth\ncamps and\nin the beginning they were very\nsuperficial but she started uh\nthe deeper she went she started taking\nme places where we started\nhaving deep discussions so i remember\nbeing like\n11 years old pre-pubescent girls still\nhad cooties\nbut we were talking about lust and the\ndownfalls of lust\nand me not even understanding it at that\npoint but everything was there and it\nwas going to make sense eventually\nso i think that the deep thinking was\nalways there and then\ni made a boatload of mistakes just a\nboatload of mistakes and i got to the\npoint where i\nliterally was taking muscle relaxers and\ndrinking nyquil every day\nand just lying in bed literally\nwaiting for someone to save the day and\njust being like okay i'm going to wake\nup\nand this stuff's going to figure itself\nout because what happens on tv\nsure no within 22 minutes something's\ngonna happen some you know\nx machinas type situation where\nsomeone's the calvary is going to come\nin\nand you know if you watch the pursuit of\nhappiness with will smith that's one of\nthe things that you know that was said\nto him that that that turned on that\nswitch was\nthe calvary is not coming nobody's\ncoming to save the day\nand for me that moment was listening to\nj cole dollar in a dream\nand hearing him say listen now you're\ngonna you know things weren't working\nout for me because are you gonna grow\nbitter and cold\nor are you going to flip this and and\nmake this your defining moment\nand i think that that was kind of the\nkick in the butt that i needed\nand i think that was the point where i\nwas i started rejecting\neverything that wasn't giving me uh\nreal world um\nvalue you know no longer was i gonna\nlisten to the fluffy stuff\ni was rejecting the ideas if someone\nsaid oh god's got a plan just trust it\ni was like that doesn't help me become a\nbetter person\ni started rejecting you know anything\nthat just kind of sounded\nnice and i was like you know so it\nbecame and for me\nyou know i was already kind of a little\nbit rough around the edges with my\ncommunication so it was like you know\ni started posting up the quotes i would\nstart posting up in my place at that\ntime was like sink or swim\nyou want a vacation go get a day job you\nknow\nyou miss the shots you don't take you\nknow and just very\nstraightforward you know no nonsense\nno sugar coating and it really helped me\na lot and then when i started sharing\nthat\non my facebook at the time immediately\npeople started gravitating towards it\nand that helped me\nrealize that i wasn't alone in what i\nwas going through\nand that we were all going through this\nand my\nsharing my journey as i was figuring it\nout was adding value to other people\nand it helped me create a community and\nconnect with people and\nthat's how we our our energies found\neach other\nand you realize that and i always just\ntell that to people in the world of\nmusic it's just good things happen when\nyou put your stuff up\ntotally man yeah yeah when you when\nyou're putting out the energy\nnaturally certain people get attracted\nand naturally certain people get\nrepelled yeah\nbecause you are who you are completely\nyou're putting it out there and that\nbroadcast\neither brings people closer or tells\npeople hey i don't want to hang out with\nthat person\nyeah and it's interesting because a lot\nof people say oh do you believe in fate\nand destiny and i was like well i\nbelieve in people\npaying attention and making action so if\nsomeone says hey i want to become a\nprofessional dancer\nand then somebody might say hey well the\nplace you got to go is la so then they\nmoved to la it wasn't destiny that\nbrought them there it was them taking a\nrisk\nand then paying attention and then\nsomebody said okay now you're in l.a go\nto north hollywood that's where the\ndancers are at\nand again making that move and the\nperson that continually pays attention\nand keeps making those actions and\ncontinually faces their own fears and\nand decides i'm going to leave my\ncomfort zone\ngreat things will happen for them now if\nyou meet them 10 years later and they're\na world renowned\nchoreographer you might consider them\nlucky yeah but they weren't\nyou know their baby steps added up and i\nand i kind of view it the same way just\ngot to start making the baby steps they\nadd up\nagain as a schoolteacher i realize that\nhey like there is a\n12 13 year plan to get a child to read\nyou know we don't just take a\nfour-year-old and throw harry potter in\ntheir hands\nit's first we show them the letters then\nwe start with the sound it's very slow\nyeah structured but it adds up and then\nyou know\nit creates you know the greatest\nliterary artist in the world\nthe the system and if we implemented\nthat to our self-improvement\nif we implemented that to our our\nphysical health our diet\nyou know the sky is the limit yeah\nabsolutely so if someone's feeling like\nyou were\nbeaten down trotting down you know lying\nin bed waiting for something to happen\nand they feel like they've been in that\nplace multiple times\ni loved what you did practically like\nyou were putting up all these like harsh\nstraight up straight speaking quotes\naround you what would be advice to them\nwhen someone kind of feels like they've\nbeen in that place for a while now\nso i think the one of the the shifts for\nme was\nuh i stopped saying can i do this so i\nstopped saying\ncan i get out of this hole and i ch i\nadded one word the word how\nso instead of saying can i get out of\nthis rut i said\nhow can i get out of this rut and i\nthink the\nthe the flame that really worked for me\nspecifically was\nmy goal became i want to be grateful\nthat this is happening\nwhat do i have to do to be grateful that\nthat guy\nuh screwed me over on the steel what can\ni do to be grateful that that\ngirl left me and broke my heart what do\nwhat what has to happen what does life\nhave to look like\nand you know when you know for example\nwhen the business dealings went bad and\nyou know i was in\nuh you know 80 000 debt and i had no\nidea how to earn\nany money as an artist you know i had\nvisions of okay well\nif i have eighty thousand dollars\npositive in my bank account that'll make\nme glad that i went through this you\nknow tough times make tough people\nand working backwards you know now if\nanybody's an athlete\nthat's exactly what you do if you want\nto learn how to take a jump shot\nyou work backwards you start with the\nfootwork you start with the ball\nhandling\nyou do a whole bunch of stuff before you\ntake the shot yes and then\nyou take the shot the exact same shot a\nmillion times\nyou know kobe bryant still practices the\nexact same shot repetition repetition\nso i think for me again it was very\npragmatic was like okay how do i get out\nof this okay\nall right i need to make money i don't\nknow how to make money\num and then having this memory of\nmeeting\nthis this real estate mogul and him\nsaying\nthe way i got rich wasn't by making a\nlot of money it was by not spending a\nlot of money\nthen looking around my apartment and\nbeing like okay wait\ni gotta go i gotta get rid of all this\nstuff so i sold everything on craigslist\nthen i sold the place then i moved back\nwith my mom and dad\nknowing that i could have been doing\nthat six months earlier but the only\nthing that was preventing me from doing\nthat was the fear of embarrassment\nthen becoming recognizing that i was\nafraid of being embarrassed i had\nfor me and for a lot of a lot of a lot\nof people\nyou know we have lovely families and\nbeing homeless and on the street wasn't\ngoing to ever be an option it was\nliterally just being embarrassed and\nthen\nfacing that and being open when people\nlike hey what's going on\noh i just saw you do this great gig out\nhere in india oh\nyou must be living the life and be like\nno i'm not i'm broke\nyou know i'm figuring it out yeah but\nthings aren't as fantastic as you may\nsee\nyeah obviously you know i got to do a\ncool a cool thing and i took a picture\nand posted it online but\nthings are not amazing and i'm figuring\nit out and i will get there\num a lot of the other fears i had i\nremember i borrowed money from a lot of\npeople that required me to\ncall them and say listen i owe you money\ni don't have your money i'm going to\nfigure it out i'm not going to avoid you\nbut you're also not going to see me\nbuying expensive stuff right now\ni'm going to figure this all out and\nagain it took me four years to get my\nbank account to zero\nand then also having a self-awareness of\nevery single day i told myself when you\nget that zero bank account you're gonna\nfeel like a million bucks you're gonna\nstand on top of a mountain you're gonna\ncheer and you're gonna feel like\nyou know my my pursuit of happiness\nmoment that\nlasts a month yeah and then you know it\nlasts a month then you got some other\nproblem\nand then you're like okay i can't there\nis no happily ever after yeah you know\nmy movie doesn't end this is the next\nday after that but then also realizing\nhey if i figured out how to go from\nnegative\n80 grand to zero i can keep going\nyou know and that the biggest gift that\nthat gave me was teaching me the value\nof minimalism\nbecause i didn't have much it was like\nwhoa i didn't need any of the stuff that\ni used to have that i lost i don't miss\nany of the stuff that i lost\ni don't think anything i sold i\nre-bought\nwow nothing i think you know wow nothing\ni think\nthe one thing i didn't sell because it\nwasn't at my place at the time was a\nbicycle\nand i kept it and it was it was an\noverly expensive bicycle\nso i promised myself i would ride it\nevery day to make it worth it then i\nfell in love with bike riding\noh wow but uh i mean i i sold my car i\nstill don't own a car\nyou know i mean we're at the point now\nwe're taking these ride share services\nit's cheaper than owning a car\nyou know i didn't you know i sold a lot\nof equipment you know now\nyou know i rent studios and stuff like\nthat i learned a lot\nthat how much i actually needed to live\nhow much us as human beings get used to\nour conditions\nso you'll get used to very simple\nconditions but you'll also get used to\nvery lavish conditions you can have a\nbeautiful house in the hills and\nafter a year it's home is home yes it'll\nfeel the same and you'll be looking at\nsome other\nlavish house wanting more and i think\nthat gave me that perspective of hey\nyou can keep climbing this mountain\nthere is no peak totally so just have\nfun\nyou know there's no pot of gold at the\nend of the rainbow\nthe rainbow is the reward so have as\nmuch fun as you can\nyes stop taking things so seriously our\ntime is limited here so enjoy it while\nwe're here\ni love it i'll move the pot man let's\ncheck that out we're not done yet but\nthat is just like\nwow man i i the fascinating thing i find\nis when i sit down with you\nwe agree on so much yeah so i'm\nlistening to you\nand i'm never trying to debate anyone\nwho knows me and listens to me knows\nthat i'm not\ni'm never cynical i don't debate people\ni my whole goal is to bring out the best\nout of someone and\nand serve someone by giving them a\nplatform to share their light and share\ntheir truth\nbut what i want to do now is i want to\ndive into a few things i picked out the\nbook okay because i love some of the\nones i picked out\nand you've you've actually already gone\ninto some of them but i'm going to pick\nthese up so\ni love this statement that you make and\ni think it's so important for people to\nrealize this because i think it's a huge\none\nand this book literally busts myths like\nanyone who's listening right now\nwatching right now\nthis book bust myths but in a big way\nand so if you read this book it's not\njust a book of cool\nstories and quotes it's going to help\nyou bust myths\nin a big way that are so deeply\ningrained in our minds and it's\ninteresting you brought that up\nespecially with the idea of debate you\nsaid you know i don't i'm not here to\ndebate and i think what i found was\ni ended up debating many people not\nbecause i wanted to hear my own voice or\nprove them right\nit was because i was desperate to to\nfind\nthe the the practicality and what they\nwere saying that's awesome\nyeah yeah and i would always just be\nlike but wait how you know and i would\nstart challenging them until we either\nfigured it out\noh yeah completely positive debate and\nit really came from a place of sincerity\nyes and i've had a couple conversations\nwith people where they started to\nrealize that they're like hey you're not\njust asking me questions like you you\nreally you know you don't just want an\nanswer you want this to work\nyes and i think that's the reason why\nespecially in this book\nyou know it busts myths because those\nmyths weren't helping me\nyes and i and i only wanted to feel\nbetter i really wanted to feel better i\ndidn't want to feel better for five\nminutes i wanted to feel better\nand and change the direction of my life\nand that and that was like\nthe origins and the purpose of these\nwords\namazing man i love it so this was one\nthat i picked out there aren't very many\nstraight lines in nature\ni wanted to talk about that yes i agree\ni don't like\nthe belief i i grew up believing well\nactually no i grew up believing just\nlike all of us did like the straight\nline of get a\nwork hard study hard get a good job get\nmarried buy a nice house buy a nice\ncurrent life will be perfect\nand i kind of got to 18 yeah and that's\nwhen i realized that that didn't work\nnot because\ni'd done the whole picture because i\nhadn't but i saw people who had\ndifferent things so i saw someone who\nhad lots of money\nand they didn't seem satisfied then i\nsaw someone who had lots of fame and i\nwas analyzing their life and i was\nobserving i was like oh wait they don't\nhave it either\nand then i was observing someone who was\nreally good looking or beautiful or\nwhatever it is\nand they didn't have it either and so i\nwas looking at all of these people not\nthat they weren't good people\nbut they didn't have happiness or\nmeaning or fulfillment\nand so the straight line just didn't add\nup yeah so let's break that down because\ni think that's such a powerful\nmyth to bust yeah completely i think i\nthink what we all have to recognize is\nirrespective of your religious beliefs\nirrespective of\nof your heritage um if you're listening\nto this\ninterview in english you probably grew\nup in a society that was\nkind of based off western philosophy\nwhether that was judaism\nislam or christianity and they and they\nkind of they set this tone of a straight\nline\nyou know do this do this do this do this\nresist and at the end\nthere is a reward um\nyou and i both grew up in eastern\nphilosophy which is cycles\neverything works in a cycle so we're not\nwe don't think in straight lines we\nthink in terms of cycles\nand when you start looking at life\nyou're like well this you know maybe not\nin l.a\nwhere i come from in toronto we have\nfour seasons and they continue to cycle\nwell yeah miserable and then when i\nvisit i bring the sunshine so\nand that's the cycle too because i will\ncontinually visit but i think the\nrealizing that things kind of work in a\ncycle you know everything has a\nbeginning middle and end and\na rebirth and a death or what have you\nit made me realize that hey\nnothing works in a straight line there's\nno straight path to success there's no\nstraight path to happiness\neverything works in cycles and that's\nokay you know i i love the tv show\nbojack horseman and there's a line in\nthere where\nyou know his agent says to him you\nthought\nwinning this oscar was going to make you\nhappy\nforever but it won't but it will make\nyou happy tonight so enjoy it\nyes and you know this whole idea that we\nwe want this everlasting happiness but\nthere's a cycle the cycle\nis that fortunately and unfortunately\nnothing will last forever\nyou know not our worst day not our best\nday and that's okay\nit's a cycle summers don't last forever\nwinters don't last forever\nfriendships don't last forever life\ndoesn't last forever\nthe the great moments won't last forever\nthe hardships won't last forever it's\nalways going to be an\nendless cycle we are part of an endless\ncycle of birth and death\nand um really to understand that hey\nour society was structured on this\nstraight line\nand it's okay that we've all been kind\nof you know when we don't know we're\nalways going to be\ndancing on the template that was kind of\ngiven to us until we decide hey\nthis guy has to be something else and to\nbe honest i think the entire world right\nnow is on that template and it'd\nprobably\nbe very disruptive if we all left at the\nexact same time\num so for me it was\nreally recognizing that hey it's there's\ngoing to be a lot of twists and turns\nthere's going to be a lot of ups and\ndowns\nand it's supposed to be that way and\nthat's the only reason it's interesting\nif you take\nanybody you admire from human history\nand\nyou want to read the story of their life\nyou don't it'll be a very boring book\ntotally you know it'll be a very boring\nmovie yes anything if it was just a\nstraight line\nand everything worked out you know uh i\nthink bill gates said his success is a\nlousy teacher\nand from that perspective we have to\nembrace\nthese challenges and recently i was i\nwas hanging out with\nwith a new friend i met and i and i\nasked them what are you looking forward\nto what are you excited about and they\nsaid\nsuch an interesting answer i'm really\nexcited about all the chaos in my life\nright now\nthere's a lot of chaos and conflict in\nmy life and i know it's here\nto teach me some stuff and i'm really\nlooking forward to tackling it\nand learning from it and i'm like that's\nsuch a refreshing\nmindset because most other people like\noh i'm stressed\nyou know nothing's working out i just\nneed a break and i think for me i'm also\nrealizing that hey breaks\ndon't work you can everybody watching\nyou've\nyou've had a big project you had to do\nyou had a big deadline you had a big\npaper yet to get done\nand then you promised yourself three\ndays of just relax and those three days\nhappen\nand then monday comes again and you're\nnot rejuvenated\nyou're back to it and so what i realized\nis hey you got to have those breaks\nevery day you got to take those naps you\ngot to have that me time you got to play\nthe video games you got to you got to\nwatch those silly movies you got to do\nthat\non your day-to-day basis and there are\nno straight lines in nature\nso let's stop trying to have a straight\nline in our own life\nand you know when we flow the way\neverything else is flowing\nand when we respect the way everything\nelse works\ni always say you don't you know you\ncan't speed up the snow melting you\ncan't speed up that broken leg healing\nyou got to respect the time these things\ntake and when we apply that to our lives\ni feel like it reduces a lot more of the\ntension that we feel\nthat we impose upon ourselves because we\nwant to get over that heartbreak\nyesterday we want to get out of debt\nyesterday we want things to happen now\nnow now\nbut it's those challenges that make life\ninteresting it's those challenges that\nmake\nthat give us the character that we need\nto be the interesting people that we are\nand it's those that it's those\nchallenges that teach us lessons that we\ncan pass down to other people\nso they can start a little bit\nfurther ahead of us and now they can\naddress new challenges new cages\num new new new levels and depths\nof biases and context that we may have\nthat we may not have the time to explore\non our own journeys and i think that's\nthe cool thing about us as human beings\nis we can\npass forward that teaching and and you\nknow the same way\nour parents started at a certain level\nand we get to start a little bit ahead\nyou know and it makes me excited about\nif i have children where where do they\nget to start and you know generation\nfrom a generational level moving forward\nand and it reminds me that listen look\nwe're not the end-all be-all we are a\ndrop in the ocean but as rumi says we're\nalso an ocean in the drop\nyou know so let's play our part in the\ngrand scheme of things but let's also\nrealize that grand scheme exists all in\nus\ntotally and it's it's scary overwhelming\nbut it's also extremely liberating\nand that's kind of how i look at it huge\nadvice man yeah i love that and there's\nbeen two ways\nthat i've dealt with it and i loved you\nas my ways have been\nevery time something doesn't work out\ni'm going through a period of chaos\nor uncertainty or i'm trying to get\nsomething that's not working out there's\ntwo things i've always said to myself\none is don't judge the moment because i\nfeel like we try and\nlabel and judge the moment as being bad\nand i had a lot of friends who were like\nit's a bad period for me right now\nor it's a bad day for me right now it's\na bad life for me right now and you're\njust stretching out\nthat moment and you're judging that\nmoment which we know could be the best\nmoment of your life\nand so my first thing is never judge the\nmoment because my judgment could be so\nwrong\nand then i'll live to regret it later\nbecause i looked at it differently\nand the second thing i've always done is\ni've always always said to myself this\nonly makes the story better\nright when i whenever i can look at a\nfailure and be like yeah i got this\nfailure so that when i tell this story\none day\nto myself it's gonna feel better because\ni'm gonna be like\nyeah like that what you just said like\nthere's no movie of someone's life or\nthere's no book\nor history of someone's life that would\nbe exciting\nif everything just worked out mm-hmm and\nand we forget that we forget that and\nfor me\none of the best ways i processed it that\nwas those are two questions\nor two things i say to myself but it's\ni've recognized that in\nlife i feel we're always in five modes\nand it's the cycle that you're talking\nabout like we're in five steps of a\ncycle\nso we're either learning we're either\nexperimenting and testing\nwe're either performing we're either\nstruggling or we're thriving\nthat's beautiful right so that's the\nfive modes of our cycle of life you're\neither learning something you're\nexperimenting and testing you're\nperforming like you're just making it\nhappen\nyou're struggling or you're thriving the\nproblem is we all\nalways want to be thriving yes so\neveryone every year is like why am i not\nwinning the awards why am i not making\nthe most money why\nwhat you said like we want everything\nnow now now now completely and so we\nwant to be in thriving when actually\nwe're wasting all our energy\npushing ourselves pretending to be and\nthriving yeah when you could just be\nlearning\ncompletely and i've seen that happen in\nmy life so many times and thriving to\neveryone who's listening thriving\nis one percent of all of it no matter\nhow good your cycle is\nthriving like you said that enjoy it for\none night\nthat's where you spark this thought and\ni feel like back to even your point of\njudging\nyeah it's not only should we stop\njudging things as bad\nwe need to stop judging things as good\nyes we all\nhave and i know this without having i\ncan read your entire audience's mind\nwe've all had situations where when it\nwas presented to us we're like this is\ngreat news\nsix weeks later it was the worst thing\nthat ever happened yeah you know\nnone of us own a crystal ball we don't\nknow how things are going to play out\nand and what we're what we're best uh\noff doing is reserving our judgment\nfor saying oh that's good news that's\nbad news because we don't know how\nthat's going to play out\nand it could be anything you know kanye\nwest lost his mother\nbecause she was getting plastic surgery\nyeah you know he attributes that to him\nbeing successful if he never became an\nartist and successful\nshe would have never gotten plastic\nsurgery and she would have never died it\ncan go either way\nand we don't know and the smartest thing\nwe can say is we don't know\ntotally and so when you say reserve\njudgment i think that's an amazing thing\nto do is\nlet's stop evaluating what's happening\nto our lives\nbecause when we stop evaluating it we\ncan start to\nlook for the opportunities and the good\nthat comes from it\nand then thriving can be a mindset yes\nyou know and then it could be you know\nno matter what's happening whether\nyou know w whether we're in the dirt or\nwhether we're in the clouds\nwe can have our mindset is what\nmaintains that\nyeah and i think that's the fantastic\npart about that absolutely man thank you\nfor adding to that no no\ni mean that's what that's what i know\nthat's what i do man\ni wanna you know what it is too is so i\nknow i'm learning\nmyself yes you know how how do i know i\nunderstand it is by\nregurgitating it whether you know making\nit my own trying my best to understand\nwhere you're coming from and then\nyou know also recognizing that i'm\nextremely privileged to be in your\npresence\nwhere there's a lot of people that are\nthat are that are that are consuming\nyour your amazing energy but they don't\nhave the opportunity to just simply be\nlike hey\nwhat did you mean by that hey how do i\napply that to my life and\ni'm not lost on that i'm not lost on\nbeing in your company how dope it is i'm\nnot lost on some of the professional\ncomedians i get\nto be around and just hearing these guys\ntalk and cheer me up i'm not\nlost on the amazing singers whose voices\ni get to hear\nacoustically you know i think as you\nsaid one thing that i learned from you\nin our last hangout which what you said\nwas gratitude needs to be specific\nyou know sometimes we're not specific\nwith our gratitude we just need to be\ngrateful\nor we say oh i'm grateful for the oxygen\nin my lungs just because people tell us\nthat we should be grateful for that but\nmaybe that's not what we're grateful for\nmaybe we're grateful that it's cold\noutside today and we get to try on that\nnew sweater\nand we never got a chance to wear maybe\nyou know maybe we're grateful that\nthat friend canceled dinner on us today\nbecause we really wanted to catch up on\nthat netflix documentary you know\nbeing specific and that that's something\nthat stuck with me off our last\nconversation\nand uh i'm grateful that i get to have\nthese conversations with dope guys like\nyou louis and all these other people and\nknowing that even the other people that\ni don't know are a hop skip jump away\nthrough\nthrough my associates if i really needed\nto ask them a question i could\nfor sure man me too and i feel grateful\nsitting here with you as well because\ni like being able to sit down with\npeople where we can really\ngo back and forth on ideas and build and\nbuild and build and build and build it's\nlike playing lego yeah completely\nlego with a friend it's like you can\nkeep building something but then that\nperson sees that actually that tower\ncould get higher if you go\nthis way you're just building building\nbuilding together i feel like that and i\nfeel like what you also do is like if i\nshine light on something you literally\njust take my hand and you just\nadjust it like half a degree from a\ndifferent angle and i'm just\nand i see a completely new picture and\nit's like holy crap and i think\nthat's what it is it's you're saying\nthings that\neverybody listening to it right now they\nagree with it and they hear it\nbut they were unable to put in those\nspecific words and i feel like that's\nthe\nthat's the value in the service that i\nthink we're both striving to do\nwe're trying to figure it out and then\nwe're trying to make it digestible for\npeople who are also trying to figure out\nyeah and that's why they continually say\nlike oh you read my mind\nit's because you know that's what we do\nyou know and other people in the world\nare painting it\nyeah other people in the world are are\nputting it in music other people in the\nworld are doing different things and\nit's what makes this journey so much\nmore fun\nyeah absolutely man definitely sharing\nit by far\nyes makes it more most fun for me\ncollaborating\nconnecting working together on something\nit's something i wanted my whole life\nand every time i'd make friends when i\nwas growing up one of the biggest\nchallenges with me and friendships was\nthat\nit always became a competition not from\nmy side i've always wanted to be\nlike on good terms with people and kind\nof collaborate and be effective that\ndoesn't mean\nequal but in their sense of like i see\nthe good in you you see the good of me\nlet's let's figure this out\nand i always found that friends i had\ngrowing up especially my teens turned it\ninto competition\nhe's always like oh well how many girls\ncan you get or like\nwho's gonna have the nicer car or who's\ngonna and i was just like no man like\nyou know like let like why does it have\nto be that way\nand it's interesting because that's\nalways been i've always been trying to\ngrapple with that\nbut i find like as we mature and get\nolder people start recognizing we have\ndifferent strengths\nbut we don't need to compare right and\nyou talk about that in the book too yeah\nand i think the\nthe irony of that all too is that yeah a\nfriend masha montano who's an amazing\nsoccer singer out of trinidad\num he he said there's three levels to\nthis there's\nit starts with competition he goes and\nthen you graduate to cooperation\nthen you graduate to collaboration and\nthat doesn't even always have to be a\ndeep thought\nlet's talk about for example getting\ngirls you know you go to the club with\nyour buddies\nand if you guys view each other's\ncompetition you know\nnow you become you guys all isolate\nyourselves from each other you try to go\ntalk to the women\nbut if you guys worked with cooperation\nfor example\nnow a group of guys will do better\nspeaking to a group of girls\nand everybody helps each other and it\nworks a little better\nnow if you graduate to collaboration\nwhere you say listen\nthe goal is bigger than the sum of us\nindividually you're like all right today\nwe're gonna help jay meet the love of\nhis life and now all of us\nare wingmen and we're focused just on\nyou today and then next time\nthe next time somebody else but the\nsuccess rate will be even higher\nyes and it's the same thing with art\nit's the same thing with what we do\nis we can view each other as as\ncompetition and now instead of\nyou know deep diving into your work i'm\ntrying to nitpick it and i was like oh\nlook at this guy's spelling mistakes or\noh\nwhat's that idea or that doesn't apply\nor let me find the one time that his\nadvice isn't going to work\nlike you know what you know what you\nknow\nlet's say for example you said something\nlike you know what doesn't kill you\nmakes you stronger and then i'm like\nwell that doesn't apply if you're\ntalking about cocaine you know i could\nobviously do that\nbut and i feel like you know and you're\nnew to hollywood as well and i've been\ncoming out here for a couple of years\nhere there's a lot of cooperation a lot\nof people like hey\nwe will both benefit if we work together\nand i i'm really trying to find\nthose people and and i'm trying to with\nthem move it to collaboration which is\nwhat we're working on is bigger than all\nof us and\nwe feel like and i think we all want\nthat that's the reason we go to sporting\ngames\nyeah we don't it's not about us now now\nit's about the team\nnow we're part of that moment we're all\ncheering we're all chanting together\nwe're part of something bigger than us\nnow we are that drop in that ocean that\ncollective ocean again\nand i feel like when people recognize\nthe beauty of that more people will be\nmore likely to collaborate\nyeah and say hey i'm a part of something\nbigger than me because you can only be a\npart of something bigger than you when\nyou work and collaborate with other\npeople\nyeah and uh and again that applies to\npicking up girls at the club\nthat applies to working on a book that\napplies to you know being part of a\npodcast that applies to all of that type\nof stuff yeah i love how practical you\nmake you man\nthey have to be practicing just making\npaying and and picking up girls and\neverything practically\nbecause i think also because sometimes\nand and i think\nyou know the the people that were doing\nthis a generation before us they always\nhad this\nholier than thou you know high and\nmighty they always\nthey always try to keep themselves\nliving up to a certain lifestyle and a\nstandard that\num was bound to fail you know\nthey would have to live secret lives to\nyou know they weren't allowed to be\nhuman beings and\ni think what guys like us is like no\nwe're normal flawed human beings\nwe're trying to learn it and as i said i\nput words together\nthat's the reason i sound smart i'm\ntaking other people's wisdom i'm\nlearning it i'm absorbing it\nand i'm putting it into simple words\nbecause i taught eight-year-olds i\nlearned how to use that\nand i always try to remind people that\nthat was one of the biggest things when\nthis book first\ncame out independently it was really\ntrying to remind people that i'm not a\nguru you want to tell that story right\nyes yeah\nso what ended up happening was this book\nis was such an organic process as in\n2014 as i said i was trying to figure\nout how to make money\ni'll be completely honest i was trying\nto figure out how to make money and i\nstarted in the music world i'm a rapper\nand what happened was i was you know\nwhen you rap\nand you make music you're a recording\nartist i worked with a studio engineer\ni work with a couple producers who made\nmy music and i worked with a film team\nto make my videos\nand what happened was my studio engineer\ngot in a fight with his girlfriend and\nstopped picking up the phone\nand i i didn't know how to record this\nis before garage band\nand uh i didn't know what to do and i\nhad a new friend at the time\nwho was the only other full-time\ncreative i knew and by the name of lily\nsingh\nand we had just started hanging out and\nwe were hanging out because we didn't\nknow anybody else who was trying to do\nwhat we were trying to do and she goes\nfigure out what you can do by yourself\nwhat can you do by yourself you don't\nhave to call your video guy because if\nhe's not available because he's shooting\na wedding\nor your producer because he's busy\nworking his day job or your engineer is\nfighting with his girlfriend he went to\nmia\nwhat can you do by yourself you don't\nneed anybody and i said i can write\nand she goes to write and i go i'm going\nto run out of things to write about and\nshe's like well\nit already sounds like you're making\nexcuses just start writing and see if\nyou run out\num and what i used to do is i had a\nfolder on my computer just really cool\npictures and a lot of them were from\nad agencies and just i love the\ncreativity of how they were putting\nmessages across\nso i just took pictures i'd post them on\nfacebook and i'd\nwrite about them and i was so afraid\nthat people were gonna be like hey we\ndidn't sign up for this we want to hear\nyour music and\nyou know at that point i was probably\ndropping a song one once every three\nmonths because it took me a long time to\nmake it\nbut with this writing i can do it every\nday and i was afraid that once i ran\nso first i was afraid that they wouldn't\nembrace it which they did\nthey loved it and then i was afraid i'd\nrun out of pictures and run out of ideas\nand i ran out of pictures but i didn't\nrun out of ideas\nand i just promised myself i would write\nevery single day and post every single\nday\nand try it out for a year let's see what\nhappens and again the first the top\ncomments were you know\nyou're speaking my story you're living\nin my head and then about after three\nmonths\nthe top comment was you should write a\nbook i didn't know how to write a book\nbut i had a friend who was making signs\nbrochures and posters for companies on a\nfor a local business\nhe would make this the displays for like\nhome depot or whatever\nand i said hey i want to make a book do\nyou know how to make a book\nhe goes yeah you have to learn how to\nuse adobe indesign so he sat there and\nhe taught me how to use adobe indesign\nso it took me\nabout a year to write the book and\ncollect the writings and take the\nthoughts and ideas i believed in\nit took me a year and a half to build\nthe original book\nlearning how to format how to make pages\nhow to do margins and widths\nand that happened in 2014 and what i did\nwas\ni crowdfunded i used a site called\nindiegogo which is very similar to\nkickstarter uh the only difference being\na kickstarter you don't hit your goal\nthe whole thing is canceled indiegogo if\nyou don't hit your goal\nyou can still work move forward um\ni made up a number um the number was uh\nten percent of what i had to give up my\nmy place for i sold my my my home and\nmoved back with my parents\nand i said listen if you guys help me\nget the first 10 i'll figure out the\nother 90 percent\nand i did a crowdfunding campaign for\nsix weeks\nand i passed my goal uh my biggest\ncontributor\nwas a harvard professor who was doing\ncrowdsourcing\nhe's doing his uh his his dissertation\nand he was doing his tenure ship in\ncrowdsourcing and he did it for like\nnasa\nand he was just excited at the idea of\nan artist taking his\nhis career in his own hands and he gave\nme the largest contribution that we had\nnever met wow and didn't even know who\nhe was and that taught me that hey\ngreat things happen when you put\nyourself out there and i went and asked\nfor help and\nit was it was really interesting because\na lot of people i knew\ndidn't contribute a lot of people i\nbarely knew did contribute\nuh there was one gentleman who had a had\na business and\nhe used to let me work out of his office\ninstead of me going to coffee shops\nhe gave me a large contribution because\nhe saw me working every day it was just\na it was\nthe scariest most inspiring moment of my\nlife\nasking for help letting people know that\ni\nneed help and everything is not all good\nand people responding\nand yeah i used that money and i put the\nbook together and uh\nfrom that process i wrote it was about\n300 people\ngave me money and i raised about 26\ngrand that's incredible\nyeah it was amazing and my favorite\npiece of that was i wrote a thank you\ncard\nto every single person and again i told\nmyself you always talk yourself out of\nthese things like you can't write a\nthank you card to 300 people you can end\nup writing the same things\nbut it ended up being the most fun i\never had because\nwriting somebody a thank you card is\namazing receiving a thank you card is\namazing it was a win-win for everything\nand it actually got me to launch my own\nthank you cards yeah\nand i have my own line of thank you\ncards because of that and\nreally again promoting practical\ngratitude find an excuse to say thank\nyou\nwhether you're saying it to your mailman\nwhether you're saying it to you the\nbarista at starbucks\njust find an excuse to say thank you and\nthat process taught me the importance of\nbeing vulnerable\nand not just being vulnerable for\ncurrency to connect with people but\nbeing vulnerable\nso you can address those vulnerabilities\nand find your strength\nand not only find your strengths inspire\nother people to find their strengths\num because sometimes they think the\nconsequences of being vulnerable are\ngoing to be the end of the world\nand when they and i thought it was too\nand it did not end up being the end of\nthe world so when this book came out\nand came out independently and i was\nusing it to sell at my shows\ninstead of selling t-shirts i would i\nwould do a performance in a city\nand i'd sell the book and you know with\nwith the print service i was using i was\nable to ship the book to whatever city i\nwas performing it and it was great\num after a couple of years i was invited\nto be on a literary show in canada\ncalled canada reads\nthink uh survivor for books just a bunch\nof personalities arguing about books\ndebating books and i wasn't debating my\nbook i was just debating a book that\nuh i had i liked called 15 dogs which is\nan amazing book about dogs given human\nintelligence in the city of toronto so i\njust like these are all my favorite\nthings intelligence dogs\nyeah and uh i debated the book and i won\nand because i won that it was in the\nliterary community and people figured\nout that i had\nwritten that i had written a book and uh\nthe biggest bookstore in canada\nuh pretty much the only bookstore in\ncanada indigo um they like we're\nstarting a publishing wing\nand we would love to to republish your\nbook and at that time i was like so you\nguys are gonna give me money to email\nyou a pdf\ni was like this you know this is a\nno-brainer but once they plugged it into\ntheir community of book lovers\num it grew very quickly and it became a\nbest seller and was on the list for\nabout six months\ncongrats and uh yeah and and then from\nthere\nuh it you know i i signed with harper\ncollins in america and\nyou know and now we're releasing it and\nuh i'm really excited because\nit's it's kind of a testament to plant a\nseed and it grows when it grows\nso it was independently published in\n2014\nand now it's getting its worldwide\nrelease and you know five years later\nand again if i wanted it now uh\nwhen i first published the book then i\nwould consider the book of failure\nbecause it wasn't a bestseller\nthe day i hit publish you know it took\nfive years for this book to grow into\nwhat it needed to grow\nfor for the the world to connect with it\nthe way it did\nand i mean it goes to show that things\ndon't happen on our schedule\nno uh we gotta trust that process when\nit happens and\njust try to have as much fun as we can\nand i'm excited to see where it goes\nwith this\nyeah me too man i'm excited for you i\nthink it's a great book i think it's\nuh i think it's it's what people need\nin the format that they need it yeah and\nin the words that they need to hear it\nyes and and i love that it's an easy\nread in the sense that someone can pick\nit up\nanywhere yes and start wherever they\nneed to and i say that in a positive way\nbecause i feel like anyone who's\nnot got time to read a book or like oh\nyou know i don't know when i'm going to\nget a moment or i\ni'm not used to getting through books\nthis solves all that issue yeah because\nyou can literally just pick up one a day\ncompletely and that was that was a big\nthing i wanted to really\nmake it i'm not a book reader you know\nand the irony of\ngetting plugged into the whole literary\nworld is the amount of books that every\ntime you have a meeting with a publisher\nthey send you home with a with a box of\nbooks yeah so i have a beautiful library\nnow in my home\nof books that i haven't read but um i\nrealized i'm like i'm not\nthe biggest book reader i i it's a time\ncommitment sometimes yes\nand um i wanted to design a book that\nwas easy to read so yeah every\nevery chapter is no longer than two\npages um you don't have to read it in\norder\nyou can literally pick out a random\nchapter every single day if you want you\ncan read it backwards forward skip a\nchapter go even numbers odd numbers\nwhatever you want\nyeah uh you know you can make a game out\nof it and i think that was the goal with\nthis was really trying to\nmake it easy and digestible and simple\nand practical\nyeah and that was really the big thing\nand the success of this book even\neven the canadi when it was a bestseller\nin canada there were still spelling\nmistakes in the book\nand i think this was a very important\nlesson that i wanted to stress with\npeople especially my artists who were\nwatching and listening\nthings don't have to be perfect totally\nman we that's an excuse we make like oh\ni need a professional editor oh\nno i mean i i had it proofread but from\nyou know a girl i was seeing at the time\nand my sister yeah you know and they\nproofread it and even then it still\nwasn't perfect\nyeah and you know it this this version\nnow that you guys will be getting\nis professionally edited and uh but even\nthen\namazing editors at harper who understood\nmy voice yeah and understood that hey\nwhere\nhis his job here isn't sound smart yeah\nhis job here is to be easy\nto understand and digestible and\ni'm really excited for people to read\nthis and connect with it and give\nfeedback\nand there's an interesting activity at\nthe end of the book encouraging people\nto write their own chapter\nand send it my way and just re you know\nthat's my favorite part is because what\ni realized\nthe pattern that i've been picking up\nmost recently is\none thing that i was doing\nsubconsciously and not knowing was\nbuilding community\ni think in the beginning i have two\nsisters so i think in the beginning i\nthought i was always\nwanting brothers so i was like trying to\nfind brothers but what i realize now\nmore is i want a community\nyeah because uh i didn't feel like i fit\nin with people\num not just as somebody with a beard and\nturban but i also felt like as a\ncreative\nas an artist with my my my priorities\nwith my values\ni didn't feel like i fit in and the\nmoment i found anybody\nwho kind of was on the same journey as\nme it was just like that's it\nyou're stuck with me now and i've been\nbuilding this community and i felt like\nwhat this book allowed me to do\nwas expand that community and find more\nlifelong learners more people who\nare excited at the idea of having their\nbiases challenged\nbecause a lot of people don't you\nchallenge a lot of people's beliefs and\nvalues and that's a great way to lose a\nfriend\nbut there are a lot of other people like\nwow i believe this for the last\n20 years and you just three sentences\nflipped it and i love when that happens\nto me\ni'm scared if that ever stops i want to\nbe 80 years old and still have beliefs\nthat i\nthat i held tightly and dear to me and\nbe able to let them go and learn\nsomething new because that's how we know\nwe're alive yeah\nyeah me as well man all the way\ncompletely guys i've seen\nhumble post every day crossing off\nthe date on the calendar because he's\nbeen writing yes and committed to\nwriting this book so i'm excited to\nshare it with

you don't dig it let me\nknow\nhit me up on social media after you know\nand just let me know what you didn't\nlike\nyeah and i mean you know we'll take that\ni am open\nto constructive feedback and
