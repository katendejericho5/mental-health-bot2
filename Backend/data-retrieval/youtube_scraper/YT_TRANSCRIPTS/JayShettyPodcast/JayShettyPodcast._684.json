    "transcript": "otherwise i think like you've got to\nsometimes you have to push the envelope\nthere's been too many generations that\nhave been defined by what people\nthink you know we can achieve or\nyou know limitations that have been\nimposed because of\npeople not being able to think or dream\nbig enough\nand i think it's every generation's\nresponsibility to show the endless\npossibilities to the next\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you\nthat come back every week to listen\nlearn\nand grow today's guest is someone that\ni've been looking forward to\ninterviewing for a very long time i\nbelieve that\nshe was actually one of the first names\non my list when i launched the podcast\ntwo years ago\nof someone that i was really excited to\nsit down with so to me this is a super\nspecial moment\nand i think you're in for a real treat\ntoday's guest\nis the one and only priyanka chopra and\ntoday we're talking about her new\nmemoir unfinished for the two people who\nare listening who don't know who priyank\nis\npriyanka is an actor singer and film\nproducer\nshe's been in the entertainment industry\nfor over 20 years\nthat spans both the east and west her\nbollywood superstardom began\nwhen she won miss world 2000 and she\nhasn't slowed down since\nfrom starting her own production company\nand now having so many successful\nhit movies and tv shows in the us and of\ncourse most recently\nmarrying her beloved nick jonas\npriyanka's story is remarkable to say\nthe least\nand you can pick up her book unfinished\non february 9th\nplease welcome to the show on purpose\npriyanka chopra\njonas it's all right\neveryone forgets that\nyou know it's it's an it's a new\naddition and um\nit's you know i've had 35 years of my\nlife as just priyanka chopra most people\nknow me as just that so\nyou know it's going to take a second\nit's fine i i've been watching you\nfor so many years since i was since i\nwas a kid\nand obviously you were you're a kid too\nuh when you\nstarted in the industry and so i've been\nhearing your name and saying your name\nfor so long\nand but no no offense nick my wife is\nalso the same she she has her\nhe has my name last on her name too so\npeople forget me all the time\nso we have something in common uh but\nit's not really forgetting\nyou jay it's forgetting your last name\nthere's a different truth\ntrue thank you thank you for the\nclarification that that makes my\nmy ego feel a bit better uh but honestly\nit's such a joy to have you here i meant\nwhat i said when we first launched the\npodcast you were\nyou were one of the first names that i\nwrote down as someone that i was excited\nto speak with\nand i saw a few days ago on instagram\nyou posted a picture of yourself at age\n17.\nand it was it was a great throwback and\nand i was wondering\ntwo things the first thing is what is a\npiece of advice that you wish\nyou had at 17 and the other way around\nis there a piece of advice or wisdom\nthat your 17 year old self\nwould potentially share with you now uh\nwhere you are today\nyeah i have actually answers for both um\nwhat i would tell that 17 year old you\nknow i was bright-eyed bushy-tailed i'd\njust been selected into the miss india\npageant i'd just turned 17\nand i was like oh my gosh i'm going to\nbe a model\nand i'd never thought about that my\nteenage vanity was peaked\nand what i would have told that girl is\nyou know um just breathe\nand just chill a little i was very hard\non myself\nbecause everything that i sort of\neverything that i've made so far\nyou know with the encouragement of my\nfamily has kind of been self-made\nyou know i had to learn on the job\nnobody\ni didn't know anything i came from in\nhigh school\nin an engineering background or i wanted\nto be an engineer\num and life just kind of had other plans\nand you know you kind of\nare you gonna swim are you gonna sink\nand i will always swim\nso i've just kind of it's i think that\nwhat i would tell i used to really take\nit very seriously i berated myself a lot\nand i was hard on myself and i would\ntell my younger self chill out\ntime heals everything it'll all be fine\nand what she would probably tell me is\nto not get caught up in\num in my schedule and in the multiple\nthings that i juggle\nand not forget the excitement\nof doing what i'm doing sometimes it's\nhard you know after you\ndo it for such a long time um\nyou have to remind yourself to be\nexcited and be inspired and\nyou know feel sort of alive instead of\nit being a job\nand yeah i think that's what she would\ntell me\ni love that that's a beaut both of those\nare beautiful answers and\ni wanted to ask that to you because i\nthink often we think like oh we have the\nwisdom now and we can advise\nour younger selves but in the way you\nshared your answer there's there's so\nmuch wisdom coming back and and i think\nthat's a great reminder\nfor everyone now i saw a video again on\nyour instagram where you just received\nthe book\na couple of days ago i had the digital\nversion up until this morning when i\nfinally\ngot the physical version so i've been uh\nflicking through\non the digital version it's nice to have\nit physically here\ni i'm intrigued that you know\nwhat chapter of your life you spoke\nabout excitement there what chapter of\nyour life\nwas the most exciting to reflect and\nwrite upon\nbecause it's such a fascinating thing to\nto write a memoir\nbut which one which part of it was your\nfavorite of going through\num my childhood because i hadn't thought\nabout it for a really long time you know\ni was\nin fact just writing the memoir was so\nhealing and\nweirdly um sort of inspiring\ni i just remember never remembering\nyou know i sat down to write it and i\nhad never thought about\nwhat had happened in my life i never\nlooked back i was only\nrunning you know um as you know um the\nentertainment business\nour jobs are very transitory you know\nit's not\nconsistent it's not stable what you are\nas much as your next job you don't know\nwhere your next check's coming from you\ndon't know where you're going to be\nmoving\nso you know there's a constant like\nhustle and you're running all the time\nand i just never looked and when i\nstarted writing the book i\nwas forced to look and i was very\nexcited to write about my childhood\nbecause i could taste it i could smell\nit\ni i remember um those mogra flowers the\nraat kirani that used to\nbe in all the army barracks i remember\nyou know the feeling of the the cold\nwalls they used to always be white the\ngarden\nmy bike um moving to a new city every\ntwo years\nit was that was it was such an um\na time of adventure for me and\na time of sort of unlimited\npossibilities you know\num and i was raised with that my parents\nalways made me feel like i could\nthe world is my oyster you know i can go\nanywhere i want\num and that was such a time of wonder\nyou know\nyeah well it's it's beautiful that you\nhave such strong vivid memories and it\nsounds like\nand and i'm thinking about our audience\nthat's listening and watching\nor will listen and watch this afterwards\nit sounds like everyone needs to revisit\ntheir childhood\nor remember and and write a memoir\neven if it's not a memoir that gets\npublished and goes out to the world it\nalmost feels like reflecting is really\nimportant what\nwhat helped you were you speaking to\nfriends from back then or were you\nspeaking to your\nyou know who who are you connecting with\nto to reignite some of those memories\noh everyone in the memories you know i\ncalled\nmy mom my brother my cousins who i grew\nup with\nfriends from the time i corroborated the\nstories because memory is a weird thing\nyou know\ni remember it a certain way somebody\nelse remembers it a certain way\nand there was this one story i remember\ni was kicked out of moma for touching\na painting when i was 15 16 or something\nand i remember that\nday being wonderful because we went to\nthe statue of liberty after\nand like you know um we we got hot dogs\nand we were walking around new york city\nand i remember it being like oh i\ntouched\nyou know a painting that's so cool that\ni touched i think it was a starry night\nand my cousins who were with me\nremember the day completely differently\nthey were tortured\nembarrassed my cousin was an art student\nshe was like you got me kicked out of\nmoma\nand like i was like wow i didn't\nremember that at all\nwell that's brilliant was that your\nwas that your rebellious side or was\nthat a mistake\nor was it curious just curious\ni just i feel like rules sometimes\nand trust me i mean i'm in a public\nprofession i have to follow them\nbut um you know sometimes we conform to\nrules that just sort of stop our ability\nto grow\nand unless it's like hurting someone or\nsomething\nwhich by touching starry night i\nprobably was hurting\nthe painting but at that time i didn't\nknow\nwell the value of the paint the value of\nthe painting just went up\nit just went up but you know like\notherwise i think like you've got to\nsometimes you have to push the envelope\nthere's been too many generations that\nhave been defined\nby what people think you know we can\nachieve or\nyou know limitations that have been\nimposed because of\npeople not being able to think or dream\nbig enough\nand i think it's every generation's\nresponsibility to show the endless\npossibilities to the next\nyeah you've definitely done that i mean\nyou're you're constantly breaking rules\nin\nin your career and your journey starting\nfrom touching that pain to get moma all\nthe way\nthrough today but was that was that an\nenergy and a mindset that you believe\nyou had at that young age\nor is that something you think you\ngradually developed where did that\nconfidence come from because when i hear\nyou say today\nit comes with confidence obviously it\ncomes with having done it\nand i think there are a lot of people\nout there who may feel that way but they\nthen also\nfeel insecure that are they the right\nperson to do that\ndo they have permission to do that\nthere's there's something that then\nstill holds them back\nwhat was it for you that allowed you to\ngo all the way\nwell two things my parents for sure i\ngrew up in an environment where i was\nnot shamed for my ideas\num at 12 years old i told my parents i\nwanted to live in america with my aunt\nand\nyou know my parents were like bye peace\nyou know it was fine\nwe had a logical pro and gone\nconversation i was raised sort of to\nhave\nopinions even if the room was hostile\num so i think that really gave me a\nsense of self and i think it's really\nimportant in parenting for us\nto treat our children like they're\ndeveloping their own minds\nbecause that's so important for\nthem to have a sense of self and feel\nlike you know they're not\nrobots but they're actually thinking and\nthey have a say in their decisions it\nreally\nlends for adults being able to have a\nsense of confidence and second\nto really understand and accept that\nconfidence is not something you always\nneed you don't you know so put it in a\nbackpack\nit's okay give it a break let it be in\nyour purse let it be in your wallet\nlet it chill for a second feel insecure\nfeel like scared\njust feel afraid feel vulnerable um\nbut when you need the confidence and you\nwalk into that room\nyou'll have it because you didn't keep\nusing it you didn't need to constantly\nhave a you know cover of or um\nsort of like a uniform of confidence you\ndon't have to always show confidence you\ndon't have to exude confidence you never\nyou don't\nyou just have to pull it out when you\nneed it and then when it's in the\nreserve\nit's so much more powerful because\nyou're allowing yourself to be\nall the things i feel insecure i'm\nterrified that this book is coming out\nit's the first time i've ever written\nand i've never been so personal\nin my whole life i've been a public\nperson for 20 years\nnever scratched beneath the surface i've\ngotten away with sharing\nwhatever i wanted to share about my life\nand not more you know\nmy story is people think they know it\nbut they really don't\nand i've managed that for 20 years but i\nthink\ni now on the other side of 35 was\nfeeling a sense of confidence and a\nsense of self\nin my capabilities in what i bring to\nthe table\nit only took 20 years for me to get\nthere but i got there\num and i think all those insecurities\nthat i\naddress in my book don't scare me that\nmuch anymore as they did at that time as\nyou know they worried me and i was like\ni don't want to talk about it nobody\nneeds to\nknow about my life and you know but now\ni'm at a place where i'm just like\nwell it's still on my terms and um\nyou know i'm hoping that people maybe\nget to know me a little bit more than\na fashion meme or a headline or\nsomething like that\nyeah i i think that's what i love about\nit from the few pages that i've i've\nflicked through\ni definitely see you allowing yourself\nand that's\nthat's the power of a book though and so\ni relate to that insecurity my first\nbook came out\nlast september i know we know your first\nbook\ni was i have it i was so oh that's\nawesome i'm so glad you have it i was\ni was so nervous so i can i know what\nyou mean by that\nand especially for you at this stage in\nyour career of yours is a memoir mine\nhad part stories it wasn't a memoir\nso i can only imagine but i see you\ndoing that\nand books are so powerful for that and\nthat's why i really\nhope everyone who's listening and\nwatching right now if you're enjoying\nthis conversation\ngo and pick up the book because i do\nthink that\nmedia the news the the short meme the\nclip\nit portrays such a limited view\nof of someone like yourself and it's a\nsuperficial view\nreally yeah and you and it's okay it's a\nchoice\nalso i i want to for people to consume\nonly a part of me you know i want to be\nable to preserve\nmy humanity my family my life my\nopinions\ni may have chosen a public profession\nbut i'm not an elected\nofficial i don't owe an explanation to\nanyone\nfor the choices that i make you know i'm\nhere to create work i'm doing a job just\nlike everybody else mine happens to be\nin entertainment\nand it happens to have a lot of cameras\non my face it's fine\nyou know i made it i made that deal with\nthe devil so i've kind of made peace\nwith the fact that\ni i prefer it being from a distance\num but at the same time i think\nnow i've been a public person for more\nthan half my life it's my normal\nand only now have i reached a point\nwhere i'm allowing the walls to sort of\nfall down and\nletting whoever wants to know me get to\nknow me as the person that i am\nbefore that i was very protective of who\ni was because maybe i was insecure about\nwho i was or i was i still didn't have a\nsense of self i don't know\nbut i think in the journey of life i've\nreached a place where you know\ni'm i'm good with who i am yeah so\nwhat's that's wonderful to hear by the\nway and and i can feel it off your\nenergy what's the part of yourself in\nthis book\nthat you share that you think most\npeople are going to be surprised by\nwhere you think that people may just be\nlike what like and i'm sure there's many\nbut but what's something that stands out\num it's\nthere there are a few um which i think\npeople may be surprised by that i was\nvulnerable enough\nto discuss um\nand i think my my failures\nmy struggles rejections\num sadnesses that\num i've never really people have never\nseen\ni always wear a brave front most women\nin\nlike you know tough jobs have to always\nhave like a little bit more of a\nstronger front um to be taken seriously\ni built that very early\num at 18 to be thrown into\nthe limelight of this job i mean\nyou know it you've been in it for a long\ntime you know it's it's a crazy\nprofession the expectations the pressure\num you know to deliver under that\nscrutiny\num to be artistic to yet have a point of\nview to be unique\nnot you know have your own trajectory\nbecause that's the only way it'll work\num you know nobody wants me twos in the\nentertainment business you want\nnew kind of you know you have to always\nhave a sense of evolution so it was\nreally really\nscary in in the beginning and um\ni think everything just changes with\ntime and this was one of the good\nchanges that came out of it for me yeah\nno\nabsolutely and i'm hoping that i i\nwonder do you think that's changing now\nif someone's coming into the\nentertainment industry today at 18 or do\nyou think it hasn't changed where's your\nperception on that when you're guiding\nyoung artists or seeing people that\nyou follow on social media or you know\nwhatever it may be\nare you feeling it's changing has it\nimproved or no\nthe pressure you mean uh not the\npressure more the\nlike you were saying like you when you\ncame into the industry you had to put on\na brave front you had to wear that face\nit was the only way to survive do you\nfeel it's the same now for young talent\nas well\num i i think well i was talking about\ndefinitely as a female\nin yeah business oh as a female okay yes\num i think so i think um\nyou know um it's still hard when you're\nstarting out for women to be taken\nseriously\nfor your ideas to be given the kind of\ncredence that\num a man's would as quickly\nprobably you know um especially in\nprofessions where\nyou do you know normally you don't see\nwomen because\nyou know women have never been pushed in\nthat direction or women have never\nwanted to go in that direction because\nit was never normalized for them that\ntheir ambitions could go in that\ndirection\nbusiness politics um you know to be\nheads of companies\num engineering like you know coding\num policy making like stuff like that\nlawyers\nwomen have just about in the last few\ngenerations been coming to the fore and\nyou know are standing next to neck with\nguys but\nit's still an anomaly it's still not as\nnormal\nin terms of numbers it's still not equal\nso until that happens i think it will be\nhard for\num you know young girls to be sick and\ntaken seriously when they come into\nprofessions that are\npredominantly male um but it's okay\num you know women before us have fought\nthe fight and\nwomen after us will fight the fight\nit'll just hopefully not be the same\nfight\nhopefully our generation will not let\nour kids inherit our problems you know\num\nas women um we are definitely working in\nthat direction but i think as\nthe world needs to sit up and take\nnotice that\nthis demand is loud because it's a\nrequirement\nthis demand is loud because\nthat's what's right and that is the\nreflection of the world\nwomen are 50 of it and we should be\nreflected in\num you know every area and basically\nfeminism is that right like\ndon't decide for me what i should be\ndoing when i should be doing it\nand how i should be doing it just like\nmen have had that freedom\ngive me that as well yeah so i guess\nit's that\nsorry completely no no you're not\ndeviating at all it's a strong message\nand i stand by it so it's uh\nit's a great message and and it's really\ninteresting\nwhere male privilege is a really\ninteresting thing to reflect on i\nremember when i first started\nreflecting on it was a prob even really\na few years back and i feel very much i\nwas raised\nby my mom and i have a younger sister so\ni'm very close to the women in my life\nbut\nit started to strike me in a crazy way\nthat i grew up\nhaving had certain dreams of becoming\nsomething that my sister couldn't have\nhad\nand and that wasn't because of the way\nwe were parented it was because of what\nyou saw\nand and when that really hit me and i\nstood and looked at that\nand i often encourage a lot of my\nfriends in that direction too i'm like\nif you really think about\nif they have a son and a daughter i'm\nlike if you really think about some of\nthe options that don't seem available\nto your daughter that she may never\nconsider a career and i really think\nthat that consideration\nis where the equality is like the\nopportunity\nof even having that idea of i could do\nthat opportunity of\nof having choice i think you know a lot\nof women we are\ni'm i'm extremely privileged that i was\nraised by a feminist i'm married to a\nfeminist\num i'm extremely privileged that my\nparents which is why i\nbrought up parenting um earlier\na big reason i have a sense of\nconfidence and i i'm on this side\nthis side of the fight because um it's\nnot as\nhard as it is on so many women around\nthe world i still had to fight of course\ni had to break down the doors and i had\nto\nyou know prove a point to be taken\nseriously i was kicked out of movies and\nreplaced and you know\nall the things but i still had it so\nmuch easier there are women around the\nworld that don't have a say\nin their life that are married off when\nyou know other people decide that\npeople choose who they are married to\nwhether they can work or not when they\nshould have children what kind of\nchildren they should have\nand that doesn't mean giving up culture\nthat doesn't mean giving up tradition\nyou know it just means creating\nopportunity my father told me when i was\nvery very young\nmy mom since i was nine years old you\nwill have financial independence\nbefore anything you do it doesn't matter\nwhose daughter you are it doesn't matter\num you know who you're marrying married\nto you'll stand on your own feet and\nthere's such a power to that\num to having you know to be raised by\nparents who\nput that in my head so i was ambitious\nfrom\n12 years old i decided every year what i\nwanted to be\nand it changed every year i i love\nhearing that and i've i\nit reminded me of something you've said\nbefore when you were speaking about your\nfather there\nabout how uh nick for you shares this\nsame\nadmiration of your power and and your\nambition\nand and feels you know supportive and\nexcited and\nenthusiastic about the way you carry\nyourself\ntell us a bit about how i i feel like\nthat's such an important thing for both\nthem\nanyone in a relationship to feel like\ntheir partner\nis inspired by their values their\nbeliefs and their\ndreams what has it felt like in the past\nwhere you feel like you haven't had that\nand if someone who's listening or\nwatching is\nfeeling like maybe i don't have that how\ndoes how do you think someone can\nnavigate that or to ultimately attract\nthe partner that\nthat does have that what's that journey\nlike because i think a lot of people\nfeel like they're with someone who may\nnot understand or get their dreams\nespecially when they're starting out\nthen it's the wrong person for you and\nif you have the\num especially if you're starting out and\nyou know you're testing the waters and i\nthink it's so\ncrucial if you have a choice in your\nlife to end up\nwith someone who is not like\nenthused by your dreams is at least\ninterested in them is at least excited\nabout them\nor you know is at least um\nencouraging like that's that's exciting\num because you know everyone's busy and\neveryone has a thing in their lives\nbut to take to make the effort to um\nto make the effort to make you feel like\nyour dreams are as important as the\nother one is such a gift\nand um i have been very blessed to have\nthat\nyou know i find wherever you are in your\nrelationship obviously you and nick\nlead extremely busy lives uh\nyou know my wife and i lead busy lives\nand i feel even if someone's not in the\nentertainment industry or the media\nindustry\neveryone feels like they live busy lives\nwhat does\nsupport look like when two people are\nbusy\ndriven and ambitious because you\nobviously have it you're speaking about\nit right now and it's beautiful\nwhat does that actually look like in a\nreal practical sense obviously the last\nsix months or the last 12 months have\nbeen different\nbut in reality what does that look like\nbecause i feel that\nmaybe sometimes we have false\nexpectations sometimes you want\nyou know it's not natural that you can\nbe at every show nick does it's not\nnatural for him to be at every set\nyou're doing same with me and my wife\nlike my wife can't be at every event i'm\nspeaking at i can't be at\nevery uh interview or something she's\ndoing\nwhat does support look like what does\nlove look like in a very\nreal practical sense i think when it\ncomes to support\nspecifically i think giving the other\nperson the space\num to do what they're doing\nis very important without you know them\nfeeling like oh my like for example i'm\nhere in london for a year\nright now and nick is filming in la\num and i can't travel but before the\nholland\nhe made sure he was here for two months\nto settle me in\nyou know to make sure that the house was\nall set up\nand everything was sorted and we were\ntogether for the holidays\nthat's because he was free um at the end\nof the month\nand that support um you know it doesn't\nhave to be\nlarge it doesn't have to be a um\nyou know a big expression of\ni don't know love and or big gifts it's\nnot it's it's about giving space\nit's about giving freedom it's about\nappreciation\nand i find this one thing really helpful\num i always think about when\nyou know he's busy or he's having a\ncrazy day\nwhich i he does for me as well which is\namazing and\neveryone can follow this and it's super\neasy um is to think about how can i make\nthat person's day\neasier just like and that's such a\nlovely\nloving thing just sometimes i'm you know\nback to back especially when i was doing\npromo\ni was doing like 20 interviews and\nsuddenly there'd be like a really nice\ncocktail that would come in in the\nevening or suddenly there'd be a really\nnice like cup of coffee or\nyou know something to eat for me that\nwould come in and it's just like\nso sweet to think about that or if i'm\nsitting outside\nyou know you'll bring a blanket and put\nit it's just being thoughtful and aware\nabout your person and you know that's\nthe greatest form of love\nis showing it without really\nasking for it yeah that's such a great\npiece of advice\ni love that to be you you said to be\nthoughtfully aware\nand i think that's that's so true and\nand the beautiful thing about everything\nyou just said is that it's\nit's free it's cheap it's small it's\nsimple it's in it's it's exciting it's\nthe best gift\nyeah and it's the best gift yeah when\nyou feel like someone's\nin tune with you and and your emotions\nand how you feel\nhow you might be tired or how you might\nbe sleepy or how you might be cold like\nthose small things when you feel\nsomeone's aware and and i love that\npiece of advice i think it's something\nthat\neveryone's definitely learned more about\nin the pandemic where we're exposed to\neach other\ntell me a bit about the the title\nunfinished because i\nobviously it leads to your determined\nambitious\nvoice but what other parts of your\ngrowth\nuh maybe internally personally do you\nfeel you're\nunfinished on or working on i mean so\nmuch i've just about\nyou know i'm in my 30s and this decade\nhas been\namazing because um\ni've just you know found my strengths i\nthink\nas a woman and um what i'm looking\nforward to\ngoing forward is i'm very nascent in my\ncareer in america right now it's just\nbeen five years since i've\nstarted working here i just about have\ndone my first\nyou know leading feature film i've just\nabout done my first dramatic part here\num i want to be able to build you know\nthe kind of career that i had the good\nfortune of building in another\namazing industry um in india i've done\nsuch a variety of roles there\nworked with the best filmmakers best\nactors\ni want to be able to have that\nexperience here so that i'm\nlike my artistic side now that i've\nstarted on this journey in this part of\nthe world\nis peaked to be able to do that as well\nas a producer i want to be able to\ncreate\num a lot more south asian content\nin hollywood i just i didn't see enough\nparts for myself i didn't see enough of\nit on tv and considering um how large\nthe south asian population\nis in around the world and how english\nspeaking\nwe are you know english language\nentertainment should be reflecting that\nso i want to be able to\ntell stories um in india as well and\nas here um i want to build as an\nentrepreneur it's something i didn't do\num you know up until now because i was\nbuilding my\nacting career so much so you know\nfounding my own brand\num investing in tech i find that really\nfascinating um my philanthropy\ni want to be able to set up my\nfoundation really well\nmy work with unicef um i've just about\nmoved into\nour new house after almost 10 to 15\nyears of living in rentals or hotel\nrooms you know\nbecause i always just kept moving i was\nso nomadic um\ni'm looking forward to you know watching\nthe trees grow in my garden\ni love that watch it watching trees grow\nis great i love that\nthat's brilliant i hearing you\nhearing you say that uh i i love hearing\nyou talk about\nthe south asian storytelling like\nobviously that that relates very\nstrongly to me and my roots growing up\nin london as well where i think we have\nan incredibly strong\nsouth asian community where you are\nright now where i was born and raised\nand i definitely felt this\nyeah lack of lack of representation lack\nof the ability to\nlack of opportunity lack of opportunity\nto dream in a certain way and\nyou know my career has been totally\nrandom but it's\nand and you know i'm doing something\ntoday that i would never have imagined\neven knowing it\nexisted see even that you and i two\nsouth asians sitting\nin these boxes and talking about the\nfact that the careers that we're\nthriving\nin that we have worked so hard to make\nwas never in our minds\nwas never a possibility but i would have\nnever dreamed about it because it wasn't\nin my realm of dreaming\nbut that's not how it should be\nconsidering\nthe he we're one-fifth of the world's\npopular we're huge we're everywhere\nokay and i think and it shouldn't be so\nhard for me to\nyou know come into an industry and say i\nwant an opportunity\nand for people to be like oh well we're\ngoing to have to create that now won't\nwe\nwe've existed for a really long time\nyou know it's the irony of it is so\namusing but\nsad at the same time yeah no that\nresonates very strongly with me because\ni didn't even know any careers existed\nand and and when i say this i i don't\nsay it lightly i genuinely didn't\nbelieve\ncareers existed out of outside of\nmedicine engineering and business like i\ndidn't\nreally know i didn't know that you could\nhave\na successful career in anything else\nat 17 when i was it was a fluke\nwhy i got got into the miss india\npageant\nand that kind of kick-started everything\nfor me but\ni wanted to be an engineer because those\nwere the options doctor engineer lawyer\nand you know if you come from an\nacademic family of\nor failure um if you come from an\nacademic family or\nyou know our parents our immigrants and\nour parents\nlike my parents even in india were you\nknow building their businesses for the\nfirst time it wasn't inherited from them\nso they also were surviving and i think\nit's that survival instinct\nthat sort of pushed them to put the\naspirations that they knew best\nyou know on their kids like this is the\nbest job you'll always make money you\nwill be stable\nyes you know but also the internet sort\nof changed our\num i think our generation\nthe the fact that the internet made the\nworld such a small place which is\nanother big reason why we should see so\nmuch more representation is because we\nare catering to the whole world now\ndefinitely definitely i you're reminding\nme of\na few years ago i before i actually\nstarted doing what i do today\ni went to a a presenter training day\nrun by the bbc in london at pinewood\nstudios i'm sure you've know it or have\nseen it\nand we went to these studios and it was\nan ethnic minority tv training day\nso it was only for ethnic minorities so\ni went into this room and there were\njust five\nbrown and black people in there that was\nit and it was a free training session\non presenting and seeing if you had the\nskills to be in media\nand then i remember at the end of it\nsaying like oh you know like is there\nany opportunity where do we and they're\nlike no no there are no opportunities\nand i said what you called us all here\nto\nto train us to tell us they're no\nopportunities and they were like oh but\nyou can start a youtube channel\nand that's that's you know what you're\nsaying about social media is so true\nthat\nit was so hard to find an entry point\nwithout being able to create your own\ncommunity\nand and i think i love the way the\nworld's gone because now it's allowed\neach and every single one of us to\ncreate a community around what we care\nabout and that's what i wanted to ask\nyou that today you're a\nentrepreneur you're an actor you're a\nproducer you have your own production\ncompany\nhow do you define priyanka chopra\njonas's purpose\nthat kind of cascades into all those\nareas like\nlike what do you see as your purpose in\nthe work that you're doing because\nto me it seems it's always been driven\nby purpose\nit definitely has it's always to evolve\ni feel like my purpose is to find the\nnext\nthing that i can do the next new thing\nthe next um thing that i can push the\nenvelope on or the next thing where i\ncan push the goal post i want to do\nsomething\nyou know different that's not but i've\nalways been driven\nto you know and that doesn't mean every\nchoice is that but that's the eventual\nbig picture purpose you know to be able\nto sort of\ni've been given such an incredible\nopportunity\num from the beginning of my career\nyou know i it was i don't take that\nlightly\num to be there are so many people around\nthe world that are probably more\ntalented than me\nprobably more um deserving\nthan me but you know the sum of the\nopportunities i chose\nis the reason why i'm here today and i\ndon't take that for granted at all\num and that's my purpose is to make sure\nthat you know every single day spent\nwith a pursuit of excellence in um\nevery single choice that i make\nwhat are three truths that you live by\nif you had to define\nthree things that you always live by\nthat you don't negotiate with that you\nthat guide you that guide your decisions\nand guide your life when you're looking\nat those projects as you said you always\nwant to find that next thing that you're\ngoing to break through and that you\ndon't want to be scared of trying new\nthings\nwhat are some of those if it\nresonates with me like if i read\nsomething and i'm moved by\nlike the white tiger for example i'd\nread the book and\nit really like there you know some books\nyou just remember always because they\nwere such a vivid journey\nand the white tiger was one of those for\nme it was such a vivid\njourney and um i\nwhen i read that it was being adapted i\nchased it\ni went after it and i was like i need to\nbe i need to do this i need to be a part\nof it because\nit moved me it was a story that i feel\nlike\nneeds to be told is topical it's\nentertaining\num you know it's it's based on a\nuniversal theme\nof the haves and the have-nots you know\nthat exist everywhere\nso i think like that i feel is my\npurpose to be able to be moved\nby the things that i choose to align\nwith\nand i think also um\nfor it to be a growth for me you know\nfor it to be for it to be taking me to\nthe next step\ni don't like to stay in the same place\nfor a very long time\ndo the same kind of thing for a very\nlong time i want to go to the next thing\nwhat is what is better and our my job\nsort of lends me\nto be able to do that because it's very\ntransitory there's no\nyou know you don't know where your next\njob is or where your next check comes\nfrom or anything right\nso it allows me to pick and choose what\ni think is the\nnext step but those two things are very\nimportant i think those are great truths\nthose are great truths and i think uh\nthey come across in your book when you\nkind of see like how has this person had\nlike\n10 careers you know in a good way in in\nin a strong sense of\nbeing able to find that and and i wonder\nobviously you've played so many\nroles and studied so many characters in\nyour life\nwas writing this book almost like\nstudying your own self\nas a character in terms of like the role\nyou played\num so the reflection of this book is\nsort of me now\nyou know talking to my younger me\ngrowing up so i comment on myself and\nstuff i'm like\ncome on you know don't don't do note to\nself have a lot of notes to self\nin the book so sort of a commentary on\nthat but i think\ni wasn't examining myself as a character\nbecause\ni think i i was sort of going along\nwith my journey all over again i was\nexperiencing my journey all over again\ni didn't have to create anything i just\nhad to\nremember it as vividly as i could\num and i don't know i hope i got\neverything right i've tried to\nbut memory is a funny thing um and i've\nyou know\ni just i experienced it so it was almost\nlike you know when you're in a train and\nyou're looking outside and\nyou know the world is sort of moving by\nor in a car you're looking outside and\nthe world is moving by that's how i felt\nwhen i was writing the book yeah you\nshared this beautiful quote\nin chapter eight that really stuck with\nme i've never i've never read this one\nbefore and i\ni absolutely love discovering writers\nand thoughts so thank you for\nintroducing me to this\nit says it's it's from letters to a\nyoung poet\nand it says be patient toward all that\nis\nunsolved in your heart and try to love\nthe questions themselves\nlike locked rooms and like books that\nare written\nin a very foreign tongue and and i\nthought the selection of that\nthat quote it really spoke to me\nhow do you balance your drive and what's\nnext with that passion\nsorry with that patience and with that\napproach\nbecause often it can feel like you know\nit's like you're trying to find that\nnext thing trying to grow and evolve but\nbut you're also beautifully speaking\nabout patience\nwell i bifurcated i'm not patient in my\njob but i'm patient as a person\nand my job doesn't make me um it's not\ni'm\nmy job is not my whole you know um and\nthis is again\nsomething i didn't know earlier i've\ngrown into understanding this my younger\nself probably wouldn't\nmy 20s i didn't know this but um i've\nbifurcated very\nclearly you know my professional life is\nmy professional life my personal life is\nmy personal life\nthey meet in the middle sometimes\nbecause i'm a public person but\ni still have an immense part of me\nthat's\nnot for public consumption and it's not\num for anyone else but\nme so um that that side of me is patient\nthat side of me has become\nyou know um calmer um\na little bit more having um\nyou know stable maybe having my feet on\nthe ground a little bit\nbut my professional self is still in a\ntizzy i'm\nimpatient i want the next thing right\nnow i\nwake up in the morning thinking about my\nentire day and how i'm gonna achieve\nevery single thing at zero to sixty\num and that works for that girl\nit doesn't work for this girl and it\ntook a lot of introspection for me to\nget here actually\nin that chapter i actually talk about\nthat journey\nof getting to that place um because i\nwasn't there and\na lot of my professional attitude which\nwas you know\ni am going to do everything i can to\nmake this the best\ni took a lot of the onus of life upon\nmyself as well\nand it hurt me and it um\nand i didn't need to take the\nresponsibility of\nlife life happens and we've kind of got\nto navigate it every single day\nand you know live it for being\non the right side of the truth and being\na good person and you know having joy in\nthe day because\nlife is a gift and you know it needs to\nbe celebrated\nand so my my personal side of\nthat tree is real chill and\nloves life and um but the other girl\nshe's she's crazy\nthat's a fantastic distinction and and i\ni\ni love that i'm so glad that you shared\nthat with us that's such\na great way of of helping people\nunderstand how two\nseemingly opposite ideas can co-exist\nand i think we often feel like we have\nto choose like you're either driven\nor you're calm you're either ambitious\nor you're\nyou know conscious and aware and i've\ni'm so happy you said that\nbecause i i couldn't agree more right i\nthink it's\nfun letting two ideas collide and live\nwithin the same space and personally and\ni think it's natural as well\ndichotomies are the most consistent\nthings you'll see around nobody's one\nthing\nno emotion is a singular emotion you are\nat any given moment and that's an\nactor thing i guess\nwhen you're you're playing a character\nyou have to think about everything that\ncharacter is playing you can't just be\nlike oh this is an angry scene i'm going\nto just be angry and yell my eyes out\nyou know my uh whatever throat you're\nnot that's not a good actor you're not\neven scratching beneath the surface\nthe actor who thinks about oh my gosh\ni'm getting late or i have to have this\nconversation it's also cold and\ni'm i'm like mad about whatever last\nweek\nmy job i got fired you've got to think\nabout all of those elements\nso in the same way in life we never have\nto choose one\nthing so that we need to take that\npressure off of our backs\nthat you don't have to be on one\nsolitary journey\nyou can choose to be on any journey at\nany time you can choose to feel as long\nas you take the pressure we put too much\npressure on ourselves\nto function we create boxes and glass\nceilings for ourselves because we're\nlike\noh this is the only way i can be and\nthat's how you are successful\nthere's no black or white in the world\neveryone lives in greys\nyeah thank you so much for sharing that\npassionately i could feel you\nfeel your passion just like flying\nthrough the screen you're like everyone\nwho's listening and watching this\nis just you know straight it's beautiful\nit's it's fantastic we\nbreak you've been so kind with your and\ngenerous with your time we\nend every podcast with two segments\nthese segments are called\nfill in the blank and the fast five uh\nthe fill in the blank\nis a fill in the blank round uh very\naware and then\ni'll introduce the first five later so\nif you're ready this is your fill in the\nblank okay\nokay so the hardest part about my job\nis the hours\num and um\nthe well fill in the blank the blank is\nbasically i have to explain that because\num you know\nmy job can come up at any time on any\nday it doesn't matter if it's someone's\nbirthday it doesn't\nmatter if it is you know my anniversary\nit doesn't matter if like\ni am um i don't know going to a friend's\nwedding if the job comes up you've got\nto kind of deliver\nthat's the hardest part really yeah and\ni want to be honest and let everyone\nknow right now it's 7 00 p.m where\npriyanka is\nit's 11 a.m where i am so she's still\nhere kindly doing this interview so just\njust to be really honest about about the\nhours and and and\ni'm gonna be doing it until 1am yeah i\nbelieve you i believe you\nuh okay next one 2020 gave me a new\nperspective\non um\ncreativity\nbecause i'm i gave me a sense of balance\ni\nbecame a lot more creative i think\nyeah that makes sense that stillness\nthat clarity that\nslow down for once the um luxury of time\nwhich i never have yeah um and i've\nnever chosen\nthis forced this forced time was very\nhelpful\nyeah i love that my power comes from\nmy family working hard makes me feel\nfulfilled storytelling is\na joy and my dogs are\nmy world\n[Music]\n[Laughter]\ni love it okay this is your final five\nso questions can be one word\nto one sentence maximum you you did\nextremely well on the\nfill in the blank uh so these are one\nword to one sentence maximum okay\nuh who do you go to for their opinion\nabout your work\n[Laughter]\ngreat answer i love it i love it it's a\ngreat answer\ni let the people decide\n[Laughter]\nyou know one of my favorite things about\nyou over the years\nis just how straight talking you are and\nand uh\nand obviously my intention has has only\nbeen positive towards you but\ni've loved watching your interviews\nwhere\nsomeone asks tries to ask just an\nawkward irrelevant question\nand and you always just give them the\nbest answer like you\nyeah it's just it's so fun to watch it's\nso fun\nthank you i haven't i haven't been able\nto be on the other end of it thankfully\nbut\nuh it's great it's great okay uh what's\nthe best piece of advice you ever\nreceived\nto have courage of conviction um\nmy mom said that to me when i was very\nyoung\nshe said if you're gonna tell the truth\nor if you're gonna tell a lie just know\nthat\num you know whatever you do you have to\nstand by it the good the bad\nugly it's all yours wonderful\nuh what's the worst advice you've ever\nreceived\ni don't retain bad advice\ngreat answer that's that's a great\nanswer it's awesome yeah\nyeah that makes perfect sense why would\nyou i don't have the\nplace in my brain for it there's too\nmany other things floating around\ni love it uh question number four what's\nsomething that you know to be\ntrue for you but that other people may\ndisagree on\nso something that you're confident is\ntrue but other people may not\nunderstand it fully um that i'm actually\nlike you a monk people won't\nbelieve it because most people even my\nclosest family would be like\nyou no because i'm always like in a\ntizzy\nbut i'm actually inherently a monk\nrather close close to monk not really\nactually i love it\nno i love it that's great i i that that\nwas the whole reason why i was\nencouraging people to have a monk\nmindset that anyone in the world can\ncan have that so i i love hearing that's\nthat's beautiful you don't have to\nyou don't have to live like a monk to\nthink like a monk so i'm glad totally\nthat's great okay fifth and final\nquestion uh if you could make\none law in the world that everyone had\nto follow\nwhat would it be no one goes hungry\nis my law that's it it's the\nworst thing to see um\nyeah if we could change just that it\nwould really change a lot of\nthings that's such a great law we've\nnever had anyone say that before so i'm\nreally\ni'm really happy you shared that and uh\ni i couldn't agree more\nas a monk we worked on several food\ndistribution programs in india where i\nwas and\nit was it was so meaningful to see but\nthere's so much work that needs to be\ndone in that space\nall across all over the world oh my gosh\neverywhere\num that's like such a basic\nright and need for a human being to just\nlive and you know i've done obviously\ncoming from\nhaving grown up in india but also i've\nworked with\nkids around the world with unicef\nand\nit's just it's like that's got to change\na hungry child\nis it's\njust it's not right it's not natural\nyou know yeah and and yeah and and it's\nlike you know we talk about as we were\ntalking about the dreams and the\nambitions but it all starts with\nfood and water and you know it starts\nwith those basic necessities to help\nthat person so that's that's a beautiful\nand we also as privileged society have\nbecome very desensitized to it you know\nyeah drive past homeless shelter you're\nnot thinking about it\nand i'm not saying that you know each\nperson needs to empty their wallets and\nlike make a difference to the world\ni think yes it is the responsibility of\nthe large earners definitely\nof you know the billionaires of the\nworld um\nbecause in a big way but i think\nalso the responsibility of each one of\nus to just do\nwhatever we can you know and that\ndoesn't have to be large\nit could be just kindness compassion\nchange someone's life just look around\nyou your neighborhood\njust that that itself will be helpful\nyou know my i was as a kid my mom told\nme\nno matter how badly off you are\nhow bad your circumstances are someone's\nworse off than you\nand that's just the truth of the world\nyeah i love how much you remember and\nquote your parents it's such a beautiful\nthing because it\nit shows you the power of good parenting\nand uh\nfrom a young age because it's it's such\na special thing so\nthey also repeated themselves a lot\nthat's brilliant\n[Laughter]\ni love that they just kept saying the\nsame thing every birthday\nevery big day i was like all right i get\nit\nwell the repetition worked it worked\nyeah i wrote a book about them\nso yeah i love it yeah the repetition\nworks so much that\nif you want to be parented by prion\ncontrover jonas's parents
