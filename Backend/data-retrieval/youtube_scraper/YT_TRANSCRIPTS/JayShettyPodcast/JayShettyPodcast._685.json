here\nabsolutely and i love that energy man\nbecause i think you're so right that so\nmany of us today are so stuck\nand a lot of the time we've tried\neverything or i hear that a lot\nof people are like i've tried everything\nlike i've been to my doctor i've been to\nthis person like\ni tried my weird thing that my aunt\ncomes up with like you know i've tried\nall of these things and the thing is\nit's not like those are bad those are\nall good things because everybody's got\na piece of the puzzle\nyou got the best doctors out there you\ngot functional medicine doctors you got\nalternative guys you got conventional\nguys\ngirls all of them they're all working\nhard on their patients and people people\nhave compassion doctors are the most\nincredible people\nthe compassion to wake up in the morning\ngo to the office and work on person\nafter person after person like they do\nand hear their stories and hear their\ncries doctors are unbelievable and the\ntool there's a lot of good tools out\nthere right\nbut what happens is there's some things\npeople don't even know about yet\nthat that plug into what they're doing\nsay they're doing a keto diet or\nsay they're doing a paleo diet say\nthey're doing a vegan diet say they're\ndoing a plant-based diet\nand they're not getting all the results\nthey need and they're all confused and\neverybody's flip-flopping\nfrom vegan to paleo to paleo to vegan\nand everybody is all upset but when you\nplug in something like the celery juice\nand you know how to use it\nyou can move forward wherever you are\nyou can plug this\ninto what you're doing it's tools like\nthat that literally\nmove the needle and change the lives of\nmillions and right now\nhundreds of millions are drinking celery\njuice it's the most powerful healing\nmovement of our time\nand day and i want everybody to actually\nbe part of it\nbecause why miss out what are you gonna\ndo you're not gonna do it you're not\ngonna partake in something that could\nchange your life\nso i want everybody to know this isn't\none of those scams or\nfarces this is that powerful when you\nuse this herbal medicine\nsomething changes inside of us i love\nthat and i can't wait to uncover that\nwith you\nin this podcast and in the life that\nwe're about to do i can't wait to get\ninto all the details\nbut i want to take it backwards slightly\nsure because i want people to understand\nwhere you're coming from\nabsolutely and and i want people to\nunderstand your background your journey\nand just behind the mind you know inside\nthe mind of anthony\nso i want to go back to you being four\nyears old yeah and you're four years old\nand you literally without any help any\nsupport whatever it is\nyou literally let your grandmother know\nshe's\nshe had lung cancer she had lung cancer\nyeah she was symptom-free like no one\nknew\nthat yeah not at all no and then they\nchecked yeah and you were spot-on yeah\nwoke up one morning\nand heard a voice perfectly clear you\nknow people say wait a minute how does\nhe get this advanced\nmedical information that's decades ahead\nof research and science you know i know\nscientists\ni know i know incredible doctors lab\ntechnicians and they say his information\nis advanced whether anybody likes it or\nnot whether the source he hears it from\nyou don't agree with or you're not happy\nabout this voice he hears that he heard\nat four years old that\ndiagnosed his grandmother or lung cancer\nand from there on this is all he's ever\ndone\nand people are like hey you know what i\ndon't know do i trust this and i totally\nunderstand\ni totally get it a guy that hears a\nvoice when you really know the origin of\nit\nyou know it's hard but when lab\ntechnicians and scientists and\ndoctors that are elevated in the field\nof medicine say his advanced information\nlike epstein-barr causing hashimoto's\nthyroiditis he was the first to actually\nbring that out before they even knew\nthat's what was happening\nand when they say hey he's advanced with\nthis information and\nit's about getting people better we got\nto kick back a little bit\nwe got to calm down and say okay let's\nlisten to this because this is different\nthis is actually really helping people\nand at four years old that's what\nhappened it was information coming\nthrough perfectly clear i\nheard it straight in a voice right to me\nand it's i've been using that ever since\nnot just my grandmother with that\nwhat happened was in 1975 in the fall of\n1975\nhad another family member with a back\nproblem a back problem that\nwouldn't it wouldn't ease off the\ndoctors didn't know what was really\ncausing the back problem it wasn't an\ninjury it was an inflammatory condition\na mystery back injury or a mystery back\ninflamed\nproblem where they're suffering they\ncouldn't walk right\nin late 1975 spirit which i call spirit\nthe voice said\ncelery juice this is when it started\ncelery juice\nfor this family member we didn't have\nreally any kind of juicer\nlook look what year it is look what's\ngoing on we weren't prepared\nthey had the blender the beat up old\nblender we ground up that celery\nright and we strained it with a\ncheesecloth\nand we just strained it out and and a\nfamily member was\na skeptic about celery juice well what\ndo you mean celery juice\ndrank it and started recovering that\nnight slowly recovering and then\nthe end of the week out of the woods\nwith his back problem\nwalking and it's that kind of thing\nright there and yes the voice\ntells me what to do so that's what i've\ndone dedicated my life helping people\nbut giving them\ninformation that even doctors want to\nknow\nthere are thousands of doctors in the\nthis country alone with the medical\nmedium series books in their offices\npatients have brought them in and they\nand the doctors are they're smart\nthey read it and say wait a minute this\nis different\nwhoa wait he's talking about viruses\nhe's talking about pathogens\nhe's talking about things we don't know\nabout viruses and pathogens that's not\nanywhere\nand also what to do which is one of the\ntools the celery juice what i'm more\ninterested in because\ni've seen all of that research i've seen\npeople say of all of your incredible\nbackground and the studies and the\nresearch and the fact that it's worked\nfor people\nhow did you start to trust that voice\nbecause i almost feel like that's\nsometimes harder it's like trusting your\nown trusting a voice that's coming\nthrough\nhow is that process for you you know\nwhat it is is when you when you see it\nworking\nin front of your own eyes you know when\ni was 13 years old and a stock boy in a\nlittle grocery store\nand that voice is telling me you know\nwhy someone has diabetes or what's going\non or what's\nhappening with them or or the brain\ntumor that they have or something that's\ngoing on\nand the voice is telling me what's\nhappening inside their bodies and what\nthey\nneed you just you just it you can't\navoid it you can't ignore it it's not\none of those things you should say well\ni don't i don't want to do this anymore\nyou know it's not what you're you're in\nit and you just you go with it and you\nkeep on working\nyou know forward to help people and\nchange and change your lives it's so\ncritical\nabsolutely so how let's get on to the\ncelery juice how did you start\ndiscovering\nthe secret behind this herb like how did\nyou start seeing that it had such a\npowerful effect like how did you first\nuncover\nbecause i think there are just so many\nvegetables out there you can make so\nmany juices\nyeah yeah people have drank probably the\nwrong juices for such a long time yeah\nbut then\nwhere did it start all juices are great\nthat's the thing all juices are great\nthey offer benefits and and a lot of\npeople they get confused they say well\nwhy would celery juice by itself do\nanything for you\nand one of the reasons is it's an herb\nit's not a vegetable\nit's an actual herb and herbal medicine\nis powerful i mean if anybody's\nlistening out here do you like herbs on\nany level\nwhat herbs are your favorite there's so\nmany people that are into any kind\nthey're into herbs that's the whole\nthing you got chinese medicine you've\ngot ayurvedic you've got all this herbs\nare powerful\nand there's herbalists out there there's\ndoctors out there natural doctors\nyou know and and herbs are a big part of\nour lives well why do they do things for\nus\nbecause they're very healing well celery\nhas been\nit's it no one knew and that's the thing\ni mean even when i heard it from the\nvoice originally\nperfectly clear seller juice the celery\nit's an\nherb i was even like wait a minute no\nit's a celery stick what do you mean\nthis is this is a a vegetable that\nno one cares about and never really\ncared about and spirits like it's not a\nvegetable it's an\nherb it's herbal medicine you extract it\nin a large\nquantity and when you do that that's\nwhen the miracles happen\nand then you know someone might say wait\na minute you know you have to leave the\nfiber you have to leave the pulp\njuicing's not good you're leaving like\nnutrition behind\nthe fiber and the pulp but what they\ndon't understand is\nchamomile tea right do you eat the tea\nbag after you've like had can you go out\nwith a friend right\ndo you cut open that tea bag and say\nwait a minute i got to get this fiber\ni got to get this pulp here because\nthat's where the nutrition is no the\nmedicine\ncomes from the chamomile and that's what\nyou're getting that medicine to relax\nyou to calm you the things that people\nlike\nsame thing with other herbs and herbal\nteas and so forth of course you can eat\nsome of the herbs\nbut they're better extracted the\nmedicine\nso it's the power of that this is an\nherbal tonic and herbal elixir\nand what you'll see out there is\ndietitians who are amazing people are\nnutritionists who are amazing people\nwhat they'll do is they'll be confused\nand be like no no no leave the pulp and\nfiber\nanthony william doesn't know what he's\ntalking about you don't you don't want\nto just have that and they don't know\nthis is herbal medicine you're\nextracting a large\nquantity of this incredible mysterious\ntonic why is it mysterious science and\nresearch hasn't looked into what is in\ncelery yet barely any information\nout there another reason why people\ndon't know but we're getting there\nwe're actually getting there we are\ngetting there and and you're leading\nthat movement which i absolutely love\nlike it's incredible like you're really\npushing that out there and i think it's\nso important that we do live in a time\nwhere\nwe are allowing unique voices to come to\nthe fore\nyeah you know maybe in 1975 and years\nafter that people would have been close\nto these things\nbut now people are seeing also the lack\nof certain research in certain studies\nand recognizing that there are\nalternatives tell me\nwhen you started uncovering celery juice\nwhat are the key issues that you're\nseeing celery juice benefit what are the\nkey challenges\nthat people are experiencing autoimmune\ni know there's a big list oh my god\nbig big list big list people dealing\nwith chronic illness when i call chronic\nillness symptoms\nthat won't alleviate or come constantly\nor on and off intermittently but they\ndon't go away technically\nwhat could that be chronic fatigue\nsyndrome me chronic fatigue syndrome\nright\nlyme disease uh multiple sclerosis um\nhashimoto's thyroiditis lupus these are\njust some things eczema and psoriasis\nrosacea different conditions people\nsuffer from and all this acne\nthere's sibo all of these things you\ncould just keep on going on\nthings that people are plagued with you\nknow and the fatigue is one of them\nthat's a big one when moms can't get out\nand they can't get out of the house\nand and run the house and run their\ncareers and take care of their children\nbecause they\ncan barely function because of severe\nbrain fog chronic fatigue syndrome\nand and not have real answers and the\nfibromyalgia and the rheumatoid\narthritis and all these things people\nsuffer with\nthese are the things celery juice starts\nto move the needle with\nit's these these things it's different\nwhen someone's exercising every day two\nhours a day they feel good they're young\nthey're strong in the moment they\nhaven't gotten sick yet in their lives\nthey haven't been there and they're\ntrying celery juice for a week and\nthey're like i'm not sure what i'm\nnoticing i think there might have been\nenergy i don't know\nbut then you take someone who's been to\n50 doctors\nokay been through hell and back\nstruggled suffered been told they're\ncrazy\nokay or given three four different\ndiagnoses and then you take somebody\nlike that\nand they've tried everything they've\nbeen on every diet they've been to every\nfunctional medicine doctor they've been\nto every single conventional doctor\neverybody they can\nunder the sun and then they try celery\njuice for two weeks three weeks for two\nmonths for\n30 days for anything for five days and\nthey're like oh my god\ni'm getting relief for the first time\nand i've tried everything i have 50\nsupplements piled up in my house\nin my cupboards i got all this food i\nbuy every day from all these different\ndiet plans i talk to all these different\ndoctors i'm online looking for\ninformation\nand celery juice is moving the needle\nand it's getting me better\nand that's why it's here there's\nsomething really\nimportant to understand here health\ntrends are not propelled like this this\nis propelled\nbecause people are actually healing\nthat's the difference\nthis is this is an organic movement this\nis a trend\nor something more powerful above a trend\nand people don't realize this yet nay's\ntruth naysayers\nare too late for the party they can\ncomplain and cry and say oh there's no\nscience behind it i think\nwell what what else in in there's so\nmany things there's no someone said\nrecently\noh forget celery juice you have to eat\nall the rainbow of the colors where's\nthe science proving that if you eat\nevery rainbow in the color that you're\ngoing to be\nyou're going to fix your chronic illness\nwhere's that science\nthere's no science on that about what\nsomeone actually healing a chronic\nillness moving forward because they're\neating all the rainbows and the colors\nof course you want all the colors in the\nfoods and you want all the different\nfoods\ni never said you you know that would be\nbad or good or not\ni said that's great but celery juice is\na medicine that you can bring\ninto everything you're doing and it's\nreally changing\nlives it's it's incredible i know i keep\non saying that it's only because\nit's only because it actually is working\nother health trends are propelled by\nother things there's\ntremendous monetary behind it like\nmonetary involvement pushing that trend\nso you take all that\ncollagen of course so you take all of\nthat whatever it is so you take all that\napple cider vinegar so you take it all\nthere's there's\nmoney which hey that's just how the\nworld works we know that and there's\nmoney propelling that\nwell you're the only thing propelling\ncelery juice\nis millions of people getting benefits\nand telling their story without being\nprompted or\npaid to do it it's never happened in\nhistory before\nand if you don't like that idea i don't\nknow what to tell you if you don't like\nthe idea of there's no science behind\ncelery juice yet\nyou know what tell people tell that to\nsomeone who\nsuffered and struggled pushed through\ntheir day\nand they and they realized see when you\nget sick\nyou realize science and research doesn't\nhave answers for chronic illness\nsure there's life-saving medicine out\nthere sure if you get into a car\naccident there's life-saving medicine i\nknow incredible er\ndoctors i know amazing surgeons actually\nthat do procedures that save our lives\nin different all kinds of different\nproblems we have but\nlet me tell you this right here jay okay\nwhen you're sick\nand you're struggling and you're\nsuffering and you've been to 20 doctors\nokay you realize fast science and\nresearch dropped the ball somewhere\nwhere maybe people don't know but they\ndropped it and they dropped it hard\nbecause people have they people have\nbeen suffering and struggling\nthere's over 250 million americans in\nthe u.s that have a symptom that won't\ngo away\ngetting worse and that's where we're\nheading we're heading into the land\nof the lost getting worse with chronic\nillness and so you've\nquickly learned especially young you're\n20 years old 22 years old you get sick\nyou're 25 years old you get sick you\nquickly learn\nright there science and research isn't\nwhat everybody was saying it is when it\ncomes down to wait i got lyme disease\nwhat do you mean\nis it getting better it's not i'm trying\nthis i'm trying antibiotics wait now i\nhave multiple sclerosis\nor what is this symptom anxiety it's\ncrippling depression\nand you realize science of research\ndoesn't know anything about these things\nso then where are we then someone said\nto me jay they said there's no science\nof research to your information there's\nno signs of research to celery juice\nand i'm like oh i didn't know science\nand research fixed every chronic ill\nperson i didn't know we have nobody\nsuffering i didn't know no one was sick\nand going to 50 doctors\nand that's the world today celery juice\nis this barrier breaker\nit's like okay get ready because this is\none of the most powerful tools that's\ngoing to move you forward yeah i love\nthat\nand i agree with you like i think\neverything you've just stated there i\nagree with the fact that\nscience and research is measuring that\nwhich has happened yeah right\nit's rarely we call it breakthrough\nscience but it's not breakthrough\nbecause it has to watch something for\na significant amount of time or years\nyou know what i mean like where is\nthese ideas or these unique things that\ncome out they get tested over time\nyeah it's never you can't test something\nin two seconds and talk about it yeah\nand science and research is amazing we\nneed it i'm all for it in fact some\nincredible things do happen from it\nbut they're usually theories that have\nto be proven somehow\ncorrect right and then you have the\ninvestors behind it to prove it\nand then in the end you don't know what\nyou have because it changes 10 years\nlater\nwhere all of a sudden wait we were wrong\nnow we have a whole bunch of things\nwe're saying now this it's this way\nand that's happened so many times it's\nreally difficult for people you know\nit's incredible i mean at the same\nlevel i've seen people say why drink\ncelery juice you're better off just\nputting a little bit of sea salt or a\nlittle bit of himalayan\nrock salt right in your water and it'll\ndo better because\nbecause research in science doesn't know\nanything about celery juice research and\nscience doesn't know anything about\nputting himalayan sea salt\nin your water and then that's in the\nsame breath they'll say something\nresearch and science hasn't even studied\nyet either and they'll say well\nmake sure you do this put salt in your\nwater it's going to help you so much\nbetter than celery juice because there's\nno signs behind celery juice\nit's almost like do you know what you\njust said is incredible\nso well i didn't know there was so much\nhate for celery juice well you know you\nknow what it is is that\nyou people got a lot of time on their\nhands you're gonna be like hating on\ncelery juice it doesn't sound like the\nworst thing to hate when you have\nsomething this powerful\nyeah and moving forward to this degree\nand this fast\nyou got all the stores selling out with\ntheir celery it's all it's all going you\ngot farms scrambling\nto actually grow it as fast as they can\nand then and get\nland up and grow it and grow you know\nfarms don't make any money i mean\nthey're all subsidized most of them you\nknow how they struggle as it is\nwhen you see all that people start\ngetting this they're getting nervous\nand then when celery juice is helping\nmillions of people really fast it i\nthink it's a threat\nin many ways to so many industries so\nyeah no there's\nlove for celery juice tons of love out\nthere but also you got the people saying\nhey wait a minute\nleave your fiber and pulp in there no\nleave your fiber and pulp and all the\nother vegetables and stuff\nuse it but this extract it like a\nmedicine\nright tell me about some of the stories\nthat you've seen in your life of\npeople's transformations\nwhether it was from a chronic illness\njust tell me a couple of one or two\nstories or\nexamples where you've really seen people\nwho've\ntransformed through celery juice\ndebilitating eczema\ndebilitating psoriasis where people\nsuffer they can't get they can't wear\nclothes\nthey can't leave the house because they\ncan't put clothing on their skin\nand they're just doing the steroids\nthey've tried the steroids they've tried\ndifferent things they've seen so many\ndoctors they\nsuffer their skin's cracking and\nbleeding everywhere\nand celery juice brought into their\ntheir lives and used correctly like i\ntalked about in the celery juice book\nand it it it gets them to clear it up\nthey start to see\nbenefits i mean miraculous cases\nreversed\nit's it's incredible i'm not just\ntalking about it got a little bit better\ni know many cases many of them over the\nyears\nand now today where they get rid of that\ndebilitating eczema\nwhere they were crying they cried they\nhad to be on painkillers they couldn't\neven move their arms and legs\nand they got through it on the other\nside of it\nalso debilitating chronic fatigue\nsyndrome fibromyalgia\nmultiple sclerosis getting people\nforward with that people with lyme\ndisease celery juice is all of a sudden\nthe very thing\nthat's now changing everything with\ntheir diagnosis that they've got or\nno diagnosis where doctors are confused\nand they're just sick and they're home\nand they got high anxiety and depression\ni've seen this celery juice do something\nfor these people\nbut for decades i've seen it before it\nexploded before the publication of the\nmedical medium series books in 2015\nyou know it was already building it was\na quiet storm\ni think it snuck up on everybody it\nsnuck up on the world i think this\nhealth trend\nor whatever we want to call it now has\nsnuck up\nin a way and became a tidal wave just\nlast year it finally became this big\ntidal wave and i always say to people\nyou know what if you learn about it now\nand you know it's it's important so\nyeah and i also think that it's a tidal\nwave for those who are really looking\nand then there is a lot of us who are\ninterested but we don't find out until\nsomeone brings it to\nthe front of our minds the front of eyes\nyou know what i mean it's like until\nsomeone really\nbreaks it down for you like you have in\nthis book like until someone really\nexplains you the process\nof why it works how to take it yeah like\nyou've done in this book like i feel\nlike\neven then if that doesn't happen a lot\nof these trends just go over our heads\nabsolutely right and for most people\nbecause these trends feel like\nit's still too hard yeah or it's like a\nshort-term thing like oh i'm gonna watch\nsome i watch the video i'm gonna try it\nfor a week\nyeah but i don't have a process yeah\ntell us about the process that you\noutlined in this book and how you've\nmade it so simple you know there's\nthere's there's over 100 questions\nalways asked how do i drink celery juice\nwhat do i do do i do i put\nmy blender with my other food it's all\nthat it has to be\nby itself it has to be by itself in a\ncertain amount\n16 ounces is where you want to be to\nstart with it's 16 ounces of it\njuiced fresh very fresh very important\nso you could juice it at home fresh okay\nyou can go to a juice place\ni i do recommend don't do the hpp\nthing which is high pressure\npasteurization i mean there's nothing\nwrong with hpp\ni mean you can do other juices that are\nhpp you go into health food stores\ngrocery stores you see all those drinks\nthey look like they're really fresh they\nlook like they were just done yesterday\nbut they got a date on them for a couple\nweeks because it's high pressure\npasteurization\nnow i noticed that that's happening with\ncelery juice don't get confused by that\ndon't pick that one because if you pick\nthat one it's going to be hindered it's\ngoing to lose\nits its healing benefits it's potency\nexactly\nyou want to juice fresh go to your juice\nbars go to health food stores that will\njuice it right in front of you\nmake sure it's done right there do it at\nhome and that's where the magic\nhappens so there is going to be there\nthere is a confusion developing where\nyou know you get the bottled celery\njuice now sitting on there and people\nlike well that must be as good as\neverything else and if they're not\nexperiencing the benefits they\nthey need from drinking it then they get\nthey get thwarted by it they get pushed\noff by it yeah so\nyeah that's just one example i answer\nlots of questions can you do while\nyou're pregnant yeah you can do celery\njuice can you do it while you're\nbreastfeeding yes\nso there's just so many questions these\nare just a few\nyeah and it has to be consumed straight\nafter it can't be that's why you want to\nyou can wait a little bit you can wait\nhours later you can even wait a day\nlater have it in the fridge have it in\nthe fridge but and that will still be\nbetter than say something like\nin the store at high pressure pass ratio\nyou know and there with a shelf with a\nlong shelf but ideally straight away\nyeah ideally that's gonna have the most\npotency yeah and\ntalk about what's in it that hasn't been\ndiscovered yet and if someone says well\nhow would he\nknow this voice he hears how would i\nknow epstein-barr\nwas the cause of thyroid problems and i\nwas the guy\nlong before talking about it everywhere\ntalking about it the doctors talking\nabout\nthem publishing and everything else and\nand and\nnow they're saying hey science and\nresearch just found there's a link to\nepstein-barr to\nthyroid disease thyroid disorders same\nthing with the celery juice\nyes i hear the information i know what's\nin it there's something called sodium\ncluster salts\nthat's the antiviral that's the that's\nthe po\nthat's the phytochemical compound it's\nthis\nsodium cluster salt somebody might say\nwell what is that it's a subgroup of\nsodium\nundiscovered by research and science you\nthink that we only have\none type of sodium that's it on the\nplanet and that's it\nno there's more than that it's a\nsubgroup it's a different thing going on\nin celery it's not in anything else\nthey're gonna find it down the road they\nprobably won't call it sodium cluster\nsalts they're not going to give me that\ncredit they're probably not going to pat\nme on the back\nand be like yeah you're they're going to\nname it something else obviously\nbut that's what it is it kills bugs\nhere's the deal i'll just simplify it\npeople are sick because they got bugs\nthat's it your your hashimoto's\nthyroiditis your rheumatoid arthritis\nbugs cause this it's not your body\nattacking itself it's bugs it's\npathogens\nit's viruses it's bacteria so when\npeople have their fibro\nthere's a bug involved that's what this\nis chronic fatigue syndrome there's a\nbug\nso what's going on is we're filled with\nbugs i know that's kind of annoying\nwe've got viruses like epstein-barr\nwe've got the simplexes in us wreaking\nhavoc we got\nthe hh v6s we have shingles viruses we\nhave bacteria\nand people have these bugs in them we\nlive with them\nthey create inflammation meanwhile\nthe food wars that are going on the\nvegans against the paleos and\nand the keto and everything else and\neverybody's fighting each other but\nnobody realizes you guys are all\ndealing with epstein bars dealing with\nstreptococcus you're dealing with strep\nand and different viruses and the reason\nwhy celery juice is working is because\nthe sodium cluster salts and celery\njuice is annihilating a lot of bugs in\npeople\nit's breaking it down it's killing them\nit's cleaning up their livers it's\ngetting the bugs out of the livers and\nthat's why their inflammation is\nactually getting better and better\nwow amazing and and i was looking at\nsomething you were saying about how\nit's blocked it's also stopping the\nvicious cycle of addiction\nyeah which is incredible how does that\nwork well yeah that seems like a totally\ndifferent challenge in in my head at\nleast\nlike from an uninformed point of view so\nhow is celery juice even helping people\nwith addiction well you know what it\nrevives your liver\nit starts restoring your liver can\nactually hold more what's called\nglycogen\nglucose because that's what it needs to\ndo it needs to store\nglucose and glycogen the very thing that\nwe it's the very thing that\nruns our blood sugar throughout our body\nwhen our blood sugar is\nunstable and it's imbalanced we tend to\nfall prey to addiction\nreally easy plus electrolytes we all\nlack electrolytes so when you eat a food\nof any kind or you drink water you get\nsome electrolytes naturally occurring\nany kind of food you eat there's a\nnatural occurring electrolyte going on\nthere right\nwell those are pieces you're collecting\nall day long what did you have for\nbreakfast\nthere's some electrolytes in it what did\nyou have for lunch there's a few more\nelectrolytes in it\nand then dinner a few more or during the\nday there's electrolytes in things we're\nconsuming\nbut we're never getting enough at once\nwe're never getting the whole\nelectrolyte the whole electrolyte family\nat once\nright on the neurons right with the\nneurotransmitter chemicals using them\nright all of this happening\ncelery juice is like a complete\nelectrolyte still undiscovered by\nresearch\nand science of course research knows\nthat there's antioxidants in celery\njuice of course they know there's\nvitamin a and k in there\nit's funny and i've heard somebody say\nmaybe people are getting better because\nthe vitamin\na and k and i'm like what about the\nvitamin a and k that's in every other\nfruit and vegetable what about\nall of that plus all the supplements\npeople are you're still not moving\nforward why is this doing it\ndoes it have a different vitamin a and k\nwhat it does have though is has a\nfull complete electrolyte it goes to the\nbrain fast and easy\nclings onto the neurons revives tire\ndehydrated neurotransmitter chemicals\nstarts to actually bring those back so\nyour electrical impulses fire\nfast so you could be quick talking so\nyou can actually hear you can actually\nthink what you're saying it all comes\nthe brain fog goes away everything\nstarts clearing up\nand those when those electrolytes hit\nthose neurons\nand spark that fire and those electrical\nimpulses are cruising through those\nneurons\nand that is precious that is like\ngold right there and that's another\nreason why addiction could stop so you\nwant to bring it back to addiction when\nthose electrolytes are hitting\nall those neurons your electrical\nimpulses are firing and running through\nthose neurons\nand all that's happening and you're\nstarting to think clear and your brain\nfog's back and down\nyou you don't fall prey to addiction\nright there that alone\nthere's the blood sugar starts to\nbalance out because your liver is\nhealing and getting better\nyour glucose reserves in your in your in\nyour liver are storing\nback up so it can control part of the\nblood sugar problem that we deal with\nbecause it's not just the pancreas and\nwhen all that's happening you get\nstronger your mind gets stronger your\ncontrol gets stronger you get\nyou know what you take control over your\nlife\nand that's with celery juice if you want\none simple thing for me right there\nyou know what use celery juice to help\ntake control over your life\nabsolutely because it can it can be one\nof those tools i'm not saying it fixes\neverything and anything in one shot i'm\nnot saying\nthis is literally the miracle that will\nfix it all\nno because everybody else is doing good\nthings this is that thing that pushes it\nover the edge absolutely to where you\nneed to go and that's what i mean your\nenergy and your\nyour love for celery juice is infectious\nand contagious i don't know anyone in\nthis room right now who is not\ndedicated to at least testing it which\nis awesome but but\ntell me about some of the lifestyle and\ndiet habits that\ncan cause a conflict or negate the\namazing benefits of celery juice what is\nit that we're doing in our lifestyle or\nour diet\nthat could slow down or go against the\nbenefits of celery\nall right i'll tell you right now look i\nknow this is going to get everybody\nupset\nokay in the audience but probably not\neverybody but most everybody\nif you if there's something to take out\nof your diet wherever you stand whatever\nidle you're on whatever diet\nbelief system you are that you're that\nyou're involved with subscribe to\nwhatever it is\nyou take you need to take eggs out so\nchicken eggs have to come out of your\ndiet\nnow i hate to be the breaker of this\nnews or the person that has to break\nthis news to everybody\nbut what i want to tell you is the most\nimportant part\nthe most important part of this podcast\nprobably for anybody to take in\nis we live with these bugs inside of us\nthat create all of our illnesses\nwhether it's not happening now say we're\nyounger but it'll happen\nlater when we're turning 40. it'll\nhappen later when we're 45\nit'll have whatever it is we have these\nbugs in us like the viruses\nand the bacteria the pathogens that are\nin us eggs\nfeed the pathogens bottom line no matter\nwhat you believe in out there whatever\ndiet system whatever you believe in\nprotein and macros whatever you're\ntalking about in your life that you\nbelieve in whether you're trainers\nwhether you're nutritionists whether\nyou're doctors\nwhatever it is just know that when you\neat the eggs\nit feeds the pathogens and i hate to\nbreak it to everybody but pathogens come\nfrom sources they come from places\nthey come from petri dishes they come\nfrom labs a long time ago\nand you know how they were raised they\nwere raised by being fed food one of the\nfoods that fed them\nwas chicken eggs we eat the eggs we feed\nour viruses\nand we get sicker slowly over time\ncelery juice is getting you better\nit's killing pathogens but if you keep\non feeding your pathogens\nthen it's kind of working against you\nright so that's a powerful tool right\nthat's it crazy i mean i haven't eaten\neggs for 16 years but i\nhad no idea that i've never heard anyone\nraise that about eggs before yeah well\nit's information you're not going to\nhear anywhere else and that's that's why\npeople heal with medical medium\ninformation is because it's finally new\ninformation\ninformation that is different that no\none even knew or thought about\nor understood and that's one of them\nright there\nsame thing with the gluten the gluten\nthe gluten everybody thought gluten was\njust inflammatory\nnobody knew gluten actually is\ninflammatory because it feeds\nthe bugs too oh wow i brought that to\ntown\nso whether anybody likes it or not i\nbrought that and they may say hey well\nhe hears a voice so i don't want that\ninformation\nbut no guess what they'll find that out\npretty soon i think even more people are\ntalking about i think doctors are\ntalking about it now because i've been\nputting it out there for so many years\nthe reason why people get sick on gluten\nand then someone else doesn't get sick\non gluten because you\nrealize you can be 90 years old eating\ngluten all your whole life\nyou could be like 50 years old you\nyou've eaten it your whole life you've\nnever had a problem with gluten\nand then someone can't even eat it at 16\n18\n25 yeah and they have to take it out\nbecause they have certain pathogens\ninside their body they're feeding off of\ngluten itself and then creating\ninflammation it's not the gluten\ncreating it\nso that's why that should be out too you\nknow you should get that out too but\nthere's a reason you should get gluten\nout it's not like oh well he's just\nsaying no gluten because everybody says\nthat no\nthere's a reason i know that reason\nlearn about it it'll help you absolutely\namazing and are there any other\nlifestyle\nhabits that uh could work against this\nit could work against\npeople absolutely what i mean absolutely\ni'm not seeing the benefits\nabsolutely it could be you could be\ntotally doing something else incredible\nincredible no\nan amazing question thank you for asking\nso here's what you got to be concerned\nabout when you're using\ncelery juice to not bombard your celery\njuice with food too close to it\nif you're drinking your celery juice and\nit's not in an empty stomach you're not\ngetting the the benefits\nit has to be on an empty stomach 16\nounces on an empty stomach is critical\nthat's what\nmorning is best if you got to do the\nafternoon fine and try to keep food away\nfrom it so\nif you any lifestyle of eating whatever\nyou've adopted with any kind of food\nlifestyle whatsoever\nyou just need that celery juice on an\nempty stomach away from those other\nfoods\nthat that right there is critical\nmorning or evening makes a difference so\nmorning's always best is that empty\nstomach in the morning that hydrochloric\nacid gets built up\neverything you know and that's another\npart i want to talk about that digestion\nhow the hcl builds up when you're\ndrinking cellular juice why it builds up\nhow the stomach glands\nreceive the the celery juice\nand how they actually recharge and give\nyou hot you\nstrong hcl hydrochloric acid and then\nyou break down your food\nand your food doesn't rot inside of you\nand you actually get stronger your\ndigestion and your bloating goes down\nthat's another thing too that's really\npowerful wow that's that's super\npowerful i didn't had no idea\nso with with the with it having in the\nmorning how long after do you eat\nbreakfast\nokay you know try to give 20 minutes 20\nminutes 20 minutes\nafter the celery juice is great okay\nhalf an hour probably even better\nyou know somewhere around 20 minutes to\na half an hour i like a half an hour\nreally being solid like that but if\nsomeone needs fuel\nand they're doing something or they're\nrunning out of the house or whatever i\ntotally understand it\nbut try to do empty stomach try not to\ndo coffee with it try not to put\nanything\nin that celery juice if you throw apple\ncider vinegar in it you just killed it\njust killed\ni saw somebody out there saying i'm\ngonna put my collagen powder in here i'm\nlike you just destroyed your celery\njuice you're not gonna see the benefits\nso you can't yeah you have to keep it\nclean and not multiple times per day\njust once a day\nno you do the celery juice once a day\nbut i like a lot of people that have\nchronic illness do it twice a day okay\n32 ounces do\ndo do you know at the beginning 16\nounces do 16 ounces at the end of the\nday\nabsolutely and try not to have it with\nfood that's the goal\nbut the truth is you get the celery\njuice in you\nany way you possibly can you're gonna\nget some benefits but these are\nmaximizing it this is why the book's\ncritical the book gives you\nall the information to how to really do\nthis right and if you think there isn't\na lot of information to it wait till you\nread the book\nand then your mind is blown and you're\njust like oh my god i can't believe\nwhat can be done with celery juice\nincluding like oral therapies and stuff\nor problems that people\nhave like they have you know ulcers and\nall this stuff in their mouth and\nthis book is actually explained so much\nand here's the most important part i\nlove about this book\nis that there's almost 200 symptoms and\nconditions\ni talk about inside this book and what\ncelery juice can do for it and why it's\nworking so if you have something you're\nsuffering with\ni talk about how the celery juice is\nhelping you and i love one of the things\ni do love about the book seeing is\ni don't think there's ever been an\naudiophile that has the word celery\nmentioned more than this scene right now\nwhich is awesome which i love but what i\nlove about the book is\nyou also have a whole chapter dedicated\nto if people can't access celery\nand alternatives that they can take yeah\nwhich i thought was really refreshing\ni was like oh wow this is you know it's\na book about senator just be like hey if\nyou can't get it\ni mean and i don't know why people can't\nget it but maybe you can tell me that\nbut if there are places people can't\naccess it you suggest some alternatives\nyeah share those with us yeah absolutely\nthere's no way to get celery juice you\ncannot\nyou can't get it it's not even possible\nor just it's just not around\nand there's nothing you can do you know\nthere's other things you can do i like\nthe cucumber juice it won't do what\ncelery just does i don't want anybody\nconfused but it does some different\nthings\nit hydrates the body in a different way\nthan anything else could out there you\nknow it does\nhydrate the body it does it does things\nthat are really good for us it's very\ncleansing very purifying\nit won't it won't do what celery juice\ndoes but it could be something you do\nfor a week before you can find the\ncelery juice again\nso you know juicing cucumbers is\nactually helpful and someone someone\nsaid to me recently said okay so what so\nlet's just start juicing different\nthings and that's gonna\nno no no no this cucumber juice isn't\ngonna do it it just isn't\nbut it's it's one of those backups to\nget you by for a little bit like a week\nor a few days\nand and but that's about it i mean\nhonestly it's it's gonna have to be the\ncelery juice or it's\nreally in the end no go for what you're\nreally yeah what you're really\nand i know you cover in here but i i\nwanted to raise this because i know so\nmuch\nnot just of my audience but just so many\npeople in the world today we're reading\nstudies about it all the time mental\nhealth depression\nanxiety stress what's celery juice doing\non a deeper level for stress anxiety and\ndepression well\nit's the ultimate adrenal you know\nstabilizer\nthat's the other that's the other thing\nwith this celery juice i mean it's so\nhelpful you got the electrolytes\ngot the sodium cluster salts you got the\nheavy electrolytes in there\nand adrenals need that that's so\nimportant the other thing is brain\nthat that's the other thing when you're\ndealing with electrolytes and and\nneurotransmitter chemicals electrical\nimpulses\nand that's in neurons you're talking\nabout de-stressing\nbecause here's the deal we our brains\nget dirty toxins in them\nheavy metals mercury aluminum\ncadmium lead nickel copper they get into\nour brain\nyou know someone said to me they were\nlike hey i don't have any metal in my\nhead what are you talking about i said\ndo you ever have a fluoride treatment\ndid you ever have a fluoride i had tons\nof those\nall through my life i go that's a\nbyproduct of aluminum right there\nbyproduct of aluminum means it's still\naluminum\nit is part aluminum in a different form\nit goes to the brain\ndirectly so when you have that fluoride\ntreatment you're getting aluminum in\nthere\nit's in there has it left no there's\nnothing you're doing in your life to\nremove it\nwe also get mercury in the brain really\neasy we come into this world\nwith mercury in us from our forefathers\nand four mothers well that's the whole\nthing our ancestors give us mercury it's\npassed down it doesn't just it doesn't\nleave it gets constantly passed down\ngeneration to generation to generation\nand it sits in us and it sits in our\nbrain it sits in other places and it\neven could trigger off higher anxiety in\npeople it can trigger off depression\nhaving that mercury having those other\nmetals inside of us and we collect them\nhere\nthey're in our water they're in other\nsources we just get it\nin us celery juice helps loosen up those\nmetals stop\nstops them from oxidizing so they don't\nrust in our brain\nso they don't break down our brain\ntissue or glial cells and other parts of\nour brain it's critical\nit's just such a critical part of\nanxiety and depression celery just does\nhelp with it\nand i love that because we're talking\nabout this simple antidote\nin one sense yeah which is actually in\nfact mental and physical health\nyeah which is actually quite rare\nbecause usually we look at them as\nseparate\nusually it's true okay i do this for my\nbody and i do this for my mind yeah but\nhere you've got one thing that's\nactually helping both yeah i've run\nacross so many people and seen it\nthroughout the years and you see it on\nthe internet now\nmy depression is alleviating you know my\nanxiety is getting better\nthings are getting better just from\ndoing the celery juice crippling anxiety\nis so\ndebilitating people can't leave their\nhouses i've seen people suffer so\ngreatly over the years you know and when\nyou don't have anxiety\nyou may not realize what they're going\nthrough you may not know what they're\ngoing through when you don't have\nanxiety\nbecause it's hard to like get into that\nperson's shoes when you don't have it\nyourself\nit it doesn't really make sense what do\nyou mean you have anxiety what do you\nmean you can't function\nlike what do you mean you can't get out\nof the house and get in the car and you\ngot to take anxiety medication\nbecause here's the deal when you're when\nyou haven't been to a lot of doctors\nand you haven't struggled with your\nhealth it's hard to get in touch\nwith the ones that are struggling it's\nan entirely different\ncrew you know when i get interviewed a\nlot when media interviews me and i tell\nthem\nchronic illness people are suffering\nthey're struggling they never put that\nin there ever that's why\ni have tremendous respect for your\npodcast for what we're doing right here\nbecause i'm able to talk about the ones\nthat i fight for every single day\nbecause that's what i do that's what i\ndo i fight for the people who are\nchronically ill and they don't get\nheard that's the thing i've been a\nmessenger for them i've been a voice for\nthem all these years to the people that\nare smart enough to\nknow science and research hasn't had the\nanswers for them and doctors know that\nthey haven't had the answers\nthat they needed to move forward and\nthey suffered and struggled anxiety is\none of those pieces of it it's crippling\nit can really stop someone from enjoying\ntheir life\nnot enjoying working you know\nfunctioning\ntaking care of things going to school\nand you know i've seen people hey\nmy anxiety is starting to alleviate a\nlittle bit more and it's worth\neverything it is worth even if you knock\ndown that anxiety down\n50 25 the difference is someone being\nable to stay out all day or\nwork a day in their career or start\nwriting or do\nsomething with their life think about\nhow empowering that is and celery juice\nwhen that does that for somebody with\nanxiety and you see that happen\nyou're like oh my god i'm going to fight\nfor this i'm going to fight for the\ncelery juice i don't care what it takes\ni'm going to put myself on the firing\nline let's get this stuff\nout there more and more for people\nabsolutely and i love what you said that\nit's really been this\norganic emerging thing like it's\nhappened organically it hasn't been\nfunded\nit hasn't had any money put into it it's\nnot an investment it's been organic it's\ngrowing\nfirst service people which is amazing\nbut you've also had organically a lot of\ncelebrities and influencers reach out to\nyou\nyeah we've become fans of your work and\nsupporters of your work yeah and you\nknow i was i was asked\nrecently too about this and they said\nwell what are they what are they being\npaid to do it mm-hmm\nsaid there's not one celebrity i've got\nany ask you that oh no no i know i know\nbut it's a really good point because\npeople think it they're like what are\nthey getting out of this what do you\nmean what are they getting at us\nso let me tell you something about\ncelebrities that i know anyway okay\ni'm gonna be straight out okay they\nactually care about people suffering\nthey actually have tremendous compassion\nthey actually care about their fans\ntheir followers they care about people\non the planet and they\nreally really do it matters to them\nthey're drinking celery juice it makes\nthem feel better\nand it gets them healthier right so they\ncould be a more powerful voice in what\nthey're doing changing the world\nbut it's it's even more than that i the\ncelebrities i know\njames van der beek and you know and and\njenna dewan and so many others\nyou know and sly sloane and so many\nothers they care about people\nthey want people to feel better it\nmatters to them\nand because they've been through pain\ntoo absolutely they've been through a\nlot in their own lives all of them and\nso\nwhen they see people you know that are\nstruggling that are getting better\nbecause they know they're spreading that\nthat that information about celery juice\nit matters it matters to their souls you\nknow it matters to everybody to know\nthat people are getting better\ncelebrities have tremendous compassion\nthe ones i know unbelievable people and\nand it's just great that they're doing\nyou know pharrell you know he's he's\nhe's out that he he cares about people\ncares about humankind\nand this this right here it's not\nmeasurable this is it's unmeasurable\nit's just it's that powerful it's that\nincredible i love him and this\npodcast has been such an education for\nme and i hope that everyone listening\nand watching\ni've been able to ask some of those\nquestions that you'll be thinking about\ntoo because\ni'm coming at a point of just learning\nbeing a student and someone who wants to\nexperiment with this\nso all of my questions have been from my\nown desire to be an experimenter with\nthis i'm excited to see its impact on my\nlife and i'm hoping everyone listening\nand watching today\nhas got some of the information to get\nyou going but i really really hope that\nyou're gonna go and get the book\nbecause the book's gonna break it down\nfor you yeah the book's gonna stop you\nfrom doing a one-week\ntest which is a fad to actually making\nit sustainable\nand one of the biggest reasons i see the\ndifference between us having a habit\nthat we do for one week versus\nsustainable\nis when we're deeply convinced of the\nreasons when you've sat here and you've\nread this book and after you've read\nthis book if you haven't got every\nreason you need\nto go and drink celery juice for the\nrest of your life then that will be\nharder to\ngive up whereas if you just think oh\nyeah i'm going to try this this is cool\ncelery juice good podcast i loved it\nand you're going to try you're going to\ntry it for a week and you're going to\nstop so take my recommendation go get\nthe book get the\ndeeper reasons and insights on how to\ntake it why to take it\nand and what to do with your life around\nit to support it and that will start\nmaking the biggest differences\ni feel i feel so we're gonna end this\nepisode with the final five these are\nfinal five questions usually answers are\neither\none word or one sentence maximum so\nthis is gonna be a big challenge for uh\nanthony because he's sorry\nwhat i love about you just have so much\nto say but it's all real like it's it's\nall\nin depth like it's real your insights\nare awesome so\ni'm going to try and get you to one word\nor once but we're going to see how it\ngoes\nso question number one is what's the\nbiggest health myth you've ever heard\nthere's so many of them tell us your\nfavorite one\num all right metabolism\nokay go on yeah i'm going to let you\ntell me more\nyou've got so much yeah metabolism just\nmeans that we're alive the discovery of\nmetabolism just means that we're alive\nwe're living we have blood throwing\nflowing through us\nokay and that no one really knew that\nreally\nmetabolism was just the discovery of hey\nyou're you're\neating you're burning fuel you're a\nliving organism you're a living being\nright\nbut it's not why people gain weight slow\nmetabolism\nand that's one of the greatest myths out\nthere they're gaining weight from\nlivers that are stagnant and sluggish\neverybody's livers are bombarded they're\ntoxic that's why i came out with liver\nrescue the book\nbecause their livers are challenged and\nthey're filled with toxins\nand that's what puts the weight on\nthat's what makes things\nget the lymphatic system gets swollen\nwith water the weight comes on\nthe belly fat it's from a liver of weak\nliver\nsick liver stagnant sluggish liver it's\nnot from metabolism\nstill to this day i'm sure everybody in\nthe audience right now my god who's been\ntotally just fed\nme metabolism metabolism for the last 30\n40 50 whatever it is they're just going\nto be all upset\nbut i just trying to drop the truth on\nyou on that one it's a liver you take\ncare of your liver\nand that's the you take care of that and\nthen everything starts getting better\nwith weight and what we think is\nmetabolism problems\namazing yeah you're going to the root i\nlike it okay question number two\nif you could give everyone in the world\na habit to do for 30 days\napart from drinking celery juice every\nday what would it be that the heavy\nmetal detox smoothie i offer\nokay get the metals out get them out of\nthe body\nthat's the key i mean okay there's so\nmany different habits you can do i get\nit\nthere's so many for your consciousness\nso much for your just mental so much\ndifferent physical ones you can do but\ngetting metals out\nthat's the habit right there get some\ncilantro in you\nyou know get some get some spirulina in\nyou know the right ones\nthe ones i care about because those are\nthe ones that actually work\nyou know get some things in you pull the\nmetals out i talk about it the heavy\nmetal detox smoothie\nthat's the one right there you pull\nmetals out things change too\nit's like it's like the celery juice the\nheavy metal detox smoothie\nget into that habit get into the hey\nlook get into the celery juice habit\nthere you go awesome question number\nthree what are the top three things on\nyour grocery list\ncelery's okay that's a given right yeah\nthat's a give given okay another one\nwild blueberries okay that's the second\none right there because\nwild blueberries the antioxidants okay\nthat's a whole other food\nwild versus cultivated blueberry but the\none in the clam shell the pint-sized\nclam shell\nthat is the cultivated blueberry it's\nthe big blueberry\nit doesn't do a fraction of what the\nfrozen\nwild the blueberry you go into the\nfreezer section\nand you go in there you'll see different\nbrands i mean i use the wyman's one\nthere's another brand that's there\nuse that there's different brands but\nyou get the frozen wild blueberries\nthat's the\noh my god that food so celery that and i\nlove apples\nokay it's gotta be a must yeah yeah yeah\ngive me another one let's have one more\ni think\nwe've got we're gonna go for four all\nright papaya\nokay

food\nstore\nthat green is great leafy greens are\ngood awesome okay question four tell us\nabout the top three herbs that you\ncouldn't live without lemon balm can't\nlive without it helps the neurological\nsystem\ni've i've used it to actually help\npeople with anxiety depression of course\nbut also with neurological problems\nticks spasms\num tingles numbness it's anti-viral\ntoo like celery juice when you bring\nthat lemon balm in there\nit's a big deal that one nettle leaf\nanother incredible herb without a doubt\ni've been recommending it since i was a\nkid\nbecause of spirits it's literally right\noff the start\nrecommending it so nettle leaf that's\nanti-inflammatory of course why\nit also was anti-viral in its own right\ngreat medicine\nand of course you know turmeric you know\nwhich is a spice\nbut in a rhizome but turmeric it's it's\namazing so i like that one even though\nit's\nyou know but you got the yeah lemon balm\nmetal leaf and then licorice roots\nanother one\namazing and the final five question five\nwhat's the best way we can all start\nlistening to our body more\nbecause i think for so many of us we're\nconstantly\nincredible questions changes right we're\nconstantly like just like\nyou could be going through pain and deal\nand just having it there and\nsit there for so long without listening\nhow do people people we may not all be\nable to listen to spirits or channel\nor learn but how can we all listen to\nour bodies better there's one thing that\npeople\nhave to realize it's one of the most\nincredible ones that when we get sick\nit's not our body letting us down it's\nnot our bodies being\nfaulty it's not our body being a bad\nphysical you know aspect of us it's not\nit's it's not our body\ngiving up on us and most importantly\nit's not our body\ndestroying us or going after our immune\nsystem or going after our organs or\ngoing after anything\nwhat i'm trying to say is your body\ndoesn't hurt you\nit doesn't destroy you it doesn't go\nafter anything\nand we need to know that our body never\nattacks itself\nand it's the first thing everybody\nthinks they think their body's failing\nso no matter what okay there's one of\nthe greatest tools is\nif you start experiencing anything\nmental emotional physical\nyour body is not going after you\nor hurting you or attacking you that's\nthe most important that can protect you\nbecause\nwe can't there's there's people there\nyou can tell them what what to do\non how to listen to their body or\nanything but they might they\nthey might not be able to do it or they\nmight be too busy or forget it but what\nthey will do\nis their body's letting them down the\nminute as an athlete you think your\nbody's failing you\nanything it's just in life when we're\nsick we think our body has now said\nhey we're not helping you i'm not\nhelping you and that's it\nif you could if you know your body loves\nyou unconditionally\nit's there for you it's fighting for you\nin ways you cannot even imagine\nthat can bring you peace and get you to\nwhere you need to be\nfaster and better well i was not\nexpecting that answer but i love that\nanswer that that judgment that we place\non our body immediately\nis actually one of the most negative\nthings it is like that and the most\nmy body's attacking me my body's letting\nme down my body's failing\nyes my body's not strong enough yes that\nlanguage is actually programming us to\nlead to not doing anything about it it's\nan evil seed that sits inside every\nhuman being\nso no matter what you're doing whether\nyou're meditating on top of a mountain\nwherever you are it doesn't matter the\nminute something's going wrong\nyou go right to my body is now wait a\nminute turning against me in the moment\nand what do i need to do to fix it no\nit's not turning against you\nthat's how it works that is such an\nawesome answer man i absolutely love\nthat and i hope that message is\nresonating very
