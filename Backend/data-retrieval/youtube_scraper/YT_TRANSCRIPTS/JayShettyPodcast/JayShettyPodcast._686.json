    "transcript": "whatever it may be that you struggled\nfrom as\nsomeone in a position of vulnerability\nor feeling taken advantage of\nthere is such a strength that comes from\nthat\nlow and i am a firm believer of\nutilizing that\nand harnessing that strength to create\nsomething that\nis instrumental in your lives and in the\nlives of other people\nlet's start at that i just want to get\nto the heart of\nhow you're able to do it because i think\nfor a lot of people listening\nthey want to be more comfortable being\nalone they\nwant to be able to create their own\nversion of success not be dictated by\nthe one that's been brought about by\ntheir parents or society or their\nindustry\nhow did you do that oh my goodness i\nthink it\nit stems from the initial feeling of\nbeing uncomfortable um and knowing that\nyou just don't want to be in that space\nfor very long right so\nyou start to look for resources to help\nyou\nget out of being uncomfortable um\ni'd say from a young age i was very\nindependent\ni didn't have like a i had a great\nfamily and i had a great upbringing\nas a whole but there was a lot of\nunstable elements\nmy parents were not a good ideal\nmarriage\ni guess scenario growing up i didn't see\nwhat marriage and what like\na compatible relationship really looked\nlike\nand i learned to at that point sort of\ntake control of my own life and and\ntaking like care of my brother\nmake sure that i always made money i was\na little kid hustler it was\nreally weird if i think back to the\nthings that i was doing like\nmaking clothes selling clothes\nrhinestoning anything that was popular\nat the time i learned to do it very\nquickly\npeople wanted braids people wanted their\nears pierced i was like all\nover the place okay and when i think\nabout it i'm like\njust to make school lunch you know like\nmoney for lunch or\nwhen i was vegan i had to buy my own\ngroceries so i learned like okay\ni'm having a garage sale this weekend\nbecause i want to get follow your heart\nmayo this\nyou know what i mean like everything was\nlike one for one and i learned that\nit wasn't going to happen on its own so\nregardless of\nmy upbringing and sort of the chaos that\nwas going on at home\nwhich at the time i thought was normal\nand which is\neven more weird i i knew it was weird\nand i knew it was uncomfortable and i\nknew that they weren't\na good fit for one another but i\naccepted it\nand i sort of became my own adult\nat a young age meanwhile i'm i'm acting\ni'm in an adult world\num i didn't go to high school i really\nwasn't even in middle school for very\noften i was on a series at the time\ni was the only kid on the show so i went\nto school in a trailer\na tiny trailer just me and this\nincredibly political teacher\nthat wanted to push every election on\nthis like 14 15 year old kid\nso learn a little about that and what\nnot to do\nand i think one of the things i learned\nvery quickly was like i said i i had\ncontrol over certain things so i started\nto control what i ate to a point where\nit was unhealthy\num did go through an eating disorder\nwhile being on a show\ni've never really admitted that but yeah\ni dropped\ndown significantly i mean i must have\nbeen at one point my lowest 16\n15 16 years old 70 something pounds\ni was on a cbs series so the network was\nnot happy and in order to appease them\nthey did so much to try and help\nthey made sure that i had tons of vegan\nfood and smoothies\nthey made sure i was going to meetings\nin the morning\ni was so confused i didn't think i had a\nproblem\ni wasn't being honest with myself i was\ntrying to sort of cope with being\nvery quickly emerged into an adult world\nwhile knowing that i had a brother who\nis sort of still in the home scenario\nthat wasn't healthy\nand wanted to help him and wanted to\nhelp my family and realize that like i\nneed to be making a lot of money because\nmoney is going to help all of this and\nso the drive was on\nanother level and having control\nover the things that i could which was\nfood and\nworking out and staying as busy as i\ncould and being as motivated as i could\nreally drove me to skin and bones um\nbut i i saw the light pretty quickly and\ni'm gonna be so honest about that i\ni'm so grateful that i have this like\nconsciousness in me\nwhere i i don't need to go down a rabbit\nhole very long to learn\nthat the bottom is up and i learned that\ni had no choice but to be healthy and\nthat's where i started to talk more\nabout health and that's when i really\nstarted to lean\non what i was and what gave me purpose\nand what made me happy\nand speaking up for animals and taking\njobs that i knew were positive and\nfun and interesting and not dark and\ndeep and\nand too far stretched from the\nimagination was what i wanted to do\ni became very selective in what i worked\non i then ended up on nickelodeon\ntherefore because i knew that that's\nfamily friendly that's happy that's\ncolorful that makes me\nfeel good like i'm i'm getting in the\nlives of children which\nlike for me that's a game changer i love\nchildren i think they're\nobviously they're the future and i want\nto have a significant role\nin their lives i took being on\nnickelodeon\nso seriously that i knew being a role\nmodel\nmeant everything to me i'm a big sister\ni'm the oldest of my cousins\nand being on a show where i knew kids\nwere watching\nmeant that i had a position in their\nlives that i was someone that they could\nlook up to\nand so that's been really powerful\nand to this day i still have young kids\nteens adults you know that grew up\nwatching me on the last 12 years of\nbeing on nickelodeon\ncome up to me and and have nice things\nto say and i just want to keep that\ntrade trajectory going that's really\nimportant to me\nbut that's amazing that you see it as a\nresponsibility\nalmost because you know that people are\nwatching you\npeople are seeing you as a role model as\ni said earlier this the show for me is\nreally to talk to real models people who\ncan\nexpress their reality and people who i\nthink are real models for the world to\nfollow you're definitely\none of them in in so many areas of your\nlife\nbut i think it's really special that you\ntook it as a responsibility because i\nthink it's so\neasy at that age to be on nickelodeon to\nhave fame to have success\nand to just enjoy it like it's like why\ndo you even need to care about anyone\nelse because you've worked hard to get\nthere\nbut it seems like you've always just had\nthis responsibility in your life\nyeah yeah it's weird because sometimes i\nwish\nthat i had a little bit more of that\nbecause\ni find myself wanting to help\nso much along the way and wanting to get\nto a certain place so that i could help\nmore people\nthat i don't celebrate the small\nvictories\nin the timeline you know like i just\nkind of\nknow that there's so many people and so\nmany animals and so many resources and\nthe planet i mean you could go down\nforever right like you can think about\nand i think for me\num one of the\nthings that is always in the back of my\nhead is\nmy family and the people that\nsort of suffer with things in my family\num\nmy brother who feels like he's\nalmost like my own child um he\nsuffers with addiction and has been\nhomeless for um\nprobably on and off for about a year or\ntwo\nsorry i'm never actually like\nspoke about it um so that for me\nto see that in my own four walls\nand like the closest thing to me the kid\nwho i mean he slept in my room\nthe majority of my life he had his own\nbedroom but he slept in my room\non a trundle bed because i feel like i\nwas like his safety net\nso i've learned that i want to be that\nbecause i know that i have that\ncapability and i want to be that for\nmore people\nyou know i could be that for him and i\ncould do as much as i possibly can\nbut i want to help people before they\nget to a place where\nit's harder to to make a change\nso i've really tried to make that a big\ngoal of mine\nyeah and in a big way yeah i i think\nthank you for sharing that\nyeah and\nyeah thank you for being so open and\nvulnerable and just just sharing so\nso genuinely here because i don't think\nthat you're someone that ever hides\nanything\ni never feel that way like when i'm\nfollowing you on instagram or i see any\nof the content you're making\nit's just from the heart it feels that\nway to me anyway and when i'm hearing\nyou today i'm\ni'm actually loving learning about you\neven more because it's only making me\nappreciate everything else you do\nthank you and it's it's crazy because i\nalign with so much of what you're saying\nin my own life so\nmy sister my sister's nickname that i've\ngiven her is kid\nbecause i treat her as my kid like my\nchild so it's so funny that you said\nthat about your brother\nand simulating our parents i felt i\nmediated my parents\nmarriage growing up so i can definitely\nresonate with that\nand then i resonate with something else\ni'm listening to you and i'm just going\nlike wow we have\nthere's so much in common and i know you\nwere saying it earlier when you were\noutside but\nit was the same as the not celebrating\nlittle wins\nyeah i i rarely do that because i see\nhow much work that needs to be done in\nthe world so i'm constantly\nfocusing on what's next to solve or not\nwhat's next to heal\nwhat's next to have an impact on totally\nwhere do you where do you kind of see\nthat going or how do you want that to\ngrow\nbecause i mean we haven't even started\ntalking about all the great activism\nwork you're doing\nwhich i think is important for people\nlistening to know\nbut how do you see yourself kind of\ntransforming those elements we've just\nspoken about now\nmoving forward how do you want them to\nchange sure so\ni've been sort of in a lot of ways i've\nearned but i've also been given this\nplatform\njust from really being on tv and being\nin people's lives and feeling like\nthey're connected to me\nso i want to utilize that i want to\nto grow that and i want to utilize that\nfor the good i think that\nyes i'm invested in these companies and\ni like to call them conscious companies\nbecause they're not purely just for\nthe monetary investment they're there\nbecause i see a bigger picture\nso companies like outstanding foods i\nknow that they have a direct effect in\nthe lives of animals\nnot to mention the health and the other\ntrickle effects that come along with it\nbut companies like sugar taco\nyeah i believe in making vegan\nfood healthy organic vegan food that\ntaste delicious\naccessible at a good price point because\nthat's an argument of people's you know\nthey have this idea that veganism is is\ntoo\nexpensive it's not attainable it's not\nrealistic\nfor a normal person's lifestyle that is\nwhat i want to scratch\nright off the bat that is so far from\nthe truth and i feel like\njust not to go down another rabbit hole\nbut do it spending money\non what you put into your body much like\nspending the time\nand and whatever investment you make to\nwork out or\nhealth wellness whatever that means\nmeditating whatever that investment\nyou're making\nhas such a huge impact in the big\npicture of your life\na lot of people spend all this money on\nhealth care on pills on things to make\nthis instant\nfix in their lives when if you just do a\nlittle bit of the work along the way\nand you're really being mindful of how\nyou create you\nas a whole and what you do to help\nyourself thrive\nthat is a non-factor i don't know knock\non wood but i don't know the last time\ni've seen a doctor\nspent money at a pharmacist all of the\nabove\nnever i don't even take an advil tylenol\nnothing wow\nbut i really do believe that a lot of\nthat is because i make conscious efforts\nto\ndrink water to work out to love myself\nto meditate to do something that makes\nme\nfeel whole and balanced um so\nso that goes along without saying right\nwith these conscious companies like if\nyou can make these baby steps along the\nway and they become\neasy to implement into your lifestyle\nthen hopefully the bigger picture is\nthat someone will\ngravitate towards either eating\nplant-based or\ntaking better care of themselves and so\non and so forth so that's sort of the\ncompanies that\ni've invested in thus far i have a\ncouple that are\non the ground level startups i'm sure\nyou know yeah where it's you know and\ni'm excited\nright yeah as a future customer\ni appreciate that i appreciate that but\ni love the way you do it because\nfor if you don't follow daniella on\ninstagram you should go and follow her\nbecause\nyou make it fun like it's not preachy\nthank you it's never condescending\nyou never sound like you're better than\nanyone or you've got it right or you've\ngot it figured out\nit always comes from that space of just\nit's you make it look fun i saw you\non your recent video you went on the\nstreets out with the big pig mascot\nyeah and you were out with pig out bacon\nand i just i i loved it i was just like\nthis energy is so\nfun and it's and even the fact when we\nwere speaking about it earlier and you\nmentioned it now about how you've\nfocused on making vegan food accessible\nand affordable\ni just think the way you're thinking is\nso far ahead\nlike you're so far ahead of how others\nare thinking about\nhelping people thank you and yeah and i\nlove that\nthank you yeah i just think that um\nthere's so many people that are\nunderserved\num and there's a there's these\nstereotypes\nthat go along with that right you don't\nmake a lot you have to eat a certain way\nthey pump these saturated cities that\nare lower income with the mcdonald's\nwith\nthe jack in the box with the elements\nthat these people can afford right\nthey're they're not serving these\ncompanies these\ncommunities in the right way that that's\nsetting people up for\nthe opposite of success so to create a\nawareness via social media and using\nyour voice of the platform that you have\nto implement these different lifestyle\nchanges along the way\ni think that person tells their friend\ntells their mom that's the way that i\nthink so\nthe more honest i can be with people\nabout how i live and really\nit's just how i live it's not like\nperfect in any means but\nit's just for me it's worked and when\nsomething works like i just want people\nto\nknow and i think it's like it's our\nright to share with people\nand help people along the way because\nwhy wouldn't you if you're thriving in\nyour own right then why wouldn't you\nshare whatever tips or tricks that you\nhave and so\num i've sort of started a little pet\nproject\njust on instagram called daniella's\ndigest\nand it kind of goes in different terms\nof the word right so it's like yes what\nwe put into our body and we digest it\nand all those kind of things but also in\ngeneral like i just want to break down\ndifferent articles and different facts\nand\nshare inspiring messages and eventually\ni see myself\ninterviewing people in this space the\nhealth and wellness space but also just\nalways reminding ourselves to keep it\nlight and fun\nbecause that's how i got into these\npeople's lives i'll never forget that i\ndo sitcom i do comedy that's my forte\nand that's the approach i have in life\nyou know if we can't laugh at it\neven if it is deep and dark and scary we\nhave to find the light\nor else there's no optimism there's no\npotential for\nfor change or innovation you have to\nconstantly be kind of seeking out\nthe light even in the darkest of times\nand that's what i want this platform\nto sort of be and i want that to\nresonate with people if they're feeling\nlike\nthey're not motivated today or they need\na nudge like\nthat's that's what i want to be there to\ndo and i\nyeah that's i'm excited about it yeah go\nfind it on instagram daniela's digest\nright yeah i had it down on the notes\nthat's awesome\nyeah i love that you're doing that and\nand i can agree with you more my\nwhole reasoning behind doing video at a\ntime when most people in the health and\nwellness space were doing courses or\nthey were writing books and\nthey were speaking and i was just like\nwe need to get this out to\neveryone and my whole goal when i first\nstarted making videos was to make\ncontent\nthat was at the pace of entertainment so\ni wanted it to\nfeel like a short movie i wanted it to\nfeel like a song i wanted it to feel\nlike\nentertainment as opposed to education\nyeah but for it to have\ninsightful messages within it now i'm\ni'm not funny so i i had\nmeaningful uh meaningful videos that are\nnot comedic but\ni love it when comedy or anything is is\nused\nfrom the point of view of i love it when\ncomedy or any of this is viewed with the\npoint of getting people towards the\nlight\ni i couldn't agree with you more and i'm\nso glad you're doing that we need that\nmoment\nthank you yeah we genuinely need that\nmore and more thank you\nand i think the more of us that use our\nplatforms and our skills and the talents\nthat we have\nin whatever way it is to make things\naccessible easy\nrelevant to everyone in the world the\nmore likely we're going to see it\nyeah see 100 i mean they exist for a\nreason\nand you could use them however you\nchoose and i choose to think i'm not\nhere for a long time i'm here for a good\ntime and i'm going to try to make some\ngood out of it\nyeah i want to do that for people and\nthank you so i mean please you're\npreaching to the choir\nokay so it's been so awesome to be able\nto see\nthe content that you're creating and\nhonestly it never stops at that like\nthere's so i just i love the word\ntrickle effect because i feel like that\nis the perfect\nword to explain what is happening in our\ngeneration\nand in the generation of social media\nyou just\nyou just never know and i think the\nunknown in that regard\nis is optimism and that's what i'm sort\nof striving for is more of that\nyeah i wanted to pick that out because i\nthink so many people in our generation\nalso have a negative view of social\nmedia yeah and i find that because we're\nso consumed by it\nrather than using it purposefully and so\nwe find that people actually feel\nthey're wasting i know i saw a study\nthat said people are wasting about six\nhours a day on social media\ndoing something meaningless or\ninsignificant\nhow where do you get your optimism for\nsocial media and the trickle effect i\nknow i get it but\nhow did you get to that point where you\nwere like actually social media\nis helping it can work i think\nit started with realizing you know it's\nno different than taking that few\nminutes for yourself in the beginning of\nthe day to drink your coffee or read a\nmagazine or\nwhatever it may be watch the news you're\ngetting some sort of information to sort\nof\nand that really does trigger what's your\nyour day's going to be like\nwhat's going to sort of ignite that\nspirit in you and so\ni think people can use social media to\ndo just that they just have to curate\nthe right social media that they're sort\nof funneling into themselves\nand that's why i feel like accounts like\nyours are\nso i mean that is the proof and the\npudding right there\nstarting your day off and i know that\nyou're strategic about when you post\nbecause when i turn my phone on and it's\nthe first video i see\ni'm grateful because i know that that's\nwhat my brain needs to absorb if i'm\ngoing to choose to use social media\ni'm going to choose to sort of put these\npositive images and these positive\nmessages\ninto me rather than seeing i hate to say\nit because no discount to them they're a\nhustler in their own right and i'm sure\nthey have their own purpose\nin mind but i don't need to see a\nhundred different beauty bloggers and\nootds\nto make myself feel like i'm good you\nknow good enough\nit doesn't do that for me personally and\nsome people do resonate with that\nbut personally my goals are so um\ndifferent\nthan that and so i think for someone out\nthere who looks at social media in a\nnegative way\nbe sure that you're using social media\nto benefit you and you're not just a\nconsumer\nand maybe take the approach of trying to\ncreate before you consume\ni think that that's a really good tool\nto go about because\ncreating something that can have its own\ntrickle effect makes you feel like\nyou're part of a bigger purpose\nconsuming social media unless you're\nusing it purposefully\ncan really weigh on you so\nwell said oh thank you so well said\ncreate before you consume i totally\nagree when you're\npart of something when you're part of\ncreating something\n[Music]\nit doesn't take you away from anything\nright when you're part of creating what\neveryone else is seeing\nand and i have to say that i get\nmotivated by daniela's extreme workout\nratios\nlike i'm just like wow i need to\nyesterday you were pushing a\ntruck like i was just like what i was\nlike oh my god like you pushed it and\nthen you were chasing it\nyeah and then you ran around it oh\ngoodness and i was just like\nwow this is so epic i was so impressed\nby it thank you\nbut it's yeah it's great but that that\ndiscipline you have and\nit's i feel the same way about yours you\npost so many ingredients and you do make\nit funny too like i\ni remember there was a time when you\neating avo toast every day yeah yeah\nand i'm a huge advertised fan yeah it\nwas just\ni i couldn't agree with you more i think\nalso when\nwhen you're also able to connect i find\nthat the great the thing i love about\nsocial media\nis that you really you really attract\nthe energy you create you really attract\nthe energy you put out\nso if you're always putting out positive\nmeaningful messages whether they're\ncomedic\nor whether they're from my side more\nmore inspirational or positive whatever\nthey may be\nyou start attracting people and that's\nhow we connected yeah like we met once\nbut then i was following you on social\nmedia i was like oh wow we aligned so\nmuch\nand then we had a relationship built up\nout of social media yeah\nand we've not met often this is in fact\nthe second time we've been together but\ni feel like i know you so well and\nthat's what i've loved about it that\nwhen i've accelerated a relationship and\ni say this to everyone\nif you build up a good connection with\nsomeone online\ngo offline as soon as you can like try\nand meet with that person for coffee\nor have lunch together or whatever it is\nobviously verifying that they're real\nand all the rest of it but\ngo and do that because you're going to\nbuild a an amazing relationship with\nthat person\nyou know don't let it just be online if\nyou can go and meet that person do it\ni love that piece of advice i think\nthat's so great and especially in this\ntime where so many people\ncan go years or longer with just having\nthese\nfiction not fictional they're real\nthey're real relationships but without\nputting a face to the name and\nhaving that physical connection i think\nthere's so much more that can come of\nthat\num yeah so i i totally agree with that\nit's powerful\ni want to go back to when you were\ntalking a bit about your parents mm-hmm\nand growing up and now obviously you're\nengaged yeah you're engaged last\ndecember you were sharing\ncongratulations\nand i was i was lucky enough to meet\nyour fiance as well which is awesome\nwhen we first met\nand you guys are so cute together like i\nlove it yeah\nthank you we work at it that's you know\nit's the biggest part of it right\nyou want something so bad you work at it\nwe just connected we\nwe work well together for the most part\nand i think we support one another's\nendeavors and we respect each other's\nindependence but we're very much a unit\ni know we were talking earlier because a\nlot of people ask me about the wedding\nand\nthere's so much of that on social media\nyou know these big moments these big\nchapters in your life are\ncelebrated to the nines i mean the likes\nthe comments the excitement around\nthe build-up of an engagement or a\nproposal or a wedding or whatever\nit almost makes you feel like everything\nin the middle is insignificant which\ni think is such a misconception because\nit's the day-to-day that feels like the\nreal success in a relationship\nwow you know we can all have these\nmoments where we celebrate one another\nwe and everyone around us is celebrating\nour love and there's so much\njust anticipation around that but really\nit's the day-to-day grind\nit's no different than building a\ncompany it's that day-to-day grind\nthat inevitably sets you up for a\nsuccessful business or relationship\nand i feel like we we're doing that and\nthe wedding is\nis not on the forefront of my mind i'm\nreally more focused on\nbeing the right fit in the right\npartnership and on that note\nso yeah i think that that's like my main\nfocus is just being the right fit\nand having the right partnership\ntogether what do you guys do to do that\nwhat's your approach what have you done\nand\nhow long have you been together we've\nbeen together almost eight years amazing\nso you've been together\nfor eight years so anyone who's\nlistening that's real experience yeah\nthat's not\nyou know that's not just oh we've been\ntogether for a year so you've been\ntogether for eight years\nwhat have you learned what has worked\nfor you what can help other people he\nwas my first relationship so when i say\ni've learned i have learned\nokay in terms of the moving in together\nand having this co-lifestyle was easy\nthat was easy peasy i\nlove i love it which is interesting\nright most people are like moving in is\na very you know it could go one of two\nways and for us it was like\ni love to nurture and i love to nest and\nanyone who's around me and comes over\ni just i crave that taking care of\nelement like\nthat something that feeds my soul so\neasy that fit right in\ni think for me i have an independence\nelement that i've established since a\nyoung age\nand so being in a relationship sometimes\nthat that can be\na little bit of a tricky element but\nhe's also\nan entrepreneur in his own right so we\nsort of balance each other out like i\nfound that person who\ncan respect that quality in me and lifts\nthat quality up rather than saying\noh yeah it's another dreamer it's\nanother dream or whatever you know like\nso we work at it and we we've been\nfiguring out how to\ncommunicate along the years and like\nthat changes as you evolve as humans and\nit's um it's been fun and i think that\nto me is what keeps\nus interesting is that it's not\nmonotonous i mean it's monotonous in a\nway that we're\none for each other and that's it but\nit's not monotonous in our\ndaily weekly monthly grind like we love\nadventures and we love trying new things\nand we talk about\nyou know not falling into the\nyou know conventional relationship or\nwhat that may be\nfor some people so yeah i love that we\nwere both talking about our\nwhat's the right word our\nit's it's like lack of status quo like\nour our\nnot disgusting it's almost like we're\nwe're not trying to follow the rules\nyeah whatever the world's on yeah i\ndon't know who invented the rules who\ninvented that you\ninvented them i don't agree with any of\nthem yes and\nand why do they have to be tied to a\ncertain age\ndemographic or a certain stage of life\nand i've never i've just never thought\nlike that i've never felt that life\nis a set of stages that you have to live\nin order\nand i feel like the more you do that you\npush away from what you are saying which\nis\nfalling in love with the process and\nthen it becomes about the destination it\nbecomes about the next\nmilestone and i was saying that to\nsomeone someone was asking me the\nquestion the other day they said\njay how do you stay detached from the\nresult like how do you stay\ndetached from an expectation of how\nsomething should go\nand i said that it's when you get to the\ndegree that you're getting\nall of what you need from the process to\nthat degree you don't need it from a\nmilestone or an end\nbut if you're not getting any juice from\nthe process then you're going to wait\nfor that award you're going to wait for\nthe milestone you're going to\nwait for the big the big day because\nyou're not getting any happiness or joy\nbut if you're getting happiness and joy\nfrom the process then you're not looking\nfor it anywhere else\ndead on dead on and that's where rules\nand norms yes\ni see that happen so much in our\ngeneration\nand i maybe it's because i'm at this age\nand i'm obviously in that\nthat age where everyone is sort of\ncelebrating those big milestones but\nthere's not enough of celebrating the\nthings that i feel like take more inner\nstrength which are\nowning a company or working for someone\nor striving to do something in the\nactivist community or speaking about\nreal problems or issues in their family\nwhatever it may be like all these\ndifferent little things along the way\nthat make you up to be this whole person\nand this happy individual\nit's not always about the wedding or the\nbaby shower the big birthday\nbash or whatever it may be that kind of\ncreates this identity of who you are\nfor that moment because then you set\nyourself up for failure you get to that\npeak it's\nwhere do you go from there yeah and\nthat's why you hear about these girls i\nhave\nfriends all the time like i'm going\nthrough the blues the wet the post\nwedding blues\nthey're going through the depression of\nlike what was my life for a whole year\nand now i have to reinvent\nthe wheel oh wow and that must feel so\ntricky definitely and and the\ninteresting thing about that is that can\nhappen with starting a company that can\nhappen with\ntotally it can have that feeling can\nhappen with anything\nyes yes and therefore what what\ni believe being you're trying to say\nwhat we're trying what we're getting to\nis almost like\nit shouldn't be around any of those no\nit's it's a personal choice it's that\npersonal exploration that curiosity\nyeah because there are i know people\nwho've built successful companies\nand 10 years on are now re-trying to\nfind their identity identity was so\nclosely linked\nto that company that's how i feel about\nacting right i feel like\nfor so long my identity was and i was\njust\ntelling a friend of mine it's like in my\nfamily and my group of friends like\nthere's the actress that's the girl who\nyou know was on tv or\nwhatever and i'm so different than that\nidentity like there's so many different\nlayers to all of us\ni just i want to be the person who\nexpresses the layers in between and i\nthink\nthat's what i want other people to feel\nacceptable doing as well because there\nthere's so much that makes us great yeah\ni love that expressing the layers in\nbetween yeah yeah it's so true we can\nbe seen as so one-dimensional even if\nyou're not our job titles make us\none-dimensional\nit's like that becomes your imprint and\nthat's what i'm getting that's why i get\nexcited by\nevery time i get asked to send my\nbiography for an event i'm speaking out\nor whatever it is yeah\ni literally struggle like what to write\nbecause\ni don't even know how to describe what i\ndo and then my mom will be like i want\nto tell you my friends what you do and\ni'm like\nyeah i'm not sure mum like how you can\nexplain it yes\nif i told you a title they wouldn't\nunderst like you know but it's beautiful\nthat we are struggling to\ndefine ourselves in one sense yes\nbecause it we are\nmulti-layered and multifaceted we and we\nhave so many more dimensions and\nelements\nas opposed to saying i am this and\ndefining ourselves by a\nby a word or a job absolutely because\nthen you you\nby nature somehow instill all this\nhappiness and that\nidentity and what if at some point that\nidentity\ndissipates yes or you decide to pivot\nand then all of a sudden you have to\nteach the people around you that\nno that's okay like i don't i don't\nresonate as that and that's not\nall of who i am i'm going to pivot into\nthis and this is also a part of who i am\nand this also feeds me and this also\nmakes me feel empowered\nit's a it's a tricky thing to sort of\nnavigate sometimes\nit sounds like you had to do that yeah\nwith your friends and family yeah and i\nthink little by little i mean everyone\nalways thinks that i'm just gonna fall\ninto another show and i probably will at\nsome point\nbut i'm taking this time to do what i\nthink i'm supposed to do right now and i\nthink there's a bigger purpose behind\nall of it\nhow have you connected that with your\nfamily and friends like\nhow have they been able to see that rise\nof you because i guess i've only known\nthat side\nright right so i've only known you as an\nactivist more than anything\nreally and i see you as an incredible\nactivist like you're doing amazing work\nso how have the people who've had to\nevolve with you\nevolved have you helped have you helped\nthem see the different side of you or\nhas it just happened\nyou know it's been really nice is that\nsocial media is so prevalent because\npeople see what i'm doing very quickly\nand\nthey kind of get on board pretty quickly\nbut no matter what i do\ni don't know that i'll ever be able to\nshake the actress identity\nand i'm okay with it um but i just hope\nthat they know that there's so much more\nthan that you know and that's you know\nthat's all\nand i think you've leveraged it which is\nwhich is what we're saying earlier and\nthat's the best bit i think that\nyou've leveraged that identity to be\nable to be everything else you want to\nbe\nright and people like you said take you\nseriously they follow you because of\nthis particular identity but you're\nshowing so\ni i actually think it works hand in hand\nyeah so don't worry it works handy\nso i'm not trying to shake it too much\nbut i also want people to know there's\nthose layers\nthey're there i know exactly little\nbullet points underneath\nwe need it because i think anyone i\nspeak to that wants to be a\nadvocate for change an ambassador an\nactivist i feel like\nwhen you are known for something when\nyou are influential in a particular way\neverything you do becomes more amplified\nit's just the world we live in i know\nand i'm aware of that yeah so i know you\ni know no i know i know it's just i\ni when i hear that it's almost like i\nneed to reinstill that way of thinking\nas well because\ni know that there is a reason why i've\nbeen given so many amazing opportunities\nto be\non a platform or reach more people and i\ni\nsometimes forget how important that\npiece is and be\nso grateful for all of that and with\nyour intention it's perfect\nlike that's why i think i feel very\nconfident saying that to you\nbecause i know what your intention is\nand it's so much deeper so when you have\nthat beautiful intention and then you\ngive influence to that intention\nthat amplification is beautiful whereas\nif the intention is\njust greed enjoyment negativity fame\npower\netc and then you give that amplification\nthat never leads to any good\nand and i feel like i think you'll also\ninspire not only people\nwho watch you or know you for what\nyou've done but also\npeers in this space to find more meaning\nin their life too\nbecause i find that i was speaking to\nsomeone who's a successful singer\nthe other day and he was sharing the\nsame thing with me that\nhe struggles with the industry and the\nkind of messages that are put out and i\nwas like yeah but you can change that\nyeah like people listen to your opinions\nso you not turning up\nto interviews and award shows and\nactually sharing the right message\nis actually a disservice yeah like it's\nactually a disservice because\nyou not turning up makes says nothing\nyou turning up and sharing something\nsays everything yeah\nand and that's i think you'll not only\ninspire the people that are watching and\nfollowing\nand part of the community but inspire\npeers which i'm excited to see\noh thank you when i'm listening to you\nwhat i'm hearing so much is i hear\npassion\ni hear meaning i hear fulfillment and\ni'm not saying any of that's perfect\nand we both know that and same with my\nlife\nbut i'm hearing all of that and in my\nopinion that comes because you're a\nperson of service because you're an\nactivist\nand and that identity of yours that\nlayer of yours is what's fueling all of\nthis\nright yeah no i just had this\nconversation i i was telling someone the\nother day\nthey were struggling to find out what\ntheir identity was what their purpose is\nlike\nthey just feel like they live a more\nmundane lifestyle and they just feel\nlike they're constantly on that wheel of\njust what is the\nlife what is this and i said are you\nserving\nand they looked at me and they just\ndidn't know what that meant i said are\nyou serving like it could be on the\nsmallest way but\nare you doing anything for anyone\nwhether it be a friend\nfamily member community animal whatever\nthat feels like power that is something\nwe all can do\nthat doesn't there's no definition that\ndescribes someone who serves other than\nit's\nall of us we all can do that and the\nfeeling of\ndoing something that can make an impact\non someone else's life or\nin a bigger impact than you even could\nhave imagined yourself\nmakes you feel like there's a purpose\nand who knows what can transpire from\nthat so\nthank you for even saying that because\nthere's something really special about\nfinding that service element in your\nlife because i just\nthere's so much good there's just so\nmuch good that can come of that\nyeah definitely i remember getting so\ninto understanding service after i lived\nas a monk for three years\nyeah and and service was a total part of\nour life like that was\nthat is the foundational principle of\neverything wow and then when i came back\nto the real world i was like\nokay i need to understand how true this\nis scientifically too and i\nsaw this incredible study they did at\ncambridge university where this guy\ncalled michael norton\nhe tested how people feel when they were\ngiven\ngiven five to twenty dollars to spend on\nthemselves or spend on other people\nand they measured their happiness before\nand after without telling them it was a\nhappiness experiment\nand they found that everyone who used\nfive or twenty dollars on themselves\nwere no happier than they were before so\nyour happiness didn't go down but it\ndidn't go up\nand everyone who spent the money on\nother people whether it was five dollars\nor twenty dollars\ntheir happiness went up by at least ten\nto twenty percent and so it was\njust you know scientifically from a data\npoint of view forget how we feel and\nforget what we know\njust from that point of view and the\nfunny thing is that the most common\nthings people bought each other were\nlike bought themselves with starbucks\nand makeup oh my goodness and the most\ncommon things people bought others was\nstarbucks and makeup so it wasn't even\nabout\nwhat it was what it was it was that\nfeeling of giving\nand the whole study kind of concluded by\nsaying money can buy happiness\nif you spend it on other people and it\nwasn't all about money it was in terms\nof time and energy as well so\ninvestment exactly right even if you\ndon't have money it's\nthat investment of time and energy oh\nthat's so powerful\noh my goodness i just hope people take\nthat away you know like i hope that\nreally lands because\nit doesn't cost anything i mean it is a\nmeasure of money in that regard but\nit doesn't cost anything to serve and it\ncould be so simple i mean people say\ncall your grandparents\nyou know and you don't want to call your\ngrandparents you get off the phone with\nyour grandparents and feel like 100\nbucks you're like\nwow i just made her day and maybe she\ndidn't really know who i was like\nshe was that didn't matter that is the\npiece that makes you\nfeel like you did something that's\nbigger than you and you step outside of\nbeing a selfish person like we all tend\nto be because it feels like survival of\nof life sometimes but yeah it's it's\nawesome power of service for sure i love\nit yeah\ni i often say as we've been we're wired\nfor generosity\nbut we've been educated for greed and\nand it's\nyou know as kids what you said what you\nstarted with this whole conversation i'm\ngoing back to that\nyou started by saying that as kids we're\nalmost\nyou know our best selves and and that's\nwhy when you made that incredible\ndecision at five years old we're able to\nkind of tap\ninto how we really feel and i genuinely\nbelieve that kids are wired for\ngenerosity as kids we're wired for\ngenerosity\nand then education of all types comes in\ni don't just mean the educational system\nand it kind of rewires us to become me\nme me so\nit's beautiful and and i think everyone\nwho's listening for those of you don't\nknow\nand we've gone so deep with daniella\ntoday but you know\nyou work with a non-profit called\nbridget yeah meet bridget\nyeah that uses video creation to equip\nunderserved teen girls\nto envision themselves in careers\noutside their media environments\ntell us a bit about that because i want\nthe audience to hear about these things\nbecause\nthat's why it's so good having this\nconversation with you because you're\nliving it you're not just saying it\nyou're not preaching it you're not just\nposting on instagram about it like\nyou're you're behind you're an activist\nbuying so many great ventures so\ntell us a bit about that one oh my\ngoodness one of the most amazing\nfemales crossed my path through yoga\nironically i mean not really so\nironically there's some amazing people\nin yoga\nher name is asha and she used to work in\nthe field of yoga and she was going to\nschool\nand she saw this need in the female\ncommunity and these younger generosities\nof\ngirls these younger demos that are\nunderserved and she\ncreated bridget which is a community\nof girls that need a little bit of like\na big sister element and also someone\nwho can help guide them\nin their career path and give them that\nextra tool\nor hope or skill or just assist\nalong the ways i mean some of these\ngirls are young moms\nor just kind of were dealt a unique set\nof cards and\nand need some more hope and so we've\nteamed up with microsoft we've we're\ndoing an event at usc\nand we're talking about the me too\nmovement and we're just speaking about\nthe tougher things but also giving a lot\nof hope and skills to\nthis group of girls and if you don't\nknow about it i\nrecommend just doing a little bit of\nhomework and following us or whatever\nand coming to one of our events and\nwe're all just real people at the end of\nthe day and we're just trying to do our\npart to\ninstill whatever we can in these in\nthese young girls yeah\nthat's beautiful thank you yeah thanks\nso much it's yeah\nit's it's great to speak to a real\nchange maker like someone who's like\nyour grassroots you're but you're also\nan entrepreneur\nin the activism space yeah and that's\nempowering i think for a lot of people\nto see that you can do good\nyes and make money yes and be successful\nat the same time and you don't have to\nsay no and i think for a long time\ni felt in especially when i was growing\nup maybe it's in london or\ni always believed that you couldn't do\ngood and be successful like they were\ntwo opposite things\nlike if you were successful you were\nsuccessful but maybe you're a bit greedy\nbecause you want to be successful you\nhave to be greedy\nand then at the other end they used to\nthink oh yeah do getting people don't\nmake money\nand i always had i don't know where that\ncame from and i'm still trying to\nexplore that\nbut i always had that viewpoint and it's\nnice to see now in our generation people\nbring that together\noh yeah to show that actually you can do\nmore when you have more resources oh yes\ni feel like that's happening all over\nthe place these bigger companies are\nare realizing that people want to put\ntheir money and these consumers care\nabout where their money's going\nand as soon as people it's supply and\ndemand right so as soon as people start\nto supply for something more than just\nconsumer goods or more than just getting\ntheir needs met and they want a bigger\npicture involved in this like\nthese companies will all start to follow\nsuit because they'll realize like oh\npeople are becoming a little more woke\nover here it's time to step up our game\nyeah and that's what i want to be a part\nof i want to be a part of those\ncompanies that are realizing that from\nthe beginning\nand being the game changers right i love\nit i love it i've got my five big\nquestions for you\noh okay as we come to a close okay so\nthese are these are usually quick but\nthey've been a bit longer recently when\ni've been doing them because\ni have awesome guests and everyone has\nawesome things to share so i stopped\ndoing them as quick questions because i\nwas like if it gets deep it's deep\nokay and you can make them as funny as\nyou like okay so i genuinely feel like\nthis and and again i i'm saying this to\neveryone and i know daniella would say\nthis about ourselves it's not about\nbeing perfect but you do\nseem really happy yeah and content and\nthat energy comes out very naturally\nthrough you what what makes you happy\ni start my day with a cup of coffee\n[Laughter]\nand i i evaluate what i'm doing i always\nam\nchecking in with myself and i know when\ni'm feeling a low\ni either pop a b vitamin or i get to the\ngym and usually i get to the gym before\ni do anything because i know that there\nare certain things that make\nme who i am and if i'm not the happiest\nperson that i can be then i can't serve\nin the way that i can do best right so\num i know the things that work for me\nand it's working out it's being\nconscious of what i'm putting in my body\nit's uh drinking coffee i hate to say it\nbut it is it gives me energy i'm not an\naddict by any means but i do know that\nthere are certain things that make me\nwho i am\nyeah and that's that's part of it\namazing awesome second question\nthe number one question you'd ask a monk\nhave you ever met a monk actually no\njust you okay what would you ask a monk\nif you ever met one oh my goodness\nwhat is your skin routine\nwhat is your lifestyle that's the\nquestion i would make like what what is\nit what does a monday look for a monk\nright you know interesting okay good\ngood for me tonight yeah what does a\nmonday look like that's what i'm asking\noh you are today yeah yeah yeah what did\na monday used to look like so i'm not a\nmonk anymore but\ni used to be your morning start of the\nsame and that's\nthe morning routine thing is such a i\nmean it's really\npropelled into mainstream society now to\nhave a good morning routine etc but\nall of our days would start at 4am you'd\nwake up at 4am\nyou'd start meditating collectively at 4\n30\nand then by about 5 15 you'd have\nindependent meditation or personal\nprivate meditation\nand half the day basically is spent in\nsilence and self-awareness\nit's your growth it's about taking care\nof yourself your needs\nyour learning your development and then\nthe other half is spent in service\nso the other half is spent being out\nthere whether it's helping build\nsustainable villages or\nbuilding food distribution programs or\nteaching young kids\nor sharing the message or teaching\nmeditation whatever it may be\nso that construct is something that i've\ntried to take through in my life\nthat half of my life should be spent\nlearning\ngrowing even this exchange like from\ntoday\ni'm just learning i'm just listening to\nyou without trying to\njudge without trying to teach without\ntrying to share and then the rest of my\nday is spent serving by teaching etc and\nso that's kind of\namazing what a monday looks like very\ngood that's what every day looks like\nyeah i love\nit but yeah okay question number three\nthe best advice you've ever received\nthat's a i feel like i was from a couple\nfrom you today to be honest\num gosh the best advice\nwow it's scary when you start to draw\nblanks on that and because i almost feel\nlike\nsome of the advice that i've gotten\nalong the way has all been self-taught\nor self-learned but then again i would\nsay that\nfollowing leaders like you i i\nreally do feel that way there are people\nout there in my\nnetwork or in my circle that i learn\nfrom on a daily basis\nand i think um there's just too many to\neven choose\ni don't even know where i would start\nnice that's cool yeah that's fine\nand then the question was the best\nmentor you've ever had or someone that's\nthe best mentor\noh my gosh wow i'm finding a lot\nnow for sure i think growing up i didn't\neven know i had mentors my aunt was a\nsignificant\nrole play in my life um there was a time\nwhere\ni didn't know where i was living i had\nmy clothes in the back of my car\ni was kind of just sleeping where i\ncould sleep until i figured it out\nand my aunt gave me her couch for a\nwhile and i\nlearned a lot i got a lot done in that\namount of time i\nwent to community college i got my\npersonal training certification i went\nto school for real estate got my license\nlike there was this time where i was\ntrying to figure it out\nall amongst acting which is crazy i\nalways felt like there was more than\nacting\nalways and that couch and being in my\naunt's life still to this day\nshe's someone i lean on immensely she's\nfull of knowledge full of wisdom and she\ndid a lot of work on herself and still\ndoes\nand those are the people that i aspire\nto be like\nwell yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna segue\nbefore i ask you the\nquestion because you just made me think\nof a few things there\nwhat are your thoughts on so young men\nand women today who want to be actors\nwant to be social media influencers who\nwant to be anything that\ngives you that platform what would be\nyour advice to them\nwell i think we live in a time where you\ncan do it\nthat's the first thing i would tell\nsomeone is it's not a joke\nlike you have more resources than like\nsomeone who lives in the heart of la or\nhollywood or whatever you\nimagine who's going to auditions every\nday you know\nmaybe decide what your true goal is\nin terms of what what kind of\nentertainment you want to put out\nand then target that so find the the\nnetwork around that find the demo and\nstart creating content on your own\nbecause\nat the end of the day even people who\nare actors are still content creators\nand i think there's so much more power\nand so much more\nself-worth in creating something of your\nown\nbut not to say that using acting as a\nplatform isn't the right tool as well\nbecause i do that as well but i think a\nlittle bit of everything\nworking alongside collaborating with\npeople creating your own\nthat is all equipment to become you know\nsomeone in the public eye or someone who\nhas a voice or an actor\nthose are all things you could be doing\nand i always tell kids too get involved\nin school plays\nget your feet wet you know stand in\nfront of a large audience with the\nlights blurry in your face okay just try\nit on\ntry it on a few times were you sh were\nyou shy the first time or were you\nalways like\ngosh i i don't remember ever being shy\nin fact i feel like i was really\nannoying most of my childhood\nis what i think when i think about me as\na kid i'm like gosh she must have been\nso annoying\nbut i don't know i just i always felt\nlike i\ni didn't have a fear of speaking up\num yeah i'm so glad you're using that\nfearlessness of speaking up for the\nright thing\nthank you yeah thank you and my last\nquestion before i ask you\nwhatever else you wanted to share that i\ndidn't cover today is the\nworst advice you've ever been given\nthe worst advice oh my gosh\num after i had lost significant weight\nand i got my head back in the game and i\nstarted to get healthy\ni put on quite a bit of weight um\ni thought it was like the right thing to\ndo at the time i felt\ngenerally happy um but i just knew where\ni was wasn't where i should have been so\ni'm gonna do something else\nand my manager at the time advised\nagainst it and was\nvery honest about me putting weight on\nand she told me that nothing tastes\ngood as good as skinny feels\nand um yeah wow and i'd say that's the\nfirst thing that came to mind\nyeah it's pretty bad advice because let\nme tell you\na lot of things taste good yeah\nabsolutely\nthat's really important that's why i\nalways ask people the worst advice\nthey've ever been given because i feel\nmore people in their life will hear bad\nadvice than good advice\nyeah and so to be able to know which\none's which\nhelps a lot because good advice is\nactually more rare\nso when when people are hearing this and\nthey're hearing you share your worst\nadvice and other guys who are showing\ntheir worst advice\ni want people to kind of get an arsenal\nof like the worst advice\nso that they know never to like buy into\nthat\nso smart yeah so that makes sense that's\nthat's that is good advice\nis there anything we've not covered\ntoday that you're like i don't really\nwant to share this story i didn't get to\nshare this message\nanything i was like bringing that up\nbecause yeah\ni just want to tap into one really quick\nthing um\nit doesn't have to be yeah so i um\ni've been in this industry for a long\ntime i've come across a lot of very\nheadstrong personalities and i\nwas in some uncomfortable positions with\nmales and\ni learned a lot from it and i'm going to\neventually tell a little bit of this\nstory but i also feel like\nthe one thing i want people to take away\nfrom just the metoo movement in itself\nbecause i've never really spoken out\nabout it\nis and this might be a controversial\nangle\nbut whatever it may be that you\nstruggled from\nas someone in a position of\nvulnerability or feeling taken advantage\nof\nthere is such a strength that comes from\nthat\nlow and i am a firm believer of\nutilizing that\nand harnessing that strength to create\nsomething that\nis instrumental in your lives and in the\nlives of other people\num so i just feel like if anyone's\nlistening and feels like\nsomething was done wrong to them whether\nmale female whatever it may be\ninstead of taking and i get that\neveryone needs their time to\num sort of comfort themselves and maybe\neven sulk in that moment because believe\nme a good cry is\na recipe for a lot of answers but\nafter you're done take that time and say\ni am so ready to be the biggest boss\nthat's what i just wanted to make sure i\nsaid because there that i think that\ncan i don't know it applies to a lot of\nthings\nand i just really believe in like with\nevery element of weakness or devastation\nor anything that anyone's encountered\nthat felt wrong\nthere's so much strength that can come\nof that\nso i just hope that people can like hear\nthat and feel stronger\nthank you for sharing this yeah yeah\nthank you yeah\nthank you so much daniella for being\nhere i'm so grateful that was amazing\nyeah we talked about so many we really\ndid\nand i learned so much oh good and the\ntime just flew by i think we were\ntalking for like one and a half hours\nbut it just i didn't even feel it yeah i\ndidn't even feel it it feels like we\njust started oh my gosh we'll do dinner\nsometimes yes we have to we have
