    "transcript": "we're on the verge of connecting our\nbrains with the cloud\nand just like our cell phones do a\nlimited amount of computing\non the phones and the majority of the\nhard work\ngoes from the phone to the edge of the\ncloud\nand then the answer gets calculated\nthere it comes back to the phone\nif i connect with you through the cloud\nand know your thoughts so intimately\nit is an extraordinarily different world\nwe live in where eight billion people\nare connected at a level of empathy like\nnever before\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you who come back\nevery single week to listen learn and\ngrow now this week is like no other you\nknow that my\njob and my purpose in life is to\nfind and connect with incredible\nthinkers who can help shape\nour futures who can help us make better\ndecisions\nwho can bring us insights and\ninspiration in ways that we don't always\nthink about\nand today's guest is someone that i\nfollowed for a very long time\nread a ton of his work and i feel really\ngrateful to be speaking with\nthe one and only peter diamandis\nnow he was recently named by fortune as\none of the world's\n50 greatest leaders now peter diamandis\nis the founder and executive chairman of\nthe xprize foundation\nwhich leads the world in designing and\noperating large-scale\nincentive competitions he's also the\nexecutive founder of the singularity\nuniversity you know that i talk about\nthe book exponential organizations a lot\nand a graduate level silicon valley\ninstitution\nthat counsels the world's leaders on\nexponentially growing technologies\nas an entrepreneur diamandis has started\nover 20 companies\nin the areas of longevity space venture\ncapital\nand education he's the co-founder of\nbold capital partners\na venture fund with 250 million dollars\ninvesting in exponential technologies\nand the co-founder and vice chairman\nof cellularity inc a cellular\ntherapeutics company\nhe earned degrees in molecular genetics\nand aerospace engineering from mit\nand holds an md from harvard medical\nschool\nuh peter diamandi's favorite saying is\nthe best way to predict the future\nis to create it yourself and my favorite\nquote from him\nis this one that i have shared tons of\ntimes in videos and speeches quoting him\nof how if you want to redefine the\nbillionaire it's how\nsomeone can help a billion people that\nis the real definition\nof a billionaire so peter thank you so\nmuch for doing this and today we're\ntalking about his new book\nthe future is faster than you think how\nconverging technologies are transforming\nbusiness\nindustries and our lives we have put the\nlink in the podcast section\nin the comments and everywhere across\nour bio so you can go and grab\na copy of the book as you listen to our\ninterview today peter\nthank you so much for being here a\npleasure jay\nand uh and thank you for the interview\num i'll have to have my mom listen to it\nso that uh she can appreciate my bio\nthat's a really fascinating place to\nstart that you said that\nlike my mom is so sweet she has my\nbedroom that i grew up with\nin my home back in london it feel the\nsame way\nand anytime i do anything that she's\nimpressed by she'll like\nput up a picture or fan art in the room\nand say i'm the same same and i'm so\ngrateful for you know having\nsuch a beautiful supportive uh\nloving loving mom and i i you know\nit was i grew up from a family of\ndoctors um both my parents were\nimmigrants from\nthe island of lesvos and greece and it\nwas always expected i'd become a doctor\nuh and it was so like you know i told my\nmom when i was about\nage nine or ten that was going to become\nan astronaut and she said\nthat's nice son but you can become a\ndoctor and i was like\ni was like mom and and so there was\nalways this\nexpectation and she wanted that for the\nbest of me right she knew that that was\na great profession my father was\nphysician\nshe should have been could have been and\nuh\nand she's extraordinarily supportive but\nyou know i remember\nyears after i finished medical school\nand i was running my companies\nshe would like every once in a while ask\nis there any chance you might go back\nand practice medicine\nno mom it's not gonna happen but i guess\nmy longevity and healthcare companies\nright now are\nsort of a practice of medicine but\nliterally did you enjoy medical school i\ni heard you find it kind of tough\ni was really lucky that the medical\nschool i got into was hard\nto get into and really harder to fail\nout of\nuh i was running two companies my last\nyear of medical school\nand it was a it was a situation that was\nmuch more akin to um\nhow can i say getting through medical\nschool to\ngraduate for the purpose of making my\nfamily happy\nnot necessarily uh because it was like\nthe most important thing in my life and\na lot of things that i spend time on\nright now and i i think you know you and\ni share this\nin common is helping people discover\ntheir purpose\nright um because my purpose wasn't\nmedical school back then it was opening\nup the space frontier it was helping\nhumanity become a multi-planetary\nspecies and and i\ni watch and i i realize how critically\nimportant\nfinding what what salim\nuh my my partner at su\num talk about helping people find their\nmassively transformative purpose\nand there's a great quote that i love\nmark twain uh\nsaid there are two important days in\nyour life the day that you were born\nand the day that you found out why and\nand so that's super cool yeah i just\nwanted to share with you so i was very\nfortunate when i was at accenture they\nwould\ninvite saleem to to speak fairly often\ni'm sure you've spoken there too but\nwhen\ni was there i remember in coming and\nthat's when i got exposed to exponential\norganizations and mtp\nand it was mtp that actually helped me\nfind my mtp which was making wisdom go\nviral\nand that actually came from studying mtp\nin the book\nand so it was uh it's it's been very\nvery deeply connected with how i kind of\nfound\narticulation of my journey uh so share a\nshare a bit about that mtp\nbecause i feel like so many people are\nlooking for their purpose\nand they're looking for their passion\nand they're looking for their calling\nbut mtp really nicely defines that i\nfeel in quite a unique way\njust just let's let's just start there\nbefore we go so i i think\nyou know jay i i think that there is\nnothing more important\nthan finding a person's purpose uh\nan individual's mindset right it's like\nyour mindset\nis everything your mindset uh of\nuh for me and i the t mindsets that i\nteach\nare an abundance mindset an exponential\nmindset\na gratitude mindset a purpose-driven\nmindset\na solution-driven mindset uh because\nhow your mind thinks and processes\ninformation\nultimately is the most important thing\nyou take away all of the wealth\nthat jeff bezos elon musk bill gates\nwhomever you want has and you leave\ntheir mindset with them\nthey will re-accumulate that wealth they\nwill\ncreate a major impact on the planet with\nthat so mindset is\nfirst and foremost critical uh when i\ntalk about a massively transformative\npurpose\ni think about this as first and foremost\nwhat is the impact you want to leave on\nthe planet\nnot necessarily what makes you happy\nwhat do you want to do what is it that\nis the purpose of your life\nand i think about your mtp is the canvas\nupon\nwhich you're going to paint uh and your\nmtp\nfor me my mtp was making humanity\nmulti-planetary species opening the\nspace frontier that was my first\none and i'm very clear with individuals\nyou don't have to have\njust one in your life it doesn't have to\nlast you your entire life\nit doesn't have to be perfect you can\nchange it tomorrow you can change it\nnext month\nit's important for you to try one on and\nso for my first 30 years 35 years it\nreally was\nopening up the space frontier um and\nfrom that was born a multitude of\ncompanies\nuh and and projects and then from there\nyou know the x prize was born uh which\nwas a 10 million dollar prize for\nprivate space flight\nand i got very enamored as a result of\nthat x prize\nit was the ansari x prize was won by\nbert rutan\nfunded by paul allen now it's\ncommercialized by richard branson\nbut i became enamored with the deal that\nwe can in fact as\nindividuals solve the world's biggest\nproblems there is no problem\nthat cannot be solved period\nand and it might be hard it may take a\ndecade it may\nrequire technology needs to be invented\nstill\nbut i'm clear about that's what we as\nhumans do that's what we as\nentrepreneurs do\nand so my second mtp was\nreally focused on solving the world's\ngrand challenges\nand out of that came x prize foundation\nand singularity university um\nso since then uh my mtp's have\nhave gone a few different ways the two\nand you know\ni accumulate them right my one mtp that\ni spent all my life i still care about\nopenness-based frontier\ni still care about grand challenges but\nthen i become very enamored\nof late with uh really extending the\nhealthy human lifespan\nhow do i add 10 20 30 healthy years on a\nperson's life\nto make 100 years old than you 60 um\nand then inspiring guiding entrepreneurs\nso the mtp is your canvas and then i\nthink about your moon shots\nas sort of targets on that canvas\nthat you you'll go after and i just\nyou know i found too many smart people\nwho honestly\naren't sure what their passion is uh\nthey're we're hardworking they're super\nsmart but\nthey're not driven by a passion and\nand that when i say the word driven you\nknow your mtp\nhas to connect with a deep emotional\nuh energy and that emotional energy to\nfuel your mtp\nthey can come from it can come from awe\nlike amazement of space it can come\nuh from uh fear income from being pissed\noff\nof an inequality it can be uh\nyou know come from a sense\nof just deep seated childhood desire to\ncreate something\nbut there's got to be an energy level\nthere because\ndoing anything big and bold any moonshot\nyou take\nis ultimately going to be hard\nand sometimes as i like to joke there\nare overnight successes after 11 years\nof hard work\nand so at three o'clock in the morning\nyou know making another dollar is not\ngoing to fuel you\nit's going to be making a difference in\nthe world making a you know to use\nsteve jobs's phrase making a dent in the\nuniverse\nyeah absolutely absolutely and one of\nthe things that i love that you said\nthere\nwas around you've got to try it on and\nthe reason why i love that is because\nwe don't even buy a piece of clothing\nwithout trying it on we don't place a\npizza furniture in our home\nwithout positioning it and trying it and\nit's funny that when it comes to\npassions and purposes\nwe're trying to figure it all down on\npaper but we rarely try it on like\nphysically just put it on and go how do\ni look in this how do i feel in this\ndoes it fit does this need to be\nadjusted you know and it's like that's\nthe same\nmental process that it takes to find\nyour passion and find your purpose\nyou've got to try it on and you said\nthat i love that so so thank you for\nsharing that very uh\nvery very subtle but powerful advice on\non how to think about our purpose and\nour passion\nand i really want to dive into the\nfuture with you today because what i\nlove doing is you know\nyou're fascinated by certain things and\ni want to follow your fascination\nso that we can unravel it from my\ncommunity today\nand i guess the biggest question this\nwas a i used to live in new york city\nand about two years ago i was\ni did this little mini just quick social\nexperiment i went out on the streets of\nnew york\nand i stopped people at madison square\ngarden and\ntimes square and madison square park and\ni would just go up to people like what\nare you most scared of like what are you\nmost worried about and\ni literally got three answers the number\none answer was the future\nright people like i worry about the\nfuture another top answer was money i\nworry about money\nand the third one was like i worried\nabout my kids and it's funny because all\nthree of them are so aligned like you\nworry about the future but you also\nworry about how much money you love in\nthe future and you worry about your kids\nfuture right now\nwhen the future is faster than we think\nwhat is it\nabout the future that we fear so much\nand when we now when we're listening to\nyou you're like the future's actually\neven faster than you think\nshould people be more worried or or is\nthat like a\nwake-up call in a long time it was about\neight or nine years ago i just published\nmy first book\ncalled abundance uh the future is better\nthan you think\nand uh it was a magical moment for me\nand i i\nit was something that came from my heart\nand my soul and i remember\nsitting down with a gentleman by name\ndan sullivan who's one of my\ncoaches and um\nand he said you know peter most people\nfear the future do you know that\nand i said no and he says well they do\nwhy don't you and i said well\ni guess i don't feel the future because\ni have a good sense of what's coming\nand i'm excited about how it's going to\nempower me\nto make my dreams come true and i\nrealize that most people\nare fearful about the future because\nthey don't know what's coming and they\ndon't have a sense\nof what is possible and it's of course\nyou know there is a there is a validity\nin\nas things are changing faster and faster\nyour ability to predict what's coming\nout\nyears in the future it becomes harder\nand harder but\nthere's a reasonable ability to predict\nwhat we're going to see\nin the next decade and in fact that book\nwhich came out in january does a damn\ngood job\nat outlining what's\nexpectable in computation sensors\nnetworks ai robotics 3d printing\nsynthetic biology\naugmented virtual reality blockchain and\nthe implications that those technologies\nwill have on\nthe industries we live in the retail\nhealth\neducation finance insurance you know\nname all the real estate they're going\nto be some definitive\nchanges coming when exactly they come\nhow fast do they come you know there's\nsome variability but\nwe can be clear we're going to have\nautonomous cars we're going to have\nflying cars we're going to have\nhyperloop-like services we're gonna see\nhigher and higher quality 5g\nwith vr nar transform how we interact\nwith ourselves our environment\nand all of these things are going to\nchange every single industry\nso i focus on that i teach that i write\nabout that i blog about that\nand i start companies based on that\nprediction\nbut ultimately my job is for people\nto get excited about the future so what\ni say is listen there's no on\noff switch you're not there's not a way\nof like\nslowing it down or turning off the\nprogress\nwe have faster and faster computers\nbeing used to build faster and faster\ncomputers\nmore and more people around the world\nwith access to all the world's knowledge\nmore computational power more\nelectricity and so forth\nit is accelerating the the speed at\nwhich\nin fact um one of the early chapters in\nthis chapter three in the book\nis called the acceleration of the\nacceleration\nwhich is the notion that the rate at\nwhich technology is accelerating is it\nself-accelerating it's becoming cheaper\nand you can become scared by that or\nall of a sudden you can flip the model\nand be\nand be like totally empowered by that\nand saying that's\nawesome my ability to do stuff is going\nto be\nextraordinary and in fact it really is\nextraordinary none of us truly\nunderstand how powerful we are\nright to change the world every one of\nus\non our digital devices have access to\nmore knowledge\nin the world and presidents and\ncountries had 20 years ago\nwe have access to more computational\npower more access to\nyou know name it pick it we're we're\ndemonetizing\ncheaper and effectively free and\ndemocratizing making available to\neverybody\nall of these things so what are you\ngonna do with it this goes back to the\noriginal\nquestion of what's your mtp if you've\ngot all this power\nwhich we do what will you do with it\nwhat what impact will you leave on the\nplanet\nand that's a really powerful way to look\nat it it's you know you're spot on that\nwhen you see all this access\nbut we also know that humans are you\nknow\nhumans make bad choices when they have\nchoice you know we also know that when\nyou look at the studies around you know\ni think what's that famous study that\nthey did with like the jam jars in like\nthe supermarket store\nand and you know when humans have more\nchoice and more information\nthe majority of us are not good at\nprocessing all of that and therefore we\nfind it overwhelming\nright and we get overwhelmed we feel\npressurized\nand then we tend to make bad decisions\nand you say in your own words you say we\nhaven't had a hardware upgrade in our\nbrain\nin over 200 000 years you know\ndo you think that what part of our brain\nhas not upgraded and\nkept with the advancement in technology\nthat we've created\nand what part of what part of it's\nfaulty or needs to be adapted out\nso the challenge is that our brains are\nlimited\nas beautiful as they are and as\nbrilliant as they are\nand what they've created our ability to\nprocess the information\nthat comes into our sense is very\nlimited\nour eyes ears touch\nall of our senses are getting probably\nthousands of times more data than we can\nprocess\nand so over the course of\nmillennia uh it's not just for humans\nit's for all animals we've\ncreated what we call cognitive cognitive\nbiases and these cognitive biases\ncome from the ability of the brain to\nuse\nshortcuts and so for example there is a\nrecency bias\nif you've heard a whole bunch of data\nthe data that you heard at the end\nbefore you make your decision the most\nrecent data\nis got higher impact to you\nthan the original data there's a\nnegativity bias\nwe pay 10 times more attention to\nnegative news and positive use which is\nwhy all of the news on tv\nis so bloody negative\ndon't watch the news i don't we can get\nto that conversation\num there's a familiarity bias we're\ntending to\nuh credit people who look more like us\nor are more familiar from our own tribe\nso to speak\nand there's all these biases and these\nbiases were made up\nto enable you to deal with a massive\namount of information\nin the most efficient fashion and the\namount of information\nimpacting us is exploding it's not\ngetting it's not getting less\nwhen you look at it from that\nperspective it's uh\nand by the way i agree with you and i'm\nglad you brought the biases i actually\nrecorded a podcast\na couple of weeks ago as one of my one\nof my solo episodes which is all about\ni i picked 10 of them i know there are\ntons but a big ten of the biases and and\nyeah it's\nbut it's interesting that that's\nactually done to protect us but now\nthrough\ntechnology we're allowing ourselves to\nextend our reach and our understanding i\nmean\nyou've got two eight-year-old boys uh\nand it's like i i wonder as a father i'm\nnot a parent yet\nbut i always find that when people are\nparents and you have two eight-year-old\nsons\nthat you're worried bias and your your\nyour like security bias\nchanges and that's what i hear at least\nand so\ni'm fascinated to hear about what you're\nexcited about for their future and what\nyou're wary about for their future as\nwell\nyeah uh i'll update it they just turned\nnine last weekend so they're halfway to\neight halfway to eighteen they're\nfraternal twins\ni think about that um i\ni am so digital in my nature\nliving and breathing in a digital world\nbut yet when i see them\nglued to digital devices you know i\ni go i have a debate in my brain like is\nthis good\nis this bad you know they're they need\nto be digital natives\nyou know i want them to love this but i\nwant them to love the outdoors\nand and so i go through this i don't\nknow\nwhat the best approach for them\nuh might be so that's a challenge for me\num i you know for me it's it's\nthey're far more um\nopen to the world than i was i lived in\na very contained\nenvironment and so it's like what's the\nright thing all of us\nanybody who's a parent is constantly\ngathering lots of different models and\ntrying to evaluate\nuh what is right but i think ultimately\ni'm clear that i want them to be good\nhuman beings i want them to be\nempathic i think we don't have enough\nempathy ever\ni want them to find their passion\nnot my passion not their mother's\npassion\ntheir own passion and use that to light\ntheir views i want them to become\nable to ask great questions i think it's\nultimately the quality of the questions\nwe\nask in life that are the most important\nthings so\nthat's really fundamentally\nand i i want them to learn the benefit\nof working hard\nthe notion that you know you can be\nlucky but the majority of times\nthe things that i've done in my life\nthat have been successful\nlike i said earlier their overnight\nsuccesses after 11 years of hard work\nyeah it's nice hearing that uh that\nvulnerability with the kids because\nit's nicer it just comes back to those\nessential kind of like\nfundamentals yeah the essential\nfundamentals that impact everything and\nit's\nit's interesting because i remember when\nwhen i was uh\nprobably about i don't know maybe like\nseven years ago\nand and i remember i went to a talk that\nwas organized by the financial times\nand it was eric schmidt uh and and i\ndon't you probably even know eric\nwell i know eric well yeah you know yeah\nexactly so i just think yeah so you know\nagain i can't remember who did it with i\nneed to remember anyway so it was about\nthe book how google works and the book\nwas fantastic\none of my favorites also and his his\npartner who was with him i can't\nremember who it was i need to remember\nanyway\nhe was sitting with someone and that\nperson was asked a question from a\nperson in the audience that said\nwell you know what do you think we\nshould be working on and their partner\nsaid well you know\nif the the world's gonna be owned by\ndata so seven years ago he said everyone\nin the world should become data analysts\nand if you become a data analyst then\nyou will be the most successful person\nas life goes on now\ni like what you said differently there\nthat actually you want your kids to\nfollow their\npassions not your passions not your\nwife's passions\ntell us about some of the skills that\nare going to be more valuable\nmoving into the future uh and and how\npeople can apply their passions to those\nbecause i feel like you see it more as a\nsynergy between the two as opposed to\nlike\nlike for example i'm not i love data but\ni'm not a data analyst\nand and i get data and i use data but\nthat's not the skill i focus\nwhen use people say well what what\ntechnology should they get into what\nindustries they get into\nand you know i say number one they\nshould get into what they love\num you know it's become clear about what\nare you passionate about\nand along those lines it's really\nimportant to understand\nthe problem in that area\nmore than anything else because the\ntechnology is constantly changing\nright they can the technology is\nconstantly being updated\nupgraded and if you become an expert in\na particular technology\nthat technology is going to no longer be\nhere\nsome single digit and years from now\nbut if you're if you're an expert in the\nproblem space\nyou know the problem is going to still\nbe there or elements of the problem can\nstill be there so\nhow do you become an expert in uh what\nhasn't worked\nand the problem space so you can apply\nnew technologies to it\ni think that's an important uh set of of\nthinking there um\nagain part of me is as teaching the kids\ni can't teach them that it's asking the\nkids inspiring the kids\nto ask great questions because question\nasking\nyou know we're heading towards a world\njay where you're going to be\nable to know anything you want any time\nyou want anywhere you want\nagain you can ask any question\nand the data will be there to answer it\ni like to use as my example you know\nasking the question what's the\naverage spectral color of a man's jacket\non madison avenue\nyou can ask that question and know the\nanswer\nright not approximately there will have\nbeen\nyou know tens of thousands of cameras\nimaging people as they walk down being\nable to do the spectral analysis\nand then you can ask another question\nlike you know is there a correlation\nbetween\nany ad campaigns and what people are\nwearing today\nwho knows but it's again if the data\nis there if we're living in a world of a\ntrillion sensors today\n100 trillion sensors by 2030\nthese are drone satellites\nforward-looking cameras on\naugmented reality goggles uh\ncameras and lidars on autonomous cars\nimaging everything you can start to ask\nunusual questions and get unusual\nanswers\nyeah i've got an unusual question for\nyou when you talk about\nyou know a multi-planetary species\nif let's say we were able to\ncreate a new home\nand you were one of the first people to\ngo to this new home\nwhat would be the first\nrule or law that you would set in this\nnew home\nand and how would you ensure\nbecause i'm guess and again i'm assuming\nbut i guess\nhow would you ensure that we didn't\ndestroy that new home or or is that\ninevitable so here's it that's my\ninteresting i hope\nso those are two different questions\nyeah yes two questions yeah\nso the first the first thing is uh\nthat the technologies\nthat will bring us to a new home\nwill allow us to continually go to new\nhomes\nwhat i mean by that is if you think of\nthe earth\nas a living organism uh\nwe'll call her gaia for uh for the\nmoment\ngaia is about to bud meaning part of\ngaia\nwill break off and become a new organism\nand that budding will be some number of\nhuman beings\nall of our data captured\nin the global internet uh\nthe all the languages knowledge song\nbird song genomics of every species\nnoah's ark\nso to speak and so i can imagine\nus budding onto the moon onto mars onto\nfree space colonies like o'neill\ncolonies\nand then as those colonies grow\nthey will bud again you know we have the\npotential to have\ntrillions of humans out into the cosmos\num so the first thing we need to do is\nis make sure that we have\nyou know plenty of room for for growth\nwe humans do our best work on the\nfrontier where it's really a meritocracy\nwhere it's not the color of your skin or\nwhat you believe\nit's do you do the best work um\ni'm still i'm still concentrating in the\nback of my mind what is the first law i\nwould pass\nis it is it like maximize happiness\nis it uh i don't know it's it's do you\nthink moving to another planet is an\nopportunity to read to get\nright what we got wrong yeah i think one\nof the challenges is it's really hard to\nstart\nafresh yeah so you know there's\nthere's you know it used to be that if\nyou know\nin the early american west for example\nyou know 300 years ago if you did\nsomething wrong if you really screwed up\nyour reputation\nyou could like move away\npicking your name and start again um\nyeah it ain't gonna happen anymore your\nyour genetics and your\nfacial picks and profiles uh chase your\nreplays\nand there's no place you can go really\nan experiment with a new government it's\nlike yeah i got a brand new form of\ngovernment\ni'm going to take over santa monica and\ntry it but it doesn't work\nso where could you do that well there\nare two places\nthe first is that we're going to see\nthis happen in space\nit's going to be interesting to see when\nwe get\noff the planet uh is it going to be\na government like the united states or\nchina or russia or whomever\nwho says oh well we're bringing our\njurisdiction with us\nuh or is elon or bezos going to say no\nno no we're we're starting tabla rasa\nand we're we're creating something based\non these first principles i paid for it\nmy first principle is here um the other\nplace that's going to happen\nsooner and have a lot more opportunities\nin the virtual world\ni think we're going to end up in a\nfuture in which\na lot of us are going to live multiple\nrealities\nin the actual world but we'll have a\npersona\nand a set of friends and a\nexistence profession in the virtual\nworld so my friend philip rosedale\ndid this early on in second life yeah\nbut it's now truly going to become\nmuch more powerful um and you will see\nnew forms of government experimented\nwith there\nand maybe we'll find out what really\nworks well new economies\nwe'll find out that's yeah fascinating i\ni'm loving where this is going by the\nway this is like i'm like\ni'm i'm totally in on every question i'm\nasking i'm genuinely just like ah\nintrigued now\nwhere is the uh two two questions again\nthe first one being like are there any\ncivilizations\nor structures that you find fascinating\nfor\ncreating these like are there any\ncivilizations you've studied over time\nlike\nis it the greeks is it the romans is it\nthe egyptians is it\nis it the mayans is there is there\nanyone is there is there any tradition\nor\nold or new that you think got parts of\nit right that you're fascinated by and\nthat doesn't have to be\nor even a football team i don't know\nlisten i think um uh\ni think there are elements of societies\nthat have gotten\nthings right um i think you know\namerican capitalism and democracy\nuh got a good approximation i think\nthere's a lot that is broken right now\num but there's a chance to get it to get\nit right\nas well uh i think the ability to\nhave a different type of representative\ndemocracy where\nif i'm you know if you have to vote on\nan issue of space\nand you don't know about space rather\nthan then\nin a direct democracy voting on it\nyourself you can assign that vote for\nspace to me\nbecause i'm tracking it i think i know\nwho i want to back\nso there's lots of ways of reinventing\nthe voting system there's lots of ways\nof\nof reinventing the economies i think\nthere's going to be\nthe use of ai is going to play a very\nimportant role\nbut what's really interesting about the\nfuture j\nis far different from anything we know\ntoday\nand this is the concept i write about\nin the back of my book called a meta\nintelligence\nwhich is that we're on the verge of\nconnecting our brains with the cloud\nand so our brains have 100 100 billion\nneurons 100 trillion synaptic\nconnections everything ever heard seeing\nfeel thought is resident\nin those synaptic connections in our in\nthis couple of kilograms of\nof tissue and just like our cell phones\ndo a limited amount of computing on the\nphones\nand the majority of the hard work goes\nfrom the phone to the edge of the cloud\nand then the answer gets calculated\nthere it comes back to the phone\nthat we're going to connect our brains\nto the cloud itself\nfolks like elon musk are working on this\nuh brian johnson facebook\ngoogle i'm sure every government major\ngovernment is in some way shape or form\ntoo\nof how do you augment a person's\nintelligence\nand all of a sudden if i can\nconnect my brain to the cloud and you\ncan connect your brain to the cloud\nand everyone who knows our work connects\nthe cloud\nif i can if i connect with you through\nthe cloud\nand know your thoughts so intimately\nit is an extraordinarily different world\nwe live in where eight billion people\nare connected at a level of\nempathy like never before and people go\nthat's a crazy idea well let me remind\nyou\nthat you and i both are a collection of\n30 trillion individual cells\nconnected and working together i see\nmyself as peter i\nfeel like peter that's my consciousness\nthat's my ego\nbut i have every one of my cells in my\nbody\nis alive and processing\nthat's an incredible thought to have of\nif we were able to connect our brains to\nthe cloud and then share\nempathy and and and even just look into\neach other's thoughts and figure that\nout my\nand and by the way my i'm totally\npositive about the future i'm an\noptimist and uh\nyou know i'm i i'm definitely with you\nall the way i ask questions because i'm\njust always intrigued by\nwhen and by the way your answers so far\nhave been great i i look at a\ngoing back to that second life statement\nin the virtual life which i love that\ndistinction you made that\nyou know we'll have a second go on\nanother planet but more realistically\nvery early like more sooner not\nrealistically more sooner\nwe'll have it in a you know a virtual\nworld it reminded me of this\nvery famous seneca quote which i just\npulled up here where he said\nwe suffer more in imagination than we do\nin reality\nand and i wonder how much our mental\nhealth becomes harder to manage\nwhen we deal with a virtual life with\nvirtual consequences which obviously\nlike a dream\nfeel very real right like and you're now\nliving that and then you have to come\nback to reality and deal with that\nwhole parallel universe thing going on\nright now and your mind being able to\nprocess that where do you find the role\nof\nmental health in in allowing the average\nindividual to manage that because i feel\nlike there are\nand i'm not saying that there are\ndifferent levels of thinking in the\nsense of some people\nthere are different capacities of\nthinking some people's minds can\nstretch over that idea and some people\nare looking for that simplicity\nwhere do you find someone's ability to\nmanage their mental health when they're\nnow\nthey're now dealing with rejection and\nfailure both in the\nvirtual world and in the real world i\nhave two immediate thoughts there\nnumber one is i think if you\nshowed the average life of a person\ntoday\nto someone who lived 100 years ago they\nwould\nthey would not be able to cope yeah i\nthink that we live\nsuch a frenetic life of\ninfinite entertainment going from phone\ncall to zoom to meeting to\nall of this stuff um that it would be\nthey would be like in paralysis analysis\nand being\noh my god that's crazy but yet we do\ndeal with it um and i think we\nevolve social norms we're not evolving\ngenetically at a rate but we're evolving\nculturally\nthe second thing is and i spend a lot of\ntime thinking about this\nwe are all going to evolve a\nversion of jarvis from iron man\nregardless is an ai software shell\nyeah gathering and we have that right in\nalexa\nand in siri and google now it's the\nearly versions of that\num and ultimately what's going to be\nhappening is\num that ai software shell\nis going to be able to help you cope\nhelp you do analysis help you process\nthings make choices uh\nand it will make it easier for you\nit will be able to answer you like am i\nam i seeing all the data here am i being\nbiased by what i\nmost recently heard because ai's unlike\nhumans\ncan expand to a massive amount on the\ncloud\nso um yeah i think ai is going to play\nan important role\nin who we evolve into\nyeah no absolutely and i love what you\ndo in the book and i just want to point\nout to everyone who's\nlistening and watching right now so what\ni loved about peter's book is you'll see\nhere\nand i would show it to a camera if we\nwere filming in the studio but\npeter in this section goes through the\nrebirth of everything so he talks about\nthe future of shopping advertising\nentertainment education healthcare\nso i'm only diving into parts of it that\ni'm fascinated by and asking a lot that\nisn't even in the book because i really\nfeel the book so\nbrilliantly covers the the industries\nthat are going to change and whether\nit's your industry or an industry that's\nconnected to your industry\ni think it's highly relevant because\nyou're not you're not going to find the\ninformation in here anywhere else so\npeter with that let's let's dive into\nthe health part because i think health\nis such a big thing that obviously my\ncommunity audience cares about\nand you talk about making a hundred\nyears old let me let me just hit one\nmore thing on mental health i think it's\nreally\nreally important here for people which\nis our brains\nare sensitive to what we let into them\nif you're letting in danger and damage\nand issues and problems all the time\nif you've got the crisis news network\nwhat i call cnn\nor fox i don't have a good acronym for\nthem yet\nuh on all the time and just blasting you\nwith every murder\nevery problem every lie every issue\naround the planet\nthen you are going to be just decimated\nso your one of the things we need to do\nis be\nvery careful about what we let into our\nbrains\nit's like you are the average of the\nfive people you spend the most time with\nuh you are impacted by the environment\nyou're in\nwhat posters you have on the wall what\ncontent you let in\nand so that is such a fundamental you\nknow\nyou couldn't pay me enough money to have\na lot of the content\npresented by television and newspapers\nand magazines\nyou know they couldn't pay me to have me\nabsorb it\nand i'll just as an aside uh jay you\nknow\ni started a secret project three years\nago\nthat we're now just beginning to tell\nthe universe about\nit's a it's a project called future loop\ni\nbuilt a team around an amazing machine\nlearning scientist\nmorgan mcdermott and we've built an\nai platform that scans all of the news\naround the world scientific journals\nsocial media all the mainstream use and\nso forth\nand it's able to filter the news um in a\nway that's really important number one\nit can filter the news\nfrom a positive sentiment and a future\nforward sentiment and\nlook at what are the exponential\ntechnologies reinventing\nwhatever industry you're interested in\nso you plug it you put in shoes\nor bananas or whatever and you'll see\nthe\nfuture forward news of how that area is\nbeing\nreinvented i also the system is able to\ncreate an\navatar a digital avatar about\nanybody meaning it can create a digital\navatar\nof elon musk or myself or ray kurzweil\nand it can then say to that digital\navatar what\nnews is out there that you're most\ninterested in reading\nso the system can say hey this this\nuh this article was recommended by\nvirtual ray kurzweil and\nupvoted by virtual peter and virtual\nelon\nand so you can see the news filtered in\nthat fashion\nuh and it so for me it's about\nreally being careful about what i absorb\nthere's so much extraordinary news out\nthere but because\nnegative news sells ten to one over\npositive news\nwe rarely see it totally when can we\nstart using that\nso it's in bed it's in a free beta right\nnow if you just go to futureloop.com\nand register oh so many features going\nto be added\ni love it it'll be free for or some\nversion that will be free for\nmany years to come so it's meant to be a\nmeans for reinventing\nuh the news you receive and very\nimportantly to shape our mindsets\nfutureloop.com yeah i love that that's\nawesome that's such a great idea right i\nthink that's absolutely brilliant\nbecause\ni i i'm a believer with you like i don't\ni stay informed but\ni don't sit there watching the news like\ni think there are multiple ways to be\ninformed and know what's going on\nwithout having to sit there in front of\na tv\nand i like the uh the crisis news\nnetwork acronym and there's also the i i\nwas trying to play around with the fox\none you said and i thought of uh\nfear on xerox like almost on copy or\nlike fearless\nyeah fear on something x is a hard\nletter to think of words\nbut yeah it's just fear fear fear fear\nfear right like scare scare scare scare\nscare\nand and i you're right we stay glued to\nit and so\nso yeah no at futureloop.com i love that\nidea and i can't i can't wait to play\naround with it and i i really hope that\nit\nit develops into something that that a\nlot of thank you yeah\ntake a look and and send me your\nfeedback but very proud of it and\ni'm clear about where we're going um\nthere should be a means by which this\nsite\nhelps you predict where the future is\ngoing it is\nit is an exponential and abundance\nmindset so again\nhow do you want to shape your mind yeah\nif you want to shape your mind on\nconstantly being\ndepressed and upset and feared fearful\nyeah\ngo watch the news enjoy if you want to\nchange your mindset to be an exponential\nan abundance mindset a solution oriented\nmindset\nthen you need to choose something else\nand that's why we built futureloop yeah\ni think it's great it's you know when i\nfirst started making content\nuh what was going viral or spreading was\neither negative\nor it was you know um\nlike i read an article in new york times\nand they said you know the\nthe stuff that goes viral is generally\neither humorous like comedic and we all\nlaugh at it or it's\nit's negative and and i was always\nfascinated by like\nthat's why i was like could we make\nwisdom go viral because how amazing\nwould it be\nif people were able to share meaningful\nabundant mindset\nmessages and so when i started out that\nwas kind of like a hypothesis i was like\nyou know is it positive and all i've\nseen and this is thanks to the community\nand the audience that's\ntuned in right now and anyone who\nlistens or watches this it's it's been\ninsane that we've had for two years\nrunning\nsome of the most viewed videos on social\nmedia or the most listening podcast\nand it's like it just shows that we as\ncreators\nare constantly selling audiences short\nby choosing the easy thing to put in\nfront of people\nand and therefore it comes back down to\nall of us who are responsible for the\ncontent we create\nbecause when i started people were like\njay who's going to watch stuff i mean\nyou know it's not scary it's not you\nknow it's not new negativity but it's\nalso not like\nyou know no one's taking their clothes\noff like why is this content gonna work\nand so it's like it's it's so\ninteresting to me that i believe that\npeople are\nyou know people are more inclined\ntowards these messages\nif presented in the right way and so i\nthink futureloop's going to prove that\ntoo so\nyeah i'm excited for sure so thanks for\nsharing that with us and i'm glad we can\ntest it out\ni was going to ask this question about\nhealth because you talk about making 100\nyears old the new 60\ni wonder what would if you were able to\ndo that\nwhat would you hope people would achieve\nin that extra 40 years\nbecause that's what fascinates me the\nmost to me i believe it's possible i'm\nwith you\nbut it's so what do you know you\nmentioned singularity university earlier\nlove it um and i'm very proud of that\nrick kurzwein i\nco-founded him as the chancellor myself\nas the\nco-founder and chairman um and there's a\nconcept called the singularity\nwhich is that and i write about\nin the futures fast you think that the\nworld is getting faster\nfor a number of reasons and the rate at\nwhich is getting faster\nis itself accelerating and there's a\nconcept called the singularity\nuh which borrows its name\nfrom uh from physics in the black hole\nthe idea of a singularity that there is\nan event horizon\nyep and thus singularity is a moment\nin time in the future in which the rate\nof change\nis so fast that it's impossible to\npredict\nwhat happens next and\nultimately uh rey's prediction of when\nthat will occur\nis the late uh 2030s right so\nuh early 2040s uh\nso you know think about that it's 20\nyears\naway from now you know 25 years at most\nand if that's the case\nthen we're living in a time where we're\nnot far from\nhaving everything possible you know\nwhere we have nanotechnology and\nai and 3d printing and all of these\ntechnologies\nenabling us to to make our grandest\ndreams come true\nso i want to live long enough to see\nthat\ni think at that point everybody becomes\na creator\nthe ability to make your grandest dreams\ncome true solve problems and such\nso i think that's part of the equation\nmy other vision\nand i spend a lot of time in companies\nthat are about stem cells and exosomes\nand wind pathway manipulations and\nuh and a whole slew of different\ncompanies\nbut i think\na lot of it is living your full life's\npotential\nwithout having uh the suffering\nright and it's how do you at the age of\n100 have the aesthetics the cognition\nthe mobility\nthat you had at 50 or 60 um and you're\nnot in a wheelchair\nuh we're actually enjoying our lives\nit's because right now we really have\nsick care we have no health care\num that's so true yeah i mean\ni'm hoping that with that more time\nand and you also talk about how you know\nwe're going to have more wealth i think\nyou say in the book that we'll have 10\ntimes as much\nwealth um you know in a decade we're\ngoing to create more wealth than we have\nhad in the last century sorry that's\nwhat you say\nit's you know with that more health with\nthat more wealth\ni i wonder what's going to help us\nuse it wisely like you know because i\nalways feel like having more\nisn't great if you don't know what to do\nwith it\nand and i wonder how do we help people\nand ourselves know\nhow to be prepared for that more\nresponsibility\nbecause i feel like whether it's wealth\nor greater health\nall of that is a gift and and it's\nalmost like what we do with that gift is\nwhat makes it useful\nand and i feel like you sound optimistic\nthat we will do something useful with it\ni do i think people um part of my\npurpose\nis helping people find their purpose and\ni think people who have found their\npurpose\nare able now to solve more and more\nproblems the reason that the world is\ngetting better at an extraordinary rate\nand a lot of my work is showing that we\nare creating more and more abundance\nis that people can find and solve\nproblems greater than any time ever\nbefore and you're more and more\nentrepreneurs and you know this is\nby almost every measure making the world\nuh extraordinary of course i'm not\nirrational there are reasons to fear um\nbut on the whole even though between\n1900 and 2000 we had\nworld war one spanish flu world war\nii you know great depression vietnam and\n150 million people died the world still\ngot better an extraordinary rate over\nthat century\nand i think that's going to continue\nyeah\nyeah absolutely things if things have\nmoved so so fast and\nyour reminder for us that it's\naccelerating even further is another\nreason why we need to stay attuned i\nthink\nanyone right now and you're so right you\nsaid at the beginning there's no on and\noff button so\nsitting here and complaining about the\nfuture or being negative about it or\nhoping that things would slow down or\nhoping that this technology is going to\ndisappear like\nthat's not going to happen you know i'm\nsure people wish the internet never\nhappened and social media never happened\nit's going to keep happening and and i\nthink you know it's it's\nbetter to know what's happening and be\nprepared then\nthen to try and hope and pretend like\nit's not happening so\nbefore we dive in peter to the last two\nfinal fast\nrapid fire rounds of this uh podcast i\nwant to ask you is there anything that i\nhaven't asked you that\nyou're feeling like you really want to\nshare with this community and audience\nthat you think is useful for them\nwe talked about mindset we talked about\num\nthe idea of shaping the news that comes\ninto you\ni'll offer out that those who are\ninterested in following my work i put\nout a blog every sunday called\num it's if you go to diamandis.com my\nlast name you can\nyou can uh sign up for it and i really\nfocus on how to help people\nview the world through this abundance\nand exponential mindset\num otherwise no pal i'm i'm good let's\ndive into your last two\ni love that awesome no and absolutely i\nthink everyone should\nsubscribe the blog if you can't\ndiamandis.com and that's free right\nevery sunday\nyeah absolutely that's awesome i love\nthat okay great so this is our\nrapid fire round where we have quick\nanswers so each of these are fill in the\nblanks\nyou got to fill in the blanks so the\nfirst one is\ntechnology should always\ncreate uh abundance nice\nwhen you hit a brick wall\nknock it down i only\ninvest in people\ni have no tolerance for\num\nhuge egos nice being an entrepreneur\nmeans solving problems\nineffective companies are ones that\ndo not evolve oh\nnice to understand people\nis to know uh\ntheir passion and purpose nice great\nanswers we're\nvery impressed peter very very impressed\ni don't think we've ever had anyone do\nthem all that quick in that well so\nthat's\nand no cliche answers either so very\nimpressive okay these are your final\nfive these are rapid fire questions\nwhich means\nyou can answer them in one word or one\nsentence we may\ndissect if i want to but i i think you\nyou're going to do a pretty good show\nthese are your final five the first\nquestion the one lesson you feel\nhelped you the most throughout your\ncareer\nuh to follow follow my dreams uh and\nmaking a quick\nbuck uh was a waste of time\nnice okay question number two what do\nyou want to leave your kids with\nthat you didn't have growing up uh the\nfreedom\nto pursue whatever they desire in life\nokay\nawesome this is more generic not about\nyour second planet if you could create a\nlaw that everyone would have to follow\nin the world right now what would it be\noh wow um\nman i'm back to the laws again\ni love laws i love laws i i think\nlaws uh when when you think about making\nlaws the reason why i like\nquestion is not so you know yeah okay i\nhave a whole set of i call\npeter's laws i don't know if you know\nthat i didn't know that yeah i've sold\nhundreds of thousands of these posters\nwhen i was in college\nuh a friend of mine put on the wall\nmurphy's law\nif you could go wrong right i was so\nangry\nat that because it pissed me off i went\nto my whiteboard and i wrote\nif anything can go wrong fix it to hell\nwith murphy\nand put peter's law and then it went on\nfrom there when given the choice take\nboth\nstart at the top and work your way up\nthe squeaky wheel gets replaced\nno simply means try again one level\nhigher you know the best way to predict\nthe future is create it yourself\nso there i've got i've got like 30 of\nthem i love that\nthat's awesome i love those we're gonna\nhave to see them in the next vlog\ngoogle peter's laws you'll see the\nposter hey i didn't know that yeah no\nlaws to me\ndissect our deepest values they're the\nbest at telling what we really care\nabout okay good all right so we've got a\nwhole list to go there\nand okay two more questions left number\nfour what is something that you\nknow that you think is so right and so\ntrue but other people would disagree\nwith you on so what is something that\nyou're saying\nabout that the world is getting better\non almost every level\nat an extraordinary rate yeah\ninteresting that is something that i\nthink people would debate for a long\ntime\nfor sure so yeah i agree good answer and\nfifth and final question\nwhat was your biggest lesson from the\nlast 12 months\ni think one of my biggest lessons has\nbeen the ability to work\nand grow closer to my team digitally\nthan being physically in person i had\nvery much\na mindset of we have to be together we\nhave to come to the office and so forth\nand it's been uh pretty damn effective\nuh in terms of uh of\nuh operating as a virtualized team yeah\nyeah love that thank you that is peter\ndiamandis everyone\ntalking about his new book since january\nthe future\nis faster than you think go and grab a\ncopy we put the link\ninto the comments and all of the\nsections with the podcast i really hope\nyou go grab a copy like i said today was\na fascinating one for me because we\ndidn't really follow a script i just\nwent straight in on stuff that was\nreally really on my mind about the\nfuture and that's what i love that you\nget to do with peter but in the book\nlike i said peter actually breaks down\nthe future of advertising the future of\neducation the future of health\nit goes deep into it so whether you want\nto understand an industry that you\ncurrently work in\nan industry that you're fascinated about\nan industry you know nothing about\nit's important to know what's happening\nin the future so you may just go on the\ninternet look at trends of 2020 and\n2021 but it's you know this this is like\nthis is totally beyond that so i hope\nyou all go and grab a copy and peter\nthank you for your time today\nand i'm excited to be in the same room\nwith you man this is like thank you jay\nwell
