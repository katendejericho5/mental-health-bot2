    "transcript": "i remember when she passed our whole\nfamily would have to get together and\npractice\nthe ceremony with for the offering of\nthe incense and everything\nand one day we were all doing that and i\nremember i went outside\nand i saw like butterflies flying around\nand i was like talking to the sky like i\nliterally remember being this little\nbaby\nand like talking to god and saying\nyou know you can bring my grandmother\nback like it's okay i won't be scared\nlike if she falls from the sky\nblah blah blah blah and then i saw two\nbutterflies go by and i was kind of like\nsomething about that moment kind of made\nme feel like oh okay she's\n[Music]\nhere\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that come back\nevery week to listen learn and grow now\ni'm\nreally really looking forward to this\nnext conversation because it's with\nsomeone who's been pouring their heart\ninto making music about meditation\nmaking it an opportunity for revelation\nin our own lives and making it about\nhealing today i'm talking with janae\naiko\nabout the sound healing and creative\nintention\nshe pours into her music janae is a\nsix-time grammy-nominated r b performer\nin addition to her music career she's a\nbarnes noble best-selling author\nand mother her new album chalumbo\nis absolutely phenomenal it's a work of\nart\nand it's truly been the album of the\nyear of helping people this year\nget through their struggle their pain\nand their challenges\nand i'm so glad to have this\nconversation and share this space with\nher right now\ni want to start with asking you probably\nsomething totally random but i saw\nthe other day you posted something on\ninstagram which is where we connected\nand you posted adventure in your caption\nand then you were like\nwhat looked like next to an unearthed\ntree\nor it was like this crazy yeah can you\ntell us about what that place was yeah\nso i was\nin point lobos which is in\ncarmel um i think they call it the\ncentral coast\nit's like up the california coast\nit was like a hiking trail and literally\nwhile i was walking i was looking at the\nroots and i've been like obsessed with\nroots\nlately like actual roots of trees\nand my own personal roots as well and\ni saw them coming out while we were\nwalking on the trail\nand they were so smooth and shiny and\nstrong and i was just like wow and then\nwe just came\nupon this like you said it looked like a\nalmost like a tree hat gotten\nlike ripped from the ground\nand all the roots were exposed and they\nwere like it was like a wall of roots\nand i was just like wow this is cool and\ni first\ni took a picture just of it and then\nmy boyfriend was like do you want to be\nin the picture i actually didn't\none i just wanted a picture of that but\nthen i was like okay cool\nand so yeah that's what it was and i\njust thought it looked\nreally cool yeah it did it looked\namazing i\ni caught my eye straight away and i i\ncouldn't wait to ask you about it\nbecause\nit looked like an incredible experience\nand i'm more fascinated now because of\nwhat you just said of\nyour fascination with roots tell us\nabout\nboth your fascination with the roots of\ntrees but then tell us about your own\nroots as well and\nyeah what formed you into who you are\nthe past maybe\nthree four years i\nhave been studying my family history\nand i feel like most of us sort of\njust we only know what our parents and\ngrandparents have told us and\nyou know some families they do have more\ninformation about\nyou know the family and the roots and\nlike where everyone comes from\nbut my family is from all over and i\njust remember hearing so many different\nthings\nyou know like i said maybe four or five\nyears ago i\nwas like i really want to figure out for\nmyself you know\nand really study my family history and\nso i did the dna thing on ancestry.com\nand the results were like what like\nthese are\nyou know like it was things i didn't\nknow that i had\nthat um the results basically\ni didn't know a lot of that information\nso\nwithin that site they take you to\ndifferent um records\nof the people in your family and then it\njust keeps going deeper and deeper and\ndeeper\nand so those roots i of course got super\nintrigued by and i just felt\nmore of myself you know learning about\nand seeing pictures of you know these\nrelatives\nthat i knew nothing about you know\nand even more so they they pull up\npeople that share your dna and so\nthey'll pull\nyou know first cousin second cousin\nthird cousin fourth cousin fifth\nsixth and you see these people and you\nget to message each other\nand they all\nlook different you know and they all but\nthen it just\ni don't know it's just such a fulfilling\nfeeling to\nconnect with people that\nare your family that you didn't know\nabout you know and just learn about\nfamily and i think part of\nme feeling more grounded today is\ndiscovering that my roots are so deep\nand so\nwidespread and so now when i look at\ntrees\nand i see the roots i'm just like oh\nthis is like i'm a tree\nand and my family you know and\nthose are my roots so yeah yeah i love\nthat yeah it's such a\ngrounding feeling yeah it's such a\ncentering feeling\nof realizing that your roots are ancient\nand\nold and you've survived and your\nfamily's like\nthrived for this long and the amount\nit's got through i remember doing the\ntest\ntoo the the ancestry.com test and i\nremember finding out\ni was 77 south asian which is what i\nexpected but then i saw that i was one\npercent native american\nand that for me was just i i didn't\nrealize that there was any part of me\nthat\nwas from anywhere else and i agree with\nyou when i started tracing it too\nit's it's phenomenal to see how\ninterconnected we all are\ni don't know if you've heard about my\none of my teachers one of my monk\nteachers always talks about\nuh the redwood forest and the redwood\ntrees\nand i don't know if you've heard about\ntheir roots no so so their roots do\nsomething really interesting you've just\nsparked this they don't grow down\nand far they actually grow across\nand wide nice and they intertwine with\nother trees\nand so the other redwood trees that are\nlike baby redwood trees\nthey tie up with the big redwood trees\nand then\nall the trees share their nutrients\nthrough their roots\nacross the whole network which i think's\nthat's amazing yeah it's unbelievable so\nyeah your fascination with roots is very\nuh it's very justified there's\nthere's there's a lot to learn there but\ni was speaking to you earlier when we\nwere\njust chatting briefly before about how\nyou've really been bringing this\nspiritual energy into your music and and\ni've\nreally genuinely admired and had so many\namazing meditative experiences listening\nto your work oh good\nuh and and uh i want to start with\nwhere did your spiritual journey begin\nwhere did that journey for you\nkind of ignite right before you even\nthought about bringing it to your music\nah my spiritual journey was ignited\nwhen i was i think i was like\nfour or five miyoko do you remember when\num\ngrandma passed away right i was maybe\nlike four or five\ni think i i was i was really young\nand i had it felt like i had just met\nher\nmaybe you know your\nbaby mind is like the time is a little\ndifferent so in my\nmy memory is that i just got to know her\nyou know maybe like\nit was probably i knew her for like\na year at least in my memory of being\nyou know such a\nyoung baby person\ndidn't get to spend that much time with\nher but i fell in love with her\nimmediately she\num this little japanese lady\nshe used to let me play with her\nwrinkles um\nshe didn't speak a lot very quiet very\njust like cute to me she was like a\nkitten and\nshe passed away and i was just like\nand i remember asking my dad my dad who\nis a pediatrician\nhe would always explain things to us in\na scientific way\nso i'm like well where did she go\nhe's like well she went to sleep and she\ndidn't wake back up and i'm like okay\nso and and then what about like her body\nand he was like they burned her body and\nso in my\nin my mind i'm like they burned her body\nhuh you know so i'm thinking of all\nthese things and at the same time we\nwere preparing for\nher funeral which was a buddhist\nfuneral and i guess that was my first\num that was my first funeral for sure\nbut my first sort of\nspiritual encounter\nand at the same time my my grandmother\nwould take us to\nsunday school um to a christian church\nand so i would hear about you know how i\nwould hear about praying and praying to\njesus and god\nand so i was like so\nyou know i knew the story of jesus and\nnow i'm learning about buddha\nand i'm five and my grandmother\nhas passed away and they said that she's\nburned you know they burned her body\nand but i'm like but i don't think that\nshe just went\nyou know she's not gone so just from\nthat moment\ni was like almost even fascinated with\ndeath\nyou know and like okay not even\nnecessarily trying to figure it out but\njust kind of like\nyeah fascinating is the word and\nloss as well just you know always\ntrying to figure out what different\nfeelings mean\nand i remember when she passed\ni think one day after because we our\nwhole family would have to get together\nand practice\num like the ceremony\nwith for the offering of the incense and\neverything and\none day we were all doing that and i\nremember i went outside and i saw\nlike butterflies flying around and i was\nlike talking to the sky\nlike i literally remember being\nthis little baby and like\nout loud saying like you know talking to\ngod and saying\nyou know you can bring my grandmother\nback it's okay i won't be scared like if\nshe falls from the sky\nblah blah blah and then i saw two\nbutterflies go by and i was kind of like\nwhen they flew by i looked up\num in the window and my cousin\nmy older cousin was looking at me\ntalking to myself\nand so i was like okay but then i saw\nthe butterflies and\nsomething about that moment kind of made\nme feel like oh okay she's\nhere you know she didn't have to like\ndrop out of the sky type of thing\nand just from that moment on i don't\nknow i've always been\ncontemplative you know i've always when\ni was little even\ni'm the youngest of five or i grew up in\na household\nof five older i mean four older siblings\nso it was really loud and uh most of\nthat time i would\njust be like observing and just you know\ntrying to figure things out or just\nstaring at\nthings and just like i feel like really\ni was like meditating on them\nand now that i think about it but yeah\nso it really started at that moment\nthat was a wonderful story and and a\nwonderful sharing of that experience\nthank you and and it's amazing to see\nhow much you remember from when you were\nthat young yeah that's one of my most\nvivid memories and i've written it down\na few times\nthroughout my life to see like if it\never you know if it changed\nbut it doesn't it's i think it's i think\nthat was a real one that's wonderful and\nand i guess\nwhen was it where you started to realize\nthis connection between\nyour spiritual interests and music was\nthat always there from the beginning of\nwhen you started your music journey or\nwas that more when you felt a certain\nlevel of\npersonal growth and personal confidence\nin what you were finding\nwhen i first started my musical journey\ni was\n12 going on 13 and it was just fun\nit was you know i was traveling and\nmeeting new people and it was just more\nso fun for me i didn't really\nstart to incorporate my own personal\nstory into my music\nuntil i was started going through my\nfirst little\nheartbreaks you know and then when i had\nmy daughter\nby that time i had been through a few\nthings and\ni was really um focused on\nputting my real\nstory and my personal story into the\nmusic and\nyou know as as you get older you know\nthe more things that you go through\nso obviously having my daughter was a\nspiritual experience so\ni started you know making songs about\nthat and just my love for her\nand then when my brother passed in 2012\nthat was like a that was probably like\nthe most pivotal\nmoment um in my life but i also in my\nyou know music because i had so much to\nexpress and it was such a\nit was so changing you know what i mean\nit was something that really\nreworked my whole being and my whole\nperception of\nlife and you know family and love and\nall of these things\nand so as i started trying to\nfigure out my emotions and how i felt\nabout losing\nthe closest person to me i\nstarted you know like self-medicating\nand trying to escape and like\ntrying to forget about it and then\nobviously\ni'm like really small and\ni'm also just really sensitive um\nand so that took a toll on me for sure\nlike mentally physically\nspiritually and\nhaving a daughter and watching as she\ngot older\nit was you know i i\nrecognized the responsibility of having\nyou know a whole human being that i was\nreally\nsolely responsible for you know feeling\nphysically\nand mentally not all there because of\nwhat how i had\nbeen trying to heal myself with these\nsubstances\ni realized okay that's probably not the\nbest\nway to get through this and so you know\nthroughout my life\ni've read books about meditation\nand i've you know tried it and all these\nthings but\nonce i got to that point where i really\nwas like okay this is like a life or\ndeath situation then i really\nreally got into it and you know my music\nis just a reflection of me and what i'm\ngoing through at that time\nand so you know for the past\nseveral years that's what i've been\ngoing through you know\ntrying to heal and just\nevolve and ascend and you know be\nmy highest form of myself and\nso yeah i don't know if that answer did\ni did i stray from the question\nno you wanted to you you asked i i want\nto be honest with you\nthat sitting here listening to you it's\ntransforming internally for me\nlike it's it's wonderful to hear you\nthink through and\nhear about reflecting on pivotal moments\nin your life because\nnone of them sound easy and\nyou're going through them so young and\nso to hear you actually\nshare them in this way i'm hoping that\neveryone who's listening and watching\nright now is feeling the same way\nthat that they're feeling like they can\nreflect on their own life\nand and find how these moments have made\nthem stronger or made them\nmore reflective or more meditative or\nmore introspective because as you said\nall of these\nthings that are happening are just\ntrying to\nhelp us learn something and help us find\nsomething more about ourselves\nright and so when i hear you say that\nit was that moment when meditation\nbecame more real for you\nuh what else do you think happened at\nthat moment that you feel like at such a\nyoung age you've been able to develop\nthat curiosity but also resilience and\nthat strength of\nwho you are i think a very pivotal\nmoment in my life\nwas and i don't even remember\ni think i was just in a bookstore and i\nliked\ni was probably in the astrology section\nand right across from it was the eastern\nreligion and i saw a\ntic not han book pieces every step\nand at that point i was probably like 17\nor 18.\nand i just i think i just liked i just\nliked\ni just liked that you know that title\nand i read it probably in two or three\ndays\nand when i was younger i used to read\nbooks like that but\nat that age 17 i wasn't reading books\nyou know\nespecially in two or three days and it\nwas so simple\nso poetic and i applied it immediately\nand i just i just felt\ni just felt good you know i felt good i\nfelt\nhappy and from there on i would always\nget his new books and give them to\npeople\nand i think with meditation\nit was the same thing when i when i felt\nhow it made me feel then i was like okay\nthis is something that\ni want to exercise i want to practice\nthis because\ni can feel you know physically mentally\nspiritually everything i i just feel\nbetter\nthe reason why i love tiknyathan he\nstates things so simply that anyone\ncould\ncouldn't understand and\nthe beautiful stories he tells to\narrive to the lesson that he's teaching\nit just makes it so much more impactful\nfor me and\ni love his meditations as well there's\nso simple you know the red light\nmeditation take that moment to\nto breathe into your belly things like\nthat that have helped me\npractice more of a meditation\nas more of a way of living and not just\nlike\nmeditate every day for this amount of\ntime it's more like\nbreathing through every moment\ndifficult or not you know and you know\nit's something that\ni'm not perfect at or the best at or\neven maybe\neven in the top you know percentage of\npeople that are great at it\num but it's something that like i said\nas i get older and things get\neven more real it\ncomes in handy for sure can you share\nwith our listeners the red light\nmeditation so that they understand it\nmore and then they can apply it too\nokay so tiknit han says um\ninstead of viewing it like you're in\ntraffic you have to understand that you\nare the traffic\nwhen i read that i was like\nand i personally love to drive\num they do i view it as a sort of a\nmeditation\nand because i'm just in that moment\ndriving i'm not thinking of anything\nbecause i'm a safe a really safe driver\nand probably a slow driver\ntoo so the red light meditation\nis every time you arrive at a red light\nyou come home to yourself\nyou take that red light as a bell of\nmindfulness\nto you know send to yourself instead of\nviewing it as oh this red light is\nmaking me late and letting it frustrate\nyou\num it's more it's a moment to take for\nyourself\nand just breathe yeah or\nthat's how i take it yeah that's\nwonderful we definitely share a love for\ntiknot han\nin in a special way i think he's\nabsolutely phenomenal in the\nthe books that he's written the work\nthat he's done and\nthat example is a perfect synopsis of\nwhy he's so powerful because it takes a\nvery simple concept and something that\nwe all deal with on a daily basis and\nturns it from how we usually view it to\nsomething that's so much\nmore profound and meaningful for each\nand every one of us\nand i think that's almost like what what\nall of us need to become is every day we\nneed to be able to take these very\nordinary\ndaily things and turn them into these\nextraordinary experiences\nrather than the other way around and so\nyeah thank you for sharing that i love\nthat i hope everyone's going to try that\nespecially in l.a traffic yeah uh i'm i\nlove driving too so i i feel i\nyou know when you said that i was like i\nfeel the same way i can go on a long\ndrive for hours\nand just feel completely you know\nsatisfied\nand fulfilled and hit as many red lights\nas i have to yes\nexactly and i love what you said then by\nthe way there's no one who's\nthe perfect meditator or you know we're\nall learning and working and figuring it\nout and\nand what i love about meditation is that\nwhen you feel you've reached a level\nthere's just another level\nyeah and there's just always this\ncontinuous awakening\nand i want to talk about how you've put\nso much\nintention into your creative expression\nbecause\nyou're not just making music you're\nactually creating art to help people\nheal\ni was watching this video on youtube and\nanyone who's\nlistening or watching right now you can\ngo and check it out uh it was your\nexperience you you designed an immersive\nexperience\nuh wisdom la yes and\ni loved it because you had everyone like\nlying down\nand looking up and these absolutely\nphenomenal designs that look like the\ninside of someone's mind\nand then you were playing the sound ball\nand the harp and\nchanting and and uh and singing and i\nwas just like\nwow like this is a healing experience\ntell us about how\nhow you came to create that and feel\nthat that was how you wanted to share it\nyes that was a dream come true\nthat hopefully i can take on tour sooner\nthan later\nso\nwhen i was probably around the same time\ni will start reading tiknot han\nthere is a store that my father\nloves that's it's not there anymore huh\nin santa monica but they have\nyou know a bun lots of sound bowls and\nit's like a spiritual you know new age\nstore\nand there was a tibetan singing bowl i\npicked it up\nstarted playing it um not\nto its full sound i guess because the\nthe owner came up to me like let me show\nyou how to do it i'm like wow and then i\nimmediately understood what he was\nsaying\nand i was just like oh my god this is\nthe best\nfeeling ever literally like i loved the\nfeeling of\nmy wrists going in a circle and\nobviously loved the sound\nand how it was making me feel so i\nbought one and then i kept buying them\nand i would just\nyou know play them when i was feeling\naway or\njust when i was bored even just because\ni loved how they\nsound and how they make me feel and\nfast forward to maybe five\nyears ago my friend chrissy sent me a\npicture\nof this woman with all of these really\npretty crystal balls\nand i was like what like what are these\ncuz i've seen the big white crystal\nballs but i had never seen them like\nso iridescent and just like in all these\ncolors\nand and sizes and\nso i looked it up and i found the\ncompany and\nat the same time you know have been\nworking on music\nand\ni guess even my my album before chalumbo\ni wanted to incorporate more acoustic\ninstruments um\nyou know live drums live flute live\nand i would collect these instruments\nfrom like different festivals and\ndifferent places that i would travel\nbecause i just felt like you could feel\nthem more than\nthe you know computer sounds and\nso so i'm already incorporating those\ninto the music and then now i find these\nbowls\nand i'm just like duh like this is this\nis what i have to\nthey're they're so easy for me to play\nand i thought they were easy for\neveryone to play but i've\nactually seen you know i have friends\ntry and they're like\nand i'm like oh my god maybe this is my\ninstrument you know\nand so of course yes i'm gonna\nput it in the music so\npeople would always come up to me and\nlet me\nknow share stories about how my music\nhelped them\nget through something or help them you\nknow make a decision\nor just you know all these things that\nfelt so much more than\njust someone saying oh like you're a\ngreat singer or oh you're so pretty or\nwhatever it would always be\nyou know we would like a lot of times\nend up crying together\nbecause we you know this their stories\nare so like\num touching to me and they're always\nthey'll always say your\nyour music really helped me and when i'm\ncreating the music\nit's really just to get through you know\nwhat i'm going through and helping me\nyou know express myself and transform\nwhatever the feeling is\ninto some type of art and it's a release\nfor me\nso i started to realize that the reason\nwhy i'm\nso compelled to share that is because\ni think the per my purpose or one of my\npurposes\nis to help people deal you know to\nto and and heal you know deal in him\nand when i discovered these crystal\nsound balls\nand started playing them and then seeing\nhow beautiful they were\ni knew i wanted to incorporate it into\nmy live shows\nthe thing is they\nare not just for any type of show\nany type of setting um you have to be\nindoors so that you can\nyou know feel the acoustics exactly so\ni was doing a lot of festivals at the\ntime and then there was like\ncertain theaters that i was performing\nand it just\nthe the venues were not equipped for\nthese bowls\nand i'm like how do i like take this on\nthe road\nlike you know am i gonna do small shows\nand just little yoga studios like what's\nhow am i gonna do this\nand my sister right i think my sister\nshe sent me\na link to wisdom we\nwent there and the owners ended up being\nthere and then they're like oh you know\nthey knew who i was and i'm like oh my\ngod i want to do\nsomething here i want to do like a sound\nbath slash you know\nconcert slash like visual thing\nand like you said they have these like\nit's an immersive experience\nwhere you just lay back and it feels\nlike you're in virtual reality but\nyou're\nit's it's real it's reality and\nbecause you're in a dome it feels like\nyou're traveling through whatever you're\nlooking at and i'm like this is perfect\nfor the bowls because that's how the\nbowls\nmake you feel even without having a\nvisual in front of you or\neven when your eyes are closed so we got\ntogether\nand we put this show together i\nforgot to mention my sound bowl mentor\nher name is jerelyn glass\nshe's like she's amazing she\nbasically started to teach me about\nthe healing aspects of these bowls\nand just music in general and sound in\ngeneral\nsomething i'm still learning i am\nstill studying and this experience i\nknew that i wanted to\ntravel with and i just wanted it to be a\npart of all of my shows so i started to\nbring like\nother um smaller bowls to venues even\nwhen they said like this\nit's probably not gonna sound good i'm\nlike let's just try like at least\nwe tried and we can say that we try it\num\nbut yeah i've i started having these i\nthis idea of like\na lot of people listen to\nother a lot of other types of music to\nlike distract themselves\nbut that is no solution you know to\ndistract yourself so i'm like if i can\ngive people\nexperiences like this and music like\nthis that\nyou know you maybe you do want to just\nput it on to\nforget about what you're going through\nor whatever but when you're listening\nthere's that intention there and that\nreal healing\nin there that is really gonna resonate\nwithin\nyour body and your spirit and actually\nhelp you know and help center you or\nground you or\nyou know whatever it is really that you\nturned on the song for that's what it's\ngonna it's gonna help\nyeah i recommend everyone go and watch\nthe video\nand try and imagine you're in the\nexperience yeah\nbecause i think like i was saying this\nto you before we started\nand i really do mean it that when i\nstarted coming across\nmantra and frequency and\nvibration and these conversations around\nhow\nhealing could take place through music\nand through words and through language\nnow i can't sing to save my life so i've\nalways\ndeeply prayed and wanted for\nincredibly talented musicians uh\nto hopefully one day use their platform\nto do that because i just think that\nmusic's the most powerful thing in the\nworld\nand as you said it's it can just be a\ndistraction or it can truly be something\nthat deeply touches the heart and\nyeah and heals the heart even more than\njust touching and\nand uh to see you do it is just\nextremely hope giving for me\nuh and and and by the way and it's\ndifferent for different people like and\nthis sounds totally random\nand strange but like for me growing up\nlistening to rap music was extremely\nhealing\nyeah uh because for me being able to\nlisten to someone who had a tougher\nexperience than i did\nbut giving me the permission to be able\nto express how i felt\nand so i would sit and write poetry or\nspoken word when i was younger\nagain i can't sing but i would i would\nwrite and i would share and i would\nthink\nand i think even now when i journal or\nwhen i wrote my book or\neven when i do the podcast for me\nlanguage is so powerful and words are so\npowerful\nand when you put that to music or you\nput that to sound right\nit's it's out of this world and so yeah\ni felt like that was a universal\nexperience\nthat you were putting people into there\nwas there's also the other one that i've\nused of viewers before which was the\nuh the one that was for triggers yes yes\nand and that's another great example of\nhow you're creating stuff that's very\nspecific for people\ntell us about tell us about why you\ncreated that one and where that one\nokay so i was working on my album\nwhich just means i'm living life and\ncreating music at the same time i\nwas going through a period of time where\ni felt very triggered\nand when i was\nat the peak of feeling triggered i\nrecorded a song\ncalled triggered and it was a freestyle\nand i just kind of just like\nlet it all out and immediately after i\nfelt\nyou know a release and i felt calm\nand i was working with my samples at the\ntime as well\nand i'm like i'm gonna do a\nmantra or a song we call it\nmodern mantra yeah that can hopefully\nhelp\npeople not reach that point of feeling\nenraged or chaotic or\nyou know out of control because i know\nfor me i can\ncreate a song when i'm feeling like that\nbut you know other people\nneed other outlets or a lot of the times\nthey'll they will turn to\num music my intention was to have it be\nwhen you feel triggered turn this on\nand i use it for myself too like i still\ndo\nlike on the plane and stuff like that\nwhat if i just need to calm down for\nanything\ni'm like oh this this actually is\nworking because i got with my\nsoundboard teacher jarelyn and picked\nbowls that were very intentional\nyou know picked notes and alchemies of\nthe bowls that were\nreally going to aid in how it resonates\nwithin everyone that listens to it so\nyeah yeah i know it works it's it's\nawesome like i said i've i've used it\ni've shared it with people i\ni think it's beautiful and again if\nyou're listening or watching we'll put\nthe links to all of this\nuh that i'm recommending because i'd\nlove for you to use it and i'd love for\nyou to share with janae and i\non instagram how you're finding it uh\nbecause i think these are just really\npowerful tools like we always need\nsomething i\ni often say to people like when you're\nhungry\nyou don't panic because you know if you\neat that you'll be satisfied\nbut when we're anxious or when we're\ntriggered or when we're\nnervous or when we're stressed we just\ncreate more panic because we haven't yet\nfound the tool the\nsubstance the mindset that satiates that\nhunger\nand so but we have to view it the same\nthere's there's no need to panic it's\nabout finding that\nyeah it's about finding that uh\nconnection of of what activity or\nmindset can help\nhelp with that kind of circling back to\nyou talking about your roots and\nobviously this album being called\nchalumbo which is your surname\nyour family name it's it's interesting\nthat we started talking about roots\nand and you can see that in your work\nagain of going that tell us about the\nimportance of using that name yeah and\nand why that was so\nsymbolic for you right now yeah my\nfather\nchose the name chalumbo for himself\nwhen he was in his 20s i believe\nand growing up i don't remember when i\nlearned that but it was it was pretty\nearly\nand i don't know it made me feel like\ndisconnected from it and then being in\nschool people would\num not really make fun of it but they\ncouldn't pronounce it\nand so it was kind of just like always\nannoying to me\nand i always would say i can't wait to\nget married so i could change my last\nname\nbut as i got older i really started to\nlove it and love how it sounds and love\nhow it looks\nand i started asking my dad more\nquestions about\nwhy he chose that name and\nhe has lots of different um\nbreakdowns of why he chose the name the\nspelling\neverything and then\ndoing my own research i found out it was\na word and i believe is\nuh pronounced chichua i'm not sure how\nyou pronounce it but it's a language\nit's an african language\nand chilombo means wild beast\nin that language and i was like oh\nthat's cool\ni like that i like that and so i for me\nit was\nall kind of like a metaphor for me like\naccepting myself and really\nacknowledging all the different parts of\nmyself that make me who i am\nand embracing my wildness\nand embracing all that i am whether\npeople\ndon't understand it whether they can't\npronounce it whether they think that\ni'm not really connected to that last\nname\nbecause it's not you know because my\nfather\nchose it himself um so yeah that was me\njust embracing all that i am\nand the fact that it means wild beasts\ni loved because i love dragons\ni was born in 1988 which is the year of\nthe dragon\nand just dragons are like cool obviously\ni always wanted to be in the year of the\ndragon\ni'm 1987. oh so i just missed out\nalmost but no i just i think it's a\nbeautiful creature but it can be\ndestructive but it's also graceful and\ni'm just like yes i feel like i'm all of\nthese things\nand i feel like chalumbo represents\nall of these things and i feel like the\nalbum also represents all of these\nthings it's not just me\npretending to be perfect and you know\ni'm just healing this healer\nyou know it's like i'm going through\nthese real things and i'm\ndealing with them and i'm practicing how\nto heal\nand it's just you know all of that\ncoming together\nis chalumpo\nthat's a beautiful definition i love\nthat\nyeah it's it's uh yeah it's so\ninteresting because i guess we live in a\nworld of\nchosen names as well whether people are\nactors or musicians\nor you know and and the fact that your\nfather chose a name\nit's it is it is almost powerful to come\nup with our own names in our own\nidentities or because so often we don't\nfeel connected\nright or we don't have a vision or a\nor a symbol for who we are and and it's\nalmost like getting closer to that is\nsuch a powerful thing because we've\nrealized that\nicons and symbols and visuals are so\nimportant in our lives whether it's as\nsimple as an emoji or\nwhether it's a real you know it's a real\nemblem of who we stand for and what we\nare like but we see mascots we see that\nvisualizing of who we are everywhere and\nsometimes the only visual we don't have\nis of us\nfacts yeah it's it's it's nice to hear\nthat definition of\nchalambo we also came up with um me and\nmy dad\nwho i've gotten closer to as an adult\num we came up with our own little\nbreakdown of it\nso chi life energy voice\nl yeah um so love yeah the l is for love\num yes the sound of the universe\nbe which comes from the foot in\negyptian hieroglyphics\nis the base foundation\nand then oh is everything and nothing\nall\nencompassing circle of life yes circle\nof life\nand so that's how we broke down che\nlumbo\nwhich you can find uh if you order a\nphysical copy of chalumbo\nwe have like a little insert that like\nbreaks it all down\ni love that without all my extra words\nyeah no i love that i love that that's\nso right all of the all of the\nbreakdowns of it is\nperfect it's got such a it's got such a\ndeep meaning\nand i love that you said the physical\ncopy because i remember\nstanding outside we had a store in in\nthe uk where i grew up in london\ncalled hmv and i remember like standing\noutside hmv to buy like\nthe cd when it came out and like i loved\nlooking at artwork and\nand just you know opening it up and\nseeing album covers and\nall of that so i totally when you said\nyeah get the real cover\nyeah the physical there's there's\ndefinitely something in that but but\nthat definition so beautiful we should\nwe should create a beautiful instagram\nthere must be an instagram graphic that\nyou've created there is i did pass\nyeah i did post it the definition yeah\nyeah oh beautiful okay\ni think i posted the actual graphic of\nwhat we put\nin the yeah but i don't know i think\nthere's you know i like to\nlike you said hold things and see fill\nthem\nyeah talking about that when you\nmentioned orm there being the sound of\nthe universe like\nwhat do you think is a message that the\nuniverse has had for you over and over\nagain that\nyou've been learning surrender\num let go\nprobably yeah which\nsame thing but let go and i'm constantly\nbecause that's constantly in my\nhead but i don't think it's it might i\nthink it's coming from\nthe universe um\nlet go and love love\nit's definitely has a o in it let go or\nlove just be\ni i think i i think that i get a lot of\nmessages from\nfrom the universe um one thing that i\nused to do\nwhen i was younger that i didn't\nunderstand was probably\nconsidered now a meditation is i would\nsit in the sun because it felt good\nand just breathe and every time\n[Music]\nafter maybe five minutes\ni would start getting these um\nvery clear\nin my head they were just like one\nliners you know it would be like\nlike a little quote yeah almost and i\nwould be like what you know it might\njust\nit didn't feel like i was thinking of\nthem it just felt like they were coming\nto me\nand it's something that i still do now\nthat just feel like little downloads\nfrom\nthe universe from the sun from just\nthe atmosphere i don't know um\nso yeah when i do that and when i'm\nreally there in that moment breathing is\njust very clear\nmessages that i usually write down i\nused to tweet them\num at one point when i was younger and\nthen i\nfelt like i couldn't give it\naway as soon as i got it i had to like\nprocess it\nprocess it and meditate on it and and\nreally understand\nwhat what does that mean and so now i do\nthat a lot more\ni still write them down for myself but\num yeah\ni love that you when i'm when i'm\nhearing you speak today like i feel like\nand obviously this has taken work but\nyou feel very in touch with your\nintuition\nand your like inner voice tell us about\nthat journey because i think a lot of\npeople who listen\nsometimes struggle with like well i\ndon't know whether this is really my\nintuition or whether it's my ego\nor whether it's my inner voice or\nactually is it just my mind that's just\nhow yeah tell us a bit about how you\nclarify the difference between the two\nfor yourself and how you've become\ncloser to your intuition\nyeah i think that is more of a recent\ndevelopment within myself um\n[Music]\ni think naturally when i was younger in\nlike grade school\nit was my intuition and i knew it but as\ni got older and more\njaded by life i\nthe voices grew and it was they\nmultiplied and\ni just felt like oh my god i'm crazy you\nknow\nand then in the line of work that i do i\njust\nhad started to started to get a lot of\nanxiety about things and just really\ndoubt myself um\nand i feel like people close to me\nrecognize it and me and my two friends\nari and felicia we decided to go\non a trip to the esselyn institute have\nyou heard of that i have\ni haven't been there it's amazing um but\na little retreat\nand she got me this book\ncalled i think this i think i remember\nthe name of the\nsilencing your inner critic because she\nwas doing my makeup at the time and you\nknow it would always she would see me so\nstressed\nbefore shows or after shows and i would\nbe like\nhow was it like oh i felt like you yeah\nyou know i'll just be like so\nfrustrated and she she\nwe never talked about it she just like\ngave me that book so i'm like oh okay\nyou\nsee that i'm dealing with something\nright now um\nand really that book had so many great\num points and really helps me realize\nthat i'm not\nthese voices i'm the observer of these\nyou know i'm\ni'm i'm listening i'm not the i'm not\nthem\nyou know and so\nfrom that point on of reading that book\ni started\nlistening to my thoughts differently and\nsaying okay hi\nokay that's fine but you know\nyou don't decide you know who i am or\nhow i feel\nand reading\nmore books that are you know um just\nstarted yours\num you're familiar with dr\njoel dispenza he's been on the podcast\ntoo oh amazing\namazing um becoming supernatural\num the seven spiritual laws of success\num oh gosh there's an audiobook that i'm\nlistening to that i don't remember the\nname of right now but\njust practicing because i was once again\nrealizing that\nthe habit of um listening to these\nvoices in my head and letting them\ncontrol how i feel about myself and how\ni\nmove daily um i was mindful enough\nto see that it was not the best you know\nit wasn't the best practice so\nnow i just practice\nyou know the right things no i practice\num doing things that\ni feel like are best for me and my\ndevelopment as\na person um more audiobooks\nin the car opposed to music\nor no music um\nyeah silence i draft there's never\nreally silence\nalso i realize there's always something\nsomething\ngoing on but that i love like natural\num yeah it can be really hard though and\nit's just something that you have to\nkeep\npracticing we uh\nusually end every episode with something\ncalled the final five\nthis is a fast five round which means\nevery answer is either one word or one\nsentence maximum\none word or one sentence correct okay\nokay are you ready no i love the honesty\nyou're the only person who's ever said\nthat to me i love that i love how honest\nyou are let me prepare myself for\nfastness okay for speed okay\nokay i'm ready\nare you ready yes okay janae aiker this\nis your first\nfive the first question is what has\nhelped your\nmental health this year sleep\ni love you that is a great answer i i\ncouldn't i\ni say that to people all the time\nliterally if we just slept well\nso many gone yeah karen you rest yes\nrest\nso like sleep slash rest cause\nyes i think a good sleep is like when\nyou're really resting\nand because you know have you ever had\nlike a\nsleep where you wake up and you don't\nfeel like you were actually asleep 1000\nyeah so\nokay rest is what i would wonderful\nsecond question how do you personally\nrefuel\nafter pouring your heart into an album\nwhat happened sleep sleep again\nhow do i refuel after you put your after\nyou because i read i read that you were\nsaying that you put your\nyou know you were like physically\nmentally emotionally spiritually like\nit's\nit's draining to create a work of art\nlike\nyou could say rest again that's how do i\nrefuel\nhonestly rest great okay\nyou can't give rest as the answer that's\nanother rule i should add\nto the fast five about you can't give\nthe same answer to more than one\nquestion all right\nthird question uh what's the biggest\nlesson you've learned in the last 12\nmonths\nit's not rest it's not maybe it is\nmaybe it is it can be right the biggest\nlesson i learned\nin the last 12 months through\ndifficult situations\nwhen my energy feels all tangled up\ninside of me\nis rather than\ntry to get through it with that anxious\nenergy\nto slow down and to breathe\nthrough those moments uh\nsomething that i've knew sort of the\nidea of before and like read about like\nokay\nyou know but i think the last 12 months\nhave really\ntaught me that lesson because i used to\nget\nreally anxious and then it would just\nbuild on top of\nyou know the anxiety the energy would\njust build on that\ninstead of me just saying okay let's\nbring it in slow down the biggest lesson\nto breathe through it\nquestion number four uh what's something\nthat you're confident about\nthat others may disagree with you on or\nsomething that you're sure about that\nother people may not wrap their head\naround fully\nthere's nothing cuter\nnothing more precious\nor magnificent as a cat\ncats are and i mean felines like\nlions tigers domestic house cats\num jaguars pumas\nmountain lions um all of the cats are\nthey're the best yeah when you extended\nthe family i could i could get in you\nsee\nand that's what people don't understand\nabout house cats is that they're just\nlittle tigers and lions like who doesn't\nwant to experience that in there i\nalways wanted a little cub like always\nso get a cat yeah or a lion\nyeah probably all right\nfifth and final question okay i'm gonna\ntry to do this one fast okay\nif you if you could create one law\nthat the whole world had to follow what\nwould it be\nit would be to share\nshare your food share your home\nshare your ideas share everything\nand it'll be always in exchange and no\none would go\nwithout that's a beautiful answer very\nunique we've never
