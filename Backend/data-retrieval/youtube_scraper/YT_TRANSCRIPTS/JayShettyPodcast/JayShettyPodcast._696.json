    "transcript": "we sometimes hate to be the one that is\ninflicting pain\nor inflicting the misunderstanding and\nyou don't\nyou don't mean to do it of course but\ni think that life just books\nexperience relationships they all teach\nyou like\nunderstanding comes with understanding\nyourself and understanding\nothers as well but i do think that you\nhave to have this level of understanding\nfor self like oh i know that i do that\nit's probably wrong but\nwhen you see it you have to like be able\nto call it out\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health and wellness\npodcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you i want to thank you\nfor having stayed with us throughout\n2020 for using us\nas your source of insight inspiration\nand support during this really really\ntough time\nand i want to share with you why i think\ntoday's guest is going to help us\ngo even deeper into an understanding of\nourselves\ntoday i'm speaking with someone who\nneeds no introduction\nbut we'll be talking today about\nmotherhood and feeling powerful\nand her new incredible music kelly is a\nmusician\nactor and tv personality well known for\nalso being a coach on the x factor\nthis year kelly released new hits like\ncoffee crazy and hitman and i just saw\nthe music video for that and it's\nepic and most exciting of all kelly is\npreparing to welcome\nher second child very very soon\nkelly thank you so much for doing this\ni'm so grateful to finally\nbe talking with you i'm so excited to be\ntalking to you\nuh i literally feel like i know you and\nyour beautiful wife\ni can't i can't wait for us to actually\nmeet we we started connecting and\ninteracting earlier this year\nand you know for me obviously for me and\nmy wife we've been long long long term\nfans\nand to see you just share\nsuch positive energy and insight and\ndiving into difficult conversations i\nwas so drawn to that and attracted to\nhow you were\nusing your platform for that and i'm so\nglad we get to share this space together\ntoday\nme too i'm i'm so excited and\ni think i've been waiting for our\nconversation so\ni'm just happy that it's presented\nitself today for sure\nyeah absolutely and i wanted to start\nbecause we are in the holiday season\nand i do think it's always nice to\ncelebrate and be optimistic around\nthe things that are around us and you\nrecently starred in and\nexecutive produced a new movie called\nmerry little christmas\nand and i wanted to ask you like what\nexcites you about the holiday season\nafter so many years or\nwhat is it what are you doing for the\nkids to to make it feel\nspecial and different you know what i\njust remember being a kid\nand um we didn't have much you know\ngrowing up and i remember\nmy mom and i living with my great aunts\nand\nyou know wanting something as simple as\num\nthey were all in rocking chairs so i\nliterally\nwanted i asked for a red rocking chair\nlike my aunt lillian i literally wrote\nthat to santa and said that that's what\ni wanted\num so when it came to christmas i just\nremember\nnever really asking for a whole lot i\ni knew that we couldn't really do it and\nso when i had\nmy son i went crazy\ni went a little crazy with the presents\num but i like i\ni realize i've had to scale it back a\nbit just so he can understand\nhow important um giving is\njust as much you know as like we love\nreceiving things but\nhow important uh giving is so that was\nalways a really big thing in my\nhousehold\nand um then i started growing up\nwatching all these holiday movies and\nhow like i just wanted a piece of like\nall these movies like in my life\nand so to be able to have those\nexperiences and then be able to\nyou know executive producing star in a\nchristmas movie\nis really kind of mind-blowing and just\nlike sends me\ninto a whole like oh my gosh this is\nawesome so\ni don't take um any opportunity for\ngranted for sure\ni love that i love that and uh yeah i\nlook forward to watching it i'm really\nlooking forward to\nmy wife going to watch it together we've\nbeen i'm so glad that it's december now\nwhere i feel like i'm finally allowed to\nstart watching festive movies put up put\nthe music on and so\ni'm really looking forward to it but you\nknow obviously everyone's celebration's\ndifferent this year\nand something that you celebrated this\nyear is that you did your\nbaby shower work virtually i believe\nwhich is obviously different to what\nyou've done before\ntell us how different that was and and\nwhat that experience was like now living\nit\nin this year and how you were able to do\nit in such a meaningful and beautiful\nway\nyou know what i mean for so many of us\nout out here i think that um\nwhen we are having these moments where\nwe keep thinking about i know for me i\nkeep thinking about the fact that we're\njust in our homes and\nwe have everything we we need you know\nbut i can't help but to think about\nother people who don't have everything\nthat they need so what can i do\ni'm not the only person having a baby\nyou know what i mean not the only person\npreparing for it\nso if i know that's the truth like what\nelse can i do\nand i've been doing work with a baby to\nbaby and been an\nangel a baby to baby angel for a couple\nyears now\nand just seeing firsthand what they do\nand what we do together as a community\nof of women and together as a community\nas well when we have of course the\nfundraisers and everything\nit's necessary you know what i mean the\nwork is necessary\nessentials essential basic needs for\nkids\nand their families is necessary\num no child asked to come into this\nworld and when we get uh gifted the\nresponsibility of a child\nyou know and life happens or\ncircumstances happen\num i think that it's our job to care for\neach other as best as we can\nand that's what we do over at baby to\nbaby and i just really wanted to do that\nbecause i\nliterally had everything from titan's\nbirth\nso i'm just like i got a crib okay what\nelse can i get and i'm just like i'll\njust get it you know what i mean and\nand i just wanted to do that for someone\nelse i love that i i love that we\nhaven't even been talking for like five\nminutes\nand all you've been talking about is\ngiving\nand supporting and serving and i love\nthat because it's just\nyour heart and and it just emanates from\nyou and\nwe we were speaking briefly when before\nwe started recording and even when you\ncame on and\nyou said my name and you said it in a\nway that we knew each other and i felt\nthat i was like you know i love that\nfor you it feels like gratitude\nand service and giving just feel like\nsuch central pillars\nhave has that always been the case or\nwas this something you had to work on\nand develop or where did that come from\nfamily faith being in a position\nwhere um i've not had everything you\nknow what i mean\nand knowing what that felt like\num wanting help and some and sometimes\nnot wanting to say\nwhat it is that i needed you know what i\nmean\num and just watching my\nmy mom worked really hard you know and i\nhad i had two moms growing up\nyou know what i mean i had my mom of\ncourse who\num god rest her soul and i watched her\nwork\nwork her butt off and then i had uh\nbee's mom\nbeyonce's mom tina and i watched her\nwork so i had these two dynamics of\nof motherhood and women and focus\nand everything and i just feel really\nblessed by that because they both taught\nme to give\nand they taught me to be a cheerful\ngiver and i think my faith\nof course above anything has made me a\ncheerful cheerful giver\nbut i love it you know what i mean it it\nmakes me\nfeel good um from the inside i i feel\nlike\num i feel like we're all here\nto serve a purpose and to be responsible\nand\num that makes me feel whole\nit's it's just it makes me feel whole\nyeah that's i i feel it that's so\nbeautiful it's uh\nit's amazing to hear that even though\nyou mentioned how\nyou know you started out with nothing\nand that even despite how your life has\nchanged it seems like the thing that\ngives you the greatest joy is still\ngiving and supporting and serving others\nwhich is so beautiful how was it\nhow was it growing up with two\nincredible\nrole models because it sounds like that\nwas such a special thing to see\ntwo women that were so powerful\nprofessionally focused but also able to\ninspire you in that way what was that\nexperience like to be honest my\nrelationship with my mom even as a kid\nwas\nreally interesting to say the least\nwe all have those stories but i always\nwatched her\ngive i always watched her give in church\nin service um and\ni think that that like she's the one\nthat solidified the faith-giving for me\nand then um when it came to\nwatching her sacrifice i don't think i\nreally appreciated her sacrifice jay\ntill she passed\nso like i had this moment um maybe two\nor three years\nafter her passing where i said oh my\ngosh that's why she did that\nyou know what i mean and i literally\ntook this moment and i was quiet and i\nsaid a prayer and i just told her thank\nyou for the sacrifice now i get it i\nknow what that took i know how hard it\nwas\nand it was so much forgiveness there\nand i didn't realize how much i needed\nit\nand it was necessary for life\nso between that and then the dynamic\nwith my mama t\nas i call her uh my mama t was just\nalways given and when it came to um\nwhether it was tithing in church or\num like even recently there's uh\na young woman who's building a charity\nand she's doing it in a specific way\nthat\nyou know we really um respect and and\nlove and she was like\nwe need to really help this with this\nwoman out because she just don't know\nwhat she gonna do\nshe explains everything like okay okay\nokay let's just get it done\nyou know what i mean like to this day\nlike i i'm grown and i'm still\ngetting these calls like no no no this\nneeds to happen\nmake sure you do it today baby because\nshe needs to make sure that she's you\nknow what i mean it's like\nit's that and after all these years\nit's still like that and it's still\nimportant and it's even more important\nnow because\ni have a child and having another child\nand you are the first\nexample i love what you said there that\neven though you realized it was after\nyour mother passed away\nof her sacrifice that you\nstill took that moment to express a\nprayer and\ngratitude and thanks to her even then\nand i think that's such a beautiful\npowerful message for all of us if anyone\nwho's listening or watching\nhas lost someone this year or in the\npast and\nobviously it's never easy whether it was\nthis year or any year\nand i just want you to take a note from\nwhat kelly just said is that you can\nstill pray uh send loves and gratitude\nto that person\nwhether they're still physically present\nor not and i think that that is\nthat's such a beautiful way to live\nbecause uh\ni i've spoken about it a couple of times\nabout how i lost\nuh my one of my greatest spiritual\nmentors in my life who was like a father\nto me\nhe passed away this year after suffering\nfrom stage four brain cancer\nso he didn't pass from covid and it was\nit was so hard because i couldn't go\nback for his funeral\nuh because because of covid and so i\ncouldn't actually see\nhim before he passed away or i couldn't\nobviously go to his funeral which i\nreally wanted to attend\nand the only thing that's really helped\nme go through of course\nfaith but the understanding that\ntrying to be what he wants me to become\nand the qualities that he\nhad in his heart that keeps him alive\nfor me and it makes him feel very real\nand with me and i think that\nyou know i think what you shared there\nis really really powerful and beautiful\nabout\neven though you noticed it afterwards\nyou were still able to to connect in\nthat way so thank you for sharing that\nof course of course of course yeah yeah\nno i really appreciate that i think it's\ngoing to help\ni think that's going to help a lot of\npeople\nthis year especially because everyone's\nlost something and people have lost\nsomeone and so\nyou know i think that's going to be\nreally powerful i want to switch to\ntalking about\nyour intention behind naming your\nchildren because i think it's so\nbeautiful and powerful and obviously\nyour son's called titan jewel which is\nlike\nwhat a powerhouse name uh and and i\nwanted to understand like how do you see\nnaming differently or like your\nintention behind how you\nselect names and i'm not going to ask\nyou to share any names or anything i\njust yeah\njust to understand that better with\ntitan's name\ni kept thinking about wanting to give\nhim strength that i felt like i didn't\nhave\nor a strength that i felt like i was\nlike still working on\nand here's how the universe works\nso my husband named him titan and i was\nlike what a great name he's like yeah i\nthink it'll be great\nand then my husband's father was named\nhis middle name was jewel so titan jewel\nand i kept thinking about oh he's the\njewel and you know our crown and all\nthis other kind of stuff\ni needed to hear his name at the time\nwhen i had him\nyou know what i mean just to remind\nmyself i was built for this\ni was ready for motherhood because i was\nnervous at first you know as\nyou know we all would be for parenthood\nperiod but\ni kept hearing his name and his name was\njust constantly like\nnot just feeding my life but feeding\neverything that i was doing in this\nweird way i don't think i've ever spoken\nabout this\nbut it just kept reminding me you know\nwhat i mean\nit was it was of course about his name\nwhich i feel like he is\nso strong head strong\nphysically strong just strong period\nbut um he reminds his space\nabout that everywhere that he goes it's\nso interesting\num but i i feel like intention is really\nimportant behind\nour children's names and and what does\nit mean and\nyou know who or or if it's somebody that\nyou even admire you know i kept thinking\nabout well what am i gonna name this\nbaby\nyou know what i mean and wrote down so\nmany different things and funny enough\nme and tylen i was in vancouver filming\nand titan was here i wrote down one of\nthe names\nand titan calls me and tells me that he\nwants to name\nthe baby this name and it was one of the\nnames that i wrote down\nno way that's amazing so i was like whoa\nit was so cool so he named the baby\ni was literally like this is perfect\ni love that i love that and and that's\nthat's so interesting though what you\nsaid there because i didn't think about\nit like that when i was asking the\nquestion and you were saying\nyou hadn't said that before or shared\nthat before around how\nactually the way you name your kid gave\nyou strength at a time when you needed\nit\nand and that's so powerful to think of\nit that way that\nwe always you i'm not a parent yet and\nyou know my wife and i look forward to\nwhen we can be and when\nwhen we choose to be but the idea of you\nalways think you're giving to your\nchildren but\nas as a mother and as i've heard from\nmany parents it's like so often the kids\nare teaching you\ni'm honestly constantly a student\nit's so interesting how like you are in\nthis space where you're like\ndoesn't matter if you're the parent\nthey're constantly teaching you\neverything i just feel like they're\nconstantly teaching you everything\nand he's made me a better person he's\nmade me a better\nuh woman he's made me a better business\nwoman\ni just feel like he's taught me a lot\nabout\nlove and forgiveness\nit's it's amazing and marriage has too\nby the way\ni mean just patience you have no choice\nbut i didn't think i had any patience\num no i'm serious i was like\nthis is not the first time like i felt\nlike a\nlike like a real big tension i was like\nthis is not gonna go well\nand my only understanding of figuring\nthings out is just to like dismiss them\ndo you know what i mean like to not\nhandle it or\ncommunicate it or talk it out so\ncommunication has been the longest\nfreaking\nroad of my life with\neverything\ngive us an example of something that you\nthink where you've seen that shift where\nsomeone could go oh i see that in myself\ntoo because i think there's a lot of\npeople nodding right now back at home or\nlistening and watching going\ni feel that like you know so many\nreminders tell us about a shift that you\nexperience\nmarriage\n[Laughter]\nmarriage first of all the\nthe oh gosh this it was just a a really\nbig misunderstanding\nand uh between my husband and i and i'll\nnever forget\num not saying\nexactly that i was wrong\n[Laughter]\nyou know what i mean because we i think\nthat sometimes like\nwe sometimes hate to be the one that is\ninflicting pain\nor inflicting the misunderstanding and\nyou don't\nyou don't mean to do it of course but\ni think that life just books\nexperience relationships they all teach\nyou like\nyou know you try to navigate your way\nthrough\npeople as as much as you can and and i\nthink that\nunderstanding comes with understanding\nyourself and understanding\nothers as well but i i do think that you\nhave to have this level of understanding\nfor self like oh i know that i do that\nit's probably wrong but\nwhen you see it you have to like be able\nto call it out\nand so when i was able to call it out\nand\ni i said what it was it was like he kind\nof looked at me like\ndid you just do that\nyou know what i mean and i i'll say that\ni'm wrong but\nbut this time i was like it was one that\ni didn't like about myself\nright it's always like that one thing\nyou're like oh\ni i wore that and that's really ugly\nlike i don't like that\nand and because you see it like and it's\nreally\nugly you don't like it and it just can't\npossibly exist in you but\nbut yes it can yeah it was a matter of\nseeing that\ncalling it out and just moving forward\nand apologizing and having humiliation\nand and\njust saying it's okay it's just a it's a\npart of it and\nyou know moving on that's so\ninteresting it's a it's like wearing a\nbad outfit and never wanting anyone to\nsee that picture ever again\nand you're like trying to hide it and\nand like facing it but but even more\ndeeper but\nthat's so interesting what you said that\nwe're scared to address things\nwhen we really don't like that about\nourselves\nand and often it comes out when\nit's also we're scared because it almost\nfeels like it's a weakness not a\nstrength like it feels like a weakness\nto be like\ni'm wrong i have this part of me that i\nwant to work on\nwhen actually that is strength right\nlike that is courage we would\nwe would encourage children to be honest\nwith us or we would encourage children\nto\ntell us when they feel uncomfortable\nwith something\nbut but yeah we get scared of that\nbecause we see it as a weakness\nand i i think you know i i think that\nthat's a really powerful lesson that\nyou're sharing with us all is that\nbe in in our relationships and this is a\nlittle practical activity for everyone\nwho's listening right now\nthis week observe your relationship with\nyour partner your\nparent your child whoever it is you want\nand\ndo you practice what kelly's just shared\nwith us look at something where you're\nscared of admitting that you're wrong\nand ask yourself is it because it's\nsomething you don't like about yourself\nand then reframe that as a strength to\nrealize that it's not a weakness it's\nactually a strength to address that\nbecause\nthat's a really powerful takeaway but\nit's hard though y'all\nit's hard and and the truth is it's like\nyou may not\nsee it at first and sometimes it takes a\nwhile or sometimes it takes a couple\nyears and you know when you do finally\nsee it\njust call it out and it hasn't it has no\nno no space in an it has no\nspace in a negative way in any part of\nyour life because if it shows up in one\nplace it's going to show up everywhere\nelse\nin some sort of way and i just i didn't\nwanted to do that\nand i was like oh gosh like i didn't\nwant it to do that\nyou're right we have to be patient with\nourselves and hopefully\nwe've surrounded ourselves with people\nthat are patient with us too\nyes because that's needed sometimes i\nknow there's plenty of things that\ni've got wrong in my relationship and\nradhi's been\nsuper patient with me about and\nand you know you need that you need\nsomeone who's patient with you and\nallows you to figure it out\nwhile you're figuring it out and i think\nsometimes we make the mistake of trying\nto fix the other person and\nchange them and it's almost like you\njust need to be patient while someone\nheals themselves you know it's like\nyou can't yeah you can't always be the\none to like engineer it perfectly for\nthem they\nsometimes they just need to feel that\nyou have patience and you're there for\nthem\nabsolutely absolutely yeah yeah\ntell me about one of the things that you\nmentioned uh with titan choosing\nyou know the name it's like so i\nremember i'm an older brother to my\nyounger sister my younger sister's about\nfour and a half years old\ni remember holding her since the moment\nshe was born and like\ncarrying her around and she was like my\nyou know she was like my\nmy favorite person in the world she\nstill is but but definitely when\nwhen we were kids i have really good\nmemories of being just old enough to\nto really interact with this and and i\nremember my parents\nthe way they prepared me was my mom\nwould say to me she was like pray for a\nlittle friend that's going to come into\nthe world like pray every day and so\nevery day for like since they knew she\nwas already pregnant\ni was praying for you know a little a\nlittle friend\nuh which ended up having him be my\nsister how have you\nprepared titan for what's to come or\nlike you know\nhow does that work or yeah how does that\nwork he's really preparing me\nhe's really preparing me because first\noff i\ni keep thinking about the fact that\ni i love him so much\nand for it's been what six yeah he's six\nyears old\nand for this long it's taken me to get\npregnant because i was like do i have\nthe capacity\nyou know for two i was like a little\nnervous about that and do i have the\npatience for two\nand this one day it was like last year\ni saw the way me and my husband were\njust doting over titan and it was just\nso much i was like this is just too much\ni feel like it's it's too much i think\nit's time to share some space here you\nknow what i mean so\nyou know that's when we started like\nhaving the initial conversations about\nhaving another one\nand um titan did a\nvideo this one day before school and he\ngoes i want a baby brother i want a baby\nsister\nand i said uh well\nwhich one do you want so you know what i\nmean he says\ni want a baby sister i want a baby\nbrother\ni said well i'm glad that you're open to\nboth\nbecause we don't know what's going to\nhappen you know what i mean\nyeah whatever as soon as we found out\nthat we were pregnant\nwe waited a while until i had like a\nlittle bump\num and we finally sat him down and told\nhim and\nhis reaction which i do want to share um\non instagram because it's really sweet\num he was so delighted to share\nhis space and excited because this is\nwhat got me\nit just broke me he goes i won't be\nlonely anymore\nhe felt like when he goes like\nhe's he's still in the bed with us he's\nstill sleeping with us\nbecause he likes the connection and so\nhe puts his\nhand like right underneath my arm pit\nhere\nor behind my back because he just likes\ntouch\nyou know what i mean and i realize like\nwe are a very\naffectionate family like we hug and we\nsnuggle and we kiss and we this\nand we that like that's just who we are\nand he said\nhe all of his friends have siblings um\nexcept for like maybe two but he always\nwatches them and then\nwhen one of the kids leaves their\nsiblings he goes and\nlike eases his way in there so like one\nof his friends berkeley\nberkeley has a baby brother and he's\nlike\nhi linen hot like escorts linen all\naround the house he does the same thing\nwith another friend celine and her baby\nsister kaya they're\nall like he wants to take them all\naround and show them stuff\nand i was like it's time i love that\nthat's awesome that's that's so cool\nit's uh\nit's it's nice to it's nice to hear that\nbecause i i know what it was like for me\nso i'm excited for him\nuh and yeah i'm excited for him and uh\nit's\nit's it's gonna be a fun journey i\ndefinitely my youngest sis is like\nstill my best friend and it's it's such\na\nit's it's such a special bond when you\ndo feel that excitement around\nsharing your space with uh another being\nand\nand seeing someone grow up and and uh\nalmost almost feeling somewhat like a\nparent to them too\nuh in in that sense and it's uh it's a\nfun experience so we're gonna come to\nyou for\nfor tips on parenting and everything\nwhen we get around to it okay\ni i want to switch to talking a bit\nabout uh the amount of\nconversation you've been leading and\nsharing in mental health\nand and community because i think that\nit's it's something that's so integral\nto\npeople's daily lives and now people are\nbecoming a bit more open and\ncommunities are starting to destigmatize\nthe conversation\nand communities that have struggled with\nit in the past i know that\nfrom my own experience to south asian\ncommunities massively struggled with it\nand\nblack communities talk about it and i've\nheard the same about the black community\ntoo\nand so you know it's interesting when\nwhen you started to share messages i was\nwondering what\ntools have you gained from therapy over\nthe years that you feel helped you this\nyear\nwere there specific practices or\ninsights or ideas that you really felt\nwere useful this year or any challenging\nyear or even if it's not this year\nif they've been other challenging years\nin your life where you found therapy to\nbe most useful\nsomeone told me before like don't wait\nto go to therapy\nwhen there's something wrong just go\nand i would go when there was something\nwrong and so\nwhen by the time i got there i was just\nthis\nthink of a a ball of yarn\nyou know what i mean just like just but\nit was a big ball of yarn\nso you're having to like undo all of\nthis stuff\nfrom so many years and i think that\npeople think that if you go in\none time even five times that if\neverything's going to be okay that's not\nthe way it goes\nbecause i feel like you have to unravel\nall of this stuff to whatever is at the\nbase\nyou know the nucleus of whatever that\ntrauma or void or whatever that is\nand it takes a while and\nuh it's been a a couple things in my\nlife where i just\nwas wondering why i was going through\nthis same\nthing over and over and over and over\nagain\nand so i finally got a chance to talk to\num someone who actually became i feel\nlike he's\na soul mate almost um uh my friend joe\nbole duke\num and he has this uh beautiful facebook\nspace called speaking speak to\nunderstand or speaking to understand\nand um he we would talk so openly to\nwhere it's almost like\nwhat i was saying was he would finish my\nsentence\nand i was like oh my god i'm so happy i\nfinally have somebody who was\nlike understanding what i'm saying and\nand i don't feel i don't feel\ni'm gonna use the word crazy\ni don't feel crazy i don't feel\nmisunderstood i feel like i'm being\nheard and\nfor me that's what therapy is i feel\nlike i'm being heard i feel like i'm\ncommunicating everything out\ni feel like i'm getting everything out\nso by the time i leave\ni've literally had a moment where i've\nleft a therapy session and\nphysically felt like i i could have\nskipped a step you know what i mean\nbecause i felt lighter\nand i didn't realize in that\nspace or time how much unforgiveness i\nwas holding on to\nand it was for a lot of people and\nthen i was realizing how self-critical i\nwas\nand how all of that was connected and it\nwas just\ncrazy you know what i mean when you\nstart to figure everything out and\nso i'm figuring it all out and noticing\nhow things are connected\nand how one has to cancel out the other\nif you don't get past this one and\nthis will keep you stuck and i was like\noh\noh you know what i mean so it's so much\nto learn\nand then when i before i had tied and i\nwas like well i want to get all this\nstuff out before i have children\nhow is that possible because every day\nis gonna\nevery day you're gonna go through\nsomething new and something else is\ngoing to come up and it's just something\nelse to\nto get past you know and i think that\nthere's nothing wrong with that because\nthat's just what life is and that's the\nbeauty of it\nalthough it is a challenge but it's\nstill the beauty of it because you\nshould be able at the\nend of the day to give yourself some\ncredit\nand i and we are truly our greatest\ncompetitors\nour greatest critique and i did that\nfor a long time and sometimes it still\nsurfaces and i still do that to myself\nand it just becomes\ntoo toxic and then you realize how\nlayered that is\n[Music]\nwhat do you think is the greatest\nchallenge you've overcome personally\ninternally or externally what if you had\nto be like\nthis is the challenge that made me\nrealize how strong i was and how\ncritical i didn't want to be of myself\nand where i realized that you know this\nwas all just layers and conditioning but\nactually\nunderneath all of that there was this\npowerful\nuh strong important being that cared and\nthat was loving\nwhat what do you what would you say that\nwas what do you think that was\nthe definitely the self-critical part\nmm-hmm\nthe self-critical part and constantly\ntalking myself\nout of stuff oh interesting yeah\ntalking myself subconsciously too like i\ntalked myself out of stuff\nand that what i realized was all like\nstuff in the past um\nand when i was able to talk about it it\nwas like\nthis is why you know and i\ni remember what\ni did what do you call the the tapping\nsessions\nyeah caffeine and the more i was doing\nthis tapping\num but i thought it didn't work\nbut it came out one day and i literally\nhad a space\nwhere i smelled saw\nand felt the space that i was in\nwhen the trauma was planted wow\nyeah so and i was in it i was in a\nsession\nand i'll never forget i remembered what\nthat space was and it was going\nin although i'm sure a lot of people\nwould think this count this county\nis it sounds crazy um but it's not\num because your body holds that kind of\nstuff\nand it remembers it there's this book\nthat i still have to read called the\nthe body keeps the score i believe yes\nyeah yeah yeah\nand um the the body kept that score for\nsure\nfor 30 plus years and um\ni had to get past that yeah which by the\nway makes you so conscious\nin being a parent because you're like oh\nmy god i can't say that to him like this\nbecause if i do what if it you know what\ni mean i being a parent\nwas a good thing and a bad thing for me\nbecause i'm just thinking too much you\nknow what i mean my husband is like no\nbabe it's just a no just say no\nit's okay just say no and then move on\nand i'm like yeah yeah\ni don't want to say no to this because\nwhat if he thinks\nhe's like no essays just chill so\nit's that and that's hard like that's\nhard\nbecause you're right that the body does\nkeep a score\nand we do hold on to these impressions\nin our mind and our subconscious and and\nas you mentioned\ntrauma as well and trauma also i think\npeople\nmisunderstand that they feel trauma\nmeans\nsomething very physical or something\nthat's very\nexternally abusive which it can be but\nsometimes trauma can come from just how\nsomeone perceives something\nlike it may not actually we may not feel\nit to be trauma\nbut because it would it had a deeper\nresonance with that person and they\ninterpreted it to be\ntraumatic or tragic they could actually\nhold on to it for a lot longer so you\nare right there\nbeing conscious with your children etc\nis powerful but you're also right that\nthere's the other side where uh there's\nthis\nbook called anti-fragile and it's a term\ncalled anti-fragility\nand and it's the understanding of like\ndo you almost it's like that balance\nbetween\nand it's not like tough love or it's\nit's not like that it's the balance\nbetween\nbeing caring and conscious but then\nrecognizing that everyone has their own\nexperience as well\nthat that they need to grow from whereas\nsometimes if you try and master\nsomeone's experience too perfectly\nthey actually just become fragile\nbecause you know it's\nbecause it's like they've never\nexperienced any sort of\nuh your muscles only get resilient when\nthey get stressed and pressurized and\npushed a bit so\nyou sound like tim\nmy husband says the same thing he's like\nyou no just\nhe has to go through that or he has to\nhear that or\nhe you know what i'm it's it's always\ni'm trying to\nsometimes save him from something yeah\nand tim is like no he has to go through\nit\ni think the combination is good i think\ni think i think i think the middle\nground is good i think it would be the\nsame\nwith my relationship my wife will be\nlike you that's that's definitely how\nshe sees it\nand i think i'm gonna be like your\nhusband like that's def but i think the\ncombination's good because\ni think we do need a bit of both i think\nall of us\nwould say oh we we wish we were saved\nfrom this or\nyou know taken care of from this in our\nlives and i think all of us will say\ni wish i got to like try this or you\nknow we're always going to have that so\nbut i'm happy i will say like a lot of\npeople\nwill have regrets for certain things and\nit's like\nmaybe one thing that i have like a\nregret over but everything else\nmolded me and made me into the woman\nthat i am today that i'm very\nproud to be and i still feel like i'm a\nstudent as like i said about being\nin motherhood in marriage i still feel\nlike a student i still feel like i'm\nlearning and\ni'm grateful to have people around\nto help me to navigate my way through\nthat yeah no i\ni definitely get that and i think i\nthink ultimately all of us have to\nfind that narrative that what we've been\nthrough because\nit is just a perception change but it's\nwhen you find that narrative when you\ncan\nreally look back at your life and be\nlike i know exactly why i went through\nthat\nand i know exactly why that pain came\ninto my life and i know\nand as soon as you do that you start to\nretell your story to yourself in a\ndifferent way it is so beautiful\nand it's so beautiful yeah it's so\nbeautiful and\nand i've seen some people who've gone\nthrough some really horrific things do\nthat\nyou know and and when i've seen them do\nit it's given me more confidence that if\nthey can do it\nin the crazy lives that they've had and\nthe stuff they've been through which is\nmuch worse than mine\nthen then that makes sense absolutely\nyou know\nso yeah i i think uh i think there's a\nlot of um\nthere's a lot of goodness in that\nrecreating our own narrative and story\nand\nand picking apart our lives and trying\nto find meaning in it and one thing i\nheard you say is that you formed a chico\nsystem\nuh which which i loved like which i\nthink is a big part of this because i\nthink\nit's hard to have i think it's hard to\nreframe your story without having a\nchico system and having a group of\npowerful friends and people around you\ntell us a bit about how you\ncame to that understanding and started\nseeing it as that as creating this\nsupportive ecosystem of\nof other women and just also other\npeople i mean my chico system started\nwhen to start i mean\nat 10 you know what i mean when i\ni first started being around the first\nlittle versions of destiny's child\n[Laughter]\nyou know what i mean and it was\nunderstanding\ngirls at that time growing up in space\nand boundaries\nand um advice and\nuh love uh being able to loyalty\ntrust being able to um\ngive it as as well as uh receive it\ncan i receive it and am i you know what\ni mean it was so\nmuch to learn but i i think that um\nit's the greatest blessing of my life\nbecause my sheco system\nstill is is quite intimate but it it\ngrows\nyou know every now and then i literally\nwill look up at god like please this is\nit i don't\ni don't want all my friends this is\nalready enough\nbut then you'll meet someone and you\nrealize that sometimes\num they need a sheco system\nso it's been times where that's happened\nand\nsomeone will come in and they'll learn\nabout you know the\nhow important we need each other as\nwomen\nand i feel like i have the best chico\nsystem in the world\ni really really do i have like\nall the the elements that i that\nfill me and um i'm so grateful for and\nso grateful to have\nso i love my chico system\ni love that what are some of the tell us\nsome of the if if someone's listening or\nwatching right now and they're like\ni love that idea i need to go build my\nsheco system tell us some of the like\nunwritten rules or principles or like\nideas\nbehind developing one so if someone's\nlistening going you know i really want\nto do that\nwhat what are some of the rules that\nthey can follow or some of the ideas\nthat\nthat helped you kind of figure out like\nwhat you just said is so awesome like\noh actually i realized i may not want\nmore people but this person needs\nsomeone so\nwhat were some of those ideas that\nhelped build that i said going off of\nyour gut\nin your heart for sure um\ni'd also say not judging each other so\nharshly i find that sometimes as women\nwe are most hard on each other because i\nthink subconsciously we're looking at\nanother woman and seeing\nourselves or being competitive by\naccident\nbecause i think that's just the way\nsociety has done for\nso long and it's it's been a part of a\ncontrol\nas well so we have to start undoing that\nbecause sometimes\nthe relationship is bigger than you\nif that makes any sense you guys learn\nso much from each other\nso i think that not judging each other\nso harshly in it\nor like dismissing like once i mean\nthere are some ground rules we all know\nthat\num but not dismissing immediately to\nwhere\nit's just like this person can never win\nyeah you know and that's really harsh\nbecause\ni've done it before i'm guilty of it for\nsure\num and i have just like\nlet someone go and then then um when i\nneeded them\ni called them back and that's not cool\neither\nso i feel like it should be a give and\ntake\nin the relationship and sometimes there\nare going to be moments\nin any relationship where that other\nperson may need you at that time more\nthan you need them and you find the\nbalance\nof of that and sometimes you may need\nthem more than they need you\nyou find the balance and you have some\nof those relationships\nwhere it doesn't take a lot like i have\na girlfriend in houston\nit doesn't we don't even have to speak\nevery day we probably speak\nevery couple weeks or every month or\nevery six months or\noh my god i can't believe like a year's\ngrow by\nwe pick up exactly where we left off\nyou know what i mean but she's a person\nthat i\nconstantly want to hear from and laugh\nwith and we have the best time\nand i just feel like those are necessary\ntoo\nso you know it's just about\nbeing respectful and being kind yeah\nalways the basics you're\nspeaking about being dismissive and\njudging harshly you spoke\nup i remember you shared this and i\nremember sharing it too from you\nyou spoke up about like cancer culture\nand against\ncancer culture because you you strongly\nbelieve\nin this idea of not judging people\nharshly and not just dismissing them\nand and it wasn't that you weren't\nsaying to keep people accountable\nor i remember you explaining like you\nyou value accountability\nand and you value conversation but not\ncancer culture can you explain that to\nus because i think\ni i agreed with you so strongly on that\nand\nand i thought you explained it really\nwell and obviously people still find\nways to make it not make sense but\ngive us i want you to have an\nopportunity to really explain that so\nthat people can be like yeah i\ni identify with i understand what what\nthat means\nfor me when i was talking about cancer\nculture there were elements of it that i\ndidn't understand\ntoo like you know being completely\ntransparent\nso i respect when people come onto the\nmy page or my space\nas i say myspace and are\nable to articulate intelligently what\nthey\nwant to say to correct me\ni don't mind being corrected of course\nat all but\nit's a way to say it to where we're\ntrying to understand each other not\ntrying to bash\neach other because ain't nobody got time\nfor that like\nlife is too short it's just ridiculous\nso when there were\na couple people who were so beautifully\nand articulately like\nsaying kelly this is this is the\ndifference and i was like\nokay i got it and i understand like\npeople should be held accountable\nof their actions but when we start to\nseek judgment in there and we can't look\nat\nourselves the rest of the way like\nit's a problem to me it's a pr it's a\nproblem\nbecause i think that we've all seen\nourselves in a way where\nwe have this humiliation you know what i\nmean like and\nwhat does that feel like you know what i\nmean like\nto stand in humiliation is a really\ntough place to be\nand it's not to say that they're right\nnot to say that we're right not to say\nthat they're\njust so wrong not to say that we're so\nwrong it's just\nnot judging you know what i mean it's\njust not judging just making sure that\njudgment isn't caught in between that\nbecause i feel like\ni'm human i mess up all the time and i'm\nnot perfect\nand i am not going to get it right every\nsingle time and there will be something\nthat\nyou'll just like find about me where you\nlike i don't like that and\ndo you write me off should i never you\nknow what i mean should i never\nbe you know brought up or hurt or\nwhatever again like you know what i mean\nshould i stop talking to you do\nhow do i help you get out of it you know\neven\nand some people will completely disagree\nwith me when i say this\nbut i feel like you know when you\nwhen you do live under a microscope for\nso long you\ninstead of um doing this so much\ni always feel like how would i feel like\nto be on the other side of that\nand i just i don't like it\ni don't i don't like it and i feel like\nwe can't do that to each other but i\nknow what the root of that is\ni know what the root of that is and i\nknow that the root of it\nis the self-awareness and you know we\njudge ourselves harshly\nwe judge ourselves so harshly we don't\nmean to\nbut somewhere in life or\nsomewhere there you know what i mean in\ngrowing up and in our journey our own\njourney\nsomebody did that to us and how do we\nundo that\ni don't think that we make somebody else\nfeel like\ngarbage because they're wrapped up in\ntheir trauma\nand they they can't find their way out\nof it i have so much it makes me want to\ncry\nbut i have so much compassion when it\ncomes to that and it's\num it's necessary kindness is necessary\nyou know what i mean i i really want\nthat tattoo or just on my forehead\nsomewhere just\ni just want to always remind people that\nkindness is\nnecessary we need it and especially now\nwhen we saw a country divided\ngreatly divided and even though someone\nhas different beliefs or\nideas of what things should look like\nyou know they have\ntheir right or whatever of what it looks\nlike i don't necessarily agree but i'm\nnot going to\nhate you for it that's beautiful thank\nyou for sharing that you've reminded me\nof\ni've read this today i want to share it\nit's\nby a writer named russell barkley and he\nsaid\nthe children who need love the most\nwill always ask for it in the most\nunloving ways\nrussell barkley so that you are really\nagain the children who need love the\nmost\nwill always ask for it in the most\nunloving ways\nbecause you don't know how yeah if it\nwas never there\nhow how do you ask for it how do you\nreceive it how do you give it like\nit's no rules on it exactly and so and\nthat's and that's what you just said\nthat's that's it like it's\nwe we that's why kindness as you said\nkindness is necessary because\nit's needed both ways to both the person\nwe think that's doing the hating\nuh and the person receiving it too it's\num it's it's such an important lesson\nlet's uh let's let's talk about some of\nthe amazing music you put out this year\nuh i've been i've been watching your\nvideos too and they are epic like i\ni just hit my one like you know uh just\nliterally just before we did this and i\nwas just like\noh it's such a great video i want to\nhear for someone who's made\nmusic for so long\nlike how is your purpose\nand then secondary your creative process\nbehind music\ntransformed because there's very few\npeople on the planet that have\nthat have made music for as long as you\nhave and\nand there's something to be said for\nthat like you know it's just\nit's it's phenomenal to think of your\nfull journey and and to think of that\nwhole\nuh growth phase i want to hear how your\nprocess and how your purpose is\nhas grown behind the scenes i mean i\njust came into the industry just loving\nmusic period\nbut i'd say like\nthe process the past\nwhat since 2011 i'd say\nhas been what do i like what do i want\nto do\nwhat like really like makes me excited\nand fulfills me and this\nbut really when once again that titan\nis exciting because i wanted him to see\nme be authentic and i felt like there\nwere times in my life where like\ni was kind of like maybe folding or\nbending sometimes according to the\nindustry and where it was and what was\npopular and this and that and\ni just finally got to a place where i\nwas like i'ma do whatever i want to do\nand i did and when i started to do that\ni noticed things happen differently\nand of course like places in between\nthere i would doubt myself but then\nit would always do something really cool\nor great or somebody would be like yo\nthis is the best\nsuch and such you've ever made or you\nknow it would\nhave all these like number ones in\ndifferent countries or whatever like i\nwas like oh okay good this is working\nokay\nyou know it was it was really that when\nbefore the process\nwas kind of calculated um in my head or\ni won't say calculated as much as i was\nlike\nso much thinking about what do you think\nwhat do you think what do you think what\ndo you think\nand it was what do you think\nso i like what i think i like what i\nhave to say\nthat's i love i love how titan has been\nlike the\nthe theme of of each of these\nrevelations\nuh because it's right yeah you want you\nwant him to see\nhis mother being herself so that he\nfeels permission to be himself\nand and you're so right that you know\nall of us in\nin so many different ways and we don't\nhave to be\nin the public eye to not be ourselves so\nmany of us\nin our own lives have played so many\nroles where we haven't\nbeen ourselves yo let me tell you by\nsocial media\n[Laughter]\nyo i i i as much as i love it\ni'm watching like and we've we've all\nheard the conversation there's no it's\nno reason to even like get into it\nlike it's i just want people to\nbe their most beautiful authentic selves\nlike i have fun with filters\nbut you're not gonna see me with it you\nknow what i mean like\nlet's see you i want to see you i want\nto hear you\nlike yeah you know yeah and and yeah and\nand i think it's scary because we\nyou're so right it's scary because we\ndon't see it a lot\nyeah and therefore you don't see it\nbeing liked\nand then you go oh okay so if i do that\nthen it won't be liked either and so\nit's kind of like this vicious cycle\nthat it keeps going round and round\nbecause we don't see it around us\nso we don't be it and then you know it\njust keeps\nuh apparently just keeps escalating yeah\nand and amplifying\nso yeah i i think that's a that's\nanother powerful way of\nof hoping that that's how your music\nchanged how did how do you think your\nmusic's changed from the perspective of\nit's uh i guess that that purpose\nelement of that\nimpact behind how you want it to make\npeople feel is\nis that also this is feeling for me\nlike i just remember like the first\ntimes of me listening to music how it\nmade me feel\nlike and when i'm having a good time\nwith my\nfriends when we could have like you know\nget togethers and stuff like that\nlike what is this music making me feel\nlike you know\nlike i remember being at um\na party two years ago and\nit was oh my god it was such a good\ngood night um and i'd heard\na coffee spin\nand so he was spinning and i'm on the\ndance floor\nand my eyes were closed for at least\nfive minutes\nand i was on my second glass of\nchampagne\nbut it was more so like i was just lost\nin the music\nand it felt so good i opened my eyes\nback up and it was\neverybody on the dance floor you know\nwhat i mean and so when i opened up my\neyes it was so funny because\nsomeone came up to me they were like yo\nyou made it look like it was like magic\nout here i had to come in\nand i was like that's dope like because\ni feel like\nyou know music is that infectious and i\nwas like i want\nthat i want want it to where it feels\nlike that and so\nthe the moment i heard hitman uh\nspecifically\nthe track i was just like i was moved i\nwas like oh my god like i just got so\nexcited and\nthen the songwriter sam do started like\njust\nkilling this melody and i was like oh my\ngod and it just kept feeling better and\nbetter and it just became this cycle\njust of like\ngoodness and good feeling and vibrations\nand i just couldn't help myself i was\nlike let me hit my\nit just it just started bouncing off the\nwalls you can feel it\nand i wanted that and i'm so happy that\ni got that and i got that with\nevery song off the record this time and\ni'm very proud of that\nyeah i i love that and and uh you you\ncan\nyou can feel that energy on the track\nwhen someone's\nin love with what they're creating and\nand and then that way everyone else\nfeels it too and so\ni i love that you're doing that and i\nlove that that's the\nyou know not that you've you've always\ndone it but that i love that you're even\nmore intentionally and\nconsciously doing it now uh and inspired\nto see where it goes so\nwe we end uh every interview kelly with\na final five which is a fast five so the\nanswers have to be one word\nor one sentence maximum okay you know\ni'm long-winded jay but okay let's go\ni know but you've been great so i i will\nprobably ruin this\nand ask you to give longer answers\nbecause that's what i do when i\nwhen i
