little sleep\nwell that's what i do i've never needed\nmuch sleep how much have you slept again\ndid you say in the last 24 hours\ni don't exactly know but most of it\nhappened on an airplane but\nhonestly people ask me all the time\nbecause i always keep a crazy schedule\nlike this\nof how i do it with no no sleep and it's\nbecause i'm dedicating my time to things\nthat i really care about you know i\ngenuinely want to be doing these things\nand so you know if it means i have to\ngive up a couple hours of sleep that's\nworth it\ni love that and how did you get involved\nwith we day i'm fascinated to know the\nstory of how did you find out how did\nyou hear it so weed is something that\ni've known about for a long time\nactually a lot of my cast members from\nshadowhunters have done we day events\nall over the world\nand it's something that i've been trying\nto find an opportunity in my schedule\nand and\nan opportunity where you know i have met\nup with we day's course of action\nand it this just happened to be perfect\ni just finished up shooting arrow here\nand i'm about to start the stand here as\nwell and congratulations oh thank you\nthank you so much and uh so here we are\nso this is your first read this is my\nfirst video\ni loved it awesome great first read it\nyeah and that's the same for me so i've\nbeen wanting to get into wee day for so\nlong so many of my friends are involved\nin we day\nand so it's been it's been a very\nsimilar journey where it's meant to be\nyeah absolutely so i want to dive into\nso many things about you and the first\nthing i want to talk about is\nwhat was your first and well not your\nfirst what's your favorite memory of\ngrowing up in kansas city\ni think some of my favorite memories\ngrowing up in kansas city all happened\nat my grandparents house\nthey have this house it's in it's in\nthis beautiful wooded area\nand it sort of became my nature\nplayground was their backyard they had\nall these woods and hills and rocks and\nthings i could climb around\nand look at the wildlife and just kind\nof be\nalone in my imagination and that i think\nstarted a lot of my\nsense of make-believe which is truly\nwhat i believe led me to being an actor\num i never wanted to be an actor as a\nkid i didn't even know that was a job\ncoming from a family of science and\nmedical professionals and\ni i wanted to be an economist as a kid\nso that that was totally my track until\ni\nyou know fell into this backwards but um\nthat that and just the sense of\ncommunity there you know there's\nsomething\nso special about it which is why i\nalways go back as much as i can and\nthat's why i'm so involved with the big\nslick as well which is the the\norganization that was started by jason\nsiddiques and paul rudd and and will\nforte david keckner rob riggle\neric stonestreet all of these really\nsuccessful\nactors that are from kansas city and\nthey go back every year it started as a\nlittle poker game and now\nthis year we raised over two million\ndollars for children's mercy hospital\nthere\nin two days um it's they calculated all\nof the numbers and in the last 10 years\nthey've raised over 10 million dollars\nfor the hospital\nand it's it's amazing it's just so\nlovely to be a part of and really shows\nthe spirit of kansas city\nthat's unbelievable i love that story\nand and tell me a bit about that because\ni love what you shared there\nand and i talk a lot about i joke a lot\nabout how when i was growing up i had\nthree options either to become a lawyer\nor a doctor or a failure\nbecause that's kind of like all i knew\nabout and so when you said that you\ndidn't know that\nyou could be an actor like you didn't\nknow existed i felt the same way about\nanything in media like i didn't think it\nwas a real career\nand like you said your your family was\nmedical professionals your mom was a\nscientist\nyeah and it's like tell me about that\ndecision of wanting to be an economist\nand then falling backwards into this\nbecause i think so many of our viewers\nare always thinking about finding their\npassion and\nfinding something that they really\nbelieve in like you said doing things\nthat are meaningful\nabsolutely how did you switch from\neconomist to this it sort of hit me like\na brick wall\ni i was always a huge math nerd and i to\nthis day i love economics because it's\nit's\nthe real world application of the math\nthat i love so much\nand i was just so fascinated by the fact\nthat these formulas and graphs and\ncomplex math that i learned so much\nabout could actually be used to predict\nand explain things that happened in the\nreal world\nand once i discovered that it was kind\nof a runaway train of um\ni became obsessed with different things\nparticularly developmental economics\nbecause i love the sort of\nanthropological aspect that gets thrown\ninto that when you're trying to find\nways to help these developing countries\nexist in the world in a way that they\ncan grow to their full potential\nand that that fascinated me but aside\nfrom that i\nwas a ballet dancer as a hobby and i and\na girl scout and a softball player and\nall these other things\nbut i ran into a family friend who was\ndirecting a community theater production\nand needed a dancer\nand i was the kid who would try anything\ni was like sure why not let's go do this\ntheater thing and see what that's all\nabout\nand i will never forget walking on stage\non opening night\nit's you have these moments of clarity\nin life\nand they come few and far between but\nyou know beyond a doubt when they happen\nand i walked on stage and something hit\nme like a brick wall and i just knew in\nthat moment that i was put on this earth\nto tell stories\nand i was put on this earth to to create\ncharacters and to be a part of\nthis communal entertainment form i guess\nand i've never looked back i love that\nthat's so beautiful and i think you're\nso right you articulate it so well that\nwe all get an opportunity if we slow\ndown if we\nif we kind of pause a little and take in\nthese experiences we all get these\nmoments of clarity\nand and i always say that when you eat\nsomething you know whether you like it\nor not straight away it's true but but\nwe never do that we never reflect on\nthat when we're doing something new\nright or like when we do an activity\nlike you said when i walked on stage you\njust you know you felt it yeah i think\nwe should just check in with ourselves\nmore\nit's true when you do something new and\nbe like did i like that like yeah like\nthat i heard somebody give a talk\nearlier this year about being vulnerable\nto joy\nand there was something i thought was so\nbeautiful in that because so often we're\nso focused on\nwhat the next thing is or protecting\nourselves or whatever it is that we\nwe don't allow ourselves to be open to\nwhatever it is that's coming our way\nyeah and so we miss out on so much and\ni've tried to really make a concerted\neffort to do that\nto be vulnerable to whatever it is be it\njoy be it a lesson to be learned be it\nwhatever\nyeah tell me something that you've\nlearned recently or something that\nyou've been learning recently uh\nsomething that i've learned recently is\nuh\nthe importance of of taking a moment\nactually just what you said taking a\nmoment taking a breath and just\nin the i live a life of a lot of chaos\nrecently\nand it's really important to stop and\ntake in those moments and just\nsit for a minute sometimes and really\njust be present and absorb what it is\nthat you're\nin the in the midst of yeah i love that\ntell me\nhow and i mean this genuinely how does\nsomeone finish high school at 14\nand get a yeah degree at 17.\nwell this kind of ties into why we're\nhere today yes um\ni again i've always been a huge nerd but\ni credit that to one of my very first\nteachers\nshe was my preschool teacher and she saw\nsomething in me\nthis this propensity and love for\nlearning and took the time to foster\nthat\nso for me from my family as well to to\nthis teacher\nschool learning education was always\npresented to me\nas discovery as joy as\nwhat can you figure out about the world\nwhat can you learn how can you expand\nwhat it is that you know\nit was never a chore it was never\nsomething negative it was never\nyou know presented as uh as work in a\nsense\nand so yeah so that's how i've always\napproached learning and i was allowed to\ngo at my own pace and\ndid a lot of um online and\ncorrespondence programs that allowed me\nto do that while still going to the\nschool for\nart and music and recess and lunch and\nall the fun things\nand it was the perfect storm for me\nbecause i got the best of both worlds\nand\naccidentally graduated high school at\n14. that is\namazing i love hearing that because i\nthink so many of us have had\nexperiences of school whether it was the\nother two extremes of like\nboredom chores who cares right or in my\ncase it was very much like performance\ngetting top top grades and like doing\nwell in exams which also doesn't\nleave a good impression for kids because\nit becomes about pressure\nand pain and you know you're now just\ntrying to catch up with this metric just\nto show your parents or compare yourself\nto someone else\nso how are you what's your message today\nto the children on stage are you\nputting that in there are they gonna\nhear that i'm trying to as much as i can\nmy the topic that i'm discussing is\nabout something a little bit different\nbut i always try and talk about\neducation because i feel as though so\nmany kids especially today\ntake it either take education for\ngranted or don't see it as\nsomething that can be joyful and it's\nnot to say that\nyou know there are going to be\nassignments or classes or things that\nare going to be really difficult and not\ngonna be any fun at all\nbut for me i don't know maybe it's\nbecause i'm a stubborn optimist but it's\nall about finding the fun in them it's\nyou know you have to marry poppins it a\nlittle bit and figure out how to\nhow to make it fun and how to make it\nsomething that you can enjoy because you\nhave to do it either way\nyeah no i love that there's a study that\nwas done at yale uh i get\nthe scientist's second name wrong so i\nwant to say a first name's amy and\nin my book i talk about how she talks\nabout how they did a study where they\ninterviewed\nnurses and cleaners and all these people\nthat work as part of a hospital stop\nand they spoke to cleaners and they\nasked them describe your job\nand half the cleaners described it as\nlow skilled dirty\nattur hard very difficult and the other\nhalf\ndescribed it completely differently they\nused words like healers\ntransformers like they felt that they\nwere a part of humans\nemotion and they felt that they were\nbuilding up these relationships with\npatients\nand so it's a term that yale crossfit\ncalled job crafting\nand it's like how you view that is what\nit becomes\nand so some of these people felt that\ntheir work was so highly skilled and so\nfulfilling and so meaningful\nit's funny life so if there's anything\ni've learned in kind of becoming an\nadult is that life is all about\nperspective\nevery morning when you wake up you can\nchoose to have a great day or to have a\nterrible day no matter what happens\nit's all about how you view it and how\nyou look at the world and it really is a\nseries of choices\nand what do you do what's your choice\nwhen because you live a busy life\nchaos you know you're shooting you're\ntraveling you're speaking you're doing\ncharity work like\nwhen you get those moments in your day\nwhere things are going not the way you\nplan\nwhat's the choice you're making how are\nyou bringing it back i'd love to hear i\nalways try and find something good\nsomething that i can focus on that\ncan make me smile or to just laugh at\nthe chaos\nbecause how silly things can be and how\nyou know absurdly chaotic things can get\nit just gets to a point of you have to\nlaugh or you're gonna cry\nbecause and i'd much rather laugh uh and\nthat's it's sort of how i was raised my\nwhole family does that you know my\nmy grandmother was the head nurse of an\ner\nfor for several decades and\nnothing phases her she is one of the the\nstrongest willed people\nyeah she's seen everything and my entire\nfamily\nis of the mind that you can make\nsome anything silly any situation you\ncan make\nit you can turn it into laughter yeah\nand so that's kind of how i was raised\nand that's i try and carry that on and\nspread that around as much as i possibly\ncan\nare you a harry potter fan i'm a huge\nhurt you've just reminded me\nof what are those things called my\nsister's gonna hate me for not\nremembering\nwhat are those things called where they\ncome out as your biggest fear\nbut you have to imagine it as something\nfunny you know what i'm talking about i\nknow what you're talking about and i\ncan't remember what are they for the\nlife\nright now we're gonna get yeah yeah\nwe're gonna we're gonna get ready\ni'm such a harry potter fan too so this\nis terrible blogger i feel like it's a\nboggart sure we'll go with that\nyeah awesome but you know what i'm\ntalking about yeah right yeah like you\nsee a dementor and you have to imagine\nit\nas as the balloon and the moon that pops\nor whatever it is yeah yeah that's\nexactly the spider with\nron sees the spider and it's got skates\non yeah yeah yeah so\nyeah okay i love that piece of advice\ni've never heard that before and i think\nthat's awesome okay if we're talking\nabout harry potter i have to stop you\nwhat's your house oh uh oh oh no\nso when i've i've been to the sorting\nhat okay in in the harry potter studios\nand it said\ngryffindor okay i don't see that but\nthat i have a bit of slytherin in me\nwell i i don't think anyone has purely\none house yeah i have a theory on this\nokay i like the rebellious yeah kind of\npushing not not evil\nno just just just rebellious and pushing\nbuttons and like trying new stuff yeah\nhow about you\nuh i would say i'm ravenclaw with\ngryffindor tendencies and a sprinkle of\nhufflepuff oh okay\nthat's that's what i've come to\ndetermine i know slytherin in you\ni mean maybe a little but not enough not\nenough to to claim it\ni love it i'm glad we i'm glad we dived\nover into harry potter we've never done\nthat on any podcast\never before but no that advice of you\nknow laugh\nand and see how silly things are and i\nthink sometimes it takes us time to see\nthat\nbut actually we can do that at the\nmoment and we can laugh at it like\nplease be a bugger please please please\nyes i have to check that you say that\nbeing a\nchameleon is one of your favorite things\nabout your job\ntell me more about that it's something\nthat i see in the best of actors and\nand something i've really worked hard to\ntry and emulate in my career you see it\nin actors like meryl streep and sam\nrockwell\nand you know the actors of that nature\nwhere they completely transform\nevery single character they play is\nentirely different in look in\nphysicality in the way that they\ninteract with the other characters in\nthe world around them the way they speak\nthe way they walk\nand that's something that i think is is\nessential to our job because you know we\nhave the opportunity to walk a million\ndifferent lives and play a million\ndifferent people and figure out how they\nwork\nand i think the farther i can push\nmyself to to completely transform and\nand\nuh immerse myself in every character i\nplay\nthe the more diverse of a rolodex of\ncharacters i'll be able to play\nbut also the better i'll be able to\nserve the story because i'm not a part\nof a story to\nput myself forward i'm a part of the\nstory to kind of\nbe within that canvas and and within\nthat cast of characters and to you know\nserve the\nthe greater arc of whatever the story is\ntelling and play my\nplay my piece and you know play my part\nwell and uh\nserve the greater machine of the story\nand you know it's it's also really fun\nto see how far you can go and in a\ndifferent direction and\nbe somebody completely different\nabsolutely and what's your process like\ndo you do method acting would you see\nyourself considering that or what's your\nprocess to really get into a role like\nis it research is it spending time is it\nwhat's your habits i want to know how\nyou break it down when you get a little\nbit of\neverything honestly and it depends it\ndiffers uh based on the project and what\nit requires\nso i always do as much research as i can\ngiven that i'm a huge nerd\nyes and it helps me to know as much as i\ncan\nbecause then it will kind of help\ninherently even if i'm not actively\nthinking about it\nif i have the knowledge it'll be in the\nback of my head when i need it\num and then you know if there's source\nmaterial i'll definitely go read it like\nfor shadowhunters i read the mortal\ninstruments series\njust because so much of it is told from\nclary's perspective\nand even though our series was very\ndifferent at least i had that knowledge\nand i had that in the back of my head\nthat i could pull\nlittle bits from or with arrow because i\nwas playing oliver and felicity's\ndaughter given that their characters\nwere so iconic and so\nwell developed i went through and\nwatched the entire series\nso that i could pull little qualities\nand nuances and quirks and things to\nto pepper through so that she really was\nan amalgamation of these two characters\nthat audiences know so well\nso i'll do a bit of that and then you\nknow i i love pinterest\nso i'll go on pinterest and i'll look up\ndifferent clothing or or different hair\nand makeup looks or\nwhatever it is to see kind of what i can\npiece together and see\nsomething that i might not have thought\nof or something that i might you know\nthis that or if there's an accent\nrequired or if you know\ni do as much as i can and then try and\nwatch a few similar\ntonal projects or similar characters to\nsee what other people have done in\nsimilar situations\njust to try and get as much as many\nideas as i can get as much\ninfluence as i can to see what i like\nwhat i don't what i want to pull what i\nwant to incorporate\nwhat's in the back of my head just so i\nhave as much information as i can to\nplay with on the day\nmm-hmm that makes complete sense yeah i\nlove what an intellectual pursuit acting\nit's great it can be it can be when i'm\nlistening to you and that's about 50\nof it i always say i do 50 of my work\nbefore i get there and then 50\nof it happens on the day because so much\nof it it's so much of it depends on the\ndirector and the other actors in the\nscene and the set when you get there and\nthe environment\nbecause half of acting is interacting\nwith the other people and with the\nenvironment around you\nso if i come in and i've done all my\nwork and i'm solidly set in what i'm\ngonna do\ni don't have any flexibility and there's\nno room for play yeah so you have to get\nthere and be able to kind of bounce\naround and adapt and go okay let's play\nball let's\npass this tennis ball back and forth and\nsee what happens yeah i think that's a\ngreat rule\npercent before fifty percent afterwards\nbecause sometimes we try to prepare a\nhundred percent\nand then almost you paralyze yourself\nwhen you're in the zone you just you\ncan't be\nplayful and yeah mess around and my\nfavorite moments are those little magic\nthings that happen that surprise you\ntotally you know that you you finish a\ntake and you go i did not expect it to\ngo that way at all i did not expect to\nfeel that whatsoever but\nholy moly that was great yeah i love\nthat yeah that's so cool and\nit's funny now we need to find you to be\ncasted as an economist because then you\nwon't have to prepare\nperfect you can just you can just go in\nlet's do it i mean that is what my\ndegree is in yeah there you go\nexactly that's what i mean that's what i\nmean and you know you if you were\nplaying an economist do you know any\ncool economist stories so like\nany historical pieces there must be\nsomething i mean unless i'm playing alan\ngreenspan which i really don't think\nuh i'm gonna have to do some research\nyeah i'm sure there are i'm sure there's\nsome crazy stories\nyeah uh female economists there like\ni'll find it yeah we'll find it we'll\nfind it\nokay uh i know that you love disney i do\nyou do love disney if you could be a\nvoice actor\nif you could be the voice of any\ncharacter of any disney movie who would\nit be\num there's so many things i'd love to do\ni mean they keep creating all these\nwonderful new stories and\nyou know when i was a kid i was always\nlooking for these characters these\nbadass female characters\nso mulan and pocahontas were a girl yeah\nlike they were the ultimate for me i\nwanted to be mulan as a kid\num i had her poster on my wall it was\ngreat um\nbut i you know i'd love to be a part of\npretty much any universe i think pixar\nand disney are doing so many wonderful\nthings right now\nand i love the the disney pixar movies\nbecause they're so fun\nand you you go back and you watch the\nmovies that you loved as a kid\nand you can still enjoy them as an adult\nit's fascinating that there are so many\nlayers to them that you don't even\nrealize\nso i'd love to be a part of that world i\nmean you know it's it's something that\ni've worked for disney for a long time\nand they're such a wonderful company\nyeah absolutely and have you seen that\nseries you remind me of something else\nwe keep going totally off tangent but\nyou\nyou keep feeding into all my uh all my\npassions\nhave you seen wreck-it ralph the second\none i haven't i haven't seen i'm not\ngonna give it away but\nyou can go on youtube and watch this\nscene uh you don't watch the scene first\nokay but there's a scene where all the\ndisney princesses are there\nand they're telling their stories but in\na very\nfun like in a very educational but funny\nway oh my god\nyeah about women empowerment and badass\nwomen so it's just i'm not gonna give it\naway okay\nbut i want you to watch it even once\ngenius yeah it's so\nwell done and it's uh disney almost\nmaking fun of themselves yeah\nfor how they portray princess but it's\nbrilliant it's really good i find\nself-aware comedy to be\nthe most fun because it it allows for\nsuspension of belief but also\nyou know you can laugh at yourself a\nlittle bit yeah absolutely now you've\ngot to go on stage soon so\ni've got to ask you i've got to rush to\nthe rapid fire section so i ask\na final five which a fast five questions\nokay uh one word\nor one sentence answers all right uh so\nhere we go here's your final five\num what's the biggest risk you've ever\ntaken oh biggest risk i've ever taken\nuh i moved to new york city after\nbooking a job\num within a week and didn't know what i\nwas doing didn't know how long i was\ngoing to be there but\ni just said all right here we go and i\nwas 14. well okay\nyou left that out very important yeah i\nlove that okay what's the toughest\ndecision you've ever made\ntoughest decision i ever made was um\nthere was a time in my actually this\nkind of an existential decision\num there was a time in my life where i\ncould have chosen to\nstay in a very dark place and and allow\nthat to consume me\nor choose to frame it positively and\nmake the difficult choice of at least at\nthe time\nof looking on the bright side and\nfinding that silver lining\nand i was lucky enough to be surrounded\nby people that helped me do that\nand help me steer down a very healthy\npath as opposed to a very unhealthy path\nand uh here i am today well if you don't\nmind next time\nbut we're both in l.a we both lived\nthere i'd love to unpack that bit more\nwith you yeah\nthat'd be amazing to talk about that\nokay uh third question\nuh the first thing you do in the morning\nuh usually i roll out of bed eat an\napple and go to the gym\noh cool okay i love working out in the\nmorning it starts my day right and it's\nusually the only time i have\nyes okay fourth question the last thing\nyou

final\nquestion what's one message you'd love\nto share with\nall of the kids who are serving through\nwe day and having such a huge impact\ni would like to say thank you for being\nconscious of the world around you\nand for being a global citizen and\nserving kind of this world that we share\nand this this human race that we have\nbecause it's it's so important to think\nbeyond yourself and beyond your own life\nin your own realm\nto to take care of of everyone in the\nworld that we live in it's um\ni always feel if everyone took just a\ncouple of seconds every day to think of\nsomeone else and to do something kind of\nfor somebody else\nthe world would be a lot better place\nand you guys are already doing that\ncompletely agree\neveryone catherine thank you so much\nkevin you're
