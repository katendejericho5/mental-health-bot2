    "transcript": "after four or five minutes under the\neyes\ni had no oxygen left in the body but my\nconsciousness was still there\nand it was okay i was going to sleep\nthen\ni realized i won over the fear of death\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast\nin the world thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you that turn up\nevery week to listen learn and grow\nnow you know that i love introducing you\nto incredible guests\nand today's guest doesn't really need an\nintroduction i'm sure you're already a\nfan\nthis is someone that i've been wanting\nto interview for a very long time we\nwere trying to make sure we do it in\nperson\nbut hey this situation and scenario has\nmade us connect\nright now and i'm so excited to\nintroduce you to the one and only\nwim hof aka the iceman he's the creator\nof the wim hof method\na method consisting of cold exposure\nbreathing techniques\nand mindset commitment for the first\ntime in history scientific research has\nshown\nthat people who practice the wim hof\nmethod can\ninfluence their autonomic nervous system\nand\nimmune system this was thought of as\nimpossible this is huge\nsince this study the more research has\nbeen done on the wim hof method\nshowing what human beings are capable of\nwhim has been an extreme\nathlete with 21 official world\nrecords climbing the mount everest in\nshorts\nsitting in a bucket with ice for almost\ntwo hours\nrunning a half marathon above the arctic\ncircle\non his bare feet and many more amazing\nfeats\nhe is convinced listen to this that\neveryone\ncan tap into this potential without\nhaving to invest the decades\nworth of study travel and daring\nas he had and so he developed the wim\nhof method a natural path to an optimal\nstate of body and mind\nwhim teaches his method in seminars all\nover the world\nbut today we're going to talk about how\nyou can find it all in this book the wim\nhof method\nwomen thank you so much for coming on on\npurpose\nthanks joe that was a ray of light it's\nincredible to\nsee what you've done and see what you've\nachieved\nand i'm so grateful that people like you\nexist in the world today because\ni love this juxtaposition of wisdom and\nscience\nand i love this bringing together of\nthese two worlds that people often think\ndon't go together when we talk about\nbreath work or meditation or\nvisualization people often say oh that's\nthat soft stuff you know\nyou know it's it's airy fairy stuff and\nthen you see someone like you\nand and all of a sudden i was like okay\nwell women women's not harry fairy\nwhim is like a tough guy you know he can\nhe's done a lot of tough things\nand then you've got the science i i\nthink it's incredible what you're doing\nwomen thank you so much for doing it\ngreat yes let's enlighten\nyou from your angle as being the\ngreatest podcast\nthe uh yeah the greatest podcast\non medical science uh health\nin the world that is my aim\nthat's my aim it is so much my aim\nas they it's for i have to tell a little\nstory\nin the in the uh in the old upanishads\nin india there was a a contest between\nthree archers and they came together\nand they had to aim and see who was the\nbest\nso the first one aimed and he\nshot into the middle of a\ntarget a fish it was\ninside a tree laid there\nabout 150 meters away\nthat is a like 160 yards away aiming\nwith a ah\nyou know with an arch and a bow and\narrow and boom\nin the middle and then another cave and\nthe second one came and he aimed and he\ngot it\nin the hat and then the last one came\nand uh he aimed and\nuh he shot and then they first did not\nsee where the arrow was gone because it\nwas\nexactly gone in the blackness of the\npupil of the eye and it had become\none with it something like that and that\neverybody knew\nat that contest who was the best it was\na\na man called arjuna and\nhe and then they asked him how did you\ndo this\narjuna tell us explain us\nshow some light on this and then he said\nyes first i saw the wood and i saw\nsomething\nsomething shiny in a tree and then i saw\nthis shiny thing become bigger i saw a\neye\nand the eye it became so big\ni could not miss that is\nour mind capable of\nif we only live to our true purpose\nthen we cannot miss if we use\n100 percent our mind which\nby the way we don't own our own\nmind we are schooled in something\nthat that is providing production for a\nsystem\nthat is sodomizing the planet that is\nnot into the immune system to health\nnor in the into the happiness nor in the\nstrength of people\nbut into the brutal national\nproduct the economy and money\nand the creativity therefore is gone the\noriginality\nthe identity of a person is gone\nand logically you become sick you become\ndepressed\nyou don't know what is your purpose then\nyou live\naside of your true core which contains\nhappiness strength and health it is we\nare\ntalking health then i talk soul\nand because soul was something where is\nit where is it\nnow we got the measurement devices to go\ninto the dna\nand into the dna we are able to get\nand to show that we are able i'm doing\nthis study right now\nwith san francisco top researchers on\nthe dna\nshowing that we are able to get into the\ngenome expressions\ninto the telomeres the length of the\nlength\ntime span of life and how to influence\nthat\nand with that into the genetical past\nof our ancestors our ancestors\nhave uh given us encrypted codes\nin the genetics and we were\nthinking a within science we cannot\ninfluence\nin to that and i say\nyes we are built to free\nto solve the problems of the past of the\nancestors\nand with that comes enlightenment and\nnow\nit's no longer something abstract\nwhat is abstract is killing the planet\nis shooting people to the moon\nshooting people to mars to venus\ni don't know what they do but that is\nabstract\nit hasn't got anything to do with the\nguarantee to become\nhappy strong and healthy which i want to\ngive\nto my children to my friends to\neverybody around me with all the respect\nfor the inner nature\nouter nature coming together there is\nthe soul\nthere is the purpose there is the health\nand now we have the measurement\ndevices but before when i\ni was in the uh like young\ni thought hey man i'm not gonna take\nthis\ni don't think war is normal a disease\nnormal abuse is normal stress is normal\ni don't think that is normal i think\nthis happiness strength and health\nthat is normal and to respect wildlife\nand\nand people in poor countries and help\nlove that that is my aim\nbut how to get around that how to get uh\nmake it tangible and and strong\ni did not know but i followed my god i\nfollowed my intuition and those now\nshow to be internal neurological\nnetworks\ncalled proprioception interoception\nand they were thought of not to be able\nto be\ntop down regulated like mind\nover matter was not possible i showed\nhow to do it where did i get the wisdom\nof\nnot out of the books out of nature\nmother nature provided me and now\ni'm showing all in scientific\ncomparative studies\nthat we are built innately capacitated\nto uh to provide health\nhappiness and strength through a control\nabsolute\ngreat control over our immune system\nas you said in the beginning the immune\nsystem innate\nimmune system the damaging factor right\nnow with\na covet is the innate immune system the\noveractive immune system\nthe cytokine storm and we were to\nbelieve\nthat it is not able to be suppressed by\nhumans\nand we showed this very clearly in 2014\nwe can surprise it within a quarter of\nan hour through what\nthrough the life force itself what are\nyou talking about\nbreathing just breathing deep\nbreathing manipulating it like\na consciously stopping the breath\nafter releasing carbon dioxide\nwe become alkaline inside then the\ncarbon dioxide trigger is no longer\nthere\nfor breathing and you are just sitting\nand while you sit for one minute two\nminutes three minutes\nwithout air in the lungs this is\nknown in the old yogas\nit's called but i i did not know\nit was too abstract where was it i went\ninto the cold water and what happened\ni began to breathe deep that is the\nnatural way and we got\nalienated from the life force from\nbringing oxygen and\nchemistry the right chemistry inside our\nbodies\nand inside the depth of our brain we\nforgot about it we alienated\ndisconnected\nyoga is about connecting\nyoga huge is a sanskrit verb\nfor connecting but then i was reading\nall the upanishads the mahabharata the\nthe kid the greek the christian\nmysticism and all and it didn't make\nsense\nuntil i went into the cold water\nis when i woke up to a feeling\nof this is it a feeling\nand that feeling is inside\nthat feeling now i know how to connect\nand show it to others\nin in one day how to connect\nto internal neurological networks\nwe have never been schooled in\nto learn to use and when we then get\ndepressed or we get the sack or we have\nno money or we have problems\nwe got stressed we cannot tap into these\ninternal mechanisms\nwho are very able to deal with any kind\nof stress\nthat means mental physical emotional\nbacterial viral\ndoesn't matter in the end it is\na cell biological stress and we\nhave internal networks neurological\nnetworks\nuh making us able to deal with it but we\nhave\nnever been schooled there in and there\nwe come\nin to show through meditation\nto show through breathing how to tap\ninto these internal uh neurological\nnetworks\nthat is where i'm at that's where we\ncome together\nand this is a sort of an introduction\nbut i\ndive deep because you know how to go\ndeep\nyourself so we meet somewhere\ndown there and begin to solve the\nparadigm\nbecause in the end now people when they\ntake this on\nthey see and feel stress going away\nbut then then you get the mindset and\nthe mindset\nis not about how to perform even better\nand all that no it's about realigning\noneself\nto the soul realigning oneself to the\nhundred percent capacity of our\nmind absolutely i'm so glad that you are\nsharing so many amazing stories from the\nmahabharat and the ubanishads it's you\nknow books that i've\nstudied and taught for many many years\nand hearing you\nspeak about them in such a relevant way\nis beautiful and one of the things you\nmentioned there whim that i think really\nstands\ntall and true above everything else is\nthis\nunderstanding around the power of the\nlife force and the breath\nand the ability to realign and connect\nand\nfor so many of us and and i felt this\nway you know\nbreathing was something that we never\nthought we had to learn how to do\nwe just do it we do it badly we don't\nknow if we do it well\nwhat are some of the biggest mistakes\nthat we're making in our breathing\nevery day for for years that we're not\neven aware of\nand what should optimal breathing on a\ndaily basis\nlook like i always use the same thing\nthat is the deep breath\nany deep breathing techniques that are\nable\nto deal with the stress in your in the\nfuture will\noriginal your typical specific\nlife is the right one right so\npranayama is the control\nover the life force\nand uh that's pranayama but i could not\nunderstand\nthat before in uh when i was young\ni went into the cold and the cold\ndoesn't show through works it shows\nthrough\na power through aggressive impact\nthrough thousand needles how to be\nnot a pin cushion but to be in control\nto be in control over the depth and\nto change the chemistry to change the\nchemistry\nwith that connect with that\nuh being able consciously to connect\nafter changing the chemistry we are able\nuh to get in with\nour will the neurotransmitters of our\nwill\nin connection with the neurological\npathways\nnature has set within us\nwe got five external and three\ninternal so anything that is able to\ncreate the right chemistry for you\nat will to be able to connect with all\nthese neurological\npathways and to learn to influence and\nto control them\nthat is the right uh breathing technique\nnow i saw a lot of breathing techniques\nbut they did not really\nthey were not effective\nand then going into the cold water i\nstopped\nthinking about it and adopting through\nbooks\nwhat it is i was doing it\nand then the right breathing technique\nbecause the cold as i always say is\nmerciless\nbut righteous it is a teacher\nand the teacher loves you so he doesn't\nmess\naround with you he brings the love\nand the love is not sentimental it's\npowerful\nand it's everyday so much energy\nand a disease suddenly is gone\nand your mood you are able to regulate\nand you are happy all the time\nwhat is this this is what the teacher\ngives you\nbecause he loves you and he comes to you\nand cuts\nevery all the [ __ ] out of you and that\ncan be painful\nin the beginning but it's nothing but\nan awakening i took this for 25 years on\nmy own\nand uh because everybody was saying i\nwas crazy\nand i i i still have to say i i think\nthey are right\ni am bloody crazy i'm crazy about life\nand i want and i am\nchanging fundamentally science medical\nscience as it is because you know as me\nthat the autonomic nervous system was\nconsidered\nafter hundreds of years stated\nscientific\nlanguage and facts and building up of\nwhat our physiology was\ncapable of and not and that\nat will we were not able to tap into the\nautonomic nervous system\nwe were not able to get into the uh\nimmune system\nand we were not able to get into the\nendocrine\nsystem and now it has been shown in 2014\nwe are able to do it we showed that in a\ncomparative study\nand you don't need to go like the yogis\nfor\n20 years or 30 years into seclusion\nand then find all kinds of cities and\nsupernatural powers you are\nmore than normal anybody\neverybody is born to be more than normal\nis born to be super superb\nto be great their mind is great they\ntalk about the mind and that it is\nunlimited in its power but who is\ndoing it now because the\nparadigm now is about producing in the\nworld\nproduction and more and more and more\nit is not about love it is not about\ncaring\nthere is a sort of a moral standard and\nethical standard\nbut it is too much polluting too much\nproduction too much exploiting going on\nthis doesn't serve humanity as it is\nnow and we have come to the moment now\nwhere we have to change we have to show\nthe people the purpose\nof everybody's life but are we capable\nof entering into that new paradigm\nbecause that's the question\nand i say yes for that i built\nup through science because nobody's\ngonna believe a crazy man like me\nthey're going into our freaking cold\nwater\nand a man i'm not gonna do that he's\ncrazy\nand he's breathing so strange hey man\nthat is not good\nhey i don't believe what he said so i go\nthrough science\ni went into television first did all\nkinds of records got the attention of\nthe world\nthen i said hey scientists come in test\non me and i will prove wrong what you\nhave been\nwriting up till now of what we are\ncapable of\nyou say depression cannot be solved but\nby pills and medicaments\nand all kinds of chronic diseases that\ncannot be solved i will show you\nthat we are able to beat inflammation\nand\nto regulate our mood which makes\ndepression bipolar psychosis all these\nthings\ngo away like bad spirits\nwe are able to control that and how\nthis is what i showed in 2014\non inflammation within a quarter over\nhour\nthe inflammation went down after\ninstruction\nin four days not 20 years four days\nnow i can do it in one day i bring\npeople\nto the ability to suppress the\ninflammation\ncaused by an injection of e coli\nnow inflammation is that also the\ndamaging\nfactor of covet we can beat\nthe damaging factor of covet 19\nbut they are not getting to this study\nwhich showed how to prevent\nhow to beat uh covet 19 for example\nin the beginning inflammation i've been\nlooking it up\nthose are interlochens and the\ninterleukin number one number six\nnumber eight and number eleven are\nresponsible\nfor the damage in the lungs creating a\nsort of\nodemia because of the wrong lung\nfunction\nand it acts and it overreacts and you\nget this reaction and suddenly it's\nstuffed inside\nyou cannot breathe anymore but in the\nbeginning you can beat\nthe inflammation and that's why uh\npodcasts\nlike this this is a great channel to get\nto common sounds of people because we\nare built with the doctor\nwithin us we have healing power all\nof us we are born with it we are never\nschooled\nwith it we have learned to follow a\nparadigm\nof dependency on doctors on professors\non signs on pills and medicaments\nand hospitals but not the real\ninvestigative spirit\nthe real investigative spirit is about\nwhat is the soul\nhow to be healthy happy strong how to\nequally\ndivide the power among people\nbecause a happy person is not making war\nis not going and grieving\nfor for money and power a happy person\nis\nunconditionally there but that paradigm\ndoesn't exist\nright now and for that i go\nthrough signs again because i begin to\nbecome too\nphilosophical again is where people\ndon't follow me anymore\nand so i i go back okay\n2014 inflammation considered to be\nnot uh being able to be suppressed\nby humans at will we have proved proven\nuh them after 16 000 cases\nwhere in it went wrong with the same\nexperimental model of endotoxemia\ne coli bacteria injected they all got\nsick and suddenly 12 people\ni uh trained within four days did not\nbecome sick after injection of the e\ncoli\nbacteria and then they saw that these\npersons\nall had tapped into the autonomic\nnervous system\ninto the immune system into the\nendocrine system\nall systems considered to be not\ndone at will by humans\nso that was 2014\nwe reproduced that study bigger\nand we got the same results that is\nnobel prize\nwinners a level\nbut it doesn't make pills it doesn't\nmake money\nit's for free yeah we got it all\nit's just an awakening to this power and\nto quit\nwith the old paradigm of dependency\nand get into the freedom of your own\ncapacity to enter\nin the whole of your own mind that is\nfreedom\nthat is power and with that you can\nrealize through your creative\npower the life force who you are what\nyou are\nthen the soul is there and happy strong\nhealthy\nhey man it's right there that's the\nsource that's the core\nand that's what we want to provide to\nthe people\nbut because that sounds like\nphilosophical\nokay let's get back let's get back to\nthe best\nof brain scans in the world one of them\nis\none of the two best brain scans is in\nhanover\nin hanover germany you know germans\ngermans go to the germ\nthey go really meticulous they\nlook until they find something we never\nsaw\nwith their machines they are very good\nat it so\none of the best braid scans in the world\nis in hanover\nsome doctors and professors took it on\nthis method\nand then normally we have a control of\n16\nin our brain over our neural activity\nat will 16 16\n17 maybe 18. you know whoa\nwhoa intelligent now the guys\nwho did the experiment with this\nbreathing technique\nwith the so-called the retentions\nthis breathing technique coming from\nnature coming from\njust going into the cold man and\ndeep breathing showed in the brain scam\nto ignite and activate not\n16 or 18 percent of the uh\nbrain activity neural activity in the\nbrain but\nhundred hundred that means\nwe are able at will to change the\nchemistry and with that the\nneurology of our brain\nand then suddenly we are no longer\nuh captivated by the\nnarrowed consciousness we got in and we\nare\nschooled within we are able now to enter\ninto that neural activity in any part of\nour\nuh brain and then get to know who we\nreally are and let the creative power\nthe life force the breath and our\nconsciousness\nour consciousness is electricity it's\nlight and it gets in there and it finds\nexactly the way what needs to be done\nto ancestrally uh\nsolve the matters of the encrypted codes\nof our ancestors\nand become and enlighten it\nvery simple this is everybody's\nability we are born with that now it's a\ntime\nto show it and therefore this podcast\nis very important because you are my\nmirror i know you\ni can feel you i can see you and i can\nonly talk like this\nbecause you are there your consciousness\ni get\nthrough this is and from there we use it\nas a stepping stone\nbecause we love people we bring it to\npeople\nwe want to enlighten people hey man it\nhas arrived it had the soul has arrived\nand your creativity is your choice now\nwhat do you want we want to give it all\ni love your passion but i'm what i'm\nwhat i love about what you're saying and\nplease everyone who's listening or\nwatching right now\nplay pay close attention to how whim is\nconstantly\ngoing between the philosophy and the\nscience and the practice\nbecause it's all three of them together\nthis isn't just a mindset shift it's a\nphysical shift\nbut it's also a salt shift and so when\nyou have shifts in all three areas that\nare aligned at the same time\nthat's when you see this change now wim\ni want you to share with\nus because some people may be aware some\npeople may not be\nbut when we talk about your incredible\nachievements i also think you're such a\ngreat storyteller of what you've\nlived and i'd love for you to share with\nus when you're climbing mount everest in\nshorts you know what are you thinking\nabout during the hike like what is going\non here because for most of us\nyou know even wearing a full jacket and\nsnow boots\nin the new york winter would be seen as\nstill it's cold\nwhat to speak of you being in shorts on\nmount\neverest what is happening here what is\nhappening in the soul\nand and what is happening in your body\nat that time\nthere is more than meets the eye\nand my intuition my instinct\nwas ready to take on a bigger challenge\nto mirror\nto get to know that instinct to get to\nknow what this\nintuition is pointing at i just have to\nfollow it so it is a gut feeling a gut\nfeeling got into me and\nwas saying okay first they climbed her\nmount everest\nin clothes and uh\nwith oxygen then somebody did it\nwithout oxygen and i think it's now time\nto do it without\noxygen and without growth\njust following the god you know hey why\nnot\ni just take it as a challenge because\nwhat is in the mind a communal mind\nthat is the result of the progression\nand evolution of our minds and i say\nokay i want to get on\nbecause the mind where it is now is\nstill\nquite incapable of bringing peace love\nstrength happiness to all the people and\nall the beings in the world we got to\ninvestigate more\nso i i'm the guinea pig i go and do\nsomething something uh unknown\nbecause that what is unknown is like\ntrodden paths pathways i don't want to\ngo\nthere trodden pathway i want to go out\nthere\nto find something new so\nfollowing the guard i went to mount\neverest\ni was there and i found myself at a\ncertain moment\nuh after weeks of being there alone\nsuddenly covered in a whiteout\non 6000 meters that means like eighteen\nthousand\nninety thousand feet and less than half\nthe oxygen is over there\nthere was no sharepoint with me no guide\nthere is i mean there is no road there\nthere\nis not even a path it was snow\njust white a white out\nand i was just in my shorts\nand that was the moment where i met\nthe the spirit of the mountain that why\ni was there i\nmet it fully i shook france i shook the\nhands\nof mount everest right over there my\nlesson was\nover there at that moment i felt\noh now i know why i'm here now i am\nconnecting\nwith this being here and i was\nnot in paranoia i was not panicking\ni was not called i was not anything of\nthose things i\nfound myself observing myself\nthat i was without all that\nthat hey i just feel good i feel light\nand there i was in a white out\ncompletely lost\non 90 000 feet in my shorts\nthree hours later i found a camp\nsomewhere\ni could have found nothing as well\nbut i was okay i felt great\nand that it showed to me the lesson\nwas that hey man any stress if you\nfollow your gut\nyou will be able to take it on as a test\nas a lesson of life because the greatest\nlesson of life\ndeath itself you\nwill prepare yourself for the next stage\nand don't be afraid because it is\nbeautiful\njust follow your god i think\nof death which i found in another\nchallenge under the eyes i lost the way\nunder the eyes\nand i had no goggles on and so i could\nnot see i\nwas a blur and i was trying to find a\nhole\nwhile swimming breath hold and i\npassed a hole apparently but i couldn't\nsee it\nand i went to uh more than twice the\nolympic distance under the water\nbut there was no agony i was fully in\ncontrol my consciousness\nwent less less more sleepy sleepy sleepy\nbut there was absolutely no pain\nno agony the light at a certain moment\nis sleepy\nunder the eyes breath hold uh over\nafter four or five minutes under the\neyes\ni had no oxygen left in their body but\nmy consciousness was still there\nand it was okay i was going to sleep\nand uh then somebody grabbed me by the\nankle brought me back to the 60-yard\nhole and i came out of there\nand there i said there i\nrealized that death has\nis no nothing negative i\ni i i won over the fear of death\nand our concept whatever we have\nalerts the fear the unknown the\nconfusion about\nall that that i lost over there and so i\ngot many stories\nof many challenges on mount everest\nin the in the snow in the antarctics and\nunder the water on the ice cap of a\nmeter or standing for hours in ice or\nhanging by one finger in mid winter on\ntwo kilometers up\nin the air nothing nothing is\nthere but your body and your mind to be\ntested\nto get a full-blown realization of who\nyou are and what you are\nand that goes past any fear\nany blockage it's a it's a a knowledge\nwhich is omnipresent and it has all the\npurpose\nit leads like the life force like a\nriver\nand suddenly you get there and you\nbecome one with it all\nand that one is healthy happy strong\nwow and there we are and that's the way\ni wake up\nevery day what are some of those\npositive stresses\nthat people can put their minds and\nbodies through\nto get to that stage so none of us are\ngoing to run to that\nbeing on you know an everest in our\nshorts what are some of the things\npeople can do every day\nto start building that muscle so that we\nwake up\nlike you're saying like you wake up how\ndo people start doing that daily the\nlittle things we can do every day\njust know that you are built to be happy\nstrong and healthy\nyou know dave asprey asked the\nbulletproof guy\nhe asked me when what is enlightenment\nand please put it in one sentence\ni said uh okay okay here it comes\nin one sentence just be happy strong and\nhealthy\nthat what makes you feel disconnected\nfrom yourself\nthat is not you that is some other force\ninflicted upon you if you know it yes or\nno\nit does not matter the matter is connect\nwith yourself find happiness strength\nand health\nthat's who you are that's where your\nenergy is needed for\nthere is the purpose and that leads to\nenlightenment\nevery day and listen you don't need to\nclimb mount everest\nyou don't need oh no because i had to do\nthat because it was not\nin the books what i tried to find so i\nhad to follow my gut\nand it got me in some strange situations\nand then i found out i can get out\nanything\nnow i'm not doing that anymore because i\ndon't need it\ni don't need it and i'm showing in\nscience\nincredible stuff that is written not to\nbe\nable to be done they a say a\na transformational technique that will\nchange\nmental health care michigan detroit\npsychiatry wayne state university\nthey did tests on me and on the brain\nand then they found out i'm controlling\ntapping into\nareas of the brain that were\nnot known for humans to\nuh to get there at will and with that\nthey found the keys how to unlock\nthe potential to uh\nto solve mental disorders of\nany kind to get into mood\ninto emotion itself and this was all\nunknown but i know we are built to be\nhappy strong and healthy\nget into this breathing just a quarter\nover hour\nit has shown through signs to\neffectively change the biochemistry\nbecoming very ph value very high\nalkaline\nit peaks it spikes\nthen it comes back in the right order\nand then suddenly you feel\nthat the stress is gone what is that\nthat is your natural\nstate your natural biochemistry\nthe way we are schooled has created a\nconditioning that messes with our\nbiochemistry\nso we have to make sure in the morning\nuh\nto on empty stomach to get our right\nbiochemistry going and with that we get\ninto this new paradigm\nwhere do you believe in do you believe\nin i cannot\ni cannot i cannot or i can\ni can i am i am happy strong and healthy\nthat is\nwho i am and the rest needs to be\nremoved\nout of my body out of my mind that\nparadigm\nthat made us dependent on doctors and\nall that\nhey man let it go because you don't need\nit and not even the doctors need it\nyou need to be you yourself within\ncapacitated by mother nature birthright\nto uh control 100 of your brain\nyour immune system the hormonal system\nlymphatic\nand vascular system all the systems\nbecause you are\nin connection that if you go back\nto patanjali uh uh like 1200 years and\nsome more\nhe says in the beginning about a\nconnection\nuh huge that's the verb\nit says\nyoga is the silencing of the\nmodifications\nof the brain then the seer appears\nthe seer is who we are but if there is\nthis turmoil of our thinking\nwhich are signals which are messengers\nthat something is\nwrong that's why we think all the time\nwhen that comes to rest\nthen the blood flow goes into the depth\nof the brain\nand the whole brain is illuminated with\nthe right neural activity and it's done\nthrough simple breathing exercises and\nthen\nyou are able to change at will to\nwho you are and what you are and you are\na happy strong\nhealthy person all of you with a\nbeautiful mind\ni want everyone who's listening and\nwatching to start repeating that to them\nto themselves because women's repeated\nit\nso many times and the the signal the\nenergy that i'm getting from women is\ni need to say that to myself every\nmorning and every night because the\nchallenge is that the noise that builds\nup in the mind\nis constantly telling us the opposite so\nevery day we say to ourselves\ni'm tired i'm stressed i'm\noverwhelmed and pressurized so we are\nsaying i am this\nthe all the time and so it's not like\nyou're adding some funky thing to your\nlife you're just replacing it\nand you're replacing it with something\nthat's actually going to push you in the\nright direction and what i'm going to\nask women to do for us now\nis women i'd love for you to guide us\nthrough a simple breathing technique\nthat we can follow when we're feeling\noverwhelmed or stressed or proud i'm\ngonna do it with you and i'd love you to\nguide us as you've been saying just now\nbecause i really want people to get into\nthat i am healthy happy and strong\nand and build as a mindset but to find\nthe breathing to match it so can we do\nthat now\nyes of course amazing let's do it\nokay we are all relaxed now\nis gone the world is gone\nhere we are a vassal beautiful vessel\nbeautiful mind and that's\nwho we are shake it up shake it out yeah\nnice right on okay cool\nmove your belly fully in\nyour chest and now you let it go\nonce again pull in\nletting go\npull in\nletting go this technique has been\napproved\ngo on in the university so we don't need\nto mind\nit works deeply more deeper than any\nbooks\nhas written about okay fully in letting\ngo\ntingling can come you can\nfeel light-headed loom in the body it's\nall all right\nwhatever you feel different okay there\nwe go again pull it\nletting go\nput it\nletting go\npull in\nletting go pull in\nlet it go just follow the breath\nfood in\nletting go\npull in\nletting go pull in\nletting go pull in\nletting go pull in\nletting go pulling\nletting go ten more fully in\nletting go tingling\nall good fully in letting go whatever\nyou feel different\nbreathe into it\nmake it stronger intensify whatever\nyou feel make it stronger\nletting go fully\nletting go five more\nletting go pull in\nletting go lost to pulling\ngo fully\nletting go here comes the last one pull\nit\nlet it go and stop\nclose your mouth no breathing no\nneed we have blown off the carbon\ndioxide\nwe are very alkaline in the body\nthis makes the neural activity able to\ngo everywhere in the body\nit makes it go away any blockage\nand blockages are related to fear\nbecause then we have no control\nthen fear comes but we have control\nbecause we are connected to the flow to\nthe light\nto the neural activity to the autonomic\nnervous system\nas simple as it is witness\njust be because the body is restoring\nitself to its original nature\nthat is a flow in the brain\nin the body all connected\nit cleanses it recognizes\nit's able even to go into the dna now\namazing whatever\nis in the depth and wants to come up\njust\nwitness and let it go\ni say five four\nthree two one\nfully in\nhold fully in and hold\nand squeeze it to your head the\ncerebrospinal\nfluid you squeeze to the head so the\nblood flow gets\ninto the brain the brain stem the\nperiaqueductal\nthe deepest of the brain and there is\nthe seat of the soul\nitself and it gets nourishment\nit decalcifies\nthree two one and let it go\nif you do this two three rounds in the\nmorning\nthen you for sure have changed the\nbiochemistry\nwhich makes you able to connect with the\nimmune system\nat will as we have shown to the\nendocrine system\nto be able to regulate your mood your\nenergy\nthe metabolic energetic uh processes\nin the cell to create energy and your\nimmune system\nit's all there very simple\nthose are just three rounds when can it\nbe so simple\ni am sorry it is so simple\ni love it further
