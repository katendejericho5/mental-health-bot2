    "transcript": "breakthroughs we tend to think begin\nwith a smart answer\nbut they often begin with a smart\nquestion that reframes a problem\nand sees it in a light that\nno one else is seeing it\n[Music]\nhey everyone welcome back to on purpose\nthe number one health podcast in the\nworld thanks to each and every\nsingle one of you who come back every\nsingle week to listen\nlearn and grow now i'm really excited\nabout bringing you\nfascinating guests where we can dissect\ntheir minds\nunderstand their concepts and theories\nand figure out how to practically live\ntheir messages in our lives and you know\nhow much i love\nauthors and how much i love books and i\nremember seeing this\non a list of books that adam grant and\nsusan kane had published\nand it immediately caught my eye because\nthe title was think like a rocket\nscientist and i thought to myself\nthis is cool like who's written this and\nit happened to be a former rocket\nscientist\nand i was fascinated because obviously\nas you know my books will think like a\nmonk written by me a former monk\nand i think oh here we go we've got\nsomething in common we're trying to\nchallenge people to\nthink differently and so this book\nimmediately caught my\neye i've read through a ton of it\nalready and can't wait to finish it\nbut i'm so excited that today i get to\nsee it with the author\nosan viral is a rocket scientist turned\naward-winning professor\nauthor and podcast host a native of\nistanbul he moved to america\nto major in astrophysics at cornell\nuniversity\nthen served on the operations team for\nthe 2003\nmars exploration rovers project viral\nlater became a law professor\nat lewis and clark college and wrote the\ndemocratic coup d'art\npublished by oxford university press\nvowel's articles have appeared in\noutlets such as the wall street journal\nnewsweek\nbbc time cnn the washington post\nslate and foreign policy now this is\ngoing to be really interesting to you\nguys because i know you like regular\ncontent\nhe blogs weekly on his website\nozanviral.com will give you the link\nlater\nand viral has delivered keynote speeches\nto both small and large groups\nat major corporations non-profits and\ngovernment institutions\ntoday as i said we're here to speak\nabout his new book which is think like a\nrocket scientist\nthe simple strategies you can use to\nmake giant\nleaps in work and life azan wonderful to\nhave you here today\njay delighted to be here thank you so\nmuch for having me on yeah absolutely\nit's not every day that you get to sit\ndown with the former rocket scientist so\nuh\nthis is this is i see this as a huge\nhonor or a former monk for me\nyou know this is like almost the\nbeginning of a joke like a rocket\nscience a former rocket scientist and a\nformer monk walk into a bar\nso true we'll see what happens next you\nknow they always say like a good\nconversation is between like\npeople who just have really crazy unique\nexperiences and i feel like\nthis is kind of like that you know like\nrocket scientists at least from my\nuneducated brain you know it's all about\nexploring and going outward and seeing\nwhat's possible\nand living as a monk is all about going\ninward and seeing what's possible\nand so it's it's it's fascinating to sit\ndown with you and think about that but\nbut i want to start off with this\nquestion as we dive into your book and\ntalk about many things\nhow do you actually become a rocket\nscientist like like what is the process\nof that because\ngrowing up i didn't even know that\nexisted and\noften we kind of refer to it in some\nways like a monk we refer to it as a\nterm that\nit's kind of like make-believe or\nimaginary or you know\nit's not necessarily a real thing so\ntell us that there is no college major\ncalled rocket science\nthere's actually probably no one with\nlike the official job title rocket\nscientist\nwe just use the term rocket science\ncolloquially to refer to the science and\nengineering\nbehind space travel so for example i was\nan astrophysics major but you can also\nbecome a rocket scientist by\nmajoring in aeronautical engineering for\nexample so for me\nthe term is used broadly to refer to\npeople\nworking on space travel people working\non\nconverting the seemingly impossible into\nthe possible\nit's great to hear that because i was\nthinking well i was like what if what if\nwhat if there were actually job titles\ncalled rocket science\nbut tell me about this uh when you\ndecided to write this book\nwhy did you think it was important\nsimilarly like i was trying to challenge\npeople's mindsets\nwith my title why was it important for\nyou to challenge people\nright now to start thinking like a\nrocket scientist what is it about the\nthinking of\na rocket scientist that is so vital and\nimportant for everyone today\nso i opened the book with telling the\nstory of president john f kennedy\nstepping up to the podium at\nrice university stadium this was in\nseptember 1962\nand he pledged to land a man on the moon\nand return him safely to the earth\nbefore the decade is out\nnow at the time this was literally a\nmoonshot\nand a lot of people in the audience\nthought he was crazy\npeople at nasa thought he was out of his\nmind because so many prerequisites for\nmaking the moon landing a reality hadn't\nbeen done yet\nno american astronaut had worked outside\nof a spacecraft\ntwo spacecraft had never docked together\nin space nasa didn't know if the\nthe lunar surface was solid enough to\nsupport a lander\nor whether the communication system\nwould work on the moon i mean\njfk actually said some of the metals\nrequired to build the rockets hadn't\neven been invented\nwe just jumped into the cosmic void and\nhoped that we grow wings on the way up\nand grow those wings we did in less than\nseven years after kennedy's pledge\nneil and buzz took their giant leap for\nmankind\nand the the contrast i like to draw is\na child who was just six years old when\nthe wright brothers took their first\npower flight so this was back in 1903 it\nlasted for\nabout 12 seconds moved 100 feet would\nhave been 72\nwhen flight became powerful enough to\nput a man on the moon\ni mean think about that for a second\nthat's 66 years that's within a single\nhuman lifespan and that giant leap is\noften attributed to technology right\nthis was a triumph of technology\nbut i don't think that's right i think\nthe triumph really belongs to the humans\nbehind the technology\nand a certain thought process they used\nto turn the seemingly impossible\ninto the possible so i wanted to write a\nbook about that thought process\nin part because rocket science it's\nit's such an intimidating term right\nhence the saying like this is rocket\nscience or it's not rocket science so we\ntend to put these people in a corner\nand say let's just reserve for geniuses\nright i don't want to know anything\nabout that because it's too complicated\nso i didn't want to write a book about\nthe science behind rocket science but i\nwanted to take these\nnine simple strategies from from rocket\nscience about\napproaching uncertainty about innovating\nwithin constraints\ntalk to people about how rocket\nscientists approach failure how they\napproach success\nand walk them through really simply how\nthey can take these principles\nand use them in their own lives to to\nmake giant leaps\nyeah and i love that i love how\npractical that is because i think for\nanyone\nand obviously you've given a very grand\nexample of like you know when\njohn f kennedy is pledging to go to the\nmoon\nbut you think about even in our lives\nlike so many times\nwe have ideas or dreams or things that\nwe would love to\nwork towards but we kind of see it as\nunreachable\nright and we kind of put them and leave\nthem there on the shelf and we go oh\nwell that's never really going to happen\nfor me\nit's probably not possible but what i\nfeel like you're trying to do with this\nbook and that's what i saw when i was\nreading\nreading it is that these nine strategies\nthat you share\nthey're actually like little steps to to\nbe able to make that giant leap in your\nown life\nand and i really appreciate that because\ni think whenever you hear about these\nespecially these big\nyou know these big statements i think\nthere's a famous statement from\nhenry ford and it was like you know if i\nasked people what they would have wanted\nthey would have said foster horses\nthat's right and it's like you know that\npeople don't have the vision\nto really bring that into reality and i\nfeel like you're trying to ground that\nfor all of us through all these nine\nstrategies and i love the\nstudies that you do share and the\nstories that you do share in here\nwhat was the one that surprised you the\nmost right what was that what was the\noutcome or the or the kind of principle\nthat you actually thought you know\nthat's actually really counter-intuitive\nlike\nyou may have thought of it some way but\nactually it was like oh no that that\nthat totally blew my own mind\ni think the last chapter in the book\nwhich is called nothing\nfails like success is probably one of\nthe more\ncounter-intuitive takeaways from the\nbook right because we tend to think of\nsuccess as a good thing\num i devote that chapter to explaining\nhow success can create complacency\nand i i discussed two the the biggest\ndisasters in rocket science history\nwhich are the challenger and columbia\nspace shuttle\ndisasters which claimed the lives of all\nseven astronauts on board\num and those disasters happened after\nnasa had experienced a string of\ntriumphant successes and nasa began to\ndevelop tunnel vision\neven when engineers were raising their\nhands and saying look\nthe o-rings which were responsible for\nthe explosion of the\nof the challenger they were being\ndamaged flight after flight\nand one engineer actually six months\nbefore the challenger disaster he wrote\na memo\nthat turned out to be really prescient\nhe said if we don't do something about\nthe problem\nwith the o-rings which by the way are\nthese flexible rings\nthat seal the um the the boosters\nto make sure that hot gases don't escape\nso they serve a critical function\nhe wrote a memo saying that if we don't\nfix this problem\nit's going to be a catastrophe of the\nhighest order\ni'm talking the loss of human life but\nthe managers\nignored the engineers requests\nbecause they thought look in previous\nmissions we succeeded\neven when there was damage to the o-ring\nso as long as we repeat the process that\nwe followed yesterday\nthen success is is inevitable and\nbasically the same thing happened after\nthe\nafter the columbia space shuttle\ndisaster as well the technical flaw was\ndifferent\nbut the underlying cultural flaw of\nsuccess creating complacency of success\ncreating conformity\nwas very much very much the same and so\nto me that that was really\ncounter-intuitive because you know\nthe our first instinct when we succeed\nis to start lighting cigars right\npopping champagne corks to start\ncelebrating\nbut when we do that we fail to realize\nthat we\nmay have succeeded despite making a bad\ndecision\ndespite making a serious misstep\nand if you don't sort of sit and conduct\nthe same type of analysis that might\nfollow a failure if you don't look back\nand say\nyou know what why what role did luck\nand privilege and opportunity play in\nthe success if you don't do that\nsort of reckoning then those small\nlittle failures will eventually\nsnowball into something that that you\ncan't control so i think there's a lot\nof value to\nthinking of ourselves even after we\nsucceed as a work in progress\nso i think the moment you think you've\nmade it is the moment you stop growing\nthe moment you declare yourself to be an\nexpert on something is the moment that\nyou start\nyou know making confident declarations\nwithout backing it up with the facts\nthe moment you think you're in the lead\nis the moment you\njust stop listening to other people and\nso\nso i think there's a lot of value to\neven when success arrives to staying\nhumble\nand realizing that you know what you\nsucceeded\nnot necessarily because of your genius\nbut you may have gotten lucky\nand if you don't fix the errors that\nhappen in the\nthe path to that success then um\nthen that those failures or small\nfailures might catch up to you in the\nlong run\nyeah i think i think that's a super\npowerful and strong message i think\nthere's this\ni saw this really good viral video\nrecently i think i shared it to on\ninstagram it was\nit was a video that someone had compiled\nof\nand and the the tagline was don't\ncelebrate too early\nand it was a compilation of like\nswimming races marathons sprints\nwhere the person just started\ncelebrating when they're about to hit\nthe line\nand then number two came and took their\nplace and it's happened multiple times\nand obviously that's in a very\nthat's in a very specific you know race\nscenario but even in life it's so much\nso\ni feel like yeah you don't learn as much\nwhen you win unless you conduct\nthat analysis and i remember in a very\nsmall way i remember every time i\nif i did well in exams i would always\nregret it the year later when i'd be\nlike wait a minute how did i do well\nlast year like i wish i wrote down\nwhy i did well right because then i\nwould have something to go off\nand and you're so right that there's\nsuch a need for that\npost-win analysis and\nthe appreciation of not just luck but\nthe appreciation of things that lined up\nuh the appreciation of uh things that\njust\nhappened uh not even by chance of luck\nbut by happened because\nthe things that went right that you\ndidn't expect right and i think\nit's almost like when we win we're like\noh we expected that to happen\nbut but when we lose it's like although\ni didn't expect that and then that's\nwhen we tear it apart\nnow i love that and and i agree i think\nthere's such a need for that\ni guess a lot of people feel and you\naddress this too a lot of people feel\nlike they never win\nuh and and so they're more in that\ncategory of\nfailing and and i think this i've seen\nthis quote before and seen it thrown\naround before called fail like a\nscientist\nand it's almost like felt like a rocket\nscientist sounds even more\naligned with it and it's and you talk\nabout failure in the book\ntell us about how to really fail\neffectively because you talk about not\njust failing fast but learning\nfast and and i love that change and and\ni want to know more about that because i\nthink\nwe hear a lot about oh just fail and\nit's okay to make mistakes and it's okay\nto fail\nbut i'm more fascinated by how we can\nreally fail effectively\nand and dive into that because i think\nfor most people they don't win and get\ncomplacent\nwe fail but we don't learn fast enough\nso let's let's dive into that principle\nyeah that's absolutely right jay and i i\nthink that the distinction that you just\nmentioned between failing fast and\nlearning fast is a really important one\nbecause that mantra of fail fast fail\noften fail forward is\nall the rage these days in silicon\nvalley um i was reading that and i\ntalked about this in the book too that\nsilicon valley companies are now holding\num funerals for failed startups\ncomplete with like djs\nspinning records and bagpipes and and\nliquor flowing freely\nand you know and i don't buy it i don't\nbuy it because\ngoing back to our discussion with\nsuccess too when you celebrate something\nyou're probably not learning from it and\nso uh to me the goal should be to\nto learn fast to not fail fast and\nresearch really bears this out too\nand i said a research study of cardiac\nsurgeons who actually get worse\nafter they fail after they botch a\nprocedure they don't get better\num failed entrepreneurs are no more\nsuccessful at\ntaking a company public than first-time\nentrepreneurs\nit happens we don't learn from from\nfailure because\noften we attribute failure when we fail\nto external factors\nyou know we say we failed not because i\nmade a mistake but we failed because it\nwasn't the right time right we failed\nbecause\nof the customers or the competitors or\nthe regulators\nand when we don't do that internal\nreckoning\nthen we don't learn from anything so\nmoving from failure to failure without\nreally\nlearning is is a recipe for for disaster\nand so scientists take a very different\napproach to to failure\nto them and this is true for successful\nbusinesses and successful people as well\nfailure it can be the best teacher if\nyou know how to approach it properly\nand almost all breakthroughs\nare evolutionary not revolutionary\nso let me let me let me talk about what\ni mean by that because you're right a\nlot of people think like\nthey're not succeeding but they're not\nsucceeding because\ntheir time horizon is oriented toward\nthe short term\nright they're looking at the next week\nthe next month\nand they're not looking as kennedy did\nseven years down the road or even a year\ndown the road\nso if you look at scientific history\nevery single breakthrough\nhas been evolutionary albert einstein's\nfirst several proofs\nfor e equals mc squared completely\nfailed\nthomas edison famously said you know i\nhaven't failed i just found 10 000 ways\nthat won't work um james dyson the\nfamous british inventor you know he\nhe spent i think 15 years came up with\nover 5 000 prototypes\nof his bagless vacuum until he found the\none\nthat worked so we tend to be obsessed\nwith\nwith grand openings but the opening\ndoesn't have to be grand\nas long as the finale is and i think one\nof the best things that we can do\nbecause and i see this with businesses\nwith politicians businesses are chasing\nthese short-term quarterly outcomes\npoliticians are looking at the immediate\nelectoral cycle\nbut the businesses and the people who\ncan calibrate their thinking\nfor the long term know that they might\nhave to endure some pain in the short\nterm that they might\nhave to fail a few times but if they're\nlearning from each of these failures\nif they're learning fast that's going to\nbe the the recipe for creating something\nextraordinary\ndown the road and when i look at my own\nlife you know any success i had with the\nbook came because of decisions i made\nthree years ago\nfour years ago not decisions i made two\nmonths ago\nthe the really important decisions tend\nto have a long life span\nbut once you start planting the seeds\nthey'll grow\nslowly but if you keep doing that\nthen they become something that's really\nfar more than what what you could have\nexpected which is true for the moon\nlanding as well right i mean seven years\nfrom kennedy's place\nto landing on the moon is really\nincredible and it's because\nfor once we decided to look\nnot for the next year not for the next\ntwo years but\nfor seven years down the road yeah\ndefinitely that reminds me of a\nstatement i heard from bill gates where\nhe said that we\noverestimate what we can do in one year\nand underestimate what we can do in 10\nyears\nand i guess it's hard though\nto feel like when you're making a\ndecision\nit never feels right because we decide\nwhether\ndecisions feel right based on the result\nand that's actually a mistake i feel\nbecause\nsometimes you can get the result that\nyou didn't want\nfrom the right decision for you at the\ntime but i feel like so much of our\ndecision making is\nis given validation based on the result\ndoes that make sense yeah yeah yeah\nexactly\nwe paralyzed ourselves because we're\nlike i don't know if this is the right\ndecision because i don't know what's\ngonna happen in three years so how do\nyou make a decision\nregardless of trying to live three years\nahead because in one sense you\nno one knows right no one can see that\nyeah and i want to underscore what you\njust\nsaid jay because it's so so important\nit's possible\nto do lots of things right and still\nfail\nand it's also possible to do lots of\nthings wrong\nand still succeed yes this happens all\nthe time\ni mean this happens in soccer this\nhappens in\nlanding a rover on mars this happens in\nbusinesses but we're so obsessed with\nwith the outputs that we forgot we\nforget the quality\nof the inputs and so on a personal level\nthe the thing that i i do is and the\nthing that i advise other people and\nbusinesses to do is to\nto reorient their focus away from\noutcomes\nand and toward inputs so for me\nfor example writing the book if i'm\nthinking about\nbestseller lists and how many copies the\nbook is going to sell\ntwo things are going to happen one is\ngoing to completely rob the joy\nout of what i do i mean i love writing\nit's like the thing i\nlove the most when i get up in the\nmorning i spend three hours writing and\nthat's a great day for me\nbut once i start thinking about quantity\nof sales and best seller lists\ncompletely robs the joy away from what i\ndo and number two\nand perhaps worse when i when when\npeople start focusing on outcomes\nthey start making bad decisions because\nthey they try to sort of anticipate what\nthe market is going to want\nand sort of cater to that that's\ncertainly an important part of the\nequation but it\ncan't be the only part of the equation\nand so often\nwe're so narrowly focused on the outcome\nthat we forget about the the inputs the\nthe things that are actually going to\nmake\nour work work great so i think that\npivot from\noutcome to to process is a as a really\nimportant one\nand another useful strategy that i've\nused in the past too that i've seen\nsuccessful businesses\nuse is the pre-mortem so to take some of\nthe focus out of the outcome you\nbasically say the pre-boardroom says\nlet's assume that whatever we're working\non failed\nand work backward from that to figure\nout what may have gone wrong\nand then you sit down and say okay well\nit failed because of x y and z\nso for example for me the failure would\nbe\ni didn't submit the book on time to the\npublisher and then i work backwards from\nthat to figure out well i may have\ni have failed right it could be because\ni didn't do the research in a timely\nfashion it could be because\ni wasn't doing the writing on a\nconsistent basis and then you figure out\nbasically ways to\nguard against those threats and and that\nalso has a way of i think\nidentifying things that could lead to\npotentially bad outcomes\nbut really the the best thing we can do\nis to\nto be more input oriented and and less\noutcome oriented and that requires after\nby the way both failure and success\nasking the same questions\nwhat went wrong with the success what\nwent right with the success what went\nwrong with this\nfailure and what went right with this\nfailure that takes the focus off of the\noutcome\nand and points you toward what matters\nwhich are the inputs\nyeah i'm so glad we agree on that i've\nactually shared something very very\nsimilar with the book when i get asked\nthe same thing it's it's i couldn't\nagree with you more it's such a\nobsession with the process because it's\nthat obsession with the process that\ngives the best opportunity for the\nresult exactly as opposed to\nthe focus on the result and the reward\ncompletely takes you away\nfrom this current ability to be creative\nand\nwith what you were talking about\ncreators i've often described it as like\nselfish creators and sellout creators so\ni think if like a sellout creator is\na creator who's trying to pander so much\nto the audience that\nyou miss out on your inner voice which\nis actually what makes it unique\nand then the selfish creator is kind of\nlike the person who writes a book that\nonly they want to read\nand that we know that isn't good either\nbecause it's kind of like\nyou know and so yeah finding that\nbalance but but still\nalways focus on the input i think is so\nimportant before you start focusing on\nthinking about how to market something\nor\nor put something out there and those are\nsome really powerful\nentrepreneurial tips i wanted to ask you\nif you could explain\nwhat first principles thinking is and\nhow\nelon musk has used it uh because i think\nthat would really interest my audience\nas well\nsure so when elon musk was first\nthinking about sending rockets to\nto mars to to take people to mars he\nfirst began by shopping for used rockets\non the american market and musk was a\nreally rich guy this was right after he\nsold paypal to ebay\nbut even as wealthy as he was rockets\nwere way too expensive on the american\nmarket\nso he then went to russia i kid you not\nto shop for\ndecommissioned intercontinental\nballistic missiles\nwithout the nuclear warheads on top of\ncourse but even those were too expensive\nso one of his plane rides back from\nrussia empty-handed he had an epiphany\nand he arrived at that epiphany using\nfirst principles thinking\nso first principles thinking is a way of\ncutting through assumptions that are\ncluttering your thinking\nas if you're cutting through a jungle\nwith a machete\nyou're basically unlearning what you\nknow you're leaving behind the baggage\nof history\nto pave the way for a better tomorrow\nthe analogy i give in the book is the\ndifference between a cover band\nand an original singer so a cover band\nplays somebody else's songs\nbut the original singer goes back to the\nraw materials the musical notes\nand goes through the painstaking process\nof of creating something new\nso elon musk realized initially that he\nwas playing the role of a cover band\nand trying to buy raucous that other\npeople had built and so\nhe went back to first principles and\nasked himself\nwait a minute what is a what is a rocket\nmade out of like what are the\nnon-negotiable raw materials of a rocket\nand how much would that cost if a if i\njust bought these on the open market\nand then built the rockets myself and it\nturned out that it was like two percent\nof the typical price of a rocket which\nis a crazy ratio so he just said screw\nit\ni'm gonna build my rockets my next\ngeneration rockets\nfrom scratch and first principles\nthinking led him\nalong with jeff bezos as a space company\nbelow origin\nto upend another deeply entrenched\nassumption in rocket science\nso for decades rockets that\ncarried their payload into orbit\ncouldn't be reused\nthey would burn up in the atmosphere or\nplunge into the ocean requiring an\nentirely new rocket to be rebuilt now\nimagine doing that\nfor commercial flights right you fly\nfrom i'm in portland you're in\nlos angeles jay i fly from portland to\nlos angeles\nthe passengers d-plane someone steps up\nto the plane and just torches it\nsounds crazy but that's basically what\nwe did for rockets for\nfor decades and a modern rocket isn't\nthat much more and more expensive than a\nboeing\n737 but space flight is so much more\nexpensive because rockets couldn't be\nreused\nat least not efficiently and spacex and\nblue origin have both\nchanged that they're reusing numerous\nrocket stages\nsending them back out to to space like\nlike certified pre-owned vehicles and so\nwhen\nwhen spacex took two nasa astronauts to\nthe\ninternational space station it was a few\nweeks ago when we're recording this\nbut the the first stage of the rocket\nthat carried them into space\nlanding back landed back in the on this\nbarge in the middle of the ocean\nthere's now a landing pad next to the\nlaunch pad at kennedy space center and\nthat's a new thing\nin rocket science because both elon musk\nand jeff bezos were able to look at the\nproblem\nin a different light than than others\nhad done before\nand questioned an assumption that\nthat so many people um in the industry\nhad taken for granted\nyeah yeah that's fascinating i had no\nidea i've never heard that before i i\ndefinitely didn't know that it's what i\nlike about it the most is just that\ni think so many of us in our life fall\ninto the bad habit of\nallowing the assumptions that we hear of\nan industry\nor a group or a society or a community\nto become our assumptions and our\nreality and it's like\nyou know almost like uh assumptions\nuh just just putting on other people's\nassumptions as if there are clothes\nand and then all of a sudden it feels\nlike there are assumptions and they just\nblock us from\nbeing really creative being really\ninnovative and finding these\nsolutions and and we may not even be\ntrying to solve space travel\nright but but the point is that the same\nprinciple is so powerful for us whether\nit's with our habits or\neven whether it's with what we think is\npossible and and\nyou know i think so often we hear things\nlike oh but you need money to make more\nmoney\nlike as an example and it's like oh well\nif you adopt that assumption it means\nyou will be waiting a very very long\ntime\nor exactly or we have an assumption of\nlike oh no you have to have\neducated or trained in this way to be in\nthat industry or whatever it may be\nyou know and and i think you're so right\nthat all of these things end up blocking\nus\nand and just yeah just kind of wasting\ntime\nthey make us waste time when we think\nthat way yeah\nand what you strive for ends up becoming\nyour ceiling right\nso if you're striving to be mediocre\nthen that's the best you can do um you\ncan't always get what you want\nas the rolling stones remind us but if\nyou aim a little bit higher\nthan you have in the past it's amazing\nand especially if you're\nreoriented toward toward the long term\nit's amazing\nwhat you're able to to accomplish i\nthink many of us\noperate out of like jail cells of our\nown making\nlike we're like gripping the bars we're\ncursing the guards you know\nlet us out but the door is open actually\nyou can just get out and leave\nbut we're operating under so many\nassumptions and by the way this is not\nour fault\nthese assumptions usually come from\nsocial conditioning they come from\neducational conditioning as well\nlike we've been seduced into believing\nthat flying lower\nis safer than flying higher that small\ndreams are\nare wiser than moonshots and when you\nhear that message over and over and over\nagain\nit becomes your jail cell i grew up in\nistanbul\nin very humble circumstances but my\nparents made me believe\nthat basically if i worked hard for it\nthat anything was\nwas within my reach and so when i was 17\nyears old i learned english as a second\nlanguage\ni came to the united states by myself my\nparents didn't speak a word of english\nbut they encouraged me to to pursue my\ndreams so i remember\ni was 17 years old i'd gotten into\ncornell\nand i was sitting in istanbul and i was\nobsessed with space\num even then i mean i was obsessed with\nspace dating back to like when i was\nfive\nand i was researching what the astronomy\ndepartment at cornell was\nwas up to and and i saw that a professor\nwas in charge of this\nplanned mission to mars what would later\nbe called the mars exploration rovers\nproject\nand you know if i was operating out of\nthe jail cell\nthat my society had constructed for me i\nprobably would have said\noh like it's amazing that he's working\non this and how lucky are the people\nthat are working with him\nbut there is no way that i'm going to\napply right because what do i have\nto contribute and that voice definitely\nappeared in my head he said\nthat the voice said to me you're a\nskinny kid with a funny name but you\nknow from a country halfway around the\nglobe if you send this email to him\nasking for a job that doesn't exist\nthere was no job listing\nhe's just gonna laugh right like this is\na this is a complete moonshot for you\nknow your place and don't do it\nbut then i ask myself two questions and\nthese two questions i still ask myself\nevery day the first one is what's the\nworst that can happen\nand the worst that can happen honestly\nin most cases is like everything that\nyou care for is still going to be there\nfor me like the worst case scenario was\nthat he just never write back to my\nemail\nand even if you can come up with more\nanswers to that by the way\nwrite them down it's really powerful at\nwriting down those possible worst case\nscenario has a\nstrange way of like disempowering them\num\nand then ask yourself also and this is\nthe question i asked myself was what's\nthe best that can happen\nif you send this email what's the best\nthat can happen and the best that can\nhappen did happen which is i landed at\na job on the operations team for this\nmars project\nand like two weeks later i had front row\nseats to the action\num and and you know thanks in part to i\ntaught myself how to program in high\nschool um but\nbut i think that that is that is really\nreally important because we\nwe just we get in our own way in so many\ndifferent ways\nit's not our fault it's it's so much\nsocial and educational\nconditioning and it it requires purpose\nand effort\nand being intentional to be able to\nstrip away those layers of social\nconditioning\nto regain our childlike curiosity\nand the childlike dreaming that that we\nused to do which is i think so\nimportant and such a crucial ingredient\nin in any success story\nthank you for sharing that by the way i\nwas going to dive into this i'm glad you\nshared that then your\nyour journey to that because i'm sure\nmany of your school friends would have\nyou know not thought about doing\nsomething like that or maybe some of\nthem tried or maybe some of them\nwouldn't even have envisioned it and\nso often we're thinking differently to\nthe people around us\nand it's scary it's it's scary to think\ndifferently to the people around you and\ni think a lot of people listening or\nwatching this can can identify with that\nwhere you feel a bit of fear because\nyou're like oh maybe i'm not allowed to\nthink\nlike this or maybe i shouldn't think\nlike this or maybe actually if i think\nlike this i'm going to get into more\ntrouble\nbut you spoke about two things there\nthat are really important you talked\nabout working hard and obviously we hear\na lot about working smart\nand what i like in the book is you talk\nabout the difference between strategy\nand a tactic and and you give this\nexample of teen\nsilek's five dollar challenge but i the\nreason why i wanted to bring that up is\ni think that's a really\nimportant distinction because i think in\nour journey\nsometimes to create these moonshots\nthere's a big difference between\nstrategy and tactic and everyone tries\nto use the word strategy a lot\nand we also try and use the word tactic\nand hacks a lot\nbut there is a big difference so yeah if\nyou just explain that to us the\ndifference in how we\nthink more strategically for our\nmoonshots\nsure so so tactics and strategy as you\nsaid they tend to\nthey tend to be used interchangeably but\nthey actually refer to very different\nthings so\ntactics are i will actually i should\nstart with the definition of strategies\nyour strategy is like a plan overall\nplan for achieving an objective and then\ntactics are the tools you're using the\nactions you're taking to actually get to\nthat objective\nand often tactics are traps and what we\nwhat we see when people look for life\nhacks for example or a formula they're\nasking tactical questions they're trying\nto see\nwell let me see what this other person\ndid and let me just copy and paste their\ntactics\nand expect the to to to to get the same\noutcome which\nis usually a recipe for disaster\nbut strategy is very different once you\ndefine your own strategy once you zoom\nout from the tactics to\nto thinking about what you actually want\nto achieve in your life\nthen tactics become a lot more malleable\nthen there is like so many so much more\nwiggle room\nin terms of coming up with different\nways of achieving something so you\nmentioned the\nthe five dollar challenge that tina\nselig used that at stanford uh if i can\njust recap\nyeah please please i love it yeah so\ntino tina stelig is a professor at\nstanford who runs an entrepreneurship\nclass and she walks into a classroom\nand divides up the classroom into into\nteams and she says each team gets five\ndollars on seat funding\nand your goal you've got two hours\nto make as much money as possible and\nthen you're going to give a three-minute\npresentation to the class\nso take a moment to think what you would\ndo if you were in one of these teams\nnow most teams did what you might expect\nthem to do they took the five dollars\nand they bought you know\nmaterials for a for a makeshift car wash\nor they went all school and started like\na lemonade stand\nand those teams didn't do really well\nthe teams that\nwere a lot more successful asked a very\ndifferent question\nthey realized that the tactic which is\nthe five dollar bill sitting in front of\nyou\nwas a basically a worthless and\ndistracting resource\ninstead they went back to first\nprinciples which we talked about before\nand frame the problem more broadly as\nwhat do we do to make the most amount of\nmoney\nas possible if we start with absolutely\nnothing\nso one particularly successful team\nended up making reservations at\na popular silicon valley restaurants and\nthen selling those reservation times to\nyou know wealthy executives who wanted\nto skip the weight\nand they made an impressive i think 300\nin two hours but the team that came in\nfirst realized that\nboth the five dollar tactic and the two\nhours\nwere not the most valuable in their\narsenal\ninstead they realized that that the most\nvaluable\ntool in their arsenal was a three minute\npresentation time they had in front of\nthis captivated\nstanford class they ended up selling\nthat uh\nthree-minute slot to a company that was\ninterested in recruiting stanford\nstudents\nand walked away with like seven hundred\ndollars and it's\nit's it's genius because they were\nasking the strategic question of like\nwell what do we do\nwhat do we have here it's so easy to get\ndistracted by the five dollars right\nso ask yourself you know what is the\nfive dollars in your life\nwhat is the three how do you abandon\nthat and find the more\nmore valuable two hours but even that\nhow do you abandon the two hours and\nfind the most\nvaluable three minutes that's in front\nof you that's sitting in front of you\nthat's just looking\nright at you you know breakthroughs we\ntend to think begin with a smart answer\nbut they often begin with a smart\nquestion that\nreframes a problem and sees it in the\nlights\nthat no one else is seeing it yeah i\nlove that example thank you so much for\nillustrating again so beautifully it's\nit's one of my favorite ones and\ni i i absolutely love it because i think\nyou know the way you told it as well\nwhich i thought was brilliant\nit's almost like yeah the resource that\nwe almost have sometimes we're like okay\nso i've got five hundred dollars to\ninvest\ni've got fifty dollars to invest and\nyou're so right that that can actually\nbe a distraction and a limitation as\nopposed to a growth thing\nsecond of all the two-hour time\nconstraint we often tell ourselves i've\ngot to do this in the next three months\nand it's just a false time constraint\nright it's\nthere is no real there's no real\ndeadline to it and we're putting a false\ndeadline on ourselves\nand then finally we often miss the the\nsmallest amount of time that actually\ncould be the most valuable the\nyou know when you think about three\nminutes i've got three minutes to\npresent we've got to prepare for that\nbut\nyou don't see that as an opportunity\nwhen you hear that example you're like\nthat makes so much sense\nbut but that's not the first thing that\nwould come to any of our minds i guess\nmy question begins to think how do we\nstart shifting to think in that\ndirection\nwhat what are the habits what are the\nmental changes\nthat that are rocket scientists or\npeople who are able to think like that\nwhat are the steps that they're taking\nuh to get that because we're not gonna\nget there overnight by by trying to\nimitate that example it's very\neasy to think oh yeah next time when\nsomeone asks me that cool question i'm\ngonna try and then we won't right it\ndoesn't work like that so how do you\nactually build that mental muscle that\nallows you to actually think like that\nabsolutely so there's there's a number\nof things you can do\none is to first become better at asking\nquestions\ni think that's such an important skill\nbecause we live in a society that's so\nobsessed with answers\nand finding the right answer but right\nanswers are so cheap\nthese days honestly if by the time that\nyou can google\nthe and find the answer to a question on\ngoogle the world has moved on\nbut being able to ask smart questions\nis a really important important skill\nand one of the ways that you can do that\nis\nto be able to sort of emulate the the\nteam that that won the\nthe five dollar challenge is to to ask\nstrategic questions\nand move away from tactics so move away\nfrom the what\nyou're doing to why you're trying to do\nwhat you do\nso talk think about strategy because\nonce you zoom out\nto to see the strategy then you might be\nable to spot tactics that that other\npeople are\nare missing the second thing that i\nfound really valuable\nis to bring in people into the\nconversation\nuh who know nothing about what i'm\nworking on\nso outsiders basically and outsiders\nhave a way\nof of asking really good questions\nto spot what you're missing because they\nare not wedded to conventional wisdom\nthey don't know the status quo so\nthey're going to ask you what people\ncall\nquote unquote dumb questions that are\nactually not dumb at all\nbecause they go to some like fundamental\naspect of the problem\nthat you're failing to see and this is\nwhy by the way so many of the\nthe success stories that we just talked\nabout are outsiders to their industries\num so elon musk he came to rocket\nscience from from silicon valley and he\nlearned about rocket science by reading\ntextbooks on a beach somewhere in rio de\njaneiro after he sold paypal to ebay\njeff bezos was in the finance world\nbefore he went into uh to start amazon\nreid hastings was a software developer\nbefore he started netflix and all of\nthese people were able to see\nthe holes in the thinking of the\nestablished players\nbecause they were outsiders and so this\ndoesn't mean that\nyou know you um you hire an expensive\nconsultant\nor bring in an expensive speaker it\ncould be as simple as talking to your\nsignificant other or your friend\nwho knows nothing about what you're\nworking on but presenting to them what\nyou're thinking about\nand letting them ask those really simple\nquestions\nthat are going to jolt you out of your\nyour perspective\nthe story i tell in the book is uh by jk\nrowling and the first harry potter book\num when she submitted the the harry\npotter i think it was the sorcerer's\nstone which is the first book to\npublishers\nthey were unanimous in their opinion\nthey all thought that the book was not\nworth printing\none publisher in the uk called\nbloomsbury publishing\nsaw promise in the book when others\nmissed it\nand the head of bloomsbury publishing\nnigel newton um\nhe saw promise in the book because he\nhad a secret weapon\nby the name of alice his eight-year-old\nbookworm daughter\nand so what nigel did was to bring the\nfirst chapter of harry potter home\nwith him and he gave the first chapter\nto alice alice\nread the book and she came back down\nstairs and went to her dad and said dad\nthis is so much better than anything\nelse i've read\nand the input of alice convinced her dad\nto write a meager\n2 500 pound check to jk rowling to\nacquire the rice to to publish the first\nharry potter book which\nby the way is the best bet made in\npublishing history right because jk\nrowling is now a billion dollar\nauthor all because nigel newton\nwas willing to get the opinion of\nsomeone who was a complete\noutsider to the publishing industry\nalice but\nwas a member of the target audience\naudience for the book\nso that's something else you can do is\nto to bring in outsiders into the\nconversation\nand the third thing i would say is to be\nvery intentional about\nquestioning the assumptions in your life\nso ask yourself you know\nwhy do i have this process why do i have\nthis routine\nwhy do i have this habit why am i doing\nwhat i'm doing on a daily basis because\nwe normally don't ask those questions\nwhen when we get into the habit of doing\nsomething we're operating on on\nautopilot right\nit's like a you know a choose your\nadventure choose your own adventure book\nthat always has the same ending\nso it's it's really important to disrupt\nyourself from time to time and ask\nwhy is this process in place why am i\ntaking the same route to work every day\nwhy am i using this browser to do what i\ndo i mean these are very simple\nquestions but\nif you extend them to the more important\ndecisions in your life\nit's really amazing what can happen as a\nresult before we started recording we\nwere talking about how\nmy book tour got cancelled because my\nbook was published on april 14th when\nwhen the pandemic was wreaking havoc on\nthe world\nand you know that um i spent\ntwo days just being miserable because i\nwas\nbasically trying to control what can't\nbe controlled right i can't change\npendant the pandemic i can't change its\ndisruption on\non my book marketing plans but then\nthat disruption i started asking myself\nthe more productive questions of\nokay i can't change the the hand that\nthe universe\ndealt me but what can i do with the hand\nthat i was dealt\nwhat assumptions am i operating under\nand my assumption by the way which was\nnot first principles thinking\nwas that authors do book tours and this\nis that's the only reason i was doing it\nby the way right like other authors i\nadmire they publish a book they go on a\nbook tour so\ni'm gonna publish a book i'm also gonna\ngo on a book tour\nbut not stopping and asking myself the\nmore strategic question of\nwell what is the purpose of a book tour\nbecause a book tour is a tactic\nright in service of a broader strategy\nof\nof spreading the word about the ideas in\nthe book that is my overall goal\nis to help empower people to to think\nlike a rocket scientist to reimagine the\nstatus quo\nand if i zoom out and ask myself that\nstrategic question\nthe tactics become malleable and by the\nway i started to realize that the tactic\nof a book tour\nis like the five dollar bill it's it's\nit's not worth the certainly not\nbut it's not the best use of my time i\nmean i could get on a plane and fly to\nnew york and\nwalk into a barnes and noble and sign\nbooks for 50 people and come home and\nthat's going to take me an entire day or\ntwo\nor i could sit in the comfort of my\noffice as i'm doing now\nand and do virtual events and virtual\nbook launches and podcast conversations\nand reach a far bigger audience\nthan i would have reached with with a\nbook tour and often we\nwe don't question assumptions until the\nuniverse\nforces out of the status quo right\nforces us out of the status quo that's\nwhen we start questioning everything\nbut the people who get ahead are the\nones who do that questioning\nbefore they're forced out of the status\nquo before a crisis strikes they're\nthey're\nthey're doing the questioning and asking\nthese\nstrategic questions to themselves before\ncrisis comes knocking on the door\nso you have to in many cases dig the\nwell before you're thirsty\nand and and think through your outdated\nassumptions before the universe does it\nfor you\ni couldn't agree with you more thank you\nfor that very thoughtful uh\nset of steps and thoughts that we can go\nto and it all comes back down to asking\nthe right questions and\nyeah and that's you know that's what we\nforget you're right like when you when\nyou ask yourself the wrong question you\nget lost in a whole trajectory like the\nwrong question of like okay well what\nwhat uh\nwhat are other authors doing that i have\nto do right like that question is what\nleads you down this whole\nuh trajectory of planning and building\nand traveling and then you're coming\nback from all of that wait a minute\nthat didn't make any sense and so you\nknow not that it didn't make any sense\nit\nit it wasn't right and appropriate for\nthe current time that we're in\nand and i couldn't agree with you more\nso i'm yeah i'm hoping that everyone's\nlistening right now there's a lot of\nsubtext in what azan's telling us around\njust\nyou know really looking at the decisions\nyou're making in your life right now\nreally reflecting about\nthe steps you're taking in in your life\nright now and just questioning why\nyou're doing them what you're doing them\nfor\nwhy they make sense and if you don't\nhave a good enough answer for yourself\nand that's really the most important\nanswer is can you answer it for yourself\nbecause someone else may have a perfect\nreason for why\nthey think you should do something but\nif you don't have a good enough reason\nfor why you think you should do it\nthen it's then it's probably not as\nstrong as you believe it is\nso uh ozone i've got a few more\nquestions for you before we round up i\nwant to ask you this question from the\nbook\nwhy do you suggest we use lisa burdell's\nkill the company exercise\nuh because i love it too it's another\ngreat example from the book\nyeah it's one of my favorite exercises\nand the story i i tell in the book is\nfrom\nfrom merck and how mercy or kenneth\nfrazier applied it but basically he\nasked his executives\nto play the role of one of burke's top\ncompetitors for a day\nand so they switched perspectives and\nthey figured out ways to kill the\ncompany to to put merck out of business\nwhich is when ceos talk about change and\ninnovation\nthey're asking usually the cliche\nquestions like\nhow do we think outside the box or\nwhat's the next big thing\nbut those cliche questions tend to\ngenerate cliche answers\nbut if you play this game of kill the\ncompany\nand you ask your executives to come up\nwith\nwith ways to put the company out of\nbusiness\nthen they are by definition moving out\nof the current perspective moving\noutside of the box and looking at the\nbox from the perspective of a competitor\nseeking to destroy it now that's the\nfirst part of the exercise\nonce you identify those threats then you\nswitch to the opposite perspective so\nyou go but they went back to being merc\nexecutives and figured out ways to to\ndefend\nagainst those threats and so and you can\nhave you don't have to be a big\ncorporation to apply that in your own\nlife you can ask yourself\nyou know you can play to kill the\ncompany uh game with your job right you\ncan say well why might my boss\npass me up for a promotion uh why may i\nnot\nget this job that i'm interviewing for\nor why are people\nbuying our competitors products it's not\nbecause\nyou're right and they're wrong it's not\nbecause they're stupid it's because\nthey're seeing something that you're not\nseeing\nit's because they believe something that\nthat you don't believe it's because\nthey're telling themselves\na different story and you're not going\nto be able to see that story if you're\nlooking at the world\nfrom your own limited perspective and\nkill the company is a great way of\nof forcing yourself out of that\nperspective\nand and adopting the perspective of\nsomebody else yeah i think it's a great\nactivity to do with yourself to do with\nyour teams\nto do with anyone because it actually\nallows you to think so big and broad and\ncrazy\nwhich being told to think outside of the\nbox definitely doesn't do\nyeah or to have a creative brainstorm\ndefinitely doesn't do\nso no i love that and thank you so much\nfor sharing that okay azan so what i\nwant to ask you now\nis these uh final two segments of the\npodcast which are called fill in the\nblanks and the final five so fill in the\nblanks is i read a sentence and you have\nto fill in the final word\nand the final five i'll introduce\nstraight after that so are you ready\nyep ready so challenging conventional\nwisdom\nstarts with getting out of your jail\ncell\nabsorbing complex issues\nbegins with simplifying them nice\nreframing\na problem welcomes better answers\nwhat impresses me most about humans is\ntheir ability to\nadapt to the to the uncertain\nnice good okay these are your final five\nso the final five these are questions\nthat are answered in\none word to one sentence maximum you\ncan't you're very good you follow the\nrules which is always wonderful\nnot everyone always does so i really\nappreciate so here we go\nuh this is some of these are a bit more\npersonal so if you feel the need to\ntalk a bit more you can the first two\nespecially\nhow often do you walk einstein and do\nyou find yourself to be more creative\nduring those times with him yeah we walk\nhim my wife kathy and i walk him\nuh once or twice a day at least and\nand absolutely uh some of the best ideas\ni've had in\nin recent memory have come during those\nwalks\nbecause one i'm stepping away from what\ni'm doing and actually letting my\nsubconscious\nmake connections but also i've got an\namazing\npartner with me a sounding board who's\nasking me\nthe the right questions that because you\nknow she doesn't know what i'm working\non\nuh so she has that outsider perspective\nthat would that we talked about\nand she'll often help me see things that\ni'm missing\ni love that that's beautiful the second\nquestion is actually about her because\nyou start off the book dedicated to\nkathy\nand you say my cosmic constant uh what\nwas that what was the uh\nthinking behind the use of that\nterminology what does that mean to you\nyou know it's it was a connection to the\nuniverse of course and thinking like a\nrocket scientist\nand and i've had so many changes in my\nlife\ncoming from turkey to the united states\nas an immigrant and then from\nastrophysics to law\npracticing lawyer to law professor and\nthen from law professor to popular\nauthor\nand and speaker so the ground underneath\nmy feet has never been\nstable really and my whole life is just\nthe change is the only or it seems like\nchange is the only constant but there's\nanother\nconstant in my life which is which is\nkathy i love that man that's awesome\nokay weirdly enough i also dedicate my\nbook to my wife\ni love that yeah a few more similar mine\nsays um\nto my wife who's more monk than i'll\never be\nah i love that so much last three\nquestions of the interview\num what's something that you were once\ncertain of\nthat you recently changed your mind on i\nwas certain once that\nscience and spirituality could not be\nreconciled\nand i've changed my opinion about that\nin the past probably a year or two\nactually\ni was always i had this very\nmaterialistic view of the world not in\nthe monetary sense but in the sense that\nlike\nanything that's not subject to proof or\ndisproved by the scientific method\nwas not worth thinking about and and i\ndon't think that anymore\ni think science and spirituality you\nknow thinking like a monk can think like\na rocket scientist can co-exist\nin in ways that are beneficial\nto to both fields i love that i can\nagree with you more\nokay last two questions uh if you could\ncreate a law\nthat everyone in the world would have to\nfollow what would it be\nyou know be kinder to one another i know\nit it sounds\num cliche but it's it's so important to\njust be a little bit more kinder\nto one another and and to see each other\nin a way that we don't see each other\nyou know\nwe not looking at people like a\ncommercial transaction a business card\nor the the person standing in between\nyou and your starbucks macchiato\nbut actually seeing them as a human\nbeing\nwho's experienced joy\nand sorrow who's experienced triumph and\ngrief\nin all of their imperfect beautiful\nglory\nwe don't do that you know we just walk\npast people we just see\nthrough each other as opposed to really\nsee each other\nand and i think that would be the the\nlaw i would create is\nis requires to actually to actually see\neach other\nyeah i love that thank you and the fifth\nand final question\nis what was your biggest lesson that you\nlearned from the last 12 months\nsuccess doesn't make you happy um\nif you're not happy before success and\nit's not that i wasn't happy\num it just i think i've had this and\nthis isn't just 12 months by the way\nit's probably my whole life i've tied my\nself\ni tied my self worth around my\naccomplishments and so\ni would sort of get a a big dopamine hit\nwhenever i i succeeded at something and\ni always thought that\nhappiness was over the next mountain and\nas long as i conquered this next thing\nyou know achieve this the next milestone\nthat's going to bring me bring me\nhappiness but if you're not happy before\nsuccess you're not going to be happy\nafter success\nand and to me it's happiness comes from\nnot those big moments that you\nanticipate\ngoing back to what we talked about\nbefore but actually\nreorienting your focus toward the\nprocess toward the little joys of life\nlike the joy of\nour morning walk with einstein the joy\nof\nyou know my my morning cup of coffee the\njoy of an unturned\nuninterrupted hour of of writing that's\nwhere the\nthat's where happiness comes from\nhappiness to me that doesn't come from\nthe the big\naccomplishments regardless of what it\nmight look like from the outside\nwhenever we first admit that it's hard\nto kind of\nstomach it sometimes you know like i i\ni've also\nfor a long time realized that in at\nleast in my opinion happiness and\nsuccess are two different things\nand and success is based on what i\nachieve and\nhappiness is based on how i feel about\nmyself and and how i feel about what i'm\ndoing and contributing\nand and i don't think happiness if\nyou're happy it makes you more\nsuccessful and i don't think if you're\nsuccessful it makes you happy i think\nthey are just what they are and and and\nit's okay like i\ni think i i have dreams to be happy and\ni also have dreams to be successful and\ni have plans to be happy and have plans\nto be successful and i\nand i see them as separate they they\ngive me different\na different sense of meaning and\nfulfillment in different ways\nand when you try and interconnect them\nwhich is what i think you're saying\nthere's so many of us for so long\nbelieve that if we're successful we'd be\nhappy or the opposite too which is oh if\nyou're happy then you'll be successful\nand that's not\nthat's not true either you know it just\nit it doesn't really matter and\nyou can define what each of them are for\nyou so no thank you azan thank you for\nsharing that and\nreally appreciate everyone this is ozan\nviral and the book\nthink like a rocket scientist simple\nstrategies you can use to make giant\nleaps in work and life you can go and\ngrab\na copy now i obviously highly recommend\nthis book\nuh i think it's fascinating the way azan\ntells stories he's a phenomenal writer\nof course you can check out his blog as\nwell\nbut the book definitely goes to that\npoint of just crystallizing a lot of\nthese\nreally really important and fascinating\ntips and that's what i love about the\nbook it's like\nit's stuff that will make sense but it\nwill be so much more practical and\ndeeper for you\nas you dive in through the stories and\nthe studies that ozan makes really\nreally clear for us like he's done today\nazan thank you so much for joining in\nthe on purpose family\nuh really really grateful to meet you\nand i hope we actually get to meet in\nperson one day too\nyeah i love that as well you just live\nright down the
