too\nand you're always hoping that when you\nmeet someone\nthey don't let you down yes right and\ni'm an optimistic person so when i meet\nsomeone that i've been aspiring to me\nyeah i'm always hoping that they're\ngoing to blow me away even more that's\nmy hope and when i met you it felt that\nway so i just want to say thank you\nthank you you too yeah you too it was so\nso funny because we were running so many\nsimilar circles and our friends were\nlike\nyou guys don't know each other you\nshould meet up and and thank you shout\nout to lewis\nfor introducing us and making sure that\nconnection happened and\nsame thing i was hoping i'm like he's a\nmonk i hope he's like\ncalm i hope he's centered i hope he's\ngot good vibrancy and his\nand joy in his heart and his eyes and\nyou did even though\nyou and i both were kind of road warrior\na little bit that moment we were\nwe were out on the road we were and that\nwas late at night\nand we just were chatting and just you\nknow when you meet people\nand just your vibrant and enthusiastic\npart of you that comes\nout right because you and i already do\nthat for life in a job\nbut then when you meet somebody who it\ndraws you out more i was energized that\nnight so really i thought you were just\nalways like that i think you are always\nlike that you have great ideas\nyeah i'm i'm happy yeah you know i'm\nliving my second chance at life\nyeah so for me you know after a big car\naccident when i was younger every day is\nlike bonus day\nso i'm already reverence for life i'm\nhappy-go-lucky\nbut there are people who have an aura\nand a vibrancy and everyone's listening\nthey know that\nthere's those times there's just some\npeople who you're around it kind of\nmakes you pop and come alive and did you\nsmile a little more and you were that\nand i was like oh that's what i wanted\nfrom meeting jay shetty i wanted to be\nlike that anywhere so\nthank you man let's actually start there\ni wasn't going to start there but now\nthat you've mentioned it i want to start\nthere i want my audience to hear that\nstory from you\nyeah because i think that everyone's\neither\nhad one of those moments or they're\ngoing to have one of those moments\nand i want everyone who's listening and\nwatching right now to either be prepared\nif they're about to have one or maybe\nnot even wait for that to happen\nyeah and for those who have had it to\nreally use it to the advantage so let's\nstart with that\naccident that that changed your mindset\nthat changed the urgency of life for you\nyeah um i'll give the takeaway because\nit's a little bit of a long story i know\nit is\num you know the takeaway is at at the\nend of our lives\nif we have a moment of cognition we're\ngoing to lay there in bed\nand we're going to ask questions about\nour life\nto evaluate whether or not we were happy\nwith it\nand what i've always suggested to people\nis\nmaybe don't pretend you're living your\npurpose unless you know\nthe questions you're going to ask at the\nend of your life how do you evaluate it\nbecause otherwise you're kind of living\nrandomly but when you know oh i'm gonna\nevaluate my life\nthis way at the very end now every day\nyou can wake up with intention\nnow every day you get to wake up with\npurpose which is why i love the name of\nyour show because that's\nmy thing too it's like this this deep\nconnection to some type of purpose so\nthat at the end of our life we're happy\nthere's no regrets\nthere there's no sadness there's no oh\nmy gosh why was i this way or why did i\nwait to do that\nand i my unique story is that\ni got that gift at 19 years old\num the story is my my girlfriend and i\nfrom high school were high school\nsweethearts\nand like the super annoying kind like we\nwere they\nwe became like high school sweethearts\nand we were the make out of locker and\nyou know\nstop it you never have that couple who\nstops hanging out with their friends\nbecause they get so much\nthat was us we just so fell in love with\neach other we stopped hanging out with\nfriends stopped doing anything else\nfell in love um she wanted to go to\ncollege\ni was just gonna do like landscaping i\nmean i was gonna do like\nart projects on this i had no i didn't\nhave a real ambition to go to college\nyet\nwe went to college together shared a\nu-haul on the way over\nlive in the same dorm sign up for the\nsame classes had the same friends like\nthe whole nine yards like literally\nour life was completely intertwined and\nthen at the end of that or\nin that first semester of school she\ndiscovered uh\nbeer and other men\nuh and cheated on me wow and\ni don't remember this way but if when\nyour whole identity is wrapped up in a\nrelationship\nand then the relationship falls apart\nyou fall apart 100 that's what happened\ni felt i fell apart\ni fell mentally emotionally spiritually\ncompletely apart\num couldn't get out of bed\nstop going to classes friends deeply\nconcerned about me coming over trying to\nmove let's go out let's go out and i was\nlike i can't\ni just would lay there and like cry\nbasically\num and i like two things really changed\nmy life which i didn't realize till\nlater\none was i was always a reader like i'm\nreally happy about all the accolades\ni've gotten everything else but\nthe thing that has driven my life is i\nlove books\nwhen i meet with people i want to talk\nabout books i love books i love books\nand so i'm still reading so here i am\ndepressed in bed\num and i remember this is like several\ndays after\ni'd planned suicide full on not like\nthinking about it wrote the letter\nmade a couple calls and had planned to\nend my life\nlaying in bed super sad open the school\nnewspaper\nand there was an ad in the school\nnewspaper so i'm reading\nsecond thing to change my life is\nmarketing here's this ad\nfull page ad white sandy beach turquoise\nwater\nblue sky green palm tree and across the\ntop like the best headline\never for a young man in pain the\nheadline across the top said\nescape and i was like\nyeah you know summertime\njob students needed dominican republic\nwow now i'm in montana at the time at\nthe university of montana i don't know\ni've been to montana oh yeah yeah\ni don't even know where dominican\nrepublic is but i know she's not there\nso i'm like so i'm like i'm going so\ntake the job\nuh we basically become glorified tour\nguides for an entrepreneur who works\ndown there who we knew\nand my friend kevin and i we hop in the\ncar one night\nand we go to return where we're staying\nand we're going down the shore to 85\nmiles an hour and kevin is driving and\nwe came upon the corner that\nyou know here in the us especially la\nwould you know u-turn-shaped\nyellow sign slow down 15 miles an hour\nbut developing country new road no sign\nso we go around the corner and kevin\nimmediately like grabs and go brain hold\non\nand he cranks it and i just\ni mean i didn't know then was it you\nknow\nwhat happened was emotional spiritual\nmental you know make-believe who knows\nin my\nmind of what happened the next couple of\nminutes but\nwhen you're sliding in this death's\ndoorway\nyou have questions about life it comes\nthrough as a feeling\nlike because at first like that brace\nthat terror\nin a car accident there's a piece of\nthat if you ever think you're like you\nknow you don't want to die\nand if you've ever been in a car\naccident that weird slow motion thing\nhappens so that's why i said i don't\nknow where it was because like this\nsuper slow motion\nand i felt this brace and i really felt\nand sensed this like\ndid i live did i live my life\nuh you know later i can think about like\nyou know because of course we want to\nknow do we live vibrant and free\nand and a lot you know our life but at\nthat point you know i lived her life\ni'd live my parents and professors lives\nand i really hadn't been living and been\nthinking about taking\nmy life um\nwe went to the the car slid sideways off\nthe road\nand we hit this little retainer wall and\nit popped us up into the air\nand i hit the side of my head um and i\nstarted seeing all these images\nof these times in my life when i was\nsurrounded by people that i loved\nand it was like these scenes it's just\nbeautiful\njust beautiful it wasn't omniscient it\nwasn't like a near-death experience per\nse\nit was just these beautiful scenes when\ni could see family members and everybody\nelse and\nbecause at the end of your life you\nthink about who you're going to miss and\nwho's going to miss you which triggers\nthis other question of did i love\nand you know you talk about it too and\nlike we want to know that we really love\nfully and completely and\nfree not not from terror or fear or need\ni hadn't loved my heart had been shut\ndown and i always say to people it's\nlike\nyou have to be careful we've been hurt\nbecause we build up these walls to\nprotect ourselves we put on the mask or\nwe get\nyou know serious and stiff but when you\nbuild up that wall to give out the bad\nguys\nyou also block out the good guys and in\nour own self-protection we block out the\nvery things we really desperately desire\nwhich is connection\num car hit the ground rolled several\ntimes i got knocked out completely when\ni came to kevin\nis next to me in driver's seat screaming\nat the top of his\njust terrified his eyes are wild like an\nanimal and a huge chunk of his head is\nopen\nand there's just blood everywhere this\nfear is like what's going on but i'm\nlike in shock he crawls outside the\ndriver's side window\ni go to get outside mine but i can't the\ncar smashed on me\nand all i have is this hole that used to\nbe in the windshield i push myself\nthrough\nand i stand up on the hood of the car\nhe's screaming screaming screaming but\ni'm in this thud hollow i don't know how\nto describe the shock\nand i look down and i saw on my body i'm\ncovered in blood\nand this just terror hits me remember\n19 and i feel life draining literally\nphysically out of me\nand um i just remember life\nfeeling like it's draining away and i\njust remember looking at at my feet\nwhich was covered in blood and i just\nthought\ndid i even matter you know did i even\nmake a difference was there a reason i\nwas here\nand oh man it was the worst because i\ndidn't feel like i did\nand then uh i looked down and the blood\nwas going off the hood of the car and\nthere was a glint there was a sparkle in\nthe blood\nand i didn't know what it was it was\nreflection so made me look up and\nthere's this bright big beautiful moon\nthat night\nthat i didn't even see earlier\nand it was like this arresting\nconnection\ni just felt this connection and i felt\nlike\nyou know i was almost an immediate\nsense of grace i was like i'm gonna be\nokay\ni almost felt like i was told i was\ngonna be okay and so i call that\nlike my life's golden ticket moment\nbecause i felt like the big guy upstairs\nbecause i believe in god reach down and\nhand me like life's golden ticket here\nyou go kid\nyou're still alive you can still love\nyou can still matter\nbut now you know the clock is ticking\nyou're lucky young man you're still\nalive and my whole life i was just like\nin that moment\ni remember literally looking up this\nmoon and i didn't know it was so\ni didn't know what the feelings were at\nthe time because i've had a lot of time\nto think about this obviously\n23 years ago and i just remember\nthinking\ni will earn this\nand i felt that next breath is like i'm\ngonna be okay\nkevin and i i don't mean to ruin the\nstory for everybody but i survived\nit's like i'm okay i'm alive kevin\nsurvived lots of cuts bruising broken\nbones terrified kids\nbut for me what i took away with it was\nboth the reverence for life the\nappreciation for life\nthe timing of life that the clock is\nticking on all of us\nbut also this desire to i want to earn\nit\nlike i felt so blessed i felt like i got\naway with it you know i mean like\nhow did i skirt death i want to earn\nthis\nso in the hospital later i was thinking\nabout those feelings and i was like oh\nwow\ni kind of asked myself did i live did i\nlove\nand did i matter and it really hit me i\nthought\nthat that that's a gift right there\nthose are the questions i'm gonna ask if\ni'm ever to die\ndid i really live my life did i love\nothers and did i make a difference\ndid i matter and so i decided\nremember i'm 19. i\ni decided at 19 i said every night i'm\ngonna go to bed i'm gonna ask those\nthree questions\nabout my day so i've asked those for 23\ntonight\ni'll go home and i'll ask that same\nquestion 23 years every night\npeople how do you do so much i go when\nyou live your life with intention and\npurpose\nyou can get a lot done because the\nnights that i can't say yes to those\nquestions\nit's not like i'm i hate myself or i'm\nsad right but\nthe nights i can say yes i sleep\nwell and so i just i've had this simple\nmission like i love your mission make\nwisdom go viral\nmine has been maybe more depressive to\ntell people\nto tell people you're going to die so\nhow about this figure out the questions\nyou're going to ask to evaluate your\nlife mine were did i lived i love\ndo i matter yours might be was i a great\nbrother\nwas a great mom did i build a movement\ndid i\neveryone's gonna evaluate it differently\ni don't have the answer for anybody i\ndon't know their purpose but i say\njust think if you're 90 on the rocking\nchair or you're 105 on the rock interior\nyou're\n200 in the hospice you know however\nolder you are if you have a moment of\ncognition you're evaluating life\nhow do you know if you lived a good one\nnow wake up every day\nwith the intention to do that live good\nso you're happy with the answers at the\nend it's awesome that's so beautiful\nthank you for sharing that\nyeah in such a profound and moving way\nas well and\nwhat i love about that and how you've\ntranslated that into what you do now\nis that i think a lot of us are gifted\nlike you said the golden ticket a gifted\nwith golden ticket moment\nyes some are more extreme or less\nextreme than what you described yeah and\nit doesn't really matter where on the\nspectrum it is we we all have those\nmoments\nand i think what's fascinating is that\nso many of us have that\nglimpse but then we struggle to\ntranslate that glimpse\ninto real transformation yes or we\nstruggle to translate this emotive\ninspiring deep personal moment\ninto something very practical active and\ntangible yeah and i think anyone who's\nwatched a motivational video or been\nthrough a life-changing accident\nwill say they've felt that where they've\nhad a moment where like oh i felt yeah\nin my body that i was meant to do this\nbut then\nthe next day i just didn't feel like\ngetting up tell me how you started to\nform the habits that were needed\nyeah for you to live this every day and\nyou've already taught us one beautiful\none just like the one you just said but\nhow did you how were you able to really\ntake that through\nand start developing a world and a life\nto live up to those questions yeah\ni mean stage one was i was honest\nthat i was a hot mess like i came back\nfrom the accident and i'm like\ni'm a mess i've been depressed i was\ngonna kill myself\ni'm sad my grades suck my friends are\nkind of like\nlosers uh you know not in a judgmental\nway to\nthem but in how i wanted to feel they\nmade me feel bad about myself\nand that's why i think a loser isn't\nwhat they've accomplished it's how they\nmake other people feel\ntwo different things they made me feel\nbad and i thought i\ni don't have it together and that began\nmy great and long-term committed search\nto studying psychology because i'm like\nwhy do i think so dumb\nwhy do i feel so bad about myself how do\nyou overcome\nyou know depression how do i deal with\nthis sadness\nwhy do i still have so much hatred in my\nheart about something that happened so\nlong ago\nlike just all this like people say\nforgiveness how do you do that\nso i started reading everything in\npsychology first\nthen i came into personal development\nand then i got into spirituality\nthen i got into leadership development\nthen i got into business it was\nevery single thing of like how do i\nchange myself\nso much so you and i have this shared\nhistory we've both worked at a\nconsulting company absolutely i was a\nchange management consultant\nbecause i spent literally from that\nmoment for the next six\nyears studying change\nin some way or another studying\npsychology studying political science\nstudying organizational communications\nand management to say how do\npeople change and so i became infatuated\nso in personal development i studied\nlike\ndale carnegie and napoleon hill and earl\nnightingale and zig ziglar and jim rohn\nand marianne williamson\ndebbie ford and louise hay and wayne\ndyer and uh you know\ntony robbins and and just brian tracy\nand anyone getting my hands on there\nin psychology i got carl rogers and\nabraham maslow and alfred ayler\nyou know in political science i was you\nknow\nstudying this person in philosophy i was\ngoing down\nthe rabbit hole and i was just eating\nand absorbing it\nand asking the questions every day and\ntrying to live it and the most important\nthing with that my\nthat at my time i said you know what i\nwant to learn to be\nconfident i want to learn how to\ncommunicate well\nand i want to learn to have great\nrelationships\nso i studied those things really\nintensely and i just tried them\nand i tried them and i just i literally\ni was so good about making little goal\nsheets\nand trying and that was the year i also\nbegan my monthly goals\nso on the first of every month to this\nday i write\na personal goal and a professional goal\num\nthat is the outside of all the things\nthat project i'm trying to achieve\nthe personal goal is something like\nbe more patient this month and every day\ni look out on the way out i put on the\ndoor\ni'd walk out and be patient no matter\nwhat my other goals or\nobjectives were that was like the\ndefining personal theme so i created\nmonthly challenge themes for 23 years\nyou know patients have come up a lot of\ntimes\nit's like joy has come up a lot of times\nyes you know\nuh uh staying centered has come up a lot\nof times it's not like i've ever\nachieved i've\nno one achieves personal development i\nagree or purpose\nit is like an intention and a dedication\nand so that's where it started and by\nstudying all that\nit gave me the edge i really believe\nwhen you are a student of life\nespecially in psychology and philosophy\nyou get the edge because when people are\nhaving problems you can see perspective\naround it\nand once you have perspective you got\nsuper powers because most people are\ntrapped in their problems and if you\nhave perspective how\npeople have solved or managed these\nthings in the past\nyou have superpowers to people they\ncan't believe like how did you know to\nsay that or that i'm like oh i read that\nin a personal development book 10 years\nago\nand that made the big difference for me\nwow it made a big difference so\nit's just reading i mean i read a book a\nweek\nfor 23 years i love that never missed um\nthat's not true four times in my life i\nmissed most two of them were in the\nhospital so that's it\noh wow i'm a reader and then i try to\napply it\nyeah try to apply and then the ultimate\nchallenge\nis i made my career about it that forced\nme to develop skill\nwhen i was a consultant first then\nbecame a coach\nthen decided to become a researcher and\nwriter in this field\ni had to prove my chops there was no\njust talk about it wasn't posting on you\nknow instagram because i didn't have\nthat it was\ncan i sit in a room with an executive\nand change yes\ncan i get the change can can i sit with\na high-profile athlete who's in trouble\nwith their behavior can i get the change\ncan i sit down with a person who wants\nto start a business and give them that\nconfidence they need like whatever it\nwas\nit was real-time challenges for so long\nthat fortunately that experience helped\nme yeah\nabsolutely and i love what you're\ntalking about because i think we have\nsuch a\nanswer obsession today like we're all\nlooking for the answers we're all trying\nto find the answer yeah\nand actually what you're saying is the\nemphasis should be on the questions\nfinding the right questions to us that's\nit and then finding\nwhere to find the answers to those\nquestions which led you into\npsychology and led you into political\nscience and led you into philosophy and\nled you to all these players yes\nbecause you were answering asking the\nright questions yeah and and i think\nthere's such an answer obsession today\nwith\nwe want the answer we want to know how\nthis works and why it works\nbut we've just got to go deeper into\nasking that question more sincerely more\ngenuinely and so much more comes from\nthat because\nyou just feel inspired by that question\ni feel and what you mean by student of\nlife like when you're a student of life\nit means you're questioning that's it\nright that's what it means like what\nelse does it mean talk about questioning\nlike i\ni had been doing seminars and coaching\nfor\nsix seven years at a really high level\nbut i was wondering like is my stuff\nright is it true am i one of these guys\nwho just talked like let me\nsuper test it so we did research i\nteamed up with a researcher\nfrom university of pennsylvania's\npositive psychology department and\nuh researchers at uc santa barbara we\nconducted the world's largest study of\nhigh performers of all time\nlike no other study has been this big\nthis comprehensive this deep down 190\ncountries\n190 countries i mean millions of data\npoints\nand and the reason because no one would\nspend the money on it i was like oh\ni'll kick this let's figure this out\nbecause i want to know that what i'm\ndoing\nis precise and academically validated\nbut i only bring that up because\nthe first habit that we discovered of\nhigh performers worldwide and high\nperformers tend to be the top 15 percent\nof\nsuccessful people in whatever field that\nis um\nand usually you know and that's the\nbroad 190 countries in the us it's the\ntop three percent\nuh hands down the habit that\nreally changed their trajectory was this\nhabit called\nseek clarity notice\nit doesn't say get clarity yeah high\nperformers seek clarity i'll give an\nexample\nlike with with oprah i've had blessings\nworking with oprah\nif you have a meeting with oprah when\nshe walks that meeting her first thing\nshe asks is\nwhat's our intention for this meeting\nnow lots of executives walk in meetings\nthey just start the meetings she's\nseeking clarity\nof what is this about and you take a\nunderperformer in the work world or at\nyour job\nthey just bumble in and they're like\nokay let's just do it high performers go\nwhat is this about where does it fit in\nwhat's the priority they're asking\nthemselves\nquestions constantly and not questions\nof self-doubt questions of clarity\nlike like who could i be what's my best\nself look in this situation\nyou know that's a question i performers\nask they they want to know how can i be\nof most service in this situation\na lot of people just go through the\nmotions high performers see clearly they\nask the questions\nand because they get clarity and seek\nclarity throughout the process\nthey get ahead faster because a lot of\npeople just and they're good\nbut a lot of people are just brunt force\nworkers they'll just go and do it and\nthey'll just apply\nforce and will and hope and fire and\nhours at something\nbut often they're running in the wrong\ndirection yeah absolutely high\nperformers\nyou know it's like in directions some\npeople will drive for 50 minutes\nother people will pull aside in five and\ngo hey where do i go\nthat's the high performer and they're\ngonna get there faster and succeed in\nlife that's seeking clarity and that\nsometimes feels scarier to do\nbecause you have to open up yourself to\nvulnerability\nnot knowing you feel like you're not\nintelligent now or the other person may\nperceive you as\ndifferent like how do you break that\nthat that barrier of like\nbeing okay with saying you know i don't\nknow and i want to find out how do you\nbreak that because i think for so many\npeople even raising their hand at an\nevent\nor going up and really asking you a\nquestion i used to say to people all the\ntime i was like\nwhen you see someone you admire stop\nasking for a picture ask for a question\nyou know it's like oh i love that you\nknow what i mean like\nyou get asked for pictures all the time\nand i'm like why if if you had a moment\nlike let's just imagine let's take oprah\nyou have a moment with oprah you can ask\na picture or you can ask her a question\nyeah you know it's like it's that there\nand if i meet you it's like\ngonna ask for a picture i'm gonna ask\nbrendan for a question yeah you studied\n190 countries in the top performers yeah\ni'm hoping i would ask you a question\nyeah and and i think so how do you get\nthere how do you get to a point where\nyou\nyou wire your brain in such a way that\nyou're you break the fear of\ni'm scared of looking silly i'm scared\nof looking stupid i'm scared of looking\nlike i don't know and actually\nrecognizing that's a strength\nyeah i would say maybe not the most\npopular answer i go to the fear\nhow are you gonna look silly or stupid\nyou're not going to ask questions and\nyou're going to end up in the wrong\nplace\nand people are like why don't you just\nask like follow the fear if the fear\nsays\ni'm scared i'm looking stupid by asking\nquestions like well let's flip that\nbecause if you don't ask questions\nyou're definitely going to look stupid\nyou're definitely going to end up in the\nwrong place yeah you're definitely i\nmean\nyou're you're manifesting the very thing\nyou fear by not doing the thing\nthat you're scared and being bare you\nknow you don't want to be vulnerable\nabout yeah so i think one\nfirst i'm always a guy i'm like pay\nattention to research if the research\nclearly says\nlike i'm a little bit scientific in my\nmind that way i'm like if the research\nsays clearly across 190 countries and\nsome of the most successful people on\nthe planet they ask more questions\nand they're intentional and thoughtful\nabout that then start monitoring your\nquestions\nbecause what most people will do and you\nknow this a lot of their questions are\nhorrible\nwhy do i suck why don't i fit in why\ndon't i have what she has\nwhat's wrong with me this is what people\ndo ask if people listen to their\nthoughts a lot of their thoughts are\nnegative questions\nwhat's wrong with me oh yeah wow you're\nalready asking questions it's just\nthe quality of your questions are\nprobably pretty low great\nso now we need to first more actively\nseek ask questions be vulnerable about\nit pay attention to the quality of\nquestions you're already asking\nand what we found in the research was\nwas really easy for people if they want\nto draw the circle out yeah or draw\nthese circles out\nit's specifically we wanted the research\nand i interviewed 300 of the top high\nperformers in the world\nnot for podcasts but like in real like\nstructured academic style\nand here's what they tend to be more\nclear about\nthey are more clear about self social\nskill and service and here's the\nbreakdown of that\nself is they have an intention of who\nthey want to be\nand they're clear about that you're like\nif you could describe your ideal self we\ndo this in the research it's actually on\nvideo it's\ninteresting if you ask an underperformer\nor a high performer\non video could you describe your ideal\nself drop\nthree or four words to describe your\nideal self high performers\nthe answers like fall right on their\nmouth underperformers like\nit's almost like they never thought\nabout it yeah so they didn't have the\nintention about who they wanted to be so\nwhat i have people do\nis in their phone i have them program\ntheir alarm\nto describe their best self in three\nwords and make that alarm\npop up throughout the day so you're\nwalking because you always look at your\nphone with buzzes it buzz the alarm\nand it says bold dynamic confident great\nsays that over and over or\nkind loving thoughtful you know or\ngenerous\nempathetic you know uh whatever when\nthat pops up over and over and over it\nstarts to set the intention in the mind\na little bit that's why people\nshould use affirmations to on the social\nside they were incredibly intentional\nabout how they wanted other people to\nfeel\nyes you and i just talked about this out\nthere about what i love about you\nis you want people to feel like they are\nyour friend\nand you want to feel like a friend to\nthem that's a social intention\nyou're clear about that and you even\nsaid when you got clear about that\nsomething changed for you\nyeah massive it was huge and i think\nwhat what i love about what you're\nsaying right now is this\nwe always get lost in the confusion of\nwho we are\neven at the most basic things yeah so\nwhat i say to people\nlike how many times have you ever stayed\nup and struggled to find something to\nwatch on netflix\nit sounds like a stupid example but my\npoint is i'm guessing a high performer\nknows exactly what type of movies they\nlike that's right they know what type of\nfood they like in the morning for\nbreakfast lunch and dinner\nand when you ask people they'll say oh\nno no but i like being spontaneous\nand and often i think that that's answer\nmeans i don't know\nor i don't really think about these\nthings yes and so if you are asking\nwhat kind of movies do you like they'll\nbe able to say these are my favorite\nmovies yeah i found that when i could\nhave more self awareness about what\nmovies are like\nyeah i had more self awareness about how\ni wanted to be in social situations yes\nand self yes and and i think it starts\nwith the small things and the big things\nyeah uh everything from what you want to\neat for breakfast\nall the way through to how are you gonna\nserve and impact the world this is the\nsuperpower you have because you meditate\nbecause you journal you write you\nreflect\nthat reflective process of our lives has\ngotten\nkind of stolen away by the distractions\nso people don't know and you could see\nyou could see a video they're like ah\nthey don't know the other element is\nskill\nso they like high performing you say\nwhat's two or three skills you're\nworking on in your life right now that\nyou're actively learning or training on\nthey're like bop bop bop underperformers\nlike i don't know\nlike they're almost hoping to get better\nand you're like oh no you you you need\nto decide\nthese are skills like for me i sucked on\nvideo\nsucked i got my video guy travis here\nright here he could tell you 10 years\nago\ni was kind of horrible really travis yes\noh wow\nit was a nod and i couldn't believe it\nit was awful\ni mean even before him i had the\nremember flip video cameras\nno one knows what i'm talking about oh\nyeah then i remember the flip video\ncamera it was like\njust a stick and i had a button on it\nand i would i was broke living in an\napartment at the time and i duct tape it\naround\nthis box and press the button and i had\nmy shirt was all\nopen and my hair was like all over and i\nwas like i'm brand new because i didn't\nknow how to talk to camera i didn't know\nhow to be myself yeah i was\nvideo was really awkward for me yeah\nlike in all the\npersonality tests believe it or not i'm\nhalf introvert\ni'm right down the line between\nintrovert and next word so i need\nmy personal time so camera was super\nawkward for me\nand i was like okay but if i want to\nchange the world\nguess what is necessary communication\nskills\ni'm going to have to learn that i i was\nnot i didn't wasn't raised in a place i\nwas raised in montana where men\ndidn't really communicate except with\nlooks glances and fists you know\nso it's like if a guy lifted it wasn't\nlike\nwe like we're gesturing right now yeah\nwhere i'm from if their hand came up\nyou're getting punched in the face man\nthat was it oh uh\nso i had to learn emotional intelligence\nthat's a skill\nuh so communication emotional\nintelligence when i got into our\nbusiness\ni had to learn copywriting i know what\nthat was email marketing i didn't know i\nhad to learn coding\ni don't none of that i knew what it was\nbut i was always confident\nand i think real confidence is your\nbelief in your ability to figure things\nout\ni believe in my ability to figure things\nout give me enough time energy resources\nstudy books mentors\ni will figure out hey you want me to go\nto the moon i'll figure it out\neven though i have no idea today i can\nlearn and get mentors so that's a deep\npart of my life high performers have\nthat\nthey just believe they'll figure things\nout that confidence is what ties\na lot of their habits and their\nabilities together so\nskill set oh i better learn copywriting\nand video so i practiced video\na bajillion times i forced myself to do\nit a bajillion times\nand now i have 28 online courses and\ntravis has been there\ni shoot all of them extemp literally\ni'll do a two-hour video with the flip\nchart five\nwords on a page and i don't i don't need\na script or anything\ngoing from a kid who's like but you know\ni couldn't get it out to just\nflowing do four day seminars\nby myself for 10 hours a day on stage\nspeaking\nlike you know artists lose their voice\nsometimes singing for three hours i go\nten hours a day for four days\ni had to learn vocal control i had no\nidea how to do that that was a skill\nbut that's the important thing everyone\nlistening please write down what are the\ntop skills you would need to master\nto succeed in your purpose\nin your life in your career and the last\nelement there was service\nyeah high performers they kind of know\nthe service they want\nto bring to the world that's why i was\nlike jay's going to smash this\nbecause i mean you were so humble you're\nlike i've only been doing this x amount\nof time brendan\nbut you already knew you want to make\nwisdom go viral and you knew what was\ntrue to you\nyou knew the type of purpose you wanted\nto make and you were and you're still\nseeking that out and clarifying like we\nall are\nbut high performers know the service\nthey want to give to the world\nand they don't know it exactly or\nperfectly but\nthey're intentionally moving towards\nthat and so for those who are like i\ndon't know if i have clarity i'm like\nokay get clarity about yourself a little\nmore yeah about how you want to treat\npeople and be with people\nabout what you need to develop and how\nyou want to give or serve\nand if you focus on that like every day\nevery week you're conscious of those\nfour things one day you're just so much\nmore confident and clear\nabsolutely yeah and what i love about\nthat is just this\nsometimes it's just what you're\nfascinated with right now\nthat's right because i think sometimes\nwe make it too big and we're like oh\nwell\nwhat's my big purpose or what's my big\nservice to the world and it's like well\nwhat moves you right now like what are\nyou interested in right now when\ni mean mine was totally the opposite way\ni grew up as a really shy kid i'm right\ndown the middle of intro and next word\ntoo\nand my parents forced me to go to public\nspeaking and drama school when i was 14\nyears old oh my god because they were\nscared that i was too shy and i was too\nmuch of an introvert\nand i didn't know how to communicate so\nmy parents forced me to go from my\nschool it's an extracurricular activity\ni went three times a week three hours\nevery week from ages 14 to 18.\nwow the practice the exams that we were\nexamined\non reading a paragraph from a book with\ntonality and\nbeing able to bring a story to life just\nthrough\nwords and visuals and then being able to\nthere was this thing called\nimpromptu presentations where you got a\nsubject five minutes before you had to\ngo in and talk about it\nand you'd be able to talk about it and\nyou couldn't say anything that wasn't\ntrue\nso you had to make sure that it was all\nfactual and whatever you did research in\nthose five to 10 15 minutes\nwas right and and i remember doing that\nand\ni get to the end of that and i was like\noh well i've got this skill now but i\ndon't know what to use it for\nbecause that's basically what i was like\nat 18. yeah oh so i've learned how to do\npublic speaking i'm now\nfour years into my london academy of\nmusic drama and arts and i've got you\nknow gold medal in this this this but i\nwas like what do i do with this because\ni had nothing to talk about\nand then when i started studying\nphilosophy from the eastern perspective\nof the vedas and the bhagavad gita i was\nlike\noh this is what i was meant to learn it\nfor\nlike it almost like was i had a skill\nwith no service\nsure and and i don't that's what i'm\nsaying if you're listening to this right\nnow and you have a skill with no service\ndon't worry\nor if you have a service with no skill\ndon't worry that's right you know just\ngo and find the missing piece of the\njigsaw you just gave us yes this four\npiece jigsaw you just gave us\nchances are you probably have one of\nthem yeah and then you can go and build\nthe other three\nbut don't worry about having all of them\nnow right and i think yeah i love that\nyeah\ni love that and you you followed those\ninterests and develop them or develop\nskills without even knowing how\nso many people want the path to be\ncompletely clear now and you and i were\njust talking about this is like\nyou you you have to have faith\nin the timing of the path you have to\nbelieve that serendipity will appear\nwhen it's supposed to appear\nthat purpose will reveal itself\nsometimes\nin one battle and sometimes in another\nbattle\nsometimes in this game or that game or\nthis thought or that activity\nand you know i think people stress way\ntoo much\nabout getting clarity and that's why i\nlove the phrase seeking clarity which\ncame from research\nbut no they're just they're actively\nseeking it's not like a 60 year old high\nperformer\nhas everything figured out more than a\n30 year old high performer by definition\nwhat's making them high performers\nthey're both still seeking\nto dial it in like you and i are going\nto be dialing it in our whole life\nsometimes it'll be a shift\nsometimes it'll be a total break\nsometimes but that doesn't stop for\nanybody no it just doesn't yeah i love\nthat i love that differentiation between\ngetting and seeking clarity\nthe other thing that fascinates me that\nyou've written about high performers\nis this strive for perfection where high\nperformance can often be hard on\nthemselves\nand and i'd love to hear your\nperspective on this it's this difference\nbetween\nthe pressure that we place on ourselves\nversus complacency\nyeah because i think right now we're\nhearing a bit of both out there on\nsocial media and everywhere a lot of\npeople are confused it's like\ndo i really go hard on myself and am i\nreally disciplined and am i really harsh\nto myself\nor actually do i just let it go and just\nlet it flow and let it happen and you\nknow i want to hear what your\nresearch on the high performer said yeah\nthey came into perfection versus\nprogress yeah there's\nthere's no question they're more into\nprogress than perfection there's no\nquestion\nthere's like zero question that they\nare working on the things that move the\nneedle in their life so they're focused\non\nthe the the things that matter most so\nthey're good at wheeling out\ndistractions\nbut you know what i was telling people\nwas like if you think you're a\nperfectionist\nyou're probably lying and and the reason\nthat is\nand that people hate when i say that but\nif you look it up in the book\nin the dictionary it's like perfection\nlike if you actually look at perfection\nor to perfect it comes from that root\nword\nto perfect to perfect does not mean it's\ndone\nto perfect means like two things happen\nin in that connotation of two perfect\nfirst\nit has to be an iteration or a start it\nhas to be done in like first draft to\nperfect it means take it from\nbeing done being released being out\nthere being com\nyou know where you feel like it's a\nstart and then\nto perfect it to keep working on it to\nkeep\niterating on it and what perfection\ni what perfectionists always say here's\nwhat they really say\nwell i haven't started yet because i'm a\nperfectionist and i'm only going to do\nit if i can get it completely right\nno you're lying there's a difference\nbetween want there's a difference\nbetween\nperfecting and being fearful yes and\nwhat most perfectionists are is they're\nscared\nthey're scared to start and scared not\nto get it right\nso they don't even begin yeah a real\nperfectionist\nis so in friggin motion they are they're\nperfecting they're beating it up they're\niterating they're\nthey're dialing it in and they are\nactive at it to perfect\nrequires an active improvement\nand most people who say their\nperfectionists are actually dead stop\nfear\nyeah and so i'm just like be clear about\nwhere you're at\nyeah absolutely no i think that's great\nadvice i love that advice because i've\nalways had a rule since i started that\nall my videos\nare 70 complete so that's my rule yes\nit's 70 that's all you're getting yeah\nthere's words that i say wrong there's\nfumbles there may be a few mistakes here\nand there the editing may be slow\nbut it's like my rule was 70 because\nthat journey from 70 or 75 to 99\ncould take decades yeah you can never\nit could i would never release something\nand i remember in 2016 after my first\never video one of my first videos that\nwent viral\ni actually got so scared because it was\nalmost like oh i have to live up to that\nnow\nso i remember not creating yeah and so i\nwent from creating one video a week to\ncreating one video a month\nand guess what i learned less i was\nengaging less to connect with my\naudience to understand what they needed\nand what i was giving\nyeah and i was trying less ideas which\nmeant that i wasn't learning\nlearning i wasn't growing at all i\nwasn't progressing and the world was\nbeing taken from\ngetting more beauty from which came from\na place of not thinking like that\nwhich came from a place of not trying to\nbe perfect exactly the original video\nthat did well came from a genuine place\nof just wanting to serve\nand trying to figure it out and then all\nof a sudden we're not serving anymore\nand so i was like okay this doesn't make\nany sense and i was like actually and\nthen last year when we started making\nmore videos\ni can honestly handle my heart say that\nwhen we started doing three videos a\nweek\ni started to learn so much more yeah i\nwas like oh i really like it when i\nwrite like this and i really like it\nwhen i create like this and\nthe audience really responds when i\nshare it this way and i was learning so\nmuch more\nyeah and i was feeling more fulfilled by\nmaking more mistakes but learning more\nand so my mistakes increased\nyeah but your learning increases which\nwhich was a much more\nfulfilling place to be even though it\nwas tough at times but it was fulfilling\ni love that yeah i love that if you guys\nare listening you're thinking oh there's\njust two podcast guys jamming about how\nit's so easy to get started\nlet me let me share with you this one of\nthe higher performers in the world jeff\nbezos\nwho started a little company called\namazon tiny he\ntalks about this idea that he an\nexecutive team\nmakes decisions when they have about\nsixty percent of the information\nuh so i'm ten percent above jeff bezos\nso yeah i should\nyeah actually think about that for a\nminute like wait a minute\na person and a team that could get all\nthe information in the world\nthey what they do is they're moving\nforward even when they don't have\neverything and what perfectionists do\nwhat they don't realize is there's a\ndifference between perfection remember\nperfection is\nto perfect in motion iterative moving\nit's active\nwhat they also can't admit sometimes is\nthe real struggle is they're indecisive\nmost perfectionists they actually know\nthe next moves and i'm like go\nswat team make it happen release it drop\nit do it\ngo and i'm cheering them on i'm like go\nlike for everyone listening\nyou need to know high performers are\ndecisive not because they are like\ni know everything and i've got clarity i\nknow\nthey know if they don't drop it if they\ndon't release it if they don't do it\nthey can't iterate and make it better\nthey can't learn just as you said\nand worse they can't be of service\nbecause when you're in silence in your\nlife and you're in silence because of\nfear in your\nlife not silence like the way you and i\ntalk about in positive way\nbeing still and silent inside that's a\npositive thing but when you are in\nsilence in a way in which you are\nsuffering because of fear\nyou are not going to be able to serve\nyou have to be in motion to serve you\nhave to\nrelease things to perfect it you've got\nto be decisive\nalmost everybody listening i i did this\ncourse with oprah winfrey network called\nyour next bold move\nand that language of being bolder\neverybody listening probably should do\nthat and not because i'm saying\nyou know carte blanche ever should be\nbolder i'm just saying carte blanche\neveryone should be bolder\nlike they should like be bold like for\nme\nbold is we just did the influencer event\ni i think you were sitting there and i i\nwas travis was sitting there\nand they were like why don't you just\nask your friends you have\nall these people who they've learned\ntheir careers from the\nhelp just ask them to come and speak and\nbeing bold is asking sometimes not just\ntaking some huge action it's asking for\nhelp\ni wish as a 19 year old kid i could look\nback and say hey kid man you're going to\nkill yourself\nask someone for help tell someone what's\ngoing on your head\nraise your hand like admit it be\nvulnerable\nand i didn't i didn't know that that\nwould have been bold i've been bold\nbeen vulnerable and i so it bold doesn't\nhave to be\nswat team take down the world sometimes\nask for help\nput yourself out there and know you'll\nfigure out you'll catch that clip you'll\nfigure it out you'll get it going on\nyou'll improve but move yeah\nlike the world needs action takers right\nnow it desperately needs it we have a\nlot of sideline\nyou know conversationalists a lot of\nsideline\nyou know judgment we have a lot of\npeople not in the arena\nand we need more people in the arena in\nplay we can't keep\npointing and blaming and saying this is\nwrong that sucks and everything but\nwe're not moving our feet forward\nand demanding change creating change\nfighting for the change that we want\nbecause we think well i don't have the\nperfect plan it's not anything to fight\nfor oh no\nyou have values you have passion\nyou have interests fight for those you\nhave a project you believe in\nat work talk about it stop waiting for\nthe perfect time to bring it up\nthere's not gonna be perfect time bring\nit up you believe in someone and you\nwanna\nhelp lift them up do it now don't wait\nfor the perfect time it's like\nwe've gotten too sedentary in\nnot just in our physiology but in our\nactual actions\na tweet is not an action like you you\ngotta move\nyou gotta make things happen and i think\nthat's what high performance really\ninspired in me\nbecause if it sounds like if it sounds\nat all like i'm being preachy\ni'm literally just sharing what i\nlearned from these high performers\nbecause the truth is they were more bold\nthan me doing the research i was like oh\nokay i got up they were more clear than\nme they were more energized\nthan me they were more productive\neveryone thinks well brandon's got it\nall figured out or whatever i'm like\nno i'm a student and i'm just reporting\nwhat i heard\nfrom the field y'all and i want you to\ntake some of this stuff in\nthere they had habits that allowed them\nto succeed beyond normal people\nbut here's what's beautiful about high\nperformance and this is really important\nthere's success but in the way we\nmeasured high performance high\nperformance means\nyou succeed beyond standard norms over\nthe long term\nwhile maintaining well-being and\npositive relationships\nthat's the hardest part that's the\nhardest part that's why i love your\npodcast\nbecause so much of what you come back to\nis relationships but high performers\ndon't burn out relationships they don't\ntake people for granted\nin fact you know it's like booker t\nwashington taught us you know there's\ntwo ways to exert strength one is\npushing down\nthe other is pulling up and high\nperformers they're the pulling up kind\nthat's why high performers also don't\nreport being lonely at the top\none of my mentors brian tracy said if\nyou're lonely at the top you did it\nwrong\nbut high performers because you're\nlifting people up it's almost like\nyou have a chorus of people right you\ngot a tribe you lifted people up along\nyou were generous with people as euros\nand that's what that our research what\nbecame so famous about iform's habits\nwas\nwe could measurely prove long-term\nsuccess and say\nwait you can have long-term success and\nmaintain your health and your\nrelationships that's possible\nbecause most people think you have to\ncompromise you got to become a jerk\nor you can't work out yeah that's not\nyou can't be married or you can't have a\nlong-term relationship you can't have\nkids\nwell you tell ourselves these stupid\nstories or you have to come from a\ncertain thing the other thing that was\nreally pioneering the goddess in a lot\nof academics and\ncorporate is we measurably showed high\nperformance\nis not strongly correlated with age\ngender nationality i love that\npersonality\ncompetency years on the job or\ncompensation and every time someone\nwants to argue with me i just go to\nbasic common sense i'm like\nokay they're like well of course rich\npeople or\nhighly compensated people work harder\ni'm like oh no have you ever worked for\na lazy butt\nboss they were getting paid more but\nthey were lazy yeah like\npayment doesn't mean high performance no\n100 either more does age\nyou know we we got time like we got old\npeople out performing young people young\npeople out performing old people\nuh where you're from there's high\nperformers in every given culture\nand it's not because their personality\nbecause you have introverts\nand extroverts people who are open\npeople who are neurotic people who have\nno anxiety people have tons of anxiety\nbut it's the habits\nthat they are following the robot and\nhigh performance habits that is\nthat's what it was because we measured\n100 different performance variables\nand it came down to these six\nhigh-performance habits and uh and and\ni loved it too because i was wrong yeah\nabout like if you asked me what i\nthought\ni was going to ask you oh my god\nliterally just about to ask oh you were\nwhat was one that surprised you i was\nliterally just about to ask you that\nthat's crazy\nuh one of them that didn't make or like\nsomething that yeah tell me about that\nyeah\nsomething because me personally you know\ni identify as as\nyou know an author speaker coach creator\nonline trainer thought leader hopefully\nsocial media guy\nwhatever um creator uh\ncreativity not in the top six\nwasn't no yeah and it floored me because\nthat's me\nbut i i interviewed this guy he was a\nchief technology officer for\nuh you know a fortune probably 10 to\nfortune 10 company\nhe's got tens of thousands employees and\nhe said well brendan\ni'm not particularly creative i don't\nthink my team is particularly creative\nbut we are incredibly intentional and\ndisciplined\nand we are incredibly collaborative\nthose things which for him was his style\nof productivity\nmade him a high performer even though\nthey really weren't that creative\nbut so for those who don't feel like\nthat's really important because in this\nmodern social media world\nif you don't identify as a creative\nperson which a lot of people do not\nthey don't feel like they have that gift\neven though they do\nthat's okay and it what's interesting\nabout the research it doesn't say\ncreativity is not important\nit says that these six habits and high\nperformance habits are more important\nbecause in you know research you do\ncorrelations and so it's like\nclarity energy necessity\nproductivity influence and courage\nare all just more important in this\nparticular research\nthan some of these other things and\nthese are all things anyone can have\nthat's what anybody can do it's so\namazing about the research\ni'm hearing those and i'm going there is\nthere's no excuses basically your\nresearch tells us there's no excuse\nfor the dorks who are listening like me\nthe geeks and the data hounds\nthe way that you do that is we all the\n100 performance variables we\ncodified and we also took from academic\nresearch um\nand my own experience in training people\nfor a decade was\nwe put it through a filter are these\nhabits\nsomething that are observable learnable\nmalleable which means you can change it\nimprove it\num and uh can happen across domains so i\nmean the ceo can do it but so can the\nperson at the front desk\nyeah so can the mom at home so can the\nstudent so can the athlete\nmeaning these hat that's how he i'd\nidentify him otherwise what they were\nwere that person's personality or it was\nyou know that person had a natural\nstrength or skill there\nbut also for those who are interesting\nand you're so worried about your\nstrengths because a lot of people\nlistening\nlike me maybe when the whole strengths\nmovement started i was like i'm screwed\ni ain't got none\nthe good news is high performers don't\nreport working on their strengths\nany more than underperformers or anybody\nelse\nbecause high performers less often ask\nwhat am i good at what are my unique\nstrengths\nthen they tend to ask what is needed\nhere\nand how can i be of service\nso for example if i had said is my\nstrength video\ni would have never done video instead i\nsaid how do i be of service to more\npeople i'm gonna have to reach more\npeople\nhow to use video same thing right so\npeople\ndon't get trapped in thinking if you\ndon't have a strength right now\nthat a you can't develop it and b\nthat that's necessary we need less\npeople kind of gazing at their navels\nand and and being like what am i like\nand and i love the self-awareness and\nthe deep introspection\nbut we also need people who just show up\nand\nprovide service even if they're not\ncomfortable with that\neven if they're not good at that like\nmost of the things that we do\nwe weren't good at but we said oh that\nwould help me be of more service\nlet me do it let me figure it out yeah\nthere's a difference between\ninexperience and weakness\nyeah there's a difference right like so\nit's not really you've not really\nexplored\nsomething it's just an experience that's\nright right if you never started a\npodcast like\ni didn't know how to interview before i\ndid my first ever podcast like you just\ndon't know right you don't\nyou know practice interviews at home or\nyour parents never interviewed you and\nyou do your first interview\noh okay i like that i learned that i got\nthat wrong we\nmaybe should have put the mic closer to\nhim and maybe the camera was in the\nwrong angle and then and then you change\nit right and i i think you're spot on\nthat\nit don't yeah do not accept inexperience\nfor weakness\ndo not do not just sit there and go i\ndon't have that as a natural gift\nyes and this is one of the reasons why\ni'm going into soccer analogy here sorry\nbut\nit was why i admire so many uh a player\nnamed cristiano ronaldo a great soccer\nplayer incredible because he's\nworked on things and often people say to\nhim oh it's not god-given for him or\nit's not a gift he was given\nbut it's like for me that's what makes\nit more incredible it's that he's\nworked on every single part of his game\nto become this complete player\nthat's it and and to demonstrate that\nthat the work ethic and the\nnot just the work ethic but the seeking\nclarity and that tell me about the\nenergy piece i'm fascinated by that\nbecause i feel like i want to hear the\ndefinition of energy that you explored\nyeah\nand also just how people were able to\nbring energy even when they didn't feel\nlike it too because that seems like a\nbig\nthing for a high performer to be able to\ndo is bring it when they don't feel i'm\nso glad i did this because i you know\nenergy to me is just like a feeling or a\nsense but in the research we had to\ncodify\nthree separate kinds of energy one is\nmental energy\nwhich is straight up your mental focus\nand stamina\nright to do activities right\nright without just like tuning off right\nbecause that's hard\nyeah i mean i'm sure some people have\nstarted writing a paper and you have to\npage one and a half and your lan your\nbrain went somewhere else totally\num you're just tired the other one is\nemotional energy\nwhich is the quality of positive versus\nnegative emotion and the last one\nwas a spiritual energy a sensation that\nthey were in flow or not\nand what we found out is high performers\nhave incredibly intentional habits\nto protect that energy\num you know when we were on tour with\nher oprah she\nuh when oprah was on tour she tells this\ngreat story about how\nshe was so moved by someone who's on her\nshow who went into a green room and was\ntelling over the story of\nshe saw this sign that said please be\nresponsible for the energy you bring\ninto this space\nand i'm always saying please be\nresponsible for the energy you project\ninto the world\nyes high performers are so critically\naware\nof what their energy is their feeling\nand how they're treating other people\nit's profound and the way that they do\nthat is they have a lot of habits that\nprotect their well-being so\nthey're truly seeking to optimize health\nthey care about nutrition um on the\nworld's largest study on productivity\nthat's ever been done\nfound out that on average the world's\nmost productive\none percent of people take a break every\n52 minutes\nevery 52 minutes they take a break now\nif you ask them did you need the break\nthey're like\nno they could power through all day\nthey have the mental energy and stamina\nthey could go but they take the break\nlike a pit stop\nlike in like a nascar right the car the\ncars actually don't need to stop right\nthen\nthey stop to change things out and\noptimize things so they can keep going\nfaster\nyes we have to do that in our own lives\nso some of them that's meditation\num one that's incredibly important for\neverybody here\nespecially the united states right now\nin the united states of america 72 of\namericans are overweight or obese\nand that has incredible health\nrepercussions that is you're sicker\nlonger you die\nearlier you report less happiness\nthroughout the majority of your life you\npass some of that behavior onto children\nlike it's a very big deal and it's not a\njudgment of a\nof a body shaming thing it is a your\nquality of life in every measurable way\nthat they have in science shows\nit's not as good and we want you to feel\nokay\nwell high performers they work\nout five times per week\n40 percent more likely than an\nunderperformer\nnow that workout might be literally like\nyou take a 45-minute walk\nat after dinner sure it doesn't mean\nyou're climbing around the mountain it\ndoesn't mean you have to have a six-pack\nor anything you move every day\nand so they're protecting that you know\ni think that's what's really important\nthere they have active lifestyles\nnot because it's easy because they know\nthe alternative of\nburnout and fatigue will hurt their\nperformance yes\nexactly every new nba guy i've ever\nworked with they want to party they want\nto rip it up they just got that check\nthey're a superstar now they're on the\nphone with me brandon and i'm like\ndon't you you got a game in three days\ndude yeah\nthis is this is an easy thing if you\ncare about how you show up in three days\nand that's what i always tell people how\nyou feel right now\nis going to ripple into three days yeah\nlike we know that from research\nlike your nutrition today actually\naffects three days of behavior\nthat's profound we we don't get that no\nand and then when you measure it out\nover longevity studies no it affects\nyour whole lifespan\nso it's wildly important and the most\nresearch and you you're more even more\nfamiliar than that research than i am is\nis the absolute importance of having a\nmental game\nin which you meditate pray\nnap or just close your eyes for a few\nminutes every day\nto recenter a little bit a lot of\nfatigue\nand headaches are actually visual and so\nwhat i tell people\nto do and what we teach in our seminars\nhigh performance academy is i\nteach the audience all these things to\ndo at the 52-minute mark one of them\nstand up from your desk or stand up no\nmatter where you're at every 52 minutes\neven if you're driving pull over every\n52 minutes\nand what i tell people stand in place\nbounce in place not jumping up and down\njust kind of bouncing lightly from the\nknees\nclose your eyes because visual fatigue\nis a real thing\nthey've shown visual fatigue also hurts\ncreativity so\nclose your eyes bounce and take ten deep\nbreaths in through the nose as one\nout of the mouth 10 times\nwhile bouncing in place the bounce is\nmoving the lymph around your body\ncirculating the blood refreshing your\nbrain most\nbrain fatigue is also tied to blood flow\nso we just got to move\ndancing in place breath is tied to all\nchi\nall energy all life force closing the\neyes\nlets the brain literally reset it's\nunless profound\nthat's why meditators don't do with\ntheir eyes open like\nit's like there's a whole other level\nthat happens and i mean you're way more\nfamiliar with the research no no it's\nbeautiful\nit it is what i'm telling people is it\nis\nnecessary yes if meditation is your\nthing\npray praying your thing close your eyes\nclose your eyes anything take the\nafternoon nap because why in the blue\nzones they tend to take a nap after\nlunch\nthey live longer that is a\nreset tension in my mind release\nattention my body and then when i sit\nback down i go\nwhat's my intention and what is the\nabsolute best use of my time\nby the end of the day reset\ngo back to work i do that every hour\nthat's why i'm so annoyingly productive\ni love that we should do it right now if\nyou want to do it yeah you need some\nwater\nso first we just start with it reset\nwhich were\nthis is what i mean by bouncing yeah\nwe're just gonna do this we're gonna\nsway our arms forward and back\nclose our eyes ten deep breaths go\nnotice his breath is getting longer\nbecause that's what happens\nah\none more\nokay now just shake it out all right\nthat's just the breathing i love it all\nright you're coming back great all right\nall right\nnow we're gonna do chigong okay which is\na cupping activity they call it a\ncupping for casual\nand all we're going to do is we're going\nto activate the meridians of our body\nfor those who don't believe in meridians\nof your body\nall science shows that there's nerve\nendings on your skin\nright so if you don't believe in oh this\nis chi then\nyou believe in nerves and we're just\ngonna open up our body it's like if you\ntap your arm you feel that\nenergy 100 right we're gonna do that to\nour whole body amazing okay so qigong\nyeah so we're gonna start with our\nour fingertips so cupping means you take\npositive intent\nand energy a lot of the the master's\ndon't teach like put a color\nlike blue or green or a vibrant color\nfor you here\nand we're going to cup what means we're\ngoing to lightly tap and we're going to\ngo from here\nall the way up okay and then we're gonna\ndo we're gonna do here\nand we'll do here we'll do here we'll do\nhere\nand then we're just gonna do one right\nhere which is a huge meridian in the\nback right here everyone's gonna know\nthat\nyep so we're just gonna start here like\nthis\nand the intention is take a nice breath\nin\nnice without this is where everyone\noutside your studio is going what are\nthey doing\nlike richard shows up like what is\nhappening\nso we do this i do this every 50 minutes\nin a plane i love it you release your\nshoulder release all the tension in your\nshoulder and really\nstrong okay now from your waist we're\ngoing to move up you're just moving up\none inch at a time\ntake a nice deep breath in right when\nyou get below your armpit\nnext hand going up\nand just breathing just putting energy\npositivity joy into your arms\nmost people have really strong to drop\nyour shoulder\nmost people carry so much tension their\nshoulders just releases the tension the\nshoulder\nright here now we're going to bend\nslightly at the waist and right on your\nlower back\nyou're going to take five breaths here\nstand close your eyes bounce five more\nbreaths\nsway your arms\nopen your eyes jump in place feel great\nand now just release\ni feel great that was awesome and you're\na loss that's amazing\nwe can show in brain scans that that\ndecreases blood flow you decrease blood\nflow you decrease oxidation\nwhich your body and your brain needs for\nactivity\nlike your mitochondria everything in\nyour body counts on do we get some blood\nflow\nare we are we like and so what people\ndon't know is their brain is off half\nthe day\nand they think because they're tired and\nbreath is the way back in\nthis activation which people are like\nthink is so weird it's like oh no just\nlike if you're like i'm\nif you're watching this and you didn't\ntry it or you're listening like\nliterally\njust tap your forearm five times and\nyou're like\nyou're like and then notice the energy\nyou're like oh the energy\njust changed right there like it really\nchanged\nwell when you do that your whole body\nchi gong actually goes ankle up\nankle around here and the whole body and\nthen they'll also often put tapping in\nyes yes and all of a sudden you're like\nisaac now now i'm going to bang out like\n10 chapters in my book\nnow i'm going to finish the presentation\nnow i feel good to call my\ncoaching client yeah because sometimes\ni'll do you know i'll let you know i'm\ni'm extremely lucky to coach some of the\ntop performers in the world\nin athletics and business right before i\ncame over here i had the blessing of\ncoaching a billionaire\nliterally on the way over uh uh uh af\nthis meeting this morning and what i\nhave found is\nif you want to be a high former you've\ngot to learn to turn yourself on\nright don't take that weird but no no\nyou have to how do you turn your\nbrain on how do you turn your spirit on\nhow to turn your heart on like you've\nhad that too where you're\nyou also you got to sit down you had a\nlong day we both had long days before we\ndid this if you can't turn your heart\nyour mind your spirit your body on\nthere is no chance for you to sustain\nlong-term performance\n100 i love that that was amazing that\nwas awesome no the reason why i love it\nso much is because\nwhat you just said about turning\nyourself on it so it's like when you're\nliving for\nso for me it was when i spent my time as\na monk i focused so much on the mind and\nwe really pushed our bodies\nto extreme lengths and then when i came\nback and i was having to live in this\nbody i was like\ni want to serve and that's why i want to\ntake care of my body and mind yes\nright like that became the intention i\nwas like i'm going to have\nincredible habits for what i eat and how\nmuch i work out and what i do with my\nbody because i want to serve for the\nrest of my life it is\ni don't want to die early because i was\nneglectful i don't want to die early\nbecause\ni was neglectful and not caring and\ncomplacent because\ni felt i was still 22 when when you\nstill feel all of this you can't have\nthe feet on the beard yeah\nand and so the soul is the soul is\nmotivated by\nservice like the soul gets energy from\nservice but the body\nneeds activity like this movement yeah\nto feel energized right every measurable\noutcome yeah in your life improves with\nmore quality of exercise yeah\nand i always tell people even at a\nspiritual level\nyou know i ask people you know would you\ngo to the house next door\nand spray paint it and break all the\nwindows and throw a bunch of garbage in\nit\nand yet you're so willing to vandalize\nthe temple\nthat god has given to house your soul\nthat's your house\nso if you wouldn't go vandalize your\nneighbor's house why are you vandalizing\nyour house\nyour gift it's very important you know\ngarbage in garbage out pay attention\nand i'm not here to say everyone has to\nyou know eat perfectly and work out a\nmillion percent\ni'm here to share the research that is\nunequivocal yeah\nmental health and exercise and\nprotecting both of those\ndiet nutrition meditation all of these\nthings\nsleep all of these impact\nhow good of a job you do tomorrow how\nlong you live\nyou know how good you feel and i'm like\neveryone wants to be happy\nso this that's what i was happy about i\nwas so happy that made it into the\nresearch that like\ngenerate energy that's the chapter\ngenerating energy how do high performers\ngenerate energy and sustain it\nand all these things we talk about in\nour industry it\ncame up in the research i was like yes\ni'm so happy about that yeah yeah\nit's amazing i love it this all the and\nagain it's accessible to anyone\nwe didn't we didn't pay for gym\nmembership just now right right we we\ndidn't have to have fancy clothes on\nyeah for the gym membership\ni feel like great i genuinely do podcast\nyeah literally we get\nfired up that's the i feel like i've and\ni'm not and i'm not saying this just for\nthe cameras like i mean this i actually\nfeel\nhow i felt when we first started yeah\nright it's it's got that you know it's\nlike yeah it's it's great and so 100\nworks i love recharge yeah 100\nevery 50 minutes and he's been with trav\nhas been backstage with me for 10 years\nor he's\nhe's been setting up video in the other\nroom and he hears that like\ni always do it and it's like because\nwhen you watch\nthe volume of online video i've done\nwhether it's youtube or our online\ncourses where most of my video is\nit's like so i mean it's we\nliterally i don't even know how many\nhundreds of hours are there\nand he's never seen me in the middle of\na video like\nyou know because of these practices um\nand\nit wasn't natural to me because i listen\nnetflix and chill\nlet's go brother i can chill like the\nbest of them i got no problem\nbut i want to make an impact i want to\nhelp people\nyou know what the worst thing is when\nyou're trying to help someone and your\nmind is kind of blinking out\nyeah because you didn't take care of\nyourself you didn't eat good\nyou didn't care about your sleep you\nknow i work with athletes\nhigh performers business people who who\nthey regret those moments in those days\nwhere they allowed themselves to burn\nout\nor they didn't care for themselves\nbecause it shows up on the scoreboard\nit shows up in your bank account and but\nmostly it shows up in how you treat\npeople i always tell people\nif you won't take care of yourself for\nyourself take care of yourself so you're\nless rude to other people\nyeah because guess when you're tired\nscience shows you're more irritable\nyou're more short and you're faster to\nconflict tolerance is low\nright 100 and so it's like if you want\nto take care of yourself yourself do it\nfor the poor people around you who\nprobably get some of that irritability\nyou know i love it brendan you're\namazing this was so much fun honestly\nthis is this has been so much fun yeah\nthis is great and\ni'm glad you had us do that activity i\nwanted to yeah me too too\ni feel better yeah i feel better but\nalso i just i want everyone listening\nand watching to know that\nyou know you can pick up such simple\nbeautiful tips and insights\nyeah just by watching now you can play\nthat part of the video over again and\nagain and again yeah\nwe'll turn it into a little instagram\nvideo that'll be fun\nbut it's just such an easy thing that\nanyone can pick up\nand literally refocus get back in the\nzone\nand and like you said it's like when you\nwant to serve you want to be at your\nbest\nyou don't want to be at your worst and\nyou're trying to push yourself and i\ngenuinely hear this from so many people\nwho i know are genuinely trying to give\ntheir best\nand serve yeah but they feel drained at\nthe end of the day\nyes because they're just giving and\noutpouring and serving and\nloving and caring and supporting and\nthey're just going for it\nand at the end of their day and i've\nbeen in that place before where you just\nfeel drained\nyes and i started to realize i didn't\nwant to feel that way anymore because\nthat wasn't the badge of honor of\nservice\nno that wasn't the badge of honor that\ni've really given today\nand if you believe in associations if i\ndo if\nif if you drain yourself every day in\nservice which a lot of people do\nat the end of the day you're burned out\nand you're tired at some point\nyour body and your brain your spirit and\nyour soul you don't mean to\nstarts associating your purpose with\nthat feeling\nwow wow and one day\nyou go maybe your psychology goes maybe\nthe purpose is wrong\nand it forgets no it's it's the behavior\nthat's leading to a feeling doesn't feel\ngood\nbut your brain doesn't know sometimes\nand it puts them together\nand now you question your purpose when\nreally you're tired\nand so let's do that yes and now you do\nthe math\nokay because we've all done that\neveryone listening has done that brunt\nforce\nbecause the human body is unbelievable\nwe we can go\nyears of burnout it's unbelievable other\nanimals would not put up with this\nnonsense\nbut we convince ourselves that it's okay\nno other animal does that\nwhich is i mean i mean well salmon they\nsay i'm gonna do it they swim till they\ndie okay i'm sorry some animals do\nbut but humans were super unique that we\npsych ourselves into this\nbut here's the issue a you will probably\nburn out your service because you won't\nfeel good about it\nbut think about high performers they go\nso much longer providing great service\nbut here's the trick if you do the math\non what i talked about\nbreak every hour take an eight hour work\nday\nhigh performers they're not smarter than\nyou they're not\nbetter than you they aren't more lucky\nthan you it's not their age their\nnationality but one of the things they\ndid during an eight hour workday\nthey took eight more breaks than you did\nthey took eight more breaks than you did\ntoday that's why tomorrow\nthey show up more clear that's why next\nweek\nwhen you're in the meeting and it's time\nto brainstorm and you're fried you come\nup with nothing\nit's that gallop on the whiteboard who\nwrote down 20 ideas because she's still\nfresh\nthat's not because her disposition she's\nprobably a high performer who took more\nbreaks than you\nwe think breaking and pausing and\nrefreshing is\nfailure sharpening yeah it's the only oh\ni love that sharpener\ni've never used that i love that\nsharpening it is sharpening it is the\nnascar at the pit stop\nto make it go faster to make it win the\nrace and so it's it's\nit's it's so funny when you say high\nperformance everyone goes\nwell they must they just out work out\nhustle outward actually i'm like oh no\nthey actually seek harmony more than\neverybody else\nthey act they look for that they're\ntrying to optimize their time\ntheir harmony to manage their energy so\nthey can perform longer i want to do\nthis\nuntil i'm dead yeah me too i'm one of\nthose guys like\ni found my purpose me too i want to help\npeople live love and matter\nto get there they got to achieve their\ngoals faster they got to use their voice\nthey got to help other people\nthey got to live an authentic vibrant\nlife and they\nthat that's what i want to help people\ndo i'll do that until i'm done i'll\ntell you so i got to manage myself yeah\nyou know i do those four-day seminars by\nmyself on stage for 10 hours i was like\nhow they just think well brenda's an\nenergizer bunny if you saw me backstage\ni'm doing that chigong\ni'm protein shaking it you know i'm\nstretching out every night i'm doing the\nice baths\nyes i'm changing my behavior from heavy\nlifting to more cardio to get the lung\ncapacity two weeks in advance\ni'm diligent about exactly what i eat at\nthe four day events\ni sleep at the same schedule like\neverything is\nliterally set up for me to perform 10\nhours a day on stage for four days by\nmyself\nthat's not luck that is because i care\ni love it brendan we end every interview\nwith the final five\nquick five rapid fire around so this is\nfive questions\none word answers maximum one sentence\nmaximum one sentence okay so that's good\nthe first question is\nwhat was the last kind thing you did for\na stranger\nuh one word oh gosh\nwell one said no i had it just came into\nmy mind because a dear friend had\nsomebody a big loss\nin their life

caretaker is very rarely asked\nfor care 100 so i'm here i love it\nokay question number two i'm sorry the\nanswer was sent the voice text\nbut i sent it one seven days in a row\nokay same one do a different ones do\nvoice text\nfor seven days a lot of people say i'm\nhere for you i was like i hound them\nyeah i love that okay question number\ntwo what's a lesson you find hard to\nteach others\npatience ah nice okay question number\nthree what's the one question you ask\nyourself the most\nyou've told us a bit about this man\noutside of did i live\ndid i love yeah i matter i ask\nwhat level of presence and energy\nam i holding and creating right now it's\na we call it line trigger yeah in high\nperformance like any time i wait in line\nlike starbucks or remaining line i\nalways what level of presence and energy\nam i right now it makes me qn\ni love that okay question number four\nthe one belief that took you the longest\nto really put into practice the one\nbelief that took you the longest to put\ninto practice\ntrust on others wow powerful we'll have\nto unpack that next time yeah\nquestion final five your fifth one is\nand i and i kind of know the answer to\nthis but i'm going to ask you anyway\nbecause you can you can change it up is\nhow do you know if you've lived a good\nlife the answer is to did i live that i\nloved it i matter\nno i love that um but most importantly\ndid i earn this\num you know did i did i earn that second\nchance\ni love it brendon bashad everyone you're\nthe man you're amazing man\nthis is amazing been an honor you're\nawesome thank you brother you are so\nincredible i can't wait to have you back\non\ni can't wait yeah you're going to come\nback and do a part two and a part three\ntimes\nif the audience asks

her\ndisposition\nshe's probably a high performer who took\nmore breaks than you we think breaking\nand pausing and refreshing is failure\nit's the only i love that sharpener i've\nnever used that i love that sharpening\nit is sharpening it is the nascar at the\npit stop\nto make it go faster to make it win the\nrace and so it's it's\nit's it's so funny when you say high\nperformance everyone goes\nwell they must they just out work out\nhustle outward actually i'm like oh no\nthey actually see harmony more than\neverybody else\nthey act they look for that they're\ntrying to optimize their
