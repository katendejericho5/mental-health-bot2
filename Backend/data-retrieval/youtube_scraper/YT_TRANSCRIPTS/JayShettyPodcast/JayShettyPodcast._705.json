grab a copy lori\nthank you for being here well thank you\nfor having me\nnow this is a real treat and as we were\npreparing i\ni ran into how many mutual friends we\nhave or\nmutual people that we've crossed paths\nto it so i've interviewed a guy\noh wow of many feels like many lifetimes\nago but when i was at huff post\nwith ariana huffington and at the same\ntime eva longoria is a really close\nfriend\nso it's just uh i feel like and and then\nyou know jim\nand eamon yes so when it all comes\ntogether it's always a small world\nabsolutely yeah absolutely but um tell i\nwant to start somewhere where\ni'm not sure maybe you get asked it a\nlot or not but i'd love to start with\ntell me about your latest adventure with\nyour son\nmy latest adventure with my son well\nthere are a lot of adventures because\nhe's 14.\nand uh he uh you know he's a really\ninteresting\nperson at this age i think that when\nkids are younger\nyou have you have more of a there's more\nof a hierarchy\nin the family um and i think all of a\nsudden they start thinking in all of\nthese complex ways and they make you\nthey hold up a mirror to you\nand make you ask questions about\nyourself in the world in a different way\nso i would say our adventures are\nconversations nice and and it does\ndoes what you know about the human mind\nand connection\nrelationships where does it help and\nwhere does it hinder in the parenting\nprocess\nthat's such a great question you know i\nthink what it does is it gives me an\nawareness\nof the importance of letting kids\nletting people access their feelings so\nso many times as parents we get\nuncomfortable\nwith a feeling that our kids are having\nand we try to talk them out of their\nfeelings\nso you know a kid says i'm angry about\nthat and we say\nreally you're so sensitive\nor we say you know or or they say i'm\nsad and we say\noh you know well here's a balloon you\nknow let's go to disneyland right we try\nwe try to like sort of talk them out of\nit or i'm scared and we say oh don't be\nscared there's nothing to be scared\nabout be brave\num and i think what happens is then\npeople\ndon't know how to access their feelings\nbecause they were always talked\nout of them so i think the the benefit\nyou know the upside\nof being the child of a therapist is\nthat nothing gets swept under the rug\nyou know the downside is that he'll be\ntotally screwed up anyway because\nyou know that's life yeah what are the\nlasting effects of that\nwhat you're saying is spot on like we're\nalways trying to negate or neglect\nfeelings and emotions that people share\nwith us\nwhat are the long lasting effects of\nthat well\nin adulthood right i think what happens\nis that people try\nto get rid of their feelings they don't\nrealize that feelings are positive that\nour feelings are our compass that they\ntell us\nthey give us information if you're sad\nwhy are you sad what needs to change if\nyou're anxious\nwhat is that telling you about what's\nnot working in your life\neven envy people are so afraid of envy\nand i always say to people\nfollow your envy it tells you what you\nwant so instead of\nsitting there and looking at what\neverybody else has seen what do i want\nhow can this help me to take this\nthe small step that i need to take to do\nsomething different so i can have what i\nwant\nso what happens is people will minimize\ntheir feelings um\nyou know will i have a roof over my head\nand food on the table so i shouldn't be\nsad\ni shouldn't be anxious i shouldn't feel\nthe way that i feel\num people will try to numb out their\nfeelings\nso many people feel like um you know\nnumbness\nis is a way of you know like kind of\nmanaging their feelings\nbut i feel like numbness isn't\nnothingness numbness\nis um it's not it's not not having\nfeelings it's\nbeing overwhelmed by too many feelings\nand your feelings don't go away just\nbecause you push them down\nand that's the problem because our\nfeelings will come out\nin behaviors in a short temperedness and\nanxiety\nin too much food or wine or time on the\ninternet a colleague of mine calls the\ninternet she said it's the most\neffective short-term non-prescription\npainkiller out there\ntrue true and and like every\nnon-prescription painkiller also has a\nlot of side effects\nwell yeah yeah terrible ones the problem\nis that\nif you don't know what you feel you\nyou don't know what your story is right\nand i think that our stories are\nare this way of making sense of our\nlives and so what happens is i as a\ntherapist see\npeople come in and they tell me their\nstory and\nthe thing is their story there's so many\nproblems with the story they're\nthey're we're all unreliable narrators\nright we're telling a story in a\nparticular way\nbut i think if we don't know what we\nfeel we only see a very narrow\npart of the story and it limits us yeah\nso true so true and and i feel half the\nchallenge is also that we've just become\nso disconnected with knowing how we feel\nabout anything\nso i mean one of the things that really\nhelps me is i'm always thinking like\nafter eating a meal\ni know whether i like that cuisine or\nnot like it's very clear to me\nafter i watch a movie i know whether i\nlike the movie or not so i often try and\napply\nthat same sense check with myself\nafter i meet a person after i go to a\nplace\nafter i interact with an energy is that\na good habit is that a habit that you\nrecommend is that what are the easiest\nways to getting closer to our feelings\nand actually understand how we feel\nabout something or someone well i think\nthe first thing is too is to notice when\nyou get afraid of a feeling i think it's\nalmost like our fear of our feelings is\nscarier than the feelings themselves\nso um you know what happens is somebody\nmight feel something that they feel like\nsomebody else might not like um\nand so they say oh i'm gonna adjust my\nfeeling to please others\nto make sure that it's how i'm supposed\nto feel about this\nand then they lose their sense of of\ntheir place of knowing we all have a\nplace of knowing\ninside of us and we sometimes it's\nalmost like we get lost\nand we can't find it because we're so\nconcerned about\nhow people are going to feel about the\nway we feel absolutely\nyeah and and i find like a big part of\nthat is also a survival mechanism right\nlike it's a feeling of like community or\nfeeling of tribe where\nwe want to feel almost artificial\nconnection\nbecause that feels safer than feeling\nuncertain disconnection\nright it's it's for survival we have to\nconnect we have to belong\nyou can't be alone you will you'll get\neaten by you know wherever you are\nso you have to have the tribe around you\nbut the problem is that\nit's not an authentic way of having the\ntribe around you when you're pretending\nto be something that you're not\nso so many people in therapy for\ninstance they they they come in and they\nhave a mask on\num and they're so afraid of you know\nthey want to entertain me they want to\nbe liked by me\nthey're afraid that they're boring and i\nalways say that if you show me the truth\nof who you\nare i will be fascinated by you\nno matter what that truth is but if\nyou're like look over here look over\nhere look over here\ni'm going to be so bored yeah i'm\nsitting there going what is this person\ntrying to\ntell me what is the significance of what\nthey're saying and they're what they're\nreally doing is trying to keep me\nout yes yeah absolutely yeah and it's\nalmost like\nbeing like a magician who's is scared\naway of giving their tricks and you're\ntrying to keep everyone entertained\nbut then you never see that person be on\nthat mask right yeah right\ntell me about a time when you've\ngiven someone some advice where you\nactually realize that you didn't feel it\nwas the best advice like how does a\ntherapist process that because i feel\nlike\nin any profession whether i'm i'm a\ncoach you know you're a therapist like\nwhen you're giving advice\nit's almost like there are times when\nyou're so certain about a belief\nyou're so certain about value and then\ni've looked back at stuff i've said and\njust been like\ni'm just so wrong have you ever felt\nthat how do you reconcile that for you\nand the person you've been working with\ni think it's really important for me to\nremember that i\nmight know what i would do in a certain\nsituation but that might not be the best\nchoice for them because i'm not living\ntheir\nlife so i have this word taped up in my\noffice it's ultra crepitarianism\nand it means the habit of giving advice\nor opinions outside of one's knowledge\nor competence\ni love it and and i think that that\napplies to our friendships and our\nromantic relationship everything\nbecause you can't know what another\nperson should do\nyou can help them come to a place of\nknowing for themselves\nwhat they should do so i'm always\nworking to help people to figure out\nto get to that place of what should i do\nand not ask the outside world and not\nyou know we crowdsource on the internet\nwe do that like we ask the internet\npeople will type in these questions like\nyou know husband is cheating what should\ni do\nand they crowdsource that and it will be\ndifferent for each person\nyeah i always feel like we have this\nextreme of like when we're going through\nsomething we'd ask\neveryone yes every opinion yes or we do\nthe opposite but we ask no one for\nnothing like you don't even ask the\nexperts or a therapist or\nsomeone who can actually help you get\ncloser to the answer and the reason we\ndon't ask is because of shame\ni think so many times we keep these\nsecrets from ourselves from other people\nbecause we feel we have so much shame\naround the fact that we're even\nstruggling with something\num you know so many people keep secrets\nfrom me as a therapist\nand uh carl jung called secret psychic\npoison\nand i think that's what they are is like\nwhen we keep something there's a\ndifference between of course privacy\nwhich we all need to have\nand secrecy secrecy is about shame\nprivacy is like a healthy boundary\nwow that's fascinating yeah secrecy is\ni can't tell this to anybody i get this\ni get this so much i see a difference\ntoo between\nthe way men and women keep things to\nthemselves right\nso so many men will come in and they'll\nsay i've never told anyone this before\nand then what they tell me feels like\nreally that that is your big secret\nand i feel so much compassion for them\nbecause i feel like it's so sad that in\nour culture\nwe tell men you cannot be vulnerable\nyou cannot share this um because\nyou will appear weak or you know\nwhatever it is it's not okay\num women will also come in and they'll\nsay i've never told anyone this before\nbut then they'll say except for my\nmother my sister and my best friend\nso they've told maybe one to three\npeople but for them it feels like\nit's a secret and they haven't told\nanyone so i feel like you know what is\nthis shame about why is it so hard when\nthe reality is that we're all going\nthrough similar things\nand if we don't talk about it we don't\nknow that\nabsolutely yeah and i think that's the\nsaddest thing about all of that is\nwe feel like everyone's got it figured\nout apart from us yes\nright yeah it's not only that we feel\nshame it's like we feel like yeah like\noh she's got it all figured out he's got\nit figured out and that person in my\ncompany's got to figure whatever it is\nbut\ni'm the only one right and then what\nhappens is we have this voice in our\nhead that is so\nself-critical so unkind because we don't\nget the feedback of oh\nthis is normal and everybody's going\nthrough it and so we walk around i had\nthis this one therapy patient write down\neverything that she said to herself over\nthe course of a few days and come back\nand read it to me\nand she comes back and she has this\nsheet of paper and she says i can't read\nthis i'm such a bully and there were\nthings like\nyou know are you gonna eat that with\nthose thighs or you made the mistake\nyou're so stupid\nor you know oh look at all those couples\ni'll never find anyone\nand we don't realize that that that's\nwhat's playing in our heads\nbecause we don't reality check with\nother people that they're also\nstruggling with some of the same things\nyeah and the thing is self-flagellation\nnever\nenhances our growth so people think i'm\ngoing to be tough on myself and i'm\ngoing to hold myself accountable and\nthen i'm going to grow and change\nuh-uh self-compassion is how you grow\nand change and that doesn't mean\nnot holding yourself responsible for\nthanks\nwhat it means is that you can be\naccountable\nand you can also be compassionate and\nthat combination is going to help you\ngrow and change\nyeah absolutely and by the way if anyone\ni'm just going to throw it out there if\nme or lori look like we're sweating\nit's because we are sitting in a sauna\nlike we are in a sauna right now with no\nac with no ac\njust for the benefit of this audio for\neach and every single one of you so\nin case you see a sweat it is the the\ndepth of the conversation yes but it is\nalso the fact that it is a sworn in\nand it's only going to get worse there\nwill be water yes very soon\nbut lori tell me about what first\ntook you into wanting to be a therapist\nbecause i feel\nlike today therapy is\nand i mean of course i'm only looking at\nit in the generation that i'm in but\ni'm seeing therapy being a very growing\nneed in the world\ni'm seeing it as an industry that i\nbelieve\nwe need more qualified people to serve\npeople and and to help people and\nsupport people we're seeing\nthe rise of mental health when you\ndecide to be a therapist\nwhat was your calling to that and where\ndid you see its role at that time\nversus how you've seen it evolve so it's\ninteresting because i came to\nthe therapy profession very late in life\ni never imagined that i would be a\ntherapist\ni started off when i graduated from\ncollege i was working\nuh doing film development and then i\nmoved over to nbc\nand i was doing um prime time series\ndevelopment\nand this was a long time ago this was\nthis was the year that er and friends\npremiered so this is\nyou know 1994. yeah great um great shows\num\nbut when i was working on er it was\ninteresting because i loved\nwhat i loved about working in tv and\nfilm two was\ntelling these rich human stories um and\ni\nfelt like er did that so well i mean\nnobody goes into an emergency room\nbecause they\nthey expected something to happen right\nso so it's these inflection points in\nlife\num and we had a consultant on the show\nwho was a real er\ndoctor and i spent some time in the er\nwith him and he kept saying to me i\nthink you like it better here than you\nlike your day job\nand he said you should go to medical\nschool and i said well i'm not i'm not\ndoing that i was a french major\ni'm not doing that um but i went to\nmedical school\nand i i felt like in medical school you\nsaw\nthe real stories so it wasn't the\nfictionalized versions of them it was it\nwas real life\nand when i got there it was like i went\nit was up to at stanford and it was like\nthe dot-com boom the first one before\nthe bus\nand everybody was saying oh you know\nthere's this new thing called managed\ncare and you're not going to be able to\nspend time with your patients in the way\nthat you want to and i was really about\nyou know had this idea of being the\nfamily doctor who guides people through\ntheir lives\nwhich of course leads to the therapy\nthing but i didn't realize that at the\ntime\num and so i ultimately um i started\nwriting when i was there\nand i left to become a journalist where\ni felt like i could really spend time\nwith people\nhear their stories help them tell their\nstories\nand then later when i had a baby\num i was you know it was one of those\nthings where\ni felt like i needed more human contact\nduring the day adult contact during the\nday\nand the ups guy would come with all the\ndeliveries and and literally i would\ndetain him and be like you know hey how\nabout those diapers and\nhe would back away to his big brown\ntruck and i thought something is wrong\nhere he would at\na certain point he would like tiptoe to\nthe door gently put the package down so\ni could not engage him in conversation\nright and so i called up the dean at\nstanford and i said listen maybe i\nshould come back and do psychiatry and\nshe said\nif you do psychiatry you'll probably be\nprescribing selexa in 15 minute\nintervals\ni know what you wanted to do why don't\nyou get a graduate degree in clinical\npsychology\nand do the work the deep work that you\nwant to do\nand that's exactly what i did so i feel\nlike i went from telling people stories\nto helping people change their stories\nin the therapy room i feel like my\nwriting background is so useful because\ni'm almost like an editor in the therapy\nroom where people come in with these\nfaulty narratives\nand i help them to rewrite them one of\nthe things i think people\nfeel when they come to therapy is um you\nknow i really want to understand who i\nam and i feel like part of knowing who\nyou are part of getting to know yourself\nis getting to unknow yourself it's to\nlet go of those limiting stories that\nyou've been telling yourself\nover and over um so that you can live\nyour\nlife and not that faulty narrative that\nyou've been telling yourself about your\nlife\nand that opens you up to so many more\npossibilities so sometimes\nwhat we think we know about ourself\nisn't really accurate\nand that's the editing that we do in the\ntherapy room yeah absolutely you're so\nright we need to unknow and unlearn\nyes so much more than we feel we need to\nlearn about ourselves and\nknow about ourselves it's the uncovering\nuh in in my book i talk about the\nanalogy that's given in in the spiritual\ntext of\na dusty mirror so it's like if you look\ninto a mirror\nand you look into it and you ask what am\ni looking at it's like all you see is\ndust and that's kind of like our\nexperience of who we are whereas when\nyou start wiping away the dust\nit can actually be a painful process in\nthe beginning because the dust comes in\nyour face and you cough a little bit and\nit gets in your eyes but then slowly you\ncan see yourself so it's that cleansing\naway of\nall the layers of dust that we've\naccumulated almost right and when you\nsay it's hard it is hard\nand i think sometimes people imagine\nthat they're going to come to therapy\nand they're going to download the\nproblem of the week and then they're\ngoing to leave and they don't have to do\nany work yeah\nyou know and and you actually do have to\ndo some work and that's why i talk in\nthe book about the difference between\nidiot compassion and wise compassion\ni love that yeah tell us about it so\nidiot compassion is what our friends do\nit's like\nyou know someone breaks up with you and\nyou're like oh he was a jerk even though\nwe know that like\nthis has happened the last three times\nbecause there's certain ways you behave\nin the relationship that lead to this\noutcome or\nyou know you didn't get the promotion\nyou wanted and we know why\nthat happened because it keeps happening\nto you and we say oh your boss\ndoesn't see your talent when we really\nknow what's going on\nbut we don't want to rock the boat we\nthink we're being supportive\nbut it's not really supportive and so\nyou know it's kind of like if a fight\nbreaks\nout in every bar you're going to it\nmight be you but we don't we don't say\nthat that's idiot confession right\nwise compassion is holding up that\nmirror but the clear mirror not the\ndusty mirror\nand it's holding up that mirror and\nsaying i'm going to help you to look at\nyourself\nin a way that maybe you haven't been\nwilling or able to see\nand i think you're gonna like what you\nsee because it's gonna help you\nnavigate through the world in a much\nsmoother way\nyeah and maybe you will have to make\nsome changes which people\nuh you know people usually come into\ntherapy and they're like i want things\nto change and what they want to change\nis someone else or something else\nthey don't realize that they are going\nto have to make some changes yeah and i\nand i want to say like you're the\nprotagonist in the story you're gonna\nhave to make some changes\nyeah absolutely and one of the things i\nthink we struggle with that is\ni was talking about this with a friend\nthe other day we were on a walk and we\nwere saying that\nshe was being really vulnerable and open\nshe's amazing i know she listens to the\npodcast you know who you are\nit's her name but it's\nit's the feeling of we want people to be\nhonest with us\nbut we struggle to be honest with people\nyeah\nso it's a weird like it's a weird circle\nbecause\nwe it's like me saying lori i want you\nto be really honest with me about how\nthis podcast is going\nbut then when my friend asked me how\ntheir podcast is going i'm not telling\nthem the truth\nyeah but i'm expecting you to tell me\nthe truth yeah and so almost we become\ndemanders of the truth but not givers of\nand then that continues that circle if\nthat makes sense\nand so how how do we actually open\nourselves up to create\nspace for friendships like that because\ni almost think in the same way as you're\nsaying\nwe're creating those scenarios in our\nlife again at work or in relationships\nyeah\nwe are inviting idiot compassion into\nour life that's right\nbecause we're not ready for it almost\nright right we have to be able to hear\nit i see this so much with couples that\ni see\nso a lot of times um you know somebody\nwill say and i see this\nmost typically in like a heterosexual\ncouple where\nuh the woman says to the man i want you\nto be really vulnerable with me i want\nto understand your inner life\ni want you to open up to me and then he\ndoes and he starts crying\nand she is frozen you know she's like\nwell\nyou know be careful what you're not this\nmuch yeah i didn't i didn't mean like\nthat\nright or if someone's like or if the\nthing that they're being truthful about\nis something about something going on\nbetween the two of you\nand people are so afraid to share that\nso maybe they'll be open about something\nout there\nbut if it's like there's something i\nwant to talk to you about us\nand the person says yeah i want to hear\ni want you to be really open and honest\nwith me\nuntil you really say i notice this\nhappens between us and here's something\nabout you\nand the person's like whoa i didn't want\nto hear that right so we're so\nuncomfortable with\nother people's truth you don't have to\nagree\nwith somebody else's feelings but you\nhave to know that\ntheir feelings are valid which doesn't\nmean that you have the same feelings\nthere's a distinction it's almost like\nthe difference between um\nwhen somebody really wants someone to\nforgive them and i always say like\nthere's a woman in the book she wants\nher adult children to forgive her for\nwhat she had done there are strange from\nher they\nand i said you know what you can't\nyou're asking for something called\nforced forgiveness\nthat that people are not going to\nforgive you because it will make you\nfeel better\nand sometimes not forgiving is okay it's\nokay if your children never forgive you\nmaybe they will have compassion for you\nmaybe they will see you\nas the mother that they want now even\nthough you couldn't\nbe that then we have to learn how to\nforgive ourselves\nbut so many times if someone says i'm\nreally upset about this\nwe say we want to hear that but we don't\nknow\nhow to um how to let it in how to be\nopen to it\nyeah and how do you in the in the\ntherapy room and in your life\nand when you're advising people people\nlive\nor sometimes we assume that people live\nvery problem driven lives\nso when they come and see you they feel\nthey have to start with a problem\nor sometimes when you see a friend you\nfeel like you have to share something\nthat's going wrong\nfor there to be a conversation i feel\nlike almost problems and wrongs have\nbecome better conversation starters or\nmore\ni would say more comfortable\nconversation starters for people\nas opposed to something positive do you\nsee that a lot is that you know what's\nso interesting\ni think that we have this weird\ndichotomy where\non the internet everybody's posting all\nthe positive things\num in person everybody's sharing all the\nnegatives\num and so there's not that balance\ni i think that a lot of the time we're\nwe're kind of\nuh using our friendships to kind of\ndownload our problems\nbut we're not actually listening when i\nwas training i was doing my internship\na clinical supervisor said you have two\nears in one mouth there's a reason for\nthat ratio\ni think we don't know how to listen and\nso sometimes uh\nwe feel like when someone's telling us\nsomething that we need to problem solve\nfor them\num we don't know just how to sit with\nthem and not fix it for them\nand we don't realize too that sometimes\nwe're helping\nthem by helping them to hear themselves\nmore clearly\nyes and if we talk for them if we talk\nover them they can't hear themselves\nwe're talking over their internal voice\nthat that last bit there at the end that\nyou just mentioned is so powerful we're\ntalking over their internal voice\nand actually simply listening to them\nallows them to hear themselves\nyes and ah you're so right i feel like\nmy best conversations are definitely\nwhen\ni i can find the narrative just by being\nable to share and share and share\nbecause\nmost of the time we share we we talk for\ntwo minutes the person giving the answer\ntalks for eight\nand it's almost like you know and now\nit's okay now do i take that answer they\ndon't quite understand me and then right\nit just kind of gets lost so\nhow do we shift is talking about our\nproblems useful\nwith who is it useful and and when is it\nuseful yeah i think you have to choose\nyour audience\nyeah i think so many times people have\nhad bad experiences let's say that\ngrowing up they had bad experiences and\nso\nthen they end up choosing someone who\nwill disappoint them\nand then they say see see what happens\nwhen i'm vulnerable see how that doesn't\nwork\num and and what happens is they they\ndon't realize that they're repeating\nthis pattern one thing that therapy\nreally does for people is it helps them\nto see\nyou are making choices that are\nare repeating that are helping you to\nrepeat a pattern that is making you\nunhappy\nthere's keeping you stuck and and people\ndon't realize that they're doing that\num there's a woman in the book who keeps\nhooking up with the wrong guys\nright um and including by the way one\nfrom the waiting room\ni don't mean in the waiting room it's\nnot that exciting but but she meets him\nin the waiting room and i know\nbecause of her pattern that you know\nthis is going to be a disaster\nand she keeps saying oh it's the guys\nit's this person it's that person\nand she doesn't realize that these\npeople are so much like\nthe people she grew up around um and i\ndon't mean that we're blaming people's\nparents because i think that\nmost parents did their absolute best you\nknow most parents\nreally want to be a good parent but\nsometimes they didn't know how or they\nwere very limited or there was some\nmental there was some mental health\nissues or whatever it might be\nand so they couldn't give their kids\nthat that\nmirroring experience that you know is\nsomething that they would want in an\nadult\nrelationship and so with her it takes\nher so long to realize that\nwhen she meets someone who is going to\ngive her what she wants she's like i'm\nnot attracted\nno chemistry right it's almost like like\nshe doesn't know how to be around\nsomeone who will give her what she wants\nand there's a there's a learning process\naround well wait a minute just because\nsomething feels familiar\nlike the person who disappoints you\ndoesn't mean it's right you know that\nchemistry that she kept feeling\nlike oh you feel familiar come closer\nyeah it's like no\nthe fact that you feel familiar should\nbe a sign like let's try something\ndifferent\nlet's go into this place of\nunfamiliarity and it will be\nuncomfortable because you don't know the\ncustoms in this country you haven't been\nto this country before\nyou're gonna have to use your guidebook\nand and learn your way around a little\nbit\nbut why don't you see what it's like\nover in that country\nright yeah yeah absolutely what is your\ntake on the elusive chemistry\nwhen people talk about it when they're\npartnerships and you know the way i've\nalways understood it is\ni've always felt that when you look at\nchemistry and compatibility\nchemistry is something that i can feel\nmultiple times a day with different\npeople\nyeah i can feel it with the barista i\ncan feel it with my personal trainer i\ncan feel it with\nsomeone i'm just taking the train home\nwith like chemistry is something i can\nfeel over and over again\ncompatibility is something i can't it's\nnot as easily replaceable\nit took longer to build and it's\nsomething that i have with less people\nin the world in general\nyeah uh and and so for me i've i always\nlook at chemistry as the elusive thing\nbecause i hear the same my friends will\ncome back from dates and be like jay\nlike but there was no chemistry and i'm\nlike\nokay so tell me about that and how\nyou've tackled helping people\nunderstand chemistry and and filter it\nbetter yeah\nso this is i i love that we're having\nthis conversation because this is\nsuch an important part of relationship\nso many times people will say\nyou know they went on a first date with\nsomebody and they're like yeah no i had\na really good time\nbut there was no chemistry and i said\nwell the having the really good time\nmight mean that there's potential for\nchemistry yes um but what they do is\nbecause they're on the apps and they say\noh well there's like 10 000 other people\nthat i can date\nand they just keep recycling and\nrecycling and recycling and they don't\ngive something time or space to grow and\nchemistry\nsometimes happens right away and other\ntimes\nit takes time to grow so um there are\nthese surveys that were done where\nwhere men and women were followed um for\n20 years\nfrom the moment that they went on a\nfirst date through marriages divorces\nyou know all these things\nand what happened was a lot of people\nhave revised their stories depending on\nwhat happened later so\nthe people who um are happily married\nlet's say\na lot of them said you know well tell us\nabout the first date when they're\ntelling it now they say\noh yeah there was instant chemistry but\nwhat they reported at the time was\nyeah i don't know maybe i'll go on a\nsecond date i don't know there's not a\nlot here but it built and so\ntheir story became there was instant\nchemistry right\nnow the people who were divorced\nsometimes they would say oh\ni knew i never liked this person from\nthe beginning and you at the time they\nreported oh my god we had this amazing\nchemistry\nright so it's not very reliable that\nfirst time is what i'm trying to say\nyeah um it takes time so you you go on a\nfirst date or a first meeting with\nsomebody\nand and you say did you did you have a\ngood time would you like to spend\nanother hour with this person\nand then see whether something develops\nsometimes it does\na lot of the times it does a lot of the\ntime it doesn't but you won't know until\nyou give it some breathing realm\ni should say too that you know there's a\nsaying that we marry our unfinished\nbusiness\nand what i mean by that is that a lot of\ntimes if you haven't worked through\nsome of these um ways of being in\nrelationship\nthat didn't work very well for you you\nseek them out in other people without\nrealizing it\nso the person will look very different\nlet's say from your mom or your dad or\nwhomever\nand yet um once you get to know that\nperson you're like oh god you know like\noh\nwait this this feels really like oh i\nrecognized that i didn't see that at all\nright so that's our unfinished business\nso you really gotta\nwork through your stuff so that you can\nmeet the person that you're gonna have\ntrue authentic chemistry with and not\nthis kind of like\nchaotic chemistry with yeah chaotic\nchemistry is a really nice way to put it\nbecause\nyeah that's often what it is it's like\neverything's chaotic but we feel\nchemistry it's\nyeah it's there well people say i have\nso much chemistry with this person even\nthough\ni can't rely on this person or i'm\nalways nervous i'm always on edge i\nnever know where i stand with this\nperson\nbut we have so much chemistry yeah\nyeah it's just and it's crazy how\ni i'd love to date back actually and i'm\ndoing some research on it right now i'd\nlove to hear if you already know it's\nsomething i'm\ni'm really interested in where that\ndesire for chemistry ever even\nsourced like where it started like that\none that we all have for wanting to feel\nchemistry like i wonder whether there's\na movie or\nbecause i remember the first time i\nwanted a girlfriend was because i\nwatched a movie\nyeah my favorite character like was\nattracted to this girl and i was like\noh maybe i should have a girlfriend like\ni didn't you know i was a kid and i\ndidn't even know what that meant\nyeah but it was just so cleverly planted\ninto my mind that i didn't feel complete\nwithout\na partner and and it's fascinating to me\nlook at where these things started\nbecause sometimes they're just\nthings that you've heard over and over\nagain in movies or books or\nsongs yeah i mean i think that we we\ndefine chemistry\nas sort of like this instant magical\nthing\num and chemistry is is so multifactorial\nit's about\nyou know what is this energy that goes\non between the two of you\nand and how are you together in daily\nlife\nnot like on the vacation in tahiti right\num so when people think about spending\ntheir lives with somebody it's about the\nday-to-day it's about how do we get\nthrough the hard things\nhow do we listen to each other how do we\ndeal with\num the places that we disagree how do we\ndeal with the differences between us\nbecause we think of chemistry as like\nthat overlap like we\nwe both love sushi and rollerblading in\nthis movie and that\nbook and you know and and we're vegan\nand you know whatever it is right\num and that's not chemistry yeah\nchemistry is\nhow do we inhabit the same space knowing\nthat we're two separate human beings and\nhow do we stay connected even with\nthe space between us um yeah absolutely\ni love that that's\nyeah that's really powerful tell me\nabout the uh\ntell me about dealing with the paradox\nof being perceived as someone who has\nall the answers\nbut also is knowingly trying to grow in\ntheir own life\nlike how does that paradox work for you\nyeah and it's like you know the\nperception not only of your clients now\nlike you know you're gonna have a tv\nshow about the book\nlike the book's been so incredibly\nsuccessful which is helping so many\npeople\nhow do you deal with that personally of\nthat feeling of\nyeah i do have answers and i do know how\nto help people obviously people are\nbeing helped\nyou are changing people's lives and at\nthe same time you're like yeah but i'm\nstill learning and i've still got to\nwork on this and i'm still working this\nhow do you deal with that paradox or how\ndo you yeah\nwell well that's interesting because so\nin the book i follow\nfour very different patients where i'm\ntheir therapist and then the fifth\npatient in the book is me\nyeah as i go through my own therapy with\nmy therapist\nand a lot of people say well why you\nknow are you insane\nyou know why why would you do that\nbefore before the book came out\ni think it's really smart well the\nreason i did it is because i really felt\nlike\nif my patients were going to be so\nvulnerable\ni felt it would be disingenuous to be\nthe expert up on high helping these\npeople when i was going through\nsomething in my own life\nand and we all struggle and and so i say\nat the very beginning of the book that\nmy greatest credential is that i'm a\ncard-carrying member of the human race\nand it was so important for me to\nshow how we're all more the same than we\nare different and i think that that\nmakes what people can learn from the\nbook so much more powerful and impactful\num\nwhat's interesting though is that even\nthough i was very sure that i wanted to\ndo that\nonce the book um so you know i was\nsupposed to be writing a different book\ni was supposed to be writing a book\nabout happiness\nand and it just felt so empty to me\nbecause i feel like happiness is a\nbyproduct of living our lives in a\nfulfilling way in a meaningful way is\nreally\nwhat we all hope for but happiness is\nthe goal in and of itself felt like a\nrecipe for disaster so i felt like it\nwas just\ni was i was a therapist and i was trying\nto write this book about happiness and\nit was making me depressed\nironically i called it the miserable\ndepression-inducing happiness book and\nso i ended up not writing that book\nand then i ended up writing this book\nand and i thought like maybe three\npeople would read it because everybody\nsaid oh you know nobody wants to\nnobody wants to read a book about\ntherapy it's not it's a book about the\nhuman condition\num and so once the book was turned in\nand the sales\nteam got it at the publisher and\neverybody started like passing the book\naround\nand i thought oh no maybe like because i\nthought like three people read it and\ni'm like maybe 300 will read it maybe 3\n000. i didn't realize like we're like 10\nmonths on the new york times list now\nand so well thank you i say that only in\nthe context of\num if i had known how many people were\ngoing to be reading it\ni think i would have hesitated to be so\nopen i let it rip i mean i\ni do not come off well i'm very just\nhere's what happened and i just let it\ngo um\nand so i'm really glad that i didn't\nclean myself up\nbecause i think that if i had yeah\npeople wouldn't have read i think that\nthe reason that people are responding to\nit and seeing themselves in these\nstories\nis because we're all so real in the book\nyou know\nnobody's cleaned up in the book yeah i\nagree i and i think that's beautiful and\ni i i do think that that message is so\nmuch stronger today as well and i'm\nreally glad that you didn't\nknow how successful the book was gonna\nbe it's great and\nit's funny though isn't it that we we\nfeel that sometimes like\nyou would and i'm glad you didn't and i\nknow you didn't too because\nyou're you're very happy sharing but it\nis weird that we think if\nthat many more people were going to see\nthis i wouldn't what is it about that is\nthat just\nmore chances and odds of people having\nissues with us or challenging us like\nwhat is that that stops us from being\nmore vulnerable the more people see us\nbecause i feel\nwhen you're not well known it's like you\nstrive to be well known and then when\nyou meet people who are well known\nthey're almost striving for more privacy\nyeah\nyou know it's like right i'm sure you\nsee that in your work all the time\ni do i think that um people are afraid i\nmean i think there's shame there you\nknow like that\nthat as a therapist um you know letting\npeople see me struggle\nyeah yeah and say you know here i i\nmean i do all the things with my\ntherapist that my patients do with me so\nso you see me like i want to be liked by\nhim and i google stock him one night and\nyou know i do all these things\num and it's embarrassing um\nyou know to because you think well\npeople will think less of me people will\nthink that i'm less competent or\num you know whatever you imagine and\nthat's not been the case at all yeah\nyou know i think that people have said i\nyou know i i i really\ni really value what you shared\num i really respect you i admire you for\nthat and and i think that that\ntranslates to people out in the world\nbeing more open with each other because\nthe title of the book maybe you should\ntalk to someone doesn't mean we should\nall go to therapy\nnecessarily it means we all need to talk\nmore to each other\nand so the more that i can model that\nfor people if i can't\nyou know walk the talk if i can't do\nwhat i'm asking people to do\nthen there's a big gap yes but if i\nactually do it i think it\nhelps people to say oh well if she can\ndo it yeah then i can do it too\nabsolutely absolutely and what have you\nseen are those patterns of\nclients that you find that you're\nworking with that have seen the biggest\ntransformations in their life\nare there patterns in those people that\nthey have certain shared beliefs values\nwork ethic\nhabits that that help them take whatever\nadvice you gave or other therapists have\ngiven them that have actually changed\nlike what has been that\nkind of x factor that people have shared\num\ni think that what happens is they\nrelease the story that they came in with\nand and sometimes it's these stories of\nyou know um\nthere's the content of what they're\nsaying like here's what's going on\nin my relationship here's what's going\non uh with my anxiety\num and they have a story about it so\nthey think that the content is the story\nbut what i'm listening for is sort of\nthe music under the lyrics so\nthe lyrics are you know i'm having panic\nattacks\nthe music is what is the underlying\nstruggle or pattern that is getting you\ninto this situation\nand once they can see that that can\ntranslate into\neverything that happens in their daily\nlives but i think it takes courage\ni think it takes so much courage for\nthem to say i'm going to make changes\ni always like to say that insight is the\nbooby prize of therapy\nthat you can have all the insight in the\nworld you can say now i understand\nwhy i'm struggling in this way now i\nunderstand why i have these arguments\nwith my partner\nand i'll say well did you do something\ndifferent yeah and they'll say well no\nbut now i understand it\nwell you're not really doing the work\nbecause you have to do something\ndifferent\nand i love this viktor frankl quote\nthat's in the book\nwhere he had written between stimulus\nand response there is a space\nin that space is the power to choose our\nresponse\nin our response it lies our growth and\nour freedom\nso yes there might be difficult people\nbut then the question is what is our\nrole in that so\nwhy are we in that relationship or what\nis our role in making that relationship\nso chaotic so difficult so\num there's so much tension in it why is\nthat\nso what what is it that that we can do\nnext time that person does that thing\nthat triggers us\ncan we have a different response because\nthe response we keep giving\nis yielding the same thing nothing's\nchanging so when we talk about insight\nas the booby prize of therapy\nit's not just having the insight it's\nyou have to make changes\nand you have to look that means that you\ncan make changes you're not going to\nchange the other person\nbut your changes can influence another\nperson so it's always like doing a dance\nright\nand so if you change your dance steps\nthat person either has to change their\ndance steps too\nor they will fall flat on the floor or\nthey can leave the dance floor yeah\nbut the good thing is you changed your\ndance steps\nand that's the thing when you say what\nis the unifying thing that all of them\nhave in common\nwhen they've made changes that have\nreally really transformed their lives\nit's about they they chose different\ndance steps\nyeah that's great advice and i love that\nanalogy of the dance steps\ni can visualize it perfectly yeah it\nmakes so much sense and\ni think one of the things that i hear in\nthat regard that a lot of people i talk\nto and\nand i'm i'm getting to get you to give\nthem advice which is fantastic\nand they all listen to the podcast also\nis is the feeling of like\ni know what i need to do to change but\ni'm only going to do it for a few days\nand if that person doesn't change their\ndance steps back in line with me\nright now yeah i cave or i let go and\nsometimes it's\ngenuine and sometimes it's not genuine\nsometimes it's like well if they don't\nchange i'm not gonna change but\nfor a lot of friends it's like i'm gonna\nchange and i'm gonna be the best husband\nin the world\nfor three months but if you know but she\nnever changes\nokay so here's the thing you're not\nchanging for them you're changing for\nyou 100\nand so if you stop\nchanging in positive ways for yourself\nyou're letting yourself down\nso you're not doing it to get a response\nfrom the other person if you get a\ndifferent response from the other person\nthat's great amazing\nbut you're doing it to get a different\nresponse from yourself you're doing it\nso that\nyou are making choices that align\nwith how you want to be in the world and\nwhen you make choices that align with\nhow you want to be in the world\nyou will be putting a different energy\nout there\nthat maybe somebody will that will\ninfluence somebody potentially but it\nwill certainly influence you\nand the choices that you make so\nyou don't make a change and it's not a\ncontest you know it's not a contest of\nlike if i change\nyou need to change or you need to change\nfirst i see this with couples a lot like\nlike i'll only change when you change\nand it's a fight\nit's a historical fight that they have\nwith with from their childhood like\ni'll only change mom and dad when you\nbecome the parent\nthat i needed you to be back then but\nyou're an adult now it's like wearing\nclothes that no longer fit you\ntotally um and you're still like trying\nto get those clothes like take off those\nclothes\nyou're free there's this analogy in the\nbook that i love that my therapist used\nwith me he said\nyou remind me of a cartoon and it's of a\nprisoner shaking the bars desperately\ntrying to get out\nbut on the right and the left the bars\nare open no\nbars yeah right and i was like whoa i am\nmy own jailer\nyeah we sometimes are our own jailers we\nthink we're so trapped by everyone and\neverything else but\nwe are the ones who are keeping\nourselves imprisoned\ni just did a ted talk about this and it\nwas it was about the idea that\nthat we know on some level that the bars\nare open but we don't want to step\noutside because if we step outside we\nwill have to change\nand when we change that means we have to\ntake responsibility for our lives\nand sometimes we would rather blame\neverything that's going wrong\non somebody else yeah you know if i take\nresponsibility for my life then i'm also\nresponsible for what doesn't work i\ncan't blame\nmy bad mood my bad day my bad\ncircumstance my not taking risks\non this other person i have to be\naccountable\nto myself for that um and how about when\npeople take that accountability\nbut instead of turning into action they\nturn it into anger\non themselves right and i feel that's\nhalf of what scares people like it's\neasier to blame everyone else and\neverything else going wrong\nbecause then i at least don't hate\nmyself\nyeah but it's like when you take it\ninward and sometimes i can launch you\ninto action like i\nwas literally sharing that with a friend\nyesterday i was saying that there was a\ntime in my life where i could have sat\naround and blamed the people around me\nwhere i knew that i had to be\naccountable and take action in my life\nand own it and i was like this is my\nlife\nif i'm going to blame them i'm going to\nbe sad so it shifted me into action but\nwe find also that it can shift people\ninto anger\nhow do you stop someone from from\ngetting into that space\nwhere now they see all is their fault\nand now it's like they're just a bad\nperson\nand it starts becoming very negative for\nthem right self-talk well i would say\ntwo things one\nis that we really talk a lot about\nself-compassion\nbecause self-compassion um\nhelps you see how complicated human\nbeings are\nit helps you see that i am yes i'm these\nthings and i'm also these things\nand both can um i'm growing here and i'm\nlearning here and i made this\nregrettable choice here\nbut i'm gonna learn from it and and\nself-compassion breeds compassion for\nothers\nso then we're more compassionate out in\nthe world because we see the\ncomplexities of other people too\nabsolutely\nso i think that that when we can instead\nof turning that you know the\nresponsibility into anger you can say\ni'm going to be really kind to myself\nbecause no growth can happen without\ncompassion\nand no growth can happen without\nvulnerability and you can't truly be\nvulnerable\nif you're not going to be compassionate\nbecause you'll you'll have too much of\nthat anger yeah\ncoloring it um so i think that that's\npart of it\nand i think the other thing too is to\nremember that um\npunishing yourself with anger is\nuh is going to distract you from\nsomething that we all have to face and\nthis is going to sound like a\nnon-sequitur but it's not\nwhich is that we're all going to die\nokay life has 100\nmortality rate and that's not just for\nother people and so\ni think that sometimes we spend so much\ntime in the anger because we don't want\nto think about\ni really do have a limited time here and\nwe get so scared we say oh my god what\nam i going to do i have to make my life\nworthwhile and i have to do all these\nthings that i want to do\nand we get so scared of not being able\nto accomplish those things\nthat we'd rather sit in the anger so we\ndon't have to think about it\nabsolutely um so i really want people to\nbe aware of\nthere's this saying that i love which is\ntime is the coin of life\nspend it well you're not spending it\nwell when you're angry either at\nyourself or at other people\nyou know angers there's a thing called\nthe anger iceberg right and so it's like\nthis if you can imagine this image of\nlike the iceberg and here's sort of the\nwater line right\nand so anger is on top but underneath\nour more vulnerable feelings\nright sadness anxiety\num regret you know whatever it might be\nang is just to disguise it is it's just\nthe front-facing experience of that\nyeah we're so afraid of of all of our\nemotions even the good ones we're afraid\nof joy there's\nthere's a word cherophobia which is it's\nan actual thing it's\nit's fear of of joy and there are people\nwho maybe\nwhen they were growing up uh whenever\nthey felt like good for a moment the\nother shoe would drop\nyou know something bad would happen and\nso they got very uncomfortable because\njoy for them\nwas almost like anticipatory pain\nlike it won't last yeah so i'd rather\nnever experience joy than to know that\nit's going to go away that was their\nmindset\nit's too painful when i get my hopes up\nand i think everything's going to be\nokay\nand then boom it goes away right and so\nthere are a lot of people who they put\nall these obstacles in the way of their\njoy\nso that they don't have to feel joy\nbecause joy is too painful for them\nyes absolutely it's so true and it's\nlike while you're in joy you're only\nthinking about when is this when it's\ngoing to end\nand when you're in pain you think about\nwhen is this going to end and that\nmindset\ncontinues and that same mindset applies\nto both right enjoy you thinking when is\nthis going to end and then in pain when\nis this going to end\nright and people are afraid of their\npain too and and\ni think there's a difference between\npain and suffering\nso so pain is we all feel pain because\nif you're human you're going to\nexperience pain\nbut suffering is the ways that we\nexacerbate the pain\nright so suffering is i'm gonna google\nstock my boyfriend\ni'm gonna ruminate on this mistake that\ni made and make myself feel really bad\nabout this thing that happened um you\nknow that's suffering so\nso we we we don't cause our own pain but\nwe do cause our own suffering\nyeah i think it's fascinating how\nwe create suffering right we create the\nsuffering there\nwhat's that statement about how pain is\nguaranteed but suffering is optional\nright and it's something like that it's\nlike that's the choice that we get to\nmake and\none of one of the things i really want\nto dive into that with you is\nuh loss which we were just mentioning\nabout in the break quickly there\nand and grief that people experience and\ni know for\nlong parts of my life i personally\nreally\nstruggled with knowing how to deal with\npeople who'd lost someone\nfor a longer for great am i i think i'm\na lot better now but\nit was something i genuinely had to work\non and it's funny because i feel like\nyou just expected to know how to deal\nwith this stuff\nright like there's no like you're\nexpected to know how to deal with grief\nyou're expecting to know how to deal\nwith\nbreakups and not just for yourself but\nfor other people in your life yes\nand in the chapter you have a chapter\nwhere you're talking about john the the\ncharacter yeah\ntell us about that experience of uh\ndealing with grief and and how to\nsupport someone you love\nyeah through grief yeah so you know i\nthink there's a lot of loss\nin our lives in general but we don't we\nwe minimize\nthe loss so there are the kind of these\nsilent losses just before i get into\njohn there's this\nidea about you know it was a breakup but\nnot a divorce so in three weeks you'll\nbe over it\nyou know and it's kind of like and so so\nwe we don't know how to support our\nfriends\nif they're really experiencing the grief\nof the end of\na relationship that where it wasn't as\ntangible because you know it's not a\ndivorce\nyeah or you know we see that with you\nknow somebody had a miscarriage but they\ndidn't lose their eight-year-old child\nand then people don't talk about the\nmiscarriage and they're so alone in the\nexperience\nthese are these silent losses because\npeople feel like well\ni can't really you know even just being\nsingle\nokay so a lot of times people talk about\nambiguous grief\nambiguous grief is the grief of being\nsingle because\nyou don't know when and if you're going\nto meet someone so\nyou're always dealing with the loss of\nnot having a partner\nand it never ends um in the sense of you\ncan't say okay that person's dead now\nyeah not that person not that that ends\nlet me be clear\nwhat i mean by that is when somebody\ndies you are going through that\nexperience\nof what it what they meant to you in\ntheir life and they live on with you in\na certain way and you love\nthat person um here you haven't met that\nperson yet you don't even know who the\nperson is\nso you're you're grieving for the person\nyou have not yet met\nand people don't understand the grief of\nsomebody who really wants to be with\nsomebody\num you know when people will make all\nkinds of comments oh\nyeah you'll meet someone or you know\nlike oh you have such a great life\nand they don't want to acknowledge that\nyes that might be true\nyes and yes and this other thing exists\nthis ambiguous grief of will i ever meet\nthis person where is that person\ni'm longing for this person that i don't\neven know what that person looks like or\nwhat their name is yeah\nright um so i think that we need to\nlearn how to deal with\nloss and how to support people in loss\num in the book we have\nloss in in the sense of um you know even\njust\nlosing the hope for a better childhood\nright so charlotte the woman who keeps\nhooking up with the wrong guys\nwhat helps her move forward is that in\norder to\num in order to move into adulthood\nshe has to let go of the hope for having\nhad a better childhood yeah\num if you let go of that you can move\ninto adulthood and hold that grief\nand and and that's when things open up\nfor you so there's all kinds of grief\nthat every single person experiences\num in the book we have you know loss of\na child we have\nloss of this young woman goes on her\nhoneymoon and she's in her 30s and she\ncomes back and she has cancer and\neventually it turns out to be terminal\ncancer and how do you deal with you have\none year\nthey say you have like a year to ten\nyears to live right and so people would\nsay all these things like\nhave you gotten a second opinion you\nknow like they don't they don't know how\nto sit with her in the reality of her\ndiagnosis\num you know they'll say things like well\nmy cousin took vitamin this and it were\nyou know\nas opposed to just this sucks or i love\nyou so much\nso there's a there's a chapter in the\nbook called what not to say to a dying\nperson because she wanted to write a\nbook about all the things that\nwell-meaning people who loved her said\nbut they're so uncomfortable with\ntalking about the truth of the loss yeah\nright\nso if somebody is experiencing a loss i\nhope that we can talk about the truth of\nthe loss with them and not\ntry to distract them from that yeah um\nbecause that's what's really going to\nhelp them\nyeah i love that it's such that's the\nbest advice i've ever heard and lost\nfor sure because yeah everything's a\ndistraction\nwe're always trying to distract people\nfrom their pain and it's our discomfort\nyeah i mean that's kind of a reflection\nright we say oh i don't want to make\nthem uncomfortable\nyou're actually making them\nuncomfortable by not speaking about\nwhat's there in plain sight\nso this thing is there in plain sight\nsitting between you\nand you're not talking about that you're\nmaking them uncomfortable and\nthey feel like then oh i feel so unseen\nright now because you are trying to make\nyourself\nmore comfortable in talking to me and\ni'm not in this equation at all and yet\nyou're trying to comfort me\nabsolutely yeah i i mean i can\ndefinitely think of\nthere are literally people's faces\nflashing in front of me right now that\nwhen you're saying that i'm like yeah\nthat's exactly what they wanted to talk\nabout that's exactly why right\nwell they wanted to do but either i was\ntoo scared to go there or if it was me\npeople were too scared to go there or\nwhichever way it was and\nyeah it was just because it's a little\nbit like apologies you know like who is\nthe apology for\nright are you apologizing because you\nreally feel\nuh you regret that that happened and you\nfeel sorry or you're apologizing because\nit will make the other person feel\nbetter\nand i think that the more that we can\nhave an authentic\ndialogue and go to the hard places\num both people end up feeling seen and\nheard\nabsolutely yeah and that's that's the\nhope that i'm hoping everyone who\nlistens and watches this conversation is\njust\nand and reads the book 100 like i really\nhope everyone is listening and watching\ntoday\nreads the book because i feel like it's\nit's exactly that it's these subtle\ninsights these these it's\nit's life's all lived in these moments\nthese transition moments these pain\nmoments these\ntragedy like these moments and and they\ndefine our relationships they define how\nmuch we trust others they define\nwho we feel loved by and who feel close\nto and who we feel far from\nlike for example when you when you when\nyou just want to go to the park on a\nsunny day and someone doesn't want to go\nyou don't feel offended by that like it\ndoesn't affect your relationship\nbut it's like when you're going through\nsomething really painful and someone\ndoesn't know how to process that\nthat feels like it can make or break a\nrelationship often\nand i see that with people deciding who\nthey love\nby how they feel that person treats them\nwhen they're going through something\ndifficult\nthat's right and that's why that's why\ngoing back to what i said earlier about\nchoose your audience\nthat you know you want to make sure that\nthe person that you're opening up to\nis the right person yeah absolutely\ntwo more questions before i ask you the\nfinal set of rounds so\ntwo questions that i want to end on\nbefore we go into the rapid fire rounds\nare um how do we\nbe a good friend to others i know it's a\nvery\nopen question but i want to leave that\nopen so that you can answer it\nhow is what is the best way to be a good\nfriend for someone else and the second\nquestion\nhow do we allow our friends to be the\nbest for us\nbecause i think that's the part that we\ndon't hear often enough\nis how can we help other people help us\nbetter\nyes yes we can be a good friend to\nothers by learning to speak their\nlanguage\nso i do that as a therapist all the time\njust because\nsomebody this person comes in with\nsomething that's similar to what the\nother person came in with\nthey're unique individuals and you have\nto learn to speak someone's language so\noften we try to take our language\nand push it onto them yeah and it\ndoesn't work\nright so being a good friend means i'm i\ncare enough about you to learn your\nlanguage\nand how can we help someone be a good\nfriend to us\nis to be open to\nthe differences between us we need to\nlet those differences be a part of our\nfriendship to enhance our friendship\num i think so many people are so worried\nabout uh\nyou know bringing those differences into\nthe friendship they think there's going\nto be a rift here i believe this and you\nbelieve this and we have different ideas\nabout this\nthat's okay absolutely that's amazing\nbeautiful answers thank you so much for\nfor sharing those so we have our fill in\nthe blanks oh my god\nand rapid fire rounds these fill in the\nblanks is a new segment that we've\nstarted this year\nsince the one-year anniversary of the\npodcast so i share sentences and you\nfill in the blanks\nso therapy doesn't mean\noh no okay wait a second i know you can\nthink about it\nokay um an instant fix okay good\nokay humans are innately ridiculous\nokay shame and guilt are toxic\nchange your narrative changing your\nnarrative allows\npossibility suppressing your feelings\nonly\nmakes you sick we suffer unnecessarily\nwhen\nwe get scared being vulnerable and\ntransparent\ncan transform us\nthe only way to achieve true connection\nis\nby being courageous okay wonderful\nbeautiful that was great\nfantastic okay that was very good we\noften get people who want to go off on a\ntangent you did not do that i appreciate\nit\nsticking within the room yeah it's very\ngood okay so these are rapid fire now\nfinal five\nwhich is one word to one sentence\nmaximum\nokay there are very few people that\nstick to it but i i have\ndeep respect for anyone i wasn't\nsweating before i know i know\nokay fine all right here we go uh let's\ngo\ni've got a selection here that i can't\nwait to choose so what question do you\nwish people would ask you more often\nhow do you feel really interesting\nhow do you feel right i'm gonna start\nthe trend right now i feel i feel very\njoyful\nyou're very kind i appreciate that\nthat's cool that's interesting\ni'm going to go for a tangent okay cause\ni have so much to say about that yeah\nlet's go okay so let's do it yeah\ni i thought we needed to too how\ni feel like people don't ask that when\nthey do ask that they're expecting you\nto say okay\ngood bad like you know it's like we give\nsuch bad answers to that question\nlike when someone gives me an\ninteresting answer to that question i'm\nalmost more alert\nyes yes yes so it's not so it's it's\ni don't mean how do you feel like oh hey\nhow you doing\num i mean i actually want people to be\ncurious\num and so i think people are so curious\nabout like what's going on how's that\nproject going what's going on\nyou know it's sort of like all this like\ncontent level things right\ni want to get in the process with people\nin the right context yeah of course so\nyou know i\ni think that sometimes we forget to ask\nthe people that we care about\nhow they feel i love that i think that's\nreally cool yeah i misunderstood it when\nyou said it the first time so i'm glad\ninstead of like you know\nhow was your how are you feeling\nyeah and it's hard to ask that and\nanswer that yeah because when you ask\nthat you've got to be really\nready to listen and receive yes and and\nthe person who's going to answer is\ngoing to have to\ntry to not give you the two minute\nanswers uh well also a lot of times when\npeople ask that it's\nthey have an acceptable range of answers\num you know you can feel the ways that\nare acceptable to\nme um which is very different from\nyou know they might throw you a\ncurveball and those curveballs are where\nyour relationship deepens\nyeah absolutely all right question\nnumber three when was the last time you\nfelt\nheard and understood and not in a\ntherapy session\nright here oh thank you it's very kind\nall right\nuh question number four i'm i wanna uh\nyou're too good at this so i need to try\nand find something that\nno i mean i want you to be good at it\nbut okay this one i really like\nif you could create a law that everyone\nhad to follow in the world what would it\nbe\nkindness and what would that practice be\nlike if you had to simplify kindness\ninto that one habit or one practice or\none thing that everyone had to do every\nday is the law what would it be\nuh before you speak ask yourself how\nwill\nthis land on the other person hmm\nit's a great rule yeah you would change\neverything yeah\nyou probably wouldn't say much i think\nyou would you think you would\ni think you would i think that we know\nhow to be kind\ni think that you know all of these\nobstacles get in the way\nbut i think that when we take away you\nknow all of the noise in our heads\nand there's so much noise uh we innately\nknow how to be kind\nyou know is it is it kind is it true and\nis it helpful if it meets those three\ncriteria\nthen go ahead and say it right and once\nyou practice that you don't\nyou don't need to premeditate so much\nyou will you will\norganically start to just speak that way\nto other\npeople yeah absolutely and in the\nbhagavad-gita the book from india it's\ncalled um\nthe four austerities of speech so it's\nis it true\nis it beneficial to all this is my\nfavorite one\ncan it be said in a way that doesn't\nagitate the mind of others\noh right like you know it's like that\nthat delivery point of like how can you\nsay it in a way that isn't gonna agitate\nsomeone's mind and then the fourth one\nis\nis it based on spiritual text and\nfoundational text okay fifth and final\nquestion for you what is the biggest\nlesson you've learned in the last 12\nmonths\num that people\nreally want to be open\nand i i think that i knew that as a\ntherapist\nbut i didn't realize you know i thought\nwell maybe in these little clusters of\npeople who go to therapy those are the\npeople who want to be open\neverybody wants to tell their story and\neverybody has a story\npeople think oh well my story isn't that\ninteresting or my story is kind of\nboring no\npeople's stories are fascinating and\ni've gone all over the country in the\nlast what since last april when the book\ncame out\nand i people are telling their stories\nand every single one is fascinating and\nand they are realizing\nthat their story has value yeah and\noften those\nsilent or unheard stories are the\nstories that are more interesting\nyes we were just talking about that now\nlike i know people that are just in my\nvicinity they're fascinating lives and\nstories that may never become a movie or\nit may never become a book but\nthey're just fascinating stories of\nresilience and human connection and\nbreakthrough power and all the rest of\nit and so and i think we\nlearn so much from other people's\nstories and that's why in the book so\nmany people\nhave said oh i i learned a lot about\nmyself even though they're not in the\nbook\nbecause it's so different if i say to\nyou jay if i say you know you're like\nthis or you do this you'd say well no\ni'm not i don't do that right that's our\nresponse\nbut if you see someone else do it you\ncan say oh i'm kind of like that\ni do that sometimes totally um it's it's\nvery non-threatening to see yourself in\nother people's stories which is why i\nthink we all need to be sharing our\nstories more\nabsolutely i agree and thank you for\nencouraging people to do that laurie\nyou're amazing everyone this\nis laurie gottlieb may be you should\ntalk to someone go\nand
