    "transcript": "it's worse it's an excuse yes at its\nbest it's a lack of perspective\nthe reality is you could never do that\nfor that person\non the flip side if you're like please\njust\npay attention to who's giving the advice\npeople say things to me all the time\nlike you've never built a business\nhello everyone welcome back to on\npurpose\ni'm so grateful that you're a part of\nthis community i'm so grateful that you\nkeep committing\nto your growth your development and your\nlearning and today's guest doesn't\nreally need an introduction\ni know that you're all aware watching\nhis content everywhere from facebook to\ninstagram to youtube\nand many other platforms linkedin\nincluded but today i love the fact\nthat we're not watching a keynote we're\nnot watching a q a\nwe're not watching a one minute or three\nminute ig tv clip\nwe're getting a moment to dive in on\npurpose\nwith the one and only gary vee serial\nentrepreneur\ninvestor five times new york times\nbest-selling author\nand the founder of vaynermedia and\nvaynerx gary thank you for being here\nman thank you brother well actually i'm\nin your office so\nit's all family i appreciate man thank\nyou so much for doing this no thank you\nso much\non everything on this thank you man\nreally well thank you i've really been\nlooking forward to this\nbecause i've been in this office a few\ntimes yes and those meetings with you\nhave always been memorable\nthank you and i say this to everyone\nwhen i'm thinking about being an\nentrepreneur\nwhen i'm thinking about working hard the\nperson the content i switch on to is\nyours i appreciate that so for me your\ncontent has been really powerful for me\nthank you and i don't think many people\nknew this when i first came in and\ninterviewed for crushing it which was so\nmuch fun\nbut that for me i when i hear you speak\ni feel\nvery aligned with a lot of it and\nactually it's helped me gain\nconscious competence on what i already\ndo so i think a lot of us have\nunconscious competence we're doing stuff\nright but we don't even know we're doing\nit right yes and then when i listen to\nhim like oh i do that\nokay i'm doing it right and that's been\na really nice reaffirming belief man\nyou know it's funny to hear you say that\ni do that for myself\nyes i'm such an intuitive executor yes\nthat i live through life where i go wait\na minute\ni'm doing this and then i'm almost doing\nit for myself\nwhich is why i think it's easy for me to\ndo it for others\nyes a lot of you know it's even what me\njust saying that out loud made me\nrealize\nhuh that's similar to the things i talk\nabout i am\nso uncomfortable to talk about anything\nthat i haven't lived\nit's easy to share my opinions and\nthoughts and aspirations\nbecause they're completely predicated on\nactually doing it\nnot on hypothesis or ideology\nor things i've heard from others it's a\nvery safe place\nabsolutely yeah and this is yeah i\ntotally agree it's one of the reasons\nwhy i don't have any advice on parenting\nlike i always get advice asked questions\non parenting when i'm on panels or\nwhatever and i'm like i'm not a parent\nyet\nso my opinions are there i'd love to ask\nyou a question it's funny\ni've been that way for a long time and\nthen i started thinking about the great\ncoaches\nyou know there's some there's some\nall-time great athletic coaches who've\nnever played the sport\nand i always think about that which is\nyou know i\nam now a parent but i can tell you that\na lot of my\nopinions on parenting have become\ntrue because i was actually able to\nsynthesize it from the perspective of\nthe child\nsure so i've been parented yes which\ngives me quite a bit\nabsolutely perspective and that's\nsomething you may want to you know i\nalso intuitively through our you know\ncouple our business meetings and some of\nour dinners\nlike i do think naturally we do a line\nin a lot of ways\nthough we manifest our energies hourly\ndifferently\ni think that um one thing for you to\ndebate is what\nin the way that you were parented has\ncreated you\nand what does that then mean is i think\nthat i think that's something we need to\ni actually think that i am\nconsumer-centric\nwhich is why i'm a great salesperson i\ndon't think about me trying to sell\nthis basketball card i think about why\nwould jason want this basketball card\ni actually think that most of my\nparenting hot takes\ncome from the perspective of the child\nnot the parent\nit's being the consumer of instead of\nthe\npontificator of so i don't know i\nactually think that\nchildren should be speaking more as we\nget older as a 44 year old\nour parenting advice should be\npredicated on tapping into who we were\nas children\nnot who were parenting today because a\nlot of the shortcomings of parenting\nis the opinions of other parents and\nteachers\nnot staying in a silo but when you think\nof yourself as a child\nyou can only take the context of what\nyour parents did in your perception at\nthis point\nright wrong or indifferent yeah i like\nthat no i agree and i think it's a part\nof it is just\nand i think you match this and that's\nwhat i'm trying to do is if i am\nadvising on something\nthat i haven't done yet it's balanced\nwith humility\nright like it's coming from a place of\nyou're you're\nmore obvious with your humility than i\nam one of the reasons 25\nof people or whatever the number is at\nfirst struggle with me or as you've\nnavigated through life\nmaybe you've been surprised at times\nlike oh you don't like gary it's because\nmy your energy as a communicator the\nhumility is extremely obvious and that's\nwhy the audience loves you so much\nironically humility is why my audience\nloves me so much\nexcept there's a veneer of a competitive\nalpha\na cursing jersey kid that doesn't\nnecessarily immediately become obvious\nyes which allows\na certain amount of judgment and and not\nmisunderstanding because i am who i am\nand so i don't judge others\nfor that but yes i think that people see\nmy humility ten\nif they dig in a little bit yeah you are\nmuch more obvious though it is\nabsolutely\nour connective tissue on palpableness\nyeah um that yes we do have some natural\ntalents and life experiences\nbut there is an inherent understanding\nuh that we share on that i'm absolutely\nconvinced that my humility\nis a deep foundational uh\naspect to my success and i do not\nbelieve that most people actually see\nthat at first with me\nyeah and a lot of people would just say\nthat when you're saying that about\nyourself it's like\noh well yeah it's easy to say but you're\nright someone needs to dig in\nright you need to dig in you need to get\nstuck into someone's life to really know\nwhat they're for and when you ask me\nabout that parenting point\nthe first thing that came to my mind is\nmy parents never really\ngot excited about metrics or\nachievements for me and i loved that\nbecause it pushed me further so we\ndidn't really celebrate\nevery win like if i got a first class\ndegree which i did my parents weren't\nlike\nshouting out the rooftops of it it was\nlike well what's next that's you and so\nfor me my mindset's always in a healthy\nway in a healthy way not in like\nno but it's important the reason i\njumped in is yeah you know like i even\ngot goosebumps\nlike i can hear a lot of people now\nhearing that and saying oh that's a lot\nof [ __ ] pressure\nyeah like i don't smell the roses either\ni've never celebrated [ __ ]\nin a healthy way it doesn't it it's like\nthis balancing act of like\nthat's awesome but i'm not gonna let\nthat achievement make me be a dick face\nat the same token if i never achieve\nanother thing that's okay\nit's the opportunity to try to achieve\nthe next thing\nyes that is exciting not the judgment of\nif i do\nfrom others absolutely absolutely and i\nthink we have that challenge where\nyou either get cocky or complacent right\nwhen something goes\nwell you kind of go either way and it's\nlike you either let compliments get to\nyour head or you let criticism get to\nyour heart and i feel like if you're\nreally good at letting compliments get\nto your head\nyou're more likely to let criticism get\nto your heart you know it's the same\nthing i always say which is like i can't\nhear anything right i don't hear the\nboos i don't hear the cheers\ni talk a lot about why people aren't\ncapable of producing content to the\nworld\nwhich is now the requirement as a human\nto achieve happiness i genuinely believe\nthat i believe taking advantage of\nall of our abilities to reach out to the\nworld through these new channels\nwith no friction is an enormous gift an\nopportunity\nthe reason most can't achieve it is\nbecause they're unable to take back the\ninevitable feedback that immediately\ncomes with the opportunity\nto your point i genuinely believe the\nreason i can take the feedback\nis because when i go into my instagram\npost that i just posted\nliterally in back-to-back content\ncomments excuse me\none will say that i'm walking on water\nand the next will say that i'm a snake\noil salesman charlotte\nand the fact that neither penetrate my\npsyche\nis absolutely where i'm at um absolutely\nand that's equanimity right like that is\nthat\nwhatever you want to call it it's the\ngame because people want the positive\nreinforcement that uh\nyou know there's so many models on\ninstagram right men and women you're so\nbeautiful you look so great you're so\nbeautiful you look so great\nyou're full of [ __ ] you look fake\nthey're crushed because they take too\nmuch\nand that you look so great yes and i\nthink and i think that's the point that\nwe're hitting on here which i love\nis that that over emphasis on positive\nit's what makes the negative so hard to\ntake\nit's also an incredible place for me to\nadd some clarity that i haven't done a\ngood job on\nhistorically which is something i'm\nthinking a lot more about raghav it's\nfun to see you here because we had this\ncall yesterday i'm like look\ni'm at my worst when i'm excited in an\ninterview\nand i'm and i'm drilling a headline\nbecause i love doing it it's fun it's\nshowmanship it's wrestling\npromo videos it's my natural state you\nknow i talk a lot about\nnot giving a [ __ ] about other people's\nopinions\nit's also because i take the complete\nopposite approach which is every\nnegative piece of feedback that i get\ni genuinely go into two places a i\ndeploy\nsympathy and empathy for the person\nleaving the comment because inevitably\nimmediately on that action i know that\nthey're not in a good place\nif you go to somebody else's social\nconsume it\nand then spew hate you're not in a [ __ ]\nyou're not in a good place\nyou're unhappy yeah next i start trying\nto see the insight to any truth in it\nyou know the second that you're high on\nyour own supply you're vulnerable yes\nand so i don't i don't give a [ __ ] about\nanybody's opinion\nironically i value everybody's opinion\ni just synthesize it and then decide to\ntake the good from it\nyes by deploying empathy and sympathy\nto the deliverable i'm stunned by our\nlack of conversation in society right\nnow on this part\nthere's a lot of judgment and hot takes\nand comments\nwe need to judge the person delivering\nthe message absolutely\nlike like how is your mother's opinion\nof you\nhave the same weight as anonymous 54's\ncomment on instagram\nyeah that is ludicrous yeah absolutely\nin the same way of\nhow does a co-worker's opinion you have\nto factor that in different than your\nmother because your mother blindly\nthinks you're the best\nif you're lucky enough to have that\nmother you know and so\nit's super fast it's it's just pulling\nfrom opposite directions and i think\nyou know i'm pulling so hard\nfrom opposite directions that my balance\nis coming in that\nyeah no i get that and i love breaking\nthat down into what i call the four c's\nof trust it's like what are you trusting\nor judging people of competence\ncare character or consistency right\nthese are the four things that\nyou can judge someone off like you're\njudging someone off their competency but\ndon't remember that person may be\ncompetent they may not care about\nyour questions yeah sure your opinions\nyeah so i hear that\nwhich makes a lot of sense to me it was\nfunny where my heart went\nand my brain i am stunned\nby how almost binary my judgment\nis completely predicated on intent\nif you if i believe your intent\nwas to be there for me but your actions\nwere not that you were consistent\ni'm completely unbothered and i don't\nknow what that means\nbut i'm super [ __ ] grateful that i\nhave it yeah but that's an art and a\nskill that you have\nand i'd like to think i have the same\nwhere i'm i'm able to do that too i'm\nable to let go\nwhat is the what is the concept of not\nhaving expectations\nfrom your perspective because i would\ntell you that that may be my great\nsuperpower yeah you know somebody said\nto me tom bell you on my podcast said to\nme gary your superpower is your ability\nnot to judge yourself\nand i've been saying it a lot and then\nliterally on a flight this week i was\nlike\nright because i don't judge others yes\nlike i'm able to not judge myself\nbecause i don't judge others a lot of\npeople who are like\na lot of right so tell me i don't know\ni'm so powerful no i love that that's\nsuch a great point\nhow do you that's such a great point no\nyou're spot on because the reason why\nwe have we judge others it's because we\njudge ourselves right the opposite of\nwhat you're saying\nand so for me it's the same thing the\nreason why i don't expect is because i\nsee everything as my responsibility\ni see everything as my work yes and i\nsee everything else as a bonus\nlike it's just amazing that anyone even\ncares about me\nor has time for me or makes an effort to\ndo something or connect with someone\nwhatever it is and that's just a\nbeautiful bonus of life\nbut i've got to be in charge of it and i\nthink that just came from many years\nof having expectations i think that came\nfrom times when i did expect\nand i didn't get and i realized i don't\nwant to feel this way anymore\ninteresting like i don't want to\nexperience this anymore this doesn't\nmake any sense and i think for a lot of\npeople\nwe do start our lives expecting certain\nthings whether it's from a relationship\nor boyfriend a girlfriend or whatever it\nis\nand then we have to deconstruct that\nwell this gets into parenting yes you\nknow this is the framework of what our\nparents are creating for us we're\none of the most interesting things that\nare happening in a lot of modern\nsocieties is we have had\ndisproportionate prosperity over five\nsix seven\ndecades america has had a clean run\ni mean we've had a couple of recessions\nhere and there we've had a couple of\ninternal country scandals we have\nunderlining issues of sexism and racism\nand things of that nature\nbut in its most macro this has been the\nempire\nthings have been good and what has\nhappened is we've created\nunbelievable levels of entitlement\nentitlement yeah entitlement entitlement\ni can't stop thinking about it yeah it\nis\nit's starting to consume me that i never\nyou know it sounds crass like never\nexpect anything from anyone\nbut but i almost want to find new ways\nto say it\njust to help people understand it is the\ngreat gift of life\nyeah when you get into a place where you\nhave zero expectations and you actually\ndon't believe you're entitled to\nanything\nyou can actually start doing things yes\nabsolutely because otherwise that's\nwhat's paralyzing you\nbecause you feel like somebody else is\nin control the man\nthe society the government the president\nthe not president the governor the mayor\nthe system the the systematic\ninfrastructure\nand really it's a crutch right like\nreally it's just it's\nlike that's another way it's course it's\nan excuse yes at its best\nit's a lack of perspective yes yes yeah\nat the worst it's an excuse correct\nexactly it's just like\nit's another way i hate when i hate when\npeople that are\nuh the opposite of that uh\naren't sympathetic to that some people\ndon't use it as an excuse there are\nabsolutely people\nwho use it as excuse because they just\ndon't want to do and they want to\ncontinue to be\nentitled lazy whatever one would want to\ndeploy but but i hate when people go the\nother way and a lot of people think i\ncan go that other way where it's like\nit's on you it's like\nno it's a little more subtle than that\nthere are people that just don't have\nthat perspective\nand that's why talking about it in\nmoments like this lead to\nlook when i do a podcast like this\nknowing that you have such a thoughtful\naudience\ni come on knowing we overlap in a lot of\nplaces\nall i've been thinking about for the\nfirst 10 minutes and all i'll think\nabout for the rest of this talk is\ncan i bring one person value can i add\nan adjective a sentence\na saying the same thing in a different\nway than jay or somebody else says\nthat helps karen who's listening to this\nright now on her treadmill\nlike actually do something there's\nnothing more intoxicating than when\nyou're a communicator\nthan getting the feedback loop of\nsomebody saying you said something\ni did something i'm happier now end of\nstory\nyeah absolutely and whether you're\nlistening to or watching this right now\nwhether you're\non a treadmill whether you're commuting\nto or from work whether you're walking\nyour dog right now i want to make want\nyou to make sure also that\nyou're listening for that like i just\nwant to prepare the audience everyone is\nlistening and watching right now make\nsure you're listening\nfor that to find that in this podcast\nwell let me say this as an outside\nobserver if you're listening to jay's\npodcast\nfrom my standpoint you're you're you\nhave a level of curiosity or\nsubconscious understanding that there's\na tweak or two that can really change\nthe game\nthat already puts you in an incredible\nplace\nand when i think about individuals that\ni admire that are onto it\nlike yourself and i'd like to thank me\nin\nyou and me being different listen\nthere's a significant not significant\nthere's a there's a\nchunk of the audience right now that\ngenuinely doesn't like me that likes you\nbecause of the\nbecause i watch i read it i like you i\nknow that and i and i love you and i\nthink\nbut here's where i'm going my big thing\nis what i think we need to have more\noptimism and positivity in ecosystem\nwhen we're lucky enough here's my point\nof view there are\npeople who are going to be attracted to\nmy message style\nmore than yours and vice versa and we\nneed to start thinking\nin an avengers talk yes yes like\ni'm very grateful that i was an\nimmigrant\ncame in through a rugged russian dna\nstructure\ngrew up in jersey was a terrible student\ndidn't understand high society high\neducation know anything\nbecause what ended up happening is at\nits melting us down\nwe're the same adding the layers\nallows a 46 year old\nborn in jersey to a shitty situation\n[ __ ] everybody [ __ ] the social left\n[ __ ] everybody they're attracted to me\nyet what i'm pitching in disguise\nis empathy kindness gratitude so i'm\ngetting far more dms from\npeople that say things like a year ago\ni was addicted to drugs striking my\nwoman\nthought you were cool you weren't gonna\nmake me money so i don't know what you\ndid to me\nbut over the last year i've reconciled\nthat relationship\ni've gotten help i'm selling stuff on\nebay\ni've gotten this better job my\nrelationship with my dad has changed i\nconfronted my mother\nthe reality is you could never do that\nfor that person\non the flip side you're doing something\nfor somebody\nwho sees me in instagram explorer likes\nthe title\nclicks it and in eight seconds says [ __ ]\nthis guy\nthis guy's a piece of [ __ ] what how\nconceited like ego\nand they're out and they're never coming\nback when i think about that today\ni think it's unbelievably important and\none of the things i am so happy about\nwe've never talked about this but it you\nknow just kind of came to me here\ni'm so happy that we have this\nadmiration for each other because i\nactually believe that there's too many\npeople that are doing good in the world\nright now\nbut because of the veneer of how they're\ndoing it other good people are judging\nthem to not do it their way\nand we're destroying the upside yes yeah\n100\ni'll give you a perfect example of how\nit happened on the podcast so a couple\nof podcasts ago i had chelsea handler on\nthe podcast okay\nand a lot of people were like jay how\ncan you have chelsea on yes right like\nchelsea's negative\nand she talks about celebrity gossip and\nall of this stuff and i met chelsea at a\nwisdom 2.0 conference where we were both\nspeaking about mindfulness\nand i was there and i saw chelsea and\nshe spoke about mindfulness and she sat\nthrough everyone else's presentations\nso she was there for real she was\npresent and we connected afterwards and\ni realized that meditation has been a\nhuge part of her life\nand so i wanted to have her on because\nthat's what her new book's about and\nthat's what we were discussing\nand and the judgment was so high of like\njay how can you sit down and i was just\nlike wait a minute if i consider myself\na kind\ngood empathetic human being if i can't\ndisplay that\nto absolutely everyone to understand\nthem from a different perspective then i\ncan't be a good kind or empathetic human\nbeing\nand so sometimes i mentioned jay yeah\nthat\nalmost not almost everybody\ndoesn't know everything totally about\neverybody oh of course\ni mean we the the the the eliminate\nme going through a process over the last\nhalf decade\nof curtailing my judgment i didn't start\nwith a whole lot\nbut whatever i've started at to where i\nam now compared to 36 months ago\nhas put me into a stronger position that\ni've never could have imagined and makes\nme excited for the next 50 years of my\nlife\ni'm just done now if there's something\nthat is\nobviously black and white done you know\nlike it doesn't mean that nobody can do\nno wrong\nbut boy we are in hot take judgment land\nyeah they don't know chelsea yeah i\ndon't i don't know anything\nyeah yeah like like they don't know no\nno and we don't see it\nand i just don't know i don't know like\ni i think people hear\nyou know like i don't know yeah and i\nactually wanted to do this analysis and\nyou've just given me the store right now\nso\nreal quick somebody judging somebody for\ndoing celebrity judgment\nwhen they're judging that celebrity in\nthe output is the most hypocritical\nthing i've ever heard of all time\nyeah but this is literally what they're\ndoing to you in the comments section\nthey're mad at for her doing yeah this\nis the age of coral and hypocrisy though\nright like that's like that's so huge\noh boy like it's so huge but you've just\ngiven me an idea because\nwhen i listen to you and i think this is\ni would love to do and i don't know if\nyour team's doing it so one of you guys\nraghav or whoever else is in the room\nplease try this out i'd love for someone\non gary's team to do a keyword search\non how many times gary uses the word\ngratitude or positivity or or humility\nversus even a cuss word that he gets\nsaid that he says too many of\nwe have it awesome great yeah i want to\nsee it because when i listen to you\nwhen i listen to you and this is what i\nfeel we have to look beyond and i think\nwhat we're encouraging people to do\ni hear the words optimism positivity\nhumility uh the other one that i said\nwhat did i say\ngratitude gratitude i see i hear\ngratitude more than anything\nlike every time i turn you on all i ever\nhear is gratitude and so for me\nthat's why you know what's even better\nyeah and i love you for that and we'll\nsee what literally\nit looks like what i'm really why i love\nyou and other people i admire\nwhy i love hip-hop as a genre me too how\nabout the fact of\nwhat about not taking it literally yes\nso\nlike what i know is before i got mature\nenough to start because i had a bad\nvocab because i was a poor student\nbefore i got myself to understanding how\nabout the fact that\ni'm in my team i'm looking at my team\nright now how about the fact that i'm\neven using the word sympathy now\nwhere i never even said it once because\ni'm starting to understand slightly at\nleast\nthe world's interpretation of sympathy\nversus empathy because i used empathy\nsometimes when i meant sympathy you know\ni'm evolving\nbut like like but how about go watch the\nfirst thousand episodes of wine library\ntv i'm doing a wine show\nyeah i'm never saying gratitude or\nempathy or kindness\nbut if you watch it kind of i'm saying\nkindness\nand empathy and gratitude and positivity\nand optimism yeah\nthat's you know to me that's what i'm\ntrying to\nin the reverse too i see a lot of people\nthat everybody puts on a pedestal in\nsociety\nbecause they're saying the right things\nbut i'm seeing something different which\nis not as pretty\nright and i think that we need to get\ninto a thoughtfulness\nconversation as a society of back to\nintent\nabsolutely people are so literal yes and\nlike to me what i know literally to the\nday both one of us dies\nthere's nothing you're going to do\nthat's going to upset me because i've\nalready got enough data binarily\non what you're about the end yeah you\nknow\ni have the advantage of also being in\nthe business world like for everybody\nlistening let me let me say i'm about to\ngive you a compliment that i have no\nclue of\nhow you're going to take this i'm just\nenjoying watching from afar\nbecause i'm in the trenches of your\nthoughtfulness of how you're thinking\nabout your professional career\nhow are you thinking about what partners\nare you gonna work with you know people\nare pitching you\nlike you know this is my world right so\nlike even just watching from afar\nwithout details of all the different\nparties\nsome reaching out to me like hey can you\nput in a good word we want to sign him\nfor a tour\nfor a book series for like just the\nthoughtfulness that you're putting in\nyou know it just reminds me a lot of me\nand this maybe me complimenting myself\nbut no listen there's not a lot of years\nago listen i will say this jay in\ncomparison to a lot of people that look\nlike us\nguys gals different people in society i\nbelieve most people are not thoughtful\nand they're kind of into short-term kpis\nwhether it's dollars or fame or\nfollowers or just checking the box\nand i think you've you're deploying\ncurrently one of the more thoughtful\nexecutions\ni admire that well thank you man i think\nit's a big part of it is our value for\npatience\n100 and for me by the way a word that's\ngoing to come up i know i know i don't\nknow it's gonna be in there that's what\ni brought it up tell me about something\ni i've been wanting to ask you this\nbecause\ni i consume everything you put out so\nfor me it's you know i have\nmy mind's a human algorithm of what\nyou're saying too but\ni'd love to know what is it that you've\nbeen thinking about lately\nthat you can't put into a one minute\nfour minute video because you're\napprehensive about the fact that\npeople are just gonna run in and you\nknow because you you need more context\nwhat have you been doing yes sir what\ndid i\ntell you that i don't want to write the\narticle within six more months this is\nthe first time it [ __ ] happened\ni can't believe you just asked that\nwrong off in the entire time\nhow many times have i ever told you no\nnot yet it's not ready\nit happened yesterday for the first time\noh wow it almost never happened\nsomething i'm thinking a ton about which\nis a complete\nand utter uh pot committed thesis\nof bottom up everything okay meaning\ntest and learn mvp\nwhat how i see it is a complete\nand utter commitment to lack of fear\nso what we were talking about i'm in\nthis mindset of like everything should\nbe a pilot\nyou know you and i thought oh god this\nis so meta i just got done\ntelling you how much i admire the fact\nthat you're thoughtful\nand now i'm about to tell you that you\nand i should put out\nnew stuff every day that has no thought\nagainst it\nas a data loop back to the thought right\nbut therefore it's thoughtful\ni think so yeah it's it's a map\ni like you that's exactly right in the\nmacro\nthe most thoughtful one can do\nthoughtful thing that one can do right\nnow in our society to take advantage of\nthe internet\nis to not think about output put it out\nyou know what it manifested into\nthis is really back to like me living my\ndog food or eating my dog food\nlast night i put up my single worst\nperforming instagram post\nin the last five years right it's called\nwhat if wednesdays after the call\nof like saying yes we're gonna tell the\nworld in six months\nthis kind of pop concept we're telling\nthem now obviously we've\nnow made the commitment this is again me\nlike completely contradiction\nof my own self i'm giving it to you know\nyou right here\nyou know we need to be more creatively\nbrave\nwe need to take advantage of the\ninternet the feedback loop\ni knew that the piece of content wasn't\ngonna work i'm creating this thing\ncalled what if wednesdays\nand it's this idea that i love products\nright baseball cards cereal\nwine sneakers so we're gonna every\nwednesday we're gonna post something on\ninstagram called what if wednesdays\nwhat if i made this product the first\none we posted was a former employee of\nmine\ntyler babin actually bobby babin who\njust went for this incredible thing\nat adobe just left our team in an\nepisode of dailyvee like a year and a\nhalf ago went really viral in my\ncommunity\ni was in an elevator with him we were\njoking we put on the it was in the vlog\nwhere i was like let's make bobby babin\nbeef jerky and it was like this whole\nhahaha thing anyway\nwe posted it last night we posted it it\ndid a tr\ni've never had a piece of content not\nget 10 000 likes\nlike just like unbelievably poor and i'm\nso happy\nbecause i'm living my truth which is we\nnow live in a world where people are so\ninto growth hacking the algorithm you\nknow i think it's something that you're\ngonna go through because i watch you and\ni'm like okay\nthat's working for him he i hope he\nuh i can't wait for him to get to a\nplace where he realizes that's great\nyes but i need to be saying what i want\nto be saying yes not what i know will\nwork yeah and i call it mains inside so\nfor me it's like i've always got my main\nsame walls same thing and i've got my\nsides and i'm switching them all the\ntime i call the same thing yeah i called\nside dishes\nyeah i've called it navy seals to the\narmy yeah uh i call it 85\ncore 15 play i've said to everyone so\nanyway i have one like i've always said\nto people if i had seven\nformats that worked for me i'd have\nseven videos and i'd keep re\npunching and growing punchline i'm in\nthe beginning process of putting myself\nin a position\ni wanted to do q a i started a show\ncalled the askgaryvee show yeah i wrote\na book called askgaryvee\nand now i'm able to do keynotes where\nit's 30 minutes keynote 30 minutes q a\nbecause i know i'm at my best with q a\nbecause i can show my expertise\nnot my showmanship right yeah so\ni know that i'm in the beginning stages\nof putting myself into a place\nbecause something i've discovered about\nmyself that i had no clue and i mean no\nclue\ni'm dramatically more creative than i\nrealized and i'm about to put myself\ninto a place\nyeah to be creative on a daily basis to\ntaste\nin an acceptance way as a side dish\ninstead of a theory\nyeah 100 i love that man that's awesome\none thing i've been trying to figure out\nwith you as well and which i think is\nsuch a\na thing that you balance so well you can\ncall it a superpower if you like\nis your ability we talked about this\nearlier and sparked it now your ability\nto not judge yourself\nbut to hold yourself accountable and i\nthink that that is such a\nscary thing for people because a lot of\nus don't judge ourselves and then we\ndon't do anything\nor less of us so accountable to\nourselves that we don't give us space to\ndo what you just said you do now\nso like please yeah no no so what i'm\njust saying is the action you just took\nyesterday\nshows the balance of the two it's also\nit's just\nyes and this gets into confidence not\nego that gets into loving yourself\nand not being delusional look what i\njust did\nit's also i literally told him for the\nfirst time ever i'm not ready to tell\nthe world about that\nand 12 [ __ ] hours later i told the\nworld about it\nthat is remarkably intriguing to me yeah\nand\ni'm just trying to find look this is\nactually a fun platform to probably say\nthis\nanother thing i know that i'm going to\nstart talking a lot more about is how\nmuch i don't think i'm right\nhmm i just know i'm right for myself yes\nand i desperately want everybody to find\nwhat's right for themselves yeah\nthere is no right 100 like you know\nespecially you know a lot of people try\nto throw hustle porn\nand all this stuff at me and i'm\ndevastated by it because i'm like [ __ ]\nbecause i use the word hustle and\nbecause of my energy\ni mean my first book i outlined work 30\nhours this is about one big game of\nhappiness\nyet people here 7 pm to 2 in the morning\npeople are using my name to build up\ntheir profile and i'm like [ __ ] i don't\nwant this\nright this would devastate me if there's\nany confusion\nand so you know i'm being very\nthoughtful because i have to respect it\ni have to respect that p you know even\nthough i know they're using it to\nbuild up their profile and it makes me\nso sad that people are falling for it\nand it's like the reverse of like things\nthat they make fun of or are mad at that\nare happening in society\ni still have to be thoughtful about it\nuh\nbut yeah i i you know like the way i\nalways took that from you\nwas and and i say this often too it's\njust like it's work ethic\nit's right and there is no substitute\nfor that\nwhen i started using hustle and it\nbecame like it was just my version of\nwork ethic work ethic yeah it was your\nlanguage you know\nbut but and and there's truth in it\ni also probably the single loudest voice\nin entrepreneurship\ntelling people they're not entrepreneurs\num yeah that's true yeah right right jay\nlike like\nlike like i don't know like back to\nhearing things the way you reacted this\none hasn't necessarily been obvious to\nyou yet\nbut i hope people hear it i'm [ __ ]\ni'm talking about self-awareness yes yes\nyes yes yes like i think it's incredible\nto be a number four how about this\ni sometimes fantasize about being a\nnumber four\nyou it sucks being the number one\neverything's my fault i met with two\nemployees today\ni wanna blame their managers but i know\nit's my fault because i hired their\nmanagers\nyeah so yeah i mean it's only at the top\nit's uh\nuh i i think that one thing that i'm\ngetting excited about\nis creating more context and clarity\naround my conviction and confidence in\nmyself which allows me to do what you\njust brought up\nand now i want to start pushing it out\nin a way that allows people to do it for\nthemselves\nhere's my thing and i always say this to\nyou so i'm glad\ni was i when we first started this\npodcast i was about to say it again\nbecause i actually believe it\nuh but i was like nah i always say it\nand now i'm happy i'm about to say it\nyou have crazy beautiful eyes\nlike the first time you said that to me\nwas like i think it was the first time\nwe met and it was like one of the most\nawkward things ever because\nfor me it was i did not expect that from\ngary is the last thing i expected from\nyou\nyou did nothing to make that happen true\ni always say i can't take credit for\nthem\ni say that all the time i don't take\ncredit for anything i am\nall my accolades i'm like my parents\nyeah my circumstance yeah ooh soviet\nrussia to america oh the 80s oh jersey\noh this oh some form of learning\ndisability that may be shitty at school\nlike ooh ooh ooh right\nuh you know by the way not being\ndiagnosed with a learning disability\nwhich then either i'm right or i'm wrong\nbut it doesn't matter i didn't have to\ndeal with that pressure especially in\n80s when it was a little bit more like\nscary than it is now like what if i was\nwhat if i did maybe i didn't\nprobably not because they would have\ncaught my you get into all these\ncircumstances\nthis is a big deal though i'm sure\nthat what i talk about is right for me\nbecause i'm incredibly in tune with\nmyself and i'm an incredibly good\ncommunicator\nin a style that hits a certain group\nwhich helps them get the insight\nto create affirmation to create lack of\nfear\nto try something to start the process to\nget to a happier place\nthat is a [ __ ] blessing yeah 100 now\ni want people to figure out\nthat things are right for them based on\ntheir luck\nuh circumstance what's their beautiful\neyes\nyeah yes maybe they're not an\nentrepreneur because\nthey don't lack they don't have\nincredible lack of fear\nbut maybe that they are incredibly\ncompassionate\nunbelievably analytical remarkably\ncompetitive\nincredibly gorgeous wonderfully funny\nlike let's lean into what we're [ __ ]\nawesome about everybody's spending all\ntheir time on what they suck at\nyeah themselves they're doing that and i\npromise you everybody else is spending\nall their time\ntelling you what you suck at i'm\nspending all my time thinking about what\ni'm [ __ ] awesome at yeah and i'm\nspending all my time trying to figure\nout what everybody else is awesome at\nsome of it's very obvious like beautiful\neyes others are like\nhey you're a good [ __ ] kid keep\nlistening to me\nyou know like that's what's going on but\nthat's because of awareness of story\nit's like\nwe're all so addicted to watching other\npeople's stories that we don't have a\nhigh awareness of our story\nand we're not telling ourselves like\nwell you just explained all your\nconnections from your past to your\nparenting to school\nyou've created the story arc that fits\nyou\nthat works for you because you could\ntell yourself a different story about\nthat but what also happens as you evolve\ninto it what people don't understand\nabout getting to a place of\nbeing happy with yourself it starts\ngiving you foundation to address what\nyou're not as good at\nyes 20 years ago i couldn't speak to\nfirst i didn't know this about myself\nbut today i could speak to\nmy lack of candor along the way is a\nshortcoming of mine as a manager and\nover the last five years vayner's in a\nhealthier place because i realized in my\nlack of being interested in conflict\ni would hold it to myself but then i\nwould pull the rug from underneath you\nwhen i would fire you\nwithout giving you context along the way\neven though my thing was like [ __ ] don't\nyou realize how shitty you're doing\nbut no that's not your responsibility\nyou're in your own framework\nthat's not something i could say out\nloud ten years ago yes\nbut you can now a hundred percent yeah\nbecause when you dig\nin and deep down triple down on\nhappiness\noptimism self-love you get to a place\nwhere\nyou get such into a good place that you\ncan start putting your toe\ninto your shortcomings yeah i so agree i\nso agree\nwe're doing it the other way around\nmajority people are doing it the other\nway around you're not in love with\nyourself\nso you're not in a place where you can\ntalk about your vulnerabilities\nso what you do is you start calling out\nthe vulnerabilities that you have in\nothers yes absolutely absolutely and\nthen and then it grows because the more\nyou're\nmeditating on other people's\nvulnerabilities the more they even\nbecome yours i've seen that sometimes\nwhen you keep talking about and thinking\nabout\nand fix setting on someone else's you\nstart mirroring do you know what i just\nrealized\ni actually spend no time on judging\npeople's shortcomings only focusing on\ntheir strengths\ni don't even have the capacity or the\nroom\nleft yeah\nraghoff doesn't get feedback from me\nwe're doing our thing and the feedback\nhe got yesterday is you're ready for\nthis brother i see it\nyou can do this right this is [ __ ]\nmeta [ __ ] this is real this happened\nyesterday\ni haven't [ __ ] talked to him in six\nmonths he's writing for me we're doing\nhis thing and what he gets for me\nyesterday is you're ready for this you\ncould do better\nhere's why i see it and we can do better\nand that's and i start with it's on me\nand then it's [ __ ] amazing yeah the\n[ __ ]\nyou're right it's optimism like why\neverything else is pessimistic\nabsolutely and one of the best things i\nlove about that is when you're all in on\nyour strengths you appreciate other\nstrengths\nbut it also limits your envy and\njealousy right like when you\ngenuinely start you know keep going no\nno\nwhat i was about to say is it's the same\ni'm blown away by my inabilities on\nthose two things\nbut i had to raise them because they're\nsuch big things let's go meta do you\npump damn your podcast is ahead of mine\nbeing dead [ __ ] serious i appreciate\nthat i swear on my [ __ ] children's\nhealth\ni go into the charts occasionally you\nknow once every two weeks because i like\nto stay on top of [ __ ]\nand i look and i see you there i'm like\n[ __ ] good those [ __ ] eyes\nbut no i mean it makes me happy it makes\nme happy\nbecause here's my big thing when it\ncomes to things of that nature\nif you don't have that gear then you're\nnot respecting the game that's giving\nyou\nlife if i can't be happy for people\nwho are winning in entrepreneurship and\ncontent then i'm [ __ ] on the game\nthat's made me happy\ntotally 100 i completely agree i'm so\nin love with you know what i've been\nafforded to be able to do\nthat i want everybody else who can do\nthat too to be better at me\nif they can yeah and and the beauty i\nthink for all of us\nwho know that for me the same thing back\nis\nthis is an exchange it's love it's\nsupport right like we all know that\nlike i've seen this for years that\ncollaboration has beat competition every\ntime\nand i know we know that there's also an\nabundance yeah\nyes there's so much there's so much for\neveryone yeah abundance 100\nand i think we live we live in this\nworld where it's like oh if i\ndo this then no one's going to follow\ngary and jay which is not true no one\ngoes\ni follow gary i'm not going to follow\njay i will say\ni was i was letting you talk because i'm\ntrying to be more thoughtful about that\ni\ni i i'm literally feeling down i\nliterally was thinking in my mind\nas we were segueing from last part some\nof my favorite comments ever\nhave been looking at my friends and\nseeing\npeople write things that say verbatim\nhey\nlet's use you hey jay and uh i'm trying\nlet me give you a real example\nmaybe psy wakeman somebody awesome yes i\njust remember somebody leaving a comment\nwhen i was going to look at my friend to\nlike give him some love\nlike double tap or leave something\nliterally the comment that was above me\nlike i was writing comment was like hey\nsomebody i don't want to make it up yeah\nyou used to listen to gary vee but [ __ ]\nthat like you're so much better\nand the sheer happiness\nand it comes in a couple ways it's\nactually back to double side coins a\nabundance love positivity collaboration\nb competition you know i was pumped for\nher\nand i was like let me go back to the lab\nand make awesome [ __ ] you know like yeah\nyeah absolutely\nif you can't respect the game that\nyou're in more than what it brings to\nyou\nthen i don't think you're an all-time\nplayer and and i think you see that all\nthe time and i\nand i know you've been getting into\nfootball recently like real football yes\nproper\nyeah yeah like soccer yeah and it's like\nfor me\ni know you've been getting and i look at\nthat in ronaldo and messi who are\ncompared yeah and i'm like\nthey just wouldn't be as great as they\nare if they didn't have each other don't\nagree more right and\nthat's not agree more and i believe in\nthat the fact that they can both exist\nin the same world\nand by the way somebody wins the game\nyes like liverpool won\nyes the other day like that happens and\ni think we need to be careful because\nwe're being very foofy foofy here\nare we in a good way go on like we're\ntalking about very positive\nlight like i think people get confused\nif you back to\ndon't take the words listen to what\nwe're saying here we are\nsaying that there's ramifications we are\nsaying\nthat there's winning and losing mm-hmm\nwe are there\ni know we are absolutely but we're\nsaying that without each other\nthey wouldn't feel that same fuel to\nkeep going correct\nand then you choose whether you want\nthat fuel to keep going or you're going\nto wallow in that fuel and then just\nor my favorite part is do you even want\nto drive that car in that fuel anymore\ntrue when i tell you the great question\nin my life\nright now is will i wake up one day and\ngo completely the other way\ni think it's actually possible and i\nsmile with that because i don't know\nand i can feel that i'm not forcing it\nlike like i would actually argue the\nother way like i don't want to disappear\nbut if you told me that at 62 i woke up\nsold off everything and took a five year\nrun of sitting in a cave in peru\nand then came back at 67 i would say to\nyou like yeah\ni i it's i can't i can never see myself\ndoing drugs\nyes i can never see myself stealing\nmoney out of somebody's wallet\nit's just impossible it's not in my\nframework i can see myself sitting in a\ncave in peru for five i love hearing\nthat\ni love hearing that because well because\ni don't think anybody would believe that\nabout me\nexcept people that get really really\nreally inside\nor look like you which is\ndisproportionately have intuitive\nsuperpowers\nno i really like when i was 18 if anyone\never told me that i'd one day live as a\nmonk\ni would have laughed at them and span\ntheir face yeah so i said yeah exactly\nso when you said that i was like\ni literally was i joined social media in\n2015.\nyeah i get it and it's like i wasn't i\nnever joined because i was\na monster you know this is this is a\nfunny thing back to i apologize but this\nwill bring value to a lot of people\nuh this is a game of best\nnot first yeah people are always trying\nto be first on the next platform people\nask me what's the next platform because\nthey want to be first\nthey like i was slow to instagram in\ncomparison to twitter\nthis is a game about best yeah and for\nme it's longevity 100 it's longevity for\nme as well yeah it's such a long game\nand and it's i think so many people get\nthis bad feedback too and i've had a lot\nof friends here this hey you realize\nyou've only got a three year lifeline\nthat's stupid right i've had so many\npeople\nhear that from people make the right\ndecisions from people that have never\nlived it\nyes from people that have never lived it\nhey you realize it's all happening by\nthe way real quick because the second\ntime it's come up\nif we get anything across in this\nepisode\nif you're like please just pay attention\nto who's giving the advice\npeople say things to me all the time\nlike you've never built a business\ngary you should do this with vaynermedia\nlike you're\nyou're an inventor of fruit like i'm not\ntelling you what fruits to marry\nlike like we have to have a better\nconversation\nif you have two parents that were\nentrepreneurs and you want to aspire to\nbe one of the great professors\nof academia they're pr you've got to be\nthoughtful that they're giving you\nadvice as entrepreneurs\nvice versa many of us listening right\nnow had parents that grew up in the\nindustrial revolution\nand get a safe job and the rise of\nunions and like\nand if you're dying to be an\nentrepreneur because you always sold\nlemonade and pencils and this is the\ngreat year of entrepreneurship\nand you want to do it your parents\nadvice has to be contextualized\nyes they believe in safety yes and\nthat's what i mean by that\nlooking at things from a care angle and\na competence angle right like you're\ngonna have people\nthat they're like my mom like my mom\ndoes not care\nwhat i'm doing she cares about has her\nson slept has her son eaten\nand has her son taking care of his\nhealth like that's what my mom cares\nabout\nshe doesn't care about any award she\ndoesn't care about the podcast she\ndoesn't care\nand and that's beautiful and i love that\nbut i have to take it for what it is\nthat my mom cares about my mental and\nphysical well-being yes right like\nthat's what she's an expert in\nyes that's her expertise that's her zone\nthat's what i should listen to her for\ncouldn't agree more yeah i love that and\nthat's what i'm taking contextualize the\nadvice yeah and otherwise we argue with\nthem someone's like mom you don't\nunderstand i'm working so hard but it's\nlike no like take that like\nshe can't you know what you're talking\nabout right now that i've that has\ni just realized been subconsciously on\nmy mind another thing i'm thinking a lot\nabout which is like\nand you start it's amazing you started\nthis podcast with it\nfor a lot of nobody is for everybody\nright\nyeah nobody out there sharing is right\nfor everybody no one\nhowever most people that are resonating\nwith a large enough\naudience probably have something to add\nto you\nand that's something i've been thinking\nabout like\nwhat's the 13 of me that brings value to\nsomebody on the other side\nwho genuinely doesn't like me or like it\nright now\nwhat's the five percent value that\nsomebody can bring me\nthat i don't see value in right now yeah\nit's not binary\nand that might become a fun place to dig\ndeeper into\nyeah absolutely no i think it is a fun\nthing and i think\nno this is us being super polite\nuh the thing that i've seen also is that\nwe're constantly in that space\nwe take pressure from the room we're in\nso if in a room full of investors you\nwalk out and go\ncrap i need to invest right and you know\nin a room full of\ndalai lamas you'll be like crap i need\nto meditate right like that's my point\nlike and so you know what's funny about\nthat tell me about this jay because\nwhere i go in those scenarios is\nactually the other way yeah but that's\nred that's\nwhat i'm pointing out go on no no\nnothing yeah because you were talking i\nwas like\nit's so weird when i'm in a room of\ninvestors i'm selling dalai lama yeah\nwhen i'm in a room correct\nllamas yeah i'm selling investing so i\nget that yeah i get that and i talk\nand that's actually the mit did an\nincredible study on this\nwhere they looked at connected thinkers\npeople who were able\nto take advice from people who didn't\nknow each other so we're not living in\necho chambers so basically if you wanted\nto launch something\nlet's say you wanted to launch a new app\nyou would take advice from mark\nzuckerberg and the dalai lama\nbecause that would be fascinating for\nhumanity i'll tell you what's really\ninteresting\nbecause you're really getting me\nthinking here i one of the things that\nis extremely at the tip of my tongue\nis my ability to also take advice\nfrom my friend rob muse\nwho's you know lives in atlanta or or a\nnine-year-old kid who hasn't lived life\nyet like\ni really really associate actually more\nto the trenches yeah then the experts\nyes you know dolly and sucks yeah yeah\nbut for me it's like the user the user\nyeah\nbrother yeah it's all i got absolutely i\nactually struggle with taking advice\nfrom\nmy shortcoming is not taking advice from\nthe dalai lama it sucks yeah and taking\nsusan karinsky's\nhot take yeah and they're successful\nthey all have a different value right\nthey\nall have different values like it's i i\nsaid the same thing when people are like\nhow do you not run out of things to say\nin your content because i'm talking to\npeople\nright like that's my number or answer\nbecause i'm talking to people i'm\nlistening\ni'm listening i'm listening to just\npeople i just read comments man\nyeah same i read comments the last 10\ntimes i've gone to your instagram\ni've read comments and didn't watch what\nyou put out yeah\nthat's real you want to talk about weird\n[ __ ] that i'm sure most people aren't\nthinking about\nthat's that's an insight there's a hot\ntake there's something you might want to\nbuild on\nyeah absolutely no 100 and that's for\nfor me it's like i'm having the\nconversation\nwith a random person who's had a breakup\ni'm having a conversation with the\nrandom person who's trying to start a\nbusiness\nthose random conversations are\neverything uh everything like that's the\nfirst thing that i bring what did we get\nto let's do a little bit of a weird\nspeed round\nokay so this is the final five we do at\nthe end of every round\nso this is our this is our speed round\nyou already predicted well what about\nwhat about\nfinal seven what two things on the first\npart of the page\nor second i don't feel like we're gonna\nhave to do this many more times so yeah\ni want to push\nyou know what the funny thing is we went\non to all of this stuff organically\nwithout me even touching on it love\nsomething i really love about you thank\nyou you're welcome is\ni feel like i in the last year i've\nrealized why i liked star wars star wars\nwas the only\nsci-fi thing i followed as a kid uh\nand actually wwf wrestling right these\nwrestling\nfigures these star wars things that are\nin my room and i finally hit it\nthey are very classic stories of good\nversus bad\nyeah i mean star wars is just like super\nhigh level\nfirst bad 100 but there's something that\nwrestling does and star wars does\ni can't believe i'm breaking this down\nright now i just had my thought on this\nwrestling has a very interesting thing\nwhere somebody good\ncan become a bad guy and where somebody\nbad can become a good guy\nright yeah it's like i don't know how\nmany people follow right i used to love\nwrestling but like macho man randy\nsavage was my favorite wrestler he was a\nbad guy when he came in\nthen he became a good guy right yeah the\ndark side versus the force\nif you watch that series you know it's a\nvery fine line\nyou can feel like at any moment like\nright you've got the established but\nlike you kind of understand the course\nsubject matter\ndarth vader it's right there right\ni believe that you and i sit in the\nworld right now\nthere's a lot of personalities there's a\nlot of people talking about good\nand i don't believe the majority of them\nare actually good\nand i think you are thank you man and\nthat's why i've always leaned in\nevery time you've reached out right yeah\nthank you man\ndo you see what i'm saying and how do\nyou think about it because it's\nsomething i'm\nstrung i don't want to say struggling\nwith because it's not true\ni'm concerned\nthat if some of the people are society\nand really are genre\npodcasters instagramers youtubers\npersonal brands\nauthors speakers if we\naren't thoughtful about some people that\npeople are considering good\nbut actually they're not good they're\nselling things for the sake of their own\npersonal financial growth\nthat it's a dangerous precedent\nand i feel a sense of responsibility as\nsomebody who sees it at the same token\ni'm i don't have the bandwidth to do the\ninvestigative reporting\nto cross the t's and eyes so that i'm\ncompletely definitive\nso that i can say [ __ ] you karen\nthompson yeah\nin a world where everyone's like where\nthe [ __ ] did that come from isn't karen\nthompson awesome\nand being right at the end yeah\nnow that i just spewed all that what are\nyour random thoughts about you know why\nthat's so crazy because i just had\nbreakfast with someone that we both know\nwho i won't say on the podcast i can\ntell you afterwards who is telling me\nabout just this\nit's so crazy like literally i that\nwasn't even at the front what was she or\nhe sang\nthey were saying that this exists you\nshould be wary of it\nwhat's your take on it like literally\nyeah literally\nthey were like this exists and i was\nlike wow and they've done the\ninvestigating work like they've gone\nthey've gone deep into the research of\nit and because i was like i was also you\nknow playing devil's advocate i was like\nokay look how bad is it what is it you\nknow because we're optimistic and i want\nto\ni want to give people the benefit of the\ndoubt my take on it is it's kind of like\nwhen companies started doing csr\nor environmental work because they knew\nthey had to right\ni can't believe you that's where you\ntook it i'm unbelievably cynical\nyeah to businesses with purpose yes\nbecause when i lick because when i sit\ndown with the founder\nyeah i leave with you're a piece of [ __ ]\nbecause you're\nusing a cause to create commerce\ntotally and i said nine out of ten i see\nthat all the time it's in our world\nbrother yeah\nand and i think that what i look at and\ni think this is what you've done\nand this is what i really saw is\npowerful and luckily the people i spoke\nto in my life always\nemphasized this was community first\nright it was always about community it\nwas always about family it was always\nabout\npeople and i think that we need to be\ncareful and i do agree with you the\ninvestigation is important because i\ndon't want to go out and start accusing\nand\nmaking allegations because that's not\ncool because\ni'm not even good at publicly [ __ ]\non people who are clearly 100\nwrong yeah it's not my natural state\nyeah so to do it without the\ninvestigation\nbut it is hap it is uh yeah interesting\nanyway that's how i just was curious\nabout that because i do think you're in\nthe mind ironically in the minority of\npure good\nand i think and that doesn't mean you\ndon't build a business\nno it doesn't mean you don't get paid to\nspeak or write a book or do a\nten city tour of course there's just\ndifferences\nyeah and and i think that comes back to\nintention i think that's right it starts\nthere and it ends there i mean look\njust to uncover a little bit more just\nbecause it's being insightful like\ni've actually done a couple things in my\ncareer where i've gone\non people's platforms that i don't\nbelieve are good\nto sub to like weirdly try to suck them\nout\nyes oh i love it i'm so glad you brought\nthis up so every time i get invited by a\nmulti-level marketing conference or an\ninternet marketing conference or\nwhatever your\nonline marketing conference i go and i\ntalk about this stuff\nme too so i'll go on stage and they're\nexpecting me to talk about social media\nstrategy and how i get views and all of\nthis stuff and our subtext\nmy two starting lines are i did not\nbuild any of this to build a brand or a\nbusiness because i didn't\ni just made contact because i wanted\nthat help and this is where you and i\nare so fun as compliments like a tag\nteam\ni go and start with do not buy anybody's\nproducts in the back room at this\nconference\nand everyone's like what the [ __ ] just\nhappened yeah and i'm like what happened\nis i don't [ __ ] believe in the\n[ __ ] yeah\nthat's like i i come and [ __ ] try to\nlike destroy\nyeah absolutely at conferences\non like interviews i'm trying to be\nsubtle because the person's interviewing\nyou\nyeah so i'm like how do i stay in this\nwhy do i not get kicked out of this room\nwhile winking to the audience of like\nget the [ __ ] out of here yeah yeah right\nright though i've stopped doing that a\nlittle bit because right now people are\nnot thoughtful enough\nso you get direct attribution and i\nthink that is a vulnerability so i say\nno to a lot of\nassociation and i think that's the big\nmessage that's coming out here is please\ndig deeper if you're listening\nor watching whatever you're listening\nand watching please dig a step deeper\ndon't\nbe se yeah be thoughtful be thoughtful\npush beyond the\nobvious just for example once i make a\ndecision like if i saw you\non somebody's podcast that i'm like oh\nthat's a dirty person\ni would already assume that you're there\nto do that same thing\nand i appreciate that yeah we need to we\nneed to yeah oh jim's here\nhold on before we do the final oh yeah\nawesome oh this is great jim did you do\nan\nupdated version perfect timing is this\nan updated version or you couldn't find\nit\nwhile there's dead air i just want to\nsay to everybody i love you i hope\neverything is good\nuh uh one random thing like it's been\nreally working in my community\nuh just call somebody you haven't talked\nto in two years\njust literally go to your phone right\nnow context hit the letter c\nthe letter f you're gonna see somebody\nfrom high school somebody that you used\nto date and you're over it now\nlike just literally call somebody call\nnot text call somebody\nand just say what's up i hope\neverything's good and like that's it\nlike\neven if you hang up after that like get\nyou know\nlike exercise like eating getting into\npractice of optimism and positivity and\ngood\nmatters so randomly just call somebody\nand hit me up on social let me know how\nit went\nlike but this is crazy i do this once in\na while in my world like people call\ntheir father estranged father for 15\nyears\ntheir best friend that they just both\ngot busy and now they're like back and\ntheir families are friends like\nthis it's crazy anyway jim\nyeah so um when we look through\n200 episodes the words that were most\ncommon\nthe most common verbs were no think go\nwant make all action\naction and then when you looked at word\npairings\nlike what words you combine together the\nmost love and work\nmean and well give and [ __ ]\ni was i knew that i was in this listen i\ncurse\nnew new in world and play and book\ninteresting so yeah now what about these\nones these type of motions\ntop emotions right yeah so if you go\nfrom from top to bottom it's love\nlaugh funny appreciate respect passion\nscare inspire and curious\nto your point you intuitively are able\nto interpret this\nthere's not a soul one more time on\nemotions yeah the emotions\none more time yeah one more time yeah\nemotions love\nlaugh funny appreciate respect\npassion scare inspire and curious if you\nif you if you pull a\nmillion people that have ever heard of\nme and dug in a little bit\nnobody's even gonna be rem this is where\ni'm complicated\nthis is why i'm attracted to people that\nare able to decipher it this is how he\njim himself got his job here trying to\nget a job\nseparately in vayner x but i wanted him\non my team this is why i leaned into you\nif one is emotionally intelligent enough\nwith natural talent\nto have figured me out i know they're an\nincredible partner\nbecause i'm extremely difficult because\nfor all the people listening right now\nthat kind of know me or have heard of me\nor\nactually generally don't even love me\nthat much laugh\nlove like that is not that is not love\nthat is not what happens with me when i\ngo on stage or when i'm recorded\nwhat comes out is macho man randy savage\npromo videos what comes out is chris\nrock and eddie murphy\nwhat comes out is other things that\ninfluenced me in the way that i\ncommunicate when a camera is on me\nand you're still saying the same thing\nit's just the way it's being said\nand that that's yeah it's funny i don't\nknow if you guys saw it\ni've seen this at all lately out of\nnowhere i've been for the first time\never\nthoughtfully trying to tone down my\nenergy and my speed and communicating\nnot because of anything else out of pure\ncuriosity\nback to what we were talking about\ntesting stuff it's been really\nfascinating\njust a 10 off the pedal\nis just such a different thing in\nwatching the audience consume it\nnow i'm gonna still go 150 because it's\njust where my natural thing\nis and again when i go 140 i'm missing\nthat person\nwho needs 147 who almost nobody else\nright now\ncan get to yeah and unfortunately the\nonly people that can get to the person\nthat's at 147\nare the bad guys and gals yeah got it\nabsolutely got it\nthat's i have come to realize\nmy place in this avengers role\nis i'm gonna have to eat judgment from\npeople i admire\nto get through to people that are only\ngetting\ninfluenced by bad because the other\ngoods\ndon't have that one gear that i have\nthat cadence that style\nand i'm willing to deal with the\nramifications to achieve the actual good\ngoal\ni love that man it's a great note i love\nthat i'm not gonna add anything to that\ni love that\nthat's awesome this has been so much fun\nfinal five we're gonna do the final five\nbecause i want to do it\nthe first question is i know which sucks\nbecause that last sentence there would\nhave been such a great way to yeah\neverybody everybody here was like [ __ ]\nthat would have been a good one put the\nfinal five it makes it even better go\nwe'll figure out yeah you'll make it\nbetter yeah okay yeah yeah fine\nthis is the uh which i love that you\nbrought up the avengers because that's\nhow i look at life\nand i look at being a part of the\navengers so which avenger are you and\nwhy\ni've never watched avengers no i didn't\nknow that\nyou know that was coming i don't\nknow wow i know who i think you\nthe reason i this is getting super\ntriple meta this is a very thoughtful\npodcast i think yeah i love this\nyeah i said it earlier i may not watch j\ncontent but i read jay comments yeah\ninteresting i don't i've not watched one\navengers film\nbut i know what people think about the\navengers and i understand the framework\nokay i love the avengers so i know who\nyou i would too\nwho yeah robert downey jr iron man\nreally yeah\nsounds cool because i know a lot of he\ngets a lot of take i'd say it's probably\nironically what do you guys think you\nguys worked with him\nwhere are you really yeah okay anyone\nelse\nand is he the leader and now spider-man\nand he can rub people up the wrong way\nsometimes that's why i said like he has\nthat ability like see he will cast off\ncaptain america\nand they'll go off and form their own\ntribe and then hate him for a bit but\nthen they come back in the end you know\nit's that kind of you know the ability\nto\npush people up push people the wrong way\nsometimes so spider-man's a new leader\nnow\nspider-man is he yeah that's what\nthey're setting up really oh yeah\nbut he's setting it they're setting it\nup yeah with this new film\nanyway nonetheless yeah anyway so cool\ni'm glad we got there and i'm\nglad that you agreed i want to hear what\nyou think next what do you think rag\nthink about it think about it you tell\nme next time i see you yeah think about\nit\nokay second question uh you have a\nvideos titled the dumb stuff\nyou buy owns you yes which i love yes\nwhat is the dumbest thing you've ever\nbought great question\nbecause people bought dumb stuff my my\ncurrent apartment\nin new york city interesting it made me\nsuper not liquid made me miss out on\ninvesting in uber\num you know it's the dumbest in literal\nbut it established my family in a\nneighborhood that i wanted to raise it\nso it's obviously way better yeah but in\nthe second level\nyou know probably the dumbest thing that\ni've ever bought are the things that i\ndidn't buy\nright right like like a vacation that i\nshould have taken which would have been\na fruitful use of time uh that's\ndefinitely it\nyou know as i'm trying to be a little\nbit better in communicating regrets\nbecause i can't focus on them\nbut i want to talk about them because i\ndon't want to make it seem like i'm not\nhuman\nyeah i could have done a lot more\nbalance of leisure\n14 to 30 because i worked every minute\nyeah yeah\nuh i wish and and when you start with i\nwish that is regret\ni wish i had five to ten more memories\nin my 20s\nwith my high school and college friends\nof going on those trips that everybody\ndoes\nlike there's a very interesting clip\nof me where you can really see it\nmanifest where i talk about like i'm not\nlucky\nlike a bunch of kids when i first\nstarted blowing up from high school in\ncollege would hit me up\nand like gary you're so lucky and i was\nlike [ __ ] i'm not lucky yeah\nyeah when you went to the jersey shore\nevery weekend i worked my ass off\nit's not necessarily what i want to be\ntalking about right now and i'm trying\nto get the temperature of\nsociety but it's a very big truth yeah\num so i would say that yeah the dumbest\nthings the dumbest thing i ever bought\nwere the things that i ended up not\nbuying\nlove it awesome question number three\nwhat's the\nworst advice you're hearing out there\nright now that you want people to be\nmore thoughtful about uh\nall of it because it lacks\nself-awareness it lacks\npushing people into self-awareness and\nit lacks context\nanything all advice right now is a\nproblem including all of mine\nit's why i'm trying to make them make it\nabout them\num there's a lot of bad advice brother\nlike\nif somebody watches me and gets fired up\nto start a business and they're schlemel\nand can't do a business\nthey're going down a path of depression\nyeah if if\nthey're a if they're a competitive\nambitious person\nbut they also went to high society\neducation and right now the push there\nis balance and like like hard work is\nbad and we've become too much of\neurope current europe i believe this by\nthe way like that's bad advice for\nsomebody\nbecause they're going to be depressed\nbecause they lean too mu\ninto current social you know\npolitical correctness and what they\nactually are is a dog and they just want\nto grind\nyeah but right now grinding is bad yeah\nabsolutely all advice is bad\nif you haven't deployed enough love for\nyourself\nand self-awareness to understand what to\npick off\ngreat advice question number four what's\nthe one thing you're most proud of\nthat i give more than i take love it and\nquestion number five which i think is\ngonna\ngive you an opportunity to to end off\nhow we just ended up the point before\nthe final five\nis you talk about so much about the\nvalue of human life yes\nand how rare it is and how amazing it is\nwhich i don't know if you know this but\nit's like such a deep\nvedic concept which is like thousands so\nvedic\nis like the philosophy that i studied in\none of the oldest philosophies of\nmankind\nand one of the biggest principles in\nthere is about the value of human life\nlike the\nlike the way i think about 400 trillion\ncorrect correct it's helped so many\npeople by the way\nout of all the pieces of content i've\never put out something in it\nhas penetrated how does one get like you\nwhen you hit when i hear you say it when\ni look at the way i was taught it when i\nlook at the monks that i know live it\nwhen i know people that really lived\nthere what was it that helped you\nreally access gratitude and live that\nthere we go okay\nnice it's my all i'm ever doing\nis trying to take empathy gratitude\nkindness positivity\noptimism and create repackaging\nfor it in modern society to help\nsomebody\nsee it because life is one big game of\nperspective\nand if you've been raised by parents in\nan environment and have natural dna\nthat makes you look at something upside\ndown i've gotta flip it\nand when i say i got to i have this\nenormous\nlove and need for admiration that i've\ncome to realize\nadmiration will not come in the form of\nme making the most money\nadmiration will not come in any other\nform than if i give so much more to you\nthan i expect from you in return i was\ngifted\nan ability of the gift to gab i am\ncreative\ni understand attention graphs i have\nwork ethic i have aspirations\nall of that has created one big game\nwhere i feel responsibility\nto be able to get this message out in a\nway that won't get to people\nthat can never become monks or that\nwon't become\ndisproportionately high educated\nphilosophical\ni'm in the trenches with my style but\nit's the same [ __ ]\nproduct and so 400 trillion to one was\none way for me to get people to be like\ndo you [ __ ]\nunderstand\nthere's nothing any of us in this room\nwill accomplish that is even in the\n[ __ ] galaxy\nof that we having a chance to do\nsomething yeah i just don't understand\nwhat are you gonna complain about today\nthat is even remotely close to never\nhaving the ability to have a life\nlike what what are you going to complain\nabout like what's so shitty in your life\nlike you've got the at-bat even if\nyou're\nthe worst ranked person 7.7 billion\nin the world you're born to slavery\nand genocide in a fifth world country\nwhere you're raped\nevery day starved slaved lose your\nparents\nno love the game of life\nactually still creates the rare\npotential\nfor you to break out of that and go on\nto do something\nand then bring positivity to the world\nbetter than not being born at all i\nbelieve that\nand so that\nlove it man mike drop thank you gary\nthank you you're the best man thank you\nthis is amazing guys we all knew that\nthis was going to be an incredible\npodcast but that just blew the roof off\nit was one of those it was such a\nrevelation\nand that's what i loved about this\npodcast that it wasn't a q a it wasn't a\nthought process of revelation i felt\nlike\nyou were revealing things as you\nreflected and introspected and\nmore was brewing up can i say one last\nthing i think might be funny\nhearing you say that yeah what comes to\nmind is this is historically what i've\ndone completely predicated\non the respect i have for the other\nindividual\nwhen i i've always been fascinated by\na lot of people early on in my career is\nlike you steamroll everybody\ni'm like because i don't respect them or\nbecause i know what they're gonna say\nand i just have that ability to\ninterrupt which i'm trying to work on\nuh you know i revealed and wanted to go\ndeeper\nbecause i respect you and more\nimportantly your audience\num so i enjoyed it yeah and my admins\nare looking at me like crazy because\neveryone's freaking out\nso let's get out of here thank you man\nthank you bro\nthat was amazing yeah thank you man if\nyou want even more videos\njust
