these\nexperiences\nhave been there for a reason and i i\ndon't regret anything i don't pity\nanything i just feel like that's\nsomething that i had to go through\nand i think it's so beautiful that you\nare mentoring other\nserbian talents and tennis players\nbecause i think that's what everyone\nneeds they need a\na guiding hand they need someone who's\nbeen there we need to share\nabsolutely yeah and i think so much of\nthe time we live in this scarcity\nmindset even with the deals\npeople say things like oh it's good for\nyou right now but it might not be later\nso make the most of it and and then that\nintention is fueling people's\ntrue you know greedy mentality like oh\nnow is the time you've got to use it\notherwise you know\ni know i know because i i i've been\nand and still trying to learn how to\nmanage this myself\nbecause i have also lots of\nopportunities and being number one of\nthe world and\ntennis is a global sport and everything\nbut you know\ni i'm kind of going through the this\nthis\num kind of centering\nprocess of understanding what i need to\nyou know\ndo in order to organize my life better\nin order to focus on\nwhat is the most important you know\naspect of my existence\nhere you know the the the inner peace\nyou know the spiritual growth the\nunderstanding of of\nself and and of course the family the\nclose ones\nbut you know for for

i've been i've been\nthinking firstly that ego is the enemy\nbut\nactually now i'm i'm kind of more\nleaning towards the theory that\nthat ego is is it should\nbe befriended you know it should be\nyou know part of your process\nof thinking of feeling and\nand and in this way you are also\ndisarming your ego in a way right\nrather than kind of trying to reject it\nand then you creating this and this is\nit's so much\nyou know what we are actually going\nthrough out in an outside world as well\nright yeah\nabsolutely yeah so let me introduce you\nand then i'll explain why i did it\nbecause i think

in\nvery similar ways even though we you\nknow i'm an athlete\nuh but i i don't like to categorize or\nlabel myself as an athlete you know as\nsociety likes\num i think we we expand much more than\nthat\nand uh social media and and uh\ninternet is is great if you use it in\nthe right way\nso i i feel like it's it's a great\nplatform\nit got us connected and we're here today\nuh and and not a while ago i've sent you\na message on instagram because i'm\ni'm your fan i follow of course i follow\nyour message and i follow your energy\nand everything that you've been\nspreading and and sharing with people so\nuh\ni'm just happy to to get deep and talk\nabout\nuh you know things that i usually don't\nget asked\non the tennis tournaments so it's it's\nreally exciting\nabsolutely absolutely and that's what i\nlove about you and that's what i'm\nexcited for everyone who's listening and\nwatching\nis that you are an athlete but what i\nwas saying to you earlier is\nyou are so much more and you have so\nmuch more to give you've worked so\nhard on the court but what i love about\nyou is that you're also an inner athlete\nlike you're doing this inner work and\nand you've really focused on growing\nyourself healing yourself working on\nyourself so let's dive into all of that\ntoday\nmake this the interview when you make\nthis the interview where you get to talk\nabout everything that's important to you\nand that's why this podcast actually\nstarted i was speaking at an event last\nyear\nand tom brady was speaking before me and\nhe was interviewed by a sports\njournalist\nand the conference was actually about\nbuilding meaningful lives\nso i was asked to speak about that topic\ntom was speaking before\nand the interviewer asked him a question\nand tom started speaking about his\nfamily\nhe started talking about being a father\nhe started talking about all these\nbeautiful values and responsibilities\nand and how he's growing now that his\nsports career is\nis coming to a you know a natural end\netc\nand the sports journalists just said to\nhim they said tom\nleave all this soft stuff let's talk\nabout the sports\nand and i felt so bad for him because i\njust felt like he was really trying to\nopen up his heart\nand the sports journalist was almost\njust squashing all of that and saying\nlet's just talk about your rings like\nlet's talk about the medals\nand so i wanted to build a platform\nwhere people like yourself\nand people from music media movies film\neveryone\ncan actually come and talk about your\ndeeper sides\nand and your real heart so i want you to\nfeel really comfortable to be able to do\nthat today\ni am very much are definitely one of the\nvery few people that\nuh in my life and that i've\nknown you know thus far and and of\ncourse\nuh that i'm following that i can share\nthis message with and i i i truly mean\nthat because\nand i i don't mean that in a bad way for\nthe society i'm not judging i don't like\nthe judgment i don't like that you know\nthe word hatred or anything like that i\nyou know\ni i respect everyone and and we i\nrespect also this kind of uh\nmoment in time that we as people are\nyes you know and our society is where it\nis\nuh with a reason and we just have to go\nthrough that stage of development i\nthink and\nan evolution and uh it took me time to\nreally\ni feel like come to that understanding\nin a way\nbecause i was also for many years\nthrough my character building process\nand spiritual development and kind of\nopening my mind\nto different dimensions and horizons of\nof you know self-awareness and self-care\ni i was just feeling um\na lot of times uh lonely you know and\nand uh i just\nfelt like the what i was doing was not\nunderstood especially in my world\nand not just understood but it was not\naccepted which was uh\neven worse because then you know you're\nlabeled as a\nkind of like a black sheep you know in\nthe herd\nand and but i still wanted to play\ntennis and still stay in that in that\nin that sport in that uh you know field\nof life and which i have and i'm not\nyou know regretting contrary i'm so\nblessed\nto do what i love i've started playing\ntennis when i was four years old\num and my family did not have any tennis\ntradition so it was\nliterally a sign of a destiny\nthree tennis courts in front of my\nparents restaurant in a small\nmountain place in serbia called coponic\nmy father was sorry but giving you a\nlittle background yeah my family\num was a professional skier he was a\nskiing instructor that's how he met my\nmom\non the skiing slope and you know it's a\nfunny story you know she kind of like\ntell us that she you know she she was\nskiing and then she fell and then he was\nthere and he's like i\nneed to help he didn't trip i think i\ncan help you\nhe probably organized the whole thing\nyou know but uh\nbut you know that's how they met and you\nknow they they you know six months later\nthey got they got married and i was\nalready my mom was pregnant with me and\nand then\na year later they opened a restaurant in\nthe very mountain where they met\nand that's the the restaurant was the\nbusiness\nthat generated the you know the budget\nfor our family so we spent a lot of time\nthere\nbecause we lived uh three hours by car\naway in the capital city of serbia\nbelgrade where\ni i went to school and my two younger\nbrothers have two younger brothers\num their names are marco and georgia\ntheir\none is four years old younger than me\nand the other one is eight years younger\nthan me\nand this is like we talked about you\nknow my children and the indigo children\nthat kind of like a new wave of\nyou know of energy and consciousness and\nawareness that we're receiving from\nabove\nthrough children that already have you\nknow what we don't have\nyou know and that's what i see in my\nbrother you know\nand and he's been born with this\ncapacity and ability to just\nmultitask and deal with things so\nsuccessfully and still be happy and it's\nit's quite amazing\nso you know going back to to to my story\nis\nyou know i've i felt that in my world of\ntennis i just uh\nwhen you're a professional athlete um\nyou know it's all about winning or\nlosing right i\ni just i don't see losing or failure\nas as such i i see it as\nanother great lesson um that\nawaits for me to learn from did you\nalways have that even when you were\nyoung yeah no i just as i said i i went\nthrough my evolution\nand and uh i was fortunate really\nthat when i started playing tennis i\nran into and came across some really\nreally knowledgeable people\nabout tennis and about life in\nparticular\none woman and her name is yelena gentich\nshe's not with us anymore she passed\naway in 2012 but she was my tennis\nmother\nso my parents uh you know invested a lot\nof energy and efforts and\nin those times during 90s when i was\ngrowing up\nwe had two wars we had\nunfortunately war that broke down the\nwhole yugoslavian region because it was\nbig yugoslavian country very strong\nmade of you know six different states i\nmean countries that are\nright now independent i'm coming from\none of them which is serbia\nand uh and then during 90s from like 91\n92\nall the way till 2000 we had embargo\nso people waiting in line for bread and\nmilk and like\nabsolutely most you know necessary\nthings and\nthen 99 we had in serbia we had bombings\nfor two and a half months every single\nday and night\ni was there my family was there every\nsingle day we woke up every night for\ntwo and a half months\nbecause of the alarm and because of the\nplanes flying over us and\nit was it was devastating it was\nfrightening it was uh\nworst thing that that definitely we you\nknow we ever experienced\nuh you know seeing planes over your head\nand just dropping bombs and all you know\nhospitals and\nand everything it was just uh terrible\nmany innocent people died\nthankfully i i didn't lose personally\nanyone that is\nvery close to me uh but i know people\nthat lost\nyou know their loved ones and uh that's\na scar that stays with you forever\nso this memory stays and will stay with\nme forever but\num at the beginning i\nfelt like probably most of the people in\nmy country um\ni felt i want revenge\nyou know i felt like you know who are\nthese guys to bomb innocent people what\nthe hell is going on i was 12 years old\nand i remember\nuh i was there day and night and i\ncelebrated my 12th birthday\nduring the day because we didn't go to\nschools obviously it was just uh\nhiding in shelters and everything and\nthen we just after a week or two hiding\nin shelters\nwe just said okay we're just gonna you\nknow go about our life\nand that's it you know we don't we're\nnot gonna care what happens\nif you know if we're hit we're hit you\nknow what we can do\ni mean and so i remember on my 12th\nbirthday\nuh kids were singing my friends at the\ntennis club because we spent a lot of\npla\na lot of times playing tennis because we\nwe didn't go to school so for us it was\ngreat\nand uh and then we we they were singing\nthe happy birthday song and there was a\nplane flying and i have this image and i\nwas playing\nand just kind of dropping bombs\neverywhere and it was\nit's terrible but at the same time i\ni've i felt like as as i was\nkind of growing you know inside out as\nwell\ni felt and i think my parents helped me\na lot with that\nis that they you know we can't\njudge the whole nation or everyone\nfor the actions of certain individuals\nor certain\ngroups or institutions or whatever that\ndecided to\nbomb our country and just kill innocent\npeople we can't\nyou know judge everyone for that you\nknow\nand and that's that's when i kind of\nlike shifted and i just i\nright you know this moment absolutely\nforgiven\neveryone and everything that has done\nthat but\nyou cannot forget that you know you\ncannot forget that it stays as i said as\na scar\nbut it has on a brighter side brought a\nlot of\nvalue to my life and a lot of\nappreciation for the value\ni felt like this experience i'm so\ngrateful for this experience i truly am\nbecause\nit has helped me to shape me into the\nperson that i am today\nthe player tennis player that i am it\nhas made me hungrier for\nthe success in tennis made me hungrier\nto\nwork train build myself so i can show to\nthe world that\nyou know kid from you know war torn\ncountry\ncan actually be the best in in a sport\nthat is very global\nand uh and and so that's that's what\nhappened but all of these experiences\nhave definitely uh\nbeen there for a reason and i i i don't\nregret\nanything i don't pity anything i just\nfeel like\nokay you know that's that's my karma you\nknow that's something that i had to go\nthrough and i had to\nlive uh that and and and and\nif we manage to get through that as not\njust as a family but as\npeople as a nation you know there's\nthere's not much that can break you down\nso\nyou know historically you know serbian\npeople and people in the region have\nhave had a lot of\nyou know hard wars and hardships and\nand and they've been through that so\nit's it's really was really nice to see\nthe\nthe unity with people and i remember one\nof the i was actually talking the other\nday with with my brother and my wife\nabout\nstill reflecting on that stay on that\nperiod and what was the strongest\nimage that stayed with us from this\nbombings of two and a half months in 99\nand one of them for me was obviously the\none that i explained\nto you with that with a birthday and\nshelters but there was one\nwhere i remember uh\nthousands of people gathering on the\nbridge one of the most important bridges\nin\nin our city uh with uh shirts\nuh that that have targets there and\neveryone painted their heads with tar\nlike like in a in a shape of a target\nand\nsinging songs and you know kind of just\nenjoying having fun and in a way showing\nto the world\nand to whoever is you know uh\nyou know kind of kind of dropping bombs\nthat we are the target so\nwe are protecting this bridge we are\nprotecting this this city\nyou know if you want to crash it you\nhave to go through us and and it was\ni think more than that it was just that\nthat that power of unity you know that\nthat energy and that strength that they\njust showed their resilience\nand that was beautiful you know in in\nthose moments of hardship\nthat's incredible man that's that's such\na\ni've heard you tell that story i'm\nsidetracked from your quest\nno and i've no no i'm glad you did\nbecause i've heard that story before i'm\nglad that everyone who hasn't heard that\nstory before has an opportunity now\nand and the reason why it's so beautiful\nis because\nthat's probably like most of the planet\ndoes not experience that\nthat's that's pretty extreme yes right\nand so for someone like you to come from\nthat\nextreme and especially what you said\nyour initial response was revenge\nfor you to be able to transform that\nrevenge into resilience\nthat's incredible because it would have\nbeen so much easier to just have that\npain and have that\nunforgiveness and so it was a great\nstory that\nthat um i've read and i'm sure it's\nquite popular on the social media\neveryone is sharing it\nit was about the snake and the in the\nsoul okay i don't know if you came\nacross it\nand it's you know the snake it's kind of\nit's true story actually the snake came\ninto the\nyou know carpenting's uh uh uh shop\nand um it it\nas as it was kind of going and it got\ncaught by a saw\nand the saw kind of cut it and the snake\ndidn't realize what was happening\nso it went to to bite to to yeah to bite\nthe saw\nand it hurt itself even more so\nthe snake didn't know what was happening\nso it started going around\nthe the saw in order to you know\nsuffocate it\nthinking that saw is attacking it so it\nwas\nyou know protecting itself and finally\nuh\nsnake died and and this kind of\ntranslates into life\nand it's so many times that we get angry\nor upset\nyou know with some people thinking that\nwe want to hurt them because we feel\nhurt but\nfinally we're hurting ourselves and and\nit was is such a deep\nmessage that i kind of like resonated\nwith really and i think that\nkind of sums up my evolution in a way\nand and and uh my growth uh\nmentally of how you know i i should deal\nwith these particular circumstances and\nin events that have been\nquite uh significant uh\nin my life and you know the wars and and\nthose times of\nyou know uh hardships were definitely\none of the most significant\nuh times of my life in my career\nwhere where i experienced uh what it\nfeels like to literally have\nten dollars in at home in the apartment\nwith\nwith uh you know for my father and my\nmother with three children\nto feed and uh having to wait in the\nline to get piece of bread\nfor hours and uh and not being able to\ntravel around the world\nto play tennis uh in tennis is\nexpensive sport absolutely and you know\nyou need\nmoney to pay for the record for the\ntennis balls for the coach for the\ncourt so all these things you know and\nand\nthey i think in the end of the day as i\nsaid\nit brings it brings light\nand value to my life because\nyou know i think going through all of\nthat has\nmade me stronger but at the same time\nmade me more\ngrateful because i understand the both\nextremes so to say because\ntoday i really uh i enjoy\nso much of you know\nsuccess in this you know society\nand the sport and i can afford many\nthings and i'm really really grateful\nfor that and blessed\nbut i've been on the on the opposite\nside so i think that\nthat storyline is is really something\nthat\nenriches me absolutely man and your your\nlife story is such a beautiful message\nto the world\nit's a great message to the world like\nit's it's incredible and i'm glad that\ni see when from the way i view it you\nyou live it like a message too it's not\nabout you\nthat's that's how i feel when i'm with\nyou that it's not about you it's not\nlike i did this\nit's actually a story and a message to\nthe world that you know\nany child any person who is in such\nabject conditions can actually transform\ntheir lives so thank you for being there\nthank you thank you and i i just feel\nlike you know the\nthe message i can share from my\nexperience and i don't want\never for people to feel that i'm\npreaching or anything like that i just\nfeel like my experience has helped me\nto reach you know certain success if you\nwant to call it you know um\nyeah in both professional and private\nuh way uh is is that there is always\ntime for everything and and you know\ni've i'm learning myself even today how\nto be patient\nhow to how to you know coordinate\ncertain things in my life how to\ncreate space for the biggest\nuh quality time that i can have with\nmy priorities which are my family which\nis my growth\nand it's and it's a constant juggle and\nyou can't you can't i\ni truly believe in balance but i don't\nbelieve that we can\never reach a stage and our point where\nwe can say i'm in balance\nyou you can be in balance but the next\nmoment you're not in balance because\nthat's life and everything is moving\nand it's happening so um so that's\nthat's why i feel like and then through\ntennis\ni i've learned my you know biggest and\nhardest lessons in life and i've\nexperienced those those emotions and for\nme you know tennis court\nis still a field\nyou know uh where where i have a chance\nto grow\nreally and i i when i'm not on the\ntennis court\ni find it much easier to\naccomplish certain things that that i\nwant to\non a daily basis but then tennis court i\nuse\nas exactly that platform that challenges\nme and challenges my ego\nso i still have for example outburst on\nthe court i break a record i scream like\ni i curse i know you don't curse at all\nand i admire that\namazing that you you took that wow you\ngot to teach me how to do it\nand uh and and and so when that happens\ninstantly i feel like oh my god why what\nwhat did i do\nyou know and i have two children you\nknow\nmany children around the world are\nwatching and and\nand you know seeing what you're doing\nand\nimitating you in a way so you're sending\nthat kind of message so i try always to\nhave that in back of my mind and you\nknow subconsciously like okay\nyou know try to do you know what you do\nbest but\ndo it with dignity do it with style do\nit you know with always having\nyou know that kind of inner voice\ntelling you you know\nthere's you know thousands you know of\nchildren around the world watching you\nplay right now\nand and absorbing like a sponge every\nmove everything you say everything you\ndo\nbut it's i still do it i still go\nthrough this outburst\nand i i felt uh disappointed with myself\nfor a while\nwow because of that i really felt like i\nwas betraying myself\ni was not managing to uh\nto do what i intended to do and uh and\nand then i learned about surrender and\nuh\nand then i learned about there is a time\nfor everything in life\nand uh there is a reason why we have to\ntake every step of the way in order to\nreach the top\nof in whatever way you you you feel that\ntop is\nis for you and uh and i and then i\nunderstood that\nyou know i have to accept i have to\nembrace i have to channel it and\nunderstand that\nyou know i still have to work and i have\nto work all the way to the last day\nthat i that i breathe and and and and\ni'm happy with that i i really feel like\ni\ni managed to take that positive leap\nin that direction what's you've touched\non a few times then i want to dive into\nit deeply you mentioned success reaching\nthe top\nthe world sees your success\nthe world sees your achievements but in\nnovak djokovic's eyes in your own eyes\nwhat's been your greatest success your\ngreatest achievement\nso far in your perspective it's a good\nquestion\nmy greatest achievement is my open mind\ni i feel that\nwith an open mind mindless\ntype of you know perspective and\napproach to life\nyou help all the natural\nprocesses in yourself\nto flourish and to excel\nand you're embracing the natural flow of\nlife where you have to evolve and you\nhave to develop and you have to learn\nand i just if i have to define it that\nkind of shortly i i would say it's it's\njust\nopen mind because i feel\nthe ignorance and the close-mindedness\nand and certain convictions that that\npeople have\nuh are so strong that\nyou know you you go through throughout\nyour whole lifetime\nwithout really allowing you know\nyourself to\nopen up to the world and learn about\nall these different cultures and things\nthat can enrich your life and make you\nfeel more fulfilled and live a more\nfulfilled life\nbe more joyful have that inner peace\nand emotional balance and stability that\nwe all strive to\nand and i just feel with an open mind\nyou're just helping yourself\nand you're able to receive uh kind of\nfilter\nand then you know give at the same time\nbecause\nyou know the taurus field everything has\nto flow so that's how it flows but\nif you don't have an open mind then\nobviously\nyour everything closes up whether it's\nhealth whether it's\nyou know profession whatever it is in\nyour life it just kind of feels\nand i was there i i was there i don't\nwant people to think that i\ni know it all or whatever i just feel\nyou know\nalso that i'm sharing the experiences\nfrom my process because i was there as i\nsaid i felt\nyou know resentment i felt you know\nfeeling of\nrevenge i felt hatred i did i felt all\nof that\nwe all you know go through that we're\nall human beings we you know kind of\nyou know experience those kind of\nemotions but\ni feel with training and repetition\nand discipline that obviously sport has\ntaught me so well\nyou can really reach anything that you\ntruly want in desire in your life\nand where did that open-mindedness start\nlike where did you start to notice that\nthe closed mind was\nlimiting you and the open mind was\nexpanding\ni think very early to be honest\never since i kind of\nwished to play tennis right when i was\nfour or five years old\nand tennis was never a sport in our\nfamily\ni think you know i kind of help also my\nparents to\nexpand you know outside of their in a\nway comfort zone and going to the sport\nor field of life that is completely\nunknown to them in a way\nand i think that uh uh you know i i\nstarted playing tennis with four and a\nhalf i think five years old and\nbefore that i was uh i was skiing a lot\nand i i remember\neven before i started to run i was\nalready with my dad\nyou know skiing he was carrying me and\ngoing down the slopes and\nand so the first sport for me was king\nright and\nuntil i was i think nine years old i\ndidn't really know whether i want to ski\nor play tennis\ni was football soccer a little bit there\nbut it was mostly about skiing or tennis\nand uh and unfortunately i mean we've\nbeen through all this and my father\nmy father asked me i remember i remember\nthat that day when he sat me down\nwith my mom and he said\ni am ready to support anything that you\ndesire to do\nin your life and i'm here for you\nbut you have to tell me if it's sport\nokay and what sport and uh\nand i said okay give me one thing i\nneeded to\nyou know and a big decision yeah i mean\nand then you get an investment i was\nthinking and then i said like\nit didn't take me a long time i thought\ni said maybe just a little time to think\nbut then\nafter half an hour i went to him and i\nsaid it's tennis right\nand he said okay tennis it is and and\nthen\ni think us kind of getting into this\num uncomfortable unknown\nzone or area or field of life has\nallowed us to kind of expand all of us\nand and also\nhaving certain mentors and people that\nhave\ngreatly positively affected me\non many levels my wife mentioned my\ntennis mother as i like to\ncall her um i've met her when i\nwas i think five six years old and then\ni started training with\nher tennis camp summer tennis camp that\nwas coming from\nbelgrade from capital city to coponic\nthis place in the mountains\nand then when i was i think six seven\ni also started having some private\nlessons with her in belgrade while i was\nyou know going to school and she was\nhappy to\nto to play with me because she felt like\ni was very talented and then she told\nshe told my parents she said i really\nfeel like\nyou should try to give your best to\nsupport this child to play tennis\nbecause i've never seen a bigger talent\nuh from than him from monica selish who\nwas uh\nyou know obviously the best tennis\nplayer in the world and one of the best\nfemale tennis players of all times\nand she was her coach as well and\nbecause monica was born in serbia and\nthen she went to\nto live in states where she is today and\nuh and of course my parents were like\nwell\nif if such a experienced and\nknowledgeable person about\nthe tennis says that then you know we\nshould try to\nsupport our child so that's what\nhappened and\ni remember i was watching you know\ntennis practices and sessions on the\nfence i was climbing i was really really\nin love with the sport i was very\npassionate about it\nand she taught me uh about holistic\napproach to life i think wow already\nback then when i was seven eight\nshe really taught me how to you know\nthink about\nthe grades in the school the music that\ni listen to\nthe mindfulness that i have the\nobservation the focus\nthe kindness the relationship with\npeople she was working\nin in a team with my parents and my\nparents\nyou know i'm really grateful for my\nparents because they recognized the role\nof a mentor\nvery early on so they they kind of\nteamed up with her\nand then you know i was learning a lot\nfrom from from my parents\nobviously and continued to learn and\nfrom from my tennis mother so\nthat has helped me to i feel like\nbe open-minded and and and understand\nbut\ni obviously went through my phases and\nyou know through through the process of\nlearning and\nthose dealing with those emotions\nalthough i felt when i started\ntraveling by myself because i was\ntraveling with my father until i was i\nthink\n16 and then 6 17 i started having my\ncoach and\nand and i you know i didn't get too deep\nin the conversations with my dad and\nwith my mom and i felt\nthere are some subjects and that\nyou know i want to talk about and\nespecially in\nyou know puberty and teenage years you\nknow you're experiencing so many changes\nand and i was so much in tennis that i\ndidn't really have time for for\nother maybe school activities that my\nfellow friends and you know students\nwere going through\nuh because i was so much in tennis and\nand then i i started sharing so much\nwith with my coach\ni think that i remember my dad was like\nwhy don't you\nshare that with me and i was like\nbecause i don't\ni don't feel that i've first of all i've\nnever shared that\nthose particular subjects and types of\nconversations with you and\ni don't i don't feel we can we we can\nresonate on that level and and we tried\nbut we\nit never worked out so but he was\nunderstanding and that i also have to\nhave you know people that\nthat are close to me and then influence\nme on different levels\nand and that's what i feel like helped\nme a lot to uh to develop\nwow and one of the things i noticed\nabout you is also and i'd love to get\nyour thoughts on this\ni feel like it's tough to get to the top\nbut it seems to be even tougher to get\nto the top have a slump or have a moment\nof challenge and then try and get back\nbecause you've experienced something and\nit's like i know that you've even\ncredited your wife\nwith her dedication to self-care\nand your work and what she's trained you\nor shared with you in journaling\ntell us about the bit about the process\nthat you've taken\nto be at the top have challenges and\nthen still come back because everyone's\nbeen quoting obviously having the\nimpossible comeback and\nbut you made it possible what was\nhappening mentally\nspiritually for you not just physically\nbut what was happening mentally and\nspiritually for you\nwell first of all to reflect on the\nimpossible word\nin in the word you have i am possible\nright\nso i i truly i don't believe in and you\nknow\nsomething is impossible i really really\neverything is possible as we talked\nabout it earlier\nuh my wife has been um\nyou know my girlfriend for a long time\never since\ni was 18 she was 19 that's that's when\nwe\nstarted dating and uh she used to play\ntennis\nand that's how we met and we've known\neach other four or five years before we\nstarted dating\nand you know through tennis and and then\nshe went to study in italy\nin milan and i came at more or less the\nsame time here in monaco\nto follow my my coach at the time and i\nstarted using monaco as a base\nand she came over milan is close to\nmonaco so she came over and that's how\nit all started and when she finished\nstudies she was obviously\nyou know thinking she had a lot of\nopportunities for her own career but she\nsacrificed that in order to live my\ncareer live my dream\nin order to save the relationship in a\nway so i'm very grateful for\nfor for her and what she has you know um\ndone for our relationship and for me\nand i've i learned i keep on continue to\nlearn from her so much\nshe introduced me to yoga actually\nback in uh back in the days when she was\nuh studying\nand she is a huge reader she likes to\nread\neverything and anything and she you know\nlikes to write as well and she was\nbeing big on journaling all the time and\ni remember when i was\nquite young from my tennis mother and\nfrom my parents i learned how to\nkind of write and have specific things\nthat i want to share\non the paper i did it you know kind of\nlike what i'm grateful for and things\nlike that\nwhich was nice but then i lost that i i\ndidn't do it for many\nyears and then she reminded me of that\nso i i started doing it again\nand and and it felt great because i felt\nlike i could\nrelease a lot of things that were\ntensing me up\nthrough germany through writing exactly\nright but also through yoga\nyou know she learned about it she\nbecause she was so stressed\nduring her you know uh studies\num she spent the whole day obviously\nstarting with books and\nyou know student life isn't easy so she\nwas looking into ways how she can relax\nherself\nget more energy and you know she was she\nwas not drinking coffee or any of these\nthings\nso she came into yoga and she was\nsharing it with me so i started doing it\nwith her\nyou know the whole the breathing\npranayama\nthe you know the the sun salutations and\neverything and and that's ever since\nthen we've been doing obviously some\nform of yoga\nyou know try on a daily basis and and um\nyou know she she's been a very a\nvery significant integral part of of my\nlife and my\nmy evolution and what i'm really\ngrateful for\nis that not only that we you know truly\nlove each other and we are very\ntransparent and honest\nbut also that we have help from the\nuniverse to\nactually be in a very similar state of\nconsciousness\nin certain phases of our lives so we can\nhelp each other\nlearn better and grow faster\nin in certain areas with that we choose\nthat are\nyou know uh you know part of those\nparticular periods so yeah\nso i think uh she would agree that\nwhen we became parents uh four years ago\nthat has completely shifted our world\nyou know upside down up to that moment\nwe were also spiritual but\nyou know still quite basic comparing to\nwhat has happened after that\nand we truly believe that our kids are\nour masters\nand our teachers and then they come to\nthis life to\nbring bring lessons for us\nand bring help for us to understand\na lot of things about ourselves in the\ndeeper levels and what we have to work\non\nwhich is is quite contrary to what you\nknow in a way\nyeah society which is like we are\nteaching them\nwhich we are of course but you know\nactually i've been i've been talking\nwith her a lot about that\nand and now we we have a baby girl that\nis one year old\nand and she i was mentioning she's a\nhealer she really is and she brings that\nkind of\nenergy to this world and she has\nyeah i mean skyrocketed our\nattention for the moments for you know\nthe consciousness the awareness about\neverything i mean even more and we're\nlike oh my god\nyou know there's another level there's\nanother level so we you know we help\neach other grow and i think we\nit's it's i'm really grateful that i can\nshare with her\nliterally everything and anything that\ni'm interested in\nthat i'm going through and you know she\nshe has been always the shoulder to to\nlean on and she has always been there\nand tough moments for me in my career\nwhen i was you know going through an\ninjury recently\nand i had to take six months break down\nthe tennis and\nand then when i came back i was like\nquestioning whether i should\nkeep on playing on that level or not and\ni was\njust going through you know just going\nthrough hard work inside and\nand then she you know she was there and\nshe helped me to overcome all of that\nuh of course with uh alongside with help\nof uh\nsome uh uh life spiritual teachers that\ni have that i can yeah a little bit\num well there are two guys in particular\nuh jose pepe maz and and jar koilich\num jose pepe is from from spain and\njacques from uh from serbia and they i\nconsider them really as\nas my spiritual and life teachers my\nmasters\nthat i've learned a lot from and back in\ni think 2010 or 11 i've met\njarko so about seven eight years ago and\nuh\ni met him through my wife actually\nbecause my wife had a friend that\nknew him and and that's how we got into\nit he's uh\nhe's a reiki healer uh but he's much\nmore than that\nand you know he he helped a lot\nboth my wife and i to uh\nagain open our mind even more to\nunderstand how\nwe can have internal conversations with\nourselves\nbecause i i didn't know how to do it i\ndidn't know how to verbalize\nmy emotions and that's where my wife was\nahead of me and that's where we\nstruggled in our relationship because\nshe was trying to dig\nthings out for me and make me share more\nbut i wasn't\nable to do that because i didn't know\nhow she's like\nspeak to me what do you feel i'm like\ni don't know i feel something i just\ndon't and\nand so i think jacques was was very\nhelpful in that\nand uh and and sounds like everyone\nneeds that\neveryone yeah i mean everyone needs that\nof course but\ni think you know there's this great\nsaying\nyou know when the when when the student\nis ready the teacher will come\nright yeah so i i felt that\nthe first initial step i needed to do i\nneeded to decide\nin my mind internally that okay this is\nexactly what i need for my heart for my\nsoul\nfor my for my growth this is the the\npriority\ni have to learn how to manage myself\nmy emotions how to not just to be a\nbetter tennis player\nbut to be a better human being and um\nand so\nso then the teacher appeared obviously\nand\nand then after that obviously i i i\nstart to expand my\nmy awareness and and you know\nobservation of the world\nand then i run into pepe who is very\nclose\nperson and and also a spiritual life\nteacher to my brother\nmarco and they live in the same place\nactually marco my brother went to live\nin spain because of pepe\nwow and pepe's whole philosophy of life\nis love and peace and\nand uh he brought that\nkind of energy into our lives the perspe\nperception of love and peace what it\nreally means\nand at the beginning i i was actually uh\nnot really supportive i must say of my\nbrother because he started doing that\nbefore me he started going through\nthis whole process of learning with with\npepe\nand he moved to spain so he can be\ncloser to him because he felt\nyou know deep inside that something is\nvery important that he has to address\nuh and i just i didn't get it at that\ntime i i thought well you know you have\nto because he was playing professional\ntennis i was like you can't really\nyou know just love and peace you know\nyou have to kind of like\ngo back and train and yeah this have\nthis mindset if you're loving peace on\nthe court the other guy will beat you\nand this is what it comes down to you\nknow\nin in sports and he was like listen i i\nhe's like i understand but\ni trust me i have to go through this and\ni just feel\nthat this is my growth and i did i\ndidn't understand it at the time and\nthen i\nbut i was attracted to pepe because i i\nfelt that his energy was amazing and\nyou can never get upset with him you\nknow you speak to him he's like you you\nknow\nyou he always smiles and everything you\nknow even when we have tough\nconversations he always smiles and sends\nbecause he always prays inside and sends\nyou love\nyeah and for that he had to work and\nstill continues to work\ni mean immensely and i didn't understand\nwhat\nhe kept on emphasizing inner work inner\ngrowth\ninner work inner growth universal love i\nreally\ni didn't really get it you know and then\nand then then obviously uh uh this whole\nenergy\nattracted my wife and i and and we\nconnected with pepe and with my brother\nand\ndifferent levels and and today you know\nobviously we understand\nyou know what what he truly what he\ntruly means\nbecause we embraced that work yes and we\nhave to do it daily\nyes and i just wanted to shortly reflect\non on that inner work\nfor the purpose or goal my goal for the\ninner work\nup to not while ago was tennis\nwow and that and and i the the\nfeeling inside you can call it ego\nwhatever\nhas drawn me to that sensation of i\nneed to do this because that will help\nme play better tennis\nbut it didn't resonate something i was\nliving a successful life but not\nfulfilled\nyes if you know what i mean yeah uh and\nand there was something wrong with that\ni i just felt i\ni felt the answers of that truth and the\nessence and what it really means\nto to to do that on daily basis for\nyourself\nand your growth as a human being and not\njust as a tennis player or a doctor or\nwhatever\nbut i it wasn't it was weaker comparing\nto the other side which was\nsince i was seven i'm going i dreamed of\nbeing number one of the world that's my\nambition that's my lifetime goal\ni have to fulfill it when i fulfilled it\nin 2011\ni kept on going i just i want to be more\ngrand slam\ni have war grand slam trophies i want to\nbe number one for as long as i can\nit just kept going and i believe that\nfrom my experience you need goals and\nobjectives\nyou know and it but you need to\nbalance that with you know\nwhat is truly the most important work\nwhich is the inner work\nyes and and uh i didn't get it up to up\nto not a while ago to be honest\nand that's when i start to get it and\nthat's when i start to understand the\nmessage from pepe\nhe was whatever you do you do it with\nexcitement with joy with passion\nbut at the same time never forget\nabout what you have to do before during\nand\nafter that which is a much much bigger\nwork and longer work\nand and not now now i do truly\nunderstand that yeah give us give us\nso for anyone who's listening and\nthey're like no like i'm like you i\ndon't get it yeah\nyeah you know because so many people\ntoday i feel like spirituality energy\nall of these words are flying around the\ninternet people are talking about it but\nthere's so many people that don't get it\nexplain to us in your own way in the way\nyou see it\nwhat is inner work and what inner work\nyou do\nwhat you were saying that before that\nduring that after that has helped you\nnot just in tennis you've talked so\nand reflected so wonderfully on this in\nso many of your videos\nabout the habits about the addictions\nthat we have\nthe whole day passes by we're not we\ndon't\neven remember a single moment in the day\nbecause\nwe've just been distracted the whole\ntime so\nyou know if we are learned and trained\nto be distracted that's how\nyou know our life is going to unfold\nwe're going to be distracted\nbut if we train ourselves to be present\nand more aware then obviously we're\nshifting the attention of the\nsubconscious and all the\ninternal external energies and nature\nand everything into that\nyou know in a simplified way work on the\nhabits\nright i i mean i have you know still\nsome habits that need working on\nyou know and and uh you know it you know\nfor example the phone right yeah that\nthat is so addictive and you get into\ninstagram that i by the way love i love\nit\nit's great fantastic uh it's how we\nconnect yeah\nyeah but but if you let it\nbecome your master then\nthat's how it's going to be and you're\ngoing to be distracted you're going to\nfeel lack of energy\nyou're going to feel lack of inner peace\nyou're going to feel\nupset you know you're going to have a\nshort breath\nyou know all these different things and\nthat reflects on relationships that\nreflects on\nyou know your performance at your work\nor whatever you're doing\nand and for me i i try to okay\ntry to think inside okay what am i doing\nright\non the tennis court how can i translate\nthat\nand off the tennis court interesting and\nthe on tennis court\nwhat i'm doing right is complete 100\nfocus and presence of mind and body and\neverything\ndiscipline working towards\nobjective organ organized\npreparing myself this is a big thing i\nfeel you know\nif you fail to prepare you prepare\nyourself to fail right absolutely\nso preparation is a huge thing i mean at\nleast\nin in my world for tennis it has helped\nme a lot\nbecause i i don't want to put a number\non it but let's say\n80 to a 90 of your the match that you\nwant for example or any success\nbefore you stepped on the course exactly\nyeah exactly\nhow you do your homework uh for you know\nin in my instance\nyou know um obviously working on all my\nstrengths and weaknesses uh preparing\nmyself\nphysically mentally emotionally\nspiritually\nfor the match that is coming up i have\nthe whole\nuh short term and long term plan how can\ni get\nfrom from here to there in the shortest\ntime\nthose type of things and then\nyou know obviously doing your homework\non the guy on the opponent that you're\nplaying against\nwhere you're going to play the stadium\nthe crowd the weather\nyou know it's it's really\nwhole homework that you have to do in\norder before you get in and\nand then you win a tennis match and then\nit's not only about the tennis match\nit's 89 of the work that you do\nprior to that so that's why i believe\nyou know preparation\nis a big big thing working on the habits\nyou know the science says that you need\n20 what two or three days that you you\ncan you know shift\nyou know from bad habit to a healthy\nhabit so we need persistency we need\ndiscipline\nyou know we need we need repetition and\nbruce lipton that i\nalso like to listen to a lot he he was\ntalking about subconscious right and how\nsubconscious is controlling probably 90\n95\nof our everyday life so if we can\nfeed our subconscious with the\ninformation that\nis going to allow us to excel and to\nlive the life that we want to\nthen that's what's going to happen\nbecause your subconscious doesn't know\nwhat's\ngood for you or bad for you it just\nknows what you tell it\nyes and and there's the seeds that you\nplant so\nso he was talking about you know uh\nthere are two ways to kind of\nhack your subconscious which is hypnosis\nwhich happens from\nyou know up until you know you're seven\nyears old\nand and then repetition so that's why i\nmean\nmy wife and i are very passionate for\nthe preschool\neducation and early childhood\ndevelopment until you're six or seven\nyears old that's when\nit's most vast brain growth and that's\nwhere you know\nthe the fundamentals and the foundation\nof your life\nis set and and that's where you know\nbruce was talking about it really\nbeautifully and and\nit made sense and and then after year\nseven\nit's repetition it's discipline okay\num i'm switching off all my phones\nafter a certain hour i'm you know doing\nmy praying work\nuh because i believe in the invisible\nworld\nscience proves quantum science talks\nabout it\nwhere most distance points are actually\none in in in a split second and\nand we we all have proven that and so\nyou just need to really believe it in\norder to achieve it\nyou know where your attention you know\nwhere your attention goes the energy\nflows\nand and i think it all starts with open\nmind and you have to i think with a\nquestion\nit's always so great to ask yourself\nquestions\nwho am i why i'm here what i want to do\nwhat i want to become\nwhat i wa you know just all these\nquestions put on the paper write it down\ngo through it you know in your mind\nthrough that whatever your\nmethod is but you just have to address\nit\nif you don't address it you're going to\ngo about the same things that you went\nabout and then you're going to get the\nsame outcome\nthat you don't desire so i feel like\nthat\nkind of uh awareness about that uh\njust helps you know helps learn\nand you know i'm learning from you so\nmuch on a daily basis as well because\nyou know i obviously follow your work\nand and there's so many great messages\nout there and i feel like\nthis is the time where we can expand our\nconsciousness and get closer to what\nwho we are because you know the the two\nmost important\nand all this probably questions on this\nplanet ever since the existence of\nhumans is\nyou know who we are and why we are here\nabsolutely so\ni think also the truth seeking um\nelement and part is also\nquite important in that i mean i\nconsider myself a truth seeker i i like\nto\nyou know try to dig even deeper and\ndeeper and deeper and understand\nwho we are you know why are we here is\nthis a planet is this a realm what is it\nyou know is this a matrix is it not you\nknow i\ni think it's it's important to us ask\nthese questions and and get\nand do your research and dig deep into\nthat because although\nyou know i i think it all comes down to\nyou know whether you are your\nown master or or not\nso i think if you are your own master\nthen it allows you\nto take actions the way you want them\nrather than\nyou know i love the gym quick that i\nalso like very much\nand he he talks about\nthe thermostat and thermometer so\nthat don't be determines that but be the\nterminator set your the temperature set\nyou you set this temperature of the room\nand you set it up the way you wanted it\nand thermostat if you set it\nthen you have to adjust so it's reactive\nand i think it's such a such a great\nwisdom yeah\ngreat advice man i loved what you were\nsaying earlier that's that's great\nadvice and i hope everyone's listening\nis\nis taking notes but that what you said\nearlier i loved you said that for a long\ntime you believed ego is the enemy\nyes and then now you've started to\nunderstand that actually the ego has to\nbe befriended yes and i thought i was\ni i couldn't agree with you more i\ncouldn't agree with you more sometimes i\nbelieve the ego is like\na perfect mirror to yourself in the self\nthat you don't want\nbut at least it starts teaching you the\nego can teach you so much if you're\naware of it so i want to hear your\nperception on how you've been switching\nbetween egos the enemy to actually\nbefriending the ego\nwell this is because you've got every\nreason to have a big year like you've\ngot every reason and you're not you're\nvery humble person but you've got\nevery reason and i do have it and i do\nhave it and this is this is the point\ni didn't understand it at the time and\nwe talked about it a little bit and\nas you reflected i do have a big ego\nbut i have to embrace it and\nand and learn how to befriend it and\ndeal with it in in a ways that\nthat i'm to work going to work and team\nup with my ego rather than\ni'm going to be an enemy of my ego\nbecause then\nagain i'm reacting then ego can\nyou know persuade you and do different\nthings and and mask\nyou know certain things is so smart and\nwitty\nand then you have to react and then you\nhave to just kind of like\ntry to try to handle and juggle so many\nthings\ninstead of hey let's team up you're\ninside of me\ni'm you you're me okay let's figure this\nout\nhow can we work together and you kind of\nhave to\nyou know please it and at the same time\nyou have to control it\nand even though i don't really like the\nworld word control\ni still feel like you know\nif you if you create your controlled\nenvironment it's going to be\nbetter off for you in your life yeah\ni've got so what i what i finish off\nwith every interview is called my final\nfive so the five\nthe first five so these are fast five\nquestions yes they're you have to answer\nso the first question i was going to\nanswer is uh what's the first thing that\nyou do every morning\nfirst thing that i do every morning is\nprayer\nbeautiful second question what do you\npray for first i express my gratitude\nfor for my body for myself\nfor the opportunity to continue my\nevolution\nas a multi-dimensional being\nin this realm i am grateful for my\nfamily i'm grateful for\nbeing able to have my senses and to have\nbig bed and to have a most beautiful\nsunrise every morning\nit's amazing third how do you make sure\nthat your energy\nis where you want it to be spiritually\ninternally\num continuing to work\non um the things that we we talked about\num so aside of the physical work and\ntennis\nuh and and duties as a father\nand a husband i need to get in\ndaily something in my self-care\nwork whether it's only a meditation or\nit's a two-minute\nbreathing prayer whatever it is\nsometimes it's only that\nbecause you don't have time but you know\nit's important to just\nkind of you know keep keep doing it and\nbe disciplined with it\nwhat's the best advice you've ever\nreceived\nbe open-minded\ni love that theme that's the theme of\nthis the opening is just like a theme\nfor sure\nit's when you're open-minded then you're\nready to receive\neverything that we're surrounded with in\nsuch a beautiful world and we're so\nblessed\nuh that we live in this world and that\nwe\ngo through the process of evolution and\ni think when you come\nclose to the realization of you know who\nyou are\ni think and you continue to seek for\nthat truth i\njust it brings you closer to the source\nfrom where you\narrived and just makes you makes you so\npresent and makes you so calm\nand it makes you so joyful and grateful\nfor\nyourself for people around you for\neverything that you have\nthat you do that surrounds you that\nfulfills you\ni feel that that's the essence of our\nlife\namazing and the fifth question fifth and\nfinal question is if your racket was a\nmagic wand\nand you could get the whole world to\nunderstand one thing what would you want\neveryone to understand\nthat our consciousness expands\ninfinitely beautiful\nstraight to the point what do you mean\nby that what do you want them to\nunderstand for you\nand i'm going to give you the\nopportunity oh my gosh we don't have\nenough time\n[Laughter]\nthat our conscious expense infinitely\nmeans\nwell at least in my own perception is\nthat\nwe are more than we think\nor feel with our five senses than we\nreally are\nand when you i feel like\nwhen i came to this realization it just\nopened the door to a whole different\nuniverse and i mentioned to me\nand i feel that my evolution and my\ngrowth\nin every aspect of who i am and my\neverybody\nhas just quadrupled\nfor light years ahead i just feel i feel\ncalm at the same time but so excited\nfor everything that i that life has to\noffer that i can learn\nthank you novak we still have to do a\npart two please dive into all of that\nwe're gonna have to make it happen yeah\nthank you so much man i'm so grateful
