    "transcript": "[Music]\nand this same lesson has been taught to\nme in many ways\nthrough drugs or sex economic success\nis emulating social power it's the idea\nof oh\nlike what what can we infer from the\nwealth of carly jenner is it kylie kylie\njenner\nhe's an actor activist comedian\nand someone who i truly believe is a\namazing thinker in the realms of\nphilosophy spirituality politics\nand life i'm so excited to dive in to\nhis fascinating life which i believe\nhe's had one of the most fascinating\nones\nhe is none other than russell brand\nrussell thank you again for that\nintroduction i was enjoying that\nyeah well you deserved it okay thank you\nthank you for doing this again it's\ngreat to be back with you\ncongratulations on your podcast\nthank you i appreciate that it was\nwonderful being on yours\nyeah this is the world now just people\npodcasting each other\ni suppose ultimately there'll be a time\nwhen no human interaction\nis not subsequently released as a\npodcast yeah well i think that's what\nhappened right people had\namazing conversations and then they\nthought i wish we could have shared that\nwith someone\nnow and now they do but i remember last\ntime we were together\nit's actually been just a year since i\ninterviewed you for recovery which was\nawesome i was looking at that the other\nday\nwhich was beautiful to be with you on\nthe the feedback we got for that\nlive broadcast last year i think like\nover two and a half million people saw\nit\nand the amount of energy we had for it\nwas absolutely amazing i was very\nimpressed and for a while afterwards i\ncouldn't do an internet video without\ngoing press like press just\nlet me see a little heart a smiley face\nbut then i\ncouldn't keep up the enthusiasm jack\nthat is why we need you\nwell yeah i'm not doing it this time\nbecause it's not live so i can't ask for\nthat\nbut we were together so the last time we\nwere together we were in ireland on a\nbeach\nbecause you were shooting a movie and\nyou were kind enough to invite us into\nyour trailer\nwhile you were getting your makeup done\nand wearing your outfits tell us a bit\nabout that\nwe were doing i was doing a children's\nfilm it was called four kids and\nit and now everything i do in my life is\nweighed up against\nis it gonna be as enjoyable to me as\ndoing my daughter's\nbath time where i get to spend good\nquality time with them\nmucking around and it's one of my\nfavorite things to do so i only really\ndo work if it doesn't get in the way of\nparenting i've been like you know i've\ndone had a long period of my life where\ni wasn't a parent and now so parenting\nthat's it for me you know like at this\nstage there might be a bit where i get\nbored of them i'm\nconsidering that as a possibility so\nlike doing that film out there\nrather now swami a friend and teacher to\nboth of us\nwas kind enough to come visit us in\ncounty wicklow island\nalso to do the podcast as usual heaven\nforbid that a conversation should occur\nwithout being recorded and subsequently\ndownloaded\nso you know on the last day i was\nwriting about it if i don't have today\nbecause i've like\nwritten a book on mentorship and rather\nthat swami is one of the mentors that i\nwrite about\nin that book and i wrote about that\noccasion and how strange it was to be in\na trailer\nwith you a couple of other guys sandy\npan our mutual friend and radhanath\nswami and of course my own father i'm\nthinking how unusual that felt those\nsort of those worlds colliding\nand radha swami telling those stories\nfrom the bhagavad gita\nyou know and in a sense those kind of\nthose kind of\nencounters are demonstrative of a new\nlife where my past is\ncoalescing with my future where\ndifferent groups of my friends are\nstarting to meet in the past things were\nquite atomized for me i was quite\ninsular\nand solitary and quite i kind of i'm\nstill quite protective i suppose but in\na\ndifferent way so now you know if i do\nmake a film then i'll make a film where\ni can bring my kids\nyou know if i do do podcasts i try to do\nit in a way that doesn't disrupt\nyou know my connection to my family so\nthings have changed and that little\nexperience there of making that kid's\nfilm\nand and the encounter that you and i had\nthere in a sense is emblematic of this\ntransition\nyeah it was an amazing conversation and\nit's it's fascinating to see that\ntransition because did you ever\ndid you always dream of being a father\nwas that always a step you wanted to\ntake did you want to have\nyeah children yes like almost as soon as\ni stopped being a child\ni wanted children i really like children\na lot when i was sort of\nlike 15 or 16 i like i say something\nabout them\ni suppose what it is is that the\nunstructured\nconnection that they have which most\nevidently is observable through play\nthe way kids play for me makes me very\nvery happy\nthat you can just invent what your\nsituation is and my daughter now\nis just reaching that age where you can\nthat's what she'll do\noh no lucy's stuck in the mud i don't\neven know\nlucy is let's get lucy out of the mud\nyou hold on my pajama you hold my\njammers\nwe have to get lucy out of mud but as\nsoon as we got lucy out of the mud then\nshe's in a tree\nthis kid's got no respect for reality\nthe way that reality is configured\naccording to\nmaterial situations for her lucy is\nalways on the press of piss of being\nstuck in the mud or caught in a tree\nand it's our duty to get them back i\nfeel some of the storylines might be\nbeing plagiarized from\nthe disney version of winnie the pooh\nalthough the central character\nlucy seems to be her own construction\nunless that has been taken\nfrom ben and holly the kids show either\nway it's a kind of hip-hop\neditorializing\nof various media into her own imaginary\nnarratives\nthe they say that hip-hop were the first\npost-modern art form\nand now children's play is this\nwonderful collage\nof influence and i want in do you still\nhave play yourself is there something\nthat you feel because i feel as adults a\nlot of people i know i spoke to\nuh the founder of classpass who's a good\nfriend of mine and she was talking about\nhow as a\nceo she really believes that one of the\nthings we lose as adults is play\nand you've just brought that up and i'm\njust thinking that reconnection of\nplay in our own lives is that something\nthat you have\na form of yes i have like firstly i will\nsay this that\na very good friend of mine emma kenny\nwho you should have on your podcast\nsaid that sex is adult play that in a\nhealthy relationship your sexuality\nshould have\nan air of playfulness in it so that's\nsomething that i think about\nand aspire to elsewhere in my life in my\nfriendships\nlike i like i've always enjoyed people i\nguess that's why i like comedians\nit's like people that you can start\ntalking about stuff and you sort of know\nthat what you're talking about is not\nreally real or something\nbut you're just inhabiting a role of\ncourse i'm a performer as well and\nperformance requires play it requires\nplay\nnow from you know you and i are getting\nto know each other more you have a lot\nof uh\nspirit you are running deep you know so\nyou have a kind of a\nsort of a very what seems to me a very\nnatural\nmonastic sage-like\nquality you know i'm not saying that\nthat doesn't mean the player is\naccessible to you i'm\nsure it is but for me coming from the\nbackground that i do of a performer and\nan entertainer\nplay is vital the tricks that energy the\nenergy of none of this is real\ndon't take this stuff seriously you know\nit's found in a lot of deities that i\nlike you know sort of like in\nkrishna for example there's a lot of\nmischief\nmischief yeah i like that stuff now\nmischief is a risk\nbecause we live in an orderly material\nworld of regulation\nbut i suppose the idea of play is you're\nnot hurting no one yeah\ni wanted to talk to you about a few\nthings today and one of one of the first\nthings was\nand i don't know if you know this one of\nthe most google's thing is is russell\nbrand married\nand and obviously i know laura your wife\nshe's she's wonderful and amazing that's\nme\ngoogling that yeah\nwho's this person in the bed where are\nthese credit card bills coming from\nyou you're making sure just check it in\nwith yourself but it's it's so\nfascinating to me because\nand i and i met what i said earlier\nyou've lived\nan incredibly fascinating life already\nand you continue to do but\nevery part of your life's been so well\ndocumented\nby the media and i use the word well\nloosely but your life has been\ndocumented by the media\nand and how has that felt for you like\nto how is that\nfelt from an experiential point of view\ni feel like today the reason why i ask\nit\nis people are listening my audience\npeople are just struggling with their\nlives being documented by their own\nsocial media profile\nlike people are struggling with that but\nyou've had your life documented by\npeople you don't even know\nit can make you feel a kind of\ndistinction and separation from yourself\nlike a part of you gets taken away in\nfact when i first\ngot famous i was friends and still am\nfriends with jonathan ross the\nbroadcaster the english broadcaster\nand he said you lose something when you\nbecome famous and you never get it back\nand what it is is a kind of privacy\nand a sense of who you are now at the\nbeginning of my\nlife in public i didn't have any regard\nfor\nprivacy because i didn't i wasn't that\nkind of person you know i was\ni liked being famous i liked performing\ni was single and so i didn't regard\nmyself in that kind of way\nso how it feels like is a\nthe illusion sometimes become more\npowerful than the truth but i perhaps\neveryone experiences that\nin a sense fame is simply an\namplification of what we all experience\nwe all know it's like to be gossiped\nabout\nwe all know what it's like to have\npeople not like you and then attack you\nyou know and in fame you experience\nthese things\nin amplification so in a while in a way\nit's very alien but in another way it's\nvery ordinary\njust by degree is different from the\nnormal experience\nso in time at times it's been\nfrustrating because i\nsometimes you want to control your own\nnarrative and you want to control what\nother people think of you which\nobviously is impossible\nand so it's the time's been quite\nchallenging because i've wanted to no\nthat's not what i said that's not why i\nmean i'm in this and\nin my journey as a person with a public\nprofile has been one of\nrelinquishing that control accepting the\nterms of fame accepting that i'm here\nnow\nand trying to renegotiate so that i can\nbe somehow\nuseful in this role i i think you're one\nof the few people who can probably say\nthat authentically because\ni was saying this too early and i said\ni'd bring it up i was\nwatching the start of your new netflix\nshow\nthat's about to come out that's coming\nout in december so we'll have come out\nby the time this comes out but\nbut in that show you start off and you\ntalk about how you realize\nyou make a great joke about how actually\nwhy don't you explain it\nit's probably better you explain you\nmake a great joke about how you know\nyou're out here to send a message etc\nand then also to monetize\noh yeah yeah yeah i say that it's very\ndifficult to make a living in media if\nyou spend all your time criticizing all\nmedia that i learned that i was using\nlike if you use your position of fame to\nattack\nthe way that fame and celebrity\nfunctions\nthen eventually you're gonna cut the\nhead off the serpent the serpent's\nlike gonna stop i mean in the end you\ncan't write that forever\nso there's a it was a sort of a curious\ntime because i suppose we've talked\nabout\nmental health and in a way what happened\nto me is i reached a point of total\ndisillusionment because i reached\nsaturation in terms of my own\nin a way my own expectations of\ncelebrity i would have\nliked there were points in my life where\ni would have liked to have been as\nfamous as say tom cruise or as famous as\nwill smith or as famous as\nyou know i don't know famous famous\npeople but like when i was very close\ninto that world\nit found it very something it made me\nrecoil and not at ease with myself\nnot that i made a deliberate choice to\nleave but in this like it's\ncreated a kind of spasm in me that i\ndidn't have much control over\nsubsequent to that i experienced a sort\nof death a kind of death\nof what i thought i wanted even though\njay i was never\nyou know i'm not a bloody idiot so i\nknew that fame wouldn't\nuh entirely excuse me grabbing a tissue\ni sort of knew that fame would not be\num and it wouldn't work you just got me\nolder plastic bag yes yeah i keep saying\nit's like the baby bag\nthat's actually just mine all right the\nbaby bag\nthis is a bloody thing it looks too\norganized i know well that's just that\nbaby i'm not the genius behind the\nconstruction of that device\nand so i knew even when i was little\neven when i was really little\ni want to be famous if i'm famous i\nwon't be me anymore i would have escaped\nme\nbut uh i also knew that it definitely\nwouldn't work as a technique\nbut then it's still sort of weird when\nit actually happens\nand this same lesson has been taught to\nme in many ways through drugs or\nsex or you know money lots of ways not\nthat it's been\ni know there are people that are more\nextremely famous more extremely wealthy\nhave\nmore sex i know all of those kind of\nthings but for me\nuh i suppose i'm like an idiot student\nof spirituality that's like well i just\nreally will check that sex doesn't work\nagain like and then before going in it\ndefinitely definitely doesn't it\ndefinitely doesn't it's definitely not\nthe answer but these things are\nseductive for a reason\ntemptation is not ugly temptation is\nbeautiful absolutely and you said you\nwrote your book mentors which i'm super\nexcited about because\ntell us a bit about the few people that\nare in there and how they've helped you\nmaybe come to terms with some of these\nthings that you just mentioned there who\nare those mentors what are the topics\nthat\nvary across that book once i met this\nguy i was hanging out with puff daddy of\nall people okay\nand this guy that was mates with puff\ndaddy he would call tracy\nhe was pretty cool and he used this\nmetaphor which i've not used in the book\nand i realized that now that perhaps i\nshould have done\nhe goes life's like a computer game you\nget trapped on different levels and\nuntil\nyou can master that level you'll be\ntrapped on it it goes you obviously was\ntrapped on the drug level then you get\ntrapped on the sex level you've got to\ntranscend these different levels\nnow for me these levels are overseen or\nyou're helped\nferried across by mentors when i was a\ndrug addict i met chip summers\nand chip summers was the first person i\nmet that was clean he\nwas a worse drug addict than i'd been he\nwould have been\nin prison for armed robbery and stuff i\nwas never\nnever served a custodial sentence so\nwhen i said this guy talking about i\ndon't take drugs anymore even though\nthere were lots of things are different\nhe's an atheist i'm not an atheist i was\nable to sort of somehow download from\nhim or\nhe were able to transfer to me like any\ngood teacher will something that was\nladen within me but i was not in a\nposition to realize\nso he was the first mentor i had i made\nthe decision\nthis is like at first i didn't know it's\npossible like you say\nyou can't be what you can't see i didn't\nknow it's possible to not be a drug\naddict i thought that was the solution\nthen i saw people not being a drug\naddict and then i was willing to do what\nhe said in this case\n12-step recovery which i believe is a\ngood solution for anyone with addiction\nissues or anyone that wants to change\nthemselves\nactually then like um you know then i\ngot kind of caught up on other stuff\nthe sexual behavior the\nobsession with fame pleasure\nindividualism and then i've\nmet a series of different mentors\nincluding spiritually like you know\ndevoted spiritual people such as rather\nthan swami here we both know amma\nthe great indian saint um and uh\nthen like people that are more what i\nwant to say parochial like\nmummy or jimmy who's like a very\nsuccessful\nproducer and manager of a production\ncompany\nwho's got four kids been married a long\ntime doesn't drink or take drugs like me\nhasn't for\nlonger than i have who's quite a solid\nperson\nfrom a background i identify with uh\nwho's intelligent and lucid so i\nwatched this person and there's very\npractical mentorship he's like\ni'll if i'm at the point of a decision\nlike i'm gonna do this\njimmy i'm thinking of doing this do not\ndo this i do what he says instead of so\ni'm already\non a different path now i'm i'm using a\nconsciousness that is not my own i'm\naccessing external consciousness\nso in a way i know it's bloody simple\nit's just following advice\nbut we don't have you know we come from\nsimilar worlds similar backgrounds we\ndon't have mentor traditions in bloody\nessex or wood green no one says the\nright emulate this guy this person is\nconnected\nyou have to find them by chance and by\ncircumstance and some of you don't even\nknow that that's what you need\nyou know so through my life once i was\nswitched on to it because of the good\nfortune of being a drug addict i became\nmore alert to the possibility of doing\nit so i started to look at i like this\nguy i want to emulate him\nit could be like a comedian like bill\nhicks where like he was\nsadly already dead by the time i'd\nbecome a comedian but i like how he does\nthat and i model myself on that man\nand like oh what what does he do of\ncourse with\nyou know when you're constructing your\nidentity you everything is about trying\nto connect to your own essence\nso you're not gonna you know like i'm\nnot from texas\ni'm not like i don't use anger in the\nsame way as\nhe does i mean there's all sorts of\ndistinctions you know and i you know so\nyou know my like a little bit of kenneth\nwilliams a little bit of richard pryor a\nlittle bit of peter cook you just\ncopy the people that you admire and it\nhelps you to become yourself because the\nlatent energies within you will be\nrealized if you have the external\ncoordinates to follow but don't get\nobsessed or fetishize\nthe external cold notes in which case\nyou're just mimicking and you won't\nengage your own essence\nyeah and i'm glad you touched that like\nwhat is that difference in your mind\non imitation versus emulation like that\nmimicking\nversus actually finding yourself through\nthat process because i\ni couldn't agree with you more i\ngenuinely feel that we live in a society\nwhereby\nthe pinnacle of success becomes our\nvalidation or metric\nof how we measure ourselves so right now\nfor example you know\nkylie jenner's just become the youngest\nbillionaire in the world at 21\nevery 21 year old's going oh god i'm not\nbillionaire you know and it becomes the\nnew pressure\nso it becomes the imitation or you see\nsomeone who's popular on social media\nby doing a particular activity you think\ni need to imitate that\nto get that result what is that\ndifference between it being a search for\nself\nversus a sabotage yourself maharishi\nmaharesh said\ndiscernment is the most important thing\ndiscernment and then i spoke to\njordan peterson and he said judgment so\nyou know it's interesting isn't it that\nsomeone like the mahareshi would not say\nkindness love compassion but would say\ndiscernment knowing\nwhat path to follow in terms of\nmentorship and emulation i would say\nin a connection it's very difficult not\nto want to\nmimic stars or billionaires but i would\nsay\nwe must become attuned to what is\ntimeless\nand economic success\nis emulating social power it's the idea\nof oh\nlike what what can we infer from the\nwealth of carly jenner is it kylie kylie\njenner\nlike is that oh she's powerful she can\ndo what she wants she's made something\nof her life she's glamorous she's potent\nshe's powerful\nlike so the timeless in that is i\nsuppose power the\ntemporal in that is economic success\nall it's gonna die it's gonna go\nkylie jenner like all of us will die the\nmoney will die\nthe globe itself the entire planet will\ndie so if you've spent your\ntime festooning and ornamenting\nyour temporary vehicle instead of the\ntimeless which is con\nin continual dialogue with the temporal\nand external\nthen you have missed the point so if i\nsay i like bill hicks because bill hicks\nspeaks the truth\nright and i so i will speak my truth\nrather than\ni'm gonna wear these clothes and put on\nthis accent then i've\nyou know don't learn the wrong lesson\nyou know and like a lot of times in my\nown life i learned the wrong lesson\ni learned ah you know like hollywood\nstars\nthey seem to be above problems and above\nthe filth that i feel\ncontaminated by i'll become a hollywood\noh no the filth has come with me\nyou know because i learned the wrong\nlesson a real lesson the real work is\ndone\ninwardly i suppose how to make this\nevaluation jay\nwould be to this is why good mentors\nbecause you can't always trust yourself\ni can't always trust myself i still am\ncapable of making dumb decisions i still\nmight\ngo i like you say with your seed and\nweed technique which i adore\ni like that i might sort of try and\nconvince myself that's a seed yeah\nyeah you're idiot how can you try and\nsell that as a seed oh no it could be\nbecause really what you want to do you\nknow the power prestige privilege these\nthings all\ni like them part of me wants it i want\nthe glory the adornment to be garlanded\nin wonder to be kissed and loved and\nlicked\nbut i've been there now and it's very\ntemporary\nand yeah it's that confirmation bias\nright we're always trying to find the\ninformation that justifies our belief\nso if we want to switch and make\nourselves feel oh no i am happy doing\nthis because he or she is happy doing it\nwe find a way yes we find a way but\nwhat's fascinating about what you've\ndone\nand this has genuinely been i think i've\nwanted to ask you this since we've been\nfriends and known each other\nand i'm glad i get to ask it to you\ntoday because i think\nit's probably one of the hardest things\nto do genuinely\ni feel like you're someone who has\nmultiple times\nreinvented themselves and not reinvented\nfor the sake of branding or marketing\nbut in bringing out your truth in\ndifferent ways oh thanks that's a good\ncompliment right and i mean\ni'm saying i'm genuinely saying it like\ni don't think it's been a marketing or a\nbranding attempt i believe it's\nbeen an attempt to to be authentic and\ngenuine at every moment in the way that\ni've seen it\nbut you you started off and we were\ntalking about earlier you started it off\nyou were you\nyou know you were the host big brother\nthe digital edition etc and then\neveryone knew you as this\nyou know eccentric crazy wacky\nindividual you know\ncharismatic captivating and and i've\nheard people who work with you behind\nthe scenes say he was extremely charming\nbehind the scenes too\nand so and there are parts of that which\nyou've kept and there's parts of that\nwhich you let go and then\nwe saw russell brand of course the actor\nand then you moved into acting in\nhollywood and\ni know everyone that i speak to in\namerica about you absolutely adores you\nand loves you\nfor the movies that you made and then we\nhave you coming back and\nplaying a more activist role and then\neven in politics and now\nspirituality and philosophy and culture\nand society and\ni feel like that must have been so\ndifficult because i don't think and you\nmay see it differently but from my pers\nmy point of view i never really saw you\ncompletely step away to come back\ni never really i see a lot of people\nespecially celebrities or people who are\ntrying to find their truth and find\ntheir why\nthey kind of go away into hiding and\nthen sometimes emerge in an interview\nand\ndon't always make complete sense because\nthey're still trying to make sense of\nwhat they're finding but you almost\nhave kept your personality and who you\nare but then\nengaged and explored all these\nfascinating things you've been fortunate\nthis jay when you put it like that\nin a sense we all have our game don't we\nand our strategies\nsome of us are attracted to the more\nhigh stakes game\nwhere you could be humiliated exposed or\nattacked\nor killed and i think what happened is\nthat even though i in various periods of\nmy\nlife have taken on the tools\nand ephemera of the culture i.e\ni want to be on the tv and dress up and\nbe all famous or i want to go hollywood\nor whatever\nsomething in me always knew that these\nthings would pass\nand i'm not real and i've kept a healthy\ndialogue with that perhaps because i'm\nan addict and an addict has to\nbe aware of pain continually and\notherwise the pain will\nend in self-destruction so it wasn't\num a conscious right i better reinvent\nmyself\nit was in each case a sort of crisis\nthat felt beyond\nmy control like just oh this isn't\nworking anymore i can't do that no more\nthat doesn't seem real anymore not even\nreally cognitive\ni moved back from america when i fell in\nlove with somebody\nin england i've got like the thing with\npolitics\nfor example was i i remember i feel like\ni asked myself the question and my mate\ngareth that i was\nworking with a lot of the time in what\nwill happen if i just start saying what\ni actually\nthink about politics and then put it on\nthe internet what will happen\nand then i watched what happened and it\nfelt like\ni don't always feel that like for take\nthe very obvious example of i said\nthere's no point voting because the oppo\nthe opportunities for change are minimal\nand ultimately meaningless\ni had always felt that that's why i had\nnever voted and pretty much everyone i\nknew felt like i didn't belong to\ngroups of people that were like well i'm\na democrat or i'm a conservative\neveryone's just like well that's just\nthat\nthing where everyone pretends that\nordinary people can have power\nwhile these institutions protect their\nown interests everyone\nsort of knew that whether intellectually\nor just more viscerally\nso i started talking about it in the\nsame way of through performance through\ncomedy because the point of comedy in a\nsense is revelation\nrevelation of what is previously being\nconcealed that's what is exciting\nabout comedy is that it puts you in\ntouch with an ulterior reality\nlike that you know we know we suspect we\npray and meditate on\nthat whilst we accept the conditions of\nthis conversation that you're embodying\nthat conscious entity and i'm embodying\nthis conscious entity we both know that\nthey're going to die we wonder what is\nthe energy that's behind it where will\nthat energy go\nof what is that energy comprised how did\nwe end up speaking this language\nall of these questions fizz invisibly\nthrough the air\nall of these connections are continually\nbeing made and i feel that you can apply\nthis metric this tool\nthis uh analytical device to anything\nyou can say well what is politics who\ndoes it serve how is it constructed\nwhy is this system still in place why is\nit not progressed when clearly the\ntechnology to change\nit has or evolved whose interests have\nbeen protected\nwhy are these conversations not had why\nis this information not conveyed why\nyou know if you start asking those\nquestions things start just peeling away\nand peeling away\nyou can ask it of yourself you can ask\nif someone you love was a cruel thing to\ndo anyway\nbut or you can ask it of the\ninstitutions that are around you\nso in a sense the thing that's you know\nyou shed your skin\nlike a serpent you know and you sort of\ngo on but like behind\nit the energy is the same my belief is\nwhile there might be an essential\ndistinction between\nyou and i that you are some very\nparticular expression of the whole and\nthe divine\nas everyone is that we are all somehow\nin continual communion with something\nthat's\nbigger than us bigger than this how\ncould it not be how could our little\nminds understand all reality how could\nthis be all that there is\nand how did you get into that like how\ndid that journey start so we're talking\nabout all these reinventions but that\nparticular\nwhat spiritual curiosity yeah where did\nthat come from like why do they drugs\nright because i think if you start\ntaking drugs you start thinking i'm\ntrying to kill this thing like it's not\nworking for me\nand if you take things like\nhallucinogens the hallucinogens will\nmake you physically experience oh no i'm\nnot me i remember that feeling being\nquite young so\n16 taking acid and the sort of\nthe horror actually the horror because i\nwas not\nyou know enough to do it of other lads i\nwasn't around bloody\ngurus yeah you know like so i'm just\nthinking oh no i'm not me\ni'm not me this is not good who am i\nthen you know and there's no one there\nto go that's really beautiful isn't it\nthat you're not you because it means\nthat you are everyone and you are\neverything and all those things you've\ntold yourself and your language and your\nculture and your gender and your\nidentity are all just\nbiological or social programs that you\nare exhibiting\ni just thought bloody hell whose hands\nare these and it was\nscary so but i suppose as i am getting\nolder i'm becoming\nlike you know in it like at the end of\nis it am i writing santa at the end of\nthe gita\nlike arjuna is like i remember like in a\nsense we know\nwe know it's a reawakening huh yeah\nreawakening\nsorry continue continue well like i feel\nlike it unfolds for you\nit unfolds for you and there are moments\nin life where your your\nthe trauma the rupture the pain of being\nalive always will become an opportunity\nfor\nlearning if you're able to do it if\nyou're able to\nsee it in that way and sometimes in such\nin our pain based\nmentality it's quite difficult to work\nthat trick\nit's quite difficult to go now what am i\nsupposed to learn here what most how am\ni supposed to evolve here\nnow one thing i like doing on the\npodcast is making it really\ntrying to extrapolate from incredible\npeople's lives like yourself some\nsome practical lessons in that sphere\nbecause i feel\neither if you're watching this or\nlistening to this you're either on drugs\nand you've had the same experience i\nknow plenty of people who feel that way\nso\ndefinitely there's that group of\nindividuals and then there's a group of\npeople that just kind of feel that way\njust because they've realized well i\ndon't want to be this this can't be all\nthere is\nand then there's a group of people are\njust like oh well actually that's too\nfar for me to even think about i'm not\neven there yet\nyou know but when you do make that step\nand you start having\noriginally like you said you don't have\na guru or sage to tell you oh that's a\ngood feeling\nyou start having these feelings what's\nthe next thing you do like what do you\ndo from there where do you go\nstart with the possibility of happiness\ni feel\ni don't agree with whilst you and i have\ntalked before about\nasceticism you know and denial\nof pleasure i feel like the possibility\nthat you can be happy\nis an interesting thing to invite\nbecause i think a lot of people just\nthink well this is life life is\nmiserable\nmy mum was beat up by my dad this isn't\nme personally i'm just making this\nexample uh you know like i've only ever\nknown misery\nthis like you have to overcome the idea\nbut even the fact that the possibility\nof happiness exists conceptually and\nyour consciousness is the possibility of\nits realization\nthen i feel like you have to accept that\nyou have\na problem i.e something that you want to\nalter and change\nthen you have to accept that\nthere is a way of doing it this is where\na mentor is useful\nin hope in the hope that change is\npossible then you have to be willing to\naccept help\nand i think that can work with any\nsituation something as evident chronic\nand\nsevere as drugs or serious eating\ndisorder or something like oh i don't\nlike my job anymore or i don't\nwant to say those kind of things say me\nif i\nlike you know if i think maybe i agree\nwith jay that i don't want to swear\nmaybe i think it's bad you know no i\nknow you don't do it so i think\nis it working for jay i'll try that you\nknow so that's an example of how\nsomething that's a potential for\nimprovement it could be deployed in my\nlife and i'll maybe try it out and i'll\nbe aware of it and see if it works for\nme\nyou know so in a sense like i'm not too\ndon't be married to the negative aspects\nof your self-belief\nyou know if you've something don't like\nsomething you can't they find you talk\nto people sometimes and they go yeah but\ni can't change i'm always like this\nlife's like this\nyeah and i or someone i spoke to and i\ngot he goes um\nyeah but i don't believe in god in that\nway i believe god's in relationships\nyeah you're not happy so [ __ ] your\nbeliefs excuse my language\nif your belief's not working for you\nlet's try something else yeah\nlet's try something else if it's working\nthen crack on\ni love that point about the openness to\nhappiness and and funnily enough\nmy journey into being a monk and that\npart of\ndenial was because i believed it would\nmake me more happy so even then\nthat was still the seed that was still\nthe focus\nthe focal point that service was linked\nto happiness yes\nthat selflessness was linked to i think\nabout this jay you know when people say\ni want to be enlightened\nis what they're really saying is i want\nto be happy you know\npleasure and i want to not feel pain and\nmaybe it's not you know awful\nto not want to suffer but\ni feel that if you mask the sincerity of\nyour intentions\nthen you're less likely to achieve them\ntotally and also the\nway that we avoid the likelihood\nthat our that our journey to happiness\nor connection or enlightenment or call\nit what you will\nwill not be doing what we think is right\nit's not going to be what we came up\nwith whilst of course all of us i feel\ncarry a kind of barometer that says\nlike you with the not swearing something\nin you told you i don't want to do that\nand you listen to that voice and\nsomething in me says\nyeah don't look at porn or us you know\nlike it's sort of it's not like i'm not\nresponding to some external puritanical\nforce that's saying don't do it although\nthere are enough people that have\nwritten down\ndo not objectify sex it will mess you up\nyou know people have\nobviously discovered that for thousands\nof years written it down\nand i've ignored it you know like and\nbut like uh\nwhen your inner voice aligns with\nsomething like that then you\ncover possibility of sort of making a\nmeaningful connection yeah i love that\ni've seen you say that in\na video that i saw on your instagram\npage recently where you were talking\nabout how how do you feel after you've\njust done the act\nlike that's kind of a great reflection\nprocess of like for example masturbation\nit's like how you feel after\nis a great judge of whether you want it\nin your life or not\nyeah if you feel great there's some\npeople that feel like yeah i like it and\ni'll carry on then\nyeah like though you know there's\nobviously such a thing as mental illness\nthere are obviously some people that go\naround doing the most unbelievable\nthings and it sort of works for them but\ni feel like as an optimist i have to\nbelieve that if we\nwere to approach those people with the\nlight that they would\nnot want to do it you know i don't feel\nthat people would want to cling on to\nthe murder the pedophilia\nif they had a connection to god 100 i\nthink people are ready to give up\nlesser things in any fashion material or\nspiritual or energy\nfor higher energy me too yeah what do\nyou think about the thing that gandhi\nsaid ages ago\nobviously quite like that you know\nthere's no point in india getting rid of\nthe british then emulating what the\nbritish\nwere doing anyway just with indians in\nthe roles of power he said we've got to\nbreak down our\ncountry and like there's 70 000 villages\nthey should all be autonomous\nand we've got to let go of our love of\ngadgets and stuff and he was saying this\nbefore we were you know spending our\nwhole life staring at screens\nyou know like you're saying we at some\npoint you've got to let go\nof those low lower pressures those low\nvibrational pleasures and that's what i\nthink is because people haven't been\nexposed to\nhigher energy most of all in their life\nand i see it everywhere i go i'm just i\nlook back and i'm like i'm so fortunate\nthat i met someone of really high energy\nreally early in my life\nright and that's kind of what i feel\nlike what i'm trying to do is\nis just how can i expose people to great\nenergy early in their life\nbecause then they at least know it\nexists it's almost like i was\nand this is a totally different context\nbut\ni was speaking to a big media company\nrecently and they were saying how\nthey know that when they make celebrity\ngossip etc it gets big views and big\nlikes and big shares\nbut one of them is a bit more conscious\nand intentional and pushed a very\nimportant piece around mental health\nand reform and recovery and when they\ndid that the views went even higher\nand she was just saying that actually\ntaking a more high brow attempted media\ntaking a\nstance having an opinion that wasn't\nnecessarily diving into our lower\ndesires to just learn about gossip and\nsex and all the issues\nactually brought people into it and so\nit's interesting how we\nsell people short through what we create\nthat's a cool point\ni mean like our sort of love of god or\ntruth or pure or whatever you want to\ncall it it shouldn't just be like\nsupporting a football team if you're\nsaying i like this one this is the one\ni've happened upon it's because it\nactually will work\nyou know you have to actually believe\nlike like i understand\nempirically with drugs no russell don't\ntake drugs it won't do what you think\nit's gonna do\nit will temporarily distract you from\npain and then the pain will be even\nworse\nit's a harder lesson to learn around sex\nit's harder to go no don't have sex\nyou will feel worse afterwards except\nobviously we've been in my case in a\nhappy uh monogamous relationship like\nso but and then even more hard to learn\noh don't\ngo out and try and adorn yourself with\nsort of glory and\nyou know expensive garb or care too much\nabout what people say\nyou sort of keep thinking it will work\nand obviously as that\nexample suggests people do think\nno looking at this you know video that\nsays we might catch a glimpse up\nsomeone's skirt or hear some\nscintillating bit of tittle tattle\nyou know it still kind of works and it's\nbar but\nwe are right we are right like\nyou can't get past hate with more hate\nyou can't get past lust with more lust\nbut within love within some pure\nconsciousness it must be housing all of\nit\nbut that the time is resting on\ntimelessness\nthat if you can somehow get by if you\ncan get by\nit will be more powerful that's i\nsuppose what faith\nis well said\nthanks thanks so i'm gonna go into we've\ngot five minutes i'm getting into the\nfinal five questions that i always do\nlast five minutes\nthe final five and now it's time for the\nterminal 20\nunique item on under the skin yeah so\ni'm gonna go into these five questions\nso\ni actually for this segment i went went\nto google\nbecause i love seeing what you really\ntrust google i don't trust google i like\ni like i like knowing what i like\nknowing what the masses are thinking\nabout\nright temperature taking device yeah it\nhelps me\nreally understand i think they're\nlistening to us google probably they\nbetter be\ni mean yeah that's why we're wasting our\nlife\nokay so the the question was are we\nwe've answered this one when i skipped\nthis one\nso this one is is russell brand married\nthat's one of the most google\nyes yes to my wife laura brand yeah by\ncoincidence\nuh this is another what is russell\nbrand's iq well i think i like to think\ni'm quite clever i know i think people\ndo too that's a question that people\nlike that if you don't like you test\nit's mostly to do with triangles\nisn't it put this triangle over there\nnow what\ndid they was it what happened on the\ntuesday so i like to think i've got a\nhigh iq but\nthere's quite a lot of daily\ndemonstrations of stupidity\ni'd have to be honest well i remember\nwhen the guardian put you in\nas the fourth most oh yeah no clever\nperson\nin the world yeah that was good because\nit was like thomas piketty naomi klein\nprobably like janice farofakis like\nproper like political leaders\necologists and you're number four yeah\nit's amazing\nquite right i love that why am i not\nnumber one yeah at the time\ni love it okay uh that was yeah that was\nthe the russell brand uh iq\nquestion i love this bit of the show by\nthe way oh good\nthis is really really tapping into my\nego thank you\nis russell brand vegan he tries he's a\nnice guy\ni like i mean like what happens with me\nis uh\neggs like you know but like i try to\ntake them in the kindest way\nyeah uh i want to do is i reach into the\nchicken just before it's ready\nno i don't do that and like a and i like\ni sometimes like\nyou know i sometimes like a little\nbuttery snack i'm so sorry i've\nvegans are definitely right i'm not\narguing that there i'm not saying what's\nthe point of being vegan\nvegans are correct are you vegan i am of\ncourse you are look at your eyes you\ndisgusting i remember when you\ninterviewed the happy pair too\nno i love those yeah those men are\nbeautiful man you've got to be vegan you\ncan't argue with whether or not you\nshould be vegan\nyou know like people don't know you've\ngot to eat just eat like some people are\ntaking it to extremes i only eat meat\nnow\nwhoa i won't even have salad with it no\nway but like i mean you've got to be\nvegan for the planet for yourself for\nevery reason\nthe trouble is you know eggs\ncakes weakness general weakness but i'm\nheading that way\nperfect to me will be vegan and and the\nlast one is what does russell brand up\nto now\ngosh what is he doing well i am uh\nwhat i'm doing at the moment is being a\nfather to my daughter's\nhusband to my wife and work has become\nof secondary importance to me but i did\nthe thing\nthat was there in the first place that\ngot me into all that trouble\nand all of those adventures is still\nthere it's not gone anywhere\nit will need to at some point manifest\nitself and\ni'm just trying to prepare myself so\nthat when next time it does it\nit doesn't lead to me sort of being\ndestroyed in some way\nor causing suffering i want it to\nrealize itself benevolently and i feel\nthat the only way to do that is to try\nto avoid making the decision or allowing\nit to migrate towards the ego\neven things i start with the best\nintentions i.e truths sometimes the ego\ngets hold of it it's very crafty the ego\nisn't it\nbut that's but that's the best thing\nthat we have to try\nbecause otherwise we don't even see it\nand then we would often talk about in\nthe monastery that\nwhen you're not doing anything out the\nordinary it's easy to think you're\nhumble\nwhen you're not actually pushing the\nboundaries if you sit alone all day\neveryone will think they're humble\nbut it's when you go out there and you\ndo something like oh wow i've got a big\nego i need to work on that\nright so it's like if you don't activate\nit's easy to start getting comfortable\nand think oh i'm quite enlightened\ni'm quite realized but you're actually\njust neutralized yes you're not engaged\nwith the worldly things yeah\ni like that thank you awesome thank you\nrussell and i want people to go and of\ncourse buy the book mentors which i'm\nfascinated to read\ncan't wait to read it anything you'd\nlike to mention on mentors\njust uh no you could do what you want\nwith that and buy it and read it get\nmentors you don't even need to buy it or\nread it you could nick it or you could\nget the information just get a mentor\nand that netflix thing yes absolutely by\nnow that's been and gone it's february\nbut i'm gonna push that early anyway oh\nyeah yeah\noh and listen to it podcast under the\nskin and see how we gracefully steal\nthat last bit\nwhen i go okay now it's the final five\nquestions i just\ni don't know i just like to go on google\ni guess i've always liked it\nso these are the top five uh
