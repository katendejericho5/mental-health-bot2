    "transcript": "I think Clear Vision is what helped me\nuh since a very very young age because\neven though I started at 3 and a half\nmaybe from 3 and a half to 5 it was only\nfor fun but already from 5 every time I\nwas getting to the truck yes I love what\nI do but I want to be the best I was\nvery clear in setting my goals realistic\ngoals and in where I want it to be MH\nnot in 10 15 years time because this was\nway too far but in one or two months\ntime which were small steps but small\nsteps always in the right direction and\nI think that definitely helped me in\nachieving small goals after small goals\nto get to the bigger goal which was\nobviously to become a Formula One driver\nand even more so with Ferrari but it's\nwith the different small steps that I've\nuh and the different targets that I've\nuh fixed myself throughout my my career"
