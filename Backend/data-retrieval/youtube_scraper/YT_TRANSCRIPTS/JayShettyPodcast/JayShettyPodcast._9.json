    "transcript": "and one of my favorite uh thoughts is\nfrom Martin Luther King where he said\nthat people who love peace need to learn\nto organize themselves as well as those\nwho love war and I love that statement\nbecause I often feel that those of us\nwho want peace in the world or goodness\nin the world can be kind of a bit woo\nwoo about it or we can be a bit like you\nknow peace and love and it can be kind\nof like this really nice idea or nice\nideal but it doesn't have systems\norganized strategy and it seems like\nyou've both been able to take your\npassion and intention and bring that in\nso wonderfully"
