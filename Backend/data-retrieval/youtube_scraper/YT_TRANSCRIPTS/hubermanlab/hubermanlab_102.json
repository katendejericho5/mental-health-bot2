professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday is an ask me\nanything episode, or AMA.\nThis is part of our\npremium subscriber channel.\nOur premium subscriber\nchannel was started in order\nto provide support for\nthe standard Huberman Lab\npodcast, which comes\nout every Monday\nand is available at\nzero-cost to everybody\non all standard feeds, YouTube,\nApple, Spotify and elsewhere.\nWe also started the\npremium channel as a way\nto generate support for exciting\nresearch being done at Stanford\nand elsewhere, research\non human beings that\nleads to important\ndiscoveries that\nassist mental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nI'm also pleased to inform\nyou that for every dollar\nof the Huberman\nLab Premium channel\ngenerates for research studies,\nthe Tiny Foundation has\nagreed to match that amount.\nSo now we are able to double\nthe total amount of funding\ngiven to studies of mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand human performance.\nIf you'd like to subscribe\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\npremium channel, please go\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nIt is $10 a month to subscribe.\nOr you can pay $100\nall at once to get\nan entire 12-month\nsubscription for a year.\nWe also have a lifetime\nsubscription model\nthat is a one-time payment.\nAnd again, you can\nfind that option\nat hubermanlab.com/premium.\nFor those of you that\nare already subscribers\nto the premium channel, please\ngo to hubermanlab.com/premium\nand download the premium\nsubscription feed.\nAnd for those of you that\nare not Huberman Lab podcast\npremium subscribers,\nyou can still\nhear the first 20 minutes\nof today's episode\nand determine whether or not\nbecoming a premium subscriber\nis for you.\nWithout further ado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nThe first question asks, is\nit possible to get a cold\nor to get sick from\ndeliberate cold exposure?\nAnd I suppose a related\nquestion is, should you even\ndo deliberate, cold\nexposure if you have\na sniffle, a cold, or a flu?\nI get that question\nall the time as well.\nSo answer both of\nthose questions.\nAnd I will also touch on some\nof the immune enhancing effects\nof deliberate cold exposure.\nBut just to make\nsure that we answer\nthe specific question asked\nhere right off the bat,\nis it possible to get a cold\nor to get sick from deliberate\ncold exposure?\nWell, assuming that\nyou're not doing\nthe deliberate cold\nexposure for more than,\nsay five or six\nminutes at one stretch,\nprobably not directly from\nthe deliberate cold exposure.\nI mention that\nbecause most people\nare doing anywhere\nfrom about a minute\nto three minutes, sometimes\nfive or six minutes.\nAnd maybe for those\nof you that are really\npushing it, 10 minutes of\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nAnd most often after doing\nthat deliberate cold exposure,\npeople are either\ngetting clothed,\nor they're getting into a sauna,\nor they're taking a hot shower,\nand then getting clothed and\nheading off into their day\nor off to sleep depending\non what time of day or night\nyou happen to do your\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nWe can safely say\nthat if you warm up\nafter a relatively brief,\nmeaning one minute to,\nlet's extend out to 10\nminutes, 10-minute deliberate\ncold exposure,\nalthough, I really\nwant to caution people to\nnot do 10-minute deliberate\ncold exposure right off the bat.\nIf you are somebody who\nis not accustomed to it,\ndon't jump right up to that\nlong exposure to cold water.\nStart with shorter exposures.\nBut if you're doing that\none-to-10-minute deliberate,\ncold exposure, and then\nyou're getting warm afterwards\nand heading about your day, I\ncan't see how the deliberate\ncold exposure itself would\nenhance your susceptibility\nto getting sick.\nThat said, we know\nfrom an enormous number\nof studies that have looked\nat cold virus transmission\nand other forms of viral\nand bacterial transmission\nthat the environment\nthat you happen to be in\ndoes impact your\nsusceptibility to colds\nand other types of viruses\nand to bacterial infections\nin the following way.\nThere have been controlled\nstudies in which people\ngo into laboratories.\nThose laboratories have rooms,\nwhich they can very tightly\ncontrol the humidity,\nso essentially,\nthe water content\nin the air, as well\nas the temperature in the room.\nAnd if you look at the\ntotal mass of those data,\nwe can say a couple\nof specific things\nin kind of bullet point fashion.\nFirst off, cold,\ndry air does seem\nto increase our\nsusceptibility to\nviral and bacterial infections.\nBecause whether or not you're\na mouth breather or a nose\nbreather, and by the way, I\nsuggest everyone be a nose\nbreather unless you're\nexercising hard enough that you\nhave to breathe\nthrough your mouth,\nor you're talking or\nsomething of that sort.\nBut if you're a nose breather\nor a mouth breather or both,\nviruses and bacteria enter\nthrough your nose and mouth,\nsometimes through your eyes,\nbut your nose and mouth\nare going to be the\nmain sites of entry\nand your main barriers to\nviral and bacterial infections.\nIn fact, one of the ways you\nare constantly fighting off\nbacterial and viral\ninfections that you're\nexposed to all\nthe time is by way\nof those viruses\nand bacteria getting\ntrapped in the mucous\nlining of your nose\nor your mouth, most notably\nin the back of your throat.\nSo if you spend time in\ncold, dry environments,\nthere is a tendency for that\nmucosal lining to be thinner.\nThere is a tendency\nfor that mucosal lining\nto not be as robust in general.\nAnd when I say\nrobust, what I mean\nis that if your mouth\nbreathing, for instance\nin a cold, dry environment,\nI'm thinking from the time\nI spent in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts in winter\nat the T station.\nIf you're I'm just\nimagining myself\nbecause it was so darn\ncold back there breathing\nthrough your mouth or\nhaving gone for a run,\nand your mouth isn't covered,\nor even if you're deliberately\nnasal breathing, you are\ndrying out your nasal passages\nand making them more\nsusceptible to infections.\nDoes that necessarily\nmean that every time you\ngo out in cold,\ndry air that you're\ngoing to get an infection?\nNo, of course it doesn't.\nBut to relate this back to\nthe question we have before,\nthere are a lot of data pointing\nto the fact that more humid,\nwarm environments are going\nto make your mucosal lining\nand the general upper\nrespiratory area more,\nI don't want to say\nimmune because I\ndon't want to conflate that\nword with the other meaning\nof immune.\nIt's going to make it\nmore robust against\nbacterial and viral infections.\nSo if you get into a cold\nshower or a cold plunge\nor a cold ocean or a cold\nlake, and then you get out,\nand you're out there\nshivering and shaking, trying\nto boost your\nmetabolism or whatever\nit is that you're\ndoing it for, and it's\ncold, dry air, and\nespecially if your mouth\nbreathing in that\ncold, dry air, yes, I\ncould see how that\nmight lead to a higher\nprobability of getting a cold\nor other type of infection.\nBut there's nothing specific\nabout the deliberate, cold\nexposure itself that can\ninduce a cold or other type\nof infection assuming that\nthe water is clean, right?\nWe're not talking about\nbacterial infections\nof cuts on the skin, et cetera.\nWe're talking about colds and\nother forms of being sick,\nnamely upper\nrespiratory infections.\nOK, now with that said, I\noften get asked whether or not\nfor people who already\nhave a little sniffle,\nthey're feeling a little run\ndown or perhaps a lot run down,\nshould they do\ndeliberate cold exposure?\nAnd what's a little tricky\nto give a one size fits all\nanswer, , but I think we can\nsafely say that if you are\nfeeling malaise, if you're\nfeeling like you have to rest\nyou're tired, you're not\nfeeling good because of a cold\nor because of a flu or because\nof a bacterial infection, now,\nI'm not saying just\nfeeling not good,\nI'm saying feeling not good\ndue to a cold or other form\nof virus or bacterial infection,\nthen I would say stay out\nof deliberate, cold exposure.\nDon't use it.\nNow, why would I say that?\nGiven the data I'll talk\nabout in a few minutes showing\nthat regular deliberate cold\nexposure if done correctly,\ncan in fact increase\nimmune system markers\nand perhaps even make you\nmuch more robust to combating\ndifferent types of infection\nthrough the release\nof adrenaline.\nWe'll talk about what\nall that looks like\nin a moment in\nterms of protocols\nand some of the science.\nBut to just be very clear and\nvery direct, if you're sick,\nstay out of deliberate\ncold exposure.\nThere, I, would\ninstead recommend\nwarmer hot baths warmer hot\nshowers, the sauna, et cetera.\nBut I also would caution that\nif you are getting into saunas\nthat are too hot,\nsaunas they're so\nhot that it's stressful for\nyou, and again, a lot of people\nuse deliberate heat exposure\nbecause of the stress\nit induces, they're\ndoing some heat induced,\nfor instance, heat shock\nproteins and different ways\nof increasing heart rate.\nThat's a different\nsort of thing.\nThat's hard, stressful in order\nto generate an adaptation.\nI don't recommend doing that.\nIn fact, I don't recommend\ndoing deliberate cold exposure,\nexercise, or deliberate\nheat exposure if you're\nfeeling really not well.\nNow, if you're feeling\njust a little bit not well,\nyou're feeling a little\nbit rundown, a little bit\nof sniffle, a little bit\nof malaise, well then,\nit's kind of an edge\ncase where we could\nsay, all right you know what?\nJust take a hot shower\nand go to sleep.\nThat's probably the best advice,\nthat good old-fashioned advice.\nBut if you are determined to do\nyour deliberate cold exposure\nanyway, then I would\nsay definitely get warm\nor take a hot shower afterwards,\nhot bath, or hot sauna,\nbut, not too hot that\nit's stressful, of course.\nAnd keep in mind that one\nof the variables that's\nbeen measured quite\na lot in laboratory\nstudies of deliberate\ncold exposure\nis the increase in\nimmune system markers.\nSo I'll provide a few links\nto some of these studies.\nAlthough, nowadays there\nare many, many of them.\nBut it's very clear that\ndeliberate cold exposure\ncan increase the release\nand the production\nof different immune\nmolecules and immune cells.\nOne slightly older study,\nbut nonetheless a good study\nthat has relevance\nhere is entitled\n\"Immune system of cold exposed\nand cold adapted humans.\"\nKeep in mind that this study\nis a little bit extreme.\nAnd there are reasons for that.\nI guess to make a long\nstory short, oftentimes,\nin order to quote unquote\n\"see an effect in a study,\"\nscientists will use conditions\nthat are pretty extreme\ncompared to control group.\nOftentimes, you'll see\na dose response to,\nbut it's a little bit trickier\nto do with human studies\nof deliberate, cold exposure.\nIt can be done,\nbut not too common.\nBut here, they\nused a pretty what\nI would call extreme stimulus.\nIt was exposing people to\n14 degrees Celsius water,\nso that's 57.2\ndegrees Fahrenheit,\nwhich isn't that cold.\nIt's like cool, I would\nsay very cool water,\nbut not what you might\nconsider cold depending\non how well you tolerate cold.\nAnd that will vary, of course.\nBut they had people exposed\nto that for an hour, which\nis a pretty long time.\nMost people, as I mentioned,\nare using colder temperatures\nof deliberate cold\nexposure, so even high 30s,\nlow 40s, maybe upper\n40s for anywhere\nfrom one to 10\nminutes, depending\non how conditioned they are.\nAnd again, don't just jump into\n10 minutes of deliberate, cold\nexposure, please at 35\ndegrees or 40 degrees\nor even 45 degrees if you aren't\nfamiliar with deliberate cold\nexposure.\nYou have to ease into these\nsorts of things over time.\nAnd if you're\ninterested in protocols\nfor deliberate cold exposure,\nwe have a zero-cost newsletter\nat hubermanlab.com.\nGo to the Menu,\ngo to Newsletter,\nand you can find that.\nWe've done several episodes\non deliberate cold exposure.\nIn any event, this study,\n\"Immune system of cold exposing\ncold adapted humans,\"\nas I mentioned,\nhad people in 14 degrees\nCelsius water for one hour.\nAnd basically what they found\nis that one exposure to cold\ndid not change immune\nsystem function\nin any kind of significant way.\nHowever, what they found\nwas if people did deliver\ncold exposure repeatedly over\na period of about six weeks,\nand by repeatedly, I mean three\ntimes per week, what they found\nwere trends.\nAnd again, trends are not\nstatistically significant,\nbut trends towards increases in\nplasma concentrations of things\nlike IL 6, interleukin 6 or\ntotal numbers of T lymphocytes\nand T helper cells\nand T suppressor cells\nand activated T\nand B lymphocytes,\nthese are all immune\ncells and immune molecules\nthat roughly correspond to\nan increase in immune system\nfunction.\nIf you'd like to learn more\nabout the immune system,\nI did an episode on\nimmune system function.\nAgain, you can find\nthat at hubermanlab.com.\nAnd it spells out\nthe basic cell types\nof what's called the innate\nand the adaptive immune system.\nThis study, which we will link\nto in the show note captions\nis but one study of several\nother studies showing\nthat deliberate cold exposure\ncan increase immune system\nmarkers, especially when\ndeliberate cold exposure is\ndone repeatedly over time,\nso in this case, three times\na week over a\nperiod of six weeks.\nBut again, I want to\nhighlight these aren't\nhighly significant effects.\nThese are trends\nin the direction\nof increased numbers of immune\ncells and immune markers.\nNow, what's\nimpossible to know is\nhow those trends translate\nto actual resistance\nto specific concentrations of,\nsay cold virus or flu virus\nor any other virus or bacteria.\nThat would be great, but\nthat's a very difficult study\nto do, especially in the context\nof deliberate cold exposure\nas well.\nNow, we can all be scientists\nabout this and say, what is it\nabout deliberate cold\nexposure that would increase\nimmune system function?\nAnd there, we can\nconfidently say the molecules\nepinephrine and\nnorepinephrine, which\nare released in both brain and\nbody in response to cold water\nexposure, as well as things like\ndeliberate hyperventilation,\nthe release of norepinephrine\nand epinephrine into the brain\nand body is known to have a\nnumber of different effects\nrelated to the immune system.\nIt can be pro-immune, at\nleast in the short term.\nAnd in the long term, meaning\nif noradrenaline and adrenaline,\nagain those are just different\nnames for norepinephrine\nand epinephrine.\nI'm sorry, those\nare the same thing,\nbut that's why I use\nthem interchangeably so\nthat you don't get confused.\nIf you see noradrenaline\nor norepinephrine,\nthat's the same thing you hear,\nepinephrine or adrenaline,\nsame thing.\nDeliberate cold exposure or\ndeliberate hyperventilation\nwill increase those molecules,\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine.\nAnd their increase\nis pro-immune.\nIt can trigger the\nactivation of immune cells\nand immune molecules\nthat can make\nyou more resistant to\ncertain forms of infection.\nHowever, if norepinephrine\nand epinephrine\nare elevated chronically,\nand especially\nif they are elevated late\nin the day repeatedly\nover many, many days,\nthat can cause reductions\nin the number and\nefficiency of immune cells\nin combating infections.\nSo getting cold\nin this context of\nwhether or not you\ncan get sick from it\nshould really be\nconsidered more as\nwhat happens when you spike your\nadrenaline and norepinephrine?\nAnd there's one other\nstudy that we can look to,\nwhich is now really a famous\nstudy published in proceedings\nof the National\nAcademy of Sciences\nlooking at so-called\nWim Hof breathing.\nBut really, that just translates\nto cyclic hyperventilation.\nSo this is inhaling\nthrough nose,\nexhaling through the mouth\nrepeatedly 25 times or so.\n[BREATHING]\nIf you do that, you notice\nyou feel quite warm,\nlots to do with some things\nrelate to vasodilation,\nhas some things to do with\nrelease of norepinephrine.\nAnd epinephrine, we\nknow that pattern\nof deliberate hyperventilation,\nmuch like deliberate\ncold exposure,\ndeploys or releases\nnoradrenaline and adrenaline\ninto your brain and body.\nAnd we know from\nthis study entitled\n\"Voluntary activation of the\nsympathetic nervous system\nand attenuation of the innate\nimmune response in humans\"\nshowed really nicely, I think.\nThat if people are injected\nwith E. coli, a bacteria\nit's actually an\nend-- they did this\nthrough endotoxin injections.\nPeople got really sick.\nThey'd get feel like\nthey had the flu,\nthey vomit, diarrhea,\nget a fever, et cetera.\nHowever if they did\nthe sorts of breathing\nthat I talked about just a\nmoment ago, prior to that,\nthey were able to ward off a\nlot of the symptoms associated\nwith the endotoxin infection.\nAnd you would say, OK wow, their\nimmune system just fired up,\nand they were able\nto fight it off.\nBut it's trickier\nthan that, actually.\nWhat happened was the\nrelease of epinephrine\nand norepinephrine from\ncyclic hyperventilation, which\nis really what\n[BREATHING] really\nis, cyclic hyperventilation,\nalso called Wim Hof breathing,\nalso called tummo breathing,\net cetera, that actually had\na suppressive action on certain\narms of the immune system\nin a way that allowed\npeople to avoid symptomology\nsuch as fever,\nnausea, et cetera.\nAnd we would imagine\nthe same thing would\noccur with deliberate\ncold exposure done\nprior to bacterial\ninfection or viral exposure.\nSo if you're sensing that I'm\nsaying two things at once,\nI am.\nI'm saying deliberate\ncold exposure,\nand cyclic hyperventilation\ncan both cause deployment\nof molecules such as\nepinephrine and norepinephrine\nthat lead to enhanced\nimmune system\nfunction if done repeatedly.\nI'm also saying that increasing\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine\ntoo much can suppress\nyour immune system.\nIn this study, the PNAS study\nthat I mentioned a moment ago,\nthat suppression of\nthe immune response\nwas actually one of the reasons\npeople avoided symptomology.\nBut they were still\ninjected with endotoxin,\nso they just weren't fighting\noff the endotoxin with fever.\nRemember, fever is an\nadaptation to fight infection.\nIt's designed essentially\nto heat up the infection\nand kill it.\nSo what are we to\ntake away from this?\nHere are what I think\nare the key takeaways.\nOne, if you are\nfeeling good to great,\ndo your deliberate\ncold exposure.\nAnd perhaps don't worry so\nmuch about using your body's\nnatural metabolism and\nthermogenic abilities\nto heat back up afterwards.\nBut I don't suggest anyone\never allow themselves\nto stay really cold\nafter deliberate\ncold exposure for more than\n10, 15 minutes or maybe\nhalf an hour, right?\nGet bundled back up,\nor put on clothes.\nIf it's a nice hot, sunny day,\nget out in the sun and warm up.\nAgain, temperatures\nand conditions\nwill vary for different people,\ndifferent locations, et cetera.\nIf you are not\nfeeling great, you're\nfeeling a little\nrundown, and you really\nwant to do your\ndeliberate cold exposure,\ndo it, but then warm up\nreally well afterwards.\nMaybe even drink some hot tea or\nother fluid afterwards as well.\nAnd if you are not feeling\ngood, you're feeling malaise,\nyou're feeling run down.\nDespite what you read\nabout deliberate,\ncold exposure or cyclic\nhyperventilation,\nallowing for the deployment\nof immune molecules\nor increasing the\nnumber of immune cells\nthat you're making,\navoid anything\nthat's stressful or\nchallenging whether or not\nit's a cold challenge, a heat\nchallenge, or an exercise\nchallenge when you're\nfeeling run down.\nBecause under those conditions,\nwhat you really want to do\nis slow your circulation\ndown, probably\nfind and take a little\nwalks or something\nprovided you're not doubled\nover in bed and vomiting,\nand things like that.\nA little bit of\nmovement, probably\ngood to circulate your blood.\nBut in general,\nthe advice that you\nget to rest when you're\nsick and not push yourself,\nthat's really good\nadvice because you\nwant all of your\nbody's resources\nto be devoted to getting\nover that infection.\nAnd if you're interested\nin sickness and sickness\nbehavior and the\nsorts of behaviors\nthat can combat infection,\ncheck out the episode\nI did on the immune system.\nWe'll link to it in\nthe show note captions.\nBecause it talks\nabout how when we\nhave a viral or\nbacterial infection,\na whole set of\nbrain circuits get\nactivated that encourage us to\nbe more in the fetal position,\nto move less, to be eyes\ndown, to kind of slump down.\nThat's not a coincidence.\nThat's because of the activation\nof these so-called sickness\ncircuits that are\nreally designed\nto help you heal yourself.\nSo I both apologize, and\nwhat do the kids say?\nSorry, not sorry.\nDon't apologize for the\nsomewhat nuanced answer here.\nBecause a lot of\ninformation out there says,\noh, cold boosts\nyour immune system.\nAnd yeah, that's true\nunder certain conditions.\nIt can also deplete\nyour immune system\nand limit your ability\nto fight off infections\nunder other conditions.\nAnd perhaps the last\nthing to say about this\nis that I am a big believer in\nusing nasal breathing whenever\nyou don't have to breathe\nthrough your mouth.\nSo if you're exercising\nhard, by all means breathe\nthrough your mouth.\nIf you're doing\nmartial arts, and it\nrequires that you breathe\nthrough your mouth,\ngo ahead and do that.\nBut if you're doing, say a\nzone two cardio, low level\ncardio, or you're\njust walking along,\nit's very clear based on\na growing amount of data\nthat being a nasal\nbreather is better\nthan being a mouth breather.\nAnd there are a number\nof different reasons\nfor that we've talked about\non the podcast and elsewhere.\nBut one of the additional\nreasons is a main site of entry\nfor infections is\nthrough the mouth.\nSo keep that mouth shut\nunless you need to talk.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning of this\nask me anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nask me anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not released\nanywhere else please go\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast premium channel\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to\nchange the format\nor anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast\nand to fund research,\nin particular, research\ndone on human beings,\nso not animal models\nbut on human beings,\nwhich I think we all agree\nis the species that we\nare most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel,\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast\nand other media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the kind\nof research that\nprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do dollar\nfor dollar match\non all funds raised for research\nthrough the premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science related tools, for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMAs\nyou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions.\nAnd you'll of course get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent such as transcripts\nof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab podcast episodes\nand not found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
